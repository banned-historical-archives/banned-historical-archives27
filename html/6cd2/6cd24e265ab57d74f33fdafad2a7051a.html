 INTRODUCTION
 THE FIRST INTERPROFESSIONAL FORUM
 ON PRIORITIES FOR PEACE
 December 6, 1966, was the 25th anniversary of Pearl Harbor Eve-that moment
 when America slept, indifferent to the strategies of foreign dictators, taking false
 comfort from the assumed security of her great ocean moats, unaware that the
 carriers of Imperial Japan were readying a first strike, and ignorant also of the
 ideology and global war plans of Nazi Germany.
 In the nuclear age, it is imperative that Americans never again misread the
 intentions, or underestimate the capabilities, of totalitarian Party elites. It is vital
 that civilian opinion-leaders understand the complex formulae of national defense
 and security affairs which include factors of technology, diplomacy, economics,
 and national will.
 In order to consider some of these issues systematically and in depth, the
 National Strategy Information Center, Inc., sponsored The First Interprofessional
 Forum on Priorities for Peace at The Plaza Hotel, New York City, on December 6,
 1966. The purpose of this Forum was not to look backward towards December of
 1941, but to focus on the requirements of a sophisticated "forward strategy for
 freedom" that will enable the United States, in the next 10-15 years, to (a) keep
 aggression at bay, whether through insurgency or space warfare, and (b) help less
 fortunate nations build the institutions required for genuine peace and human
 betterment. We sought educational substitutes for Pearl Harbor and searched for
 new organizational skills by which the private citizen can more effectively answer
 the question: "What can I do for my country?"
 The conference was attended by more than 400 participants who comprised
 a cross section of distinguished leadership from business, the professions, and the
 military services.
 The Co-Chairmen of the Forum were Ambassador Theodore C. Achilles,
 Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee, The Atlantic Council of the United
 States, Inc.; Joseph D. Ardleigh, President, The Research Institute of America,
 Inc.; and Major General Alfred G. Tuckerman, USAR (Ret.), Administrative
 Partner, William E. Hill & Company, Inc.
 Honorary Co-Chairmen included Samuel Belkin, President, Yeshiva Univer-
 sity; Albert H. Bowker, Chancellor, The City University of New York; Bernard
 E. Donovan, Superintendent of Schools, The City of New York; Harry D. Gideonse,
 Chancellor, New School for Social Research; Richard H. Heindel, President, Pratt
 Institute; R. Gordon Hoxie, Chancellor, Long Island University; and Rev. Leo
 McLaughlin, S. J., President, Fordham University.

 ARE LENIN, TWO, AND GOEBBELS DEAD?
 Preface to a Pearl Harbor Anniversary
 BY FRANK R. BARNETT
 Summary of Remarks
 Mr. Frank R. Barnett is President of the National Strategy Information Center, Inc.
 Since history never repeats itself exactly, one should not belabor the fact that this
 December 6th is the 25th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor Eve. On the other hand,
 while all analogies are misleading, some may still be instructive. Perhaps two lessons
 can be derived from the remembrance of Pearl Harbor. The first relates to the sin
 of pride. Americans did not win World War II in the Pacific in six weeks, or even
 six months. Our "Asiatic" opponent was more tenacious, more skillful, more courag-
 eous, more inventive than he had been pictured in the comforting mythology of the
 Anglo-American peoples.
 Have we yet overcome our sins of pride? In Korea, against another "Asiatic"
 opponent, we were going to "bring the boys home by Christmas." In Vietnam, it is
 taking half a million men to finish what some politicos thought was a job for only
 a few thousand. And it was only yesterday we were told that American industry
 had nothing to fear from the competition of the "oxcart economy" of the Soviet
 Union. On at least four subsequent occasions we have underestimated the capability
 of that oxcart economy: first, when Stalin's scientists acquired the hydrogen bomb
 five years sooner than most of our experts predicted; second, when Sputnik aston-
 ished the West with the payload Soviet rockets could hurl into space; third, in 1961,
 when Khrushchev's test of a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb may have given Russia
 insights into ways to black out military communications and/or to fuse the guid-
 ance systems of American rockets into impotent lumps; and fourth, today, when
 the commissars have displayed the "economic will" to deploy a fantastically ex-
 pensive ABM system.
 As a footnote to our sin of pride, we might recall that, as little as three years
 ago, many American experts were untroubled by Red China's nuclear ambitions. It
 seemed clear to them that nothing substantial in the way of nuclear weapons was
 to be expected from that "primitive" quarter before 1972 or even 1975. Today,
 the Pentagon concedes that Peking may have some nuclear-tipped rockets in place
 by late 1967, a prospect which should also give pause to Europe, some of whose
 cities are less than half as far removed from Chinese launching sites as San Francisco.
 The second lesson suggested by Pearl Harbor was that, while the immediate
 strike came from the Far East, an even greater threat had already reached almost
 overwhelming proportions in Europe. The unambiguous provocation from Japan
 triggered our belated response to the much more serious danger from Nazi Germany.
 How different the fate of the world if America's "peaceful coexistence" with Hitler

 had been prolonged for another four years! German science and industry, immune
 from the ultimately massive weight of American airpower and the shock of Allied
 invasion, might well have succeeded in asserting domination over Britain and all
 the Eurasian land mass.
 Is there a moral for today in the strategic lessons of World War II? I believe
 there is. A geopolitical axiom for our own time might be expressed in this way:
 "Police the perimeter of the Far Pacific; but remember that whoever masters the
 military-industrial-scientific resources of Europe menaces four continents." And a
 corollary to that precept is: "When you recognize that an adversary's capabilities
 are formidable, do not discount his intentions in order to suit the current fashion of
 ill-informed opinion or the misguided expedience of politicians."
 Everyone can agree that the world is changing and, with it, even the Soviet
 Union. The operational questions are: How much change? In what precise direc-
 tion? By what fraction of the total party bureaucracy? In what time span? In rela-
 tion to what threats or incentives? In what context might positive tendencies reverse
 themselves? For example, no iron law of progress guarantees an upward curve in
 the peaceful intentions of the Soviet leadership, as one generation of rulers succeeds
 another. Since the violent internal politics of a Communist dictatorship could readily
 return another Stalin to power, it would be prudent for the West to preserve its
 defenses intact, pending an evolution of the Soviet system that would give Russian
 public opinion and a loyal political opposition some meaningful leverage against
 Communist careerists.
 It is conceivable that a future generation of largely non-ideological Soviet
 managers may conclude that such Russian war games as Nuclear Roulette (a la
 Cuba) and Fifth Column (d la Syria) are too dangerous for the last quarter of the
 twentieth century. But those managers are not likely to share policymaking author-
 ity with the entrenched ideologues for another fifteen years, if then. Even a casual
 reading of Communist Party journals, or the most cursory examination of recent
 Soviet initiatives in the field of foreign affairs, reveals the imperialist objectives of
 the men in power in Moscow today, tommorrow, and probably until 1975. They
 are latter day Cromwells whose zeal and invulnerable self-righteousness are still
 fed by the writ of Lenin.
 It is alleged by some that Khrushchev's heirs no longer wish to bury capital-
 ism, but would much prefer to inter the Cold War. If this were so, why there's an
 easy end. But is it so?
 Those who postulate the death of Marxist ideology often cite as evidence such
 stuff as the whispered confidence of a Soviet scientist as a Pugwash Conference; or
 an epic of political protest penned by some favorite Russian poet; or the enthusiasm
 of Soviet factory managers for automation and techniques of cost control (as if Hit-
 ler's industrialists had not also been deeply concerned with production efficiency).
 But what is the relevant evidence about the aspirations, not of Russian writers,
 some of whom are now in prison for criticizing socialism, but of the Soviet power
 elite? Do they disclose the mainsprings of their behavior to random Canadian

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 journalists, or rather to U-2 cameras which sometimes see the evidence of Moscow's
 deeper purposes?
 What, for example, is -the percentage of increase in the Soviet defense budgets
 for the new Five Year Plan? Are the hidden components of those budgets chiefly al-
 located to conventional armament, to defensive space warfare, to more exotic of-
 fensive weaponry, or to all of these? Are the men in charge of the Soviet space
 effort civilians? Are they oriented professionally towards the peaceful uses of outer
 space, or to the military potential of inner space? Have the rocket marshals been
 demoted? Are Soviet anti-ballistic missile systems intended only as insurance against
 Red China? Has Moscow deactivated its guerrilla warfare training schools? Has it
 reduced subsidies for anti-American propaganda in Latin America? Or stopped
 arms shipments to the Middle East? Or cut back industrial espionage inside the
 United States? Or curtailed the construction of submarines and a military trawler
 fleet?
 Whether uttered in Paris or Moscow or Vienna, the words of those who actu-
 ally rule the USSR give scant support for the assumption that Soviet leaders have
 changed their long term goals. Brezhnev, Kosygin, Podgorny, Suslov-indeed, all
 high Party officials-hammer incessently at three themes: first, that German mili-
 tarism and "revanchism" must be squashed-and that, therefore, it is just up to
 Washington to prove its peaceful intentions by severing military ties with Bonn;
 second, that the Vietnam War can only be settled by the withdrawal of American
 troops, and the formation of a Saigon coalition government in Saigon that will en-
 sure an eventual Communist takeover; and third, that Russia is a European power,
 and would join a "neutralist" Europe in the pursuit of peace once NATO is dis-
 solved and an "alien" America has been encouraged to retire to its own continent.
 Thus, if one applies a "management audit," rather than intuition, to the assess-
 ment of Soviet goals, it is clear that Moscow adheres to the simple Stalinist objective
 of expelling American power from both Europe and Asia (albeit with a mix of
 diplomacy, threats, and propaganda instead of naked force). Indeed, the commis-
 sars scarcely need change or conceal their tactics, so anxious are certain Western
 statesmen to divine portents of "relaxation and reform" in the contrails of the
 Eastern heavens.
 Do the Soviets send ground-to-air rockets to Hanoi, and Russian technicians
 to give instructions on how to launch them against American planes? No matter.
 We should infer, from the firm handclasp of the Commissar for Trade, that Russian
 weapons are sent to Hanoi reluctantly.
 Did Soviet leaders subsidize the 1966 Tri-Continental Conference in Havana
 and further its export trade in guerrilla warfare? Do they today intensify their sub-
 version of the Middle East? No matter, they have not threatened Berlin at all this
 season (although those who try to flee from "mellowing" totalitarianism are still
 shot down at the Wall).
 Does massive Soviet propaganda exploit the unpopularity of the Vietnam war
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 to isolate America from our friends in France and Britain? Does Brezhnev resist all
 British suggestions that Moscow use its good offices to bring Hanoi to the negotiat-
 ing table? Do the commiissars ship arms to Syria, Algeria, and the UAR for re-
 volutionary re-export? No matter. Though they persist in their propaganda . . .
 though they seek to re-establish a Popular Front in France and Italy . . . though
 they vilify our West German ally and accelerate their expenditure on missiles .. .
 we may yet civilize the Soviets by sharing with them the fruits of Western technol-
 ogy which (by manipulating semantics) can even be re-classified as "non-strategic."
 In such a world of apolitical largesse from the United States, what incentive
 could any Soviet leader have for altering his hostile stance on the future of a unified
 Germany, or the fate of Vietnam, or the stability of the Middle East (threatened
 by terrorists paid as Nasser's proxies from Moscow's exchequer)? In today's climate
 of illusion, stubborn facts are rejected by the even more stubborn dogma of detente.
 For, despite Moscow's determined effort to overtake and leapfrog American mili-
 tary technology and notwithstanding the undiminished scale of worldwide Com-
 munist agitation, some Americans seem willing to assist General de Gaulle in dis-
 mantling those proud towers of NATO which, for 17 years, have barred the Tartar
 horde from Europe.
 The debate over Russian intentions and the continued utility of a reconstructed
 NATO is, perhaps, the gravest problem we face in foreign policy; but it is by no
 means the only one. The statistics on world poverty and the population explosion
 stab the imagination and cry out both t:o conscience and common sense. Unless the
 industrialized nations of the northern hemisphere (the United States, Canada,
 Western Europe, and Japan) can transfer more efficient packages of capital, man-
 agement know-how, food technology, public administration, vocational training,
 agricultural science, and sheer motivation to Afro-Asia and Latin America, three
 quarters of the earth may be a rural slum in the year 2,000; and from that slum will
 bubble perpetual revolution guided by Maoists., Leninists, Castroites, or the would-
 be Sukarnos and Nkrumahs of the 21st century.
 The problem is so vast that it challenges the private sector as well as govern-
 ment. In the long run, only private capital. has enough dynamism to create the
 jobs, technical expertise and tax base desperately required by the underdeveloped
 continents if they are to endure the ordeal of modernization. Universities and labor
 unions, foundations and international corporations, professional societies and the
 missionary branches of organized religion-all have a larger role to play if billions
 of human beings are not to drown in the quicksand of ignorance, terror, and
 disease. What irony it is that a tragedy of such cosmic magnitude might occur in
 the century which may yet witness, before its close, the healing of ancient religious
 schisms and the liberation of man from earth.
 To be wary of the unrepentent Bolshevik myrmidon, while extending a friendly
 hand to the non-Communist Russian majority; to stand guard against the Maoist
 guerrilla, while aiding the peasant whom the Communist revolutionary seeks to

 complex already employs its systems analysis, management efficiency, and multi-
 disciplinary operations to improve social and economic conditions as well as to
 strengthen defense; to prove that modern realpolitik is not bereft of humanitarian
 concern, and that latter day American capitalism is generating a progressive social
 ethic; to show that realists are not without compassion and that idealists can be prag-
 matic-here are the endless challenges and paradoxes than can excite and ennoble
 us all.
 Let me conclude with a paradox that is the premise of this conference. It is that
 the serious study of war and an intelligent strategy for peace are complementary,
 not antithetical. Both national defense and wars on poverty, whether at home or
 abroad, require unsentimental analysis, skillful resource allocation, and a trained,
 professional cadre with good hearts and souls tranquil in the conviction that our
 cause is just. The baffling formulation we must learn to cope with over the next
 fifty years is "neither war nor peace;" and to solve it we must study both war and
 peace.
 Since 1945, there have been no fewer than forty wars, large and small, on this
 earth. In that same period, the American people have spent $842 billion on defense
 and an additional $120 billion on foreign aid. The current defense budget calls for
 $73 billion more; which means that, by June 1968, our nation will have allocated
 more than one trillion dollars to containment of Communist aggression and to sup-
 port of the social and economic reconstruction of less fortunate nations.' To those
 who ask, Why hold an non-governmental Interprofessional Forum on international
 security? one can only reply that it is scarcely plausible for a great Republic to
 pride itself on civilian control of the direction of the ship of state unless commercial,
 voluntary, and non-profit private organizations address themselves professionally
 to the one trillion dollar question.

 MILITARY AND TECHNOLOGICAL SURPRISE:
 THE LESSONS OF PEARL HARBOR
 BY ADMIRAL ARLEIGH A. BURKE, USN (RET.)
 Summary o f Remarks
 Admiral Arleigh A. Burke, USN (Ret.), is now Director of The Center for Strategic
 Studies, Georgetown University.
 There are essentially three levels of military surprise: strategic, tactical, and tech-
 nological. At Pearl Harbor the Japanese achieved tactical surprise. They won an
 engagement, but not the war. Pearl. Harbor taught again an old lesson of history,
 namely, that surprise alone on any single level, or even on a combination of levels,
 is not enough for victory unless an irreparable proportion of the enemy's power-
 or of his will to fight-is destroyed by the surprise itself.
 Of all the factors involved in a surprise event, the reaction of the recipient is
 clearly the most important, and yet probably the most difficult to understand. Sur-
 prise strikes the individual at many layers of his being; simultaneously. It stirs his
 emotions; it stimulates his mind; and at its most effective, surprise will smother the
 ability to act. Mankind has struggled over the generations to understand these
 elements that stir within us in moments of great surprise. Yet, even since Pearl
 Harbor, there is little evidence of progress toward really comprehending how these
 forces work or how they can be controlled. Perhaps the study of cybernetics is a
 step toward understanding and controlling the reactions of masses of people. But,
 if so, it will be full of unknowns; and in the end, it may actually increase the effec-
 tiveness of surprise as a weapon instead of leading to its control.
 If our quest for an understanding of the human elements of surprise has not
 made much progress since Pearl Harbor, our quest for technological innovation
 certainly has. Indeed, technology has in some ways advanced to the point where
 it can be confused with human understanding itself. To cite a single example, our
 technical ability to collect and transmit information has gone through an amazing
 revolution since 1941, and rapid progress in this area will probably continue far
 into the future. The computer, the communications satellites, high speed trans-
 mission--these are but a few examples of this revolution. Their combined ability
 to transmit and manipulate information is an achievement few of us dreamed of in
 the days before Pearl Harbor.
 But again let us learn a lesson from Pearl Harbor, It is that the mere posses-
 sion of vast quantities of information is not enough. In the weeks before the attack
 on December 7, 1941, an enormous amount of intelligence was at our disposal.
 One of the great tragedies of that occasion was that we literally had more informa-
 tion than we knew what to do with. We failed to evaluate the data we had. We
 should not confuse our ability to collect information with our capacity for using it.

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 And further, as we look into the 1970's, let us not misread the relationship
 between our ability to gather information and our vulnerability to surprise. Infor-
 mation will not save us from surprise unless it is properly used. On the contrary,
 the very volume of information available to us may make the possibilities of surprise
 even greater.
 For example, our greatly improved information capability has made the possi-
 ble employment of our military hardware much more flexible than ever before.
 Much of this flexibility comes from vastly improved information technology. There
 is no reason why, through the development of a similar technology, our potential
 enemies cannot gain an equal capability. Moreover, underdeveloped societies can
 also imitate the technical achievements of our own society. We do research, we
 develop and devise, and they copy. This may be very beneficial for mankind. But
 it also means that because we live in an open, individualistic, pluralistic society,
 we are at a disadvantage. Totalitarian societies have relatively free access to the
 fruits of our labors. But they do not accord us the same freedom. In consequence,
 our technological achievements, plus those in the totalitarian world, multiplied by
 the number of people making their first leap into the age of technology, increase
 the possibilities of surprise many times over.
 We must not mislead ourselves about the ability of any other nation in any
 other part of the world to imitate and use the military tools that we have worked
 so hard to invent. We must persist in developing new tools and improving our old
 ones, and we must make the extended effort and sacrifice of actually producing
 them. The totalitarian society, having the benefit of our pioneering work, need only
 suffer through the imitation gap; whereas we would have to start from scratch,
 without the benefit of their labors, if we allowed them to get the technological
 jump on us.
 In short, surprise is not only possible; it is now easier to achieve, and it is
 deadlier. We must, therefore, prepare ourselves with the understanding that surprise
 itself is not the overwhelming danger. Rather, it is the inability to deal with a sur-
 prise situation. Above all, we must not live in the illusion that great surprises
 cannot now occur. We have been surprised in the past. We will be surprised in the
 future.
 We must be so experienced and so alert that the surprises we shall inevitably
 receive will not prove disastrous to the nation.

 THE FUTURE OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE
 BY THEODORE C. ACHILLES
 Summary o!? f Remarks
 Ambassador Theodore C. Achilles is 'Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee, The
 Atlantic Council of the United States, In.c.
 Ilopefully we have learned two political lessons from the tragedy of Pearl Harbor.
 One is negative, namely, that the surest way to invite attack is to give the
 impression of being unprepared for war, or unwilling to fight back, of being afraid,
 divided, or committed to neutrality. We have had to learn this lesson the hard way,
 particularly during the years 1914 to 11917 and 1931: to 1941. I hope we have
 learned, although twice already since World War II we have slipped in Asia: first
 in 1949 and 1950, when we allowed the Communists to believe that we did not
 consider Korea important to our security; and again in the 1950's, when we failed
 to make clear our interest in the preservation of an independent South Vietnam.
 The other lesson is a positive one. It is that the surest way to prevent attack,
 by surprise or otherwise, is to make clear our ability and determination to reply to
 any attack with all our massive power. That lesson was reflected by the Senate in
 the famous Vandenberg Resolution of 1948, which requested the President to
 "Contribut(e) to the maintenance of peace by making clear (this country's)
 determination to exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense under
 Article 51 (of the United Nations Charter) should any armed attack occur affecting
 its national security." It was reflected again in the NATO and SEATO alliances, in
 our treaties with Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, and in a variety of arrange-
 ments with other countries.
 And having thus demonstrated our willingness, we have also developed and
 maintained our ability to defend ourselves, through the steady development of our
 conventional and nuclear power, through military assistance to our allies, and
 through the NATO system of integrated command, planning, warning, communica-
 tions, and logistical systems. This method has worked effectively in Europe.
 Not only has there been no aggression in Europe, but the Kremlin has been
 led to modify its threatening tone toward the West, to the point where many
 in Europe, and some in this country, are reluctant to pay the price of con-
 tinued vigilance and preparedness. It has worked so well in Europe that it has also
 forced the Kremlin to shift the target of its major efforts to other parts of the world,
 and its methods from aggression or the threat of aggression to encouraging local
 "wars of liberation," infiltration, and subversion.
 But we still have much to learn. Vietnam is a warning that we cannot single-
 handedly police the whole world. There may well be other and bigger "Vietnams,"
 and more than one of them simultaneously. Nor can we expect much help from

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 our European allies in such episodes, so long as they consider these problems as
 unrelated to themselves, as solely American dilemmas. They certainly do now. Our
 European allies, recently shorn of their own colonial possessions, complacently
 enjoy an unprecedented prosperity and the sure protection of our nuclear umbrella,
 while at the same time charging us with a desire for political "domination" and,
 with considerable justification, with an inability to exercise effective international
 leadership.
 How can we best combat Communist subversion and indirect, creeping aggres-
 sion, which can be just as dangerous and far more insidious than direct armed
 attack? How can we enlist the wholehearted cooperation and the military, industrial,
 political, and psychological support of our allies in doing so?
 During the debate on ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, Senator Van-
 denberg made a prophetic statement. "Unless the Treaty becomes far more than a
 purely military alliance," he said, "it will be at the mercy of the first plausible
 Soviet peace offensive." NATO's present troubles prove the wisdom of his words.
 The alliance has failed to adapt to changing circumstances, and thus far has proved
 unable to develop the positive political, economic, and psychological potential of
 the North Atlantic Treaty.
 How do we go about these tasks? Certainly we cannot afford to let down our
 guard, so long as the military capabilities of the USSR continue to be, and those
 of Red China seem likely to develop into, a threat to our national security. But
 even more important is to get on with the positive effort of building the kind of
 world we would like to see even if Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao had never lived.
 The United States cannot do it alone. On the other hand, we and our allies of the
 Atlantic community constitute the greatest bastion of military, industrial, scientific,
 intellectual, and moral power in the world, if we can but learn to use it effectively
 together. In President Kennedy's words:
 "Acting on our own by ourselves, we cannot establish justice
 throughout the world. We cannot insure its domestic tranquility, or pro-
 vide for its common defense, or promote its general welfare, or secure
 the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. But joined with
 other free nations, we can do all this and more. We can mount a deter-
 rent powerful enough to deter any aggression and ultimately we can
 help achieve a world of law and free choice, banishing the world of war
 and coercion."
 We can move steadily in this direction by quiet but determined United States
 leadership to seek common or harmonized policies with our allies, and concerted
 action on major matters of mutual concern in the political and economic as well as
 the military field. This means listening as well as talking, taking the interests of our
 allies into account in the process of policy formulation, demonstrating in practice
 that we seek not "domination" but rather the joint use of the power of the Atlantic
 community in the pursuit of common objectives.

 Indeed, we can move in this direction even without radical change or innova-
 tion. But this may not be fast enough for the next generation. In the 1968 presi-
 dential election, there will be 26 million eligible voters who were not yet born at the
 time of Pearl Harbor. I hope this new generation will remember the main lesson
 of Pearl Harbor. It is that the surest way to avoid aggression is to make clear in ad-
 vance that we have both the determination and the ability to respond overwhelm-
 ingly. I also hope that they will do far better than we have done to build the kind of
 world we and they want to see, the kind of world in which freedom can endure and
 prosper, the kind of world President Kennedy envisaged and that President Eisen-
 hower had in mind when he stated in his farewell message to NATO:
 "Together we must build a Community which will best safeguard
 the individual freedom and national[ values of our various peoples and
 at the same time provide effective means of dealing, with problems with
 which none of us, alone, can now deal effectively."'

 PRIORITIES FOR UNITED STATES POLICY IN EUROPE
 BY HENRY A. KISSINGER
 Summary of Remarks
 Dr. Henry A. Kissinger is Professor of Government at Harvard University and a staff
 member of the Center for International Affairs.
 The current NATO crisis was touched off by the peremptory French decision to
 withdraw from the integrated military commands of the alliance. But the sources of
 the crisis go much deeper than this. In many respects, our present difficulties stem
 from the success of previous policies. The original concept of NATO was correct
 for the situation which then existed. But we must recognize that the relationship
 between Western Europe and the United States, as it has developed since World
 War II, now stands in urgent need of revision. The whole structure and priorities
 of the Atlantic Alliance must be reconsidered.
 Some Policy Issues Before the Atlantic Alliance
 It may be useful to begin by summarizing some main threads of United States
 policy toward Western Europe since World War II. First, we have supported the
 notion of an equal partnership between the United States and Western Europe,
 with an equitable sharing of responsibilities as between the twin pillars of this
 Atlantic partnership. Second, we have conceived of the political and economic in-
 tegration of Europe as a prerequisite to formation of an effective Atlantic partner-
 ship, and we have viewed such integration in terms of the evolution of supranational
 federal institutions controlled by a European parliament. Third, while the United
 States has advocated a twin pillar concept in the political and economic spheres,
 we have consistently urged an integrated military defense, including the central
 command and control of nuclear weapons.
 A great advantage of this overall approach was that the United States offered
 a clear-cut policy at a difficult stage in postwar history. But unfortunately, we have
 tended to look upon it as the only conceivable pattern of relationships, which it is
 not. Moreover, the American view has always contained some inconsistencies, such
 as the depreciation of the value of the nation state in Western Europe (where the
 idea of nationalism first originated), at a time when the nation state was still viewed
 by us as perfectly natural in the emerging areas of the world, and nationalism as a
 positive good in Eastern Europe. Another inconsistency was our insistence upon
 the general validity of the American experience in federal institutions, which ignores
 the unique circumstances that have made possible the success of the American
 federal experiment, and also overlooks the strong sense of national identity among
 the states of Western Europe, especially France and Britain.
 President de Gaulle has proclaimed a profoundly different view of Atlantic

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 relationships and European unity. In part, no doubt, his brutal. tactics and arrogant
 style have been designed to restore to France a sense of self-confidence and national
 power, which were all but destroyed by defeat in two world wars and by the bitter
 disappointments of the early postwar period. In a sense, the object has been to
 teach his country and his continent the attitudes of independence and self-reliance;
 and this is, indeed, an act of historic importance. In substantive terms, de Gaulle
 is wary of integration in any sphere, but particularly in the military field. Where the
 United States believes in the obsolescence of the nation state, especially in Europe,
 de Gaulle passionately affirms its continued role. De Gaulle's concept of Europe is
 based upon the free agreement of governments. He insists on autonomy in matters
 relating to nuclear weapons. Recently, apparently having despaired of the long
 term prospects for Franco-German cooperation, which would be essential to his
 overall approach, he has begun to resurrect the notion of an historic Russo-French
 understanding.
 De Gaulle's tactics should not blind one to the deeper challenge of his policies.
 There is much to be said, for example, for his view that a political unit must mean
 something to itself before it can mean much to others. Unfortunately, his imperial
 style has often blinded others to the substance of his views, and his brutal tactics
 have thwarted the accomplishment of his aims.
 The main victim in the current crisis of NATO, however, has been the Federal
 Republic of Germany. Whether by accident or design, Bonn has become the focus
 of almost every aspect of the crisis. Here the question is whether the fundamental
 balance and prospective solidarity of the Federal Republic since World War II can
 stand such persistent pressure. Behind the facade of prosperity and well-being, the
 sense of impermanence and insecurity in West Germany is absolutely central. The
 present German nightmare is a reappearance of the historical isolation which for
 most of its history has forced Germany to confront hostility on all its borders. Today
 the dominant German aspiration is to escape the burden of difficult choices. If the
 Federal Republic becomes the focal point of all European tensions, the Germans
 are likely to turn upon the apparent cause of their isolation. We in the United
 States must not find ourselves in this position.
 Alone among the Atlantic powers, Germany cannot be satisfied with the
 territorial status quo. But since the Berlin Wall in 1961. Germany's hope that the
 ultimate goal of unification could be achieved by progressively closer integration
 within the Atlantic Alliance has been shattered. NATO is no longer the clear road
 to reunification. It is in this context that efforts to relax East-West tensions are
 judged by the Germans. They are uneasy lest the relationship between East and
 West Germany become frozen. Hence their concern with "central agreements"
 affecting East-West relations unless they bring about some visible progress on the
 German question.
 West Germany has emerged as the balance wheel of the Atlantic Alliance.
 l;very crisis seems to focus on Bonn. But West Germany's internal structure may
 not be equal to this strain. The dominant political parties, now restrained by their

 desire to act as responsible trustees of an acceptable concensus. could well be torn
 apart, and extremist tendencies liberated thereby. Incipient schizophrenia is an
 integral part of political life in West Germany. The volatility of the situation im-
 poses a requirement of great circumspection on American policy. The insecurity of
 German leaders and their desire to be good allies cause them to go along with many
 American proposals. But there is a limit to how much they could take. A break
 with France which could be ascribed to American pressure might, for example,
 easily backfire on us. The same could be true of the possible frustration deriving
 from overtures toward East Germany. What the Federal Republic needs above all
 is solid, reliable allies. It cannot stand to be the focal point of all international
 pressures.
 The nuclear problem has been at the heart of NATO debate in recent years.
 But this misconceived the central issue, which is to adjust United States relations
 with Western Europe, and relations between the Communist bloc and the free
 world, to new conditions. The nuclear control issue cannot be solved by any so-
 called "hardware" solutions. In any case, the question diverts attention away from
 the cardinal problem of political cooperation to an intensely divisive side issue. If a
 coordinated diplomacy could be achieved, the problem of nuclear control would
 seem less crucial. If such cooperation cannot be developed, theoretical voting
 formulae for entering nuclear war will prove empty. The primary guarantee for our
 allies is a harmonization of political objectives so that their concept of their vital
 interests is virtually indistinguishable from our own.
 Where Do We Go From Here? Some Policy Suggestions
 Let me briefly summarize some of the long term goals which should guide
 United States policy in the period ahead.
 First, we should encourage a greater degree of political and military autonomy
 for Europe. This is essential for the cohesion of the West, and is in our own long
 term interest as well. Any attempt by the United States to play a major role simul-
 taneously in every part of the globe is beyond our psychological resources, however
 great our physical resources may be. We should encourage Europe to take a greater
 responsibility in the world, for our sake as well as its own. Moreover, we would
 benefit from a political counterweight which would discipline the occasional im-
 petuosity of American policy and supply historical perspective to our penchant for
 abstract political solutions.
 The central task is to encourage a European sense of responsibility. Europe
 as a Third Force in the sense of being powerful and active in world affairs is in our
 interest, even if its internal structure does not follow our preferred prescriptions.
 There is little to fear in the outcome. A Europe assuming greater responsibility for
 its own foreign policy and defense will be bound to recognize that only one potential
 threat to its security exists, and that in every conceivable case this threat could be
 met more effectively with United States assistance than without it. It is hard to

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 visualize a deal between the Soviet Union. and Europe which jeopardizes our inter-
 ests or security and which did not jeopardize European interests and security first.
 Such an approach requires, however, great restraint on the part of the United States
 and a high degree of tolerance and wisdom in coming to terms with a more dynamic
 Europe.
 How much integration do we really want in Europe? Many argue that Europe
 is reluctant to play a global role today primarily because: of the inadequate resources
 of the individual states. They argue that a unified Europe would assume greater
 global responsibilities, and that, therefore, the proper policy is to urge more in-
 tegration and to press for European unity., This view is vastly oversimplified. There
 is no automatic relationship between power and a willingness to play an inter-
 national role. Having just relinquished their overseas possessions, the European
 countries no longer consider their security to be directly affected by what happens
 in such remote corners of the globe as Southeast Asia. They are quite willing to
 shift the risks and burdens to us. Our allies may be expected to assume their por-
 tion of the responsibility only when we all. share the same view of the international
 political. environment, at least as it affects Europe, and when they are persuaded
 that the United States will reduce its contribution unless they play a greater role.
 Thus it seems appropriate to consider how much integration we really want.
 Progressively greater integration will generate increasing demands for European
 participation in global decisions. This leads to the curious position that our allies at
 one and the same time reduce their defense contributions while pressing for in-
 creased political influence. In such a system policy may grow stagnant. The alliance
 will be able to agree only on doing nothing. Of course? we should cooperate with
 the Europeans wherever possible. But in the long term, excessive concentration of
 decision making may deprive our allies of the incentive to act responsibly, and may
 open up political fissures when a conflict of interests becomes apparent, especially
 in crises outside of Europe.
 With respect to military integration, steps should be taken to reduce the
 dominant position of the United States in the NATO Alliance. In the 1950's, a
 dominant position for the United States seemed to our allies the best guarantee of
 our commitment to the defense of Europe.. Their interest was in the symbolic, not
 the substantive, aspect of NATO. Such a state of affairs cannot be healthy in the
 long run. An area so rich and potentially so powerful as Europe should not leave
 its defense to a country three thousand miles away. The present system encourages
 too many of our allies to shift the costs and responsibilities of the common defense
 to us.
 Europe will not assume a larger share of the burden until it also shares a larger
 responsibility. While modern technology requires the maintenance of integrated
 military commands, the relative weight of Europe in the command structure and
 in the NATO organization should be increased. In every other field, American
 policy has deliberately sought to reduce Europe's dependence on the United States.

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 In the military field, by contrast, the United States has not encouraged the emer-
 gence of a specifically European point of view.
 As already indicated, so-called "hardware" solutions to the nuclear issue do
 not seem fruitful. Since the problem is essentially political, the Special (McNamara)
 Committee should be given the task to formulate common strategic doctrine and
 common disarmament policy. Within its framework, the European countries could
 begin to build a closer association if they wished to do so. As Europe gains stature,
 the Special Committee could draw nearer to the twin pillars concept. Atlantic
 partnership and increased European cohension thus could be pursued simultane-
 ously, with no commitment in advance to giving priority to either course.
 If this solution does not satisfy our allies over the long term, a European
 nuclear force would be preferable to any apparent "hardware" solution that has
 been discussed. Indeed, it is likely that nuclear autonomy would be the least di-
 visive form of European unity, and would include few risks for the United States.
 Whatever their formal autonomy in the nuclear field, it is highly improbable that
 our allies would prefer to go to war with the relatively small nuclear forces that
 would be available to them without the support of our necessarily preponderant
 arsenal. Close cooperation between Europe and the United States in the nuclear
 field is dictated by mutual self-interest, and Europe has more to gain from it than
 the United States.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S MILITARY CAPABILITY
 AND THE STABILITY 01-1 ASIA
 BY RALPH .L.. POWELL
 Summary of Remarks
 Dr. Ralph L. Powell is Professor of Far Eastern Studies at the School of International
 Service, The American University.
 I should like to shift your attention from Europe and NATO to the growing prob-
 lem of security in Asia. I shall consider very briefly the following four points: first,
 the conventional armed forces of Communist China; second, and more important,
 their development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; third, some indication
 of what they may plan to do with this increasing military capability; and finally,
 the impact that all this is having on our friends and allies in Asia.
 It is, of course, impossible to present a completely accurate picture of the
 armed forces of Communist China. But I believe that it is possible to offer an
 evaluation that will outline the general parameters of their military strength and
 capabilities.
 The conventional armed forces of Communist China are the third largest in
 the world, next only in size to those: of the United States and the Soviet Union.
 This includes the largest land army in the world, a force of about 2.3 million men.
 it is still essentially a World War II or Korean-type army, with modern arms but
 not the most advanced military weaponry. It is, however, a tough and well-trained
 military force.
 The air force of Communist China is the world's third largest. It has become
 increasingly obsolescent since the Soviets withdrew their military assistance in 1960.
 But, as in other fields of military development, the Chinese Communists are de-
 veloping an increasing capability for manufacturing jet aircraft themselves, and the
 quality of their air force is now improving again. They now have about 2,300
 planes; somewhat less than 2,000 of these are jet aircraf.`it, mostly obsolescent MIG
 15's and 17's, but there are an increasing number of supersonic MIG 19's and some
 high-performance MIG 21's.
 The navy has always been the weakest of Communist China's armed forces.
 It is essentially a coastal defense force. Yet Peking does have a fleet of about 30
 submarines which, as their crews receive more deep water training, could become
 it serious threat. Also, Communist China is now reported to have operational a
 "G" class Soviet-type submarine with three missile tubes capable of firing ballistic
 missiles with a radius of about 400 miles.
 The conventional forces of Communist China have certain special strengths.
 First, of course, is their very size, and the availability of almost limitless military

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 reserves. The mere size of these forces tends to frighten mainland China's small
 Asian neighbors. Furthermore, Peking's senior military commanders are probably
 the most experienced combat leaders in the world; many of them have had more
 than twenty years of almost constant combat experience. The younger officers have
 been carefully trained in a whole hierarchy of modern military schools. The enlisted
 personnel are intelligent and tough. Finally, the whole force is certainly the most
 highly indoctrinated military establishment in the world.
 Yet, despite their great strengths, the armed forces of Communist China still
 have some very important weaknesses. Of course, the primary weakness is that they
 still do not have a meaningful nuclear capability, although they are rapidly develop-
 ing one. Secondly, the Chinese economy is still only partially developed, and
 remains incapable of producing all the advanced conventional military hardware
 necessary for large scale war. But here again, they are producing more and more
 sophisticated materials in the conventional hardware field every year. Finally, the
 Chinese Communists have a vast conscript force in being, but they suffer from many
 of the problems characteristic of large garrison forces which have long been at
 peace-at least, as far as the bulk of their forces are concerned.
 Much more critical to the security of the United States and to the peace of
 the world is the development of a nuclear capability and a missile delivery system
 by the Chinese Communists. Western specialists have seriously underestimated the
 capacity of the Chinese Communists in these respects. Since October 1964, the
 Chinese Communists have carried out four atomic tests, and Washington has
 recently announced that they are preparing to carry out a fifth. The first two tests
 were essentially of atomic devices similar to the Hiroshima bomb of 1945. But the
 third test, in May 1966, was a weapon ten times as powerful, in the range of some-
 thing over 200 kilotons; and the fourth test, which took place in October, is
 believed to have been a weapon capable of delivery by a missile having a range
 estimated at about 400 miles.
 Thus the Chinese Communists are rapidly building up a meaningful nuclear
 capability. They are testing warheads, and it is obvious from the experiments they
 have been carrying out in the missile field, that they are going to put heavy empha-
 sis on the development of missilry. Indeed, Secretary of Defense McNamara has
 stated that the Chinese Communists will probably begin to deploy medium range
 ballistic missiles capable of threatening their Asian neighbors by 1968 at the latest;
 and that by 1975-80, Communist China will probably begin to develop ICBM's
 capable of striking at the continental United States.
 Now that the Chinese Communists are beginning to develop a real nuclear
 weapons capability, what are they apt to do with it? What is their doctrine in this
 field? While their doctrine has not yet been fully enunciated, there are several
 things that we do know about it. First, in terms of general foreign policy, both the
 imperial heritage of the Chinese Communists and their Communist ideology tend
 to make them expansionist and aggressive. But this must be understood in a revolu-
 tionary sense. They have as an announced objective the support of revolution in all
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 the underdeveloped areas of the world, and presumably they will attempt to use
 their weaponry to support these objectives. And yet, the Chinese Communists are
 not irrational, despite the violent and vitriolic character of their propaganda. In
 actual practice, the conduct of foreign policy by the Chinese Communists since the
 Korean War has been more prudent, more cautious, than their violent propaganda
 would indicate. I would assume that this element of prudence, which is actually an
 integral part of Mao Tse-tung's revolutionary doctrine, would continue to have
 some bearing on the future. Hence it was not really necessary for Khrushchev to
 inform Mao Tse-tung that the American "paper tiger" had thermonuclear teeth.
 The Chinese Communists were already aware of it. Indeed, it is part of their doc-
 trine that although the enemy should be despised strategically, he must under all
 circumstances be respected tactically. Up to this point in time, they have followed
 their own military doctrine in this respect with great care.
 Hence, specialists tend to believe that the Chinese Communists will utilize a
 relatively small nuclear capability primarily to support political and psychological
 strategies, including atomic blackmail. During the next decade, they may very well
 attempt to use a limited nuclear capability to make nuclear hostages out of our
 friends and allies in Asia. One of their basic objectives, frequently stated by them,
 is to force the United States out of Asia. I believe they will use their increasing
 military capabilities in an attempt to achieve this objective, but primarily by at-
 tempting, to put pressure on our friends and allies so that they will force the United
 States to give up its bases in the Pacific islands and on the Asian continent. Further-
 more, since they claim that their official policy is to support all so-called "wars of
 national liberation"-what we would call revolutionary wars or insurrection-
 throughout the world, they may in the coming decade be more willing to risk inter-
 vention with their own conventional forces in conflicts around their frontiers. (This
 assumes that the West would not be willing to use atomic weaponry against Chinese
 forces if the latter have some nuclear capability.)
 What, then, has been the reaction of our friends and allies in Asia to the
 development of a nuclear capability by Communist China? Interestingly enough,
 following the first two tests of Hiroshima-type devices, there was much less
 reaction than we had expected. In part, this arose from the fact that in each case
 the United States government had announced in advance the Chinese Communists'
 intention. to carry out a nuclear test. (Washington has done this again in the case
 of the upcoming fifth test.) This advanced warning tended to take away the psy-
 chological "shock" impact of the tests. Also, we were attempting to inform our
 Asian friends that there is a tremendous difference between an initial atomic test
 and the development of a sophisticated nuclear capability. Sometimes I think we
 have almost overeducated our Asian friends on this subject.
 Asian reaction to the third and fourth tests, however, has been considerably
 more serious, and for good reasons. This was partly because the third test was so
 much more powerful than the first two, and partly because the fourth test was
 delivered by a ballistic missile. Still, there has been no panic among our Asian
 friends. But it is clear that the development of a nuclear capability by the Chinese

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Communists is going to create some serious problems for the United States in Asia.
 One of these, incidentally, is the question of proliferation. The development of
 nuclear weapons by Communist China is putting increased pressure on the govern-
 ments of Japan and India, especially, to develop atomic weapons themselves.
 Second, in the long run the development of a nuclear weapons capability by Com-
 munist China will probably produce two very different reactions among our Asian
 friends and allies. Some of them, fearing that United States determination to defend
 them may falter, may seek an accommodation with Communist China, in which
 case they would probably demand the withdrawal of American bases from their
 territory (this being a primary objective of the Chinese Communists). On the other
 hand, a more widespread reaction would probably be a demand on the part of our
 friends and allies for greater protection against Communist China, for the extension
 of a stronger nuclear umbrella over them.
 Hence the development of a nuclear weapons capability by Communist China
 is going to have several important implications for United States policy. It will im-
 pose a major test on the credibility of the United States nuclear deterrent in Asia.
 I would doubt whether our Asia friends and allies will put as much faith and
 credence in the United States deterrent, and in American willingness to defend
 Asia, as our European allies, in general, have placed in our readiness to defend
 Europe. As the Chinese Communists develop a capability to destroy Tokyo, or
 Manila, or New Delhi-and especially when they develop an ICBM capability to
 strike the United States itself, our Asian friends may understandably question
 whether the United States would be willing to endanger San Francisco, or New
 York, or Washington to defend Tokyo, or Taipei, or New Delhi.
 And in the longer run-but certainly in less than two decades, the Chinese
 Communists will probably develop a capability actually to threaten the basic and
 fundamental security of the United States itself. This is going to be a much more
 serious problem. In short range terms, this involves us deeply in the whole debate
 over the development of an anti-missile missile program, that is, an ABM program
 within the United States. One of the major arguments is going to revolve around
 the question whether we should develop an anti-missile missile program aimed not
 so much at the Soviet Union as at Communist China's much less sophisticated
 nuclear capability.
 In short, during the decade ahead the development of a significant nuclear
 capability on the part of Communist China is going to have a serious impact on
 our foreign policy, particularly our policy in Asia. And later on, its impact will be
 felt on basic national security policy itself.

 ABM SYSTEMS AND INDETERMINATE
 OUTCOME DETERRENCE
 BY RICHARD B. FOSTER
 Summary of Remarks
 Dr. Richard B. Foster is Director of the Strategic Studies Center, Stanford Research
 Institute.
 The fundamental basis for the defense of the United States. and also Europe, from
 direct nuclear attack by the Soviet Union or Communist China is closely related to
 the concept of deterrence. But we sometimes forget that the nature of deterrence
 changes over time. Deterrence today, as between the Soviet Union and the United
 States, is based on a belief shared by both sides that either side can inflict un-
 acceptable damage upon the other by destroying cities----with their population,
 wealth, and cultural values. ]inhibitions against the use even of tactical nuclear
 weapons for limited purposes is closely related to this. That is, both sides are de-
 terred from initiating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in military conflict largely
 because such a conflict might easily escalate into general war; and general war in
 the nuclear age could result in the obliteration of both societies. In short, both sides
 have been deterred from the use of nuclear weapons through fear of national
 destruction.
 But the deterrence implicit in this balance of tenor can change. There are
 possibilities within technology today that may alter the very nature of deterrence
 from a guarantee of mutual destruction, to a deterrence based upon the concept of
 the uncertainty of outcome either of general war or of limited nuclear conflict. This
 prospective change derives from the possibility of developing an effective defense
 against ballistic missiles, that is, the so-called ABM defense system.
 I f the Soviets continue to deploy an ABM system which they consider to be
 reasonably effective, and thus in their judgment achieve some balance between
 missile offense and defense; if they also proceed with a greatly increased rate of
 deployment of their ICBM's; if, finally, they deal with fallout problems, at least to
 some extent, through increased efforts in civil defense; then they could conceivably
 achieve a military posture in the 1970's 'which would give them a fundamental
 strategic advantage over the United States. This country would necessarily con-
 tinue to base its nuclear strategy on the concept of assured destruction of Soviet
 cities by building an ever increasing offensive force to overcome the Soviet ABM
 system. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, may have moved to a concept of
 indeterminate outcome deterrence. This would give the Russians an opportunity
 to act decisively in the diplomatic arena, whereas the United States would have to
 respond with much greater timidity. To be sure, any transition to a nuclear strategy
 based on indeterminate outcome deterrence will be prolonged over time. This is
 due primarily to the fact that, although the technology of defense has been advan.c-
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 ing more rapidly than the technology of offense in recent years, it takes time to
 incorporate this new defense technology into operational weapons systems. Secretary
 of Defense McNamara has estimated, for example, that it would take the United
 States seven years to develop and deploy the Nike-X into an operational ABM
 system.
 One of the great problems posed by any ballistic missile defense system is
 whether it will work. So long as deterrence operates, the whole complex can never
 be tested. It is the uncertainty as to how well a ballistic missile defense system would
 work in the future-say, in 1975-that poses the most difficult problem for decision
 making today. Even if we go to the expense of deploying such a system, we cannot
 be sure that it would be effective.
 Despite this uncertainty, however, it would be a very great gamble indeed for
 the United States not to proceed with the development and deployment of such a
 system. We cannot afford to run the risk that the Soviet Union would have uni-
 lateral possession of both offensive and defensive systems in combination, that they
 alone would have mastery of changing concepts of deterrence, and that we would
 have to contemplate the destruction of American cities without the sure ability to
 retaliate effectively. For we would be faced with uncertainty as to how well their
 ballistic missile defense system of cities would work; while they, on the other hand,
 would be confronted with no such system on our side, and they could predict with
 some certainty the damage they could inflict on undefended United States cities.
 An inevitable consequence of this would be the erosion of the American alliance
 system, as our allies all over the world lost confidence in the American nuclear
 umbrella, and perhaps eventually in the common sense and political wisdom of the
 American nation as well.
 But let us give thought to a world in which both sides are roughly in balance
 with respect to offensive and defensive weapons systems. I would suggest that this
 new world would be much more stable than the world we have lived through dur-
 ing the past ten years. For example, it would provide a measure of protection
 against psychotic or accidental launches, or against nth countries firings. In this
 latter respect, the concept of indeterminate outcome deterrence represents insurance
 against the probable failure of our policy on the nonproliferation of nuclear weap-
 ons-at least with respect to Communist China.
 It might also represent a major step in solidifying our relations with allied
 countries by making possible the sharing of defensive ballistic missile technology.
 This is very complex and costly technology. Sharing it with our allies would do
 much to improve relations with them. But we have this opportunity only so long
 as we do not lock ourselves into an irrevocable decision not to deploy an anti-
 ballistic missile defense; or, if we deploy it, to determine nevertheless to keep it to
 ourselves. Here the initiative is ours for a few years only. It is a major initiative
 that could be taken to reform and rebuild NATO, and to give that alliance new
 direction and new meaning.

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Another possible consequence of such a world of indeterminate outcomes
 might be to permit the selective transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to allies to be
 used for defense against local aggression, and thereby to give a new dimension to
 deterrence working at very low levels. Where the fear of escalation can be con-
 trolled, the use of nuclear weapons for local defense may become a much more
 realistic policy than to attempt to build up conventional forces.
 I would suggest that it is necessary for the American people to gain a better
 understanding of the rapid changes that technology is bringing about, particularly
 with respect to military defense. Unless we grasp this problem, the United States
 may lose its strategic superiority in the 1970's. We must quickly face up to the
 problem of whether to proceed with our own ABM defense at a time when the
 Soviets are already rapidly deploying theirs.

 THE FUTURE OF SOVIET CYBERNETICS
 BY JOHN J. FORD
 Summary of Remarks
 Foreknowledge of what the next quarter century holds for science and technology
 is as important in determining priorities for peace as it was 25 years ago in
 mobilizing for war. Then, the prescience of Vannevar Bush, J. B. Conant, R. C.
 Tolman, K. T. Compton, and others led to one of the most important prewar
 strategic moves made by the United States: President Roosevelt's approval on
 June 27, 1940, of the order establishing the National Defense Research Com-
 mittee. During the eighteen months prior to Pearl Harbor, this organization devised
 an unparalleled system of central laboratories for mobilizing America's scientists
 for the then imminent conflict. When the attack came on December 7, 1941, the
 NDRC was well along on a series of crucial projects: the potent explosive RDX,
 radar, the proximity fuse, incendiary bombs, and on developments which led
 eventually to Alamogordo: *
 It is to the lasting credit of that handful of American scientists who made
 their foreknowledge available to their government that they recognized not only
 the imminence of hostilities but also the rapidity with which the face of war would
 be changed by technology. They foresaw the movement of technology toward a
 turning point in the broad history of civilization at which science would be applied
 to destruction on a wholesale basis, thereby superseding warfare as it had been
 waged for thousands of years by the direct clash of hordes of men.
 The Germans, meanwhile, failed to recognize the signs of the times, and clung
 to the old idea that no decisive new weapon could be introduced in the short war
 they contemplated in 1939. Because of their existing stockpile of excellent weapons,
 they felt no need of any great organization for the development of new weapons,
 no mobilization of their vast resources of scientific personnel, no requirement to
 ensure an atmosphere of scientific freedom for wide ranging experimentation within
 the meshes of their huge military system. German academic scientists could be left
 to their peacetime researches. Even in the military laboratories, fundamental re-
 search was greatly curtailed if not entirely dropped. Basic research on radar, for
 example, was stopped on Hitler's orders in 1940, and was not renewed until 1942.
 The Germans made a belated effort after the false hope of a short war had
 gone glimmering. Professor William Osenberg, of the Technische Hochschule at
 * Following the declaration of unlimited national emergency by the President on May 27,
 1941, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 8807 on June 28, 1941, establishing the
 Office of Scientific Research and Development in the Executive Office of the President, which
 took over the contracts of the NDRC for scientific and medical research.

 Hannover, became head of a committee to review the availability of academic and
 research personnel for war problems. In January :1943 he was assigned to the
 Reichsforschungsrat, an organization similar to OSRD but long inactive. Just be-
 fore the German surrender, Osenberg complained that "Germany lost the war
 because of incomplete mobilization and utilization of scientific brains."
 'T'his capsule history of the scientific front in World War II should be recalled
 in attempting to forecast what the future holds for science and technology, and in
 determining the priorities for peace. Foreknowledge based on an awareness of "the
 signs of the times" is as critical to survival in 1966 as it was in 1940. If we are to
 profit by the wartime mistakes of Germany, we must maintain-as the Germans
 failed to do-that vital rapport between scientists and government which is the basis
 of anticipatory-adaptative responses to the patterns of profound change in the world
 about us. For those changes portend another turning point in the broad history of
 civilization at which the outcome of international political competition will be
 determined by the relative capabilities of the contestants for the application of
 science to social development. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and
 Lieutenant General James M. Gavin have discussed these portents in recent pub-
 lications.
 From the USSR come indications that the Soviets share this interpretation,
 and that, in consequence, Soviet scientists and technologists are being mobilized
 rapidly. The Soviets give a somewhat unique characterization to this new turning
 point in history, and describe it as a shift from dependence for security upon
 instruments which magnify the power of the human fist to reliance on means which
 multiply the power of the human brain. This new stage in applied rationality is said
 to imply international competition in the development of such means, and in their
 employment in a new type of conflict in which victory will go to that social system
 with the greatest proclivity toward, and most advanced techniques for, the develop-
 ment of its own and foreign societies;, and not to the contestant with a super-
 abundance of destructive power. The novelty of this strategic concept, with is strains
 of "peaceful competition," heightens its insidiousness. With a beginning unan-
 nounced by bugles or bombs, it could. go undetected to an end marked, in the
 words of T. S. Eliot, "not with a bang but with a whimper."
 One of the many signs signifying the mobilization of scientists in accordance
 with this strategy was the establishment by a small. group of Soviet scientists in
 1959 of the Cybernetics Council under the Soviet Academy of Sciences. That
 group, directed by Admiral A. I. Berg, includes 13 academicians, 30 correspond-
 ing members of the Academy, more than 200 doctors of science, and 400 candi-
 dates of science. Similarly, the number of research projects planned and supervised
 by the Cybernetics Council has risen from 170 in its 1963 program to more than
 400 tasks currently programmed.
 The goal of this cybernetics program is to provide scientific and technological
 neans for the optimal control of complex, purposive systems. "To control," in this
 context, means simply to combat: the disorder or disorganization toward which
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 large systems tend when they fail to interact appropriately with their external en-
 vironments. Such interactions involve information processes, so that as the quantity
 of "control" information increases, the disorder of the system decreases. For this
 reason, top priority within the Soviet cybernetics program is assigned to studies of
 information processes in living systems, machines, and societies, for the purpose
 of finding methods and equipment which will increase the effectiveness of human
 activity in the sphere of information processing. This sphere is taken to include
 education, management of the national economy, defense, transportation, science,
 electrical power distribution, law and government, industrial production and dis-
 tribution, and the other complex activities of human societies.
 To those in the USSR who foresee the advent of a cybernetic era, social
 change is inevitable. But the rate and direction of these transitions are subject to
 human influence. Their argument goes on to postulate that these changes will be
 evolutionary or devolutionary, progressive or regressive, developmental or atrophic,
 depending upon the degree of success achieved by any transitional society in apply-
 ing cybernetics or other media of applied rationality to engineering the organization
 of the emergent states. The task of the Cybernetics Council is to insure that a sys-
 tem of social organization will be devised by the USSR which will prove to be the
 optimal variant in this evolutionary struggle involving total social organisms, and
 not just their military arms.
 If the National Strategy Information Center convenes a conference in Decem-
 ber 1991 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, our successors at
 that time will be better able than we to evaluate whether Admiral Berg and his
 coterie perceived the "signs of the times" correctly in 1959, and if the consequent
 adaptive organizational changes were as appropriate as was the creation of the
 National Defense Research Committee in anticipation of the entry of the United
 States into World War II.

 CYBERNETICS IN THE SERVICE OF COMMUNISM
 BY RAYMOND S. SLEEPER.
 Summary of Remarks
 Colonel Raymond S. Sleeper, USAF, has command of the Foreign Technology Division,
 Air Force Systems Command.
 In Russia, cybernetics seems to offer the means to optimize the continued develop-
 ment and growth of the power of the Soviet Union, the subversive capture of free
 nations, and the establishment of worldwide educational, technological, military,
 and space superiority. But more important? cybernetics is now seen by some Soviet
 authorities as the means of facilitating the optimum (Communist) control of the
 complex system of states, peoples, and resources of the world which the Coin-
 utunists hope will result from Communist world domination.
 in practice, the Soviets appear to be classifying almost any subject that has
 to do with information and control in man, machine, and society as cybernetics.
 Cybernetic systems, as opposed to automatic devices, are capable of responding
 in a predictable, orderly manner to changes in the environment. An example of a
 crude cybernetic system is the home furnace that responds via thermostatic control
 to changes in temperature for the purpose of maintaining a reasonably constant
 temperature in the home. One of the first: complex cybernetic systems developed
 was Norbert Wiener's design of a system to link radar through a computer to a
 battery of automatic anti-aircraft guns.
 Wiener's great achievement was to synthesize existing technology and ideas
 into a basic conceptual framework that unified this technology to produce a high
 degree of control in any type of complex dynamic system. The basic elements of
 this concept are:
 (1) A well defined goal or end state to be achieved,.
 (2) Sensors to detect changes in the environment, such as temperature, veloc-
 ity, chemical reactions, learning states, and so forth.
 (3) Communications nets concerning all elements of the system to assure
 information flow.
 (4) Logic units to process the information flow according to criteria con-
 tained in the goal.
 (5) Control units that are responsive to decisions from the logic center (4),
 which adjusts system units to the desired states as information from (1),
 (2), (3), and (4) changes.
 Cybernetics, as it developed under Wiener and in the USSR, imposes a rigid
 discipline for clear thinking upon both the theorist and the practitioner. If a true

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 cybernetic approach to problem solving is adopted, the planner must first define
 his goals and the criteria for their achievement as clearly and with as little ambiguity
 as possible.
 The Thrust of Cybernetics in the Soviet System
 The thrust of cybernetics in Russia extends from the microbiological to the
 macrocosmic dimensions of man's relationship to the elements of the universe. The
 volume of Soviet literature on cybernetics is monumental. A. I. Berg, chairman of
 the Soviet Cybernetics Council, refers to over 5,000 articles in 1961 alone on "the
 problems of the application of mathematics, electronics, and cybernetics to biology
 and medicine." Since 1961, the volume of literature and research on this subject
 has continued to increase.
 Soviet cybernetics includes, in addition to biologic and physiologic control
 techniques, a broad program of research in neurology, psychology, and related
 fields, especially those areas which have the potential for technological application
 and behavior control. The USSR is planning for rapid development of automation,
 and encourages cybernetics at the highest level of government and party. Social
 adjustment to automation is planned through the preparation of students to accom-
 modate to the "cybernated society." And, according to the Soviets, the change will
 therefore .be more orderly in Russia than in any other country.
 At the machine level, the applications vary from guidance systems for missiles
 to automated power distribution centers for controlling the flow of electric power
 between widely dispersed nets so as to eliminate costly, redundant power generation.
 But it is at the socio-economic level that one sees the major innovations being
 attempted in the Soviet Union. A cybernetics center is planned for each state.
 Several are already being built, and the first one at Kiev is nearly finished. These,
 together with the Cybernetics Council in Moscow, the Moscow information storage
 and retrieval center (VINITI), the Moscow computer center, the developing na-
 tionwide unified information network, some 350 computer centers, and over 100
 institutes that are working in cybernetic science and technology, will constitute the
 physical structure of the program.
 It helps us to take a serious view of these Soviet activities when we realize
 that such large scale modeling, and similar attempts to structure society, are
 actually beginning here in the United States. San Francisco is using an operating
 mathematical model of the city in terms of its land, buildings, peoples, jobs,
 amenities, and so forth, for forward planning purposes. Other American cities are
 now developing their own models. But the Soviet scheme involves all of Russia and
 promises to involve the world.
 Probably the key to the major difference between the Soviet purpose of
 cybernetics and the purpose in the West is that the Soviets seem to be aiming at
 complete social reconstruction. It is not so much that the Soviets are already begin-
 ning to apply cybernetics to the optimum control of the entire Soviet society, but

 rather that they are aiming to reconstruct society through the widest possible appli-
 cation of cybernetics, and eventually to employ it as the principal system of Com-
 i,i.unist: control of the world. And there are indications of steady Soviet progress.
 "Soviet science is ahead in the analysis of random processes of shooting and random
 process representation; Soviet science is generally superior to U. S. science in the
 fields of detection theory, parameters, prediction and estimation, and the analysis
 of phase-keyed systems in the presence of fading; and Soviet science can be said
 to be slightly ahead of the U.S. sciences in the overall fields of cybernetics,
 logic algebra, automated theory, and pattern recognition." Cybernetics seems to
 have given the Russian leaders a new vision of the utopian future of Communist
 social progress. They now see in cybernetics (or so they think) a means to stimulate
 progress and to integrate advances in all fields of science. Again, the most funda-
 mental and overriding point is that through cybernetics the integration of scientific
 progress now enables the construction of the ideal Communist society in Russia as
 well as throughout the world.
 To reconstruct Russian society. to establish a system for the optimum control
 of Russia, and to embark upon the study? planning, and implementation of a con-
 trol system aimed at restructuring the societies of the world so that they will dovetail
 into a cybernated Communist Russia, is a fantastic task. A model of how this
 world social structure will be achieved has been developed by the Communists.
 From a Communist viewpoint the whole process of "national liberation" and
 revolution involves the restructuring of capitalistic institutions and the development
 of Communist institutions in a purposeful mode.
 The Transition of "Capitalist Societies" to "Socialist Societies"
 This restructuring of "capitalist societies" to "Socialist societies" is the cen-
 tral aim of world communism. It is the object, the content, and the substance of
 Communist activities across the world.
 There are Communist parties in some 105 natioias in the world. In certain
 countries there is more than one Communist party; but for our purposes we shall
 assume that these parties are factions, and that ultimately these factions either
 coordinate, cooperate, or are controlled by the dominant party in their struggle to
 take over the specific country. Some 16 of these 105 nations are now controlled by
 the Communists. Each of these 16 nations. is in fact ruled. by the Communist party
 therein. It is generally accepted that the world Communist movement is no longer
 monolithic, but that polycentralism and a kind of "world commonwealth of Com-
 munist nations" is evolving and expanding through subversive aggression. In spite
 of these and other, doctrinal changes, a Marxist-Leninist model exists for the stages
 of Communist penetration and takeover in a target country. The doctrine elaborates
 the following steps (called "stages" in Marxist-Leninist terminology) in the "transi-
 tion" to a Marxist-Leninist society:
 1. Step one is infiltration into the target country and the formation of a Com-
 munist party.

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 2. Step two is the infiltration of Communist party members into the target
 country's key institutions.
 3. Step three is the decision to seize power
 4. Step four is to seize power.
 5. Finally, step five is to consolidate Communist control of the nation. This
 involves the progressive elimination of all anti-Communist, uncooperative
 control and influence in the nation.
 Thus one sees the total social, economic, and cultural restructuring of a
 target country to fit the Communist model. And the Communist model appears to
 be moving toward a cybernetics model. This may lead to increased rationalization
 of Communist subversive aggression against free nations. Under a cybernetics
 scheme, the Communists need not export traditional ideology. Instead they need
 only to export "scientific social changes" which fit the cybernetic model of the
 economy and social structure of scientific Marxism-Leninism which is now being
 built in Russia.
 The Drive for Military Superiority
 The Soviets have consistently pushed for worldwide military superiority. Stalin
 supported this goal, and so did Khrushchev, on balance.
 Some top American nuclear scientists believe that Soviet nuclear weapons
 technology is at least equivalent to, if not ahead of, the United States, in some
 areas. In the area of high yield weapons, it is conceded that they have the edge.
 They have detonated a device of 60 megatons which we believe could be
 weaponized or turned into a weapon of about 100 megatons. In the area of aero-
 space weapons, we were somewhat surprised in 1948 that the Soviets copied our
 B-29's (which they called TU-4's). More surprising was that they built a significant
 number, and built them at the expense of more rapidly rejuvenating the wartorn
 civilian economy. Through the 1950's the Soviets built modern fighters in large
 numbers, and also bombers, and then moved into building and deploying ballistic
 missiles. There is no question that the American Minuteman and Polaris missiles
 remain superior to those of the Soviets, but the Russian weaponeers are not resting
 on their laurels. They are continuing to develop and deploy large numbers of new
 weapons of widely varying types.
 One of the primary strengths of the Soviet research and development and pro-
 duction programs is the use of scientific planning (cybernetics) throughout their
 weapons programs. Scientific planning, gaming theory, optimum solution of com-
 plex problems, development of block-aggregate computing systems, creation of the
 scientific basis for the synthesis of automatic control, and hundreds of similar sub-
 jects, all relevant to the most modern techniques of scientific planning and develop-
 ment of aerospace weapons systems, appear in Soviet cybernetics literature. The
 hypothesis is suggested that analysis of overall Soviet power must now take into
 account the increased efficiency of the early applications of integrated cybernetic
 systems optimized for the strengthening of Soviet military and national security.

 The Thrust in Space
 Similarly, the impact of cybernetics can be seen in the Soviet space effort.
 Soviet work in space probably started in the early 1940's with the work of
 i'silkovskii, the Soviet Goddard. In the late 1940's and early 1950's, it appears that
 the basic technologies and vertical firings of components were accomplished. In
 the late 1950's, we saw the first Sputnik and the beginning of the Soviet space
 spectaculars. There has been little direct: evidence that any of these spectaculars
 will lead directly to Soviet military space capabilities, but there have been repeated
 Soviet references to the military uses of space.
 In the United States, we argue variously that space offensive nuclear delivery
 forces are less efficient than ICBM's, less accurate, and less credible. But when the
 Soviets are dedicated to aggressive political objectives on a world scale, the posses-
 sion of space military offensive forces may appear very useful for purposes of
 prestige, terror, persuasion, coercion, pressure, psychological warfare, and demoral-
 ization. The sight and sound of Soviet military orbital, forces in the free skies of
 the world day and night, and Communist satellite TV and propaganda tuned into
 Free World sets around the world-all in the service of' Soviet goals of worldwide
 Communist domination, would not be attractive to contemplate.
 Such major steps in space could not be taken except for the progress that the
 Soviets are seeking through cybernetics. 'This has been recognized by Soviet sci-
 entists and has been openly stated by several of them. A description of the impact
 of Soviet cybernetics on their space program is included in Cybernetics and the
 Cosmos by V. Denisov, published in. 1962. Denisov describes the working of the
 cosmic ship in detail, and then projects developments into the future, saying: "It
 can be that the foot of man will not take the first step on other planets, . . . but
 the foot of a cybernetic automaton may." He then goes on to extend man's influ-
 ence into the cosmos through travel and communications, basing his predictions on
 progress in cybernetics, as well as in astronautics and related sciences.
 Summary
 There is not much question that cybernetics is seen by the Soviet elite, not
 only as the path to Communist utopia, but also as the road to development of a
 worldwide system of Socialist states under Communist control. This view is reflected
 even by the American Communist party: "Is there an inner compulsion in tech-
 nological development which will transform the private: appropriation of profit in
 America and the immense, unprecedented political power it brings, into an inno-
 cent surplus managed for the whole of society by the same small top group wearing
 different hats? ... No . . . Once the profit motive is no longer a sacred absolute,
 the machines can be controlled, and, especially in the centralized society of today,
 cybernation can be developed and applied at a rate and in a manner that is in the
 interest of society as a whole ... and this will come .... only when the American
 people make a daily struggle in a progressive direction" towards communism,.

 If we wish to follow events in Soviet Russia reasonably intelligently, and
 developments in worldwide communism as well, we should begin to view them in
 terms of the changes wrought by the massive cybernation program in Russia and
 in the worldwide Communist movement. Moreover, if cybernation promises such a
 "paradise" for Socialist countries, and makes possible, in effect, a technological
 penetration of free nations, it behooves us to define the parameters of the possible
 impact, and the promise and direction of national and international automation in
 free societies as a counter. There is no doubt at all that American computer tech-
 nology, program theory and applications, and automation lead the world. But even
 as this is recognized, we should also take note of the proliferation of computers, of
 computer languages, and of computer centers in the United States. We have become
 truly an electronic Towel of Babel. In Russia, by contrast, the computer centers,
 languages, and networks are planned and programmed to optimize control of the
 entire country. Does this lead to an efficiency of resource utilization that enables
 the Soviets, with a gross national product of $303 billion compared to $664 billion
 for the United States in 1965, to challenge us for world leadership and military
 superiority? Surely the redundancy, flexibility, and free choice in the American
 system are much more attractive to us. But is it too wasteful of resources? And is
 this American redundancy and flexibility optimized to meet aggressive, purposeful,
 international competition? Will widespread redundancy, flexibility, and choice invite
 penetration and restriction by a centrally controlled, integrated, and optimized
 system, a system optimized for the stated, announced purpose of world domination?
 These are interesting questions that only time and intensive analysis will an-
 swer. Surely most Americans, if given the choice, will vote for redundancy, flexibil-
 ity, and optimization of private opportunity as opposed to centralized, imposed,
 optimized control. However, the parameters of redundancy, flexibility, control,
 optimization, purposefulness, and private opportunity may have to be subjected to
 the crucible of public discussion and definition in the light of national interests
 before we have a full understanding of both the benefits and penalties of the promise
 of cybernetics. Nor can we begin to discuss and understand the national and inter-
 national potential of cybernetics unless we devote adequate effort to the job. This
 we are not now doing, at least not at a level of effort that is competitive with the
 Soviets.
 The level of effort and the progress made in Russia are a definite technological
 threat to the United States, because the multi-discipline attack taken by the Soviets
 on major problems has no counterpart in this country; and the broad, intensive
 effort of the Russians simply must produce, in due course, significant breakthroughs
 in sociological, economic, governmental, and military areas that we must be pre-
 pared to meet. This challenge is, therefore, a challenge to military superiority, to
 social control, to economic and industrial advance, and to world power.
 Unless we Americans as a people understand these momentous trends, we
 may not have much choice. The system could be imposed upon us by a centralized,
 cybernated, world command and control center whose central cortex turns out to
 be located in Moscow.

 SOME REFLECTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
 BY HARRY D. GIDEoNSE
 Summary of Remarks
 Dr. Harry D. Gideonse is Chancellor of the New School for Social Research.
 What does the term cybernetics mean? This is a legitimate question, especially
 since the Russians use it in a somewhat different context than we do.
 The Russians feel a need, when dealing with a new thought or concept which
 is deviant from the dominant intellectual climate, that is, from the currently ac-
 cepted interpretation of dialectical materialism, to dress it up in such a way as to
 make it appear compatible with the dominant ideology. Fortunately, we do not
 have to do this in the United States. If a Harvard professor of physics wants to try
 out an idea which has not been explored by a colleague at Yale or Columbia, he
 can do so without reference to anybody. He does not have to wait until his idea is
 accepted as congruent with the prevailing party line before he is allowed to pursue
 his work. But such is not the case in the Soviet Union. Let me recall for you that
 when the Russians began to work seriously (and somewhat belatedly) on the
 physics of atomic energy, they had to confront some real conflicts between their
 research and the prevailing dogmas of dialectical materialism. For a number of
 years, some of the leading Russian. physicists had their necks dangerously far out,
 simply because the philosophers of the official ideology disapproved of Einstein's
 physics. It took years of struggle before this problem was worked out through the
 development of some aesopian verbal formulas that would permit the physicists to
 go forward with their work even while:, the party line seemed to disapprove of
 Einstein's physics.
 In a similar way, when the Soviet regime began to place heavy emphasis on
 tdectronics and the use of computers in the implementation of Soviet planning,
 there were great ructions within the Soviet intellectual community. Much literature
 was devoted to the question. of whether or not this emphasis was compatible with
 the official ideology. Eventually a solution had to be worked out on the basis of
 some obscure passage in a pamphlet by Lenin which seemed to justify so much
 work on electronics and computers. Then, after the problem had been resolved
 after literally years of controversy (only part of which is apparent in the printed
 literature), the Russians proceeded to create a myth around the word cybernetics
 which is quite unlike the more sober concept which that term implies in the Amer-
 ican scientific community. To put it briefly, in the Soviet Union the concept of
 cybernetics seems to suggest that the solution of economic and social problems,
 with respect to which we would consider cybernetics simply as a useful tool, would
 be generated within the social and material process itself. There is an implication
 here that somehow or other cybernetics plays a role in the Soviet Union that it does
 not play in the American scientific community.

 We have a much more limited notion of this concept. In the American setting,
 cybernetics is simply the science and the scientific reasoning that governs the
 construction and use of computers. In this country, the term is not used in the more
 mystical sense that the Russians seem to imply.
 But this is not to minimize the importance or complexity of cybernetics in
 the United States. As for complexity, we should remind ourselves at once, for
 example, that the important thing about a computer is what is put into it. Who
 programs the computer? It should be remembered that when a computer is pro-
 grammed, one does not simply put all available data, all the vast information
 explosion of contemporary science, into the computer. The result would be simply
 chaotic. One must have a sophisticated selective principle in the back of his head,
 a yardstick which indicates what is vital, what is merely significant, and what is
 irrelevant. For the validity of what comes out of a computer depends entirely upon
 the validity of what goes into it. Among computer people, there is a stale pun that
 nevertheless makes this point most effectively. It is expressed in the formula GI =
 GO. GI stands for garbage in, and GO for garbage out; or, in other words, garbage
 in results in garbage out. There is a great reality here which must be kept in mind
 when evaluating the relevance of cybernetics to American life.

 MILITARY TECHNOLOGY AND S(O)CIAL CHANGE
 BY EDWARD L. KATZENBACH
 Summary of Remarks
 Dr. Edward L. Katzenbach is Vice President and General Manager of the Education
 Division, Raytheon Company.
 `The technology of war has always been closely related to the organization of society
 and its value system. But whether the nature of society has determined military
 organization, or military necessity our social values, is ,a moot question. Suffice to
 say that. the relationship between the military and society was well recognized by
 historians of ancient times. But as war has become more important to society, as
 has certainly been true of the past century, historians have tended to ignore this
 relationship. In a sense, they have put war in a parenthesis in time with "causes"
 at one end and "results" at the other. As a result, not enough thought has been
 given to the relationship between military technology and social change. Perhaps
 some illustrations, through time, will indicate the nature of my view of the problem.
 The castle was the first technologically sound defensive unit. Was medieval
 society organized around this technology? Or was it the organization of society
 which caused the castle to be built? The coming of gunpowder destroyed the castle
 as a viable military unit. Science and the study of ballistics and engineering then
 made the town the lowest common denominator as an element in defense. More-
 over, gunpowder changed military virtues. Bravery, heroism, and the like remained
 as qualities of leadership; but brains, in the form of both engineering skills and
 organization, were added to the list of military necessities. What effect, then, did
 military technology have on the rise of a middle class, on new forms of govern-
 ment, new habits of thought?
 Civil-military technology, a good road system, and later the railroad made the
 nation the viable unit of defense, and steam transport over the seas made it possible
 for wars to be much larger in geographic scope, and to be fought by broad alliance
 systems. Again, human organization learned to conform to the demands of military
 technology. And so did human value systems. Are not both nationalism and inter-
 nationalism largely the by-product of changes in military technology?
 Barbed wire and the machine gun brought stalemate to the Western Front in
 World War 1. But the organization of industry and people behind the lines brought
 a whole new look to national organization. Governments became larger and man's
 view of government changed. So, finally, did his view of. war. World War II, fought
 as it was in four dimensions--on and under the sea, on the surface of the earth and
 over it---again changed social values and, indeed, all of society. Almost for the first
 time, men, women, and children were considered legitimate targets for the new
 weapons of war.

 I make these points because until this moment in time military technology has
 been a great moving force in society. But now technology has reached an impasse.
 It is manpower, with only limited technology, that is fighting the wars of today's
 world, in Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam. Time, therefore, has a new value in war
 that is closely related to human patience. In other words, it is the human will which
 today is of overriding importance in war. There is a paradox here. Technology no
 longer limits war. People do, and for the first time in history.
 There is another paradox, however, which derives from the first one. It is that
 in a democracy, we have always believed that what we do best is to arrive at an
 agreed consensus. This we do, we believe, because of the freedom of information
 and opinion that characterizes our society. But there has never been more informa-
 tion available than on the issue of Vietnam, and yet on no war since the American
 Revolution has there been less consensus.
 The first essential to a forward strategy is, therefore, to resurrect a sense of
 respect for the role of consensus in democracy. This is our most precious heritage.
 The new role of protest in our society can destroy it. In a time when man's will is
 in fact man's destiny, surely a respect for consensus is the first law of survival.

 THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FREE
 LABOR DEVELOPMENT
 BY WILLIAM C. DOHERTY, JR.
 Summary of Remarks
 Mr. William C. Doherty, Jr., is Administrator of the American Institute for Free Labor
 Development.
 The labor movement in Latin America is one of the most important catalytic
 agents in that dynamic continent. But it is also one of the most vulnerable to totali-
 tarian influences. The workers have new expectations and they are determined to
 fulfill them. They are seeking change and determined to get it. The primary question
 is, will they choose the chaos of violent revolution or the course of peaceful com-
 petition? The free, democratic labor movemnt in Latin America must be strength-
 ened and expanded so that it can compete both with the established interests of
 society, and with the forces of totalitarianism which threaten to control and manipu-
 late the power of labor.
 The democratic labor unions of Latin America have three basic needs: to
 increase union participation in economic planning; to strengthen union resistance
 to totalitarian influences; and to bolster union independence from government,
 political parties, and from industry.
 To help the labor sector attain these goals, the American Institute for Free
 Labor Development has been developed as a unique organization which reflects the
 pluralism of American society. Initiative for the foundation of AIFLD in 1962
 came from the American labor movement, and today prominent labor leaders
 serve on the Board of Directors. Each year since 1962, the AFL-CIO has made a
 substantial contribution to help support AIFLD. In addition, more than 60 en-
 lightened business firms make yearly contributions. And AIFLD's overall effort is
 increased far beyond what the private sector can support by means of United States
 government funds under the Alliance for Progress. Finally, many distinguished
 Latin American leaders serve on the Board of Directors, men such as Oscar Gale
 of Honduras, Gonzalez Navarro of Venezuela, and others.
 AIFLD has two main fields of activities: trade union education; and social
 projects such as housing, workers' banks, campesino service centers, small "impact
 projects," and community services. These extend to every Latin American country
 and to the English-speaking Caribbean nations as well. The only countries outside
 the program are Cuba, Haiti, and Paraguay.
 In AIFLD's educational programs, more than 50,000 trade unionists have
 participated in one or more levels of classes since June 1962. These programs
 begin with basic courses on trade unionism, and advance to intensive seminars on
 techniques of union organization and collective bargaining. Where possible, the best

 students are brought to the most advanced level of training, the Front Royal School
 of Virginia, where they are given instruction in teaching methods, social project
 design and implementation, and leadership development. A new program in labor
 economics has recently been started in cooperation with a university consortium in
 New Orleans. There the students are given intensive training for an academic year
 in order to enable them to assist their unions to participate in national economic
 planning.
 In its social projects work, AIFLD seeks to give those unions which have
 already been strengthened through training the means to fill the tangible needs of
 their members. One of the most critical needs is low cost housing and savings
 institutions to serve the worker. AIFLD has helped to build over 3,400 housing
 units in five countries, and has established the first workers' housing bank in Latin
 America, called ASINCOOP. Opened in 1964, the bank now has more than
 $1,256,000 in workers' savings. Feasibility studies have been completed for similar
 banks in other countries.
 AIFLD feels that agricultural workers, small tenants, and sharecroppers are
 among the most neglected elements of Latin American society. These are the people
 to whom the Alliance for Progress is unfortunately mere rhetoric, not reality. For
 the vast majority, integral land reform, necessary for both the economic and
 political health of their countries, is still unheard of.
 The AIFLD program for campesinos in Northeast Brazil is the most extensive
 of all our rural programs. It was set up in response to one of the most explosive
 situations in the hemisphere. In cooperation with the Federation of Rural Trade
 Unions, the Agency for International Development, a Catholic priest (Padre
 Crespo), and other agencies, AIFLD developed a plan for a series of campesino
 service centers. These centers would provide focal points for trade union activity,
 and also a measure of vocational and literacy education and medical services. Thus
 far, three service centers have been built and are in service in the state of Pernam-
 buco. Classes in cooperatives, manual arts for men and women, home economics,
 and agricultural improvement have begun. These centers have become tangible
 evidence to the workers of the region of the concern of the North American labor
 movement for their plight. Even more importantly, they symbolize the possibilities
 for continued union growth in this area.
 AIFLD is a unique organization that combines the talents and resources of
 the American labor movement with those of business and government, and then
 brings them to bear on one of the most critical problems of this hemisphere, namely,
 to assist the labor movement in Latin America to play a leadership role in social
 change, and to direct this dynamic process toward the goals of freedom and
 democracy.

 AMERICA'S THIRD FORCE
 BY RICHARD C. CORNUELLE
 Summary co f Remarks
 Mr. Richard C. Cornuelle is Executive Vice President for Program Development, National
 Association of Manufacturers.
 The expanding role of the federal government in almost every aspect of American
 life is a familiar but alarming, phenomenon. While public uneasiness over the grow-
 ing role of government is increasing rapidly, many American consider this develop-
 ment to be both inevitable and uncontrollable. It is, in short, something we must
 learn to live with.
 I do not believe this is so. For many decades, this country managed success-
 fully to contain big government. We did so because we had found another way to
 deal with many of our public problems. In his perceptive volume Democracy in
 America, Alexis de Tocqueville long ago commented approvingly on this country's
 governmental institutions, which afforded the citizen a :maximum degree of political
 participation; and on American private enterprise, whiich gave the widest possible
 scope to private initiative. But the really unique aspect of American life was a
 third sector of society, neither governmental nor commercial, which he believed
 would enable the United States to accomplish, almost for the first time in human
 history, a society that was at once free, prosperous, and humane. This force was
 the propensity of Americans to work together in volunteer organizations for the
 accomplishment of public purposes. Today, de Tocqueville's third force has taken
 on enormous dimensions. Almost a million organized nonprofit activities now func-
 tion in this country, and contributions toward them approximate $20 billion a year.
 Perhaps the largest element in this third force is the 320,000 churches of our coun-
 try; but it also includes countless private foundations, fraternal and service organ-
 izations, funds, special crusades, and hospitals and nursing homes.
 But the creative power of this tremendous third force now seems in danger
 despite its truly impressive size and its immensely rich complexity. Here, too, the
 role of government is rapidly increasing. At the present time, government operates
 and finances at least 90 percent of all organized welfare activities. By the year
 2000, higher education, too, will be almost completely the responsibility of gov-
 ernment. The evidence seems to suggest that we are losing confidence in the crea-
 tive value of the American experience that de Tocqueville praised so highly. It
 seems obsolete, relevant only to a more simple period of our history. We have
 come to act as if only the government can deal today with such overwhelming
 contemporary problems as crime, urban life, and transportation.
 But I would argue the opposite point of view. I would urge that private, non-
 governmental organizations can deal with many of the problems confronting con-
 temporary society more effectively than government ever will. The trouble is that

 they have grown old-fashioned, even antiquated. Their techniques and methods
 are a generation old. They can never realize their enormous potential unless they
 drastically modernize their operating procedures.
 Happily, I think we are beginning to see a renaissance in this respect. Let me
 cite some illuminating examples. Take, for instance, the relatively small but intract-
 able problem of making loans to college students who do not meet conventional
 credit requirements. An independent organization, the United Student Aid Funds,
 has recently been organized to deal with this problem, and has been so successful
 that it operates today in all fifty states through 8,000 banks. Or again, there is a
 private group in Indianapolis that has taken bold initiatives to deal with the prob-
 lem of urban redevelopment. Financed by loans from Indianapolis banks to meet
 the cost of land and materials, it employs the techniques of the prefabricated hous-
 ing industry as one way of dealing with the problem. Groups of slum dwellers are
 organized into teams of 12, given training in building, and then put to constructing
 prefabricated houses in slum areas. The amazing thing is that it works. Finally, the
 National Association of Manufacturers has organized a highly successful program
 to cope with hard core unemployment, especially through the re-education of school
 dropouts and even incorrigible delinquents. The program has been so successful
 that NAM hopes to encourage its imitation all across the country.
 These are only a few examples of private organizations turning their vast
 potential to the solution of contemporary social problems. And the potential is
 truly unlimited. If the enormous, and still largely untapped, reservoir of the Amer-
 ican spirit for free cooperation in private undertakings of all kinds could only be
 set free, there is almost no limit to what could be accomplished.
 Indeed, I would make a prophecy in this respect. The first third of the twentieth
 century was a period during which the commercial sector of American society took
 on its great strength and productive capacity. But the business community could
 not by itself accomplish the realization of the American dream. During the second
 third of the century, we resorted to government action for the solution of social
 problems, only to realize that this was no all-embracing panacea. I believe that the
 last third of our century may be marked by the renaissance of the third force in
 American life and its astounding capacity for problem solving through voluntary
 cooperation. Once this begins to happen, we may yet bring into being the humane
 society which de Tocqueville foresaw and which all Americans still aspire to.

 APPENDIX
 Editor's Note
 Following are summaries of two lectures prepared for the National Strategy Semi-
 nars, 1967, which were co-sponsored by the National Strategy Information Center,
 Inc., at Town Hall, New York City, in winter and spring of this year. The subjects
 of these lectures seemed so relevant to the discussions at The First Interprofessional
 Forum on Priorities For Peace that the two synopses are included here as being of
 interest to participants in the Forum. Descriptive material concerning the Seminars
 was distributed to all participants at the Forum, and it was indicated that the
 Seminars would be, in effect, a continuation of the Forum itself.
 VIETNAM: THE CONTINUING FIG: iT FOR FREEDOM
 BY FRANK N. TRAGER
 Summary ca f Remarks
 Dr. Frank N. Trager is Professor of International Affairs at New York University.
 While Southeast Asian nationalist movements, in no small measure stimulated by
 indigenous cultural factors (such as Buddhism, Islam, and Confusianism), antedate
 World War I, they were also influenced by Western education, by variants of Marx-
 ist ideology and by the collapse of Western rule with. the advent of the Japanese
 occupation of the region during World War II. Thus, anti-colonialism, nationalism
 and the desire for economic and technical modernization have been and are key
 factors in the area. However, the intensity of various nationalisms, the differences
 in historical background, and the diversity of ethnic, linguistic, and religio-cultural
 factors have until recently worked against greater regional unity.
 Every one of Southeast Asia's states has been and is still today the victim and
 the target of Communist insurrections inspired and aided by Moscow, Peking, or
 both. Whether the Southeast Asian state has sought its security in neutralism or
 alliance, in socialism or capitalism, whether its government has tried to be friendly
 to all blocs or behaved with due caution :in the United Nations, it has suffered since
 independence from Communist attempts at coups, revolts, insurrection, and always
 infiltration and subversion. Vietnam today is the most dramatic and tragic example
 of this protracted warfare.
 In the mid-1920's there emerged in Vietnam two fundamental, partly under-
 ground revolutionary tendencies which under one Vietnamese name or another oc-
 casionally united but more often contested against each. other for leadership against
 the French. These two tendencies are today symbolized by the Communist victors
 in the North (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam--DRVN) and the Nationalist
 victors in the South (the anti-Communist Republic of Vietnam).
 The leader of the Communists, from the time their party was organized in
 Hong Kong in 1930 and admitted to the Comintern. in 1931, has been Ho Chi
 Minh. During World War II, French Indochina remained under the control of

 Vichy and made its "peace" with Japan. During this period Ho Chi Minh offered
 to supply "intelligence" and to harass the Japanese.
 The United States, the Chinese Nationalists, and the allies generally accepted
 his offer and supplied his forces. It was this war experience which enabled Ho Chi
 Minh to seize the leadership of the anti-Vichy French, anti-Japanese forces, and
 to proclaim on September 2, 1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
 By this time the Free French under de Gaulle were on their way back to
 "French Indochina." In the years 1945-46, Communists and Nationalists fought
 alongside of each other against the returning French. Only when the Nationalists
 in the North recognized the spuriousness of the Communist-led Vietminth "united
 front" did they then break with Ho and his Communist-controlled organization.
 But then it was too late. Eight years of warfare followed. The Communists against
 the French; the Nationalists against the French; and the French against both.
 Toward the end of this disaster the Paris government, heading toward the
 1954 Geneva Conference, signed or initialed treaties of independence with the
 kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, and the State of Vietnam. But between March and
 September 1946-before the shooting began-France had already recognized the
 DRVN as a state "within the French Union." Obviously, therefore, there were now
 two states in the territory of Vietnam, with no fixed boundary between them; and
 both of them were present at the 1954 Geneva Conference.
 That conference settled nothing, except the withdrawal of France from Viet-
 nam. The Geneva Declaration, which called for elections "within two years" (Arti-
 cle 7), was signed by no country at Geneva. The United States issued its own
 declaration in support of the "statement" of the State of Vietnam and its willingness
 to accept the end of hostilities. The State of Vietnam in its statement opposed the
 terms of the Declaration and called then for free elections, supervised by an inter-
 national body in a non-partitioned country.
 But the country was partitioned by terms of the cease-fire signed by the French
 and the Communist North. France, the defeated power, forced to withdraw from
 North and South Vietnam, yet agreed to terms with Hanoi which, except for its
 own withdrawal, it would not be able to guarantee or fulfill. South Vietnam accepted
 the end of hostilities and to abide by the terms of the cease-fire provided there was
 to be in fact a genuine cease-fire between the Communist North and the Nationalist
 South.
 This never occurred. Warfare began once again during the winter of 1954-55.
 Initiated by the Communists, it has continued ever since. It started below the mili-
 tary level of direct confrontation. It took shape as assassination and terror, with
 external assistance to the rebels and guerrilla-type action. It mounted as the major
 Communists powers, Russia and China, gave support and material aide to Hanoi;
 and Hanoi in turn has guided, directed, controlled, supplied, and led the war against
 Saigon.
 In 1955 the United States decided to aid the Republic of Vietnam. Presidents
 Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson continued this policy. The Congress each year

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 has passed appropriations in support of this policy. The Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization, created by the Manila Conference of :1954, calls for and validates
 such support against Communist aggression, subversion, and infiltration.
 The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of August 1964 reaffirms this policy-and it
 was overwhelmingly re-endorsed a second time when it legitimate but ill-conceived
 effort was made by Senators Fulbright and Morse to withdraw our commitment. And
 since February 1965, the United States and South Vietnamese forces have mounted
 a campaign to stop the enemy on his soil. (For ten years he had enjoyed the unique
 luxury of striking but not being struck.) The 1966 Manila Conference, bringing
 together the seven allies in 'Vietnam who have forces there, supported this policy.
 However much the Communist adversary has zigged and zagged in Peking and
 Moscow recently, he still presents--in one form or another--the major threat to
 the continuity of independence for any of the still free Southeast Asian states. There
 is no genuine detente with Moscow; there has been ri,one for the past 49 years of
 its regime. Communist China, if anything, is more verbally belligerent, though so
 sorely beset by its own political contest for Communist Party power that it is less
 effective as a supporter of Hanoi.
 To blunt this threat to the free Asian nations, we are waging undeclared war in
 Vietnam. United States post-World War II policy in Asia was reshaped in the heat
 of crisis following the Communist 1949 victory in China and the outbreak in June
 1950 of the Korean War. In the latter, the United Nations determined that Com-
 munist China was an aggressor state. The system of bilateral and collective security
 and defense treaties begun in 1951 with Japan and culminating with SEATO in
 1954, together with aid and related aggreements with every state in free Asia, and
 with United States military forces and bases under the United States Pacific Com-
 mand, provide the framework of United States security policy in Asia in general,
 and toward the Republic of Vietnam in particular.
 Since 1950 there has been little doubt that the United States has resolved to
 maintain a position of strength and interest in Asia. We sought to create and insure
 it defensive shield of anti-Communist power which would guard against further
 large-scale overt Communist aggression. The 1966 Manila Conference pointed up
 the fact that, in addition to the United States forces in Vietnam, our allies there are
 making increasingly important contributions: the Koreans with 40,000 troops; the
 Australians, 4,500; New Zealanders, 1,200; the Filipinos, 2,000; the Thais, un-
 counted but large scale support, including provision for the new B-52 bomber bases.
 On October 23, 1964, former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies of Australia
 pointed out that the Phillipines, Thailand, Britain, Canada, Malaysia, India, Re-
 public of Korea, Iran, Republic of China, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan,
 Israel, Tunisia, Turkey, and the Netherlands were giving aid of some kind to South
 Vietnam. Since then, some 13 additional nations, making 31 in all, have responded
 to the call for assistance from Saigon. Not all those giving aid have endorsed United
 States and allied policy in Vietnam, but none has withdrawn its aid since the shift
 in strategy and tactics which began in earnest on February 7, 1965. Interestingly,

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 these facts of international cooperation in and for Vietnam are rarely if ever noticed
 by the American press.
 It is this mutuality of interest which provides the basis for at least two im-
 mediate and two long range propositions. The immediate ones are:
 1.  The risks of upward escalation against the Communist North are real
 but acceptable, provided the object is confined to the defense and security
 of the Republic of Vietnam,
 2.  South Vietnam must continue to receive military and other aid until
 it can restore political and economic stability and viability to its life as a
 small, responsible sovereign nation. Neither the "essentials" nor the "speci-
 fics" of Geneva 1954, nor the neutralization and coalition government
 policies applied to Laos in Geneva in 1962, offer positive guides to the
 future security of South Vietnam. Its land and sea borders must be made
 secure and guaranteed-this is the subject for a cease fire and negotiated
 treaty or other, ad hoc arrangement-while its friends and allies help a
 legitimate nationalist government establish and maintain domestic peace,
 stability and improvement of living conditions.
 Successful outcomes to these two propositions will probably have an early and
 salutary effect on the policies of the states of Southeast Asia. Our friends in Asia
 will know that we are standing firm against the contemporary form of warfare at
 the lower end of the spectrum-today the hallmark of Communist aggression-the
 so-called "wars of national liberation" which are neither "national" nor liberating.
 The long range propositions stemming from the active programs in Vietnam
 1.  They can nurture the growth of genuine Asian regionalism. With aid
 from the Free World, bilaterally and multilaterally, such regional coopera-
 tion can then sponsor a massive free Asian development program compar-
 able to the Marshall Plan. The current Mekong Basin program, to whose
 support President Johnson pledged $1 billion when peace comes, is an
 example of what can and should be done.
 2.  The resultant security, improvement in the conditions of living and,
 hopefully, the encouragement and spread of representative institutions of
 government will be the best counter-defense to the enemy's strategy and
 tactics, including his "wars of national liberation." These will serve to deny
 him his target: the Himalayan rimlands, the Irrawaddy and Mekong val-
 leys, and the mainland Southeast Asian rice bowl.
 This represents the beginnings of a policy for Southeast Asia. It is in effect a
 determined two-pronged policy of containment, military and socio-economic, ap-
 plied successfully in Europe and now, belatedly, in Southeast Asia, under the vigor-
 ous leadership of President Johnson. It is based on the unconditional recognition
 that the Communist adversary still presents-in the form or another-the major
 threat to the continuity of independence for any of the still free Southeast Asian
 states. Prudence, as well as self-interest-and, above all, belief in the value of the
 ever continuing fight for freedom-justify this policy.

 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF SPACE ACTIVITIES
 BY CHARLES S. SHELDON II
 Summary of Remarks
 Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II is Acting Chief of the Science Policy Research Division, Legis-
 lative Reference Service, Library of Congress.
 The Space Age is an important new factor of national strategic concern, not
 just a side show which from time to time takes the headlines. Although space flight
 first burst upon the public scene with the flight of Sputnik in October 1957, its
 beginnings go back many centuries in the common heritage of all nations. For
 space flight is built upon almost all other scientific and technical knowledge: from
 an awareness of the sizes and distances of heavenly bodies; to the laws of motion,
 gravity, action and reaction; chemistry; materials and their manufacture; guidance,
 computation, and communications science.
 The Soviet application of this knowledge brought a critical reexamination of
 the relative pace of technical progress in different parts of the world, the state of
 education, and assumptions about relative military strength. There was much con-
 fusion; and shifts of world opinion, even if inaccurate, were consequences to be
 considered in making strategic assessments.
 Effects of Space
 The United States space program takes about:. one percent of our gross
 national product, ten percent of our scientific and engineering talent, and is a third
 of all Government-funded research and development. Over a million jobs are
 provided, and such areas as southern California and the Gulf crescent are highly
 dependent upon this economic activity.
 Subcontracts are spread all over the country, and hundreds of colleges are
 affected. NASA alone is funding graduate training to the extent of providing 1,000
 new Ph.D.'s a year, without requiring these students to work for the agency, and
 thereby replenishing in numbers the complete amount. of advanced degree holders
 taken by the program from the national stockpile.
 The space program is not only replenishing our storehouse of basic scientific
 knowledge, but is rapidly being translated into practical applications which pay a
 direct dividend in a higher GNP for the nation. For example, only communications
 satellites offer us an easy prospect for meeting the swelling demand for over-ocean
 communications channels, and soon may be used as a more economical way to
 distribute TV programs even domestically. A five-day accurate forecast of the
 weather would bring estimated annual savings to the United States economy of over
 $5 billion. Satellites are an essential element to such accurate prediction, and may
 later play a role in even more significant weather modification.

 Every month is disclosing new possibilities for natural resource discovery,
 mapping, and management from space. A recent study of all these potential applica-
 tions suggests annual savings to our economy within fifteen years of $38 billion.
 The international savings could be even greater, although the policy questions of
 space applications may prove exceedingly complex when it comes to sharing costs,
 benefits, and controls.
 Some studies suggest that the indirect spinoffs of space activity, in terms of
 the growth of our technical and industrial capabilities, will be even more important
 to us than the direct applications. But few existing statistical series are now capable
 of measuring these changes in a cause-and-effect sense. Typical of such new spin-
 offs is the attention being paid to aerospace industry systems techniques for solving
 a host of earthbound problems such as pollution, crime, data management, and
 transportation.
 Space technology is already an important direct military factor, not in the
 aggressive sense, but in its provision of a host of supporting services linked to com-
 munications, weather reporting, navigation, and early warning. For the future,
 inspection systems using space methods, whether national or international, may be
 further forces for stabilization of the world military situation, to the advantage of
 both ourselves and other powers.
 International Competition
 Although our space program is important to us on its own merits, we cannot
 help but be aware that the Soviet Union also has a large program, surprisingly
 similar to ours in scope and size. Through February 28, 1967, we had orbited or
 sent to the Moon and planets 471 payloads. The Soviet Union had done the same
 with 224. However, the Soviet Union has held a definite lead in weight of payload,
 just as we hold the lead in number of spacecraft. Both countries have had space
 failures, too, although now the success rate is better than 90 percent. There is not
 much difference between the two countries in this respect, as they use the same
 world technology.
 Two thirds of American launches are for the Department of Defense; but this
 obscures the dominant role of NASA, the civilian agency, in our total space effort.
 Our program is dedicated by law and by action to peaceful ends, including preser-
 vation of the peace. The Soviet program also claims to be entirely peaceful, but
 they less readily admit the obvious fact of a heavy military flavor to what they do.
 A better appreciation of the two major programs is provided by a review of their
 major elements.
 The Russians got off to an early start in flying scientific missions. These have
 ranged from spectaculars like the orbiting geophysical laboratory in 1958 and the
 more recent Proton shots carrying 27,000 pounds of cosmic ray experiment payload,
 to 32 Kosmos-class payloads which receive a minimum of publicity and are equiva-
 lent to the 33 NASA Explorers. The Russians have not neglected science, and they

 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 publish many findings; but probably they do not do quite as well as NASA across
 the whole spectrum of such interest.
 ]Both countries have similar sized programs for unmanned exploration of the
 Moon, and both have had many failures. Our first 13 lunar attempts did not
 succeed, but since then we have had brilliant successes with 'Ranger, Surveyor, and
 Lunar Orbiter. The Soviet Union failure record is not all in the public domain. But
 after their success in taking pictures of the far side of the Moon in 1959, there were
 nothing but failures until Luna 9 soft ;landed in 1966; and since then four other
 shots have also been successes. A measure of the difficulty of comparison is the
 following. We announced that Surveyor would land on the Moon in 1963. It did
 not fly until 1966, when its first attempt was a stunning success, returning 11,500
 pictures. The Russians started soft landing attempts in 1963, but every one failed
 until 1966, when they beat us to a soft landing. Their ship returned only 27 pictures,
 and we are left with a debate as to whether essentially these few panoramic views
 did the same job as our thousands,,, in terms of the most fundamental questions of
 judging the nature of the surface.
 The Soviet unmanned interplanetary effort has been far greater. They made
 attempts to Mars and Venus at every "window" launch opportunity from 1960 to
 1966, and even their 1960 payload weight will not be surpassed by this country
 before 1973. But not a single one of the 17 flights returned any planetary data. We
 made only four launch attempts, and a Mariner returned data from Venus and
 another Mariner pictures and data from Mars. These were astounding successes,
 but detractors are not sure what new facts they proved. So how does one strike a
 balance between the two countries in this field? Probably only in an arbitrary way.
 The United States has had a clear lead in weather reporting, communications,
 :.ind navigation from space. Now the Soviet Union has altered its priorities and has
 Programs in all three fields, but still. is not up to our level of performance, particu-
 larly with respect to electronic reliability. Each of their programs does have some
 special advantages over ours, while being weaker in other respects.
 The United States rarely comments officially any more on its military support
 flights, although the satellites concerned are hardly different from civilian ones
 except in terms of the customer using the data. The Soviet Union does not admit
 to any military flights. But 65 heavy Kosmos satellites in the better-than-10,000-
 pound class fly low circular orbits from which they are usually recalled after eight
 days. It is hard to find any plausible mission other than observation, and this sus-
 picion is confirmed by private remarks made by former Premier Khrushchev to a
 few Westerners. One can argue that a greater awareness of what is going on is a
 step toward stability, and will discourage rash actions which might lead to war.
 Surprises and miscalculations are harder. Further, we may be pointing toward a
 day of open skies, since we now have many years of: acceptance of overflight in
 space which can hardly be confused. with. the legal problems surrounding air flight.
 The real worry of people about the military use of space is the question of
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300710006-8
 orbiting weapons of mass destruction. The major powers have pledged not to do
 so, and such agreement was easy to reach mostly because majority opinion today
 discounts the significance of such systems. Nuclear weapons in silos or in sub-
 marines are far easier to maintain and control, and can be pointed to more targets
 than weapons in orbit. If a few weapons were put up for blackmail, they might
 invite a pre-emptive strike by ICBM's against the offending country. If a few were
 put up in secrecy, they would neither have the blackmail use nor be decisive in
 countering the total deterrent strength of a major power. If large numbers were
 planned for secret deployment, there are several ways in which their presence would
 quickly be deduced by modern technology. And again, since they probably could
 not reach all the counter forces, they would risk the destruction of the launching
 country, quite aside from the difficulties of guaranteeing reliable performance. This
 assessment may not remain true for all time, and consequently military authorities
 have a responsibility for continuing to study the problem and to have contingency
 counter plans.
 So far I have not compared manned space flight and speculated on future
 plans. The Russians held a strong early lead which was completely overcome by
 our successful Gemini program, with its use of fuel cells for long stay times, its
 use of maneuver, rendezvous, docking, and added propulsion to high orbit. But we
 must be careful to avoid overconfidence; the two year Soviet pause is probably just
 a time of preparation for far more ambitious missions. Through most of the time,
 the Soviet Union has held a strong lead in the lifting power of its operational launch
 vehicles. We are close to having man-rated the Saturn IB, which can put about
 40,000 pounds in low orbit. But now the Russians have a new launch vehicle whose
 first stage thrust is close to double that of Saturn I. When it gets upper stages it
 would be capable of supporting manned orbital laboratory operations, manned
 circumlunar flight without assembly in orbit, or unmanned planetary landers of
 some complexity.
 We have a still larger Saturn V coming which is the basis of our lunar landing
 program and other advanced missions. Newspaper speculation is that the Russians
 have something even larger, but there is no way to assess these stories from open
 sources. If the Russians are to beat us to the Moon, as they sometimes have claimed,
 we must soon see a resumption of their manned flight activity. This is because they
 are as conservative as we in trying to check out equipment before committing men.
 Since there have been repeated stories of Soviet cosmonauts killed in orbit,
 it is necessary to repeat that neither country has suffered such losses in actual flight,
 and we do not know either way how the Russians have fared on the pad. This
 assertion is supportable both in terms of official United States testimony and in
 terms of simple logic. Every announced flight has succeeded, and been advertised
 while in progress. Every so-called failure has been part of a supposedly secret pro-
 gram which is never detected by official tracking stations, but which is "followed"
 by amateur radio listeners.

 Future Prospects
 Parametric studies show that even. without new scientific discoveries, better
 engineering will bring the costs of space flight down by orders of magnitude in the
 years ahead. The Soviet Union for many years has pledged itself at all levels of its
 government to explore the whole solar system with men. They and ourselves are
 capable of doing this. As costs fall, it will be within the reach of other countries as
 well. As our command of power increases, we can confidently expect to see the
 Moon. and perhaps at least Mars and Venus made into habitable, interesting, and
 economically useful places for mankind.
 In a sense, we are at the threshold of a new civilization. What are the chances
 that only Earth has intelligent life? We are one tiny planet among many billions
 of galaxies made up of many billions of stars. Probably only the distances and our
 insignificance have shielded us from possible contacts with life from far away. Not
 knowing where ultimate destiny will carry us, there are still finite goals within the
 solar system which may determine whether America continues to hold a position of
 leadership among men or whether it slips into one of the backwaters of history. A
 broad strategic concept of our nation and its position in human affairs requires an
 awareness of the costs, problems, and potential rewards of space flight.

 Why Tlnr Forum
 December 6th is the 25th anniversary of Pearl
 Harbor Eve - that moment when America slept,
 indifferent to the strategies of foreign dictators,
 taking false comfort from the assumed security of
 her great ocean moats, unaware that the carriers
 of Imperial Japan were readying a first strike,
 and ignorant also of the ideology and global war
 plans of Nazi Germany.
 In the nuclear age, it is imperative that Americans
 never again misread the intentions, or under-
 estimate the capabilities, of totalitarian  Party
 elites. It is vital that civilian opinion-leaders under-
 stand the complex formulae of national defense
 and international security affairs which include
 factors of technology, diplomacy, economics and
 national will.
 Overall Purpose
 The purpose of this Forum is not to look back-
 ward towards December of 1941, but to focus on
 the requirements of a sophisticated "forward
 strategy for freedom" that will enable the U.S.,
 in the next 10-15 years, to (a) keep aggression at
 bay, whether through insurgency or space-war-
 fare, and (b) help less fortunate nations build the
 institutions required for genuine peace and human
 betterment. We seek educational substitutes for
 Pearl Harbor and search for new organizational
 skills by which the private citizen can more ef-

 What is NSIC?
 The National Strategy Information Center (NSIC), organized in 1962,
 assists professional societies, associations and the general public to study
 the relation of military power, geopolitics and communications theory to
 national goals. It has organized forums on comparative ideology, eco-
 nomic warfare, and propaganda analysis for such groups as the Young
 Presidents Organization, the Steel Service Center Institute and the U.S.
 Chamber of Commerce. For four years, it has worked with a Standing
 Committee of the American Bar Association to support some 20 university
 summer institutes for high school teachers on "Democracy vs. Com-
 munism."
 NSIC's first major book, a symposium of twenty-six authorities, is
 entitled PEACE AND WAR IN THE MODERN AGE; Frank R. Barnett,
 William C. Mott and John C. Neff (editors); Doubleday; 1965. Contributors
 include Dean Acheson, Arleigh Burke, Allen Dulles, Dwight Eisenhower,
 Dean Rusk and scholars who lecture to the War Colleges and write for
 the military and foreign policy quarterlies.
 In 1964, the Center distributed to high school debate teams in 30
 states 7,000 gift copies of an analysis of the semantics and security
 implications of "peaceful coexistence" as used in Communist journals
 and Party memoranda. The 126-page abstract and commentary was pre-
 pared for the American Bar Association by scholars at The Center for
 Strategic Studies at Georgetown University. In 1965, NSIC distributed
 5,000 copies of a panel discussion on "Detente and the National Security"
 conducted before the joint student body of The Industrial College of the
 Armed Forces and The National War College, and published in THE
 GENERAL ELECTRIC FORUM. Other contributors to this issue of the
 journal included foreign correspondent Roscoe Drummond, Under Sec-
 retary of State George W. Ball and General Earle G. Wheeler, Chairman,
 U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Since 1962 the New York Committee, National Strategy Seminars has
 called upon NSIC to suggest topics and provide speakers for its annual
 series of 12 lectures. These seminars, held each year since 1958 at Town
 Hall in New York City, are organized by New York alumni of field courses
 conducted by The Industrial College of the Armed Forces, under the
 chairmanship of Frank A. Vanderlip, Jr. Because of the high quality and
 intrinsic educational value of this program, the Department of Defense
 has officially sponsored and certified it for reserve point credit for all
 services.
 Currently, NSIC is organizing national security briefings for mass
 media personnel co-sponsored by universities.
 NSIC is supported by grants and gifts from foundations, corporations,
 individuals and associations. All grants are tax-deductible to the donor.
