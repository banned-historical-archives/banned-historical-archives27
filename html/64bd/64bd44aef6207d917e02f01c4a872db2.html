 Be Both Red and Expert, anal Scale the Pinnacle in the
 A; Talk with YQwag-:Comrades. on the. Question.. of Rednepc ;and :Expertness
 'CPYRGHT.
 Ch' ien::Hs{{eh-sen' (*;,                                                               ?-t-) .
 (Peking `Cn Tkuo Ch' ine nien Pao        ,Tune-3, 1965)
 Some young comrades have said:  "Ch'ien Hs {eh-sen is an example of thos
 who follow t,4e road of 'expertness first and redness later.'"
 To this question I'replied in 1957.  At that time I said, "It is-true that
 have worked for 'expertness first,' but whether I. can achieve 'redness later' or
 not depends on how well Ilearn [to be-red]. . But I do: not. agree with those who
 say that 'expertnesq first and redness later' must be a.short,-cut."
 At that time .1 had not yet 'joined the. Party and my level of political thinki g .
 was not high, so'that was the farthest?I could go with regard t9 the.question.
 In 1958 I was accepted-as a member of the Communist Party.-, After that, tha  s:::

 consciousness has. gone up somewhat and.I have begun to understand better the ques ion:
 -of redness and' expertness.   I now wish to say something about it from another a ;41e."
 Is it not true that some young-comrades are saying that they want to te..
 the road of "three-pass" (to be able to win a pass politically, pass the stiffest
 tests professionally, and pass one's time [i.e.,~live] well)?   No matter whether it
 is "three-pass" or "expertness first and rednessilater," the ideological essence is
 the same as I see it.   It is a desire to acquire more of "expertness" and less o
 redness," and to pursue the object of personal gain, high position,..and "passing
 If "three-pass" is the end, then.I could be said.-.to have been atypical "three

 Conference,: I could rate "a pass politically."   "Professionally I could-pass the
 stiffest test," because I had mastered some techniques.    "In livelihood.I.passed the

 ame and profit, and discriminate against you, do you not feel highly ergbarrassed?
 e reason why I wanted to break through the obstacles in the United States and
 ome back to my Motherland is not because I .wanted to live well and win everyone's
 espect, but because I wanted to give the people the knowledge and techniques I had
 cquired and follow the Party politically.   That is why I did not want to be a bour-
 eois intellectual and was not satisfied with being "passable politically."   Instead,
 strove actively for progress politically, intensified my ideological remolding, and
 inally succeeded in becoming a Communist Party member.
 Some young comrades want to take the road which I took in the past.   Taat is
 ery wrong.   It is a road which I think is meaningless and which I have already
 esolutely abandoned.   Why should these young-comrades embark on such a road?
 Young people should have far and great ideals.    (For them] the future road is
 cry broad.   It is proletarian revolutionaries whom you are going-to relieve, not the
 ourgeoisi.e.   This is a question of orientation.   I hope you will not take the wrong
 oad.
 Some young comrades seem to.have the naive:idea that a man may be separated
 rom politics.   They cite examples of past scientists like Newton and Einstein and
 he present-day deveiopment.of science in capitalist.countriey,-saying that these
 cientists never put politics in command but nevertheless were able to make great
 ontributions to science and promote its development.'
 I will say that man cannot get away from politics even if he wants to, and that
 is politics-,either proletarian or bourgeois--that is always in command.   No
 natter whether they were scientists of the past or are.scientists of capitalist coup
 tries of the present, they will not be separated from politics, only theirs is not
 oletarian politics.
 I will not go back too far, but will give an example of the facts I witnessed in
 tic United States.   I have stayed in the United States-for.a total of twenty years,
 d consider myself one who.knows that country very well.   -So far as I know, politics
 i talked about in the United States.   Moreover, it is not:only talked about, but
 t lked about extensively and intensively--it-penetrates into everything.   Their radio,
 t levision, newspapers and periodicals of all types keep propagandizing every minute
 b urgeois politics-and the "Heaven and earth destroy those who do not mind their own
 i terestsi'.indivtdualist life philosophy..i  Of course,, since their polities serves the
 b g capitalists, certain things cannot be held up to view.   So they have to adopt more
 c ncealed,'deceptive means and'do their propaganda furtively.:
 Perhaps someone may say that one who is engaged in work on natural science need .;.
 n )t touch politics.   True, natural'science..has:no.class character, but people engaged
 i             work on natural science have it.    In a class society, science and technology cannot.
 a oid serving a specific social system and a.certain.class.  It is a lie to say that.'
 o e is engaged exclusively in scientific and technical work and is not concerned with
 3 litics..  There is no scientist-in a capitalist country who is not concerned with
 Politics.   Even Einstein, who professed aloofness from politics, actually took part
 i  it.   Was the first atom bomb of the United. States not produced at his suggestion
 t  the United States Government?   That was.politics!
 Take myself for example.   In the twenty years when I lived in the United States
 I was never outside the sphere of bourgeois politics.    It was not until my return to
 t le Motherland, my study of Marxism-Leninism and the thought of Mao Tse-tung with the
 p tient help and education of the Party, and my participation in some political move-
 in nts, that I was gradually awakened and began to make some progress and understand
 c rtain things.   I have told myself that if I had been educated by the Party and had
 s udied some Marxism-Leninism and the.thought of Mao.Tse-tung earlier, I might have
 a oided taking many detours and produced more results'.,in,my scientific work.

 The reason is very simple. It is because both the time and conditions have
 changed.   Ours is now a socialist country under proletarian dictatorship where the
 bourgeoisie will sooner or later go out of existence, bourgeois thought will be boycotted
 and any difference between physical and mental labor will be eliminated.   It is the
 object of our revolution to "promote the proletarian and destroy the bourgeois cause."
 If a man embarks on a road that is doomed to extinction, how can he ever reach his
 destination?   Once is such a cul-de-sac, how can he think freely and be contented?
 In such an abnormal spiritual state, he will not be able to concentrate and learn well.
 How can he settle down to gain "expertness"?
 Therefore I say that in our country, those whose head is full of bourgeois indivi-
 dualist ideas must strive to intensify their-own remolding, or they will surely be unable
 to become "expert" in anything.   It will be a vain for them to try to become really
 "expert. rr
 On the other hand, is it better to be "only red but not expert"?  .No, it is
 not.    If a man is not "expert" but is contented only with being "red," then'his
 "redness" will be; questionable.. He can only be a worthless politician who is of little
 use to the people.   This is because if you want to'serve'the people and serve them well,
 you will have.~to have real talent.-
 I hear that there is a misunderstanding among young comrades:  Whenever we mentiron-
 the. subject of redness and expertness, they seem to think that "redness" is more im-
 ?portant than "expertness."-  As a result, some of them no longer devote their energies
 to their school work or to-the study of their chosen line of work, because they are
 afraid that people may call them "experts without redness."
 The truth is that the Party and Chairman Mao have always insisted on being both
 red and expert.   They have never said that they want only redness but not expertness.'
 Do these young people not want to be "red"?   If they want to be "red," then they
 must first of all listen to Chairman Mac's advice:  Be-both red and expert.   They
 must net neglect expertness.
 At present, since this kind of misunderstanding;still.exists among some young
 comrades, I cannot but say a few words more about it.
 First,of all, I want to make it particularly clear to our young comrades that,
 according to the fact that science and technology is still comparatively backward in
 our country, we are not having too much.trexpertness" at present, or having quite enough
 of it.   On the contrary, we are having too little "expertness" and what we have is
 s'ar zrom enough.   In order to enable our science and technology to catch up with.an
 'overtake the most advanced level in the world and in order to build our country into
 a socialist power as soon as possible, we need`to have much more "expertness," so that'
 we may have more and better oilfields. like Ta-ch'ing, more and better 12,000-ton hydrau-
 lic presses, more and better atom bombs, eta.   In short, we must have what other
 people have and what they have not yet had.'
 In this way, our country will, be more powerful than ever, imperialism and revi-
 sionism will no longer dare to bully us, and we shall be able to.make greater than
 ever contributions.to.the revolutionary cause of the people of the whole world.
 That is what we mean when we say "redness" must be made practical in "expertness"
 so as to produce results.   Otherwise, by not producing anything concrete, all our
 talk about being both red and expert will be mere empty talk.   The "redness" will
 have no meaning at all.
 Therefore, young comrades need not have any.misgiving about being "expert."
 So long as they firmly sticitto the proletarian stand and-seriously put the thought of
 Mao Tse-tung in command,. they may freely and boldly pursue ..'rexpertnes-s.""   If they seek
 "expertness" for the sake of revolution, ,the more .:''expert" they are, the better it will

 My  o   a Party an     irman   o put  orwar    a  eman  o being   o    e
 and expert," and declare that it is the only correct'ro4d for intellectual youth?
 So far as I know, this is because a man must work and work "expertly," but then
 there must be a correct orientation for "expertness."  The question in regard to
 this orientatial is for whom do you pursue "expertness" and whom do you serve.   In,
 our country we work to serve proletarian politics, and so we must be "both red and
 expert."
 hat is "redness" and what is 'expertness"?   Different persons may have different
 ?ideas.
 Personally, I think "redness" should mean support for the Communist Party and
 socialism and use of one's specialized knowledge in the service of socialist construc-
 and the struggle against modern revisionism and between the two roads in the country,''
 one must be able to stick firmly to one's stand and carry out thoroughly the Party's
 guidelines and policies.
 "Expertness," on the other hand, means mastery of basic skills, gradual acquisition
 and complete mastery of the theories and techniques of one's-speciality, and skilful ap-
 plication of these theories and techniques. in practice.
 What I have said here about redness and expertness is the very elementary require-
 ment.    Our young comrades should not feel satisfied with fulfillment of this require-
 ment alone, but should try to fulfill the expectations of the Party. '  They should re-
 solve to be reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution and firmly
 .and untiringly impose on-themselves strict demands in accordance with the five standards
 for revolutionary successors mentioned. in the "9th Comment."
 * The 9th comment by the editorial departments of the Jen-min Jih-paao and Red Flag or.
 the open letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU.
 Entitled "On Khrushchev's Phoney. Communism and Its..Historical Lessons for the
 World,1'.the comment named these requirements for "successors to the cause of the pro-
 letarian revolution":
 (1) They must be genuine Marxist-Leninists andnot revisionists like Khrushchev
 wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism.
 (2) They must be revolutionaries who whole-heartedly serve the majority of the
 people. of China and the whole world, and must not be like Khrushchev who serves both
 the interests of the handful of members of the privileged bourgeois stratum in his
 own.country and those: of foreign imperialism and reaction.
 (3) They must be proletarian statesmen capable of uniting and working together
 .with the overwhelming majority.   Not only must they unite with those who agree with
 them, they must also be good at uniting with those who disagree and even with those who
 formerly opposed them and have since been proved wrong.   But they must especially
 watch out for careerists and,-conspirators like Khrushchev and prevent such bad elements
 from usurping the leadership of the Party and government at any level.
 (4) They must be models in applying the Party's democratic centralism, must master
 the method of leadership based on the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," and
 must cultivate a democratic style and be good at listening to the masses.   They must
 not be despotic like Khrushchev and violate the Party's'democratic centralism, make
 surprise attacks on comrades or act arbitrarily and dictatorially.
 (5) They must be modest and prudent: and guard against arrogance and impetuosity;
 they must be imbued with the spirit of self-criticism and have the courage to correct
 mistakes and shortcomings in their work.   They must not cover up.their errors like
 Khrushchev, and claim all the credit for'themselvesiand shift all the blame on others..:

 CPYRGHT
 There is"no end to" either "redness  or "expertness."  -If at any time one feels
 contented with one's achievements and thinks that no further effort is necessary, one
 will be blocking one's?own way to progress.
 Whether in point of "redness" or "expertness," I am still far short of the high
 standards of requirement.  However, I do not feel. downhearted.   I am only in the
 early fifties and full of confidence. Our young comrades are much younger than
 myself.   They are only in their twenties or thirties, and they still have a long way
 to go in life and work.   If they firmly follow the road of being both red and expert,
 they will certainly be able to make faster progress and greater achievements than we
 of the older generation.
 I h ve heard some young comrades say:  It is good to be "both red and expert,"
 but that is a difficult goal to attain because there is so little time.   A -view widely
 held by'them is: Time is a constant; in order to be "red" one has no time to be  expert,
 and in order to be "expert" one has no time to be "red."   They seem to think that
 the main difficulty that prevents them from being "both red and expert" is lack of time.
 In my opinion; this view is not quite scientific.   The view that time is a constan
 is metaphysical; because it stresses one-sidedly only the objective factor of time and
 fails to see the subjective factor of man.   Within the same time, some people can do
 more and better work than others.   Why   Because man has initiative.  If a man cares
 to use his brain, he will be able to find all, the time he peeds.   The question is
 whether you have sufficient drive.
 I'think we can attain both redness and expertness.   The crucial question here
 is not one of time,'but rather what you put in the commanding. position--whether it is
 proletarian politics and the thought of Mao Tse-tung or personal fame and profit.
 .To put proletarian politics and the thought of Mao Tse-tung in the commanding position,
 one must ceaselessly and  consciously carr:r out ideological remolding and struggle
 against one's own individualism.
 Compared with workers and.peasants, we intellectuals in general are not quite
 so innocent.   Many intellectuals have complex family backgrounds and social relations.
 They are deeply influenced by bourgeois and feudal thought and are full of individualis
 so that it is very difficult to remold them.
 Take me for example.   My family background and social relations are very complex.
 In addition, I have lived in the United States for twenty years.   Therefore I have bee
 subjected to more bourgeois influence than many other people.-  All this brings with
 it a ceriain degree of hindrance to my own progress and remolding.
 But time marches forward, and it will not do to refuse to reform.   This is also
 true with our scientific and technical work.
 As everyone knows, our scientific and technical work is built and developed
 on an old foundation.   Many of our veteran intellectuals engaged in scientific and
 technical work have come from the old society or the-capitalist- society.,   Many of
 our scientific and technical books are old.':  Many of our new books and periodicals
 have come from capitalist countries.   Even much of our system-of scientific and
 technical work and education has been inherited from~the old society or directly copied
 from capitalist countries.
 The influence exerted by all these on our scientific and-technical work and
 on our scientific and technical personnel cannot be dismissed lightly.   As a matter
 of fact, the bourgeois and feudal ideas, separation from reality, metaphysics, idealism
 mechanical materialism, etc. that'exist in our scientific and technical-work and in
 the mind of our scientific and technical personnel have all been derived from these
 among young people, so that they are exposed to very undesirable-influence.   $uch

 themselves with politics, it is, desirable-to follow the '','expertness-first-and-redness
 later" road, serious separation from the masses and-from reality in work, etc.--are
 all reflections of erroneous thinking.   It will not'do not to reform these things
 in earnest.
 Finally I want'to say something about the best means and way by which
 intellectuals may carry out ideological remolding and attain both redness and expert-
 ness.   The way is earnest.study of Chairman Mao's works, going deep into the worker-
 peasant-soldier masses and pzolonged participation in collective physical labor, and
 active participation-and tempering in the three major revolutionary movements of class
 struggle, production struggle and scientific experiment.
 Chairman Mao's works are an ideological, weapon.   Almost the whole world is now
 studying them.   Revolutionary peoples study them in order to draw strength from them.
 Imperialist chiefs.Johnson, Taylor, and others also study them.   They do so in the
 hope of finding some means of dealing with us.
 The revolutionary peoples can immediately make good use of what they have learned.
 The enemy, on the other hand, continue to suffer defeat miserably in spite of his effort.
 Here there is the question of stand and sentiment.   If ke intellectuals have not a cer-
 tain amount of [proletarians class consciousness and. class sentiment, we shall not be
 able to study well.
 Someone has asked: Can a study of Chairman Mao's works help to solve practical
 problems in scientific and technical work?   My answer is that it not only can, but
 moreover is quite effective.   Innumerable facts have shown that wherever the thought
 of-Mao Tse-tung is placed in command, positive results can always eventually be
 achieved in our scientific and technical work, and that moreover there will be less
 detours and mistakes.   The successful detonation of our first atom bomb within such,
 a short time, a fact that startled the whole world, was a result of the placing of
 the thought of Mao Tse-tung in the commanding position by our scientific-technical
 personnel and workers.   On the other hand, when we have not studied thoroughly
 Chairman Mao's works and do not understand them well enough,-our thoughts will remain
 stationary and we shall not be able to do our work well.
 How should Chairman Mao's works be studied?   I think the most effective
 means is to study in relation to our problems.   This is a highly successful piece of
 experience that has been summed up by the PLA.-
 In our scientific-technical units, should our young comrades not study Chairman
 Mao's works with regard to the following three aspects and in.relationto problems,
 of their own actual ideological state and their actual work?
 (1) To establish a revolutionary life outlook, serve the people
 wholeheartedly, cultivate a high degree of!devotion to one's work and
 a high sense of responsibility in work, and struggle against all diffi-
 culties courageously;
 (2) To solve correctly the relationship between book knowledge and
 practical knowledge and between foreign experience and Chinese practice,
 break superstitions, liberate thinking, and truly embark on the creat:.ve
 road of linking theory with practice;
 (3) To apply consciously in scientific-technical research the theory
 'of knowledge and methodology of dialectical materialism, improve the method
 of.thinking and work, and better solve scientific-technical problems.
 I have probably expressed myself.imperfectly with regard to the, three aspects above,
 but I suggest them for the. reference of our young comrades.
 With regard to the question of participation in the three major revolutionary
 movements, much has already been said by other comrades, and I will not say anything
 more.       Here I will make only this point:  Our cause is:a'collective one and none
 of our work can be divorced from the collective..   Accordingly, it is very impr.ctant
 to establish firmly the- mass viewpoint in our. mind,?so-that we may rely on the masses
 and follow the mass line in everything.

 This appears very easy, but in my'experience it is very difficult to accomplish
 really.     In taking part in the three major revolutionary movements, particularly in
 carrying gut scientific experiment, our young Comrades must pay careful attention to
 and gradually "resolve this problem.
 Because their family background is not good, some young comrades have placed a
 burden on themselves and slackened their demand for "redness" on themselves.   That
 is wrong.   One cannot choose one's own family background, but one should be perfectly
 able to choose what road to follow.*   The important thing is one's conduct.   If one
 takes the road of being both red and expert and follow it resolutely, there will be
 a bright and great future.
 Young comrades, the present situation is very favorable on our scientific-
 technical front as on other fronts.                       Thanks to the close concern shown by the Party
 center and Chairman Mao and their brilliant leadership, and as a result of the efforts
 of all our scientific-technical personnel, our scientific-technical work has already
 initially.rid itself of the backward aspect.   We are now able to solve by ourselves
 some important and difficult problems of socialist construction, to design and build
 some large-scale, modern enterprises.   Certain peaks in the world's new scientific
 domain have also been scaled by us.   Our scientific-technical forces have also grown in
 strength considerably.   The day of our catching up with and overtaking the world's
 advanced scientific-technical level cannot be too far away.   With such a favorable
 situation, there is no reason why we should not work well.
 Imperialism and revisionism still want to strangle us any moment.   They think
 they can take"advantage of our scientific-technical backwardness,,   But we the Chinese
 people are determined.   Tn the past more than ten years the'Party and Chairman Mao
 have led us in changing initially the backward aspect: of our science and technology,
 thus vindicating the Chinese people and all oppressed nations of the world.
 If we listen to Chairman Mao's advice, resolutely cherish the great ambition
 of catching up with and overtaking the most advanced world level, work hard, fully
 master our work, and make concerted efforts, we shall certainly be able to raise
 our scientific-technical level to a new high peal, build our country into a modern
 power, and contribute more toward the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.
 Having high aspirations and great drive, and daring to think and act, young
 people constitute the strongest effectivea and shock force on our scientific-technical
 front. You will be a relief force.'' You must have the will and ambition to be such,,
 and shoulder this great and glorious task.
 Young comrades, raise speedily our scientific-technical level, build our
 China into the strongest country in the world, be good revolutionaries at home and
 internationally.   I put a-11,I have said into one sentence: You must be both red and
 expert, firmly ground redness inexpertness,, and scale the pinnacle courageously for
 the sake of our revolutionary cause.
 PROCUREMENT OF FARM PRODUCE
 Only When You Organize Purchase in Time Can You Support
 the Development of Production
 (Peking !Len-min Jih-pao, May 23, 165)
 Only when we make timely purchases of farm and ,subsidiary products can we
 support the development of production and satisfy market demands.   This is a useful
 experience--and a lessons-which we have gained in'the course of buying preserved turnip.
