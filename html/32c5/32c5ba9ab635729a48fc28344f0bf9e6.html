 September 19, 1966       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 fact that the news media obtained informa-
 tion (which could just as probably come from
 recipients of the subpoenas), no conclusion
 can be drawn that the Committee released
 the information.  The complaint alleged no
 specific fact showing that the release was by
 a named Committee member or by an au-
 thorized employee at a stated time and place
 or by some stated means. Unsupported con-
 clusory allegations are insufficient to estab-
 lish something as a fact.  Riley v. Titus, 89
 U.S. App. D.C. 79, 190 P. 2d 653 (1951).
 V. Plaintiffs'  Conclusory Allegations  Set
 Forth In the Complaint and in Their
 Affidavits Should Be Stricken as a Matter
 of Law
 From what we have shown supra, it is
 clear that the House Un-American Activities
 Committee hearings scheduled for August
 16, 1966, which are challenged in this pro-
 ceeding, serve a legitimate legislative pur-
 pose.  The conclusory allegations set forth
 in plaintiffs' affidavits and in paragraphs 10,
 12 and 13 of their complaint purport to
 contravene the fact that the hearings serve
 a valid purpose.   However, even the most
 cursory  examination  of  the  enumerated
 paragraphs of the complaint and the affi-
 davits will reflect the broad and all-encom-
 passing sweep of plaintiffs contentions and
 logically, will demonstrate, as well, that their
 assertions can be predicated only upon con-
 jecture and emotion and not upon personal
 knowledge as they represent in their veri-
 fication  to  the  complaint  and  in  their
 affidavits.
 Absent basic, factual allegations which
 would of necessity be exposed to the fresh
 air of examination by this Court, plaintiffs'
 conclusory assertions are insufficient as a
 matter of law to sustain their contentions
 that purposes, other than legitimate legis-
 lative inquiry, exist for the hearings now
 being conducted.
 The rule controlling here arose out of
 Riley v. Titus, supra, where our` Court of
 Appeals stated at pp. 654-55: "The appellant
 plaint  of  allegations  of  "malice",  "con-
 spiracy", "unlawfulness" and the like.                                                                                See
 e.g., Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 565, 569 (mal-
 ice); Norton v. McShane, supra, 332 F. 2d
 at 357 (malicious arrest, abuse and mis-
 treatment, and conspiracy);. Gager v. "Bob
 Seidel", 112 U.S. App. D.C. 135, 140, 300 F.
 2d 727, 732, cert. denied 370 U.S. 959 (1962)
 (conspiracy) ;  Ove Gustavsson Contracting
 Co. v. Floete, 299 F. 2d 655, 657-859 (2d Cir.
 1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 827 (1963) (wil-
 fully, maliciously, with intent to harm and
 injure); Bershad v. Wood, supra, 290 F. 2d
 at 715-719 (malice); DeBusk v. Harvin, 212
 F. 2d 143, 147 (5th Cir. 1954) (malicious acts
 and conspiracy) ; Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.
 2d 579, 581 (1949), cert. denied 339 U.S. 949
 (1950)  (conspired and maliciously and wil-
 fully entered into a scheme); Laughlin v.
 Rosenman, 82 U.S. App. D.C. 164, 168, 163
 F. 2d 838, 840 (1947)  (knowingly, wilfully
 and maliciously participated in an unlawful
 conspiracy) ;  Cooper v. O'Connor,  69 U.S.
 App. D.C. 100, 102, 99 F. 2d 135, 137, cert.
 denied 305 U.S. 643 (1938)  (wanton, mali-
 cious and unlawful acts).
 For  this  reason  plaintiff's  unsupported
 conclusory allegations both in the complaint
 and In their affidavits should be stricken.
 Wherefore, for the reasons stated herein
 the    Court is respectfully urged to strike
 paragraphs 10, 12 and 13 of the complaint
 and paragraphs 4 and 5 of each of the plain-
 tiffs' affidavits and to dismiss the complaint.

 In addition, the Sunday edition of the
 New York Times magazine section car-
 ried a devastating analysis of the war by
 Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., former assistant
 to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, who
 concludes that-
 Deescalation could work, if there were the
 will to pursue it.
 Perhaps Goodwin and Schlesinger will
 only convert those of us who are already
 convinced that the United States should
 follow this course.  But I cannot believe
 that their comments would not influence
 the thinking of the "hawks" as well, if
 only they were willing to listen.
 In the firm hope that Professor Schles-
 inger's comments will not fall on deaf
 ears, I am inserting his article, "A Middle
 Way Out of Vietnam," in the RECORD at
 this point.  I hope that it will be widely
 read.
 The article follows:
 SCHLESINGER SUGGESTS THAT WE RECOVER OUR
 COOL AND FOLLOW A MIDDLE WAY OUT OF
 VIETNAM
 (By Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.)
 (NoTE.-Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., is a for-
 mer special assistant to Presidents Kennedy
 and Johnson, author of "A Thousand Days,"
 and Albert Schweitzer professor of the hu-
 manities, City University of New York.)
 Why we are in Vietnam is today a question
 of only historical interest.  We are there, for
 better or for worse, and we must deal with
 the situation that exists.    Our national se-
 curity may not have compelled us to draw a
 line across Southeast Asia where we did, but,
 having drawn it, we cannot lightly abandon
 it.  Our stake in South Vietnam may have
 been self-created, but it has nonetheless be-
 come real.  Our precipitate withdrawal now
 would have ominous reverberations through-
 out Asia.  Our commitment of over 300,000
 American troops, young men of exceptional
 skill and gallantry engaged in cruel and diffi-
 cult warfare, measures the magnitude of our
 national concern.
 We have achieved this entanglement, not
 after due and deliberate consideration, but
 through a series of small decisions.  It is not
 only idle but unfair to seek out guilty men.
 President Eisenhower, after rejecting Amer-
 ican military intervention in                                                                                                                                    1954, set In
 motion the policy of support for Saigon
 which  resulted,  two  Presidents  later,  in
 American  military   intervention     in 1965.
 Each step in the deepening of the Amer-
 ican commitment was reasonably regarded
 at the time as the last that would be neces-
 sary; yet, in retrospect, each step led only to
 the next, until we find ourselves entrapped
 today in that nightmare of American strate-
 gists, a land war in Asia-a war which no
 President, including President Johnson, de-
 sired or intended.  The Vietnam story is a
 tragedy  without  villains.  No  thoughtful
 American can withhold sympathy as Presi-
 dent Johnson ponders the gloomy choices
 which lie ahead.
 Yet  each President,     as  he  makes  his
 choices, must expect to be accountable for
 them. Everything in recent weeks-the ac-
 tions                                                                                                                          of the Administration,  the         intima-
 tions of actions to come,  even a certain
 harshness in the Presidential rhetoric-sug-
 gests that President Johnson has made his
 choice, and that his choice is the careful
 enlargement of the war.  New experiments
 in  escalation  are  first denied,  then  dis-
 owned, then discounted and finally under-
 taken.                                                                                                                          As past medicine fails, all we can
 apparently think to do is to increase the
 dose.  In May the Secretary of the Air Force
 explained why we were not going to bomb
 Hanoi and Haiphong; at the end of June
 we began the strikes against the oil depots.

 around, which they weren't would the mili-
 tary gain have outweighed the human and
 political loss?  Charles Mohr writes in The
 Times:  "Almost every provincial hospital in
 Vietnam is crowded with civilian victims of
 the war.  Some American doctors and other
 officials in the field say the majority are the
 victims of American air power and South
 Vietnamese artillery."
 The trouble is that we are fighting one
 war, with our B-52's and our naval guns and
 our napalm, and the Vietcong are fighting
 another, with their machine guns and am-
 bushes and forays in the dark.  "If we can
 get the Vietcong to stand up and fight, we
 will blast him," General Westmoreland has
 plaintively said; and when they occasionally
 rise to the surface and try to fight our kind
 of war, we do blast them.  But the fact that
 they then slide back into the shadows does
 not mean that we are on the verge of some
 final military triumph.    It means simply
 that we are driving them underground-
 where they renew themselves and where our
 large, fierce dog cannot follow.
 Saigon officials have been reporting that
 Vietcong morale is declining as long as I can
 remember; these reports need not be taken
 seriously now.  I know of no convincing evi-
 dence that the Vietcong lack the political
 and emotional commitment to keep fighting
 underground for another 20 years.
 Our strategy in Vietnam Is rather like try-
 ing to weed a garden with a bulldozer.  We
 occasionally dig up some weeds, but we dig
 up most of the turf, too.  The effect of our
 policy is to pulverize the political and insti-
 tutional fabric which alone can give a South
 Vietnamese state that hope of independent
 survival which is our presumed war aim.
 Our method, in other words,  defeats our
 goal.  Indeed, the most likely beneficiary of
 the smashed social structure of South Viet-
 nam                 will  be Communism.   "My feeling,"
 Gen. Wallace Greene, commandant of the
 Marine Corps, has wisely said, "is that you
 could kill every Vietcong and North Viet-
 namese in South Vietnam and still lose the
 war.   Unless we can make a success of the
 civic-action program, we are not going to
 obtain the objectives we have set."
 Much devotion and intelligence are at
 present going into the programs of recon-
 struction, but prospects are precarious so
 long as the enemy can slice through so much
 of South Vietnam with such apparent im-
 munity; and so long as genuine programs of
 social reform threaten the vested interests
 of the Saigon Government and of large land-
 holders.  In any case, as claimants on our
 resources, these programs of pacification are
 hopelessly outclassed by the programs of de-
 struction.  Surely, the United States, with
 all its ingenuity, could have figured out a
 better way to combat guerrilla warfare than
 the physical obliteration of the nation in
 which it is taking place.  If this Is our best
 idea of "protecting" a country against "wars
 of national liberation," what other country,
 seeing the devastation we have wrought in
 Vietnam, will wish American protection?
 At the same time, our concentration on
 Vietnam is exacting a frightful cost in other
 areas of national concern.  In domestic pot-
 icy, with Vietnam gulping down a billion
 and a half dollars a month, everything is
 grinding to a stop.  Lyndon Johnson was
 on his way to a place in history as a great
 President for his vision of a Great Society;
 but the Great Society is now, except for
 token gestures, dead. The fight for equal op-
 portunity for the Negro, the war against
 poverty, the struggle to save the cities, the
 improvement of our schools-all  must be
 starved for the sake of Vietnam. And war
 brings ugly side-effects: inflation; frustra-
 tion; angry protest; attack on dissenters on
 the ground that they cheer the enemy (an
 attack often mounted by men who led the
 dissent during the Korean war) ; premoni-
 tions of McCarthyism.
 We also pay a cost abroad.  Our allies nat-
 urally draw away as they see us heading
 down the road toward war with China.
 When we began to bomb the oil depots, James
 Reston wrote:  "There is now not a single
 major nation in the world that supports
 Mr. Johnson's latest adventure in Hanoi and
 Haiphong."   As nations seek to disengage
 themselves from the impending conflict, the
 quasi-neutralism of leaders like de Gaulle
 gains new plausibility.
 On      any  realistic  assessment,  Western
 Europe  and  Latin  America  are far    more
 significant to American security than South
 Asia; yet the Vietnam obsession has stultified
 our policy and weakened our position in both
 these vital areas.  The war has clouded the
 hope,  once  mildly promising,  of  progress
 toward a detente with the Soviet Union.   It
 has helped block agreements to end under-
 ground nuclear testing and to stop the spread
 of nuclear weapons.  It has precipitated the
 decision of U Thant to resign as Secretary
 General of the United Nations and condemns
 the U.N. itself to a time of declining influence.
 Our rejection of the views of our friends
 and allies-our conviction, as Paul H. Smith
 has put it, "that we alone are qualified to
 be  judge,  jury  and  executioner"-ignores
 Madison's solemn warning in the 63rd Fed-
 eralist:  "An attention to the judgment of
 other nations is important to every govern-
 ment for two reasons: the one is that in-
 dependently of the merits of any particular
 plan or measure, it is desirable, on various
 accounts, that it should  appear to other
 nations as the offspring of a wise and hon-
 orable policy; the second is that in doubt-
 ful  cases, particularly where the national
 councils may be warped by some strong pas-
 sion or momentary interest, the presumed
 or known opinion of the impartial world
 may be the best guide that can be followed.
 What has not America lost by her want of
 character  with  foreign nations;  and  how
 many errors and follies would she not have
 avoided, if the justice and propriety of her
 measures had, in every instance, been previ-
 ously tried by the light in which they would
 probably appear to the unbiased part of
 mankind."
 The Administration has called the critics
 of  its  Vietnam  policy  "neoisolationists: "
 But surely the real neoisolationists are those
 who have isolated the United States from
 its allies and raised the tattered standard,
 last flourished 15 years ago by Douglas Mac-
 Arthur, of "going it alone."
 . How have we managed to imprison our-
 selves in this series of dilemmas?  One rea-
 son surely is that we have somehow lost our
 understanding of the uses of power.  Under-
 standing of power implies above all precision
 in its  application.   We have moved away
 from the subtle strategy of "flexible response"
 under which the level of American force was
 graduated to meet the level of enemy threat.
 The triumph of this discriminate employ-
 ment of power was, of course, the Cuban
 missile crisis  (where the Joint Chiefs, as
 usual, urged an air assault on the missile
 bases).  But President Johnson, for all his
 formidable abilities, has shown no knack for
 discrimination  in  his  use of power.   His
 technique is to try and overwhelm his ad-
 versary-as in the Dominican Republic and
 Vietnam-by piling on all forms of power
 without regard to the nature of the threat.
 Given this weakness for the indiscriminate
 use of power, it is easy to see why the appli-
 cation of force in Vietnam has been sur-
 rendered to the workings of what an acute
 observer of the Johnson foreign policy, Philip
 Geyelin, calls "the escalation machine."  This
 machine is, in effect, the momentum in the
 decision-making  system  which  keeps     en-
 larging the war "for reasons only marginally
 related to military need."
 22055
 The very size and weight of the American
 military presence generate unceasing pres-
 sures to satisfy military demands.  These may
 be demands to try out new weapons; the
 London Sunday Telegraph recently ran an
 informative article comparing the Vietnam
 war to the Spanish Civil War as a military
 testing ground and laboratory.  Or they may
 be cries for "one more step," springing in part
 from suppressed rage over the fact that, with
 military power sufficient to blow up the world,
 we still cannot compel guerrilla bands in
 black pajamas to submit to our will.  What-
 ever the reason, Sir Robert Thompson has
 noted of the American theory of the war:
 "There was a constant tendency in Vietnam
 to mount large-scale operations, which had
 little purpose or prospect of success, merely
 to indicate that something aggressive was
 being done."
 The Administration has freely admitted
 that such operations, like the bombing of the
 North, are designed in part to prop up the
 morale of the Saigon Government;         And the
 impression is growing now that they are also
 in  part  undertaken  in  order  to  smother
 doubts about the war in the United States
 and   to  reverse  anti-Administration  ten-
 dencies in the polls.                                                                                                                                 Americans have become
 curiously insensitive to the use of military
 operations for domestic political purposes. A
 quarter-century ago  President     Roosevelt
 postponed the North African invasion so that
 it would not take place before the midterm
 elections of  1942;  but today  observers in
 Washington, without evidence of shock, pre-
 dict a new venture in escalation before the
 midterm elections of 1966.
 The triumph of the escalation machine has
 been assisted by the faultiness of the infor-
 mation on which our decisions are based.
 Nothing is phonier than the spurious exacti-
 tude of our statistics about the Vietnam war.
 No doubt a computerized military establish-
 ment  demands  numbers;  but  the  "body
 count" of dead Vietcong, for example, in-
 cludes heaven knows how many innocent
 bystanders and could hardly be more un-
 reliable.  The figures on enemy strength are
 totally baffling, at least to the ordinary citi-
 zen relying on the daily newspaper.  The
 Times on Aug. 10 described "the latest in-
 telligence reports" in Saigon as saying that
 the number of enemy troops in South Viet-
 nam had increased 52,000 since Jan. 1 to a
 total of 282,000.  Yet, "according to official
 figures," the enemy had suffered 31,571 killed
 in action in this period, and the infiltration
 estimate ranged from 35,000 as "definite" to
 54,000 as "possible."
 The only way to reconcile these figures is
 to conclude that the Vietcong have picked up
 from 30,000 to 50,000 local recruits in this
 period.  Since tpis seems unlikely-especially
 in view of our confidence in the decline of
 Vietcong morale-a safer guess is to question
 the wonderful  precision  of the statistics.
 Even the rather vital problem of how many
 North Vietnamese troops are in South Viet-
 nam is swathed in mystery.  The Times re-
 ported on Aug. 7: "About 40,000 North Viet-
 namese troops are believed by allied intelli-
 gence to be in the South."  According to an
 Associated  Press   dispatch from  Saigon
 printed in The Christian Science Monitor of
 Aug.  15:  "The South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment says 102,500 North Vietnamese combat
 troops  and support battalions have infil-
 trated into South Vietnam.
 "These figures are far in excess of United
 States intelligence estimates, which put the
 maximum number of North Vietnamese in
 the South at about 54,000."
 But General Westmoreland told his Texas
 press conference on Aug. 14 that the enemy
 force  included  "about  110,000  main-force
 North  Vietnamese  regular  army    troops."
 Perhaps these statements are all reconcil-
 able, but an apparent discrepancy of this

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE       September 19, 1966
 Magnitude on a question of such importance
 raises a twinge of doubt.
 . Nor is our ignorance confined to battle-
 order statistics. We have always lacked gen-
 uine knowledge of and insight into the po-
 litical and cultural problems of Vietnam, and
 the more we press all problems into a mili-
 tary framework the worse off we are.  The
 Administration in Washington was syste-
 matically misinformed by senior American
 officials in Saigon in 1962--63 regarding the
 progress of the war, the popularity of Diem,
 the effectiveness of the "strategic hamlet"
 program and other vital matters.  It was not
 that these plHCials were deliberately deceiving
 their President; it was that they had deceived
 themselves first. Ordinary citizens restricted
 to reading the American press were better in-
 formed in 1963 than officials who took top-
 secret cables seriously.
 The fact is that our Government just
 doesn't know a lot of things it pretends to
 know.  It is not discreditable that it should
 not know them, for the facts are elusive and
 the judgments incredibly difficult.  But it is
 surely inexcusable that It should pretend to
 know things it does not-and that it should
 pass its own ignorance on to the American
 people as certitude.  And it is even less ex-
 cusable that it should commit the nation to
 a policy involving the greatest dangers on a
 foundation so vague and precarious.
 So now we are set on the course of widen-
 ing the war-even at the cost of multiply-
 ing American casualties in Vietnam and.
 deepening American troubles at home and
 abroad; even at the risk of miring our nation
 in a hopeless and endless conflict on the
 mainland of Asia beyond the effective em-
 ployment of our national power and beyond
 the rapge of our primary interests; even at
 the risk of nuclear war.
 Why does the Administration feel that
 these costs must be paid and these risks run?
 Hovering behind our policy is a larger idea-
 the idea that the war in Vietnam is not just
 a local conflict between Vietnamese but a
 fateful test of wills between China and the
 United States.
 Our political and rhetorical escalation of
 the war has been almost as perilous as our
 military  escalation.  President  Kennedy's
 effort was to pull Laos out of the context of
 great-power conflict and reduce the Laotian
 civil war to rational proportions. As he told
 Khrushchev at Vienna in 1961, Laos was just
 not important enough to entangle two great
 nations.  President Johnson, on the other
 hand, has systematically inflated the signifi-
 cance of the war in Vietnam. "We have
 tried to make it clear over and over again."
 as the Secretary of State has put it, "that al-
 though Hanoi is the prime actor in this
 situation, that it is the policy of Peking that
 has greatly stimulated Hanoi.... It is Ho
 Chi Minh's war,  Maybe it is Mao Tse-tung's
 war."
 "In  the  forties and fifties,"  President
 Johnson has said, "we took our stand in
 Europe to protect the freedom of those
 threatened by aggression.  Now the center
 of attention has shifted to another part of
 the world where aggression is on the march.
 Our stand must be as firm as ever"  Given
 this view, it is presumably necessary to pay
 the greatest costs and run the greatest risks-
 or else invite the greatest defeat.
 Given this view, too, there is no reason
 not to Americanize the war.  President Ken-
 nedy did not believe that the war in Vietnam,
 could succeed as a war of white men against
 Asians.  It could not be won, he said a few
 weeks before his death, "unless the people
 [of South Vienami support the effort    .
 We can help them, we can give them equip-
 ment, we can send our men out there as ad-
 visers, but they have to win it, the people
 of Vietnam."  We have now junked this doc-
 trine.  Instead,, we have enlarged our mili-
 tarypresence                                ntil it is the only thing that
 Matters in South Vietnam, and we plan now
 to make it still larger; We have summoned
 the Saigon leaders, like tribal chieftains on
 a retainer, to a conference in an American
 state; we crowd the streets of Saigon with
 American generals (58 at last count) and
 visiting stateside dignitaries. In short, we
 have seized every opportunity to make clear
 to the world that this is an American war-
 and, in doing this, we have surely gone far to
 make the war unwinnable.
 The proposition that our real enemy in
 Vietnam is China is basic to the policy of
 widening the war.  It is the vital element
 in the Administration case.  Yet the proof
 our leaders have adduced for this proposition
 has been exceedingly sketchy and almost per-
 functory.  It has been proof by ideology and
 proof by analogy.  It has not been proof by
 reasoned argument or by concrete illustra-
 tion.
 The proof by ideology has relied on the
 syllogism that the Vietcong, North Vietnam
 and China are all  Communist states and
 therefore must be part of the same con-
 spiracy, and that, since the Vietcong are the
 weakest of the three, they must therefore
 be the spearhead of a coordinated Chinese
 plan  of  expansion.  The  Department  of
 State, in spite of what has struck most peo-
 ple as a rather evident fragmentation of the
 Communist world, has hated to abandon the
 cozy old cliches about a centralized Com-
 munist conspiracy aimed at monolithic world
 revolution.
 As late as May 9, 1965, after half a dozen
 years of public Russo-Chinese. quarreling,
 Thomas C. Mann, then No. 3 man in the de-
 partment, could talk about "instruments of
 Sino-Soviet power" and "orders from the
 Sino-Soviet military bloc." As late as Jan.
 28, 1966, the Secretary of State could still
 run on about "their world revolution," and
 again, on Feb. 18, about "the Communists"
 and their "larger design."  While the depart-
 ment may have accepted the reality of the
 Russo-Chinese schism by September, 1966,
 the predominant tone is still to regard Asian
 Communism as a homogenous system of ag-
 gression.  The premise of our policy has
 been that the Vietcong equal Hanoi and
 Hanoi equals Peking.
 Obviously, the Vietcong, Hanoi and Peking
 have interests in common and strong ideo-
 logical affinities.  Obviously, Peking would
 rejoice  in a Hanoi-Vietcong  victory.  But
 they also have divergent interests and pur-
 poses-and the divergencies may prove in the
 end to be stronger than the affinities. Re-
 cent developments in North Korea are in-
 structive.  If any country was bound to Pe-
 king by ties of gratitude, it was North Korea,
 which was preserved as an independent state
 by Chinese intervention 15 years ago.  If any
 country, today is at the mercy of Peking, it
 is again North Korea.  When North Korea
 now declares in vigorous language its inde-
 pendence of China, does anyone suppose that
 North Vietnam, imbued with historic mis-
 trust of China and led by that veteran Rus-
 sian agent Ho Chi Minh, would have been
 more slavish in its attitude toward Peking?
 The other part of the Administration case
 has been proof by analogy, especially the
 good old Munich analogy.  "I'm not the
 village idiot,  the Secretary of State recently
 confided to Stewart Alsop.  "I know Hitler
 was an Austrian and Mao is a Chinese. .
 But what is common between the two sit-
 uations is the phenomenon of aggression"
 The Vietnam war, President Johnson recent-
 ly told the American Legion, "is meant
 to  be  the  opening  salvo  in  a  series
 of bombardments or, as they are called
 in  Peking,  "wars   of   liberation."If
 this technique works this week in Vietnam
 the Administration suggests, it will be tried
 next week in Uganda and Peru.    But, if it
 is defeated in Vietnam, the Chinese will know
 that we will not let it succeed elsewhere.
 "What happens in South Vietnam," the
 President cried at Omaha. "will determine-
 yes, it will determine-whether ambitious
 and aggressive nations can use guerrilla war-
 fare  to conquer  their weaker  neighbors."
 The Secretary of State even described an ex-
 hortation made last year by the Chinese De-
 fense Minister, Marshal Lien Piao, as a blue-
 print for world conquest comparable to Hit-
 ler's "Mein Kampf."
 One thing is sure about the Vietnam rid-
 dle: it will not be solved by bad historical
 analogies.  It seems a trifle forced, for ex-
 ample, to equate a civil war in what was for
 hundreds of years the entity of Vietnam
 (Marshall Ky, after all, is a North Vietnamese
 himself) with Hitler's invasion of Austria and
 Czechoslovakia across old  and well-estab-
 lished lines of national division;  even the
 village idiot might grasp that difference.
 When President Eisenhower invoked the
 Munich analogy in 1954 in an effort to in-
 volve the British in Indochina, Prime Min-
 ister Churchill, a pretty close student of
 Munich in  his  day,  was  unmoved.   The
 Chinese have  neither the overwhelmingly
 military power nor the timetable of aggres-
 sion nor, apparently,                                                                                                                                         the pent-up mania
 for instant expansion which would justify
 the Hitler parallel.  As for the Lin Piao
 document, the Rand Corporation, which evi-
 dently read it with                                                                                                                                             more care  than  the
 State Department bothered to do, concluded
 that, far from being Mao's "Mein Kampf," it
 was a message to the Vietcong that they
 could win "only if they rely primarily on
 their own resources and their own revolu-
 tionary spirit," and that it revealed "the
 lack, rather than the extent, of Peking's past
 and present control over Hanoi's actions."
 In any case, guerrilla warfare is not a tac-
 tic to be mechanically applied by central
 headquarters  to faraway  countries.  More
 than any other form of warfare, it is depend-
 ent on conditions and opportunities within
 the countries themselves. Whether there are
 wars of national liberation in Uganda and
 Peru will depend, not on what happens in
 Vietnam, but on what happens in Uganda
 and Peru.
 One can agree that the containment of
 China will be a major problem for the next
 generation. But this does not mean that we
 must re-enact in Asia in the sixties the exact
 drama of Europe in the forties and fifties.
 The record thus far suggests that the force
 most likely to contain Chinese expansionism
 in Asia (and Africa, too) will be not Western
 intervention but local nationalism.  Some-
 times local nationalism may call on Western
 support-but not always.   Countries like
 Burma and Cambodia preserve their auton-
 omy with American assistance.  The Africans
 have dealt with the Chinese on their own.
 The two heaviest blows recently suffered by
 Peking-the destruction of the Communist
 party in Indonesia and the declaration of in-
 dependence  by  North  Korea--took  place
 without benefit of American patronage or
 rhetoric.
 In the unpredictable decades ahead, the
 most  effective  bulwark against "interna-
 tional" Communism in some circumstances
 may well be national Communism.  A ra-
 tional policy of containing China could
 have recognized that a Communist Vietnam
 under Ho might be a better instrument of
 containment than a shaky Saigon regime led
 by right-wing mandarins or air force gen-
 erals.  Had Ho taken over all Vietnam in
 1954, he might today be enlisting Soviet sup-
 port to strengthen his resistance to Chinese
 pressure-and this situation, however ap-
 palling for the people of South Vietnam,
 would obviously be better for the United
 States than the one in which we are floun-
 dering today.  And now, alas, it may be al-
 most too late: the whole thrust of United
 States policy since 1954, and more than ever
 since the bombing of the North began, has
 been not to pry Peking and Hanoi apart but
 to drive them together.

 PENN-CENTRAL MERGER
 Mr. KENNEDY of New York.  Mr.
 President, I was pleased at today's action
 by the interstate Commerce Commission
 in reaffirming its April 27 decision re-
 garding the Penn-Central merger.        The
 Commission's maintenance of Septem-
 ber 30, 1966, as the effective date of the
 merger is particularly important to the
 future of the New Haven Railroad.
 Early consummation of the merger will
 insure that continuance of the New
 Haven's vital passenger and commuter
 services is not Jeopardized by delays in
 the  Penn-Central  proceeding.  Other
 problems may well lie ahead for the New
 Haven, but the ICC's action today as-
 sures that it will not be the stumbling
 block to a longrun solution of the New
 Haven's situation.
 Today's decision is also commendable
 for its assurance that the ICC will con-
 sider further the question of indemnifi-
 cation of the Erie-Lackawanna, Dela-
 ware & Hudson, and Boston & Maine
 Railroads by the merging railroads, and
 that these three carriers will have an op-
 portunity to seek ultimate inclusion with-
 in the Penn-Central system.  As the
 Commission itself points out, further pro-
 ceedings regarding these three carriers
 will be governed by the "fair and equi-
 table" language of the Interstate Com-
 merce Act.  These three railroads pro-
 vide important transportation services
 that must not be neglected, and the Com-
 mission's  assurances  regarding  their
 future are a step forward in develop-
 ing an approach to keeping these services
 in operation.
 I have supported the concept of a
 merger between the Pennsylvania and
 New York Central Railroads since the
 time that I was Attorney General. It has
 been and is my belief that such a merger
 is the first step forward in the develop-
 ment of a modern and integrated trans-
 portation system in the eastern part of
 the United States. Such a system must
 exist if we are to satisfy the growing
 needs of this region's citizens for swift
 and efficient service from city to city and
 from city to suburb. That is why early
 consummation of the merger, with ade-
 quate provision for  inclusion of vital
 STHERS ARE NOW ALSO REVEALING
 THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNDE-
 CLARED WAR IN VIETNAM
 Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, lit-
 tle by little-trickle by trickle-the truth
 about the U.S. tragic and needless in-
 volvement in a large=scale land war in
 southeast Asia is coming to light.
 Over this last weekend, four important
 statements appeared in the public press
 showing the growing fears of an ever-
 widening group of people concerning the
 quagmire in which the United States
 finds itself enmeshed in Vietnam because
 of its rigidity of position, its failure to
 face facts, and its consistent adherence
 to preconceived misconceptions.
 Writing in the New York Times maga-
 from Hanoi, are trying to establish a Com-
 munist despotism in South Vietnam, not for
 the  Chinese but for  themselves.   Let  us
 understand that the ultimate problem here
 is not military but political.  Let us adapt
 the means we employ to the end we seek.
 In the same vein, speaking out against
 what he said was an idea fostered out-
 side of Vietnam that the conflict there
 was a "kind of holy war between two
 powerful political ideologies," U Thant,
 Secrtary General of the United Nations
 stated, as part of his annual report to
 the United Nations :
 The Vietnamese people, in particular, have
 known no peace for a quarter of a century.
 Their present plight should be the first, and
 not the last, consideration of all concerned.
 Indeed, I remain convinced that the basic
 problem in Vietnam is not one of ideology
 but one of national identity and survival.  I
 see nothing but danger in the idea, so as-
 siduously fostered outside Vietnam, that the
 conflict is a kind of holy war between two
 powerful political ideologies.
 Also, over the weekend, the Vatican an-
 nounced that Pope Paul VI would urge
 prayers on a worldwide basis. during the
 month of October as part of a peace cam-
 paign to end the war in Vietnam.  It is
 to be hoped that the prayers of the mul-
 titudes will include one for those in posi-
 tions of leadership in the administration
 to face up to the facts not only as they
 are but as they were so that our future
 course of action can be determined in the
 light of reality rather than fantasy.
 Last Saturday, September 17, 1966, an-
 other former adviser to both President
 Kennedy and President Johnson, Rich-
 ard Goodwin, speaking before the na-
 tional board of the Americans for Demo-
 cratic Action here in Washington, also
 asked that the American people face up
 to realities with respect to U.S. involve-
 ment in Vietnam.  With his knowledge
 of the inner workings of the White
 House, Mr. Goodwin called attention to
 the growing credibility gap between the
 administration and the American peo-
 ple. Speaking to this point he said :
 zine for September 18, 1966, under the
 title "A Middle Way Out of Vietnam,"
 the noted historian and former special
 assistant to both President Kennedy and
 President Johnson, Arthur Schlesinger,
 Jr., gave a striking analysis of the course
 open to the United States to extricate
 itself from its difficult position in Viet-
 nam. Professor Schlesinger points out:
 The Illusion that the war in South Viet-
 nam can be decided in North Vietnam is
 evidently a result of listening too long to
 our own propaganda.  Our Government has
 insisted so often that the war in Vietnam
 is a clear-cut case of aggression across fron-
 tiers that it has come to believe itself that
 the war was started in Hanoi and can be
 stopped there . . . Yet the best evidence Is
 that the war began as an insurrection within
 South Vietnam which, as it has  gathered
 momentum, has attracted Increasing support
 and direction from the north.  Even today
 the  North Vietnamese  regulars  in South
 Vietnam amount to only a fraction of the
 total enemy force (and to an even smaller
 fraction of the American army in South Viet-
 nam).
 About U.S. attempts at reconstruction,
 Professor Schlesinger writes:
 Much devotion and intelilgence are at pres-
 ent going into the programs of reconstruc-
 tion, but prospects are precarious so long as
 the enemy can slice through so much of
 South Vietnam with such apparent immu-
 nity; and so long as genuine programs of
 social reform threaten the vested interests
 of  the  Saigon  Government  and  of  large
 landholders.
 Professor Schlesinger's assessment of
 the reconstruction program is under-
 scored by a report appearing in the New
 York Times this morning from Saigon
 by Charles Mohr stating:
 Top South Vietnamese officials have made
 varying assessments of the pacification or
 "revolutionary development" work done so
 far in 1966.  The most optimistic was that
 performance was "not quite satisfactory," the
 bluntest that progress was "quite limited"
 and that "not much was achieved."
 Commenting on administration state-
 ments that the real enemy in Vietnam
 is  Red  China,  Professor  Schlesinger
 warns:
 The air is charged with rhetoric.  We are
 buried in statements and speeches  about
 negotiation and peace, the defense of free-
 dom and the dangers of communism, the de-
 sire to protect the helpless and compassion
 for the dying.  Much of it is important and
 sincere and well-meaning.  Some is intended
 to deceive.  Some Is deliberate lie and dis-
 tortion.  But the important thing is not what
 we are saying, but what we are doing; not

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,-SENATE      September 19. 19et
 nuo ~ureiy the real neoisolationists are those
 who have isolated the United States from its
 allies and raised the tattered standard, last
 flourished 15 years ago by Douglas MacArthur,
 of "going it alone."
 How have we managed to imprison our-
 selves                      in  this  series  of  dilemmas?  One
 reason surely is that we have somehow lost
 our understanding of the uses of power.
 Understanding of power implies above all
 precision in its application. We have moved
 away from the subtle strategy of "flexible
 response" under which the level of American
 force was graduated to meet the level of
 enemy  threat.  The  triumph  of this dis-
 criminate  employment                           of   power  was,  of
 course, the Cuban missile crisis (where the
 Joint Chiefs, as usual, urged an air assault
 on the missile bases). But President John-
 son, for all his formidable abilities, has shown
 no knack for discrimination in his use of
 power.  His technique is to try and over-
 whelm his adversary-as in the Dominican.
 Republic  and Vietnam-by  piling  on  all
 forms of power without regard to the nature
 of the threat.
 Given this weakness for the indiscriminate
 use of power, it is easy to see why the appli-
 cation of force In Vietnam has been sur-
 rendered to the workings of what an acute
 observer of the Johnson foreign policy, Philip
 Geyelin,  calls  "the  escalation  machine."
 This machine is, in effect, the momentum
 in the decision-making system which keeps
 enlarging the war "for reasons only mar-
 ginally related to military need."
 The very size and weight of the American
 military presence generate unceasing pres-
 sures to satisfy military demands.   These
 may be demands to try out new weapons;
 the London Sunday Telegraph recently ran
 an informative article comparing the Viet-
 nam war to the Spanish Civil War as a mili-
 tary testing ground and laboratory.  Or they
 may be cries for "one more step," springing
 in part from suppressed rage over the fact
 that, with military power sufficient to blow
 up the word, we still cannot compel guerrilla
 bands in black pajamas to submit to our will.
 Whatever the reason, Sir Robert Thompson
 has noted of the American theory of the war:
 "There was a constant tendency in Vietnam
 to mount large-scale operations, which had
 little purpose or prospect of success, merely
 to indicate that' something aggressive was
 being done."
 The administration has freely admitted
 that such operations, like the bombing of the
 North, are designed in part to prop up the
 morale of the Saigon Government.  And the
 Impression is growing now that they are also
 in part undertaken in order to smother
 doubts about the war In the United States
 and to reverse anti-Administration tenden-
 cies in the polls.  Americans have become
 curiously insensitive to the use of military
 operations for domestic political purposes.
 A quarter-century ago President Roosevelt

 Nor is our ignorance confined to battle-

 genuine knowledge of and insight into the
 political and cultural problems of Vietnam,

 officials in Saigon in 1962-63 regarding the

 the effectiveness of the "strategic hamlet"

 rejoice in a Hanoi-Vietcong victory. But
 they also have divergent interests and pur-
 poses-and the divergencies may prove in
 the end to be stronger than the affinities.
 Recent developments in North Korea are in-
 structive.  If any country was bound to Pe-
 king ties of gratitude, it was North Korea,
 which was preserved as an independent state
 by Chinese intervention 15 years ago.  If
 any country today is at the mercy of Peking,
 it is again North Korea.  When North Korea
 now declares in vigorous language its inde-
 pendence of China, does anyone suppose that
 North Vietnam, imbued with historic mis-
 trust of China and led by that veteran Rus-
 sian agent He Chi Minh, would have been
 more slavish in its attitude toward Peking?
 The other part of the Administration case
 has been proof by analogy, especially the
 good  old  Munich  analogy.  "I'm  not the
 village idiot," the Secretary of State recently
 confided to Stewart Alsop.  "I know Hitler
 was an Austrian and Mao is a Chinese. .. .
 But what is common between the two situa-
 tions is the phenomenon of aggression."  The
 Vietnam war, President Johnson recently
 told the American Legion, "is meant to be
 the opening salvo in a series of bombard-
 ments or, as they are called in Peking, 'wars
 of liberation.'    If this technique works this
 week in Vietnam, the Administration sug-
 gests, it will be tried next week in Uganda
 and Peru.  But, if it is defeated in Vietnam,
 the Chinese will known that we will not let
 it succeed elsewhere.
 "What happens in South Vietnam," the
 President cried at Omaha, "will determine-
 yes, it will determine-whether ambitious
 and aggressive nations can use guerrilla war-
 fare to conquer their  weaker neighbors."
 The Secretary of State even discribed an ex-
 hortation ? made last year by the  Chinese
 Defense Minister, Marshal Lin Piao, as a
 blueprint for world conquest comparable to
 Hitler's "Mein Kampf."
 One      thing  is  sure  about  the Vietnam
 riddle: it will not be solved by bad historical
 analogies.  It seems a trifle forced, for ex-
 ample, to equate a civil war in what was
 for hundreds of years the entity of Vietnam
 (Marshal Ky, after all, is a North Vietnamese
 himself)  with Hitler's Invasion of Austria
 and  Czechoslovakia  across  old  and  well-
 established line of national division;                  even
 the village idiot might grasp the difference.
 When President Eisenhower invoked the
 Munich analogy in 1954 in an effort to in-
 volve the British in Indochina, Prime Min-
 ister Churchill, a pretty close student of
 Munich  in  his  day,  was  unmoved.  The
 Chinese have  neither  the  overwhelmingly
 military power nor the timetable of aggres-
 sion nor, apparently, the pent-up mania for
 instant expansion which would justify the
 Hitler parallel. As for the Lin Piao docu-
 ment, the Rand Corporation, which evidently
 read it with more care than the State De-
 partment bothered to do, concluded that,
 far from being Mao's "Mein Kampf," it was
 a message to the Vietcong that they could
 win "only if they rely primarily on their
 own resources and their own revolutionary
 spirit,"  and  that  it  revealed  "the  lack,
 rather than the extent, of Peking's past and
 present control over Hanoi's actions."
 In. any case, guerrilla warfare is not a tac-
 tic to be mechanically applied by central
 headquarters to faraway  countries.      More
 than any other form of warfare, it is depend-
 ent on conditions and opportunities within
 the countries themselves.   Whether there
 are wars of national liberation in Uganda
 and Peru will depend, not on what happens
 in Vietnam, but on what happens in Uganda
 and Peru.
 One can agree that the containment of
 China will be major problem for the next
 generation.  But this does not mean that we
 must re-enact in Asia in the sixties the exact
 drama of Europe in the forties and fifties.
 The record thus far suggests that the force
 most likely to contain Chinese expansionism
 in Asia (and Africa, too) will be not Western
 intervention but local nationalism.  Some-
 times local nationalism may call on Western
 support-but not always.   Countries like
 Burma and Cambodia preserve their auton-
 omy  without  American                                                                   assistance.    The
 Africans have dealt with the  Chinese on
 their own.  The two heaviest blows recently
 suffered by Peking-the destruction of the
 Communist party in Indonesia and the dec-
 laration of independence by North Korea-
 took place without benefit of American pa-
 tronage or rhetoric.
 In the unpredictable decades ahead, the
 most  effective  bulwark  against  "interna-
 tional" Communism in some circumstances
 may well be national Communism.    A ration-
 al policy of containing China could have rec-
 ognized that a Communist Vietnam under
 He might be a better instrument of contain-
 ment than a shaky Saigon regime led by
 right-wing mandarins or air force generals.
 Had Ho taken over all Vietnam in 1954, he
 might today be enlisting Soviet support to
 strengthen his resistance to Chinese pres-
 sure-and this situation, however appalling
 for the people of South Vietnam, would ob-
 viously be better for the United States than
 the one in which we are floundering today.
 And now, alas, it may be almost too late: the
 whole thrust of United States policy since
 1954,'and more than ever since the bombing
 of the North began, has been net to pry
 Peking and Hanoi apart but to drive them
 together.
 Is there no way out?  Are the only alter-
 natives widening the war or disorderly and
 humiliating withdrawal? Surely, our states-
 manship is not yet this bankrupt.  I think
 a middle course is still possible if there were
 the will to pursue it.  And this course must
 begin with a decision to stop widening and
 Americanizing the war-to limit our forces,
 actions,  goals  and  rhetoric.   Instead  of
 bombing  more  places,  sending  in      more
 troops, proclaiming ever more ardently that
 the fate of civilization will be settled   in
 Vietnam,    let  us  recover our cool     and
 try to see the situation as it is: a horrid civil
 war in which Communist guerrillas, enthu-
 siastically aided and now substantially di-
 rected from Hanoi, are trying to establish a
 Communist despotism in South Vietnam,
 not for the Chinese but for themselves.  Let
 us understand that the ultimate problem
 here is not military but political.  Let us
 adapt the means we employ to the end we
 seek.
 Obviously, military action plays an indis-
 pensable role in the search for a political
 solution,  Hanoi and the Vietcong will not
 negotiate so long as they think they can win.
 Since stalemate is a self-evident precondi-
 tion to negotiation, we must have enough
 American armed force in South Vietnam to
 leave no doubt in the minds of our adversar-
 ies that they cannot hope for victory.  They
 must also have no illusion about the pros-
 pect of an American withdrawal.  The ob-
 ject of the serious opposition to the Johnson
 policy is to bring about not an American de-
 feat but a negotiated settlement.
 Therefore, holding the line in South Viet-
 nam is essential.   Surely, we already have
 enough American troops, firepower and in-
 stallations in South Vietnam to make  it
 clear that we cannot be beaten unless we
 choose to scuttle and run, which will not
 happen.  The opponents of this strategy talk
 as if a holding action would put our forces
 under siege and relinquish all initiative to
 the enemy.  This need not, of course, be so.
 It is possible to slow down a war without
 standing still; and, if our present generals
 can't figure out how to do this, then let us
 get generals who can. Generals Ridgway and
 Gavin could doubtless suggest some names.
 Moreover, there is a South Vietnamese army
 of some 600,000 men which can take all the
 initiative it wants.  And if we are told that
 the South Vietnamese are unwilling or un-
 able to fight the Vietcong, then we must
 wonder all the more about the political side
 of the war.
 The object of our military policy, as ob-
 servers like Henry Kissinger and James Mac-
 Gregor Burns have proposed, should be the
 creation and stabilization  of secure areas
 where the South Vietnamese might them-
 selves undertake social and institutional de-
 velopment.  Our resources should go, in the
 Vietnam jargon, more to clear-and-hold than
 to   search-and-destroy   (especially   when
 search-and-destroy more often means search-
 and-drive-underground).                                                                                                                                               We should get rid
 of  those  "one-star generals who,"  in  the
 words of Sir Robert Thompson, "regard their
 tour in Vietnam as an opportunity to in-
 dulge in a year's big-game shooting from
 their helicopter howdahs at Government ex-
 pense."
 At the same time we should induce the
 Saigon  Government  to  institute  generous
 amnesty provisions of the kind which worked
 so well in the Philippines.  And we should
 further increase the incentive to come over
 by  persuading the  South    Vietnamese  to
 abandon the torture of prisoners-a practice
 not only horrible in itself but superbly cal-
 culated to make the enemy fight to the bit-
 ter end.  In the meantime we must end our
 own shameful collaboration with this bar-
 barism and stop turning Vietcong prisoners
 over to the South Vietnamese when we know
 that torture is probable.
 As for bombing the North, let us taper this
 off as prudently as we can.  Bombing is not
 likely to deter Hanoi any more in the future
 than it has in the past; and, given its limited
 military effect, the Administration's desire
 to gratify the Saigon Government and the
 American voter  is  surely   not  important
 enough to justify the risks of indefinite es-
 calation.  Moreover, so long as the bombing
 continues there is no chance of serious ne-
 gotiation.  Nor does the failure of the 37-day
 pause of last winter to produce a settlement
 refute this.  Thirty-seven days were hardly
 enough to persuade our allies that we hon-
 estly wanted negotiation; so brief an inter-
 lude left no time for them to move on to the
 tricky job of persuading Hanoi.  For Hanoi
 has substantial reasons for mistrusting nego-
 tiation-quito apart from Chinese pressure
 or its own hopes of victory. He has entered
 into negotiation with the West twice in the
 past-in  1946-47  and  again in  1954-and
 each time, in his view, he lost at the confer-
 ence table things he thought he had won on
 the battlefield.
 For all our official talk about our readiness
 to go anywhere, talk to anyone, etc., it cannot
 be said that the Administration has pursued.
 negotiation with a fraction of the zeal, imag-
 ination and perseverance with which it has
 pursued war.  Indeed, some American schol-
 ars who have studied the matter believe that
 on a number of occasions when pressure for
 negotiation was mounting we have, for what-
 ever reason, stepped up the war.
 Nor can it be said that the Administra-
 tion has laid fairly before the American
 people the occasional signals, however faint,
 which have come from Hanoi,-as  in the
 early winter of 1965, when U Thant's medi-
 ation reached the point of selecting the hotel
 in Rangoon  where  the talks might  take
 place, until we killed the idea by beginning
 the bombing of the North.  Nor, for all our
 declarations about "unconditional" negotia-
 tions, have we refrained from setting con-
 ditions-such as, for example, that we won't
 talk  to  the  Vietcong  unless  they  come
 to the conference table disguised as North
 Vietnamese.    Though    the Vietcong  con-
 stitute the great bulk of the enemy force,
 they have been given little reason to think
 we will   negotiate  about   anything except
 their unconditional surrender.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE      September 19, 1966
 It is hard to see why we should not fol-
 low the precedent of Laos, when we ad-
 rotted the Pathet Lao to the peace talks,
 and offer the Vietcong the prospect of a
 say in the future political life  of South
 Vietnam-conditioned on their laying down
 their arms, opening up their territories and
 abiding by the ground rules of free elec-
 tions. Nor is there reason to see why we have
 been so reluctant again to follow the Laos
 model and declare neutralization, under in-
 ternational guarantee, our long-run objective
 for  Vietnam.   An  imaginative  diplomacy
 would long since have discussed the ways
 and means of such neutralization with Rus-
 sis,                              France,  Britain  and  other interested
 countries.  Unsatisfactory as the situation
 in Laos may be today, it is still incom-
 parably better than the situation in South
 Vietnam.
 On the other hand, negotiation is not
 an exclusive, or even primary, American re-
 sponsibility.  Along with a military stale-
 mate, the other precondition of a diplo-
 matic settlement is surely a civilian gov-
 ernment in Saigon.  Marshal Ky is one of
 those  Frankenstein's monsters we  delight
 in creating in our "client" countries, very
 much like the egregious General Phoumi
 Nosavan, who single-handedly blocked a
 settlement in Laos for two years.     Like
 Phouml, Ky evidently feels t4at Washing-
 ton has  committed  itself  irrevocably to
 him-and why should he not after the laying
 on of hands at Honolulu?-and that, what-
 ever he does, we cannot afford to abandon
 him.
 Robert Shaplen, in the August 20 issue
 of The New Yorker, reported from Saigon
 that the atmosphere there "is being com-
 pared to the miasma that surrounded Diem
 and his tyrannical brother Ngo Dinh Nhu"
 and that "many Vietnamese believe that the
 Americans, having embraced Ky so whole-
 heartedly and supported him so long, are
 just as responsible as his Government for
 the recent repressive acts."
 I am sure that President Johnson did
 not intend  to turn over American policy
 and  honor  in  Vietnam  to  Marshal  Ky's
 gimcrack, bullyboy, get-rich-quick regime.
 The time is bound to come when Ky must
 learn the facts of life, as General Phoumi
 eventually and painfully learned them.
 But why wait?   In our whole time in Viet-
 tam, there has never been a Government in
 Saigon which had the active loyalty of the
 countryside.  It might be an agreeable ex-
 periment to encourage one to come into ex-
 istence.   Instead  of  Identifying  American
 interests with Ky and rebuffing the broader
 political impulses in  South Vietnam, we
 should long since have welcomed a move-
 ment toward a civilian regime representing
 the significant political forces of the coun-
 try and capable both of rallying the army
 and carrying forward programs of social re-
 form.                         We should give such a Government
 all  possible  assistance  in  rebuilding  and
 modernizing the political and institutional
 structures of  South  Vietnam.        And  if it
 should favor the neutralization of its coun-
 try, if it should seek negotiation with the
 Vietcong, even if it should release us from
 our commitment to stay in Vietnam, we
 should not think that the world is coming
 to an end.
 It is not too late to begin the de-escalation
 of the war; nor would the reduction of our
 military effort damage our international in-
 fluence.  "There is more respect to be won
 in the opinion of this world," George Ken-
 nan has written, "by a resolute and courage-
 ous liquidation of unsound positions than by
 the most stubborn pursuit of extravagant or
 unpromising   objectives."     France   was
 stronger than ever after de Gaulle left Al-
 geria, the Soviet Union suffered no lasting
 damage from pulling it nuclear missiles out
 of Cuba.  And the policy of de-escalation
 recommended here it, of course, something
 a good deal less than withdrawal.
 De-escalation could work,  if there were
 the will to pursue it ... This is the hard
 question.   The Administration, disposed to
 the indiscriminate use of power, enmeshed
 in the grinding cogs of the escalation ma-
 chine, committed to the thesis that China
 is the enemy in Vietnam, obviously could not
 turn to de-escalation without considerable
 inner upheaval.  The issue in the United
 States in the months to come will be whether
 President Johnson's leadership is sufficiently
 resilient and forbearing to permit a change
 in the direction of policy and arrest what
 is coming increasingly to seem an accelerat-
 ing drift toward a great and unnecessary
 catastrophe.

 SAIGON To REFORM RURAL EFFORTS; MARINES
 BREAK TRAP AT DONGH-PACIFICATION As-
 f>ESSED
 (By Charles Mohr)
 SAIGON, SOUTH VIETNAM, September 18.-
 South Vietnamese officials have concluded
 that there have been serious deficiencies in
 the rural pacification program this year and
 that reforms are needed in 196'7, highly reli-
 able sources disclosed today.
 Top South Vietnamese officials have made
 varying assessments of the pacification or
 "revolutionary development" work done so
 far in 1966.  The most optimistic was that
 performance was "not quite satisfactory," the
 bluntest that progress was "quite limited"
 and that "not much was achieved."
 In general, the South Vietnamese analyses
 were more critical and pessimistic than those
 by United States officials.  The Vietnamese
 studies were not meant for publication but
 for policy planning.
 Veteran observers in Vietnam found the
 South Vietnamese official pessimism a cause
 for  optimism.  Their  reasoning  was  that
 shortcomings can he overcome only when
 they are honestly acknowledged,.
 TEAMS IMPLEMENT PROGRAM
 Under  the  rural   pacification  program,
 trained teams of workers move into selected
 rural areas and attempt to bring them firmly
 under Government control by rooting out
 the Vietcong apparatus and improving life
 in  the area, as well as  through political
 propaganda.
 Although there is a temptation to try, it is
 impossible to measure the program's progress
 statistically. The evaluation by the Vietna-
 mese officials shows why.
 They concluded, the reliable sources said,
 that more progress had been made this year
 than ever before.  But in many areas the
 following faults were discovered:
 Pacification planning at the start of the
 year by provincial officials was "unrealistic."
 Some teams were shifted from difficult and
 hostile areas to easy ones to make "better
 performance scores."
 Statistics were unreliable because pacifica-
 tion operations were in some cases "carried
 out over again many times  at the same
 number of hamlets" that had once been
 officially declared as pacified.
 Physical  security  was  not as good  as
 expected and Vietcong underground agents
 continued in some cases to collect taxes and
 carry out propaganda activities:
 The  quality  of  pacification  workers or
 "cadres," as they are called, was below ex-
 pectations.   Recruiting  met  requirements
 "in quantity but not in quality.."
 In some cases, team members were "not
 very enthusiatic toward their work" or to-
 ward the people's aspirations.  The teams
 generally stayed in their assigned areas for
 too short a time and in some cases left and
 declared them  pacified  before such judg-
 ment was realistic.
 NUMERICAL REPORT CITED
 Those                                 conclusions  cast some doubt  on
 the assertion made in a Washington report
 this week by Robert W. Komer, a special
 Presidential assistant assigned to the paci-
 fication program, that in the first six months
 of the year 531 hamlets containing 680,000
 people had been brought into the pacifica-
 tion program.
 The  South  Vietnamese  Government,     in
 planning for 1967,  is  stressing  genuine
 pacification of hamlets now only "statisti-
 cally" pacified.
 This year each of the 59-nian rural paci-
 fication  teams                                                                                                                                             was  supposed      to spend  a
 minimum of two to three months, in paci-
 fying a hamlet.                                                                                                                                          But in practice, that often
 was the maximum.
 Under a new "rhythm"   of pacification
 planned for 1967, each team is expected to
 work on no more than two or three hamlets
 in a year and may spend an entire year in
 one difficult hamlet.
 Each team will be required to leave be-
 hind a small number of men to maintain
 stability.   Thus,  by  1968 each team will
 continue  to  support  about  two    hamlets
 while undertaking the pacification of two
 more.
 Emphasis will be on well-populated ham-
 lets, on those especially susceptible to eco-
 nomic                                                                                                                                                 and  agricultural  development  and
 those with strategic positions and reason-
 ably good military security.
 The new guidelines may lead to more solid
 achievements  but will      undoubtedly slow
 down-at least on paper-the already slow
 process of pacifying all of South Vietnam's
 15,000 hamlets.
 Few tasks in public administration any-
 where in  the                                                                                                                                              world  are    so complex   and
 difficult as those assigned to the  59-man
 pacification  teams  in Vietnam.    And,  in
 some cases, they have received poor sup-
 port from other units and agencies.
 The South Vietnamese army, is said to
 resent the teams as "unmilitary" and has
 sometimes withdrawn troops without warn-
 ing, leaving teams exposed to attack by the
 Vietcong.   Teams  were  sometimes  expro-
 priated by provincial officials who used them
 as regular troops or in guard assignments,
 leaving their hamlets unshielded.
 EXCERPTS FROM  "INTRODUCTION  TO THE AN-
 NUAL REPORT"
 (By Secretary General U Thant of the United
 Nations, Sept. 15, 1966)
 X. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS
 This review of the most important devel-
 opments within the United Nations during
 the last twelve months has the usual con-
 trasts of light and shadow.  The continued
 slow rate of progress in many of our fields of
 endeavor, and the setbacks which have been
 suffered in others, can only be a cause of
 disappointment to the peoples of the world
 in whose name the Charter of the United
 Nations was written.  For this, however, they
 must not blame the Charter itself nor the
 institutions which it created.
 The weaknesses and shortcomings of the
 United Nations lie not in its constitutional
 purposes, objectives and procedures but in
 world conditions at the present juncture of
 history.  The proceedings of the Organiza-
 tion inevitably mirror the state of the rela-
 tionships between different peoples and dif-
 ferent nations and sometimes between the
 rulers and the ruled; the economic circum-
 stances under which they live;  the social
 conditions that surround them. It is in
 these realms, and not in the structure(s)
 of the United Nations, that the roots of
 the troubles of the world lie.
 The troubles arising from present condi-
 tions are abundant.  They are the preva-
 lence of narrow nationalisms, the periodic
 reliance on crude power-whether political,

 military . or economic--to serve or protect
 supposed national interests, the appalling rise
 in the quantity and destructive potential of
 nuclear armaments, the ever more serious
 gaps in economic development, the persist-
 ence of colonial domination over several
 million people, the continuing prevalence in
 many parts of the world of racial discrimi-
 nation and suppression of human rights, and,
 among populations constantly increasing,
 the widespread inadequacies of education,
 food shortages verging on famine, and lack
 of medical care.  These excesses, inequities
 and injustices-and the fears, tensions, frus-
 trations, jealousies and aggressions which
 they breed among peoples and among na-
 tions-still too_ largely condition the state
 of the world, still too strongly and adversely
 influence the national policies which Member
 States bring to bear on the work of the
 United Nations, and still too seriously ob-
 struct rather than challenge the capacity of
 the Organization to fulfill its purposes.
 in the present difficult state of interna-
 tional affairs, I believe it to be the first duty
 of the membership to face up to the fact
 that the chances of fruitful international
 co-operation on many crucial issues in which
 the United Nations has a clear responsibil-
 ity for decision and action-issues ranging
 from  disarmament  to  development-have
 been steadily and seriously impaired over the
 past two years by a situation over which,
 for well-known reasons, the United Nations
 has not been able to exercise any effective

 Nations in the difficult question of Aden
 may help to bring about a peaceful solution
 there. Beyond these questions lies the long-
 standing  conflict  between  Israel  and  the
 Arab States and the continuing need for
 passions to be restrained and the terms of
 the armistice agreements to be observed by
 all concerned.
 I shall not conceal my distress at some of
 the happenings in Africa during the last
 twelve months-not only those which have
 hardened the colonial and quasi-colonial at-
 titudes still entrenched in large parts of the
 continent, but also those involving sudden
 and violent political changes in newly inde-
 pendent States.  They have created a sense
 of instability whch can easily be misrep-
 resented or exaggerated to the disadvantage
 of Africa as a whole and, by causing an in-
 crease in tensions among African countries,
 they have produced a setback to African
 unity.  By no means all of the many prob-
 lems that the African peoples are facing are
 of their own making, but few, if any, of them
 can be solved except by the African coun-
 tries themselves  showing the  qualities  of
 maturity and restraint which they have often
 displayed, and using these qualities to en-
 danger the greater spirit of co-operation and
 willingness to work together, which is essen-
 tial to  the fulfilment of Africa's destiny.
 This task is so important that Governments
 and peoples must put above everything else
 a willingness to sink their differences in the
 higher interests of Africa and of the world
 22131
 parts of the world, point to the need for a
 stronger rather than a weaker United Na-
 tions, and one which can be relied upon to
 undertake peace-keeping operations wherever
 such action could help in the restoration of
 stable conditions.  Unfortunately, although
 there seems to be a measure of agreement
 that these operations have been effective in
 the past and could prove useful in the future,
 we are still far from agreement on basic prin-
 ciples.  I very much hope that, in the months
 to come, the general membership and in par-
 ticular those Members who have a special
 responsibility with regard to the maintenance
 of international peace and security, may find
 it possible, within the Charter, to agree upon
 the procedures to be followed in launching
 such operations, the responsibility of the
 various organs in their actual conduct, and
 the financial arrangements by which the ex-
 penditures involved may be met.   I must
 draw attention, to the fact that the peace-
 keeping activities of the United Nations, per-
 haps more than any other part of its work,
 have enabled the Organization to gain a
 measure of public confidence which is in
 danger of being lost if the Member States re-
 main deadlocked on the constitutional and
 financial questions involved.
 I should like to add, in this connexion,
 that I believe that regional organizations
 will have an important role to play in future
 in reducing tensions within their regions and
 in promoting co-operative efforts to attain
 common ends.  The work of the United Na-
 tions at the regional level in the economic
 and social fields has won universal acclaim;
 the original economic commissions have be-
 come increasingly effective in helping the
 developing countries not merely through re-
 search and studies but also by direct opera-
 tional activities including those which have
 led to the establishment of economic and
 social planning institutes and development
 banks.  The work of inter-governmental're-
 gional bodies outside the United Nations can
 also, I am sure, contribute to the solution of
 problems between countries within a region.
 However, there are certain questions of juris-
 diction and competence which arise with re-
 gard to the maintenance of international
 peace and security, especially in the peace-
 keeping field, and concerning which the role
 of the regional organizations requires clearer
 definition.  Some time ago, I suggested that
 a. study of the functioning of regional orga-
 nizations in terms of their respective char-
 ters might be useful, and I mention it again
 in the belief that Governments should wish
 to follow it up.
 It is as important for a stronger United
 Nations to continue the long-term task of
 building the peace as it is to equip itself for
 helping countries to keep the peace.  It is
 not enough, in my opinion, for the United
 Nations to deal where it can, and as the case
 arises,  with  each  specific  problem that
 threatens world peace.    The causes of ten-
 sion in the world have to be attacked at all
 of their many roots.  We have the means of
 doing so, and we have made a start.   While
 for example, the international activities in
 the fields of economic and social develop-
 ment and human rights do not figure in the
 headlines, the fact is that the greater part
 of the resources of the United Nations and
 its family of agencies is devoted to these
 tasks.  The manner in which they are un-
 dertaken has a direct relationship to the re-
 duction of tensions.  I have said many times
 that it is essential that the gulf between the
 rich and the poor countries should be nar-
 rowed:                                                                                                                                I attach the greatest importance to
 the Governments of Member States taking
 seriously the goals of the United Nations De-
 velopment Decade,  and making deliberate
 progress towards the achievement of these
 goals.
 There are other causes of tension which
 cannot be left to resolve themselves.  In par-

 ticular, I feel that the United Nations must
 make a sustained attack on the problems
 which we might, because of their origin or
 their nature, describe as the problems of
 Colonialism.  While recognizing that sub-
 stantial progress has been made, we cannot
 afford to forget that the process of decoloni-
 zation has not been completed.. A hard core
 of actual colonialism still exists, particularly
 in Africa.  It is coupled with the kindred
 problem of racial discrimination, and this
 evil in turn subjects the majority of the
 population of one of the largest independent
 States in Africa to conditions akin to the
 wdrst type of colonial subjection.  I believe
 that in these situations there lies a great
 opportunity for statesmanship on the part of
 the colonial Powers-an opportunity which
 they must seize before it is too late.
 It is impossible, moreover, to view some
 of these outstanding problems -whether it
 is the position of the United Nations in re-
 gard to the crisis in South-East Asia or the
 lack of progress in disarmament-without
 relating them to the fact that the United
 Nations has not yet attained the goal of uni-
 versality of membership. In the long run the
 Organization cannot be expected to function
 to full effect if one fourth of the human race
 is not allowed to participate in its delibera-
 tions. I know that there are serious political
 difficulties involved in correcting this situa-
 tion; but I hope that the long-term advant-
 ages may be more clearly seen and the neces-
 sary adjustments made.
 This process may take some further time.
 Meanwhile, I feel that all countries should
 be encouraged and enabled, if they wish to
 do so, to follow the work of the Organization
 more closely.  It could only be of benefit to
 them and to the United Nations as a whole
 to enable them to maintain observers at
 Headquarters, at the United Nations Office at
 Geneva and in the regional economic com-
 missions, and to expose them to the impact
 of the work of the Organization and to the
 currents and cross-currents of opinion that
 prevail within it, as well as to give them some
 opportunity to contribute to that exchange.
 Such  contacts  and  inter-communication
 would surely lead to a better understanding
 of;:the problems of the world and a more
 realistic approach to their solution,  In this
 matter I have felt myself obliged to follow
 the established tradition by which only cer-
 tain governments have been enabled to main-
 tain observers.  I commend this question for
 further examination by. the General Assembly
 so that the Secretary-General may be given a
 clear directive as to the policy to be followed
 in the future in the light, I would hope, of
 these observations.
 The United Nations is an experiment in
 multilateral international diplomacy.  Gov-
 ernments maintain here Permanent Repre-
 sentatives who have to carry out instruc-
 tions understandably designed to promote
 the political and other interests of the Gov-
 ernments concerned.  At the same time,
 however, these Governments have subscribed
 to the principles and ideals of the Charter
 and they have to recognize that one of its
 basic purposes is to be "a centre for bar-
 monizing  the  actions of  nations"  in the
 attainment of the common ends for which
 the United Nations was established. I am
 glad that in most cases the representatives
 of Member States do not, in their pursuit
 of national interests, forget the larger in-
 terests of humanity represented by this
 Organization.  I personally believe that it
 should be possible for the Governments of
 Member  States in all 'cases to use the
 United Nations as a centre for harmonizing
 their actions so that the Interests of hu-
 manity may not suffer but may be properly
 served,
 In  these observations. I have  stressed
 some of the basic beliefs which I have held
 in. the discharge of my functions as Secre-
 tary-General over the last fifty-eight months.
 I feel that this is an appropriate occasion
 for me to urge that the problems to which
 I have referred and the suggestions which
 I have made deserve careful consideration
 if the Organization is to be strengthened, if
 peace is to be preserved and promoted, and
 if we are to make real progress towards the
 goal of the economic and social advancement
 of all peoples. There are many ways of reach-
 In.g these objectives of peace and well-being,
 and I do not believe that anyone should adopt
 a dogmatic approach to them.  Conditions
 differ widely from country to country and
 each bats the right, within the broad frame-
 work of the principles of the United Na-
 tions, to pursue its goals in its own way
 and by means which it judges most appro-
 priate and fruitful.  At the same time I
 believe that the ideological differences that
 have divided the world are beginning to
 show signs of losing their sharp edge, and
 I approach the end of my term of office with
 some confidence that, over the years, the
 United Nations will prove to be the means
 by which mankind will be able not only to
 survive, but also to achieve a great human
 synthesis.

 PAPAL PLEA FOR PEACE
 VATICAN     CITY.-Pope  Paul  VI will urge
 worldwide prayers in October as part of a
 new peace campaign to try to end the war
 in Viet Nam, the Vatican announced yester-
 day.
 The Vatican said the Pope will issue an
 ancyclical letter to the world's bishops Mon-
 day urging special prayers next month-the
 month of the Holy Rosary.
 An authoritative source said world peace
 would be foremost among the subjects rec-
 ommended for prayer and that the pontiff
 had given Viet Nam much serious thought
 during the two months he spent at his sum-
 mer residence in Castel Gandolfo.  He re-
 turned to the Vatican yesterday afternoon.
 The source said the Pope felt this was the
 time for a new peace campaign, but his ac-
 tion is expected to be chiefly religious in na-
 ture rather than a specific suggestion to
 statesmen or a sensational gesture.
 The Pope, who has been in Castel Gandolfo
 since July 16, returned to the Vatican yes-
 terday afternoon.  Some sources speculated
 he might start his push for peace in an in-
 formal speech from his window overlooking
 St. Peter's Square today.
 "There has been a spate of rumors that
 something big is coming up," the Source said,
 "but it would appear that a mediation offer
 or a peace-making trip to one of the coun-
 tries concerned is out of the question for the
 time being.   A call for worldwide prayer
 would seem more likely."
 "If the Pope, has some specific suggestion
 to make, beyond those he made in the past,
 he might do so later in a public speech or
 through diplomatic channels.  But an ap-
 peal for prayers seems certain to be the first
 step."
 APOSTOLIC LETTER
 The call could take the form of an apostolic
 letter to the world's bishops or a message
 asking all Catholics to pray for world peace
 during October,  the "month of the Holy
 Rosary."
 The sources said the Viet Nam war and
 other threatening developments such as the
 great purge in Red China were one of the
 Pope's main concerns during his two-month
 stay in Castel Gandolfo.
 Another was  the  question of  possible
 changes in the church's ban on artificial
 birth control, on which a papal pronounce-
 ment may be forthcoming before the end of
 the year.
 Pope Paul scored one victory by bringing
 about a short-lived Christmas truce in Viet
 Narn?last winter.
 In ?recent months, the Pope put aside his
 public pronouncements on Viet Nam to con-
 centrate  on  such other  problems as  the
 famine in India.  But Vatican sources said-
 he was still quietly exploring all chances to
 end the southeast Asian war and was ready
 to act "whenever it appears a gesture
 part could prove helpful."
 EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH BY RICHARD GOODWIN
 BEFORE AMERICANS FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION,
 SEPTEMBER 17, 1966, WASHINGTON, D.C.
 There is, however, another issue which has
 reduced discussions about domestic America
 to academic discourse, which has swallowed
 up the New Frontier and Great Society, and
 which is eroding our position throughout
 the world.  That issue if, of course, the war
 in Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese war is, I believe, the most
 dangerous conflict since the end of World
 War II: more dangerous than Berlin or even
 Korea.  In those confrontations the danger
 was clear and sensibly appraised.  The stakes
 were fairly obvious to both sides. Objectives
 were carefully limited; and power ultimately
 became the handmaiden of reason and final
 accomodation.   In Vietnam, on the other
 hand, the dangers are confused and unclear.
 Objectives are expressed in vague generalities
 which  open     to  endless  vistas.   Moreover,
 from other cold war confrontations there
 evolved a set of tacit understandings de-
 signed to limit conflict even while it was be-
 ing waged.                                                                                                                                              That, for example, is the real
 meaning of the no-sanctuary policy carefully
 observed, we should remember, by both sides.
 Today those understandings are in grave
 danger of being swept away, and with them
 our most important protections against en-
 larging conflict.
 The air is charged with rhetoric.  We are
 buried in statements and speeches about
 negotiation and peace, the defense of free-
 dom and the dangers of communism, the
 desire to protect the helpless and compassion
 for the dying.  Much of it is important and
 sincere and well-meaning.  Some is intended
 to deceive.  Some of is deliberate lie and
 distortion.  But the important thing is not
 what we are saying, but what we are doing;
 not what is being discussed, but what is
 happening.
 And what is happening is not confusing
 or unclear or contradictory at all.  It is not
 masked  in obscruity or buried in secret
 archives.  It stands in clear, vivid and tower-
 ing relief against the landscape of conflict.
 The war is getting larger.   Every month
 there are more men in combat, more bombs
 falling, greater expenditures, deeper commit-
 ments.  It is the steady inexorable course of
 this conflict since its beginning.  We have
 gone to the United Nations' and the war
 has grown larger.  We have offered funds
 for development and talked of social reform;
 and the war has grown larger.  We have pre-
 dicted victory and called for compromise;
 and the war has grown larger.
 There is therefore, little escape from the
 conclusion that it will grow larger still.
 Nor Is this steady pattern the consequence
 of inexorable historical forces.  It flows from
 the decisions of particular men in particular
 places-in Washington and Hanoi, in Saigon
 and in the jungle headquarters of the Viet-
 cong.  It is in part a product of communist
 hope and drive for victory; but it is partly
 our  decision too.   And we must suppose
 those same decisions will continue to be
 made.
 Nor is this, as we are sometimes told, be-
 cause there is no alternative.   There are
 dozens of alternatives.   There are enclave
 programs, and programs to hold the centers
 of population.  There are suggestions that
 we rely on pacification of the countryside
 rather than the destruction of the Vietcong.
 There are proposals to limit the bombing or
 to end it.  There are proposals for negotia-
 tions, complete with all the specifics of pos-

 sible agreement.  The fact is the air is full
 of alternatives.  They have simply been re-
 jected in favor of another course; the present
 course.  And we must also suppose they
 will continue to be rejected.
 All prohecy is an exercise in probability.
 With that caution let us try to strip the
 argument of its necessary passion and dis-
 cuss the probabilities which are compelled
 by the awesome logic of the course of events
 in Vietnam.  Passion is important; it lies at
 the root of war and of hatred of war.  Nor do
 I lack personal feeling; for only the strong-
 est of feelings could impel me to discuss a
 subject with which I was so recently con-
 nected in so intimate a way.  Yet we can
 perhaps now meet more productively on the
 common ground of reason.  Rarely has there
 been greater need for such unity among men
 of good will.
 In other places I have set forth my per-
 sonal views on the conduct of the war in
 South Vietnam: The belief that we have an
 important stake in Southeast Asia, and that
 we must continue the battle in the South-
 although differently than we are now doing-
 until a political settlement is reached. And
 I have, like many others, discussed alterna-
 tive routes to these objectives.  Today, how-
 ever, I would like to talk about the lengthen-
 ing shadow of the war in the North; for in
 that war are the swiftly germinating seeds
 of the most grave danger.
 In this, as in so many aspects of the war,
 much of the information which feeds judg-
 ment is deeply obscured. Of course, in times
 of armed conflict facts are often elusive and
 much information, of necessity, cannot be
 revealed.   By its nature war is hostile to
 truth.  Yet with full allowance for neces-
 sary uncertainties I believe there has never
 been such intense and widespread deception
 and confusion as that which surrounds this
 war.    The continual downpour of contradic-
 tions,                mistatements,  and  kaleidoscopically
 shifting attitudes has been so torrential that
 it has almost numbed the capacity to separ-
 ate,truth from conjecture or falsehood.
 At one time we are told there is no military
 solution, and then that victory can be ours.
 There are months when we talk about
 negotiations and months when we forget
 them.
 There are times when dissenters give aid
 and comfort to the enemy and times when
 they are acting in the greatest of our tradi-
 tions.
 We have been reassured about efforts to
 reach a peaceful settlement when there is
 no plan or program for settlement in exist-
 ence.                -
 We are given endless statistics with a nu-
 merical precision which only masks the fact
 they are based on inadequate information, or
 guesses, or even wishful thinking.  For ex-
 ample, if we take the numbers of enemy we
 are supposed to be killing, add to that the
 defectors, along with a number of wounded
 much less than our own ratio of wounded
 to killed, we find we are wiping out virtually
 the entire North Vietnamese force every year.
 This truly makes their continued resistance
 one of the marvels of the world.  Unless the
 figures are wrong, which of course they are.
 We are told the bombing is terribly costly
 to North Vietnam.  Yet the increase in So-
 viet" and Chinese aid, since the bombing, is
 far greater, in economic terms, than the loss
 through bombing.   Except in human life,
 the North Vietnamese are showing a profit.
 At the time of the Hanoi-Haiphong bomb-
 ings last June we were told that in the first
 six months of 1966 enemy truck movement
 had doubled, the infiltration of supplies was
 up 150%, and infiltrated personnel increased
 120%.  However, the fact is we do not know,
 except inthe most vague and general way,
 how much supplies are being brought in or
 how many men.  They move at night, some-
 times on trails we have not yet discovered,
 and the best intelligence gives only the most
 vague picture.  We could not only be wrong,
 but enormously wrong.  The swiftness with
 which we change our estimates helps show
 that seeming exactness conceals large uncer-
 tainties.
 The statements which followed the Hanoi-
 Haiphong bombings are an illuminating ex-
 ample of this process in action.
 It was said the raids would destroy a large
 proportion of North Vietnam's fuel capacity
 and this would help paralyze-or at least
 slow down-the process of infiltration.  Yet
 these raids had been anticipated, alternative
 techniques of providing fuel had been de-
 veloped, and the raids were destind to have
 little if any effect on the North Vietnamese
 capacity to make war.  And this was clear
 at the time we bombed.
 We were told, in an inside story in the
 New York Times, that the bombings would
 prove to Hanoi it could not count on its
 allies.  The fact is that aid was stepped up
 as we anticipated it would be.
 Within a few days a high official said fresh
 intelligence  showed  that Hanoi  was  now
 plunged in gloom, weary of war, and suf-
 fused with a sense of hopelessness, presum-
 ably at least in part as a result of the raids.
 'Yet, there was no substantial intelligence of
 this kind.    We have heard little about it
 since.  And   recent  information  indicates
 that the opposite was the case-the enemy's
 will was strengthened.
 The truth is that this major and spectac-
 ular escalation in the war had had little
 measurable effect on the enemy's capacity or
 morale, and most of those who looked at the
 matter seriously in advance of the bombing
 knew it would probably be ineffective.
 Yet despite confusion and misstatement,
 despite the enormous difficulty of grasping
 the realities on which policy must be based,
 I believe we can know that further escalation
 of the war in the North will only bring us
 farther from settlement and closer to serious
 danger of a huge and devastating conflict.
 We began the campaign of bombing in the
 North as a result of the enormous and un-
 resolved difficulties of winning the real war,
 the war in the South.
 As predicted by almost every disengaged
 expert,  from  General  Ridgway to  George
 Kennan; and as taught by the whole history
 of aerial warfare, that bombing has neither
 brought the enemy to his knees or to the
 council table. It has not destroyed his ca-
 pacity to make war, or seriously slowed down
 either infiltration or the flow of supplies.  At
 each step it was claimed the bombing would
 make a decisive difference.  Yet it has made
 hardly any difference at all.   In fact, the
 tempo of conflict has increased.
 The  official  statements    justifying      the
 Hanoi-Haiphong raids bore partial witness to
 the futility of bombing.     We were told the
 raids were necessary because infiltration had
 increased enormously; and official admission
 of the failure of one of the most intensive
 bombing campaigns in world history.  De-
 spite thousands upon thousands of raids
 more men and supplies are flowing South
 and the routes of infiltration have been wid-
 ened and improved.  Despite the bombing,
 or perhaps because of it, all signs indicate
 the North Vietnamese will to fight has stiff-
 ened and the possibilities of negotiation have
 dimmed.  Despite the bombing, or because
 of it, North Vietnam has become increasingly
 dependent upon Russia and China.  Despite
 the bombing, or because of it there has been
 a vastly increased supply of aid to North
 Vietnam by Russia and China and a deepen-
 ing world communist commitment to this
 war.
 In short the bombing has been a failure,
 and may turn out to be a disaster.
 Yet we once again hear voices calling for
 further escalation; just as each previous
 time that the bombing has failed we have
 been told that more bombing 1s necessary
 and new goals are articulated.  First it was
 said we wanted to stop infiltration.  Next,
 we would persuade the North Vietnamese to
 come to the Council table.  Then we would
 punish them and force them to surrender.
 Now men are talking of the need to destroy
 their capacity to make war. And so we move
 inexorably up the ladder of failure toward
 widening devastation.  And the latest goal,
 the destruction of enemy capacity, if ever
 adopted, will be the most vaguely ambitious
 of all.  For such capacity rests on the entire
 society; and that whole society;  factories,
 dams, power plants, cities themselves must
 be brought tumbling down.
 All of this is possible despite the fact that
 each future escalation will probably have
 the effect of previous escalations.   It will
 increase the dangers of wider war,  lessen
 the chances of a negotiated settlement, drain
 away effort which should be concentrated
 in the South, and further alienate our allies,
 and have little damaging effect on the ene-
 my's ability or will to fight.
 We are sometimes asked what else we can
 do.  I believe there are other things to do.
 The war can be fought more effectively in
 the South.  The search for a settlement can
 be  given  greater direction and brilliance.
 We can prepare ourselves, if necessary, to
 accept a long ground war of attrition lead-
 ing ultimately to a political settlement. But
 that is not the question.  If the bombing
 cannot win the war, if it does not work; and
 above all if it carries tremendous political
 and military risks, then it should not be
 increased, either out of frustration with the
 war or with the polls.
 For the greatest danger of this course-
 the course of escalation-is not only in the
 extent of devastation and death, or the dam-
 age it does to the hope of peaceful solution,
 but the fact that each step of the way in-
 creases in vast proportion the danger of a
 huge and bloody conflict.  If North Vietnam
 is devastated then all reason for restraint
 or compromise is gone.  The fight is no long-
 er a way for the South but a struggle for
 survival calling their still largely uncom-
 mitted armies and people into battle.  Nor
 can China stand by and see its ally destroyed.
 I do not believe China wants to fight the
 United States, at least not yet; but it cannot
 stand by while we destroy North Vietnam.
 To do so would forfeit all its claim to moral
 and political leadership of militant commu-
 nism.  They would then be truly a paper
 dragon, stoking the fires of revolution only
 when Chinese blood and land was not at
 stake.
 Nor is China's entrance likely to be sig-
 nalled by a huge and dramatic sweep of
 armies across the frontier.  It is far more
 likely  that  increasing  destruction  in  the
 North will stimulate or compel the Chinese
 to accelerate the nature and kind of their
 assistance.   Perhaps Chinese pilots will be-
 gin to fly air defense over Hanoi.  The num-
 ber of Chinese troops in North Vietnam may
 be greatly increased.  Chinese anti-aircraft
 crews may be placed throughout the country.
 Thus, step by step, China acting in response
 to seeming necessities, may become involved
 in a war it did not fully contemplate, much
 as we have.  And there are many signs that
 this process has already begun.  This is the
 most ilkely and grave route to enlarging con-
 flict.  And if China does enter we must bomb
 them, for certainly we will not permit them
 sanctuaries or, if it comes to that, engage
 their armies solely in the jungles of South-
 east Asia.  And lastly is the Soviet Union,
 forced to choose between China and America.
 None of this is certain.  An entirely dif-
 ferent course is possible.                                                                                                                            Yet the danger of
 such a chain of events grows by immeasur-
 able strides each time we enlarge the war in
 the North: and if past is prologue we will
 continue that enlargement.  Yet the fan-
 tastic fact, the truth that challenges belief,
 is that this is being done although virtually
 no one remains beside some of the engaged

 military and a few men in the State Depart-
 ment-virtually no one in the Administra-
 tion or out=who believes that increased
 bombing will have a decisive effect on the
 war in South Vietnam.  We are taking likely
 and mounting risks in pursuit of an elusive,
 obscure, marginal, and chimercial hope; a
 course which defies reason and experience
 alike.
 Yet I believe this is the way we are going;
 that only beneficent and uncertain fortune
 tail bar the way.  This is not a belief born
 of personal fear.  After all, we, or most of
 us,' will continue to work and prosper, hold
 meetings and make speeches, unless all of
 our civilization is swallowed up.  Bven then
 enough will survive for the race to evolve and
 perhaps create something finer.    It is rather
 a belief born of a fallible reason and analysis,
 always better able to describe our situation
 than guide our action, which seeks in the
 acts of our past and the attitudes of our
 present a guide for our future.
 I do not wish however, to come with a
 counsel of despair.  The surest guarantee of
 misfortune  is  resignation.  Therefore,  we
 must all make what effort we can.      There
 are enormous differences among the critics
 of 'the war. There are those who believe we
 have no interest in Vietnam or even in all of
 Asia.  There are those who wish us to with-
 draw.                          There are fierce debates over the his-
 tory of the war, the nature of its partici-
 pants, the goals of our enemies.  There are
 those, like myself, who believe we should
 carry on the war in the South while intensi-
 fying, modifying and sharpening the search
 for peaceful  compromise  tied to  some
 measures of de-escalation in the North. Yet
 our danger is so grave that those who fear
 the future even more than they distrust the
 past-a group which encompasses, I believe,
 the majority of the American people-must
 seek some common ground rather than dis,-
 sipating energies in exploring the varieties of
 dissent.  Without sacrificing individual views
 we must also shape a unified stand, a focal
 point of belief and action which can unite
 all who apprehend coming dangers.  Only in
 this way can we create a voice strong enough
 to be heard across the country, bringing to-
 gether men of diverse beliefs, adding strength
 to the views of those in government who
 share this apprehension.  It must also be a
 clear and direct stand; one that fires re-
 sponse in those millions of our fellow citizens
 who  glimpse  through  complexity,  discord
 and obscurity the vision of something dark
 and dangerous.
 I believe there is such a position.  It is
 simply the victorious slogan of the Demo-
 cratic Party in 1964.  It is: No wider war.
 It is to oppose any expansion of the bomb-
 ing.                   It is to speak and work against all
 who would enlarge the war in the North.
 Such a stand will not end the war in
 South Vietnam.  It may even prolong it.
 It will not fully answer the deep objections,
 feelings and fears of many in this room or
 across the country.  But it can crystallize
 the inarticulate objections of many.  It may
 well increase the weight and impact of the
 forces of restraint. Most importantly it
 strikes at the most ominous menace to the
 lives of millions and the peace of the world.
 Such a rallying cry requires compromise, the
 willingness to seek less than is desired; but
 that is the basic necessity of those who
 seek not self indulgence but to shape the
 course of this nation.
 To be most effective this position will re-
 quire more than speeches and resolutions.
 It will need structure and purpose.  I sug-
 gest                   this  organization  work  with  other
 xoups and individuals to form a national
 committee against widening of the war. It
 will not be aimed at withdrawal or even
 a lessening of the war in the South; although
 individuals who oppose escalation may also
 hold those views.  Thus it will be open to
 all groups who oppose escalation in the
 North regardless of their position on other
 issues, and will be open to the millions of
 Americans who belong to no group but who
 share this basic belief and  apprehension.
 Such a committee can provide a constant flow
 of objective information about Vietnam. It
 can keep vigil over official statements and
 ask the hard questions which might help
 separate wishful thinking from facts.  It will
 neither be against the Administration nor
 for it, neither with any political party or
 opposed to it, neither liberal nor conserva-
 tive.  Its sole aim will be to mobilize and
 inform the American people in order to in-
 crease the invisible weight of what I be-
 lieve to be the American majority in the
 deliberations and inner councils of govern-
 ment.  Its purpose is to help the President
 and others in government by providing a
 counter pressure  against  those  who  urge
 a more militant course; a pressure for which
 those in government should be grateful since
 it will help them pursue the course of wise
 restraint.
 Although I believe deeply in this proposal
 I do not wish to give the argument a cer-
 tainty I do not have.  The most important
 fact of all, the unknown which transcends all
 debate, are the thoughts and intentions of
 our adversaries and their allies.  'Yet skepti-
 cism born of imperfect knowledge cannot
 be permitted to dull the passion with which
 we pursue convictions or the fervor of our
 dissent.  For we must fight against fulfill-
 m.ent of Yeats' prophecy which foresaw de-
 struction if the time should come when "the
 best lack all conviction, and the worst are
 full of passionate intensity."
 Some have called upon us to mute or
 stifle dissent in the name of patriotism and
 the national interest.  It is an argument
 which monstrously misconceives the nature
 and pr cess and the greatest strength of
 American democracy.  It denies the germinal
 assumption of our freedom: that each in-
 dividual not only can but must judge the
 wisdom of his leaders.   (How marvelously
 that principle has strengthened this coun-
 try--never more drastically than in the post-
 war period when others have buried con-
 tending views under the ordained wisdom
 of the state, thus allowing received error
 to breed weakness and even defeat.  The
 examples are legion,  The virgin lands set-
 tlement and the Great Leap Forward failed
 because experiment was made into unchal-
 lengeable law; while we began to' catch up in
 space,  modernized  and  increased  our de-
 fenses, and started the Alliance for Progress
 because what began as dissent became na-
 tional purpose).                                                                                        Of course the enemy is
 glad to see our divisions.  But our concern
 is with America not Hanoi.     Our concern
 is with those millions of our own people,
 and with future generations, who will them-
 selves be glad to see that there were men who
 struggled  to prevent needless  devastation
 and thus added to the strength and the
 glory of the United States.
 Among the greatest names in our history
 were men who did not hesitate to assault the
 acts and policies of government when they
 felt the good of the nation was at stake:
 Jefferson at a time when the integrity of the
 new nation was still in doubt, Lincoln during
 the Mexican war, Roosevelt in the midst of
 national depression, John F. Kennedy among
 cold war defeats and danger.
 Only a dozen years ago, in 1954, another
 American leader assaulted our policy in Viet-
 nam, saying "The United States is in clear
 danger of being left naked and alone in a
 hostile world ...  It is apparent only that
 American foreign policy has never in all Its
 history suffered such a stunning reversal.
 What is American policy in Indochina?  All
 of us have listened to the dismal themes of
 reversal and confusions' and alarms and ex-
 cursions which have emerged from Wash-
 ingtoin . . . We have been caught bluffing by
 our enemies.  Our friends and allies are
 September 19, .1966
 frightened and wondering, as we do, where
 we are headed ... The picture of our coun-
 try needlessly weakened in the world'. today
 is so painful that we should turn our eyes
 from abroad and look homewards."
 It is in this same spirit of concern for our
 country that we should conduct our dissent
 as, on that day, did Lyndon B. Johnson then
 leader of the minority party.
 It is not our privilege, but our duty as
 patriots, to write, to speak, to organize, to
 oppose any President and any party and any
 policy at any time which we believe threatens
 the grandeur of this nation and the well-
 being of its people.  This is such it time.
 And in so doing we will fulfill the most
 solemn duty of free men in a free country:
 to fight to the limit of legal sanction and the
 most spacious possibilities of our constitu-
 tional freedoms for the safety and greatness
 of their country as they believe it to be.
 The arguments of this speech have been
 practical ones founded, to the limits of my
 capacity and knowledge, upon the concrete
 and specific realities and dangers of our pres-
 ent situation.  But there is more than that
 in the liberal faith.  American liberalism has
 many faces.  It pursues divergent paths to
 varied and sometimes conflicting goals.  It
 cannot be captured in an epigram or sum-
 marized in a simple statement of belief.                                                                                                                                           Part
 of it, however, is simply and naively it belief
 in belief.  It is the idealistic, visionary and
 Impractical faith that action and policy and
 politics must rest on the ancient and rooted
 values of the American people.  It still be-
 lieves that for a nation to be great, to serve
 its own people and to command the respect
 and trust of others, it must not only do
 something but stand for something.  It must
 represent in speech and act in ideals of its
 society and civilization.
 Some part of the conflict in Vietnam may
 have been unavoidable, some is the result of
 well-intentioned error, but some must surely
 flow from the fact we have bent belief to
 the demands of those who call themselves
 realists or tough minded.
 It is not realistic or hard-headed to solve
 problems and Invest money and use power
 unguided by ultimate aims and values.  It
 is thoughtless folly.  For it ignores the re-
 alities of human faith and passion and de-
 sire; forces ultimately more powerful than
 all the calculations of economists and gen-
 erals.  Our strength is in our spirit and our
 faith. If we neglect this we may empty our
 treasuries,  assemble our armies and pour
 forth the wonders of our science, but we will
 act in vain and we will build for others.
 It is easy to be tough when toughness
 means coercing the weak or rewarding the
 strong; and when men of power and influence
 stand ready to applaud.  It is far harder to
 hold  to  principle,  speaking,  if  necessary,
 alone against the multitude, allowing others
 to make their own mistakes, enduring the
 frustration of long and inconclusive strug-
 gles, and standing firm for ideals even when
 they bring danger.    But it is the true path
 of courage.  It is the only path of wisdom.
 And it is the sure path of effective service
 to the United States of America.
 CONCLUSION OF MORNING

 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  Is there further morning busi-
 ness?  If not, morning business is con-
 cluded.

 "In short, most that was lovely has been
 made hideous and riches have been squan-
 dered.  It is a late chapter in the sad his
 tory of so many North Shore harbors."
 There are still a piddling 40 acres of pro-
 ductive wetlands left in Mt. Sinai Harbor.
 Dr. Murphy and others trying to save the
 last  remains of a rich natural asset are
 fighting now to  save  those last 40  acres
 from the dredge.
 Brookhaven Town wants to enlarge the
 harbor, dredging the area for commercial
 sand and gravel-with the spoil materials to
 be dumped on Cedar Beach-and also to dig
 a 200-foot wide channel to a boat yard on
 the landward end of the harbor.
 The U.S. Department of Interior's Fish
 and Wildlife  Service in recent years was
 given authority to speak up on conserva-
 tion questions like the dredging permit.
 Summarized,     their answer to the  town
 says:
 The dredger mining gravel In the harbor
 now has "operated outside the area covered
 by the permit and excavated to a depth ex-
 ceeding that authorized."
 A February 1965 report, the federal service
 pointed out, "stated that dredging and fill-
 ing in Mount Sinai Harbor has already
 caused Incalculable loss," that "this often-
 extended permit (for gravel mining) was re-
 sponsible for a large part of these losses."
 And the report sums up, "sacrifice of an
 additional 40 acres of salt marsh and salt
 water wetlands does not seem warranted by
 the need for additional anchorage for boats,
 inasmuch as a very deep harbor has already
 been created accompanied by the destruc-
 tion of over 100 acres of irreplaceable estua-
 rine habitat."
 The report Is buttressed by facts garnered
 in on-the-spot investigations which showed
 that silt from dredging was causing damage
 and that more wetland was sliding into deep
 potholes gouged by the dredge.
 The federal expert's findings urge that the
 gravel dredging permit be denied.  They also
 urge that the boat channel     dredging re-
 quest be denied.
 .Instead, the experts say, a 100-foot wide
 channel to the boat yard, no more than six
 feet deep, should be created largely by using
 a longer path of existing natural channels.
 Those findings will be part of the testi-
 mony next Oct. 7 when the Army Corp of
 Engineers holds a unique hearing-only the
 second on Long Island in recent years-on
 whether or not to grant permission for the
 dredging.
 The unusual 10 a.m. session at Port Jef-
 ferson High School was set up because a
 valiant  handful  of  conservationists,  like
 Dr. Murphy, demanded a chance to be heard
 publicly.
 They are still working wetlands in Mt.
 Sinai  Harbor  that  produce food for    fish,
 fish for the water and shore birds  that fre-
 quent the harbor, fish for the bigger fish at
 sea-fish for man.
 There are blue crabs In the wetlands too,
 and the other marine life sustained by the
 miraculous wetlands cycle.
 There is gravel there, too.
 If the past repeats itself, some day there
 will be no gravel left in once-beautiful Mt.
 Sinai Harbor.
 Long before that, if heedless man has his
 way, there will be no trace of the wetlands
 superfarm.
 The waters will be as barren of life as a
 desert.
 Just remember this.  Man can make a
 desert bloom.
 He can not bring wetlands back to life
 once they have been destroyed.
 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Victor and the Long
 Island Press have exposed the problems.
 It is our responsibility in the Congress to
 find the solutions.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, September 19, 1966
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, one of the
 most optimistic reports on the recent
 election in Vietnam comes from William
 S. White.
 I commend to the attention of our col-
 leagues Mr. White's column which ap-
 peared in the September 16, 1966, edition
 of the New York World Journal Tribu ie.
 The column follows:
 VIET FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT
 (By William S. White)
 WASHINGTON.-The long nightmare of Viet
 Nam is lifting at last, and though the way
 to final victory over the Communist assail-
 ants from without and within still stretches
 out long and forbidding, a true pre-dawn
 does now loom faintly ahead.
 This is the real meaning of the spectacular
 success for the people of South Viet Nam.
 In the teeth of tireless terrorism from the
 Communists, they have voted in better than
 80 per cent of their total strength in a free
 election.
 They are going now to make a democratic
 constitution  by  orderly  and  democratic
 means.  To all the world they have issued,
 moreover, a thundering rebuke to all those-
 the  Communists,                                                                     the fellow-travelers, the
 merely deluded peaceniks and beatniks-who
 for years have peddled the monstrous fiction
 that the Communist Viet Cong were in truth
 popular In South Viet Nam and were only
 engaged in a "democratic revolution."
 By immense majorities, the South Viet-
 namese themselves have forever destroyed
 this Big Lie version of current history.  By
 immense majorities, they have shown their
 determination both to keep their country
 from the reaching grasp of internal and ex-
 ternal Communist trigger men and to make
 of it a decent state in Asia.
 This is a victory for American policy of
 measureless importance-not for Democratic
 policy and not for Republican policy but for
 a partisan stance of strength in trevail and
 of steadfast honor in piled-up adversity.  To
 this splendid end the Republicans, and no-
 tably the party's leading figures in and out
 of Congress, have contributed with mem-
 orable generosity and magnificent concern
 for the vital, non-political interests of this
 nation and of all the free world.
 In the narrower sense, of course, it is a
 triumph for the Democratic President who
 has risked most in Viet Nam and has borne
 the heaviest of the burden from a constantly
 biting Democratic New Left at home and the
 incessantly  destructive  carping  that  has
 come from some of our alleged friends, such
 as Charles de Gaulle of France.
 Will it all help Deinocratlc Congressional
 candidates   in  November's  elections?  No
 doubt it will assist most of them, since most
 have stood all along with this nation's pledge
 to stay the course in Viet Nam.  No doubt,
 too, it may improve the President's "image"
 In the opinion polls.
 But It will also help many a Republican
 congressional candidate, as well it should,
 for many of these, too, have supported with
 unshaken courage the commitment of three
 successive Presidents of the United States to
 the people of South Viet Nam.
 To  look  for  two-bit  domestic  partisan
 credit or gain in this transcendental victory
 for a tortured people and for an old concept
 called the right to freedom-to freedom even
 in Asia-would be little-minded beyond be-
 lief.  For what has happened in Viet Nam
 can scarcely be described without the use of
 superlative heaped upon superlative.
 Fbr the first time in the Cold War a na-
 tion under Communist attack not only from
 abroad but at home has been able to con-
 duct a free election as free men.  The so-
 called war of liberation as a special instru-
 ment of Communist China lies in ruins in
 the now-deserted balloting places of South
 Viet Nam for the cynical and evil fraud it
 has always been.
 The Red Chinese have been thrown back
 as never before.  The policy of a rationally
 restrained but absolutely determined mili-
 tary resistance  to  Chinese  aggression-by-
 proxy has, been proved beyond all doubt to
 be not only one of honor but one of effec-
 tiveness as well.
 Over Asia the long darkness is lifting at
 least, though not yet dispersed.  The Chi-
 nese wave of the future is not, after all, to
 be the wave of the future for Asia, just as
 Hitler's wave of the future broke at length
 two decades ago upon the great rock of reso-
 lute Allied resistance.

 HON. RAY J. MADDEN
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, September 19, 1966
 Mr. MADDEN.                                       Mr. Speaker, on last
 Friday I spoke to the delegates from eight
 States bordering on the Great Lakes and
 also representatives from our neighbor
 Canada.
 I am hereby submitting excerpts from
 remarks which I made to the assembled
 delegates :
 EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH OF CONGRESSMAN RAY
 J. MADDEN BEFORE  CONFERENCE OF  GREAT
 LAKES  WATER  POLLUTION  AT THE PALMER
 HOUSE, CHICAGO, ILL., SEPTEMBER 16, 1966
 Mr. Chairman: Vice President HUMPHREY
 and his cosponsors are to be commended for
 calling this conference to further develop and
 decide upon executive action to curtail and
 eventually eliminate the pollution of Lake
 Michigan and the other great bodies of wa-
 ter commonly called the "Great Lakes" of our
 Nation.
 This conference representing officials from
 the States of New York, Illinois, Wisconsin,
 Pennsylvania,  Ohio,  Minnesota,  Indiana,
 Michigan  and  Canada are contributing   a
 great deal of their time and services in com-
 ing to Chicago on this occasion to help solve
 one of the Nation's greatest problems-Wa-
 ter Pollution.
 This conference will also consider the pol-
 lution problems of the Great Lakes and also
 the pollution problems pertaining to inland
 lakes, rivers, and streams located within the
 borders of the above-mentioned states.
 In the last session of Congress I joined
 with a great number of other House and
 Senate Members in sponsoring resolutions to
 establish the Federal Water Pollution Control
 Administration and to provide grants for re-
 search and development, to increase grants
 for the construction of municipal sewage
 treatment plants, to authorize the establish-
 ment of standards of water quality to aid in
 preventing, controlling and abating pollution
 of interstate waters, and for other purposes.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- APPENDIX     September
 I also participated in sponsoring legisla-
 tion on clearing up water pollution along
 the shores of the great water bodies referred
 to as the "Great Lakes.",
 The  legislation sponsored  by  our  col-
 leagues, Congressman JOHN A. BLATNIK, Of
 Minnesota, as Chairman of the Subcommit-
 tee on Public Works, and Senator EDMUND
 S. MUSE.IE of Maine, have made great prog-
 ress in Congress,
 The House legislation would provide $2.45
 b2 on for. sewage treatment plants for the
 nei t five years and establish a new concept
 of, incentive grants amounting to 10 per-
 cent for the development of basin plans for
 wate, pollution control.  It would also in-
 crease the Federal grant by another 10 per-
 cent or up to 50 percent under the basin
 plan, if the States matched to the extent
 of 25 percent of the total costs.  It would
 also provide $228 million for water pollu-
 tion research through the next three years
 as well as other progressive steps toward
 curbing water pollution.
 The work that has been done In this ses-
 sion  of Congress is merely a beginning of
 future plans to make an all-out effort to
 solve the water pollution problem.  If not
 curbed, polluted water will, in a few years,
 jeopardize the health of millions of human
 beings as well as animal and plant life
 throughout our land.  Economists estimate
 that in this generation we have suffered
 losses from water and  air  pollution that
 run into billions of dollars each year.  Un-
 less this program is pursued to a successful
 conclusion, the future cost to the American
 people In health, epidemics, and destruc-
 tion of animal and plant life will be in-
 calculable.
 If this curruption and poison of our lakes
 and streams, our lands, our rivers and forests
 and the atmosphere itself is not eliminated
 the progress and future expansion of food
 production,  health  and  agriculture  Itself
 will be curtailed,   Pollution of our water
 resources affects every human  being      and
 form of life throughout the land. It has
 been reported by experts who have studied
 pollution that every river, stream and lake
 within our nation's borders has, in some
 degree, suffered from pollution.    Pollution
 in our Great Lakes system and in our in-
 land lakes and rivers has already destroyed
 millions of, wild life,,fish and other game.
 Our nation? states, and local        communi-
 ties much organize and develop committees
 of experts to formulate long range plans to
 achieve cooperation with our national gov-
 erudient and work out a unified and nation-
 wide solution to clear up the waters of our
 country.  Communities along with industry
 and business must be willing and able to
 contribute funds necessary for constructing
 and installing modern' facilities to destroy
 industrial waste and sewage before it is re-
 leased to enter our streams and lakes.  Sew-
 age  and  Industrial  waste,  under modern
 scientific inventions, can be satisfactorily
 cured and eradicated before it enters the
 .Streams and lakes. The installation of the
 necessary machinery on the part of industry
 and municipalities can  curb' this nation-
 wide poisonous health hazard and it must
 be done regardless of the cost.
 The, people of our nation are cognizant of
 the fact that Federal financial assistance will
 be necessary if this great program is to suc-
 ceed.  It is also necessary that every munici-
 pality, business and industry cooperate in
 this necesasry effort.  President Johnson has
 recommended, and I am satisfied the vast
 majority of Members of Congress are in favor
 of an all-out effort to master this problem
 but we must have the complete cooperation
 of local industry and municipalities to suc-
 ceed in the effort.  Federal grants for waste
 treatment plants now total more than $725
 million. Almost 7,000 projects are now under
 construction  or  already  completed.   The
 president  also  requests an additional $150
 million to continue this important and nec-
 essary effort.
 The Federal Government already possesses
 authority to immediately bring suit to stop
 pollution when the pollution constitutes an
 Imminent danger to public health or welfare.
 Our Government has the right to subpoena
 witnesses in administrative hearings and the
 Secretary has the right to initiate enfoce-
 ment proceedings when pollution occurs in
 navigable  waters,  intrastate  or  interstate.
 The Government also has authority to de-
 mand registration of all existing or poten-
 tial  sources  of                                                                                    major  pollution  and  the
 United States officials have the right to in-
 spect such sources.  Private citizens also are
 allowed to bring suit In Federal Court to seek
 relief from pollution. These may seem strict
 and stringent measures nevertheless extra-
 ordinary steps must be  taken to preserve
 health and human life as well as animal and
 vegetable production in our Nation.
 The Federal Government has already taken
 effective steps requiring all new Federal in-
 stallations to include adequate water pollu-
 tion control systems.  All Federal agencies
 are required to submit long-range plans to
 bring existing installations up to a high level
 of pollution control required by the new
 facilities.
 If the destruction of our fresh water sup-
 ply in certain sections of the United States
 continues it will be but a short time until
 the shortage of water will be the number one
 problem facing approximately 200 million
 people in our land.   President Johnson is
 doing everything in his power and the Con-
 gress will cooperate in legislation. and par-
 ticipating funds to expand methods to con-
 serve, existing water supplies and prevent
 complete destruction of our lakes, rivers and
 streams.

 Mr. GUBSER.                                                      Mr. Speaker, I have
 heard it said that if you want to know a.
 man do business with him.  But if you
 want to understand him take a trip
 with him.
 Mr. Speaker, some weeks ago it was
 necessary for us to say goodby, with
 reluctance, to a man, Maj. Gen.. Thomas
 0. Corbin, Director of Air Force Legis-
 lative Liaison, whom many of us are
 privileged to know and understand.
 Of course, we were pleased that he was
 to be transferred to, a new and more
 challenging position, but nevertheless
 we shall miss a good friend.
 All of us who did business with Gen-
 eral Corbin learned to respect him for
 the splendid service he rendered our
 constituents through us.  His office was
 operated fairly and efficiently, with the
 best interests of the Nation as well as
 the Air Force in mind at all times.  I
 found my constituents' problems con-
 sidered with compassion and with a
 thoroughness that was all and more than.
 any of us should expect. Doing business
 with General Corbin was a great source
 of satisfaction.
 19, 1966
 But I was to enjoy a special privilege-
 that of taking a trip with General Corbin
 and learning to know and understand
 him as a friend. In the fall of 1965, the
 Special Investigating Subcommittee of
 Armed Services, on which I serve, visited
 every major military supply center in
 an extensive 5-week trip around the
 world. Those of us who traveled with
 General Corbin appreciated his diligence
 in seeing to it that the information we
 needed in our work was  available to
 us.  Whether it was talking to a GI in
 the combat zones of Vietnam, pursuing
 a serious point in a top-secret hearing or
 briefing, fulfilling the important social
 requirements at official receptions and
 dinners in foreign lands, or expertly
 handling the controls of a fast jet while
 landing on some Asian airfield, all of
 us who had the privilege of traveling
 with Gen. Thomas Corbin remember him
 for what he is, truly a man's man, a great
 friend, a fine officer, and a gentleman.

 Vietnamese Election Victory May Be
 Bigger Than We Think
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, September 19, 1966
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, while
 every friend of freedom is pleased by the
 results of the South Vietnamese election
 there are many problems yet to be solved.
 Some of the subsidiary benefits of the
 recent election, however, will help in
 solving these problems.  In this connec-
 tion I commend to the attention of our
 colleagues  the   following  column  by.
 Joseph Alsop which appeared in the Sep-
 tember 16, 1966, edition of the New York
 World Journal Tribune:
 VIET ELECTION VICTORY MAY BE BIGGER THAN
 WE  THINK
 (By Joseph Alsop)
 NHATRANG,   VIETNAM.-The   chances  are
 that the success of the Vietnamese election
 is being underrated at home. Any success
 here falsifies the predictions and flouts the
 present prejudice of too many people at
 home, and in Vietnam, too.  So any success,
 however solid, tends to be denigrated by
 those same people.
 Hence the first thing to note is that last
 Sunday's   election  was  brilliantly,  even
 startling, successful. The turnout of voters,
 so far surpassing the normal American per-
 centage, was far greater than anyone could
 have forecast.
 Furthermore, all those who voted did so in
 the face of the grimmest warnings by the
 Viet  Cong.  Voting  was  made  a heinous
 crime by the communist pre-election propa-
 ganda.  This should be noted by the oppo-
 nents of the President's policy at home, who
 have a way of hinting that the majority of
 Vietnamese   secretly support the  so-called
 National Liberation Front.  The election in-
 stead proves that the Viet Cong are exactly
 what they appear-a small armed minor-
 ity, seeking to seize control by naked force
 of a people who want no part of them.
 Having said so much (and it is ludicrous
 that such things should still need saying!)
 the obvious question is "What next?"
 Here in Nhatrang, the headquarters of the
 Second Corps area, the question seems par-
 ticularly pressing.
 In this corps area, the war is a stage or
 two ahead of the rest of Viet Nam.  The
 enemy's most important units have been
 driven to base themselves across the border
 in Cambodia, whence they merely raid Into
 Vietnamese territory.  Except for the four
 regiments in Cambodia, all the Communist
 outfits in the field here are suffering gravely
 from short rations and even worse from
 malaria.  All  are  trying  to  avoid  c_ om.bat
 when possible, and more than one of the
 larger formations seems to have broken down
 into separate companies and even platoons.
 What you can see ahead, in fact, is a new
 military phase, in which the threat of the
 V. C. main forces will be much diminished.
 But  in  this  next  phase,  it  will  still  be
 necessary to do the long and tedious job
 of tracking down the remaining V. C., squad
 by squad and platoon by platoon, and con-
 currently, long before all fighting ends, South
 Vietnam will have to develop politically.
 That would be difficult In any case.  In
 the Vietnamese case, it will be extra difficult
 for two main reasons that are little under-
 stood          at  home.  The  first  is  the    doubly
 colonial  character of Vietnamese history.
 The Vietnamese emerge into history as an
 occupied and subject people. It took them
 close to a thousand years to throw off the
 Chinese yoke.  And even their culture was     In  the  last  two  or  three  years,  young

 With the election of the Constituent As-

 In the community.  Yet the army Is by all
 odds the biggest force in Viet Nam at the
 moment; and there is a general desire to get
 away from military government.
 What will be developed in the end, none
 can foresee.  One may guess that several
 attempts may have to be made, over a con-
 siderable period, before the Vietnamese find
 what really suits them at last.  Before they
 find this, moveover, Americans should brace
 themselves for the kind of recurrent political
 turmoils here that so greatly upset many
 people at home.
 It will hardly avert turmoil, but a great
 plus in the political equation must also be
 noted.  In brief, besides great industry, cour-
 age and intelligence, the South Vietnamese
 also possess one of the very richest countries
 in the whole of Asia.   Strange as it may
 seem, moreover, South Viet Nam has actually
 been enriched by the war, both materially
 by the construction of a powerful modern
 infrastructure for the economy, and man-
 agerially by  the training of  hundreds  of
 thousands of technical cadres.
 Even in the next phase of "political war,"
 as Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky calls it, there should
 be at least enough peace to make Vietnamese
 natural wealth and recent enforced progress
 count for a very great deal.  Economics may
 therefore lubricate politics.   But patience
 will still be needed, not least by the Viet-
 namese  themselves,  until  the  day finally
 comes when they have found their own way,
 as the Koreans have already done.

 OF
 HON. GEORGE P. MILLER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, August 26, 1966
 Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, a very in-
 teresting  article      by  Judith  Martin,
 Washington Post staff writer, appeared
 in that newspaper on Saturday, Septem-
 ber 17.                                                                                              Mrs. Martin reported on an in-
 terview that she had with Dr. C. Easton
 Rothwell, president of Mills College,
 Oakland, Calif.
 Dr. Rothwell is one of the foremost
 members of the academic community.
 He is a progressive educator in the sense
 that he keeps abreast of today's develop-
 ments but is in no way a "faddist."  Dr.
 Rothwell is extremely proud of Mills'
 graduates and they in turn are extremely
 proud of him.
 The article follows:
 TODAY'S COED IS A CONCERNED WOMAN
 (By Judith Martin)
 The college girl has stopped asking herself,
 "Can I combine marriage and a career?"
 Instead, what she will need to know is,
 "Where can I find a good baby sitter?"
 "There's a new liveliness-in classes, in sem-
 inars, in bull sessions.  You can see it in
 book withdrawals from the library-books
 which  aren't required for courses-and in
 the sale of good paperbacks.
 "There's a sense of commitment.  Security
 now is considered akin to dullness.  The kids
 are concerned.
 "There's a trend to creativity. Partitions
 are coming down.  Mills is one of the real
 centers for new combinations of the arts,
 but it's elsewhere, too."
 Dr. Rothwell attributes part of the- change
 to the fact that current undergraduates re-
 cevied their early schooling in "the post-
 Sputnik time and there has been a revolu-
 tion in education in those years."
 Partly, he said, it's a reaction from post-
 war years, when GIs who were heads of fam-
 ilies, conscious of having lost school years
 and anxious to make them up, influenced
 campus life.
 But partly, he said, it's just because "it's
 in the air."
 The college girl is more likely now, than
 a few years ago, to be interested in science
 and do graduate work, he said.      -
 There is less pressure on her to get mar-
 ried young but she's more likely to continue
 her work after marriage.
 Dr. Rothwell,  who is on  one of "three
 teams going to 40 cities" to raise money for
 Mills  College,  addressed  the Mills College
 alumnae dinner at Fort Myers Officers Club
 last night.
 Each team consists of an administrator,
 a faculty member and a student. Accom-
 panying him were Barbara Wells, who teaches
 political science at Mills, and Elizabeth Rid-
 dleberger,  a  student  from                                                                                                                   Charlottesville.
 The college is trying to raise money to
 meet a Ford Foundation grant of $2,200,000
 at a ratio of three to one.  A three-year
 goal of $10 million is apparently going to
 be exceeded, and there is a ten-year goal of
 $23,500,000.
 "But you can't just talk about money,"
 Dr. Rothwell said, so he has been discussing
 college trends and Mills programs with the
 alumnae.
 The  development  of  interdepartmental
 courses,  such  as  "Human Development"
 taught by a biologist, a psychologist and a
 American bought" taught by an art his-
 torian, professor of literature and an his-
 torian, have been a Mills trend.  The jux-
 taposition of different arts, such as acting
 to the music of an orchestra, is also being
 done.
 Summer seminars for alumnae and thier
 husbands, a program which has been done
 before at Mills, will be rescheduled.
