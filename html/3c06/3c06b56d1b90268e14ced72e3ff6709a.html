 VIETNAM
 The Saigon government has issued a warning against dem-
 onstrations                                                                                                   1
 but has taken no direct measures so far to
 curb the student protest movement in several northern
 cities of South Vietnam.  There was only one major ground
 battle last week between Viet Cong and Vietnamese-US
 forces, but the almost daily USAF B-52 Stratofortress
 bombing missions against Viet Cong strongholds marked
 the increased use of strategic air power in the South.
 Statements from Peking last week revealed no change in
 its hard line toward a negotiated settlement, and the
 Chinese have begun to protest to the British against
 alleged US use of Hong Kong as a "base of operations"
 for the war in Vietnam.

 A large-scale mobilization of able..bodied manpower dur-

 factor, seems intended primarily to funnel labor into
 repairing bomb damage and portering cargo around damaged
 routes.   It is also clearly designed to provide a pool
 for a rapid build-up of the armed forces if required.

 SECRET
 Political activity in South
 Vietnam during the past week con-
 tinued to focus on the student
 protest movement centered in Hud
 and other northern cities. The
 movement has not gained signifi-
 cant momentum, and attempts to
 coordinate a similar protest in
 Saigon have thus far been unsuc-
 cessful.   However, a public rally
 in Hue on the morning of 29 Au-
 gust--although attended mostly
 by students--resulted in a work
 stoppage affecting public trans-
 portation and market activity.
 The government has taken no
 direct measures against the stu-
 dent movement thus far.   Premier
 Ky, however, on 31 August stated
 that the government was prepared
 to take stern measures against
 troublemakers.   Replying indi-
 rectly to student demands for the
 removal of Chief of State Thieu,
 Ky announced that no individual
 is responsible for policy but
 that it is determined by the
 collective leadership of the
 Directorate.
 The continued unity of the
 military leadership, however, de-
 pends largely on General Thi, who
 is responsible militarily for
 the northern provinces where most
 of the unrest exists.   Thi has
 advocated a wait-and-see policy
 regarding the student movement.
 The Military Situation
 After sustaining heavy cas-
 ualties during the two previous
 weeks, Viet Cong forces last
 week managed to avoid major con-
 tact with Vietnamese Government
 and US forces.   The only excep-
 tion to this was in Phong Dinh
 Province, when the rapid deploy-
 ment of government troops on 27
 August resulted in heavy fight-
 ing with a Viet Cong battalion
 during daylight hours.   Govern-
 ment casualties were high, but
 Viet Cong losses were probably
 greater.
 Viet Cong activity elsewhere
 was characterized by attacks on
 lightly defended towns and gov-
 ernment outposts.   During the
 night of 30-31 August, a force
 estimated at battalion size at-
 tacked and destroyed a government
 Regional Forces outpost at An
 Hoa in Quang Ngai Province.   Ten
 defenders were killed and eight
 wounded.   The delta region south
 of Saigon was again subjected to
 a series of small-scale attacks.
 Enemy activity in the central
 highlands was notably light.
 Government and US military
 activity during the week was
 highlighted by several unopposed
 road-clearing operations.   A joint
 operation secured Route 19 between
 Qui Nhon and An Khe to safeguard
 the deployment of the US First
 Cavalry (Air Mobile) Division,
 scheduled to arrive in Vietnam
 later this month.   Government
 forces also reopened Route 21
 from the coastal city of Nha Trang
 to the provincial capital of Ban
 Me Thuot, and Route 14 between
 Ban Me Thuot and the provincial
 capital of Gia Nghia.
 The past week also marked
 the increased use of strategic

 This message was the first
 such top-level Chinese statement
 which omitted the qualifications

 By dropping the usual caveat,
 Peking is probably attempting to
 increase the impact of its threat
 to intervene without actually
 extending its commitment.

 Communist Political Developments
 Peking is still showing no
 indication of any softening in
 its hard line toward a negotiated
 settlement of the Vietnam prob-
 lem and has reiterated its pub-
 lic pledge to send volunteers to
 Vietnam in somewhat more positive
 and threatening terms.   On 1 Sep-
 tember Mao Tse-tung,  Liu Shao-
 chi, Chu Te,and Chou En-lai, in
 a joint message to DRV party and
 state leaders commemorating the
 20th anniversary of the founding
 of the DRV, stated flatly that
 the Chinese people "are deter-
 mined to join the Vietnamese
 people to fight shoulder to
 Peking has also reiterated
 its "firm opposition" to UN con-
 sideration of the Vietnam prob-
 lem.   Its news agency on 1 Sep-
 tember denounced as "distortions"
 and "fabrications" reports in the
 French weekly New Observer that
 the Chinese haU_Fo    v s   ing
 French Minister of Cultural Af-
 fairs Andre Malraux in early Au-
 gust that once Peking regained
 the Chinese seat in the UN Secu-
 rity Council, the UN would prove
 an appropriate forum for discus-
 sions on Vietnam.
 Hanoi also took a hard line
 on negotiations.   In a 31 August
 address marking the 20th anniver-
 sary of the DRV, Premier Pham Van
 Dong drew an implicit analogy be-
 tween the war against the French
 and the current situation, assert-
 ing that until military defeats
 convinced the French they could
 not win in Vietnam, they had used
 negotiations  and agreements for
 their own ends.   He clearly implied
 that the Viet Cong position is
 not yet strong enough to make ne-
 gotiations with the US advanta-
 geous for the Communists.
 The rather somber tone of the
 speech also suggests Hanoi does
 not expect the Viet Cong to at-
 tain a position strong enough for

 negotiation in the near future.
 Customary boasts of imminent
 success were missing from Dong's
 claims of a victory by "libera-
 tion forces" at Chu Lai, and he
 repeated the line that the Viet-
 namese are prepared to fight
 "five, ten, 20 years or even
 longer."
 On 1 September, Peking made
 its second formal protest to
 London within a week concerning
 alleged US use of Hong Kong as
 a "base of operations" for the
 war in Vietnam.   The UK chargd
 in Peking was handed a sharply
 worded note which asserted that
 British support of US "aggres-
 sion" in Vietnam indicated a
 policy of "deliberate hostility"
 to the Chinese people and was
 "intolerable" to the Chinese
 Government.
 Citing visits of US Navy
 ships, military aircraft, and
 armed forces personnel to Hong
 Kong, the Chinese demanded that
 the British immediately take ef-
 fective steps to stop all activ-
 ities of "US aggressor forces"
 there.   The note warned that if
 the British allow the colony to
 be drawn into the Vietnam war,
 the UK "must bear full responsi-
 bility" for the consequences.
 Peking apparently is attempt-
 ing to raise fears in the UK and
 elsewhere that further escalation
 of the war in Vietnam could re-
 sult in Chinese reprisals in
 other areas.   The Hong Kong au-
 thorities have already reacted
 by requesting that the US re-
 strict its use of the colony as
 a rest and recreation area for
 US forces in Vietnam.
 Soviet party chief Brezhnev
 issued a sharp and personal de-
 nunciation of President John-
 son's Vietnam policy on 27 Au-
 gust at a Kremlin dinner honor-
 ing visiting Egyptian President
 N-asir.   Brezhnev quoted President
 Johnson as asserting "with satis-
 faction" that the destruction of
 schools, hospitals, and the ir-
 rigation network in the DRV is
 "in accord with the planned ob-
 jective" and accused the US of
 attempting to starve the North
 Vietnamese into submission.
 North Vietnamese politburo
 member Hoang Van Hoan concluded
 his two-week official visit to
 the USSR with the expected
 flourish of expressions of deep
 gratitude for the "magnanimous
 help"--both political and ma-
 terial--supplied b  Moscow to the

 A large-scale mobilization
 of able-bodied manpower--appar-
 ently designed to give as many
 of the people as possible a
 feeling of active participation
 in the defense of their country
 --has taken place in North Viet-
 nam during the past few months
 in reaction to the US air at-
 tacks on the DRV and to the in-
 creased pace of fighting in the
 South.   The evidence available
 thus far, however, does not in-
 dicate that a massive military
 draft call has been issued.
 Rather, the mobilization appears
 intended mainly to funnel labor

 into portering cargo around

 On the military side, the

 vide for a rapid build-up of the
 armed forces if required.   For
 the present, it appears that
 this will be accomplished in
 large part by substantially in-
 creasing the size of the militia
 and other paramilitary organiza-
 tions.   The regime is putting
 increased emphasis on the train-

 probably to create a sizable re-

 The meeting in Geneva of the
 Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Com-
 mittee (ENDC) reached a low ebb
 this week, with little if any
 progress being made and with time

 pected to end in time to prepare
 a report for presentation to the
 United Nations General Assembly
 when it reconvenes  on 21 Septem-
 ber.
 The Soviet Union has strongly
 criticized the US draft treaty on
 nonproliferation of nuclear arms
 on the grounds that it would not
 prevent West Germany from acquir-
 ing such weapons through a NATO
 nuclear force.   The draft also
 caused problems in the Western
 camp.   Britain continued to op-
 pose articles that might under
 some circumstances permit drop-
 ping the nuclear power veto over
 decisions on the use of nuclear
 weapons by a future Allied force.
 Former West German Chancellor
 Adenauer called the treaty an
 "instrument of delivering Europe
 into the hands of the Soviet
 Union."

 The only other significant
 proposal before the ENDC is the
 Italian proposal that nonnuclear
 states declare that they will
 not manufacture or acquire nu-
 clear weapons and will not seek
 or receive assistance from other
 states in the manufacture of such
 weapons.   After a certain period
 of years the signatories will
 meet to consider extension of the
 declaration, depending on progress
 made toward international agree-
 ments on nonproliferation and re-
 duction of nuclear arsenals.   The
 Italian plan provides an escape
 clause whereby signatories will
 regain freedom of action should
 a nonnuclear state acquire nuclear
 weapons.
 Rome intends to present this
 plan at the final sessions of the
 ENDC after consulting with the four
 Western members of the ENDC, West
 Germany, and the NATO Council.
 Later it will be presented to the
 UN General Assembly.   Delegates
 have been discussing this proposal
 informally and generally approve
 it if it does not interfere with
 negotiations on the nonprolifera-
 tion treaty.
 India, however, insists that
 nuclear states must take the in-
 itiative in steps toward disarma-
 ment such as the comprehensive
 test ban treaty, a freeze on nu-
 clear weapons, and reduction of
 existing nuclear stockpiles.   The
 Indian delegate maintains that
 it is unrealistic to ask any
 country to  forswear  the develop-
 ment of nuclear weapons while
 other countries continue to hold
 them.   Pressures are strong in
 India to become a member of the
 nuclear club for prestige reas-
 ons as well as because of the
 Chinese nuclear threat.
 Many of the nonaligned dele-
 gates had hoped to negotiate on
 other disarmament issues such
 as extending the test ban treaty
 to underground testing,  but with
 only a few days left it seems
 that such matters will be con-
 sidered after the General Assem-
 bly meets, F

 The Communist World
 PEKING CREATES TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION
 The formation of the Tibet
 Autonomous Region after a long
 delay marks a new phase in Pek-
 king's efforts to overcome re-
 sistance to Chinese rule.   The
 choice of Minister of Public
 Security Hsieh Fu-chih to lead
 the Chinese delegation to the
 inaugural ceremony in Lhasa on
 1 September was clearly intended
 to intimidate the Tibetans.   By
 sending Hsieh, a low-ranking
 member of the central committee,
 Peking also showed its displeas-
 ure with the Tibetans.   Men of
 politburo rank had represented
 Peking at the inauguration of
 the three other autonomous re-
 gions since 1949 (Sinkiang,
 Ninghsia, and Kwangsi).
 Normally Peking has ac-
 corded "autonomy" to a region
 populated by a non-Chinese eth-
 nic minority only after mili-
 tary and political opposition
 to Chinese rule has ended.   Po-
 litical opposition in Tibet is
 still substantial, but Peking
 is evidently embarrassed by the
 failure of its policy there and
 seems determined to establish
 at least the facade of an "au-
 tonomous" government.
 For about a year the Chi-
 nese have been increasingly im-
 patient with the sullen and
 hostile Tibetans.   Last Decem-
 ber they deposed the Panchen
 Lama, the resident spiritual
 leader of Tibet, and also an-
 nounced they would tolerate no
 opposition to "reforms" they
 intended to institute soon.
 Preparations to raise Tibet
 to full "autonomous" status were
 initiated in 1956 but deferred
 in 1957,  1960, and 1963,  largely
 because the Chinese were unable
 to persuade adequate numbers of
 respectable Tibetans to serve
 as puppet officials.   Peking
 recently claimed that there are
 16,000 Tibetan officials at
 various levels of government,
 but the Chinese probably consider
 only a few trustworthy.   Most are
 apparently fresh recruits,  for
 in January 1965 the claim had
 been made that Tibetan officials
 numbered only 5,800.   Last year
 a journal in Peking published
 the admission that it has been
 found impossible to win over
 older Tibetans.   It also said
 that even younger Tibetans are
 hard to influence because, as
 a group, they are "still under
 the influence of the old ideol-
 ogies and habits, particularly
 the religious superstitions,
 and they are confused on the
 nationalities question and their
 motherland."  Until it is more
 confident about the reliability
 of Tibetan officials, Peking
 probably will feel compelled to
 retain Chinese in authority down
 to the local level.
 The Chinese undoubtedly will
 also continue to maintain garri-
 son forces in Tibet to contain
 dissident actions that still oc-
 casionally occur.   Tibet has a
 population of about 1.3 million,
 but the proportion of adult males
 is abnormally low, as a result
 of heavy migration and savage
 Chinese reprisals following the
 1959 revolt.   The estimated
 60,000 Chinese troops stationed
 in Tibet can probably keep any
 disturbances in check.

 AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS IN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES
 Grain crop prospects this
 year are not promising in the
 USSR, Eastern Europe, China, and
 North Korea, but are good in
 North Vietnam.   Most Communist
 countries will probably be net
 grain importers in the 1965-66
 crop year (July-June), and their
 total imports from the free world
 may be around 20 million tons.
 Agricultural prospects in
 the USSR are mixed.   Total grain
 production is estimated to be
 10-15 percent below last year's
 good harvest, and wheat produc-
 tion probably will be down 10-20
 percent, primarily because of
 prolonged drought in the New
 Lands.   This may cause some re-
 duction in the quality of bread,
 but food shortages on the scale
 of 1963-64 are unlikely.   Since
 1 July the USSR has purchased
 7 million tons of wheat and may
 need more,  depending on the final
 outcome of the 1965  harvest.
 Livestock production,  however,
 is expected to be the best in
 many years,  and relatively good
 crops of potatoes, sugar beets,
 vegetables, and sunflowers are
 anticipated.
 In Eastern Europe the total
 harvest is estimated to be about
 5 percent below last year's good
 crop.   Bread-grain production
 has increased in most of this
 area, but the quality of wheat
 will be low in the northern coun-
 tries because of unusually wet
 harvest conditions.   Production
 of most spring-planted grains is
 not expected to be as good as in
 1964, and in some areas local
 shortages of bread and hoarding
 of flour have been reported.
 Contracts for grain deliveries
 from the free world have reached
 2.2 million tons, in addition
 to standing agreements with the
 USSR for an estimated 3 million
 tons.   Imports from all sources
 could exceed last year's 9 mil-
 lion tons.   Although forage crops
 are generally good, the probable
 shortfall in output of feed grains
 and potatoes will depress meat
 production in 1966.
 In Communist China the har-
 vest of early grains is estimated
 to be 10 percent below last year's.
 The early rice crop was above
 average, but insufficient to com-
 pensate for the very poor har-
 vest of winter grains.   Prospects
 for the more important fall crops
 are mixed.   Growing conditions
 are generally good in most of
 the major rice-producing areas,
 but the outlook for other late
 grain crops is generally unsatis-
 factory.   China's foreign pur-
 chases of wheat for delivery by
 the end of June 1966 now equal
 4.1 million tons, and total pur-
 chases this crop year may well
 exceed last year's imports of
 5.3 million tons.   All of China's
 imports of wheat are from the
 free world.
 Grain production in North
 Korea may be even lower than
 the very poor harvest in 1964.
 North Vietnam evidently has har-
 vested another bumper spring
 rice crop, but bombing attacks
 have apparently interfered with
 food distribution  causina local
 food shortages.

 KASHMIR FIGHTING ESCALATES FURTHER
 The worsening situation in
 Kashmir has moved into a new
 stage in which wider and more
 sustained hostilities have begun
 along the 1949 cease-fire line.
 The first stage began in
 early August when Pakistan--frus-
 trated by years of deadlock on
 the Kashmir question--made good
 its long-bruited threat to under-
 take covert guerrilla warfare in-
 side Indian Kashmir.   The initial
 Indian response was quick and to
 the point in terms of direct op-
 erations against the infiltrators
 imposition of tightened security
 measures aimed at dissuading any
 sympathetic reaction among Indian
 Kashmiris, and pressure on the
 UN to issue a report critical of
 Pakistan's activities.
 bringing its regular armed forces
 to bear on Indian units on both
 sides of the old cease-fire line.
 Armor and tactical air power have
 already been committed by both
 sides to fighting in the Chhamb
 area.
 Pakistan's actions sug-
 gest an abandonment of the con-
 cept which has called for a con-
 tinuing disavowed guerrilla effort
 in favor of more rapid escalation
 and more direct confrontation.
 On the Indian side, the re-
 sponse continues to be confident
 and measured, in sharp contrast
 to the confusion which prevailed
 earlier this year during the Rann
 of Kutch confrontation.   In part,
 this reflects the Indian feeling
 of being in a position of strength;
 in part it grows out of Prime Min-
 ister Shastri's growing confidence
 in his own role, the result of a
 conspicuous strengthening of his
 political position in the inter-
 vening months.   There are warhawks
 on the Indian side, but thus far
 their influence has been muted.
 The UN's failure to weigh
 in against Pakistan led India to
 undertake more direct military
 action around mid-August.   The
 Indians tightened their controls
 along the cease-fire line to cur-
 tail continuing infiltrations and
 began hitting out with consider-
 able success at selected targets
 on the Pakistani side of the line
 in order to destroy the infiltra-
 tors' bases and harass their lines
 of communication.   In the Uri-
 Poonch area,  India has tried with
 apparent success to slice off a
 salient of Pakistani territory.
 The third stage has now be-
 gun.               In response to India's suc-
 cessful counteractions, Pakistan
 has moved openly into the fray as
 an active and avowed protagonist,
 Through it all, the UN has
 been ineffectual, both in the
 field in Kashmir, where a 45-man
 observer group is being ignored
 by both sides, and in New York,
 where U Thant's efforts have been
 hamstrung thus far by Indian and
 Pakistani pressures.

 The Indonesian Government's
 domestic and foreign policies
 remain  close to Communist objec-
 tives.                The government is train-
 ing the Indonesian people for
 participation in a highly devel-
 oped leftist totalitarian system.
 Cadres of university professors,
 high-school teachers, government
 officials, and leaders of non-
 government organizations are be-
 ing subjected to intensive and
 lengthy indoctrination courses.
 There is heavy emphasis on Marx-
 ism, on the wisdom of supermortal
 Sukarno, and on Nasakom--Sukarno's
 acronym for the fusion of na-
 tionalist, religious, and Commu-
 nist thought in Indonesia.
 The army, once an effective
 brake on Communist growth, shows
 progressively less inclination
 and ability to cope with the Su-
 karno-Communist drive.   There is
 new evidence of Communist pene-
 tration of the military, and
 high-level army resistance to the
 creation of an armed force of
 "workers and peasants" is vague
 and ineffective.
 Sino-Indonesian friendship
 flourishes.    Foreign Minister
 Subandrio reportedly will go to
 Peking on 9 September, a visit
 which follows within a month his
 Chinese counterpart's appearance
 in Djakarta.   An economic dele-
 gation is scheduled to go to
 China this, month.
 An "international antifor-
 eign-military-bases conference"
 is scheduled to be held in
 Djakarta in mid-October.   Indo-
 nesia and China will try to use
 this to stimulate enthusiasm
 for the Algiers.Afro-Asian Con-
 ference the following month. Su-
 karno will also lobby for his
 Conference of the Newly Emerging
 Forces, scheduled to be held in
 Djakarta in mid-1966.
 The anti-Malaysia campaign
 is largely unchanged.   Singa-
 pore's secession gave Indonesia
 a psychological boost, and Dja-
 karta aims to persist with its
 confrontation policy until Ma-
 laysian dismemberment is complete
 and the British have left the area.
 Harassment of Americans and
 official  US installations con-
 tinues.                                                               The US consulate in Sura-
 baya, East Java, in particular has
 experienced mounting hostility,
 including a mob attack on its of-
 fices and an informal request that
 the consul be declared persona
 non grata.
 Negotiations are under way
 to purchase the refineries of
 two of the three large Western
 oil companies--Standard Vacuum
 and Shell.   Although oil opera-
 tions are still relatively un-
 hampered, the three companies
 expect that in due course inter-
 ference will greatly increase,        25X1
 and they do not discount the pos-
 sibility of a direct order of
 expulsion.   The American-owned
 rubber companies are already
 largely Indonesian operated, but
 reduced proceeds are still  oin
 to the Parent firms.

 After over three years in
 power as chairman of the Revolu-
 tionary Council, General Ne Win
 retains firm control of Burma de-
 spite popular disgruntlement with
 the country's economic stagnation.
 Recent internal developments
 reflect Ne Win's  entrenched
 position.   Neither the Buddhist
 clergy nor the general public re-
 acted noticeably to the arrests in
 late April of more than 100 monks
 charged with illegal political
 activity or with dealings in the
 black market.   The subsequent
 arrest of former brigadier general
 Aung Gyi, once Ne Win's chief
 lieutenant, served to neutralize
 him as a potential rallying point
 for Burma's multitude of plotters
 and insurgent groups.   The July
 anniversary of the 1962 student
 riots at Rangoon University--the
 only instance in which the Ne
 Win regime has resorted to violent
 suppressive tactics--passed
 quietly despite a belated student
 protest effort.
 Ne Win has made little prog-
 ress, however,  in ending the
 chronic insurgency practiced by
 small groups of underground Com-
 munists and disaffected ethnic
 minorities. Last year's truce
 between the government and a prom-
 inent Karen insurgent leader is
 in danger of breaking down.   Other
 uncoordinated insurgent activities
 are hampering agricultural pro-
 duction and require the attention
 of a large portion of the army,
 even though they do not seriously
 threaten the government.
 The lack of economic prog-
 ress remains the military regime's
 major problem.   The Burmese have
 failed to respond with any en-
 thusiasm to the increasing gov-
 ernment controls involved in
 Ne Win's "Burmese Way to Social-
 ism."  Mismanagement of the com-
 modity distribution system has
 resulted in shortages of several
 basic items.   The subsequent
 rationing of such goods caused
 further public annoyance.  Most
 of the reorganizations and
 changes, moreover, have occurred
 in the modern sector of the
 economy, and living standards of
 the 85 percent of the people
 who live in rural areas have
 been little affected.
 In foreign affairs, Ne Win
 is maintaining strict neutrality.
 In his visit to Communist China
 in late July, Ne Win evaded
 Chinese efforts to enlist his
 support for their Southwest Asia
 position.   On Vietnam, the joint
 communiqud expressed only mutual
 "deep concern over the increas-
 ingly grave situation," and
 called for a return to the 1954
 Geneva agreements.   Chinese
 leaders will probably fare lit-
 tle better during their return
 visit to Rangoon, which may
 take place early this month.
 To "balance" the Peking
 visit, General Ne Win has accepted
 an official invitation to tour
 the USSR from 15 to 22 September.

 FACTIONAL RIVALRIES SNAG RESHUFFLE OF LAOTIAN CABINET
 Premier Souvanna Phouma of
 Laos is encountering problems
 in his efforts to reshape his
 cabinet to suit the leadership
 of the various'political fac-
 tions in the legislature elected
 in July.   His principal diffi-
 culties apparently are with Dep-
 uty Premier Leuam Insixiengmay,
 who commands the support of a
 sizable bloc of deputies and is
 demanding several posts for his
 own candidates.   In addition,
 Souvanna has to consider the
 claims of the neutralist and
 Sananikone factions, which are
 also pressing for greater recog-
 nition.
 Regardless of the eventual
 changes agreed upon by the con-
 tending non-Communist groupings,
 the Pathet Lao has made clear
 its opposition to any cabinet
 which may emerge.   A recent
 Pathet Lao broadcast condemned
 the July elections as "deceit-
 ful," and protested that the
 new government instituted by
 the National Assembly, whatever
 its composition, would be "to-
 tally illegal and invalid."
 On the military scene,
 rightist forces north of Ban
 Ban claim to have recaptured
 the strategic hill position of
 Hua Muong, which had been lost
 last winter.   Key support in
 this drive has been afforded by
 large-scale US and Laotian close
 air support operations.   The re-
 covery of this position, with
 its 1,400-foot airstrip, would
 significantly improve the govern-
 ment's guerrilla capability against
 Communist forces operating along
 Route 6 southwest of Samneua town.
 In the Plaine des Jarres
 area, the situation remains rela-
 tively quiet, with government
 and Communist forces facing each
 other along Route 7 a few miles
 east of Muong Soui.   There have
 been some indications that the
 Communist troops have been suf-
 fering severe supply shortages
 as a result of the aerial inter-
 diction of key supply routes from
 North Vietnam.
 Communist activity along the
 network of roads and trails lac-
 ing the panhandle area continues.
 In the Mu Gia Pass area, North
 Vietnamese troops are evidently
 being used to repair sections of
 Route 12 between the pass and the
 Route 23 junction, while coolie
 trains are moving supplies over
 a trail bypassing damaged sections
 of the road.
 Farther south, a road watch

 Following the National As-
 sembly's ratification of the
 agreements normalizing relations
 with Japan on 14 August, the
 South Korean Government has
 launched a crackdown to end
 persistent opposition to this
 major foreign policy move.   Jap-
 anese approval is expected when
 the Diet convenes next month.
 First to feel the crack-
 down were students who demon-
 strated in Seoul and other
 cities from 20 to 26 August.
 They demanded the voiding of
 the treaty ratification and
 freedom from alleged US polit-
 ical  pressure, and called for
 new assembly elections.   Army
 units finally were called on
 to aid police in dispersing the
 students.   The government ar-
 rested hundreds of demonstra-
 tors,  forced the expulsion or
 suspension of many student
 leaders, and appointed a new
 education minister and presi-
 dent of Seoul National Univer-
 sity.   Most colleges and uni-
 versities in the capital sus-
 pended sessions for a short
 cooling-off period.   Campus
 leaders reportedly are planning
 further rallies soon, however.
 Disgruntled retired general-
 grade officers have also felt
 the crackdown.   Eight were de-
 tained on 28 August on charges
 of "extreme criticism of the
 government," and four were sub-
 sequently indicted for defaming
 the President.   All belonged to
 the increasingly active National
 Council to Safeguard the Father-
 land, which also includes clergy-
 men, professors, and students,
 and according to the government
 intends to form a new conserva-
 tive party as well as to incite
 the public on the Japanese is-
 sue.
 In a further effort to
 still the controversy, the Pak
 regime recessed the National
 Assembly when it convened for
 its regular session on 1 Septem-
 ber.   This guards against the
 chance that the opposition as-
 semblymen might end their re-
 cent boycott in order to regain
 a forum for attacking official
 policy.
 The government is only be-
 ginning broader efforts to cope
 with the widespread hostility
 toward improving relations with
 Japan.   In one move to blunt
 criticism, it is drafting legis-
 lation to prevent the illegal
 flow of Japanese funds into
 Korea.   Critics remain concerned
 over the prospects for official
 graft in the handling of the
 $800 million Japan will supply
 in grants, long-term credits,
 and private investments.

 Scattered reports indicate
 that the Egyptian Muslim Brother-
 hood, once a powerful Islamic
 organization that engaged freely
 in terrorist tactics, may be
 once again plotting and using
 violence to express its discon-
 tent with the Nasir regime.
 Although it constitutes no
 threat to the deeply entrenched
 regime, the brotherhood has sur-
 vived all attempts at total sup-
 pression and, as the most co-
 herent body outside of official
 control, is a source of continu-
 ing trouble.   It had been largely
 inactive since 1954, when it was
 ostensibly crushed following its
 attempt to assassinate Nasir.
 The brotherhood has presumably
 retained a large number of loyal
 followers attracted by its re-
 ligious spirit and morality,
 and its extremism.
 In July, large numbers of
 the brotherhood, along with some
 Communists and army officers,
 were arrested in connection with
 a suspected coup plot.   A re-
 cent attempt to arrest a member
 led to an armed clash in which
 both police and civilians, pos-
 sibly a sizable number, were
 killed.   Last week a crowd of
 several thousand clashed with
 police in Cairo after seizing
 the coffin of Mustafa Nahas, the
 last civilian premier of Egypt,
 from his funeral procession.   It
 is probably that the brotherhood,
 whose leadership was similar in
 background to that of Nahas' Wafd
 party, joined in this opportunity
 to defy the government and ac-
 claim Nahas a "leader of the
 nation."
 Nasir now has openly ac-
 knowledged the brotherhood's
 activities, and charged that
 funds from members living abroad
 are being sent into Egypt to
 destroy the revolution.   He may
 be exaggerating the threat in
 order to sidetrack public dis-
 content.

 GREEK CROWN COUNCIL MEETS ON POLITICAL CRISIS
 Following Greek premier
 Tsirimokos' failure to win a con-
 fidence vote on 28 August, King
 Constantine summoned a crown
 council of former premiers and
 party leaders on 1 September in
 a further attempt to end the
 country's seven-week-old crisis.
 The King is not bound to
 follow the council's recommenda-
 tions, and reports on his own
 preferences point to several pos-
 sibilities.   He may next try for
 a national coalition government
 of all non-Communist parties, or
 again offer the mandate to former
 deputy premier Stephanopoulos,
 in spite of the latter's failure
 to receive sufficient parliamen-
 tary support on an earlier "ex-
 ploratory" mandate.
 In any event, the King still
 appears opposed to elections and
 to the return to power of ousted
 premier Papandreou.
 Constantine's decision
 probably will be announced this
 week end.
 Papandreou now is publicly
 calling for elections within
 45 days.
 Pro-Papandreou demonstra-
 tions continue and the King's
 position in the dispute becomes
 more precarious as each suc-
 cessive failure                                                           to form a new

 COST-SHARING PROBLEMS IN NATO
 When the North Altantic
 Council reconvenes next week,
 it will face the need for early
 action on financial problems
 that have been hanging fire for
 many months.
 Perhaps the most signifi-
 cant matter on the agenda is a
 reallocation of costs of the
 NATO infrastructure program,
 which has built almost $3 bil-
 lion worth of installations and
 facilities since it was adopted
 in 1951.   The US has been pro-
 viding almost a third of the
 funds in recent years for each
 annual program, but its share
 in utilization of the facilities
 has been only about a fifth.
 NATO "integration" is certain to
 be seen as a further weakening in
 the Alliance.
 Another funding problem is
 the cost of transporting certain
 headquarters units of the Allied
 Command Europe (ACE) Mobile Force
 to participate in a military ex-
 ercise in Turkey.   Last year
 France approved the exercise,
 named "Eastern Express," but re-
 served on the transport costs.
 In the interests of harmony the
 US and UK then offered to furnish
 free transport, but the exercise
 had to be put off because of the
 political tension over Cyprus.
 This year the offer--described
 as "an exception to the rule"--
 has been withdrawn.
 Early this year, the US
 asked that its share of the 1965
 costs be reduced to 25 percent
 and its share of future programs
 to 20 percent, but the US pro-
 posal has been given a cool re-
 ception by the other allies and
 no agreement is in sight.   Until
 the dispute is settled, approxi-
 mately $138.5 million worth of
 construction which should have
 been started in the spring is
 being held up because no con-
 tracts can be let. Continued
 inability to settle differences
 over a program which has been
 held up as a model of effective
 France now has charged the
 US and UK with inconsistency, and
 the US has pointed out that the
 shoe should be on the other foot
 since France had accepted common
 funding for support units in the
 case of a similar exercise in
 Scandinavia.
 A decision on this problem
 is becoming increasingly urgent
 because of Ankara's warning that
 it attaches great importance to
 holding t e, deferred exercise

 SETTLEMENT REACHED IN DOMINICAN CRISIS
 Representatives of both
 sides in the Dominican Republic
 endorsed the OAS Act of Recon-
 ciliation on 31 August, and the
 provisional government is sched-
 uled to be installed on 3 Sep-
 tember.
 The rebels, however, are
 already misinterpreting some
 of the provisions.   Some are
 viewing the changes regarding
 the withdrawal of the Inter-
 American Peace Force (IAPF) as
 meeting rebel demands that it
 be withdrawn rapidly, and state-
 ments by Caamano have probably
 contributed to this view.
 Imbert evidently decided
 to resign after seeing that
 his efforts to remain in power
 were hopeless.   He made his
 announcement on Monday night,
 but only after a week of seek-
 ing support among the military
 for his regime's position and
 sponsoring a mass rally to dem-
 onstrate the nation's commit-
 ment to anti-Communism.   He and
 most Government of National Re-
 construction (GNR) members re-
 fused to approve the Act of Rec-
 onciliation..   Moreover,          there
 are already tentative indica-
 tions that Imbert is consider-
 ing taking a leading part in a
 rightist coalition to prepare
 for the elections to be held in
 about nine months.
 The signature of Imbert's
 regime was, in effect, provided
 by the GNR military chiefs and
 Defense Minister Francisco Rivera
 Caminero.   They signed a decla-
 ration appended to the act, pledg-
 ing their firm acceptance both
 of the OAS proposals and of Hec-
 tor Garcia Godoy as provisional
 president.   It appeared that the
 chiefs' actions did not command
 the wholehearted support of Gen-
 eral Wessin and other military
 officers.   Wessin seems to have
 been involved on 29 August in a
 mortar attack on the rebel zone
 which provoked a firefight be-
 tween the IAPF and the rebels.
 The attack may have been designed
 to disrupt negotiations.
 The new provisional presi-
 dent is a moderate who retained
 the respect of both sides during
 the arduous negotiations.   A
 former diplomat under Trujillo,
 Garcia Godoy also served as for-
 eign minister under Bosch.   While
 he has been receptive to US ad-
 vice,  he has stressed that his
 new regime must be "truly inde-
 pendent."  He believes the de-
 velopment of the country cannot
 be left to extremists but should

 be channeled into "realistic"
 social, economic, and military
 reforms.   Garcia Godoy may be
 attacked, however, either be-
 cause of his past association
 with ex-President Balaguer's
 Reformist Party or because of
 his upper-class background.
 Garcia Godoy's tentative
 cabinet appointments are gen-
 erally political neutrals who
 are dedicated and apparently
 competent.   The new President
 may keep the foreign ministry
 post for himself and will appar-
 ently retain Rivera as his de-
 fense minister, at least for a
 short period.   The appointments
 are designed to contribute to
 what Garcia Godoy views as the
 major   functions of the pro-
 visional regime:   getting the
 country going again and pre--
 paring for the elections.
 It appears that political
 activity will begin almost im-
 mediately despite provisions
 in the settlement for a six-
 month political truce.   Rival
 leaders of the major Dominican
 Revolutionary Party are reportedly
 planning to return--Angel Miolan
 almost immediately and Juan Bosch
 in mid-September.   Neither one
 has given any firm indication of
 his plans.
 The settlement embodied in
 the Act of Reconciliation,  al-
 though a diplomatic triumph for
 Ambassador Bunker and the OAS,
 will be only an initial step to-
 ward reconstruction after one of
 the most bitter and destructive
 civil wars in Latin American
 history.   The hatreds fanned dur-
 ing the past four months run deep
 and will not be erased easily. A
 compromise settlement is a new
 experience for Dominicans,  many
 of whom consider it more logical
 for one or the other of the rival
 factions to go down in defeat.

 AGITATION AGAINST THE BOLIVIAN JUNTA INCREASING
 Agitation against the Bo-
 livian military junta by stu-
 dents and miners is increasing,
 but the junta is believed capable
 of handling the situation.   On
 31 August, students from the Uni-
 versity of Oruro blocked the main
 square of the city in demonstra-
 tions similar to those held dur-
 ing the past two weeks at univer-
 sities in Cochabamba and La Paz.
 Miners at Huanuni struck for 48
 hours on 26 and 27 August as did
 those at the important Catavi -
 Siglo Veinte complex on 30 and
 31 August.   The Catavi - Siglo
 Veinte workers are threatening
 to go on general strike on 7 Sep-
 tember if their demands for
 higher wages are not met.
 The student demonstrations
 and mine strikes, ostensibly
 called over economic issues, are
 designed primarily to embarrass
 the junta and to create an atmos-
 phere of agitation leading to its
 eventual overthrow.   The students,
 led by their leftist rectors, are
 using the financial difficulties
 of the universities to explain
 their discontent.   Political mo-
 tivations are evident, however.
 The junta has already gone out
 of its way to appease the stu-
 dents and has programed budget
 increases to remedy their eco-
 nomic plight.
 The strikes in the mines
 are designed to make the junta
 appear antilabor and to pres-
 sure it into renouncing its mine
 reform program.   A reduction in
 wages is the primary grievance,
 but the miners are also demanding
 other concessions which, if
 granted, would scuttle the re-
 form program.                           The Trotskyite
 Revolutionary Workers'  Party ap-
 pears to have gained control in
 some of the major mines, although
 moderate elements are still prom-
 inent.   The mine situation is
 delicate, and violence is pos-
 sible in the coming weeks.
 La Paz is relatively quies-
 cent politically, at least on the
 surface.   Most parties are pre-
 occupied with internal dissensions,
 but there is evidence of growing
 anti-junta sentiment in all. Cur-
 rent political activity is focus-
 ing on the issue of general elec-
 tions and Co-President Barrientos'
 definite, but unannounced, candi-
 dacy.   Most parties are calling for
 an early return to constitutional
 rule, and there are indications
 that the junta might hold elec-
 tions as early as next May.
 The issue of Barrientos' can-
 didacy is a potentially trouble-
 some one, for it involves contin-
 ued military unity.   Some ranking
 officers feel that Barrientos
 should not run as a military can-
 didate since this could plunge the
 armed forces even deeper into the
 political morass.
 The rivalry between Barrientos
 and Co-President Ovando is also
 disturbing to many military com- 25X1
 manders who see this as leading
 to an eventual armed confrontation
 between military units.

 INCREASING COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN BRAZILIAN LABOR MOVEMENT
 Renewed Communist strength
 in the Brazilian labor movement
 is evidenced by the results of
 recent important union elections.
 In the large Guanabara metal-
 workers' union, a Communist-
 backed slate won by a margin of
 two to one over the progovern-
 ment ticket.   Pro-Communists
 also made electoral gains in key
 Sao Paulo locals representing
 metalworkers and bank workers.
 Although the government has
 sought to keep known Communists
 off the ballots, it has been un-
 able to prevent the formation
 of tickets consisting of lesser
 known party members and sympa-
 thizers.   Another Communist
 technique has been to form unity
 slates with ostensibly independ-
 ent candidates.
 is little official interest in
 instituting relief measures.
 Many of the reform programs
 that would most benefit labor,
 such as the low-cost  housing
 program, have yet to advance much
 beyond the planning stage.   Con-
 sequently, proadministration
 union candidates have had few
 government achievements to which
 they can point in their campaigns.
 In view of the weakness of their
 position, democratic union lead-
 ers are pessimistic over coming
 elections in the Rio de Janeiro
 bank,textile, maritime, and con-
 struction workers' locals.
 At the moment, although
 the outlook for the labor move-
 ment is gloomy, government re-
 strictions will probably prevent
 Growing worker discontent            any rash of strikes or demonstra-
 over rising living costs and                               tions.   The resurgence of Commu-
 high urban unemployment has pro-                           nist influence in the unions,
 vided the'extreme left with                   however, is likely to result in
 solid issues to exploit. Another              increased subversive propaganda
 contributing factor has been an               and agitation and to help opposi-
 apparently general feeling among                                 tion candidates in the October

 Colombia's mounting economic
 and political problems may lead

 Demonstrations began on 25
 August in Boyaca State with a
 civic strike protesting govern-
 ment nonpayment of teachers dur-
 ing the past five months.   These
 demonstrations--centered in the
 state capital of Tunja, about 80
 miles from Bogota--resulted in
 injuries and property damage. In

 Bogota the next day the extremist-
 dominated National Federation of
 Universities (FUN) declared a 24-
 hour solidarity strike with the
 Tunja students.   The Bogota dem-
 onstrations also resulted in con-
 siderable property damage.   Dem-
 onstrations temporarily subsided
 when the government decided to
 pay the Boyaca teachers, but on
 30 August teachers elsewhere went
 on strike to protest nonpayment
 of salaries.   Judicial employees
 are also threatening strikes with
 the same motive.
 A rallying point for stu-
 dent and extremist agitation in-
 creasingly appears to be Camilo
 Torres, a former priest who has
 been released from his ecclesi-
 astical vows and now devotes him-
 self to advocating revolution to
 solve the country's problems.
 The Colombian Communist Party
 (PCC) has reportedly decided to
 back Torres, who may also be
 seeking support from elements
 in ex-dictator Rojas Pinilla's
 party, the National Popular Al-
 liance (ANP).   A Communist-backed
 mass rally is, in fact, being
 planned for Torres in Bogota's
 central square on 10 September.
 Disorders may occur if the gov-
 ernment tries to impede it.
 There is also the possi-
 bility that a wave of strikes,
 especially by extremist-counseled
 unions prone to violence, may
 erupt in protest against new un-
 popular economic measures.   Sev-
 eral labor unions have already
 repudiated a gasoline tax, and
 contemplated exchange reform
 measures may be equally unpopu-
 lar.
 In addition, considerable
 concern now revolves around sub-
 versive organizations on the
 Castroist model which are at-
 tempting to set up combined
 urban-rural apparatuses.   Such
 an organization is the "Army
 of National Liberation" (ELN),
 which has recently claimed
 credit for the bombing of three
 US-owned oil pipelines in Bar-
 rancabermeja on 17 and 18 Au-
 gust.                                                                  The ELN and the dissi-
 dent hard-line Communist party
 (Marxist-Leninist Communist
 Party of Colombia--PCC-ML) have
 been responsible for one at-
 tempted and two successful bomb-
 ings aimed against US Govern-
 ment property and personnel since
 the beginning of the year.
 Meanwhile, there is con-
 tinuing disenchantment with
 President Valencia within his
 own Liberal Party, and key
 factions of the Conservative
 Party are threatening to leave
 the coalition government. The
 Ospinistas, a major Conservative
 faction, are threatening to with-
 draw from the government if
 Valencia,  does not give them
 greater representation in the
 next cabinet.   The Laureanistas,
 the other major Conservative
 faction, are also at odds with
 Valencia, and continue to threaten
 withdrawal.
