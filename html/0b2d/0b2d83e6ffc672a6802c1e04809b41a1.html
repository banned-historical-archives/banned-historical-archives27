 FOREWORD
 Nine bills to establish 'a Freedom Commission and Freedom Acad-
 emy have been referred to the Committee on Un-American Activities
 during this 89th Congress.  They are : H.R. 470 introduced by Mr.
 Herlong January 4,1965; H.R. 1033, introduced by Mr. Gubser Jan-
 uary 4,1965; H.R. 2215, introduced by Mr. Ichord January 11, 1965;
 H.R. 2379, introduced by Mr. Boggs January 12, 1965; H.R. 4389, in-
 troduced by Mr. Gurney February 4, 1965; H.R. 5370, introduced by
 Mr. Clausen February 24, 1965; H.R. 5784, introduced by Mr. Ash-
 brook March 3, 1965; H.R. 6700, introduced by Mr. Buchanan March
 24, 1965; and H.R. 9209, introduced by Mr. Feighan June 17, 1965
 (after committee hearings had been completed) .
 During the 88th Congress, nine bills having the same purpose were
 referred to the committee.,  Extensive hearings were held by the
 committee during 1964 on these bills, but no bill was reported out by
 the committee during the 88th Congress.
 The nine bills presently being considered, though they vary some-
 what in detail,2 have the same purpose-to provide for the establish-
 ment, under Federal -auspices, of a cold war educational and research
 institution which would be run by an independent seven-man com-
 mission, whose chairman and members would be appointed by the
 President, subject to confirmation by the Senate, and which would
 operate under the general supervision of the Congress in the sense
 that it would have to report to it regularly and would be dependent
 upon it for its appropriations.
 The purpose of the Academy would be to improve the ability of the
 United States, and the free world generally, to wage the cold war in
 which it is presently engaged with the international forces of com-
 munism. It would accomplish this in two ways : First, by instructing
 its students on the subject of communism generally, its strategy and
 tactics, and the weapons and devices it is using in all parts of the world
 to subvert free nations and replace them with Communist dictator-
 ships; secondly, by conducting research to develop new techniques
 which the United States and other non-Communist nations can utilize
 in resisting and defeating all types of Communist "cold" warfare.
 The cold war, as waged by the Communists, in the view of advocates
 of the Freedom Academy concept, has many different aspects.  It
 includes traditional military or "hot" warfare and guerrilla warfare
 (i.e., Korea and South Vietnam) and also conventional diplomatic
 maneuvering. But it also includes economic, political, and psycholog-
 i The bills introduced in the 88th Congress were : H.R. 352, introduced by Mr. Herlong
 on January 9, 1963; H.R. 1617, by Mr. Gubser on January 10, 1963; H.R. 5368, by Mr.
 Boggs on April 2, 1963; H.R. 8320, by Mr. Taft on August 30,.1963; H.R. 8767, by
 Mr. Schwelker on October 8, 1968; H.R. 10036, by Mr. Ashbrook on February 20, 1964;
 February 24, 1964 Mr. and H.R. 11718, by Mr. Ta20, lc tt on June  10077, by Mr. Schadeberg on
 F2 See Appendix, pp. 259-300.                                                         1

 ical warfare; subversion; and numerous other unconventional forms
 of conflict.
 The free world, according to the Freedom Academy concept, is do-
 ing a more or less adequate job of study and training only in the tradi-
 tional fields of military operations and diplomacy.  Little or no
 training and research is being undertaken in the various unconven-
 tional aspects of cold warfare which are just as important as, and may
 be more decisive in the long run than, traditional military operations
 and conventional diplomacy.
 The Communist bloc, on the other hand, beginning with the estab-
 lishment of the Lenin School in Moscow in the twenties, has been train-
 ing specialists in all forms of cold or unconventional warfare for
 almost 40 years. At the present time, scores of such schools exist in
 all parts of the Communist world-not. only behind the Iron Curtain,
 but in Red China, in Cuba, and, on a limited and covert scale, even
 within the borders of free nations. Many thousands of graduates of
 these schools, professionals in varied forms of unconventional war-
 fare, are daily working in all parts of the globe to undermine non-
 Cbmiuunist nations and promote Communist aims. The free. world
 does not have a trained counterforce on all levels of public and private
 life to engage and defeat these Communist "troy s."
 Advocates of Freedom Academy legislation believe that the free
 world needs such a force and that. their Academy proposal offers an
 effective means for developing one.
 The bills referred to the committee provide that a broad range of
 students would attend the Freedom Academy.  They would fall into
 three general categgories :
 1. Officials of the U.S. Government whose agencies are in any way
 involved in the TJ.S. effort to resist communism.
 2. Leaders from all walks of civilian life in this country (broad
 comprehension of the nature of the conflict in which we are engaged-
 and also citizen participation in it-are essential to the U.S. effort to
 preserve and strengthen freedom and resist communism).
 Students in this category would come from the ranks of management
 and labor, education,- religion, the arts and sciences, and also civic,
 veterans', women's, fraternal, professional, and similar groups.
 3. Leaders and potential leaders from all walks of life, governmental
 and private, from foreign countries. They would include representa-
 tives of our P; ATO and SEATO allies, as well as the newly independent
 nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where the knowledge of
 the real nature of communism and the cold war is essential if the
 United States is to be successful in resisting further Communist en-
 croachments and thus the weakening of freedom and its own position
 in all parts of the world.
 The Freedom Academy would be purely a research and educational
 institution. It would not engage in operational activities of any kind.
 Its students, however, whether citizens of this or foreign countries and
 whether Government officials or privately employed, would utilize the
 knowledge gained at the Academy to improve measures now being
 utilized to resist communism and to develop new operations, govern-

 Committee members also present : Representatives Joe R. Pool, of
 Texas; George F. Senner, Jr., of Arizona; and Charles L. Weitner, of
 Georgia.
 Staff members present : Francis J. McNamara, director, and Alfred
 M. Nittle, counsel.
 The CHAIRMAN. The subcommittee will come to order.
 The Chair would like to make a statement.
 Nine bills to establish a Freedom Commission and Academy were
 referred to the Committee on Un-American Activities during the last
 Congress.  Extensive hearings were held on these bills and the testi-
 mony has been printed and published in two parts.  In the 89th
 Congress, to date, eight bills have been referred to this committee.
 Five of these are bills identical to those which were offered by the
 same members in the last Congress; namely Representatives Herlong,
 Gubser, Boggs, Ashbrook, and Clausen.   he other three bills were
 offered in this Congress by Representatives Ichord, Gurney, and
 Buchanan. We are convened today to receive additional testimony
 upon these bills.
 Although the bills vary in certain details, they all have the same
 purpose, namely, to provide for the establishment, under Federal aus-
 pices, of a cold war educational and research institution as an-inde-
 pendent agency, to be managed by a seven-man Commission, whose
 chairman and members would be appointed by the President, subject
 to confirmation by the Senate.

 4             PROVIDING FOR A FREEDOM COMMIBBION
 The major difference between the bills before the committee appears
 to be that six make provision for an Advisory Committee and two
 for a Joint Congressional Freedom Committee. The bills provide for
 one or the other exclusively.
 The Advisory Committee is to be composed of representatives from
 executive agencies concerned with the Academy's objectives, to insure
 cooperation between the Academy and these agencies, to review the
 operations of the Commission, and report its findings annually to the
 President and the Congress.
 The Joint Congressional Freedom Committee is to be composed of
 14 members, equally divided between the Senate and the House, whose
 purpose is to make continued studies of the activities of the Commis-
 sion, to hold hearings and investigations on matters relating to its
 objectives, as well as to receive bills, resolutions, and other matters in
 the Senate or House relating to the Commission and on which the
 joint committee will report respectively to the Senate and the House
 through those members a pointed from the respective bodies.
 I direct that the bills, ILR. 470, H.R. 1033, II,2215, II.R. 2379,
 H.R. 4389, H.R. 5370, II.R. 5784, and II.R. 6700 be received in the
 record.'
 I now offer for the record the order of appointment of the subcom-
 mittee designated to conduct this hearing, as follows :
 To Mr. Fahaois J. MoN&MARA,
 Director, Committee on Un-American Activities:
 Pursuant to the provisions of the law and the Rules of this Committee, I
 hereby appoint a subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities, con-
 sisting of Honorable Richard Ichord and Honorable John M. Ashbrook as as-
 sociate members, and myself as Chairman, to conduct hearings in Washington,
 D.C., commencing on or about Tuesday, March 30, 1965, and at such other
 time or times thereafter and at such place or places as said subcommittee shall
 determine, on the following bills proposing passage of a "Freedom Commis-
 sion Act," and any other similar bills which may be referred to this Com-
 mittee: II.R. 470, H.R. 1033, H.R. 2215, H.R. 2370, H.R. 4389, II.R. 5370, and
 H.R. 5784.
 Please make this action a matter of Committee record.
 If any member indicates his inability to serve, please notify me.
 Given under my band this 24th day of March, 1965.
 /s/  Edwin E. Willis,
 EDWIN B. W=s.
 Chairman, Commiitec on Un-American Activities.
 We are glad to have with us a member of the full committee who
 has kindly consented to participate in these hearings and I hope that,
 since he is here, he can attend all the hearings and will consent to be-
 come a member of the subcommittee.
 Anyway, Mr. Welttier, of Georgia, is with us and we welcome him.
 The first witness this morning is our colleague, Mr. Gubser, who is
 author of the bill, II.R. 1033, one of the bills referred to.  Mr. Gubser,
 we appreciate your interest in this legislation and your offering of the
 bill.  We welcome your views.

 STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES S. GUBSER, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM CALIFORNIA
 Mr. GUBSER. Thank you very much.  I would request permission
 to insert a statement in the record and make a very few informal
 remarks.
 The CHAIRMAN. You may proceed as you wish.  If you want the
 statement introduced at this point it will be done.
 Mr. GUBSER. I would appreciate it at this point.
 The CHAIRMAN. It will be received at this point.
 (Congressman Grubser's prepared statement follows.)
 STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES S. GUBSER, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM CALIFORNIA
 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I deeply appreciate the oppor-
 tunity to appear before you to testify in behalf of my bill, H.R. 1033.
 There is no doubt that communism is spreading and that the territory of this
 planet which remains exclusively dedicated to freedom is diminishing. Though
 wishful thinkers say to themselves that test ban treaties, wheat sales, and other
 apparent improvements in East-West relations signal a permanent thaw in the
 cold war, a simple look around the globe reveals otherwise.  The truth is that
 we are losing the cold war !
 On December 18, 1963, I inserted a chart into the Conpresaional Record which
 I had prepared with the cooperation of the Library of Congress.  The chart
 shows that in 1917, 10.1 percent of the world's population lived in 8,603,000 square
 miles of Communist territory.  The growth and spread of communism has been
 gradual since that time, until as of last year 34.99 percent of the world's popu-
 lation (1,109,500,000 people)                                             lives in a Communist world which includes
 13,761,000 square miles.  I will submit this chart for inclusion in the record at
 the end of my testimony.1
 The world map is a seething blot of Communist-inspired trouble.  Can any
 rational man look at the globe and say we are not losing the cold war?
 In searching for a reason, it is easy to fall into the trap of oversimplification.
 Undoubtedly there are many reasons, but certainly one of the most significant
 is our failure to win the war' of propaganda.  Time after time the free world
 has responded with military action to combat communism.  But almost always
 the forces of subversion have done their work so effectively that military action
 has come too late.  Southeast Asia is the perfect example.  Laos fell to the
 forces of subversion which were unopposed until It was the late.  In Vietnam,
 the forces of subversion gained such a head start that the military response has
 been placed at almost an impossible disadvantage.  The same thing is happening
 in dozens of other places.
 It should be obvious by now that the Communist system of subversion is work-
 ing and that our response has been of the wrong kind and is too late.  In the
 battle for men's minds an initial advantage is frequently decisive, particularly
 in backward and impoverished areas.
 In view of our consistent failure to match Communist propaganda, does it not
 seem wise that we take stock of what has produced the success of our enemies
 and meet it on the ground of that success?
 When Lenin and his followers captured Russia, they established a training
 system that has grown to 6,000 special schools which teach the tactics of
 espionage, subversion, infiltration, agitation, and propaganda.
 Admittedly, this is not a proper free world tactic, nor would we want it to
 become our practice. The basis of freedom is freedom of choice, and we do not
 wish to impose our choice upon others.  To do so would be to defile the essence
 of freedom.  But to allow a vacuum into which Communist propaganda can
 move is to create an environment where the Communist way can win without
 opposition. This is not freedom of choice.

 6             PROVIDING FOR. A FREEDOM COMMISSION
 Our State Department hastily employs the cliche of "indoctrination" to indict
 any suggestion from non-State Department sources favoring a propaganda effort
 to influence people in favor of freedom as opposed to communism. This reaction
 is a carryover from the modern Intellectual's proper and justified respect for "aca-
 demie freedom." But it employs a basic fallacy.
 Academic freedom exists in an academic environment Where knowledge is
 freely available, But In the target areas for Communist propaganda, only Com-
 munist knowledge is available unless we present the other side. It is not indoctri-
 nation when one side presents Its case, knowing full well that the other side
 will do likewise. To reject our propaganda mission, then, Is to promote indoctri-
 nation rather than renounce it.
 Our long and consistent record of failures to meet the Communist propaganda
 offensive proves that it Is time to break the diplomatic monopoly which seems
 to consider any public relations or educational program that it does not suggest
 and control as "indoctrination."
 Psychological warfare, public relations, propaganda, or whatever you choose
 to call it, Is a science and a definite technique which must be learned through
 specialized instruction. Our diplomats have failed because they have not been
 trained In a highly skilled technique. It Is time we recognize that Communist
 propagandists have filled the vacuum caused by the inactivity of freedom's pro-
 ponents and are winning the war for men's minds.
 The purpose of my bill is to fill this vacuum and give our overseas personnel
 the training which will enable them to recognize Communist propaganda for
 what it is and resist It on the spot. By so doing I am convinced we can avoid
 the inevitable military action which always comes too late.
 Mr. Chairman, there are other features of my bill which could be discussed,
 for example, the provision for training foreign nationals. But the basic argument
 for this Important provision to the saine,  We must recognize the fact that the
 Communist propagandist is succeeding because he is allowed to operate in a
 vacuum and we must present a counterforce which denies this advantage.
 This legislation is certainly not perfect and perhaps needs amendment.  Per-
 haps an entirely new bill needs to be written. But the basic idea that we need
 a Freedom Academy is a sound recognition of the reality that freedom is losing
 to slavery and there is no present indication that the trend will change.
 Mr. Gulislli. Mr. Chairman, I had planned to do no more than sub-
 mit this statement, which is basically the same statement which I pre-
 sented to the committee last year, but through the kindness of your
 committee director I was just handed a copy of the State Depiartnlent's
 adverse report upon all of these bills, including nay' own.
 The CHAIRMAN. Will you yield at. this point? I anm very glad that
 you brought that up. I take it you want to make comments about it..
 Mr. Gunssn. I would like to make a few comments about it if I may.
 The CHAIRMAN. So that the record will be complete the letter of the
 State Department, addressed to me and dated March 29, 1965, will be
 inserted in the record at this point, and we will be glad to get your
 comments on the letter.

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 WASHINGTON
 The Department appreciates the opportunity to comment
 on H.R. 470, H.R. 1033, H.R. 2215, H.R. 2379, and H.R.
 4389, bills to create a Freedom Commission and Freedom
 Academy, which you forwarded to the Department.
 These bills are identical in purpose and scope to
 proposals submitted in previous sessions of Congress and
 on which the Department has commented.  On these occasions,
 we expressed appreciation of the purposes of the sponsors
 and recognized the merits of certain aspects of the pro-
 posal, but expressed the belief that the bill as a whole
 would not serve as a useful instrument of national policy.
 The sponsors of the Freedom Commission bills urge
 correctly, in the Department's view, that in our struggle
 with the forces of tyranny---and communism in particular---
 we must employ not only military strength but also all of
 the ~ppolitical, psychological, economic and other non-
 military means at our disposal.  The President has given
 to'the Department of State a primary role in marshalling
 all of our resources in these fields which cut across
 many broad areas of government responsibility.  The
 integrated efforts of the foreign affairs and security
 agencies are as vital in developing the overall strategy
 and tactics of the "cold war" as in carrying them out.
 Expertise and operational experience are as important in
 the formulation of policy as they are in its execution.
 For this reason, the Department seriously questions whether
 comprehensive and realistic plans for dealing with the
 infinitely complex problems of U.S. Foreign Affairs can be
 developed by a new, separate government agency, especially
 one without operational responsibilities.

 The Freedom Commission proposals place great stress
 upon the mobilization of private citizens---domestic and
 foreign---to fight the cold war, and upon a systematic
 orientation of our citizens against communism.  The pro-
 posals-contemplate that these tasks be undertaken on a
 large scale by the Executive branch of the government.
 While it is very useful in certain circumstances to train
 private U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, our primary
 need---and hence our first priority---is to improve in
 all possible ways the training of government personnel
 involved in the day-to-day operation of our foreign
 affairs.
 While the cost of implementing the Freedom Commission
 program has never been specified, various proponents have
 stated it would amount to several million dollars a year.
 We feel there are more effective ways to use such expendi-
 tures in our struggle for freedom.
 Another problem raised by several of the Freedom
 Commission bills is federal control.  Under the provision
 entitled "Information Center", the Freedom Commission
 would be "authorized to prepare, make and publish text-
 books and other materials, including training films,
 suitable for high schools, college and community level
 instruction".  There is further provision that the
 Commission can distribute such material on "such terms
 and conditions as it shall determine".
 The Department doubts the value of any effort to
 centralize and standardize the dissemination of information
 in such areas. This would appear to be a marked departure
 from the traditional role of the Federal Government in the
 field of political education.
 For these and other reasons, the Department cannot
 support the bills to create a Freedom Commission which
 are now before you,

 The Bureau of the Budget advises that from the
 standpoint of the Administration's program, there'is
 no objection to the submission of this report.
 Mr. GussER. Mr. Chairman, it is very interesting to me to note the
 changed line in the State Department opposition to this bill. Last
 year, if you will recall, a great point was made of the fact that it is
 not the proper function of the United States Government to attempt to
 indoctrinate people of other nations.
 My statement which I just filed was addressed to that point, and I
 quote part of it :
 Our State Department hastily employs the cliche of "indoctrination" to indict
 any suggestion from non-State Department sources favoring a propaganda effort
 to influence people in favor of freedom as opposed to communism. This reaction
 is a carryover from the modern intellectual's proper and justified respect for
 "academic freedom.", But it employs a basic fallacy.
 Academic freedom exists in an academic environment where knowledge is freely
 available.  But in the target areas for Communist propaganda, only Communist
 knowledge is available unless we present the other side. It is not indocttination
 when one side presents its case, knowing full well that the other side will do
 likewise.   To reject our propaganda mission, then, is to promote indoctrination
 rather than renounce it.
 I note that the State Department's adverse report this year does not
 dwell on the point of indoctrination. Instead it takes the tack that this
 is Federal control.  This to me is absolutely amazing because now the
 State Department has absolute control of this propaganda effort and
 they are objecting to extending it. to a system whereby individual
 citizens could participate in carrying out that important function.
 This bill would, in effect, be a relaxation of Federal control and the
 spreading of the responsibility to more of our citizens instead of to
 just a very few.
 The events of the world about us, Mr. Chairman, and I don't need
 to relate them, are clear-cut evidence of the fact that we or the State
 Department or whoever is responsible for this job has not assumed
 the responsibility and has not done anything about it.  I would like
 to leave you with just this one point: If you accept the State Depart-
 ment's thesis that the Department, the Department alone, has all the
 knowledge that is required to do this job and has the sole responsibility
 of carrying on this very, very important mission, and as long as that
 policy continues to produce a worldwide result like that which is
 happening before our very eyes today, then I say we are inviting the
 frustration which causes extremist groups to spring up all over this
 country. We are creating a situation where extremist groups will take
 over that which the State Department has failed to do and that which
 the State Department refuses to give anyone else the right to do.

 If we have had irresponsible statements made about communism, if
 we have had irresponsible propaganda that has gotten into worldwide
 news channels as a result of extremist groups, it is because of the
 frustration that has resulted from the fact that the State Department
 continues, year in and year out, to do nothing about solving this
 problem.
 Mr. Chairman, I didn't intend to make a speech, but I get pretty
 exercised on this subject and I sincerely hope and pray that this com-
 mittee will once again face up to its responsibility, like it always does,
 and that it will report out a bill and give the house a chance to vote
 on it, in spite of the State Department's objections.  Thank you,
 Mr. Chairman.
 The CrrATRMAN. The committee is very grateful for your views.  I
 do remember very clearly tint the whole tturden of Ambassador IIarri-
 man's testimony last year was built around the word "indoctrination"
 and, I too, was troubled by the fact that nowhere in this latest expres-
 sion of views is that word used.
 Am I correct?
 Mr. Gunsmt. That is correct as I read it.
 The CrrararAN.. I said last year that this ought to he made a matter
 of record. We have bills tip here.. apparently. from two sources. There
 are some who have a feeling that if the Freedom Academy bill should
 pass, the operation will be 'taken over`, by the State Department.
 On the other hand, here we see the State Department acknowledging
 that we intend no such thing.  We certainly will not, because we can-
 not involve this Academy or this ('ommission in formulation of for-
 eign policy or an thing else.
 Mr. GunsEx. Of course not-.
 The CIr.lr1urAN. It is none of our business in Congress.  That is
 their department.  But. certainly there ought to be a way to have an
 institution of this kind which, on the one hand, respects the running
 of our foreign policy by the State Department and, on the other hand,
 serves as an educational center for the purposes stated in this bill.
 Mr. GURSER. Mr. Chairnnan, it seems to me that there is another
 point: which I failed to mention; that too often American policy is to
 react rather than net; and always when something happens which is
 adverse to our interests and the rest of the world, the official propaa-
 ganda line or the reaction doesn't come immediately-it comes tomor-
 row or the next day-because somebody had to consult with ]lead-         ?
 quarters back in Washington before they could act. We all know, as
 people who deal with the news columns, that the time to rebut some-
 thing that is adverse to your posit ion is in the same article. that prints
 it. in the first place. On the second day the react ion is never as etlective
 as the action on the day that it actually happens.  This is one of [lie
 things that trained people could do for us.
 They would have the knowledge and they would have the ability to
 wet. instead of reacting. Action as for more productive of results t'aaan
 reaction.
 Mr. Icrrortn. Mr. Chairman , I want. to commend my colleagite, Mr.
 Gubser, for his appearance before the committee today and taking
 interest in this area and introducing a. hill because. I feel very much
 like the gentleman from California, that this is one of the most im-

 The gentleman witness is also a member of the Armed Services
 Committee and is very familiar with the military aspects of the con-
 flict in South Vietnam. How do you feel that this Freedom Commis-
 sion or Freedom Academy could have helped our country in the con-
 flict in South Vietnam?
 Mr. GLIBBER. I will only address myself to one small aspect of that
 question, if I may. We 'have dedicated, competent people, and this is
 nothing against them, but I feel, if we had had more people in Viet-
 nam right along who could take the offensive propagandawise, that
 perhaps our position with the Vietnamese themselves would have been
 more clearly understood, but as it stands now we wait, for something to
 happen which is adverse to our interests and then we explain our
 position and we react to it, and this is never a favorable public rela-
 tions position.
 Had we had more people who would instinctively react to a situa-
 tion and act then, I think that we wouldn't be in the position of con-
 stantly explaining our actions and more than likely there would have
 been a great deal more political stability in South Vietnam than we
 have experienced up until now, and we all agree that the political in-
 stability is responsible in a large measure for the military instability
 of the situation.
 I think the benefit of this bill will come from having trained people
 on the spot qualified to make immediate judgment. as to what could be
 done to our advantage. It would'be a cumulative thing. There would
 be no one dramatic incident which you could point to, but if it were
 done day in and day out by trained people then you would have a
 cumulative effect.
 Air. IcrroRu. I think the gentleman is familiar with the fact that
 the State Department is also sponsoring more or less a substitute for
 this bill called the National Academy for Foreign Affairs. I believe
 that is the name of it. What do you consider the advantages in your
 bill over the Department of State bill, namely, the National Academy
 of Foreign Affairs?
 Mr. GLIBBER. I certainly am not opposed to the State Department's
 idea of a national Foreign Service academy. I would strongly favor
 it, but the thing is that this does not go below the diplomatic echelon,
 and I maintain that anybody in the military or in the consular service
 where they have a reasonable degree of responsibility should be trained
 in these techniques. The State Department proposal is not. a substitute
 for this bill, though I am in favor of it. It will only be an enriched
 course in diplomacy. It will not be a course in basic public relations,
 and that is what I consider this Freedom Academy proposal to be,
 among other things.
 Furthermore, by taking the American people into your confidence
 we would make them a part of the activit . The American people are
 able to assume this responsibility. The ability to think and act prop-
 erly and in the national interest isn't confined to the State Department.
 We can support. State Department and U.S. Information Agency
 activity if we have an informed populace at home that understands
 these things.
 I think if we would have had the Freedom Academy in existence
 10 years ago you perhaps wouldn't be getting some of the mail that you
 are getting from some of these people who believe that our position

 in Vietnam is wrong. I think they would understand the basics of
 Communist propaganda. and Communist infiltration and they would
 be supporting us rather than making our task more difficult.
 Mr. IcHORD. Mr. Chairman, all of the bills provide for an Advisory
 Committee with the exception of II.R. 1033, introduced by the wit-
 ness, and IL.R. 5784, introduced by our colleage, Mr. Ashbrook.
 Your bill and Mr. Ashbrook's bill, Mr. Gubser, provide for a Joint
 Congressional Freedom Committee.  I am a little concerned about
 setting up a joint committee. I wonder if the members of the com-
 mittee would really have the time to perform the duties required in the
 bill. I would like you to comment on that aspect of difference.
 Mr. Gunara. I think you may very well have an excellent point and
 I want to make my intentions in introducing this bill clearly known.
 It is presented as an idea. There is no pride in authorship: l have no
 illusion that if it were passed it would be in that form. It is merely to
 make my support of the idea known, to present it for your considera-
 tion.
 I have full confidence that this committee could improve it and come
 up with something that would be in the national interest and I would
 support it.
 Mr. IciioRD. Another point. is your bill provides a salary of $20,000
 for each member of the Commission and a salary of $20,500 for the
 chairman of the Commission. Of course, since the bills were intro-
 duced last year we have passed the civil service increase ratings, and
 you believe that. the salaries should be adjusted accordingly?
 Mr. GuBsER. I certainly would think so. As I stated, it is only an
 - idea draft. It is the principle and the objective that I am after. The
 details I think you are more qualified to work out.
 Mr. Iciionm. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

 Mr. AsnmiooK. Thank you very much.  Like my colleague, Mr.
 Ichord, I, too, welcome you to the committee and thank you, Mr. Gub-

 morning.
 Getting back to the point of the Joint Congressional Freedom Com-
 mittee as against. the Advisory Committee,                           would like to ask your
 opinion on one specific point, and this I know has been a matter of
 concern to me. One of the reasons that. I have not been favorable to
 the Advisory Committee concept is the fact that on the Advisory Com-
 mittee you would have one representative each from the followuig
 agencies and departments. As I recall I think they are State; Defense;
 Health, Education, and Welfare; CIA; FBI; AID; and the USIA.
 It seems to me that the problem we have here is that the State Depart-
 ment has pretty much transcended in this field and it would end up, for
 want of a better phrase, literally running the Freedom Academy. I
 think if there is anything we are looking for it is the idea of academic
 freedom and independence from the Government, to get away from
 Federal control.
 What, would be your thinking on the matter of the Joint Con  es-
 sional Freedom Committee as against the Advisory Committee? Does
 it seem that this is a danger in the approach that we see in the Advisory
 Committee?

 Mr. GUBSER. Once again I would not like to deal with the details
 and specifics. I would like those to be developed by you people after
 your hearings and your deliberations. I would just say generally that
 I would not be in favor of domination by any one school of thought
 or any one agency.
 On the other hand, I would not be one that would want to completely
 freeze the State Department out. I would want their influence to be
 completely felt, as it should be. This is the agency that is responsible
 for our foreign policy, but I do think that the base should be broad-
 ened and certainly all ideas ought to have a fair chance of being con-
 sidered.
 Whatever technique or whatever commission or joint committee
 would accomplish that objective I would be for, but I am not prepared
 to state specifically what I think, at this point, it should be.
 Mr. AsuBROOK. I know in my discussions of this bill with people
 from the academies and professors, and so forth, their biggest fear is
 in setting up something that will not really be independent, that will
 not really have what is classically known as academic freedom. And I
 would be most interested in your thinking on this question, because I
 know this is one thing the committee is going to wrestle with-how we
 do something like this, make it a meaningful part of our policy, and
 yet at the same time give it a certain amount of freedom, which could
 mean its going off halfcocked in one direction or another.
 This is 'a real delicate area where we have some difficulty in trying
 to ride two horses and have a policy that we want, a strong policy on
 the cold war vis-a-vis the Soviet Union, and at the same time have
 academic freedom.
 How do you reconcile these?
 Mr. GuBsuR. You just may want to consider expanding the Com-
 mission idea to include representatives of the minority and majority
 on, say, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Com-
 mittee of the Congress, but here again I wouldn't want congressional
 influence to dominate the policy.  However, it certainly should be
 there and it might be a leavening influence.
 Mr. AsiIBROax. But you feel that a Freedom Academy of this type
 should have differences of opinion?  You might have people on the
 Academy that say we should bomb North Vietnam and those who
 would say we negotiate, and each would have a forum for their
 opinions.
 Mr. GTBSER. Of course. Some day I hope this country comes back
 to the point where a difference of opinion is respected.
 Mr. ASHBROOS.. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Gubser.
 Mr. GuBSER. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF HON. TORN M, ASHBROOK, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM OHIO
 Mr. AsIrBROOK. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to say
 a few words not only in behalf of the idea expressed in the concept of
 a Freedom Academy, but in particular on the specific bill winch I
 introduced.
 As most of you know, my bill is a companion bill with that of Mr.
 Gubser's, so many of the same statements which Mr. Gubser made
 would be equally applicable to my bill.

 PROVIDING FOR A FREEDOM COMMISSION
 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM OHIO
 How Is it possible that a small group of ragged Russian revolutionaries, in a
 few short decades of history, could place almost one third of the world's popula-
 tion in the grip of slavery?
 The answer lies, in part, in the concept and implementation of total political
 war which these revolutionaries and their successors have developed over the
 years.  As early as 1928 the U.S.S.R. was graduating finely trained agents
 schooled in the political, psychological, economic, technological, and organiza-
 tional aspects of spreading global communism.
 In contrast, the free world has yet to establish an organization or agency to
 combat this onslaught on the very existence of free men or to develop an inte-
 grated body of operational knowledge to extend the areas of freedom.
 This is the purpose of pending legislation to establish a Freedom Commission.
 Specifically, H.R. 5784, which I have submitted would train Government of-
 ficials, private U.S. citizens, and foreign students concerning the strategy and
 tactics of the international Communist conspiracy.  A Freedom Commission,
 an independent agency, would be established in the executive branch, to oversee
 and direct the program.
 The Commission would be empowered to establish a Freedom Academy for the
 express purpose of :
 (1) developing systematic knowledge about the international Communist
 conspiracy;
 (2) development of counteraction to the international Communist conspiracy
 into an operational science that befits and bespeaks the methods and values of
 free men; and to achieve this purpose the entire area of counteraction is to be
 thoroughly explored and studied, with emphasis on the methods and means that
 may be best employed by private citizens and nongovernmental organizations and
 the methods and means available to Government agencies other than the methods
 and means already being used ;
 (3) the education and training of private citizens concerning all aspects of the
 international Communist conspiracy ;
 (4) the education and training of persons in Government service concerning
 all aspects of Communist conspiracy.
 The legislation would also establish an information center to disseminate in-
 formation and materials which will assist persons and organizations to increase
 their understanding of the true nature of the Communist conspiracy. When one
 remembers that organizations such as the American Bar Association, the Na-
 tional Education Association, and The American Legion, among others, have
 stressed the urgent need for responsible information and education on the Com-
 munist conspiracy, this aspect of the Freedom Academy legislation is of particu-
 lar value.
 Also to be established by this legislation is a Joint Congressional Freedom Com-
 mittee, which shall make continued studies of the activities of the Commission
 and of problems relating to the development of counteraction to the international
 Communist conspiracy.
 When one reflects that it was just 1 year after Charles Lindbergh made his
 historic flight across the Atlantic that the Soviet Union began sending trained
 personnel around the world, is It any wonder that they are winning in this struggle
 for survival and the areas of freedom diminish year after year?
 Mr. AsHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, with each day's headlines reporting
 new incidents showing the Communist Party's growing grip on Indo-
 nesia-and I just point this out as one example-here is a news article,
 which I would also ask permission to have inserted in the record fol-
 lowing these remarks, that shows how it is being done over there.
 The CHAIRMAN. That will be done. The insertion will be made.'
 Mr. ASIIBROOK. It also shows why the United States desperately
 needs to face the facts and start a Freedom Academy to train demo-
 cratic leadership to fight back right where the cold war is being lost.

 That, of course, is at the village level and the grassroots precinct level.
 The CHAIRMAN. Would you yield?
 Mr. A8HBROOK. Yes.
 The CHAIRMAN (to group of students). I might say that the com-
 mittee is pleased to have you students visit us.  You are always
 welcome.
 Mr. ASIIIIR00H. The organizational tactics described in the article
 which is being inserted, an article written by Neil Sheehan, are an
 exact copy of tactics developed by that master of Communist tactics of
 mass organization and propaganda, Willi Munzenberg.  This was
 developed in Germany in the 1920's.
 Anyone who is interested may learn the whole story by reading
 Ruth Fischer's book, Stalin and German Communism..  Munzenbarg
 not only developed these forms of mass organization in Germany;
 he was also a secret officer of the Communist International at the same
 time, which liked his techniques and admired his genius so much that
 it had them taught in the Communist schools of revolution, such as
 the Lenin Institute.
 The Comintern even sent members of Asian Communist parties-
 including, we may be sure, some of the early leaders of the Indonesian
 Communist Party-to Germany to train and work under Munzenberg
 and learn through on-the'ob training all the skills of mass political
 organization we now see destroying freedom in Indonesia, expelling
 United States businessmen, and humiliating United States diplomats.
 I wonder, Mr. Chairman, when we will learn that the cold war is
 no task for amateurs, that kids from Keokuk and Pocatello are not
 going to save countries like the Congo and Indonesia; that. we have to
 train some foreigners in the skills they will need to cope with the
 Communist wreckers and create their own independence, free and
 democratic organizations to build better lives for their citizens.
 As you read the article you see how the other side-and when I say
 "the other side," of course I recognize the fact that we are in a
 struggle; I think many of us do not really in our day-to-day living
 reflect upon the point that we are in a cold war struggle--trains
 people; that you can go to Moscow, you can o to their various insti-
 tutes, and learn something about their beliefs.' Of course, we disagree
 with their beliefs, but they learn their task well and they go back to
 their-country. In a free government such as ours, our goal is never
 going to be the indoctrination, the instilling of motives in people, so
 when they go back to their country they will subvert. I think the dif-

 Approved For Rec9Q5A-g1A3 ,&JP           000600074901-8
 ference between the Freedom Academy and the Lenin Institute, the
 type of cold war strategy of the Kremlin, is the fact that we can open
 up our Academy, or we can open up our Commission, to people
 throughout the world.
 Let them come in on a free-exchange-of-ideas basis, learn about
 communism, learn about our system of government, and then go back
 to their country, not with the idea in mind of reporting back to people
 here in Washington as they do at the Lenin Institute, not with the
 idea in mind of subverting or indoctrinating, but going back to their
 countries and becoming spokesmen for freedom, spokesmen for our
 way of life.  I happen to think that one of the reasons why we are
 failing to some extent in the cold war struggle is the fact that we
 don't even recognize it exists. And to me, this would be the most
 single attribute and factor in our favor if we would enact a bill like
 this, in that it would show to the rest of the world that we really think
 there is a struggle; that we have set forth on our part an effort to
 train people in the ways of the cold war struggle; that if we would
 do this we would have not only Americans who could learn some-
 thing about communism, but many hundreds, maybe literally thou-
 sands, from throughout the world who could come to this Academy.
 I know in the hearings, as I look through them, we tend to under-
 rate the value of such a Commission as a. Mecca for students through-
 out the world who want to learn about freedom, who want to learn
 more about communism. And I would make that point, and stress
 that point, that a Commission of this type is not only valuable to the
 United States, but because we are a leader in the world it would be
 valuable to the rest of the world.
 It would give a forum to many students who come into this country
 on an exchange basis.  Maybe they would be from the state depart-
 ments of free countries throughout the world, maybe they would be
 military people, but they could come to our country, could learn about
 freedom, could learn about communism, in an effective manner.  I
 would stress that point as strongly as any other factor in favor of the
 establishment of a Freedom Commission.  This article in the New
 York Times of March 28 points up the importance of it.
 I certainly hope, Mr. Chairman, that in this session of Congress we
 can make such a step, and I certainly pledge all of my efforts both
 as a member of this committee and as an interested Member of Con-
 gress in legislation of this type.

 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
 STATEMENT OF HON. DON H. CLAUSEN, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM CALIFORNIA
 Our colleague, Congressman Clausen, has offered a, bill, H.R. 5370.
 He was to be here, but other appointments in his schedule have kept
 him away, so I now insert in the record his statement about this
 legislation.
 (Congressman Clausen's prepared statement follows:)
 STATEMENT OF HON. DON H. CLAUSEN, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
 CALIFORNIA
 I am happy again to have the opportunity to join with the many informed and
 distinguished Americans who have endorsed the Freedom Academy proposal.  I
 sponsored such legislation in the 88th Congress.  In the current Congress, 1
 have introduced H.R. 5370.
 In the hearings conducted by this committee during the last Congress, I testi-
 fied on behalf of this proposal at some length.  As these hearings continue, I
 expect to have the pleasure of extending my remarks.  For the moment, I wish
 to reaffirm my position with respect to this bill. In the light of the grave
 international situation, it seems that every passing hour witnesses a growing
 urgency for the adoption of the Freedom Academy proposal.
 I want to direct the attention of the committee particularly to the provisions
 of section 10 of my bill.  This, in fact, conforms to provisions of other bills
 before this committee, particularly section 10 of H.R. 470, H.R. 2379, H.R. 4389,
 H.R. 2215, and H.R. 6700.  This section deals with the security check of per-
 sonnel who participate in the operation or program of the. Freedom Academy.
 My bill, and other bills which I have noted, require in general a security
 investigation of (1) all persons employed by the Freedom Commission, (2) any
 person who is permitted to have access to classified information, and (3) at the
 discretion of the Commission, of any individual under consideration for training
 at the Academy.  It is noted that none of the bills, including my own, require
 a security check of members of the Freedom Commission.  These members are
 appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
 Not only does the bill fail to make provision for a security check of the Com-
 mission members, but there is presently no statutory provision of which I am
 aware that would require it.  However, it is true that for some years past, in-
 vestigations for appointments of this sort have been normally required under
 executive order.  Executive Order 10450, promulgated by President Eisenhower
 in April 1953, presently in effect, requires that the appointment of every civil
 officer or employee in any department or agency of the Government shall be
 made the subject of an investigation.
 Under the executive order, the scope of the investigation is determined accord-
 ing to the degree of adverse effect the occupant of the position to be filled could
 bring about-by virtue of the nature of the position-on the national security.
 Although a "national agency check" is required of all appointees, a full field
 investigation is required only for "sensitive positions," that is to say, those
 positions which would have a materially adverse effect on the national security.
 While I think that there is no question that membership on the Freedom Com-
 mission is a "sensitive position," this may, on the other hand, depend upon one's
 point of view.. It must also be realized that executive orders are matters within
 the authority of the President.  They may be amended or revoked at his
 discretion.
 Nevertheless, in view of the fact that prior practice and existing executive
 orders have required preappointment investigation, together with the further
 consideration that appointments are subject to the approval of the Senate, I have
 adopted the position of other bills which contain no express provision for investi-
 gation of members of the Commission.  However, while adopting that position
 in the proposal, I am not certain that such a requirement should necessarily be
 omitted.  I feel it is a matter the committee should review in some depth, as I
 believe it will.  I want to make clear that my omission of such a requirement does
 not necessarily express my settled conviction on. this point.

 I want to say further that I greatly appreciate the thoroughness of the com-
 mittee's inquiry on the subject of the Freedom Academy bills.  Your hearings
 in the last Congress were extensive and commendable. I believe that those of us
 who have submitted proposals on this issue are hopeful that an early and favor-
 able report upon one of these bills can be made to the Congress.
 The Cn:AIRMAN. Since this is a new Congress, the committee has
 voted that the hearings conducted last year be regarded as included in
 this year's hearings.
 (At this point Mr. Pool entered the hearing room.)
 The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is Mr. Edgar Ansel Mowrer.
 Would yyou please come forward, sir?
 Mr. Alowrer, we are delighted that you could find time to appear
 before our committee this morning. I know, and a lot of people know,
 about your background. But. I think for the record it might be better
 for me to state it than for you.
 Colleagues, Mr. Mowrer has been a newsman, writer, and columnist
 for 50 years, and that is a long time.  He covered World War I for
 the Chicago Daily Neu&.  He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for
 overseas reporting in 1932. During World War II, he was Deputy
 Director of the Office of War Information.  He has been a radio
 commentator as well as a columnist on foreign affairs. A trustee of
 Freedom House, Mr. Mowrer is also the author of 10 books on inter-
 national and foreign affairs, including : An End to Al!ake Believe in
 1961, A Good Time to be Alive in 1960, and Challenge and Decision
 in 1950.  Your service to your profession and to the country is well
 recognized and stretches out for many years, and I am glad to make
 these remarks a part. of the record. We are very much interested in
 having your views on the bills we have pending before us this morning,
 sir.  You may proceed.
 Mr. Mowinn. I do not have to introduce myself, Mr. Chairman?
 For the record, my name is Edgar Ansel .1owrer.  I am a syndi-
 cated columnist on world affairs.
 The CHAIRMAN. If you wish to expand on your formal education and
 further experience you are welcome.
 Mr. MowREn. For 26 years a foreign correspondent, chiefly in
 Europe, but in most parts of the world.  I have come here to testify
 in favor of the bill to create a Freedom Academy because I consider
 that it may help us to deal with the main problem of our time.
 Looking back over the many years I am terribly struck with the
 parallelism between the behavior of F urope in the 1930's, democratic
 Europe, and our behavior since 1945.
 It is true that there have been some notable differences.  Europe,
 Britain, and France neglected their defenses, while at the same time
 they were trying to persuade themselves that Hitler, Mussolini, and
 their cohorts did not mean business.  The result was it catastrophe of
 which all the details are known.
 The CHAIRMAN. I think at this point. I should ask you two or three
 questions that will further demonstrate your experience.
 Did your experience overseas include firsthand contact with Com-
 munists?

 Approved For Re       IJ)51f/13F~I  WF     Q     00060007001-8
 Mr. MowRER. Very decidedly so. As a foreign correspondent of
 neutral America, it was the duty of a good one to get in contact with
 ermany
 people of every political party.  Thus, in G, where I spent
 a land time, I knew everybody from Prince Louis Ferdinand of
 Prussia to Mr. Neumann the head of the Berlin Communists.
 In Paris I knew Mr. aachin, who was the second leader, and some
 minor figures.  In England I knew Claude Coburn, who was at that
 time publishing a Communist weekly.  With all of these people I had
 as friendly relations as one could ever have had with the Communists,
 which is not saying too much, because there is always an element in
 which their public affairs, you might say, their, convictions, predomi-
 nate over their personal relationships.
 The CHAIRMAN. It is my information that at one time, at least, you
 wouldn't have been in line to win a popularity contest, so I ask you :
 Were you not at one time simultaneously denied entry to they Soviet
 Union, Nazi Germany, and. Fascist Italy?
 Mr. MOWRER. That is true. At one time I had the honor, doubtful
 honor, whichever you choose to call it, of having been refused re-
 entrance into the Soviet Union, into Nazi Germany from which I was
 literally expelled, and into Facist Italy where I had made the march
 on Rome with Mussolini and then quarreled with him because of
 his intolerable and arrogant and imperialistic behavior.
 The CHAIRMAN. Did Nazi Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels
 ever express an interest, in one fashion or another, in you?
 Mr. MOWRER. Yes, sir.  In September 1939 another correspondent,
 H. R. Knickerbocker, now dead, and I filed a story in which we gave
 the world the full details on the amounts of money that the Nazi
 leaders had more or less illegally stashed overseas for their personal
 use, just in case.  This provoked from my former acquaintance, Dr.
 Paul Joseph Goebbels, a vicious attack on the radio, which he made
 personally, declaring that he would give a. division of German troops
 to lay hands on those dirty American so-and-so's, Knickerbocker and
 Mowrer.  Personally I never felt prouder.
 The CHAIRMAN. I compliment, you.   Now will you proceed in your
 own way to express why you favor these bills and relate to us your
 further experiences, if you will.
 Mr. MowRER. In the course of my experience with Communists and
 other people, I became aware of how hard it was for Americans who
 have never lived under a totalitarian regime to understand the work-
 ings, and not only the physical workings, but the mentality and the
 infinite cheating and dissimulation which was part of the Nazi as well
 as the Communist idea of spreading their rule.
 For instance, when I went to Russia in 1936 those two English
 Socialists, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, had just published a book on
 the Soviet Union in very flattering terms which was the laughingstock
 of the foreign correspondents in Moscow. They explained how, with-
 out any adequate preparation, the two Webbs had come to Moscow,
 listened to what the Russian Communists told them, written it all
 down like truth, and produced a book.  And the common comment
 among the men overseas was, "This is just lovely, only there isn't a
 word of it that corresponds with Soviet action,' which is the only
 thing that counts.

 I was in Moscow in November-December 1936, attending the ratifi-
 cation of the new Soviet constitution, allegedly the most democratic
 in the world.  It was indeed a wonderful document, setting out many
 civil rights, except. for two or three provisos which most of the for-
 eigners overlooked.                           One was that the rule of the Communist. Party
 should never be in any way upset or diminished and the other was
 that none of this had any relation to political crimes.
 Since almost anything in Russia was defined as a political crime,
 this meant that of course most. of the constitution was undone by these
 two little provisos, and this escaped tourists.
 This seems to have escaped even one former American Ambassador
 in Moscow, Joe Davies. You will remember, perhaps, that during the
 war, in 1943, there was presented here in Washington a film by Mr. Joe
 Davies called Mission to Moscow, which was based on his book and
 which gave such a caricature, if you will excuse me, of the real condi-
 tions in the Soviet Union that a group of us retired to the nearest: cafe
 to laugh it off.
 What I am driving at, Mr. Chairman, is that it seems to me that we
 are lacking in the understanding of the basics of this international
 power conspiracy-ideology, pseudoreligion, whatever you wish to
 call it-which threatens us at many points over the globe.
 There again it reminds me of a time when a very distinguished
 Frenchman asked me to come to Paris and tell him what Ilitler was
 going to do. I did my best, after 10 years' acquaintance with the
 Fuehrer.  I thought I knew about it.  When it was allover. he looked
 at me and said, "I lust don`t believe a word of it. Hitler is a man
 like everybody else.'
 For many years we did the best we could to believe that Stalin was
 a man like anybody else, and if so, God help everybody else.  And we
 have since tried to believe that it is possible for a Communist regime
 to change radically without ceasing to be Communist.
 Therefore, because we want peace we are continually'    rasping at
 straws, hoping.  Surely, if our wartime President, Flit-in many'
 ways, in my opinion, a great Presidents-had really done his homework
 thoroughly or had the proper advisers about him during the war, he
 would not have thought that he could manage Stalin. If the Amer-
 ican administration at that time had rubbed their noses a little more
 thoroughly into the Communist thing-and I am not. blaming any one
 person, for this was a general frame of mind, as you will remember-
 they would not, have believed that, because the Russians had signed the
 Yalta Treaty agreeing to set u~i democratic regimes in all the east
 European countries, they had the slightest- intention of abiding by
 r a "democratic" regime is part of what is known as Aesopian
 it. FOrr,
 language in Communist parlance, which means, well, just as Mr.
 Goering used to say, "I determine who is a Jew," the Kremlin deter-
 mines what is a democratic regime. These were very grave errors in
 my opinion. I think that. our doing nothing about communism in
 China was a very grave error.  I do not say that we could have pre-
 vented the taking over of China by communism.  I don't know.
 I do know that we made no serious effort and I do know, if you will
 permit me to quote a man without mentioning his name, that one of
 the very senior officials in the State Department had dinner at. my
 house., along with Congressman Walter Judd, and discussed hotly

 Approved For Re Rap-(W/13 1;,,IRIA&PP&Q0006000 ij01-8
 whether or not Red China could ever be a danger to the United States,
 and the meeting broke up when the State Department official said,
 "Congressman, I don't believe that anything can happen in the Far
 East in the next 50 years that can seriously damage the interests of
 the United States."
 I think that we have to realize-that is what I am trying to say
 with all these details-that most Americans still do not know very
 much about a totalitarian regime or about communism; that they are
 inclined to believe any sign that they are transforming themselves
 or thawing or anything of the kind; and that, therefore, we have been
 led into some difficulties such as the one in Laos, which we would not
 be in had it been understood that any sort of coalition government
 with Communists was inevitably, in their eyes, a pretext for a take-
 over. They have been trying to take over ever since; as far as they
 could without openly going into all-out war, and it is only our recent
 military counteractions that, in my opinion, have prevented them from
 doing it.
 My friends in the State Department, and I am happy to say I still
 have a good many, counter with this : That it is impossible for a
 citizen or Congressman to know the situation, what should be done
 about it, understand it, unless he is in possession of all the facts.
 By "all the facts," they mean the latest reports from all over the
 world.  This I consider a total mistake, for wasn't Chamberlain,
 wasn't Daladier, in possession of all the facts, that is to say, the day-
 to-day facts that had been provided by the admirable British and
 French overseas services? Of course, to be sure, as I note one of my
 predecessors last February testified here, they admitted later that
 they had never read Mein. Kamp f . To assume that you could under-
 stand the Nazi regime in Germany or Adolf Hitler himself or esti-
 mate what he was going to do without having read Mein Kampf was
 a terrible and tragic error. It is my belief that there should be an
 independent, Government-supported but essentially independent, non-
 partisan, nonparty Freedom Academy which offers to a group an
 intensive course, not only necessarily on communism, but on all the
 enemies of American freedom.
 I can also see from, reading the newspapers and listening to my
 daughter's friends, meeting students, that.there is even a great lack
 in our country of the essential implications of American freedom.
 So it seems to me that any authoritative body which would give an
 intensive course, what and why freedom, who and what is threatening
 freedom, how they are doing it, what are the essences of these various
 things that are threatening our freedom, if this had, as it should
 have, high-power, opinion-making, influential citizens, including-
 why not .-some foreigners, it could bring about a change and not
 come into any conflict with the State Department, for surely the last
 thing such an academy would have the nerve to try to do is to set a
 policy.
 (At this point Mr. Senner entered the hearing room.)
 The CHAIRMAN. I am glad you say that and I want you to develop
 that point.  In other words as I understand it, and I am not an
 author, the authors of these bills don't envisage the Freedom Academy
 or Freedom Commission as making foreign policy or speaking for
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Amroved Forag gW299R/~7/Aj,,Pa
 F4&#46R000600070001-8
 our Government vis-a-vis our relations with other governments. You
 agreed with that?
 Mr. MownEn. It ought not to be done and would not be done
 I do not think that any Freedom Academy or any body which is a
 study body should have, in any way, that power. Certainly they may
 try to influence foreign policy as citizens. The students who come out
 of it may have learned something which enables them to think that this
 or that. change could well be made in the policy.
 Then they should publish, where they can, reports and if this Acad-
 emy had sufficient stature I am quite certain that what they said would
 ripple out through the country.  The people would begin to give
 credence to what they said.  Think only of the foreign element. Look
 at the new rulers of many of the Afican and Asian states.  They
 are fine people.  They are patriots.  Many of them have taken great
 dangers and run the risk of death to make their countries independent,
 but so far as the world about them is concerned, they are babies. It is
 not their fault. They have had no o portunity to have any experience
 and no occasion to study the matter thoroughly.
 Therefore, many of them are patsies or pushovers for Communist
 agitators.  We learn now that the Government of Burundi, after
 imagining for a long time that Red China was really their great friend,
 found that Red China had been involved in a conspiracy to get rid of
 their government; that was all.
 So they have now put out the Red Chinese.  Had the three or four,
 or whoever, in Burundi had training at the Freedom Academy they
 never would have invited the Red Chinese in.
 As an old foreign correspondent, I submit there is no real sub-
 stitute for the personal experience of a foreign country.  Since policy-
 makers cannot possibly have lived in all foreign countries, the best
 they can do is call upon people who have.
 I furthermore submit that in the daily routine of the State Depart-
 ment., all too few officials have the opportunity and the quiet, to go
 away, let us say, and immerse themselves for 6 months-wherever,
 it doesn't matter-in the Communist conspiracy.
 They haven't the opportunity. Mr. Rusk gets to his office and I am
 presuming he finds a stack of reports on his desk.  By the time Mr.
 Rusk has done the stack he calls in the boys from here., there, and
 everywhere and he sends it around. This is no criticism.
 This is true of all foreign offices in the world.  They need a Freedom
 Academy on which they could draw, which would argue with them
 if they cared to have it.  There also ought to be, I would say, a part
 of the Freedom Academy consisting of some of the faculty who might
 be used, if the President or the State Department cared to, as con-
 sultants.  Their opinions would be asked in view of what they would
 learn, but that would have to be outside the Academy itself.
 In other words, Mr. Chairman, I am convinced that the situation
 is not as good as many of my colleagues and most of the officials either
 think or simply say that it is.
 To me the test of whether we are doing well in the war against
 communism is the map.  I remember when communism was restricted
 to Russia and doing very badly there.  It has now spread over a billion
 people with no end in sight.  I point out furthermore that, with the
 dubious exception of Guatemala which was not entirely Communist,
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For Re    g 1QQ5% /1A3 j       P&J1  JK?  000600072901-8
 in no case has the free world recovered from the Communists what they
 had previously taken from us.
 In other words, I believe President Kennedy said they go on the
 theory that "What is mine is mine, and whats yours will be mine,
 or is part mine."
 Even in Vietnam today when we discuss a compromise-a  com-
 promise today cannot be successful for one simple reason : The North
 Vietnamese are trying to communize South Vietnam; the South Viet-
 namese are not seriously trying, nor are we, to anticommunize North
 Vietnam. If both were doing this, then a compromise could be to let
 North Vietnam remain Communist but South Vietnam non-Commu-
 nist. But no, the whole talk is the compromise between us, who want
 only a free and independent and non-Communist Vietnam, and the
 Communists who want a Communist Vietnam.
 Mr. POOL. May I interrupt right at this point?  We had hearings
 last year, and we had one witness who came here and explained to us
 how the Communists work in Vietnam. They have a regional office,
 and their terror squads fan out from their regional office into these
 villages and terrorize the people.
 Mr. MOWRER. That is right.
 Mr. POOL. Americans have a responsibility not to engage in those
 practices. The Communists have no inhibitions against things like
 that. I would like to have your comment on what we are up against in
 formulating our tack in this field.
 Mr. MowRER. The two greatest experts in Washington on this, with
 whom I am personally acquainted, are Allen Dulles and General
 Edward Lansdale. I asked Allen Dulles once when we were sitting
 together at dinner why it was that the Communists were able to do in
 South Vietnam what we couldn't seem to do in North Vietnam., and
 he said, "The answer is quite simple : Terror."
 If we would resign ourselves to go into North Vietnam and murder
 all the people who didn't immediately offer to assist us, perhaps it
 would be counterbalanced, but I trust that we don't feel that we have
 to do anything of the kind.
 The other expert on this subject is, as I say, General Lansdale, U.S.
 Air Force, retired, and why is he an expert?  During the years in
 which the great Magsaysay, of whom I was proud to be a friend, in
 the Philippines was fighting the Communist Iluks he was assisted
 and helped in every way by Lansdale as, I believe, first a major and
 then a colonel.
 Lansdale and Magsaysay worked out the successful tactics, the
 hamlet tactics and so on, which eventually suppressed the Huks or
 reduced them to very small potatoes, though I hear they are coming
 up again now.
 Both of those people agreed that meeting this thing is a very special
 problem; that Mao really had something when he worked out this idea
 of using soldiers, disguised as civilians, and infiltrating them into the
 peasants as fish in water, and. so on. And, therefore, I would say that
 there are only two ways of dealing with this, and perhaps they should
 be combined, if we are determined we are going to have a free and
 independent South Vietnam.
 One is a further expansion of the Magsaysay-Lansdale tactics, which
 I believe the British used with great success in Malaysia.  The other

 would be what we are doing now, trying to make any further subver-
 sion from the outside, any supplying of the Viet Cong in South Viet-
 nam, just too painful to be contemplated.
 Mr. POOL.   Ire have no schools in our Government to teach these
 theories.  Is that correct?
 Mr. MownF.R. I don't. quite understand.
 Mr. PooL. We don't have courses in these tactics.
 IVIr. Moi mt. Insofar as it, is not a purely military problem, we
 should certainly make the Americans familiar with what. the Commu-
 nists do with the Mao Tse-tung tactics.  I was myself, as I say, in the
 Philippines awhile when this was going on.  Our people, for instance,
 continually report when, by mischance, one of our planes bombs some
 of our people or some innocent- villagers, and it is lamentable.  On
 the other hand, the fact. that the, Communists never go into a village
 for the first time without ruthlessly murdering any people they find
 who are not willing to go along with them is not. stressed.  It should
 be made clear what we are up against.
 Mr. SENNER. Mr. Chairman.  Mr. lfowrer, I am sorry, I wasn't
 hero to hear all of your testimony. I am very interested in the state-
 ments that you have made.
 However, as I understand history, the downfall of Hitler and of his
 attempted conquest of Russia came about because of the terror and the
 cruel treatment imposed by the German troops on the Russians. This
 also is supposedly true, by historians' statements, with regard to Napo-
 leon's invasion of Russia. What. I can't reconcile in my mind is how
 can the Viet Cong commit their terror and inhuman treatment. and
 still be able to win the support from the South Vietnamese.
 Mr. MowRER. Mr. Congressman, in my opinion as a fellow who has
 been writing on foreign affairs for 50 years, who has specialized a
 good deal on studying communism in various parts of the world, this
 is an example of how hard it. is for a man to understand Communist
 tactics unless he digs into them.  There are I can't tell you how many
 Communist schools throughout Russia and in China today where
 especially bright people are indoctrinated, are taught, how to move
 into a village of generally ignorant peasants with the carrot, with the
 great reform, the great, wonderful things that, are going to happen
 if you will only su ,port us against these horrible Fascists and
 American imperialists, and so on and so on.
 Look what they are doing today, as I read in the papers, on the
 American campuses.  There is apparently a small new flareup of
 interest. in communism as a viable philosophy among many hundreds
 and hundreds of students.  If these students can be induced by sly
 Communist propaganda or, if you like, for the slicer Bell of it-I don %
 know whicli-to agree that. this is a viable form and desirable form of
 philosophy, then it ought. to be easier with these peasants.
 At the same time they also set up immediately organizations which
 look after the peasants.  Let us mae no mistake about that.
 I would like to jump from Vietnam to Italy now because today, in
 my opinion, the most remarkable example of Communist influence in
 any country that is not under Communist rule is in Italy.  A few
 years ago I was sent abroad by the h'eader's Digest to try to figure out
 and write on how it was done, and I went into the matter very care-
 fully.

 I was 8 years a correspondent in Italy and speak the language and
 so does my wife, and we would go into Communist villages and, while
 I would talk with the mayor, and so on, she would go into the wives'
 houses and discuss this matter and kiss the babies and what not.
 They have set up the most elaborate, slick, and fallacious system of
 propaganda that I have ever known.  Everything is interpreted to
 mean something that it isn't.
 Secondly, in Italy the Communists have what I would call a super-
 Tamman~ political organization.  There are whole areas of Italy
 around I+ errara in the north-you know where it is-around Ferrara
 and Bologna, where the Communists dominate all the municipalities
 and they look after the boys and girls. Did you, by any chance, years
 ago read a very interesting book called The Little World of Don
 Camillo?  If not, it is amusing as well as enlightening reading.
 Mr. SENNER. Then I take your answer to be that where terror and
 brutality are utilized by the Communists to accomplish these objec-
 tives, their philosophy of also taking care of people apparently has
 given an added something that has been lacking in the Nazi and
 Fascist movements.  Is this correct?
 Mr. MOWRER. I think it is correct, if you stress the fact that they are
 training thousands and thousands of propagandists every year. Suz-
 anne Labin, that French anti-Communist writer, in her last book
 gives figures that she has painfully acquired on the billions that the
 two big Communist countries, plus the East European countries, are
 giving to training experts to delude people into believing that commu-
 nism is a free, wonderful, utopian society.  We have practiced what
 could be called honest propaganda for the great part.  The Voice of
 America, I believe, is continually in discussion with some Congress-
 man as to whether or not they should broadcast propaganda or the
 straight facts.
 The Communists have no scruples about that. I read their moni-
 tored broadcast reports which are sent out. They are very educational,
 and what do they teach me at least? That on the same day Radio Mos-
 cow and Radio Peiping and Czechoslovakia, and so on, will tell differ-
 ent stories to different countries-make the punishment fit the crime.
 This is a very powerful weapon and it is working. There are half a
 dozen countries on earth today where a Communist takeover could not
 be excluded, I am sorry to say, in my opinion.
 Now you will get back: "Is this business in Vietnam, and so on,
 worth a war, worth killing Americans?"
 And there you .get to the appreciation of what you think the Com-
 munists will do once they have taken it over.  If you agree with one
 of my colleagues writing in Newsweek that just because we lose South
 Vietnam doesn't mean we are going to lose anything else, then you will
 say, "Well, then, maybe it isn't worth the sacrifice. They aren't sup-
 porting us too well," all the known arguments.
 If you agree with me that it is impossible for militant communism
 to cease trying to expand without being Communist, then you would
 say the question is whether you make the stand for keeps here. More-
 over-I may shock some of you-I am totally convinced that sooner
 or later we will not only have to stop the leaks in containment-and
 it has been leaking steadily since it was proclaimed by my friend
 George Kennan in 1947 and is still leaking around in various spot,-,-

 we will not only have to make containment watertight, but we will
 have to go to the counteroffensives. It is necessary, if communism is to
 wither away, that it be unsuccessful.
 Nobod  ever deserts2 I believe, a political movement, even in the
 United States, when it is winning.  There is nothing like success.  We
 have not been successful.  Our successes have been holding a, line.
 Mr. SENNJER. In following Four colloquy here, and I know it is
 against your conscience and mine is there a ppossibilityy that we could
 use more terror and force, play the part of Big Brother and use the
 ingenuity and initiative of man to follow the capitalistic free enter-
 prise system?
 Mr. Ion-au;;. I would think that it, depends on the seriousness of the
 danger.  Nobody deplored more than I did the bombing of open Ger-
 man cities during 1r%orld War 11 because, having been in Germany, I
 knew that there were lots of anti-Nazis there who were friends of ours,
 or who would liked to have been, and whom we were killing ruthlessly.
 And if you saw Germany just. after the war, you must admit that, to-
 gether with the British, we did a job. I went back to Berlin, a town
 where I had spent 10 years, and wandered around in it daze. I didn't
 know where I was. It was gone.
 Now relay did we have to do that?  Because tlae Germans started
 this.  'Phey did it first. to Warsaw.  Then they did it to Coventry.
 They broke the Dutch morale in 5 days in 1940, largely by bombing-
 tlae snuffing out, of Itotterdam.  If the thing gets serious enough, if the
 Chinese come into this, I would have no reluctance whatever to using
 what countermeasures the general staff decides are necessary.
 would do it with a sinking heart, but a feeling that it has to be done.
 I frequently argue with those: people who tell me, "Rh, ah, but we
 must not use the same things."  I ask them, "Did you approve or
 disapprove of our counterbombardnient of German cities?"  "Ali,"
 the say, "that was different. Hitler was a danger."
 Communism is something like that, and there we conic to the root of
 it and back to the. Freedom Academy.  I believe the Vni(ed States
 is in a bigger danger than we were on the night of Pearl Harbor. It
 is not the same danger.  The night, of Pearl Harbor I spent a sleepless
 night, like many of us who had been worrying over this thing, and
 about dawn turned over and went off with the feeling that we could
 beat the Japs.
 Mr. SENNER. Xfr. Mowrer, this is a graver danger, a greater danger,
 which we face than was Pearl IIa rbor.
 Mr. MowRnu. We are fighting back, but wwe are not fighting back
 effectively against communism because Ave are running what they call
 a carrot-and-stick policy and what I call schizophrenia, a divided men-
 tal approach to things-it. is a question how long we can go on snug-
 gling up to Moscow, offering cooperation in important places like outer
 space to Moscow, and at the same time oppose. Moscow successfully.
 A totalitarian government can do that because its friendship is un-
 real, but Americans are friendly people and when we are friends with
 Moscow it is very difficult. to tell them we don't really believe it.
 We are just trying, just. a hoj~ e.  That, is 'wily, in my opinion, the
 country is not facing up to the Communist menace and'why I believe
 that a Freedom Academy would be helpful in (lie matter.

 The CHAIRMAN. In that connection, last year a State Department
 witness in opposition to the adoption of this bill stressed the danger of
 indoctrination.  That word was used by him throughout his testi-
 mony.
 In other words, the use of this Freedom Academy would result in,
 or would aid or abet or lead to, indoctrination, and that was the theme
 of opposition last year from the witness of the State Department.
 Would you care to comment on that?  Then I will tell you about
 what they say this year.
 Mr. MowRER. Don't you think there has to be an element of indoc-
 trination to maintain any sort of civilization?  Don't children have to
 be taught that stealing and murder and rape are wrong?  That is
 indoctrination, Mr. Congressman.  I have no hesitancy in indoctrin-
 ating any American with the fact that a free society is superior to a
 totalitarian or slave society.
 If they are afraid of that kind of indoctrination, I should feel very
 bad about it indeed.
 The CHAIRMAN. This year, since this is a new Congress and new
 bills had to be introduced, we did the usual and asked for a fresh
 expression of views on the part of the State Department. We have
 the letter here.  It has been offered in evidence, but if you don't
 mind I would point out the points they make and get your views
 on three or four points for the record.
 Here is what they say this year. They say :
 Expertise and operational experience are as important in the formulation of
 policy as they are in its execution.  For this reason, the Department seriously
 questions whether comprehensive and realistic plans for dealing with the in-
 finitely complex problems of U.S. Foreign Affairs, can be developed by a new,
 separate government agency, especially one without operational responsibilities.
 If you find that passage I wish you would comment upon it from
 the copy of the letter you have before you.
 Mr. MowRER. What would you like me to comment on?
 The CHAIRMAN. On that particular paragraph that is before you
 there, that "expertise and operational experience."
 Mr. MowRER. It is not for an old foreign correspondent to say that
 experience and expertise are not necessary in the formulation of
 policy. Of course they pare; and, as I say, if all our leading citizens
 could have had some experience, then there might be no need to do
 this.
 If they would all go and live a year in Russia or live a year in Red
 China, they would not have to do this. It seems to me, as I say, this
 would be a backing and not a rival to what the State Department
 is doing and to our diplomatic schools and so on, for the schools,
 the diplomatic academies, teach diplomacyas such. They cannot give
 in 6 months-I have forgotten how many months. Does anybody know
 how long these young men study in these special schools before they
 enter our Foreign Service? I think it is less than a year; some months.
 It is impossible to understand the various systems all over the
 world in this time. Now, he says he-
 questions whether comprehensive and realistic plans for dealing with the in-
 finitely complex problems of U.S. Foreign Affairs can be developed by a new,
 separate government agency, especially one without operational responsibilities.

 The CHAIRMAN. That is the point. They seem to say that without
 day-to-day operational responsibilities the Freedom Academy couldn't
 be of a great help.
 Mr. MowREii. has anybody p~ropposed, as I say, that a Freedom
 Academy, its president. or its facult , should attempt the formula-
 tion of Policy or the execution of policy?
 The CHAIRMAN. But they say that. without day-to-day operational
 responsibilities, which the Academy would not have, the Academy
 cannot perform a useful function.  That is the point.  I disagree
 with that.
 11Ir. Mowmm. If flint were true, then we could never have an army
 because the President decides the policy that the United States is
 at war, but, except. in a special case where a move might be strongly
 political, he is better off to leave the conduct of the war itself to the
 Joint Chiefs. The Joint. Chiefs are told what the aim of the Govern-
 ment is and are told, "IIere. you are.  Go and do it the best way."
 It wouldn't occur to me, as one who has worked in I can't tell
 you how many foreign countries.. who believes the professional diplo-
 niats are almost. always better than amateur diplomats, to say that
 operationally the Freedom Academy should have anything to say
 at, all, but it. should be able to furnish a body of opinion, studies, and
 have people throughout the other branches of the Government as
 students.
 Today they complain that so many different branches of the Gov-
 ernment are getting into foreign political problems.  I believe there
 is a bill before the Senate now that has something to do with foreign
 aid, but this is Iargely not a technical problem, whether or not we
 give foreign aid.  It. is a political problem,  This is not exactly com-
 parable, but this is something which a Freedom Academy could help on.
 For instance, are we giving foreign aid as a weapon in the cold
 war-we are certainly giving military aid or are we giving it as
 pure charity, or are we giving it in a half-and-half way, believing that
 raising standards will necessarily help us since-what. is it?-a fat
 Communist is less dangerous than a lean Communist?  I think, if I
 may say so in this particular case without seeming critical, that we
 cannot. forget too soon that the State Department has lavished for-
 eign aid upon a man called Nasser of the I. nited Arab Republic, upon
 another one called Sukarno, that we. gave a great deal of help to the
 Poles, hoping that they would break away and form another Tito.
 None of these has come about,  There is being created throughout
 Africa and Asia it number of regimes with a part tally tribal existence,
 ono-party states, that. are almost indistinguishable from Nazi Fascist
 philosophy.  They are totalitarian.
 Certainly one of the things we need is not just comment from
 friendly liberal professors who say, "Well, it doesn't matter whether
 Ghana has any democracy or not.  They will."
 Well, will they?  There is no evidence that they will unless you
 are talking in terms of decades, centuries, and so on.
 Therefore, I would certainly stay that it should be set, up in the bill
 and in the Freedom Academy that I would like to sec you create
 that we should not make policy or attempt. tsp.
 The CHAIRMAN. They make the point. in this letter that. the Free-
 dom Commission bills propose that the executive branch on a large
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For Rel  g?1g   /q1  : ]q&SWQ 4fM00600070@P1-8
 scale undertake the mobilization of private citizens, domestic and
 foreign, to fight the cold war and also the systematic orientation
 of our citizens against communism.
 Then the letter makes this statement :
 While it is very useful in certain circumstances to train private U.S. citizens
 and foreign nationals, our primary need-and hence our first priority-is to
 improve in all possible ways the training of government personnel involved in
 the day-to-day operation of our foreign affairs.
 So they say that while it might be all right in certain circumstances
 to give private citizens and foreign nationals thorough grounding in
 communism, the great need is the training of Government personnel
 involved in foreign affairs operations. The State Department doesn't
 seem very enthusiastic about having anyone train except Government
 personnel. What are your comments on that statement
 Mr. MOWRER. Yes.  I think in the first place that most bureau-
 crats, if you will pardon the expression, would consider it very nice
 if the citizens would take their word for most things without con-
 troversy.                              I do not think that that is compatible with our system of
 Government, nor do I think that you can win a cold war without the
 support of an overwhelming majority of our citizens, and that sup-
 port should not be merely passive, "papa knows best," but it should be
 an active support.
 The cold war is in my opinion a real war and, as I said before, could
 be more dangerous than a fighting war, because in a fighting war you
 have to stand up and live or die, but the cold war can go by default,
 can go by little concessions; therefore, the more need for having en-
 lightenea citizens with the right that Americans maintain for them-
 selves, and I hope forever will, criticize any policy they don't like, to
 suggest alternative policies in any field.
 Believe me, as one who has written, as I say, for 50 years on this
 and spent more than 27 years abroad in various countries, the belief
 that the diplomat abroad knows more about the country than the
 foreign correspondent is great error.  In most countries I would rather
 go to the foreign correspondents to find out what is going on than I
 would to the U.S. diplomats, for the correspondents are not handi-
 capped in getting around- by protocol and all the people they must
 talk to and all that kind of thing.
 In the second place, as I tried to point out, we have repeatedly been
 wrong through too much reliance upon day-to-day operators who are
 not in the position to learn what is necessary to make these decisions.
 The State Department recognizes this.  They not only have opera-
 tives and embassies and everything, but they have a planning bureau.
 I was delighted when they brought in a planning bureau, but the
 Freedom Academy is not supposed to do that in my opinion.
 (At this point Mr. Senner left the hearing room.)
 Mr. Congressman, it comes down to this. President Johnson has
 asked for a consensus. I hope he gets it, but does he want a consensus of
 sheep, or does he want a consensus of convinced people who have had
 access to the facts and who have thought out the conclusions and agree
 with him?
 The Freedom Academy would help provide the kind of people
 enlightened in foreign affairs.  May I say one thing more?  Having
 specialized most of my life on foreign affairs I am still appalled by the

 i proved Forifthmm 26(15I07Aftz) A-R  D)446R000600070001-8

 indifference and apathy throughout the great American people to
 foreign issues except when they rise to the level of a crisis, when there
 is nothing to do but fight or die.
 We cannot maintain our position in the current world until enough
 Americans get the understanding of foreign political issues, get the
 same understanding of conflicting policies and regimes that they bring
 to domestic affairs.
 All of you, as elected people, realize that you must never count on the
 stupidity or ignorance of your opponents in local matters, that they
 are pretty smart cookies and they know pretty well what is going on
 in Pikesvillo or Pittsburgh. We have to create enough people who will
 know and follow moves.
 I play chess. I am not a chess champion, but I follow clhampionshi
 chess games with some understanding and great enthusiasm, because
 have played enough to understand the moves and see what it. is all about.
 We have to create a knowing public.
 One last word, if you can let me have it. As I understand from read-
 ing Mr. Possony's testimony, in which I thought he outlined extremely
 well most of the things which the Freedom Academy should do and
 there is no need for me to repeat this, the Freedom Academy would also
 invite Government officials from other branches which have had no op-
 portunity to learn about these things, financial people, for example, for
 our financial and our political problems are tied up so closely in this
 that nobody can tear them apart.
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you visualize the possibility, and maybe the de-
 sirability, too, that perhaps administrative assistants of Members of
 Congress could attend this institute!
 Mr. Mowiirii. Mr. Congressman, if I were an elected representative
 of the American people who had spent my life in domestic affairs and
 was told that I could spend 3 months when Congress was perhaps not
 in session by attending lectures on certain subjects in a Freedom Aca-
 demy, I certainly would do it right off.
 The CHAIRMAN. Finally, the State Department makes this point.
 It says that the bills raise the problem of Federal control inasmuch as
 they authorize the Freedom Commission to prepare, make, and pub-
 lish textbooks, training films, and other materials for high school, col-
 lege, and community level instructions, and to distribute this material,
 and so on. Then they say :
 The Department doubts the value of any effort to centralize and standardize
 the dissemination of information in such areas.  This would appear to be a
 marked departure from the traditional role of the Federal Government in the
 field of political education.
 I would like you to comment on that. They are touching a sensitive
 Amerien concept.--of the Federal Government not controlling schools
 and colleges, and so on, that we all agree with, but then they use this
 argument ino position to this institute. Do you see any validity to that
 objection on their art?
 Mr. Mowrmn. Do you think that the opposition is based on the fact
 that this would be in any way a Government institution?
 The CHAIRMAN. They raise the issue that, since the institute could
 publish books and so on, the dissemination of that information to
 the citizenry would indoctrinate or would lead to Federal control of

 teaching, inasmuch as these publications would find their way into
 colleges and high schools.
 Mr. MowRER. Point of order. May I ask a question?
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes.
 Mr. MowRER. Is it not true that the Federal Government supports
 Howard University?
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes; through the Department of Health, Educa-
 tion, and Welfare.
 Mr. MowRER. Certainly. I think the greater part of the money is
 given by the Federal Government.  Yet, so far as I know-and I
 have a friend who is a professor there-the Government has never
 attempted to tell Howard University what it was to do, nor has it
 said that the publications by professors in Howard University were
 documents of the U.S. Government, or let me give you a better one
 perhaps
 The CHAIRMAN. They may draw a distinction between Howard
 University and a congressionally created Commission.
 Mr. MowRER. If the Government is not in education in Howard Uni-
 versity, it need not be in education in the Freedom Academy. Let
 e give you another example which is manifest. Surely, politically
 Me British are a broadly democratic people and they certainly shoot
 off their mouth with the greatest freedom about the government and
 everything else.
 Yet the BBC, though entirely supported by government money,
 is absolutely independent of government pressures. In fact, the di-
 rector of the BBC is now in dutch with several of the leading poli-
 ticians for allowing certain people to make statements, and he has
 made it perfectly clear to the government that this was the basis on
 which the BBC was set up and once they entrusted him with running
 it he was groing to run it.
 There is a problem, of course, that there could be an encroachment
 over there, but there can be an encroachment by any government over
 anything else. Some people think there is too much encroachment
 in the United States today and some think not enough.
 The CHAIRMAN. Do you think the answer might be in the quality
 of the personnel who run this institution?
 Mr. MOWRER. I would think that a study of the organization and
 independence of the BBC would be fruitful in this matter. Since I
 haven't got the full details I don't want to say any more, but I do not
 think that this need encroach in the slightest on freedom of education.
 The CHAIRMAN. Or lead to Federal control?
 Mr. MowRER. Certainly not. Here we spoke of indoctrination. All
 my life I have been considered more or less of a maverick who has
 sometimes gotten himself into trouble by shooting off his mouth too
 soon where lie shouldn't, and therefore I would be the last person
 to say that at the Freedom Academy they should inculcate, indoctri-
 nate, teach a single attitude toward communism or anything else.
 For instance, I don't object to having Communists lecture at our
 universities, provided they are labeled Communists land it is perfectly
 clear that they represent the Soviet Union or China or the Trotskyites
 or the monkey businesses instead of representing the United States,
 for I reiterate that it is impossible to be a good Communist and an
 American patriot at the same time.

 Mr. Icilolanm Mr. Chairman.
 The CiiainM:AN. Yes.
 Mr. Iciioian. The bells have sounded over in the House for a quorum
 call and I have to leave but I want to take this opportunity to thank
 you, sir, for appearing 'iefore the committee.  I think you have made
 an outstanding statement. and you have made very many genet. iting
 comments upon the problems confronting our country in this field, and
 you made an excellent witness.
 I do want. to thank you very much for your appe a-rance.  Since
 you are here--you obviously have a profound knowledge of our prob-
 ms in the cold war- I would like you to comment, if you will, upon
 the so-called Chinese-Soviet split.  I would like to have your analysis
 of the split..
 Mr. klownim. This is my personal view ?
 Mr. Iciioan.. Yes.
 Mr. Mowiuxu. I think that it is a mixture, of the theological disputes
 of the Middle Ages and the power disputes of national states of all
 times and the personal rivalries of people who, the higher they get, the
 touchier they become.
 I think it is all combined. I do not. think it is fraud because, in my
 own estimate, it. started not where some of the people say, but when
 the Soviet. Union stopped helping Red China make nuclear weapons--
 I believe the date wits 1958-and when the Chinese got nasty about
 it they withdrew all the Soviet technicians from all over.  Stalin
 was not a man to'tolerate a rival. in fact, to one who vas in Moscow
 in 1936 when Stalin was busy liquidating all the former Communists,
 including his own closest buddies, it. was perfectly obvious that there
 was no place not. only in the Communist world, but in Russia itself,
 for anybody but. the great. Stalin.
 Mao considers that lie, practically alone among Communist people,
 though helped by wartime conditions, managed to establish an inde-
 pendent Communist. country, and he more or less deferred to Stalin.
 I I do not. consider, however-I awn almost convinced-t.liat the split
 will ever go to an open break, at least under present circumstances,
 and I will tell you why.
 In 1937 and 1938 when I was in an open-and-closed conspiracy
 against Adolf Hitler, I found an ally in the British Foreign Office, Sir
 Robert Van Sittaart., the permanent Secretary General, who was doing
 his level best to convince the conservative government that. Hitler
 meant business. He never succeeded. But. era became very close, allies
 so much so that. lie used to let me see the British reports so I could
 write better stuff about what. was going on in Germany, where I
 couldn't go, but we always differed on one point..
 Van . itt.art said, "Mussolini and the, Italians don't like the Ger-
 mans. We can divide the Italians from tlie. Germans."
 And, in my opinion, it was not so much Sir Samuel Hoare, but the
 advice that Sir Samuel got from his first assistant, Sir Robert. Van
 Sittart, that brought the so-called Hoare-Laval plan to settle the trou-
 ble in Ethiopia by a compromise, the British hoping somehow or other,
 by making these compromises that they would induce the Italians
 not to form what became the home-Berlin Axis or, even when it was
 formed, to break it.,

 Approved For RelggVli5JW/13 iIbbWF?Q000600073901-8
 I always argued against this, largely on the basis of personal know-
 ledge of both Hitler and Mussolini, but also on the following thesis.
 Hitler was determined to create the great new Third Reich, 400
 million strong, by absorbing East Europe and the Russian Ukraine.
 Mussolini was determined to create the Empero Romano, the new
 Roman Empire, stretching God-knows-where, around the Mediterra-
 nean. Both of them had based their whole political life on the realiza-
 tion of these things. Hitler's only justification for being there was to
 create this monstrously great new German state.
 Mussolini's only justification was that his rivals were pacifists, they
 didn't realize it took Roman grandeur, and so on. He had to make a
 new Empero Romano.  It would seem to me perfectly obvious that
 neither one could succeed without the help, or a ainst the opposition,
 of the other, and therefore I predicted to Van Sittart regularly that
 they would not come apart until perhaps they had taken all they
 wanted and it came to dividing the swags. Then, of course, there is
 opportunity for any amount of disputes.
 At the present time, the Soviet actions, as distinct from the Soviet
 talk, show a determination to spread communism by subversion and
 propaganda wherever possible. I don't have to tell you people that
 there are a dozen countries where there has been found evidence, of
 direct Soviet help, Cuba and the rest of them.
 The Chinese are determined to spread communism throughout
 Asia, preferably ahead of the Soviets and so on, but neither one of
 them can succeed if the other one drifts apart or opposes it.
 Therefore, just like two second-storymen engaged in a little job,
 they may quarrel while they are on the ladder, but they are not going
 to fight each other or come apart, and this is to me so simple that I
 would think even sophisticated diplomats could understand it.

 Chairman, Committcc on Un-American Activities.

 Mr. Gurney, we are very pleased to have you with tis today.
 STATEMENT OF RON. EDWARD I. GURNEY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM FLORIDA
 Mr. Guxxim Mr. Chairman, I certainly welcome the opportunity to
 appear before the committee on behalf of this bill. First of all, let me
 say that my role here really is to indicate my full-fledged support of
 thisbill rather than to edify the committee about the bill or its contents
 or the problem it seeks to meet.
 I say this because I ant well aware of the fact that extensive hearings
 have been held by this committee in prior years and that you, Mr.
 Chairman, and other members who have sat on the committee in the
 past probably know more about. the, bill and its problem than do I,
 because this is one of the special areas before this coninittee--this
 great problem of fighting communism.
 Then, too, of course, the bill has had extensive hearings before
 appropriate Senate committees.
 I do have a little special interest. in this legislation which is a bit
 different from other Members of Congress.  Air. Alan Grant, who
 hatched the idea of the Freedom Academy, is a constituent of mine.
 He is it lawyer in Orlando, Florida, the city next to where I live. I
 have known him ever since I have been in Florida and, as a matter of
 fact., was a member of his initial group way back in 1950 that- under-
 took to begin some courses of instruct-ion on a voluntary basis on com-
 munism in the local high school in Orlando, so I do have a personal
 interest in this legislation.
 Actually the idea, as you know, was born well over a decade and a
 half ago and was proposed by Mr. Grant- to the executive branch of the
 Government as early as 1954. It met with some favorable reception at
 that tinie, and other unfavorable reception, and it was never pushed
 too hard in those years by the executive department-.  Later on, of
 course, it was introduced in the form of authorizing legislation in the
 House and the Senate in 1959.
 Hearings were held in that year and the year after, and in 1960 a
 Freedom Academy bill actually did pass the Senate overwhelmingly,
 but was not acted upon b T the house.
 I think it is worthwhile to note here that the Senate committee in
 reporting out. the bill made this comment-: "The committee considers
 this bill to be one of the most important. ever introduced in the Con-
 gress," and then amplified that feeling in their report.
 Leading Members of Congress have not only introduced the bill
 both in the House and the Senate, but have supported it, and so have
 other leading figures in this Nation, both in ('government and out of

 Government. Many magazine articles and editorials have been written
 in the leading news media in the country supporting the bill, so it
 isn't a new idea.
 It is considered by a great many people in the Nation, and leading
 figures, as a very sound idea.
 Without, as I say, trying to go into the ramifications of the bill,
 which I know you are aware of-and the committee hearings in the
 past are replete with arguments pro and con-I would like to express
 my feeling here in favor of the bill in this perhaps, overall large sense :
 That I feel, as well as other Members of Congress, that in the eternal
 struggle of the so-called cold war between this Nation and the free
 world and the opposing Communist forces, we are steadily on the
 losing side.
 We make some gains and advances; we score some victories.  But
 it seems to me, overall, that perhaps communism is defeating us in
 this struggle between our way of life and theirs and that while we
 have some weapons that we have used in this fight, such as foreign aid
 and, let's say, the Peace Corps, and while these weapons have been
 partially effective, nonetheless, they have not been a complete or a
 successful weapon in this struggle, in this cold war.
 We need new weapons to successfully win this war with communism.
 While we have magnificent weapons in the military field and superb
 Armed Forces-certainly we exceed the Communist ability there-I
 think on almost every front in the realm of ideas, and that is really
 what we are talking about here in this cold war, we have not used the
 potential that I think this Nation possesses.
 This idea of the Freedom Academy is this : It is to develop a weapon
 in the idea field in order to fight more successfully this cold war.  The
 Communists, of course, have used ideas very successfully for years.
 Certainly in any struggle of this sort, which has perhaps a potential
 for hot war in the future, and right now we are engaged in the war
 in Vietnam in this struggle, it is far better to resolve the struggle and
 the outcome, if possible, by ideas than it is by bullets.
 Perhaps one of the best illustrations in this field which took place
 many years ago in history is the old story of the Trojan horse.  In-
 stead of storming the walls of the city, the Trojans built this horse
 and put themselves inside and got the thing wheeled in the city and
 took the city in this fashion.
 Essentially, this is what we are talking about here. We need to
 develop new ideas so that we can fare more successfully in this battle
 against communism, and the Freedom Academy is a new kind of
 weapon.
 As you know, Mr. Chairman, what the bill does, of course, is estab-
 lish an Academy, a school, where people are specially trained in the
 background and the history of communism and would be taught
 methods of fighting this psychological war. The bill would establish
 a school that would be a research center so that we would have a
 resource in the Nation which would gather material on this whole sub-
 ject of communism and this cold war.  Certainly it would serve as a
 receptacle like a library for collecting all manner of material on this
 subject.
 We have academies for other things. We have service academies to
 train our young men to take their places in the various branches of the

 40              PROVIDING FOR A FREEDOM COMMISSION
 armed services. We have many other academies in this country for
 all kinds of things, which train people specially for one walk of life or
 another walk of life, and essentially this is all we are talking about
 here, the establishment of a school to cope with this very special area
 of fighting the cold war.
 I have read the hearings held before this committee and the Senate
 committee, and the hearings point up the fact that we do not have this
 kind of a resource in the Nation today, and this is another reason why
 I think we need this desperately.
 So I say, in summing up, that this Nation ought not to be afraid of
 establishing a Freedom Academy, of passing this legislation to probe
 this new idea of fighting the cold war which we are ever waging
 against communism. And I think if we do this we will have a new
 resource and a weapon in the cold war struggle against communism.
 I would like permission to file a further formal statement with the
 committee, Mr. Chairman.
 .l
 Mr. Iciioiw. Without objection that permission will be granted
 Mr. Gurney, did you introduce a bill dealing with the subject during
 the last session of Congress?
 Mr. GURNEY. I think I did.
 Mr. Iciioiw. For the record, is your bill identical with 13.R. 2379,
 introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Boggs?
 Mr. GURNEY. I was talking to Congressman Clawson about. this
 earlier.  Actually, Mr. Chairman, I have not compared my bill with
 others and I can't answer your question.                        .
 Mr. IcHoi m. I presume that you did have discussions with Mr.
 Grant on the bill ?
 Mr. GURNEY. Yes.
 Mr. Iciiorm. And yours is probably the latest version as proposed
 by Mr. Grant's committee Iand the latest version was incorporated in
 .Ifs.  Thank you very much, Mr. Gur-
 H.R. 2379 introduced by Itr. Bog
 neyy. We appreciate your contribution to the work of the committee.
 Mr. Clawson, any questions?
 Mr. CLAwsox. I would just, like to ask one.
 From my superficial knowledge of these bills to establish a Free-
 dom Academy I have this question : Do you envision the program
 to be also a counterespionage activity in Communist countries?
 Mr. GURNEY. I am sorry?
 Mr. CLAWSON. Communist subversion rather than espionage, per-
 haps try to convert. Communists to our side?
 M. GURNEY. I think the main purpose of the bill, Mr. Clawson, is
 actually to develop a school to research in this whole area of com-
 munism-what it means, its background, its history, its objectives, its
 methods of fighting--so that we would have a school with library
 resources and faculty resources which would contain as much informa-
 tion as possible on this subject in this Nation.
 That would be one purpose, so that we conduct effective research
 in this area.. The other purpose would be schooling and training stu-
 dents in the school. These students would come from Government
 certainly, and all levels of Government.. They also would come from
 the private sector of the ITnited States because we need people in our

 schools and from other walks of life who understand more about
 communism, and they need a place to go to find out about it.
 These are the two main reasons for the bill and for the legislation
 and for the school. It really isn't so much an operational part of the
 Government as it is a teaching part of the Government.
 As far as the operational part is concerned, I think that appropri-
 ately lies either in the Armed Forces or the State Department or the
 CIA or some branch of Government like that.
 Interestingly enough and I was amazed to discover this as I read
 the testimony that has teen taken in previous years, there is an amaz-
 ing lack of knowledge in this country not only about communism, but
 there is no central place to get information about communism.
 For example, in Florida in recent years our legislature enacted a
 law which required instruction about communism in our public
 schools, and our teachers were hard pressed to find a place to go to
 prepare themselves to teach this subject.  There is very interesting
 testimony-I can't remember whether it was before this committee or
 before the Senate committee either last year or the year before by
 one of the teachers in Florida, who obviously was a very intelligent,
 capable, dedicated teacher, who deplored the fact that he had no place
 to turn to, to find adequate source material to teach this subject.
 It is amazing in a country with the educational resources that we
 have. There is another interesting bit of testimony along these same
 lines that came out-I think it was last year again-where a South
 American student in this country, obviously very concerned about the
 advance of communism in his own country, wanted to find a place
 where he could go to learn specially about communism, its background,
 its methods, its objectives, so that he, in turn, could go home and carry
 the message to his country.
 He couldn't find any place to go.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. I have heard statements about what we are going
 to use this acquired knowledge for and what the purpose is going to
 be.  How do you think this is going to be used and under what
 circumstances and conditions is it going to be used?
 Mr. GuiiNEY. I would say this would be true, in direct answer to
 your question : That the knowledge acquired will be used to under-
 stand better and to fight more effectively the Communist threat to this
 Nation and the free world.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. Thank you.
 Mr. Ionoiin. Thank you very much, Mr. Gurney.
 Mr. GuiiNilY. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD J. GURNEY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM FLORIDA
 The idea for a Freedom Academy to combat cold war communism is a decade
 and a half old.
 This committee is well aware of the exhaustive work done by Alan Grant, Jr.,
 of Orlando, Fla., who over these past 15 years has done more to promote this, idea
 than any single American.
 It was Mr. Grant who started this work with a small group known as the
 Orlando Committee for a Freedom Academy. It was Mr. Grant who first caught
 the attention of the executive branch of Government with his idea in 1954.

 I am personally acquainted with Mr. Grant. In fact, I was a part. Of his
 group who lectured on communism in the Orlando High School a decade and
 a half ago.
 Since that time, Wore than a dozen bills to create this Academy to combat
 cold war communism have been extensively debated, yet none has ever passed
 both Houses of Congress in the same session.
 Sponsors of these bills have included Republicans and Democrats whose po-
 litical philosophy range over the entire political spectrum.
 These include, over the years, Senators Case, Dodd, Douglas, Fong, Gold-
 water, Hickenlooper, Keating, Lausche, Miller, Mundt, Proxmire, Scott, Smathers,
 and so on.
 In the House they have Included, besides myself, Congressman Herlong of
 my own State of Florida, Congressman Ichord of this committee, Congressmen
 Boggs, Gubser, Judd, Scbweiker, and Taft.
 Private support has conic from numerous outstanding citizens.  To name
 just two who have appeared before this committee: Dr. Stefan T. Possony,
 director of International Political Studies at the Hoover Institution in Stanford,
 Calif., and Dr, William Kintner, professor of political science at the University
 of Pennsylvania.
 The first legislation on this subject was Introduced in Congress in 191.9.  In
 19G0, the Senate passed a similar bill overwhelmingly, but the legislation never
 got out of committee on this side.
 The report of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, adopted by the
 full Senate Judiciary Committee said, in part:
 "The committee considers this hill to be one of the most Important ever intro-
 duced in the Congress. *  *  * "
 The major objective sought by this bill Is to establish a research and training
 institution to cope with the threat of cold war communism.
 The research arm would include a complete library, indexing publications on
 communism and Its history.
 To impart this knowledge we would gather all the top talent available, our
 top brainpower on communism and the motives driving it.
 We would train our Government personnel, our private citizens, and foreign
 students.
 This Idea for a Freedom Academy has received favorable comment from the
 news media.  There have been scores of editorials written over the years urging
 this "new weapon for democracy," as It was labeled by Reader's Digest.
 The reasons we desperately need this Freedom Academy are many.
 First and foremost, we are losing the cold war with the Communists,
 We fight communism on some fronts, already.  We have a foreign aid program
 which is supposed to at least check the spread of communism, if not actually
 roll back the borders.  We have the Peace Coals working for us, too.  But
 these are not enough.
 We need to roll out new weapons.  Fight fire with fire.
 In the armament field, we think nothing of spending millions of dollars on
 an experimental. weapon which may be obsolete before It gets off the drawing
 board.
 We have superb missiles, planes, tanks, guns, and soldiers.  We have the best
 economy in the world.
 But the Communists have a huge arsenal of weapons. They have something,
 else to employ. They use ideas, propaganda, to sway millions to their side. Their
 emphasis on this aspect of the cold war is probably even greater than their stress
 on their armed forces.
 In this century, our Communist adversaries have made a science of revolution-
 ary strategy. They have learned the rules of penetration thoroughly. They have
 marched ahead In their ambitions, but not without meticulous care and precision.
 Our way of life Is being severely tested by communism and Its cancerous
 tentacles.
 As Dr. Possony has so ably stated, both political parties have been guilty of
 negligence in meeting the Communist threat; both parties have given lipservice
 to this menace during election time, but little more.
 How do we go about closing the "propaganda gap" which has been widening to
 our disadvantage?
 I strongly feel the Freedom Academy concept is the vehicle to launch our efforts
 in this field.

 As has been brought out in previous testimony and outlinedbriefiy here today,
 we are doing something in this field, but it is far too little and too fragmented.
 The Freedom Academy, a research and training institution, would erase the
 disjointed efforts in this field and replace them with a cohesive unit, capable of
 providing in-depth courses about communism.
 Objections to this Freedom Academy have been voiced, principally by the State
 Department.  For that matter, the Government has come up with its own proposal
 to establish a National Academy of Foreign Affairs.
 But this would only serve to compound the problem, not solve it. The mere
 fact the executive branch has recognized a need here and has proposed its own
 academy bears out the urgency of the situation.
 But it seems quite likely the State Department is afraid some of its jurisdiction
 will be usurped by the Freedom Academy. This is not the case at all. The State
 Department already has existing training programs for its personnel, and I'm
 afraid an Academy of Foreign Affairs would serve only as an extension of these
 schools.  That will not meet the problem we are facing.  In fact, that is an en-
 tirely different problem.  The Freedom Academy would not deal with foreign
 policy, which is State's responsibility, but would be for the sole purpose of under-
 standing Communist cold war tactics and techniques, through its classes and
 instructors supported by its library.
 We cannot fail to try this Freedom Academy Idea.  If the executive branch
 doesn't want it, we should make it an arm of Congress.  We must make a start
 in this field, or the Communists are going to continue beating us, and beating us
 badly.
 The Freedom Academy, an information center or university to train our able,
 talented young people, can be the first step in the right direction.
 In closing, let me give the following as an example if I may.
 We could take a lesson from Mao Tse-tung, the Red Chinese ruler.  He has
 written the "bible" used in guerrilla warfare. We should study and respect his
 writings-this man who was successfully fighting Chiang Kai-shek in the jungles
 40 years ago-at least respect his writings on tactics to be used, not his principles
 or his ideology.
 We must comprehend his teachings and apply his techniques-fight fire with
 fire, where possible.  If we don't we're lost.  We may as well roll over and play
 dead.
 Our dilemma is somewhat akin to that facing the bullfrog, as the story goes.
 If thrown into a cauldron of scalding water, he would quickly leap out, thus
 saving his life. However, when placed in a pail of tepid water which was slowly
 heated to the boiling point, the bullfrog perished.
 Khrushchev said, "We will bury you."  Unless we wake up soon, that won't be
 necessary.  We'll bury ourselves in our own complacency.
 Unless we get started, the new Kremlin bosses can update Khrushchev's state-
 ment to read, "We will not bury you.  You will do it for us."
 Our very survival as a free nation may well depend on what this, committee
 does in coping with the global threat of communism.
 Mr. ICHORD. The committee is honored to have with it this morning
 a distinguished Member of the other body, Senator Karl Mundt of
 South Dakota.  Senator Mundt, it is a great. pleasure to have you
 with us today, sir.  I might state for the record that Senator Mundt
 is a sponsor of Senate bill 1232, a Freedom Academy bill presently
 pending in the other body.
 (At this point, Mr. Clawson left the hearing room.)
 Mr. ICHORD. Senator Mundt for several years has been a leading ex-
 ponent of the Freedom Academy concept, being one of the sponsors
 of Senate 1869, the first Freedom Academy bill that was introduced
 in the Senate on April 15, 1959, and I believe passed the body in 1960.
 It is a great pleasure to have you as a witness, Senator Mundt.

 STATEMENT OF HON. KARL E. MUNDT, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH
 DAKOTA
 SENATOR Mt1NDT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  It is a
 pleasure to be here. I come to you as an alumnus of this committee,
 where I spent almost 10 happy years, dating back to its original chair-
 man, Martin Dies of Texas, and served through the hectic early days
 of the committee's career, and I am glad to come back.
 You have developed swankier quarters than we had up on the fifth
 floor of the Old Ilouse Office Building when I used to be here, and
 I suspect. that the erudition of the committee has advanced as its sur-
 roundings have improved.  But in all events, I am delighted to be here
 for several reasons, and I am Kapp to be here immediately following
 Congressman Gurney, of Florida, because I come to talk to you about
 a concept which I believe had its inception in Florida in the first
 instance.
 As a matter of fact, I first became familiar with the challenge pro-
 vided in this legislation by stud ring the legislation introduced by
 Congressman Herlong.  Ile, and I think Congressman Judd, together,
 introduced the original version of this that has gone through many
 evolutionary stages.
 It did, as the chairman has said, pass the Senate overwhelmingly
 in 1960, but unfortunately too late in the session for the House to give
 it due consideration and.deliberation.  We now have it. before us again.
 It is before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is a badly
 overworked committee, and, while we held extensive hearings last year,
 we did not. have an opportunity to devote sufficient time to mark the
 bill up and bring it out. We hope to do that this year.
 However, I come here to express the hope that, this committee and
 that the House of Representatives in this session will take the initia-
 tive and act. on your version or a version of the Freedom Academy bill
 in the first place.
 I think we can then get it, passed in the Senate. without too much
 difficulty because this is a crying need.  I would like to see it originally
 brought. out. from this committee because as a longtime defender of
 the House Committee on Fn-American Activities, I am aware of the
 kind of criticism which is leveled against it every time appropriations
 are required or every time some disenchanted witness decides to throw
 his barbs at the committee: "Well, this is just an investigating com-
 mittee.                       It doesn't serve any legislative purpose.  It just wastes a lot
 of taxpayers' money.  What. did it ever produce in the way of
 legislation ?"
 (At this point. Mr. Clawson returned to the hearing room.)
 SENATOR Mt'NDT. We have one great big important feather in our
 cap as devotees of this committee because the first. 17 sections of the
 Internal Security Act of 1950 were. written in this committee.  It was
 known for a while as the Mundt-Nixon bill.  It came over and be-
 came part of the McCarran bill of the Senate, but there it is, 17 sections
 of it, written primarily by this committee.
 They still are there.  They are the law of the land, and it was the
 first piece of legislation passed by this Congress to deal comprehen-
 sively with the Communist situation and to provide the mechanics of

 registration and the mechanics of disclosure so important to dealing
 with that kind of internal menace.
 I think you have an opportunity in this legislation to pass a bill
 which is far more important even than that one was, and that is be-
 cause I can think of nothing more important than to try to mobilize
 the expertise of this country into an intelligent and effective contest
 against the Communists in those areas of the world where we meet
 them cheek to jowl in nonmilitary competition.  There isn't anybody
 who can deny the fact, and this goes for the people in the State De-
 partment also, that we are losing the cold war in most of the places
 where we meet in that kind of competition, and it is encouraging that
 the Department of State, which originally looked this over and said,
 "No, we don't like it," finally said, "We will have a Perkins commit-
 tee make a study of the problems and they will give us the proper kind
 of reinforcement so we can say, `No' convincingly enough so Judd
 and Herlong and Gurney and Mundt and Douglas and your committee,
 and our committee will get off our necks and quit talking about it."
 Well, the Perkins committee made a study and to the embarrassment
 of the State Department, instead of saying, "Your Foreign *Service
 Institute is doing the job," they said, "The Foreign Service Institute
 is failing miserably in this area of instruction."
 Something new must be added.  Something new must be done, and
 we are living in a dream world if we actually believe that you can
 continue to send American amateurs into foreign countries to engage
 in competition with Communist professionals with sticcess, because
 in this day and age amateurs don't win anything very often in com-
 petition with professionals, and the American Baseball League and
 the standing of our Senators in that outfit pretty well prove that
 point.
 You have to have people who are trained for the job.  So I would
 like to see this committee take the initiative and really put another
 feather in your war bonnet by coming to grips with the problem and
 getting this legislation on the floor, where I am sure it will pass,
 forcing it over to the Senate; and start at this time in the House,
 because this is the type of 'thing that to the all time credit of this com-
 mittee will strike a real blow against un-American activities all over
 the world.
 I have a prepared statement that I will skip througgh, but I wanted
 to say that as 'a preliminary, because I am proud of the record of this
 committee.  I am proud of the work that you are doing!.' I am.en-
 tirely conversant with the kind of abuse you get.  I suffered it for 10
 years myself.  I had the Communists picketing our apartment down
 at Capitol Towers for the better part of -3 years, as long as the Internal
 Security Act bore the name of Mundt and Nixon when it was going
 through the House. When it got over to the Senate, it bore the name
 of McCarran so the Communist line dispersed, but the 17 sections were
 there.
 Our country, I think we can all admit, has experienced a tremen-
 dous decline in international respect since 1943.  At the end of World
 War II, due both to our leadership toward victory and to an accumu-
 lation of international prestige built over the decade, this country oc-
 cupied an enviable stance.

 nations, and we had the one great. Military Establishment intact- in the
 whole world.
 Now what has happened?  Wliy has the world deteriorated?  You
 can't. point, your finger of blame at any individual or any individual
 policy.  But when that, kind of historic demonstration is before us,
 it seems to me that alert Americans ought to ask themselves why and
 what can we do about it. We spent, $100 billion in foreign aid in
 over 100 foreign countries and the dividends continue to brine de

 misfortunes of the world. We have failed so miserably that when the
 United States under this administration launches a rather humane
 kind of offensive in South Vietnam by using riot gas to disperse Com-
 munist installations-the same kind of tear gas, the same kind of riot
 gas, used by the police departments in every community of this coun-
 try, the same kind of tear gas and riot. gas that. bankers buy and put.
 in bombs to chase bank robbers out; it leaves its victims a#ter a few

 than shooting with a BB rifle in the face, or a pistol or a 22 rifle or
 modern small arms or hand grenades or bombs-tile whole world-the
 Communists, the neutrals, our friends--condemns the United States
 and accuses us of returning to barbarism and using poisonous gas.
 Now look at the other side of the coin.  Just a few days ago the
 Communists out of North Vietnam moved in and bombed our Em-

 support of the United States and publicly said, `"This is barbarism.
 This is a terrible thing. The Communists are launching an attack
 against innocent noncombatants "
 Don't expect the Communists to condemn the North Vietnamese.
 Where are the neutrals? They are not speaking up for us. The peo-
 ple who condemned us for using tear gas are not. condemning the
 communists for killing women and children. Even our friendly coun-
 tries, our associates, and our allies in the Western alliance say nothing
 or say very little against that kind of attack. There is nothing wrong

 are trying to superimpose any religious creed or a political philosophy

 first? You didn't think of it first. I didn't think of it first. I don't
 know whether Alan Grant thought of it first or somebody down on
 the Orlando Committee thought about it first or some happy Florida
 college professor, pepped up by drinking orange juice in the morning,
 thought of it first, but somebody got the idea.
 I think it is a corking good idea, and here is a chance to do some-
 thing about it and I am appalled at a State Department which comes
 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a
 member, and when we say, "What is wrong in Saigon?  Why can't
 they maintain a stable government?" They say, "The military is all
 right. These little fellows are good fighters, but they can't develop a
 civilian government.  They can't have stability among the people
 governing the land. They don't have any trained people under the
 top leaders."
 Think of it. This is their testimony. This is how they try to defend
 the fact that they don't get anyplace : "The military does a good job,
 but the civilian government, led first by one leader of South Vietnam
 and then by another, in the lower echelon are untrained. They are
 unskilled. They don't know how to run the machinery of freedom."
 And we ask them, "Then, you as a State Department are primarily.
 responsible for the collapse of South Vietnam because you have
 blocked the only-the only-effort to provide that kind of training
 for those kind of people."
 That is where we stand.  You can correct it. We can help correct
 it.
 I think that perhaps some of this reaction to America is inevitable
 because we are rich and because we are powerful, but I don't think that
 reaction is automatic, because I think that sometimes wealth and power
 have traditionally elicited respect., more commonly than hatred. Peo-
 ple have migrated to this country by the tens of millions because they
 admire our wealth and our power and our system, so it isn't something
 of which we should be ashamed.
 More than that has to be involved. The United States has expended
 these efforts outside our borders now for a long time, about 24 or 25
 years I believe since we passed H.R. 1776, the lend-lease bill. I was a
 member of Sol Bloom's House Committee on Foreign Affairs when
 we passed the thing in its first inception. It was to last. 2 years, and
 now it has lasted 24 or 25 years, and we get abuse instead of acclama-
 tion for what we are doing.
 (At this point Mr. Pool entered the hearing room.)
 SENATOR MUNDT. I think we have waited too long to come to grips
 with the basic problem. We have become an international scapegoat,
 despite our generosity, and it is more difficult to turn somebody who
 hates you into a friend than it is to avoid causing the person to hate
 you in the first instance.
 I know that we realize the United States does not deserve this
 hatred. We have done more in a sincere effort to cultivate friendship
 than anybody in the history of the world and we have reason to hope
 for better reactions and we have reason to feel that we are entitled
 to them.
 Our fault has been a failure to comprehend what makes the other
 peoples tick, to understand their philosophy, their background, their
 psychology. We have concentrated on one problem-foreign develop-

 ment, economic aid. We have done very little effectively to encourage
 the propagation of attitudes friendly to our interests or to utilize
 assistance to best further our own interests. This isn't just a matter
 of straight information. When I was in the House of Representatives,
 we passed Public Law 402 of the 80th Congress which provided the
 mechanics of information, the Voice of America, the mobilized libra-
 ries, the libraries on sites over there, the whole program of student
 exchanges. This was fine, straight information, but there is failure-
 and Mr. Clawson was touching on that point a moment ago in talkin
 g
 with Mr. Gurney-to understand the people with whom we deal and
 to understand the job our people are supposed to be doing over there.
 They fail to get the job done primarily because they fail to under-
 stand thoroughly, as experts should, the whole challenge of our day
 and age and what precipitates it..
 We seem to depend strongly on rationality. We are practical; we
 attempt to disseminate information on a straight information ap-
 proach. The other fellow uses propaganda, which is a more effective
 selling technique.
 In developing areas of the world, we increasingly confront Com-
 munist antagonists who compete for allegiance, or at least tolerance,
 among the same host people where our diplomats and our Americans
 are housed.  The Communists elicit emotional responses, where ours
 are rational responses.  They are evangelists. We are practical sales-
 men. They offer with development activity a dogma, a creed, that
 Packs emotional substance aloe  with rational approach; that is, they
 build dams and spread a world view which helps people torn away
 from their traditional ways of life and their homeland by the impact
 of the dam to adjust to the new life. In this view propa gated by the
 Communists of course, the United States is the world s fundamental
 evil and when we build dams we simply flood people out of their homes
 with no regard for human beings.
 Somehow our people have not been able to study their hosts in the
 intensity required to understand how to appeal emotionally as well as
 rationally.  The question of race supplies an excellent example.
 We go into the situation as democratic people who believe that all
 men are created equal, should have anequal opportunity, but we fail
 to translate American concepts in terms of people of different races
 and different attitudes and different areas to make them appeal to them
 in the kind of atmosphere in which they live and with the type of
 associates with whom they commingle.
 So while we work Bard to bring benevolent change to hundreds of
 millions of people, the Communists exploit the insecurity and the
 threat to individual identity resulting from our and their efforts at.
 economic development.
 The Freedom Academy bills before your committee propose inten-
 sive basic research, first of all.  They propose an effort to master an
 academic discipline fairly new to us-nonmilitary warfare, in which
 we have been engaged with great futility for 17 or 18 years.  This
 discipline involves the understanding of emotional and psychological
 processes of differing Peoples. People from different national back-
 grounds are motivated by different stimuli.  To erect adequate de-
 fense against nonmilitary aggression waged against, our interests, we
 seriously need this understanding.

 Our social sciences, of course, in this country lead in this direction,
 but they are incomplete.  Their material is not put together and uni-
 fied and integrated and related to the attitudes and the minds and the
 mores of the people in the host countries where we meet the Commu-
 nists toe to toe and one or the other is winning and one or the other
 is losing in an economic war and in a political war and in a propaganda
 war.
 People base their attitudes and judgments on cultural values that
 they know.  Differences are apparent even within the United States.
 People from different areas often build and hold to different values.
 Maine is quite different from Arkansas.  Translated outside our gen-
 eral culture, this raises fundamental problems.  How well do our
 people comprehend the effects of American activity in different cul-
 tures when we have no concentrated effort to understand their cultures?
 Part of the problem is the inclination to apply knowledge gained in
 social sciences by observation and measurement among one segment of
 human civilization to other segments where such information does not
 apply.  Africans act differently from Americans.   Apparently
 Laotians act differently from Vietnamese. Certainly Chinese act dif-
 ferently from Russians, even though they both claim adherence to
 Marx.
 Knowledge about differing national and racial characteristics is
 diffuse. It is not systematized. You can't read it in a book. We need
 an institution like the Freedom Academy to systematize it and to dis-
 seminate it among persons who can utilize it in our own interest.
 I have talked to many American diplomats. "How much training
 have you had in the job of defeating communism in the area where
 you are going to do the work? "
 The answer : A day, 3 days, a week, 2 weeks.
 It is a tremendous challenge. They ought to study it as hard as a
 dentist studies a tooth before he puts up a shingle and says, "I am a
 dentist and I can take care of human beings."
 We cannot assume that other people think like we do. We should
 learn how they do think and determine how to apply that knowledge
 to our interest. Our antagonists utilize such knowledge to undercut
 governments friendly to us, to subvert independent nations, to mobilize
 youths, to get mobs to burn down our libraries. They are motivated to
 do things which they shouldn't be doing because the Communists have
 made a study of what it takes to motivate the people in that particular
 country about the kind of problems that confront them.
 The Communists know something about their target people. They
 appeal to hatred, to grudges, to resentments, to discontent, to idealism,
 to ambitions, whatever motivates them. They appeal to the poor to
 rid themselves of exploiters, and they label us the exploiters. They
 appeal to the young to institute justice, and they label us as the manu-
 facturers and portrayers of injustice. We need the same knowledge
 about what motivates these people to help to improve their defense
 against such tactics, for their defense contributes to our own defense.
 What is in this Freedom Academy bill, then, which is applicable to
 what I have been talking about? I would like to outline a few factors
 in the proposed legislation which are potentially responsive to the
 challenge.

 1. This institution would not be encumbered by the traditionally
 highly specialized structure of social science. Instead of economics,
 sociology, political science, linguistics, and the many others, each
 maintained in a separate compartment., the whole lot would be unified
 in a shape applicable to this analysis of various cultures. The whole
 world then could be contemplated, as well as men can do it, in a unified
 and not a highly diversified way.  Such comprehension would allow
 for more thorough instruction than is now available on the imine-
 diate problem. It would be a better answer than the State Depart-
 ment's casual comment that. they can get it at. Princeton, they can get
 it at Ifarvard, they can get it at George Washington, they can get it
 at Georgetown, they can get it at. American University. They are not
 getting it.. It. isn't taught anywhere.
 The question is should they have it, or should we send out. amateurs?
 2. It. would permit research into subjects now ignored. How non-
 military warfare or guerrilla warfare is fought would be analyzed, for
 example. We have a War College for military warfare.  We don't
 even have a kindergarten for nonmilitary warfare, and this year we
 will continue spending in the long pull in this economic program.
 If the economic cultural program fails, we have to fight a. "hot"
 war. This is the waging of peace, but we don't have a kindergarten
 where they teach how to avoid the war they hope never to fight.. They
 have war colleges all over the place. They have military academies,
 air academies, merchant marine academies, and a war college in town;
 nothing for the fellow who wants to be able to develop an expertise
 as a peacetime representative fighting in the cold war for the. U.S.A.
 3. As a pioneer in research and training in areas not now familiar,
 the Freedom Academy work and methods might., where successful,
 serve as an example for imitation by other institutions.  Maybe it
 would make it possible for some of the great universities of this coun-
 try and colleges to improve their own programs.
 I heard what Mr. Gurney said. They require them to teach what
 communism is, the true facts about. communism, in Florida. They have
 a difficult time getting a textbook. You can get one written by a crypto-
 Communist that makes it sound better than it is. You can get one
 written by some extremist in the anti-Communist field who makes it
 sound like something which it is not. But to get an objective, intelli-
 gent, analytical basis, it is very difficult to find a text written either
 for colleges or high schools.
 4. TheFreedom Academy could lead to better comprehension of our
 own Government and of executive branch processes in foreign affairs
 as they are related to the problems of combating communism in foreign
 countries.
 5. The Freedom Academy could organize, verify, and systematize
 ideas and data and concepts from throughout the world, from every
 possible cultural situation, and apply them to our interests, so that
 those who go there to represent us in the foreign country would know
 something more than about the geographical facts, something more
 besides the population facts, and the rainfall facts. They would know
 what it is that makes people operate in that area, what motivates them,
 what their dreams are, what their ideals are, what their fears are, what
 their history has led them to support. or to fear.

 6. It would better situate us to keep pace with world change.  As
 change occurs it would be observed and evaluated as part of the con-
 tinuous research effort.  Since we passed the Voice of America pro-
 gram in this Congress, originating also in the House, in the 80th Con-
 gress, the vision of America throughout the world has become more im-
 portant than the Voice of America, the utilization of television and
 community screens and the whole Pandora's box of opportunity that
 television provides. We are playing with it as though it were a toy.
 We have done a good job with radio, not very much on television.
 People can believe what they see, and we can get a story across through
 the use of the various opportunities of television.
 7. It would provide information helpful to private business in main-
 taining good relations with host governments and peoples abroad.
 American corporations all over the place have fine junior executives
 stationed in virtually every foreign capital of the world.  They are
 eager to help in the fight for freedom.  They are motivated not only
 as patriotic Americans; they are motivated because their job goes
 out the window when the Communists walk in the door.        They are
 motivated because their corporation might be expropriated.
 The corporation, the one that pays their check, is pushed out of the
 country and they lose their job. Self-preservation is the greatest mo-
 tivating factor any human being has ever had anywhere.                                          They are
 motivated by self-preservation plus pretty good Americanism.  They
 would like to help, but a lot of them :develop into the "Ugly American"
 and they are hurting us.  Why?  Nobody has trained them.    Nobody
 has given them the background.  They know what to do to sell Buick
 automobiles, aspirins, and Coca-Cola, but they don't know what to do
 about serving Americanism.  Even President Eisenhower one time
 when asked by Khrushchev, "Tell us the difference between com-
 munism and democracy," said it was too difficult a question to translate.
 Every American ought to have an answer to that one quickly,
 which is right, which is sound. He has to get it some place.  He has
 to understand it and an American shouldn't speak like a Babel tower
 with a thousand different explanations of the difference.  We ought
 to understand it so well that you can say it with the same validity that
 you talk about the Constitution and what is the 10th amendment or
 the 5th amendment or the 1st amendment.
 8. It would bolster our defense and the defense of nations not
 unfriendly to us in resisting Communist nonmilitary aggression.
 9. It would teach Americans to understand the factors which moti-
 vate the Communists and would identify the best means to counteract
 that motivation and to help advance democratic processes instead of
 communism, one of the most difficult jobs I could never quite master
 after serving almost 10 years on this committee on which you serve so
 well now-what is actually motivating a Communist?
 I asked it of Alger Hiss. I asked it of Elizabeth Bentley. I asked
 it of Whittaker Chambers. They are smart people that could make a
 success in any area. "What in the devil makes you work for the Com-
 munists?"  And their eyes glitter and they have a sense of mission
 and they themselves believe they are somehow serving a good cause.
 They don't do it for money. They don't do it for power. I am talk-
 ing about these people in our country, like the three that I have
 mentioned.

 What motivates Communists? We ought. to know that and get, the
 demotivator in operation and try to motivate them with a better ideal,
 a religious ideal, an ideal of the brotherhood of man, the equality of
 opportunity, and the American dream. But first we have to under-
 stand that. these are just not a bunch of people going out because they
 are paid. They are prodded into supporting the Communists. They
 have been misled. They have been brainwashed, gentlemen, by some
 of the greatest psychologists in the world.
 You know what they talk about with respect to Dr. Pavlov and his
 dog and the condition of saliva, not a condition of mind. The whole
 Communist approach is based on the conditioning capacity of the
 human mind and how you operate it., and our people overseas ought
 to understand that.
 We should know how to condition people in freedom.
 Let. me conclude by saying that I think that the training in this
 Academy would primarily include three categories. You are familiar
 with them. The first is what. I have been talking about, the intense
 training of people from our own Government who work in foreign
 affairs, how to give them the tools they need to achieve the objectives
 that they hold in mind.
 Second, there would be training for Americans engaged in non-
 Government activity, in the private sector. Read the sorry State De-
 partment substitute evolved from the Perkins commission report which
 they put in as a backfire to the Freedom Academy concept. They don't
 even approximate anywhere the concept of giving people in the pri-
 vate, sector a chance for 90 days or 9 months or some other period of
 time, who are going to serve a lifetime overseas to become volunteers
 in this great crusade for freedom by giving them the training and
 the equipment.
 We have been told by employers the would love to put their em-
 ployees in hero with their expenses and Iet them learn. They would
 love to have them learn the common goal which we have, but there is
 no place they can go. We wonder why we don't win the cold war. We
 haven't even begun to fight with the troops available.
 Third, the United States would, at long last, establish a   litical
 training center for foreign nationals who are either favorable to our
 values or who want to stop or avoid Communist subversion in their
 countries. We have identified six schools to which young Communists
 can go in China or in Russia or in Yugoslavia anbecome ex[~erts in
 the conveying and portraying of communism. There is no enlace, no
 place, a young Vietnamese civilian who wants to develop stability and
 permanency and continuity in government in Saigon can go to get it.
 The French, don't have it.. The British don't have it.  We don't havo
 it.
 If lie wants to be a soldier fighting in the ungle, we can send him
 to the United States. We will train him and send him back to fight..
 If he wants to be an aviator, we will train him.  If lie wants to be a
 navigator, we Will train him.
 But if he wants to be a statesman, if he wants to maintain stable
 government., if lie wants to set up democratic processes, we say, "You
 can go to college someplace.  We can get you a scholarship.  Go to
 Harvard," or some other school.  And it helps him and it. is good, but
 he doesn't become expert in this field. It is a little remnant of the days

 of a long time ago when we had a sort of inter-American training con-
 cept so that young bureaucrats, civil servants from Latin American
 countries, would come up to this country and serve in the various offices
 here that they served in there, and I have addressed, and maybe you
 have addressed, some of their commencement exercises.  It is good for
 them. They learn a little about the census if theylare in censud work
 or about agriculture if they are in agriculture. Vey don't have any
 place to go to learn about the existing menace.
 We have been trying to do the impossible. We have been trying to
 win with amateurs against people who have been carefully trained.
 Citizens of non-Communist countries who would like to benefit by
 appropriate training simply cannot find any place in the world an in-
 stitution to which they can go.
 May I conclude by saying I honestly believe this is the most im-
 portant legislation this committee or this Congress has ever had.
 Its passage, I believe, would benefit freedonr and promote permanent
 peace more than any one thing that Congress could enact.  I ask
 permission, if I may have it, Mr. Chairman, to include at the end
 of my remarks three recent statements I have made on the floor of
 the Senate about the Freedom Academy'
 Mr. ICHORD. Without. objection permission will be granted and,
 Senator Mundt, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your
 very valuable contributions to the record on these bills.  I would state
 to you that it is the intention of the committee to conclude the hear-
 ings next week'and we will definitely take action on this legislation
 and make a final disposition of the same.
 You have talked considerably about the South Vietnam problem,
 and today we are concerned about the escalation of what is going on
 now in South Vietnam into a full-scale military war.
 I sometimes think we have forgotten that over the years the problem
 in South Vietnam has escalated from the nonmilitary field into the
 present situation.
 SENATOR MUNDT. It is a most perceptive observation and absolutely
 correct.
 Mr. IcxoRD. On February 24, 1965, we had a discussion on the
 South Vietnam situation, led by Mr. Gallagher, a gentleman from
 New Jersey a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; and the
 gentleman Irom Florida Mr. Fascell, also a member of the Foreign
 Affairs Committee, made a very interesting observation which I
 would like to read into the record at this time, and I quote :
 The Vietnam and Cuban problem emphasizes the continuing difficulty that
 the United States and the free world have in dealing with a new concept of
 international politics which has been evidenced by the Communist world.  We
 no longer have fixed lines in the old military sense.  That went out many years
 ago.  We no longer have a direct or overt crossing of a boundary line by a
 recognizable armed force.  We no longer have a clear-cut definition of what
 is armed, overt, or just plain aggression.  This requires us on the free world
 side to maintain more than military flexibility.  A standard, flexible, or new.
 military response appears to be insufficient to a problem like the one we are
 facing in Vietnam, despite the fact that we are committed to a military response
 and may have to respond in even a greater degree.  But we have not solved
 the basic problem of how to deal effectively in nonmilitary terms with what
 is commonly called subversion either military, economic, or political.

 We are willing and should be willing to commit the necessary manpower,
 materiel, and resources to meet any military threat, but we must also look one
 step ahead and be working to obtain those solutions which will permit us to
 deal effectively with subversion without being forced Into a partial or full mili-
 tary response.
 I think, Senator, that we will all agree that we are not succeeding
 in meeting effectivelyy the subversion, the political warfare waged b
 the Communists.  How do you consider the Freedom Academy will
 operate? It will not bean operational body as such.
 SENATOR MUNP'r. No, I don't envision a university campus and a set
 of buildings or a formal situation like that.  I envision instead a train-
 ing procedure, many times operating in the form of seminars under
 the general aegis of the Freedom Academy Commission and that, in
 the main, its faculty members will be recruited from knowledgeable
 people in Government, some from outside of Government.  I suspect
 they will have to have sore chancellor or chairman or president to sort
 of direct the operations, but a fairly good analogy is the way the
 War College operates.
 It doesn't have a campus.       It doesn't have a football team.  It
 doesn't have a college yell.  This is a place where people go to get
 the kind of training they need.  I envision that as far as the training
 procedure.  The research business will have to be done by experts.
 It will have to have a library to which people can go to undertake
 certain assignments.
 There is a young man who is going to be assigned to the Congo, let's
 say, by General Motors or by Coca-Cola.  For his career and to be-
 come just as expert as he can in this problem, he. is going to attend
 a class with Congolese background, but under knowledgeable direc-
 tion.  He will be given this whole understanding so before he goes
 he will know first of all, and I think this is paramount, exactly what
 the Communists are doing there to try to undermine us and how they
 operate and to what what impulses and motivations and aspirations
 they appeal when they go to their Congolese hosts, everything that they
 do. And they would not I believe, Mr. Clawson, engage in cotuiter-
 espionage, but they would engage in countercontacts against these
 operations, trying to offset them. That would be part of the job, to try
 to defeat this thrust. that the Communists are making in their cultural
 and propaganda and economic activities, and also to get- on the. offen-
 sive, to do things which, if they succeed, will be highly embarrassing
 to the Communists, which will show Their system up for the failure
 that it is.
 They become experts trained over here, as I say, in seminars and
 private tutelage, research, by bringing to bear in dial particular case
 the best genius and ability that we have.
 Mr. Iciroun. The Academy would also not be a policymaking body.
 SENATOR 111uxnT. It would not.  We strictly say the State Depart-
 ment is that body.

 meet the problems which confront them. They are somehow or other
 sealed in the 19th century concepts of diplomacy, which used to work
 all right, but they just haven't grown up to the new challenge.
 As I said to the Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee about 3 months ago-21/2 months ago maybe-"Dean, we are
 all trying to do the same thing here, but you have a fearful respon-
 sibility.  If this thing fails now and this triggers off a great atomic

 to develop the stable civilian central government, which you say is in-
 dispensable to military success."
 And maybe it wouldn't work, but we have been in this thing for 5
 years. Suppose we tried 5 years ago and brought in 500 South Viet-
 namese civilians, servants, in government each year. We would now
 have 2,500 people who were trained to understand the discipline of
 democracy rather than the compulsions of communism, who would
 understand that the function of a bureaucrat or a civil servant in the
 central government of Saigon is to be loyal to his country and to work
 with whoever is in control of his government, not to try to figure out
 some way to upset, the fellow and put somebody else in and keep con-
 stant turmoil going. A public office is a public trust, not a license to
 steal, not ,,t position from which you can promote your own personal or
 political or private fortunes, but a place to develop these concepts of
 service, patriotism, that public servants have in our country.
 Mr. IorroRD. Senator Mundt, the Academy will be both teaching,
 training, and also conducting research.
 SENATOR MUNDT. That is right.
 Mr. IcTioRD. New means and methods of fighting successfully cold
 warfare.
 SENATOR MUNDT. The chairman has stated it exactly correct.
 Mr. IcnoRD. Then what do you think would be the most important
 contribution that the Academy could make?
 SENATOR MUNDT. It is hard to evaluate them on a priority basis,
 Mr. Chairman, because we are dealing in a field which has been so com-
 pletely neglected.  I honestly believe if we were just going to do one
 single thing this would be a colossal mistake.  I think it would be
 perpetuating the failures of the past, but I think the greatest glaring
 weakness on the whole free side of the world is the fact that a young
 Filipino or Vietnamese or Congolese, a young or old civil servant
 abroad, newly involved with all the responsibilities of running a demo-
 cratic state of some kind or another adapted to his climate just hasn't
 any place in the world he can go to learn to run the machinery of free-
 dom.  He can learn to be a preacher or a doctor or a dentist or an
 agrarian, but no matter how deep his dream or how high his hopes,
 there is no place he can go and learn precisely what you have to do to
 operate the machinery for freedom in the world in which Communists
 continue to try to encroach upon you and undermine you.
 So I think I would have to place that at the top, but I would hate
 to put it on a priority basis.  You can build, I think, equally strong
 arguments of the other aspects of the Freedom Academy complex.
 Mr. Iciioim. Mr. Pool.

 committee last year brought up one objection to the Freedom Academy
 in which he said that it woud  be Federal control of education.  I
 would like to hear your comments on that.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Yes. That same point was made in our Senate
 hearings.  Personally, I can't we any basis for than  In the first
 place you start. out here, talking now about the first two sectors, for
 Americans, private or public figures, you are dealing with people who
 have been pretty well educated.  Most of them are college graduates,
 I hope, before the State Department brhigs them on board. They
 have their academic training. They have been through high school,
 grade school, and they have been through college.  This is teaching
 them in techniques, and they come under a certain control of Federal
 discipline, Congressman, the minute they take the oath of office as a
 Foreign Service officer.
 Their job is to carry out the policy of the President and the State
 Department and the Congress.  All we are adding to that. is, here are
 the tools with which you can move on it.
 As far as bringing in the foreigners are concerned, they raised the
 objection, "Well, this might be considered some kind of propaganda."
 Well, so be it.  I guess in a world in which the forces of propaganda
 are arrayed, unless we do something to propagandize our cause we are
 not going to win it..
 They are doing plenty to propagandize theirs. We take people who
 want to come over. We don't go out and recruit them or solicit them
 or sign them up because they are good football players or boomerang
 throwers or something else.. They come over because they want to
 learn about our way of life, and "Here it is, Chum.  You can take it
 or leave it. This is it," and give them an opportunity. I don't think
 it is serious reason for people to vote against the Freedom Academy
 concept.
 Mr. Poor,. You can draw an analogy also between the service acad-
 emies. You can say that is Federal control of education, but it is a
 necessary thing that we have defense and this is part of our defense.
 Senator MUNtrr. You make a very good analogy there, and there
 is even more danger, if you are worrying about Federal control there, because they are teaching at the college level. We are at least get-
 ting people who have gotten out of the college and have gone to the
 college of their choice.
 Mr. Ienotm. Would the gentleman yield at this point? This year, Senator Mundt, the State Department made this state-
 ment in opposition to the bill, and I read :
 Expertise and operational experience are as important in the formulation of
 policy as they are in Its execution,  For this reason, the Department seriously
 questions whether comprehensive and realistic plans for dealing with the In-
 finitely complex problem of U.B. foreign affairs can be developed by a new,
 separate Government agency, especially one without operational responsibilities.
 The Department seems to be saying that before you can possibly
 formulate any policy you have to be in the operating field. I don t
 quite understand the point the Department is making there. It would
 appear to me that the Department would have the point of view that
 the colleges today which are conducting research for the Federal Gov-
 ernment and also for business are not capable of conducting research
 into business, into governmental operations, because they are not in
 the operating field.

 SENATOR MUNDT. I am glad the chairman prefaced his statement
 by saying, "It would appear to me," because it is a statement which is
 certainly subject to a lot of interpretations. It is not very clear-cut
 It is written by a fellow who is accustomed to discussing some diplo-
 matic blunder overseas and who can say it in language you can read
 any way, certainly not a very succinct or concise statement.
 Mr. IcuIORD. Perhaps the State Department doesn't understand
 the true concept of the Academy. It is not an operational body.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Right. It appears to me they are simply saying
 something which isn't the fact. We are not trying to develop the poh-
 cymakers at the top level.  We are trying to develop the operational
 people to carry out the policies.  I suspect the State Department,
 which is criticized for lots of things, thinks we are trying to criticize
 the policy.  It isn't that at all.. The policies, we have to believe, made
 by Americans are generally going to be good.
 Mr. IcuoRD. Of course, the Department may feel that the Academy
 will intrude into their traditional area of responsibility and authority.
 SENATOR MUNDT. True, and it is going to expand the circle of ex-
 perts and maybe some of these operational people will grow up to be
 policy people some time, and I think that. might be good for the
 country.
 Mr. IcuoRD. That certainly wouldn't be operating within the State
 Department field.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Not at all, no.
 Mr. ICHORD. Go ahead, Mr. Pool.
 Mr. PooL. I have one other question which I asked yesterday. This
 witness last fall from the Army was testifying about Vietnam. He
 was telling about the regional offices of the Viet Cong and where they
 sent out terroristic gangs to go into these villages and if they didn't
 agree with them they murdered the mayor or the leader, and he recited
 many things that the American people would not countenance.  It
 would be against our morals to do things that they do. I don't believe
 that we can just give up and say, "Well we can't operate that way."
 I think that a Freedom Academy could do research and find methods
 to combat that type of activity, and I would like to hear your com-
 ment on that.  I am sure you have thought about that.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Yes.  I am glad you mentioned the village anal-
 ysis, because we were discussing with Maxwell Taylor and some of the
 other people from the military and the State Department over at the
 Foreign Relations Committee one day what our general approach
 was to this problem of the underground operation down in the Me-
 kong Delta. And they mentioned they have built a large part of it
 on the village concept, which you discussed, that you develop a little
 village government. They develop a compound. The peasants work
 in the daytime and come back at night. They have an orderly system
 of government, but they have been unable to develop methods for
 screening out the subversive elements that creep in.  They haven't
 been able to develop an adequate police force to protect them at night
 and they do get down through the compound and murder the village
 chief and parade through the village with his head on the end of a
 stick, and that discourages somebody else from running for mayor.

 So I raised the perfectly innocent, question, "flow do you train these
 mayors? Where do you get them? how do you train these municipal
 governments?"
 You would think I asked them a question in Chinese. They never
 hoard of such a thing, the idea that you are going to have sonic place
 to train them, another look at places you can send them in this country
 to train. You could send them to a municipality to train them and, if
 you had it systematized as you would tinder this Freedom Academy
 concept, you would at. least let him know "If you are going to be a good
 mayor you have to have a police department." You experts in this
 field of subversion in our country have staff members, and you yourself
 are competent to say some of the things they have to do to be alert to
 the subversive elements from the Communist Party who are going to
 try to weasel their way in.
 Actually I think it is a cruel thing to say, but we haven't made an
 intelligent try at winning the conflict in Vietnam with peaceful meth-
 ods.  I have no particular criticism of the military methods. This is
 a tight, spot they are in. But. I shed crocodile tears that we have wasted
 years and we haven't been training these village chiefs and these
 mayors and these civil servants,
 Mr. POOL, And we are getting into the basics when we think of those
 problems. We have to have a way to do it, and this Freedom Academy,
 the way I envisage the Freedom Academy, would have a curriculum
 to work on that, problem and also to find out whom they are going to
 train and how they are going to train them.
 I am sure there is an answer to any type activity on the Communist
 side if we just work at it and do research and have experts in the field
 to work at. it, and we don't have any schools in the United States doing
 that. at the present time.
 SENATOR  uN[)T. This is right.
 Mr. POOL. As you said a while ago, it is a bunch of amateurs and
 we can't win with amateurs.
 SENATOR Murrnr. You are absolutely right.
 Mr. IcnoRn. Mr. Pool, the Senator made a very interesting observa-
 tion before you came in about the tear gas situation in South Vietnam.
 I, like the Senator, was completely astounded at some, of the people
 in the United States speaking out against. the use of tear gas, as I un-
 derstand to be the case, not by the United States, but by the South
 Vietnamese themselves, who when they are out pursuing an enemy, the
 Viet Cong, and go into a village, rather than going into the village and
 bombing the entire villa's and perhaps killing all of the innocent
 villagers, they go out ancsubjeet then to tear gas or nauseating gas,
 whatever you call it, and they are able to take the Viet Cong in a more
 humane way and save lives.
 SENATORMux[Yr. In that. connection, Mr. Chairman. I had an inter-
 esting letter just the other day from a dear friend of mine back home,
 a minister of the Gospel, just. giving the administration the devil and
 castigating it from one end to the other for even using the barbaric
 weapon called gas, so I wrote him. I said, "Look, as a Republican I
 don t like to spend too much time every day justifying the acts of the
 administration, but let nee ask you the question. Suppose you had been

 the target. Would you rather have been gassed with tear gas and be
 feeling all right a few hours later, or hit in the back with a bullet
 or hit on the head with a club?"
 Well, he thought it over pretty carefully and he said, "I guess maybe
 the administration wasn't so wrong on that."
 The publicity was bad.
 Mr. IcIroRD. I was talking to an enlisted member of our Armed
 Forces the other day who was also astonished at the reaction in this
 country. He merely pointed out in his training he and many of the
 boys were subjected to tear gas by being placed in a building where tear
 gas, a nauseating gas, was exploded, and usually about 50 percent of
 the boys before they got their gas masks on were overcome by the gas,
 particularly if they didn't know how to get the gas masks on effectively.
 Does the gentleman from California have any questions?
 Mr. CLAWSON. Just one or two : Senator, you provoked a number
 of questions in my mind over the establishment of the Freedom Acad-
 emy and our activity in this direction in order to win the global struggle
 which you have described, and you have indicated to win is necessary.
 May I ask one very simple question? Do you think peaceful coex-
 istence with communism is possible?
 SENATOR MUNDT. Yes, because the alternative is global atomic war,
 and I would hate to get into that pessimistic camp, so I think it is pos-
 sible and I think it is possible to win.
 All of us believe our system is infinitely better. Our selling tech-
 niques are not as good.  Our methods of winning the people are not as
 good. It is more difficult to translate the aspirations of free men into
 the minds of aborigines than it is the immediate rewards of commu-
 nism, but it is not impossible. What brought all our ancestors to this
 country in the first place as immigrants? It was this American dream
 that we just have to take over and sell to them and make it possible for
 them to do.
 Mr. ICHORD. I take it the Senator is not so hopeful that the Com-
 munists will change in, and of, or by themselves.
 SENATOR MUNDT. No, I certainly do not. I think we have to set them
 back, and with all our fumbling, we see evidences that they are lagging
 behind in consumer goods over there in meeting the needs of their own
 people. They are finding it more and more difficult to keep their satel-
 lites in line. With a little intelligence muscle applied, I think we could
 have won this thing in the last 17 years and not spent as much money
 as we have.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I am not nearly as optimistic as you apparently seem
 to be, looking at Christianity in the past 2,000 years and the ability,
 in a peaceful way, to sell what we believe is right. We have had dedi-
 cated evangelistic type of people who are selling.
 You indicated a period of possibly. 5 years experimenting with this.
 SENATOR MUNDT. About what?
 Mr. CLAWSON. Five years.
 SENATOR MUNDT. No; I said 5 years in Vietnam. We have lost 5
 years of opportunity.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I misunderstood.

 Senator MuN-DT. No; I don't think we are going to have peaceful
 coexistence with Communists and defeat them in 5 years.
 Mr. CLAWSON. No major inroads are going to be made within the
 period of 5 years. I am afraid what you are talking about is a total
 global struggle.
 Mr. Pool.. It could very easily be a hundred years.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Very much.
 Mr. CLAWSON. This is a long-term program.  The State Depart
 mint has indicated in correspondence that I have had with them, and
 this hasn't been verified, that they are now doing many of the things
 that you are talking about with respect to the Freedom Academy in
 connection with foreign assignments-their economics, society, their
 geography, their culture, their language.
 All of these things are being taught, so to speak, before they are ever
 assigned to a country.
 SENATOR MLTNDT. They are pecking away at it.   They are not making
 any experts. They are giving a very short period of time in the Com-
 munist techniques. We are talking here now not just about taking
 these American officials who go overseas, whose job it is to represent
 us, and giving them a quickie course in these things of 30 days or so.
 We should take the time. It may be 6 months; it may be 9 months;
 it may be a year; it may be longer, depending upon the complications
 involved, but making them experts in this field.
 Mr. CLAWSON. What guarantees would we have that we would be
 more successful? Would tests be given and this'sort of thing? Some
 of our training today is certainly in capsule form and it is thrown at
 them in doses that. years ago would have been considered perhaps
 totally impossible to be absorbed by the people who are taking these
 courses.
 SENATOR MuNDT. This is right. They would be screened out. They
 would be tested. This is the seminar or academy concept., that you
 train people and explore how successful we have been.
 Mr. CLAWSON. This could have been in the existing program?
 SENATOR MuNDT. There isn't any such existing progr,im. There is
 no place for the foreign national to cone, no place for anybody in the
 private sector to cone, no place where they have done the research
 in the place to get. the raw material with which to teach, having for
 them the kind of experts, advocates, and tutors required to do the kind
 of job we are thinking about. It isn't. here.
 First, you have to have, as in any school, a teacher and it background
 and a textbook and the research and the know-how and then the ability
 to impart it to the people who need to absorb it.  The Foreign Service
 Institute, you say, now does a good ti  of teaching them the language,
 does a good job of teaching them thee. economics of the situation, the
 population statistics, the kind of seasons that they have, does it good
 job on how to try to maintain security for your records and how you
 transport the innumerable cables that. go back and forth, but it doesn't
 even get into this thing, in the depth required and the depth achieved
 by their Communist aersaries.  We are forced by the kind of com-
 petition we meet over there to use professionals, in my opinion, to will.
 Mr. IciioRn. In that respect, if the gentleman will yield, last year

 we had the State Department testifying on these bills and the Senator
 has made a statement in reference to the Foreign Aervice Institute.
 Of course, we don't have a complete record as to what the State De-
 partment is doing in this field-and I might point out that much of it
 have in the record-but n regard tote Nat owouldn't be nal Academy of Foreign
 Affairs, I got the idea.--
 SENATOR MUNDT. You mean for foreign nationals?
 Mr. ICHORD. The National Academy of Foreign Affairs recom-
 mended by the State Department.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Yes, I see.
 Mr. IcnoRD. I got the idea that the State Department in that bill
 had borrowed many of the concepts set forth in this Freedom Academy
 legislation. They did make it possible to train private citizens, for
 example.  I know they don't contemplate doing it on as large a scale as
 contemplated by these bills.
 SENATOR MUNDT. This is correct.  After their first testimony in op-
 position to that as their bill has evolved, as ours has, they have brought
 some of that in, and I am not a stickler, whether you call it an Academy
 of Foreign Affairs or a Freedom Academy. The Foreign Service
 Institute which they now operate isn't doing the job and the commis-
 sion they appointed to collect the orchids to pin on the breasts of the
 State Department came back with brickbats and catcalls. The Per-
 kins commission jarred it, and then they began to move in this
 direction.
 Mr. ICHORD. I would like to ask the Senator how you envisage the
 information center operating.  There has been some question about
 the advisability of such a center being established.
 SENATOR MUNDT. Yes. This would operate much along the same line
 that the Voice of America information service and the U.S. Informa-
 tion Service, and that means that they limit what they provide to the
 needs of the people who are qualified to function and to operate the
 activities of the Government.  It is not a propaganda instrumen-
 tality to be turned internally upon the schools. It provides the facts,
 which are documented without any propaganda, and it does it primari-
 ly to train the people who are going to utilize it. It could be made
 available to a college professor who wants to come and learn it if he is
 going to be stuck with the job he has in Florida of teaching com-
 munism or a high school professor, but not in the sense of propaganda
 at all.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I have just one more question in that connection.
 This is the first of these hearings that I have been in on, and I am in-
 terested in this legislation.
 I certainly appreciate your testimony and I think it lays a good
 foundation for me and I am sure it is beneficial to the committee.
 Since you have indicated that junior executives of American corpora-
 tions going into foreign lands might be involved in this program, and
 certainly our own foreign diplomatic corps and our State Department
 personnel, would you seek to have a compulsory program under the
 Freedom Academy?

 March 4, 1965   CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE        (p. 4059)
 THE FREEDOM ACADEMY
 Mr. MUNDT.    Mr. President, it is my
 intention to address the Senate briefly
 each week in order to emphasize our
 need for legislation patterned after our
 Freedom Academy bill  (S. 1232). I
 intend to present timely evidence sup-
 porting the contention behind the bill
 that we are yielding ground which we
 need not yield in our efforts to stem the
 expansion of aggressive communism.
 To the many observers who support
 the Freedom Academy concept, this at-
 titude that we are not so successful as
 we might be has required no argumen-
 tative support; and, naively perhaps, we
 have thought we needed no considerable
 evidential support in contending that
 our side of the world is not prepared to
 fight in the specific arena where the.
 battle between Communist aggressors,
 and their victims is being fought.
 This arena is essentially the nonmili-
 tary or only quasi-military arena.  We
 Americans, who exhibit pride in our his-
 toric guerrilla-type warfare capabilities
 which we demonstrated so effectively
 during the French and Indian War, our
 American Revolution, and the conquest
 of the West, inherit from our ancestors
 a contempt for militarists like Braddock
 who refused to recognize the impotence
 of  continental-type  enemies , against
 backwoods guerrilla bands, now find
 ourselves the ones who send million dol-
 lar Jet aircraft armed with thousand-
 pound bombs against an ephemeral
 enemy whose operational capacities are
 ;so adroit that he may well not be there
 when the bomb arrives.
 But the guerrilla game has gained
 sophistication, too, since we left it.  Its
 political side is far more thorough now.
 Psychological  warfare  is          mounted
 against a people by their enemies from
 within to soften their resistance to the
 more tangible guerrilla or quasi-military
 operation conducted in conjunction' with
 it at the later stages of attack.
 And we seem to stand by,' wringing
 our hands, wondering what is going on
 as we see the will to resist among an
 ally's people wafting away like so much
 smoke.
 The L. L. Sulzberger column in Wed-
 nesday's New York Times testifies to
 our need for the Freedom Academy.
 Listen to some poignant observations
 from this gifted observer of foreign
 affairs.              '
 American defense plans, during the past
 decade have carefully and expensively pre-
 pared to fight the only kind of war we are
 least likely to face.  And we have not in
 any major sense prepared to fight the kind
 of war both Russia and China surely intend
 to press.
 * * * Moscow endorsed peaceful coexist-
 ence* * * always reserved one vital area
 * * * to support wherever possible "wars
 of liberation."
 * * * The modern elaboration of guerrilla
 techniques called "revoluntionary warfare"
 by the Communists does not depend on
 heavy weapons or atomic arsenals.  It de-
 pends upon simultaneous organization of-
 partisan units and civilian administrators
 who seek to rot a selected country from
 within like fungus inside an apparently
 healthy tree.
 * * * Even today, when we have growing
 special service counterguerrilla units, some
 with kindergarten Italning in revolutionary
 warfare, we are absymally behind.'
 * * * we have nothing capable of off-
 .setting what  revolutionary  warfare  calls
 "parallel hierarchies" * *-the secret politi-
 cal apparatus that undermines morale and
 softens up the population.
 * * * while we  are  engaged in blue-
 printing superplanes and superrockets, we
 risk losing the world to guerrillas.
 * * * The quintessential problem is how
 to defeat revolutionary warfare * *
 Not merely the aggressive Chinese but the
 relatively less aggressive Russians are com-
 mitted  to sponsor  "wars  of  liberation."
 Despite this glaring truth, both in weapon?
 and in training we are basically prepared
 alone for the war our adversaires don't

 FOREIGN AFFAIRS: ONE KIND OF WAR WE CAN'T
 FIGHT
 (By C. L. Sulzberger)
 PARIS.-Some wars become associated with
 the names of individuals, and thus we have
 the Napoleonic Wars, the Black Hawk War
 and the War of Jenkins' Ear.  There have
 been those who have sought to label the
 Vietnamese  campaign  "McNamara's  war,"
 after the U.B. Secretary of Defense and, poli-
 tics aside, this is not wholly unjust.

 March 4, 1965   CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD-SENATE        (p. 4059)
 M'NAMABA's INFLUENCE
 For Secretary McNamara has clearly had
 more influence in our evolving Vietnam pol-
 icy than his senior colleague, Secretary Rusk.
 McNamara has been a familiar Saigon visitor;
 his former military right hand, General Tay-
 lor, Is now Ambasador there, and United
 States-Indochina strategy is more heavily
 marked by the Pentagon than by the State
 Department.
 American defense plans during the past
 decade have carefully and expensively pre-
 pared to fight the only kind of war we are
 least likely to face.  And we have not in any
 major sense prepared to fight the kind of
 war both Russia and China surely intend to
 press.
 When                   poet-Stalinist  Moscow  endorsed
 peaceful coexistence it always reserved one
 vital area.  It openly promised to support,
 wherever possible, what it calls "ware of lib-
 eration."                                                         Khrushchev tried to play a trick
 on us In Cuba, but he had to back down be-
 cause he was patently not engaged in a lib-
 eration war--only in directly threatening our
 vital interests.  Our strategy was prepared
 for such a showdown.
 However, when the Communists stick to
 their own rules they have a demonstrated ad-
 vantage.  The modern elaboration of guer-
 rilla techniques called "revolutionary war-
 (are" by the Communists does not depend on
 heavy weapons, or atomic arsenals.  It de-
 pends upon simultaneous organization of
 partisan units and civilian administrators
 who seek to rot a selected country from
 within like fungus inside an apparently
 healthy tree.
 For years we refused to face the fact that,
 equipped as we were for holocaust, we had
 neither the trained manpower nor the polit-
 ical apparatus to tight revolutionary war-
 fare. To some degree. under both President
 Kennedy and the brilliant McNamara, this
 was rectified-but only in part. Even today,
 when  we  have  growing  special  service
 counterguerrilla units, some with kinder-
 garten training In revolutionary warfare, we
 are abysmally behind.
 It is expensive and Ineffectual to blow up
 jungle acreage or fill It with paratroopers In
 search of vanishing guerrillas. And we have
 nothing capable of offsetting what revolu-
 tionary warfare  calls parallel  hierarchies
 (know in Vietnam as Dich-Van) the secret
 political apparatus that undermines morale
 and softens up the population.
 SHIFTING STRATEGY
 U.S. strategy tends to shift according to
 availability of  weapons systems.  It has
 moved from massive retaliation to flexible
 response and from land bases to seaborne
 armadas. But, while we are engaged in blue-
 printing superplanes and superrockets, we
 risk. losing the world to guerrillas.
 Vietnam is McNamara's war because, in
 fighting it, we have overstressed the mili-
 tary and ignored the political aspect.  We
 have, furthermore, been preoccupied with
 selling an American way of life and political
 philosophy unsuited to the people we would
 help.
 FACING  THE THREAT
 The heart ofthe crisis is not truly in Viet-
 nam.  The quintessential problem is how to
 defeat revolutionary warfare.  Elsewhere in
 Asia and Africa we will continue to face the
 threat of this technique no matter what hap-
 pens to the Vietnamese. That Is Inescapable.
 Not merely the aggressive Chinese but the
 relatively less aggressive Russians are com-
 mitted to sponsor wars of liberation.  Despite
 this glaring truth, both in weapons and in
 training, we axe basically prepared alone for
 the war our adversaries don't Intend to start.
 Mr. MU DT.  A nucleus proposal of
 the Freedom Academy bill (8. 1232)
 which I Introduced In this session of the
 Senate  together with the  following
 sponsors: Senators CASE, DODD, DOUGLAS,
 FONG, HICKENLOOPER, LAUSCHL, MILLER,
 PROUTY. PROXNaRE, SCOTT, and SnzArHERS,
 is that the U.S. Government should di-
 rect priority attention to providing ade-
 quate training for our own people and
 for our allies' people in this crucial area
 of  nonmilitary-psychological  warfare
 aggression.
 We propose to prepare our people who
 face this test in the field to recognize
 nonmilitary aggression for what it is In
 all Its variable forms. We propose to en-
 able them to adopt appropriate counter-
 techniques and counterstrategies against
 such aggression.
 Maintaining that our people should be
 so prepared Is not tantamount to urging
 our adoption of Communist tactics. But
 we can better meet this challenge if we
 know what the challenge is all about and
 have in hand a complete understanding
 of the most effective and appropriate
 methods which we can employ for ad-
 vancing freedoms cause.

 Mr.  MUNDT.  Mr.  President,  last
 week I spoke of the need to enact some-
 thing like the Freedom Academy bill so
 that our people working in foreign
 relations might be better prepared to
 .understand techniques of nonmilitary
 aggression in its incipient stages when
 appropriate - counteraction would more
 -effectively enervate the aggressors, more
 effectively isolate them from potential
 success.
 Today I would like to consider briefly
 another function proposed for the Free-
 dom Academy, intensive training of for-
 eign nationals.  We would bring serv-
 ants of friendly governments to this
 country, persons asking for the training.
 and teach them how Communists and
 other practitioners of nonmilitary ag-
 gression undercut independent govern-
 ments which they have targeted for de-
 struction.

 It goes:
 DEAR MR.        : I was very much im-

 Even though I could not wholly agree with
 what you say, I do realize that the most

 Here. I interject to say that the Free-
 dom Academy bill does not propose to
 mimic Communist violence. We propose
 to study Communist methods to under-
 stand them and to arm the people upon

 intensive research into the methods of
 nonmilitary aggression, into methods of

 with that, and concurrent training to
 disseminate findings, knowledge, and
 awareness - sophistication - accumu-
 lating from this research.
 The free world needs such an institu-
 tion. Let me read a letter symptomatic
 of the need.  Addressed to a respected
 Washington journalist, whom I will not
 identify, the letter is signed by a foreign
 citizen who is studying in this country.
 I will not identify the nationality ofd
 the writer, respecting his request.
 The letter is dated February 15, 1965.
 I thank you beforehand and God bless you.
 The journalist attached this note:
 Senator MUNDT, now what can we do with
 a letter like this?
 Right now my journalist friend can do
 nothing with the letter except write more
 articles.  And about all I can do is talk
 to the Senate. Our Government affords
 remarkably little in the way of political
 training for this man. Probably at least
 part of the cost for his medical train-
 ing is borne by our Government, but we
 refuse to recognize his coexistent need
 for realistic political education.
 This week's press supplies further cur-
 rent evidence that the need I am dis-
 cussing is real.  It exists.  It Is not a
 bogey in the mind of professional anti-
 Communists. It is as real as anything in
 the political sphere.

 The Lloyd Garrison story In the New
 York Times of March 9, datelined Braz-
 zaville, the Congo Republic-across the
 river from Leopoldville In the Republic
 of the Congo-is :fully pertinent.
 Garrison writes:
 The youths came in about 20 minutes after
 midnight.  They wore khaki shorts and Chi-
 nese peaked caps with a red star on a black
 shield.  [They were) ? ' ? recognized * ' ?
 as members of the Jeunesse, the militant
 arm of the National Revolutionary Move-
 ment, the sole legal party In this country,
 the former French Congo.
 One group broke down the door of the
 home of Joseph Pouabou, President of the
 Supreme  Court.  The  youths    pummeled
 (him)  into submission. Then  they beat
 Mrs. Pouabou and her children and dragged
 Mr. Pouabou unconscious to one of three
 waiting cars.
 [The] ' ? * Scene [was]    ?    repeated

 eral * ? ? and ? ? ? [the] director of the
 Government's   information agency.  Both
 were found dead 2 days later ? ' ?.  Mr.
 Pouabou is ? ? ? presumed dead.
 The killings took place the might of Feb-
 ruary 16  (the date of the letter I read
 earlier).
 They marked the climax of a campaign to
 seize total control over the Government of
 moderate Socialists.  One French observer
 here described the seizure of power as "a
 classic Communist-.style takeover."
 With guidance from Peiping's Zmbassy
 here, the radicals at first appeared content to
 play a minority role In a Government that
 the  moderates  hoped  would reflect  "all
 shades of national opinion."
 But when delegates assembled to form a
 broadly based one-party system, they found
 themselves outmaneuvered and outvoted.
 Communists came to dominate the party's
 policymaking body, formerly known as the
 Political Bureau and as the Politburo.  In
 quick succession, the Politburo decreed the
 establishment of one trade union, one youth
 group, one women's organization ? ? ?.

 A classic Communist-style takeover.
 How much better If we could provide our
 willing and independent friends with un-
 derstanding of what constitutes a classic
 takeover, what must precede It, what the
 tactics and techniques of takeover are.
 Garrison's dispatch was continued in
 the New York Times of March 10:
 The Chinese Communists are the dominant
 diplomatic force beyond this country's "sci-
 entific Socialist" regime.  Many widely held
 assumptions about how they operate have
 proved false.

 local beer, dance the cha cha, and mix with

 Africans End It Impossible to strike up
 friendships with the Chinese.
 Garrison notes, too, that China is quick
 to provide well-directed aid.  For ex-
 ample, they have provided $20 million
 to set up "Chinese-run small industries."
 Excellent vehicles for further infiltra-
 tion. He concludes:
 The most informed concensus Is that the
 Chinese will go only as far as Is necessary
 to insure that the regime continues to be
 virulently anti-Western and affords them a
 secure base for subversion in the biggest
 prize  of  all-the  former  Belgian  Congo,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE (pp. 4751-4753)
 First came a $5 million loan to help bal-
 ance lest year's budget.  Recently the gov-
 ernment has accepted a $20 million loan foi
 setting up Chinese-run small  industries.
 Each loan is interest free, with 10 years' grace
 on repayment.
 The Soviet Union has offered an $8 million
 agreement for financing, at 2.6 percent in-
 terest, such long-term, prestige projects as
 a luxury hotel and a hydroelectric dam that
 the Americans turned down as economically
 unfeasible.
 What are Peiping's objectives?
 Moat Western experts doubt that the Chi-
 nese want to replace the French here com-
 pletely.  The Congo is a poor small country,
 and to assume the major responsibility for
 aid and budget subsidies would prove ex-
 tremely expensive.
 The most Informed consensus is that the
 Chinese will go only pa far as is necessary to
 insure that the regime continues to be viru-
 lently anti-Western and affords them a se-
 cure base for subversion In the biggest prize
 of all-the former Belgian Congo, which lies
 just across the Congo River.
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, tech-
 niques of takeover appear quite diverse.
 For example, I read from a recent United
 Press International dispatch:
 Punta, PERU, February 20.-A report pub-
 lished here today Indicated Latin American
 ,'volunteers" trained In Cuba are fighting on
 the Communist aide In South Vietnam.
 The family of Julian Jimenez Ochoa, a
 young Peruvian who went to Cuba for guer-
 rilla training, has been notified unofficially
 of his death in battle In Vietnam.
 The report of Jimenez's death was con-
 tained in a letter purported to come from
 other young Peruvians who were serving with
 the Reds in South Vietnam.
 One must wonder what the future
 holds for these young Latin American
 fighters for communism. They will likely
 utilize these skills in their homelands.
 Hopefully, non-Communists in Latin
 America will have timely opportunity to
 prepare themselves for confrontation
 with experienced guerrillas.
 But although techniques of takeover
 are diverse, as with all else in human
 relations, there must be identifiable pat-
 terns in them.
 We should identify these patterns and
 lay them open to full comprehension.
 More important, we should make this
 knowledge available to persons who can
 use it to defend their own countries'
 sovereignty and, in so doing, to contri-
 bute to our own defense.
 We have here a mutual interest.

 Mr. Jordan identifies what he considers
 our outstanding need:
 What Is needed is an organic system of
 political communication. ? ? ? By organic, as
 opposed to inert, we mean a system in which
 the operating methods and even the orga-
 nizational structure are determined by the
 ideas to be propagated.
 The organic approach would begin with the
 selection of Ideas.  The next step would be
 to find people who believe these Ideas firmly
 enough to Impart their conviction to others.
 People who believe in the values we try
 to propagate.  Are there people who
 really believe In American values?-
 Some object that "convinced political com-
 municators" will be bard to find; If thane
 true, then it would seem that American Ideas
 are hardly worth propagating abroad and we
 face eventual defeat on the Ideological level.
 There are many such people among
 us; but government officials do not make
 good communicators of this kind.  The
 reasons are obvious.  Because of their
 very association with government, offi-
 cials cannot effectively propagate a po-
 litical philosophy among a people alien
 to it:
 The model for successful political com-
 munication is to be found  ?  ? ? In the
 Ing for private individuals.  The United
 States sends hundreds of thousands of
 its private citizens to reside abroad.  A
 great many believe fervently in our in-
 stitutions.  All that is needed to make of
 them a very effective force for propaga-
 tion of our beliefs is to let them know
 how and where they can be politically
 influential.
 Mr. Jordan offers examples of the po-
 tential Impact of such individuals acting
 independently of the Government.
 A typical example ?  ? ? Is the Center for
 Christian Democratic Action In New York,
 Which endeavors to promote Christian de-

 but it is one which we refuse to utilize
 in present-day foreign relations.  Ac-
 cording to Mr. Jordan:
 We would commit a major error if we
 tried to use Communist methods in reverse,
 merely substituting white for black and vice
 versa.  The use of entirely original methods,
 reflecting the character and way of life of
 the United States, would place the Commu-
 nists on the defensive.
 It is now time for us to bring our real
 strength up to the firing line in this new
 day of determined and deliberate non-
 military warfare.  It is time to call up'
 strong reserves. We should no longer
 rely on skeleton forces delegated to per-
 form a job which requires our best effort
 if we are going to win.
 I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
 ticle entitled "Political Communication:
 The  Third Dimension  of  Strategy,'
 written by Alexander T. Jordan,. and pub-
 lished In the fall, 1964, issue of the Uni-
 versity of Pennsylvania's journal of for-
 eign affairs, Orbis, be printed in the
 RECORD following my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 POLITICAL COMMUNICATION:  THE THIRD
 DIMENSION OF STRATEGY
 (By Alexander Jordan)
 Military power and diplomacy comprise
 the two conventional dimensions of strategy,
 and economic action is sometimes called the
 "third arm of statecraft." i  By the third
 dimension in this article, however, we mean
 all efforts, not confined to dealings between
 governments,  to  influence   foreign  audi-
 ences-whether we call it propaganda, po-
 litical communication or psychological war-
 fare. While less easily defined than the other
 two, this third sphere of strategy is recog-
 nized  by political  scientists-though                                                 not
 always by politicians-as equal to them in
 importance.
 American weakness in this third dimen-
 sion is deplored by writers on the subject.
 "It is my personal belief that Russia is a good
 generation ahead of us in her understanding
 of propaganda and in her skill in using it,"
 wrote George Gallup .2  Murray Dyer has
 commented: "In Russian hands the phycho-
 logical instrument has been used with con-
 summate skill and no little success. It seems
 to be generally admitted that in our own
 hands both the skill and the success have
 been more limited." ?  Another writer noted:
 "The psychological warfare of the West is
 waged almost exclusively by, America, or at
 least with American money; however, it is
 unsuccessful." +  Arthur Krock, New York
 Times columnist, entitled one of his articles
 on this subject "Why We Are Losing the
 Psychological War."   Books such as "The
 Propaganda Gap," "The Weapon on the Wall"
 and "The Idea Invaders" contain critiques of
 the U.S.  psychological warfare effort by
 Americans dismayed to see their country sec-
 ond best in a field which they regard as vital e
 The purpose of this article is not to criti-
 cize the current U.S. program in psychologi-
 cal warfare, although some reference will be
 made to its shortcomings.  Rather, we will
 examine at some length one major aspect of
 the psychological arm of strategy, namely,
 long-range ideological conversion, and rec-
 ommend introducing into the overall U.S.
 effort an "organic system of political com-
 munication" which places more emphasis
 on the role of private, i.e., nongovernmental.
 institutions.
 THE NEED TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON TECHNIQUES
 In the many studies devoted to the subject
 of psychological warfare, major attention has
 generally been focused on broad lines of
 policy and on the status of pertinent gov-
 ernment agencies. Little attention has been
 given to the actual operating procedures and
 techniques. "The history of this instrument,
 roughly for the past 25 years, shows very
 clearly that a great deal of effort has been
 expended on who should control it, i.e., De-
 partment of Defense or State.  By compari-
 son relatively little effort has been spent on
 what the instrument ought to be doing and
 what its main job was.' 17   In othc- words,
 there has been much concern with what
 should be said and who is to be in charge of
 saying it, but little thought as to the tech-
 nique of conveying the message to its target.

 This omission would seem to imply that
 the critics consider the current techniques
 satisfactory.  If that were Indeed the case,
 victory in the battle for the minds of men
 could be achieved by finding the right mes-
 sage and then leaving its transmission to an
 agency with an adequate budget and a proper
 status within the structure of government .4
 This Is. of course, a dangerous oversimplifica-
 tion.  For while it is obvious that the scale
 of operations of the third arm of strategy
 must be substantially Increased before a
 proper balance among the three instruments
 can be attained, there is an even greater need
 for a major revision of thinking on the
 subject.
 Nothing less than a systemic revolution in
 the field of Western political communication
 can turn the tide of battle in the war for the
 minds of men.  The assertion that the out-
 come of that war, rather than the outcome of
 one fought with nuclear weapons, will deter-
 mine the fate of the United States and of
 Western civilization Is almost a cliche of
 political writing and speechmaking.  Yet lit-
 tle is done to forge new weapons and develop
 new techniques which will give us a chance
 to win the psychological war.
 Even some of the most vehement advo-
 cates of a "psychological offensive" seem to
 think that the only weaknesses of present
 USIA (U.S. Information Agency}  activities
 fie in their limited scope and insumctent co-
 ordination with the other branches of gov-
 ernment.  Hence they conclude that an in-
 creased budget and a direct line to the White
 House would solve the problem.  Such an
 oversimplified view suggests a failure to dif-
 ferentiate properly between various types of
 political communication.  Military power-
 the first instrument of strategy-includes
 air, naval and land forces, which are not
 Identical either in their character. deploy-
 ment or operations.  The various classifica-
 tions  of  political  communication  differ
 among themselves at least as much as the
 Strategic Air Command differs from the
 Coast Guard. Each requires a different ap-
 proach, different  techniques and different
 organizational structures.  There Is a tend-
 ency to overlook this fact and to demand
 simply more propaganda, without specifying
 the type required.
 The customary  subdivision  of political
 communication Into strategic and tactical
 categories is not an adequate guide for fash-
 ioning Instruments of psychological warfare.
 @ The Idea that world opinion can be won
 over merely by spending more money and ap-
 pointing a new Cabinet officer is similar to the
 suggestion that the problem of cancer could
 be solved in a few years by a crash program
 with a multi-billion-dollar budget.  Scien-
 tists point out, however, that the solution to
 the cancer problem is a matter of brains
 rather than funds, that all the qualified re-
 searchers are already at work, and that their
 number could not be rapidly Increased at any
 cost. In both these suggestions we are faced
 with a mechanistic outlook, inclined to sub-
 stitute money for creative Insights.
 There is also an important dividing line be-
 tween ideological conversion and all activ-
 ity-both strategic and tactical-aimed at
 securing "relevant political action." The two
 fields inevitably overlap, but U.B. shortcom-
 ings lie particularly in the area of long-
 range ideological change.  While less imme-
 diate in its effects, ideological conversion
 provides the Indispensable infrastructure for
 strategic and tactical action toward specific
 objectives.  The strength of Soviet political
 communication is precisely in this sphere,
 while in the medium-range and tactical fields
 the disparity between East and West is not
 as striking.
 In advocating an enlarged U.S. effort, most
 writers fail to distinguish between these dif-
 ferent types of endeavor and simply recom-
 mend Increasing the budget of the USIA and
 enlisting advertising talents in the campaign
 of "selling America to the world."  This
 might be a valid approach in dealing with
 political communication at the level of "rele-
 vant political action," but It falls far short of
 what is needed to bolster U.B. efforts at long-
 range strategic conversion. Much more basic
 changes are necessary in methods of action,
 organizational structure and operating pro-
 cedures if we are to reverse the trend and
 strengthen the third Instrument of foreign
 policy.
 AN ORGANIC SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATION
 Nature of an organic system: What is
 needed is an organic system of political com-
 munication serving as a means of long-range
 conversion and cooperating with existing
 strategic and tactical psychological opera-
 tions.  By organic, as opposed to inert, we
 mean a system in which the operating meth-
 ods and even the organizational structure
 are determined by the Ideas to be propagated.
 Organic communication systems are as old
 as the great religious faiths which, In their
 earlier stages at least, were seldom propa-
 gated by Inert, bureaucratic methods.  The
 Innovation suggested here consists in con-
 sciously promoting the organic features of a
 communication system at the expense of the
 inert ones.  That has certainly not been
 done by any Western government!
 An organic communication system would
 differ basically from a conventiIIe In

 tional approach starts with the appointment
 of an administrative staff, which then hires
 professional communicators and seeks Ideas
 to propagate.  The organic approach would

 noted that: "The private sector must know
 how it can participate In the global struggle
 in  a   sustained  and  systematic  manner.
 There exists In the private sector a huge res-
 ervoir of talent, ingenuity, and strength
 which can be developed and brought to bear

 begin with the selection of ideas.  The next
 step would be to find people who believe
 these ideas firmly enough to impart their.
 conviction to others.  Some may be trained
 communicators and others not, but it is
 easier to impart communications skills than
 intensity of belief-especially since profes-
 sional communicators, by the nature of their
 calling, often tend to develop an attitude of
 doubt or even cynicism.  Once assembled,
 a team of dedicated persons should be given
 a fairly free hand in propagating its idea,
 and should be given such technical assist-
 ance as it may require.                                                   Far more mental
 energy would be released by such a method
 than could ever be delivered by a conven-
 tional organization working for the same
 objectives.
 The importance of conviction: The model
 for successful political communication is to
 be found not in the dull bulletins of gov-
 ernments, nor in the flamboyant prose of
 copywriters, but in the patient labors and
 intense convictions of missionaries of reli-
 gious and political faiths-from Saint Paul
 to  Lenin.  An  organization  dedicated  to
 spreading  its  ideas  among  others should
 start with a group of passionate believers.10
 There are thousands of people in the United
 States who believe fervently in ideas which.
 if adopted in other countries, could serve
 the long-range interests of national policy.
 These  individuals  would  not  make  good
 diplomats or information-officers, but they
 could make excellent propagandists,   The
 most urgent need of the third arm of strat-
 egy is to utilize the spiritual energy of such
 people, while guiding and assisting them in
 accordance with national policy. No attempt
 should be made, however, to try to make
 their activity merely a carbon copy of current
 tactical and medium-range policies.
 The importance of what might be called
 the conviction coefficient has been demon-
 strated by many propaganda campaigns of
 the past.  In the period between the two
 World Wars several Central European nations
 engaged in strenuous- political communica-
 tion efforts, directed largely against one an-
 other.  Although their objectives are now ir-
 relevant, these efforts merit our attention
 because of their success in proportion to the
 means used.  The budgets and the numbers
 of personnel employed were but a minute
 fraction of those now at the disposal of the
 USIA;  yet the worldwide effectiveness of
 their persuasive efforts was impressive. This
 is attributable not to the Central Europeans'
 superior knowledge of communication tech-
 niques, but rather to their firm convict-ion
 of the  righteousness  of their respective
 causes. Armed  with    such  conviction,  a
 single agent working from his apartment in
 a  foreign  city may sometimes   achieve  a
 10 This is one of the reason why civil serv-
 ants are generally inappropriate for this pur-
 pose: they may be passionate believers, but
 their first allegiance is to official policies;
 they are not free to act in accordance with
 the intensity of their convictions.
 greater impact on the public opinion of the
 country than can a large government infor-
 mation office.' Even tiny Lithuania managed
 to make the West aware of her claims to
 Vilno, while the. Ukrainians-though with-
 out a state of their own-conducted active
 propaganda campaigns in Western Europe
 and in the United States.  The results of
 these endeavors, while perhaps not signifi-
 cant in terms of "relevant political action,"
 were quite impressive in relation to the puny
 resources committed.
 These cases illustrate one of the basic
 principles of an organic communication sys-
 tem: the communicator's intensity of con-
 viction is the critical factor in his effective-
 ness (persuasiveness).  The objective value
 of the propositions advocated is compara-
 tively irrelevant, particularly as it is not
 susceptible to any scientific measurement.
 Government agencies and the organic sys-
 tem: There is another important reason for
 recommending an organic communication
 system-not as a substitute for the existing
 one, but as a coequal auxiliary.  If political
 communication activities are to be expanded
 in volume-as they must be if we are to
 achieve substantial results-that expansion
 should not simply take the form of a bigger
 and  better  government agency.  A huge
 ministry of propaganda would be both in-
 adequate and undesirable.  Such a central-
 ized agency might be a suitable instrument
 for spreading a dogmatic and codified doc-
 trine.  In this sense Dr. Goebbels' Propa-
 gandaministerium  was  an  organic  body,
 since its structure and discipline reflected
 the character of the Nazi movement. But
 when the subject of communication is to be
 a vast body of thought which might be de-
 scribed, for want of a better term, as "the
 philosophy of Western civilization," the use
 of a huge centralized bureaucracy for its
 propagation would constitute a basic contra-
 diction.  Any attempt to spread an essen-
 tially pluralistic culture  though a single
 agency of one government would be a denial
 of the very philosophy we are advocating, as
 well as a psychological blunder.  It would
 be a violation of the principles of organic
 communication.
 Vast expansion of the USIA to handle
 these new activities would place an undesir-
 able official stamp on them.  Moreover, po-
 litical action in the field requires personal
 initiative and a readiness for risk taking
 which are not characteristics commonly as-
 sociated with bureaucracies. That is why in-
 creasing the budget of the USIA many times
 over and giving its Director equal status with
 the Secretary of State would not solve the
 real problem of bringing the third arm of
 strategy up to full strength.
 Effective political action, especially in the
 long-range strategic sphere, must take the
 form of advocacy.  Mere distribution of in-
 formation, even selected and slanted, is not
 enough.  "From this view of the nature of

 foreign policy, and of the psychological in-
 strument of statecraft," one commentator
 has noted, "it follows that the 'information'
 approach to psychological operations Is woe-
 fully insufficient." "                                  The tactical and me-
 dium-range activities of the USIA should be
 continued and even expanded, but they can
 never substitute for true political action of
 a more basic nature. In any case, no Gov-
 ernment agency can openly engage in politi-
 cal action abroad; international law is ex-
 plicit in prohibiting such activity by gov-
 ernments.'
 The inappropriateness of advertising tech-
 niques: The other standard suggestion for
 strengthening U.B. psychological operations,
 that we use advertising techniques In selling
 our political philosophy to other nations, Is
 potentially even more harmful and reflects a
 profound misunderstanding of the whole
 Issue.  Because commercial advertising bears
 some    superficial  resemblance  to  political
 communication, its practitioners conclude
 that the two are interchangeable.           The dif-
 ferences between them, however, are more
 significant than their similarities.   Further-
 more, the cost of using advertising tech-
 niques on a world scale would be prohibitive.
 and high-pressure campaigns might          well
 evoke  adverse  reactions.  This       approach
 would be the least organic of all.      "Adver-
 tising men  have  their function-on the
 American scene  and  Inside the American
 economy.   But the world situation calls for
 a totally different type of professionals.  Po-
 litical propaganda, a task of extraordinary
 complexity, requires intellectuals, scholars,
 specialists, and-in the final analysis-polit-
 ieal philosophers." U
 SOME ADVANTAGES OF THE ORGANIC SYSTEM
 In summing up the shortcomings of the
 U.S. effort in the field of political communi-
 cation, John B. Whitton points to:  (1) the
 lack of clear objectives; (2) the lack of con-
 fidence in our efforts; and (3) the purely
 defensive character  of  our efforta.'+  Al-
 though Whitton was referring to the entire
 communication effort, his observations are
 particularly applicable to long-range  ideo-
 logical conversion.  All three areas of weak-
 ness could be bolstered by a program of or-
 ganic communication, based on the better
 utilization of existing intellectual and spir-
 itual resources.
 The causes for these major areas of weak-
 ness are not difficult to find.  The first is
 related to the commonly heard argument
 that we have no single great idea to sell,

 litical Communication," in "Propaganda and
 the Cold War," op. cit.

 War," op. cit.
 hence our efforts tend to be reactive and de-
 fensive.  "Our policy has been too negative,
 its programs and slogans almost always a
 mere response, or reaction, to the more imag-
 inative Initiatives of the Soviets.  Hence, it
 is claimed, we have been unable to provide
 for the West the inspiration and leadership
 the  situation  demands  and  our  great
 strength warrants." u  Furthermore, In a de-
 mocracy, a governmental propaganda strat-

 these might offend certain sections of domes-
 tic political opinion.                                                                                        Official objectives must
 be phrased In a manner acceptable to all
 domestic political factions, and as a result
 they often become so watered down that
 they lose their attraction for the peoples of
 other cultures.
 These are all very real obstacles.  While
 one may argue that freedom and democracy
 are ideas or ideologies that can be articu-
 lated and packaged for distribution abroad,
 these concepts often appear vague and ir-
 relevant to the target audience.  One solu-
 tion is to give these Ideas more concrete form
 through person-to-person contact: this be-
 comes the task of the private political com-
 municator.  While he must serve the Inter-
 ests of national policy formulated by the
 President, the political communicator must
 also have the freedom to interpret broad
 national policies and goals, and to go far
 beyond official statements In explaining the
 "American way of life."  Private organiza-
 tions devoted to political communicationcan
 set themselves clear objectives and, unham-
 pered by official connection with the Gov-
 ernment, they can afford to be more candid
 In pursuing these objectives than can our
 public servants.
 The lack of confidence in our efforts,
 which Whitton lists as the second failing,
 is this largely to the absence of clear objec-
 tives and the limited achievements to date
 of the American propaganda effort.  If a
 private political communication organization
 were permitted to establish its own objec-
 tives, select its own method of operation
 and subdivide the overall task Into a num-
 ber of separate  endeavors,  this  obstacle
 might not seem so formidable.  A private
 association, selecting a limited number of
 targets in a specific territory, would be more
 likely to give Its members a tangible sense
 of  accomplishment  than  a government
 agency which endeavors to do everything
 everywhere and thereby dilutes Its efforts to
 the-point where they become largely ineffec-
 tive.  Unlike civil servants Inhibited by their
 official responsibility, private communicators
 would not confine themselves to purely de-
 fensive tactics.  The morale of troops In the

 action, at this lowest In holding operations.

 difference, as in optics, IS in employing a
 method of transmission which avoids ex-
 cessive losses.
 The importance of using a specific ap-
 proach, clearly defined both as to content
 and target area, Is particularly great when
 the amount of energy available for Input and
 the choice of objectives are limited.  One of
 the major shortcomings of advertising tech-
 niques when applied to political persuasion
 to the relatively indiscriminate character of
 their appeal.  The number of potential pur-
 chasers of amp or cigarettes may almost co-
 incide with the total population, but the
 number of persona wielding political Influ-
 ence does not.  That is why the use of mass
 appeal in foreign action is doubly mis-
 directed; it seldom affects the majority and
 Is likely to miss the vital minority.
 A specialized organization with clearly de-
 fined  and    limited  objectives  is  better
 equipped to reach Its particular target-
 those persons who are likely to be receptive
 to the ideas which it propagates.  Such an
 approach may result ultimately in the estab-
 lishment of close links between groups of
 people in different countries. Societies for
 international friendship in general founder
 in a flood of pious declarations and cliches.
 Associations for friendship between two na-
 tions sometimes do better, though they also
 tend to specialize In platitudes and lofty
 speechmaking.  But associations devoted to
 promoting cooperation and friendly relations
 between two nations in a specific field of
 thought or action are more likely to achieve
 tangible results. If they exist In sufficient
 numbers, such operational and binational
 organizations can accomplish, cumulatively,
 far more than worldwide associations dedi-
 cated to furthering the brotherhood of man.
 If a small proportion of the economic aid
 now given to foreign governments were chan-
 neled through such bodies,  the political
 effectiveness of U.S. aid programs would be
 vastly increased.
 An organic communication system would
 foster the establishment of a greater num-
 ber of such specific links between well-
 defined groups in different countries.  As in
 an atomic pile where no chain reaction oc-
 curs until the number of neutrons emitted
 reaches a critical level, so In a target area
 undergoing psychological penetration the re-
 action will not become self-sustaining until
 the paths of the diverse and apparently ran-
 dom messages begin to intersect each other
 in sufficient numbers.  In the absence of
 mathematical  formulas dealing  with the
 prerequisites for a psychopolitical chain re-
 action, we have to rely on empirical observa-
 tion and a study of recorded cases.  It is
 clear, however, that by whatever method we
 might measure it, the political radiation we
 are now emitting is far from the level neces-
 sary forstarting a chain reaction.
 USE OF EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS AND
 PUBLICATIONS
 Organizations carrying out programs com-
 patible with an organic communication eys-
 tem already exist, but the scale of their activ-
 ities is too limited for an accurate evaluation
 of results.  Furthermore, they now operate
 on a random, ad hoc basis; within the frame-
 work of an organic system they would be
 given specific missions.
 A typical example of such an organization
 Is the Center for Christian Democratic Ac-
 tion In New York. which endeavors to pro-
 mote Christian Democracy In Latin America.
 It is a private body, staffed by Americans,
 Europeans and Latin Americans, and enjoy-
 ing some support from American founda-
 tlons.  Christian Democracy has the advan-
 tage of being a genuine ideology with a posi-
 tive content, rather than merely a reaction
 against communism. It did not originate in
 the United States, and is therefore free from
 association with "Yanqui Imperialism," but
 it has behind it the authority of strong par-
 ties In Western Europe. It also has the sup-
 port of Important sections of public opinion
 in Latin America.  Support given to Chris-
 tian Democracy in Latin America may pro-
 vide a better antidote to communism than
 some openly pro-American activities.  This
 does not mean, however, that other deserving
 movements should not also be encouraged.
 If only one party were supported, it would
 soon be labeled the "pro-American party,"
 with all the adverse consequences of such a
 designation. One of the weaknesses of a gov-
 ernment agency is that Its rigid policy lines
 and its official character may make it difficult
 to back simultaneously several movements
 competitive with each other.  Yet such ap-
 parent inconsistency might be the wisest
 course in some situations.
 American labor organizations have already
 entered the international field, endeavoring
 to              promote  their  ideology.   One  could
 imagine the National Association of Manu-
 facturers doing the same for the philosophy
 of free enterprise, the American Bar Asso-
 ciation for the rule of law, the American
 Legion for cooperation with veterans, and so
 on.  The fact that the activities of these
 private bodies might be overlapping and even
 to some extent contradictory would not de-
 tract from their effectiveness.  On the con-
 trary, the variety of viewpoints would reflect
 the pluralistic  nature  of  a free society,
 while the consensus of all on basic issues
 would illustrate the possibility of combining
 free  expression   with  national  solidarity.
 Such an approach, diametrically opposed to
 the monolithic Communist method, would
 convey  the    American  message   not  only
 through its actual content, but also through
 the manner of Its communication.
 The director of an organic communication
 system would use specific ideological pro-
 grams, selected for their force of penetration
 as well as their content, to create a mental
 picture even as an artist uses pigments to
 create a painting.  Inevitably, such a picture
 would become meaningful only In the overall
 perspective.  Its pattern would then emerge
 from the apparently jumbled juxtaposition
 of colors.  Conventional communication, on

 that  International communication  at the
 long-range ideological level should not be
 a function only of the Federal Government,
 suitable ways and means of supporting it
 will evolve, and the Government will still
 have a large measure of control over the
 recipients of such support.
 An organic communication system such as
 the one roughly sketched here is, by Its very
 nature, incompatible with crash programs.
 It has to be built up gradually, starting in
 the case of each project with an idea or a
 definite objective, not with a readymade
 organization.  Since the Individual projects.
 by reason of their specialized nature, cannot
 be very Large, the overall effect can only be
 attained by multiplying their number.
 The effectiveness of such an approach will
 not become evident until the sum of all the
 individual  endeavors  reaches  proportions
 comparable to those of official operations in
 the same sphere.      Although no accurate
 measurements are possible In this field, it
 is clear that an organic system would give
 a higher return on the investment of human
 and material resources than an inert one.
 Furthermore, the results of its operation are
 more permanent and can become self-sus-
 taining.  Any communication effort without
 a built-in capacity for self-propagation Is
 futile.  In this respect, the organic system
 might be compared to cloud-seeding oper-
 ations which use a few pounds of silver
 iodide to release thousands of tons of rain.
 while the conventional method resembles a
 project which sends up aircraft with tanks
 full of water to sprinkle the countryside
 with Imitation showers.

 we had a total of 7 days' hearings on the bills, which hearings will be
 regarded as a part of the record of this year.
 So far this year we have had 2 days of hearings.
 Mr. Director, what was the date of the last hearing on the Freedom
 Academy bill?
 Mr. McNAMAR,A. About 3 weeks ago. I believe it was April 1 or 2.
 I am not certain.
 Mr. ICHORD. Our first scheduled witness this morning was the ma-

 bills dealing with the Freedom Academy. It is my understanding that
 Mr. Boggs will not be able to appear this morning before the commit-

 If there be no objection that will be placed in the record of the

 (Mr. O'Connor's statement follows:)
 STATEMENT OF TILE AMERICAN LEGION BY DANIEL J. O'COIN'NOR
 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
 Inasmuch as testimony was submitted to your committee during the second
 session of the 88th Congress on similar legislation and since the position of
 The American Legion remains unchanged, we are submitting for the record the
 statement which was made last year.
 As the distinguished members of this committee know, The American Legion
 has, since its very beginning, been cognizant of the Communist menace.  In
 fact, the militancy of Americanism expressed by the founders and early organ-
 izers of the The American Legion drew such wrath from the advance guard
 of communism in this country-the Industrial Workers of the World-that the
 latter shot down, in cold blood, American Legionnaires marching In the first
 Armistice Day parade In Centralia, Washington.  That was in 1919, even as
 the young American Legion was perfecting Its organization at its first National
 Convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota, November 10-12, 1919.
 Forty-five years ago the basic tenets of communism may have been generally
 understood by a considerable portion of our population.  Today, however, the
 complexities of Communist plans and activities have grown to such proportions
 that scarcely one in a thousand Americans has a mental grasp of Communist
 machinations.  Of course, all of us, through the news media of the Nation, are
 familiar with the known Communist successes such as in Cuba, and elsewhere.
 But how to thwart communistic encroachments, before the fact, Is a problem
 which we seem unable to solve.
 While I feel certain the members of this committee recognize the long hard
 fought battle which The American Legion has waged against communism since
 the Centralia massacre, there can be no denial that there have been changes in
 the techniques of political and psychological warfare.  Centuries ago a question
 was posed to the brilliant scholar, Francis Xavier, namely : "What loth it
 profit a man If he gains the whole world and suffers the loss of his own soul?"
 Might I paraphrase that question In pointing to the tremendous armed might
 of our country, the greatest Nation on earth, and say, "What doth it profit the
 United States of America to have the greatest atomic power for both peace and
 war if the United States of America is robbed of Its own soul?"
 In the past 17 years millions have been encircled and their lives regimented
 under the yoke ofMoscow or Peiping because of a poison that has been adminis-
 tered In slow, measured, but lethal doses to humankind, In all parts of the globe.
 The Incontrovertiblebut, sad reality is that, without firing a single weapon, the
 masters of Communist propaganda have been proliferate, not only in the Far East
 but in our own hemisphere.
 There Is no committee of the Congress that has performed a greater public
 service than the House Committee on Un-American Activities in marshaling the
 various sources of Information reflecting the pattern of inflltiation, not only In
 Latin America, Panama, and Cuba, but also within the confines of our own
 geography.  There Is no task more painstaking or more difficult than the burden
 shouldered by this committee in probing the Influence of communism In our own
 society.  Your committee and staff labor under constant threat of liquidation,
 not by members of the Communist. Party alone, but by Americans who recognize
 the congressional power of Inquiry for every subject under the sun except the
 exposd of the Communist conspiracy.  What I would like you to understand
 and appreciate Is that we in The American Legion who have consistently sup-
 ported the creation of a Freedom Academy have also supported the duly con-
 stituted committees of the Congress whose findings and publications serve to
 spotlight the uncanny aggressors for the minds of men.
 In giving our wholehearted support for the creation of the Freedom Academy,
 we cannot help but emphasize that the greatest care must be exercised that this
 new beacon of liberty shall never become, In even the smallest part, a haven for
 anyone who professes a belief in our way of life and yet performs brilliantly
 for the proponents of world socialism.

 Lest you think for one moment that I have introduced a strange note amid
 splendid testimony offered to your committee during the 88th Congress, 2nd
 session, by the Honorable Hale Boggs, majority whip from Louisiana, Dr.
 Lev E. Dobriansky, Georgetown University professor, and many other distin-
 guished Americans, please understand that we in The American Legion share
 the dismay and disappointment of many who believe the cold war has achieved
 some measure of success in the United States.
 We. have also witnessed the replacement of a program dedicated to the men
 of our armed forces on Veterans Day, 1962, with comment and appraisal by a
 convicted perjurer passing judgment on the political fortunes of a man who
 served as United States Senator and Vice President of the United States.  While
 the producers of the program are not accused of having Communist sympathies,
 leftwing leanings, etc., there can be no question about the bad taste exercised
 in that decision.  Why do things like this happen?  Why was America's fighting
 man relegated to oblivion?
 What is there on the American scene which causes the cancellation of a tribute
 to the American fighting man and substitutes instead an attack on a war veteran
 who held high public office by a perjurer who is given a television podium in a
 vain effort to restore his respectability.  This is only one example of the erosion
 of patriotism.  Only last week at a private school in East Williston, Long Island,
 American boys and girls from upper middle class families refused to salute the
 flag of the United States.  No accusation is made against the faculty of the
 school, but what has happened in the fabric of American education which causes
 this debasement of our traditional salute to the flag and our love for that for
 which it stands.  Perhaps, the "cross-fertilization of ideas" pursued in a divi-
 sion of research for the private sector of our society will, in the Freedom Acad-
 emy, give some clue to the problem.
 In my experience as a lawyer who handled the Security Risk Inquiry in the
 City of New York, I feel that I can make a personal observation on this pro-
 gram that terminated about 6 years ago.  If it was shocking to learn that
 engineers and others educated in our colleges and universities had joined the
 apparatus of the Communist Party and their activities remained undetected +'or
 years, then is it not of paramount importance that the greatest possible security
 measures be taken to insure against the possibility of the Freedom Academy
 itself being infiltrated by anyone tutored by the great masters of deceit?  During
 the 2nd session of the 88th Congress Congressman Boggs pointed out quite
 properly that the work of the Freedom Academy in no way pre-empts the work
 of the FBI or the CIA.  He stated that what is intended is to "use affirmatively
 of the great reservoir of talent that we have in the United States to show what
 the free system and what a free society can do," but also remarked "I have no
 preconceived notions of how this Academy should be set up."  Concededly, how-
 ever, this is a most important corollary to the passage of this legislation, namely,
 the staffing of the Academy.
 While The American Legion is deeply concerned about the competence of
 Americans who officially represent the United States, both here and abroad, our
 support of the Freedom Academy would also embrace the area of research for
 the vast sector of Americans engaged in the war of ideas who are not on the
 public payroll.  We believe the many who are engaged in stemming the tide of
 w                Communist propaganda which has poured into this country by the ton must be
 encouraged, enlightened and strengthened.  Finally, we commend the Freedom
 Academy to your consideration.  We believe its success will be measured by its
 service to God and country in a recognition of the basic discipline and spiritual
 values which have made the United States the greatest nation on earth.
 In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I ask that the attached American Legion 1964
 Convention Resolution, No. 270, be made a part of the record, following my
 statement.  In behalf of The American Legion, and myself personally, I thank
 you for the opportunity of placing this statement in the record.

 Chairman, Committee on Un-American Activities,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIB: Permit me first to express the appreciation of our Association for
 the privilege, granted by the Honorable Richard H. Iehord, as Chairman of your
 subcommittee having under consideration the matter of a "Freedom Academy",
 to present a statement In support of that proposal, as outlined in several bills
 now under consideration by that subcommittee.
 We submitted last year a copy of a resolution in support of the "Freedom Com-
 mission Act", as adopted by our 34th National Convention in New York City on
 July 1, 1960. That resolution appears on page 1420 of the hearings held in Feb-
 ruary and in May last year.  That resolution continues to be a mandate of our
 Association, and has been re-affirmed in various succeeding national meetings
 of the organization.  In view of the different numbers of the bills now before
 you, it has seemed to us best simply to re-affirm in principle our support for legis-
 lation on this subject, as now before you.
 It was my privilege to author the original resolution of our Association on
 this subject, adopted at our National Convention held at Atlantic City, New
 Jersey, in June of 195$.  In general, the spirit and intent of that resolution is
 embodied in the bills now before you. It is our desire to have your records show
 that we. are. Still, as we were"in 1958, wholeheartedly In favor of the proposal to
 create a "Freedom Academy" along the lines set forth in the current bills.
 In our extended discussion on this subject at various national meetings it has
 become clear that there are two primary reasons for our active support of this
 legislation.  First, we are convinced that such an establishment could go far to
 correct the situation where this Nation seeks to counter professional propaganda
 and subversion by the use of sporadic and amateur efforts.  Secondly, and as
 a corollary, it seems clear to us that, until we can develop the professional skills
 which are the objective of the "Freedom Academy", we shall continue to be on
 the defensive, rather than taking the offensive in a field where the facts of the
 current world situation provide us ample support for an intelligently directed
 "cold war" offensive. We feel that it is only by this means that we can substitute

 positive action in this field for the belated and ineffectual reaction which has
 been our only response thus far to the continuing Communist initiative in mat-
 ters of propaganda and subversion.
 We have listened with keen interest to the hearings conducted by your sub-
 committee, and in particular to the very scholarly and well documented state-
 ments made of late by Senator Mundt. We find ourselves heartily in agreement
 with Senator Mundt and the others who are supporting him in this legislative
 effort.
 Since delay can only contribute further to our existing inferiority in this im-
 portant field of "cold war" strategy, we would also urge that the subject matter
 is something which calls for early and favorable action by your committee.
 Permit us once more to thank you for the opportunity of submitting this
 statement.
 Very sincerely yours,
 /s/  Floyd Oles,
 FLOYD OLE$, Lt. Col. USAR-Ret.,
 Vice Chairman, Committee on Retirement.
 Mr. IcxonD. Finally, the chairman of the committee, the Honorable
 Edwin E. Willis, of Louisiana, who unfortunately found it impossible
 to attend the hearings this morning, has asked me to read a statement
 which he had prepared for today.
 I will read the brief statement of the chairman of the full committee.
 This is the statement by Mr. Willis :
 I would also like to insert in the record at this point the
 text of a document on existing Communist political warfare
 schools which was prepared by the Department of State last
 year at the request of the Committee on Un-American
 Activities.
 It is entitled A Survey of Sino-Soviet Bloc Political Train-
 ing Establishments for Free World Nationals.
 The committee requested that the State Department fur-
 nish it with a list of all such schools which, to the knowledge of
 the Department, were then in operation and also an approxi-
 mation of the number of graduates turned out by the schools
 each year, the length of time they spent in the schools, the
 countries or areas from which they are recruited, and any
 other related data it could provide.
 Because the content of this document will, I believe, be of
 interest to the members of the committee who are here, to
 the witnesses present, and all others in the hearing room,
 I would like to summarize its contents briefly.
 The very first paragraph reads as follows :
 The Communist Parties of the Sino-Soviet Bloc are currently giving
 extensive training to Free World Communists in the operational doc-
 trines, techniques, and major functional programs of political action
 and political warfare.  This training is a strategically important Bloc
 "export," contributing to the promotion of revolution and attempts to
 seize power throughout the world.
 The next point made in the introduction to this study is
 that the document cannot be considered exhaustive.  Much
 Comunist political warfare training, it points out, is carried
 on secretly and there is, therefore, a very real possibility that
 the Communists have successfully concealed "particularly
 sensitive political training projects."
 Furthermore, it is noted, the report contains no informa-
 tion at all-for obvious reasons-about the Communists' most
 carefully guarded aspect of political warfare training,
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 A?Oroved Fort@WD   28O5/e7k1  FXFltt R6?$Y    446R000600070001-8-
 namely, that given by the intelligence services of the Com-
 munist bloc to their agents.
 The report also points out that it does not include informa-
 tion on the extensive military training programs and the
 paramilitary and guerrilla training projects provided by vari-
 ous Communist governments.  It notes that even guided tours
 for cultural groups and sports enthusiasts are utilized for po-
 litical purposes by the Communists and that all conventional
 universities in Communist bloc countries are Marxist-Leninist
 in orientation and thus utilized for political goals.
 By spelling out these varied aspects of Communist cold war
 o erat.ions and training which it does not cover, the report em-
 p  asizes the tremendous scope of Communist training in all
 forms of nonmilitary techniques designed to subvert the free
 world.
 By way of summary, here are some of the high points in
 the report:
 There are at least seven schools of political warfare op-
 erating in the Soviet Union, nine in East Germany, nine in
 Cuba, four in Czechoslovakia, three in Hungary, and two in
 Bulgaria.  In addition, it is known that. political warfare
 schools exist in Communist. China.  The number, however, is
 not known.
 There are so-called Higher Party Schools in the Soviet
 Union, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany,
 all of which have some foreign students.
 The Higher Party School in the Soviet Union has about
 1,500 students per year about half of which come from other
 nations and 300 of which are from the free world.  The
 courses vary in length from 1 year to 4 years.
 There is an international school for non-bloc Communists
 in the Soviet Union.  It handles about 250 students a year.
 They come from all over the world, the largest number from
 Latin America.  The courses they take vary from 6 months
 to 2 years.
 Red China has specialized in the training of Latin Amer-
 ican and African Communists.  From 1958 to 1961 it had a
 very ambitious Latin American program. It is still train-
 ing some Latin Americans, though not as many as in the
 past.  The training has included. guerrilla warfare, and some
 of it has been devoted exclusively to paramilitary activity.
 The political warfare schools in Red China have stressed
 clandestine party work and organizational work with mass
 groups.
 Pe     g has also run a special training course for Africans.
 Students taking this course do not have to be party members.
 In 1960, the course included not only political ideology, but
 also guerrilla warfare and sabotage. Two thirds of the
 course was devoted to training in weapons and military
 strategy, the use of explosives, and sabotage techniques, and
 one third was devoted to Communist. ideology and how to
 introduce Communist organizations and influence into rural
 areas.
 The Cuban picture is roughly as follows :

 Approved For Reke   n' MWi,1$ :A,        a       R00060007(O01-8
 In 1961 there was an enrollment of approximately 18,830
 students in political warfare schools in Cuba. In 1962 the
 figure jumped to 36,487.  There are Higher Party Schools,
 plus a school for labor leaders, one for teachers, and one for
 local security personnel. Five additional schools are dedi-
 cated to the training of Communist leaders, functionaries,
 and activists.
 There are also provincial and basic schools and programs
 for guerrilla warfare and paramilitary training.  Students
 from other Latin American countries study at these schools.
 Their exact number, however, is not known.
 Of special interest, I believe, is the fact that in the last
 few years, according to this State Department document,
 three special schools for journalists have been established
 behind the Iron Curtain.
 One, set up in 1961 is located in the Roztez Castle near
 Prague, Czechoslovakia.  It is called the Study Center of
 the Union of Czechoslovak Journalists.  Students include
 Asians, Latin Americans, and Africans, with emphasis on
 the latter. The speciality of this school is training personnel
 to staff the national press agencies of African countries. The
 third class to go through this school completed its 6 months'
 course in May 1963. It included 30 students from six different
 countries and brought to 50 the number of students trained
 for Communist work in sub-Saharan and Arab Africa.
 Another journalist school, called the School of Solidarity
 for the Training of African Journalists, has been set up in
 the East Berlin suburb of Buckow. The first formal class was
 graduated from this school in November 1963. It included
 20 young Africans from eight countries.  In earlier, less
 formal training during the years 1961 and 1962, 16 Africans
 from eight different countries went through this school.
 There is also a Communist political warfare school for
 journalists in Hungary called the International Center for
 the Training of Journalists. It is located in Budapest. Its
 students include Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans.
 The school is operated under the auspices of the International
 Organization of Journalists, Moscow's worldwide Communist
 front for newspaper people.
 Many persons have been disturbed in the past few years
 by the evidence of Communist influence in the rising revolu-
 tionary tide in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The high-
 lights of the State Department's report on Communist schools
 of political warfare, which I have touched on, provide a
 strong clue to the origins of this Communist influence.  It
 also indicates that the Communist bloc is doing everything
 possible to widen and strengthen this influence, that we will
 see additional evidence of it in the next few years, and that
 it is time for the United States and other free nations to
 recognize the increased Communist threat it faces in these
 areas and to adopt firm measures to counter them.
 If there be no objection from you other members of the committee
 the report will be placed in toto in the record.

 A Survey of Sino-Soviet Bloc Political Training
 Establishments for Free World Nationals
 The Communist Parties of the Sino-Soviet Bloc are currently giving
 extensive training to Free World Communists in the operational doctrines,
 techniques, and major functional programs of political action and political
 warfare.  This training is a strategically important Bloc "export", con-
 tributing to the promotion of revolution and attempts to seize power
 throughout the world.
 This tabulation of the main schools and programs obviously cannot
 be considered exhaustive.  On the one hand, since much of this training is
 carried on secretly, there is no assurance that particularly sensitive political
 training projects have not been successfully concealed.  The most carefully
 guarded aspects of political warfare training--that given by the intelligence
 services of the Bloc to their agent personnel--has not been considered at all,
 for obvious reasons, in this survey.
 On the other hand, the alt-pervasive nature of the Communist approach
 to indoctrination and political action training affects to varying degrees the
 many varieties of nominally non-political education the Bloc states offer to
 visitors and guests from abroad.  Professional education in philosophy and
 economics at conventional universities is obviously Marxist-Leninist in its
 conclusions; but even guided tours for sports enthusiasts and cultural groups
 are exploited to expose the amenable to ideas and precedents they may find
 useful in pursuing political goats. Finally, the extensive military training
 programs as well as the paramilitary and guerrilla training projects provided
 by various Bloc governments are not included in this survey except in the case
 of China.
 The training described has been given since 1960 in schools run by the
 Communist Parties, by the Young Communist Leagues. by trade union, or
 by youth organizations, and professional bodies such as the national journalist
 associations,  Europe. Latin America, Africa, and Asia all have been repre-
 sented at these schools, by both Communist party members and non-members.
 So far, the USSR and East Germany have been most energetic in building these
 programs. with Czechoslovakia and Hungary next in line.  China's role,
 vigorous during the earlier period, is obviously in a period of change as a

 result of the Sino-Soviet Dispute.  The overall program is not static;
 changes in program, and the development of new establishments are obviously
 occurring constantly; and the interest displayed by the Communist parties in
 deriving as much benefit as possible from these opportunities is still high.

 The CPC currently trains a limited number of Latin American
 Communists each year, with the trainees apparently drawn almost
 exclusively from pro-Chinese factions.  For the time being the
 number of Latin American Communist trainees going to China is
 a mere trickle compared with the numbers who went during 1958-
 1961, when the CPC maintained an ambitious and organized program
 of training numerous Latin American Communists.  The earlier
 program tapered off in the course of the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 The length of the average course for Latin American Communists
 appears to be about three months, with additional time spent in
 touring China.
 The CPC training includes guerrilla warfare as well as political
 indoctrination, with most Latin American Communists apparently
 getting a combination of both.  (In some special cases, however,
 the training may be almost exclusively in paramilitary activity.)
 The political indoctrination portion evidently includes the history
 of the CPC and its ideological development, plus Marxist-Leninist
 doctrine and how to put theory into practice.  In the past the CPC
 was known to stress clandestine party work, and organizational
 work within different mass groups; these probably continue to
 receive emphasis.
 A series of special training courses for Africans has been apparent.
 So far these courses appear to be held at irregular intervals.  For
 the most part, the Africans who attend these special courses are
 not CP members or even particularly knowledgeable of Communism
 prior to the course.
 The training does not all take place in Peking, but other location(s)
 used are not firmly identifiable.

 The curriculum reported for a L960 course for Africans is
 probably representative of subsequent training given to other
 Africans. The training involved guerrilla warfare, sabotage,
 and political ideology.  About two-thirds of the course was
 devoted to explosives,- sabotage techniques, weapon training,
 and military strategy.   The final one-third of the training
 focused on Communist ideology and the methods of introducing
 Communist organizations and influence in rural areas.
 Students from at Least three African countries attended the
 L960 course.
 No information can be provided concerning specialized youth,
 trade union, or other functional training establishments in China.

 1.   Party Ideological Schools
 a.   Higher Party School of the CC/CPSU
 Miusskaya Square 6, Moscow
 As many as 1500 students in one year have been reported at
 this school, although the average yearly enrollment may be
 slightly smaller.  Soviet trainees are believed to number
 roughly one-half of the total student body.
 In July 1960, the school announced that 437 persons had
 graduated that year, including a large number of party
 officials from fraternal CPs in socialist countries.  This
 number is not believed to have included the free world
 Communists who were graduated.
 In the past, an estimated 300 free world Communists
 attended the school each year.  After the 1963 graduation,
 however, it was reported that no free world Communists
 would henceforth be enrolled at this school, and that
 separate facilities had been created for them.  (See school
 b. , below.) The Higher Party School is now said to be
 used exclusively for Soviet and bloc CP trainees.
 Regular courses run for periods of one, two, three and
 even four years.
 The curriculum stresses ideological training, including
 such subjects as economics, philosophy, history of the
 CPSU, party structure, economy of socialist countries,
 and history of national liberation movements.  Study of
 the Russian language is also stressed.
 Foreign students, all of whom must be CP members, have
 come from all areas of the world.
 b. International school for non-bloc Communists (exact name unknown)
 Mo scow
 Believed to have commenced operations in 1962
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For Re    tb   5JOJ/143 rOAoRO        48R00060007ftO1-8
 Regular courses reportedly run for periods of six-months,
 one year, and two years.  Two six-months courses are
 said to be given each school year, thus permitting more
 students to receive training each year.
 The curriculum stresses ideological training but is
 apparently more realistic and specifically designed
 for .free world CP members than was the case at the
 Higher Party School.  Besides the Russian language,
 subjects studied include history of the CPSU, philosophy,
 political economy, and the theory and tactics of Communism.
 In addition, each student reportedly studies the political
 and economic situation of his own country.
 Students are all CP members and are said to be members
 of non-bloc CPs only.  CPs from all areas of the world
 have sent trainees to this school.  Communists from
 Latin America are believed to have made up the largest
 single area group thus far.
 c.   National group training school (no name known)
 Believed located just outside Moscow
 Established prior to 1960
 Upon occasion, a group of trainees from one CP only, or
 from one country only, is enrolled in a separate training
 establishment.  This establishment is probably administered
 by the Higher Party School.  Apart from considerations of
 secrecy, creation of this special facility appears inspired
 by:  (1) The development of CPSU projects that require
 giving ideological training to an unusually large number of
 trainees from one CP at a specified time; or (2) The necessity
 to give special attention to inexperienced and unsophisticated
 "emerging Communists" from a developing country where
 there is as yet no CP.
 Illustrating the first case, during a four year period a
 total of 100 members of one Latin American CP alone
 reportedly received separate training.  Their studies
 included political economics, philosophy, history of the
 CPSU, structure of the CPSU, international relations,
 and history of the labor movement.
 Illustrating the second case, these facilities were
 reportedly used on one occasion for a group of about
 30 Africans from one country.  For over a year this

 ?
 group received special political indoctrination and were
 taught organizational techniques. Their poor academic
 preparation reportedly was taken into account during the
 course.
 d.     Regional party schools in USSR
 (e. g. Tashkent, Baku)
 There are a few reported cases of foreign Communists
 being enrolled in regular courses at regional party
 schools.  In the reported cases, the foreign Communists
 have been either Greek or Iranian nationals long resident
 in the USSR.
 Central Komsomol School
 Veshnyaki
 Pvospekt Oktyabrskiy
 Moscow E. 402
 Established prior to 1960
 This school is said to have a capacity for nearly
 1, 000 students.  An estimated 300 foreign students,
 including those from other bloc countries, appear to
 be enrolled each year.  No reliable statement of the
 number of non-bloc trainees can be given.
 Courses for foreigners generally run for either six-
 months or twelve-months periods.
 The curriculum provides what is virtually CP ideological
 training.  It includes the study of the history of the CPSU,
 organization and work of the Komsomol, philosophy, political
 economy, and the Russian language.
 This school enrolls non-CP youths as well as members of
 CP youth organizations; they receive their training together.
 Hence, the foreign students include a significant number of
 trainees from countries where no organized CP exists.  In
 1963, students from about 30 foreign countries were reported
 at the school, with about 10 African countries represented.
 All areas of the world sent students to the school.

 3.   Trade Union schools
 Trade Union School of the All-Union Central Council of
 Trade Unions
 Moscow
 Established 1961
 A course of about nine months is given for foreigners,
 combining instruction in Marxist doctrine with training
 in tactics to be employed in organizing and manipulating
 trade unions.
 The first class was made up entirely of Africans.  Subsequent
 classes, numbering as many as 100 each, have included,
 along with Africans, a few students from Asia and numerous
 Latin Americans.  A class of this varied composition began
 in 1963, with another scheduled for 1964.
 Other groups of trainees have from time to time been sent
 from overseas labor unions to the Soviet Union for less
 formal training of a few weeks' duration.

 Georgi Dimitrov Trade Union School
 (Courses for foreigners have been given intermittently since 1960)
 A one-year course is currently being presented.  A class began in
 October 1963.  Latin Americans are prominently included (including
 four from Cuba).      A previous class was composed chiefly of Africans.
 Groups of trainees from the Arab countries have also been trained in
 Bulgaria.

 All ideological training within Cuba is organized and directed by the
 t.              governing party through the National Directorate of Revolutionary Instruction,
 without the division of administrative responsibility already developed in the
 Soviet Bloc systems. Organized principally for Cubans, these schools--at
 least the key ones--enroll students from other Latin American countries as well.
 No estimate of the numbers of foreign students is possible at this time.  The
 total enrollment, in national, provincial, and basic schools, was 18, 830 in 1961
 and 36, 487 in 1962.
 1.    Key National "Schools of Revolutionary Instruction"--1962
 a. "Nice Lopez"--
 This school, intended
 eventually to be equiva-
 lent to bloc "Higher

 is supplemented by the

 School for national and
 provincial labor leaders
 c.  "Juan Ronda"--
 for defense committee
 (local security auxiliary
 force) members
 d.  "Ruben Bravo"--

 These key national schools are supplemented by five others that train
 functionaries, leaders, and activists for smaller functional groups and for work
 at the local level.  Provincial and basic schools indoctrinate even larger groups
 of Cubans.  These national schools do not include the programs for paramilitary
 and guerrilla training, in which some political indoctrination and training is
 known to be given.

 Paralleling the CPSU's Higher Party School, this school provides
 similar ideological training.
 2.     International Communist Seminar Facilities
 Problems of Peace and Socialism (PPS) headquarters

 The editorial board of the international Communist publication, PPS,
 in Prague, sponsors, sometimes in conjunction with the Czechoslovakia
 party, international seminars on subjects of importance to all CPs.
 Participants from many CPs have also prepared detailed written
 contributions for use at these seminars.  (Not all PPS-sponsored
 seminars are held in Prague, but the majority take place there.)
 The materials used are, once properly edited and compiled, published
 and distributed for use throughout the world in ideological training.
 Some 1962-1963 seminars were on the following subjects:  Building a
 United Anti-Imperialist Front; Socialist World System and the National
 Liberation Movement; Communists and Democracy; and Present
 Stage of the National Liberation Movement of the Arab Peoples.

 Roztez Castle (near Prague)
 1961
 At this location and elsewhere in Czechoslovakia training has been
 given, both in organized courses and through individual instruction,
 to young Latin Americans, Asians, and especially Africans.  It is
 carried out largely through the Czechoslovak Press Agency (CTK).
 A specialty has been the training of persons to staff new national press
 agencies in the African countries.  The third class completed a six
 months course in May .1963.  It was made up of some thirty students
 from six countries.  This class brought to a total of fifty the number of
 journalists trained to work in sub-Saharan and Arab Africa.
 The Czech Union of Journalists, in conjunction with the International
 Organization of Journalists (which also has its headquarters in Prague),
 has sponsored similar training of young Latin Americans on "scholar-
 ships" awarded for extended visits in Czechoslovakia.  Details are not

 Paralleling the CPSU's Higher Party School, this school provides
 similar ideological training.
 b.   School facilities provided to other CPs
 Bad Doberan, Greifswald, Rostock, Wismar, Oderberg
 Established prior to 1960
 At the above locations the SED is reported to provide assistance
 and facilities for the party training of Communists from several
 other CPs, from principally those of Scandinavia.  The program
 for the Nordic parties, which appears to take place chiefly at the
 first three locations above, is a continuing and regular venture.
 The use of facilities in East Germany is dictated in part at
 least by the belief that the students can thus be trained under
 more secure conditions.
 Literally hundreds of foreign CP members have received
 training in these schools.  A class of 30-50 from one CF is
 not unusual.  There is no known mixing of students from different
 cps.
 The length of the courses is usually described as ranging from a
 few weeks to a few months (one of four months was reported).
 Often the schooling is given during the "vacations" of the CP
 members.
 As part of the curriculum, SED instructors may lecture on the
 building of socialism in East Germany.  Otherwise, the subjects
 taught are handled by instructors from the particular foreign
 CP.  Subjects reportedly include political economy, problems
 of the workers' movement, and "party questions."

 Meyerhoff.
 The chairman of the committee, I might say to you, a few days ago
 received a letter from a former member of the Congress, the Honorable
 Clinton D. McKinnon, requesting that this committee give favorable
 consideration to your testimony.  In his letter he referred to your
 deep concern about the Communist, problem and mentioned the fact
 that after addressing the San Diego Rotary Club of 350 members a
 few weeks ago you received one of the greatest ovations the club has
 ever given a speaker.
 The chairman has asked that I make this letter a part of the hearing
 record, and if there be no objection it will be made a part of the record.
 It reads as follows :
 Honorable Edwin E. Willis,
 House Office Building,
 Washington, D.G.
 Dear Mr. Congressman:
 You may recall me as the Democratic Congressman from San Diego who
 entered the House for the 81st Congress--both of us "freshmen" together.
 I am writing to ask your favorable consideration. of the testimony Arthur
 Meyerhoff will give your Un-American Activities Committee this coming Wednes-
 day, April 28th.
 Mr. Meyerhoff is one of the highly respected persons in the advertising profes,
 sion and, like many another businessman, is deeply concerned about this coun-
 try's failure to measure up to the Commies in propaganda warfare.
 Mr. Meyerhoff talked on this subject before our San Diego Rotary Club of 350
 members a few weeks back and received one of the greatest ovations this club
 has-ever given a speaker.
 I am hopeful that what he advocates will make sense to you and your com-
 mittee, for we appear to be losing out to the Commies in our "idea" warfare and
 a change is certainly indicated.
 I hope things are well with you.

 Mr. Meyerhoff, I know you are the author of The Strategy of Per-
 suasion, the Use of Advertising Skills in Fighting the Cold War. I

 colleague, Representative Dante B. Fascell, chairman of the Subcom-

 Mr. MEYERHOFF. Thank you. I am very pleased with Mr. McKin-

 accounts with offices in Chicago; Toronto and Montreal, Canada; and
 Zurich, Switzerland.
 When it was first suggested that I appear before this committee
 I was reluctant to do so because the field of my studies and activities,
 did not seem to qualify me to speak with authority on the work of the
 Un-American Activities Committee as I understand it to be.
 However, when I was informed that my appearance had to do with
 the hearings on a bill to establish a Freedom Commission and Freedom
 Academy, and I subsequently studied the reports of previous hearings
 on the bill, I realized that it came within the scope of what I had been
 working on for the past 20 years.
 I think it is important for this committee to hear the results of my
 experience and research, which have to do with:
 1) an analysis of the skills with which the Communists are fight-
 ing the pgropaganda war against the free world;
 2) w }rat skills we as a nation are using to counter that war;
 3) the reluctance on the part of our State Department and the
 United States Information Agency to take a more dynamic approach
 to offset the worldwide Communist propaganda offensive against the
 United States and the free world;
 4) the resources we have in the United States to effectively fight
 the Communist propaganda offensive.
 While I wish to speak in support. of bill II.R. 2379, I believe there
 are other immediate steps that we must take to stop the progress of
 the Communist propaganda offensive, making use of the skilled practi-
 tioners who already exist in the United States. These people have the
 special qualifications to understand the methods and technical skills
 behind the Communists' propaganda war, and they have the tools to
 help turn the tide of battle in our favor.
 People in our State Department and our United States Information
 Agency, whose background and outlook eminently qualify them to
 deal with people on a person-to-person diplomatic level, aiming pri-
 marily at. people of their own intellectual level or what they refer to
 as the opinion leaders, seem to have no qualifications for, and little
 understanding of, the modern techniques of persuading a mass of
 people to accept. an idea.
 Their experience doesn't include the possibility that diplomats and
 opinion leaders can, in some instances, be motivated by a direct appeal
 from the masses, which, in turn, may help them to more easily achieve
 their diplomatic objectives.
 Certainly, the appeals to large numbers of people through the
 masses require it completely different orientation than those skills
 required in diplomacy.
 Our peaceful intentions, our humanitarian acts and our desires
 for self-determination for peoples of the world should speak for them-
 selves.  Normally, our country should have no need for external
 propaganda, but we have a competitor that is poisoning the minds
 of people all over the world, using the very selling skills that were
 actually developed by the advertising, merchandising, and selling
 professions in the United States.
 Mr. Iciionu. At that point, Mr. Meyerhoff, how do y-ou analogize tlie.
 propaganda tactics of the Communists over the world to advertising
 techniques used here in the United States?

 Mr. MEYERHorr. How do they use those techniques?
 Mr. IOI30RD. Yes.  How are they similar?
 Mr. MEYERHOFF. I point out some of those as I go along.  One par-
 ticular technique is the use of repetition.  We in advertising don't
 say a thing once to get an idea over; we say it over and over again.
 The same is true of Communists.  For a number of years they have
 used this same theme : "We are the people's democracy. America is
 the imperialist," and they say that so often that I think they have
 a lot of people believing that and echoing that point of view.
 Another similarity is in the research techniques.  Instead of speak-
 ing in the context of their own experience, the Communists research
 the group they are working on, to learn their aims and hopes and
 aspirations, and address their messages and their propaganda to the
 self-interest of the people they are trying to persuade.
 This is precisely what we do in the advertising business.
 Mr. IcHORD. In other words, they study the people where they are
 directing the propaganda.  One selling technique might work in one
 country and another selling technique in another.
 Mr.   EYERHOFF. That is correct.  I don't believe there is any three-
 or five-point program for solving all our propaganda problems all
 over the world.  It depends, for example, on what has been said by
 our major competitor in each particular country.  It depends on their
 experiences, their hopes, their needs, and how we relate to their
 security.
 Have I answered your question?
 Mr. IcHoRD. Yes, sir.
 Mr. MEYERHOFF. We must face this fact : If our Government were
 doing an adequate job of combating the Communist propaganda as-
 saults against us, there would be no need for a Freedom Commission
 and Freedom Academy outside of the State Department and the
 United States Information Agency.
 Because of the State Department's failure to come to grips with the
 problems which the Academy would attack,,. I also strongly urge this
 committee to reject the State Department's request that any academy
 of this type come under their immediate direction.
 The resistance that the bills to create a Freedom Commission and
 Freedom Academy are facing now, and will face in the future, is the
 same resistance which I, and many leaders in our industry, have faced
 in the past in trying to get our Government information agencies to
 use the professional skills of people trained in the arts of persuasion
 to fight the propaganda offensive.
 This resistance does not, as some people in our country believe, come
 from sinister forces in our Government that are on the side of the
 Communists. Wherever I speak, people ask me if there are people
 in our State Department who are influenced by the Communists.  I
 hasten to tell them that I don't believe so.
 My studies indicate that this resistance stems partly from the antip-
 athy that the intellectual elite in general have for anything involving
 selling, advertising, and public relations.
 I recently received a letter from a news correspondent with broad
 experience m Government and educational circles. He said, in part,
 `'I dislike the word `sell' almost as much as `advertising.' For many

 reasons, they have built up a connotation, no matter how unfair, of
 charlatanism."
 Because of my background and studies, I believe I can give you an
 analysis that may not only help this committee to understand the
 resistance the bill is meeting, but may give those who are opposed
 something to consider which may possibly change their point of view.
 An understanding of this resistance may save this bill from meeting
 the same fate that other similar efforts have met.
 During much of my career I have had what amounts to an avoca-
 tion in applying the skills of selling and advertising to public service
 causes, working with schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations
 on a voluntary basis to increase enrollment or win public support.
 In addition, during World War II one of our clients devoted an
 important part. of his advertising budget. to helping various Govern-
 ment services involved in the war to bring to the people of the United
 States the story of the contribution of these services in the war effort,
 Our client, who was extremely public spirited. noticing the lack of
 understanding of selling and advertising techniques in Government
 agencies, felt that his stake in the, war effort was to help the Govern-
 ment services to do a better job of presenting their story to the Amer-
 ican public by using the same skills of selling and advertising that were
 responsible for the success of his business.
 I supervised much of the liaison between our client. a.nd the various
 Government. services, and at. one time our organization was working
 with the Armyy, the Navy, the Manpower Commission, the Maritime
 Service, the Office of Wray Information, and the Treasury Department,
 as well as other services.
 Based on our procedures, we researched and examined the important
 ob"ct.ives these services told us they were trying to achieve in gaining
 pudic support. We then, in cooperation with our client, planned pro-
 grams to accomplish their goals.
 In our work with public service organizations and Government, over
 20 years' time, the people we dealt, with-whether they were Army
 officers, educators, public-minded citizens, or Government officials-
 were in the beginning almost always entirely resistant and fearful of
 working with anyone who used a selling or advertising vocabulary.
 I think you could compare the situation to the image that. some
 people have of the Un-American Activities Committee : it was not
 what we might. have been able to do that frightened them, it. was their
 preconceived notions of what- we represented. We. were "hucksters,"
 `hidden persuaders," "'Madison Avenue boys"; all terms created by
 journalists, novelists, and the movie industry.  I found that when we
 avoided the terminology often associated with advertising-words
 such as "persuade." "hard sell," "promotion"-it was easier to gain
 their confidence.
 There is definitely a strong resistance in higher educational circles
 to the techniques of selling, advertising, public relations, or any
 method which attempts to " ersuade."  It is the academic theory that
 people should he intellectua y challenged and should be able to get the
 truth by themselves.
 They fail to realize that the masses of people believe a great. deal of
 what. they bear, right or wrong, particularly when it- is repeated to

 them over and over again. We in advertising know we must repeat a
 message over and over in order to get people to take action.
 To give you some further evidence of the academic resistance to sell-
 ing techniques, results of a survey on the opinions of college men and
 their grasp of the functions of advertising and selling brought out
 some of the following results : Three fourths of the male college slu-
 The biggest student objection to sales work is that it is "forcing
 people to buy things they don't ne2d." A Yale student. said of selling
 that it is both too frustrating and prostituting.
 An Oregon youngster, who was trying to be openminded, came up
 with the statement that he wouldn't mind selling a product of "pro-
 found significance to the consumer." But he had never found such a
 product.
 Mr. IciroRD. The image of you in the advertising field is almost as
 bad as in the politician field.
 Mr. MEYERxoFF. Not as bad. We are not heckled as publicly to the
 great extent that politicians are.
 Ted Repplier of the Advertising Council, in a talk at a luncheon
 of the leaders of education in New York City, urged the educators :
 "Please understand me; I am not suggesting that educators cease
 criticizing advertising, but merely that they be fair and specific.
 Neither am I defending all advertising although perhaps 95 percent
 of advertising offends no one. Ninety-five percent, by the way, is not
 perfect, but it is not bad. Some might question whether the actions of
 less publicized professions like law and medicine would score any high-
 er. But, for heaven's sake, when criticizing advertising, may we not
 have some of that fine objectivity for which educators are famous?"
 Incidentally, I have noted some recent relaxation outside of Gov-
 ernment of the attitude against selling and advertising, on the part
 of several outstanding educators. For example, I had quoted Raphael
 Demos, a world-renowned philosopher, formerly of Harvard and
 presently at Vanderbilt University, as having warned a Radcliffe
 graduating class that they'd be assailed by the spellbinders and
 `tempted by the magnetic voices of the demagogues and fanatics" of
 advertising once they were outside the protection of their college.
 Ina recent letter from Professor Demos, he said, in part ;
 +     Advertising fulfills a need in our society ; it awakes, arouses, even creates
 wants in the hearts of the public ; in this way, our economy becomes an expand-
 ing one.                        We need what we want, and we want what we imagine; advertising
 enlarges our imagination.
 Many of the people in our State Department and the U.S. Informa-
 tion Agency have not emerged from the rarified atmosphere of the
 academic world and still cling to antagonistic theories and attitudes
 toward selling, advertising, or any method designed to persuade the
 masses.
 No wonder they resist taking an active role in doing what should
 be their number-one job-selling freedom to the world. Any effort
 to convey ideas to people through selling skills represents "indoctrina-
 tion" or "brainwashing" to them.  I think this committee heard this
 point of view expressed during the testimony of Mr. Averell Harri-
 man.  Several times he referred to "indoctrination" and "brain-
 washing."

 In trying to understand the strong opposition to the selling point
 of view and to the opposition to the Freedom Academy bill, I have
 come across an additional concept that is held by Government leaders,
 namely, that freedom in and of itself is in the order of a self-evident
 truth which is self-motivating and self-perpetuating.
 Therefore, in the name of freedom all manner of negative, as well
 as small percentages of positive, news can be freely communicated
 to uncommitted nations on the assumption that this "breath of fresh
 air" will, as if by magic, turn a, confused mind in our direction.
 The recognition that freedom as a concept must be sold in its own
 way does not enter their minds;. therefore, to propose an aggressive,
 professional sales campaign runs contrary to the basic philosophical
 beliefs of many people who create policy in Government circles.
 The idea that there is something reprehensible about selling has
 taken on in their minds the characteristics of what one might call a
 religion.  Yet, if we examine the history of our democratic truths,
 which we hold to be self-evident or accepted as revelation, it is easy
 to see that at one time they were disseminated as selling messages,
 in the strict sense of the. word, and repeated over and over again-
 otherwise they would never have been accepted.  "Indoctrination,
 brainwashing" if you want to call it that-.
 Academic. people often see advertising as a gaudy page in the news-
 paper or an irritating interruption in a favorite television program.
 They think only of the high-pressure magazine salesman who wedges
 his foot in their door or of the Hollywood version of the obnoxious
 publicity man.  They don't understand that persuasion can be subtle
 or pleasing or lofty in purpose. They don't understand that advertis-
 ing of some breed or shade is being practiced all the time by all peo-
 ple, in all media, and for all purposes.
 A little freedom symbol painted on the side of a stone wall can be
 a sales message or an advertisement, too.
 The question which prompted me to spend 5 years in researching and
 writing my book, The Strategy of Persuasion, is the same question, it
 seems to me, that motivated the many people who worked on the vari-
 ous bills to establish a Freedom Commission and Freedom Academy.
 It is the same question more and more Americans are asking every
 day. While that question is being stated in various ways, essentially
 it is, "What is wrong with the way we are being interpreted abroad?"
 Many leaders inside Government have been asking this same question.
 When Robert. Kennedy returned from a visit to 14 nations he wrote:
 The amount of misinformation, as well as lack of information, about the
 United States and our system of government 1s appalling.
 The Communist propaganda machine constantly spews out its facts and figures
 and its version of how to solve the problems of the world.
 Mr. Kennedy continued;  -
 No one comes forward with an explanation of the modern-day United States;
 no one counters with the fact that modern-day colonialism is tied to Communism,
 not capitalism. _No one is there to talk about Latvia, _Lithuania, Hungary,
 Poland, Tihet, or East Berlin. No one is prepared to counter the C-omuunists'
 arguments.

 Our President, as Vice President, came back in 1961 from a good-
 will tour of several countries and made this observation :
 The United States has not sold itself to the world. A nation that knows how
 to popularize corn flakes and luxury automobiles ought to be able to tell the world
 the simple truth about what it is doing, and why it is doing it.
 That statement suggests that the methods and people who did pop-
 ularize corn flakes and luxury automobiles and a lot of other things
 could apply their knowledge and methods to making the truth about
 the United States better known and better understood.
 Over the years, whenever a leader in our industry has spoken out
 about Government using the skilled people and methods of advertising
 to help turn the tide in the propaganda battle, the same statement has
 been heard from our Government information agencies-that you can-
 not sell Government ideas the way you sell soap flakes.
 This has not been confined to one administration.  It has persisted
 for the past 20 years, as far as I can tell.
 This statement was recently reiterated by a spokesman for the
 United States Information Agency. The statement, in part, said :
 The advertising industry is a skilled and effective force in the American
 marketplace, but I hasten to say it is a naive person who assumes that if a
 man is a top salesman of soap and deodorant he is automatically an expert
 in selling ideas or political outlook.
 Well, of course, you don't sell ideas the way you sell soap and
 deodorant. Neither do you sell Cadillac cars the way you sell soap.
 Inherent in the product is the means for selling that product. A good
 salesman adjusts his technique to the product or idea and the people
 he is trying to persuade and sell.
 The reference to soap and deodorant, by the way, showed a_ deep-
 seated resentment toward selling.  There are many of the neces-
 sities of life that are sold through advertising; it isn't all soap
 and deodorant.
 The important thing is that advertising men make their living by
 finding out how to reach people and developing the right words
 or symbols to get them to act in a predictable way.
 Why do we buy one brand of cigarettes rather than another? With
 our eyes shut we probably can't tell one cigarette from another. But
 we live by symbols. Some catch phrase, some familiar melody, some
 glimpse of a cowboy in God's country-and we are impelled to buy
 a particular cigarette.
 My research indicates there is no one in a responsible position in
 the United States Information Agency with training and experience
 in the "arts of persuasion" as practiced in the United States.  This
 agency is long on information and short on persuasion.
 With their background in journalism, education, and foreign af-
 fairs, it is easy to understand why officials of USIA concentrate on
 information centers, lending libraries; printing and distributing
 magazines; and engaging in activities designed to improve the cul-
 tures of people; but they have not designed these activities to present
 a direct, convincing story that will bring masses of people to the side
 of the free world.
 Incidentally, in speaking of our overseas libraries with books in
 English that are aimed at improving the culture of peoples rather
 than presenting a direct story that will make them favorable to us,

 I would like to say that libraries have an extremely limited appeal
 in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, South Vietnam, and
 elsewhere, where they were burned recently.
 A statement recently issued by the USIA said that the libraries
 act as a lightning rod-a safety valve-and if they weren't avail-
 able in some countries, the organizers of these anti-American demon-
 strations probably would direct their mobs to move against private
 U.S. interests in their midst-a rather novel use for the expensive
 libraries that we have established overseas.  This explanation appears
 to me to be a little farfetched in justifying our present sterile propa-
 ganda approach.
 USIA's most noteworthy activity is to tell the truth of what goes
 on in the United States through its own news facilities.  Of course,
 the truth of what. goes on in the United States-as you and I know
 it lias far more to offer to the world than Russia or Cuba or Red
 China can offer.
 In spite of our problems, no rational man would exchange our way
 of life for that of-the man behind the Iron Curtain.  And yet, there
 is a fallacy in the USIA approach. This approach has put the United
 States Information Agency, a Government agency, into the news busi-
 ness, a function that is contrary to the principles of a democratic
 societ}
 USIA explains that by broadcasting the news of what goes on in
 the United States, good or bad, people will eventually realize that we
 tell the truth, and our messages will be believed.  Unfortunately,
 the news does not always reflect the truth of what goes on in our coun-
 try as a whole.
 In fact, we know that. the events which make the headlines are the
 events that are unusual.  That's why they are in the headlines. If
 riots and scandals were common occurrences, they would not be given
 such heavy coverage.
 When we hear of unusual or newsworthy events, we automatically
 relate them to what. is normal and familiar.  People overseas, who
 know virtually nothing about life in the United States, cannot do this.
 They accept the events they hear about as being typical or common-
 and anyone who has entertained a visitor from overseas has
 place,
 had that fact brought home to hiin.
 And yet we have the spectacle of the USIA-an official Government
 agency-broadcasting day after day throughout the world news of
 crime and scandal in the United States.  Yes, these unpleasant events
 do happen, but do they represent the real United States that you
 and I know ?  I don't think they do.
 The things we hear on the air and read about in newspapers are
 unusual.  That's why they are "news."
 There are many more law-abiding citizens than there are lawbreak-
 ers.  There are infinitely more responsible teenagers than wild or
 delinquent teenagers.  I think that is being demonstrated on the
 Mississippi River today, the way those kids are working on the dikes to
 stem the floods. There are more enduring marriages than divorces.
 But none of that is news.
 It is a sad fact that. the truth is not usually news.  And news does
 not necessarily reflect the truth.

 The constructive things about our society and what it represents are
 not newsworthy and can be completely overshadowed by the violence
 in the daily headlines.
 The problem is magnified in other nations, where the Communists
 add their own distorted version of what goes on in the United States.
 How many people stop to think that the reason they don't hear very
 much sensational news about the Communist nations is not that mur-
 ders, divorces, and riots don't happen there, but that they are rarely
 reported?
 By contrast, we look pretty bad.  The true contrast-the contrast
 of a free press versus a totalitarian press-is lost in the mass of head-
 lines.
 I have been advocating that our Government get out of the news
 business and get into the selling business, that is, USIA should no
 longer attempt to cover the news for the people of the world.  This
 vital function is best left in the hands of the free press of the world,
 the nongovernmental commercial news services that completely serve
 the free world.
 Where this commercial news is not available-as behind the Iron
 Curtain-our Voice of America is not an able substitute. What news
 does get through the jamming is neutralized by incessant hostile pro-
 paganda. And for those behind the Iron Curtain who do want news
 of the free world, there are Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty-
 both privately operated broadcasting operations that are, by some re-
 ports, more effective than Voice of America.
 Through the Voice of America, USIA broadcasts programs, some of
 which are so erudite and dull that I'm sure they attract only a tiny
 fraction of their potential audience. Here are some titles of Voice
 of America scripts : National Institute of Arts and Letters, Eugene
 O'Neill: Part I, Earthquakes: Cause and Effect, and one called Dead
 Horse, the Featherbed and Unwork.
 The last one is a discussion of useless work in our society of super-
 abundance. I wonder how impressive that subject is to those nations
 where the big problem is how to stay alive from day to day.
 Creative programming on the Voice of America designed to reach
 the largest possible audience with effective messages woven into the
 broadcast schedule on a day-in-day-out basis can bring many more mil-
 lions to our side.
 The entertainment industry and the advertising industry working
 together as they do in the United States have proven that they. have
 the know-how to get results.
 Many people don't realize that a propaganda offensive can pack the
 lethal power of a python-and can coil and choke just as effectively,
 too.  Now, everybody understands the weapons threat-that a 50-
 megaton bomb can knock the hell out of a city, and a 1000-megaton
 bomb will knock hell out of a county.  But they don't understand that
 a megaton of propoganda can knock the resistance out of a continent-
 or of the world itself.
 In 1917 Lenin invented a slogan : Peace, Land, Bread. That's all-
 three lovely words-and then repetition did the trick. That slogan
 was to be more effective than the whole Russian Army. An old United
 States advertising technique was getting a potent new application.

 Lenin saw, as some of our brilliant leaders even today do not see,
 that if you control the minds of men it doesn't matter who controls
 the guns. And so, Russia has had an enormous jump onus in the strat-
 egy of political persuasion.
 The Communists may threaten the free world with their weapons,
 but I believe that we have more to fear from the psychological devices
 they are using in the war of words. It will be this war that will even-
 tually decide whether communism will rule the world, or will wither
 and die.
 While we congratulate ourselves on having achieved a lull in the
 cold war in the West, the long-range Communist propaganda war goes
 on full force. Treaties, trade agreements, and cultural exchanges be-
 come propaganda weapons for them.
 I would like to have you look at some of the papers that many col-
 leges throughout the United States are getting. Each one of them has
 in it the inevitable propaganda statements downgrading the United
 States and praising the Communist world.  The publications are cir-
 culated openly through our mails.
 I ask you to look at a recent issue of Ame ka, a USIA production,
 written in Polish for distribution in Poland, with 35 pages of news
 and dramatic pictures devoted to our race riots. It. does give the history
 of the civil rights movement, with an attempt to tell the story of
 freedom in academic detail.
 But the dramatic pictures and the colorful language used to describe
 the "oppressed peoples" throughout America overshadow the explana-
 tion, and I am sure that the overall impression from this article is that
 America is torn by strife. Consider its impact-a Government produc-
 tion. How the Reds must love this ammunition we give them.
 Now, would it have been so unethical to feature a 35-page illustrated
 article about our fine Polish-American citizens in America enjoying
 the fruits of freedom rather than to emphasize this material?
 I would like to, if I may, just show you this magazine.
 Mr. Iciionu. Could you leave that with the committee, Mr. Meyer-
 hoff?
 Mr. MEYERnov'. Yes, sir, I will. Here is a picture of the march on
 Washington.  The very picture demonstrates the freedom of our
 country. The country where this magazine was sold is not free. But
 the words that stand out in this article are, "We seek freedom in 1963."
 Mr. CLAWSON. Mr. Meyerhoff, what was the distribution?  How
 many were circulated?
 Mr. MEYERHoFF. As I understand it, it is about 30,000, and they are
 sold on the basis of an exchange program with the Communists. They
 publish a counterpart of that magazine in this country and, from what.
 I have seen of the Communist counterpart, they are doing one heck of
 a selling job.
 Mr. Icxoan. Your idea is it would be very easy for the Communists
 to come in behind an article such as this and sell the idea that no one
 has freedom in the United States?
 Mr. 14SETF.RLiOFF. It would be very simple. They have the material
 right there to work with. It is true that the magazine has quite limited
 distribution. It is true that it. does tell the story of freedom. It does
 make a complete analysis of our side of the story, But if you take it
 in its entirety, the detail is overshadowed by the violence.

 The USIA explains the use of material such as this in the following
 manner : "* * * we must plan our efforts in certain knowledge that
 what is done in a Selma or a Harlem or said in the Senate or in our
 press becomes part of our campaign."
 Many people are killed annually by slipping in their bathtubs,
 but if you were to bring up this fact at the same time that you were
 trying to tell people of the joy of taking a. bath. you would discourage
 them from taking baths.
 This does not mean that you should suppress the statistics of the
 number of people who are killed annually in bathtubs, but it is an
 example of what happens when you combine a news function with a
 selling function.
 You cannot do an effective job of presenting. an idea or product by
 emphasizing the negative sides.'of the product. The negative aspects
 are often so spectacular that they overshadow the benefits that the idea
 or the product has to offer.
 When a Government agency gets into the news business, it is almost
 impossible to present impartially what is good. in our society.
 There is hardly a product or an event that doesn't have its negative
 factors, but in selling we emphasize the positive.
 I am certain that if the skilled men in advertising, public relations,
 and selling were called upon to direct our propaganda efforts, they
 would find many ways to emphasize the constructive things that our
 society has to offer.
 I want to make this perfectly clear. I am in no way suggesting
 that the free press be inhibited or that they be stopped from publish-
 ing the news. What I am saying is that our Government should begin
 an educational program designed to have people overseas understand
 our society its humanitarian purposes, and its free press, so that they
 can properly evaluate the truth of our position.
 I have no concern about the people in the United States understand-
 ing our country as a whole, but I am concerned with these people in
 other countries who don't understand it.
 Freedom and truth will not be bought on what we consider their
 "self-evident" merits, unless we effectively bring those merits to the
 attention of the people whom we want to influence.
 Any American will grant that in a court of law each side should,
 without distorting facts, be as persuasive as possible. We accept this
 as proper. We'd be quick to fire our lawyer if he kept stressing the
 spectacularly negative aspects of our case.
 Yet, at present, two ideologies stand before the bar of world opinion,
 fighting for survival. The opposition uses every emotional trick in the
 led news facts,
 book. But our own counsel persists in citing only so-cal
 often highly damaging to us-and conscientiously refuses to persuade
 the jury of the world.
 Propaganda can have noble aims. It is merely an organized effort
 to spread particular doctrines. Propaganda can be misused, of course,
 but so can a hammer or a razor-or anything else.
 Automobiles can transport and automobiles can mangle. Water can
 quench thirst and water can drown.  But we don't forego these great
 necessities because somebody else misuses them.
 I think that also came up in the testimony from the State Depart-
 ment, that we can't use the methods that the Communists use.  If

 they are misusing the proven methods of persuasion by lying, wily
 cant we use these methods to tell the truth? Our Defense Depart-
 ment is quick to match and surpass the Communists with every wea-
 pon of war; why should a weapons gap exist, in the propaganda war?
 Whether propaganda is good or bad depends entirely on its pur-
 poses.  Hitler made a vicious use of propaganda; Stalin made a vicious
 use of propaganda. Consequently, propaganda has a bad name. Yet
 propaganda may be used for excellent objectives-to back charities,
 to wipe out disease or forest fires, and many other constructive things.
 Naturally I support the bill to create a Freedom Commission and a
 Freedom Academy, dust as I would instantly support any approach or
 technique which can possibly help us in the struggle against commu-
 nism a.nd the understanding of what they are trying to do.
 Certainly, it. is important to train people in and out of Government
 to understand the ideeological assaults that. are being made against. the
 free world and means for fighting those assaults. We need every force
 that America can muster, even though this force would be an un-
 organized force fighting a highly efficient., organized propaganda
 organization.
 In addition to the people in and out of Government who will be
 trained by the Freedom Academy, there must be a Government agency
 that becomes operational now to direct our cold war efforts if we are to
 successfully offset the hate and subversion that the Communists are
 spreading against. us and the free world.
 This organization can be our present United States Information
 Agency, but it must carry out the spirit of Public Law No. 402 upon
 which it was established-"an Act to promote the better understand-
 ing of the United States among the peoples of the world and to
 strengthen cooperative international relations."
 In order to accomplish this end, it must be headed and staffed by
 people with definite experience and training in the skills of persuasion.
 There must be professional leadership, under the direction of the
 President, to establish an effectivepropan'anda program.
 In a communication from the State Department to this committee,
 dated March 29 of this year, which opposes the bill to establish the
 Freedom Commission and Freedom Academy, Douglas MacArthur II
 stated, "Expertise and operational experience are as important in the
 formulation of policy as they are in its execution."
 I agree with this wholeheartedly, but the State Department has
 not proven its expertise and operational experience in the area of
 propaganda.
 To draw an analogy from the business world, the State Department
 can be compared to the sales department of a large corporation which
 sells only to wholesale buyers.  The sales manager mays consider his
 jab of primary importance, since he makes the sale.  But the adver-
 tising department that directs its efforts to the consuming public
 knows that the wholesale buyer has to buy the product if the con-
 sumers demand the product as a result of the advertising.  The sales
 manager's job is made easier by virtue of the pressure of the adver-
 tising.
 Isn't it possible that the State Department's fob might be easier if
 there were an effective force in the field bringing pressures to bear
 on the diplomats?  I believe this is precisely what the Communists
 are doing when they demonstrate in various countries.

 By stressing the importance of the diplomats and the opinion lead-
 ers, we overlook the fact that opinions of the masses are not neces-
 sarily influenced by a few leaders and that leaders can be influenced
 by the masses.  I believe that this is the reason that Russia has large,
 trained propaganda organizations throughout the world to do just
 this.
 We must move to the attack in all parts of the world now with the
 readily available professional persuaders of the United States.  We
 need a broad-based, effective propaganda program directed by men
 skilled in the "arts of persuasion."  We in the United States are the
 greatest salesmen in the world, but we have not sold freedom to the
 world.
 We have not exposed the living lie that is communism and the hate
 it is spreading.
 It is high time to call in the experts-not the Hollywood version
 of the Madison Avenue hucksters, but the trained, imaginative, dedi-
 cated men who have proved they have precisely the skills needed to
 make people yearn for what is good-and motivate them to obtain it.
 Once again I say, as a representative of the advertising profession,
 that I will endorse bill No. H.R. 2379 to create a Freedom Commis-
 sion and Freedom Academy. But, in conclusion, I wish to mention
 several matters on which the success of this general project will hinge :
 First, the Freedom Commission and Freedom Academy must
 be centralized in its control, undominated by other departments,
 bold and imaginative in its proposals.
 Second, any department or agency receiving policy proposals
 from the Freedom Academy should be expected to cooperate with
 these proposals, or be required to justify its refusal.
 Third, a liberal budget must be made available to carry through
 the Academy proposals.  According to estimates, the Russians
 spend between $11,/2 to $2 billion a year on propaganda missions.
 Here we are at a tremendous competitive disadvantage.  The
 finest proposal will be a strangled pigeon without cash.  And if
 it only saves a tiny part of our great big defense budget by win-
 ning the propaganda war, it will save many billions.
 Fourth, the techniques and skills of advertising men and public
 relations men should be employed to the fullest now in a reor-
 ganized and adequately financed USIA. Unlike others who will
 need years of training, these professional forces are ready to tackle
 the job for America immediately.
 Spot experiments would precede any widespread campaigns, of
 course.  As in advertising, we must try out a technique in a limited
 locality and then broaden the scope when results are favorable.
 I challenge the USIA to recruit a group of skilled advertising and
 public relations men and assign to them the responsibility for reaching
 the people of just one country with the story of what America means
 to them.
 Instead of arguing over theory while the uncommitted world goes
 down the Communist drain, let us put the matter to a practical test.
 Give us a year or two to present American ideas to the masses of another
 country with techniques adapted from those that have been so success-
 ful in our own country, and we will soon see which way gets results.
 We must avoid the gross blunders of the Communists-luckily, we

 Americans have a far better product to promote and could make far
 faster headway than they.
 Thank you.
 Mr. IciioRi3. Thank you, Mr. Meyerhoff, for a very interesting and
 important contribution to these hearings, and I might say that I whole-
 heartedly join with former Congressman McKinnon in his appraisal of
 your ability to present your ideas.
 I have a few questions which I would like to develop.  In your
 statement you have indicated that the State Department has failed
 to reach beyond the foreign leaders and the foreign diplomats and
 get to the people. That charge has often been leveled at the State
 Department.
 Don't you feel that- in recent years the State Department has made
 some improvement in that field?
 Mr. MEYFRiioFF. I frankly find little evidence of it.  I spent 2
 years in Europe, went into East Germany, made other studies, and I
 do not feel that the U.S. has made much headway in reaching the
 masses of people.
 As a matter of fact, from everything that I can see -and I could
 give you dozens of notations on this subject from knowledgeable peo-
 ple-our prestige has deteriorated rather than gained.  I cite the
 attacks on our USIA libraries, which apparently are increasing.  I see
 little evidence of the State Department reaching the people of other
 nations more effectively.  I would certainly like to see such evidence.
 I have made these statements in speeches and have had a book on the
 market for 5 months, and I have had no one in Government give me
 any evidence to indicate that my evaluation is wrong.
 Mr. IciioRn. You made a very serious indictment of the USIA and
 its broadcasting policies, namely, your testimony about- the reporting
 of that which is bad in American news, reporting that news abroad.
 I have heard that criticism made of the USIA quite frequently. Not.
 too many months ago that was in the newspapers, criticism made of
 USIA. What. is the date of this Polish pubblication?
 Mr. MEYERiioFF. I would like to comment while I am getting that.
 Mr. IciioRD. Not being on the Foreign Affairs Committee I Haven't
 followed this matter closely, but. I was of the understanding that the
 USIA had made some changes in its presentations abroad.
 Mr. MEY$RiioFF. By the way, that is October 1964.
 Mr. Iciiono. October 1964.
 Mr. AfEYERnoFF. By the way, I want to state that I have looked at
 the records and the backgrounds of these men in USIA and I have
 the deepest respect for all of them. I think they are dedicated. I
 think they are well trained in their fields. I have no criticism of any-
 one in the USIA.
 Mr. IoiioRn. You feel it, is just. R mistake in judgment?
 Mr. MnraRiiorF. I say they are not. skilled in the professions that
 can help improve our image abroad, and have been to some extent in-
 fluenced by their academic or journalistic backgrounds.
 Walter Trolian of the Chicago Tribune reported on Vietnam and
 USIA's newer tactics in the propaganda war over there. In essence,
 he said theCommunists use extensive propaganda to aid IIo Clii Minli ;
 they sing songs in his praise. They quote ioems about him. They
 show him with babies. They show 'him with guerrillas. They show

 him working in his garden. They build him up as a personality to be
 loved. But on our side, we have helicopters broadcasting the message
 of truth to the Vietnamese, often in English, or in dialects that they
 do not understand. And what is more important, the content of these
 messages is ineffective.
 Mr. ICHORD. Of course, you have picked out and put your finger on
 one field of activity, and I do agree with you, but I think the USIA
 does a lot of good work. For example, I just received this morning a
 report from the United States Information Agency. In this report
 it has excerpts from Cuban letters, some of them reading as follows :
 Keep up the good work because all of Cuba can hear you.
 God bless you all.
 There is much need for a program like this where young
 people can learn what unfortunately they do not now teach
 to our land.
 Congratulations for the brilliant workbeing carried on for
 our cause, which is the cause for democracy.
 Mr. MEYERHOFF. May I comment?
 Mr. IouoiD. Yes.
 Mr. MEYERHOFF. When we in advertising appraise a market with
 our techniques, we look at that market as a total thing. If we paid
 too much attention to the few letters that we get, pro or con, we might
 be completely misled.
 Any effort in any direction will motivate letters good and bad, but
 you cannot decide a program that is designed to reach masses of people
 based on these letters. A few letters, pro or con, have no significance
 whatever.
 Mr. IcHoRD. You made a very cogent point about how your think-
 ing will be influenced by the reporting of bad news. I know I had
 that brought home very forcibly to me during the past week, that is,
 you sit up here on the banks of the Potomac and read in the newspapers
 of the crime committed by juveniles. You read of the activity of cer-
 tain beatniks among our schoolchildren and the activities of certain
 college groups fighting for the right to display obscene four-letter
 words, and it is very easy to get the idea that the young generation is
 going to pot.
 During the Easter vacation, I had the opportunity to speak to about
 9,000 high school kids at various schools in my district and I came back
 with the idea that the young kids are not only healthier today physi.-
 cally than the preceding generation; they are more intelligent. They
 are just as strong morally. And your idea was brought home very
 forcibly to me.
 Mr. MEYERHOFF. I agree with you wholeheartedly on what you
 say about our young people.
 Mr. ICHORD. One more question. I would point out to you that the
 bills that have been Introduced would only establish the Freedom
 Academy for a research training and development center. It would
 not be an operational agency. Are you in favor of setting it up as an
 operational agency ?

 Mr..MEYERIIOFF. I can't say that. I am in favor of the training of
 people. I believe it might be well not to make it operational. The
 United States Information Agency could use personnel trained in the
 Freedom Academy.
 Mr. ICIIORD. I might say that I believe that was one of the mis-
 understandings of the State Dc ~artment in its opposition to the bill.
 I think they thought that the freedom Academy would intrude into
 their field of traditional authority.
 Mr.:,-ERIioFF. I do not believe it will.
 Mr. IciroiD. Then you more or less believe that the State Depart-
 ment does have the operational agencies it needs?  You do feel that
 there could be considerable improvement made in their techniques and
 you have suggested here today ways in which their activities a.nd
 procedures could be improved.
 Mr. MEYERIIOFF. Yes. sir.
 Mr. IcnoRD. Do you have any questions?
 Mr. Crwsox. lSIr. Chairman, I have a number of them.  In fact, I
 wish we could spend a long time together here and explore some of your
 ideas in connection with your testimony.
 I jotted down just a couple of notes because of your application
 of a different principle than this record that USIA put out, where you
 would do what the old song said, "Accentuate the positive and elimi-
 nate the negat ive."  I approve of that.
 However, now let me move on into something that might appear
 just to he a little argumentative.  I think the masses of people
 to whom I have talked feel tliat we have failed in the world to sell
 the United States of America and freedom and the kind of choices
 that we have to make in this country.  Because of that failure they
 are making demands upon us who are in elective posit ions.
 I am sure these same demands are being made upon people who hold
 appointed positions.  If the masses make this kind of complaint, why
 haven't you been able to sell your program to the USIA?  You are
 in the selling business.
 Mr. l*{EYERIrOFF. As I have pointed out, there has been strong op-
 position in Government to the effective use of people from the adver-
 tising and selling industries.
 Your statement. really says, "'Why hasn't the advertising profession
 who have spoken out in f leis area
 Mr. CL WSON. "been able to sell their product?"
 Mr. MEYERIIOFF. The advertising business, a number of rears ago,
 decided to demonstrate to Government through the Advertising Coun-
 cil that it can be an effective force in selling ideas. The Advertising
 Council has been doing an exiremly effectik a job for Government and
 publio service objectives on the home front. But these mere demonstra-
 tions apparently have not convinced people in Government that these
 great industries can help our image abroad. I see indications that- the
 time is ripe to bring this story to the public in a more forceful and direct
 manner. And I am urging our industry to take dynamic steps in this
 direction. At present, there are only individuals interested in promot-
 ing it.
 Mr. CLAWSON. Excuse me just a minute. Air. 'Meyerhoff, you mean
 interested in this particular area of the advertising industry getting
 into the field of Government.?

 PROVIDING FOR A FREEDOM COMMISSION          121
 Mr. MEYEanoFF. Yes, we sell our clients' products, not ourselves,
 primarily.
 Mr. CLAWSON. The reason I question that is because I can remem-
 ber, ever since I have been able to understand the language, "It pays
 to advertise." That is a common household propaganda piece as far
 as I am concerned, and I think you have done a good job in selling
 your own product.
 Mr. MEYERiioFF. Thank you.
 Mr. CLAWSON. Let me hasten to tell you that you and I are on the
 same side.  I want to sell our program, too, and I want to do it the best
 way we can. I think perhaps we have explored this one.
 Mr. MFYERiioFF. I had hoped that my book was a way of getting
 the attention of the people and stirring up enough people to get back of
 the idea.
 Mr. CLAWSON. We are talking about two areas of advertising. One,
 of course, is unrelated at the present time, by using immediately what
 you call a professional persuader, and this brought all kinds of visions
 to me. I can remember the persuaders that some of the teenage kids
 used ; it was a pair of brass knuckles or a tow chain or something of this
 kind. You propose the use of this information for some immediate
 exploration or propaganda tool by the Government agencies involved,
 and the second approach is through the Freedom Academy, the bills
 that we are considering now.
 A witness prior to this has indicated that he would like to see the
 Academy established and that every person possible go through this
 Academy, whether they are with a corporation that has a business in
 some foreign country or an oil company that is exploring some oil in-
 terests in other areas or a construction company or a mining company
 or with the State Department.
 He would make that compulsory as far as the State Department is
 concerned, but all of these who are going overseas in any capacity,
 private ar public, should take advantage of the Freedom Academy
 facilities in order to learn their function in dealing with these foreign
 nations and peoples of foreign lands.
 Would you subscribe to that philosophy?
 Mr. MFYFRIrorr. I certainly would.  The point is that the more
 people that are aware of the problem and the more people that have
 an understanding of this problem, the better we are going to be able
 to fight it.
 However, I maintain that it also must be undertaken by an opera-
 tional organization that does this job within Government, even though
 we will be training people in the private sector or in the various
 Government departments to be aware of the fight that is being waged
 against us, because I don't think people understand it at the present.
 Mr. CLAWSON. Thank you.
 Mr. MEYFRrroFF. However as a group to fight this very well-orga-
 nized Communist propaganda organization, I don't see the Freedom
 Academy becoming too useful fora little while.
 Mr. CLAWSON. That is the reason you want some immediate action.
 Mr. MEYERUOFF. I want immediate action.  I am trying to separate
 the two things.

 Mr. ICIIORD. Thank you very much, Mr. Clawson. I might. point
 out to you, Mr. Meyerhof, that the director of the committer staff just
 handed to me a copy of your book] The Strategy o f Persuasion, and it
 is on the Library of Congress waiting list of books. A notice slip in
 this copy states that "The long list of Senators and Representatives

 I am going to put myself on that list.

 Mr. Icrtoan. I would like to have a copy.  I would also suggest that
 it. might be a good idea if you had sufficient copies to send the same

 to this work that we are all interested in.
 You have many ideas which I think can be accepted. Thank you

 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN H. BIICHANAN, JR., U.S.
 REPRESENTATIVE FROM ALABAMA
 Mr. BucHAxAN. Mr. Chairman, because of the lateness of the hour
 and the most fascinating testimony of the previous witness if you
 would like to further question him and let me come at a later time I
 would be most happy to do so.
 Mr. Icnnoan. I think we can go ahead and proceed with your state-
 ment, Congressman Buchanan.
 (At this point, Mr. Clawson left tltehearing room.)
 Mr. BuciiANAN. I first want. to compliment the previous witness
 for this very fine statement and will look forward with you, Mr. Chair-
 man, to reading this book.  I think perhaps the wisest statement. I
 could make in following him is simply to say Amen.
 In the language of business and of advertising, we do have a product
 that is worth selling, a superior product, and one which deserves
 the finest skills of the advertising art.  In the language of politics, we
 have a platform that is the right platform and all the issues are on
 our side.
 In the language of the church, we have a message to proclaim that
 I believe to be the truth and, in contrast to world communism, a matter
 of good as over against evil.  I happen to believe in the inherent power
 of good to overcome evil or truth to cast out error, as light might cast
 out darkness.
 Mr. Chairman, if truth is to triumph in our time in this death strug-
 le between our way of freedom and the way of totalitarianism that
 has taken such deadly form in what we call communism and if in our
 time good is to overcome evil, it seems to me that we need to learn the

 danger that we could easily see from the work of Hitler or Stalin, the
 danger of lies skillfully told, of evil operating under the mask of good,
 the danger of letting the other side, which is the wrong side, consist-
 ently employ superior techniques and so skillfully fight a battle they
 ought to lose that we find ourselves continually on the losing side
 instead.
 I don't think there is any question in your mind or the mind of the
 gentleman here or of any American as to the innate superiority of our
 way of life over the way of communism.  I would say that we have a
 country worth keeping and a way worth preserving.
 I am sure on this we would all agree. But the disconcerting fact is
 that world communism has made great progress in overcoming the
 forces of freedom. Starting at the turn of the century with a hand-
 ful of men, Lenin, with the ideas of Marx and Engels, began to
 move forward.  By 1917, with a few thousand, he was able to takeover
 the government of Russia.  World communism has continued to move
 forward until in this day some 40 million people are members of the
 Communist Party.  More than one billion people, more than one
 third of the world's people, more than 25 percent of the earth's surface,
 and some 20-odd nations are now under the control of the Communists.
 (At this point Mr. Clawson returned to the hearing room..)
 Mr. BUCHANAN. Therefore, it would seem most obvious to me that
 this is a struggle we appear to be losing in light of the progress in
 conquering territory and in subjecting people that world communism
 has made.  Yet this force standing over against our force, the force of
 our free society, is one which ought to lose because of the inherent
 superiority of our way of freedom.
 I think there are three mainstreams of our culture that are worth
 preserving and that stand in utter. contrast to the Communist way.
 These three causative forces have worked together toward making
 America what it is, toward creating this land of freedom, toward trans-
 forming a wilderness into a great nation, and a dream of human
 freedom into a reality here.
 The first mainstream of influence, I would say, would be the Judaeo-
 Christian tradition of religious faith and morality. We are tradi-
 tionally a people of faith and a people who have certain moral con-
 cepts as to right versus wrong and truth versus that which is false.
 We are people with strong traditions of religious faith and morality,
 and this has gone into the basic framework of Western civilization,
 has run like a golden thread through its fabric, has been a main-
 stream of influence in the creation of this American society.
 With due respect to the heathen in our midst, I think this is a rather
 important aspect of our society, and without prejudicing the right of
 the heathen I would say that it is one of the ways in which our
 society stands in contrast to the way of communism because commu-
 nism is a system. of militant atheism and it is in its essence and at its
 heart an atheistic philosophy and movement.
 Its leaders have repeatedly reaffirmed this fact about communism.
 It is not only militantly atheistic, but where it comes into control, into
 power, it attempts to limit and at times, as in Red China, to brutally
 persecute religious groups and to maintain a basic attitude at best of
 tolerance and at worst of hostility in the form of persecution towards
 religious groups.

 This, I think, is one clear ray in which our society stands over
 against and above the Communist way, and in like fashion in the
 matter of morality. The people who created this country were people
 who had a certain sense of moral value.  Our traditional concepts
 of morality, of right, are not shared by the philosophy of communism.
 Right, according to Communist philosophy and practice, is that which
 serves the interest of the Communist movement, whether it be to lie or
 to deceive or even to kill vast, numbers of human beings. There is no
 concept of individual liberty, of individual human dignity, of indi-
 vidual people having inalienable or unalienable rights, such as those of
 life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but a total relativism in the
 moral outlook of world communism. Over against America's tradi-
 tion of religious faith and morality we have the militant atheism and
 the complete relativism of the Communist outlook.
 I would say the second mainstream of influence that has made our
 society what it is, is our traditional political system of liberty under
 law, guaranteed by the Constitution.  As the basic law of our land,
 the Constitution guarantees representative government at every level
 and the maximum possible degree of individual liberty under law. It
 further guarantees ggovernment by law and not by man, of the divi-
 sion of the powers of government to make certain that liberties of the
 people are protected from too much concentration of power in any
 branch of government or at any level of government-.  This basic
 American political system which has put. its emphasis on individual
 liberty to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the rights of
 other individuals, has put its emphasis on representative government
 at every, level, in total contrast to the totalitarian system of world
 communism, it system designed to first create a strong state in the
 dictatorship of the proletariat.  In time, after the proletariat has
 taken over, the state is to wither away.
 Of course I don't- need to instruct, this committee that world com-
 munism has consistently in the past, and will consistently in the future,
 become stuck at the dictatorship stage and will develop a dictatorial
 clique which retains control and a totalitarian system which remains
 totalitarian.  In utter contrast to our American way, communism is It
 system in which individuals have no certain rights or certain liberties,
 in which they have no choice as to leadership, and in which concepts
 we take for granted in this society of representative government, of
 individual liberty, of local self-government, are totally absent from the
 scene.
 The third mainstream I would say would be our system of free
 and private enterprise.  This system-you may call it capitalism or
 free enterprise or what you will-which has been a very significant
 factor in the transformation of a wilderness into a great. nat-ion, in the
 creation of the great- middle class in our society for the first time in
 world history, in raising the level of the standard of living of the
 average American family to such a high level that it is higher than
 that of the average fancily of any great nation in all the world's
 history. This American way of economic freedom has fit-hand in glove
 with our system of religious and of political liberty.  This third
 mainstream has helped to make our Nation what- it is and has been .a
 resounding success.

 Karl Marx, many years ago, rebelled at early capitalism when he
 saw child labor and when he saw people who constituted the poorer
 class who were stuck at a subsistence, or almost below subsistence,
 level for all their lives. He saw the terrible factory conditions, the
 terrible working hours and conditions, and he looked at this ugly bulb
 of early capitalism and proclaimed it to be wrong.
 He didn't see the flower that was within the bulb. He did not know
 the fragrance or the beauty of the fairest flower of Western civiliza-
 tion, our 20th century America. He looked at the ugly lump of coal
 of early capitalism and proclaimed it dirty and wrong. He didn't see
 the jewel that was within that lump of coal. We know the flower and
 we know the jewel and, therefore, we have every reason and right to
 seek to preserve that which has proven itself to be a success.
 Mr. Chairman, in the year in which Jesus Christ was born I am in-
 formed there were some 250,000 able-bodied men in the city of Rome
 alone living on the public dole of corn. This system, developing to-
 ward collectivism and toward a pretty thoroughgoing welfare state
 even for able-bodied persons, was one of the things, as I understand it,
 which served to bring about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
 The idea of collectivism is an old one, not a new idea in human his-
 tory, and has not been a resounding success in any instance of which
 I am aware. A system of economic freedom, of political freedom, of
 religious freedom, of the many-splendored freedoms which we know in
 this country, has been a resounding success and is worth keeping.
 Our country is a place of goodness and of freedom, a golden land for
 all its citizens, a land of hope and a land of progress and a land of
 opportunity, still dynamic, still moving forward, still crossing new
 frontiers. There is utter contrast between this way, which seems to
 be so much light and so much goodness, and the way which. is a way
 of totalitarianism, a way of abrogation and violation of all human
 rights that I can understand, the way of world communism. Given
 the fact that this seems to be light versus darkness and good versus
 evil pretty clearly, it is strange to me that we could be losing this bat-
 tle, and yet in terms of territory and numbers and time, we still are on
 the losing side of the greatest struggle which I believe our way of life
 has ever had, the greatest challenge to our system and to our Nation
 that it has known, this challenge of world communism.
 What is the trouble?  What is wrong?  What is the basic reason
 we are apparently losing this battle for our way of life against a way
 that is evil, a totalitarian way that is wrong?
 I do not claim to be a seer or prophet, but may I say that it would
 seem to me that one of the things, as I look down the road ahead, that
 would lead me to have deep fears for the survival of freedom is the
 fact that we are not, as the gentleman has previously testified, sales-
 men for freedom.
 In the language of the church, we have a message to proclaim that
 is good and right, but we aren't doing a very good job of proclaiming
 it.  With all due respect to the agencies of our Government, filled
 with many dedicated people who are sincerely trying to do this, I
 think one of the problems is lack of adequate preparation and train-
 ing for this particular job of selling the American system to the world.
 I have noticed, for example, this policy of the U.S. Information

 Agency. I have had them explain to me why it is they accentuate
 the negative sometimes and report the bad news about America..
 They say it is going to be reported anyway, that it is quickly reported
 by AP and lUPI and other news agencies, and they feel in order to
 accomplish their purpose they must admit the facts, admit the truth,
 join in reporting the news, and then as they can in time try to explain
 it satisfactorily and give the best. possible interpretation to the world.
 This is one kind of strategy, but I have driven a fair number of
 Chevrolets and I have never driven one yet, that wasn't hard to start
 on a cold morning, and I have never yet seen an advertisement by Gen-
 eral Motors or Chevrolet that: "Of course, our cars are hard to start on
 a winter morning, but otherwise they are pretty good automobiles."
 I expect it will be a cold day in July before I ever see such an adver-
 tisement.. I have driven several ears of another make, and have yet
 to drive one of that make on which the wheels would stay in balance.
 You just can't   in to keep the wheels of that particular automobile in
 balance, but I have never seen them advertise the fact.
 I think we need to recognize the mote in our eye along with the
 beam that is in the Communist. eye and I think we need to recognize
 the  at. of the things that. are wrong with our societyy along with the
 camel that is wrong with their society, but. I don't. t.Ihink we need to
 strain at the gnat and swallow the camel and to give equal attention
 to the mote in our eye and the beam in their eye in our attemlit. to be
 fair and to make certain that the world understands we understand
 what is wrong with our own society.
 Our tremendous superiority over the way of tyranny and totalitari-
 anism makes me feel we can be justified in accentuating the positive,
 in devoting our full attention to bringing the world's attention to the
 things, the very great many things, that are right about American
 society.
 I believe the creation of this Commission or this Academy can serve
 well toward that. end. With the Peace Corps and its emphasis on
 person-to-person and project-by-project diplomacy, with the great
 value that can come from person-to-person salesmanshi  of our way
 of life and its superiority to people all over this world through the
 Peace Corps and other like activities, with the U.S. Information
 Agency and its vital responsibility in this area, it seems that the per-
 sonnel of such agencies really need this kind of training to be able to
 effectively, and with the best techniques of advertising or, if you
 please, of evangelism, sell our point of view and get our message
 across.
 We have something that is worth selling, and it needs to get across
 to the people of the world, and I believe specific training toward
 this end could be very valuable toward the survival of human free-
 dom and toward making the world understand and be more recep-
 tive toward the truth and rightness of the American way.
 It would seem to me that everyone who is in foreign service, and I
 would concur with those who have testified-they feel this would be of
 value to people overseas, whether they be working for private com-
 panies or for the United States Government in some capacity-if we
 could have this made available, this special training made available,
 to all such persons and require it for those who in the official service
 of this Government. go overseas as our representatives, if we could have

 it available for all Americans so that each of us could be a salesman
 or an evangelist for the way we know to be right against the way
 we know to be wrong, it seems to me it could have great value not
 only from an American point of view, but from the larger point of
 view of fulfilling our responsibility toward working that all men may
 some day know the freedom which we enjoy and working toward the
 fulfillment of the responsibility of protecting the inalienable rights
 of all men in every nation to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
 I for one am not satisfied with a rearguard defensive action. I
 cannot rest so long as millions of our fellow citizens all over this world
 live under the heel of tyranny and I feel it is time for us to go on the
 offensive in this war for freedom. It seems to me to fight an offen-
 sive war we must have training in the art of warfare. Thank you,
 Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. ICHCRD. Thank you very much, Congressman. Buchanan. As a
 minister as well as a Congressman and member of this committee and
 author of one of the bills, all of which are similar, the committee ap-
 preciates very much receiving your contribution to the record.
 Do you have any questions, Mr. Clawson?
 Mr. CLAW sON. No, in the interest of time, I won't -ask any.
 Mr. ICHCRD. Off the record.
 (Discussion off the record.)
 Mr. BUCHANAN. May I point out two things in my bill, H.R. 6700,
 that are different from other versions so far as I can ascertain just for
 your consideration.
 On page 9, sec. 5, subsection (a)
 Members of the Commission and the Chairman shall be appointed by the Presi-
 dent, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Not more than four
 members, including the Chairman, may be members of any one political party.
 I am not trying to inject politics into this, but having grown up in
 a part of the country where we suffered under the limitations of a one-
 party system, and since we seem to be moving in that direction in this
 country, I thought while we still had two parties left in the country
 that this might be worth including.
 Mr. ICHoRD. Don't the other bills have that provision also ?
 Mr. BUCHANAN. Do they?  I am sorry.  There is a second one then
 on page 19, line 8, which is sec. 11, subsection (b) :
 The personnel referred to in subsection (a) (2) of this section may be employed
 and their compensation fixed without regard to the civil service laws and the
 Classification Act of 1949, as amended.  Such personnel shall receive compensa-
 tion at rates fixed by the Congress.
 I am pretty sure this is different.          Is that not right, Mr. McNamara?
 Mr. MCNAMARA. Yes.
 Mr. BUCHANAN. This simply takes the employees of the Commis-
 sion out from under civil service, with no reflection on the civil
 service.  I thought this might be a better arrangement for people
 who might need high skills, and so forth, that there might be left to
 the Commission this more complete freedom in employing persons
 working in this area.
 Mr: IcHORD. I would like to have from the State Department, if they
 are opposed to this bill, a very critical analysis of the legislation.  I
 have even thought about sending it around to some of the Members
 that, I thought might be opposed to the bill when it hits the floor and

 encouraging them to come before the committee to discuss the pros and
 cons of it.
 Mr. CLAWSON. Would it be in order to make such a proposal and ask
 the director to advise these folks and ask them to appear before us?
 Mr. IcnoRu. I would be glad to do that myself, send & 'copy of the
 legislation and a brief analysis of the bill and give them an oppor-
 tunity and ask them to appear and get some testimony on the other
 side.  There is bound to be a lot of opposition to this bill or it would
 have cleared the Congress by now since it has been around since 1959,
 so let's get it out..
 Thank you very much.
 Mr. BQCriaNAN. Thank you.
 Mr. Iciionn. The meeting will stand adjourned until the further
 call of the chair.

 The CHAIRMAN. Please come to order. Today we renew hearings
 on various Freedom Academy bills which have been introduced.
 There is widespread interest in these proposals as evidenced by the
 authors of the bills; namely, Representatives Herlong, Gubser, Ichord,
 Boggs, Gurney, Clausen, Brooks, and Buchanan. I think there are
 others.
 We are extremely fortunate and honored to have here today the
 Ambassador to Cuba in the years 1957 to 1959, the Honorable Earl E.
 T. Smith.
 Ambassador, we are very pleased that you could take time out to
 give us your views on these proposals. With your experience and
 background and dedication to the principles of our country, I might
 say that you add luster to an already long list of people in Govern-
 ment,, former Ambassadors, former military people, former high civil-
 ians who have appeared in these hearings.
 We welcome you here and look forward to receiving your views.
 Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. You may proceed in your own way, Mr. Ambas-
 sador. We will probably defer any questions until after you have
 testified. Make your presentation in your own way.

 STATEMENT OF HON. EARL L T. SMITH
 Mr. SMrrll. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee : I ap-
 preciate the invitation to testify before this distinguished committee
 in behalf of the Freedom Academy bills. Shall I just read my state-
 ment first?
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes.
 Mr. SMITH. I attended the Taft School and Yale University. My
 business is investments. I have been a member of the New York Stock
 Exchange for more than 35 years. During World War II, I served
 in the United. States Army and the United States Air Force, attain.-
 ing the rank of lieutenant colonel, with 18 months of overseas duty.
 I have been active in politics both on the national level and in my
 home State of Florida.  I have received appointments from three
 Presidents: as a member of the War Production Board (before Pearl
 Harbor) by Franklin D. Roosevelt; to accompany Vice President
 Nixon in 1956 as a member of the American delegation to the inaugu-
 ration of Brazilian President Kubitschek in Rio de Janeiro by Dwight
 D. Eisenhower; as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
 to Cuba by Dwight D. Eisenhower ? I was personally selected by
 President Kennedy to serve as Ambassador to Switzerland-later
 declined. I am the author of The Fourth Floor, which is an account of
 the Castro Communist revolution and is well documented to show
 that the Castro Communist revolution need never have occurred.
 In reference to the Freedom Academy bills, I am not an expert on
 these bills.  However, I am very much in favor of the general pur-
 pose of the bills, which I understand is:
 (I) To greatly increase the scope and depth of training of cold
 war personnel in the now forms of struggle i
 (II) To provide training for private citizens so they can partici-
 pate more effectively in the global struggle;
 (III) To give training to foreign nationals who will have to bear
 the main burden of the struggle in their respective countries;
 (IV) To explore, through research, the full range of methods and
 means that can be utilized -by the Government: and the private sector
 to achieve our twin global objectives of defeating all forms of Com-
 munist political warfare, insurgency, and subversion while seeking
 to build free, independent., and viable nations.
 (At this point., Mr. Pool entered the hearing room.)
 Mr. SMITSL We very much need a United States graduate school for
 advanced political study and training, which is called the Freedom
 Academy.
 In my o inion, a strong leftwing political philosophy took root in
 the United States as a result of the world depression of 1932, the
 inhumane activities of Adolph Hitler, and World War II.  In some
 cases it represented a sincere effort to better the general conditions of
 the American people, but in other areas it was undoubtedly Commu-
 nist inspired.
 One of the major errors of judgment of doctrinaire leftwing
 thinkers is their belief that all revolutions taking place throughout
 the world are either democratic, or Communist, and that the United
 States should support, aid, and abet. all democratic revolutions. It is
 not that simple.  Many revolutionary groups which call themselves

 Approved For R9     i260D(17/A 3raDAe iED@&MOf    R000600d 4001-8
 democratic are in, reality. Marxist oriented or are just the means to
 satisfy some power-hungry individual.  This is. what happened in
 Cuba, and this is why the United States was primarily responsible
 for the success of the Castro Communist revolution, granting that the
 Batista government was losing strength from within because of
 corruption.
 I mention Cuba because it serves as an example of what can happen
 throughout Latin America and .why a Freedom Academy is vitally
 important to the United States.
 Castro was not the only alternative to Batista. There were many
 alternate solutions.  The Castro Communist revolution need never
 have occurred.  That it did was, to a surprising degree, due to the
 policy of many in critical State Department positions.
 These officials of the "fourth floor" believe that a leftist dictator is
 better than a rightist dictator.  Incredible as it seems, they even
 believe that a leftist dictator who is anti-American is a better gamble
 than a rightist dictator who is friendly to the United Staes.
 They look upon a leftist dictator as being progressive. They were
 determined to have the revolution succeed.  Their official responsi-
 bility should be determined by what is beneficial to, and in the best
 interest of, the United States.  But many of these State Department
 career men on the "fourth floor" determine our foreign policy by
 what fits their doctrinaire views of the future world. Their peculiar
 philosophy does not depend on reason, logic, actual facts, or a. realistic
 appraisal of a situation.
 Its source of inspiration is primarily an emotional one. It is dif-
 ficult to understand this political philosophy from an American point
 of view.
 I testified to the Senate that I had learned from experience and ob-
 servation that our policies are determined by influential individuals in
 the lower echelons of the State Department in their day-by-day actions.
 By the time the higher officials receive them, policies have already been
 made and they have to live by them.
 The Dominican Republic is another case in point. The President
 of the United States stated, according to an Associated Press release of
 May 3, 1965, that :
 The revolution started out as an action dedicated to social justice, but it took
 a very tragic turn when the Communists saw a chance to create more disorder and
 seized control. What began as a democratic revolution was taken over and really
 seized by a band of Communist conspirators.
 If the policy of the United States is to continue to aid and abet so-
 called democratic revolutions in the hope that democracy will follow,
 then it is essential that we have the Freedom Academy so that the
 United States will be thoroughly familiar with, and know in advance,
 the origin and nature of each revolutionary group.  The United
 States risks its survival on such knowledge.
 Neither the State Department nor the CIA would take a realistic
 view of the Castro Communist revolution. My reports to Washington
 were that the present policy of the State Department would only bene-
 fit the Communists. The CIA reports out of Havana, following a
 doctrinaire position, were that the revolution was not Communist con-
 trolled. This is not meant as a criticism of these great departments
 of Government. Insufficient attention has been given to the long-range

 ved Forfk%WMG2(@JO/fal4EgWR@46R000600070001-8
 research and training program which underlies Communist capabilities
 in political warfare.
 Mr. Lionel Soto, who, as I recall, was the .Minister for Education
 under Castro, in an article appearing in goeialist Cuba [Cuba Socia-
 i;Bta] in November 1961, bragged that during the last 5 years of the
 Batista regime, the Communists. operated the highly important Na-
 tional Cadre School inside Havana and graduated some 200 selected
 cadres without the operation being discovered by the Batista police.
 To my knowledge, BIiAC (Bureau of Repression of Communist Ac-
 tivities) was also unaware of these activities.
 If The Freedom Academy had been established in 1954, as origi-
 nally proposed, then by 1958 a number of Cubans from various orga.
 nizations would have graduated from the Freedom Academy, for
 example: student leaders, labor leaders, businessmen, journalists,
 et cetera.  These graduates would have been throughly grounded
 in the techniques of Communist political warfare and insurgency
 and, even more important, well versed in the methods and means that:
 free men properly use to defeat these techniques. I believe they could
 have made the better elements of the anti-Batista forces aware of
 the Communist infiltration and Communist. control of the Castro
 movement (known as the 26th of July Movement).  It is incorrect
 to assume that the only opposition to Batista was Castro and his
 followers.  A powerful anti-Batista element existed that was not
 terroristic. It represented the middle class and the intelligentsia of
 the country. From the time Castro landed in the Province of Oriente
 in December 1956, the State Department received reports of probable
 Communist infiltration and exploitation of the 26th of July Movement.
 The State Department was cognizant of Fidel Castro's Communist
 affiliations since the bloody, Communist-inspired uprising in Bogota
 known as the "Bogotazo" of 1948.
 Reports on Fidel Castro's, Raul Castro's, and Che Guevara's Com-
 munist affiliations were provided by Ambassadors to Cuba. Mexico,
 probably Colombia, and many other sources, including the State De-
 part.mcnt.'s own Bureau of Intelligence and Research. If the Freedom
 Academy had been in existence, a number of persons within the na-
 tional security apparatus of the United States Government would
 have graduated from the Academy.  As a result of their training,
 they would have been better able to evaluate what, was going on in
 Cuba and, because of their evaluation, might, well have been responsi-
 ble for altering the operational thinking of the United States Govern-
 ment insofar as Cuba was concerned.
 Today, with Cuba and the Dominican Republic before us as shock-
 ing examples, the. United States should be training men from every
 country in Latin America so that we may avoid repeating our
 mistakes.
 Communists have intensively trained their leadership groups and
 cadres in advance schools for many years. We must train our people
 for self-protection.  Klirushchev said, "We will bury you."  Only
 through education on Communist tactics and operations will we prove
 him wrong.
 I would like to point out another area of responsibility in which the
 Freedom Academy could be very important to our future security.
 That area is not. a preventive one, but a corrective one. Today, Cuba
 has been a Communist nation for more than 5 years. During this
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8

 period, generations of children have been raised who have never read
 or heard the truth. They know only one side of the coin-the Com-
 munist side. If today Fidel Castro and the Fidelistas were elimi-
 nated, it would take time to decommunize a nation whose citizens
 have been in an "intellectual prison" for many years.  Up to now,
 what program has the United States evolved to reeducate these
 people .
 If today we freed Cuba, what program have we worked out to help
 reeducate the Cuban people?  The Freedom Academy would be in-
 valuable through research and training to aid such a plan for rehabili-
 tion and reeducation.
 I heartily endorse the Ichord-Boggs-Herlong Freedom Commission
 and Freedom Academy Act..
 In closing may I quote from an address given by President John F.
 Kennedy before the National Press Club on April 20, 1961:
 We dare not fail to see the insidious nature of this new and deeper struggle.
 We dare not fail to grasp the new concepts, the new tools, the new sense of
 urgency we will need to combat it-whether in Cuba or South Viet-Nam.  And
 we dare not fail to realize that this struggle is taking place every day, without
 fanfare, in thousands of villages and markets * * * and in classrooms all over
 the globe.
 *            *            *            *            *
 No greater task faces this country or this administration. * * * Too long we
 have fixed our eyes on traditional military needs, on armies prepared to cross
 borders, on missiles poised for flight. Now it should be clear that this is no
 longer enough-that our security may be lost piece by piece, country by country,
 without the firing of a single missile or the crossing of a single border.
 We intend to profit from this lesson.  We intend to reexamine and reorient
 our forces of all kinds, our tactics and our institutions here in this com-
 munity.  We intend to intensify our efforts for a struggle in many ways more
 difficult than war * * *.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Ambassador, I take it that you are not express-
 ing a belief that the revolutions you refer to are all supported by the
 State Department because the Department personnel are, in and of
 themselves, leftist or pro-Communist?
 Mr. SMITH. No, sir, not at all.  I think it is lack of proper under-
 standing.  Are you now referring, Mr. Chairman, to the people I am
 talking about in my book, The Fourth Floor?
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes.  Let us talk about them because those are the
 ones you refer to specifically.
 Mr. SMITH. The Fourth Floor must be taken symbolically.  The
 Fourth Floor identifies the State Department officers or secondary
 officials who determine our Latin American policy.  I am not in any
 way intimating, and never have intimated, that they are or even have
 Communist leanings.
 I believe supporting so-called democratic. revolutions is partly due
 to lack of proper education and knowledge of communism.  Such
 support implements our policy as it has been and, I believe, it is today.
 And I would like, Mr. Chairman, to explain this in. more detail.
 This policy of the United States is based on the premise, I believe,
 number one, that the old status quo in the world no longer exists.
 I agree with that.  This implies that the classes are no longer in
 control.  It is now the masses.
 Number two, that revolutions are taking place all over the world
 and that all revolutions are either democratic or Communist revo-

 lutions; and, number three, it is our duty as the leaders of the free
 nations of the world to aid and abet all democratic revolutions.
 If it is our policy to bring about the overthrow of rightist dictators
 in the hope that democracy will follow, then we must be prepared to
 take whatever steps are necessary to preserve law and order until
 a new government has been established.  Otherwise, we leave a vacuum
 for the Communists to gain control.
 If we are going to aid and abet all so-called democratic revolutions
 or democratic revolutionary groups, then the State Department and
 the CIA must be thoroughly familiar with the origin and nature of
 each revolutionary group.  Cuba is a shocking example that they were
 not.
 I believe, if the Freedom Academy Act and the. Freedom Academy
 Commission bill were enacted, that' the United States would be far
 better prepared to know more about the origin and nature of indi-
 vidual revolutionary groups.
 This foreign policy which I have just outlined is more or less spelled
 out in the State Department white paper on Cuba of April 1961.
 So far, where we have been successful in removing rightist dic-
 tators, we have left. a. vacuum in which the Communists gain control.
 By this I mean that the United States should be prepared-when
 rightist dictators are removed--to support a broadly based provisional
 government to function until such time as general elections have been
 held.
 The CHAIRMAN. And your point is that the establishment of the
 Freedom Academy would provide a central point where training,
 research, and development of techniques and ideas could bring about
 the things you advocate?
 Afr. Sarrrir. Yes, sir; I agree with your statement 100 percent. The
 Freedom Academy is necessary so that we may better recognize so-
 called democratic revolutionary groups for what they really are.
 Until the President- of the ITnited States moved our troops into the
 Dominican Republic we did leave such a vacuum in that country.
 To get back to your question, I believe if we gave training to foreign
 nationals so that they may be forewarned and know how to cope with
 the Communists, they would obviously be much better prepared to
 function.  With guidance from Freedom Academy graduates, the
 broadly based provisional government would be much better prepared
 to maintain law and order until such time as a democratic government
 is established to carryon the affairs of the nation.
 The CHATRM tN. Now, the State Department has submitted a letter
 to the committee outlining its reasons for opposing these bills.  Did
 you examine them or did you read that letter and would you care to
 comment on it?
 Mr. SarrTu. I have only seen the letter this morning and read it
 twice. This is the first, time that it was brought to my attention. I
 would be happy to make one or two comments.
 On page 1, paragraph 3, the letter states :
 The President has given to the Department of State a primary role in mar-
 shalling all of our resources to these flelds which cut across many broad areas
 of government responsibility. * * *
 Obviously the State Department is naturally jealous of its own
 prerogative.

 On page 2, paragraph 1, the letter states :
 The Freedom Commission proposals place great stress upon the mobilization
 of private citizens-domestic and foreign-to fight the cold war, and upon a
 systematic orientation of our citizens against communism. The proposals con-
 template that these tasks be undertaken on, a large scale by the Executive
 branch of the government.  While it is very useful in certain circumstances to
 train private U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, our primary need-and hence
 our first priority-is to improve in all possible ways the training of government
 personnel involved in the day-to-day operation of our foreign affairs.
 Well, as I understand the Freedom Academy bill and the Freedom
 Academy Commission, the Academy would give much broader train-
 ing and training in depth and scope than the Foreign Service schools
 are set up to do.
 I believe there has been a great deal of testimony before this commit-
 tee to that effect.
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes; and I think you would agree that, under our
 Constitution and based on your experience as a former Ambassador,
 that under no circumstances could this Freedom Academy overshadow,
 take over, or interfere with the operation of foreign policy by the
 executive department.  That would not be the purpose of the bill.
 Mr. SMITH. No, sir; as I understand, the Freedom Academy would
 not encroach at all upon the operations of the State Department.
 The CHAIRMAN. I prefer your word that it would not "encroach"
 on the jurisdiction and traditional constitutional provisions vesting the
 conduct of forei  affairs in the executive department.
 Mr. SMITH.  Yes.
 The CHAIRMAN. This would be a central point where you can get the
 research, training, and general information over to business, labor,
 people in the educational field, and foreign nationals who, would care
 to understand the other side of the coin, as you express it.
 Mr. SMITH. Yes.
 Mr. Chairman, I also believe there has been objection to the training
 of foreign nationals.  The statement has been made that when they
 return to their own respective countries the charge would be made
 that they are stooges of Yankee imperialism.  It would seem to me
 that if these foreign nationals are trained in the State Department it
 would give even more weight to those charges.
 Of course those charges aren't true, but it would give more weight
 if they were trained by the State Department than if they were trained
 by the Freedom Academy. I don't know if that is a valid accusation,
 but at least that is my first reaction.
 Then, as far as research is concerned, it seems to me that under the
 Freedom Academy the research goes much?beyond the normal State
 Department operation.
 Then in the next to the last paragraph, the letter states that :
 The [State] Department doubts the value of any effort to centralize and
 standardize the dissemination of information in such areas. This would appear
 to be a marked departure from the traditional role of the Federal Government
 in the field of political education.
 They are speaking of the problem raised by several of the Freedom
 Commission bills regarding Federal control. "Under the provision
 entitled `Information Center'," the letter states-
 the Freedom Commission would be "authorized to prepare, make and publish
 textbooks and other materials, including training films, suitable for high schools,
 college and community level instruction." * * *

 Well, Mr. Chairman as far as the Freedom Academy is concerned
 thew documents would be factual material on communism whereas
 the State Department puts out. documents designed to its policies. It
 would seem to me this is much more indoctrination than factual mate-
 rial on Communists.
 Those, sir, are about all the comments I would like to make because
 I really have not had an opportunity to study the letter.
 The CHAIRMAN. Now would you care to make an observation or so
 with reference to the Dominican Republic situation, as related to
 the a ~plicability of this bill if it had been law years ago?
 Mr. S>,rrrnr. I would like to, but not in great detail because you are
 going to question the former Ambassador to the Dominican Republic;
 and he obviously knows more about. the situation than I do.
 The CHArRMAN. Yes.
 Mr. SMITE. I would just like to say that in September of 1963 I
 wrote an article for the New York Journal American, which appeared
 4 days after Juan Bosch was removed. At that time I wrote that all
 Americans should welcome the overthrow of Juan Bosch. I pointed
 out then, and I would like to point out again now that, after the
 assassination of Trujillo, the U.S.  olicyinake.rs encouraged the re-
 moval of President Balaguer of the Republic.  They feared. that
 Balaguer would become a rightist. dictator because he had served as
 President of the Republic under the administration of Trujillo.
 Once again, as in Cuba, the U.S. was prepared to gamble on an
 ambitious leftiving politician in order to help the Dominican revolu-
 tion succeed.  So President Bosch was elected, and the American
 Government welcomed his election in the hope that our American
 form of democracy would be transplanted and implanted in the Do-
 minican Republic, but. political soil after 30 years of tyranny is and
 and not, fertile.
 Dr. Bosch's affiliations and sympathies with leftist groups were
 well known to the L.S. State Department. and CIA. After his elec-
 tion, Dr. Bosch took no action to keep out Communist societies or to
 prevent the infiltration of communism throughout the country.
 Such Marxist-Leninist organizations as the Movimento Popular
 Dominicano were allowed to take a prominent. part within the politi-
 cal activities of the country.
 Without tracing further the historical events of the country, it is
 obvious that. if Dominican nationals had been trained in depth by the
 Freedom Academy, such nationals would have anticipated, and been
 cognizant of, the Communist infiltration in the Dominican Republic
 and, as a result, the state would have been much better informed as
 to what was going on and what the true nature of the revolutionary
 group was.
 If the Dominic-an Government had been taken over by the Com-
 munists, the whole Caribbean would have become a Red lake. Cuba
 is already a Communist nation. British Guiana is on the brink. If
 the Dominican Republic had become a Communist nation, Haiti
 would soon have been engulfed.  Fortunately, President Johnson
 landed our troops just in time to avert this catastrophe.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Pool.
 Mr. PooL. There is some criticism of the Freedom Academy, not
 for the Freedom Academy, but there is some criticism that I have

 Approved For Releew2W5W/1,3FrOM4WPGV 0   ?9R000600d  001-8
 heard, some people think if you establish a Freedom Academy that
 the extreme leftists or pro-Communist groups could infiltrate that.
 Do you have a comment on that ?
 Mr. SMITH. Mr. Pool, did you say that the criticism comes from
 extreme left and extreme right?
 Mr. Poor.. Well, some people have said this.  I think it is more
 from the right.
 ?           Mr. SMITH. That would be from the extreme right; yes sir.  Of
 course it is very difficult to make happy either the extreme left or the
 extreme right. After all, the President of the United States is going
 to appoint the members of the Freedom Commission, and the mem-
 bers of the Freedom Commission, as I understand it, will have to
 receive approval of the U.S. Senate. FBI checkups will be made on all
 members of the Commission. Any validity to such a fear would also
 apply to other branches of our Government. If the "Commies" are
 going to take over in this country, they will do so in other branches of
 the Government just as quickly as they will in the Freedom Academy.
 Mr. Poor.. I appreciate your remarks for the record.  This is a
 criticism that can be answered by your remarks. I appreciate it.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Ichord.
 Mr. ICHORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Smith, I wish to express our appreciation for your coming be-
 fore the committee and making your valuable contribution. Mr. Pool
 brought up a very interesting point. I would like to comment on the
 history of this legislation and ask for your comments on the same.
 The bill was first introduced back in 1959. In 1960 it passed the
 Senate by a unanimous vote, without a dissenting vote. I don't think
 there was a rollcall on the vote, but there was not a dissenting vote.
 When I first heard the testimony about the bill, I was a little
 skeptical. I thought that the State Department would have some real
 sound objections to the bill. The State Department appeared before
 the committee, and about the only thing I could glean from their
 objections was the point that you mentioned, that they were con-
 cerned that this measure would infringe upon their traditional terri-
 tory or jurisdiction.
 As Mr. Pool indicated, the opposition seems to come from both the
 extreme right and the extreme left.  The extreme right are afraid
 that it might be infiltrated by the extreme left and it would be a
 dangerous situation.
 Of course, if you are going to adopt that view, you might as well
 give up the fight altogether.  I suppose if there is any opposition
 from other than the two extremes, it is in regard to the information
 center in the bill.
 Personally, I don't think the information center is the most im-
 portant part of the bill. I would be willing to delete it in order to
 get the Academy itself so we can do research of training into the
 ways and means of fighting the cold war.
 I would like to have your comment on that point.
 Mr. SMITH. First of all, sir, I believe this bill is so meritorious that
 if the American people were aware of the bill and understood it, they
 would insist upon its passage.

 Mr. Icaoxv. I believe the people are aware of it because in 1960
 the Gallup Poll conducted a polf on it. I think the people voted 10
 to 1 in the Gallup Poll for the legislation. We still don t have it.
 Mr. Serrrnr. This bill has bipartisan support, I think that, after
 all, whether you are a Republican or Democrat or a liberal or a con-
 servative, the people supporting these bills are Americans first.
 That is the reason why they are supporting the bill.
 May I ask you to please repeat again the question you wanted me to
 comment on?  Was that the research-end part of it?
 Mr. Icuon . Mere is the thing that concerns me.  I believe this is
 the 11th day of hearings which started back in February of last year.
 We have no one who has appeared before the committee and tried
 to take this bill apart.  It is my position that no legislation is per-
 fect.  It can always be improved upon.
 I have been a little concerned about not having anyone here giving
 real opposition to the bill.  I would like to know its weak points.
 I am pretty sure there are some weak points.  Any legislation has
 weak points.
 Mr. SlirrIl. I would hate like the dickens to try to take this bill
 apart.  You would not have much to support your views on.  One of
 the objections I see is that it may cost too much. They are talking
 about $35 or $40 million.
 Well, as far as the security of the U.S. is concerned, if we are going
 to worry now about $35 or $40 million, I know many places where
 they can save much more money than that.
 Mr. Icnonn. I feel there is an urgent need for the research and
 training which would be afforded by this bill.
 As I sat on the floor of the House this week and we voted upon
 the $700 million bill, I thought. time and time again that we would
 be in all-out war today if we had anybody to fight..
 Our problem is that we really don't have the enemy out front to
 fight. All people, both of the leftwing philosophy and the rightwing
 philosophy and the middle-of-the-road philosophy, recognize that
 there is a cold war going on today.  What is happening in South
 America, Africa, Southeast. Asia today is merely a fulfillment of the
 promises of Communist leaders themselves.
 Khrushchev said, "We will bury you." He also said, "Peaceful co-
 existence does not mean that there will be peaceful co-existence of
 ideology."
 At the same time he said, "We will support wars of liberation
 against. the capitalist nations all over the world." I think he would
 have more accurately described his intentions if he had said "wars of
 world conquest," but that essentially is his statement.  What is hap-
 pening is proof that he meant what he said.
 Now if we don't learn how to fight a cold war, if the Communists
 continue to knock over one small nation, one emerging nation, after
 the other, it could very well result in a hot war.
 We had testimony the other day put in the record from the State
 Department about schools along this line that the Communists are
 conducting.  How many of these schools, Mr. Director, were there in
 Russia and Czechoslovakia $
 Mr. MCNAMARA. At least seven in Russia; four in Czechoslovakia.
 There are also a minimum of seven in East Germany, three in Hun-

 gary, and two in Bulgaria. The number in Red China is not known,
 and Cuba has at least nine major schools.
 Mr. IcHORD. That is all we know about anyway.
 Mr. McNAMARA. That is right.
 Mr.  IciIORD. The President of the United States the other day
 named the Dominican Republic Communists.  Nearly every one of
 them had attended a political or subversive warfare school in Cuba
 or Russia or some other place where they not only studied propa-
 ganda and subversive warfare, but also such things as how to make
 Molotov cocktails.
 I fear very strongly that if we don't develop more effective cold
 war techniques the probabilities of a hot war will continue to increase.
 Mr. SMITH. Yes, sir; I think the State Department will have to
 come up with more valid objections than have been indicated in this
 letter which I just read.
 Let me ask you a question, Mr. Ichord.  I assume that President
 Kennedy voted for this bill when it came up for a voice vote in the
 Senate.  His statement which I read to this committee was so strong
 that I must assume he voted at that time for the bill.
 Mr. ICIIORD. I would say this, Mr. Smith.  That there was testi-
 mony before this committee by Mr. Grant that his group had a
 conference with President Kennedy.  He was very much interested
 in the legislation, and the testimony was, as I remember it, and I can
 be corrected, that the State Department objected and there was, at
 least it was stated as a matter of opinion, that the State Department
 brought up the Academy of Foreign Affairs as a substitute, which
 does do part of the things contemplated by this bill.
 President Kennedy definitely recognized the need for the leg-
 islation.
 The CHAIRMAN. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ICHORD. Yes.
 The CHAIRMAN. I concur in the concern of my colleague from
 Missouri. I point out that we held hearing after hearing last year,
 again this year.  I issued a press- release on Monday, May 3d, an-
 nouncing that we would have 2 more weeks of hearings, namely, this
 week and next.
 I deliberately included this statement :
 All persons desiring to present testimony on the bills during the hear-
 ings * * * should contact Mr. Francis J. McNamara, Staff Director of the
 Committee * * *.
 The strange thing is this.  Only one person in opposition has
 appeared thus far in person, Mr. Harriman.  His main objection of
 X number of words was, "This would be indoctrination, indoctrina-
 tion, indoctrination."
 This year we have invited some more comments from the State
 Department.  The word "indoctrination" is not used this time.
 I just received a letter, which I now insert in the record, from the
 Department of Defense.  Here is their comment :
 The broad objectives of the proposed legislation are praiseworthy.  How-
 ever, the need for the creation of new agencies for their accomplishment is
 questionable. * * *
 Why, for what reason? What argument?  We are not told.

 They conclude by saying, however, that they "defer to the State
 Department" and wind up the letter by saying :
 The Bureau of the Budget advises that, from the standpoint of the Adminis-
 tration's program, there is no objection to the [the Department of Defense's]
 presentation of this report ? ' '.
 Now I reiterate--everyone in the Congress, the House, the Senate,
 in Government, in the private sector, news media, and every other
 part or segment of our society in America has been given oppor-
 y after opportunity to come forward and testify.
 Ve are going to move next week. They still have 10 days. I don't
 want on the floor any bleeding heart to say how come we were not
 told about it. I now present the letter of the Department of Defense
 for the record.

 GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
 WASHINGTON 1O. Q.
 Honorable Edwin B. Willis
 .Chairemn, Committee on Un-American Activities
 House of Representatives
 Washington, D. C. 20515
 Iris letter is in reply to your request for the views of the Department
 of Defense an H. R. 474, H. R. 1033, H. R. 2215, H. R. 2379'and H. B. 4399,
 all of which propose the creation of a Freedom Commission and a Freedom
 Academy; for the purpose of developing an integrated body of knowledge to
 win the non-military global struggle between freedom and eo?unism, and
 to train government personnel and private citizens for this purpose.
 The broad objectives of the proposed legislation are praiseworthy.  How-
 ever, the need for the creation of new agencies for their accomplishment
 is questionable.  inmost of their functions, the proposed agencies mould
 duplicate the work of existing government and/or private agencies.
 While the Department of Defense questions the need for the establishment
 of a Freedom Camiaiseion and a Freedom Academy to accomplish the objectives
 of the proposed bills ve defer to the State Department and other interested
 agencies more directly concerned for more authoritative views on this
 matter.
 The Bureau of the Budget advises that, from the standpoint of the Adminis-
 tration's program, there is no objection to the presentation of this report
 for the consideration of the Committee.

 Mr. SMITH. What you have just said is very significant, sir.
 Mr. IcHoRD. Mr. Smith, there was one objection that I have heard
 voiced and that was that the Academy could not be conducted as an
 open operation.  The opposition stated that an institution of this
 nature should be a secret operation. Would you care to comment on
 that?
 I point out that this is not an operation agency at all.
 Mr. SMITH. No, this is not an operation agency. I read the testi-
 mony of Admiral Burke. I think lie answered that very well when
 he said the truth doesn't hurt. If you tell the truth, you have nothing
 to be ashamed of.
 Therefore, why shouldn't things be disclosed because we have noth-
 ing to be ashamed of. If the Communists disagree and say the find-
 ings of the Freedom Academy are wrong, then they will have to have
 facts to prove that.
 Mr. ICHORD. Thank you very much.
 The CHAIRMAN. I also insert for the record the press release I
 mentioned, of May 3, 1965.
 (The release follows:)
 [For immediate release, Monday, May 8, 1965]
 COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, U.S. HousE of REPRESENTATIVES,
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 Representative Edwin E. Willis (D-La.), Chairman of the House Committee
 on Un-American Activities, announced today that the Committee will continue
 hearings during the first two weeks of May on various bills to create a Freedom
 Commission and Freedom Academy.  Hearings will then be terminated.
 The Freedom Academy bills would establish a federally-financed cold war
 educational institution where Government officials and key persons from all
 walks of American life, as well as foreign officials and nationals, would receive
 intensive training in Communist cold war objectives, strategy and tactics.  The
 Academy would also have the function of studying and analyzing Communist
 unconventional warfare techniques for the purpose of proposing methods which
 could be utilized by the free world to block or undercut implementation of them.
 Mr. Willis pointed out that the Committee held seven days of hearings on the
 Freedom Academy bills last year, in the course of which thirty-seven witnesses
 testified or submitted statements.  This year, the Committee has held three days
 of hearings, at which nine individuals have testified or submitted statements.
 With the exception of Mr. W. Averell Harriman, who testified for the State
 Department last year, all witnesses have endorsed the bills.
 All persons desiring to present testimony on the bills during the hearings in
 the first two weeks of May should contact Mr. Francis J. McNamara, Staff Di-
 rector of the Committee on Un-American Activities, Room 226, Cannon House
 Office Building, Washington, D.C.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Clawson.
 Mr. CLAWSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In response to Mr.
 Ichord's statement I would like to ask this question.
 As a new member of the committee, I am going to ask the chairman :
 If this has been before us for such a long time, why has not this com-
 mittee acted on it and brought it to the floor?
 The C]aAIRMAN. That is how cautious we want to be, how thorough
 we want to be.  It is a new concept, and we prefer to move with
 caution and be on solid ground.  That is about all the answer I can
 conceive of, that we didn t want to have an onrush of our conceptions.
 I have no preconceptions about this proposal. That was the reason
 for a cautionary and careful, realistic approach to the problem. We

 A oved FoiFFMCQM 2W5/971  v4Z-          #46R000600070001-8
 wanted to give the American public an opportunity to express them-
 selves.
 We have had an expression through the Gallup Poll several years
 ago. We wanted another opportunity to test the feeling of the Ameri-
 can public. I think that has been tested. As you know the hearings
 will end neXt. week. We have two more Ambassadors to hear from.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am a new member of
 the committee.  That is the reason for my question. I wasn't on the
 committee when previous hearings were held.  I notice it has had bi-
 partisan support m both the Senate and the House, that both political
 parties have had bills introduced by their members. This is one of
 the reasons why I wondered about the delay.
 I would like to ask you a question : Could not this same kind of pro-
 gram he conducted throughout all the public and private educational
 institutions in the Nation today?
 Mr. Smrrii. I am sorry. I can't hear that. Would you repeat the
 last part.
 Mr. CLAwsox. Could not the same program and the educational
 aspect of it be conducted within the public and private educational
 institutions of the Nation that exist today, without the establishment
 of a new facility or a new academy?
 Mr. SMrrx. First of all, I am not an expert on this bill. I believe in
 its concepts. However, I believe there has been a great deal of testi-
 mony to the effect that universities don't have the money or the time
 to conduct such a program in the depth and scope that is necessary.
 Mr. POOL. I must say I agree with that testimony. Will you yield
 at this point?
 Mr. CLAwsom. Yes.
 Mr. POOL. Mr. Ambassador, don't you think, as a practical matter,
 the Government would have to support this type program for it to be
 a successful program l
 Mr. SMrni. Mr. Pool has given you the answer. That is right.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. That is significant. We are helping them now by
 passing a tremendous educational bill for their support..
 So I don't think this is a deterrent to their moving into this direction
 because we are helping them now. If it is so important-and I think
 it is and I am not in opposition to this program-it seems tome that
 the base needs to be broadened and every institution of an educational
 nature in the Nation should be involved in this program so that our
 people are forewarned and then forearmed as a result of their training
 in their educational institutions and the elementary schools, too.
 Mr. Santa. Yes, sir. This will give the universities the opportunity
 to enter the field. They will t-hen have a center from which to obtain
 the necessary material required for teaching their own students. As
 I understand it. there is no place today where universities may obtain
 sufficient material to explore this subject through research in depth.
 Mr. Cr.Awsox. You mean we don't have people today who are
 knowledgeable in the field of anticommunism or pro-Americanism to
 the point that we can train?
 Mr. SMITit. No. sir; I didn't mean to imply that. I meant to imply
 merely that I do not believe that there is sufficient material available
 for the universities today to carry on a program which would compare
 favorably with what is called for in the Freedom Academy Act

 The CHAIRMAN. And we have evidence to that effect, that no single
 university or numbers of universities, somehow, have the facilities, the
 abilities, the finances to come forward with the development of a pro-
 gram of this kind.
 The record is already replete with testimony along that line.
 Mr. SMITH. Mr. Clawson, this should be a. Government project.
 As President Kennedy said, this is a new form of struggle. This is
 a nonmilitary global conflict. It should not be left to private uni-
 versities or to private enterprise to make this fund of Information
 available. We need an academy, a place where all the experts will
 be together.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. It seems to me we need a broader base than this.
 I am appalled over the fact that we even have this problem in America
 where people are not trained in the free enterprise system, capitalistic
 system, .to the point where they can recognize the danger signals of
 communism.
 It seems to me we have had a failure along the line some place in
 our educational institutions that we have not been able to get our
 people acquainted with this problem. Maybe we need this approach,
 but I am fearful it will not have a broad enough base to do the total job
 and to do it in time. I think we are faced with a time element, too,
 as well as the educational problem.
 Mr. SMITH. I think we ought to get something done. Maybe this
 can be improved on after it has had a fair trial. It is natural in our
 form of democracy for people to be reticent about getting into psycho-
 laglcal warfare.
 However, there are two ideologies in the world and the Com-
 munists are out to destroy us. They believe it can be done without
 military war, that it can be done covertly. It is obvious to me that
 we have to prepare ourselves to fight against the Soviet research ' and
 training program in political warfare. It takes pros to fight pros.
 Mr.   LAWSON. I understand that. There is' no question about it.
 Let me ask just one further question then and I won't pursue this
 line of questioning any longer.  Do you envision the Academy as a
 physical plant similar to our military academies where all of this is
 taking place, or do you consider it as a possible extension of this pro-
 gram into selected private universities or public universities?
 Mr. SMITH. Well, sir, LIFE magazine spoke of this as a political
 West Point. I think that connotes an undergraduate school. It would
 have been better if they had said a political West Point for adults or
 a political West Point for college graduates or a political West Point
 for those who have passed the college age.
 I mentioned this point in my statement before your committee. I
 referred to the necessity of the Academy and stated that what we
 needed was a United States graduate school for advanced political
 study and training.  I emphasize the word "graduate" so that the
 Academ  will not be confused with an undergraduate school.
 The CHAIRMAN. I might mention that the record contains the testi-
 mony of knowledgeable people in the educational world with ref-
 erence to the necessity for this Academy. It was brought out and I
 can assert it myself, that in a number of the States of the Union
 and glory to them, the legislatures of several States have enacted
 laws to require the teaching of a course roughly referred to as "Com-
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Aoved ForpRgW2P/Q74tfJ&4a
 rA46R000600070001-8
 munism versus Americanism."  But upon the enactment of these laws,
 and one of them was passed in my State we woke up to find out that
 teachers in public schools say, "What. am. i to teach? What do I know?
 Where is the reliable information?"
 I had I don't know how many letters from all over the country, espe-
 cially from my State, from teachers, having the strangest idea about
 this course, asking me, for instance, how many Communists there are
 in the town of Jonesville, and so on. They didn't have the wildest
 concept of what course ought to be taught..
 I took a stab at it by saying that-I used to be a public school teacher,
 I taught law for 10 years-I said why don't you draw some com-
 parisons. Talk about education, for example. Compare our system
 with the Soviets. That would be a good project.. Why don't- you com-
 pare our system of free elections, as compared to no system, along that.
 line? Why don't you compare our constitutional provisions regarding
 free speech, religion, and so on, with their absence in Communist. coun-
 tries. This would be a good beginning.
 If you are going to try to point the finger and to expect to find out
 how many Communists are here and there and you expect to rout
 them out in X number of days, I am afraid that is not the idea of these
 bills.
 So, we are faced with that situation.
 You are right, Mr. Ambassador, that no university, somehow, has
 been ableto develop information, reliable information, on-the ways and
 means of tactical warfare in the cold war world, and so on. That is
 why something ought to be done.
 Mr. CLAWSON. 'Ir. Chairman, I appreciate the statement and I
 agree with you fully.  However, I still go back to this other problem,
 as I see it.
 The old adage that you train the child in the way it shall go and
 when it is old it will not depart therefrom is just as true today as when
 it was uttered centuries ago. I believe if we wait until we train adults
 and try to change their direction we are still going to miss the point
 in this Academy.
 Now is there a new concept that this is going to be a source of re-
 search material and training techniques and operational know-how to
 disseminate to all of our universities?  Is that. going to be part of
 the function of the Freedom Academy as you envision it?
 Mr. Sirs. Mr. Clawson, I have been trying to avoid testifying
 on the technical parts of this bill
 Mr. CLAWSON. I will withdraw the question.
 Mr. -Sazrrn.-because there are so many people who are better quali-
 fied, like Mr. Alan Grant,  He has been working on this bill, I
 believe, since 1952 or 1953. They have testified before this committee.
 For me now to appear as an expert on the technical points of the bill
 would be a mistake.
 So I would like to duck that question if I may.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. I will withdraw my question.  Thank you, Mr.
 Chairman.
 The CIAraxAN. I might say at this point that someone picking up
 the record and reading it perhaps would want to find out why there
 was not an explanation at this point.

 Mr. McNamara, will you say two or three words concerning the op-
 erational feature of this bill?
 Mr. CLAWSON. My question was this, whether the concept was going
 to extend or magnify the program to the point where this will be a
 source of material, research material, operational programs, and so on,
 that can be drawn upon by all the universities and educational institu-
 tions throughout the Nation., both private and public.
 Mr. MONAMARA. That is true.  That is one of the functions of the
 freedom centers provided for in this bill.  There will be localities,
 units, for dissemination of reliable information on all phases of com-
 munism. Any citizen will be able to go to these freedom centers and
 obtain the type information they want on various aspects of commu-
 nism. This will apply to universities, apply to high school teachers,
 anyone who wants this information-political leaders, labor leaders,
 religious leaders, educational leaders.
 So far as the children of the country are concerned, this is intended
 to be a graduate-type institution.  The children of our country need,
 I think you will agree, education in American ideals, but this is pri-
 marily the function of the schools and the local boards of education.
 What the Academy is concerned with is Communist political war-
 fare.  The adult population of our country, shall we say, the people
 who by their vote influence our policy-give them the education they
 need on Communist operations which are a threat to the security of
 this country and, all other free nations.  This is generally a more
 sophisticated type knowledge than the average grade or high school
 student can absorb. It is primarily a graduate-level school.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I just don't believe the base is broad enough here in
 this one Academy to do the job.
 Mr. PooL. Will you yield at this point?
 Mr. CLAwsox. Yes.
 The CHAIRMAN. In other words, you want a stronger bill?
 Mr. CLAWSON. I want a stronger bill.
 Mr. McNAMARA. The concept here is that there is a limit as to how
 far you can go.  If you bring in all the peak Government personnel
 to be trained in fighting the cold war and train them thoroughly for 6
 months or a year and if you do the same thing with leaders from all
 walks of American life-the trade union field, educational field, re-
 ligious field, field of veterans organizations, womens groups-you will
 disseminate by these leaders, through their organizations and thus
 through the population generally, the kind of knowledge that is needed
 to support a sound policy.
 Mr. CLAWSON. When they leave here they have the zeal of St. Paul
 to go out and sell this program so that they can get some effectiveness
 throughout the world.  That is what I would like to see done.  I
 think we need a broad base to do it.
 The CHAIRMAN. I might point out that we have in a small way an
 effective precedent for this concept.  The AFL-CIO sponsors the
 American Institute for Free Labor Development from their own
 funds and with money from big business.  They bring to American
 shores labor leaders from the Latin and South American countries and
 teach them the American way of the labor movement and also about
 Communist strategy and tactics, particularly in the labor field. And
 they go back, in turn, and impart our democratic labor concepts to
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 A60roved Fo   efea  20051D7ft&DQh4      67446R000600070001-8
 their countries and also use their knowledge of communism to combat
 it in their native lands.
 I am told that it has done a great deal of good. So that is one
 precedent for it. Finally I point out, again, the broad base support.
 of this bill. Included among the authors of this bill on the Senate side
 are Senators Dodd, Douglas, Mundt, Goldwater, Proxmire-you can't
 have a broader base of political philosophy in America with that kind
 of support for it.
 So, we ought not be too much concerned about the cries, or if that
 word is too strong I will use "misgivings," of the people on the right or
 the left. That is why, having discussed this with members of the
 committee and the staff, I decided to make this announcement.. I made
 it on the floor some time ago.
 The only thing we have is testimony in favor of the Academy. If
 anyone is in opposition, here is their chance.  Don't say, like the
 Defense Department, "The broad objectives of the proposed legislation
 are praiseworthy. However, the need * * * is questionable."
 It is time to put up or shutup now.
 Mr. SMrmH. They don't amplify that? They say the needs are ques-
 tionable, but they don't amplify that?
 The CHAIRMAN. If it is questionable, my goodness, let us have the
 reasons why.
 Mr. Clausen.
 Mr. CLAUSEN, Mr. Chairman, if I could take a couple of minutes.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Don Clausen is not a member of the committee,
 but he is a very interested supporter. Ile is the author of one of the
 bills. I am delighted to recognize him.
 Mr. CLAUSxN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Smith, I have enjoyed your comments very very much. I think
 that some of the points you have made as far as tie State Department
 is concerned certainly have brought to light one of the major issues
 that we have at stake, that is, certainly the State Department does not
 want to yield on foreign policy matters.
 I think this committee certainly has done a. great. service for the
 American public. I think as Members of Congress we certainly need
 to develop a program that. is going to be responsive to us and coordi-
 nate this, of course, with all of the agencies because many people are
 writing to us.
 The fact that the director of this committee has pointed out that
 there are educational facilities all over the Soviet Union and some
 other satellite nations teaching communism, purely for the purpose of
 export, it would appear to me certainly desirable to have the Freedom
 Academy so that we can teach freedom and export freedom.
 This is a great. struggle; it will be with us for sometime to come.
 As you pointed out frankly, the Communists are sending hard-core,
 trained professionals, and we are sending kids out to do the job.
 Again I would like to go into this in more depth, but. I hope that. I
 can hold my comments for the floor of the House after it passes the
 committee, Ur. Chairman.
 Mr. SwaTii. May I say one thing, Mr. Chairman.  Because of my
 experience I would recommend that the chiefs of the political divi-
 siopa of all Embassies, located in a politically turbulent. nation, attend
 the FPreedom Academy before being assigned to their posts. I think
 this is very important.

 Mr. CLAWSON. A compulsory requirement?
 Mr. SMITH. No, sir; I am not suggesting it be compulsory.  I am
 making this as a specific recommendation.  In other words, the State
 Department will come back and say, well, how many of our people
 do you think should attend the Academy.  It is obvious that all the
 officers of the Foreign Service can't attend the Academy.
 So, I am selecting what I believe to be one of the most sensitive
 positions in an Embassy--the First Secretary for Political Affairs.
 He is in direct contact with the various political groups in the nation,
 whether they are progovernment or antigovernment.
 The office of the chief political officer in Havana during the Castro
 Communist revolution was on the fifth floor, where I was.  All types
 of individuals came up to see him.  If he had been trained in the
 Freedom Academy, he would have had more knowledge of commu-
 nism and a better background to cope with the situation.  This is
 obvious.
 The CHAIRMAN. Have you concluded?
 Mr. SMITH. Yes, Sir.
 The CHAIRMAN. I recognize the gentleman from Missouri.
 Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Chairman, if lie has concluded
 The CHAIRMAN. First, Mr. Ambassador, we are very grateful for
 your appearance and your great contribution to this proposal.
 Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD H. ICHORD, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM MISSOURI
 Mr. IOHORD. Mr. Chairman, I have a statement that I have pre-
 pared and I ask permission to insert in the record.  All the members
 of the committee know my views on these bills, and certainly we will
 have an opportunity to discuss them in executive session.  But I would
 like to point out that, in addition to my service on this committee, I
 am also a member of the Armed Services Committee and yesterday
 we took up a bill providing for the procurement of ammunition and
 hardware, various implements of war.  Included in that bill was the
 sum of $6 billion for research.  We are researching in the field of -
 weapons that to many people would be unbelievable. We are spend-
 ing better than $50 billion it year to support our armed services. We
 have built up one of the greatest war machines in the history of man-
 kind.                                     We are able to fight a hot war and defend ourselves.
 Certainly I don't want that hot war to come and I don't want to be a
 prophet of doom; I don't want to play the part of a prophet, but if
 the present trend continues, we could very easily become engaged in
 another worldwide conflict.
 You don't have to take my word for it; you don't have to take the
 word of the leaders of our Government. All you have to do is to take
 the word of the Communist leaders themselves.  When they make
 the statements which Mr. Smith pointed out, when they say we will
 support wars of liberation all over the world, and then proceed to
 support and push wars of conquest from one end of the globe to an-
 other, we should realize the danger.
 The American people to me seem to be obsessed with the idea that
 the Communists are going to become less and less belligerent, that

 ApSoved For  @WgM299?/(17/  E   -F~    M9946R000600070001-8
 they will experience a change of heart. This appears to be, at its best,
 Just mere wishful thinking.  I can't see any factual basis for that
 belief at all.
 Last week, Mr. Myerhoff, head of one of the great advertising con-
 cerns in this country, testified, and, Mr. Chairman, I am sure you read
 his statement, but. I wish it would have been possible for you to have
 heard him. He presented many novel ideas. He stated that he thought
 that the Communists were using techniques in selling their ideology,
 in carrying on political and propaganda warfare, that had long been
 developed by the American advertising industry.
 I can see instances where they are.  I don't believe advertising
 techniques would in all cases be effective in selling democracy, but at
 least in this institution you could examine his proposals and see if
 that is the best way to proceed. We could assemble the best minds
 of our country and research and develop effective techniques of cold
 war defense.  We are spending $6 billion this year on hot weapon re-
 search and development. Can't we afford to spend the relatively small
 sum called for by these bills for cold war research and development?
 He made the statement, Mr. Chairman, that one of the great prob-
 lems that we had in USIA was the policy of reporting all of the news
 in the United States because unfortunately the things that make the
 news are bad. That is true.
 Now I could condemn the State Department, I could condemn the
 USIA. I decline to do that because I have sympathy for them. It is
 quite a problem.  We have some very dedicated people in the State
 Department and the USIA, but something is wrong, and I think it is
 very simple--our techniques are in need of improvement.
 Mr. CLAUSEN. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. IcHoan. Yes.
 Mr. CLAusEx. In addition to your own comments, Mr. Ichord, it
 would appear to me that, there has to be a national declaration of policy
 to win the cold war and then developp the institution to train people
 and, in articular, to move out into the private sector to take advan-
 tage of thenonmilitary capabilities.
 If we are going to win this great struggle of ours, certainly we are
 going to have to train people.  I think frankly the public sector has
 a responsibility, but our foreign aid problems throughout the world
 have pointed out very vividly that the public-to-public sector concept
 has not been working.
 We need to expand people-to-people. I think this would give a
 great o portuni
 Mr. IcsoRn. M. Myerhoff brought to the attention of the committee
 a publication of USIA which was similar to LIFE' magazine. In it
 he showed us pictures of racial riots that were published in this maga-
 zine to be distributed in Poland.
 I am sure that USIA's motive was to assure the people of Poland
 that in this country we have freedom of assembly. But Mr. Meyerhoff
 argued, and I am inclined to believe that he is right, that the (om-
 munists very quickly picked this up to show that we have great inter-
 nal trouble, that we don't have a stable Nation, that we are about

 to be involved in civil war. Whether or not the effect of the article
 was good or bad, I think we can all agree that this policy needs to be
 examined and studied and perhaps refine our methods of getting ideas
 across. We should be truthful, but should we publish pictures of
 race riots abroad with the aim of improving our image?  Isn't there
 a better way of explaining our racial problems to a nation completely
 unfamiliar with those problems?
 Mr. Chairman, I would ask leave that my statement, together with
 three articles, be included in the record.
 The CHAIRMAN. The statement and extraneous material will be
 received at this point.
 (Congressman Ichord's statement and insertions follow:)
 STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD H. ICHORD, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE
 FROM MISSOURI
 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee :
 As you and the other members of the subcommittee know, I am the author of
 H.R. 2215, one of the eight Freedom Academy bills now pending before this
 committee.
 Last year, nine bills to create the Freedom Commission and Freedom Academy
 were introduced in the House and referred to the Committee on Un-American
 Activities. We held hearings for 7 days on those bills, and a.total of 38 persons
 testified or submitted statements on them. All but one of those witnesses-Mr.
 Harriman speaking for the Department of State-strongly endorsed the Freedom
 Academy concept.
 So far this year we have held 3 days of hearings, during which several wit-
 nesses have testified.  Every one of those witnesses has endorsed the Freedom
 Academy idea. I appear today for the same purpose.
 All of us are thoroughly familiar with the Freedom Academy envisaged in the
 bills pending before the committee. For this reason I do not intend to discuss
 their details. What I would like to do, however, is to bring to the attention of
 the committee some facts and items which have come to my attention in the last
 few months and which emphasize, at least to me, the importance of the bills before
 us and how vital it is that the United States get along with the Job of making the
 Freedom Academy a reality.
 I should like to bring to the attention of the committee an item from the New
 York Times, page 3, of the issue of April 11, this year, which tells about a Com-
 munist political warfare school, the Institute of National Minorities in Kunming,
 the capital city of the Yunnan Province in Red China. This is a school estab-
 lished by Peking in an effort to tighten, and guarantee, its control of national
 minorities in or bordering on Red China and also the people of Tibet, that un-
 fortunate Himalayan kingdom which was completely subjugated by Peking in
 1959 after many thousands of its citizens had been slaughtered in an unsuccessful
 and bloody revolt against Red rule.
 The minorities about which Peking Is concerned and to whom this school de-
 votes its attention include not only the Tibetans and residents of Sinkiang Prov-
 ince, but also various tribes living along the border of Burma, Laos, and North
 Vietnam-people who are ethnically linked to Red China's neighbors.
 According to the New York Times article, about 1,000 hand-picked students
 from these areas are receiving training and Indoctrination in this Institute of
 National Minorities at any given time. The courses extend some 6 months to 3
 years.
 The Times article quotes the deputy director of the Institute as stating : "We
 are different from other educational institutes-we are a political institute for
 training minority cadres with Communist Ideas."
 I also have several items which have appeared in the press recently concerning
 the role of the U.S. Information Agency in Vietnam.

 The first, an Associated Press dispatch published in the Washington Evening
 Star of March 28, of this year, states that our country intends to increase Its
 propaganda efforts in Vietnam. It quotes the USIA Director, Carl T. Rowan, who
 had just returned from South Vietnam, as stating that during the past year
 USIA officers In that country had been increased from 24 to 55 and that perhaps
 another 20 will be sent out. He also stated that the number of South Vietnamese
 employees of USIA had been Increased, that USIA shortwave broadcasts from
 the Philippines have been strengthened and the USIA broadcasts in Vietnamese
 raised from 2 to 6 hours daily.
 Mr. Rowan, according to this article, pointed out after his return from South
 Vietnam that the government there is so busy fighting the Viet Cong that It has
 little time---and also lacks the know-how-to counteract the Red propaganda
 activity.
 The next item, published in the Washington Star of April 3, of this year, re-
 veals that the State Department had issued an urgent appeal to key personnel to
 volunteer their services In South Vietnam,  Foreign Service officers, It stated,
 are needed to serve as representatives for the Agency for International Develop-
 ment in South Vietnam provinces. AID lacks thepersonnel to do this work. The
 notice stated, and I quote "the President personally attaches the highest priority
 to that effort and to our participation in It."
 Items published in the Washington press on April 7-just a few weeks ago-
 reveal that President Johnson had ordered USIA Director Rowan to take charge
 of our psychological war efforts in Vietnam.  In addition to having charge of
 his own agency's psychological warfare operations, Mr. Rowan will have charge
 of those of the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency, and Agency
 for International Development
 I certainly hope, as I know all members of this committee do, that this pro-
 gram will be successful.  I cannot. help wondering, however, why we have
 had to wait until the last minute or so for this effort to be made when it has
 been obvious for so many years that we have been engaged in a very crucial
 political warfare contest in South Vietnam.  I find it hard to understand why
 the steps I have just mentioned were not taken 2, 3, 5, or even 7 or 8 years ago.
 According to these press Items I have mentioned, there Is a tremendous job to
 be done. In this effort the USIA Is going to try to influence an estimated 50
 percent of the South Vietnamese population which is now "fence-sitting." It Is
 going to try to create a sense of national unity, ward off defeatism, explain the
 U.S. Involvement and commitment in South Vietnam, publicize Viet Cong tactics,
 According to testimony received by this committee this last year from compe-
 tent witnesses, the United States has not been training adequate numbers of
 personnel adequately In the work that has to be done today In South Vietnam.
 The State Department appeal for volunteers stated that "broad experience and
 versatility of skills are important for this assignment," and that the Foreign
 Service officers going to Vietnam on this project as province representatives
 will have to work with the U.S. military adviser and the native province chief
 In "planning and directing the pacification of the province."

 Approved For RJR&0   7/1:~,RfA&RD  ,ZM   R000600Q$Q001-8
 The situation is so desperate that five officers were needed immediately at
 the time the appeal was made. I wonder just how much training they have
 had in pacification techniques and in lighting Communist political warfare.
 It would appear to me that an admission that the training of State Department
 personnel in this area has been far from adequate is found in the fact that 10
 additional Foreign Service officers will be given a 41/2-month training program
 here in the United States before being assigned to Vietnam to work on this
 project.
 For years, Mr. Chairman, advocates of the Freedom Academy have been
 pointing out the great gap that exists in this type of training for U.S. personnel.
 They have been urging that a Freedom Academy be established to impart this
 kind of training as well as other vital unconventional warfare skills.  Nothing
 has been done about it.
 Today, we have a crisis in this area and we still do not have any kind of
 institution to train the personnel we need to do the job that has to be done.
 We have all kinds of psychological warfare and political warfare specialists
 in our Government and, of course, we have our propaganda officials as well,.
 but none of them, apparently, has been able to perceive or understand until
 recently the need for real intense political and psychological warfare effort
 in Vietnam.
 Last year we were fortunate in having as witnesses a number of journalists of
 very wide experience, who emphasized the need for political warfare training
 in their own profession.  Since listening to their testimony, I have seen a con-
 siderable number of articles dealing with communism, both abroad and at
 hone, which have emphasized the importance of what these witnesses said.
 We know that the Communist bloc is attaching a great importance to control
 and use of the press and other communications media as a cold war weapon.
 If we are not to lose out in this area, we need an institute where free world
 journalists can be taught the facts about political warfare and the vital role
 both the Communist and the free world press play in it.
 I would like to submit for the record at this point an article entitled "Journal-
 ism and the Cold War," published in the January 1965 issue of The Quill,
 official publication of the journalist fraternity, Sigma Delta Chi.
 The article is written by Eugene H. Methvin, a member of the Washington
 staff of the Reader's Digest.  Mr. Methvin, who studied journalism in the
 Henry W.. Grady School of Journalism in Atlanta, has long been a student of
 communism and its unconventional warfare techniques.  His article, which
 emphasizes another one of the major gaps in our defense against communism
 and shows how we suffer from this gap, will, I hope, be an important addition
 to this hearing record.

 JOURNALISM AND
 By EUGENE H. METLIVIN
 Erodes', Digest
 THEN THE NEWLY independent Sultan of Zanzi-
 bar was overthrown last January New York
 Times Correspondent Robert Conley put himself in the
 running for a Pulitzer prize with his stories revealing
 that the power seizure was engineered by 30 or 40 com-
 munist:; trained in Cuba, the Soviet Union and Com-
 munist China. This was brilliant cold war coverage
 that alerted the American people to brewing trouble in
 yet another sector of what Adlai Stevenson calls the
 "world civil war."
 But the American people could be even better
 served if journalists were prepared to "background"
 such news with a knowledge of the communist revolu-

 And what do Africans study in Moscow's "internation-

 200 other students from Africa, Central America and
 Asia in a class in "self defense," rigorous paramilitary
 training in the guerrilla arts. "One army officer told me,

 THE AUTHOR
 Eugene Methvin was born in 1934
 in Vienna, Ga., where his father was a
 cousin1 weekly editor and publisher of
 the Vienna News. His mother still op-
 erates the paper and has won Georgia
 Press Association prizes for "most fear-
 less editorial" in duet with the white
 Citizens Councils, and for general ex-
 cellence (runner-up).  Young Methvin
 could lay clahn to having started as a
 reporter (leg-man only) before he could
 write, for at the age of five he wandered
 around the streets with pad and pencil
 insisting that the residents write down
 their nears for him. He studied journal-
 ism at the Henry W. Grady School of
 Jmunalisin, graduating in 1.955 with an
 ABJ and supplementary major in law.
 Upon graduation he spent three years
 as a jet fighter pilot. In 1958 he joined
 the Washington Daily News as a gen-
 eral assignment reporter and in 1960
 he went to the Reader's Digest at its
 Washington editorial office as a stall
 writer. He is treasurer of the Washing-
 ton Professional chapter,
 will be a leader of a revolutionary front,"' Okotcha re-
 ports.
 His next study was "occult science," a witch-doctor
 class arranged exclusively for African students. An Af-
 rican affairs expert in perfect Swahili lectured sur-
 rounded by plastic human skulls and skeletons, plastic
 serpents of various sizes. "One witch doctor carrying on
 among primitive people can do more than a dozen po-
 litical lecturers," he said. "He can move the masses in
 any way he chooses. Well, then, supposing he is a com-
 munist?"
 The professor placed a skull on the table and using
 radio microphones caused it to issue commands such
 as: "I am your ancestor speaking. I command you to go
 tonight, kill the British governor, and bring his head
 and hands to me. If you fail I will cast evil spells on you
 and your family."
 With this background, it is not hard to add two plus
 two-and the obvious answer is more trouble of the
 Mau-Mau type in all of East Africa in coming years as
 the  communists  turn  Zanzibar into  an  unsinkable
 Cuba-style little red schoolhouse. (It is already hap-
 pening, under Red Chinese tutelage, in the eastern
 Congo. A special school near Peking is training witch
 doctors in guerrilla warfare and upon their return they
 are organizing tribal insurgency.) (Editor's Note: This
 article was written prior to the November outbreak of
 conflict in the Congo.) Certainly this is an indispensable
 part of "depth" reporting on this cold war round. And
 any news commentator or desk man in America who had
 bothered to get himself on the mailing list for Senate
 Internal Security Subcommittee reports could have pro.
 duced sparkling "interp" pieces backgrounding the Zanzi-
 bar development-fox that is where Okotcha's account is
 to be found.
 This Zanzibar example illuminates a major problem
 many thoughtful journalists see confronting America's
 free press today. Simply put, the problem is this: The
 professional practitioners in our communications media
 are not generally equipped to recognize communist-in-
 spired violence, deception and psydropolitical manip-
 ulation and to adequately "background the news" on
 thousands of complex cold war skirmishes being fought
 daily around the globe. This problem can mean  op-
 portunity" for the professional-cash, recognition and
 satisfaction for those with reportorial initiative to dig
 out and write the "depth" stories nobody else is tack-
 ling.
 Let me cite a minor personal experience. After the
 June 1960 riots in Tokyo forced cancellation of Pres-
 ident Eisenhower's visit, a Reader's Digest editor asked

 THE COLD WAR
 the obvious question nobody else seemed to have
 thought of: "All the newspapers say these riots are red-
 inspired. How do we know? If you're a communist, how
 do you start a riot?"
 Assigned to get the answer, I asked my State De-
 partment contact to set tip an interview with the De-
 partment experts on such things. "Sure," he said, "Call
 you back in a day or so." Two weeks passed. My friend
 finally called, quite crestfallen. "I hate to tell you this,
 and frankly Pm a little shocked myself. I've checked
 everywhere. Nobody in the entire U.S. government
 really keeps up with these things."
 Realizing we had stumbled onto a major gap in our
 cold war defenses, the Digest Washington Bureau
 initiated what became a series of stories on national
 policy machinery and communist tactics. Meanwhile,
 fascinated by a whole new world I never know existed,
 I spent six months digging into mob psychology and
 crowd management and researching case studies. The
 result was an article which was published in a relatively
 obscure scholarly journal. The U.S. Army Command
 & General Staff School picked it up for its Military Re-
 view, and the State Department sent a briefed version
 to all 375 U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. The article
 has been adopted in our own armed forces training
 texts, translated into Spanish and circulated among
 Latin American services, and to my utter dismay the
 Army has even invited me as an expert to lecture on
 communist mob techniques.
 This experience shows how widespread is the infor-
 mation gap on what has been called "the now frontier
 of war." Other examples:
 PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION-
 American journalists were poorly equipped to "back-
 ground" the Dallas tragedy because assassination as a
 political weapon is so utterly foreign to us. Americans
 find it hard to connect the act of handing a 15-year-
 old boy a hate-filled pamphlet on the Rosenbergs, con-
 demned nuclear spies, and that youth's act nine years
 later of shooting the President of the United States. Yet
 there is a connection. Although psychiatrists recognized
 Oswald was potentially dangerous when he was 13 still
 he is a case study of how inflammatory communist
 propaganda can attract, activate, and motivate a con-
 fused, frustrated individual and give direction and
 focus to his aggressive behavior. The lesson Oswald so
 eloquently  teaches is that  inflammatory communist
 propaganda can kill. Yet reporting on the sociology and
 psychology of communist organizational and psycho-
 logical warfare is generally distinguished chiefly by its
 shallowness.
 Beyond Oswald the whole history of communist as-
 sassination as a political weapon was relevant back-
 ground the press missed. Nobody pointed out that the
 Soviets were caught using it in Western Europe as late
 as 1959, for example. A few commentators pointed out
 that  Lenin  condemned assassination-but they only
 demonstrated that a little knowledge can be danger-
 ous.
 For Lenin only condemned the approach of the
 Narodnaya Volya terrorists, one of whom was his older
 brother Alexander, hanged for plotting to kill the Czar.
 Lenin  said  that  assassination  used  indiscriminately
 would be counter-productive, especially if it took the
 place of careful organizational work. But he not only
 never ruled out assassination. He always considered it
 an integral part of the revolutionary's arsenal and in-
 sisted that communists be willing and able to use all
 weapons, including murder. He required all Commu-
 nist parties formed under the Communist International
 to set up secret apparatuses. The German Party, for ex-
 ample, organized covert M(military), N (intelligence),
 Z (infiltration), and T (terror) groups. We have some
 well-authenticated and corroborated accounts of the
 early beginnings of the communist T-groups in Ger-
 many. Their function was to punish traitors and to
 murder anti-communist political and military leaders.
 Most interesting was the emergence of a willingness to
 use the T-groups to solve infra-party differences. With
 the Khruschev-Mao feud heating up the history of this
 intro-mural use of the communist T-squads it may one
 clay prove to be a vital part of one of the biggest news
 stories of our century.
 ANTI-CIA CAMPAIGN-Any psychological warfare
 technician knows that in his adversary's society there
 are always groups and individuals who will share his
 objectives and do his work for him, for their own inde-
 pendent moral or political reasons. In his jargon these
 are called "targets of opportunity." In Western society,
 for example, the communist warrior knows there in-
 evitably are people who will oppose almost any policy
 of their governments that he wants to attack always
 for their own independent reasons. The Red strate-
 gist's problem then becomes: How to activate the op-
 position?  The  answer is  the  simple  stratagem  of
 throwing the spotlight of publicity on the issue and
 draw the target group's attention to it. Such has been
 the nature of the Soviet campaign to discredit the CIA
 and undermine public confidence in it. Enough Ameri-
 cans fear any secret agency and abhor the idea of a
 "department of dirty tricks" so that to draw their at-
 tention to its existence guarantees a substantial public
 opposition and steady drumfire of criticism, controversy

 and suspicion. (Of course the agency earns some of its
 criticism quite honestly))
 Nikita Khrushchev's seemingly casual remarks on his
 1959 tour of the United States about the CIA set this
 strategy of exposure rolling. The most famous incident
 was carefully staged at the White House within easy
 earshot of reporters when Khrushchev met CIA Direc-
 tor Allen Dulles and joked about paying the same spies
 and reading the same reports. Throughout his tour
 Khrushchev's remarks were repeated too often and too
 prominently to have been genuinely casual. Since that
 time we have learned the Soviet KGB has set up a
 special section assigned to think up and execute de-
 ception operations to discredit the CIA. It's called-
 shades of "1984" - the "Disinformation Bureau."
 Among its favored weapons are the forgery, the fake
 news story, the planted rumor. On April 23, 1961, when
 the Bay of Pigs and the Algerian generals' revolt were
 top news, a crypto-communist newspaper in Rome,
 Il Paese, carried a story declaring that "some people in
 Paris are accusing the American secret service headed
 by Allen Dulles of having participated in the plot of
 the four 'ultra' generals."
 This paper, testified Assistant CIA Director Richard
 Helms later, is frequently "used as an outlet for dis-
 guished Soviet propaganda." TASS promptly relayed
 the story, and the London Daily Worker and the Paris
 communist daily L'Humanite headlined: "U.S. SPY
 AGENCY ENCOURAGED REVOLT." Simultaneous-
 ly the Polish press attache spread it in Paris bars where
 newsmen hang out. Soon the free world press services
 -not one of them aware of the story's origins-splashed
 it onto front pages everywhere. This Moscow-manufac-
 tured "fable," as such intelligence gambits are called,
 was taken up by Paris officialdom anxious to redeem
 French honor by proving their rebellious officer corps
 had been inspired from abroad. They drew hot words
 from the U.S. Ambassador and White House Press Sec-
 retary Pierre Salinger, in Paris preparing for a presiden-
 tial visit, Salinger accused Pierre Baraduc, French For-
 eign Office press chief, of putting out the story to put
 President Kennedy at a disadvantage with General
 De Gaulle. "I'm not putting it out," Barraduc replied.
 "It seems to have sprung from nowhere. But you have
 to admit the story sounds logical." no Western press
 continued to play it for a week without any idea where
 it originated.
 FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE-On April
 6, 1960, the New York Times carried a full-page ad
 branding as "false' the rising tide of news reports indi-
 cating Castro's communist ties. "Not a shred of evi-
 dence has been produced," the ad proclaimed, prais-
 ing the "great work of revolutionary reform now in
 progress in Cuba." Thirty citizens calling themselves
 the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" signed it. The FBI
 very quickly flagged the Fair Play Committee as a
 typical front operation initiated by individuals with
 known public record communist links, and reporters
 who bothered to inquire were so informed as early as
 the summer of 1960. Yet so few bothered that the Fair
 Play Committee was able to organize 30 committees in
 major American cities, 40 college chapters, and enlist
 10,000 students, adults, and subscribers who contrib-
 uted at an annual rate of $45,000 for this propaganda
 effort. On Oct. 20, 1960, 1500 people attended a New
 York rally urging "hands off Cuba" at a time when
 growing communist influence in that unhappy isle was
 a presidential campaign issue.
 Not once, so far as diligent inquiry reveals, did
 any newspaper or wire service reporter do a story re-
 vealing the known facts of communist involvement, or-
 ganizational talent and publicity support going into the
 "Fair Play' operation or suggest that this was a com-
 munist-inspired maneuver.
 Indeed, when the Senate Internal Security Subcom-
 mittee initiated hearings it was hotly denounced by a
 leading magazine and a score or more newspapers for
 "McCarthyism." Yet the subcommittee got nothing like
 equal notice when a young Cuban physician testified
 that he had gone with the Fair Play Committee's
 organizer to U.N. headquarters to pick up $3500 from
 Raul Roa, Jr., a member of the Cuban delegation and
 son of Castro's foreign minister, for the Times ad that
 kicked off the whole operation.
 "T"oe whole sad episode reveals a deep double stand-
 ard," says Sen. Thomas J. Dodd. "Show too many peo-
 ple a nutty right-wing outfit like the Birch Society and
 they are off like chargers, eager to do battle. Editors
 send reporters to their meetings, probe their organiza-
 tional structure, and hound them with steady criticism.
 But they are not interested in a Fair Play for Cuba
 Committee, organized with secret communist financial
 support by an ex-convict who is actively misleading
 thousands of innocent students and using them to ad-
 vanco Moscow's grand strategy. Yet that organization
 proved itself capable of inciting and channeling the
 hatred of the sick soul who killed the President of the
 United States."
 THE GAP IN JOURNALISM EDUCATION-Re-
 cent scholarship in the history of revolutionary move-
 ments forces us to realize that the "cold war' between
 democratic due process and revolutionary totalitarian.
 ism has been with us, on a minor scale, since the French
 Revolution, and that the totalitarians have developed
 a thorough technology of planned violence and social
 demolition. The persistent recurrence of domestic ex-
 tremist groups ranging from the Ku Klux Klan, the
 Black Muslims, and the pro-Chinese communist splin-
 ter factors indicates these phenomena are likely to be
 with us indefinitely. Since they borrow liberally from

 each other their methods are generally uniform, and
 covering them adequately requires specialized back-
 ground knowledge.
 One cause of the inadequacy of cold war coverage
 so far is that journalism schools have paid so little at-
 tention to it. Of course, thus far the profession has not
 asked them to supply journalists trained in what has
 up to now not been recognized as a specialty. When
 the demand exists, they will supply it. They give
 courses in science writing, political affairs reporting,
 even book reviewing-but not propaganda, psycholog-
 ical warfare, and the sociology of political conflict.
 But more and more is this gap being recognized as
 editors turn to "depth" reporting to meet growing read-
 ership  sophistication  and  compete  with  electronic
 media on "spot" news. It is not too optimistic to predict
 that in a few years every newspaper large enough to
 have a business editor, garden writer, or editorial page
 editor will also have some staffer who has made some
 special study of the sociology and psychology of ex-
 tremist groups and hate ideologies, and who devotes at
 least part time to keeping track of communist strategy
 and tactics-for example, by reading The Worker twice
 weekly (subscriptions cost $7.00 yearly), or the Mos-
 cow-published monthly' of the international communist
 movement, International Affairs (available in English for
 $3.50 a year).
 Even so, the current vacuum in journalism education
 concerning psychopolitical warfare, which tremendous'
 ly affects the mass communications media, is a little
 surprising. The Library of Congress at the request of
 Sen. Karl Mundt (R., S.D.) surveyed 46 journalism de-
 partments accredited in 1962 by the American Coun-
 cil on Education for journalism and found that 22 of-
 fered no courses even brushing psychological warfare
 and propaganda, insofar as course descriptions indi-
 cated. In the rest, 51 courses here amorphous titles rang-
 ing from "Attitudes and Media Research Methods" to
 "The Press and World Affairs." Only eight schools out
 of the entire 48 had courses bold enough to mention
 the word "propaganda" in their title and the course
 descriptions showed that most were irrelevant. Out of
 the hundreds surveyed in the entire United States, only
 two courses seemed to zero directly in:
 1, SEMINAR IN PROPAGANDA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL.
 WARFARE, at Boston University-primarily concerned with
 the study of propaganda and psychological warfare develop-
 ments in the twentieth century. Major emphasis on case study
 approach to important private and governmental efforts at
 home and abroad. Special attention to social and political im-
 plications of such activities. Evaluations of worth of different
 methods of persuasion and of utilization of the mass media
 of cornmmrication. Direct importnnee of these subjects to the
 free societies, the garrison states, and the under-developed
 areas in the world. A three semester-hour course.
 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE  AND PROPAGANDA,
 At Washington & Lee University-"Functions, tactics and me-
 dia of psychological and political warfare, with special refer-
 ence to World War 11 and contemporary world conflict. Or-
 gaol .noon and strategy of information programs; cultural
 Of.      military procedures." A three-hour course.
 Prof. O. W. Riegel, who teaches the Washington &
 Lee class, says his course deals directly with psycholog-
 ical manipulation and the cold war. "We try to cover
 the policy-making apparatus of the United States and
 Soviet Union, the propaganda directives of the two
 countries, and how their propaganda works out in prac-
 tice. We spend quite a bit of time on Soviet and com-
 munist operations. But we make no case studies or post
 mortems on communist manipulations of the Western
 press."
 Washington & Lee graduates only eight or nine jour-
 nalism majors annually. If the Library of Congress sur-
 vey is indicative, pitifully few of the annual crop of
 American journalism graduates get even a whiff of this
 vital subject matter.
 There is a silver lining however. Prof. Riegel's course
 has proved so popular it attracts 30 to 50 students ev-
 ery year from history and political science majors. And
 he says it excites a lot of student interest, indicating
 there will be a good campus "market" for such courses
 if journalism departments introduce them.
 Recognizing  that  courses  outside  the  journalism
 schools would be available to journalism students, the
 Library of Congress checked the full curricula of the
 five metropolitan universities  of Washington,    D.C.
 Since these have many. students studying for military,
 diplomatic and other government careers, they offer
 highly non-typical concentrations on international af-
 fairs and conflict. But even they offered only two
 courses whose descriptions might attract a journalism
 student shopping the university catalog for a good sur-
 vey of psychopolitieal warfare and propaganda. Cath-
 olic University offers "Strategy and Tactics of Organ-
 ized Communism," and Georgetown University, even
 though its international relations school is renowned as
 a "prep" school for the Foreign Service, offers only one,
 "Propaganda,  Political  Warfare  and  Revolutionary
 Techniques in the 20th Century." Teaching this six-
 hour course is Dr. James D. Atkinson, a recognized au-
 thority who was consultant to President Truman's Psy-
 chological Strategy Board, a veteran intelligence offi-
 cer and National War College lecturer.
 But there's still a hitch.
 "The last time I taught the course I had nine stu-
 dents-and no journalists," Dr. Atkinson reports.
 The simple fact is that a journalist who has not
 studied the history of communist operational techniques
 is hardly more equipped to report or comment on to-
 day's world or handle copy on the cold war than a doc-
 tor who has never studied the measles syndrome is
 competent to practice medicine.
 He needs a solid factual course on the sociology, psy-
 chology and history of insurgency, guerrilla warfare, ur-
 bin terrorism, and the organizational warfare tech'

 and the
 COLD WAR_ , continued
 niques of the communists. This doesn't mean tuning
 journalists into witch hunters, but they should know
 more about such operations historically, write and talk
 more about them so that the American people will be
 better informed, all in a cool, calm, factual and sophis-
 ticated fashion. The history of Soviet psychological
 warfare and policy sabotage through such operations
 as the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Harry Dex-
 ter  White-Alger  Hiss  interlocking  subversion  rings
 should be as much a part of the equipment of every
 journalist as the John Peter Zenger trial and the Hearst
 role in the Spanish-American War.
 Recently, Allen W. Dulles, former CIA director ad-
 dressing the American Association of School Adminis-
 trators, made an appeal that could be addressed to the
 nation's journalism educators as well:
 "I am convinced that unless we increase our understanding
 of the real nature of the communist threat and improve upon
 our techniques to meet it, the past may well prove to be the
 prologue to further advances of communism. The nature of
 the communist apparatus must be exposed to the world as best
 we can, through the press, through publications, in public
 addresses and in the schoolrooms. The fact that it has at tines
 been able to work in secret until the moment of actual take-
 over has been a major contributin  cause of the success they
 have had. I earnestly ask you to Bnd a place for teaching the
 hard facts about the communist program to undermine out
 free way of life"
 Ten years ago to suggest "teaching communism in
 the schools" was to risk being smeared by McCarthy-
 ists as "pinko". Today it means risking being labeled a
 "neo-McCarthyist" or "right-winger". Fortunately there
 is an admirable precedent that could servo as a model
 for professional action by a society like Sigma Delta
 Chi.
 Today, the American Bar Association conducts a
 three-prong program: 1. internal self-education; 2. a
 continuing analysis of communist tactics, strategy and
 objectives; and 3. the promotion of teacher training
 institutes so that public school teachers may get both
 sound scholarly knowledge and professional guidance
 in presenting it. The Commmittee taps graduate centers
 such as the Georgetown University Center for Strategic
 studies, the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and
 Peace at Stanford University; the University of Pennsyl-
 vania Foreign Policy Research Institute, and the Uni-
 versity of South Carolina Institute of International
 Studies.
 Currently the ABA is issuing two timely studies: 1.
 "Peaceful Coexistence-A  Communist  Blueprint for
 Victory," a sifting of the evidence of "internal" com-
 munist communications which indicates that "peaceful
 coexistence" in the Red lexicon means more cold war
 by subversion, insurgency and social demolition tech-
 niques; 2. "Communist Propaganda on the Campus,"
 summarizing propaganda themes now being promoted
 by top U.S. communists in their speaking forays on
 American campuses. The ABA has given both respect-
 ability and coherence to a national movement that might
 otherwise have turned into a McCarthyistic-Birchite
 brouhaha.
 Ise t it time SDX, the one professional society rep-
 resenting all news media, joined the ABA pioneering
 in this field? Of course so broad or elaborate an effort
 is neither practical nor desirable now, but the Society
 might begin by establishing a committee to encourage
 professional development through chapter workshops,
 journalism courses and research. Such a committee
 could offer a centralized collecting point for experience,
 guidance and general information to interested chap-
 ters and professors. Any such undertaking is of course
 fraught with hazards. Opportunities for lunacy and in-
 eptitude are legion. But the job must be done by re-
 sponsible leaders or it will be botched by cranks and
 witch hunters. The hazards can be avoided by one com-
 mon-sense rule and one corollary.
 RULE: An SDX committee on education about com-
 munism must stick to its mission-education. Not indoc-
 trination. Not censorship. Not name-calling. Not witch-
 hunting.
 COROLLARY: The committee and the teachers,
 courses and workshops it would inspire must stick to
 facts. Not conjecture, not speculation, not propound-
 ing dogma, not prescribing remedies or telling jour-
 nalists how to practice their profession.
 Let us teach the facts about communist operational
 methods and propaganda themes in their orchestration
 of psychopolitical warfare, insofar as diligent, objective
 scholarship can reveal them through case studies. This
 knowledge should be a part of the professional equip-
 ment of every journalist in this "century of conflict"
 SDX, as a society devoted to truth, has a duty to help
 supply that equipment by encouraging the teaching
 and research in our journalism schools needed for a
 deeper, more systematic knowledge of the facts. In the
 spirit of the Scripps-Howard motto, the profession will
 then be better able to "give light and the people will
 find their own way."                             ^

 PROVIDING FOR A FREEDOM COMMISSION          159
 The January 1965 Issue of the Reader's Digest also featured an article written
 by Mr. Methvln. It was entitled "How the Reds Make a Riot." It is an excellent
 description of the techniques of riot-instigation, one of the unconventional war-
 fare techniques Communists in all parts of the world are using against the
 United States, its allies, and, as a matter of fact, against all non-Communist
 governments.
 Following the publication of this article in the Reader's Digest, Mr. Methvin
 received a letter from an Indonesian in the United States, who asked that the
 letter be kept confidential. This letter points out the desperate need of freedom-
 loving people in foreign nations for assistance in combating Communist efforts
 to take over their respective countries.  The writer of this letter wants help.
 He has heard of the Freedom Academy and asks, "Could you please tell me how
 can I join the Freedom Academy?"
 The reply which Mr. Methvin wrote to this Indonesian states in blunt terms,
 and terms which I am afraid we cannot refute, the complete inability of the
 United States at the present time to give to such persons really effective assist-
 ance in preventing Communists from subjugating' additional nations of the
 world.
 Why can't we give really effective help? Basically, it is because we do not
 have the know-how which the Freedom Academy can make available.  It is
 because in our struggle with communism-a struggle that, if we take the Commu-
 nists at their word, is going to see the end of us or of communism-we are still
 relying on outmoded, inadequate 19th century weapons-dollars, guns, and news
 and information programs delivered in a fashion with little appeal for the
 masses and which is not even designed to convince them that our cause is just
 and right and communism is evil, wrong, and inimical to their best interests.
 Mr. Chairman, I ask that these last three items I have mentioned, Mr. Meth-
 vin's Reader's Digest article, the letter he received as a result of it, and his reply
 to the letter, be made a part of the record at this point. I have excised the. letter
 in question so as to eliminate any possibility that the writer might be identified
 through its contents.

 Red Tornado. Consider the riot
 as it was wielded in Panama last
 January. That four-day anti-Ameri-
 can maelstrom left 24 dead, 400 in-
 jured, two million dollars' worth of
 property damaged. When U. S.
 troops were fired on by snipers and
 forced to shoot back, the little repub-
 lic's charges of "U.S. aggression"
 were blazoned around the world.
 What really happened in Pana-
 ma? Communists were already pre-
 paring to exploit frictions arising
 from a bus strike when a better issue
 fell into their laps. U.S. students at
 Balboa High School, defying agree-
 ments to fly the flags of both Pana-
 ma and the United States at speci-
 fied places, hoisted the U.S. flag
 alone on their school's flagpole.
 Informants hurried the news to
 Panama's communist Minister of
 Education, Solis Palma, and within
 hours students and hundreds of in-
 nocent Panamanian patriots were
 decoyed into a Red-planned tornado.
 Experts, reconstructing the Panama
 explosion, unearthed these facts:
 ? "Molotov  cocktails"  thrown
 against U.S. homes, places of busi-
 ness and automobiles contained not
 improvised rags stuffed into bottle-
 necks but meticulously hand-sewn
 wicks. Student members of a pro-
 Castro Red organization had stayed
 after school making the fire bombs
 a full week before the riots.
 ? An amazed American witness
 stood beside a radio commentator
 broadcasting into a portable trans-
 mitter : "Ten thousand persons are
 defying the bullets, going toward
 the Canal Zone. . . . The North
 American troops are machine-gun-
 ning the brave Panamanian patriots.
 ... Tanks are now in our territory."
 What the commentator was describ-
 ing bore no resemblance to the scene
 before them -a small crowd of spec-
 tators watching a fire-bombed Bra-
 niff Airways office burn. (Not one
 U.S. tank or machine gun was used
 during the four days of disorder.)
 ? A Panamanian carrying a cam-
 era rushed from the Legislative Pal-
 ace, drew a pistol and shot a man in
 the crowd. Affidavits from onlook-
 ers have confirmed that the killer
 then snapped a photograph of the
 body, stepped into a waiting auto
 and sped away. Later, six known
 communists led a funeral procession
 for "martyrs murdered by the North
 American imperialist troops."
 ? Panamanian President Roberto
 Chiari, under pressure from com-
 munist aides and fellow travelers,
 ordered the troops of Panama's Na-
 tional Guard to stay in their bar-
 racks for four days.* During the
 peak of the violence, he appeared on
 the Presidential Palace balcony with
 communist agitator Victor Avila,
 who tongue-lashed the crowds on to
 new attacks against the Yanquis.
 *At Panama's request, the highly regarded
 International commission of jurists, from
 Geneva, Switzerland, conducted an on-the-
 scene investigation and concluded that if
 Panama authorities had acted promptly  the
 violence and damage to property and tragic
 casualties would not, in alt probability, have
 occurred."

 learned in M.irch      When their
 peaceful   demollst r.itiotl all nrlenl-
 plovtncnt moved into London, Reds
 sneaked into their ranks and in-
 vaded the entrance to Parliament
 whcrc, traditionally, demonstrations
 are not allowed. Mounted police in-
 tervened, and a battle raged for an
 hour. Following instructions ofTcred
 by the Dail,  If %ul~er on "Ilow to
 Unhorse a Cop by Quick and Cer-
 tain Means," rioters pressed lighted
 cigarettes  against  horses'  flanks.
 London newspapers called it one of
 the ugliest riots in recent history.
 Stage 2. So/ten up the populace
 with cvmbol, and slogans. In the
 opening phase of a propaganda c.tm-
 p.rrgn. Red professionals never use
 All upr nlc Cu mnumist cruse to sway
 people t.. their way of thinking.
 Rather, they seize upon universal as-
 pirations for ''peace," "bread," "civil
 liberties " "freedom," and then cast
 these  :aspirations  in inflammatory
 "class warfare" lingo. As scapegoats
 for all  frustration they point  to
 "[;.S. imperialism," "capitalist ex-
 ploiters" or "the white po er elite."
 Under a steady drumfire of such
 hate slogans, ordinar% citizens can
 be worked up sufficiently to move
 into the .streets when the cornrnu-
 lusts sound their riot gongs.
 So effective is the sloganeering
 that Reds organized riots against
 higher tram fares in C,dcutta and
 higher electric rates in Buenos AAires,
 against U.S. forces in J.Ipan and
 against a Congressional hearing in
 San Francisco.

 offers of free transportation, cell
 chiefs attract the curious, the un-
 happy, the bored and the lazy who
 gather at any circus, fire or ruckus.
 Crowds may also be hired. In Brazil,
 an American mingled with demon-
 strators protesting the death of Red-
 leaning Congolese politician Patrice
 Lumumba. "Who is this Lumum-
 ba?" he asked the people around
 him. Nobody knew. "Where is the
 Congo?" Nobody knew that either.
 "Why are you here?" The answer:
 "I was paid ten cruzeiros."
 In Japan, during the weeks of the
 anti-Eisenhower demonstrations in
 1960, Red agitators so regularly hired
 all applicants away from unemploy-
 ment offices that police were able to
 tell newsmen that the absence of
 lines at those offices in the morning
 meant certain demonstrations in the
 evening. Japanese security officials
 estimate that the five weeks of anti-
 American violence cost the Reds a
 minimum of $1,400,000.
 Stage 4. Agitate the crowd. Com-
 munists follow various patterns to
 fit the tactical situation when ex-
 ploiting the mob. They may herd it
 closely like sheep or raise the tension
 like a boiler until it explodes. But
 the fundamental methods are the
 same. Here, based largely on docu-
 ments captured from the Iraqi Com-
 munist Party, is how a Red "secret
 staff" runs off a demonstration:
 External command: The riot com-
 mander and his staff take up stations
 well removed from the activity, from
 which they can observe the entire
 "battlefield."
 Internal command: Red cadres
 within the crowd direct the dem-
 onstration under the external
 command's orders. The internal
 commander, always closely guarded,
 often posts himself near a particular-
 ly conspicuous banner so that scouts
 and messengers can find him at all
 times. (In the anti-U.S. demonstra-
 tions in. Caracas in 1958, Vice Presi-
 dent Richard Nixon found that he
 could identify mob leaders: they
 rode piggyback on the shoulders of
 others, to be able to see better and to
 give directions.)
 Messengers; They carry orders
 and intelligence between the inter-
 nal and external commands, and
 report on police movements.
 Shock guards: Armed with pipes
 and staves, these men wait in reserve.
 If police attack the communists, they
 jump in and provide a blitz to cover
 the communists' retreat.
 Cheering sections: Loud-mouthed
 agitators are carefully rehearsed in
 slogans to chant and the order in
 which to chant them.
 Police baiters: Specially trained
 women scream hysterically, faint at
 policemen's feet or claw at their
 faces. Other pawns are instructed to
 roll marbles under the hoofs of po-
 licemen's horses, attack them with
 razor blades on the end of poles, or
 jab them with pins, causing them to
 rear and charge through the crowd
 and thus provide photographers
 with "proof" of "police brutality."

 T68          PROVIDING FOR A FREEDOM COMMISSION
 and otherwise aiding the ABA
 program.
 2. Seek advice from those who
 have had experience in the kind of
 political in-fighting required to ex-
 pose and defeat the communist "hid-
 den persuaders." The communists
 devote "not their spare evenings but
 the whole of their lives," as Lenin
 commanded, to engineering social
 strife and violence. Amateurs who
 oppose them must learn fast. The
 following organizations offer infor-
 mation and assistance born of ex-
 perience: American Institute for
 Free Labor Development,  1925 K
 Street, N.W., Washington, D. C.
 20006; National Strategy Informa-
 tion Center,  12!  E. 21 St., New
 York,  N.Y. iooai;  Information
 Council of the Americas (INCA),
 620 Gravier St., New Orleans,
 La. 70130.
 3. Wherever Red agents of vio-
 lence set up party units or front
 groups, citizens must organize spe-
 cific attack forces to wreck the
 wreckers before their organizations
 are deployed for action. By keeping
 an ear to the ground and intelligence
 channels to official agencies open,
 citizens' groups can isolate the engi-
 neers of social demolition. In New
 Orleans, for example, when Lee
 Harvey Oswald, later assassin of
 President Kennedy, started organiz-
 ing a chapter of the Fair Play for
 Cuba Committee, there to expose
 him was INCA, which produces
 anti-communist radio programs to
 counter mass demonstrations to Lat-
 in America. Edward Butler, INCA's
 executive vice president, debated Os-
 wald on a radio panel and, using
 officially documented data, forced
 him to admit his Marxist devotion
 and defection to Russia. Thus iso-
 lated, Oswald soon left town, dem-
 onstrating once more that exposure
 is democracy's most potent weapon
 against such hatemongers.
 4. Where prevention fails, citizens
 must overwhelmingly support civil
 authorities and police to maintain
 order. In Harlem, after the first
 violence flared last summer, civil-
 rights leaders called together every
 non-communist organization in the
 community-69 of them-and
 formed the United Harlem Organi-
 zations. Working closely with police
 to expose and isolate the incendi-
 aries, they distributed thousands of
 leaflets urging people to stay away
 from a communist-called rally. The
 rally fizzled. The UHO is now
 working hard to counteract the com-
 munist-promoted "police brutality"
 sloganeering, a decades-old commu-
 nist stratagem diabolically designed
 to hamstring proper police action.
 Rights groups everywhere must ex-
 pose it as energetically as they seek
 to prevent real instances of excessive
 force.           -
 The lesson of the rising global tide
 of Red-led violence is one of the old-
 est lessons of history: eternal vigi-
 lance is the price of liberty.

 Dear Mr. Methvin,
 I was very much impressed by your article "How the reds make a
 riot" in the January issue of the Reader's Digest.
 Eventhough I could not agree wholly with what you say, I do rehlize_
 that the most effective way to,fight Communism is using their
 own methods.
 It is the future of my country Indonesia that compel me to write
 this letter. What is going to happen if President Sukarno is dead?
 I assume then the Communists will "ake a break to  'et in power.
 Who is going to stop them? Or will it be another Korea or Vietnam?
 I believe wee who still believe in freedom have to prevent Indonesia
 from falling into Communist hands.
 Unfortunately, we do not know and do not have the means how to fight
 the Communists.
 I have written to the American Institute For Free Labor Development,
 but  that organization is for Latin Arerica only.
 Could you please tell me how can I join the Freedom Academy?
 I am a.            -   in this country and I want to return to"my
 country not only-with`            knowledge, but also how to fight
 Communism.
 This opinion of mine is shared by many of us who study in your
 country.
 I thank you beforehand and God bless you.

 Your letter of Pebxnary 13 tooted me deeply.  I
 have delayed aaswmring few so long because I have bees
 groping for an adsr$tate answer - but there is now.
 You see, though the words done hard, I must tell you
 that my country, the so-called "brsseal of Democracy"
 and leader of the free uorid, offers virtaallyn>'thiag
 to a young area lilac you wdo vaata mad seeks training is

 away the lives of hundreds of thousands and heap misery
 upon millions.  Politics, which is basically the art of
 human organization, is the master science -- and all who
 love mankind must study and practice it.  "Man is by
 nature a political animal," said Aristotle.    And it's
 no use doctoring his body if his politics are bad --
 for he will die anyway.  And who shall doctor the ills
 of the body politick? where are the great academies that
 train professionals in this master science?
 They are, ironically, all to be found in Russia or
 China or -- now -- Cuba.  '!hose countries operate scores
 of institutes and schools teaching all the arts of
 "revolutionary warfare"; the organization of youth, stu-
 dents, farmers, women, professors, etc.; the infiltra-
 tion of communications media, armed forces, police and
 governments the fomenting of strikes, mass demonstrations
 and bloody riots; and the ultimate seizure of power and
 totalitarianization of nations, with all the bloodshed
 and starvation that inevitably follow.  (Cuba alone is
 turning out 1500 to 2500 trained revolutionaries a year
 from all over Latin America.)  These schools have been
 running since 1921, when Lenin started the "University of
 the Workers of the East" for Asians such as you.
 Indeed, your own country of Indonesia has sent un-
 told hundreds to the Lenin School and its successor col-
 leges of destruction.  The Communist Party of Indonesia
 (PXI) after its founding on May 23, 1920, very quickly
 established contact with representatives of the Soviet
 Union and its "Communist international" or Comintern.
 One of the founders, Semaun, visited the Comintern repre-
 sentative in Shanghai and was sent on to Moscow in 1922
 for the "First Congress of the Workers of the East,"
 one of Lenin's gimmicks to attract recruits he planned
 to use to implant Communist Parties throughout Asia.
 Semaun want back to Indonesia, was expelled in 1923 for
 leading a strike, and spent the next 20 years in Russia
 and Europe, attending Comintern congresses, training
 on the job in its international operation, and lecturing
 in its training schools.  Alimin, another Red leader,

 went to the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928 and stayed
 to study at the Lenin School with such future Red chief-
 tains as Chores of France, Browder and Gus Hall of the
 United States, Sharkey of Australia, Chou En-Lai of
 China, Pollitt of Great Britain, and Sanzo Nozaka of
 -Japan.  Darsono, run out of Indonesia by the Dutch in
 1925 for strike fomentation, went to Moscow and spent
 the years 1929-30 at the Lenin School.  So one knows
 how many other Indonesian communists went to this and
 other schools of revolution during these early years.
 But these years of schooling and revolutionary apprentice-
 ship gave then the organizational and agitational know-
 how that enabled them after World War II to not up a
 revived Communist Party, with their own schools and
 organization, and make the P!I the largest Communist Party
 in the world outside the Sino-Soviet nations.  And so
 the plight of Indonesia today is really in large measure
 the result of training operations that Lenin began in
 Moscow 44 years ago.
 Fifteen years ago, after the communist takeover of
 China and at the time of the Korean war, a handful of
 Americans in Orlando, Florida, studied Lenin's works
 and the peculiar political education system he started
 and realised the nature of this global communist program
 for professionalizing social conflict.  This was the
 beginning of the "Freedom Academy" proposal which I have
 described in the enclosed article from The Reader's Digest
 of May 1963.
 It is sad to have to report to you that the Freedom
 Academy is still, at this late date in the 20th year of
 the cold war, no more than an idea.  Bills to create such
 an institution have languished in Congress for the last
 five years.  This year the prospect is bright that the
 Souse will pass it, for the House Committee on Un-American
 Activities has held several hearings and compiled impres-
 sive evidence of urgent need.  But the situation in the
 Senate is less favorable.  Hearings were held in the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee in May 1963, but the chair-
 man, Senator Fulbright, did not seem persuaded of the
 need for the legislation, and since that time the situa-
 tion in the Senate has been stagnant.  If the House does

 pass the bill, however, the chances are good that Senate
 sponsors will press for some kind of action, though
 I am afraid the State Department's wrongheaded and selfish
 opposition may prevent passage.  Unfortum tely, there
 are still too many idealists and optimists who have
 never accepted the realities about communism, even as
 Neville Chamberlain found it impossible to face up to
 the reality of Mr. Hitler until too late.  This is a
 blindness which, I fear, will have to be paid for by the
 blood of many fine people like you and your countrymen
 in Indonesia, who are already in grave danger of takeover
 by the Red professionalsi and by many young American
 soldiers who find themselves bogged down in wars like
 South Vietnam because our civilian and military officials
 in Washington do not know that to do to thwart the trained
 communist conflict managers before the shooting starts.
 I do have faith in freedom, the democratic process
 and the ultimate rationality of man, and I think that
 before so very many more years pass by, the United States
 will have a Freedom Academy -- simply because the facts
 of life and Red imperialism are compelling ever wider
 recognition of the desperate need.

 process and the ultimate rationality of man, I think that
 before so very many more years pass by, the united states
 will have a Freedom Academy -- simply because the facts

 no institution in the entire United States offers training
 in the strategy, tactics and organizational know-how you
 and others like you need to contend against the Leninist
 professionals.
 Ironically, there is one nation in the free world
 which is moving to fill this "training gap," and that is
 the Republic of Korea.  Impressed by the Freedom Academy
 proposal in the U.S. Senate, a few years ago the Asian
 People's Anti-Communist League, a non-governmental asso-

 to move ahead on its own and build a Freedom Center in
 Seoul, Korea.  With backing from the Republic of Korea
 government and other governmental and non-governmental
 groups in Asia, that,,p;ojct is moving steadily forward,

 despite great obstacles and a tragic apathy throughout
 Europe and the United States.  Senator Thomas J. Dodd,
 a leading sponsor of the U.S. Freedom Academy bill,
 visited Seoul to speak at the Freedom Center on April 4,
 1965, and I enclose a copy of his speech for your infor-

 or perhaps the Korean Embassy in Washington could tell

 STATEMENT OF HON. HALE BOGGS, U.B. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
 LOUISIANA
 it is Indeed a pleasure to testify once again before this committee on behalf
 of the enactment of an important proposal for strengthening our Nation in its
 worldwide commitments. My bill, H.R. 2379, and similar bills sponsored by my
 colleagues in the House, providing for the establishment of a Freedom Academy
 and & .Freedom Commission, is a constructive piece of legislation for the benefit
 of our country and the free world.
 As members of this committee know, this legislation enjoys a growing bipartisan
 support in both Houses of the Congress, and I am most hopeful we will have the
 opportunity to act on It in this session. It is my understanding that the outlook
 for House action in this session Is better than ever before,  I am confident this
 committee, chaired by my good friend and colleague, Ed Willis of Louisiana,
 will do everything possible to report this legislation so that the House can act
 on it.
 Mr. Chairman, as all of you know, we have only to look at the Communist
 infiltration and subversion in South Vietnam today and in other countries In
 Southeast Asia (such as Malaya, Laos, Thailand) and in the developing nations
 of Africa and Latin America to realize the great effectiveness and the great
 danger which these nefarious activities are producing in many parts of the world.
 The Communist-trained members of the guerrilla army, the Viet Cong, are
 continuing to Infiltrate into South Vietnam from the north and to operate in a
 subversive manner, as well as to engage in open warfare with South Vietnamese
 and American troops, These Viet Cong guerrillas not only battle the South Viet-
 namese and American soldiers with bullets, but also they employ all manner
 of propaganda, nonmilitary, and subversive techniques to weaken the will of the
 people of South Vietnam to continue their fight against Communist aggression.
 Both the Soviet Union and Communist China have well-trained agents deployed
 around the world, particularly in the new developing nations of Asia, Africa, and
 Latin America-there to ply various malevolent tactics of agitation, espionage,
 and subversion, designed to foment revolution and the overthrow of existing gov-
 ernments.  The Red Chinese now are quite active In the new nations of Africa
 and in some of the countries in Latin America.  With unceasing pressure, these
 Communist agents are driving to bring more peoples into their dictatorial orbit.
 They will stop at nothing to achieve their diabolical goals.
 Therefore, it is most important that we In the United States, as the leader of
 the free world, take new and positive steps, through the full use of our citizens
 from both the public and private sectors of our society, to counter this Com-
 munist offensive around the globe.  We can do so by training our own citizens
 and certain foreign nationals who are visiting our country to combat these Com-
 munlat nonmilitary techniques with their own information and tactics.
 But such skills In nonmilitary techniques cannot be attained through cor-
 respondence courses at home-they should be taught by knowledgeable and
 trained professionals at a special school.
 I am confident that the best means to provide this specialized training Is to
 enact this legislation to establish a Freedom Academy and a Freedom Commission
 as a separate arm of our National Government,  That is why I am sponsoring
 this legislation, and why I offer my firm conviction on the need for Its enactment.
 The Freedom Academy would make use of some of our Nation's best talent and
 brains from both the public and private sectors of our society.  Particularly, do
 we need to employ the services of our educated and dedicated private citizens
 in this continuing battle for men's minds.  I know there is a great, untapped
 source of imagination, patriotism, and dedication among our private citizens,
 many of whom would gladly take this specialized training in nonmilitary tech-
 niques in order to do their part to maintain our freedom and that of other na-
 tions In the world.  The fact is that we do not now have, even for the training
 of our Government personnel, an agency of our National Government to provide
 an extensive course in nonmilitary propaganda tactics.  I am convinced we need
 such an agency in the form of a Freedom Academy.
 The Communist base in Cuba has brought home to the people of the New
 Orleans area and of south Louisiana, as well as the country as a whole, the very
 real threat posed by the worldwide Communist conspiracy.  If there ever was any
 doubt before Castro revealed his true colors as a Communist puppet that the

 PROVIDING FOR
 United states does need to train our citizens to meet the Red peril, then surely
 there can be no doubt now.  Agents in Cuba are being trained to export their
 tactics of nonviolent or violent overthrow of other governments in Latin America.
 Thus far, their efforts have been foiled in Venezuela,. Colombia, and Chile, but
 conditions are not fully stable in those countries even now.  Thus we should not
 be lulled into any false security. As you _now, the stability of some of the Latin
 nations is volatile, and our successes of today could be eclipsed tomorrow, unless
 we maintain a keen alertness throughout our hemisphere.
 To emphasize this point, I would call attention to those members who may
 not have read it, a penetrating column in the Washington Post of March 31, 1965,
 by two of our Nation's most able ana respected journalists-Rowland Evans and
 Robert Novak.  In this column they write of Fidel Castro's attempts in recent
 months ",to accelerate his export of Communist revolution."
 They also note that the United States' strong stand in Vietnam has definitely
 hindered the effectiveness of Castro'?s program to export Communist revolutions
 to other nations in Latin America.
 However, Evans and Novak go on to say that Castro's "new drive was launched
 at the hemispheric conference of Communist parties in Havana last November.
 With Moscow's concurrence, it was determined there to pick up the pace of terror
 and guerrilla warfare."
 Their column continues :
 "The result since January has been threefold : The beginning of new terrorist
 activities in Guatemala and Honduras ; a step-up in chronic guerrilla action by
 Colombian Reds ; and continuation of the long campaign of violence by Venezuela's
 Communists."
 Evans and Novak point up the positive effects of the United States' stand in
 Vietnam and note that its weakening impact is very real on Castro's plans to
 foment Communist revolutions in the Western Hemisphere.
 They assert "the strong U.S. stand in Vietnam * * * hurts subversive com-
 munism throughout the hemisphere.  It shows Latin America that an Uncle Sam
 willing to risk all in far-off Southeast Asia won't hesitate to intervene in the
 Guatemalan jungles or the Colombian hills if need be.  This stiffens the spines
 of Latin American governments."
 All of this emphasizes, to my mind, that our country should press any propa-
 ganda advantages in various parts of the world where we do have the upper
 hand and move into those places where we are today in a vulnerable position.
 Because I think this column by Evans and Novak is pertinent to the commit-
 tee's consideration of legislation to create a Freedom Academy and a 'reedom
 Commission, I would like to include it at this point in the extensive record which
 I know the committee is compiling.  The text of the column follows :
 [Washington Post, March 31, 1965]
 CASTRO AND VIETNAM
 Speaking at the University of Havana in mid-March, Fidel Castro
 reached the climax of his harangue with these words :
 "We are in favor of giving Vietnam all the help it needs. We want the
 help to be in the form of arms and men.  We want the Socialist (Com-
 munist) camp to take whatever steps are necessary for the sake of
 Vietnam."
 This was the signal for a trained claque to break out with sustained
 applause and a rhythmic collegelike cheer (in rough translation, "Let's
 .hit the Yankees hard").  Despite these standard comic-opera trappings,
 the Castro performance was studied with more than the usual care by
 Cubanologists in Washington.
 Their.. conclusion : Castro's program to subvert all Latin America, in
 the doldrums lately, has been slowed down still more by President John-
 son's strong stand in Vietnam. The Castro bravado about sending troops
 there was a clue how deeply the hard U.S. line in the Far East is cutting
 into the Castro program.
 Not generally known is the fact that in recent months Castro has
 sought to accelerate his export of Communist revolution.  His new drive
 was launched at the hemispheric conference of Communist parties in

 Havana last November.  With Moscow's concurrence, It was determined
 there to pick up the pace of terror and guerrilla warfare.
 The result since January has been threefold : The beginning of new
 terrorist activities in Guatemala and Honduras ; a step-up in chronic
 guerrilla action by Colombian Reds; and continuation of the long cam-
 paign of violence by Venezuela's Communists.
 The strong U.B. stand in Vietnam, coinciding with the new Castro
 campaign, hurts subversive communism throughout the hemisphere. It
 shows Latin America that an Uncle Sam willing to risk all in far-off
 Southeast Asia won't hesitate to Intervene in the Guatemalan jungles
 or the Colombian hills if need be.
 This stiffens the spines of Latin American governments.
 It is only natural that Castro be ahead of the rest of the Communist
 world in asking that arms and men be sent to the Viet Cong guerrillas.
 Moreover, he may well send a token Cuban contingent.  Looking ahead
 to a possible armed rising against his own forces, Castro needs to buttress
 the international principle of mutual security among Communists.
 Even more Important, Castro must maintain himself as an international
 figure to withdraw attention from his domestic failures.
 It should be added quickly that Castro is in no imminent danger of
 being overthrown.
 But Cuba today is a long way from a well-ordered Communist monolith.
 Telltale signs of turbulence crop up everywhere. Most recent were a new
 campaign to purge "bourgeois" elements from University student groups
 and the surprise appearance of Transportation Minister Faure Cbaumon
 (an old rival of Castro's) with a mysterious gunshot wound.
 Transcending all of this is Cuba's continuing economic stagnation. If
 all goes well during the next three years, Castro at best can hope to
 bring Cuba up to the miserable economic level he found when he seized
 power In 1959.  That's running at top speed to remain in the same place.
 If Castro is seen by his own people as a domestic failure rather than an
 international success, his doom may be brought just a little closer. That's
 why U.S. bombs dropped north of the 17th Parallel had fallout in
 Havana.
 The active use of the Ingenuity and talents of private citizens to join in the
 fight against Communist propaganda and subversion in the cold war has been
 admirably displayed for more than 4 years now by the Information Council of
 the Americas, based in my home city of New Orleans, La.  Under the able
 direction of Mr. Edward S. Butler 111. the executive vice president, this organ-
 ization known as INCA is doing a splendid job of promoting the significance
 of freedom by way of countering Communist propaganda and subversion In
 16 countries In Latin America.  INCA dispatches on a regular basis radio
 "Truth Tapes" to some 136 different stations in these countries.  These tapes
 feature Cuban refugees who relate their stories of escape from Castro's op-
 pression and the debased condition of their country and their people under
 his Communist regime.
 Recently, Juanita Castro, Fidel's sister, who defected from Cuba last sum-
 mer, gave an exclusive radio statement on Castro's Red dictatorship to Ed
 Butler of INCA.  Radio tapes of her call for freedom and for ousting commu-
 nism from all of Latin America were sent to 21 stations in Chile for use just
 prior to the recent. national election there.  The results were fruitful: the Com-
 munist-backed candidate was defeated, and this was achieved particularly by
 the response of the Chilean women to Juanita Castro's warning.  A.. substantial
 majority of their numbers voted against the Red-supported candidate.
 A recent article in the January 1983 Issue of Reader's Digest entitled "How
 the Reds :Bake a Riot,"' by Eugene H. Methvin of the Digest's Washington
 bureau, praises INCA and similar groups for their efforts against the Communist
 conspiracy.
 This article brought a positive and widespread reaction from people in the
 United States and around the world.  Particularly did students and teachers
 at colleges and universities In our Nation and in other countries respond and
 express a real Interest in this work to defend freedom and to strengthen it
 against the Communist offensive.
 Mr. Chairman, at this point I would like to submit for the record a cross-

 DEAR SIRS : I have just read an article in the January Issue of Reader's
 Digest which lists you as an organization offering information on how to
 fight communism.
 I would like the following information : What can the individual
 citizen do?  Is there any organization formed in Louisiana that citizens
 may join to do their share in fighting communism?  What Is the Federal
 Government doing? Has it formed a committee to alert the citizens of
 the United States against communism?  Is the Valley Forge Freedom's
 Foundation organized for those who want to do something against inter-
 national communism?  If so, how can one join?
 I have been interested in doing my part in fighting the Communists
 ever since we had an Americanism vs. Communism seminar in school
 last year.  Now that I have graduated I am anxious to find out if there
 is any organization, club, or foundation which is helping to alert the
 American citizens against propaganda, demoralization, socialism, etc.
 I would appreciate if you would answer this letter at your earliest
 convenience.
 Yours very truly,

 In addition to the 136 stations In the 16 Latin American countries which use
 INCA's "Truth Tapes," there are also some 426 stations in the United States
 which are cooperating to engender interest and solicit support for this patriotic
 work. These American stations in 43 of the 50 States are helping to provide their
 audiences with an insight and understanding Into political and social develop-
 ments and events in Latin America in recent years.
 In order to focus on the potential tragedy and the dangers inherent In the
 lack of alertness to crazed persons and Communist sympathizers in our midst,
 INCA has sold almost 8,040 copies of its recording of the apparent assassin of the
 late President Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald.  Oswald participated, along with
 Mr. Butler and other New Orleans citizens, in a general panel discussion on
 communism and democracy, broadcast over WDSU radio, New Orleans, just 3
 months before the tragedy of November 22, 1983.
 Mr. Butler, INCA's vice president ; Bill Slatter, a WDSU reporter ; Bill Stuckey,
 at the time a reporter for the New Orleans States-Item, Carlos Bringuier, a
 Cuban refugee from Castro's oppression ; and Oswald, then In New Orleans to
 promote the so-called Fair Play for Cuba Committee, took part In this program.

 On the program, Oswald showed himself to be an exponent, albeit not always
 an accurate one, of the Marxist line. Oswald's comments then, though some-
 times contradictory and meandering, gave no real hint of the very violent bent
 which his twisted mind soon was to take.
 The tape of this panel discussion was submitted to The President's Commis-
 sion on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, on which I had the
 sad duty participants and, on tththe same time, the e panel cooperated lfully o with the Commission land gave other
 some very useful information.
 The recording which INCA has sold throughout our country is entitled
 "Oswald : Self-Portrait in Red." I had the pleasure to introduce this recording,
 before the panel discussion opened. Dr. Alton Ochsner, of New Orleans, a world-

 CONGRESSMAN BOCCS:
 You are about to hear an historic recording.
 This recording was made in New Orleans last year.
 It is far once significant today to the light of
 subsequent event..
 It is to the credit of the private citizens
 of New Orleans that It was they who first recog-
 nized the bizarre and incredible activities of
 tee Harvey Oswald and brought his and his activi-
 ties to the attention of the public.  Credit is
 due to Radio Station 8DSU and to newsman Bill
 Slat ter who moderated this program so alertly,
 to Latin A ericen affairs reporter, Bill Stuckey,
 who sought wt Oswald and arranged the interview.
 and to Cuban refugee leader, Carlos Bringuier
 who refuted his blatant pro-Castro propaganda,
 And last, but certainly tsar least, to Ed,
 Butler, Harcufive Vice-President of INCA, the
 Information Council of the Americas, who develop-
 ed much new material on Oswald'. movements and
 activities, not only in New Orleans but elsewhere.
 Let me say a word about the purposes of INCA
 the organization which Mr. Butler direct..
 I have taken a very personal interest in
 INCA, as I said, a private organization which or-
 iginated to my own Congressional District.  On
 September 17, 1462, 1 said to my colleagues in
 the Congress chat INCA I. actively engaged in the
 defeat of tie Communist mwament through its TRUTH
 TAPE program - a program which provides scores of
 refugees from Communist tyranny the opportunity
 and the forum to relate their experiences on tape
 recordings for broadcast by radio stations
 throughour the America,.
 In this worthy counterattacks Hr. Butler
 hes been Joined by many highly respected private
 citizens, led by Dr. Alton Ochuner, president of
 The Information Counc It of the Americas, and an
 internationally famous surgeon from Hew Orleans.
 I concluded my remarka with the statement
 that such a program me INCA'. is a solid, force-
 ful way to counteract Red propaganda, infiltra-
 tion, and subversion.

 Cood evening, for the next few minutes Bill Stuckey
 and I, Bill whose program you've- probably heard on
 Saturday night, "Latin Listening Post", Bill and I
 are going to be talking with three gentlemen, the
 subject mainly revolving around Cuba.  our guests
 tonight are Lee Harvey Oswald, who is Secretary
 of the New Orleans Chapter of The Fair Play for
 Cuba Committee. a New York headquartered organi-
 eatimn which is generally recognised as the prin-
 cipal voice of the Castro gwarrment in this
 country,  Our second guest Is Ed Butler who is
 Executive Director of the Information Council of
 the Americas (INCA) which is headquartered in
 New Oriaans and specializes in distributing anti-
 comotmist educational materials throughout Latin
 America, and our third guest is Carlos Bringuier,
 Cuban refugee and New Orleans Delegate of the
 Revolutionary Student Directorate, one of the
 more active of the anti-Castro refugee organica-
 tiona.  Bill, if at this time you will briefly
 background the situation as you know it ...
 BILL STU EY,
 Thank you 5111.  First, for those who don't know
 too much about the background of The Fair Play
 for Cuba Committee, this is an organization that
 specializes primarily I. distributing literature,
 based in Hew York.  For the several years In
 which It has been in existence it has operated
 principally out of the East and out of the vest
 Coast and a few college campuses, recently, how-
 war , attempts have been made to organize a
 chapter here in New Orleans.  The only member of
 the group who has revealed hi self publicly so
 far is 23 year old Lae Harvey Oswald who is the
 Secretary of the local chapter of The Fair Play
 for Cuba Committee.  He first cow to public
 notice several days ago when he was arrested
 and convicted for disturbing the peace.  The
 ruckus In which he we involved started when
 several local Cuban refugees Including Carlos
 gringuier, who is with us tonight, discovered
 his distributing pro-Castro literature on a down-
 town street.  Now, Mr. Oswald and Bringuier are
 with us tonight to giv  us opposing view on The
 Fair Play for Cuba Committee and if. objectives.
 I believe that I we probably the first Hew
 Orleans reporter to Interview Mr. Oswald on his

 BILL STUCKEY, contd.
 Number One - the principal thing is that they
 insist that Caatro'e government today is comple-
 tely free and independent, and that it is in no
 way controlled by the Soviet Union.  Another
 cardinal point of The Fair Play for Cuba Committee's
 propaganda is that Premier Castro is forced to
 seek aid from the Russians only because the United
 States government refused to offer him financial
 aid.
 Following another line I asked Mr. Oswald if
 he had ever, or was, a member of the American
 Communist Party, and he said that the only organi-
 zation to which he belonged was The Fair Play for
 Cuba Committee.  Mr. Oswald also gave me this run
 down on his personal background: He said that he
 was a native of New Orleans, had attended Beaure-
 gard Junior High School and Warren Eastern High
 School.  Had entered the U.S. Marine Corps in
 1956 and was honorably discharged in 1959.  He said
 during our previous interview that he had lived in
 Ft. Worth, Texas before coming here to establish
 a Fair Play for Cuba chapter several weeks ago.
 However, there were a few items apparently that I
 suspect that Mr. Oswald left out in this original
 interview which was principally where he lived
 after, between 1959 and 1962.  We, er, Mr. Butler
 brought some newspaper clippings to my attention
 and I also found some too through an independent
 source, Washington newspaper clippings to the
 effect that Mr. Oswald had attempted to renounce
 his American citizenship in 1959 and become a
 Soviet citizen.  There was another clipping
 dated 1962 saying that Mr. Oswald had returned
 from the Soviet Union with his wife and child
 after having lived there for three years. Mr.
 Oswald are these correct?

 head of the Latin American countries and I can
 show you that in Cuba in 1958 every 37 persons
 had an automobile and in Russia was 200 persons
 for I auto; in Cuba was 6 persons for 1 radio
 and in Russia was 20 persons for I radio; in
 Cuba was 1 television set for 18 persons and in
 Russia was 85 persons for I television set; and
 in Cuba was I telephone for every 38 persons
 and in Russia was I telephone for every 580
 persons.  Cuba was selling the sugar in. the
 American market and was receiving from the U.S.
 more than one hundred million dollars a year
 over the price of the world market and the U.S.
 was paying to Cuba that price in dollars. Right
 now, Cuba is selling sugar to Russia.  Russia is
 paying to Cuba 80% in junks, machinery, and 20%
 in dollars.  I think that Cuba right now is a
 colony of Russia and the people of Cuba who is
 living in Cuba every day, who is escaping from
 Cuba every day, they disagree with you that
 you are representing the People of Cuba.  May-
 be you will represent the er, the colony of
 Russia here in this moment, but not the people
 of Cuba.  You cannot take that responsibility.
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 Well ... in order to give a clear and coincise
 and short answer to each of those, well, let's
 see, questions.  I would say that the facto
 and figures from a           country like
 Pakistan or Burma would even reflect more
 light upon Cuba inrelation to how many TV
 sets and how many radios and all that, er,
 this, I don't think that is a subject to be
 discussed tonight, er, the Fair Play for Cuba
 Committee as the name implies is concerned
 primarily with Cuban-American relations.
 LEE HARVEY OSWALD-
 That is correct.  Correct, yes.
 BILL STUCKEY:
 You did live in Russia for three years?
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 That is correct, and I think those, the fact
 that. I did live for a time in the Soviet Union
 gives me excellent qualifications to repudiate
 charges that Cuba and The Fair Play forCuba
 Committee is communist controlled.
 BILL SIATTER:
 Mr. Bringuier perhaps you would like to dis-
 pute that point.
 CARLOS BRINGUIER:
 I'd like to know exactly the name of the organi-
 zation that you represent here in the city, be-
 cause I have some confusion, is Fair Play for
 Cuba Committee or Fair Play for Russia Committe?
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 Well, that is very provocative request and I
 don't think requires an answer.
 CARLOS BRINGUIER:
 Well, I will tell you why because, before the
 communists take over Cuba, Cuba was at the
 BILL SCATTER:

 Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 Is it a secret society?
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 Er, no, Mr. Butler, it is not.  However it is
 standard operating procedure, er, for a poli-
 tical organization consisting of a er, poli-
 tical minority, er, to safeguard the names
 and number of its members.
 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 Well, the Republicans are in the minority,I-
 don't see them hiding their membership.
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 The Republicans are not a, well, er, the
 Republicans are an established political
 party, representing a great many people.
 They represent no radical point of view,
 they do not have a very violent and some-
 times emotional opposition, as we do.

 themselves with iwaatigating the Pair Play

 is nothing to connect the two committese.  We
 have been investigated from several points of

 findings Cr, have been as I say or, absolutely
 zero.
 EDWARD S. LURED;
 Well., I have a, the Senate Hearings before me
 and I think what I have in front of se re-
 fute, precisely every statement that you have
 dust mad..  For instance, who is the Honorary
 Chairman of She Fair Flay forCuba C?ittee'
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 Pr, the Honorary Chairman of this Committee,
 or, the acme of that person, or, I certainly
 don't know.
 BILL SLATTU:
 Ho. Oswald, if I may break in  now a moment,
 I believe it we mentioned that you at one
 time eked to renounce your American citizen
 ship and become a Soviet citizen, is that
 correct?
 LED H. OS ALD:
 Well, I don't think that has particular im-
 port to this discussion.  We era discussing
 ar, ar, Cuban-American relations...
 SILL SLATTEA:
 Well, I think it has a bearing to this ex-
 tent Mr. Omld, you say apparently that
 Cuba is not dominated by Russia and yet you
 apparently by your own past actions have
 shown that you have an affinity for Russia
 and perhaps commumtem, although I don't know
 that you admit that you either are a tar
 mint or have been, could you straighten
 out that point, era you, or have you been a
 communist?

 Well, 1 had answered that, or, prior to this
 program on another radio program...
 EDWARD 8. BDTLED;
 Well, 1st me tell you, in came you don't
 know about your own organization...
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 No, I know about it.
 M WARD S. BUTLER:
 His name Is Waldo Frank and I'm quoting
 from the 'Rtev laeses" of September, 1932
 in that, the title of his article, 'Row I
 Came to Coaaamiam - A Symposium" by Waldo
 Frank - "tbere I Stand and How I got
 There" or, now let me ask you a second
 question, who is the Secretary of the
 Fair Play forCubs Committee? the Rational
 Secretary?
 LEE H. OSWAID-
 Well, we have a National Director who is
 nor. V. T. Lee who to recently returned
 from Cube and because of the fact that
 the U.S. government has Imposed restric-
 tions on travel to Cuba he is now under
 indictment for his traveling to tuba.
 er, this however,        very convenient
 for righist organizations to drag out
 this or that literature purporting to
 show a fact which has notbeen establt-
 shed in law.  I have said that The
 Fair Play for Cuba Committed has de-
 finitely been investigated, that is vary
 true, but I will also may that the total
 result of that, ear, investigation was
 zero.  That is, The Fair Play for Cuba
 Committee is not now on the Attorney
 General's Subversive List, any other
 material you may have is superfluitous
 (sic)
 EDWARD S. BUrLMt:
 Oh, it is?
 BILL STU(SBT:
 Are you a M rust?
 LEE H. OSWALD!
 Yes , I mm a Marxist.
 7D IARD S. BOMBS:
 What's the difference?
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 The difference is primarily the difference
 between a country like Ghana (sic) Guiana,
 Jugoslavia, China or Russia.  A-very, very
 great differences.  Differences which we,
 or, appreciate by giving aid let's say to
 .tugoelavt in the sum of a hundred million
 or so dollars ^ year.
 EDWARD S. SUTLER,
 That's extraneous, what's the difference?
 LEE H. OSWAED:
 Tha, er, or, difference is as I said a
 very great difference, er, many Parties,
 many countries are based on Marxism. Sr,
 many countries such as Great Britain display
 very socialistic or, aspects and character-
 istics I might point to the socialised
 medicine of Britain.

 MARSHALL PEARCE:
 The only man in the listening audience
 who knew the full story of Oswald's defec-
 tion beforehand was Dr. Alton Ochener, the
 world famous New Orleans surgeon who is
 President of INCA.  Dr. Ochener, on a world
 tour as expert, consultant to the Surgeon
 General of theAir Force, has himself con-
 fronted delegates from communist China.  He
 has also seen and heard Red agitators and
 propagandists at work in Latin America. Here
 are his firsthand impressions of Lee Harvey
 Oswald.  Dr. Ochsner...
 DR.- ALTON OCHBNER:
 Thank You.  Since I was familiar with Os-
 wald's background, when I heard him smoothly
 admit his three year defection to Russia I
 was not overly surprised.  But when he tried
 to use his admission as a proof that The Fair
 Play for Cuba Committee was not communist
 controlled, I knew that Ed Butler was facing
 the same kind of propaganda "doublethink"
 that I had heard so many communists and
 their sympathizers use in my travels all
 over the world.
 However  as the interview went on and
 the hardhitting questions and factual evi-
 dence piled up, I relaxed.  Oswald had ob-
 vioulsy met his- match.
 It is important to remember that at
 that time, Oswald had technically committed
 no crime.  Therefore, no official could
 prevent him from spreading poison on the
 airwaves.
 Nor would any of us, who believe in the
 freedom of speech, want a Thought Control
 Agency to assume such powers.  Private
 citizens must meet the distortion with
 truth.  On the other hand, a professional
 approach, with indisputable facts and a
 planned strategy, is needed if private
 citizens are to provide the antidote for
 propaganda poison.
 Because the full facilities of INCA
 were available - for a change the propaganda
 battle was fought evenly.
 The results speak for themselves.
 Oswald dropped out of eight immediately
 after the debate, and left New Orleans
 shortly thereafter.  According to published
 reports he went to Mexico where he visited
 the Communist embassies of Russia and Cuba.
 Then he took up residence in an apartment
 in a Dallas suburb under the alias 0. H.
 Lee, where several letters from the same
 man written on the stationery of both the
 Co?uniat Party U.S.A. and The Fair Play
 for Cuba Committee, were reportedly found.
 Many who have heard this record have
 expressed the belief that if an INCA branch
 office had existed in Dallas, Oswald would
 again have been exposed, and the President
 DR. ALTON OCHSNER, contd.
 might be alive today.  No one can say for
 certain.  But as you listen to the second
 part of this record, think about it, and
 decide for yourself.
 MARSHALL PEARCE:
 This is the second segment of the "Conversa-
 tion Carte Blanche" interview, with Lee Har-
 vey Oswald on radio station WDSU, in New
 Orleans, exactly as it was broadcast a few
 weeks before President Kennedy's assassin=
 tion.....
 BOOTH ANNOUNCER:
 And now back to Conversation Carte Blanche.
 Here again Bill Slatter.
 BILL SCATTER:
 Tonight Bill Stuckey and I are talking with
 three guests Lee Harvey Oswald, who islocal
 secretary of a group called Fair Play for
 Cuba, and with Ed Butler, the Executive Vice
 President of the Information Council of the
 Americas (INCA), and Carlos Bringuier, a
 Cuban refugee and obviously anti-Castro. Mr
 Oswald as you might have imagined is on the
 hot seat tonight and I believe you, Bill
 Stuckey have a question.
 BILL STUCKEY:
 Mr. Oswald I believe you said in reply to a
 question from Mr. Butler that any questions
 about your background were extraneous to
 discussion tonight.  I disagree because of
 the fact that you refuse to reveal any of
 the other members of your organization so
 you are the face of The Fair Play for Cuba
 Committee in New Orleans.  Therefore, any-
 body who might be interested in this organi-

 this reason I'm curious to know just how

 BILL SLATrER:
 Did you say that you wanted to at one point
 though?  What happened?

 Well, it's a long drawn out ^ituat Lon, Cr,

 of technicality, technical papers and an

 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 Excuse me, may I interrupt just one second.
 Either one of than two statements is wrong
 The Washington Evening Star of Oct. 31, 1959
 page 1, reported that Lee Harvey Oswald. a
 former kavine, of 4936 Collingwood St., Ft.
 Worth, Texas, had turned In his passport at
 the American Embassy in Moscow on that sae
 dote and It said that he had applied for
 Soviet citizenship.  Now, it seems to me
 that you 've renounced your American citizen
 ship it you've turned In your passport.
 LEE H. OSWALD"
 Well, the very obvious answer to that is
 that I a back in the United States.  A
 person who renounces his citizenship ba-
 comes disqualified for returning to the U.S.
 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 Right, and Soviet authorities - this I.
 from the We ahington Post & Times Herald
 of November 16, 1959 - Soviet authorities
 have refused to grant it although they had
 informed him he could live in Russia a^ ^
 Resident Alien.  What did you do in the 2
 weeks from Oct. 31st to NOv. 16th  1959?
 LEE H. OSWALD:

 Cuban-American problem, however, I a quite

 should get around to the organisation which
 he is the head of in New Orleans, the Fair

 As a practical matter Mc. Oswald, knowing as
 I'^ Sure you do the sentiment in America
 against Cube, we. of course, severed diplo-
 matic relations sometir ago, I would may
 thet Ceatco is as about as unpopular an any
 body in the world in this country.  As a
 practical matter, what do you hope to gain
 for your work?  How do you hope to bring
 about what you call "Fair Play for Cuba"?
 snowing that sentiment?
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 The principals of The Fair Play for Cubs
 consist of restoration of diplomatic trade
 and tourist relations with Cuba, that is one
 of our main points, or, we are for that, I
 disagree that this situation regarding Am-
 erican-Cuban relations is very unpopular, we
 are in a minority surely, or, we are not
 particularly interested in what Cuban exiles
 or rightists or, er, members of righter or-
 ganizations have to may, we are primarily
 Interested in the attitude of the U. S.
 government toward Cuba.  And in that way we
 are striving to get the United States to
 adopt measures which would be more friendly
 toward the Cuban people and the new Cuban
 regime in that country.  We are not at all
 commamist controlled. regardless of the
 fact that I have the experience of living
 in Russia, regardlea of the fact that we
 have been investigated, Cr, regardless of
 any of those facts, Cr, The Fair Play for
 Cuba Comlttes is an independent organiza-

 tion, our aims and our Ideals are very
 clear, and in the best keeping with Ameri-
 can traditions of democracy.

 ber 22, 1963, and the subsequent murder of
 Lee Harvey Oswald before a television audi-
 ence of millions.
 BILL SIATTER:
 Mr. Oswald, would you agree that when Castro
 first took power, er, would you agree that
 the United States was very friendly with
 Castro, that the people of this country had
 nothing but admiration for him, that, er,
 that they were very glad to see Batista
 thrown out?
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 I would say that the activities of the Uni-
 ted Ste tea government in regards to Batista
 were a manifestation of, not so much support
 for Fidel Castro, but rather a withdrawal
 of support from Batista, in other words, we
 stopped arms to Batista, what we should have
 done was to take those armaments, and drop
 them into the Sierra Maestra where Fidel
 Castro could have used them, as for public
 sentiment at that time, I think even at that
 even before the revolution there were rumb-
 lings of official comment and so forth from
 government officials, er, against Fidel
 Castro.
 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 You've never been to Cuba, of course, but
 why are the people in Cuba starving today?

 agriculture, or, you are going to have

 BILL SLATTER:
 Gentlemen, I'm going to have to interrupt,
 our time is almost up.  We've had three
 guests tonight on Conversation Carte
 Blanche: Bill Stuckey and I have been talk-
 ing to Lee Harvey Oswald, Secretary of the
 New Orleans Chapter of The Fair Play for
 Cuba Committee, Ed Butler, Executive Dir-
 ector of The Information Council. of the
 Americas (INCA), and Carlos Bringuier,
 Cuban refugee.  Thank you very much and
 good evening.
 MARSHALL PEARCE:
 The and of the interview foreshadowed a
 tragic series of events climaxed by the
 Now for an impression in depth of Os-
 wald , we turn to one of the panelists on
 that fateful evenine - Edward Butler, Execu-
 tive Vice-President of INCA.  Mr. Butler a
 specialist in communist propaganda activities
 and how to overcome them, has interviewed
 scores of refugees from communist takeovers
 during the past several years.  In 1960 he
 conceived, and now manages INCA, and its
 TRUTH TAPES program.  TRUTH TAPES are half-
 hour and fifteen minute tape recordings
 featuring eyewitness refugee testimony about
 communist takeover tactics, sent to a net-
 work of over 120 local radio stations in 16
 nations of Latin America.
 The author of several articles on
 this vital subject, Mr. Butler has appeared
 as a witness before the House Foreign Af-
 fairs Subcommittee on International Organi-
 zations and Movements to outline ways to win
 the war of words and avoid nuclear conflict.
 He was the only known propaganda specialist
 ever to confront Oswald. Mr. Butler ...
 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 While sketching the portrait of Oswald for
 the jacket of this record, I sorted through
 a mental inventory of scores of memories of
 Oswald, his expressions, statements, reac-
 tions, and gestures.
 Although our only confrontation was the
 evening of the debate, I knew a good deal
 about Oswald before the encounter.  I had
 listened for hours to a tong, tape-recorded
 interview with Oswald by Bill Stuckey; I had
 questioned Bringuier and other refugees who
 knew him; I had read the anti-American, pro-
 Castro propaganda Oswald was distributing
 on behalf of The Fair Play for Cuba Committee
 and of course, I had data about his defection
 to Russia.
 We finally met in the reception room at
 the WDSU studio; Bringuier introduced no.
 Oswald seemed outwardly self-confident, but
 his hand was clammy when I shook it.
 I sat down opposite him, about three
 feet away.
 Stuckey came in, and after a somewhat
 stiff 'hello' all around, he and I began
 to chat, while Oswald and Sringuier began
 to argue.
 When Oswald spoke, he sounded like a
 man with a piano roll in his. head, grind-
 ing out the same tired Red propaganda
 tunes that I have heard no often in my
 work.

 It was then that I happened to mention to
 Stuckey that a certain local businessman we
 "progressive" in his advertising policies.
 On the first syllable of the word 'progres-
 sive', Oswald abruptly broke off his discussion
 with Eringuiez and looked at me , slightly
 startled.  But by the time I had finished the
 sentence, Oswald rsalited that I we applying
 the term 'progressive' to capitalism. and his
 glance changed Into a smirk of utter disgust.
 To those of us who have to delve into the
 murky jargon of Marxism-Leninism. Oswald's re-
 action we, no surprise.  In the Red catechize.
 the term 'progressive' always indicated the
 'proletarian' forces led by the Party; to apply
 It to capitalism is blasphemy.
 I will never forget Oawld's loot of loath-
 ing.  I was to ace It several times mere during
 the vening, since everyone noticed that he ova
 particularly antagonistic towards me.  I tried
 to capture that black look on the jacket sketch.
 It had to be a look of impersonal hatred, since

 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 Oswald also used the familiar Big Lie techni-
 que, made famous by Goebbels, but originated
 by Lenin and perfected by his successors when
 he said:
 LEE H. OSWALD:
 "The Senate Subcommittees who have occupied
 themselves with investigating the Fair Play for
 Cuba Committde, have found that there is noth-
 ing to connect the two comoittee.."
 EDWARD S. BUTLER:
 To anyone who has read the detailed Congress
 ional Hearings on The Fair Play for Cuba Com-
 mittee, Oswald's distortion is obvious, and I
 urge every American to get these revealing docu-
 menta and decide for yourself.
 I suppose many mature Americans find it
 hard Co take seriously the Marxist theory of a
 world split into two warring classes, never
 changing except by revolution, never progree-
 sing except by hatred and conflict - but Oswald
 took it religiously.
 Similarly, many Americans can't conceive
 of anyone idolizing a brutal dictator like
 Castro, who has left a trail of blood, false-
 hood, and misery ever since he participated in
 his first political assassination, in Bogota,
 in 1948 - but Oswald certainly idolized him.
 What mystifies Americans most is how an
 American boy, could come to accept such a phil-
 osophy, and to worship such a man.  Oswald him-
 self gave us a vital clue when he said he was
 introduced to communism by a pamphlet sympathe-
 tic to the Rosenberg Atom Spies.  Later, read-
 ing Marx's "Das Capital" he said he felt,
 ..like a religious man opening the Bible for
 the first time."  The answer, of course, is
 that communist propaganda, in gradual doses,
 conditions the immature mind to glorify vio-
 lence.
 It teaches impersonal hatred of whole
 classes of humanity.  Many communist books,
 pamphlets, broadcasts or films are an open
 invitation to revolutionary terrorism.
 President Kennedy's death has proved that
 words - which can be shot around the world
 faster than any missile - words are the ulti-
 mate weapon.  What makes these new word
 weapons so powerful is that they can reach
 into the midst of any country, manipulate
 its own people, and invisibly motivate the
 minds of men who have the power to press
 buttons and pull triggers.  As a professional
 who handles word weapons every day, in my
 opinion the most frightening statement known
 to man is the bland phrase, "It's just propa-
 ganda!"
 ORDER NOW !
 EDWARD S. BUTLER, contd.
 Propaganda made Oswald the man he was.
 Communist propaganda inflamed the mind of the
 man, who - evidence indicates - pulled the
 trigger, to fire the bullet, that killed the
 President of the United States.
 For instance, I have in my hand a car-
 toon from an official Cuban publication called
 "Verde Olive" showing President Kennedy wear-
 ing a -Nazi Swastika armband, and giving dir-
 ections to a Cuban Refugee leader pictured as
 a worm.
 We know,.because Oswald admitted it open-
 ly, because he recited communist doctrine like
 scripture, and because people saw him in the
 act, that he had been steadily absorbing this
 mental poison for years.
 Until we counteract the vast bulk of hate
 propaganda which pours forth both from offici-
 al communist publications and their echoes here
 at home like The Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
 no elected official, no free institution, no
 private citizen's life, liberty or property
 will be safe.
 Communism can attract only the thinnest
 minority anywhere.  For every embittered Oswald
 in America, or Castro in Cuba, there are thou-
 sands of young men all over the world who can
 be trained to meet, compete with, and defeat
 them on the mass media battleground.
 What is needed are professionals -- or
 more accurately a practical means of subsidiz-
 ing the efforts of private propaganda profes-
 sionals for freedom.  I emphasize the word
 'private' because every Red revolutionary from
 Lenin, to Castro, to Oswald, has worked as a
 private citizen until after a successful revo-
 lution.  Here at the private level, using words
 as weapons, is where most major battles will
 be won or lost.
 And here is where nearly every American
 can help.  Only a few will have the inclina-
 tion, opportunity, and training to wage and
 win the war of words now going on.  But all
 can, and must, --- back the attack.
 In buying this "Oswald:Self-Portrait in
 Red" you have taken the first step, because
 revenue from this record is helping INCA to
 combat communism at the private level, profes-
 sionally, throughout the Americas.
 I for one, will never forget these liv-
 ing words, which no assassin's bullet can
 ever silence:
 PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:
 "And so my fellow Americans, ask not what
 your country can do for you; ask what you can
 do for your country."

 One of the principal values in such a recording lies In the fact that it serves
 as a vivid reminder to the American people and our National Government that
 there is a pressing need to provide greater protection for the President and
 Vice President and to maintain a more extensive alertness to the dangers from
 suspicious persons In our country.  On this score, as well at many others, Mr.
 Butler, Dr. Ochaner, the other officers and board members of INCA, have ren-
 dered great service to our country.
 Members of INCA today Include businessmen, professional men, educators, farm
 leaders, journalists, and others living In 21 States of our Nation.  They are
 providing solid support to INCA's "Truth Tapes" and its other efforts to counter
 communism In our hemisphere.  Leading representatives of both the govern-
 mental and the private sectors of our society are Included.  This is certainly
 true In my community of New Orleans and the surrounding area.
 At this point, Mr. Chairman, I would like to pay tribute to the late deLesseps
 S. (Chep) Morrison, long-time mayor of New Orleans and former United States          y
 Ambassador to the Organization of American States, for his dilligent efforts to
 assist Mr. Butler and INCA in its work. Chep Morrison, in his 151/2 years as
 mayor of New Orleans and his 2 years as OAS Ambassador, did a splendid job,
 through his contacts, his good will, and his knowledge, to help bring the peoples
 of all the Americas closer together and to solidify their governments against
 communism.  I am proud to have been an admirer and a close friend of
 Chep Morrison, whose life was cut off too soon.  I am pleased to salute him for
 his contributions to the cause of which we are concerned today.
 I know that Mr. Butler and his staff and the supporters of INCA are doing a
 fine job, but such organizations, with their somewhat limited resources, cannot
 do this work alone.  INCA and similar organizations, dedicated to strengthening
 and expanding freedom In our country and around the world, could use the as-
 sistance and direction of the National Government and the Congress to provide
 an extensive anti-Communist training program.  Such a program should re-
 ceive the full support of the Congress and the executive branch of our Gov-
 ernment.  It would in no way conflict with the great efforts in this field by the
 United States Information Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the
 State Department and others, but rather the Freedom Academy and the Freedom
 Commission would augment them, particularly by utilizing the vast resources
 and talents of our private citizens.
 Therefore, I say. Mr. Chairman. that now is the time to act and to act posi-
 tively.  A year ago, before this committee, I spoke on behalf of this legislation.
 I cited the immortal words of the late President Kennedy in his historic in-
 augural address :
 And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for
 you : Ask what you can do for your country.
 The Freedom Academy will give Americans In many walks of life the oppor-
 tunity to answer our late President's summons to service--to join In strengthen-
 ing our country and its freedom.  No one doubts the ultimate goals of the Soviet
 and Chinese Communists. We must use all of our human resources in order to
 counter effectively the Communist offensive and to refurbish democratic societies
 wherever we can.
 I would conclude, Mr. Chairman, by saying that the Freedom Academy will
 offer our Nation the best and most imaginative means to utilize the brains and
 talents of our people In a total effort against the Communist offensive and to
 foster the Ideals and the principles of freedom upon which this great country
 of ours was founded.
 Mr. Booas. There are many reasons for this bill. More recently,
 we have seen additional reasons. The evidence which has been docu-
 mented now about events in the Dominican Republic shows that there
 was a real subversive movement there; that it originated in Cuba,
 by and large, those people associated with the Cuban enterprises;
 and as this committee knows, there are. similar activities elsewhere
 in this hemisphere--particularly in the countries in Latin America,
 where there is lack of stability in the governments.
 (At this point Mr. Clawson entered the hearing room.)
 Mr. Boras, Last week, I had an interview with the Assistant Sec-
 retary of State in charge of Latin American Affairs, also in charge
 of our relations at. the Alliance for Progress, and he said that they
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For Re  gj  15fO I  plMAD
 estimated that Cuba was spending almost a billion dollars a year on
 activities having to do with the teaching of terror, subversion, the
 overthrow of democratic governments, and so on.
 Now, everybody knows that these funds are not coming from Cuba.
 Cuba is in a desperate economic plight. They are being supplied by
 the Communist organizations throughout the world, China, Soviet
 Russia, the satellite countries.
 The notion that this is not a threat to us is just not so. As I said,
 the Dominican Republic is the best example that I can think of.
 Now, we pride ourselves in the United States in being the most
 information-conscious nation on earth. We probably have more pages
 of news, more words of radio, and more pictures on television dealing
 with news, than any other country on earth; and yet somehow or an-
 other, we fail in the propaganda field, even in our own country.
 The President, right at the moment, is terribly concerned about
 events on some of our college campuses with respect to developments
 in Southeast Asia. On the other side of the spectrum, this commit-
 tee has taken note of the activities of the Ku Klux Klan, so that we
 have, in. many ways, failed to tell the story of this, the greatest, the
 freest nation that mankind has ever known.
 We have the people to do it in our institutions, both in and out of
 Government.
 I think that this idea of mobilizing the intellectual resources of
 our country for an offensive to tell the story of America and what
 it means is something that just should be done.
 Now, from all that I can ascertain in Southeast Asia, for instance, we
 have established a real rapport with the people of Southeast Asia and
 yet there has been the worst type of terrorism on the part o  the
 Viet Cong, and yet the Vice President of the United States was con-
 fronted yesterday with questions indicating that we-the United
 States is guilty of atrocities in Southeast Asia.
 So it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that there is a vast need for this.
 I don't believe that we can do all of this through Government enter-
 prise.  It may very well be that USIA is not being adequately fi-
 nanced.  I don't know.  But even if those appropriations were
 doubled or tripled, we still should utilize these vast potential resources
 in the universities and elsewhere that we are not utilizing.
 We have had a group operating in my hometown in New Orleans
 called INCA, which has done quite a remarkable 'ob, using existing
 radio stations and making tapes, movies for reproduction, answering
 propaganda lines, whether they come from the extreme left or the
 extreme right, on the scene, not letting this propaganda just prevail.
 And I am convinced that this group has had a very profound impact
 in Latin America.
 All of us know the impact that Radio Free Europe has had in East-
 ern Europe, so that the need for this, I think, has been very well estab-
 lished, and I believe that if this committee reported this bill, that the
 House would pass it, and I think the Senate would pass it, and I hope
 that that is done relatively soon.
 I ask unanimous consent to incorporate this statement in the
 record.
 The CHAIRMAN. That will be done at this point.

 (The formal statement submitted by Congressman Boggs follows:)
 STATEMENT OF HON. HALE BOGGS, U.B. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
 LOUISIANA
 Mr. Chairman, I am happy to be with you and the members of this distinguished
 committee for a few minutes today to talk with you about what I consider to be
 an Important piece of legislation. The establishment of a. proper training acad-
 emy-as envisaged in this legislation-would alert our own citizens in a con-
 crete way to the nefarious tactics of the agents of the international Communist
 conspiracy.  Such an academy would equip them in a firmer, more extensive
 manner to counter the paramilitary and propaganda techniques of the Communist
 orbit and, at the same time, provide constructive tactics to foster our own demo-
 cratic principles.
 The formation of this special academy-A Freedom Academy-would be a
 fine way to help achieve these goals--that is, by bringing together, both as
 teachers and students, the beat minds of our country from both the public and
 the private sectors of our society.
 We have only to look at the Communist attempt to subvert and take over
 the Dominican Republic to realize just how serious in our own hemisphere is
 this menace to all the established governments.  All types of agitation, espionage,
 subversion, and other paramilitary and propaganda techniques are utilized to
 achieve the success of any Communist revolt.
 In a recent discussion I had with Mr. Jack Vaughn, Assistant Secretary of
 State for Inter-American Affairs and our U.S. coordinator for the Alliance for
 Progress, Air. Vaughn cited an almost unbelievable sum of money which I had
 not heard before.  He told me that the international Communist conspiracy,
 through Cuba and Castro's regime, is now spending between $600 million and
 $800 million a year to maintain the Cuban Government and to train Communist
 agents and to export revolution throughout Latin America.  This is truly a
 frightening sum, particularly when we know what it is being used for.  As
 Mr. Vaughn pointed out, this financial output equals the approximate total funds
 which our country provides for Latin America annually through the Alliance
 for Progress program and related social assistance programs.
 If there was any shred of doubt about the Communists' intentions in our
 hemisphere, it was obliterated last November in Havana when the Castro regime
 signed a charter, in which Its leaders agreed to do everything in their power to
 subvert the existing governments in Latin America, to foment their so-called
 wars of national liberation, and to seize control of all the other governments in
 the Western Hemisphere.  Mr. Vaughn stated that. our Government knows that
 Castro and his agents have a priority list of Latin nations for future subversion
 and overthrow and that we are aware of which countries are at the top of the
 list.
 The Communists obviously are doing an extensive job of propaganda and sub-
 version in Latin America.                                      In Cuba, there Is a real and total slave economy-
 and yet the Castro regime seems to be able to train agents and to export propa-
 ganda and revolution.  This Communist regime seems to enjoy some success in
 convincing the poor people of Latin America that Castro and his government
 are helping the ordinary man, the workingman, to achieve a better life.
 I asked Mr. Vaughn why the United States apparently has been less successful
 than we should be in fostering information on our own Government, our prin-
 ciples, and our way of life in a free society, and the virtues and accomplish-
 ments of our Alliance for Progress program.
 Among other things, he said- that in his opinion one of the reasons for this is
 that our country does not provide enough money to the United States Information
 Agency so that it can do the most effective fob in this area.  He said that the
 USIA has been allotted less money over the years than have similar agencies of
 our Government. Mr. Vaughn noted that more funds were needed for this impor-
 tant Agency, and I agree with this.
 As I stated in my earlier prepared remarks for your committee, the Freedom
 Academy in no way would circumvent, or compete with, the USIA, the CIA, the
 National Security Agency, the State Department, or other similar agencies of our
 Government.  On the contrary, the Freedom Academy-by utilizing the best
 brains not only from the public governmental sector of our society, but also
 from the private Hector, would augment and supplement in a fine manner the
 good work which these other agencies are continually doing for our country.
 The skills which could be provided to our citizens in such an academy must be
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For FW~Q0 q7/AlliQ   DRR    M   R000600Q$g001-8
 taught by knowledgeable and trained professionals.  Such skills and knowledge
 can best be offered in a special school, as envisaged in this legislation.
 I know that there is a great, untapped source of imagination, patriotism, and
 dedication from among our private citizens, many of whom would gladly take
 this specialized training in nonmilitary and propaganda techniques in order to
 do their part to maintain our freedom and that of the other nations of the world.
 The fact is that we do not now have, even for the special training of our Gov-
 ernment personnel, an agency of our National Government assigned to the task of
 providing an extensive course in nonmilitary and propaganda tactics.  The Free-
 dom Academy, directed by a high-level Freedom Commission, would give our
 country and its citizens the right kind of specialized school for this purpose.
 In my own city of New Orleans, Louisiana, there is in active operation, a
 private citizens' organization, the Information Council of the Americas, directed
 by Mr. Edward S. Butler III, as executive vice president, and Dr. Alton Ochsner,
 an internationally famous surgeon from my city, as president. This organization,
 known as INCA, is performing an outstanding service to the people of Latin
 America, as well as to our own country; by fostering the significance of freedom
 and countering Communist propaganda and subversion. INCA is achieving this
 by sending to some 136 radio stations in 16 different Latin nations "Truth
 Tapes"-which feature the voices of Cuban refugees relating their own stories of
 oppression and terror, of poverty and the generally debased condition of their
 country, under Castro's Communist regime.
 In the United States, there are also some 426 radio stations which are coop-
 erating with INCA to promote interest and to solicit support for this patriotic
 work.  These radio stations in 43 of our 50 States also are broadcasting some
 of these "Truth Tapes," thus giving their audiences an insight and an understand-
 ing into political and social developments in Latin America and the Communist
 activities to subvert and overthrow the governments of our good neighbors
 to the south.
 In INCA's membership today are businessmen, professional men, educators,
 farm leaders, journalists, and others living in 21 different States of our Union.
 They are giving their support to INCA and its important work-they are private
 citizens who are assisting in fighting communism in our hemisphere. This fine
 organization is just one example, a very sound example, of what a group of
 private citizens can do to assist our National Government and our people in com-
 bating communism.  But INCA and similar organizations cannot do this work
 alone, because the task is too big for a select group of our citizens.  It requires a
 total commitment by our Government and a majority of its citizens to counter the
 spread of communism around the world.  I submit, Mr. Chairman, that the estab~
 lishment of this specialized Freedom Academy would be a concrete way in which
 to engender a greater response to this total commitment.
 Therefore, I am pleased to Join with many of my colleagues on both sides of the
 aisle and in both Houses in sponsoring this legislation. It is enjoying increasing
 bipartisan support in both Houses of the Congress. As the committee knows, the
 Senate passed a similar bill in the 2d session of the 86th Congress, but the House
 did not have the opportunity to act upon it then.  I am most hopeful that the
 89th Congress will have this opportunity and that the House will pass this legisla-
 tion to strengthen our country and the principles for which it stands.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, for permitting me to
 speak to you today.
 The CHAIRMAN. Now, Congressman Boggs, I wish to say this. The
 May 1, 1965, issue of New Times was brought to my attention just the
 other day. This is a Soviet weekly journal of world affairs which
 is published not only in Russian, but six other languages-English,
 French, German, Spanish, Polish, and Czech. This propaganda maga-
 zine is put out by Trud, the U.S.S.R. so-called labor newspaper, pub-
 lished by the All-Union Central Soviet of Professional Unions in
 Moscow.
 On page 23 of the May 1 issue, which is the beginning of the section
 on "International Notes," there is a subhead "U.S.A." and under that
 another subhead "Academy of the Science of Subversion."
 The item opens with mention of the fact that Senator Mundt had
 recently made a long speech in the Senate on the Freedom Academy
 and states that a bill providing for its establishment has already been
 subm tte to the Congress.
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Appved For NqM~qWOX/14
 Actually, of course, eight bills to establish a Freedom Academy-
 and you are the author of one of them-have been introduced in the
 House and one in the Senate, with 12 s )onsors.1 Senator Mundt has
 long been a sponsor of the Freedom Academy concept and testified
 before this committee on the bills now pending before it just a few
 weeks ago, on April 1.
 The article then goes on to claim that, in speaking about the Free-
 dom Academy in March of last year, you, Ir. Boggs, declared that
 the prototype of its activity should be ` the work done by our security
 agencies, the FBI particularly on the domestic scene, the CIA else-
 where in the world.'
 "In short," the article continues-
 it was a question of setting up an institution in which American diplomats,
 correspondents, businessmen, tourists and sportsmen going abroad would be
 trained in the art not only of anti-communism but also of subversion.
 It next states, truthfully, that Senator Mundt has urged that en-
 rollment in the Freedom Academy should not be limited to American
 citizens, but that it be an international school and quotes him to this
 effect. The article concludes with the following words:
 Wouldn't it be better to rename the Freedom Academy the Academy of the
 Science of Subversion?
 This item is a wholesale lie, typical of the kind of "news" published
 in Soviet organs.  It indicates, I believe, that. the Communists are
 concerned about, and fearful of, the Freedom Academy and are al-
 ready beginning their attempt. to discredit it.
 Mr, Boggs, the committee staff has checked into this quotation at-
 tributed to you, which allegedly spells out the function of the Free-
 dom Academy. To clarify the record and to refute this Communist
 falsehood, I would like to state for the record what the staff learned.
 First., you made no such statement in March of last year. Second
 you did speak the exact words attributed to you on February 19 of
 east year, when you appeared before this committee to testify on your
 Freedom Academy bill and others then before it.. Moscow, however,
 has twisted your words completely out of context.
 What actually happened was that, in prefatory remarks you made
 before submitting your formal statement on the Freedom Academy
 for the record, you mentioned, among other things, that you believe
 one of the reasons the Peace Corps has been so successful was because
 it has demonstrated the basic idealism of Americans. You added that
 the Freedom Academy would provide an opportunity for us to chan-
 nel the idealism and dedication "that are innate in our society to
 fighting the greatest threat. thatmankind has ever faced."
 Now we come to the important point. You continued-and I quote
 your exact wards
 Now, in saying this, I do not want to derogate anyone.  I think that the work
 done by our security agencies, the FBI particularly, on the domestic scene, the
 CIA elsewhere in the world, is by and large the highest type of activity on
 earth.  But what is proposed here is something else. This is not intelligence
 work.   It is not checking on subversives-all of which is vital and important
 to the security of this country and the security of free men everywhere.  This
 is the use affirmatively of the great reservoir of talent that we have in the
 United States to show what the tree system and what a free society can do. <

 Those were your full words.
 I do not think you could have made a clearer and more explicit
 statement to the effect that the Freedom Academy was not in any way
 to do the work of, or to be patterned after, the FBI or the CIA.
 You stressed the fact that just the opposite was true.  Yet, the
 Kremlin has seen fit-and this, of course, is one of its typical per-
 formances-to lift your words completely out of context and at-
 tribute to you a meaning that is in 100 percent opposition to your
 true position.
 As I said before, this Soviet use of the big-lie technique on this
 matter indicates that Moscow appreciates the significance of the bills
 now before this committee. It realizes the potential effect of a Free-
 dom Academy on the long-term outcome of the cold war. It doesn't
 want a Freedom Academy established in this country. And so, be-
 cause the truth cannot be used to discredit the Academy concept, it
 uses falsehood in an attempt to do so. This, perhaps, will assist the
 Congress and this committee in determining how they will vote on the
 bills we are now considering.
 In other words, they just use your testimony in a 180-degree oppo-
 sition to what you did say before this committee. I now insert this
 article mentioned in the statement at this point in the record.

 Mr. Boons. Mr. Chairman, as I understand what you are reading,
 apparently that article had said that I advocated the establishment
 of an academy of subversionI
 The CUAmMAN. Yes, and that we wanted a broad, worldwide FBI-
 CIA agency.
 Mr. Boons. Meaning, of course, that anything that is contradictory
 to Communist propaganda is subversion, and that is exactly what the
 meaning of that is : that any effort that we make to counteract their
 propaganda is not the use of the weapon that we seek to use, namely,
 the truth, but what they call subversion.
 In a sense we do "subvert" communism, because it is hard to make
 a system, which basically is one of slavery, into one of freedom.  So
 when you tell our story, the truth, it becomes a very devastating thing
 for the Communists.
 When you compare the freedom of an American with the lack of
 freedom of a Soviet citizen or a Chinese citizen or any of the satellite
 people, the comparison is so tremendous that it is one that they don't
 like to hear. It is like the case of the Berlin wall.  I know all of you
 have looked at that wall. That wall is erected, reall , to keep the East
 Berliners in not to keep anybody out, because if they can get out of
 there and taste a look at what the rest of Berlin is like, they don't need
 any further testimony about freedom.  It has been my observation,
 Mr. Chairman over the years that I have been here, that the best way
 to test the effectiveness of a proposal is to see what the Soviet
 reaction is.
 Now if they didn't think this was an effective idea, they wouldn't
 be so concerned about it.
 I was in Berlin at the time of the airlift, flew in there on a plane
 loaded with coal.  The efforts made by the Soviets to discredit the
 airlift and to discredit the Marshall plan, which was just then being
 talked about, were something fantastic.  And I came away convinced
 that they were more afraid of the fact that we were staying in Europe
 and that we were prepared to work with the forces of genuine democ-
 racy than anything that had happened recently.  So my reaction to
 that article is that they are really concerned about the Freedom
 Academy.
 They know that. if we really mobilize, as I said in my original state-
 ment, the talent, the latent talent that we have in this country, just
 to answer their obvious lies about the United States, that they are in
 serious trouble.
 And the lies that are told by the millions about this country are
 fantastic to anyone who has traveled around and listened or read some
 of the propaganda.  I remember going into a barbershop in New
 Delhi, in India, and you know how you do in a barbershop.  You
 reach around and get something to read while you are waiting for
 the fellow to cut your hair, so I picked up a very smart-looking maga-
 zine that looked something like. LIFE or L068 and was very beau-
 tifully illustrated. Well, it turnedout to be a Communist Party organ,
 published in Czechoslovakia., beautifully illustrated and the whole
 theme of it was "the great leap forward." As they described it, the
 told all that they were supposedly doing for children and people and
 families and health and welfare and sanitation, and so on, and I be-

 came curious about this, so I went to our people at the Embassy and
 at the information offices, and they pulled out just reams and reams
 and reams of these publications from the Soviet Union, China, and
 the satellites, including North Korea and North Vietnam.
 So these people well understand what is proposed in this idea,
 because what they call subversion is what I call the truth, and in
 this case, truth directed against what they are doing really is subvert-
 ing them. There is no question about that.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much; we appreciate your taking
 time out to appear before us.
 We have with us Dr. William B. Walsh. Dr. Walsh is the founder
 and president of the Project HOPE, which, since 1960, has operated a
 hospital ship, SS HOPE. Project HOPE has served three continents
 and in 4 years has trained more than 2,500 physicians and other
 medical personnel and treated more than 100,000 persons. The ship
 has voyaged to Indonesia, South Vietnam, Peru, Ecuador, the Re-
 public of Ghana.
 Dr. Walsh, we are not only privileged but honored to have you and
 we are greatly indebted to you.
 If you will, give us your views, not in technical terms, about the
 possibility of having a central place where we can do research, some
 training, on how to handle this cold war which has been with us and is
 likel to be with us for a long time to come.
 We are delighted to have you and look forward to hearing your
 views.
 STATEMENT OF WILLIAM B. WALSH
 Dr. WALSH. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee : First
 let me apologize to you for not having a prepared statement, but I have
 been in Latin America and in Africa over the bulk of the last 2 months
 and, in the past month, have actually been in Washington only 3 days,
 so we have not had time to prepare a statement for you.
 The CHAIRMAN. Before you proceed, I overlooked that I have before
 me more detailed background material concerning your education and
 the many honors that have been conferred upon you and the high
 esteem that you have in this and other lands.
 I will make this document a part of the record at this point.

 Dr. William B. Walsh was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., on April 26, 1920.  After
 graduating from Brooklyn Preparatory School he attended Sty John's University
 in New York, where he won the Hamilton Scholarship, majored in biology and
 received his B.S. Degree in 1940.
 In 1948 Dr. Walsh received his M.D. from the Georgetown University School of
 Medicine, Washington, D. C., fulfilling his post-graduate training as an
 intern at Long Island College Hospital and Georgetown University Hospital.
 Dr. Walsh's medical education was interrupted in 1943 by World War II.
 He served as a medical officer aboard a destroyer in the South Pacific
 until his discharge in 1946.  The squalor and poor hospital conditions of
 the area began the young doctor's dream of returning with a floating
 medical school.
 When, in 1958, President Eisenhower asked Dr. Walsh to co-chair the Committee
 on Medicine and the Health Professions of the President's new People-to-People
 Program, Dr. Walsh suggested that a Navy hospital ship be taken out of moth-
 balls and converted into a floating medical center.
 After he won approval of the idea, Dr. Walsh decided that it's success hinged
 on support from private American citizens, and he founded The People-to-People
 Health Foundation, Inc., the parent organization of Project HOPE, which
 sponsors the world-wide voyages of the S.S. HOPE.
 At the time, Dr. Walsh was a noted internist and heart specialist, an
 assistant professor of internal medicine at Georgetown University, and
 an internal medicine resident at the school's noapLtai.  Since then, he has
 given un his private practice to devote full time to his duties as medical
 director and president of. Project HOPE.
 Dr. Walsh lives with his wife Helen at 5101 Westpath Way in Washington
 with their three sons, William Jr., John end Thomas.
 Dr. Walsh is the author of A Ship Called HOPE, an account of the S.S. HOPE's
 maiden voyage to Asia and is writing a second book on the ship's trips to
 Peru and Ecuador.  A third book on ROPE in Africa will follow.

 Dr. WALSH. And I would like to make a second apology because,
 since my second bout with malaria, I have some eighth nerve deafness
 which I have not as yet corrected or obtained a hearing aid for, so if you
 have any questions, I would appreciate it if you would raise your voice
 just a little bit.
 The CHAIRMAN. You have been so busy treating others that you
 have forgotten yourself.
 Dr. WALSH. Yes; that is correct.
 In speaking to this point I, of course, would not presume upon the
 wisdom of this committee to tell you what form the Freedom Academy
 should take, but rather to tell you that I agree 100 percent that some-
 thing is very seriously needed..
 As you were pointing out, our experience has borne out your con-
 clusion that in this era of so-called cold war or coexistence, which
 means to me a continuing war without the use of thermonuclear weap-
 ons, the Soviet has not forgotten for a moment what its prime objec-
 tive is.  In virtually every walk of life to which we have been exposed
 on three continents, we have found that the Soviets are interested in
 everything that we do, in everything that the United States does, and
 they pay attention to details because they have been instructed to pay
 attention to details.
 In Indonesia, for example, they didn't feel that we had any oppor-
 tunity of success initially.  But they soon found that the response of
 people to a gesture such as the HOPE was something they had not bar-
 gained for. So, shortly after we arrived2 the Soviet had a team of 10
 follow us through three different ports in Indonesia, sometimes pre-
 ceding us, and attempting to frighten the people away from coming to
 the ship.
 They distributed pamphlets; they described to the local people in
 Indonesia that the cameras which the physicians and nurses carried
 were for purposes of pornographic photography; that we were there
 to rape their women, not to treat them; that we were not really there
 to teach these people to help themselves, but primarily there for some
 nefarious political purpose, which was to lead to the overthrow of the
 Sukarno government.
 Our purpose was really to teach and to train, and the fringe benefit
 of this purpose is naturally to give a different aspect of the United
 States.
 This type of performance by the Soviet is repeated in legion through-
 out the countries in which we have been.  They will attempt to infil-
 trate through local trainees.  They even attempt to infiltrate our ranks
 here in the United States.  They do all that they can to release rumors,
 to release things to the press which will upset public confidence in our
 project which depends, of course, in large part, upon public support
 for its continuation.
 Now mind you, while this is the most important thing, perhaps, in
 my life, it is really a very small thing in the so-called cold war or
 battle for men's minds, but yet it is not so small as to have the Soviet
 overlook it.  Even as recently as 2 months ago, we had two volunteers,
 physicians from among the 3,000 who volunteer every year, from one
 of the Western States; both of whom, I think, had een before your
 committee.

 Had we not utilized the precaution that we always use of investi-
 gating all our volunteers before they are taken, we may well have been
 unaware that these people were actively engaged in activities against
 the United States.
 Midway through our own investigation, we were coincidentally ad-
 vised by. the FBI that. they would like to know the itinerary of these
 people, because they were highly active and dangerous, and they would
 like to be sure that they were followed, if we were to let them out of
 the country.
 In this instance, since the FBI did not insist. upon our letting them
 go, we, needless to say, did not let them go, because they are in too
 good a position to sabotage our program abroad.
 This was, I would say, about the 15th and 16th attempts at infiltra-
 tion of an effort even as small as ours, because it has a significant
 impact, abroad, by known Communists in this country  To our knowl-
 edge, no physician, nurse, or technician who has been identified or
 known to be subversive has ever been on board, but this has not
 stopped them from trying.
 V can't s peak for the crews, because they are checked by the Coast
 Guard, but I do know that, on a few occasions, we have been alerted in
 regard to certain crewmembers who have been passed by the Coast
 Guard, but who have records, apparently, of past Marxist interest.
 In working abroad, we found, for example, particularly in Vietnam,
 and I am not reticent to say so, a strange communion of policy be-
 tween the Viet Cong and the French. The French virtually black-
 balled our every activity by totally ignoring our presence, despite the
 fact that they exercised heavy influence in the medical school of that
 country.
 ?%Ve reported this, of course, to the Ambassador, and the Ambassador
 was conscious of it, but as you well know, there is very little that he
 was able to do about it.
 I have no doubt that this is continuing, because we have maintained
 a hospital in Saigon, a teaching center, since 1961, and our physicians
 who have been stationed there have reported to us constantly of this
 type of activity.
 If I can digress for just. a moment, I was not certain on reading
 your bill, about the extent of people to attend whatever institution you
 initiate, or whatever type of training you initiate, but I would hope
 that it would be not Qnly open to Government officials, but open also to
 representatives of major businesses that go abroad.
 Frequently, our foreign correspondents-who I do not say for one
 moment. are un-American, believe me, but many of them are young
 and many of them are extremely gullible to propaganda-many of
 them go out among the people and, unfortunately, are cornered once
 again by the trained Communist, who they do not even know is a
 Communist, but who gradually is able to make an impression upon
 them.
 I think you have seen this.  Certainly in the reports from Vietnam,
 which reached such a peak and may have influenced our foreign policy,
 you may remember even President Kennedy was reported to have re-
 quested the removal of one correspondent from the country.
 As late as this morning's paper, you saw the frustration of the
 USIA spokesman speaking on the Dominican Republic, who stated

 that he wished the reporter who was writing for one well-known
 paper would talk to someone besides the rebels before he criticized his
 cwn Government so vigorously in the press.
 I do not feel that this would in any way be intervention in the free,
 dom of the press.  I feel simply that they, too, are not so profound
 that they can't tolerate education along with the rest of us. We see
 now what is happening to the colleges throughout the country, in these
 so-called teach-ins, which to me, as an American, is almost unbe-
 lievable.
 We see at the University of Oregon a man leading a teach-in who
 has been fired as a result of his wife's active activity at another univer-
 sity, where she was quoted as having stated that if we came into a war
 with Cuba, she hoped we would lose, so that we would be taught a
 lesson. And yet this man is given sufficient respect to lead a teach-in
 at the University of Oregon, at which representatives of our Govern-
 ment have to come and explain our ]policy.
 I think this is a very strange position for us to find ourselves in, and
 I think that, somewhere along the line, whatever you have must also
 be broadened to get some of our educators in the Academy courses, or
 some of our own faculty members in the universities, so that the stu-
 dents will be exposed to both sides of any story.
 The CHAIRMAN. Let me tell you that if the Academy becomes an
 actuality, the students, the attendance of this center, will cut across all
 segments of our society : labor, management, Government, foreign stu-
 dents, educational fields.
 In fact, I would hope that sonne of the staff of the Governors and
 Members of Congress will take time to go, because the courses are
 going to vary.
 We can get 2 months, 3 months, 2 years.  It will cut across our
 whole society, both domestic and foreign attendants, or students, but
 of course the students are intended to be from the adult population.
 So it is not restrictive.  It is as broad as you can imagine.
 Dr. WALSH. This will be, to me, an essential aspect of your effort,
 because too often we have the tendency to only blame our Govern-
 ment or our Government representatives when frequently it goes
 much further than this abroad.
 In Latin America, too, I think we have been very derelict in
 whatever type of indoctrination we give our citizens, because we have
 permitted the Communists to merchandise and to virtually possess
 the word "change."  Change is neither a word that belongs to-and
 I hate to use labels-but it is not a word that belongs to the liberals
 or the conservatives or the progressives.  Change is progress, but yet
 in Latin America in particular, the Communists have merchandised
 the word "change," so that even when loyal Americans try to support
 something which is a change for the better, the citizens many times
 think, "Well, you must be a Communist, because you are trying to
 get us a change from what we are now experiencing."
 Yet they are very aware of the impact of any American who goes
 into these cities and into these villages, who can bring about change.
 When we first went to Peru, the Communist students littered the
 streets in Trujillo with "Yankee go home" signs. This was a town
 of about 100,000 people.  They came to me in the street and told me
 that if we went into the barriadas with our program where, of course,

 A Moved Fop             /,17i*agQi#-          446R000600070001-8
 they were fomenting communism through mise  and disease, that
 they would create violence and that people would be hurt and prob-
 ablyy killed.
 Iare not responsive to this kind of threat, because we found
 that even when we were in Vietnam and went down into the delta that
 the Viet Cong did not bother medical teams.  I think that our own
 State Department can tell you that now that they have put medical
 teams throughout the villages, that no matter what happens you will
 rarely read-and I don't. think you have read-of a single member
 of any medical team in any village in the delta or in the north being
 touched by the Viet Cong.
 When we went down into the delta, back in 1961-62, they would
 leave, in fact, their own wounded outside of a compound or outside
 of a hospital at which we were working. They would leave them
 there during the night, because they had no medical care of their own,
 and I feel that this is just one area where we can reach people through
 the field of medicine, and the same thing was true in the barriadas
 abroad.
 In South America, within a week after we were there the Com-
 munist students could do nothing about keeping us out.  They had to
 let us in. We taught the people a little something about. free enter-
 prise; we taught them to dig a well and sell water so they could buy
 their own medicine, which they have done. And actually, the people of
 Trujillo soon found that employed residents of the barriadas are no
 longer Communists, but are almost a little bit on the capitalistic side.
 This doesn't mean that these people are now members of the center
 or perhaps just left. of center but eventually they may be members ol
 the center.
 The same thing is true in Africa. I can speak primarily of West
 Africa, which I know fairly well= but there, once again, we are looked
 upon as are Europeans, with suspicion.
 Too often, the representatives of our Government apologize to the
 African, which is a very bad thing to do, because the African does not
 understand this type of treatment.
 The African is having troubles enough, without having seven repre-
 sentatives of SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee)
 sent to the Republic of Guinea so as to explain the civil rights problem
 in the United States.  The African that we see in the villages is not
 nearly so concerned with civil rights as he is with his own progress
 and survival.  At the top level we almost invite them to utilize this
 issue.  We fortunately see them at the top level, but we also see them
 in the villages.  There, they don't know what civil rights is.
 Now this doesn't mean that civil rights is not a problem which this
 country must overcome, and it doesn't mean that. civil rights has not
 been a long time coming, but we too often, particularly in Africa, ad-
 vertise our deficiencies and are reticent about the things of which we
 should be proud. And I would hole that even this, this type of thing,
 is going to be included in the curriculum-not only the evils of com-
 munism, but some of the, positive aspects of freedom, and the simple
 psychology that would relieve us of almost a national masochism
 abroad which affects us so that we seem to have to tell everyone of
 our deficiencies.

 There is nothing more irritating, because these people then use this
 to blackjack us into types of help we would not give them by saying,
 "If you don't do this, it will prove you are really against. the Negro,"
 a statement with which no sane person in this country will agree.
 The feeling of the necessity to explain these things is inviting inter-
 ference into our own internal affairs by foreign governments, so that
 we even have civil rights spokesmen, and respected civil rights spokes-
 men, who now say that they are going to excite the African nations
 to the extent that the votes in the United Nations will have a bearing
 upon what we do in the United States in regard to civil rights.
 I personally don't think that this country has come to that. I am
 for civil rights and I believe in civil rights, but I believe it is also
 our internal problem, and is not one that should be constantly ex-
 plained by our ambassadors abroad.
 I can't believe that this is anything but individual policy on the
 part of some of them.  I can't believe that this is the wish of the
 Secretary of State, because he is a much wiser man, in my opinion,
 than this.
 But I think that in going into your Academy, I realize you have
 to first establish an Academy before you establish a curriculum, but
 I would not identify it as primarily just an anti-Communist academy,
 or academy that just teaches communism and what communism is
 and how we should combat it.  But I think it must also stress the posi-
 tive parts of freedom, the positive parts of democracy, and also the
 understanding of the peoples with whom we deal. It is high time
 that, if we are going to continue to spend money abroad-and I be-
 lieve we are going to have to, and we should-that we should not sell
 ourselves down the river at the same time by advertising that we are
 a land of plenty, but actually a land of much moral deficiency.
 Now I will be happy to answer your questions.
 The CHAIRMAN. Well, Dr. Walsh, I think you have answered about
 everything, particularly in the last few minutes, that I was going to ask
 you. And I think you have covered it, but I will ask you specifically
 if your experiences did not indicate that some of the U.S. officials
 or representatives abroad, both Government and private, sometimes
 because of ignorance of communism and its methods, make mistakes
 which aid the Communists and hurt the United States cold war effort?
 Dr. WALSH. Absolutely.
 The CHAIRMAN. I think you covered it, but I wanted to ask you.
 Dr. WALSH. I would like to go off the record.
 The CHAIRMAN. Well, now, you want to go off the record?
 Dr. WALSH. Just for this one statement.
 The CHAIRMAN. Well, I will accord you that right.
 (Discussion off the record.)
 The CHAIRMAN. Now let's go on the record.
 Dr. WALSH. This individual I referred to off the record was not
 a Communist. He sincerely believed he was doing the right thing.
 He wanted reforms to come overnight, and actually, he, without real-
 izing it, was influencing a revolution, so much so that many of the
 American businesses in that country actually took full-page ads in
 the paper, saying that they did not agree with his position.  Now
 this, to me, is either a lack of education and understanding on the
 part, say, of the individual, or a lack of understanding on the part

 A oved Forp     t2  5/Q7~%i   -      &   46R000600070001-8
 of the businessmen. I don't care which it was. It was lack of under-
 standing on somebody's part and embarrassing to the United States.
 The URAIAMAN. And you think that a center, academy, where the
 true, solid evidence of Communist. tactics, methods, and so on and
 how to combat them would be taught, would help in that regard I
 Dr. WArsn. Yes, I think he would have been helped appreciably.
 Somewhere along the line, all of us who are in work abroad have to
 find a place where we can be educated to be able to tell, on the fine
 points, who is what and what he is doing, and when is a Communist
 not a Communist..  Just the fact that he makes a public declara-
 tion that. he isn't, is not sufficient.
 The C111AIRMAN. I might add that your reference or your expres-
 sion of hope that the course will include discussions of a positive as
 well as the negative will be included. I have said this many times,
 but just since you have brought it. up, we have heard a lot of evi-
 dence---the record is full of it where people in the educational field
 can't seem to lay their hands on completely reliable material that can
 be imparted in schools and universities.
 Specifically, some States, my own, have passed legislation requiring
 a course of Americanism versus Communism, and the teachers throw
 up their arms and say, "Well, what does that mean?  What do I
 teach?"
 Well, the material is not there in a concise, reliable way, and I have
 written to many of them.  I said in effect, "I like the old Lucky Strike
 cigarette ad.  'Compare.. Comparison proves."'  It is enough for
 these students, or even in colleges, to compare our school system as
 against the Communist school system, our system of free election
 against the nonexistence of election; our system of religion against
 their irreligious system, so that you are teaching the affirmative, and
 you are at the same time teaching the lack of those things in other
 areas, and that, of course, will be considered, I know, and the staff of
 this center will be of the highest.
 They must not be of extreme right or extreme left, or anything of
 the sort, about developing our own system here and putting those
 things on the record.
 Any questions I
 Mr. PooL. No.
 Mr. Iciioim. I would like to go off the record.
 (Discussion off the record.)
 Mr. Icuom). Going back on the record, I was very interested in
 your testimony concerning our publicity activities abroad which
 fairly well parallels the testimony given by Mr. Meyerhof of the
 1lfeyerhoff advertising agency.  His idea was that we had the policy
 of reporting all of the things that go on in America, and he said, un-
 fort.unately, only the bad news is newsworthy and that we, by this
 policy, are given  people abroad a bad concept of what America is.
 Dr. Wmsrr. There is no question about it.  We see this not only
 in our own experience, but in many others.  Good works are not con-
 sidered newsworthy.  If we were sued for malpractice by some
 African chieftain it would be on the front page, but, unfortunately,
 the competition in the sales of newspapers and magazines and so on is
 such that an article is much more readily printed in a. magazine that

 Approved For Rq%B
 gnin95 o /1A3 p,&1&-WPAMR    0006000f
 will call the President a dunderhead than one which says he is doing
 the right thing.
 And I believe that this is something in our times with which we
 really must cope, because the fact that the President felt forced to
 sanction this long debate this coming weekend, with his advisers, on
 the television and radio, while it is not my position to criticize or
 commend him for it, the fact that he has been put in that position,
 to me, is almost unbelievable.  I can't see how the Communists can
 do anything but gain by giving public exposure to those people who
 are going to condemn the United States. And I see another television
 program has Colonel Caamano on from the Dominican Republic, who
 threatens to kill more marines every day, and when he kills the marine,
 it is always because the marine has made a wrong turn-nothing about
 the fact that they should perhaps use restraint and that a three-man
 patrol in a jeep is really not violating a truce and is no real threat to
 the rebel holdings in Santo Domingo.
 Mr. Ici-roan. Along that line, Doctor, I have here a publication of
 USIA, Ameryka, which is a publication published in Poland by USIA,
 which Mr. Meyerhoff handed to the committee. This is an October 1964
 issue, and it, I suppose-I can't read Polish-however, I have taken it
 to one of our Polish Members, a Member of the Congress of Polish
 descent, who could read Polish, and he was very critical of the issue.
 It shows picture after picture, photograph after photograph, of
 racial riots and unrest in the United States, one in actual physical
 combat.  You seem to be concerned about this.  He was concerned
 about it. Of course, I know what USIA intends to do here.
 They are trying to show the Polish people that in this country we
 do have freedom of assembly. I would like for you to elaborate.
 Mr. Warw. Well, I understand also the motivation of USIA in
 printing such a thing. They feel that it is better that it come from us
 instead of a distorted version from them. I think that the only error
 that I would feel in this policy is that surprisingly, at least in the
 countries in which we have been, they really are not that interested in
 what is going on, because most of them have so many troubles of their
 own. I think that inadvertently, and with sincere motivation, we put
 a weapon actually in their hands, because they then blow this up, not
 as the isolated instance, because, remember, when a magazine like this,
 say, hits Africa, where over 90 percent of the people can't read, what
 makes you think that the political leaders don't change the wording
 under the pictures? Because all they can show are the pictures, and
 they show the pictures in their movie houses, and so on, and they show
 them around.
 Now, once again, I am sure that the magazine has 90 percent positive
 things about the United States, and I don't feel that we should ape the
 Soviet by any means, but some of the most magnificent publications
 I have ever seen in North Africa, in West Africa, and in Asia are the
 Chinese publications which would make you think it was a land of
 complete and utter paradise.
 Now we know this isn't true, but the ignorant African doesn't know
 it, and the other ignorant Asian isn't too sure of it, and this is what
 he looks at. And I feel that here rather than the question of motiva-
 tion is the question of understanding of what this whole business of
 cold war and coexistence is about, is something that has to be reexam-

 P3oved ForpftlM"    5/917fl&gLgLA-   Bf74W46R000600070001-8
 fined to the extent that it is possible that these agencies may then want
 to give reconsideration to this policy.
 Now, USIA, for example, has been very good in regard to Project
 HOPE. They made movie films and everything else, and they spread
 them all over South America and received a very, very good reaction,
 but if in that same movie clip, there was a race riot, you can bet your
 boots they would remember the race riots rather than the HOPE shot,
 in Latin America.
 Mr. Icnioiw. In any event, this is the type of thing which needs to
 be studied by an institution such as the F eredom Academy, whether
 this ppolicy is right or wrong, and perhaps we can see whether we
 should2 for example, have, as suggested by this Member of Congress
 of Polish descent., a human-interest story of a Congressman whose
 parents came from Poland, showing his activities in the Congress of
 the United States and how he was elected by his constituents to be a
 part of his Government. That was what he suggested would be much
 better material.
 Dr. WALSH. Well, I don't think we should do ourselves damage un-
 der the guise of intellectual honesty, because after all, this is a politi-
 cal organ.  It is an American political organ, and why should we
 pretend it is anything else?
 Mr. Icirosn. That is correct. I am sure that this was published
 in absolute good faith. However, I do question the effect, the desirable
 effect of the publication.
 Thank you very much, Doctor.  I would like to ask one more ques-
 tion. How many doctors do you have on the SS HOPE?
 Dr. War,sa. Well, between doctors and nurses, and so on, we carry
 110at a. time, 110 teachers at a time,  Somewhere between 30 and 35
 are physicians. They come from 43 States and they are all volun-
 teers.  We don't pay them a nickel. They all work for nothing.
 They spend at least 2 months of their time, and we have already used
 in 4 years, now 41/2 years, 621 doctors, who have been selected from
 actually about 3,000 applications a year, and they come from all over,
 and so we really get the cream.  Their average age is about 45.  They
 are at the height of their ability to produce, and they are under no
 inhibitions when they go, and we organize them.
 Mr. IciloiD. Where is the ship at the present time?
 Dr. Waraa. The ship at the present time is still in Africa, and then
 it is committed for the next. 2 years to go to Nicaragua, and then to
 northern Colombia.
 Mr. Icuoan. That is all.
 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Clawson?
 Mr. CI.Awsox. Thank you, Air. Chairman.
 Dr. Walsh, your appearance here has been refreshing to me. With
 your background and experience and the service that you have pro-
 vided in many foreign countries, I am sure this gives you and your
 testimony credence before this committee on the subtleties and the
 sophistication of today's communistic techniques. I think from your
 testimony that even this emphasis on the theme "peaceful coexistence"
 is another technique of the Communist activity today in trying to de-
 stroy freedom and liberty as we know and understand it,
 Dr. WAIsrr. That's right

 Approved For Rp      QO{ ,7/,Q 3FnCAAa DDB.  Bf     ROOO6OOBTiO01-8
 Mr. CLAWSON. There are, however, some rather refreshing and, I
 think, encouraging signs on the horizon.  One of them has come to
 my attention just since our last session. And, Mr. Chairman, if I may,
 I would like to refer to the Howard Payne College in Brownwood,
 Texas.  Can you hear me all right?
 Dr. WALSH. Yes, I can hear you.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I think this would please you because of what you
 have said and done.  They have established the Douglas MacArthur
 Academy of Freedom in the State of Texas and began its operation in
 September 1963.  I would like to read just a few paragraphs of their
 philosophy, aims, purposes, and standards, and perhaps we can gain
 some experience from their activity when we establish an academy
 on the Federal level.
 I quote from a brochure published by Howard Payne College :
 The purpose of the program is to prepare young people thoroughly to under-
 stand the world in which they live, to appreciate the problems which they face,
 to recognize the place of Christian leadership and to be able, successfully, to
 present the point of view of the Free World.  Such preparation should then
 enable a graduate of the Academy to go into foreign service for his country,
 to become an intelligent diplomat, to represent American corporations in foreign
 areas, to be a capable statesman at home as well as to be intelligent proponents
 of ideas and ideals calculated to promote world peace and world progress wher-
 ever he may be.  It would also provide a rich background for training toward
 foreign missions.
 And they go on.  I think perhaps I will skip over most of it and
 read just a few paragraphs :
 Since the entire program would be designed and directed toward providing
 an understanding and intelligent support of freedom and liberty, it will natur-
 ally consider those threats to them.
 Although the signers of the Constitution expressed the desire to "secure the
 blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity," such is not possible.  Each
 new generation must secure anew for themselves "the blessings of liberty."
 Each new generation must, therefore, overcome the threats to liberty which
 they face.  Because of the repeated declarations of communism to control the
 world, it seems imperative that those who cherish freedom should understand
 the aims, plans, actions and status of communism to today's world. Thus,
 there will be special courses designed to teach not only the theory of Marxism-
 Communism, but its historical significance former attempts at its use, and the
 practice of communism as found in Russia and China today.
 And they continue with this same kind of theme.  Now I don't know
 what the experience has been but, Mr. Chairman, at this point, I
 would like to have unanimous consent to insert the Senate Concur-
 rent Resolution No. 47 of the legislature of the State of Texas and
 "Facing the Future with Faith and Knowledge," from the university,
 and the "Academic Characteristics," as part of the record.  I think
 it would be helpful to the committee.
 Mr. PooL. Mr. Chairman, I would like to also join with my col-
 league in making the presentation and asking unanimous consent,
 also, since the State of Texas is my State.
 Mr. CLAWSON. It is your State.  I think it is wonderful that one
 of our States has already moved in this direction in one of their edu-
 cational institutions.
 The CHAIRMAN. The material referred to will be inserted at this
 point in the record.

 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 47
 WHEREAS, In the one hundred eighty years of its existence,
 the United States of America has vindicated the faith of its found-
 ing fathers in the type of political, economic and moral system
 they envisioned by becoming the strongest and most effective free
 nation in modern history; and
 WHEREAS. Americans are now engaged in a life and death
 struggle with the forces both inside and outside the nation which
 seek to destroy the basic freedoms and values which undergird
 the nation's strength ; and
 WHEREAS, The administration and faculty of Howard Payne
 College, a four-year Baptist institution of higher education in
 Brownwood, Texas, believe that the American heritage, Judeo-
 Christian traditions and the free enterprise system have a special
 affinity of purpose which needs to be understood and preserved;
 and
 WHEREAS, Believing that higher education has an indis-
 pensable role in the protection of the nation and in the promotion
 of the ideas upon which it was founded, Howard Payne College has
 established the Douglas MacArthur Academy of Freedom which
 will become operative in September, 1963, the first center of this
 kind ever established on a college or university campus ; and
 WHEREAS, The idea for the Academy is an outgrowth of the
 college's Democracy in Action program, which won an award from
 the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, as the
 outstanding project of its kind in the nation; and
 WHEREAS, Unlike most "freedom" and "anti-communism"
 efforts now in operation, the program will be objective arid non-
 partisan, not seeking to impose the viewpoint of any group or
 organization ; and
 WHEREAS, It should be a matter of pride to all Texans
 that a small private liberal arts college in the Southwest is the
 first in the nation to undertake such a program; and
 WHEREAS, flamed for the great American leader who said
 that the protection of this country "will only be possible if we
 regain some of the spirituality and wisdom of our forefathers
 which caused them to ordain by constitutional precepts that gov-
 ernment be servant rather than master of the people," the Acad-
 emy of Freedom will have the following three stated obligations:

 (1) it will be maintained on a high professional and educational
 level; (2) it will be non-partisan politically and seek to inspire
 all student members to search diligently for the truth without
 being inhibited in any area of life, thought and action; and
 (3) it will seek and maintain the highest type of professional lead-
 ership in the academic world and give these leaders freedom to
 inspire students to fuller understanding of the American heritage
 and the destructive processes in our culture and help them prepare
 themselves for any and all areas of public life and civic respon-
 sibility; now, therefore, be it
 RESOLVED, By the Senate of the 58th Legislature of Texas,
 the House of Representatives concurripg, that Howard Payne
 College and its administration and faculty, particularly Dr. Guy
 D. Newman, president of the college, be commended and congratu-
 lated on the concept, planning, philosophy and goals of the Douglas
 MacArthur Academy of Freedom and wish them every success
 in this important undertaking.

 STATEMENT OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED
 STATES BY BRIG. GEN. JAMES D. HITTLE, U.S. MARINE CORPS
 (RETIRED)
 The CHAIRMAN. Now at this point, I would like to insert in the
 record the statement of Brig. Gen. James D. Hittle, U.S. Marine Corps,
 retired. General Hittle is director of national security and foreign
 affairs of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.
 This statement includes the text of a resolution endorsing the
 Academy adopted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. This statement
 is to be inserted in the record.
 (The statement referred to follows:)
 STATEMENT OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED
 STATES BY BRIG. GEN. JAMES D. HITTLE, TJSMC (RETIRED)
 Mr. Chairman : My name is Brig. Gen. James D. Hittle, USMC (Retired).  I
 appear before you in my position as director of national security and foreign
 affairs of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.
 The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States is happy to have the
 privilege of appearing before this committee with respect to the establishment
 of a United States Freedom Academy.
 This statement is submitted at the direction of, and with the approval of, Mr.
 John A. Jenkins, commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the
 United States.
 The Veterans of Foreign Wars supports in principle the establishment of a
 Freedom Academy.
 The reason why the VFW supports the Freedom Academy can be summarized
 as follows :
 The United States and our allies of the free world are locked in a protracted
 struggle with communism.  The issue at stake is a very simple and basic one.
 It is whether or not the United States of America, together with the beliefs and
 institutions, which are our heritage, can survive.
 This, in essence, is the threat faced by all other freedom-loving peoples regard-
 less of the details of their governmental structure.
 Communism, operating on the basis of a strategy applied on a worldwide scale,
 is ruthless, persistent, and patient in its determination to achieve its goal of world
 conquest.
 If we are to persevere through to victory, we must know our enemy.  That
 means we must have, as a nation, a clear, a definite, and a true understanding of
 communism as a philosophy and as a system.  Such knowledge of our enemy and
 the threat he poses is indispensable to defeating that threat.
 The Veterans of Foreign Wars believes the Freedom Academy can fulfill a
 great need in providing authoritative, realistic knowledge of communism and the
 danger it poses.
 Such Academy, the VFW believes, should analyze and expose the na-
 ture of Communist aggression with its many facets, military, economic, social,
 and propaganda.
 We must also, as a nation, be mindful of our strength and our weaknesses as
 they relate to overcoming the Communist threat.  This, too, it would seem,
 would be a function of the courses of study at the Freedom Academy.
 ,The position of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in this matter is based upon
 Resolution No. 137, unanimously adopted by the thousands of delegates attending
 our 1964 national convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Aved Forga(IOZ/iet&46R000600070001-8
 At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to Insert for the record the text of
 Resolution No. 187:
 Whereas, the International Communist conspiracy Is waging a total
 political war against the United States and against the peoples and
 governments of all other nations of the free world ; and
 Whereas, the United States must develop the methods and means to
 win the nonmilitary part of the global struggle between freedom and com-
 munism, and must educate and train leaders at all levels who can
 understand the full range and depth of the Communist attack and can
 visualize and organize the methods and means needed to meet and de-
 feat this attack and to work for the preservation and extension of free-
 dom, national independence; and self-government; and
 Whereas, a proposal has been submitted to the Congress of the United
 States for the creation of the necessary agency for the accomplishment
 of these purposes: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved, by the 65th National Convention of the Veterans of Foreign
 Wars of the United States, That we urge immediate establishment
 of a Freedom Commission and Freedom Academy by the President and
 Congress of the United States to insure survival of world liberty.
 There Is one vital question that must be resolved before the Freedom Academy
 is actually established.  I refer to the method of control for such an Academy.
 The role of such an Academy, In formulating national thought concerning the
 Communist threat and the methods of overcoming it, is so critically Important
 that the governing body of the Academy must be so organized that its theoretical
 and actual adherence to the anti-Communist objectives Is fully assured.  It must
 be so composed as to make certain that softness, tolerance, and sympathy with
 communism In any form will not creep Into the curriculum and the attitude of
 the Academy.
 It would seem, therefore, that the governing body for a Freedom Academy
 should be established by law and should include, but not be limited to, the
 following:
 Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 Secretary of Defense (or his representative).
 Secretary of State (or his representative),
 The chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Internal Se-
 curity Subcommittee, United States Senate.
 The chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Un-
 American Activities, United States House of Representatives.
 It is submitted, Mr. Chairman, that unless such standards as set forth above
 are maintained for the Freedom Academy, then a Freedom Academy should not
 itself be established.  A Freedom Academy controlled by those unsympathetic to
 its Intended purpose would be, in final analysis, more dangerous in existence than
 if it had never been created.
 At a later time, Mr. Chairman, the VFW will be glad to make more specific
 recommendations as to the governing body for a Freedom Academy
 The CIIAIRMAN. Further, before proceeding with the next outstand-
 ing witness, I would like to mention the fact that the Honorable
 Joseph S. Farland, U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic
 from 1957 to 1960, Ambassador to the Republic of Panama from 1960
 to 1963, and former FBI agent, had hoped to testify in sup~iort. of
 these proposals, and he had been scheduled to appear last week, May
 7, but illness in his family prevented his attendance.  Since then, busi-
 ness has taken him on a trip to Latin America, and therefore we will
 be denied the privilege of his views, because today marks the end of the
 hearings.  STATEMENT OF THE ORDER OF LAFAYETTE
 Finally, I will point out that the Order of Lafayette, at its recent
 convention in Washington on May 8, adopted a resolution urging
 the House and Senate to take affirmative action on the Freedom Acad-
 emy bills, in their words "as a most important initial measure in a new

 Approved For R     gIA0   7/13FigI&ple&&M4 rR00060O    01-8
 strategic plan for confronting Communist aggression in the cold war."
 I understand that the resolution is being sent to us, and it will be
 incorporated in the record.
 I might mention that the Order of Lafayette is made up of military
 officers who served in France in World Wars I and II.
 (The resolution follows:)
 Whereas, it is now clearly recognized that despite economic and military su-
 periority during the past twenty years, close cooperation with the United Nations
 and the most immense foreign aid program in world history, the United States
 has deteriorated as a world power, due to massive failures in the nonmilitary area
 of political and propaganda warfare.
 Whereas, it is now becoming increasingly clear that Communist officials are
 highly trained and dedicated Marxists whose consistent goal is domination of
 the free world by a master strategic plan and by effective political warfare ; and
 that this has resulted in the successful training of 20,000 student subversives
 each year who return to their countries as effective Communist leaders to pro-
 mote infiltration and subversion : Now, therefore. be it
 Resolved, by the Order of Lafayette in convention assembled, May 8, 1965, that
 the United States immediately initiate counter-measures to confront Communist
 aggression, infiltration and political take-over, by establishing a number of
 Freedom Academies to enable the citizens of the free world to develop the politi-
 cal skills necessary to preserve their freedom ; and further be it
 Resolved, that the Order of Lafayette recommends that the House of Repre-
 sentatives and the Senate take affirmative action on the Freedom Academy and
 Freedom Commission bills as a most important initial measure in a new strategic
 plan for confronting Communist aggression in the cold war.
 The CHAIRMAN. And now we are privileged indeed to have with us
 the Honorable William C. Doherty, former U.S. Ambassador to Ja-
 maica.
 Mr. Doherty has been national president of the National Association
 of Letter Carriers and, more recently, vice president and a member
 of the executive council of the AFL-CIO.
 Now, I personally point out that Bill is every ounce a. good man, a
 good father, a good husband, and we can see he is not exactly a light-
 weight.  There are a lot of pounds of goodness in Bill Doherty.
 We are glad to have you, Bill, Mr. Ambassador.  I understand that
 we called you on short notice and I don't know whether you have been
 able to whip up anything in formal shape, but, formally or informally
 or any other way, we would like to hear from you.
 STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM C. DOHERTY
 #               Mr. DoHERTY. Mr. Chairman and Members of the distinguished
 Committee : At the outset I think I ought to make it crystal clear that
 I am not the Ambassador to whom the previous witness referred,
 although my service was in the diplomatic corps.
 The CHAIRMAN. I could have said so myself.  That part was off
 the record, but since we heard it, I am glad to have your remarks.
 Mr. DoHERTY. I found the good doctor most interesting, and I want
 to say, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, that I have had
 some personal knowledge of Project HOPE, and it pleases me no end
 to hear committee members praising the work of the good doctor.  I
 only would that there were 10,000 ships in the good doctor's fleet.
 They stopped in Jamaica while I was there, and it is a magnificent
 operation, almost akin, I think, to the Peace Corps itself and also, I
 think, akin to the good work that is being done by the American In-
 stitute for Free Labor Development.

 These are real people-to-people programs that are so vitally neces-
 sary in this day and age
 As you know, my name is ' N"illiam C. Doherty, and I am appearing
 here today as a private citizen to testify in support of the Freedom
 Commission Act.
 My background and experiences have led me to take a particular
 interest in the subject matter of this bill. For 21 years I was president
 of the National Association of Letter Carriers, and I was active in
 both the AFL and later the AFL-CIO.  I am at present a vice presi-
 dent emeritus of the latter organization.
 In addition, I served from 1962 to 19G4 as United States Ambassa-
 dor to Jamaica..  It was my Honor to be the first American Ambassa-
 dor to that nation after it received its independence from Britain.
 With this background in both labor and foreign affairs, I have had
 occasion to observe the methods employed by Communists both in this
 country and abroad in their attempts to undermine free institutions
 and turn legitimate movements and innocent individuals into instru-
 ments for furthering their totalitarian purposes.
 As is well known to the members of this committee, the Communists
 have over a period of 40 years developed and refined a number of po-
 litical warfare techniques to a high level of effectiveness.
 These techniques are taught to Communists from all over the world
 in a very extensive network of political schools within the. Communist
 countries.  The graduates of these schools then return to their own
 countries to staff Communist. Party organizations and Communist-
 front groups.
 They know how to write propaganda and how to reproduce and
 distribute it.. They know how to couch their propaganda so as to ap-
 peal to various interests and attitudes among the target population.
 The CHArRMfAN. And you are so right about that.
 Mr. DonERTY. Nell, Mr. Chairman, I am glad you interrupted, be-
 cause I wanted to make a brief reference, if I might. digress, to tell of
 an experience some 20 years ago, during my short stay in Berlin.
 At that time, in Berlin in 1945, as all of the members of the commit-
 tee know, Berlin was operating under a quadripartite setup. All four
 governments were supposedly attempting to establish constituted au-
 thority in Berlin.
 And even at that time, the Soviet- was coming into the homes in
 Western Germany, and in Western Berlin in particular, and taking
 the heads of the house, fathers, anyone with skills, away, kidnaping
 them out of the Western sector of Berlin and bringing them into
 the Soviet, into the salt mines of Siberia, never again to be seen. And
 as a result, I went on Radio Berlin at that time, referring to this sys-
 tem of slave labor, for which some of the officials in our Government,
 the Office of Military Government for the United States. were at that
 time complaining, because I used the expression "slave labor."  And
 what else was it, sir I
 They were taking them out of their homes, bringing them into the
 Soviet. Union and various places to use their skills in science and edu-
 cational fields. and they never got- back into their homes in West
 Berlin or in West Germany, and I had as my witness at that time
 the late Cardinal Von Preysing, with whom I conferred while I was
 visiting Berlin. I was over there on a special mission for the Presi-

 PROVIDING FO
 dent of the United States, who had asked me to go there through the
 good offices of General Lucius Clay.
 May I say that the Communists know how to utilize groups which
 have goals only partially compatible with communism in campaigns
 which actually further the overall Communist program.
 For example, Communists often succeed in enlisting pacifists and
 democratic social reformers in movements which are actually aimed
 more at discrediting free governments and promoting Communist to-
 talitarianism than at the limited and laudable goals to which they
 superficially appear to be directed.
 Graduates of Communist political schools know how to organize
 groups, how to arrange demonstrations, and how to transmute a peace-
 ful demonstration into forceful "mass action." They know how to use
 limited slogans to enlist peasants in guerrilla operations actually un-
 der Communist control.
 Given favorable social and political conditions, such trained polit-
 ical experts can be effective out of all proportion to their numbers.
 In stable societies, such conditions are absent, and Communist
 movements degenerate into pitiable cliques of cranks and misfits, as
 we have seen in the United States and several countries of Western
 Europe.
 In the developing nations, however, which are going through the
 wrenching revolutions set off by the Western impact and the resulting
 drive for modernization, institutions are not stable, large groups feel
 that their interests are unrepresented, masses of people are confused
 and despairing, and here the conditions for effective political action
 by Communists trained in the appropriate techniques are all too fre-
 quently present.
 In the years since World War II, and particularly in recent months
 and weeks, we have seen how dangerous Communist political efforts
 can be to the cause of democracy and pluralistic development in
 general, and to the national interests of the United States in particular.
 Communist guerrilla and political action brought Mao Tse-tung
 to power in China.  Adroit and energetic political action allowed the
 Communists to seize control of the democratic revolution which over-
 threw Batista in Cuba.
 A few months ago, a rather small number of Communists trained
 in Cuba and elsewhere came very close to maneuvering Zanzibar into
 the Communist bloc and the danger is by no means eliminated today.
 Most recently, a fairly small number of Communist agents, taking
 advantage of a people deprived of political experience by 40 years of
 reactionary dictatorship, captured at least partial control of an ini-
 tially democratic revolution in the Dominican Republic-and, mind
 you, I was just 90 miles from the Dominican Republic while I was
 stationed in Jamaica-making necessary the intervention of American
 troops to prevent the installation of a dictatorship of the left.
 I want to say, at this point, that I commend President Johnson
 for his forthright action in stabilizing the chaotic situation in the
 Dominican Republic.  His administration is taking a strong stand
 against communism in the Caribbean, just as he is in Vietnam, where
 the slightest sign of irresolution on the part of the United States could
 endanger the whole of Southeast Asia.

 However, one cannot. help but speculate as to what. might, have
 been done earlier to prevent situations such as those in Vietnam and
 the Dominican Republic from degenerating to the point that military
 action was required to stave off Communist. threats.
 Had freemen dedicated to the cause of democratic reform and
 development been as well organized, as energetic, and as well trained
 in basic political techniques as were the Communists, it would have
 been democratic groups which organized the peasantry in Vietnam
 and it. would have been democratic forces which emerged as the focal
 point of action from the confused situation in the Dominican Republic.
 Clearly, the free world must take steps to give those devoted to
 democratic action the training needed to overcome the threat of Com-
 munist activity.
 Democrats must learn how to organize student groups, labor unions,
 women's clubs, political parties, and all the other organizations basic
 to effective political action.  They must also learn the operating tech-
 niques of the Communists, so that freemen can anticipate what. the
 Communists will do and use democratic action to defeat the Com-
 munists when they do begin to move.
 The Freedom  cademy offers one promising approach to this prob-
 lem of training cadres for democratic political action. It would give
 a full-time staff the support needed to carry out research on Commu-
 nist political techniques, on the curricula of Communist political
 schools, and on the use made by local Communist parties of graduates
 of these schools. It would also allow the development of ideas and
 procedures for combating Communist subversion and building up the
 many free organizations required for a pluralistic democracy capable
 of carrying through true social reforms.
 The Freedom Academy could also instruct our diplomats, infor-
 mation experts, and aid advisers on Communist tactics in developing
 areas and on techniques which could be suggested to aid-receiving
 groups as probably effective in countering Communist challenges.
 Finally, the Academy could train members of democratic groups in
 other countries, be they farm groups, labor unions, political parties,
 government bureaucracies, or other organizations, in the political skills
 needed to effectively achieve democratic social goals and remain im-
 pervious to Communist infiltration.
 We in the American labor movement have considerable experience
 in these problems.  The international department. of the AFL-CIO
 constantly works in many ways to strengthen free, democratic labor
 unions throughout the world.
 Since 1962, the American Institute for Free Labor Development
 leas been working in Latin America to strengthen free unions and to
 bring social progress directly to their members,
 This year, the Afro-American Labor Center opened in New York
 to undertake a related program in the countries of Africa.
 I am convinced that our experience in the labor field shows that
 the type of research and training to be carried out by the proposed
 Frec Iom Academy will be very effective in building democratic in-
 stitutions and opposing communism.
 The CiuAim3iAx. May I interrupt one second?
 Mr. Donxzry. Yes, Mr. Chairman.

 The CHAIRMAN. In the conversation I had with you, I asked you
 at the time if you would talk about this work on the part of labor.
 I happen to know the work of the organization formed by the AFL-
 CIO and its effectiveness, right south of us in the South and Central
 American Republics, where people from those areas come here, and
 they learn about our type of labor movement, and go back, and then
 try to inculcate in their country what a labor movement really means
 in a democratic society.
 Mr. DOHERTY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. I am glad you brought up this point.
 Mr. DOHERTY. Thank you far that fine observation.
 If I am not considered to be presumptuous, I do believe .that the
 American Institute for Free Labor Development has been the main
 strength in the whole Alliance for Progress. If you will go down to
 any country in Central or South America or into the Caribbean area
 where I served, you will find that the AIFLD is probably better known
 than the Alliance for Progress itself, and I know that is a broad state-
 ment, but I honestly feel that way about it.
 Whereas our work is concerned with one specific type of institution,
 the Freedom Academy could operate on a broader basis and bring the
 benefits of democratic political training to a wider spectrum of
 organizations.
 To look more closely at the relevant experience of the AIFLD, I
 should like to first describe its training program.  Through local
 seminars in Latin America, through 3-month courses in resident centers
 in most capital cities, and through an additional course given at our
 school in Washington, D.C., young Latin American trade unionists
 are taught how to administer their unions, how to collect dues, how to
 prepare for responsible collective bargaining how to detect Com-
 munist attempts at infiltration, and how to foil them should they occur.
 To date over 20,000 young unionists-these are Latin Americans-
 have passed through one or another phase of this training.
 The CHAIRMAN. May I ask a question?
 Mr. DOHERTY. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. How is this financed?  Is that Federal money, now,
 or from your own coffers?
 Mr. DOHERTY. That is an excellent question.  I am very happy to
 say that the major financing comes from the welfare funds of the
 trade unions.
 In many of these larger unions, such as the Steelworkers, the Auto
 Workers, the Sheet Metal Workers, and the Electrical Workers,
 their welfare funds are bulging over with accumulated funds, and so
 this, then, gives an opportunity to use those moneys, not in violation
 of Landrum-Griffin or Taft-Hartley, but to use the moneys in the field
 of constructing homes and schools in these various countries through-
 out Central and South America.
 In addition to the moneys that come from welfare funds, some of
 the largest industries in the United States, and our businesses, are
 putting funds into the AIFLD.
 I might cite that one of the founders of the AIFLD was the late
 Eric Johnston, and even today we have men like Peter Grace of Grace
 Lines on the board of directors.  He is a former chairman of the Amer-
 icaai Institute, and the illustrious American trade union leader, George

 Meany, is also on the board of directors of the institute.  So it is not a
 government-to-government proposition.  It is a. people-to-people
 proposition, where business and labor together in the United States of
 America have started this wonderful movement to combat communism
 and all other subversive activities south of our border.
 The CHAIRMAN. Well, I compliment. the effort of labor and manage-
 ment in this project.  I think it is a wonderful institution.
 Mr. DoimirrY. Throughout Latin America these trainees are now
 moving into positions of increasing authority within their unions, often
 displacing previous Communist leadershi in the process.
 In addition to giving the trade union leaders a thorough grounding
 in democratic philosophy and skills, the AIFLD gives them a con-
 crete social program designed to bring the Alliance for Progress di-
 rectly to the workers, so that their tangible needs can be filled.
 The AFL-CIO's member unions have earmarked $67 million for
 lending to union housing projects in Latin America. Representatives
 of AIFLD's social projects department assist. Latin American unions
 in setting up credit unions, housing cooperatives, workers' banks, and
 smaller self-help projects of community development.
 In rural a    AIFLD experts help agrarian unions to bring knowl-
 edge of better farming techniques to t~ieir members and to organize
 marketing and production co-ops to increase rural productivity and
 provide a better life for the peasant..
 When programs such as these begin operating, they provide benefits
 now, that Communist agitators can only promise vaguely for the fu-
 ture, after a bloody and costly revolution.
 Taken together, we believe AIFLD's training and social programs
 offer an effective approach to building free labor institutions and, in
 the process, defeating Communist. attempts at subversion.
 I gather that many of these same approaches would be taught in the
 courses of the Freedom Academy. And on the basis of our experience
 in the international field of free trade unionism, we feel such instruc-
 tion will be of great benefit to the cause of freedom.
 Mr. POOL. May I interrupt at. this point?
 Mr. DonxwrY. Yes, Congressman Pool.
 Mr. PooL. I think that is a very good point., and I think that it is
 most important. for the success of the Freedom Academy that labor is
 provided a.n opportunity to participate in this.
 I think that probably the point is that the American people could do
 the most good internationally by showing that American labor is
 participating in this program.
 Mr. Doi. Well, I thank the distinguished gentleman from
 Texas.
 It is for this reason that I support the bill now under consideration.
 I am referring, of course, to the bill introduced by the distingiuslied
 Congressman who testified here this morning, the Honorable Hale
 Boggs, of Louisiana..
 I would like at this point. to conclude by citing a few specific lessons
 which we have learned from our overseas labor work and which, I am
 sure, will be beneficial to the successful operation of the Freedom
 Academy.
 First, the Academy must broadly represent all the main strands
 within the American political consensus. It can succeed only if it has
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For ReM%A95A/1A3 F&,    PWNM   0006000J9001-8
 the full support of most major interest groups, most philosophical
 viewpoints, and both major parties.  If it becomes the exclusive
 preserve of one clique or one viewpoint, it will never get the support
 needed to survive.
 In the case of the AIFLD, its great strength is that it is supported
 not only by labor, but also by business; not only by liberals, but by
 virtually the whole sweep of United States political opinion and by
 both Republicans and Democrats.
 The same must be true of the Freedom Academy.  Without the
 full confidence of the public as a whole, the effort would be bound to
 fail.
 I hope that in drafting the bill, machinery will be provided which
 will be sure to reflect the views of all major groups within the Ameri-
 can consensus.
 Second, in training foreigners, the Academy should work through
 existing democratic organizations in developing areas.  To oppose
 communism, people must have an alternative program to which they
 are committed as strongly as Communists are to Marxism.
 The foreign students selected should not be isolated individuals or
 "professional anti-Communists," but should be active members of
 democratic political parties, labor unions, youth groups, and other
 civil organizations.
 It is only by working through the existing democratic union move-
 ment in Latin America, which is committed to a program of social
 progress, that the AIFLD and the AFL-CIO have had any real effec-
 tiveness. I feel sure that the same principle would apply to the Free-
 dom Academy.
 Third, the Academy should work to engage the United States pri-
 vate sector as much as possible in its efforts- This is because private
 efforts are less suspect abroad than the work of a Government agency.
 Such official agencies obviously are supposed to serve the immediate
 foreign policy interests of the state, whereas private groups can be
 presumed to have wider latitude.
 The Academy should train American private citizens in how to set
 up union-to-union, farmer-to-farmer, university-to-university, and
 similar private relationships.
 The knowledge of Communist techniques and democratic political
 skills could best be transmitted from the Academy to private United
 States groups, to their counterparts abroad, rather than directly from
 our Government to foreign nationals.
 This private, institution-to-institution approach has proved its merit
 in the experiences of the AIFLD, AFL-CIO, Credit Union Interna-
 tional, Four-H, and other private groups.
 Finally, Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the commit-
 tee, the graduates of the Academy must promote a philosophy of social
 reform and economic progress in keeping with our democratic ideals.
 The groups chosen must be forces for progress, with programs directly
 attacking real social ills.
 While political skills and techniques are important, it is issues and
 programs and philosophy which win political campaigns, whether in a
 United States election or in a confused, cold war situation abroad.
 Political gimmicks will not win the cold war.

 If the policy content of a group's program is not appealingg, all the
 finely honed techniques and stratagems in the world cannot hel it to
 match the social appeals of the Communists to a desperate poon.
 The real reason why American labor's efforts abroad have Mn beesuc-
 cessful is that we stand for a better deal for the worker. The political
 skills taught in our schools, and which will be taught in the Freedom
 Academy, are of value only as mechanisms to put across our social
 message. It is the content, not the form of politics, that counts.
 I am confident that if these maxims are followed the proposed Free-
 dom Academy will make a great contributionto the cause of-democracy
 throughout the world. It is this potential that led me to come here
 today to support the bill, and I want to thank the committee very sin-
 cerely for having given me the opportunity to come here and express
 my views before such a distinguished and influential forum.
 I will gladly answer any questions, Mr. Chairman, if I can.
 The CHAIRMAN. We are deeply grateful to you, Mr. Ambassador,
 as you still retain that title, especially an ambassador of good will for
 this country abroad, and we are personally grateful to you for your
 contribution.
 Now off the record.
 (Discussion off the record.)
 The CHAIRMAN. I have no questions.
 Mr. Dona  . May I say something on the record, Mr. Chairman l
 I was very much interested in the question which Congressman
 Ichord  osod to Dr. Walsh relative to our great senior statesman,
 Averell Harriman, in the incident that occurred last week. And from
 my point of view-and I can speak very freely as an American who has
 all the rights of free speech and expression- think it was abominable.
 Something is wrong somewhere when a spokesman, a top-level re -
 resentative of the Government of the United States, can't speak freelpy,
 which is one of the basic tenets of democracies, before a student group.
 "Abominable" is the right word.
 We all believe in freedom of speech. If colleges and universities-
 and I don't condemn them, of course, as such, because it isn't the whole
 faculty or student body-have forgotten that basic tenet we are in
 serious trouble. A Government representative, a senior statesman-
 being denied that privilege tome is abominable.
 I wanted to get that off my chest.
 Mr. POOL. Mr. Chairman, I will join with you in thanking the gentle-
 man for appearing and I want to make a comment that this is without a
 doubt, to mview, the best presentation that I have heard since I have
 been a member of this committee.
 Mr. I}oHioci r. Thank you, Congressman.
 Mr. PooL. With the nermis_ion of the committee, I want to put it
 in the Cangreseivnal Record.
 The CHAIRMAN. That will be done.
 Mr. IcHoin. Mr. Chairman ?
 I wanted, Mr. Chairman, to express my pleasure at seeing Mr.
 Doherty again. I doubt if there is any person who has more friends
 on the dill than does Bill Doherty, and I want to commend you, sir,
 for a very informative and enlightening statement.
 I join with my colleague from Texas in stating that I believe you
 really have gotten at the meat of the problem.

 Witness after witness has come before this committee and has
 elaborated upon the gap, upon the deficiency which does exist, by
 pointing out that we are conversing with the leaders, but the Commu-
 nists are getting to the people, or at least a hard core, enough of a hard-
 core activist group, where they are able to overthrow the existing
 government.
 And I think what you have pointed out in your statement, what
 American labor is doing, and how it can be expanded, is one way to
 get to the people.
 I commend you highly, sir for your statement.
 You are now vice president emeritus of AFL-CIO. Are you
 actually working with the AIFLD now?
 Mr. DOHERTY. No; I am not on anyone's payroll.  I am free and
 unencumbered.  You might say that I am in a quasi-retirement
 capacity.
 I resigned as the Ambassador to Jamaica last year to come back and
 meet some of my old friends here on Capital Hill, and enjoyed it-
 tremendously, and am now enjoying my present status more than
 words can tell.
 Let me thank you, Congressman, for your expressions. I am always
 happy to come back here and identify myself with anything that has
 to do with bettering conditions here in the United States of America,
 and as you probably suspect, I loathe communism. I am not one who
 looks under the bed every night before I retire to see if there is one
 there.
 Mr. IcHORD. I agree with the gentleman there.
 Mr. DOHERTY. But we have got to keep our eyes open all the time.
 I have been on the international committee of the old AFL, and the
 AFL-CIO, from 1945 on, more than 20 years' service on that commit-
 tee, and it is something to keep watching.
 We have got to be on the alert all the time, and that is one of the
 reasons I was prompted to come here this morning.
 Thank you, again, very much.
 Mr. ICHORD. I would join with the gentleman there.  I have often
 said that one of the greatest problems that responsible people have in
 fighting communism is this hysteria fringe which tends to see a Com-
 munist behind every bush, and it makes it more difficult to really get
 down to the real battle of fighting communism and knowing how to
 fight it.
 Mr. DOHERTY. Thank you, sir.
 Mr. IcHORD. I am very happy that our colleague from Texas is
 putting Mr. Doherty's statement in the Record.  I think that it is
 excellent. As I indicated a while ago, this is a real analysis of the
 problem.
 The CHAIRMAN. May I add just one thought?
 I think one of the finest sentences of the statement is the one appear-
 ing on page 2: I'They"-the Communists-"know how to utilize
 groups which have goals only partially compatible with communism
 in campaigns which actually further the overall Communist program."
 And I think that is exactly what is in your mind, and has been in my
 mind all these years as a member of this committee.  From this flows
 the utilization of front organizations. One of the Communists' major
 weapons is their ability to take a high-sounding name for an organiza-

 tion and attract the unsuspecting and the otherwise good people to
 join and then just sell that line through those groups,
 I think that is a beautiful sentence.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I would just like to join with my colleagues, Mr.
 Ambassador.  I appreciate the statement.  I think it is a very fine
 one, and frankly, it has been my first opportunity to hear you, so, as a
 result, I am even more appreciative of the fact that your testimony
 is in this hearing record.
 I think it will make a real contribution when the Academy has been
 established, because of the technical nature of your background and
 experience, things that should be done in the Academy, and how it
 should operate.
 Mr. DoHERTY. Thank you, Congressman Clawson.
 Mr. CLAWSON. I commend your view and thank you for being here
 with us.  I am glad that. I was a part. of this committee this morning.
 Mr. DOHERT%. Thank you.  Thank you very much.
 The CHAIR MAN. Well, good luck, Bill.
 Now, our final witness is Mr. Rufus C. Phillips III. Is he with us?
 Mr. Phillips is president of Intercontinental -Consultants, Inc., with
 offices in five countries. During the past 10 years, he has served as a
 United States Army officer in orea, special adviser for psychological
 warfare with the United States military advisory group in Vietnam,
 planning officer, adviser on countersubversion in Laos and Vietnam, in
 both an official capacity with the Department of State and as a private
 expert.
 We are very delighted to have you, sir, and I know you will give us
 very valuable information.
 STATEMENT OF RUFITS C. PHILLIPS III
 Mr. Puuiars. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I would like
 to say initially that Mr. Doherty has already said a good deal of what
 I planned today to say in a general senses
 The CIIAIRBMAN. Say it in your own words.
 Mr. PHHauPS. -so I won't repeat too much of what he said.
 I will try and talk, however, to my own personal experience, which
 includes about 6 years out in Southeast. Asia, working mostly out
 at the grass- or rice-roots level, attempting to help local people combat
 communism and, at the same time build a government and a political
 life for themselves that they would feel was worth risking their own
 lives to defend, and this is precisely, and has been precisely, the issue
 at stake in Southeast Asia now for many years.
 I have also had some experience in Latun America, about 3 years as
 a private businessman, and I have had extensive conversations with
 Latin American friends of mine on the same subject.
 More recently, I have spent almost a year in the Middle East and
 have found an astonishing similarity of problems and of attitudes on
 the part of many of the people in those countries in comparison
 with Asia and Latin America, and what they seek from the United
 States.
 The kind of assistance they would like to have from us, and the
 kind of assistance to date that they have not been receiving, is, in
 particular, what I think that the Freedom Commission and the Free-
 Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000600070001-8
 Approved For R J      R0p69,7/13F,RQiDF         R0006009 8001-8
 dour Academy bill will supply. It is something which has been lack-
 ing, almost completely lacking, in many countries, in the execution
 of our foreign policy.
 I testify from personal experience, having been a member of the
 overall State Department setup. I was in the Agency for International
 Development, most recently as the assistant director for rural affairs
 and counterinsurgency in Vietnam, which was the entire AID pro-
 gram targeted at the rural area in an attempt to win the people away
 from communism.
 I can testify that, in my opinion, most of our people serving abroad
 in the United States Government do not understand revolution, do not
 understand communism as an organizational weapon, even though
 they may understand the theory of it, and, for the most part, are not
 able to work effectively with local people in a team relationship wherein
 they help the local people to develop ideas and ways and means of
 effectively combating communism and building political institutions
 for themselves in which they believe and which they will support.
 And, as I understand it-I have read all of the literature about it --
 I think that the proposed Freedom Academy would help supply this
 need.
 We need to train Americans in how to deal with communism and
 how to assist people in foreign countries in opposing it.  At the
 same time, we need to provide a facility for training those from
 abroad.
 I can tell you a personal experience of mine, and a most recent one.
 While I was in the Middle East, I made a friend who is a young
 Arab who comes from one of the countries there which has been in
 the midst of a revolution, has had about 20 coups since World War II,
 is still going through constant political turmoil, and is gradually
 drifting toward the left, closer and closer to the Communist bloc.
 This Verson told me that if he and others at some time earlier had
 only had an opportunity to receive some training in the techniques of
 opposing communism and of building their own country along demo-
 cratic lures, that he felt that the history of his country would not
 be the same as it is today.
 And he said, "Even now, if there was some training in the United
 States that some of us who truly love our country could receive, we
 could put it to use and I assure you that our country would not go
 Communist. But,'; he said, "I have gone to the American Embassy
 to some friends I have and presented them with this problem, and
 they say that there is no training like this available in the United
 States.
 "I have been to the United States.  I know something about your
 political institutions.  I know that you have much to contribute, and
 there is much for us to learn that we could apply in our country.
 But," he said, "how can I do this? Where *can I go?  Who can I get
 to help me?  We need this training and, if we could only get it, we
 could change the history of our country."
 I can assure the committee that in many other countries this is also
 true.  I know from my own personal experience in Southeast Asia that
 there have been occasions when people have approached me for this
 kind of training and there has been no place for them to go, no one
 that I could refer them to.  Consequently, some of us have been con-

 duct in , in effect, an on-the-job training pro rram, if you will, in how
 to apply democratic techniques in this revolutionary situation in South-
 east Asia. And if we have had any success at all, it is because we have
 been able to speak to the local people on their own terms and to respond
 to their real problems.  But we had to learn through experience--the
 hard way.
 I have brought along with me here a statement from one of the
 nationalist leaders of South Vietnam, who is today a prominent ad-
 viser to the South Vietnamese Government.  He wrote something in
 1963 which was a paper addressed to his own people, about the polit-
 ical dilemma in Vietnam and what he felt was the way out.
 And in this paper he had something very cogent to say about Amer-
 ican aid and American assistance, and, mind you, this person is very
 friendly toward the United States.
 I would like to read this, because I believe it applies precisely to the
 Freedom Academy proposal.  It will illustrate to you how many
 Southeast Asians feel about the United States and what they seek
 from the United States.  He says the following :
 In short, in its aid to the under-developed world in the midst of a revolution
 for emancipation, the U.B. has never yet fought against the Communists with
 ideas of Freedom and of Justice but, at least until now, only with bombs and
 dollars.  Instead of assuming the role of a leader, it has confined itself to that
 of a mere purveyor of means. ? * *
 And I would like to go on and read another paragraph.  He says :
 With regard to the anti-Communist fight in general, the political solution
 consists of reinvigorating the Vietnamese anti-Communist movement, of a re-
 organization and a development of the tiationalists, and of reinforcing the anti-
 Communist motivation by an efficient national renovation based on democracy.
 By ignoring our revolution and the intranational aspect of our anti-Communist
 fight, the U.B. has jeopardized such a solution instead of helping work for it.  As
 a high-ranking American official put it, "the anti-Communist fight in Vietnam is
 seventy-five percent political and twenty-five percent military." Yet, everything
 American is directed to the twenty-five percent and nothing to the seventy-five
 percent. ? ? * The way out, to our mind, is not by an abandonment but, on the
 contrary, by going deep into every local revolutionary problem and helping solve
 them using principles of justice and freedom, and perhaps in fusing them with
 the revolutionary spirit of 1776 from which the United States herself was born
 and developed. * * 41
 Now and my personal belief is that the proposed Freedom Acad-
 emy could help supply this-if we can infuse our own people who go
 abroad with the spirit of 1778, and if we can help infuse students who
 come from abroad with this spirit, along with knowledge of the tech-
 niques of a democratic revolution, this will indeed supply something
 that has been terribly lacking in the executign of our foreign policy.
 Very frankly, had we been able to supply these things earlier in
 Vietnam, I assure you the course of history there would have been
 different.
 I was there from 1954 to 1956, when indeed we did supply some of
 these things, and this is why Vietnam survived at that time.
 One of the things that we did at that time was to bring potential
 Vietnamese leaders over to the Philippines, where they were able to see
 the revolution that the late President Magsaysay was carrying out
 there, when the Communist Huks in the Philippines were defeated
 precisely because Magsaysay was able to restore the faith of the Philip-
 pine people in their own government and in their own system of
 government.

 Well, this is exactly what was needed in Vietnam-to establish a
 system of government in which the people could believe. We helped
 President Ngo Dinh Diem do this, and it was a good system. Un-
 fortunately, we failed to provide any meaningful followup guidance
 and assistance, and the system eventually went sour. But Initially,
 Vietnam survived because, quite frankly, there were Americans in
 Vietnam at the time of 1954 who were able to guide and advise and
 assist the Vietnamese in setting up a government and in holding
 together their country.
 Mr. POOL. At this point, Mr. Chairman, could I interrupt?
 The CHAIRMAN. Yes.
 Mr. PooL. That is one of the reasons that the American Government
 had such a problem during the last year or two in Vietnam, attempting
 to set up a government, something for them to fight for.
 That s what your testimony in ?act said, to the effect that it is very
 important to have a democratic-t pe government, and not just a
 dictatorship or reestablish another dictatorship or something like that.
 That is, in effect, what our problem is.  Isn't that right ?
 Mr. PHILLIPS. That is correct. And by establishing the right kind
 of government, you create a cause for which the people are willing
 to fight.
 You can't do this by imposing something on them, but you can do it
 by working with them, as.friends, to help bring these political things
 about.  Frankly, because our people are not trained in politics and
 most of them, most of our people in the State Department and in AID,
 have had no political experience, they tend, without being unduly
 critical, to be bureaucratic in their outlook.  This is not a bureaucratic
 problem, and one of the things that I would hope for is that, through a
 Freedom Academy, we could introduce many of our people in the State
 Department to actual practical political problems in the United States.
 I would like to say that I also concur completely with Mr. Doherty
 in that I feel that a great deal of participation from the private sector
 is essential if the Freedom Academy is to really respond to this type of
 problem.  I would like to see as much private participation as possible.
 I would also like to see that selected foreign nationals, who very often
 have quite acute observations to make about Americans and American
 institutions and how they can be applied in their own countries, should
 also have an opportunity to part icl ate in an advisory role to this
 Commission and to the Freedom Academy.
 My only reservation about the Freedom Academy is that it could
 become dominated too much by a bureaucratic outlook, that is to say,
 by the bureaucracy of the U.S. Government. If this happens, I don't
 think that the Academy will be effective, because unless it is able to
 operate semi-independently, unless it is able to establish connections
 with people abroad through private groups in the United States, a lot
 of the dynamism and a lot of the spirit of the thing will be lost. To be
 successful, this can't be an administrative, bureaucratic approach to
 things. It must be full of inspiration, and it must generate a genuine
 desire on the part of the people who attend it to go out and do concrete
 things for their country.
 Unfortunately, this is not the spirit that comes through much of the
 training which is being given inside our Government today. There
 is too much, and I suppose this is natural, but there is too much empha-

 sis on administration. I would like to say, also, that I do not believe
 that the proposed bill put forth by the State Department for the Na-
 tional Academy of Foreign Affairs would in any sense be adequate for
 this problem. It would merely be an expanded version of what is now
 being given, which is, I assure you, inadequate. I speak from personal
 experience, because, although I have not attended these courses, I have
 given lectures at them. If the Freedom Academy idea and programs
 are incorporated in a National Academy of Foreign Affairs, it will not
 produce what is needed. It will not respond to what is a tremendous
 need in our foreign policy, a critical need.
 That's all I have to say Mr. Chairman.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much for a very fine presentation.
 Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank Mr. Phillips for appear-
 ing before the committee and giving us the benefit of his judgment
 and experience.
 I think you might, by reason of your experience in Vietnam, enlighten
 me on a question which has bothered me. I can't understand how the
 Viet Cong have apparently successfully managed and utilized terror
 tactics on the one hand against the po ulace, and then with the other
 hand held out the sugar plum, so to speak.
 Mr. Pauams. Well, the Communists are quite selective in their
 terror tactics.  You will find that, generally speaking, their direct
 terrorism is at. people who are already fairly firmly committed to our
 side, and if they are dealing with it group of the population which is
 fairly neutral, then they will try to select out among that population
 as targets for their terror those who have some tendency to go against
 them. They make examples of these people.
 In order to understand how the Communists are organized in South
 Vietnam, you really should go back a number of years, actually back to
 the war against the French, which the Communists took over.  In
 fact, Ho Chi Minh, as far as many Vietnamese are concerned, is in
 essence the Benedict Arnold of Vietnam, because he was a traitor to
 what was initially a nationalist revolution. During the war against
 the French in South Vietnam, there were a number of areas where
 resistance developed against the French. The Communists took over
 this resistance movement, and historically, you have had in these areas
 families who have always been a part of the resistance movement. As
 the resistance was taken over by the Communists, many of these
 families continued as Communists.
 Some left because of the Communist takeover of the resistance, but
 it has been on the basis of those families who remained in various areas
 that the Communists have been able to come back into South Vietnam
 and start, out with an organizational base.  Using this base, they
 expanded their organization through the family system.  As you
 know, in Asia, and particularly in any culture which is influenced by
 the Chinese, the family is extremely strong. Consequently, the Coni-
 munists, working through the family, initially recruit- a man's brother,
 then his cousin, and so on, and this is how they have been able to spread
 their organization.
 Now, gradually, of course, as they have grown stronger, their orga-
 nization is no longer based on family ties, but this is really how it
 starts out.

 When I was in Vietnam in 1954 and 1955, .I was assigned as an
 adviser to the Vietnamese Army on what were then called pacification
 operations. The Vietnamese Army was sent out into two very large
 zones which the Communists had occupied, to reoccupy these zones
 and take them over for the national government.  One of the things
 we found was that just before the zones were occupied by the national
 government, the Communists had ordered their troops, all the unmar-
 ried ones to marry local girls, thereby immediately establishing family
 relationships.
 Secondly, they kidnaped as many young men as they could from
 these areas, from the ages of about 10 to 16, and they took them up
 north for training.
 This meant that all of the relatives of those young men were auto-
 matically involved in the movement. These young men were trained
 up north and sent back into the south, in 1958, 1959, and 1960, and
 some are still coming back.  They, in turn, contacted their relatives
 upon their return to the south, which gave them a base. And then
 from that base they began to expand, using precisely the method of
 selective terror, of attempting to single out and eliminate those people
 who were supporting the government, and also to cow the majority
 into submission.
 Mr. ICHORD. They only use the terror tactics when they are in a
 position of strength, then?
 Mr. PHILLIPS. No; they started out initially with terror tactics.
 Their objective was to eliminate all government authority at the lowest
 level, that is, at the hamlet and village level.  Consequently in 1959
 and 1960, they assassinated some 4,000 to 5,000 local government offi-
 cials. This immediately created a vacuum, a political and adminis-
 trative vacuum, in the rural areas into which they moved.
 Mr. ICHCRD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. CLAwsoN. T don't have any questions.
 I want to thank Mr. Phillips for being here. I think your back-
 ground of experience certainly served its purpose, by the evidence,
 the testimony that you provided for us.
 Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you very much, sir.
 I would like to say that I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I
 certainly hope it passes. It has been long overdue.
 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
 CLOSING STATEMENT OF HON. EDWIN E. WILLIS
 Mr. WILLIS. The Chair wishes to say that recently I had occasion to
 examine the December 1964 issue of Free China t Asia, which is the
 official publication of the Republic of China unit of the Asian Peoples'
 Anti-Communist League, an organization established by the free gov-
 ernments and peoples of Asia shortly after the cessation of hostilities
 in Korea in order to promote freedom and oppose the spread of com-
 munism on that continent.
 This magazine contains some of the major speeches delivered at the
 10th Conference of Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League, which
 was held in Taipei, Formosa, in November 1964, and also messages
 sent to the conference and resolutions adopted by it.  Before com-
 menting on one of those resolutions, I would like to state a few facts

 about the conference referred to so that those not familiar with the
 Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League will have some understanding
 of its significance and influence.
 Forty-seven units representing both member nations of the Asian
 Peoples' Anti-Communist. League and observers attended its 10th Con-
 ference on Formosa. They came from many parts of the world.
 Among the delegates were the former President of Lebanon, 3 former
 or incumbent Speakers of Parliaments, 2 former Premiers, 7 former
 Ministers, 2 former Ambassadors, 23 incumbent Members of Parlia-
 ments, 7 political party leaders, and 3 mayors or Governors.  In addi-
 tion, there were college presidents, professors, industrial leaders, and
 political commentators. More than 60 messages from anti-Communist
 leaders in various nations were received, including messages from the
 Presidents of the Philippines, the Republic of Vietnam, and the Re-
 public of Korea.
 Obviously, this organization and its proceedings warrant our atten-
 tion and consideration, and I would like to read mto the record at this
 point the text of one of the resolutions adopted at the conference:
 RF..soLuTioN SUPPORTING 0PERA7I0Y OF THz APACL FREEDOM CENTER
 The 10th Conference of the Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League :
 Recalling by previous League Conferences resolutions on the establishment of
 the APACL Freedom Center, on the acceleration of preparatory work for the
 APACL Freedom Center, and on finalizing the establishment of the APACL
 Freedom Center and its operation ;
 Having received with appreciation the report on the progress of the prepara-
 tory work for the APACL Freedom Center submitted by the Korean delegation ;
 In hearty appreciation of the unsparing support on the part of the Government
 and people of the Republic of Korea, as well as the wholehearted support from
 the APACL member units and observers and other freedom-loving peoples which
 have enabled the APACL Freedom Center Preparatory Commission to carry out
 preparations for the Center despite various difficulties, and especially for the
 positive support on the part of the U.S. Congress evidenced by the speech
 delivered by Rep. Dante B. Fascell, Chairman of the Subcommittee on
 International Organizations and Movements of the House Committee on Foreign
 Affairs on October 2, 1964, in the House of Representatives; and
 Recognizing the fact that operation of the APACL Freedom Center is in the
 common Interest of League member units and observers in the defeat of Com-
 munist Infiltration and Indirect aggression and the preservation of freedom and
 democracy ;
 Rcaolvee:
 (1) To urge each member-unit and observer to make every effort to Implement
 the previous resolutions of the League in supporting the establishment and opera-
 (ion of the APACL Freedom Center ;
 (2) To ask each member-unit and observer to extend further moral support
 and financial assistance to the APACL Freedom Center;
 (3) To publicize the prospectus of the APACL Freedom Center so as to
 insure enthusiastic support of the free world ;
 (4) To express appreciation to the U.S. House of Representatives for its
 positive support and encouragement and to urge for further assistance from the
 United States so that the Freedom Center may do its full part in promoting
 the Interests, values, and welfare of the free world.
 That's the end of the resolution.
 Now, what is the APACL Freedom Center referred to in this
 resolution?
 It is a cold war educational institution actually operating on a
 limited scale in Seoul, South Korea.  It is patterned after the U.S.

 of the Freedom Academy bills introduced in our Congress some years
 back.
 Just a few weeks ago, Senator Thomas Dodd, another of the leading
 congressional exponents of a Freedom Academy, made a trip to Asia.
 One of his purposes in doing so was to help launch in South Korea
 a local fund-raising drive to provide for a 2-year postgraduate course
 of study at this Freedom Center for students from all countries in
 Asia.
 John Chamberlain, in a recent column devoted to the Freedom
 Center, mentioned Senator Dodd's trip and wrote as follows concern-
 ing the projected course :
 When this course gets going, students from all over the free areas of East
 Asia will be coming to Seoul for graduate work in international politics, psycho-
 logical warfare, economic warfare, Communist Ideology, Western philosophy,
 and the culture of the Orient as it relates to man's need for freedom. * * *
 The resolution on the Freedom Center which I read a few minutes
 ago made reference to a speech in support of the Freedom Center made
 on the floor of the House last October 2 by our distinguished colleague,
 Representative Dante B. Fascell, chairman of the Subcommittee on
 International Organizations and Movements of the House Committee
 on Foreign Affairs. I would like to submit the text of Mr. Fascell's
 speech for inclusion in our hearing record at this point.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  22979-22980
 THE FREEDOM CENTER IN SEOUL,.
 KOREA
 (Mr. FASCELL (at the :request of Mr.
 MARSH) was given permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. FASCELL.   Mr. Speaker, I am
 taking the floor this morning to call to
 the attention of the House a project of
 singular importance,  undertaken re-
 cently by the Asian People's Anti-Com-
 munist League.
 I am referring to the Freedom Center
 currently under construction in Seoul,
 Korea. This unique project is designed
 to give the citizens of the free nations
 both the opportunity and the means for
 developing effective strategy and lac-
 tics  for  combating  the  Communist
 threat.
 In brief, the Freedom Center will be a
 research and training institution de-
 signed to produce cold war operational
 knowledge  and  to train leadership
 groups which, in the words of the Asian
 People's Anti-Communist League, will be
 able to "outplan, outthink, outorganize,
 and outdedlcate the Communists."
 In the center, students and leaders
 alike will be able to study such subjects
 as how to organize a democratic politi-
 cal party or labor union, how to draw up
 and execute effective social reforms, how
 to counter Communist propaganda and
 the tactics of Communist political agita-
 tors, and many others.
 A publication Issued by the Asian Peo-
 ple's Anti-Communist League describes
 the main functions to be carried out by
 the Freedom Center, as follows:
 First, to initiate and carry on a re-
 search program designed to develop an
 integrated, operational science that will
 demonstrate logically the errors and
 contradictions of the Communist ide-
 ology, thereby contributing to better un-
 derstanding of the values of freedom.
 Second, to initiate and develop effec-
 tive strategy and tactics through which
 citizens of the free world will be able to
 meet and to defeat the Communist c+on-
 -spiracy.
 Third, to educate and train anti-Com-
 munist  leaders  and  cadres  of  the
 league's member units in all aspects of
 the international Communist movement,
 and in ways and means to be employed
 td meet and defeat Communist attempts
 at subversion.
 Fourth, to Initiate and develop a pro-
 gram for exposing and frustrating Com-
 munist propaganda, and for propagating
 the gospels of freedom.
 Fifth, to perform other functions re-
 quired to carry out the objectives of the
 center.
 This is indeed an ambitious program.
 When implemented, It should have far-
 reaching implications for the cause of
 freedom not only in Asia but throughout
 the world.
 Mr. Speaker, this great project was
 initiated at the Second Extraordinary
 Conference of the Asian People's Anti-
 Communist  League,  held  in  Seoul.
 Korea, in May 1962. Four months later,
 construction commenced on a 50-acre
 plot of land donated by the Government
 of the Republic of Korea. Simultane-
 ously, a fundraising campaign was in-
 itiated by the League. By May of this
 year, approximately $1.3 million was
 raised through this campaign-one-half
 of the total needed for the project. Most
 of this money was raised in Korea-
 through government contributions and
 private donations-but the project also
 received some help from supporters in
 other countries.
 Mr. Speaker, I wish that all Members
 of the House could see the plans for the
 Freedom Center. and photographs taken
 recently which show construction prog-
 ress achieved to date.  From the stand-
 point of size and design, this is a very
 impressive project.  The framework of
 the  17-story International  Freedom
 House, which will symbolize the 17 na-
 tions which fought for the defense of
 Korea Lnder the United Nations Sag, is
 completed through the 12th floor. The
 framework of the main building Is fin-
 ished.  Only the international confer-
 ence hall, the third principal building
 planned for the center, is still on the
 drawing board.  I understand that ad-
 ditional funds will have to be raised be-
 fore construction of this building can
 begin.
 Mr. Speaker, the Freedom Center in
 Seoul, Korea demonstrates what can be
 accomplished through private initiative
 to advance the cause of freedom in the
 cold war.  The entire concept of this
 center reflects clear recognition of the
 fact that the struggle which goes on In
 the world today will be resolved ulti-
 mately in the minds of men.  In this

 struggle, words, ideas and personal dedi-
 cation to the cause of freedom, are as
 important as tanks and guns.  As a mat-
 ter of fact, the ideological elements may,
 prove decisive to the resolution of the
 cold war conflict.
 This very subject has deeply con-
 cerned a subcommittee which I have the
 honor to chair-the Subcommittee on
 International Organizations and Move-
 ments of the Committee on Foreign Af-
 fairs.  For 18 months now, my subcom-
 mittee has been studying the U.S. ideo-
 logical effort in the cold war.  We have
 looked at numerous government pro-
 grams and published an inventory of
 U.S. Government activities in this di-
 mension of our foreign policy.
 In addition, however, we have begun
 to study the significance of the private
 effort on this plane.  To date, as shown
 in the eight volumes of hearings and
 the two reports published by my sub-
 committee, we have made considerable
 progress.  But our job is not over, and
 we are continuing with our undertaking.
 Mr. Speaker, the members of the Asian
 People's Anti-Communist League, and
 the People of South Korea as a whole,
 are to be congratulated on undertaking
 the establishment of the freedom cen-
 ter.                                I am confident that the value
 of this project, and its, impact, will con-
 tinue to grow.
 I also want to take this opportunity
 to extend MY congratulations to a very
 active- and eloquent supporter of the
 freedom center whom I have met per-
 sonally-Dr. Chin Kim.  Dr. Kim has
 been staying in Washington on a fellow-
 ship, studying the operations of our Con-
 gress.  We  had  frequent  discussions
 about the freedom center and other
 issues of mutual interest. I have en-
 joyed these exchanges of views and
 found them stimulating.
 I may add that Dr. Kim is no stranger
 to the United States.  Trained at the
 University of Korea, he also studied at
 Florida Southern College, George Wash-
 ington University Law School, and Yale
 Law School.  After receving two ad-
 vanced degrees from the latter institu-
 tion, he returned to his homeland and
 began teaching at the Seoul National
 University and the Korea University.
 Since March 1962 he has served as as-
 sociate dean of the Graduate School of
 Law of Seoul National University.
 In addition he has performed public
 service in his country by serving as mem-
 ber of two Board of Appeals of the Vet-
 erans' Administration,. and as member
 of the Commission on Studies of Legisla-
 tion of the Republic of Korea.
 I was delighted to have had the op-
 portunity to know Dr. Kim.  And I con-
 gratulate him again on the Asian People's
 Anti-Communist League's Freedom Cen-
 ter in Seoul, Korea.

 The CIiAut3MATT. The existence of the APACL Freedom Center in
 South Korea is a challenge to Congress and the people of the United
 States.  The countries and organizations in Asia which have made this
 Center possible do not have our great material wealth or educational
 facilities. Yet., they have acted on what I believe-after listening
 to extended expert. testimony before this committee-is a very sound
 concept.. They have put that concept into effect.  They have made it
 a reality.
 It is my hope that the U.S. Congress will do the same, with the su -
 port of the American peo~ile.  And that support, I might. add, clearly
 exists.  A Gallup Poll, which was made a part of our hearing record
 last year, revealed that 69 percent. of the adults in this country sup-
 ported the idea of the Freedom Academy and only 14 percent opposed
 it- -and that constitutes a very large margin in our political system.
 Finally, before concluding these hearings I would like to make a
 few more remarks and insert some additional material in the record.
 In 1962 the National Governors' Conference--composed, as we all
 know, of the Governors of our 50 States-set up a Committee on Cold
 War Education. This committee, in addition to other activities, has
 sponsored a number of educational conferences on the subject of com-
 munism.
 I had the honor of addressing its 4-day conference on cold war edu-
 cation held in Tampa, Florida, in June of 1963. Hundreds of students
 took part. in this conference, which brought together over 70 top au-
 thorities from all over the country to give lectures and engage in dis-
 cussions designed to assist the Committee on Cold War Education of
 the National Governors' Conference.
 Last December, in Miami, the committee held a 12-day school on
 cold war education for aides to the Governors of our States. In the
 few years of its existence, the Governors' Conference committee has
 made a truly outstanding contribution to the subject of cold war edu-
 cation. In 1963 and 1964 it issued two very valuable reports on the
 subject-reports which contain material that is most pertinent to
 the purposes of the Freedom Academy bills.
 Cold war education, basically, is the principal function of the pro-
 posed        Academy.  In its 1963 report, the National Governors'
 Conference committee gave the following definition of cold war edu-
 cation :
 Cold War Education is the development of knowledge essential to the under-
 standing of America's heritage of freedom, and of the nature of the attacks
 upon that freedom, open and covert, by the followers of international Com-
 munism.
 Cold War Education differs from indoctrination in that it follows no party
 line requiring blind adherence and unwavering obedience.  It depends upon,
 and seeks to stimulate, the mind, the imagination, the knowledge, and the spirit
 of the individual in the belief that these are America's greatest resources in
 the bitter conflict called Cold War. *
 The appendix to the 1963 report has been both widely distributed
 and widely proclaimed in this country.  It is entitled "W1  Cold War
 Education.'  I have read and studied this statement. T believe it is
 excellent and would like at this point to enter the text of it in the record
 of these hearings.

 Why Cold War Education
 America-as a nation and as a system of government-is
 the most successful of all experiments in freedom.
 Individual citizens, working together as free men, have
 prospered, and have built the greatest nation the world has
 ever known. Freedom has been held so dear by Americans
 that they have always been willing and proud to defend it
 against all challenges.
 Today the nation faces the greatest challenge ever made
 to its freedom.
 The challenge comer from the Communist war to win
 total world domination. The Communist bloc is totally dedi-
 cated to the defeat of all free nations. With the Soviet
 Union as the power base, the Communist apparatus has
 advanced in deadly earnest since the end of World-War II
 until today more than one-third of the world's population,
 more than a billion people, have become slaves to Communist
 dictatorship.
 The advances of Communism have introduced new concepts
 of warfare to which the American people must become accus-
 tomed and adapt their defences.
 In a shooting war it is very .clear what must be done.
 Americans have always risen readily to the challenges of
 such an attack, and willingly sacrificed their comforts, and
 even their lives, to assure victory and the perpetuation of
 freedom. Until the shooting starts, however, free and trust-
 ing Americans abound with good will toward all mankind,
 and are characteristically unable to accept that others may
 be working vigorously for the demolition of their way of
 life.
 Although Hitler spelled out his global objectives in Mein
 Kampf, few Americans understood the reality of his war
 until the actual shooting started.
 Like Hitler, the Communists have embarked upon a pro-
 gram of world conquest. Like Hitler, they have announced
 their plans, and have reiterated them many times in many
 forums. The war being waged by Communism is called the
 Cold War. Many- Americans fail to accept the reality of this
 war because there is comparatively little shooting.
 The (:old War of (;omn,unism far outshadows any 'creation
 of the Third Reich. It is the broadest, most effective political
 warfare ever conducted in the history of mankind. Its aim is
 to cwu/uer the rest' of //re free world by use of diplomatic
 proposals, eeonornic sor/ics, propaganda, inlimidalon, sabotage,
 terrorism, snpporl of remolrrtiorraries in now-free countries, and
 by c/rh?in,S' acedgrc between .the frer-world allies.
 Theme multi.prrnrucd thrusts are made against it back-
 ground of diversions in which the threat of military force
 is alternated with strident demands for disarmament, and
 equally strident opposition to inspection and control pro-
 cedures to make disarmament meanuigful.

 Communist political warfare, as conceived by Lenin and
 Stalin, and practiced by Khrushehev, is keyed to the sys-
 tematic penetration of it country---the infiltration of stra-
 tegic unions, communications media, government agencies,
 asssociutlons and other private institutions and groups for
 the destruction of moral fiber, the confusion of national
 purpose. and the creation of misinformation and
 misunder- standing nmong the individual citizens.
 As part of their political warfare, the Communists would
 have us believe that the only contest is between ideologies
 -that the appeal of Communism has been the key to their
 expanding influence. Like magicians they would have us
 look at the wrong hand-the hand called ideology.
 I'hr hand iii/h ihr dagger is called politral warfare.
 Arguing the merits of the Communist philosophy offers
 no more protection from political warfare than arguing the
 /   merits of Hitler's national socialism would have stayed his
 armies. The enslaved Eastern European peoples did not fall
 to the appeal of Communism. They fell to political warfare
 backed by Soviet Armies. It was not the appeal of Com-
 munism that returned the Hungarians to the Communist
 yoke. It was not the appeal of Communism that enslaved
 the peoples of China and Cuba. It was the practice of poli-
 tical warfare.
 Ideology must be studied and understood as a part of the
 Cold War Education. But the study and understanding
 should come within the frame of reference used by today's
 Communist leaders, and given the recognition due it as an
 element of all-out political warfare.
 The only real obstacle standing today br/wren Communism
 and world dictatorship is a s/rung United S/ales, determined to
 use its strength in freedom's cause.
 The Communists know better than many individual
 American citizens that the national power of the United
 States will be used in meeting the multiple challenges of
 Communism to the extent that citizens, acting through their
 elected representatives, urge or endorse effective action. In
 a free society, government serves the private citizen, and
 is ultimately responsible to the composite will of all its
 citizens. The essential difference between a dictatorship and
 a democracy is that in one the citizens follow the will of
 the government, and in the other, the government follov's
 the will of its citizens.
 The prosperity and progress of America has come dan-
 gerously close to erasing from the national scene a proper
 concept of the responsibilities and duties of citizenship. We
 count our telephones and televisions, we rate ourselves by
 the cost of our cars and the cut of our clothes. Our material
 progress, which may be duplicated by other societies, has
 become a yardstick-a false yardstick-of Americanism.
 The basic American heritage is the right to live in free-
 dom.

 Freedom, though, is neither automatic nor conferred by
 the happenstance of birth or geography. Freedom must be
 earned again by each succeeding generation through the
 sound exercise of its citizenship responsibilities. Every
 American citizen has the duty to inform himself on impor-
 tant issues so that he might better exercise his right to be
 heard, his right to vote, his. right to freedom.
 Too often by a desire to sidestep conflict, or simply be-
 cause of laziness, many American citizens ignore the rights
 and are too timid to assume the responsibilities of their
 citizenship. They abdicate their role in democracy with a
 shrug or the explanation that "the government knows more
 about this than I do, so why should I be concerned?"
 For democracy to work, the individual citizen inust face up
 to major issnes of the day, inform inmtself and express himself
 in an aroused and concerned ecercise of those acts of citizenship
 unique to our democratic system.
 ii citizens' responsibility is far greater than in other types Yof
 war. In addition to his responsibility to help shape govern-
 mental actions, he himself is on the front line, and must
 fight independent of, but in cooperation with, his govern-
 ment. Private individuals, organizations and institutions
 must fill the gap between what government can do, and
 vhat must be done.
 If he is to be effective, cold war education for the indi-
 vidual citizen must include:
 egments of society are involved. Since, in a free society,

 he can be most effective as a free citizen in defeating
 the Communist attack upon his freedom. It is his life
 and his liberty that are in jeopardy.
 "rr the, search for Cold War understanding, individual
 initiative and judgment play a vital role, and must be fos-
 tered. Each citizen must use his own judgment and reach
 his own conclusions as to the truth and soundness of state-
 ments by others. Blind acceptance of the positions of others,
 regardless of position or personality, plays into the hands
 of the aggressor.
 The ('old War is a real and deadly struggle from which
 (only one side will emerge victorious. It is the duty of each
 citizen to\utilize his rights of citizenship to become a dis-
 cerning Cold War warrior himself, and to encourage others

 The CHAIRMAN. I would also like to quote here an excerpt from
 the introduction to the 1964 report of the National Governors' Con-
 ference Committee on Cold War Education.  It states :
 This Committee was an outgrowth of the Governors' Arm conviction that the
 minds of men are the most vital weapon in the arsenal of freedom, and that
 knowledge and understanding transcend the might of rockets and the power
 of the neutron as a tool to be wisely used In the search for peace.
 The involvement in this manner by the Governors was predicated on the
 recognition that the Cold war is a very real war which is being waged in ways
 and on fronts that strike more directly at the foundations of American freedoms
 than all of the bombs and bullets that have echoed through the Nation's his-
 tory. * * *
 Many outstanding witnesses have appeared before this committee
 in the course of these hearings-former Ambassadors and Foreign
 Service officers, professors and scholars who are recognized through-
 out the world as authorities on communism, Members of the House
 and Senate representatives of labor, the press, former high-ranking
 military officers, to name just a few.  All have given their explicit
 support to the Freedom Academy.  But the statement which I have
 just quoted must, I believe, also be accepted as a strong endorsement,
 even though only implicit-, of the Freedom Academy by a committee
 which speaks for the Governors of 50 States. What we are really
 dealing with in the Freedom Academy idea is an effort to go beyond
 conventional warfare and diplomacy, beyond guns and dollars, and
 to put the minds of men to work in the sti ugggle against communism-
 the minds of our Government officials, our leaders in civilian life, and
 also civilian and governmental lenders in foreign countries.  As the
 Governors' committee stated, "the minds of men are the most vital
 weapon in the arsenal of freedom," and they "transcend the might of
 rockets and the power of the neutron." I  lieve this is unquestion-
 ably true and that, because it is true, it is time for us to make every
 effort to really put those minds to work by giving them the compre-
 hensive knowledge of Communist-style warfare which they must
 have to function at full ca acity.
 The same quotation also stresses another major point involved in
 these hearings when it says that the cold war is a very real war being
 waged in ways and on fronts "that strike more directly at the foun-
 dations of American freedoms than all of the bombs and bullets that
 have echoed through the Nation's history."
 Here again they go right to the point of the Freedom Academy-
 the devising of means to defeat the Communists on these unconven-
 tional fronts which can be more dangerous to our Nation and the
 cause of freedom everywhere than the traditional military fronts.
 The Governors' Conference committee notes our major cold war
 weakness-and the one the Freedom Academy is primarily designed
 to correct-when it states :
 Despite more than a decade of discussion and the use of real and imagined
 threats of Communist influence or involvement in nearly every major national
 and International Issue discussed by the American people, there exists today
 very little real grassroots understanding of the nature of Communism or the
 application of its theory by the totalitarian dictators based in Moscow and
 Peking.
 This lack of understanding has been recognized by academicians and edu-
 cational administrators throughout the Nation. * * *

 PROVID
 The Governors are realistic in their report. They feel confident
 that the work their Committee on Cold War Education has done to
 overcome this weakness by sponsoring national strategy seminars,
 conferences on cold war education, and other activities has helped,
 but they realize the battle is not yet won and that more work has to
 be done. Their work, they say-  .
 is not likely to change the course of history, or win peace for the world tomor-
 row, but we are firmly convinced that it can lead to the sort of bold new pro-
 grams and the enlightened citizen support that can change the course of history
 and strike vital blows for peace.  It can assure that the great body of public
 opinion on pressing issues will not be shaped by either extremists or oppor-
 tunists, and it carries the promise that no ideological battles will be defaulted
 to the Communists by ignorance or naivete in America.
 More than any other instrument, the Freedom Academy should be
 able to complete and bring to fruition the vital work begun by the
 National Governors' Conference through its Committee on Cold War
 Education.  It should be abler--in time-to drastically change the
 course of history, strengthening freedom in all parts of the world,
 just as the Communist schools of political warfare have played a major
 role in making history during the past 40-or-so years. The difference
 will be that, while the Communist political warfare schools have been
 designed to teach men how to destroy and subvert in the interest of an
 ideology which constitutes the blackest form of reaction, the Freedom
 Academy will have the positive purpose of strengthening freedom
 and spreading it to all parts of the globe, including, ultimately, those
 nations today enslaved by Commun - st totalitarianism.
 If the Freedom Academy is established-as I hope it will be-it will
 not end the need for continued effort on the part of the National Gov-
 ernors' Conference. Rather, the two will be able to supplement and
 aid one another, and this I hope they will do.  And the same applies,
 of course, to all groups, organizations, and institutions which are con-
 tributing in anyway-large or small, at home or abroad-to the fight
 for freedom, which is also the fight for peace. We are all in this to-
 gether, and all should unite and cooperate in finding the best way to
 spread thorough knowledge and understanding of our enemy and his
 stratagems and also the best methods of defeating them in order that
 freedom may be preserved.
 Communism is tyranny, and tyranny promotes war.  Communism
 is, therefore, the enemy of peace, and there can be no real peace until it
 is destroyed.
 The authors of the concept embodied in the bills the committee has
 been studying have decided to call the institution these bills would
 create the Freedom Academy.  It would be trul that, because it is
 designed to assist in the defeat of totalitarian and tyrannical commu-
 nism-the major enemy of freedom in today's world. But this Acad-
 emy could also be called the Peace Academy, because freedom is the
 friend and promoter of peace, just as tyranny and communism are its
 enemies. The motto of the Academy could well be "To Peace Through
 Freedom."
 Mr. CLAWSON. Mr. Chairman, would the chairman yield?
 Did they make any recommendations on the bills?
 The CHAIRMAN. Oh, yes.  That is in the statements.
 This concludes our hearings on these bills.

 SHORT TITLE
 SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the "Freedom
 Commission Act".
 CONGRESSIONAL  FINDINGS  AND  STATEMENT  OF  POILCY
 SEC. 2. (a) The Congress of the United States makes
 the following findings and statement of policy:
 (I)  The United States in preparing to defend its
 national interests in coming years faces grave and complex
 problems in the nonmilitary as well as military areas.
 (2) First and foremost are the problems raised by the
 unremitting drives by the Soviet Union and Communist
 China seeking world domination and the destruction of all
 non-Communist societies.  The Communist bloc and the
 various Communist parties have systematically prepared
 themselves to wage a thousand-pronged aggression in the
 nonmilitary area.  Drawing on their elaborate studies and
 extensive pragmatic tests, Communist leaders have developed
 their conspiratorial version of nonmilitary conflict into an
 advanced, operational art in which they employ and orches-
 trate an extraordinary variety of conflict instruments in the
 political, psychological, ideological, economic, technological,
 organizational and paramilitary areas enabling them to ap-
 proach their immediate and long-range objectives along
 many paths. This creates unique and unprecedented prob-
 lems for the United States in a conflict that is being waged

 1  in student organizations, peasant villages, labor unions, mass
 2  communication systems, in city and jungle, and institutions
 3 and organizations of every description, as well as in the
 4 world's chancelleries. Recognizing that nonmilitary conflict
 5 makes extraordinary demands upon its practitioners, the
 6 Communists, for several decades, have intensively trained
 7 their leadership groups and cadres in an extensive network of
 8 basic, intermediate, and advanced schools. The Sino-Soviet
 conflict capacity has been immeasurably increased by the
 10 mobilization of research, science, industry, technology, and
 11 education to serve the power-seeking ambitions of Com-
 12 munist leaders rather than the needs of their people.
 13     (3) Second, the problems of the United States are
 14 complicated by the emergence of many new nations, the
 15 unstable or deteriorating political, social and economic con-
 16 ditions in many parts of the world, the revolutionary forces
 17 released by the 'rising expectations of the world's people,
 18 and other factors, all of which increase the difficulties of
 19 achieving our national objectives of preventing Communist
 20 penetration while seeking to build viable, free, and inde-
 21  pendent nations.
 22 (4) The nature of the Sino-Soviet power drive, the
 23 revolutionary and fluid world situation, the emergence of
 24 the United States as the major leader of the free world and
 25 the need to deal with the people of nations as well as govern-

 1 meats, has compelled the United States to employ many new
 2 instruments under the headings of traditional diplomacy,
 3 intelligence, technical assistance, aid programs, trade devel-
 opment, educational exchange, cultural exchange, and
 5  counterinsurgency (as well as in the area of related military
 6  programs). To interrelate and program these present in-
 7 struments over long periods already requires a high degree
 8 of professional competence in many specialties, as well as
 9  great managerial skill.
 10      (5) However, the United States has fallen short in
 11 developing and utilizing its full capacity to achieve its objec-
 12                                 tines in the world struggle. Not only do we need to improve
 13 the existing instruments, but a wide range of additional
 14  methods and means in both the Government and private
 15 sectors must be worked out and integrated with the existing
 16  instruments of our policy. Otherwise, the United States will
 17 lack the means to defeat many forms of Communist aggres-
 18 sion and to extend the area of freedom, national independ-
 19                                 ence, and self-government, as well as to attain other national
 20  objectives.  However, this will require an intensive and
 21 comprehensive research and training effort first to think
 22 through these additional methods and means, and, second, to
 23 educate and train not only specialists, but also leaders at
 24  several levels who can visualize and organize these many
 25 instruments in an integrated strategy, enabling the United

 1  States to approach its national objectives along every path
 2 in accord with our ethic.
 3     (6) There has been a tendency to look upon strategy as
 4  a series of discrete problems with planning often restricted
 5 by jurisdictional walls and parochial attitudes and too much
 6 piecemeal planning to handle emergencies at the expense
 7  of systematic, long-range development and programing
 8 of the many instruments potentially available to us. While
 9 there has been marked improvement in such things as
 10 language training at agency school's, and while university
 11 centers have made significant progress in area studies,
 12 nowhere has the United States established a training pro-
 13 gran to develop rounded strategists in the nonmilitary area
 14 or even certain vital categories of professional specialists,
 15 particularly in the area of political, ideological, psycholog-
 16 ical, and organizational operations and in certain areas of
 17 development work. Nor has the United States organized
 18 a research program which can be expected to think through
 19 the important additional range of methods and means that
 20 could be available to us in the Government and private
 21  sectors.
 22  (7) In implementing this legislation the following re-
 23 quirements for developing our national capacity for global
 24 operations in the nonmilitary area should receive special
 25  attention :

 1     1. At the upper levels of Government, the United States
 2 must have rounded strategists with intensive interdepart-
 3 mental training and experience who understand the range of
 4 instruments potentially available to us and who can or-
 5 ganize and program these instruments over long periods in
 6 an integrated, forward strategy that systematically develops
 7 and utilizes our full national capacity for the global struggle.
 8     If. Below them, Government personnel must be trained
 9 to understand and implement this integrated strategy in all
 10 of its dimensions. Through intensive training, as well as
 11 experience, we must seek the highest professional compe-
 12 tence in those areas of specialized knowledge required by
 13 our global operations. Government personnel should have
 14 an underlying level of understanding as to the nature of the
 15 global conflict, the goals of the United States, and the vari-
 16 ous possible instruments in achieving these goals to facilitate
 17 team operations. We should seek to instill a high degree
 18 of clan and dedication.
 19     111. Foreign affairs personnel at all levels must under-
 20 stand communism with special emphasis on Communist non-
 21 military conflict technique. It is not enough to have experts
 22 available for consultation.  This is basic knowledge which
 23 must be widely disseminated, if planning and implementa-

 tion are to be geared to the conflict we are in.  (The present
 ,two weeks seminar offered at the Foreign Service Institute
 is entirely too brief for even lower ranking personnel.)
 IV. The private sector must understand how it can par-
 ticipate in the global struggle in a sustained and systematic
 manner. There exists in the private sector a huge reservoir
 of talent, ingenuity, and strength which can be developed
 and brought to bear in helping to solve many of our global.
 problems. We have hardly begun to explore the range of
 possibilities.
 V. The public must have a deeper understanding of
 communism, especially Communist nonmilitary conflict tech-
 nique, and the nature of the global struggle, including the
 goals of the United States;
 (8) The hereinafter created Freedom Academy must be
 a prestige institution and every effort should be made to
 demonstrate this is a, major effort by the United States in a
 vital area.

 IN THE 'ROUSE OF REPRI SEN`rATIVES
 JANUARY 4,1965
 Mr. GC'riER lotraiuced the following bill. which was referred to the Com-
 mittee on 1'11-American  kclivities
 A BILL
 To create the Freedom Commission for the development of the
 science of counteraction to the world Communist conspiracy
 and for the training and development of leaders in a total
 political war.

 2                                tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 3                              SHORT TITLE
 4     SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the "Freedom
 5 Commission Act".
 6     CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY

 S the following findings :

 1  ing a total political war against the United States and
 2  against the peoples and governments of all other nations of
 3  the free world.
 4  (2) Unlike the free world, the Soviet Union has sys-
 5 tematically prepared for this total political war over several
 6  decades. Drawing on the experience of previous conquerors
 7 and upon their own elaborate studies and extensive pragmatic
 8 tests, the Soviet leaders have developed their conspiratorial
 9 version of political warfare into a highly effective operational
 10 science. Recognizing that political warfare is a difficult
 11 science making unusual demands on its practitioners, the
 12 Soviet Union and Communist China have established an
 13 elaborate network of training schools, within and without the
 14 free world, in which have been trained large numbers of
 15 highly skilled activists. These activists continue to receive
 16 intensive continuous training throughout their party careers.
 17     (3) In this total political war the Soviets permit no
 18 neutrals. Every- citizen, every economic, cultural, religious,
 19  or ethnic group is a target and is under some form of direct
 20 or indirect Communist attack. The battleground is every-
 21                                     where, and every citizen, knowingly or unknowingly,
 22  through action or inaction, is involved in this continuous
 23 struggle.
 24      (4) Since the end of World War IJ, the Soviets, tak-
 25                                     ing full advantage of their better preparation and often supe-

 1  rior organizational and operational know-how, have inflicted
 2  a series of political warfare defeats on the free world. The
 3  total sum of these defeats is nothing less than a disaster
 4  for the United States and the free world and the continua-
 5 tion of this political war by the Soviets confronts the United
 6 States with a grave, present, and continuing danger to its
 7  national survival.
 8     (5) In order to defeat the Soviet political warfare
 9  offensive and to preserve the integrity and independence of
 10  the nations of the free world, it is imperative-
 11          (A) that the knowledge and understanding of all
 12     the peoples of the free world concerning the true nature
 13     of the international Communist conspiracy he increased
 14     as rapidly as is practicable;
 15 (B) that private citizens not only understand the
 16     true nature of the international Communist conspiracy,
 17     but that they also know how they can participate, and
 18     do participate, in this continuous struggle in an effective,
 19     sustained, and systematic manner;
 20 (C) that Government personnel engaged in the cold
 21     war increase their knowledge of the international Com-
 22                                  munist conspiracy, develop a high espirit de corps and
 23     sense of mission and a high degree of operational know-
 24                                  how in counteracting the international Communist
