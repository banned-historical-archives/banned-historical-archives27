 PANAMA:              Delvalle, Opposition Waver
 President Delvalle reportedly is seriously considering resigning,
 and his call last night for a national dialogue and for an
 investigation into charges against Noriega probably reflect a
 last-ditch effort to bring an end to the violence
 threatened to resign following military-orchestrated vandalism
 against opposition-owned businesses on Thursday.

 section.                               failure to control
 progovernment violence, includin the recent violent demonstration
 in front of the US Embass
 The US Embassy reports the opposition is attempting to develop a
 strategy for coordinating further political protests but is plagued by
 weak leadership. Press reports indicate the general business strike
 that ended yesterday was only partially successful, although a
 peaceful demonstration on Saturday drew up to 6,000 women calling
 for Noriega's ouster. University and secondary schools meanwhile
 have been closed in an attempt to undercut student protest activity.
 Comment: Despite his personal misgivings, Delvalle has publicly
 supported Noriega in the hope of maintaining some level of civilian
 participation in the government. The recent crisis has undermined his
 credibility, however, and his family's business holdings were attacked
 last week by government and opposition demonstrators. His speech
 probably is an effort to bolster his stature, and he may become the
 regime's conduit for dialogue
 If Delvalle resigns despite military pressure to hold fast, Noriega
 probably will allow Vice President Esquivel to take office. Although
 the outspoken Esquivel is not trusted by the military, he wants to be
 president and probably would cooperate with Noriega at least initially.
 After September-when the constitution would no longer require an
 early election-the military could oust Esquivel and have a more
 acceptable interim president appointed to govern until the scheduled
 election in 1989
 The largely middle- and upper-class opposition probably will be
 cowed by the recent violent tactics of regime supporters. Opposition
 leaders are unprepared and unlikely to move beyond calls for
 peaceful protests and strike actions. Student activists, however, will
 continue to challenge the regime in the streets

 HAITI:               Crisis Deepens Despite Government Concessions
 Public outrage over the Army's handling of recent unrest has
 undercut the ruling council's attempt to calm tensions and
 x
 salvage some of its credibility through negotiations.                 25X1
 t
 The independent electoral commission announced on9
 urdayit was
 indefinitely suspending talks-aimed at putting the election process
 back on track-with the military-dominated council, according to
 press reports. The commission, which won a significant concession     25X1
 from the council last week-restoring its authority to oversee
 elections-cited alleged military brutality against civilians as the
 reason for its action. The US Embassy reports the commission will
 meet today to decide whether regime promises to prevent further
 incidents are sufficient to resume talks. US Embassy officers in Port-
 au-Prince say at least 20 people have been killed and 100 injured in
 recent unrest. Although opposition groups over the weekend called
 for a respite from protests, many of them plan to renew strike activity
 today to force the resignations of President Namphy and General
 Regala from the council.                                             25X1
 The council, for its part, has vowed to remain in power until the
 scheduled transition to civilian rule next February, according to press
 reports. In addition, senior Army officers issued a communique
 reaffirming their support for the council. In another concession to the
 opposition, the council announced Saturday it would reinstate the
 leftist union if the group replaced its leadership. Some political
 leaders reportedly have said, however the aovernment has no ri ht to
 attach conditions to lifting the ban.

 CHINA:               Reformers Launch Media Offensive
 Reformists in the Chinese leadership have orchestrated a
 propaganda barrage in favor of economic and political reform
 and away from the six-month-old campaign against "bourgeois
 liberalism," but they may not have regained enough initiative to
 dominate the party congress in October.
 ( 62t l   Li
 The reformists' latest salvo is an editorial in the People's Daily Iee4-
 oc ajr-that authoritatively places controversial political reforms
 high on the agenda for the congress. The current round of
 precongress jockeying in the leadership began in earnest in early
 May, according t                          media, when Acting
 Party General Secretary Zhao, prompted by Deng Xiaoping, gave a
 speech to senior propaganda officials criticizing several party
 ideologues by name for "leftist deviations" and defending moderates
 recently under attack                                              25X1
 Comment: Deng and Zhao want to protect economic reforms that
 have come under attack. In recent public statements they have
 argued that economic reform will fail without "political structural
 reforms" to distance the party from routine government and state
 enterprise operations
 Key personnel decisions-including the choice of a new central
 committee and a Politburo standing committee-and a manifesto on
 political and economic reforms will be the focus of meetings this
 month and next preparing for the congress. Maneuvering will
 continue as Deng, Zhao, and their allies try to capitalize on economic
 successes the reforms have brought, while their opponents call for
 strict adherence to Communist dogma and harp on the ideological,
 social, and economic problems created by reform
 Although Deng's intervention puts orthodox officials on the defensive,
 animated political horsetrading almost certainly will continue right up
 to the congress.

 USSR-PERSIAN GULF: Soviet Government Statement
 A statement issued .F     cites the "drastic" increase in warships
 from nonregional countries as raising tensions in the Persian Gulf and
 calls for their withdrawal. It notes the USSR's proximity to the conflict
 and argues that Soviet warships are escorting Soviet merchant ships
 at the request of the Gulf states. The statement also says Iran and
 Iraq should refrain from actions that threaten international shipping. It
 notes the need for reducing tensions and says the USSR supports UN
 efforts toward a settlement. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ramadan
 was in Moscow on fey and spoke with President Gromyko and
 Premier Ryzhkov.~ L                                      25X1
 Comment: The statement is probably a response to the recent visit to
 Moscow by the US Ambassador to the UN and reflects Soviet
 concern over the US naval presence as well as the possible success of
 US diplomatic efforts in ending the war. It tries to legitimize the
 USSR's small naval presence in the Gulf and portray the approach as
 balanced and nonconfrontational. The call to end the attacks on
 shipping is designed to please Iran, which has recently been trying to
 separate the ground war from tensions in the Gulf. The high-level
 treatment of Ramadan, however, is aimed at preserving a balance in
 Moscow's policy toward both sides.

 In intense fighting over the past month-the heaviest this year-

 problems. The guerrillas' morale is high; they believe they have
 inflicted serious losses on Soviet and regime forces. This

 shortages
 The chief effect of the fighting has been to improve insurgent morale.
 The insurgents' perception that they fought Soviet forces to a
 standstill in relatively large-scale conventional combat contrasts
 sharply with their failure to hold the logistic base at Zhawar Killi last
 spring. Improved air defenses, particularly Stinger missiles, have
 given the insurgents confidence to continue fighting despite extensive
 Soviet-Afghan air support. Large stocks of arms and ammunition-
 the result of a much-improved logistic situation-and the proximity of
 the fighting to resupply centers in Pakistan allowed resistance groups
 to counter two simultaneous, monthlong offensives with no reported
 The decision by the resistance to stand and fight in large units
 entailed costs, however. Several prominent insurgent commanders

 Heavy) casualties in the already dangerously understrength Afghan
 armyiave,cuced the regime to resort again to press gangs.
 Although casualties among insurgents were heavy in the two
 operations, the regime's military position almost certainly will not
 improve, and heavy fighting will probably continue into the summer.
 The guerrillas have already resumed their siege of Ali Kheyl less than
 a week after the major Soviet operation there ended. The resistance
 will continue to bring in supplies and may try to mount more
 ambitious operations. Insurgent groups probably will be increasingly
 inclined to stand and fight when their bases are attacked, and this
 action will resu in heavy fighting and more casualties.

 SPAIN-PORTUGAL:      Expanding Arms Sales to Iran
 Portugal has displaced Spain as Iran's largest Western arms
 supplier over the past two years with deliveries totaling
 $400 million. Only China and North Korea supply more arms to
 Iran
 Since 1983 Portugal has delivered ammunition, rifles, mortars,
 machineguns, recoilless rifles, and explosives to Iran, insisting that
 the weapons have no impact on the Iran-Iraq war. Portuguese officials
 claim they are acting out of economic necessity and accept with little
 question exporters' pro forma end-use declarations. Lisbon also
 allows foreign manufacturers to transship arms through Portuguese
 ports if Portuguese materials are also purchased.
 Iran is a lucrative and insatiable market for arms, and Spain and
 Portugal need the export earnings. Moreover, the Spanish and
 Portuguese defense industries want to expand overseas markets but
 have trouble competing in the West. Their technologically
 uncomplicated weapons, however, are precisely what Iran needs.

 Damascus is counting on using revenues from the infant oil and gas

 Tricentrol Oil, a British firm, recently signed a contract for oil

 among those currently involved in talks. The US Embassy in

 Oil from the newly discovered deposits is light and low in sulfur, well
 suited for blending with the heavy crude from Syria's older fields-
 which is otherwise unusable. So far, Syria has been using all its new
 output for domestic consumption and has been saving hard currency
 by paying the costs and profits of its foreign partners primarily with
 shipments of heavy Syrian crude sold on their behalf. If development
 goes well and foreign investment is high, Syria could become self-
 sufficient and begin exporting higher quality oil as early as 1990.

 take a much more extensive campaign for Harare to reconsider its
 commitment to protect the Beira transportation corridor and the

 Zimbabwe has experienced an apparently unrelated surge of rural
 unrest. The US Embassy reports dissidents active since 1982 now
 operate over a broad stretch of territory between Gweru and
 Bulawayo in southcentral Zimbabwe and are targeting white farmers
 and tourists in particular. The government probably fears the
 dissidents could attract renewed South African support and shake the
 confidence of the country's 5,000 white commercial farmers, who are
 in the past two years to promote unity
 The government has charged-probably with little basis-that
 opposition leader Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union
