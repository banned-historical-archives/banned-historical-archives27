SECTION II. DEVELOPMENTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS 
reggesamatlazianmegja2ma. An informal conference, called by 
Indials Prime Minister Nehrul met in New Delhi 28 Feb. to discuss the 
deteriorating situation in Burma. Attending are representatives from 
India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand, as yell as George 
Bottomley, British Secretary for Overseas Trade and Malcolm MacDonald, 
British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. The meeting will be 
priearily concerned with ways of helping Burma out of its severe politica/ 
anf economic troubles, a matter of concern to other Asian nations becaus 
of tneir need for Burma's surplus rice crop, 
The Burmese Government, approaching virtual bankruptcy, recently re-
quested financial assistance from the UK. After consultation with other 
Commonwealth nations in the area, the UK persuaded Nehru to call the con-
ference as of mutual interest to all. Considering the political and 
economic instability of Burma; it is unlikely that anything but short-
term financial assistance will be extended, primarily to facilitate the 
rice export program. Since a loan without assurances of communal peace 
would be almost useless, Commonwealth efforts to solve the Karen-Burman 
conflict probably will be forthcoming as well. Nehru has indicated his 
personal willingness to mediate the conflict. Any attempt at mediation, 
however, Will have to overrtome the conviction on the part of both Burmans 
and Karens that each will be victorious, 
. JAPAN 
Mass DismissaLProgram. A program of mass dismissals of employees pro-
posed under the Japanese Government's economic stabilization program 
should increase labor unrest and permit the Japan Communist Party to 
strengthen its influence, 
The program proposes that: non-operating Government staffs be cut by 
one-third and operating personnel of government monopolies be cut by ane-
fifth. Teachers, policemen, court and prison attendants are to be exemp-
ted, Recognizing a coming unemployment problem aggravated by these 
dismissals, the Japanese Government has appropriated 90 billion yen for 
public works to absorb these =employed and is attempting to increase 
unemployment benefits, The Government estimates unemployment at 1,800,000 
in the coming fiscal year. 
Under Commueist guidance, Japanese labor probably will oppose the mass 
dismissals strongly. A mass meeting of. workers of the TaNyo Shibaura 
Electric Company, a center of labor conflict, may spread into a "March

SOAP and the Japanese Government face a difficult problem in counter-
acting Communist propaganda arising from the program and combating possible 
crippling strikes. Revision of basic labor laws to protect the national 
interest and to ensure economic recovery and modification of harsher points 
of the National Public Service Law, may have some restraining influence on 
labor's reaction to the mass dismissals,

, minate racial clauses in the US immigration Law of 1924, has recently 
passed the Neese judiciary Committee. The exclusion of Orientals by 
present immigration regulations hee been a source of friction and a con-
stant irritant to Asiatic pride over the last quarter century and uas 
particularly galling to the Japanese who considered themselves one of 
the world's leading nations, 
Top Japanese Government officials and editors are hailing the Judd 
Bill and express hope for its speedy passage by Congress. Dhile the bill

Rhee has ousted Cho Pong An as Minister of Agriculture in an attempt to 
make Cho the scapegoat for the Government's failure to collect more than 
50% of the rice quota. Replacement of Cho by Lee Chong Hyun? however, 
will not resolve the problem of the falling rice collection. 
Cho's inefficient administration as well as his possibly deliberate 
efforts to sabotage rice collections are pertia1Ty responsible for the 
Government's failure to meet the quota. The basic responsibility, hoe-
ever, rests in the weakness of the National Assembly's rice collection 
7rnr. Even an efficient administrator could probabXy net have collee,:4 
appreciably more rice under the existing regulations. 
Cho is a former Communist, originanyappointed because Rhee wished 
to give his administration an appearance of wide representation. Cho 
filled his Ministry with leftist follorers. It is probable that Rhee 
used the excuse of rice quota failure to rid his Cabinet of a man who 
was neither a personal friend or supporter and whose political following 
is inadequate to exert significant pressure on the Government. 
CHINA 
Acting President LPs position improves. LI Tsung-jen appears to 
have won the first round in his contest with CHIANG Kai-shek for control 
of the National Government. His position has been considerably strength-
ened by Chinese Communist leaders MAO Tse-tung and CHOU En-lai's grant-
ing of an interview to the peace mission headed by W.W. YEN. According 
to members of the mission, the Communist leaders have agreed in principle 
to the reopening of certain lines of communication between Communist and 
Nationalist China. Meanwhile, a Communist broadcast indicated that peace 
negotiations will begin shortly. LPs exhaustive efforts to seek peace 
with the Communists have won him a growing popular support. 
Within Nationalist ranks, LI showed political astuteness on his 
recent trip to Canton when he successf.-lly maneuvered SUN Po intoreturning 
to Nanking for the opening of the Legislative Yuan. SUN who has continually 
refused to bring the Cabinet back to Nanking, reportedly returned on 
Generalissimo CHIANG's orders indicating CHIANG's reeognition of LPs 
increased influence. The return to Nanking may additionally indicate an 
attempt to check any efforts by the Legislative Yuan to oust SUN Fo 
as Premier. 
La has also been successful to some extent in winning certain key 
figures to his cause, notably former Defence Minister NO Ying-chin. 
However, LI has yet to gain the allegiance of the potentially powerful 
Kwangtung group, including (.HANG Fa-kwei, SSUEH Yueh and WU Te-chen and

may find his authority challenged in Canton by a competing group of 
Legielative Yuan members under the Yuan's Vice President LIU Chien-chun, 
if a quorum can be mustered. La's most serious weakness, however, continues 
to be his lack of financial resources. LI's Peiping peace mission repert-
edly has emphasized to the Communists the precarious currency position of 
the Nationalists as one strong argument for an early peace. CHIANG and 
his cohorts still control the bulk of the nation's monetary reserves 
and banking facilities, and for this reason LI may prefer to continue to 
seek a compromise with CHIANG?8 forces rather than break with them completely* 
Communists emphasize industrial production. North Shensi radio '-at "A" 
ves.k reported popular acclaim -for the Chinese Communist Party's econcflec 
achievements. With the expansion of their territory to include more and 
more cities, the Communists have beco,no increasingly aware of the economic 
importanoe of industrial and commercial groups. During the past year, 
Communist pronouncements have emphasized industrial production in addition 
to the traditional agricultural program. On 21 February, the Communist 
radio announced that "The Northeast State-owned Enterprises Provisional 
Wartime Labor Insurance Act" was passed in January by the Manchurian 
Democratic Government, and will go into effect on 1 April, Underthis 
Act, state-owned enterprises are to provide their workers with medical and 
funeral benefits as well as old age and disability pensions, "Other 
liberated areas are closely studying this first labor insurance act for 
experience in applying it to their own areas," the broadcast continued, 
Pragmatic Communist policy-makers have compromised with theory and 
modified their policies in order to gain the support of key economic groups. 
In a speech on 25 December 19479 MAO Tse-tung said: "Owing to the back-
wardness of China's economy, it will still be necessary to permit the 
existence of the capitalist economy for a long time." According to a 3 
August 1948 New China News Agency editorial, "...all law-abiding industrial-
ists and commercial businessmen-..should be protected from infringement,. 
Industrial production should be regarded as of equal importance to or 
more important than agricultural production." Now that the Communists 
are faced with the problem of maintaining production in such major in-
dustrial centers as Mukeen and Tientsin, they will probably modify their 
policies even farther, perhaps to the extent of soliciting the cooperation 
of foreigners. The Communist Tax Bureau in Muisden? eager for the reopen-
ing of the BAT cigarette factory--a source or tax revenue- has reportedly 
invited BAT officials to return to Mukden and has offered financial 
assistance if needed? 
Nationalists announce another new financiaLEEmam. The financial 
program for Nationalist China announced 24 February, will attempt to 
maintain Nationalist purchasing power for at least a few more months. 
The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, in recognition of the loss 
of tax receipts from provinces, feel that in the absence of substantial

Other features of the pro7cram are chiefly relaxation of import-export con-
trols and approval of free circulation of gold and silver. The United 
States is being strongly pressed for a silver loan, which in a few months' 
time probably would be the only asset available to the Nationalists.

hours of 25 February, the light cruiser Chungking--largest combat vessel 
in the Chinese Navy and formerly HMS Aurora?steamed out of its Shanghai 
enohorage with destination unknown. The Chungking departed with a full 
lead of fuel, presumably a full load of ammunition and complete crew com-
plement of 650-750 officers and men. On 28 February, the Chinese Air 
Force reported that the Chungking had been located in the Communist port 
of Chefoo on the Shantung penninsula. The defection of the -Chungking 
marks the third such action in a period of less than three weeks: On 
13 February the destroyer-escort Huang An left her berth at Tsingtao in 
the same manner as the Chungking; the ice-breaker Chang Pai, reported lost 
at sea on 7 January, was spotted intact by the CAP in Chefoo harbor 
about the middle of February? 
INDOCHINA 
French Assemblx to consider Governmentmlia0 Despite the French 
Government's desire to avoia assembly discussion of a formal Franco-Viet-
nameso treaty before Bao Dai's return to Indochina, the Indochinese ques-
tion has been placed on the National Assembly agenda for 11 March, when 
a full debate may be expected. According to an official of the French Gver-
seas Ministry, a law will be introduced authorizing formation of u Cochin 
china Territorial 4ssemb14. which will be empowered to take action on unifi-
cation with Tonkin and.Annam. Favorable consideration in this body may be 
expected since an agreement, promising considerable autonomy to Cochinchina, 
within_ the Vietnam, has apparently already been mac:hod in France? 
Reportedly included in the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement are independence 
and unity for Vietnam within the French Union, diplomatic rights subject to 
the approval of the President of the French Union, a national army in exchange 
for strategic bases for France, and the linking of the piastre to the franc? 
In Indochina, High Commissioner Finnen appears cautiously optimistic. 
and states that, although Bao Dal is returning to a difficult situation, he 
has a good chance to succeed. This may be based upon the fact that Bee Dai 
is reported to be considering negotiations for a truce with the resistance 
forces, a move which will be approved by the Nigh Commissioner so lonn as

his contacts are limited to the non.4Communist nationalist leaders within 
the To Chi ?Ninh group. 
State Derartment reiterates stand on Bao Dal plan, The NS Department 
of State has informed Ambassador affery in Paris that it is not prepared 
to Rive public supnort to any arrangement for Indochina unless the plan in-
cludes sufficient means to insure its success or until the Bao Dai regime 
itself achieves the surport of an appreciable portion of the population. 
Decisive action on the unification of Cochinchina with Tonkin and Annam is 
considered essential before Pao Dai can rally to his cause the natioealists 
who are presently following Ho Chi "inh. It was emphasized that any re-
consideration of ITS policy toward RCA aid for Indochina must await develop-
ments.

 coup d'etat changes. Although the "A" 
armed Clash in Bangkok last weekend--the ol000lest same 1933?was officially 
termed the result of an Arly.;Navy "misunderstanding", there is little doubt 
that ex-premier Pridi attempted a coup d'etat with Navy assistance. Marine 
units, in cooperation with Pridils Free Thai followers, seized the govern-
ment radio station and the Royal Palace on Saturday night and then deployed 
through other sections of Bangkok. Shortly thereafter the radio broadcast 
a proclamation, in the King's name, dismissing the Phibul Government and 
appointing pro-Prldi men to the Cabinet. The proclamation also ordered 
re-establishment of the original 1933 constitution which had stripped the 
monarchy of its absolute rovers. 
Desnite deployment of Marine ferces? loyal government units retained 
control of the center of Bangkok. By Sunday afternoon, Phibul's forces had 
regained control of the situation, recaptured the radio station and announced 
that an agreement had been concluded to establish a joint Army-Navy committee 
"to investigate the incident." 
The coup d'etat misfired because certain Army elements and the entire 
Navy failed to supeort the Marines effectively and the rhibul Government 
apparently was aware of the plot. It is believed that the Navy C-in-C, 
although directing the armed insurrection at first, later lost heart and 
withdrew Navy support from the Marine units. 
Although the events over the weekend represent an unsuccessful effort 
to oust the Phibul regime, it is possible that some sort of a political

certainly possible that the insurrection was basically an effort to rid the 
Government of the oblectionable but powerful Army figures who control the 
Phibul regime. The Navy is believed to want the dismissal of these leaders 
as well as changes in the Cabinet and non-interference from the Arm. If 
the Navy, which is loyal to Pridi, had succeeded in its objectives, it is 
nrobable that supporters of Pridi would be included in a reorganized govern-
ment. Further, should the undesirable meebers of the Phibul regime be 
dismissed, the high degree of dissatisfaction within the armed forces would 
be greatly alleviated and a more stable situation in Siam wild ensue.

Re ublicans resect latest Dutchtalant As expected, Indonesian 'Eepub-
lican leaders have announced their rejection of the Dutch proposal to settle 
the Indonesian stalemate by means of a roundtable conference at The lague., 
It is believed that the rejection stemmed primarily from the Dutch refusal 
to restore the Republicans to a position of recognized governmental authority 
at their former eanital, Jogjakarta., The UN Commission for Indonesia can 
be exneeted to exert pressure to effect a compromise on this Point,

split over a rump Senate vote ousting party leader Jose Avelino as Senate 
President, shows signs of rallying under President ouirino. Avelino and 
a few of his followers have been temporarily purged from the party and, 
to date, he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to strike back at his 
political enemies. 
In the Senate, a special committee is daily conducting hearings on 
charges of graft and corruption lodged against Avelino. Two of his 
supporters, Senators Lopes and !!agalonal have met with President luirino 
and, according to reports, may be wmn over to the luirino groure, The 
Senate Electoral Tribunal is currently examining protests made 13 months 
ago by the 'Inority Party against the election of three other Avelino 
supporters. It is possible that the graft charges will cause the defection 
of a considerable number of other followers to the nuirino camp, thus further 
undermining Avelinos political position,

numerous islands is not universally recognized. In an article published 
in an Obscure Spanish periodical last fail, one Emilio Pastor y Santos, 
unofficially associated with the Philippine Legation at Madrid, wrote he 
had "discovered" that under the Treaty of 1 July 1899, by which Spain 
ceded her possessions in Meronesia to Germany, certain rights were re-
served and certain islands omitted from the cessioh. The article es-
caped general notice until it was condensed and reprinted in a Uadrid 
daily some months later,: 
In January it was announced that the Spanish Foreign Master had 
discussed the subject in a cabinet meeting. A subsequent press release 
of the Foreign Office asserted, "These rights subsist fully and since 
these territories are under trusteeship at the present moment, it is 
fitting to recall that they are Spanish possessions, without prejudicing 
the right to bring up the snbject again as the national interest may demand, 
when this question is being decided internationally." 
Sr. Pastor, in his original article, set forth the strategic value 
to Spain of refueling stations among the Micronesian islands, which he 
described "as the keys to the sea lanes of ha]! the world." He also 
suggested that the acquisition of such naval stations would promote closer 
Spanish relations with the Philippines and foresaw the island installation 
of a radio transmitter to broadcast Spanish programs in the Far East. He 
may have been slightly more realistic when he mentioned Spanish claims as 
assets in future diplomatic bargaining. Since Spain, however, did not press 
these claims during the thirty years of Japanese occupation, it is doubtful 
that a legal case exiats.
