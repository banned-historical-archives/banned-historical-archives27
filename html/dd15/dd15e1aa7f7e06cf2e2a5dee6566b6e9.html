DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
USSR-UN:Gpviet UN delegate Zorin's negative stand in 
his recent private exchange with Ambassador Wadsworth 
provides further evidence that the USSR is not interested in 
resuming disarmament negotiations, at least not until after 
a new United States administration is installed. Moscow's 
present objective is to induce the uncommitted nations to 
bring pressure on the West to accept Soviet disarmament 
proposals as the basis for negotiations. Efforts by neutral-
ist delegations, led by India, to work out a compromise UN 
!resolution have created a situation which makes it difficult 
and embarrassing at this stage for the bloc delegates to car-
ry out Khrushchev's threat to walk out of the UN disarmament 
debate if Soviet proposals are not accepted as the basis for 
discussion 
Soviet official has indicated to a member of the US 
delegation in New York that the bloc will seek to amend the 
draft resolution being circulated by India to include provi-
sions for establishing a new 15-nation committee and spe-
cific directives for the committee to work out a treaty on 
complete and general disarmament. He warned that if these 
amendments are not accepted, the bloc will withdraw from 
the debate:23 
(Page 1) 
Berlin: The East Germans are attempting to assert a 
right to determine arbitrarily what types of materials can 
be shipped from West Berlin, and thereby indirectly claim-
ing the right to decide what exports can be manufactured in 
West Berlin without violation of four-power agreements pro-
hibiting military production in the city. The East Germans 
have instituted a campaign of harassment against trucks en 
route from West Berlin to West Germany with electrical and 
electronic equipment--one of West Berlin's most important

exports--claiming that this is "war material." At least 
four trucks have recently been detained at the Babelsberg 
checkpoint outside West Berlin; the cargoes of two were 
confiscated and one other was allowed to proceed only af-
ter payment of a fine. East German authorities subjected 
officials of one firm to long interrogations and demanded 
to inspect the records of the firrp's shipments over the past 
six months. 
Communist China - Algeria: jiie Chifiege- troth-hi-blasts 
have been discussing with UAR authorities arrangements 
for Chinese military aid to the Algerian rebels to pass 
through UAR territory, 
Cairo is not 
entirely pleased over the prospect of increased Chinese in-
fluence among the Algerian rebels, but feels compelled to 
cooperate because of its own support for them. Peiping is 
eager to assist Algerian rebel efforts to obtain international 
support and reportedly promised rebel Premier Ferhat Abbas, 
during his visit to China last month, "total and unconditional 
aid?" (Page 2)

South Vietnam: A series of recent attacks by Commu-
nist guerrillas on government installations in the central 
highlands region of South Vietnam indicate that the guerril-
las now are striking in considerable force in this previously (1-cr-v- C 
quiescent area. Sketchy reports suggest that the strikes were 
made by bands of up to 300 mountain tribesmen from the Lao-
tian border area under cadres infiltrated into South Vietnam 
through Laos from Communist North Vietnam. The spread 
of guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam, which was sharply in-
tensified earlier this year in the southern delta provinces, 
will add to the rnility and political pressures on the Diem 
government. L (Page 4) (Map)

in Moscow also be accredited to Ulan Bator. Mongolia has 
tried hard in recent years to erase the impression that it is 
nothing more than a Soviet colony, and has been particularly 
anxious to gain foreign recognition. The only other free 
world countries now recognizing Mongolia are Burma, Guinea, 
India, and Indonesia. (Page 5) 
Laos: Premier Souvanna is reported to have taken fresh 
steps to induce Prince Souphannouvong, leader of the Neo Lao

for peace talks. This action may have been prompted by the 
recently formed Committee for Neutrality and National Unity,

that as of 29 October the Soviet leadership had not decided

all bloc parties had been invited to send representatives to 
the anniversary celebrations. The Chinese have not vpt

Soviet Disarmament Tactics 
I oviet UN Delegate Zorin's negative stand in his private 
exchange with Ambassador Wadsworth on 1 November pro-
vides further evidence that the USSR is not interested in re-
suming disarmament negotiations, at least not until after the 
new United States administration is installed, and that Mos-
cow's present objective is to induce the uncommitted nations 
to press the West to accept Soviet disarmament proposals as 
the basis for discussions. Zorin termed Wadsworth's state-
ment on American policy "unfortunate and discouraging" and 
insisted that the USSR's plan for complete and general dis-
armament offered the only way to solve real problems. He 
said the US proposal to terminate the production of nuclear 
weapons would only create false illusions and could not lead 
to progress. t 
,Efforts by Afro-Asian neutralist delegations, led by India, 
to work out a compromise disarmament resolution have cre-
ated a situation which makes it difficult and embarrassing at 
this stage for bloc delegations to carry out Khrushchev's threat 
to walk out of the UN disarmament debate if the Soviet position 
is not accepted as the basis for discussion. 
A member of the Soviet UN delegation has indicated pri-
vately that the Indian draft resolution offers the only possible 
hope for agreement and that the bloc will seek to amend it to 
include provisions for establishing a 15-nation committee and 
specific directives for the committee to work out a treaty on 
complete and general disarmament. He warned that if these 
amendments are not accepted, or if the Indian resolution with 
Soviet amendments fails, the bloc will withdraw from the debate 
and wait for a special session of the General Assembly to re-
consider disarmament next spring. In a recent talk with Am-
bassador Thompson, First Deputy Premier Kosygin insisted 
that this proposal for a special session was not a propaganda 
maneuver but  a serious bid to "give a push" to disarmament 
negotiations.

Peiping Exploi Possibilities of Extending MI, wary Aid  
To Algerian Rebels  
Communist China has been discussing with the UAR means 
,of sending military assistance to the Algerian rebels across  
UAR territory, 
 the UAR, although disturbed over the 
prospect of increased Chinese influence among the rebels, 
feels compelled to cooperate because of its own support for 
ithe AlgeriansjEU_AR fears are shared by the Moroccan and 
!Tunisian governments,which, according to officials of these 
governments, have been asked to facilitate passage of materiel 
and some personnel. 
oderate rebel Premier Abbas, although reported personally 
 reluctant to accept Communist aid, attended Peiping's National 
Day celebrations last month to impress the West that the rebels 
were determined to take aid from any source. The Algerians now 
seem firmly committed to accept Communist assistance, which 
Abbas claims "can significantly alter the context" of the struggle. 
The Chinese desire to expand their influence in the rebel move-
ment, and Mao Tse-tung is said to have promised Abbas "total 
and unconditional" aid. 
the USSR was sending military assistance to the reb-
els through gypt across Libya. This statement followed the 
USSR's recent shift from a cautious attitude toward the Algerian 
rebellion to a pro-insurgent position involving de facto recogni-
tion and statements by Khrushchev promising "all possible, as--
sistance." 
� Previous assistance to the Algerian rebels from Communist 
bloc countries has apparently been limited to $5,000,000 worth of 
assistance from Communist China in January 1959 in the form of 
funds and possibly small amounts of military equipment and an 
undetermined amount of aid from Czechoslovakia in the form of 
World War II surplus arms. In addition, the USSR and East Euro-
pean countries have supplied rebel refugees in Morocco and Tunisia 
with relief supplies, given scholarships to Algerian students, and 
provided hospitalization for small numbers of wounded rebel per-
sonnel.

Nehru Rejects U Nuts Offer to Help Resolve Sino-
Indian Dispute  
Prime Minister Nehru reportedly has rejected an offer 
by Burmese Premier U Nu to assist in bringing about a solu-
tion of India's border dispute with Communist China. The 
Indian leader, however, welcomed Nu's planned visit to New 
Delhi on 11 November. Nehru, in explaining his action, min-
imized the possibility of an early settlement of the Sino-Indian 
border question, stressing that the problem is not as simple 
as Rangoon's dispute with Peiping was and emphasizing that 
Indian public opinion will not support any territorial conces-
sions to China. He observed that he does not expect the issue 
to be resolved during his lifetime. 
Nuis offer of assistance is said to have been contained in 
a letter to Nehru written shortly after the Burmese premier 
had returned from a trip to Peiping where he signed an agree-
ment resolving the long-standing Sino-Burmese border dispute. 
He attributed to Chou En-lai a statement of China's desire to 
see the dispute with India settled. Peiping probably hopes that 
U Nufs satisfaction with the Sino-Burmese compromise will 
make him an effective advocate of some compromise solution 
of the disputed Sino-Indian border area. 
Nehru's private remarks to Nu are consistent with recent 
public statements designed to prepare Indian public opinion for 
a long struggle. Indian and Chinese border experts will arrive 
in Rangoon during the next few days for their third and final 
round of meetings to write their report detailing each other's 
border claims and documentation. Little is expected to come 
of these sessions, and it is doubtful that either side will press 
for higher level discussions before early 1961.

Communist Guerrillas Active in Central Highlands of 
South-Vietnam  
Recent guerrilla attacks on South Vietnamese government 
installations in the highlands of central Vietnam indicate that 
the Communists now are striking in a considerable force in 
this region, which previously has been relatively secure. Al-
though details are sketchy, a number of attacks apparently were 
made between 20 and 25 October against military outposts and 
road construction camps in Kontum and Pleiku provinces near 
the Laotian border, with diversionary actions occurring in 
Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces to the east. The guerril-
las, who were driven off by local militias reinforced by reg-
ular army and paratroop battalions, reportedly were operating 
in bands of up to 300, consisting chiefly of mountain tribesmen 
from the border region. They are believed to have operated 
under cadres infiltrated through Laos from North Vietnam. 
There is no evidence, however, to substantiate initial re-
ports from some South Vietnamese officials that the attacks 
were a large-scale incursion by regular North Vietnamese 
forces crossing Laos. The Diem government may have exag-
gerated evidence of North Vietnamese involvement in the hope 
of charging Hanoi with violations of the1954 truce agreement 
and justifying its position that military needs to meet the Com-
munist guerrilla threat require the postponement of political 
and social reforms. The North Vietnamese have clearly shown 
in the past few months that they intend to increase both violence 
and political agitation in the South. Hanoi, however, has denied 
Saigon's claim that North Vietnamese troops entered the South 
from Laos, charging that this "Western fabrication" was in-
tended as an excuse for South Vietnamese intervention in Laos. 
The spread of guerrilla activity to central Vietnam places 
an increasing burden on local security forces as well as on the 
army, which has over the past year been partially diverted 
from border defense to meet the stepped-up Communist war-
fare in the southern delta provinces near Saigon. Deteriorating 
security may also be taken by Diem as evidence of the need for 
maintaining authoritarian control, thus adding to growing dis-
satisfaction with his regime.

'1001 None 
Cambodia to Recognize Mongolia 
Prince Sihanouk, Cambodian chief of state who is visit-
ing Ulan Bator from 5 to 8 December, has instructed his 
ent to recognize the Mongolian Peonle 
Sihanouk desires that the Mongolian Government be informed 
of the recognition before his arrival there en route from Mos-
cow to Peiping. He has proposed that either the Cambodian 
ambassador in Peiping or the ambassador in Moscow be ac-
credited to Ulan Bator but has stated that he would prefer the 
Moscow ambassador, Khim Tit, who is concurrently the Cam-
bodian minister, to Poland. 
From the Cambodian point of view, recognition of Mongolia 
at this time is merely a housekeeping detail intended to clarify 
relations prior to Sihanouk's visit. At this time Phnom Penh 
exchanges diplomatic representatives with four bloc countries--
the Soviet Union, Communist China, Czechoslovakia, and Po-
land. 
Cambodia will become the fifth free-world nation to recog-
nize Mongolia, joining India, Indonesia, Burma, and Guinea. 
Mongolia was virtually a Soviet colony during Stalin's lifetime, 
but in recent years has moved toward greater independence in 
bloc and world affairs. The Mongolians have been particularly 
anxious to acquire diplomatic recognition from non-Communist 
countries as a status symbol of independence. Like the other 
Asian satellites and Communist China, the Mongolians are con-
centrating their effort on the new African republics and the 
Asian neutrals who might be expected to support a bid for mem-
bership in the United Nations. Cuba, which has recognized all 
the Asian Communist regimes except Mongolia, probably will 
add Ulan Bator to its list in the not-too-distant future.
