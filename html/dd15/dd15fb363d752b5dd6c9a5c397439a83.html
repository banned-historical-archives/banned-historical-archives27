 CLASS #11 RUNS IN TWO SECTIONS
 Supervisors' registration of per-
 sonnel for the January Writing Work-
 shop, course 1-6 in your office copy
 of  the  OTR Catalog,  was more than
 double  the  enrollment  limit.   It
 proved feasible,  in this  instance,
 to schedule  2 sections of the class
 taughtby             , Chief InstX1 A9a
 tor,  an     s  associate,   Charles
 25X1A9a
 Personnel interested in attending
 future Writing Workshops are advised
 to  register  as  far  in advance as
 possible.   Usually  limitations  of
 space and in the number of available
 instructors make   it  impossible to
 schedule more than one section.  The
 next course is scheduled to begin 25
 February.

 READING IMPROVEMENT CLASSES
 WILL SAVE SSTrJDENTS' TRAVEL TINE
 Without decreasing the total number
 of hours spent in the classroom, the
 duration of  the Reading Improvement
 class  scheduled  to begin  l' Anr
 1957 will 'be shortened from 7 weeks
 to 3 1/2 weeks; it will end o=L,   jgyr

 As a trial, the course will be con-.
 ducted in 18 two-hour sessions rather
 than the 35 one-hour sessions usually
 offered.  This training intensifica-
 tion will save each student who comes
 by shuttle to  Alcott Hall  about 1.7
 hours  of the time  now required  to
 attend the course.
 Another Reading Improvement; Class
 will begin 15 May  1957   and  end 7
 June.   It will also  consist  of 18
 two-hour sessions.
 The :15 April  and  15 May   classes
 will be  retested  two months  after
 the end  of each course,  and  their
 long-term  skill improvement will be
 compared with the improvement show n
 by classes that completed the train-
 ing on a              7.-week,  one  hour  a day,
 schedule.
 Until the  retest results    for the
 two  experimental classes  are  ana-

 TAILORED COURSE FOR OO/CONTACTS
 SCHEDULED FOR 7TH PRESENTATION
 The seventh class  of the 2L C RE-
 FRESHER,  course I-11 in your office
 copy of the OTR Catalog began 4 Feb..
 ruary.   This  course,  for  contact
 specialists,  exemplifies  a type of
 training tailored  specifically  tii
 the needs of a requesting component.
 The  DO/C Refresher  was organized
 by OTR in 1955,  at the request  o:P
 00/Contact Division to serve as their
 internal training program.  The ob.-
 jective of the course,                                                                       attended  b:r
 field personnel brought to Headqu ar.-
 ters every two years for 10 days, in
 to familiarize them with the current
 organization and  mission of the In..
 telligence       Communit   and the rela..
 tionship of the  OO Contact Division
 to them.        Field  personnel  are
 given  an opportunity  to meet    with
 users of their reports and to discuses
 mutual  problems   in production and
 collection  requirements.   A review
 of the world situation is  given by
 OCI area specialists, and  tours of
 Headquarters  installations  are ar..
 ranged.
 All 00/C field personnel    have at...
 tended  the        course within the last;
 two years, and the curriculum now it
 being revised  by  00/0 and Intelli-
 gence School representatives                                                                      on the
 basis of 00/0 needs, critiques from
 previous classes,  and  Field office
 requirements.
 The revised curriculum will include
 a review of basic methodology, group
 discussions of field collection prob..
 lems  led  by specialists from Field
 offices, and visits to Headquarters
 branches with which contact special..
 lets deal.

 SPECIAL CABLE REFRESHER TRAINING
 GIVEN OVER 70 DD/S, DD/P PERSONNEL
 SPECIAL IBM EXECUTIVE TYPEWRITER
 CLINIC DRAWS AGENCY INTEREST
 Special  cable  refresher training            Because  of the substantial demand
 was given,  during the fall of  1956           evidenced throughout the Agency, the
 and in January. 1957, to secretaries           IBM Executive Typewriter Clinic,ori-
 and               stenographers  of the Office of           g'na  y a one-day program  scheduled

 istrative Training/TR.                           Forty-nine   individuals  attended
 These    special  presentations  are
 oriented  to problems unique to the
 component requesting the instruction.
 For instance, components of DD/I and
 DD/S  prepare  dispatches  going  to
 area divisions of DD/P.  Format, and
 other detail, must be in accord with
 regulations not available to non
 components; also, each area division
 has developed variations peculiarly
 characteristic of its field communi-
 cation.  Thus, the special cable re-
 fresher  training  requested  by the
 Office of Logistics was geared to the
 problems resulting from this general
 situation.
 As in the DD/P-requested class,
 attended only  by personnel of  that
 component,  the Logistics class con-
 centrated on "live" materials of in-
 terest tothe secretary and stenogra-
 pher.  The purpose of these special
 classes is to maintain  a high effi-
 ciency in respect to Agency communi-
 cation  - cable  traffic - and  con-
 stantly  to improve                   this  level o f
 service  through periodic refresher
 instruction.

 NEW CURRENT EVENTS TEST DEVELOPED
 S SSMENT AND EVALUATION STAFF/TR
 The need for a means of appraising
 a professional applicant's knowledge
 of current affairs long has been re-
 cognized  in relation to  many posi-
 tions in the  Agency.   The rapidity
 with which tests of this sort become
 obsolete,thus far, has prevented the
 development of tests  in this area.
 Now, the A&E Staff/TR has developed
 for use in  the Professional  Appli-
 cant Test Battery  (PATB)  a  unique
 test designed to measure an  appl.i-
 cant's knowledge  and                  understanding
 of  current events  on the  national
 and international scene. The items
 are drawn from significant happenings
 of the past year and a half. The con-
 tent is balanced among  the several
 areas of the world and among politi-
 cal, economic,  military, and other
 fields. The questions, each of which
 is on a separate looseleaf page, are
 constantly reviewed  and replaced by
 new items as they grow  out of date
 or  as new significant events occur
 in their area.  Liberal use  is made
 of maps, political cartoons, graphs,
 and quotations from speeches and edi-
 torials in an effort to get at an in-
 dication  of the individual's under-
 standing  of broad problems  and de-
 velopments  rather  than    memory for
 recent headlines.
 4'4s items accumulate  over the years,
 it will become possible  to use them
 in  individual cases  to appraise  a
 person's knowledge  of what has hap-
 pened in a given area                                                                 over a sped,
 fied period of time.
 Further information regarding this
 test can be obtained  by calling the
 Chief,  Testing Services Branch, MeE
 Staf#/TR, extension 2798.
 NEXT INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS EXHIBIT
 SCHEDULED 14 FEBRUARY, THURSDAY
 Members of the Agency are invited
 to attend the Intelligence  Products
 Exhibit,scheduled to be shown in the
 ludil orium of the Recreation and Ser-
 vice Building on Thursday, 14 Febru-
 ary, between 0930 and 1200 hours.
 Designed primarily as an integral
 part  of  Intelligence  Orientation.,
 course B-3 in your office copy of the
 OTR Catalog,  the  exhibit  has been
 found  to be of  great  interest and
 significance to members of the Agency.
 The exhibit  is unique, in  that it
 presents in one room a comprehensive
 view of the greater  part of the in-
 telligence activities of CIA.
 It  is  believed  that  this test,
 among those developed  in support of
 the activities of the Office of Per-
 sonnel, will be a useful addition. to
 the  screening of applicants  for a
 wide variety of specific assignments.
 The exhibits are held every month
 during  the  year,  August  excepted,
 For the first half of 1957, they are
 scheduled  for  14 March, 11  April.,
 9 May, and 6 June.

 enrollment of four persons,  in Chi-
 nese,                   Japanese, Italian,  German,

 FIRST AMERICANS ABROAD COURSE
 -GIVEN ON A REGIONAL BASIS-COMPLETED
 The first  Americans Abroad course
 to be conducted on a regional, rather
 than a country, basis  was completed
 in mid-January.   In addition to the
 Agency students enrolled, two depen-
 dents of  Agency personnel  attended
 this AMERICANS ABROAD - THE MIDDLE
 EAST.
 The regional approach originally
 was chosen  because of the practical
 difficulties involved  in scheduling
 courses  for  each  of  the numerous
 countries of the area.   This treat-
 ment proved successful.
 Little  or no class preparation is
 required. Each seminar meets twice
 a week for from one to two hours, as
 arranged  between the leader and the
 group.    Formal registration  is not
 required;   no evaluation  or attend-
 ance reports are made.
 If you are interested in attending
 one of these seminars,  you may dir-
 ect your inquiry  through              extension
 4437. Please, if possible, make your
 reservation  prior  to  26 February.
 Persons who thus arrange for attend-
 ance in a seminar will be invited,by
 1 March, to attend an organizational
 meeting  during'which the group will
 plan  their hours and place of meet-
 ing,and determine the subject mater-
 ials on which they desire to concen-
 trate their seminar activity.
 Throughout the course  stress  was
 placed on those factors  of life  in
 the Middle East which provide a com-
 mon experience for those assigned to
 5X1A
 Religion,  language, s0cta125X1 A
 customs,  as well as people, places,
 and problems,were among the subjects
 discussed by students with those who
 knew the area as natives or had lived
 there for some time. Problems pecul-
 iar to the posts to which individual
 students were assigned also were dis-
 cussed in specific manner.

 CHINA AND RUSSIA
 25X1A9a
 (a review by                       Assistant/Eastern Studies/TR)
 In a penetrating analysis of Sino-Russian relations, "China and Russia",
 in the June, 1956, issue of Atlantic V.bnthly, Edward Crankshaw quotes Sazonov,
 Russian Foreign Minister in 1912, as answering a German appeal for aid in
 strengthening China, with the comments  "Russia .   . cannot wish for the
 strengthening of her neighbor; she could therefore view with equanimity the
 collapse of modern China,"  What Sazonov was saying, and what Crankshaw makes
 as a significant point in his article, is that neither Tsarist Russia nor
 Soviet Russia has ever desired a strong independent national state on her long
 eastern border.  The pertinence of this idea and of its implications is fre-
 quently overlooked today.  N'atio:rial policy is the outgrowth of internal and
 external pressures-the moves of a society toward adaptation to its social
 and physical environment. Russiata Far Eastern policy long antedates the
 October Revolution.  The fact that both Russia and China are today communist
 states, with a consequent political li:rikage, tends to blur the larger picture.
 It is true that basic communist doctrine aims at communization of the
 world, and it is also true that in the early years of the Revolution in Russia
 communists the world over, aided and encouraged from Moscow, worked hard to
 accomplish this aim. But as Len:l.nism changed to Stalinism, so Soviet foreign
 policy was reshaped to embrace the concept, Russian as well as Soviet, of
 Russian domination of Eurasia.  World revolution was still a goal of the
 Kremlin, but where heretofore the phrase did not necessarily imply Soviet dom-
 jnation, Stalinist doctrine now admitted not even a pretense of national
 equality with Russia on the ;part of any communist state.
 Thus, Soviet policy was aimed more at destroying Chiang Kai-shek than at
 aiding Mao Tse-tung.  Paramountcy in Asia was the aim of Russia, both before
 and after the Revolution.  As Crankshaw points out, Mao's rapid success took
 Stalin completely by surprise.  The US31 had been planning and working for a
 weak and ineffectual South China hemmed in on the west by Sinkiang, on the
 north by Mongolia, North China and Manchuria, and on the east by North Korea,
 all under the actual domination of Russia.  But,, virtually unaided by Russia
 until the end appeared inevitable, the Peoplets Republic of China was establish-
 ed in 1949 and in the years that followed, Chinese dominance was extended from
 Sinkiang to North Korea.  Only in Outer Mongolia has Russia retained control.
 China is in the way of becoming a power in Asia in its own ri ht.  And
 China has 600 million people (as opposed to the USSR's 220 million, growing at
 the rate of 20 million a year (as opposed to .3 million annually in Russia).
 China has an expanding econonW, has already shown she can stand up to Western
 armies on an equal footing, and has strong national ambitions of her own.  China,
 is indeed communist, but neither a satellite nor a junior partner of Russia.

 It is fully sovereign, fully independent.  Its brand of communism, though
 closely akin to Russian communism in theory, has been tailored to suit Chinese
 aims and Chinese conditions.  Pertinently, one may question whether any society,
 in the long run, reshapes itself to suit the requirements of an ideology or
 whether an ideology is remoulded in the course of time to meet local conditions.
 What are China's aims?   Is China more concerned with the propagation of
 communism in Asia--international communism, Moscow brand, that is-or is it
 rather concerned with rehabilitating itself as a viable society and a power in
 Asia?  To put it another way, is China dedicated to the Soviet cause, in which
 the absolute dominance of Moscow is implicit, or is it determined to maintain
 its own independence and to pursue its own course?  Crankshaw suggests that
 China's aims are Chinese and not Russian and that a position of subservience
 to Moscow is, and will continue to be, abhorrent to Peking.  Crankshaw also
 suggests that Moscow is fully aware of this:
 ~~.     Messrs. Bulganin and Khrushchev (have) their eyes on another-
 place besides Washington or London:  no other place than Peking.
 Because in the eyes of the proud and jealous Chinese, the spiritual
 leaders of the new Asia, how can the demonstrative appearance of
 these pink-skinned Russians as patrons of the new India, of the new
 Burma, bordering on China herself, be regarded as anything but a
 challenge, a new manifestation of the southward-probing dynamic of
 the old, old Russia?  How can the new China, tearing hell for
 leather into her own industrial revolution, needing urgently all
 the machines and steel that the Soviet Union can spare, regard with
 enthusiasm Moscow's lavish promises of these desiderata to countries
 which have not had a revolution . . . .  To imagine that everything
 done in Moscow and Peking is concerned directly.with Washington or
 London is not much more sensible than to believe that we have
 offended the gods when our house is struck by lightning."
 CPYRGHT
 Mr. Crankshaw's article is of particular interest in the light of Chou
 En-lai's current activities.  China's protestations of unity with the USSR and
 devotion to Moscow leadership are certainly intended for external consumption
 and do not necessarily reflect the true state of affairs.  One cannot but won-
 der whether this "little brother" act was not put on in response to a frantic
 appeal from Moscow for evidence of unity in the face of an obviously deterio-
 rating situation.  One also wonders what the quid pro quo is to be.  It is not
 likely that Peking did not obtain one.
 Eastern Studies, Language and Area School/TH., in addition to numerous
 Chinese and Russian language courses, this Spring and Summer is offering three
 area courses covering East Asia and embracing much of the material discussed
 in Grankshaw's article.

 All. CIA personnel interested in Improving their language proficiency
 and area, knowledge are invited to attend a series of foreign language lectures
 (see Lecture Schedule below) presented Wednesdays at 1530 hours, in room
 1-5~2, Quarters Ere.  Information regarding the series may be obtained by
 calling                 extension 231 or 3629.  You will, of course, wish
 to arrange with your supervisor for authorization prior to attendance at any
 one of the lectures.
 Recognizing the need for increased knowledge in the language and area
 fields, the Office of?Training is offering this series of lectures to be
 given in the major languages of the world. by CIA personnel.  Topics of
 particular interest, both to analysts and personnel in operations, have
 been selected.  The purpose is twofold:  To'
 o advance your knowledge of
 foreign languages; to increase your insight into the understanding of
 foreign peoples - their patterns of thought and behavior.
 A special feature of the program is the amount of attention devoted
 to the theme "Understanding and Dealing With Foreign Peoples."  Individual
 lecturers will speak on how to ,understand and deal with the Russians, the
 Japanese,, the Latin Americans, (-.etc.  In this way, much of the "know-how"
 gained by our personnel through years of experience will be transmitted
 to you.  As a result, it is hoped that in your contacts with the different
 nationalities, both here and abroad, you will, be able to establish more
 effective rapport and attain better results.
 Summaries of the lectures, in English, will be provided in the
 "Understanding and Dealing With Foreign People" talks, and also in a few
 other instances.  The lecture in Arabic, due to the very limited number

 FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TESTS
 The Foreign Language Proficiency Tests are for those persona
 who already have some knowledge of a given language, and are designed
 to test how well a person reads, writes, and speaks that language.
 Individuals applying for intermediate or advanced study of a language
 may be required by the Office of Training to take the proficiency
 test in that language in order to determine just what further train-
 ing will be most rewarding.  The written part of the test (covering
 reading and writing) requires about 3 - 4 hours and is given in the
 morning.  The oral part requires about 15 minutes for each person
 and is given in the afternoon.  Individuals may elect, or. be required
 to take tests in reading, writing, or speaking, or any combination
 of these capabilities.  All tests are administered on Wednesday.
 Call extension 3275, at least one week prior to the date of a test,
 to arrange an appointment.
