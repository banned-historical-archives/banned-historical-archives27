 So employers, employees, and consumers
 lose through the minimum wage system.
 The average consumer today complains
 about the costs of everything. The costs
 we complain about are directly tied to
 labor costs.
 Government-directed  increases  in
 wages make it hard for business to hire
 the inexperienced or less skilled worker.
 How many businesses can afford to hire
 a young, unskilled worker at the same
 price of an older, seasoned worker? If you
 ask anyone who wants a job but cannot
 find one, I think he will tell you that it is
 better to have a job at any price than no
 job at $2.90 an hour. These unreasonable
 rates are reasons why unemployment
 rates remain high, even during prosper-
 ous times, and why public sector jobs
 are proposed by the same legislators who
 caused the problem by increasing the
 mini
 mum wage.
 Periodically, but with amazing regu-
 larity, I hear from various small business
 people who have their own experiences
 to relate in this regard. One person, who
 owns a supper club In Wisconsin, said
 that because of the minimum wage level,
 his profits In the restaurant have disap-
 peared and he is losing money for the
 first time In 32 years. His prices are up
 by 15 to 20 cents per item. After Labor
 Day of this year, he plans to close down
 his lunch service. He said to me, "We
 used to have three salad girls and now
 the have two. They'll simply have to get
 the work done." Teenagers used to make
 tsp half of his staff, but now they only
 account for about 10 percent.
 .. Another restaurant owner in Z ilissouri
 wrote to me: "I have not had to lay any-?
 one off, but I have cut back on the num-
 ber of employees i do keep at any one
 time. We used to have five or six people
 for the day shift-now we have three or
 four. Our girls used to average about 20
 or 30 hours a week. Now they average 15
 to 20 hours." This restaurant owner is

 The purpose of this legislation, Mr.
 President, is to authorize unofficial, non-
 governmental relations with Taiwan. It
 is simply an adjustment to our laws to
 permit the maintenance of commercial,
 cultural, and other nongovernmental re-
 lationships in the new circumstances
 that exist after normalization. I intend
 to describe the principal features of this
 measure in a moment, but before doing
 so, I believe that this point needs to be
 reiterated: the relationship provided for
 in this bill-however extensive, however
 close, and however friendly-is not a
 government-to-government relationship.
 It is a relationship between two private
 entities-the American Institute in Tai-

 States; that any effort to determine the
 future of Taiwan by other than peaceful
 means, including boycotts or embargoes,
 would be a threat to the peace and secu-
 rity of the western Pacific and of grave
 concern to the United States; that the
 United States will maintain its capacity
 to resist any resort to force or other
 forms of coercion that would jeopard-
 ize the security, or-the social or economic
 system, of the people on Taiwan; and
 that the United States will make avail-
 able to Taiwan defense articles and serv-
 ices in such quantity as may be necessary
 to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
 self-defense capability.
 This should be very reassuring indeed
 to the people on Taiwan, for it specifies
 that the United States will oppose any
 form  of  external  coercion  directed
 against Taiwan. And it provides that we
 will assist Taiwan to maintain its own
 defense capability, which the Israelis
 have demonstrated is the best assurance
 of any nation's security. These provi-
 sions, together with the President's De-
 cember 15, 1978, statement, our im-
 proved communications with the PRC re-
 sulting from normalization, the lack of
 any significant amphibious capacity on
 the part of the People's Republic, and the
 fact that any PRC threat directed
 against Taiwan would dash its hopes for
 better relations with the United States,
 Japan and Western Europe-all these
 elements combine to make it clear that
 Taiwan's security is not endangered.
 The conference report also clearly pro-
 vides for Congressional oversight of these
 relations and of the operations of the
 American Institute in Taiwan. The Insti-
 tute has the authority and the responsi-
 bility to help American citizens carry out
 their many kinds of dealings with Tai-
 wan, which will enable our commercial
 and cultural relations to continue to ex-
 pand.  The  legislation  provides  that
 agreements and transactions made by or
 through the Institute shall be subject to
 the same congressional notification, re-
 view, and approval requirements and
 procedures as would normally apply. The
 conference report also places on the
 President and the Secretary of State spe-
 cific reporting requirements concerning
 the Institute's operations and economic
 relations between the United States and
 Taiwan. These provision were taken
 from the act passed by the Senate. They
 will enable the appropriate committees
 of the Senate and House of Representa-
 tives to carry out the responsibilities as-
 signed them in the Act passed by the
 House-the responsibility to monitor the
 implementation of this legislation, and to
 ,monitor developments in U.S. relations
 with Taiwan under these unique ar-
 rangements.
 In connection with these oversight pro-
 yisions, Mr. President, I submit for the
 RECORD a letter from the Department of
 State concerning arms exports to the
 People's Republic of China and I ask
 unanimous consent that it be printed in
 the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
 Washington, D.C., March 19, 1979.
 Hon. FRANK CKOECH,
 Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee
 Dias Mn. CHAnu AN: In today's proceed-
 ing of the committee of conference on H.R.
 2479, the question was raised as to whether
 the Congress would be informed at least
 thirty days in advance of the issuance of any
 license for significant arms export to the
 People's Republic of China.   .
 It is the policy of the United States, as
 reflected in section 126.01 of the Interna-
 tional Traffic in Arms Regulations, not to li-
 cense arms exports to the People's Republic
 of China.
 We do not contemplate any change in this
 policy. In view of the concerns expressed by
 the conference committee, however, I can as-
 sure you that the Department of State would
 not license significant arms exports to the
 People's Republic of China without providing
 the Congress at least thirty days' prior notice.
 This assurance is in addition to the report-
 ing requirements of existing law, which re-
 quires thirty days' prior notice to the Con-
 gress of the proposed issuance of licenses for
 the export of major defense equipment sold
 for $7 million or more, or other defense
 articles or services sold for $25 million or
 more.
 I trust that the foregoing assurance meets
 the concerns expressed in today's meeting of
 the conference committee.
 Sincerely,
 DouGLAS J. BENNET, Jr.,
 Assistant Secretary for
 Congressional Relations.
 Mr. CHURCH. It is not for the United
 States to determine Taiwan's destiny.
 However, we do have an important in
 terest that this issue be resolved peace-
 fully and in a manner that takes into
 account the will of the people on Taiwan.
 It is encouraging that the People's Re-
 public of China has adopted a flexible
 approach toward this issue in recent
 months. We should no nothing to dis-
 courage the Chinese leaders from con-
 tinuing along this course.
 Mr. President, this measure makes
 clear to the People's Republic of China
 that the United States has a deep in-
 terest in a peaceful resolution of the
 Taiwan issue. It also makes clear to the
 people on Taiwan that we are not aban-
 doning them by providing for the con-
 tinued supply of defense articles and
 services, and by establishing a sound
 legal and economic basis for continued
 relations between the United States and
 Taiwan.
 I believe that this conference report
 will enable the United States to con-
 tinue a close and friendly relationship
 with the people on Taiwan while simul-
 taneously developing a mutually bene-
 ficial relationship with the People's Re-
 public of China. I therefore urge the
 Senate to approve the conference report.
 Mr. President, I now defer to the dis-
 tinguished Senator from New York (Mr.
 JAVITS), the ranking Republican mem-
 ber on the committee.
 I note that a valiant member on the
 Democratic side, the Senator from Ohio
 (Mr. GLENN) has come to the floor, and
 I invite him to take charge of the man-
 agement of H.R. 2479, while I am re-
 quired to attend a meeting called by the
 majority leader.
 53641
 Mr. JAVI'I'S. Mr. President, before our
 colleague leaves, may I first say that I
 join in what he has said, and wish to
 express my support for this conference
 report and my deep gratification for this,
 the first substantial work of our part-
 nership as chairman and ranking minor-
 ity member of the' Foreign Relations
 Committee. We have worked harmoni-
 ously, and I believe effectively, together
 to effect the accomplishment of the high
 purposes of our country. I thank him
 very much.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, the Tai-
 wan Relations Act, which is the name of
 this act, is in my judgment an equitable
 blending of the House and Senate ver-
 sions of this complicated legislation deal-
 ing with a very complicated problem, and
 therefore, a bill which has to be read
 carefully to be clearly understood. Al-
 though the House and Senate bills con-
 tained significant differences of ap-
 proach and technique, they reflected a
 close identity of purpose: To provide the
 necessary legislative basis for continuing
 close, unofficial relations with Taiwan
 within the framework of the Sino-Ameri-
 can joint communique normalizing dip-
 lomatic relations between the United
 States and the People's Republic of
 China.
 In this respect, the intent of the House
 and the Senate were the same. Both bills
 sought to provide legislatively, for the
 continuation of commercial, cultural, and
 other relations between the people of the
 United States and the people on Taiwan
 in the wake of the President's actions
 recognizing the Government of the Re-
 public of China on Taiwan.
 Neither bill sought to reestablish offi-
 cial relations between the United States
 and the Republic of China on Taiwan;
 Congress, as Senator CHuac r has pointed
 out, does not have the authority to do
 that even if it wanted to do so. Neither
 bill challenged the basic understandings
 on normalization of relations with the
 People's Republic of China.
 The bill which emerged from the con-
 ference authorizes a full range of rela-
 tions with Taiwan on an unofficial basis.
 Existing rights and obligations are pro-
 tected, existing programs are preserved.
 The strength of the ties between the peo-
 ple of the United States and Taiwan is
 maintained.
 A 'strong statement of the United
 States' national interest in Taiwan's se-
 curity is in the bill as it emerged from
 conference.
 This is the principal feature, in my
 judgment, which the Congress has added
 on this matter. The People's Republic of
 China, through its officials, is said to be
 jumping up and down about this legis-
 lation. Mr. President, I think by now they
 ought to be sophisticated enough to
 understand that foreign policy in this
 country is made by the President but
 with the advice and consent of the Con-
 gress, and, therefore, the Congress has
 a right to insert, in advising and con-
 senting, the conditions which it deems
 appropriate to Its advice and consent.
 That is what we did here,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE          March 29, 1979
 Mr. President, when the legislation was
 debated I made it very clear that great
 nations cannot bluff and, that therefore
 if the PRC decided that it could not
 normalize relations with the United
 States because of the provisions which
 we felt compelled to make-unofficial
 but very real in terms of our obligations
 and commitments to the people on Tai-
 wan-that we were not fooling about
 these, and that if they were unsatis-
 factory, then there obviously could not
 be normalization.
 Therefore, while I recognize and re-
 spect in full the protests and the feelings
 of the Government of the People's Re-
 public, I point out that this simply is
 inherent in what American policy, in our
 judgment, must be. We are not asking
 them to agree with it; we are only asking
 them to accept it, and accept it they do
 when'they continue the normalization of
 our relations.
 While I pay serious attention to how
 they feel about it, I think they must
 understand that this is us, this is the
 United States of America, in its total
 governmental manifestation. That in-
 cludes a very reasonable and very neces-
 sary obligation respecting the security
 of the people on Taiwan.
 This legislation is only the first step in
 a series of steps which maybe taken in
 the process of normalizing relations. We
 must still resolve the issue of past claims
 by American citizens against the Govern-
 ment            of  China;  we  must  consider
 whether to grant most-favored-nation
 trade treatment, offer expanded credits
 and approve a trade agreement with the
 People's Republic. It, is in the interest of
 both of our countries to continue to pro-
 ceed along this path of normalization,
 but each step of the way must be a care-
 ful and deliberate one with Congress
 fully involved and contributing to the
 outcome. This is the nature of our sys-
 tem, and the very essence of the democ-
 racy with which the PRC has chosen to
 establish a new relationship. We might
 as well get used to each other right from
 the beginning.
 In this connection, let me quote from
 the Washington Post editorial of March
 27, 1979:
 It must have come as something of a shock
 to the Chinese to discover that the arrange-
 ments they had laboriously worked out with
 the executive branch were tampered with
 by the legislature. Welcome to America. 'Nor-
 malization' means not merely regularizing
 official relations but opening up those rela-
 tions to the normal buffeting of the Ameri-
 can political process.
 I ask unanimous consent that the com-
 plete text of this editorial be printed in
 the RECORD at this point, along with two
 other articles, one dated March 25, 1979,
 by Jay Mathews, and the other dated
 March 26, 1979, by David Binder.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington Post, Mar. 27, 1979]
 PEKING'S POLITICAL EDUCATION
 The People's Republic of China has now
 pronounced "unacceptable" the legislation
 in which the Congress sought to strengthen,
 beyond the administration's measure, the
 formal assurances the United States is offer-
 ing Taiwan. Most of the congressional in-
 crements were a good idea; and it's not such
 a bad idea, either, that Peking has been af-
 forded this occasion to deepen its political
 education.
 The increments do not alter the basic
 framework of normalization, and this is to
 the good. But by tone as much as by word,
 they make explicit a certain caution about
 China's ultimate intentions and a consider-
 able degree of sympathy for Taiwan. In other
 words, they make explicit what we take to be
 the feelings of most Americans. It must have
 come as something of a shock to the Chinese
 to discover that the arrangements they had
 laboriously worked out with the executive
 branch were tampered with by the legislature.
 Welcome to America. "Normalization" means
 not merely regularizing official relations but
 opening up those relations to the normal
 buffeting of the American political process.
 Although Peking is upset, it does not ap-
 pear to be so upset that it will react rashly,
 least of all, say, by "denormalizing." Only a
 handful of those congressmen who supported
 the new language could have wished to pro-
 voke that result. American diplomats are
 working overtime to limit the damage. But
 we think it can only strengthen Chinese-
 American relations for the long run for the
 two countries to learn that their political
 systems, and not alone their diplomatic es-
 tablishments, must meet and interact.
 The Chinese are not shy about defining
 their own national interest. Americans should
 be no less forthcoming. This is by way of
 saying that Peking should consider the ef-
 fect its invasion of Vietnam had on con-
 gressional consideration of the Taiwan leg-
 islation. The spectacle of China disregard-
 ing American urgings and sending troops
 across a border into a neighboring country
 surely helped spur Congress to strengthen
 the assurances being offered Taiwan.  We
 would even go a step further and suggest
 that that spectacle served as a useful brake
 on any incipient American tendency to re-
 gard normalization as a wholly unmixed
 blessing for the United States in its con-
 tinuing attempt to "contain" Soviet power.
 Normalization is desirable, we believe, but,
 like any other political act, it carries limits
 and risks. It is better that Americans pro-
 ceed with a knowledge of what the. risks
 are.

 PEKING  PROTESTS U.S. LEGISLATION  ON TAI-
 WAN TIES
 (By Jay Mathews)
 HONG KONG, March 24.-Peking has pro-
 tested U.S. legislation dealing with Taiwan
 as doing "great harm" to future relations. It
 is the first such Chinese warning to Wash-
 ington made public since the two countries
 opened full diplomatic ties Jan. 1.
 An official New China News Agency dis-
 patch released today said Chinese Foreign
 Minister Haung Hua told U.S. Ambassador
 Leonard Woodcock March 16 that bills passed
 by both houses of Congress were "unaccepta-
 ble to the Chinese government."
 [The State Department confirmed Satur-
 day that Woodcock had been called in by
 Huang but said it had no comment on the
 matter.]
 A separate official Chinese news agency
 story described the portions of the nearly
 identical House and Senate bills committing
 the United States to Taiwan's security as
 particularly objectionable to Peking.  The
 story also criticized clauses recognizing the
 existence of a separate government on Tai-
 wan and barring Peking from taking over
 property of Taiwan's former embassy in
 Washington.
 Diplomats had expected China to make
 some protest about congressional strengthen-
 ing of security guarantees for Taiwan. Pe-'
 king considers the' island to be part of its
 territory, temporarily controlled by an illegi-
 timate Nationalist Chinese leadership. It is
 uncertain, however, whether Peking will go
 so far as to halt or delay developing diplo-
 matic, cultural and trade ties with the Unit-
 ed States to underline its displeasure.
 The Chinese agency said Huang Hua told
 Woodcock, "If the bills are passed as they
 are worded now, and are signed into law,  r.
 great harm will be done to the new relation-
 ship that has just been established between
 China and the United States."
 Huang asked the U.S. government to en-
 sure that the Taiwan legislation does not
 violate Washington's agreement on normal-
 ized relations with Peking, but the Chinese
 agency gave no hint what action China would
 take if President Carter signed what it con-
 sidered unacceptable legislation.
 The Chinese protest came shortly after an
 attack on capitalism and the U.S. human
 rights campaign in a Peking newspaper that
 was in sharp contrast to glowing descriptions
 of American life found in the official Chinese
 media in recent months. Recently, American
 businessmen have found negotiations about
 projects in China slowing down.
 The changes seem related, however, to an
 internal reassessment of China's sudden poli-
 tical liberalization and foreign trade growth
 over the last several months, rather than to
 any reaction to American efforts to retain
 some commitment to Taiwan's 17 million
 people.
 Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping (Teng
 Hsiao-ping)  reportedly  complained  at  a
 closed-door party meeting March 16, the same
 day that Huang met Woodcock, of earlier
 Peking wallposters that had asked President
 Carter's help in improving China's human
 rights record.
 An article in the Peking Daily on Thursday
 appeared to follow this theme, criticizing
 "pertain young comrades" who "will beg the
 support of imperialism" in their campaign
 for human rights. This showed "lack of
 patriotism," the articles said.
 The newspaper argued that "privileges"
 still remained in the United States despite
 its efforts to "show off, its human rights." It
 described capitalism as a "mercenary slave
 system of unemployment, police persecution,
 suicides, prostitution and so on."
 Huang told Woodcock the bills passed by
 the U.S. Congress "contravene the principles
 agreed upon by the two sides" when Wash-
 ington and Peking announced Dec. 15 their
 formula for ending 30 years of diplomatic
 estrangement. Huang appeared to be refer-
 ring particularly to the U.S. promise to end
 its mutual security treaty with Taiwan and
 end all official ties with the island.
 The congressional bills are designed to con-
 tinue American trade, cultural and other ties
 with Taiwan through creation of an unoffi-
 cial American Institute in Taiwan as a sub-
 stitute for the U.S. embassy. Following a
 system used by the Japanese when they
 broke relations with Taiwan in 1972, the in-
 stitute is to be staffed by U.S. foreign serv-
 ice officers and other U.S. personnel who will
 temporarily resign from government serv-
 ice while they work in Taiwan but generally
 perform the same duties they did as embassy
 staff.
 Carter administration spokesmen assured
 Congress that Peking was not interested in
 and not militarily capable of taking Taiwan
 by force, and that no guarantees of the is-
 land's security were necessary, but Congress
 still insisted on adding language that Peking
 considers to be interference in its relations
 with one of its provinces.
 The Chinese news agency singled out lan-
 guage in the Senate bill declaring continued
 U.S. capacity "to resist any resort to force
 or other forms of coercion that would jeopar-
 dize the security, or social or economic sys-
 tem of the people on Taiwan."

 The Chinese agency protested parts of the
 bill that said Taiwan authorities would be
 considered a "foreign government" under any
 other applicable U.S. laws.
 It complained of another clause that said
 ownership of the spacious and valuable Em-
 bassy grounds in Washington would not be
 affected by normalization of relations with
 Peking.
 Taiwan turned the properties over to a
 group called-"The Friends of Free China" in
 December, but the State Department said it
 would support Peking if it chose to bring
 suit seeking ownership as the recognized
 ` government of China.
 The Chinese news agency said the embassy
 properties "should be legimate properties of
 the People's Republic of China."

 PLEDGE TO TAIWAN UPSETS THE CHINESE
 (By David Binder)
 WASHINGTON, March 25.-A stiff protest by
 the Chinese Government against legislation
 that provides strengthened United States
 security guarantees for Taiwan has created a
 predicament for President Carter, Adminis-
 tration officials said today.
 The protest was delivered to Leonard Wood-
 cock, the American Ambassador to China,
 on March 18 by Foreign Minister Huang Rua
 and repeated here last week by Chinese Em-
 bassy officials on a visit to the State De-
 partment.
 President Carter must seek to soften the
 Chinese attitude without annoying the Sen-
 ate and House, which completed a conference
 committee bill on .the Taiwan legislation last
 week and sent a report on the compromise
 legislation to the White House, Administra-
 tion officials said.
 The Peking Government published not only
 an announcement that Ambassador Wood-
 cock had been summoned to receive the pro-
 test, but also issued a dispatch via the of-
 ficial New China News Agency that described
 the American legislation as "unacceptable to
 the Chinese Government."
 FIRST PROTEST SINCE TIES SET UP
 The Administration officials said that the
 Taiwan protest was the first such complaint
 by China since full diplomatic relations were
 opened on Jan. 1.
 State Department officials said that they
 were not surprised by the Chinese protest,
 but had no other comment. White House of-
 ficials also declined to comment or to in-
 dicate the President's reaction.
 Mr. Carter had proposed that Congress
 adopt legislation that  would  enable the
 United States to maintain unofficial relations
 with Taiwan while taking up diplomatic
 ties with Peking, but at the same time the
 White House declared that it opposed word-
 ing that would give official character to the
 Taiwan relationship.
 The  compromise  wording  that  emerged
 after lively debate in Congress would au-
 thorize the United States to continue social
 and economic relations with the Chinese
 Nationalist Government on Taiwan through
 a new nonprofit corporation to be called the
 American Institute on Taiwan.
 CLOSE AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS
 The Senate bill declared that United States
 policy would be "to maintain extensive, close
 and friendly relations with the people on
 Taiwan" and "to consider any effort to re-
 solve the Taiwan issue by other than peaceful
 means a threat to the peace and security of
 the Western Pacific area and of grave con-
 cern to the United States." In addition, the
 Senate bill, whose wording has largely been
 retained in the conference legislation, would
 require the United States "to assist the peo-
 ple on Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
 defense capability through the provisions. of
 arms of a defensive character."
 The Senate's version of the bill passed on
 March 13, three days before the Chinese pro-
 test, in a 90-to-6 vote, while the House en-
 dorsed its version, 345 to 55. The conference
 legislation, which resolved the differences be-
 tween the two bills, was filed yesterday in
 both  houses  of  Congress.  Representative
 Clement J. Zablocki, the Wisconsin Demo-
 crat who heads the House Foreign Affairs
 Committee, said that the compromise bill
 would reach the floors of both houses on
 Tuesday.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr: President, the legis-
 lation crafted by the conference com-
 mittee is, in fact, much better for having
 had to go through this "buffeting" of
 the American political process. It is
 more careful and more thorough than
 the bill which the administration origi-
 nally proposed. By protecting the com-
 mercial, cultural, and other relations of
 the United States with the 171/2 Million
 people on Taiwan, It provides a firmer
 political foundation in this country for
 the improvement of relations with the
 People's Republic. I think that the lead-
 ers of the PRC will come to recognize
 this fact-that having dealt fairly with
 our friends on Taiwan, we are in a better
 position to continue the process of nor-
 malization with the People's Republic.
 The majority of the. Members of Con-
 gress, in my judgment, strongly favor
 the normalization of relations with the
 People's Republic of China and, in this
 legislation, sought only to fulfill our
 basic moral commitments to the people
 on Taiwan, in a way which is compatible
 with the goals and conditions for nor-
 malization of relations with the People's
 Republic.
 Now, Mr. President, this matter has
 been very much debated, and I will not
 reiterate the arguments about it or the
 meanings of the words which are used.
 However, I do wish to emphasize two
 things: First, under section 2(b) (3) we
 make it very.clear that when we sought
 to normalize relations with the PRC,
 that policy "rests upon the expectation
 that the future of Taiwan will be deter-
 mined by peaceful means."
 We mean it. I hope when the Presi-
 dent signs this bill, as I hope he will,
 that the implications of that paragraph
 will be crystal clear.
 And I might-say, Mr. President, that
 is no different from the fact that the
 PRC normalized relations with us upon
 the expectation that we would no longer
 maintain official diplomatic relations
 with the Republic of China on Taiwan.
 We have honored our commitment.
 Second, Mr. President, when we speak
 of the future of Taiwan and the fact
 that it shall only be changed by peaceful
 means, we also include-and this is, in
 my judgment, very, very important-the
 way in which they run their society and
 their right to determine how they shall
 run their society. That, Mr. President, is
 a very important element in our con-
 sideration because we say in section 2(b)
 (6), "to maintain the capacity of the
 United States to resist any resort to
 force or other forms of coercion" and
 these are the pertinent words "that
 would jeopardize the security or the so-
 cial or economic system of the people on
 Taiwan." " That means not only their se-
 curity but the social or economic system
 S3
 that they choose. I wish to make that
 crystal clear.
 Here, too, I refer the Government of
 the People's Republic of China to sec-
 tion 2(b) (1) which makes it very clear
 that we want the same close, friendly,
 and commercial relations with the PRC,
 itself. We have wrapped that into this
 very same security clause so there can
 be no doubt about our good faith in
 undertaking a normalization of relations
 with the People's Republic of China,
 just as there can be no doubt about our
 good faith as far as the people on Tai-
 wan are concerned.
 Mr. President, the other matter to
 which I wish to call attention, which
 relates to laws of the United States, is
 that we have been very careful to pre-
 serve property and other comparable
 rights without trying?to decide the Issue
 of the diplomatic installations which are
 here, especially the embassy property in
 Washington.  Generally\ speaking,  we
 have been very protective of property
 rights, et cetera, respecting the people
 on Taiwan and what they have created
 in this country, in the.United States.
 In that respect, I wish to emphasize,
 because it is very important to lawyers,
 the preemption clause which is contained
 in section 6(c) of this bill, which makes
 this measure, if signed by the President
 into law, the, governing law, if there is
 any conflict with other law of the United
 States or of the District of Columbia
 where this institute which is provided for
 is incorporated, or with the law of any
 State or political subdivision which "im-
 pedes or otherwise interferes with the
 performance of the functions of the in-
 stitute pursuant to that act."
 That is a very important clause, Mr.
 President, certainly, to the courts, to
 lawyers, and to people who are engaged
 in any litigation respecting property
 rights, and I call special attention to it.
 Finally, Mr. President, the definition.
 We  worked  on this  definition very
 ardently and with great concern. I be-
 lieve it spells out precisely what we mean
 when we use the term Taiwan. It refers
 not only to corporations and other en-
 tities and associations which are private,
 but also to the public authorities on Tai-
 wan as recognized by the United States
 prior, to January 1, 1979, as well as any
 successor governing authority there.
 I believe we have sought, as far as
 human beings can, to anticipate all of
 our problems and we have dealt with
 them in the text of this legislation.
 Mr. President, I hope that we will also
 now arrive at a relationship with the
 People's Republic of China which will
 move on satisfactorily, satisfactorily to
 them and satisfactorily to us, the ground
 rules having been laid down so very care-
 fully and so very precisely. Though it has
 been an arduous task, this represents one
 of the great decisions in our postwar his-
 tory. I think it has been made well and
 wisely. I take great pleasure and deep
 gratification in the fact that the Con-
 gress will have, when this bill is made
 into law, contributed an affirmative and
 a very constructive element to this rela-
 tionship. Congress has demonstrated its
 ability carefully to architect a piece of
 legislation which will do what needs

 to be done in terms of the national in-
 terest and the moral interest of the
 United States as far as the people on
 Taiwan were concerned. It does so with-
 out in any way transgressing any obliga-
 tion undertaken by the United States, in
 the Joint communique or otherwise, to-
 ward the People's Republic of China, or
 in any way complicating or nullifying the
 relationship which we have now agreed
 it is the high policy of the United States
 to establish with the People's Republic of
 China.
 Mr. President, I commend this confer-
 ence report to my colleagues. I commend
 to them also a careful examination of its
 craftsmanship in legal terms. I hope very
 much that the Senate will see fit today,
 as the other body has already done, to
 approve this conference report.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I associate
 myself with the remarks of the distin-
 guished ranking minority member of the
 Committee on Foreign Relations and the
 remarks made earlier by our committee
 chairman (Mr. CHURCH). I only add one
 thought or two to the statements they
 have already made.
 I read in the newspaper a few days ago,
 with some concern, Mr. President, re,
 narks by Foreign Minister Huang Hua
 of the People's Republic of China, as re-
 ported in the Washington Post, to the
 effect that the phrase "unacceptable to
 the Chinese Government" was Mr. Hua's
 description of the deliberations of our
 conference committee with the House in
 regard to the Taiwan Relations Act. The
 analysis, as reported in that story, indi-
 cated that the PRC, or, at least, Foreign
 ,Minister Huang Hua, felt that in our
 conference committee deliberations, we
 had apparently gone considerably beyond
 the security guarantees for Taiwan pre-
 viously expressed by the administration
 and previously agreed to in the normal-
 ization discussions that were held be-
 tween  the  administration  and  the
 People's Republic of China.
 I do not feel that we did go substan-
 tially beyond that, and I hope that in
 our new relationship, the People's Re-
 public of China representatives do not
 over-analyze what happens in the U.S.
 Senate in the treaty ratification process
 or on a normalization procedure which
 we have gone through with the House.
 Those basic interests in the security of
 Taiwan, and the basic relationship of
 continuing arms sales during this year
 that were already in the pipeline, and
 the capability of making new security
 commitments-new arms commitments-
 to Taiwan at, the end of this year, begin-
 ning on January 1, 1980, were in the
 original administration agreement of
 normalization. We basically expressed
 our prerogatives here, in Congress, as
 equal partners in this normalization
 process to establish our "grave concerns,"
 with regard to the long-term security of
 Taiwan. That term, particularly, was
 picked up by Foreign Minister Huang
 Hua as being especially obnoxious.
 He went on to say:
 If the bills are passed as they are worded
 now and are signed into law, great harm will
 be done to the new relationship that has
 just been established between China and the
 United States.
 I submit to the Foreign Minister of  charade. In this case, we have alienated
 the People's Republic of China that we a friend of many years' standing, for
 have gone no farther than the adminis-  precious little in return. And we have, I
 tration in expressing our concerns; the am certain, diminished our character

 vania Avenue that there be peaceful res- 900 million-people, not to mention their
 olution of the disagreements with regard self-satisfied leaders.
 to the final status of Taiwan.
 In all of our documentation here, and
 in all of the work of the conference com-
 mittee, we have recognized, as both sides
 have said is the case through many years,
 that it is one nation. We repeated over
 and over again that we have grave con-
 cern, and we would continue our sales
 to Taiwan at the end of this year at
 whatever balance of military forces was
 deemed necessary at that time.
 So, I repeat, Mr. President, that I hope
 the People's Republic of China and their
 officials, in their new relationship here
 and their new diplomatic responsibili-
 ties for making normalization work prop-
 erly, are not overanalyzing things and
 forgetting that we at this end of Penn-
 sylvania Avenue, the Congress, have an
 equal responsibility, under our consti-
 tutional form of government, to express
 the will of the people. In our checks and
 balance system the Congress, as well as
 the President, is responsible for negoti-
 ating this new normalization that we
 have with the People's Republic of China.
 It does not go that much further and
 does not change drastically what the
 President agreed to in the normalization
 process.
 I think, with those few words to be
 added to the words already expressed
 by Senator JAVITS and Senator CHURCH,'
 I shall see if anybody else wishes to speak
 on the subject.
 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I speak
 today in opposition to the conference
 report on the Taiwan enabling legisla-
 tion. My conviction is that a great power
 retains both its greatness and its power
 by dealing forthrightly and resolutely
 with the other nations of the world. I do
 not think we are dealing forthrightly and
 resolutely by this bill. The whole ap-
 proach is typified by the "Institute"
 which is being established to carry out
 our new relationship with Taiwan. This
 Institute is, we are told, to be private-
 unofficial-totally nongovernmental. Yet
 in the same breath, the administration
 comes toxequest the public moneys to fi-
 nance the Institute, making the, idea of
 unofficially a complete sham. I cannot in
 good conscience be a party to this kind of
 legislative legerdemain.
 We are back to the diplomacy of de-
 ception and charade. I thought we had
 passed that era back in the middle of the
 decade, but here it is again in full blos-
 som-the  secret  deals-the  weasel
 words-the decision taken without con-
 gressional consultation, in contraven-
 tion of the law-the hard sell of saying:
 Provide the money now, Senator, or blood
 will flow in the streets of Taipei and the
 responsibility for that will be yours to
 shoulder.
 So we sail to a new breeze.' We enter a
 whole new relationship-in East Asia and
 one that is, in the case of Taiwan,
 unprecedented. To carry out the un-
 precedented relationship we have an un-
 tested  instrumentality,  one  without-
 legitimate diplomatic parentage-it is
 instead the child of appeasement. New
 opportunities for mischief by the Peo-
 ple's Republic are rife. In the debate
 some 2 weeks ago, I described at length
 the kind of pressures that the People's
 Republic could well be bringing against
 Taiwan in the months ahead. I spoke not
 of the force of military invasion, but of
 the equally insidious coercion of eco-
 nomic strangulation. The weapons in
 this war will not be troops and bayonets,
 but shipping licenses and trade restric-
 tions designed to cut off Taiwan-our
 ninth largest trading partner-from the
 world's commercial nations.
 Mr. President, there is a great deal rid-
 ing on our new East Asian initiatives.
 There is uncertainty, there is lack of ade-
 quate safeguards, there is only the reality
 of change and of danger. And what, then,
 do we propose to oversee this new rela-
 tionship? Why a nice little private, non-
 governmental institute, wrapped in the
 foil of charade, and probably at this mo-
 ment bringing tears of laughter to the
 leaders of mainland China.
 Of course, it would have been much
 better to insist upon some kind of con-
 tinuing official relationship with our
 friends on Taiwan. I think we might very
 well have been able to extract that from
 the negotiations with the People's Re-
 public. But that was not done, that is
 history; so, with the hard sell on, I looked
 to see how we might somehow enhance
 the relationship and lend some aura of
 officiality, or at least official oversight,
 to the new East Asian policies. I hit upon
 the idea of a Joint Congressional Com-
 mission for Security and Cooperation
 in East Asia. It was to be a small com-
 mission, a minor government body, with
 a similarly minor budget. Small and
 lean, but able at least to report on how
 our policies were actually developing,
 how the untested instrumentality was
 proceeding, how we might improve our
 position in that part of the world. It was
 patterned on the model of the Helsinki
 Commission, which has done so much to
 point up the continuing problems iyA,
 Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
 Certainly it was no threat to the pre-
 rogatives of any congressiona' commit-
 tee-it was simply a tiny supplement to
 our overburdened committees-a way of
 bringing constant monitoring into a con-
 stantly evolving environment-simply;
 cheaply, expeditiously. It would repre-

 total disregard of reality. For, in essence,
 I think I will put the word "official"
 against every dollar we appropriate
 there.
 Incidentally, I said earlier in my re-
 marks that I have talked with the Presi-
 dent, and the Congress, apparently, will
 pass this, and he will sign it, so I will
 not stand in the way if the President
 wants to get something done, even
 though I disagree with it.
 But what I disagree with most of all is
 the proposition that this was in good
 order, that it did not reflect on the way
 the United States of Americas conducts
 its business.
 For one thing, the President disre-
 gards history. He shows a propensity to do
 that. He started off as President and tried
 to remake Midwest water policy, effectu-
 ated and evolved over a 75-year period
 by 11 States, Governors, Republicans, and
 Democrats, for the use of the Colorado
 River and other waters, and all the other
 reclamation. The President immediately
 characterized them as pork barrel,and
 tried to change the water and reclama-
 tion policy of America. Of course, he ran
 into a hornet's nest, not because it was
 pork barrel, but because it was good pol-
 icy. Mistakes were made. We cleaned
 them up in that particular program.
 Even in foreign policy, we have water
 projects and hydroelectric projects, irri-
 gation dams, and what-have-you, under
 the World Bank and the International
 Development Agency, to the tune of over
 $1.7 billion this year. International, for-
 eign pork barrel, even into Communist
 Romania. But do not let me go off on
 that subject. Let us stick to the sense of
 history.
 I do not think Teng Hsiao-ping has
 ever seen Taiwan. Now, many of us here,
 probably everyone in this Chamber, has
 been to Taiwan. I do not think anybody

 regard that I fully share the opinions
 expressed by the able Senator from New
 York.
 .Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield for a comment?
 Mr. PERCY. I yield.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I doubt that this
 clears things up, but after the so-called
 Shanghai letters I engaged Dr. Kissinger
 in quite a number of discussions on this
 and he assured me that there was
 nothing in the original Nixon discussion
 relative to the abandonment of Taiwan.
 He even went so far as tell me that in
 his discussions with Peking he himself
 would have to bring the subject up be-
 cause Peking would never bring it up and
 usually respond by saying, "Well, that is
 a problem that we will solve when we get
 to it."
 So while I have never seen the con-
 tents of the Shanghai letters, I am mere-
 ly reciting what Dr. Kissinger has told
 me which I had learned, by the way,
 from President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger
 that Taiwan was not to be abandoned by
 any plan that was thought up for them.
 I merely wanted to say that for the
 record and not ask for a change, be-
 cause that cannot be done.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I wish to
 associate myself with the comments of
 my distinguished colleague from Arizona.
 There is no abandonment by any means,
 implied or expressed, in this legislation.
 In fact, my opening comments were to
 the effect that I think the bill before us
 represents the will of the majority in this
 Chamber because it expresses the con-
 cern of the American people that the fu-
 ture of Taiwan and the Pescadores be
 i esolved on a peaceful basis, and we re-
 affirm this.
 And I do look forward to a construc-
 tive unofficial relationship with the peo-
 ple of Taiwan.
 We also look forward to an expanding
 cooperative relationship with the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China, the most popu-
 lous nation on Earth.
 I am personally satisfied that this bill
 allows us to maintain unofficial contacts
 with Taiwan as we move toward closer
 and mutually beneficial official relations
 with China.
 Mr.'President, because this has been an
 extraordinarily complicated matter, and
 it is a matter that is so significant to the
 interests of this country, it is important
 that we have an overwhelming vote in
 the House and the Senate. This is not
 the kind of an issue we would want re-
 solved by one or two votes on either side.
 We should have a mandate from the
 Congress of the United States that we
 stand together with the executive branch
 of Government in taking this momentous
 step forward.
 For that reason, I wish particularly to
 'commend my colleagues, the managers
 of the bill, Senator CHURCH, the chair-
 man of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions, and Senator JAVITS, the ranking
 minority member, for an extraordinary
 job.
 Although I have disagreed on a'few
 matters, that does not in any way de-
 tract from my great admiration for the
 skillful way in which they have-in the
 highest tradition of statesmanship?
 moved the Senate of the United States
 forward, and the House of Representa-
 tives forward, to a point where we can
 overwhelmingly endorse this legislation
 today.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Senator
 very much for his generous comments.
 I simply want to stress my personal
 indebtedness to the distinguished Sen-
 ator from New York for his cooperation,
 and also to the other members of the
 Committee on Foreign Relations, who
 throughout this legislation have worked
 to perfect a bill that would command
 overwhelming support here in the Senate.
 I speak to those Senators of the com-
 mittee who are present, Senator HELMS
 from North Carolina, Senator PERCY
 from Illinois, Senator HAYAKAWA from
 California, Senator MUSHIE from Maine,
 Senator GLENN from Ohio, and all the
 other members of the Senate Committee
 on Foreign Relations. My thanks and ap-
 preciation are extended to them.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS. I join with my colleague,
 the chairman, and associate myself with
 his remarks.
 I want to especially thank Senator
 PERCY.  I  am a lawyer, as everybody
 knows by now, and I always value being
 put to my proof, and his assiduous con-
 centration on the terms of this bill, I
 think, had a great deal to do with my
 own ability to summon what creativity
 was required in order to do what he now
 applauds us for. Without him I do not
 think it would have been done, and I
 thank him very much.
 ? Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the House
 has passed the compromise conference
 report on the Taiwan Relations Act by
 a vote of 339 to 50. The overwhelming
 support for this legislation, which I hope
 will be reflected as well in this Chamber,
 reveals the general satisfaction with the
 amendments the Congress made to this
 legislation, which resulted in a complete
 rewrite of the original administration
 proposal.
 We in the Senate were concerned
 about our security guarantees to Taiwan
 and we strengthened that language in
 the bill-now we have made our position
 perfectly clear to the People's Republic
 of China: Not only do we expect the dif-
 ferences between Peking and Taipei to
 be settled by peaceful means, but we will
 consider actions taken to ruin the econ-
 omy of Taiwan as a threat also. This
 nomic organizations around the world
 or by preventing international trade
 through discriminating bilateral agree-
 ments.
 I am still not convinced the Carter
 administration bargained with sufficient
 diligence on the issue of official relations
 with Taiwan. President Nixon and Ford
 could have normalized relations with Pe-
 king any time in the last 7 years on these
 terms. I do believe that the Senator from
 Kansas and his many colleagues have
 made the very best of a poor situation, by
 amending this legislation to include cer-
 S 3649
 tain rights and privileges for Taiwan,
 and the final result is that our future
 relations will be conducted almost as
 they once were, official relations in all
 but name.
 This past weekend Peking heavily
 criticized these actions by the Congress.
 I welcome this criticism. It means we
 have gotten our point across. The PRC
 now knows exactly where we stand on
 the Taiwan question. Let Peking not for-
 get that the United States has a strong
 strategic interest in the Asian Pacific
 area, and still has close ties of friendship
 and harmony with our allies, the people
 of Taiwan.
 I have here an article written by J.
 William Middendorf, former Secretary
 of the Navy and a former Ambassador to
 the Netherlands. It calls to mind the
 serious concerns and reservations many
 of us have about the normalization proc-
 ess and the manner in which it was
 carried out. I would hope the govern-
 ment in Peking will read these words
 and, keeping them in mind, temper their
 future criticism with the realization of
 how strongly the Congress. and the
 American people have felt about Taiwan.
 Mr. President, I submit for the RECORD
 the text of Ambassador Middendorf's
 article.
 The text follows:
 THE  SELLOUT  OF  TAIWAN:  "MORE  THAN  A
 CRIME-A  MISTAKE"
 (By J. William Middendorf)
 It was nearly the night before Christmas
 1978 ... and all through the House, and
 the Senate, nothing was stirring-everybody
 was home for Christmas.
 But a frenetic activity was going on in the
 White House, at the other end of Pennsyl-
 vania Avenue. They were hard at work pro-
 ducing what many believe was an attempt
 to divert the attention of the American peo-
 ple from the fact that the so-called Carter
 Middle East "Breakthrough" had become the
 Middle East Breakdown. It became a break-
 down because Rafshoonery is simply no sub-
 stitute for facing such problems as the
 status of the West Bank of Jordan and East
 Jerusalem-issues dodged at Camp David.
 So it appears- another "breakthrough" was
 arranged-even though it has been described
 as a breaking of at least three of the Presi-
 dent's campaign promises and a big question
 mark for America's credibility as the leader
 of the free world.
 We ought never to forget Candidate Car-
 ter's second TV debate with President Ford-
 in which in addition to saying "I'll-Never-
 Mislead-You", he told the American people:
 "I would certainly pursue the normaliza-
 tion of relationships with the Peoples Re-
 public of China ... But I would never let
 that friendship stand in the way of preser-
 vation of the independence and freedom of
 Ing of President Carter? At a news confer-
 ence in Kansas City just ten days later, Can-
 didate Carter elaborated on this subject:
 "We are bound by a treaty to guarantee
 the freedom of Formosa, Taiwan, the Re-
 public of China. I would like to improve our
 relationship-our  diplomatic  relationship
 with the PRC, mainland China; hopefully
 leading to normalization of diplomatic rela-
 tions  some  time                                                                                                in  the  future.  But I
 wouldn't go back on the commitment that
 we have had-to assure-that Taiwan is pro-
 tected from military takeover."
 Just 425 days later-with no such assur-
 ance whatever from Peking-at night, when
 the Congress had left town, the hand that

 held the dagger plunged it into the back of
 one of America's most loyal allies, and most
 lucrative trade partners. Goody-bye, Taiwan.
 This was carefully noted-with expressions
 of joy-by the mob manipulators in Iran.
 For the betrayal of Taiwan enabled them to
 realize that being a friend and ally of the
 United States Government has become al-
 most as dangerous as being a relative of the
 murderous King Herod-of whom the Em-
 peror Augustus once observed:  "I would
 rather be Herod's pig than his son."
 In came Bakhtiar, a new Kerensky, fol-
 lowed by Khomeini; another Potential Keren-
 sky, described by Andrew Young in one of his
 traditionally questionable statements, as a
 "future Saint". Good-bye, Iran.
 President Carter's alleged "China Break-
 through" was not merely the knifing of a
 friend and the utter disregard of the Dole-
 Stone Amendment, which by a vote of 94 to 0
 In the Senate requested consultation with
 Congress prior to any change in the Defense
 Treaty. The abandoning of Taiwan was not
 only wrong from the strategic point of view
 but, as we shall see later, unnecessary. It was
 an action that recalls the cynical classic of
 Talleyrand:
 "C'est plus qu'un crime; c'est une faute."
 Yes, it is more than a crime, it Is a mis-
 take. Just how much of mistake it was, has
 been well summarized by the former U.S. rep-
 resentative in Peking, and former Director of
 the CIA, George Bush.
 Ambassador Bush notes that this Carter
 sellout "not only diminished American cred-
 ibility in the world, but has also darkened
 the prospects of peace."
 Bush also recalls that with the leaders of
 mainland China, the so-called "liberation" of
 Taiwan was clearly secondary to the forty-
 five Soviet divisions poised'on China's north-
 ern border.
 And speaking of the word "liberation", is
 the Carter Administration prepared to claim
 that human rights are better observed on
 the mainland than on Taiwan
 They are not. The swimmers and the boat-
 ers always seem to be traveling away from
 Asia's communist paradises-never towards.
 In much the same way, it was not the capi-
 talists of West Berlin who felt obliged. to
 erect the Berlin Wall.
 Ambassador Bush dissects the alleged Car-
 ter China triumph and finds it not only want-
 ing, but ludicrous-a mistake, as Talleyrand
 put it, even greater than the moral crime of
 broken promises. For as Bush notes:
 "The terms that the Carter Administration
 has accepted and even trumpeted, are the
 same terms that have been available for the
 past seven years. But they were always re-
 fused before because we knew, just as the
 Chinese knew, they were a figleaf for an
 object American retreat     . China, whose
 primary interest lies in a strong, steadfast
 American presence in the world, has now
 seen just how easily we can be pushed
 around. The Chinese realize that we have
 given all and gained nothing ... The United
 States has put an entire people adrift in a
 cruel, hostile sea-and for scarcely any pur-
 pose."
 Just how much of a mistake it was, shows
 In a recent interview with President Carter
 that reveals a new dimension in what might
 be a monumental example of political ama-
 teurism. It is now apparent that neither
 Secretary of State Vance, nor National Secur-
 ity Advisor Brezsinski did even ask.for the
 continuation of diplomatic relations with
 Taiwan and for guarantees from the PRC re-
 garding Taiwan's security. It was just over-
 looked.
 Those who spoke about some secret ar-
 rangements as to the necessity of giving up
 Taiwan in order to establish relations with
 the PRC were proven wrong by these revela-
 tions. Taiwan could have been saved but was
 lost because of sheer incompetence-no su-
 perior state reasons involved.
 The whole situation is without sense-
 breaking diplomatic relations with Taiwan-
 a faithful ally-in order to please a country
 which, even in the best possible scenario, will
 in the long run unmistakably be a competi-
 tive super-power, leaving a small, successful
 democratic nation In the lurch for no cause;
 raising new question marks (even greater
 than after pulling out of Vietnam) regarding
 the reliability of the U.S. as an ally. Why
 couldn't the U.S. have diplomatic relations
 with both Chinas? So many countries have
 relations with East and West Germany. North
 and South Korea, North and South Yemen.
 Why did we have to offer the mainland Chi-
 nese a total victory? Leading Senators of
 both parties are now saying "we left some-
 thing on the table" in our negotiations with
 Communist China.
 Certain  moments  in  history  impose
 strange  alliances-like  the U.S.-Russian
 combat cooperative of World War II. But,
 I cannot see any reason why today the most
 powerful country in the world (if we are
 indeed that) should accept all the demands
 of an internationally isolated, underdevel-
 oped and politically unstable country, even
 if it has the largest population in the world.
 To cave in so easily is a sign of weakness,
 one which the Eastern mentality of the
 Chinese Communists will certainly not re-
 spect, to say nothing of our remaining
 "allies". The Communist Chinese themselves
 may well be privately asking of what per-
 manent value is this newly created alliance.
 Indeed, the true beneficiary of this new -
 "marriage of convenience" may be the Rus-
 sians, because although we have just estab-
 lished a new "Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty",
 we may have laid the groundwork for our
 final isolation from our most important al-
 lies who can see the handwriting on the
 wall.
 It thus appears that a total diplomatic
 victory, with serious consequences for the
 credibility of the United States in the world,
 had been offered to the Communist Chinese.
 Were they in such a strong bargaining po-
 sition? The facts do not seem to indicate
 this.
 Despite a recent treaty with Japan and
 some exchanges of visits with European
 countries, China Is still in the process of
 overcoming its international  isolation  of
 many. decades. China needs international
 recognition, especially in view of present
 tension with its more powerful neighbor-
 Russia, and China's new war with Vietnam.
 The Chinese economy is in a disastrous
 situation, 50 years or more behind the West-
 ern world; desperately in need of capital,
 technology and knowhow. It is now, esti-
 mated that it may take 15 years and $350
 billion dollars of the West's money to finance
 their infrastructure and industry needs to
 bring China up to a level where she could
 be an effective counter to Russian "hegem-
 ony". We may find the Russian Bear wan-
 dering long before that, and we may also
 find China's low cost exports to us more
 than we bargained for in the future.
 China's domestic political situation is still
 not crystallized and the more moderate fac-
 tion led by Teng H'sfao Ping needed the rec-
 ognition of the U.S. badly.
 There is an ominous parallel between the
 recently concluded agreement with China
 and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty of 1939;
 within days after both agreements, war be-
 gan-with new "security" alliances in hand,
 these adventurers proceeded with long held
 plans-aggression.
 It Is now clear that the PRC needed U.S.
 negotiation before attacking Vietnam.
 In the meantime, the priorities of the
 Carter Administration are SALT arms limi-
 tations with Russia and diplomatic rela-
 tions with China. Can we, trust 'the Com-
 munists? Instead of remaining strong and
 building on our alliances for peace through
 combined strength, we may be putting our
 neck in one communist lion's mouth to es-
 cape another-or maybe putting our neck in
 the mouths of both.
 Today, it appears that the central theme
 of our foreign policy is a President trans-
 fixed with SALT IL Our present policy of  .'
 comparatively unilateral disarmament and
 inaction is an invitation to war. Just as a
 deer is rendered motionless by the head-
 lights of a car on the road at night, Carter
 appears to be held hostage by the Soviet
 tactic of dangling goodies just beyond his
 reach, while they engage in ever bolder proxy
 aggression all around the world. SALT II
 may turn out to be another abortive Wash-
 ington Naval Conference of 1922 which was
 violated before the ink was dry and was a
 contributing cause to World War II.
 The best guarantee for peace is a strong
 defense, discouraging any potential aggres-
 sor, or as the Romans put it two thousand
 years ago:
 Si vis pacem, parat bellum (If you want
 peace, prepare for war.)  -
 The Russians, sensing our weakness after
 their unopposed proxy vistories in Angola,
 Ethiopia, South Yemen, Afghanistan and
 Cambodia, capitalizing on the turmoil in
 Iran, and watching us voluntarily give our
 own friends away in Taiwan, strategic South
 Africa, Korea, etc. must now feel the surge
 of destiny to be on their side.
 So, while the Russians now challenge us
 openly in Iran, Africa, and the Arab world,
 the Chinese who still help the Palestinians
 and the guerrillas in South Africa and Rho-
 desia, have recently asked us to get out of
 South Korea.
 Finally, the whole mosaic of these events
 and U.S. policy is coming into view. Ours are
 not the actions of a nation confident of the
 future, but one of defeat. It is becoming all
 do clear that we are, one by one, throwing
 out the children to the wolves, as in the old
 Russian sleigh-ride scenario. First Vietnam,
 now Taiwan and Iran. There is not much left
 to give away. Who may be next?
 The betrayal of our commitments toward
 Taiwan is not only abhorrent to the tradi-
 tion of honesty in the United States, but is
 also a very serious strategic mistake.
 Credibility is. the glue that holds together
 the governing structure of the United States
 and the system of alliances that defends the
 free world. It was credibility that seemed
 absolutely radiant in that enomrous smile
 and safety-accented series of assurances by
 an ex-Governor of Georgia and active church
 official, who kept promising that he would
 never mislead us. That is what he said: over,
 and over, and over again in his campaign,
 which began in 1974, two years before he was
 nominated and then elected.
 But Taiwan is not an isolated issue. The
 leaders of the free world are following with
 growing concern a series of actions of this
 Administration that affect the leadership role
 the United States used to play in the world.
 For the titular leader of the party of
 Franklin Roosevelt has now adopted policies
 more akin to that advocated by Charles
 Lindbergh and Senator Burton Wheeler In
 1940, and prior to December 7th of 1941.
 Commander-in-chief Carter, the Annapolis
 graduate; has gutted the very Navy that edu-
 cated him by recently cutting the Navy's
 five-year ship rebuilding by.more than half.
 And this at a time of the continuing emer-
 gence of the largest Russian navy in history
 and despite the fact that it takes 3 to 10
 years to build new Naval ships. Even if we
 begin today, we are in for scary times ahead
 because.. of the 1981-1985 gap when Soviet
 forces will clearly eclipse ours.
 The  Commander-in-Chief,  who  quite

 rightfully deplores our excessive dependence
 on imported petroleum, has just axed a nu-
 clear carrier which needs no such petroleum,
 and can operate for thirteen years without
 refueling.
 Without  getting  concessions  from  the
 other side, he has shot down the B-1 Bomber
 and shelved the Neutron Bomb. He has taken
 the lead in giving the Panama Canal to a
 Panamanian dictatorship which is the very
 antithesis of the human rights ideal to which
 Mr. Carter purports to be dedicated, and it is
 only now coming out that we will have to
 pay this dictatorship many millions of dol-
 `nars to run it.
 Carter's human rights policy has hardly
 been applied to the big, strong and most
 massively outrageous violators of human
 rights like the Soviet Union and its'satel-
 lites. Instead the Carter Administration joins
 that immoral rabble at the United Nations
 is repeated stompings of such nations as
 Chile, South Korea, the Philippines-South
 Africa; all the white ignoring the compara-
 tively mountainous violations of the Soviets
 and the battalion of dictatorships and one-
 party governments that afflict many coun-
 tries in Black Africa.
 President Carter may have gotten his Mid-
 dle Test Breakdown off the front pages last
 December, but this diversionary Taiwanese
 backstabbing has made the Middle East
 crisis more acute. For Israel is reappraising
 the value of American guarantees for its
 security in the light of the proposed Israeli-
 Egyptian treaty.
 Comments in many other parts of the
 world are along the same line. Japan has for
 some time questioned the ability-or will-
 of the United States to repel a Russian at-
 tack against the Japanese Islands. So Japan
 is rearming, understandably, in view of the
 Jimmy Carter Retreat from Taiwan and from
 Korea and from moral and military leader-
 ship all over the world.
 Saudi Arabia, perceiving the inadequate
 support given by the U.S. to 'the Shah of
 Iran is considering changing its so-far nega-
 tive stance toward the Soviet Union.
 Somalia, a major defection from the Soviet
 camp, has not received the help it needed
 from the West and there are indications
 it is quietly preparing to return to its former
 masters.
 Certainly, Mexico did not seem to be im-
 pressed by our fidelity as a friend or by the
 role we have played in recent world affairs.
 when it snubbed our President on his recent
 oil -groveling trip.
 In  an  even more  serious  development,
 Western Europe seems to be on its way to-
 wards more independent, if not competitive,
 policy-making, disenchanged with U.S. In-
 decisiveness in world political, economic and
 military affairs. There are a number of new
 initiatives.  Deeply  concerned  with  the
 chronic weakness of the dollar (to a large
 extent due to the lack of confidence of
 world business in the present Administra-
 tion), the EEC announced the creation of
 a European monetary system. Due to their
 diminishing trust in the strength and deter-
 mination of the U.S. military power, West-
 ern Europe has adopted for the past years
 a more conciliatory -position towards the
 Soviet Union. Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of
 Gerxhany recently advocated an even closer
 relationship  with  the  Soviets.  President
 d'Estaing of France has now suggested the
 f rmation of a new bloc that would include
 the EEC, Japan, the OPEC and the African
 countries,  to  counter-balance  the   U.S.-
 Soviet-Chinese influence and what they feel
 is a diminishing U.S. role in this triangle.
 A badly managed foreign policy weakens
 the dollar and the competitive position of
 American business overseas and affects our
 economic life through the balance of pay-
 ments. In the long run, a bad foreign policy
 can threaten the security of our country.
 We are now obligated to face two rather
 burning questions, whose time has come-
 in what ought to be a moment of truth:
 Is an end of the United States as a world
 power in sight? And, who stands behind us
 to carry the mantle of freedom? Are we in'
 the end battle between forces advocating
 "Command" economies (socialists, commu-
 nists and totalitarians that would dictate
 what the citizens needs should be), and
 "Demand" economies, that permit individual
 choice?
 What is the solution?
 In the best tradition of American demo-
 cracy, we all have the right and duty to
 speak out on these issues and try to in-
 fluence them through the established chan-
 nels. We must begin today in the precious
 moments of freedom we may have left to
 rebuild our strength, as a clear signal to
 potential aggressors, so that we can indeed
 live in peace we must hug closer to us every
 potential ally. We would do well to reverse
 as soon as possible that attitude so widely
 held among our allies that we only embrace
 new "old enemies" and will sacrifice at the
 drop of the hat any "old friend" as long
 as it is expedient for us.

 So the conference report was agreed to.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I move to
 reconsider the vote by which the con-
 ference report was agreed to.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I move
 to lay that motion on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 WAIVER OF SECTION 402(a) OF CON-
 GRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT-CON-
 SIDERATION OF S. 349
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that the Senate
 proceed to the consideration of Calendar
 Order No. 52, Senate Resolution 105, the
 congressional budget waiver.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The reso-
 lution will be. stated.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 read as follows:
 Resolved, That pursuant to section 402(c)
 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
 provisions of section 402 (a) of such Act are
 waived with respect to the consideration of
 ?S. 349. Such waiver is necessary because
 S.  349  authorizes the  enactment  of  new
 budget authority which would first become
 available in fiscal year 1979, and such bill
 was not reported on or before May 15, 1978,
 as required by section 402(a) of the Con-
 gressional Budget Act of 1974 for such au-
 thorizations.
 Compliance with section  402(a)  of the
 Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was not
 possible in this instance because the Coun-
 cil on Wage and Price Stability was desig-
 nated to monitor the administration's vol-
 untary wage and price standards. This ex-
 panded role was not foreseen at the time the
 previous authorization was approved.
 The effect of defeating consideration of
 this authorization will be to impede seriously
 the monitoring of the voluntary wage and
 price standards which are key elements of
 the administration's anti-inflation program.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the request of the Senator
 from West Virginia.
 Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, reserving
 the right to object, might I ask the dis-
 tinguished majority leader if it is his
 intention to have us vote on the budget
 waiver resolution this afternoon?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes. We are
 going to have 1 hour on the resolution
 under the law so there would be a vote.
 Whether it is a voice vote or not is
 entirely up 'to the Senate.
 Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I have no
 request on this side for a record vote.
