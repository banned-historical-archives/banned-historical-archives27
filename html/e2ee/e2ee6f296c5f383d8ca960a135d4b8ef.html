 Briefly Noted
 Captive Churches - See Guidance #406. It is reported that the Soviet Zone
 Evangelical Bishops have protested to Otto Grotewohl, Chairman of the Soviet
 Zone Council of Ministers against the stopping by the People's Police of Bishop
 Krummacher's visit to Berlin.      This was the third East German move within
 a week aimed at strangling the Evangelical Rally planned simultaneously for
 East and West Berlin.
 Kremlin Further Extends the Death Penalty - See Guidance #387.  On I
 July, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a law, replacing
 that of 6 May 1961, adding large-scale currency speculation, or smaller scale
 speculation following a previous conviction, to the list of crimes punishable by
 death. (Other crimes previously punishable by death under the 6 May and
 earlier decrees were also listed, with the exception of the terrorization of
 prison camps by confirmed or dangerous criminals; this last was not
 mentioned.)
 Czech Airliner Crashes. On 12 July, a Czech airliner on its way from
 Prague to Conakry crashed in flames at Casablanca. On board, were 24
 Russians, including Soviet air instructors, 18 Czechs, 6 East Germans and one
 Chinese.  Litter found near the plane included a book on Cuba's struggle
 against "demons", propaganda leaflets and a history of African slavery.  This
 was part of a cargo of Communist documentary films and pamphlets for
 distribution in Africa. We point out that under the guise of bringing friendly
 help to developing African nations, the Communist s pursue their main
 objective which is to subvert the minds of the people so as to instill further
 discontent until such time as they can kindle their own revolution which will
 overthrow the present nationalist leaders of African countries.  The
 Communists have never been interested in fostering national aspirations but
 are intent in creating Communist states which will be subservient to Moscow
 or Peking.

 406.  Communism ands :Ii ion -The Captive Church
 17 July 1961
 e recent convening in                                                                                    rague o a    rist an Peace
 Conference-is illustrative of the total cynicism of the Communist assault on
 religion in the name of scientific atheism. In Poland, in East Germany and in
 Russia itself there is ample evidence that the Communists have deliberately
 set out not to destroy religious organizations and denominations but to subvert
 them. The effort is to sever all denominational and organizational ties with the
 W1 ' Test, while at the same time directing the spiritual motivation of priest and
 layman toward acceptance of Communist dogma. The Russian Orthodox Church
 offers an excellent example of this. In return for comparative freedom from
 interference with normal religious activity, in marked contrast to the brutal
 suppressions directed against Muslims, Roman Catholics and Protestant sects -
 the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church follows closely the Communist
 Nine of the superiority of life in Russia. Quite recently, Alexei, Patriarch of
 the Russian Church, toured the Eastern Mediterranean, openly seeking to assert
 the leadership of the Russian Church in Orthodox circles and at the same time
 promoting the straight Communist line. In East Germany, a protracted struggle
 has been taking place between the Ulbricht Regime and the Evangelical Church
 to force severance of the Church's ties with West Berlin and West Germany and
 to enforce the dominance of the East German State. In Poland, unsuccessful in
 their efforts to bring the Roman Catholic Church to heel, the Gomulka adminis-
 tration organized and keeps promoting the Polish National Catholic Church,     25XIC10b

 '!  July 1961
 Uruguayan Conference and the Alliance for Progress
 Background:  The Inter-American Economic and Social Council
 (IA-ECOSOC of the Organization of American States (OAS) will hold an extra-
 ordinary session at Punta, del Este, Uruguay, beginning on 5 August, to discuss
 specific steps in implementing the September 1960 Act of Bogota and the Alliance
 for Progress program (See Bi-Weekly Propaganda Guidance Item #368, Issue
 #62, dated 27 March 1961, and Item #388, Issue #66, dated 22 May 1961).
 Delegations from 20 of the 21 American Republics are expected to attend,
 including probably Cuba but excluding the Dominican Republic. Invitations to
 send observers have also been extended to Canada, the West Indies and the
 members of both the European Economic Community and the European Free
 Trade Association and also to Japan and Spain.
 The meeting will discuss procedures and machinery required to plan social
 and economic development projects, The Act of Bogota of September 1960
 assigned to IA-ECOSOC the task of holding annual meetings, of which the August
 one in Uruguay is the first, to analyze and discuss the progress of member
 states in these fields as well as to make plans for the future, On 14 March 1961,
 President Kennedy announced his Alliance for Progress plan in a speech to
 Latin American diplomats and their wives at the White House in Washington
 D. C. One month later, in an address .to the Council of the OAS, also in
 Washington, he suggested that the IA-E COSOC meeting be the means by which
 the Alliance for Progress be implemented. Plans for the IA-ECOSOC meeting
 in Uruguay have been developed over the last three months. The agenda was
 approved by the Council of the OAS on 28 May 1961. It deals with the following
 broad topics: economic and social development planning, Latin American
 economic integration, export commodity market problems and procedures for
 annual review of progress and for information and public relations. The OAS
 Secretariat, the IA-ECOSOC and the Inter-American Development Bank have
 cooperated iu;;providing a planning staff consisting of economists from through-
 out the hemisphere to handle the agenda of the meeting and, it is expected, to
 comprise a permament "planning for progress" staff. The US Ambassador to
 the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson, traveled through Latin America in June
 1961, on behalf of President Kennedy, interviewing Latin American leaders
 concerning the plans for the August meeting. He reported general agreement
 and considerable enthusiasm for the Alliance for Progress concept.
 The United States delegation to the meeting at Punta del Este will be
 headed by Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon. It is expected that other
 member countries will also be represented at the ministerial level. President
 Kennedy has been invited to attend by the government of Uruguay, but has not   25X1C10b

 408.        Communists Exploit Book Needs of Underdevelope Countries
 Background: 1960 marked an upsurge in the Soviet production of books in
 non-bloc languages in a program to export to other countries, particularly
 the underdeveloped ones, a prejudiced, limited and falsified picture of the
 world. In 1955-1956 the Communists began a concerted attack on underdeveloped
 countries to penetrate schools, libraries, and other facilities devoted to
 knowledge, with books which paraded as the normal, respectable work of
 educators, scientists and scholars. While some of the books are objective texts,
 for example scientific, the rest (including language books) carry material
 slanted to support the Soviet point of view and institutions and anti-American
 and anti-religious themes in an increasingly militant vein. The program devotes
 a growing proportion of books to children, with the aim of creating a demand
 for Soviet books among them and suggesting shared, common interests with
 Communists,
 The Soviet program was stepped up by nominal increases of about 5%
 until 1960 when the completion of new publishing facilities made a 33 1/3 percent
 increase possible to take care of the "increasing demands" for foreign language
 publications resulting from their /ovie7"broadening of cultural ties and trade
 contacts. 11 The Soviet program in-1960 amounted to 40 million books in non-Bloc
 languages published in the USSR and 100 million books published abroad by
 Communistsor pro-Communistsunder contract to Soviet organizations for local
 distribution. The Satellites and Communist China further increase this already
 substantial and cumulative effort. Communist China, for example, which has
 placed great emphasis on the expansion of its foreign publishing facilities,
 produced between 10 and 13 million books in foreign languages, and its export
 firm Guozi Shudian of Peking has contracts with an unknown number of local
 publishing houses. While the heaviest production is in the so-called international
 languages (English, German and French), the scope of publishing covers some
 30 languages, seven of w hich were added in 1960.                                 25X1C10b

 409. Communist War. Threats and Communist "Peace and Disarmament"
 25X1 C10b Props; panda
 Background:  During the last several years, Khrushchev & Co. have been
 proclaiming "peaceful co-existence" and have promoted various disarmament
 schemes, from a ban on nuclear weapons and an "atom-free" zone in central
 Europe (Rapacki Plan) to Khrushchev's grandiose "universal and total disarma-
 ment" proposal, submitted to the UN General Assembly last fall. Moreover,
 the Soviet Government took certain unilateral initiatives -- e. g. unilateral
 cessation of nuclear tests, reduction of military manpower, and so forth. The
 a,,Dlitical and psychological impact of these moves was vastly enhanced by the
 the fact that the Soviets gave very little publicity to their defense measures,
 armament production, tests, etc. , while the free press and other media of the
 Western world provided full -- and often sensationalized -- news, pictures and
 commentaries about the arms, military research and plans of the US and of the
 other NATO powers. All this facilitated intensified propaganda campaigns for
 peace and disarmament, increasingly carried out not only by the Communist-
 controlled WORLD PEACE COUNCIL and its national and local affiliates,
 but also supported by non-Communist organizations such as the US "National
 Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, " the British "Committee for Nuclear
 Disarmament" and several other, similar groups. Khrushchev's ostensible
 posture on these vital peace and disarmament issues gained also considerable
 support from neutral and non-aligned governments. Prominent among the latter
 is India -- which also hopes to secure continued Soviet support against the
 aggressive intensions of Communist China.
 Even though his foreign policies in past years were not actually peaceful,
 either (Red Army suppression of the Hungarian revolution, threat of armed
 intervention in the Suez affair 1956 and in the Iraq-Lebanon crisis 1958, "bomb
 rattling" over the tL.2 incident and over Cuba, etc.) his most recent threats of
 using armed force -- in order to end the freedom of West Berlin, formally
 guaranteed by all NATO powers -- are even more ominous. His latest moves in
 this direction are increase of the open Soviet military budget by more than 3
 billion dollars, revocation of all military manpower cuts, the spectacular fly-past
 of an entire galaxy of new, advanced models of supersonic jet aircraft, as well
 as his unwillingness to negotiate in good faith on either the nuclear test ban or
 the neutrality of Laos, delivery of M

 410.  THE BERLIN CRISIS AND ITS INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS
 NOTE:  This guidance has been prepared p r i o r to definite
 policy decisions on the free world's policy countering recent
 Communist moves, in order to give assets in all areas suffi-
 25X1C10b                      cient general guidance for the treatment of this crucial subject.
 Background:  German y was a focal point for Communist efforts even
 before the October revolution. Lenin and his associates were convinced that, in
 line with the doctrines of Marx, a proletarian revolution could win only in an
 industrially advanced country. When they succeeded, nevertheless, in seizing
 power in Russia first, they continued to feel very strongly that the future of their
 regime depended upon a successful revolution in Germany. The Soviet regime,
 therefore, sponsored no less than three armed uprisings in Germany (1919, 1921,
 1923) and made persistent, desperate efforts to bring that country into her fold.
 Only after Lenin's death did Stalin accept "Socialism in one country": but the
 German Communist-Party remained the strongest CP outside Russia until Hitler
 smashed it in 1933 - a total defeat from which it has never recovered.
 World War II and its aftermath added to these ideological and historical
 motivations three weighty reasons for Soviet-Communist preoccupation with
 Germany andBarlin: (1) Soviet leaders and masses have not yet forgotten the
 impact of Hitler's invasion; (2) the East German Communist puppet regime can
 apparently not be successfully stabilized as long as the contrast between East and
 West Berlin demonstrates the inferiority of the Communist regime and permits a
 steady stream of East Germans (over 3 million since 1949, including many
 thousands of qualified workers, professional people, farmers and young men of
 military age) to escape the clutches of Ulbricht's inept and brutal dictatorship;
 (3) Khrushchev and other Communist leaders apparently feel the time ripe for
 another expansionist thrust against free Europe (Communism has made no progres..
 in Europe since the failure of the Berlin blocade in 1949) and consider Berlin, an
 isolated island of freedom 110 miles behind the Iron Curtain, the most promising
 point of departure for forcing the West into retreat or into acceptance of
 Communist terms.
 Since November, 1958, a series of diplomatic notes, speeches, propaganda
 barrages and "ultimata" from Moscow has reopened the Berlin question, dormant
 since the Soviets suffered one of their worst cold war defeats when their blocade
 of West Berlin failed (thanks to the Allied airlift and the steadfast morale of the
 Berliners). The, end of 1961 is the ultimate deadline and there is an increasin 1
 ominous military threat (see Guidannp aanat                                     g z5X1C10b

 SUMMARY
 Most of the growth in the output of Communist books in 1960
 relates to the circulation of books in under-developed areas.  There
 were, moreover, indications that the program to penetrate under developed
 areas is of a long-range nature.         Many of the books published were con-
 cerned. with education and. Russian language study.  The Soviet Union
 increased its output in non-Bloc languages from thirty million to forty
 million, a large percentage of which were textbooks for under-developed
 countries.  The languages showing the largest gains were English--up
 50% to 1406 million; French--up 100% to 5.5 million; Spanish--up 130%
 to .n7 million; Arabic--up 75% to  2 million and Indonesian--up 200%
 to .03 million.  Seven new languages were added: Farsi9 Farsi-Kabu19
 Tamil, Tagalog, Panjabi, Amharic, and Burmese.  The Chinese Communists
 published from about 1/4 to 1/3 as many books in non-Bloc languages
 as did the Soviet Union.
 Ubile the Sino-Soviet Bloc concentrated its efforts on production
 of language books and textbooks.there'was no decline in propaganda and
 ideological books.  The propaganda content was heavier and the ideological
 tone apparently more militant,,. There-was an increase in books by Marx,
 Engels, and Lenin, and propaganda books by new Soviet authors concurrent
 with a decline in literary works by Russian olasaical authors--L. Tolstoy,
 Dostoevski, and Turgenev.  Anti-American themes were stronger than in
 recent years.  Many books were published which were designed to undermine
 Western unity. And the Soviets initiated an anti-religious campaign with
 a number of books in the French language attacking Christianity.
 Despite the magnitude of the publishing program of the foreign
 languages publishing houses in various Bloc countries the majority
 of the millions of copiee of books the Sino-Soviet Bloc distributes
 thro~ighout the world is ]published by local publishers. in various
 countries under contract-'with such export organizations as
 Mezhdunarodnaya Ifni as of Moscow and Guozi Shudian of Peking.  The lists
 of aommuni ~acoks available in various ocaun-tomes generally contain
 about three titles published by indigenous Communist or pro-Communist
 publishers.. to.. one. .tit1e...pub1ihsd. within the..Bloc..__. Some indication of
 the scope of these operations is given occasionally.  The Soviet Union
 claims that it has about 100 million copies published abroad each year--
 two and a half times the figure of 40 million published inside the USSR.

 INTRODUCTION
 The output of books by the Soviet Union, in non-Bloc languages
 increased in 1960 by about one-third over 1959.  This compares with
 an annual average increase of less than five percent over the past
 several years.  The sudden upsurge in 1960 is probably the result
 of new production facilities which it is believed were completed
 in.1959?  In any event in 1959,.. the Soviets reported that new facilities
 which were under construction at Kriukov (22 miles NW of Moscow) would
 "allow complete fulfillment of the needs in publishing of literature
 in foreign languages which could only be half met by former typesetting
 facilities."  The additional facilities were needed, it was said, because
 of "increasing de*nds" for foreign language publications as a result
 of "broadening of cultural ties and trade contacts."  (Table I reflects
 this increaseo)
 In addition to the overall  increase of about one-third in the
 output of gooks in foreign languages, some significant aspects appear
 to be 1) particularly large increases in so-called international languages--
 English and French--which went up about 50% and 100% respectively; 2) In-
 creases ranging from 50% to 125% over the past several years in Spanish,
 Arabic, and Indonesian; and 3) the addition of seven new languages--Farsi,.
 Farsi-Kabul, Tami],, Tagalog, Panjabi, Amharic and Burmese--to the publishing
 program. The Soviets in 1961 plan to add Swahili to this list and expand
 their efforts in Amharic.  These developments appear particularly important
 because they all are related to the increased circulation of Communist
 subsidized books in under-developed areas.
 Other Communist Bloc countries also have large-scale publishing progress
 in foreign languages although less information is available on their activities
 than those of the USSR.  It is estimated that the Chinese Communists publish
 about five or six hundred titles annually, each title appearing in an average
 of 20,000 copies.  Books appear in fifteen or sixteen foreign languages.
 Heavy reliance is placed on books in English.  For example a 1960 English-
 language catalogue of Guozi Shudian (International Book Trade) Peking, lists
 264 titles.  North Korea" cla ms that in 1960 its Foreign Languages Publishing
 House turned out 811,700 copies of books which were distributed in 90 countries,.
 And the Czechoslovak foreign languages publishing house Artia in 1960 published
 250 books in two million copies.  Sixteen foreign languages were represented,
 In addition to books in foreign languages the Bloc countries'also
 export large quantities of books in their own languages.  Particular
 targets are emigrant groups.

 I.  TRENDS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS
 Textbooks for Under-Developed Countries
 In 1960 the Soviet Union initiated a large-scale program of
 publishing textbooks in foreign languages for under-developed.countrieso
 Although in the past some Soviet textbooks have been published in foreign
 languages by local publishers in various countries, 1960 was the first..
 year in which Soviet publishing houses entered this field.  The books
 varied from objective textbooks on scientific subjects to those with
 varying freights of direct or indirect propaganda and indoctrination.
 Books in the former class included Electrical Engineering by A. Kasatkin
 and N. Perekalin; Textbook on Physio]    edited by       ov, and
 Theoretical Physics by Ao  ompaneyet0 At the other end of the scale
 were  such books  many of them with collective authorship) as
 Fundamentals of Marxist Philosophy, Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism,
 and  is o   o    ? Communist Party o    e Soviet   ion,   os  o- the
 remaining books were heavily s an     toward suppo   o  Soviet institutions
 or weightea toward the Soviet point of view.  The following were some
 textbooks in this class:  History of the USSR, The History of the Ancient
 size
 World, International Law, and Economic Geography of the          The
 oche o4 lions varied considers  y.  Thus English,, Spanish and French
 editions  an from 20,000 to 40,000 while Arabic editions ran to about
 5,000 copies.  This program appears to be expanding.  The 1961 schedule
 calls for the publication of over thirty textbooks in English alone.
 According to Soviet sources they will be mainly for students of secondary
 and higher schools in under-developed countries and will include such
 subjects as electronics, theory of physics, structure of atoms and
 molecules, electrical machines,, organic chemistry, and medicine.
 The long-range plans of the Bloc also were underscored by an ex-
 pansion in the output of language study books and textbooks for foreign
 countries,"  The Soviet Union put out books to promote the study of the
 Russian language abroad.  These included 40,000 copies of Easy Russian
 and 50,000 copies of Russian Language, Elementary Course, bo   -for English-
 speaking people, and Russian textbooks for Arabs,, Greeks, Vietnamese and
 Pushtu and Hindi-speaking students.  And the 100,000 subscribers of the
 Moscow Netts (published in English and French) got without charge a copy
 of  earn rg Ruseiano.The Chinese Communists published Fnglish, Russian
 and German is ftion? of Modern Chinese Reader for foreigners .studying
 Chinese.,. 9s well as English-Chinese Conversation, German-Chinese Conversation
 and French-Chinese Converse  on.
 The Anti-American.Theme
 The types of books put out by the Bloc were wide and impressive,
 ranging from theoretical works by the founders of Communism to innocuous
 children?s books,  Some features were added, however, to the usual output
 of foreign language books by the Bloc,  One of the most important was
 Soviet publication of a number of back with strong anti-American thaws.

 Many were.designed to create cleavages in Western unity.  Previously,
 this type of propaganda. was generally used in radio broadcasts, pamphlets,
 periodicsla,, etc., but net isrbooksa  For example a book entitled The
 A        Monopolies in the World Capitalist Market by S. Menshikorj a
 tie according toSoviet sources,examines such aspects-
 of Ur S. foreign trade policy as dumping, super-protectionism, the
 domineering attitude in respect to other capitalist countries, and.
 trade discrimination against the socialist camp."  The Basic Problems

 co on    sm.     to in 1960 books were published Which gave the Soviet
 line on the collapse of the summit- meeting,. the U_2 and RB-47 incidents, etc.
 As they have been doing for a number of years, the Chinese Communists
 also put out a number of books with strong anti-American themes such as
 Oppose U. S. O.cupation of Taiwan, Oppose U. S. Military Provocations in
 the   a wan r iti . ea anal 21ift Years or the Chinese People' s Volunteers'
 Rees [s ance : o American Ag&-.odsion          ng Korea*
 The Anti-Religious Campaign
 Another important development in 1960 was an assault on religion
 by the Soviet Ur}ion with a spate of books promoting atheism and attacking
 religion--particularly Christianity.  Books in this vein have been pub-
 lishMd before for foreign audiences but not in such volume and variety.
 For eumple., the only book published in foreign languages. on this subject
 in the last few years was an English edition of On Religion, by K. Marx
 and P. Engels.  This.book accordingto.:Soviet sources "ple6retically
 subethntiates atheism."  Apparently no foreign language book on this
 subjeiet was published in 1958 or 1959.  The following are some titles
 that appeared in 1960:  Darwinism and Religion,, by G. Gurev, On Religion
 and the Church, by G. Ple   nov, The Origin of Christianity, by        sman,
 and Modern      Vatican., by M.-Shei an.   s tar as can be determined, all of
 the i ove -oo s were published in the French language only.
 In this connection, the Soviet Union in 1958 published in several
 f oreigi languages a book entitled Religion in the USSR, by P. Solovyov.
 It maintained that complete 'vligIo a freedom ;jN    in the USSR.
 Soviet.: publishers plan to publish in 1961 a photographic albino, .Islam
 Monu!ehts in the USSR, with captions in several foreign languages.
 Growing Militancy in Communist Books
 It; appears that in 1960 the volume of propaganda in book form in-
 creased'  There was a substantial increase in the number of "Soviet
 Claesiee"...authored by M. Gorky, A. Tolstoi, M. Sholokhov, A. Fadeyev
 and A* Malcarenko.  Books in this series are often heavily laden with

 Approved. FoNRelease 2001/11/16 -CIA-RDP78-0306'FM00100040003-5
 -3-
 propaganda materials.  The increase in this series was at the expense
 of "Russian Classics," which declined sharply.  Until 1960 the Foreign
 Languages Publishing House, Moscow, had published about 20 to 30 titles
 annually by classical Russian authors such as Lo Tolstcye Dostooveki
 ark ,Turgenev.  Whereas in 1960, only two such titles were.pub],ished;
 Three Tears by Anton Chekhov (in Urdu) and On the Eve by Ivan Turgenev
 (in Bengali).
 Moreover the propaganda tone was more militant in other series
 put out by the Sovietsin 1960.  The number of Communist theoretical
 works also increased.  The series, "Works by the Founders of Marxiov-
 Leninism," contained the first six volumes of a projected forty,-one
 v oiunie edition of the Collected Works of Lenin which is being pub-
 lished.in English.  A number of volumes o  t  s collection were also
 published in French and Spanish. Altogether about fifty books by
 these authors (Marx, Engels and Lenin) were published in foreign
 languages, compared to about thirty over the past few years.  The
 series "Books on the Soviet Union" contained such titles as Ivanovo
 Outstrips Mancheater(comparing.the USSR?s and Britain's text le -in-
 dustries); When t e USSR'Overtakes and Surpasses the USA; Economic
 Cotipetition-Ee weer   e U    an   S ; a   a host of books on e
 -year pan.
 Soviet space accomplishments and propaganda on the Soviet version
 of atomic weapons control were emphasized in the "Natural Science and
 Popular Science" series by a number of books, the titles of. which speak
 for themselves.  Included were The Soviet Sputniks, Reports from the
 Twenty.First Century  The Cosmic Roc a s,  uc ear Explosions-a World-
 Wide Hazard, and die   c en  s a on -Me Danger oof_Nuc ear Tests .    so
 in this series 'were books in Which   e propaga    was no  so Sant but
 which nevertheless emphasized Soviet scientific accomplishments.  Some
 of these were:  The Friendly Atom and Conquering the Atom (on the Soviet
 atomic power indu'tIyI   ; Earth and
 Sky;  n erp  netary   avel; and The
 Universe.
 Books for C  ldren
 As,the foregoing program of textbook publishing implies, one of
 the Soviet motives Is to arouse-the interest of the world's youth.
 To achieve this objective the.USSR also published a large number of
 books for children.  These books are printed in the languages of , the.
 countries whore they are to be distributed as well as in so-called
 international languages such as English and French,  In 1960, children's
 books ii rs,publishes.in more non-Bloc languages than were books in any

 other category,1  Of the approximately 50 titles published, twelve
 Free World languages were represented.2  By comparison books in the
 series "Works by the Founders of Marxism-Leninism," appeared in nine
 languages and "Books on the Soviet Union".appeared in eight.
 Often very attractively produced, some of these books contain
 no direct propaganda while others are heavily laden with it;  Most
 books fall somewhere between these two extremes.  It.appears that
 the propaganda burden generally varies. directly with the age of the
 children for whom the books are intended.  To cite some eximples:
 The Doughnut from the Wood with a Prickly Hood by Vitaly Bianki
 t rom the Soviet CCh l  -n. s    ,.rary for      Tots) is' about a doughnut
 (actually a hedgehog disguised as a doughnut) being chased in.turn by
 a bear, a wo]f, , and a fox, 'The simple story describes how the hedgehog
 fooled the bear and wolf but-not the fax,  Sump and Cry-Baby (for
 school-age children) by V. Chaplina is a atoxy of  wow subs.  The
 book tells about their life in the Moscow Zoo, their attendance at an
 animal kindergarten, and the experiences of one of them at a Young
 Pioneer camp.  The Soviet Young Pioneer (for older children) describes
 deeds performed by members o`this. organization in economic construction
 and emphasizes their spirit of humanitarianism and self-sacrifice.  Its
 role as a'state organ is not depicted.
 Other stories on. the order of the above carry no direct message,
 But they have a Soviet setting with characters whose morality is beyond
 reproach.  Others are not situated_in.any particular locale but carry
 a good moral these.  Thus, it appears that some children's books are
 published as a part of a long range plan to create a demand, or liking.
 for Soviet books, and to suggest shared, universal interests.
 Books on Music, Art, Theater, etc.
 To present evidence of what the Soviets describe as the "most
 advanced culture in the world" a wide range of.books have in the
 past been printed on cultural institutions. and subjects.  Included
 in this category in 1960. were Soviet.Music, The Bolshoi Ballet, and
 The Moscow Theaters.  The number of  ties published   the series,
 11here is very little information on the number of copies in which
 these books appeared, since most were for free distribution.  The
 Soviets do not ordinarily reveal the number of copies printed if
 they are for distribution without charged  Therefore, most of the
 children's books published are perforce not included in Table I
 which lists the total recorded output of Soviet books in various
 languages.
 zThe Chinese Cc.gsunists have available about the same number of
 titles,(. O) in eight Free World languages.

 "Soviet Arts," however, declined in 1960, possibly because the Soviet
 goverment preferred the direct. approach in advertising culture--i.e.,
 sending artistic troupes on tours abroad,  For several years the Soviets
 have published twenty or more books annually in the "Art Series",. (renaaed
 "Soviet Arts" in 1960) but it appears that only the three foregoing titles

 Union0. They are in color and have captions in 5 languages (English,

 II.  BOORS PUBLISHED ABROAD FOR THE BLOC
 Books printed in Bloc countries in foreign languages are only.a
 fraction of the total distributed abroad.  The largest percentage
 probably is printed in foreign countries under contract with such
 firms as the Soviets Union?a Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga (International Book)
 and Peking?a Guozi Shudian, the official booc~axport organizations of
 the respective co           A Moscow broadcast of October 20, 1958 stated
 that 9,000 titles of Soviet books had been published abroad since the
 first of that year.  The broadcast did not reveal the number of copies
 produced.  In 1936 however, 9,000 titles were produced outside of the
 Soviet Union in a total of 100,0002,000 copies; between 1951 and 1953,
 94,000,000 copies were printed.  It is likely that Bloc countries have
 more books printed abroad in foreign languages than they print them-
 selves; the book catalogues of Communist or pro-Communist firms in
 various countries generally list more titles published by local presses
 than by Bloc. presses.  For example, the Montevideo, Uruguay firs,
 Ediciones Pueblos Unidos, distributes books published by its own
 presses,        or a es  arias, also of Montevideo and by the Foreign
 Languages Pu   sing   Dues,  .scow.  In the 1960 Edioiones Pueblos
 Unidos catalogue, only about one-third (275) of de titles Vy So`viert
 authors were published in the USSR while the balance (500) were put
 out by the presses of Ediciones Pueblos Unidos and Editorials Varias.
 However, books by Sovie  au  ors aceoun  for only abo-ut half o    e
 titles listed in the catalogue.:,  The balance is made up of books by
 authors from Communist China, the Satellites, Latin America, etc.
 It was noted that altogether the 1960 catalogue contained about. 1600
 titles compared to 1200 in 1958 and 800 in 1957.
 The large nuatker of titles in this catalogue by Chinese Co unist,
 and Satellite authors mall of which were printed in Uruguay--indicates
 that other Bloc countries as well as the Soviet Union have a substantial
 number of their books printed abroad.
 The most unusual publication and propaganda operation of the Bloc
 was that carried on by the "Seven Seas Publishing Houses" in East Berlin.
 The firm was established two years ago as an organization to publish
 books i.n English primarily for export to India and the Middle East.

 III.  DISTRIBUTION AND PROMOTION
 Distribution Techniques
 The Bloc uses various methods to distribute its literature abroad.
 None involves the expenditure of foreign exchange by the recipient
 country.  One method consists of shipping books on consignment to
 local distributors at prices substantially below those listed in
 the catalogue.  When the books are sold 'payments are made to. the
 Bloc embassy in local currency.  Funds thus accumulated are used
 to finance additional publishing and other local communist activities.,
 Another method is to furnish books free to the distributor who pays.
 ascertain percentage of the profits from his operation to the local
 Bloc embassy, Communist party or friendship society.  In countries
 which prohibit imports of literature from Bloc countries, publishing
 is done by local publishers or required literature is sent via non-
 Bloc countries.  This makes it almost impossible for a given country
 to'prevent the importation of Communist.literature without carefully
 scrutinizing each book shipment.  For example, a'four-volume edition
 of the Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung published in Peking is also
 available  rom publishing houses in 1ew York, London, Bombay, Hong Kong,
 and Montevideo.
 By making literature available at nominal prices (about one-fifth
 the cost of conanerioally priced books), by aggressive promotional methods
 and by publishing standard works in a wide variety of languages'the
 Communists appear to have achieved wide distribution of their li.terature.
 The Bloc countries have exploited the acute scarcity of books,
 particularly in tinder-developed areas.  Unfortunately this shortage
 is growing more acute because of such factors as increasing literacy
 rates, high costs of book imports (and the related factor of tariff
 barriers), foreign exchange controls and high cost of establishing
 new publication facilities.  As stated earlier, the Bloc Countries
 have circumvented these controls by the establishment of indigenous
 book-publishing facilities.
 Promotional Devices
 In addition to standard advertising techniques such as the use
 of billboards, ads in newspapers and periodicals, etc., the Communists
 have devised other meth ode to.promote their literature.  Bloc libraries
 maintain exchange programs with libraries in other countries which
 augment the Communist distribution program and bring Bloc publications
 to the attention of influential audiences such as teachers and students.
 While library exchanges are an accepted channel for the exchange of
 information among countries throughout the world, the scope of the
 Communist program indicates that it is being exploited by the Bloc

 to serve their purposeso  The Lenin Library in Moscow claims that it
 exchanges books and periodicals with 2,200 institutions and organizations
 in nearly 100 countries.  Its clients include universities, seientfio
 and technical institutions in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Congo, Ghana,
 Cameroons, Guinea and many other African countries.  The Lenin Library
 reported agreements with 1,283 institutions in 1957; 1,800 in 1958;
 and 2,100 in 1959.  And the USSR Academy of Sciences sent over 5,00^
 books and magazines to 107 Indian scientific institutions, univeraties
 and libraries, receiving some 2,000 scientific works in return.  The
 Saltykov-Shchedrin Library in Leningrad has exchangsagreements with
 over 500 organizations in 55 countries.  Similar exchanges have been
 reported by other libraries in the Soviet Union as well as by libraries
 in other Bloc countries.l
 The Bloc also engages in an extensive book presentation program
 in under-developed countries.  For example, Soviet Charge d'affaires
 Kuznetsov presented 1,141 scientific books to the University of Indonesia
 as a gift from Khrushchev; the USSR Ambassador V. G. Yakovlev presented
 the Buddhist University in Kelaniya, Ceylon with 350 books as a gift
 from the Central Asian Lenin University in Tashkent, and the Soviet
 Charge daffaires in Bagdad presented the Iraqi Education Ministry
 with 161 cases of books and technical instruments as a gift from the
 Soviet goverment.
 Mention should also be made of book exhibits as a promotional
 device, particularly those held in conjunction with international
 trade fairs.  At most of the fairs or unilateral exhibitions held
 by the Bloc, book exhibits form an integral portion of the overall
 effort.
 Books exhibited at international fairs usually emphasize the.
 cultural climate and economic achievements of the regime as opposed
 to theoretical and political materials.  The latter, however, are
 listed in book catalogues on display and can be ordered.  The book
 section of a typical Bloc pavillion at an international trade fair
 might cover half of the cultural area which perhaps represents
 one-fourth or one-fifth of the total exhibit space used.  In addition.
 1The large number of scientific exchanges mentioned in reports of
 library exchanges indicates that these are important sources of
 scientific literature for the Bloc.  The Soviet Union reportedly
 spends 5'million (new) rubles annually to secure and examine
 i6,ooo publications from all over the world.  The work is done
 at the Institute of Scientific Information which publishes about
 50 periodicals covering all the major fields of science and technology.
