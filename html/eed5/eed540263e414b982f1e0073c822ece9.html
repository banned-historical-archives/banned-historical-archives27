 I-
 negotiator, although he has tried to
 salvage some credibility, especially with
 the leftists, by attempting to arrange a
 cease-fire  between  the Syrians  and
 Palestinians. The Syrians, who backed
 Sarkis for the presidency, apparently con-
 cluded that his position and theirs would
 be stronger in the long run if they succeed-
 ed in forcing the PLO to accept their con-
 ditions for a political accord.
 Egypt's President Sadat has condemn-
 ed the Syrian attack and called publicly
 for Sarkis and Arafat to meet with the
 leaders of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
 and Kuwait in a mini-summit to try to
 resolve the Lebanese conflict. Syrian
 President Asad is likely to resist pressures
 on him to attend such a gathering, at least
 until his forces have achieved their main
 objectives on the ground,
 Syrian forces in Lebanon and their
 Christian allies this week initiated a new
 military offensive aimed at dislodging the
 Palestinians from the central mountains.
 There are indications that Syria intends to
 mount subsequent drives to capture the
 port city of Tripoli and to cut off the flow
 of arms and other supplies moving from
 Sidon and Tyre to west Beirut-the main
 bastion of the Palestinians and their
 Lebanese allies-if the Palestine Libera-
 tion Organization does not bow to Syrian
 terms for a cease-fire.
 Within 48 hours after the attack began
 on September 28, Syrian forces were
 clearly gaining the upper hand. Several
 important Palestinian strongholds fell on
 September 29, including the villages of
 Aynturah and Tarshish, which control the
 road linking the Christian "capital" at
 Juniyah and the Syrian-occupied Bekaa
 Valley. The Syrians may plan to push
 west to occupy Alayh from where they
 can put pressure on leftist leader Kamal
 Jumblatt's Druze stronghold just a few
 miles to the south.
 PLO chairman Yasir Arafat sent
 urgent appeals to Egyptian President
 Sadat, Saudi King Khalid and other Arab
 leaders asking them to intervene and put a
 stop to the fighting.
 Syrian and Christian insistence on an
 unconditional Palestinian pullback from
 the mountains was one of the principal
 stumbling blocks in talks with Arafat just
 before President Sarkis' inauguration last
 week. Although the Syrians were con-
 vinced then that Arafat was stalling, they
 apparently had intended to give Sarkis
 more time to seek a negotiated settlement.
 A Palestinian commando attack on a
 Damascus hotel last weekend, however,
 gave them a pretext to resume the
 fighting.
 The Syrian offensive has damaged
 Sarkis'  standing as an independent
 7Soviets Continue To Hold Back Criticism
 The USSR continues to hold back
 criticism of Syrian actions in Lebanon.
 This week, it not only refrained from
 openly criticizing the new Syrian offensive
 in the Mount Lebanon area, but for the
 first time made a gesture of support for
 Syria's position.
 On September 22, Pravda carried a
 news report on President Asad's speech to
 his troops near the Israeli border. It in-
 cluded Asad's rationale for the presence
 of Syrian troops in Lebanon as well as his
 specific criticism of the role of the
 Palestine Liberation Organization in
 Lebanon.
 Any sign of support for Asad is bound
 to displease the PLO, which had already
 voiced misgivings about an "Observer"
 article in Pravda on September 8 up-
 braiding "leftist elements" of the PLO
 along with the Syrian government for fail-
 ing to achieve a cease-fire.
 The USSR seems to be facing the
 realities of the Lebanese situation. Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko told the UN
 General Assembly on September 28 that
 the Lebanese crisis would have to be set-
 tled by the Lebanese themselves without
 outside interference. A Soviet official in
 Cairo said last week, on the other hand,
 that the Soviets believe it is necessary for
 the Syrians to remain in Lebanon if a
 settlement is to be achieved.
 Soviet arms carriers continued to arrive
 at Syrian ports during August and

 RHODESIA    5- i1
 The announcement on September 29
 that the UK will convene a conference to
 discuss formation of an interim govern-
 ment for Rhodesia was doubtless welcom-
 ed by the "front-line" African presidents.
 They had been pressing for an early start
 to the process of developing the in-
 stitutions for majority rule in Rhodesia.
 The "front-line" presidents recognize
 that the continuing rivalry among Rhode-
 sian black nationalist factions could now
 become an especially unsettling factor as
 the prospects increase for negotiations
 toward majority rule.
 Robert Mugabe, who has emerged as
 the chief spokesman for ZANU, met this
 week in Lusaka with ZAPU represen-
 tatives. ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo,
 who has been in Rhodesia conferring with
 members of his faction, reportedly will
 join in talks when they convene soon
 Nkomo is more widely known ttiam
 Mugabe, and Nkomo's ZAPU apparently
 has a stronger political organization in-
 side Rhodesia than does Mugabe's
 ZANU. Most of the guerrilla forces are
 loyal to ZANU, but the faction's
 leadership is more fragmented.
 Although the two factions are under
 strong pressure from the presidents, their
 talks could be difficult, and there is no
 assurance that any alliance would last
 long. ZAPU will seek to protect its
 political position, while ZANU tries to
 exploit its greater military strength. In
 this vein, Mugabe told the press this week
 that the settlement proposals are unaccep-
 table unless the guerrilla forces take con-
 trol from the present Rhodesian army un-
 der an interim government.
 The third major nationalist leader,
 Bishop Abel Muzorewa, seems to have
 been excluded from the presidents' unity
 efforts.  Muzorewa has virtually no
 guerrilla forces of his own, but does have
 some political standing inside Rhodesia
 ANGOLA-USSR
 Angolan President Neto will pay an of-
 ficial visit to the USSR early this month,
 according to  an announcement  from
 Moscow. The visit will be in response to a
 Soviet invitation issued last May, when
 Angolan Prime Minister Nascimento was
 in Moscow seeking additional Soviet
 assistance. The USSR, along with Cuba,
 remains Angola's principal source of aid.
 Neto will use the visit to seek clarifica-
 tion of the Soviet role in An ola's
 development.
 rom the  oviet standpoint, Neto's
 visit probably could not be better timed. It
 presents Soviet leaders with an opportuni-
 ty to press their attack against US and
 British efforts toward a Rhodesian settle-
 ment.
 Neto will probably be cautious,
 however, about associating himself with
 any Soviet criticism that could put him
 out of step with other front-line African
 presidents because he values his newly
 acquired status as a member of their
 group.
 The visit could be offset somewhat by
 Angola's resumption of diplomatic ties
 with Portugal, which is likely at about the
 same time. The Angolan and Portuguese
 foreign ministers were to meet in Cape
 Verde on September 30 to work out final
 arrangements. Neto is anxious to re-
 sume the ties to balance his foreign
 relations and broaden his sources of
 assistance.

 ETHIOPIA  15-2
 The  assassination  attempt  on
 September 23 against Major Mengistu
 Hailemariam, the powerful  first vice
 chairman of the ruling military council,
 may have resulted from the council's
 crackdown on the extreme leftist Ethio-
 pian People's Revolutionary Party. The
 crackdown has been under way for several
 weeks.
 Mengistu was slightly wounded in the
 attempt, which occurred when his car was
 ambushed in Addis Ababa. The assailants
 escaped, but the military council clearly
 believes the Revolutionary Party was
 behind it.
 The party, an apparently well-organiz-
 ed clandestine organization, with its
 strength among trade unionists, teachers,
 and students, demands an immediate
 return to civilian rule. Its other goals
 differ little from those of the leftist
 military regime.
 Despite continuing arrests of party
 adherents and harsh attacks on the group
 in the government-controlled media, there
 were student demonstrations and
 numerous brief work stoppages in Addis
 Ababa last week. The council responded
 by threatening to shoot strikers and by
 bringing elite military units into the city
 to handle any additional demonstrations.
 The city has been quiet since late last
 25X1
 week; the reopening of schools, which the
 government feared would spark renewed
 unrest, was postponed.
 Some of the unrest in the capital last
 week may have been due to popular dis-
 satisfaction with the government's recent
 monetary reform program, which requires
 the exchange of old currency and imposes
 service charges for the redemption of bills
 of high denominations.
 The council's tough stand against the
 Revolutionary Party suggests that the
 regime takes seriously reports that the
 party has been gaining supporters-even
 within the armed forces-and that it in-
 tends to initiate a campaign of urban
 Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis
 Healey announced on September 29 that
 Britain would apply to the International
 Monetary Fund for $3.9 billion in ad-
 ditional credit in an effort to reverse the
 downward slide in sterling.
 According to Healey, the maximum
 amount Britain can still obtain under its
 credit arrangements with the IMF is $3.9
 billion. Last May, Britain borrowed $810
 million against its total limit of $4.7
 billion.
 Conservative Party leaders are blaming
 Labor for sterling's problems. Tory
 proposals to save the pound include
 massive public spending cuts and com-
 pulsory wage controls. Callaghan and
 Healey would prefer to avoid such a
 course for fear of alienating key trade un-
 ion allies whose support is instrumental in
 keeping potentially rebellious left-wing
 Laborites in line in Parliament.
 The IMF will probably press for con-
 tinued restraints on public spending and
 growth in the money supply. It may de-
 mand  fiscal measures beyond those
 already planned for the fiscal year begin-
 ning next April. Stringent measures call-
 ing for massive public spending cuts or tax
 increases, however, seem out of the ques-
 tion in the light of Britain's 30-year high
 unemployment level.
 While the IMF loan will allow the UK
 to repay $1 billion expended under a $5.3
 billion credit standby arranged by the
 Bank of International Settlements and the
 Group of Ten and once again intervene on
 the foreign exchange market in support of
 sterling, it will provide no long-lasting
 relief. In the first eight months of the year
 Britain spent over $5 billion in support of
 the pound but failed to keep sterling from
 dropping.
 Unless some major structural changes
 take place, there will continue to be a
 general lack of confidence in Britain's
 future, encouraging sterling holders to sell
 the  currency.           r -3? Q
 Labor Party Co erence
 Economic issues,including the run on
 sterling, were the focus of attention at the
 annual Labor Party conference this week.
 The debate, which was intense and often
 critical of the Callaghan government,
 reflected the clash between cherished
 socialist principles and stringent govern-
 ment economic policies designed to cope
 with recession and inflation. Other impor-
 tant conference topics were home rule for
 terrorism.
 Scotland, elections to the European
 Parliament, defense spending, race
 relations, nationalization, and education.
 Prime Minister Callaghan adroitly used
 preconference planning sessions to
 minimize the leftist minority's opportuni-
 ty to embarrass the government.
 Callaghan will be able to live with most of
 the conference's  recommendations on
 economic policy. The only real setback
 was a resolution calling on the govern-
 ment to reverse its plans to cut the
 1977-1978 budget.
 Conference decisions are not binding on
 Labor  administrations,  and  the
 resolutions this week are not likely to
 cause Callaghan to shift course. He may
 make some minor adjustments, but the
 government will continue to give priority
 to fighting inflation.
 The left wing demonstrated again its
 ability to harass the government and its
 allies in the Trades Union Congress, but
 as long as key union leaders like Jack
 Jones stick with Callaghan, he will be able
 to rein in potentially rebellious left-wing
 Laborites in Parliament.
 Government-union  tensions,
 nevertheless, are developing over un-
 employment and the hardships imposed
 by two wage-restraint agreements. The
 leftists sense the government's vulnerabili-
 ty on unemployment and are directing a

 telling attack on Callaghan over the high
 jobless rate that is still rising. If the
 leading economic indicators do not soon
 justify Callaghan's economic strategy, his
 union support will begin to ebb and left-
 wing influence will rise.
 The delegates elected a new nations ex-
 ecutive committee, shifting the center of
 gravity further left by one seat. The im-
 portant post of party treasurer, which
 Callaghan vacated after a ten-year in-
 cumbency, went to Norman Atkinson, a
 member of the left wing in the party's
 parliamentary delegation. Atkinson has
 been an acerbic critic of the government's
 economic strategy.
 The conference voted to set up a work-
 ing group to consider widening the elec-
 torate involved in selecting a Labor Party
 leader. The leader is now chosen by Labor
 members of Parliament in a secret ballot.
 Atkinson, who favors a more open
 process involving party rank and file, will
 use his new influence to advance this posi-
 Prime Minister Raymond Barre an-
 nounced September 22 his much heralded
 economic program that is aimed mainly
 at bringing the French inflation rate out
 of the double-digit range.
 The main features of the program are:
 ? A three-month freeze on most
 prices.
 v1'
 ? A package of fiscal measures that
 amounts to a moderate tax increase
 hitting higher income groups and
 business.
 ? Imposition of an anti-inflation tax
 on business.
 ? Slower monetary growth.
 ? Measures to increase investment
 in plant and equipment.
 ? A $1.2-billion aid package for
 drought-stricken farmers.
 Notable for its absence was any men-
 tion of controls on wages, which have
 been rising recently at a 17-percent annual
 rate. The government, however, will try to
 set an example in its own wage
 negotiations.
 The price freeze should have a positive
 short-term  impact,  holding  consumer
 price increases near zero during the last
 quarter of the year. To slow retail price
 increases after the freeze expires, the
 value-added tax will be cut on a wide
 range of products.
 Neither of these temporary measures,
 however, will directly affect the underly-
 ing causes of inflation.
 The real test of the program will come
 next spring.  Barre hopes that the pro-
 jected sharp improvement this fall will
 reduce  expectations about future infla-
 tion and thus induce both business and
 labor to behave more moderately.
 Tax increases-including a 4-percent
 boost in the corporate rate, and a 4- to
 8-percent increase for higher income in-
 dividuals-will also help somewhat, but
 are not sufficient in themselves to change
 the basic inflation picture. At best they
 may help bring the government budget
 back into equilibrium in 1977, following a
 moderate deficit this year.
 Potentially more significant is the new
 anti-inflation tax on business. A uniquely
 French innovation, the tax is intended to
 dissuade firms from raising prices and in-
 directly to force them to take a firmer
 stance in wage negotiations.
 On balance, the French inflation rate
 during 1977 should be lowered by the new
 program. The rate will still be high,
 however, possibly close to 10 percent.

 The USSR Supreme Soviet will meet in

 official announcement late last week. The
 main item on the agenda will be final ap-
 proval of the five-year plan (1976-1980),
 which was presented in draft form to the
 25th party congress last spring.
 By protocol, Premier Kosygin should
 address the meeting and present the plan.
 The announcement of a date for the ses-
 sion suggests that his doctors have deter-
 mined that he will be well enough to par-
 ticipate.
 Kosygin has not appeared in public
 since July 22
 General
 Secretary  Brezhnev told  former am-
 bassador Averill Harriman last week that
 Kosygin would be returning to work "in
 several weeks."
 The Supreme Soviet session will
 probably be preceded by a meeting of the
 party Central Committee to put the par-
 ty's stamp of approval on the five-year
 plan. A Central Committee plenum would
 also provide an opportunity to make
 changes in the top leadership.
 One change may be the promotion of
 Nikolay Tikhonov to Politburo mem-
 bership. He was recently appointed a
 first deputy premier, presumably to help
 lighten the workload of the ailing
 Kosygin. The appointment of Tikhonov
 to Politburo status would put him on a
 par with Kirill Mazurov, the other first
 deputy premier.
 We think Defense Minister Ustinov will
 be formally dropped from the party
 Secretariat. He has not been identified as
 a member of the Secretariat since he
 became defense minister last April

 Minority Government in Finland
 The three centrist parties of the old
 five-party coalition agreed this week to
 form a minority government with Martti
 Miettunen resuming his role as prime
 minister. The "new" coalition will have
 only 58 seats in the 200-seat parliament.
 The focus of attention in coming weeks
 will be the municipal elections on October
 17 and 18. The USSR will be watching
 these contests for signs of a conservative
 shift-similar to the one in Sweden
 recently-that could affect its relationship
 with the Finnish government. Polls this
 summer indicated a decline in the leftist
 parties' popularity and an increase in sup-
 port for the bourgeois parties in Finland.
 Negotiations in Sweden
 Sweden's three bourgeois parties con-
 tinued negotiations this week for a coali-
 tion government, and the signs suggest
 long-standing  differences  between  the
 Conservatives and the two centrist parties
 have not been resolved.
 Gosta Bohman, leader of the Conser-
 vative Party, has been excluded from
 some of the talks between the two centrist
 leaders. Thorbjorn Falldin, leader of the
 Center Party and likely new prime
 minister,  said  that  he  and  Liberal
 Party chief Par Ahimark must first
 agree on basic issues before holding
 extensive talks with the Conservatives.
 The Conservatives reportedly will not
 hold out for major concessions that might
 force the centrists to turn to an alliance
 with  the  Social  Democrats.  The
 negotiations may be difficult, but the
 three parties still hope to agree on a for-
 mal coalition before October 4, the
 deadline for announcing a government to
 the new parliament.

 CHINA  ~-5 _   r
 The Chinese leadership seems to be
 having  difficulty  resolving immediate
 issues less important than the succession.
 The mourning period for Mao Tse-tung
 has been extended-unofficially at
 least-until October 9, and this may give
 the leadership extra time to decide on the
 disposition of Mao's body. There are
 rumors within China that the remains will
 be placed on view in a mausoleum. The
 absence of an announcement to this effect
 may indicate some disagreement over the
 location-and perhaps over whether to
 preserve the body at all.
 The extended mourning period has also
 given the Chinese an official excuse to
 cancel the National Day celebrations of
 October 1. There may well be political
 motivations behind this decision. The last
 time these festivities were canceled was in
 1971, after the "coup" attempt by Lin
 Piao; the official explanation at that time
 was that the Chinese were trying to con-
 serve money.
 There has been some pulling and
 hauling-which began before Mao's
 death-over naming Politburo member
 Wu Te to the post of chairman of the
 National People's Congress, the defacto
 head of state. Although some foreign em-
 bassies in Peking have been advised that
 Wu is acting as chairman, he has only oc-
 casionally performed the duties of that of-
 fice.
 The party's left wing may be trying to
 block his promotion, which could entitle
 him to a place on the Politburo's elite
 Standing Committee. The Standing Com-
 mittee, which seems to be ruling China
 collectively, has only one rightist among
 its four members and two leftists.
 Some leftists have adopted a higher
 profile since Mao's funeral. Standing
 Committee member Chang Chun-chiao,
 the leader of the party's left wing, has
 been the most visible of Chinese leaders
 since the funeral and seems to be taking a
 more active role in foreign affairs. Mao's
 widow, Chiang Ching, received unusual
 media attention when People's Daily on
 September 25 carried numerous con-
 dolence messages addressed soley to her
 from foreign heads of state and their
 wives.

 Soviet Tone Conciliatory
 Soviet propaganda on China continues
 in the conciliatory vein adopted since the
 death of Mao Tse-tung.
 The marked shift probably is intended
 to encourage any of Mao's successors who
 may be inclined toward less hostile
 relations with the USSR, or failing that,
 at least to build a public case that the
 USSR has done everything possible to
 improve relations with China.
 Because it has no real idea where in
 China's bureaucracy the less anti-Soviet
 individuals are located, Moscow is trying
 to appeal to all Chinese who might figure
 in the succession struggle.
 To attract Chinese party members, the
 Soviets are praising the accomplishments
 of the Eighth Chinese Party Congress in
 1956. Government bureaucrats probably
 are the intended audience for Soviet
 propaganda  highlighting  past
 Soviet-Chinese cultural  and scientific
 cooperation and Moscow's role in the
 development of various sectors of China's
 industry.
 The Soviets have not neglected China's
 military, which they have long imaintained
 will probably be decisive in determining
 the outcome of the succession struggle.
 The USSR has also broadcast items in-
 tended to encourage the Chinese to
 reassess  the  Soviet-Chinese-US
 relationship and to exploit or create
 Chinese frustration with lack of move-
 ment in Sino-US relations.
 On September  16, for example, a
 broadcast to China gave details of an
 alleged recent increase in US military aid
 to the government on Taiwan and remind-
 ed the Chinese that the USSR had always
 supported China's "just demand" for the
 return of Taiwan.
 China's continuation of its anti-Soviet
 propaganda has apparently had little
 effect thus far on Soviet propaganda,
 probably because Moscow believes
 China's new leaders have not yet had time

 JAPAN-CHINA-USSR
 Foreign Minister Kosaka is sounding
 out China on the possibility of a com-
 promise      on  the  anti-hegemony
 clause-the implicitly  anti-Soviet for-
 mulation that is the only remaining
 obstacle to a Sino-Japanese peace and
 friendship treaty. Kosaka plans to discuss
 the topic with Chinese Foreign Minister
 Chiao Kuan-hua at the UN this weekend.
 Kosaka, long a supporter of com-
 promise on the hegemony issue, is highly
 regarded in Peking, and he apparently in-
 tends to inject some forward movement in
 relations with China. He reportedly won
 Prime Minister Miki's agreement to a
 free hand on China policy before accep-
 ting the post in Miki's cabinet three weeks
 ago.
 Miki himself said on September 27 that
 he sees no "fundamental difficulty" in in-
 cluding an anti-hegemony clause in the
 treaty, and he may hope that Kosaka's
 reputation combined with Chairman
 Mao's death and the new strains in
 Japan's relations with the USSR, will
 prompt some conciliatory response from
 Peking. We see no signs, however, that
 the Chinese intend to modify their in-
 sistence on unqualified Japanese accep-
 tance of the clause.
 Resistance from opponents of com-
 promise with China-and from Miki's
 own rivals within the Liberal Democratic
 Party-have stalled negotiations on the
 treaty for almost two years. Miki may
 now believe he can overcome the
 resistance and at the same time strengthen
 his own political position by successfully
 concluding the negotiations with China.
 Miki and Kosaka have also moved to
 be more accommodating to the USSR
 over the MIG-25 incident. In a meeting
 with Foreign Minister Gromyko at the
 UN on September 28, Kosaka confirmed
 Japan's intention to return the aircraft
 and reportedly reached agreement to
 begin negotiations in Tokyo over the
 details of the transfer.
 Japan has in general been tough in
 rebuffing Soviet pressure regarding the
 MIG-25. Miki's decision to be more ac-
 commodating may reflect his concern
 over Japanese press criticism that the
 government is being too harsh toward the
 USSR. The Prime Minister has main-
 tained all along that the incident should be
 settled  without damaging bilateral
 The settlement on September 22 of the
 year-old dispute over the nationalization
 of the US-owned Marcona iron-ore facili-
 ty buys some time for Peru to resolve its
 shaky financial situation.
 The settlement will spur an early agree-
 ment on the $350-million loan package
 that Peru has been negotiating for the past
 six months with private banks in Canada,
 Western Europe, Japan, and the US. The
 bankers had insisted on a resolution of the
 Marcona dispute before they would final-
 ly approve the loan. We now expect the
 loan agreement to be signed by mid-Oc-
 tober.
 The loan, which will be used in part to
 pay the settlement cost of $37 million for
 the Marcona properties, will obviate the
 need to reschedule debt service payments
 this year and will enable Peru to limit
 scheduled import cuts.
 The settlement will allow Peru to
 restore the Marcona facility to full  25X1
 production within two months,  after
 which iron ore shipments should yield
 about $120 million annually in export ear-
 nings.
 With the benefits of rising exports of
 iron ore and copper as well as expected
 self-sufficiency in petroleum,  Peru's
 current-account deficit is likely to drop 50
 percent in 1977 from $1 billion this year.
 Peru's petroleum import bill will be
 reduced from $200 million this year to $20
 million in 1977 as Amazon Valley oil
 projects and the Trans-Andean pipeline
 are completed.
 Next year, we expect Peru's gross
 national product to increase slightly, and
 rising supplies of imported and domestic
 goods should cause inflation to fall.
 Brazil: Tighter Control Over Economic Planning
 President Geisel, concerned with the
 rapidly mounting national debt and atten-
 tive to recent press disclosures of official
 corruption, appears to be tightening his
 control over economic planning.
 Geisel has decided on the following
 steps:
 ? Cabinet ministers are not to seek
 foreign funds without prior con-
 sultations  with  Geisel's  planning
 secretariat and the central bank.
 ? Any expansion of project costs,
 beyond limits approved by Geisel,
 must be reapproved by him.
 ? Projects  that  require foreign
 financing must stay within the limits
 already set for imports.
 Brazil's  current-account  deficit  has
 grown from about $1.5 billion in the early
 1970s to $6.8 billion in 1975 and will
 probably be around $5.8 billion this year.
 Financing these deficits drove the
 national debt from $10.2 billion in 1972 to
 $24 billion in 1975, and it is expected to
 reach $27 billion by the end of 1976. Ser- 25X1
 vicing its current debt obligation absorbs
 40 to 45 percent of Brazil's foreign ex-
 change reserves.

 Party chief Gierek and his colleagues are facing their most
 critical test. If they cannot bring about a demonstrable im-
 provement in the economy they will be unable to regain public
 confidence. They know another round of rioting like June's
 would almost surely end their tenure.
 X4.23
 The success of the Polish peop a in for-
 cing the regime to reverse its decision in
 June to raise food prices continues to be
 reflected in the tense political atmosphere
 in Warsaw.
 Party and government leaders are post-
 poning decisions on critical economic
 problems. At the same time, they are un-
 able to hide the fact that the decisions,
 when they do come, will confirm the
 public's worst fears. In increasingly frank
 terms, they are warning that a long period
 of belt-tightening is ahead. Tensions will
 remain high as the sullen and distrustful
 Poles watch the leadership struggle with a
 welter of problems of its own making.
 The badly shaken regime must
 somehow:
 ? Regain public confidence.
 ? Manage the politically explosive
 and economically urgent problem of
 raising prices.
 ? Overcome shortages of consumer
 goods, especially meat.
 ? Proceed with economic develop-
 ment at a time when the burden of
 hard-currency debt looms ever larger.
 In Eastern Europe, shortages of food
 and consumer goods and the problem of
 keeping prices at subsidized levels are not
 confined to Poland. It is in Poland that
 these problems have the greatest potential
 for creating severe political instability.
 A Long History
 The Poles have a history of conten-
 tiousness. During the 19th century, when
 the country was occupied by foreigners,
 Poland: Troubles Ahead
 Poles came to regard civil disobedience as
 a patriotic virtue essential to the
 re-emergence of the Polish state. The
 period between the world wars was too
 brief and chaotic to alter these beliefs, and
 opposition to authority again became
 standard after the Communists took
 power.
 Although Communist rule is accepted
 as a fact of life, the party has never been
 fully accepted. Many, if not most, Poles
 believe the party rules Poland only
 because the Soviet Union is its neighbor.
 Under these circumstances, perhaps the
 only way the party can achieve legitimacy
 in the eyes of the public is to provide a
 continuously improving level of living.
 When Edward Gierek became party
 chief in December 1970, he launched a
 program to attain rapid economic growth
 that required massive imports of Western
 capital goods. Investment boomed and
 Poland achieved an annual economic
 growth rate of 7 percent. Frequent wage
 increases and controlled prices enabled
 the real personal income of the average
 Pole to grow by 9 percent a year.
 Consumption increased sharply, but
 because the regime was unable to provide
 enough attractive consumer durables, a
 large share of the growth in consumption
 went into food. Consumption of meat,
 supported by the growth of the domestic
 fodder base, increased about 32 percent
 between 1970 and 1975.
 The population has become ac-
 customed to rates of increase in food con-
 sumption that are no longer sustainable.
 Compounding the problem since 1974 has
 been bad weather, which resulted in a
 decline in grain and fodder output needed
 to support meat production.
 The Polish leadership, with the events
 of 1970 very much in mind, was unwilling
 to take the plunge and raise food prices
 until June of this year. Former party
 leader Gomulka fell because he raised
 prices in 1970. Gierek, on coming to
 power following widespread and bloody
 rioting, restored the old prices. They have
 not risen since, despite burgeoning food
 subsidies that rose from less than 6 per-
 cent to 14 percent of budget outlays
 between 1970 and 1975.
 The  Poles would probably have
 accepted small price rises over the past
 few years with only a moderate amount of
 grumbling, but party leaders waited until
 June. Then they compounded their earlier
 mistake by announcing very high in-
 creases.
 Their decision clearly caught the public
 off guard and was almost certainly taken
 without close soundings of either the party
 rank and file or the public at large. The
 ensuing riots forced withdrawal of the
 proposals one day after they were an-
 nounced.
 Tensions have remained high. The
 Polish people, anticipating price hikes,
 have been hoarding many consumer
 items, thus creating additional shortages.
 One official recently said that a "wartime
 mentality" had taken over. The regime
 has been forced to introduce sugar ration-
 ing.
 In an effort to cool the popular temper,
 the regime has decided to delay price in-

 creases on food for at least a year, and
 possibly until mid-1978, and has promised
 to "consult" extensively with workers
 before any changes are made.
 Problems in the Party
 Party leader Gierek's status within the
 leadership is clearly weaker than it was
 before June, and a certain amount of
 jockeying for position is under way. Some
 efforts to find a scapegoat are reportedly
 being made in the Politburo, and there are
 divergent opinions on how best to proceed
 on the sensitive economic problems.
 The relationship between Gierek and
 Prime Minister Jaroszewicz appears to be
 strained.                       Gierek
 approved the June price package only
 after constant pressure from the govern-
 ment side, especially from Jaroszewicz.
 The subsequent riots reportedly triggered
 a "profound psychological trauma" in
 Gierek, and he probably blames the
 government for bad advice. Since June, he
 and Jaroszewicz have not appeared
 together as frequently as in the past.
 Since the rioting, party politicians have
 reportedly decided they must reassert
 their supremacy over the economic ex-
 perts in the government. In an unusual
 move, Gierek recently attended a session
 of the Council of Ministers. The party
 created  five special party-government
 teams to tackle the most sensitive
 economic problems. These will apparently
 bypass, to some extent, existing govern-
 ment bureaucracies.
 Party leaders will try above all to
 preserve the semblance of unity; in mak-
 ing policy, they will move cautiously. The
 recent discussions on agriculture by a
 Central Committee plenum and by the
 Parliament produced no new ideas on how
 to solve problems in this key area,
 The Church
 For most of their history, Poles have
 equated being Catholic with being Polish,
 and Gierek must take great pains to main-
 tain good relations with the powerful
 Catholic Church. Throughout his tenure,
 a delicate truce has existed between
 church and state. The regime has not
 given up its opposition to the church; it
 hopes by concentrating popular attention
 on economic development to win in a
 long-term battle of attrition. Stefan Car-
 dinal Wyszynski has not challenged the
 regime during difficult economic times,
 but over the last several weeks has become
 noticeably more aggressive in asserting
 the church's rights.
 Edward Gierek   A?
 Gierek's current weakness was ap-
 parent in his call last month for
 church-state cooperation. The episcopate
 in return asked the faithful for an all-out
 effort to solve economic problems, but at
 the same time tested the regime's attitude
 by calling for greater church access to the
 media. The party is not likely to make this
 concession.
 Economic Prospects
 The need for corrective measures comes
 at a time when Poland's options are
 limited. Because of its severe problems
 with hard-currency balance of payments,
 Poland has little flexibility in foreign
 trade and the Soviets are not likely to
 provide any significant assistance.
 Warsaw's decision to freeze food prices
 for at least another year will only
 aggravate the supply problem. Wages
 cannot be frozen without generating
 adverse worker reaction. Nor can the
 regime force the farmer to increase
 agricultural deliveries without irritating
 yet another segment of the population.
 The pressure on meat supplies is not
 likely to ease soon. Livestock inventories
 are down because farmers-faced with
 fodder  shortages  for  several
 months-could not maintain them and
 resorted to some distress slaughtering.
 Herds cannot be rebuilt quickly. It will be
 impossible-at current prices-to satisfy
 the demand for meat and meat products
 for at least a year.
 This situation will be aggravated by the
 regime's recent decision to put a lid on
 free market prices for meat and produce.
 While a short-run sop to urban workers,
 the ceiling will intensify food shortages
 because urban demand for quality foods
 will increase and the farmer will make
 fewer products available.
 Warsaw may ration meat as a
 short-term measure to achieve equitable
 distribution and reduce queues. Ration-
 ing, however, would not increase available
 supplies and a recent press article suggests
 the government may have decided against
 this course for now.
 Poland's only viable option is to in-
 crease supply by importing extraordinary
 amounts of grain and fodder. Imports are
 projected at 7-million tons-about the
 same as last year-in the marketing year
 ending June 30, 1977. Most will come
 from the West, requiring over $1 billion in
 hard-currency expenditures. The Poles
 hope to obtain some 4-million tons from
 the US alone. Warsaw is also increasing
 meat imports-mostly from the
 West-and making further cuts in meat
 exports, an important source of hard
 currency.
 Poland's heavy burden of hard-curren-
 cy debt will force the regime to cut back
 on imports of industrial materials in order
 to import large quantities of grain and
 fodder for at least another year. Another
 large deficit-on the order of the $3

 billion incurred last year-is likely in
 1976, and the debt will probably rise to
 $10 billion, up from $6.9 billion at the end
 of 1975.
 Because of probable difficulties in ob-
 taining the financing needed to cover con-
 tinued large deficits and to meet debt
 obligations, Poland may be forced to
 allow little if any growth in total hard-
 currency imports over the next few years.
 Without a vast improvement in
 agricultural production, the Poles will
 have to continue to hold down imports of
 industrial materials. Thus, the regime
 may well have to accept a reduction in its
 economic growth plans. Before doing so,
 however, it is likely to seek help from the
 West in refinancing or rescheduling part
 of the debt.
 Grappling with these thorny and
 frustrating problems and with the
 aftereffects of the June riots have put the
 leadership to its most severe test since the
 ouster of Gomulka.
 Gierek  and  his  colleagues   know
 that  without  demonstrable  improve-
 ment in the economy, they cannot
 regain  the  confidence  of a  public
 increasingly conscious   of  its  own
 power and that one more upheaval
 would almost certainly mean the end
 of  their  tenure.

 An increase in Soviet crop production this year has been
 offset by declines in the output of livestock products.
 Total agricultural output in the USSR
 this year will be about the same as in the
 poor year of 1975. A large increase in
 crop output will be offset by a sharp
 decline in livestock production.
 We estimate Soviet grain production
 this year will be 200 million metric tons or
 more. Although grain is the USSR's
 single most important crop, other crops as
 a group rival grain in their impact on
 agricultural production and on the coun-
 try's net import position.
 Potatoes-an important food and feed
 crop-are a partial substitute for grain
 and can either make up part of a grain
 shortfall when plentiful or substantially
 swell Soviet requirements for feed grain
 after a poor crop. Sunflower seeds supply
 three quarters of the vegetable oil, and
 sugar beets provide four fifths of the sugar
 consumed yearly in the USSR. Cotton ex-
 ports earn sizable amounts of hard
 currency.
 Our preliminary estimates indicate that
 the Soviets will harvest about 90 to 95-
 million tons of potatoes, close to their
 average production for the past five years,
 and about 85-million tons of sugar beets,

 slaughtering in 1963.
 The number of cattle, which has
 changed little throughout the period,
 will be about 2 percent above January 1,
 1975, levels. The average slaughter weight
 of cattle, however, will still be down sub-
 stantially.
 The improved crop prospects for the
 year reduce the need for imports of agri-
 cultural commodities_ notably grain-
 and release for export greater quan-
 tities of cotton, sugar, and vegetable
 oil. Last year's poor harvest disrupted
 the USSR's traditional agricultural trade
 patterns as imports of farm commodities
 mushroomed while exports fell substan-
 tially.
 Unless there are quality problems with
 this year's crop, we expect the Soviets to
 hold grain purchases to about 14-million
 tons. At current prices, purchases of this
 size would cost roughly $2 to $2.5 billion.
 Last year's purchases of 27-million tons
 cost almost $4.5 billion.
 With a good sugar beet crop, the USSR
 may increase sugar exports. Exports of
 28 percent more than in 1975. Cotton and
 vegetable crops will approach all-time
 highs, and the sunflower seed crop will be
 only 10 percent below the 1973 record
 level.
 The 19-percent jump in crop production
 will be offset by an estimated 13-percent
 drop in output of livestock products-the
 result of earlier distress slaughtering.
 Meat production probably will be about
 12.5-million tons, off 17 percent from
 1975. Milk production will be roughly 85-
 million tons, a drop of 6-million tons from
 last year, and egg output could be off as
 much as 17 percent.
 The expected increase in the availabil-
 ity of feed offers hope to consumers for
 some relief from shortages of livestock
 products. September should see a mod-
 erate increase in meat production from
 the severely depressed July level, but
 shortages will persist through the year.
 The current expansion in herd inven-
 tories reflects good pasture and forage
 crops during the summer and the larger
 grain harvest. By January 1, hogs will
 reach an estimated 90 percent of the
 January 1, 1975, level, and poultry, 95
 percent; these are more rapid recoveries
 than occurred following the distress
 vegetable oil will be expanded, cotton will
 again be available for sale, and meat
 purchases will drop to more normal levels.

 Recent student protest demonstrations highlight General
 Torrijos' declining popularity. The decline has been brought on
 in part by the General's inability to deal effectively with grow-
 ing economic difficulties.
 Panama: Domestic Problems for Torrijos
 Panamanian strongman Omar Torri-
 jos is facing his most serious domestic
 problems since he consolidated his hold
 on power in 1969. His recent perfor-
 mance, particularly his failure to deal
 effectively with the demonstrations in the
 past two weeks, has probably reduced his
 popularity to an all-time low and opened
 him to some criticism from other officers
 in the country's only military force, the
 National Guard.
 The  student-incited  protests  have
 highlighted  both  the government's
 economic difficulties and Torrijos' declin-
 ing popularity. Although the government
 finally quelled the disorders with a strong
 show of force, preventive arrests, and the
 temporary closing of schools, it has not
 begun to deal with its many problems.
 For the first time, there is disgruntle-
 ment in the National Guard-the only
 force capable of removing Torrijos from
 office. In previous crises, the Guard has
 lined up behind him.
 The Guard expects further student
 demonstrations, and there is considerable
 sentiment among middle- and high-rank-
 ing officers for a hard line.
 There does not appear to be any immi-
 nent threat to Torrijos. The top officers
 do not appear as yet to have seriously con-
 sidered alternatives to him. These leaders
 are men who threw in their lot with the
 general at the time of an abortive coup
 attempt in 1969 and hold their positions
 because of their loyalty to him. After
 nearly eight years, they feel identified with
 the programs and goals of the govern-
 ment.
 Rival factions in the Guard have tended
 to compete with one another rather than
 to challenge Torrijos. At present, military
 leaders are probably still confident that
 they can ride out difficulties over the next
 several months with Torrijos at the helm.
 The top military men are ambitious,
 however, and could be ruthless. This is es-
 pecially true of, Lieutenant Colonel
 Noriega. He, Colonel Garcia, and fellow
 general-staff member and Minister of
 Agriculture Lieutenant Colonel Paredes,
 are the most powerful officers after
 Torrijos. In the event of sustained dis-
 orders, especially if Torrijos is again view-
 ed as failing to exercise strong authority,
 they might attempt to remove him.
 The military, having been in power
 since  1968, would not return to the
 sidelines. Colonel Garcia, next in line in
 the military hierarchy, would probably
 take over the National Guard at least in-

 "destabilization" efforts had little impact.
 The refusal of students and the general
 public to be diverted is one measure of
 their concern with the country's economic
 problems.
 These problems are such that there is
 no short-term solution in sight. The finan-
 cial squeeze is likely to get worse in the
 months ahead. Torrijos' advisers are con-
 sidering  at least two remedial
 moves-raising taxes and easing the
 burdens on business of the 1972 labor
 code. Both could be politically explosive.
 The labor code in particular was one of
 the symbols of the "revolution." It
 significantly increased worker benefits
 and was the most popular move any
 Panamanian government had taken on
 behalf of labor. The worsening economic
 situation and continual complaints from
 businessmen led the government to in-
 form union leaders on September 10 that
 University of Panama students flee tear gas thrown by National Guard troops   pchanges were in the offing.

 Economic Pinch
 The prospect is that deteriorating
 economic conditions will result in further
 disorders in the months ahead. The
 government could be on the verge of a
 major fiscal crisis. Almost all economic
 indicators plummeted again in the second
 quarter of this year, and unemployment
 has nearly doubled in twelve months.
 With the poor feeling most of the pinch
 of higher prices and unemployment, the
 administration  is being charged with
 favoring the upper classes. This undercuts
 one of the government's basic
 claims-that it, unlike its predecessors,
 represents the aspirations of middle- and
 lower-income groups.
 Declining Popular Support
 Of almost equal significance is the
 growing belief-particularly among
 students and the poor-that Torrijos has
 betrayed the "revolution." Top military
 officers are now seen as little different
 from venal government officials of the
 past. It is becoming common knowledge
 that Torrijos enriches himself in private
 business deals and that his subordinates
 follow suit.
 The  government's  well-known
 manipulation of the media, its disregard
 of constitutional rights, and Torrijos'
 seeming abandonment of his original role
 of populist reformer in favor of aspiring
 to become a third world leader contribute
 to further domestic dissatisfaction.
 One presumed strength of the
 regime-Torrijos' ability to negotiate a
 new canal treaty with the US-may also
 be starting to work against it. For nearly
 eight years, the general has promised that
 "next year" a pact will be signed.
 Radicals argue that Torrijos would have
 to sell out Panama's interests to secure an
 accord.
 Students and Labor
 The recent protests forced Torrijos to
 act against students-whom he has sin-
 gled out as one of the principal partners
 in his "revolution." During the height of
 the disturbances there were rumors that
 Torrijos was losing control. Although
 they appear to have been groundless, their
 wide circulation is indicative of the un-
 settled public mood.
 The government's effort to throw up a
 smoke screen with charges that the
 demonstrations resulted from US
 demonstrate against unpopular govern-
 ment policies in the future. Even the large
 government-manipulated student federa-
 tion supported the initial call for price
 rollbacks.  Pro-government  student
 leaders are concerned about losing control
 of the student movement because ul-
 tra-left groups, which have already been
 recording  gains,  are  further boosted
 by  the    National Guard's actions
 against previously uninvolved students.
 A measure of the continued student an-
 tagonism toward the government was the
 low turnout-about half government ex-
 pectations-for the dialogue between stu-
 dent leaders and Vice President Gonzalez
 following the first week of disorders.
 Torrijos has believed that a new canal
 treaty with the US would ensure his
 political future. It is becoming increasing-
 ly apparent, however, that-in the
 absence of success on the canal issue-his
 management of the economy and the
 general domestic situation could be
 critical. For the most part, his home
 audience appears no longer willing to be
 distracted  by  his  unproductive
 national    performances.
