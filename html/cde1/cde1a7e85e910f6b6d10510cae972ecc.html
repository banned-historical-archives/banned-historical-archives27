 AN OPEN LETTER TO FOREIGN DIPLOMATS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES AND
 AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS
 The Solution Of World Problems Through East-West Trade
 In a world of realities, penalties are heavy
 for illusions. Human nature does not change. As
 .Karl von  Clausewitz,  the German militarist-
 theoritician said, war remained "the continua-
 tion of politics by other means" and "an act of
 violence for the purpose of compelling the ad-
 versary to fulfill our will."
 Politics is nothing but the -concentrated form
 or  economics.  While  human  nature  did  not
 change, the ways and means of individuals and
 nations to achieve their aspirations and ends
 are in a process of continuous change. Science
 is most responsible for that change. But it has
 no  principles, religion,  nationality or race.
 Through science mankind arrived to the point
 that if and when all available ways and means
 would be applied in military war, the only victor
 would be Death itself ; hence military war de-
 feated its own purpose!
 Does that mean that peoples of the world will
 live together in peace? Of course, not! Peace
 is the irrealistic object of daydreamers. War
 must continue but since military war became
 outdated and obsolete, we must use the next pos-
 sibilities: the economic-political war. In such
 war, as before, but in other ways, the inferior
 struggles to become equal, and once equal he
 tries to become superior by toppling down the
 decaying pro forma superior. This perpetual
 struggle and change, where the fittest survive
 is in full accordance with the Natural Laic.
 The purpose of my writing to you is to invite
 you to a meeting where East-West trade can be
 discussed. If you think that competition based on
 initiative is the key of progress, if you promote
 peace in respect to military war, progress and
 prosperity and competitive co-existence between
 AN OPEN LETTER TO THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS
 East-West Trade The Starting Process For The Federation Of Eastern Europea Countries
 Man does not live by bread alone but first of
 an by bread. rouct, shelter and clothes i.e. mate-
 rialism preoccupies man. Once the materialistic
 need is satisfied, then other aspects of life should
 be taken into consideration and not before. If
 a man is hungry and is freezing without adequate
 clothes and shelter, it would be 'a sheer nonsense
 to talk to him e.g. about the existence or non-
 existence of God.
 The above thoughts apply to primitive societies.
 Developed and civilized societies have much more
 problems. The progress made by science and its
 use for military weapons, advanced communica-
 tion  and  transportation  created  fundamental
 changes at such rapid speed, that one really has
 to stop once in a while and do some thinking;
 what should and should not to be done.
 In the following, I make an attempt to think
 in writing concerning East-West relations with
 the frame of mind of an Eastern European but
 seeing it. from the U.S. Certainly, it is not an
 easy task but worthwhile to try it.
 The most practical approach to it, is to con-
 sider facts. One must realize that since WW II
 public opinion of the world has been most in-
 fluenced by the propaganda machines of the two
 superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The
 U.S. promotes such propaganda through dollar-
 diplomacy, the Soviet Union through the various
 cornmunjst parties outside the Soviet Union. For
 practical and tactical purposes I consider both
 superpowers as imperialistic and analyze them
 1 y- illustrations  (for lack of space a detailed
 j ualysis is not possible) through the same stand-
 (ft d of judgement.
 I engage diplomatic and plain language. Also
 tie "carrots-language" and the "stick-language"
 ws hich ever is necessary the name the facts and
 ec.'unterbalance the two propaganda machines.
 T) !e struggle in the arena of international power-
 pol.itics creates its own rules, regulations and
 law s. Fictions are created to cover facts, if and
 when, it =s necessary. One of my aims is that
 the workers but first of all the American workers
 understand mny writing.
 First let's take the U.S.A.
 In 1776 it had a territory of 386,000 sq.mi. In
 the  Following 130 years the U.S. enlarged its
 posse: ;lion by war, seizure, annexion, purchase
 or otherwise by more than 3,000,000 sa.mi. The
 Historical Register of the U.S. Army published
 in 1903 contains a list of 114 wars in which the
 U.S. engaged after 1775. These wars involved
 8,600 battles and engagements.
 Here are the principa; enlargements : Louisiana
 of 827,000 sq.mi. in 1803; Florida of 58,600 sq.mi.
 in 1819; Texas of 389,000 sq.mi. in 1845; Oregon
 of 286,000 sq.mi. in 1846; Utah, Arizona, New
 Mexico and California of 529,000 sq,mi. in 1853;
 Gadsen territory from Mexico of 30,000 sq.mi. in
 1853. (2,119,600 sq.mi.)
 In the second half of the century the U.S. added
 another 716,666 sq.mi. to its national possession
 which include Alaska in 1867; Philippines, Guam,
 Porto Rico, Hawaiian Island in 1898-, Samoa in
 1899; Panama Canal Zone in 1903 and Virgin
 Islands in 1917.
 Before entering WW I, the U.S. was a debtor
 country of $3,000,000,000. After WW I, the U.S.
 emerged as a creditor country to the extent of
 816,000,000,000. According to the Soviet propa-
 ganda the more blood is split, the bigger the
 profits and wealth of the American munition
 tycoons, who made $46,000,000,000 net profit
 in WW I, and $123,000,000,000 net profit in
 WW II.
 U.S. Senator Cabot Lodge said on January 7,
 1901: "The American people and the economic
 forces which underlie all are carrying us for-
 ward to the economic supremacy of the world."
 Harry S. Truman said on December 19, 1945:
 "Whether we like or not, we must recognize that
 the victory which we have won has placed upon
 the American people the continuing burder of
 responsibility for world leadership." Theodore
 Roosevelt once said: "I never take a step in
 foreign policy unless I am assured that I shall
 be able eventually to carry out my will by force."
 Theodore Roosevelt believed in a policy of speak-
 ing softly but carrying the Big Stick, i.e. if car-
 rots do not work, use the Big Stick.
 Lieut. Gen. A. C. Wedemeyer said on March 5,
 1949: "We must think in terms of blood as well
 as of money. We must have military support and
 protection of our economic investments wher-
 ever forces threaten everything that we hold
 dear."
 East and West that meeting will be of great
 benefit to you or your representative.
 Concerning the details of the subject-matter
 to be discussed during the meeting, as a first
 step, it would be necessary to read the 60 pages
 I mentioned in the Open Letter to Secretary Gen-
 eral of the United Nations. The Xerox-copies of
 those 60 pages are available to you, if you request
 them.
 This copy also was mailed to 112 Ambassadors
 of foreign countries in Washington, D.C., 124
 Ambassadors of UN-Delegations and 177 Pres-
 idents of large U.S. manufacturing and banking
 corporations, and other persons in key positions
 of economic-political leadership.
 Your inquiries are welcome.
 New York, September 1968.
 7.7'  ace  General Srn,,Tev   Hulce.  C,.n"mr '-tn-
 dant oi' the U.S.         Corps, summed up his
 experience as an  imperialist gunman in the
 November, 1935 issue of "Common Sense" : "I
 spent thirty-three years and four months  in
 active service as a member of our country's most
 active military force - The Marine Corps . . .
 and during that time. I spent most of my time as
 a high-class muscle man for big business, for
 Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a
 racketeer for capitalism . . . during those years
 I had, as the boys in the back room would say,
 a swell racket. Loekiu,ig buck on it, I feel I might
 have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he
 could do was to operate his racket in three city
 districts. We Marines operated in three conti-
 nents." By now the U.S. Armed Forces operate
 in five continents'
 One ww onders, what the Soviet Generals would
 write - IF - they had the freedom to do so -
 about the Soviet military onslaught against Hun-
 gary in 1956 and the Soviet military invasion of
 Czechoslovakia in 1968?
 Vic- President Hnbert H. Humphrey said on
 July 12, 1968: "We are not the world's police-
 man. How people wish to govern themselves, and
 how they wish to change their government -
 that's their business." If the U.S. government
 only would do what it is preaching and the ar-
 rogant American imperialists in the late 40-s
 and early 50-s represented by the Dulles-clique
 only would have listened to General MacArthur
 and Marshall Montgomery, the U.S. never would
 have committed the blunder to engage a military
 landsw ar in Asia. Neither in Korea nor in Viet-
 nam. Nor they should engage in any military
 action in the Middle Eeast!
 Until now more than 30.000 Americans were
 slaughtered in Vietnam. There are more than
 180,000 casualties and more than $100,000.000,-
 000 have been squandered in the senseless slaugh-
 ter in Vietnam. On June 25, 1968 over the Quang
 Bihn Province the 3,000:h L.S. aircraft was shot
 down. The American Air Force has dropped on
 Vietnam more bombs than were dropped on the
 territory of Germany during WW II. For the
 U.S. from both human and material points it
 costs more to cause damage, than damage itself.

 For the U.S. Vietnam is a stupid war not only
 from the military but also from the economic-
 political view.
 The great American dilemma is now: shall
 we pull out from Vietnam? The answer is given
 by those we follow the philosophy and tactics of
 Mao The-tung: No! Stay there American im-
 perialists until we break your arrogance, and
 then the Vietnam war will come to end through
 political settlement on our terms!!! Asia belongs
 to the Asians.
 And now, let's turn to the Soviet Union, the
 "Paradise of the Workers".
 The very existence of the Soviet Union started
 in 1462 by the Grand Dutchy of Muskovy. Czar-
 ist Russia expansion by territories of the peo-
 ples in European part of the Euro-Asian con =
 tinent is: 1462-1505: Samoyeds, Nentsis-Samo-
 yeds, Komi-Zyrians, Permiaks, Kerelians; 1505-
 1682: Edmurts, Tartars, Bashkirs, Mordovians,
 Uralian Cossacks, Kalmucks, Cossacks on the
 Dori, Cossacks on the Terek, Little Russians, Uk-
 rainians; 1682-1725: Estonians; 1725-1796: Lat-
 vians, Lithuanians, White Russians; 1796-1825:
 Karachays, Ossentins, Kabardinians, Daghesti,
 Armenians, Azerbaidzhani,  Cherkessi,  Abhazi,
 Rumanians,  Bessarabians,  Poles,  Fins; 1825-
 1881: Georgians.
 The Soviet Union followed the imperialism
 of the Czarist Russia. 1920-1921: Ukraine, Geor-
 gia, Armenia, Azerbaijan; 1939-1945: Estonia,
 Latvia, Lithuania; after 1945 with more or less
 results: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Po-
 land, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and the Eastern part
 of Germany.
 In Asia: 1462-1584: Mari, Chuvasi, Udmurts,
 Manis-Voguls, Nentsis-Samoyeds, Ostyak-Khan-
 tys; 1584-1689: Evenkis-Tungus, Yakuts, Kha-
 kassis,  Tuvinians,  Buryats-Mongols,  Yukagirs,
 Chukchis-Luravetianys,   Koryaks, Nymylanys,
 Kamchadatics; 1689-1796: Oyrots, Altasi, Khal-
 kas; 1796-1914: Kara-Kalpaks, Turkmen, Uzbeks,
 Tadshiks, Kirghisi, Kurds. After 1945: Kurile
 Islands and Sakhalin.
 Sortie names appear twice, since those peoples
 lived in European as well as in Asian territory.
 Also, because some of them were liberated then
 subjugated again.
 The Soviet propaganda machine once had been
 very effective but as time passed by more and
 more people realized that under the cloak of Marx-
 ism-Leninism the Soviet Union is practicising im-
 perialism. The leaders in Moscow also have to
 know: you can't fool all of the peoples all of
 the times.
 Let's consider the achievements of the Soviet
 Union, and give the credit where it belongs. One
 must realize it took England 300 years to de-
 velop her industry; 150 years for the U.S.; 100
 years for Germany; 75 years for Japan and 50
 years for the Soviet Union. Each country bene-
 fited from the previous developments. The Soviet
 propaganda takes all credits. Further, it never
 mentions the industrial know-how and material
 assistance received from the U.S. in connection
 with WW II and a 11 what they t o o k from
 Germany after 1945. It never mentions the eco-
 nomic exploitation of Eastern Europe through
 "commercial"  agreements,  where  the  Soviet
 Union sets the price as buyer as well as seller.
 Of course, buying at much lower prices then
 world market prices, and selling at a much high-
 er price than world market prices. To assure
 hughe profits the Soviet armed forces give full
 guaranty. The Soviet Union is the worst of all
 bad imperialists!
 At Expo 67 in Montreal, Canada a great num-
 ber of people saw the show-window of "socialist
 realism" in the Soviet Union. At the Osaka World
 Exhibition in 1970 the Soviet pavilion will re-
 semble in shape of an unfurled red banner with
 the emblem of the hammer and sickle. It will be
 100 meters high covering an area of 20,000 square
 meters. It is designed as a symbol of the Soviet
 Union's dynamism. Like in Montreal it will show
 Soviet "socialist realism" on the surface which
 is nothing but glorification of the Soviet Union.
 And now let's see American and Soviet im-
 perialism side by side.
 In order to clear the picture blurred by the
 propaganda machines of Soviet and American
 imperialists one must be first of all alert to the
 use of semantics and of course separate facts
 from fictions.
 Freedom; liberty; law and order; peace at
 home and abroad; one nation under God, invisible,
 with liberty and justice for all; sincere friendship;
 comeradely discussion; frank and comeradely ex-
 change; socialist solidarity; socialist democracy;
 independence; peace and security; territorial in-
 tegrity;  non-interference in internal  affairs;
 aggression and revenge ; war of liberation; just
 wars; unjust wars; unbridled anti-socialist dem-
 agogy ; treaties and agreements linking socialist
 countries with one another ; commercial agree-
 ments at mutual benefits; mutual obligations of
 states and peoples based on the general aspira-
 tion to defend socialism and ensure security of
 the socialist countries; military assistance to de-
 fend the achievements of socialism against its
 enemies; and so 'Prth and so on, are only im-
 persialists catchwords and slogans fabricated
 by phrasemakers to mislead the masses. One
 never should pay too much attention what the
 imperialists say, but only what they do. The
 word democracy e.g. is recklessly used in the
 Soviet Union as well as in the U.S. In both coun-
 tries it has no practical meaning. It's a bluff.
 The worst misleading word is, however: EQUAL-
 ITY.
 It is necessary to nail down, we all are equal
 twice in our life. At our birth and when we die.
 Between those two times, we are UNEQUAL,
 or expressed in a different way: some of us are
 more equal than others.
 Lenin said in 1920 at the Third all-Russian
 Trade Union Congress: "We are conducting a
 class struggle Our aim is to abolish classes; so
 long as there still exist two classes, those of
 peasants and workers, socialism cannot be real-
 ized." It is a fact, there is no communism in the
 Soviet Union. It will be, however, when the aim
 of communism: from each according to his ability
 to each according to his need, will be a reality.
 Since 1917 this aim is not yet realized. What we
 have now in the Soviet Union is a system, where
 the principle: from each according to his ability
 to each according to his work, prevails. That sys-
 tem based on such principle is now called social-
 ism in the Soviet Union and capitalism in the
 United States.
 In reality, however, the present economic sys-
 tem in the Soviet Union is state capitalism in
 form of state monopolism, the political system
 is despotism of the ruling class.
 In the U.S. the economic system is private
 monopolism, which controls the U.S. government.
 The U.S. government permits political freedom.
 but makes it ineffective by the power of the purse
 of private monopolism.
 The ruling classes of both superpowers sup-
 press truth but in different ways. Yet they are
 not equal. The despotism in the Soviet union is
 more oppressive than the same in the U.S.
 Lenin wanted to abolish all classes and make
 people equal. The statement of the Communist
 and worker's parties of the socialist countries
 on August 3, 1968 - as printed in Pravda -
 recognized the existence of three classes in the
 Soviet Union: working class, peasantry and in-
 telligentsia. Hence, according to the concepts of
 Lenin, not even socialism is existent in the Sov-
 iet Union. It exists only in the propaganda of
 the Soviet Union.
 In 1943 the Soviet press hailed the appearance
 of the first socialist millionaire comrade Berdy-
 bekov (NY Times 7/4/1943 p.8E.col.3.).
 V. Y. Vishinsky wrote in "Information Bul-
 letin" published by the Soviet Embassy in Wash-
 ington, D.C. on November 17, 1945: "The Soviet
 system is the cradle of new classes, such as have
 never before been known in history. Our work-
 ing class and our collective farmers are in their
 social nature new classes, as is also the new

 Soviet intelligentsia, whose character has been
 formed by the new socialist relations. The same
 "Information Bulletin" writes on January 29,
 1946: "The Constitution of the U.S.S.R. ensures
 . . . the right to inherit and bequeth personal
 property. In insuring this right, the Constitution
 also insures the privileges of children born to
 upper strata, to the offspring of Soviet mil-
 lionaire Berdybekov, for example."
 It is safe to say, in Orwellian terms, the Soviet
 leaders know the language of the "new-speak".
 Interestingly,  the  filmindustry  of  Hollywood
 which is the biggest promoter of immorality
 and crime and the servant of imperialists has no
 intention to make a film of George Orwell's novel
 "1984" written after WW II, and Imre Madach's
 play "The Tragedy of Man", written in 1823.
 Both writers were forecasting the battle against
 tyranny in our century. The despotism of the
 ruling classes of the two superpowers are sink-
 ing deeper, and the determination of peoples for
 freedom is rising higher. 30,000 Hungarians did
 not die in vain in 1956 against the Soviet im-
 perialists, and there are not 40,000 "counter-
 revolutionists" in Czechoslovakia but 14,000,000
 Slovaks and Czechs who are nothing but the
 enemies of Soviet imperrialis'm!
 Stalin said on February 9, 1946: "The election
 campaign is the judgement of the electors of
 the communist party, as being the party of the
 rulers." One knows, however, that the existence
 of rulers inescapably implies the existence of
 the ruled.
 Through the advance of science the survival
 of a closed society is getting more difficult.
 The most open society still exist in the U.S. and
 the Soviet society is drifting away from being
 a closed society. The intelligentsia is the ruling
 class in the Soviet Union and the peasants and
 workers the ruled class. The communist parties
 outside the Soviet Union have a second thought
 about the idea that all roads lead to Moscow.
 Interesting is the communist party U.S.A. About
 30ric  of the  "card-carrying  communists"  are
 F.B.I. agents, the rest of them are nothing but
 frustrated intellectuals.
 In the U.S. the monopolists are the ruling class,
 the rest is the ruled class not politically but eco-
 nomically i.e. credit-system. Life for the ruled
 is more bearable in the U.S. than in the Soviet
 Union.
 And now, let's see, how the ruling class live
 in the Soviet Union, the "Land of Equality", the
 "Paradise of the Workers".
 Officially some Soviet citizens became more
 equal than others through a speech of Stalin
 when he attacked uravnilovka, i.e. the equality
 of pay. Since then the officer caste of the armed
 forces, managers, administrative officials, intel-
 lectuals and professionals received 20, 30, 100
 or even 300 times more payment than the work-
 ers and peasants. But monetary income by no
 means represents all the material benefits of
 the Soviet un-socialist, un-democratic but despotic
 ruling class. The dictatorship of the proletariat
 in Lenin's concept does not exist any more. Of-
 ficially it is replaced by the state of the entire
 people. The ruling class controls the state, hence
 they control the entire people i.e. the workers
 and the peasants. For the ruled classes in the
 Soviet Union freedom means to follow the orders
 of the ruling class, or else.
 The ruling class in the Soviet Union have a
 house and a sumptuous one, a budget for pay-
 ing a staff of servants, a car and a chauffeur,
 the privilege of buying at exclusive stores where
 goods otherwise unobtainable are sold at mod-
 erate prices, vacations for themselves and their
 families at exclusive resorts in the Soviet Uniola
 and abroad. Free railroad and air transportatuic,ii
 and in most cases exemption from paying taxe.;.
 All these "nice things of life" are provided t o
 them by the state, where the ruling class says :
 l'Etat c'est moi !
 Sons and daughters of the privileged bureau.
 cratic ruling class enjoy all kind of priority, do
 as they like and climb up the social ladder ra-
 pidly, while those of workers, peasants and other
 labouring people and the working youth are be-
 ing squeezed out and discriminated against.
 Very interesting is to observe the diplon-iatic
 representation of the Soviet Union. Natu?eally,
 only the most trusted ones, the most privi,,eged
 ones are sent abroad. In their social acti\.,ities
 such as cocktail parties in their desperate att empt

 Dean Rusk before the Senate foreign relations
 committee on July 10, 1968 as the victory of
 American foreign policy.
 Former U.S. Senator Paul H. Douglas wrote
 a very valuable book under the title "America
 in the market place". He does not write about
 the "lofty ideals" of socialism or capitalism or
 about Jewish-Christian love but about economic-
 political matters. It's a down-to-earth approach
 to realism. On page 159 he gives interesting de-
 tails about the spheres of influences, exactly what
 the imperialists deny.
 One can easily realize to which extent the im-
 perialists are confused. They preach fear about
 thermonuclear war and extermination of man-
 kind. Whatever they do, they consider it as their
 "mission" e.g. Maj. Gen. V. Matsulenko wrote
 an article in the "Soviet Military Review" under
 the title "The liberating mission of the Soviet
 army". They promote the idea of "Holy Alliance"
 but they also fight each other. Now in Vietnam,
 next time in the Middle East.
 A leading U.S. magazine recently had an ad-
 vertising: Life, consider the alternative.  The
 U.S. Post office department stamps a slogan on
 letters "Pray for peace". The Pentagon - ac-
 cording to Chinese propaganda - has another
 slogan: kill all, burn all, destroy all.
 Life, consider the alternative. Extermination
 of mankind, including the imperialists? It's un-
 thinkable! They want to live and not to die!
 8)  Red China. Not all roads are leading to
 Moscow. Peking is taking over the role of Mos-
 cow as leader of Marxism-Leninism.
 On October 10, 1911 the Chinese people under
 the leadership of Sun Yat-sen did overthrow the
 rule of the Ching-dynasty, and with that act
 put an end to China's feudal monarchy which
 lasted over 2,000 years. In September 1949 Mao
 Tse-tung solemnly declared: "The Chinese, form-
 ing one-quarter of mankind, have stood up." The
 fight of the Chinese people which lasted for about
 a century stopped not only domestic feudalism but
 also foreign imperialism, economic stagnation
 and social imperialism. The forces of Mao Tse-
 tung returned to the Chinese people, their na-
 tional identity and pride. A great country and
 a great people started moving ahead in every
 respect.
 Napoleon once said: "Let China sleep, when
 she awakes the world will be sorry." The im-
 perialists are already sorry. Few American lead-
 ers as Vice President Humphrey had the courage
 to speak publicly about the necessity of an Amer-
 ican-Chinese understanding. Red China is not
 anymore a "living carcass" as the Western Eu-
 ropean imperialists called it in the last century.
 It is anticipated that by 1970 Red China will
 have about 100 H-bombs and by 1973 it will have
 rockets capable of hitting targets at the West
 coast.
 At present the American and Societ propa-
 ganda machines still make mockery out of Red
 China by considering their trend as grotesque,
 tragicomic, absurd, fascist, racist and so on and
 so forth. Indeed, judged by Western standards,
 it is strange, how the thoughts of Mao Tse-tung
 can help someone to win a ping-pong contest
 or doctors to remove a 100 lbs. tumor from the
 abdomen of a woman. But a careful study of the
 selected works of Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese
 philosophers and writers Lu Hsun and Lao Tzu
 enables one to understand the 700,000,000 "blue
 ants" by Chinese standards. Indeed, they are
 on the right track by Chinese standards. It is
 very possible that in some years the American
 yellow journals will print "sensational" articles
 about the "Chinese miracle". The manipulators
 of American Massenver blodung are often com-
 pelled to use methods of the Dark Middle Ages.
 Those who are against Soviet imperialism and
 the "Holy Alliance"  of the two superpowers
 should only welcome the trend in Red China. One
 concept of the Massenverblodung is of course the
 "yellow danger". The false prophets armed with
 quotations of the bible are spreading fear that
 the Chinese once will overrun the whole world.
 The Zionists in the U.S. are the chief spokes-
 men for the crusade against Red China, since
 they sense a danger to their dreams to rule once
 the world from Jerusalem. The Zionists are
 also the leaders of those "anti-communist" move-
 ment which prevented the UN-membership of
 Red China. Interestingly the "yellow danger"
 was once applied to the Japanese, now the Chin.
 find the answer right here in the U.S. in a book
 "Stalinist corruption of Marxism-A study in
 Machiavellian duplicity" (125 pp.-1940) written
 by Arnold Petersen a socialist following the
 teaching of Daniel De Leon. Lenin had great
 respect for De Leon.
 What Khrushchev "exposed" in 1956, Mr. Pet-
 erson exposed in 1940 while the U.S. government
 already started the "Holy Alliance" with that
 bank-robber Stalin, whom  President Truman
 called: good old Joe!!!
 And now, let's see the Soviet-American im-
 perialists handcuffed together. Here I have to
 use the "stick-language" since the "carrots-lan-
 guage" cannot describe the imperialists.
 In European but especially in French political
 circles the opinion prevails that the U.S. and the
 Soviet Union are in a secret alliance which orig-
 inated at Yalta, continued at Camp David and
 further kept alive in Glassboro. According to this
 assumption both superpowers divided the world
 in spheres of influence for the purpose of eco-
 nomic exploitation. There is little doubt about
 it, if and when these two superpowers and their
 despotic leaders once really arrived to a success-
 ful cooperation, human freedom and rights would
 be extinct as the dodo. But will they be true al-
 lies? Here are some thoughts how and why,
 they NEVER will be true allies.
 1)  Co-existence between the American eco-
 nomic-political system called capitalism and the
 Soviet economic-political system called socialism
 is impossible, because the Constitutions of the
 two superpowers are diametrically opposed on
 irreconcilable principles. The acceptance of the
 principles of the Soviet Constitution in the U.S.
 would lead to a total economic-social collapse of
 the U.S., and vice versa. The "Holy Alliance"
 during WW II was based not on principles but on
 temporary expediency. L. I. Brezhnev put it flat-
 ly in his speech on March 29, 1968 at the Moscow
 city party conference: "Our party has always
 warned that in ideological field there can be no
 peaceful coexistence, just as there can be no
 class between proletariat and bourgeoise." Eco-
 nomic-political competitive co-existence excluding
 all military actions should be promoted, however.
 2)  The formation of power-centers and division
 of spheres of influence for the purpose of ex-
 ploitation, i.e. the subjugation of men by men
 is nothing new in the history of world. But his-
 tory teaches us, when empires have divided the
 world between themselves and arrived to the
 saturation point, then they have the tendency
 to divide one another. Paraphrased it differently,
 they become cannibalistic. A careful study of
 American-Soviet relations since WW II reveals
 such cannibalistic attitude, e.g. when Eisenhower
 one of the most docil puppet of the American
 monopolists invited Khrushchev to the U.S. and
 he, like other "noble" Americans were bowing
 their  heads  and  bending themselves  before
 Khrushchev like abject servants, in the true men-
 tality of abject servants, they also sent U-2 re-
 connaissance planes over the Soviet Union. On
 the other hand, despite the grinning and hand-
 shaking and babykissing of Soviet diplomats at
 cocktail parties in the U.S. the Soviet UN-MiS-
 sion remains the biggest spyorganization for the
 Soviet Union in the U.S.
 3)  In Vietnam the Soviet-American imperial-
 ists are realizing that they are sinking in quick-
 sand. They both are losing face and are desperate
 to find a way out. They act now, like malicious
 beasts after being trapped and trying to save
 their hides.
 4)  Great will be the day, when the war is
 over in Vietnam! The prostitute politicians will
 praise their masters, and the prostitute clergy-
 men will ring-the churchbells. The imperialists
 will be described as the benefactors of man-
 kind, but .. .
 '5)  Very few suspects, Vietnam is not the last
 war. The imperialists are already carefully pre-
 paring the Israeli-Arab war in the Middle-East.
 This time not for a Blitzkrieg but for a long,
 long war. The Soviet union will be with the
 Arabs, the U.S. with Israel and the Zionists in
 the U.S.
 The Jews in Europe but especially in Eastern
 Europe know by experience that Zionism means
 to them the same disaster as Nazism did to the
 Germans. The American Jews do not know yet
 the true nature of Zionism. When European Jews
 were fed into ovens, the Zionists i.e. Jewish
 Nazis in the U.S. had deaf ears to their cries.
 Many Zionists were willing collaborators with
 the Gestapo. There is a fully documented book
 in the U.S. "Perfidy" written by the late prom-
 inent Jew, Ben Hecht. The book is out of print,
 and suppressed by the Zionists.
 There are few Jews who really believe that
 they are God's chosen people and once they will
 rule the world from Jerusalem. That's all religi-
 ous hogwash. The great majority of Jews all over
 the world but especially in the U.S. do not regard
 Israel as their home. The Zionist controlled Amer-
 ican press certainly do not admit that ten thou-
 sands of Jews returned from Israel. But more
 and more people including Jews know that Israel
 is established to protect the interests of the U.S.
 monopolies in the Middle East which have a cap-
 ital investment there of $2,000-million and a
 yearly net profit of $1,200-million, in other words
 the U.S. monopolies make 60%r- yearly interest!
 The interests of the Zionists in the U.S.; are
 protected by the "Anti-Defamation League" of
 the "B'nai B'rith".
 According to a report (NY Times, July 24,
 1968 p.17.L.col.14-6) 62%~, of Americans expect
 a war between Israel and the Arab countries
 within the next five years. 77% does not want
 to help Israel, and 83%i% the Arabs. 9%i% want to
 help Israel, and 2%Jc the Arabs. One should remem-
 ber the often repeated statement of Ben Gurion:
 "You cannot be an American and a Jew."
 6)  There are many interesting "feelers" to
 which extent the imperialists can come to the
 public with the idea of the "Holy Alliance", e.g.
 an essay, titled "Thoughts on progress, peaceful
 co-existence and intellectual freedom" by Prof.
 Andrei D. Sakharov, the "father" of the Soviet
 H-bomb. The essay was not printed publicly in the
 Soviet Union. It was designed to be printed only
 abroad with the tacit consent of the Soviet lead-
 ers. The NY Times published it in full on July
 22, 1968. Indeed, the essay is a remarkable
 masterpiece for the benefit of the Soviet Union.
 Prof. Sakharov admits that his "views were
 formed in the milieu of the scientific-technological
 intelligentsia", hence first of all Prof. Sakharov
 belongs to the Soviet ruling class, and as such he
 lost contact with the working class and peasants.
 This is very natural also through the fact that he
 has been a participant of the Pugwash con-
 ferences which were promoted and under the
 leadership of the Canadian-born American pluto-
 crat Cyrus S. Eaton. Eaton won the Lenin-Prize,
 since he never misses an opportunity to glorify
 the Soviet Union.
 The essay is written in a very eloquent language,
 with honey on his lips but murder in his heart,
 as the Chinese saying goes. While he writes about
 the "lofty idealism of socialism", he repeats an
 old trick of the bolsheviks. He proposes a 20'0
 tax de facto to be paid by the American tax-
 payers which tax would help to establish world-
 wide Soviet-style "socialism". If Americans ever
 will accept this blueprint of Soviet world leader-
 ship, indeed, they reduce themselves to a huge
 crowd of splendid idiots!
 7)  Promoters of the U.S.-Soviet "Holy Al-
 liance" like Prof. Sakharov claim that the con-
 verge of the superpowers are inevitable, other-
 wise there will be a thermonuclear war which
 means the extermination of mankind. They are
 right, - IF -there would be such war! But
 thanks God, mankind also includes the Amer-
 ican and Western billionaires, millionaires, pri-
 vate bankers and the Soviet intelligentsia and
 so on and so forth. The American and Soviet im-
 perialists do not want to exterminate themselves,
 hence there will be no thermonuclear war. The
 propaganda about the extermination of mankind
 is, however, a necessity for both ruling classes.
 In the Soviet Union they can rule with the aid
 of K.G.B. terror, in the U.S. they can exploit
 the American people through taxation. Fortunate-
 ly by now, the wind blows in the face of the im-
 perialist. The wheel of time is grinding them
 slowly and thoroughly. While biting each other
 like mad dogs, the "Holy Alliance" remains only
 in propaganda.
 One proof of the non-selfextermination policy
 of the superpowers is the "Treaty on the non-
 proliferation of nuclear weapons", also signed by
 the two superpowers on July 1, 1968. It was
 hailed by L. I Brezhnev at the Soviet-Hungarian
 friendship rally in Moscow on July 3, 1968 as
 the victory of Leninist foreign policy, and by

 September, 1968
 ese are the bogeymen. One should know Red
 China has no foreign debt, even the Soviet debts
 are paid. In Red China the Zionist influence is
 zero!
 In Red China Marxism-Leninism is not a dogma
 but a guide for action through the endless re-
 petition of the process: coming from the masses
 and going to the masses. They prefer historical
 materialism to idealism and metaphysics.
 J. A. Hobson, British economist wrote a defini-
 tion about imperialism in 1902: "Imperialism is
 the endeavour of the great controllers of industry
 to broaden the channels for the flow of their
 surplus wealth by seeking foreign markets and
 foreign investments to take off the goods and
 capital they cannot sell or use at home." That
 definition does not apply to Red China.
 Red China's emergence as a world power is
 one of the best assurances against the Soviet-
 American "Holy Alliance". The trend in Red
 China once more proves the effectiveness of the
 Natural Law.
 And now, let's compare the imperialists from
 an other point.
 How the ruling class in the Soviet Union
 prevents criticising their wisdom. The answer
 is simple: brutal force: prison, Siberia, insane
 asylum or death. The courts of "justice" are
 only windowdressing.
 But how are conditions in the U.S.? Indeed,
 there is political freedom in the U.S. There is
 d
 no K.G.B. in America. One can say anything an
 write anything in the U.S. but the F.B.I. doe
 not listen. They let everyone alone. Same applies
 to the C.I.A. (There are many Americans who
 do not let the C.I.A. alone.) Some judges are
 crooked as e.g. well explained in the book "The
 Bench is warped" by Alvin H. Gershenson. But
 for every crooked judge - often judges are sent
 to jail too - the majority of judges do their
 best to render equal justice under law. How then
 the ruling class is ruling Americans?
 The answer is the I.R.S., the internal revenue
 service or as often said: the tax-office. The Amer-
 ican imperialists control the U.S. Congress which
 makes the laws for I.R.S. Americans with no tar
 little property seldom are effective against the
 imperialists. Those who have property, either
 belong to the imperialists in various ways and
 of course do not fight against them. You can
 not bite the hand which feeds you, as the saying
 goes. Those who have property and decide an
 open fight, will soon feel the iron hand of I.R.S.
 and their property will not last too long.
 All Americans know, that at I.R.S. Uncle Sam
 is dead and is replaced by Uncle Shylock since
 1913 when Congress voted for the federal in-
 come tax. The voting was one of the worst
 swindle in the American history.
 I.R.S. can make the most pre,;osterous claim
 against anyone, and then force him to disprove
 it. If he can not disprove it - as in most cases
 , then I.R.S. can seize any U.S. citizen's home.
 automobile, bank account or any property or
 source of income without offering the slightest
 proof that he actually owns taxes. Yet I.R.S.
 through the media of Massenverblodung suc-
 ceeded in past years to make believe that those
 who became their victims are unpatrioting Amer-
 icans. In this respect "Reader's Digest" per-
 formed a good service to the American people by
 printing the articles of John Barron in August
 1967 issue under the title "Tyranny in the In-
 ternal Revenue Service" and in the September
 1968 issue under the title "Time for reform in
 the IRS".
 The trend in the U.S. calls for more and more
 taxes. I.R.S. of the federal government set a
 good example for state and city government,
 and American citizens became with all their po-
 licital freedom the most overtaxed people of the
 world. To make matters worse, they see that their
 tax-money is used in such ways and for such
 purposes which are against the American peo-
 ple's interests. Very possibly an open clash be-
 tween the U.S. government and the American
 people will occur, because of taxation. That's
 the way the U.S. started in 1773 with the Boston
 tea party against the British government, and
 that's the way Americans may end their own
 freely elected government.
 The U.S. is a good example that political free-
 dom without economic freedom has little value.
 Chief justice John Marshall correctly stated in
 the case McCulloch vs. Maryland on March 6,
 1819: "The power to tax includes the power to
 destroy."

 gyar" of September 1967. on pp.1-7 and p.16.

 And now, let's turn to the American people.
 In many countries, perhaps in most countries,
 peoples have little or no understanding about
 and for the American people. Let's take freedom
 at first.
 President Johnson said on July 8, 1968: "Free-
 dom to speak, freedom to listen, the full and open
 right to communicate and to reason together are
 essential to our fulfillment as individuals." Nice
 talk, indeed. President Johnson is not the first
 U.S. President who talked nicely. What Presi-
 dent Johnson did not say is: you Americans have
 the right to speak, and we the U.S. government
 have the right not to listen, and even if we listen,
 we will do what we think is right. That's what
 actually happens in the U.S.
 Chief Justice Earl Warren said on July 5,
 1968: "For a long, long time we have swept un-
 er the rug a number of problems that are basic
 American life. They have piled up."
 Originally the judiciary was designed as the
 eakest of the branches of the U.S. government,
 ut with a do-nothing or do-wrong Congress and
 a do-wrong Administration, the judiciary be-
 came the strongest branch.
 One may ask of course, why the American peo-
 ple permits all this since they have their polit-
 ical freedom? Are there not enough patriots like
 in 1773? Is there something wrong with Amer-
 icans???
 L. I. Brezhnev at the Soviet-Hungarian friend-
 ship rally at Moscow on July 3, 1968 claimed,
 that the "Great Society" is a rotting, degrading
 and disintegrating society. It is a fact that in
 the U.S. since 1960, the rate of crime is up to
 88% or 9 times more than the population growth.
 One rape occurs every 21 minutes and a mugging
 in every 2 minutes. One must only turn on a
 television set to see how crime is glorified.
 Last year in racial riots 84 Americans were
 slaughtered and 1,950 injured with 16,471 ar-
 rests and more than $160 million in property
 damage. And yet, looters and arsonists are cod-
 dled, kowtowed and rewarded by corrupt po-
 liticians and clergymen, while the police remained
 handcuffed. Major General Archibald Sproul re-
 signed his National Guard Commission with the
 following statement: "Our soldiers were not
 only told that they could not load their weapons,
 but they were told that they could not even use
 their rifles as clubs to protect themselves or stop
 looting." The streets of large cities are not any-
 more safe even in day time. Why free Americans
 permit this?
 Why Americans considered to send abroad the
 U.S. Armed Forces allegedly in defense of their
 homeland in WW I & WW II? Why Americans
 permitted the U.S. government - which is free-
 ly elected by them - to establish about 3,000
 military installations all over the world and be-
 come the self-appointed policeman of the world?
 Why the God-fearing Americans permitted the
 slaughter of more than 30,000 Americans the
 best sons of America? Why they permit killing
 the innocent people of Vietnam, burning their
 homes and destroying that little property what
 they have? Why Americans permitted that their
 prestige all over the world sunk to the level of
 Nazi-Germany or Stalinist Soviet Union?
 Here are some answers.
 For centuries the U.S. have been protected by
 the Atlantic and Pacific oceans against foreign
 invasion. The U.S. Founding Fathers learned
 from history. They included in the U.S. Constitu-
 tion all those factors which were building up a
 country and excluded those factors which destroy-
 ed countries.
 At the beginning of the century the Western
 European  colonial  empires  became  restless.
 Through their conflict of interest and by their
 cannibalistic nature a showdown was prepared.
 The events in Russia made matters even more
 complicated. These circumstances gave a splendid
 opportunity for greedy American profiteers, and
 they sold the idea to the American people, that
 their country is in danger and it is the duty
 of Americans to "make the world safe for dem-
 ocracy" with a "war to end all wars". Led by
 a
 Page 5
 noble motives the American people decided to
 interfere in other nations' internal affairs by
 armed forces. The point of no return was passed!
 The American opportunists having made their
 huge profits became imperialists. Through deceit
 right after WW I they sowed the seeds of WW II.
 They found a maniac by the name of Adolf Hitler
 to start WW II. The majority of the American
 people did not want to participate in WW 11.
 The fiction of the "four freedoms" and other
 slogans were not sufficient for Americans to
 enter WW II, so they had to be pushed in. Pearl
 Harbor did it. On December 7, 1941 very few
 Americans even thought, that they have been
 betrayed by their own government.
 Then came the victory and the big-sellout at
 Yalta where the signatures of F.D.R. and that
 of the bank-robber Stalin served the same pur-
 pose. F.D.R. not only sold out Eastern Europe
 but also the U.S. The Yalta agreement was an
 international crime committed by governments.
 Compared to that crime, the crimes of the Mafia
 and Cosa Nostra are only kindergarten-plays.
 Today in Vietnam not Europeans but Americans
 are slaughtered. The roots of Vietnam are ' at
 Yalta.
 After WW II of course the Soviet-American
 alliance outlived its purpose. Americans were
 told that the U.S. became the last citadel of
 freedom and as such must help the "good guys"
 all over the world. Mr. & Mrs. America firmly
 believed in Main Street that the "foreign aid"
 billions of their tax-money help the "good guys"
 abroad which, however, included the most cor-
 rupt government exploiting peoples. Americans
 are against the "bad guys"  who always are
 the communists.
 Since Americans do not listen to foreign broad-
 casts and do not read publications from abroad,
 especially not from the socialist camp, they could
 not realize, that the "good guys" government
 only help the communists, since exactly the corn-
 munists can tell the peoples that Americans are
 supporting their corrupt government. And so,
 the "foreign aid" made nothing but enemies to
 the U.S. Correctly the -peoples-,of various coun-
 tries claim Americans are responsible for their
 government, after all there is political freedom
 in the U.S.!
 While the "good guys" and "bad guys" concept
 costs billions of taxmoney, Americans realized
 that the U.S. government remained idle when it
 was necessary to act against the communists
 economically and politically (not with military
 force) in such cases as June 1953 in East-Berlin,
 July 1956 in Posnan, Poland, October-November
 1956 in Hungary and in August 1968 in Czecho-
 slovakia. Except do-nothing promises, say-nothing
 words and false crocodile tears, the U.S. gov-
 ernment (lid nothing.
 William C. Bullitt, once American Ambassador
 to France said on August 18, 1940: "The prob-
 lems of world affairs have become so complex,
 in this day of volcanic changes, that the average
 citizen has the greatest difficulty in understanding
 them and judging what is the best for this coun-
 try, before it is too late". That remarks was cor-
 rect in 1940 and even more correct in 1968.
 Rating poor in foreign languages, having not
 the true facts of life abroad and preoccupied with
 domestic problems, it is safe to say, the majority
 of Americans are rather confused about the in-
 ternational situation, e.g. they can not grasp how
 the spyship was grabbed by North Koreans. The
 case of the Pueblo remains a mystery to most
 Americans.
 There are various types of American, of cour,,c.
 Some of them believe in their "god". By pray-
 ing, they say: Oh Lord ! Almighty U.S. Dollar. ..
 They have three things on their mind: dollars,
 dollars, and more dollars.          -
 Some Americans have lost all their faith. They
 think, that Armageddon is just around the cor-
 ner, and only the reappearance of Jesus Christ
 can save America (including the dollar) and
 the rest of the world (after the U.S.).
 Some Americans are fighting against "the in-
 ternational communist conspiracy" and selling
 signs of "Impeach Earl Warren" (the Chief,
 Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court).
 And then there are the hippies, yippies, beatniks
 and flapniks. They hate everything and every-
 body, but most of all: The Soap!
 While some of those Americans are getting

 a lot of publicity concerning the economic-polit-
 ical life in the U.S. they amount to little or
 nothing.
 Bernard  Shaw once wisely remarked :     "A
 healthy nation is as unconscious of its nationality
 as a healthy man of his bones. But if you break
 a nation's nationality it will think of nothing
 else but getting it set again."
 Same applies to freedom. Americans never
 were slaves or serfs. The acid test was not yet
 made. Presently rather confused but still calm
 and calculating Americans are not easily bluffed
 either by the American or Soviet imperialists.
 The rugged truth always triumphs over illusions
 and deceit. The Patrick Henry and Paul Revere
 type of Americans are here. The platform of
 the Liberty Party of 1843: "When freemen un-
 sheathe the sword, it should be to strike for
 Liberty, not for despotism" still prevails. Amer-
 icans did realized, they have been betrayed, and
 now they are cautious. The claim that the Amer-
 ican society is on its deathbed exist only in the
 mind of the enemies of Americans. Perhaps,
 Americans still need some more "bone-breaking",
 more insults against their nationality and free-
 dom, perhaps they had or having enough already.
 The resistence to the gun control is significant.
 Such control will not stop or even reduce crime,
 solong TV-programs glorify crime. And besides
 that in an open clash it means nothing. Hunga-
 rians did not fight the 'tyrants in 1956 with
 "bare hands" but with the guns of the Hungarian
 Armed Forces. It is not the gun which decides
 the victory but the spirit which handles the gun!
 The most important cause of internal problems
 of the U.S. - which are well exploited by the
 enemies of the Americans - is the misunderstnd-
 ing of the concept of equality based on the Decla-
 ration of Independence, that: "All men art creat-
 ed equal. They are endowed by their creator with
 certain inherent and inalianable rights ...".
 The original text of Thomas Paine reads: "All
 men are created equal and independent: That
 from that equal creation they derive rights in-
 herent and inalianable". This statement is un-
 equivocal. It is political truism. We are all born
 equal, politically. From both a social and philo-
 sophical point of view, the statement is incon-
 trovertible. And when Thomas Paine wrote that
 sentence he had in mind that kings and royalty
 were not born, superior to other people. There
 was no divine right in the political philosophy of
 Thomas Paine. To simplify the statement, it
 meant equality before the law : not equality in
 person.
 For those who do not believe in God, the state-
 ment of the Declaration of Independence has no
 meaning, since.those rights originate from God.
 Those who believe in God, know that life is based
 on the Natural Law where the fittest survive.
 That is proved by the history of the world.
 Solon, the lawgiver 2,500 years ago laid down
 the maxim that "equality causes no war". Those
 who believe in equality sooner or later will real-
 ize that others believe in un-equality and ultimate-
 ly will be subjugated. The struggle between
 masters and slaves will go on forever !
 The struggle over the concept of equality on
 individual, national and international level caused
 problems since ages. In Ancient Greece Aristotle
 was wrestling with it, in his work of "Politics".
 He found no solution. In Athene seemingly they
 found a solution. Legally all citizens were equal,
 but reality only the 90,000 citizens with property,
 the rest of 500,000 Athenians were slaves and
 were considered no citizens at all.
 About 2,300 years later James Madison (The
 Federalist; Other Writings of James Madison
 Vo.IV.) tried to solve the problem of unequality.
 He found no solution.
 Some vote-chasing politicians and money-chas-
 ing clergymen hope to solve that problem by
 race-mixing. The results are race-riots in the
 U.S. The human and material damage caused
 by race-riots in 1968 is worse than in 1967. Years
 ago the blackman in the U.S. had many friends
 amongst whiteman. By now they have more
 enemies. The whiteman knows his taxmoney sup-
 ports the leaders of the race-riots. The leaders
 of the two major political parties, the Tweedle-
 dum Party and the Tweedledee Party are accus-
 ing each other, while Americans know well, basi-
 cally there is no difference between them. They
 both are serving the interests of the American
 imperialists. The water in the American kettle
 is boiling and steaming. The steam is artifically
 suppressed, so long the kettle will blow up. And
 that is what the Soviet imperialists are wait-
 ing for.
 On the other hand the Soviet kettle is even in
 worse condition than its American counterpart.
 Prague was not the equivalence of Chicago. The
 Soviet kettle already is blowing up, and that's
 what Peking is waiting for. The Chinese are no
 race-mixers, neither in Red China nor in the
 U.S. or elsewhere. They know what they want,
 and they are going to get it. Farseeing American
 leaders do some serious thinking about the im-
 proving of relations with Red China, instead of
 the Soviet Union. One difficulty is the member-
 ship of Red China at the United Nations. Already
 Peking claims, the UN needs Red China more,
 than Red China the UN. Time is changing fast
 in our days !
 Speaking of un-equality on international level
 in East-West relations it is interesting to com-
 pare the historic events of Hungary in 1956 and
 the historic events of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
 In 1956 the American-Soviet imperialists were
 looking for another "little" war, i.e. anything
 but WW III. Prof. Zbigniew Brezinski, director
 ,of the Columbia University's Research Institute
 on Communist Affairs correctly stated the pos-
 sibility of a Hungarian civil war in 1956 (NY
 Times 8/22/68 p.20L+col.8) Janos Kadar pre-
 vented the "little" war in Hungary. In 1968,
 there is no need for "little" war. There is Viet-
 nam.
 In 1956 Hungarians like all other Eastern
 Europeans believed in the "liberation" promises
 of the Eisenhower-Dulles clique as were told
 them through Radio Free Europe. Then the hour
 stroke on October 23, 1956 and the "champions
 of freedom" the U.S. government stood still.
 The hypocrisy of the U.S. government was ex-
 posed. Cowardly they pushed the whole matter
 to the UN which kept on debating. The editorial
 of the Wall Street Journal stated on December 11,
 1956: "The Soviet world, at any rate, will never
 be the same as was before October 23, 1956."
 The Slovaks and the Czechs, like anyone else,
 learned from the events in 1956. In 1968 they
 expected nothing from the U.S. or the UN.
 Janos Kadar saved Hungary in 1956 to become
 a Vietnam. It was a brutal action but like a sur-
 geon he knew it is better to lose a limb than the
 whole body. Vietnam is more brutal than the
 Soviet onslaught against Hungary in 1956. The
 onslaught, nevertheless, remains unjustified by
 Western moral and legal standards, and also ac-
 cording to the teaching of Marxism and Lenin-
 ism. In 1968 there was no need for a Janos Kadar
 in Czechoslovakia.
 The Slovaks and Czechs argued with the in-
 vading Soviet troops in Russian language. There
 was no fighting, only 100-300 deaths. Writing
 about Czechs and Slovaks "Pravda" of August
 22, 1968 stated : ". , . the century-old traditions
 of Slav affinity ..." There is no Hungarian af-
 finity to the Soviet Union. Hungarians belong
 to the great family of Turanian peoples. They
 are not Slavs. Hungarians did not argue with
 the Soviet troops but actually defeated the Soviet
 armed forces which occupied Hungary at that
 time. Not with their "bare hands" but with Sov-
 iet-made guns in full cooperation with the Hun-
 garian Armed Forces. About 30,000 Hungarians
 died in that battle.
 Some professional Western observers  (NY
 Times of 9/10/68 p.1. col.2-4 & p.16.col.1.) glori-
 fied the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet
 armed forces as a "brilliantly and faultlessly
 executed military operation", and a "million-man
 magnitude". They also claim "The Soviet force
 employed in the intervention in Hungary in 1956
 was both considerably smaller and much less ad-
 vanced than what Moscow sent to Czechoslova-
 kia in 1968".
 The facts are that in 1956 the brainless bullies
 in Moscow never in their worst nightmare fore-
 saw the dead communist bodies dangling on the
 lampposts of Budapest. The Hungarian people
 used the element of surprise and completely de-
 feated those Soviet armed forces which were oc-
 cupying Hungary. In 1968 Moscow's leadership
 of Marxism-Leninism in bad shape through Red
 China, they tried to regain some of past "glories".
 Therefore, after a careful preparation of six
 months they invaded Czechoslovakia by knowing
 September, 1968.
 well that : a) The Slovaks and Czechs will not
 fight; b) the U.S. remains an idle onlooker. The
 invasion of Czechoslovakia remains the "magni-
 tude" of frantic and desperate bullies. And those
 "professional Western observers" who try to
 glorify the shameful action of the Soviet armed
 forces remain as phony as three-dollar bills.
 The "observation" no doubt intends to create
 fear for those who are against Soviet imperial--
 ism. Indirectly it is, another form of promotion
 for the "Holy Alliance".
 In 1956 Imre Nagy (not to be confused with
 Ferenc Nagy, a traitor paid by Radio Free Eu-
 rope) wanted to withdraw from the Warsaw
 Treaty and did establish a genuine multi-party
 democracy in Hungary which lasted to November
 4, 1956. Imre Nagy was executed by the Soviet'
 imperialists.
 In 1968 Alexander Dubcek said, that the "al-
 liance with the Soviet Union is the alpha and
 omega of our foreign policy," for which he was
 arrested, beaten and humiliated. The Soviet im-
 perialists recognize only complete subjugation.
 Reporting about Czech refugees in Austria,
 the NY Times writes 8/31/68 p.2.L+ col.6+7) :
 ". . . is fairly well dressed, drives his own car .. .
 He is unlike the 200,000 ragged and desperate
 individuals who fled from Hungary 12 years
 ago . . ." About 80,000 of those "ragged and des-
 perate" Hungarians already returned to Hun-
 gary. There were some Hungarians who arrived
 in car in Austria, e.g. the fascist-stalinist crim-
 inal Monsignor Bela Varga who is on the pay-
 roll of Radio Free Europe serving well the in-
 terests of the American imperialists AND the
 Vatican.
 One may suspect the tacit approval of the U.S.
 government for the events in 1956 and in 1968.
 In 1956 it was Hungary with not the best rela-
 tions to the U.S. In 1968 in the U.S. many leaders
 saw in Czechoslovakia one of the principal sup-
 plier of arms to North Vietnam.
 The U.S. government under the Administra-
 tion of President Truman returned the gold of
 the Hungarian National Bank-which they seized
 after WW II-to the stalinist criminal-regime of
 Rakosi-Gero. It did not happened in the case of
 Czechoslovakia. Fortunately, the U.S. did not
 return the St. Stephan's Crown.
 In the American emigration, there are few
 Czechs and Slovaks participating in anti-com-
 munist activities. Those who protested during
 August 1968 were mostly American-born citizens.
 The Hungarian emigration has strong anticom-
 munist groups, yet they became totally ineffec-
 tive, because their leaders have been the pretend-
 ers and dissemblers of the semi-dictatorship of
 Horthy regime, opportunists, and fascist and/or
 stalinist criminals of Nazi resp. Stalinist regime.
 The so-called Hungarian Committee under the
 leadership of arch-criminal Monsignor Bela Var-
 ga is paid by Radio Free Europe. That so-called
 private organization in service of the American
 imperialists nipped in bud all genuine attempts
 of Hungarians as well as in the emigration to
 improve the U.S.-Hungarian relations. Not by
 force of course, but through the power of the
 purse and hypocrisy Those bandits of the so-
 called Hungarian Committee intend to "liberate"
 Hungary. The chief bandit is Monsignor Bela
 Varga. Next to him is Maj. Gen. Bela Kiraly, a
 nazi warcriminal.
 There is a big difference between Hungary and
 Czechoslovakia. Historic Hungary was dismem-
 bered after WW I through the dictate of Trianon
 by the Western European colonial powers and
 the tacit approval of the U.S. Hungary lost two-
 third of its territory and population, e.g. Transyl-
 vania which was an integral part of Historic
 Hungary for 900 years was "given" to Rumania.
 Czechoslovakia also benefited. In order to "jus-
 tify" the dictate of Trianon the West felt com-
 pelled to defame and slander Hungarians in every
 conceivable ways. In 1956 the West rather em-
 barassed by the Hungarian events, praised the
 Hungarians. In 1968 the Slovaks but especially
 the Czechs from the point of propaganda had
 no difficulties in the West.
 In 1956 there was absolutely no anti-semitism
 in Hungary, despite the facts that about 800
 of the Rakosi-Gero Stalinist criminal regime con-
 sisted of the Jews. The Jews in Hungary (about
 100,000 of the 10,000,000 Hungarians) were also
 against the Rakosi-Gero regime.

 September, 1968
 Very little is known about the "triangle", i.e.
 the interlocking connections between: 1) Hun-
 garian  revolt,  2)  Israel's  aggression  against
 Egypt, 3) U.S. Presidential election.
 There are 14,000 Jews in Czechoslovakia out
 of 14 million Czechs and Slovaks. In 1968 was no
 anti-semitism in Czechoslovakia but all sign in-
 dicate Zionism was involved.
 In 1956 the traight head-on-clash with the Sov-
 iet Union temporarily failed. The "social scient-
 ists",  "Kremlinologists"  and  other  "experts"
 claimed Hungarians committed a mistake. In
 1968 the Czechs and Slovaks used a different ap-
 proach, the Good Soldier Schweik method, result-
 ing in surrender by the 14 points e.g. that Czecho-
 slovakia's political course "be changed in ac-
 cordance with the Soviet type of socialism".
 In certain respects 1956 and 1968 created sim-
 ilarities. The Hungarian people like the Slovaks
 and the Czechs consider the Soviet troops as oc-
 cupation troops, and the Soviet Union as an op-
 pressor. In 1956 Hungary and in 1968 Czechoslo-
 vakia became the paradise for opportunitists, trai-
 tors and puppets of Moscow. Having abandoned
 ture Marxism-Leninism and following the path
 of imperialism the Soviet leaders have no other
 choice then do what they did in 1956 and in
 1968: betraying Marx and Lenin!
 There are few written definitions in the West
 about opportunists. The best definition was writ-
 ten by V. I. Lenin, as reproduced in "Alkoto
 Magyar" of September 1967 (p.9.col.2.). That
 definition can be applied to all opportunists every-
 where and at any time.
 Concerning Soviet imperialism related to Hun-
 gary the motions of two distinguished U.S. Sen-
 ators should be mentioned.
 According to U.S. Congressional Records of
 August 31, 1960, p.18785, col.1+2, Congressman
 Michael Feighan from Ohio, the U.S. State De-
 partment sent a telegramme to Tito of Yugosla-
 via on Friday, November 2, 1956 with the follow-
 ing text: "The government of the United States
 does not look with favor upon governments un-
 friendly to the Soviet Union on the borders of
 the Soviet Union." Senator Frank J. Lausche
 from Ohio requested the U.S. State Departrreiit
 to clarify this alleged statement. On June 20,
 1963 Frederick G. Dutton, Assistant Secreta
 of State replied in a two-page letter stating tha
 "No such message was sent". Who is telling the
 truth? Or, maybe did the C.I.A. send such
 message???
 Senator Vance Hartke from Indiana, on July
 15, 1968 proposed to offer a haven for Cardinal
 Mindszenty in the U.S. Cardinal Mindszenty is
 the living symbol of unconditional and uncom-
 promising resistance against all tyrannies. His
 spirit is as unbroken as before. It is a mistake,
 however, to think Cardinal Mindszenty has great
 sympathy for the U.S. The U.S. Embassy in Bu-
 dapest, de facto is his prison. It is a big ques-
 tion, whether his writings ever will be published
 as actually he wrote them. If Cardinal Mind-
 szenty could leave his prison in Budapest in such
 dignity which he deserves, based on the respect
 and admiration of all freedom loving peoples,
 then Senator Hartke's proposition should be sup-
 ported by all means.
 Cardinal Mindszenty always kept Bela Varga
 in contempt, yet Bela Varga pretends to have
 the same ideas as Cardinal Mindszenty. While
 Cardinal Mindszenty suffered from Nazi as well
 as Stalinist tyrannies, Bela Varga that Mephisto-
 pheles, a stooge of the Zionists and imperialists
 served both the Nazis and the Stalinists. Yet
 Lela Varga, who is responsible for Law VII. in
 jungary which was used against Cardinal Mind-
 nty by the Rakosi-Gero Moscow puppets Sta-
 linist gangsters, still informs the American public
 about  his  "anti-communist"  feelings,  e.g.  on
 August 21, 1968 during a television appearance.
 Varga is responsible for the murder of thousands
 and thousands of innocent true Hungarians.
 At this point one may ask: what all the fore-
 going has to do with East-West trade, and the
 establishment of the Federation of Eastern Eu-
 ropean Countries?
 Here are the answers: 1) politics is nothing
 but the concentrated form of economics. It is
 unrealistic to consider East-West trade purely
 from commercial point of view' 2) through in-
 terlocking connections one problem can not be
 detached from the other. Economic, national, in-
 ternational, religious and racial matters are in-
 fluencing each other, according to the skill, talents
 and  effectiveness of the leaders.  A narrow-
 minded rigid attitude in international matters
 simply is out-of-date. It's passe. The world did
 not shrink together. It remained the same size
 but there are all kind of advancements. One can
 not say anymore, that such and such country is
 far away, hence out of interests. There is no
 country far away anymore. One must take the
 whole world as a unit, and handle it as it is, not
 as one thinks, it should be!
 But what is the role of Eastern European coun-
 tries in this world? And, what will be? One must
 consider the past in order to understand the
 present and calculate the future.
 In the past Western European colonial empires
 used the Eastern European countries as a protec-
 tive belt against the invasions of the East e.g.
 the Mongol and 'Ottoman empire. Fomenting reli-
 gious, national differences and hatred, they pre-
 vented any type of unity. Divide and rule was
 their method. They succeeded for centuries. By
 now, the colonial empires disappeared and two
 powers the Soviet Union and Red China emerged.
 The whiteman is hated all over the world because
 of Western European colonialism and their U.S.
 support. Eastern Europeans never were colonial
 exploiters. This facts already have been well ex-
 ploited by Eastern European traders by pro-
 moting commerce in former colonial countries.
 But there are more possibilities for Eastern
 Europeans. In the beginning of this century
 Western European imperialists became cannibal-
 istic and destroyed themselves. At our present
 the two superpowers demonstrate the same can-
 nibalism for the benefit of the world. Since 1911
 with the defeat of the Ching dynasty in China,
 and 1917 with the defeat of the Romanoff dyn-
 asty in Russia the center of gravity if internation-
 al powerpolitics moved toward the East. The fu-
 ture of Eastern Europeans are in the East, not in
 he West. The West still considers Eastern Euro-
 ean countries as a safety belt. 1956 and 1968
 re the best proofs of this observation.
 The West through hypocrisy under the cloak
 of Jewish-christian religions lost credit every-
 where. In Asia Red China and the Soviet Union
 emerged. The Moslem world of 500,000,000 people
 are searching for unity.
 In Europe one must realize that the heart is
 Germany and the soul is France. Today Europe's
 heart is divided by Yalta, and the soul refused
 to be an American satellite. One of the most in-
 teresting book about the real trend in Europe is
 described in a book "An Empire of 400,000,000
 people" by Jean Thiriart (52, avenue Louise
 Bruxelles 3, Belgium). All sign indicate that the
 old nations of Europe in the West as well in the
 East are able to co-operate more and more. Those
 who consider Eastern European countries as
 protective belt are losing their power. As the
 trend continues Eastern and Western European
 countries will be united but free from all influence
 of the Soviet Union and the U.S.
 There is an interesting diplomatic work by
 Prof. Edmund Malnasi, President of the Hun-
 garian Union in Vienna, Austria, under the title
 "after disengagement - Peace in Europe after
 disengagement from Russia and U.S.A." (20 pp.
 copyright 1963), generally known as Malnasi-
 Plan.
 Prof. Malnasi gives a plan for a Federation of
 Eastern  European countries,  which  he calls:
 Danube Union. This plan is based on past and
 present economic-political realities and can be
 regarded as the modernized form of a plan which
 was propagated by the Grand Orient Lodge of
 Free Masons between 1935-1939.
 Prof. Malnasi was born in Transylvania and
 is the author of 47 economic-political scientific
 works. His works are well-known throughout the
 Moslem world and Asia. As socialist all his life
 he was a prisoner of ten years of the Rakosi-Gero
 Moscow-puppet Stalinist criminal regime in Hun-
 gary.
 Hungary is the most natural cultural and com-
 mercial bridge between East and West. Not only
 geographically but through the fact that Hun-
 garians are neither Slavic nor Germanic people
 but belong to the Great Turanian Family of peo-
 ples whose ancestors were the Sumerians. Tura-
 nian peoples live on the Euro-Asian continent.
 There is no need to start bridge-building be-
 tween the Turanian peoples, since it has been
 Page 7
 existing for ages but it had been partly neglected
 by the Turanian peoples themselves, and partly
 obscured by others.
 A good example for this existing bridge is the
 following cooperation. The Pak-Friends of Hun-
 gary in Rawalpindi, West Pakistan under the
 leadership of Capt. H. A. Ayaz Khan is the same
 organization as the World Hungarian Union, in
 Vienna Austria, under the leadership of Prof.
 Edmund Malnasi. Dr. Malnasi in the West has
 the most up-to-date file about economic-political
 factors of Hungary. He promotes true Christian
 principles. Dr. Ayaz Khan is also the President
 of the Tiszta Magyar Corporation in Rawalpindi,
 and is in close cooperation with the Pee-Jee
 Brothers Trading Corporation in Sialkot, West
 Pakistan. He promotes the true principles of
 Islam. The Kadar-regime is fully aware of Turan-
 ism and with the aid of their real friends in
 Pakistan, the Hungarian state export corpora-
 tions are able to sell quality product Made in
 Hungary not only in Pakistan but throughout
 the Moslem world.
 The Rawalpindi group cooperates directly, the
 Vienna group, indirectly with the Kadar-regime.
 All participating parties make their fair share
 of profit.
 "Alkoto Magyar" closely cooperates with the
 Rawalpindi AND the Vienna groups. Without
 any direct cooperation with the Kadar-regime it
 is established to participate in creating condi-
 tions favorable for investment-triangle trade be-
 tween East and West but especially between the
 U.S. and Hungary based not on peaceful but on
 competitive co-existence.
 Politics is the concentrated form of economics.
 Wladyslaw Gomulka correctly stated (Przemo-
 wienia 1959, Warsaw, 1960 p. 562) : "The coun-
 try which does not develop new methods of pro-
 duction . . . both in industry and agriculture, has
 only one prospect - the prospect of backward-
 ness, poverty and weakness. And the lesson of
 history is clear: the backward and the weak are
 always beaten. The backward and the poor are
 the rubbish of history". This is an excellent state-
 ment for reality, and against all illusions and
 delusions of the concept of equality.
 Eastern European countries must develop their
 countries by all means through all countries but
 there is absolutely no need that the Soviet Union
 plays the leading role. The U.S. is in a much bet-
 ter situation to develop the industry and agricul-
 ture of Eastern European countries than the
 Soviet Union. The U.S. has more know-how, more
 material and its imperialists are not so reckless
 as the imperialists of the Soviet Union. Remem-
 ber 1956 and 1968! The Soviet Union has no
 moral right to preach about Marxism-Leninism
 anymore. They have thrown those teaching over-
 board and replaced it with their naked and brutal
 imperialism.
 While American imperialists are trying harder
 and harder to come to an agreement with the
 Soviet imperialists, there are realistic Amer-
 icans who know if goods do not cross the fron-
 tiers guns will. As the saying goes, an ounce of
 prevention is more worth than a pound of cure.
 East-West trade is the best prevention of a mili-
 tary war between the East and West. The East-
 West detente is a negative concept. Nobody ever
 created anything in this world with a negative
 attitude. East-West trade is the positive and
 creating approach to settle international prob-
 lems. East-West trade is the vehicle of creative
 forces.
 On page 11 of the September 1967 issue of
 "Alkoto Magyar", there is the resolution of the
 American Bankers Association for Foreign Trade.
 That resolution is the finest blueprint for East-
 West trade void of all hypocrisy and in accordance
 with the Natural Lazv. One must realize, that
 bankers are no promoters of charitable institu-
 tions. Banks, even if one calls it a national asso-
 ciation are established to lend money to those
 who are the best prospect to make profit for
 themselves and also for the bankers. The best
 prospects to make profit are those who realistic-
 ally are able to seize up and satisfy the need of
 the people. The large U.S. manufacturing cor-
 porations are the best proofs for this statements.
 Those corporations are not built on any abstract
 ideology but on the support of their satisfied
 customers first of all, and then of the satisfied
 stockholders and employees. Any type of pro-
 paganda can try to twist these facts, only to

 AN OPEN LETTER TO THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS
 A Basic Right: The Right To Criticize Governments
 The Charter of the United Nations was agreed
 at the San Francisco Conference on June 26,
 1945. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 was adopted by the General Assembly in Paris
 on December 10, 1948 by a vote of 48 to 0. The
 Charter of the UN starts as: We the peoples of
 the United Nations determined . . . to reaffirm
 faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity
 and the worth of human person .. .
 According to the interpretation of the Charter,
 in any country, a person who suffers a legal
 wrong and can get no redress from the courts,
 is a victim of the tyranny of the government.
 It is understood practically the UN can not be
 expected to render justice to all those persons
 who suffered injustice from the tyranny of gov-
 ernments. It is also reasonable to expect that
 the UN consider such injustices where a great
 number of people e.g. an entire nation is in-
 volved.
 Does that mean, however, that an individual
 case should be disregarded? It can't be, since the
 great masses of peoples consist of individuals.
 An individual case just because it is an indi-
 vidual case can affect the masses of the peoples.
 In an individual case a government expects the
 least resistance, opposition and retaliation, and
 for these reasons, its tyranny becomes the most
 brutal. Precisely an individual case of legal in-
 justice is the most suitable to demonstrate to
 which extent a government tramples on funda-
 mental human rights and discard human dignity.
 Indeed an individual case can expose the bar-
 barous despotism of a government. And the only
 way to bring a despotic government under con-
 trol is to expose its hypocrisy and brutality be-
 fore the great masses of peoples. Then and only
 then, they will realize the worth of the human
 person !
 Criminal libel case No. 3495/1961 of Manhat-
 tan is an excellent case to prove the tyranny of
 the U.S. government. On November 1, 1961 I
 Reflections -
 If I were a Republican
 Or called a Democrat
 I shall confess I could not tell
 Which party was a bat.
 "Republican" and "Democrat"
 Ere long will not be heard;
 It's "liberal" or "conservative"
 Each one a dirty word.
 The pressure groups now rule
 the land,
 And politicians scare;
 They'll give and give and
 give again
 Until the cupboard's bare.
 And then will come the
 man and horse
 His countrymen to save,
 And all too late the fools will find
 Each has become a slave.
 For history repeats itself;
 Pied Pipers peep and peep.
 And many of our brain-washed men
 Will follow them like sheep.

 was publicly indicted for criminal libel by the
 grand jury of Manhattan. After that, for the
 net four years not I, the accused, but the de
 facto accusers did not dare to come to the court
 - a jury trial -. The prosecution postponed the
 case thirty-seven (37) times until the case could
 not come to trial anymore, because of legal-tech-
 nical matters. Through these 37 postponements
 the  U. S.  government did  b r u t a I 1~ violate
 the U.S. Constitution (Bill of Rights, Phar.VI.),
 the fundamental principles of the Charter of the
 United Nations, and The Universal Declaration
 of Human Rights (Articles 5,6,7,8,9,10 and 11).
 Pe se from the point of legality and morality, it
 makes no difference that the government of a
 member-nation of the UN violated the principles
 of the Charter involving one individual or the
 masses. The question is to which extent it com-
 mitted that violation, and whether the UN tole-
 rates such violation? Since,, if the Charter can
 be violated without impunity by its members,
 the Charter becomes worthless, hence the UN
 defeats its own purpose!
 In criminal case No. 3495/1961 the U.S. gov-
 ernment violated all internationally accepted legal
 and moral standards and displayed its moral
 weakness. Pages. 19-20 of the September 1967
 issue of "Alkoto Magyar" and my letter to the
 District Attorney of Manhattan of September 10,
 1968 give sufficient expalanation of the case. More
 details can be read from various letters to various

 My circular letter of 8-page    ted as July 1,
 1967 under the title: The wast of American tax-
 payers' money by the C.I.A." gives further in-
 formation through interlocking connections about
 case No. 3495/1961. It gives indications how the
 U.S. government operates Radio Free Europe
 which finances the so-called Hungarian Commit-
 tee. In this circular some data is given about the
 fascist-Stalinist background of Monsignor Bela
 Varga - the president of the Hungarian Com-
 mittee - who is protected by the U.S. government
 AND the Vatican. The opportunists, pretenders,
 dissemblers and criminals of the so-called Hun-
 garian Committee greatly influence the American
 public and all of them pose as "anti-communist"
 claiming to represent the Hungarian people. Ac-
 tually they represent only themselves and their
 paymasters.  The  arch-criminal  remains  Bela
 Varga.
 It is a fact that Bela Varga as the president of
 the so-called Hungarian Committee received huge
 amounts of money from American individuals and
 corporations for those Hungarians who arrived
 in the U.S. under the label of "freedom fighters".
 All signs indicate that Bela Varga has stolen
 the money and used for himself. He invested it
 in legitimate business enterprises but paid no
 income and other taxes. I notified I.R.S. and
 I.R.S. acknowledges my letter   but seemingly
 nothing is done against Bela Varga. Either he
 is smarter than Al Capone, or I.R.S. just leaves
 the present Al Capones undisturbed.
 Chapter XV, Article 100 of the Charter of the
 United Nations writes: In the performance of
 their duties the Secretary-General and the staff
 shall not seek or receive instructions from any
 government or from any other authority external
 of the organization.
 The purpose of this letter is to find out whether
 there is a possibility to hold an open hearing
 within the UN to expose all facts of criminal
 libel case No. 3495/1961 including the tyranny
 of the U.S. government, which suppressed those
 facts. The record of that open hearing should be
 available to all those who request it.
 The question is now, is the UN able and willing
 to bite the hand which feeds it i.e. is the finan-
 cial support of the U.S. government to the UN
 more important, than upholding the principles
 upon which the UN was built? Further does
 the UN respect its own rules and regulations?
 Legal technical obstacles are subordinated to the
 principles and can be changed. If there is a will,
 there is a way.
 This writing has many purposes and objectives.
 One of them is - in moral terms - the indict-
 ment against the U.S. government. Morality is
 superior to legality, and legality is superior to
 brutal force.
 There is an American saying: It's better to
 light a candle, than curse the darkness. Tyrants
 do not understand the meaning of that simple
 saying. Therefore, they have to be hauled before
 the people, and make them understand!
