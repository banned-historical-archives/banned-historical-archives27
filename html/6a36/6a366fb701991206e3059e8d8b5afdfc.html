 VIETNAM
 Preliminary analysis indicates that the air strikes
 against North Vietnam's oil installations are already
 causing distribution problems, but no serious difficul-
 ties in the immediate availability of petroleum for
 transport and other essential needs are anticipated.
 The strikes, in any case, have given the Communists an
 occasion to freshen their rou~tirne propaganda attacks on
 the US, although Soviet criticism has been restrained.
 In South Vietnam, as allied forces continued to inflict
 heavy losses on the Viet Cong, the Buddhist Institute
 formally announced a temporary truce with the government.

 VIETNAM
 Seven of the ten principal
 bulk petroleum storage facili-
 ties in North Vietnam--compris-
 ing almost 90 percent of North
 Vietnam's total storage capacity
 --were attacked by US aircraft
 last week.  Preliminary analysis
 of the effects of the strikes in-
 dicates that the DRV is probably
 already experiencing some prob-
 lems in the distribution of pe-
 troleum and that a major reorgan-
 ization of the import and primary
 distribution system will be ne-
 cessary.  Despite these difficul-
 ties, no serious problems in the
 immediate availability of petro-
 leum for transport or other es-
 sential needs are anticipated.
 Preliminary analysis of pho-
 tography indicates severe damage
 to the important installation at
 Hanoi, where virtually all the
 facilities were apparently dam-
 aged or destroyed.  The instal-
 lation at Haiphong--the largest
 and only import terminal in
 North Vietnam--apparently was
 about 38 percent destroyed by
 the strike on 29 June, but a num-
 ber of tanks remained intact. The
 three oil jetties also were un-
 damaged.  This target was struck
 again on 7 July.                  ~
 Initial information indicates
 that damage to the other five in-
 :>tallations was less severe and

 Propaganda Reaction to
 POL Strikes
 The Communists drew on the
 US air strikes to freshen up
 their routine propaganda attacks
 on US policy in Vietnam.  None
 of the statements indicated that
 t:~e  strikes  had  generated  any
 b~~sic change in the attitude of
 H~~noi, Peking, or Moscow.
 Hanoi called the strikes a
 nE~w escalation of the war but
 limited its threats of retalia-
 tion to promises that the Libera-
 tion Front would attack US forces
 ir.~ South Vietnam.  It also played
 up the air strikes as .being di-
 rected primarily against civil-
 ian targets.  Although Peking and
 Moscow echoed this line, neither
 pictured the strikes as necessi-
 tating any comparable escalation
 of Chinese or Soviet support for
 Vietnam.  The propaganda threat
 of foreign volunteers in Vietnam
 was revived for the first time
 in many months--this time by
 I~'o:rth  Korea .
 Peking used the strikes to
 il:Lustrate "collusion" between
 this US and the USSR to force a
 pe~~ceful settlement of the war

 Peking's reiteration of support,

 pacification Operation MACON south-

 The pattern of allied success
 was repeated in the delta prov-
 inces of Vinh Long and Ken Hoa,
 where South Vietnamese Army (ARVN)
 units killed 264 Viet Cong in sep-
 arate engagements on 5 and 6 July.
 Communist-initiated military
 activity during the week was high-
 lighted by mortar attacks on 2 and
 3 July against US/Vietnamese Spe-

 dian border in Pleiku and Tay Ninh
 provinces, and by a penetration as-

 Political Developments
 In South Vietnam
 In a formal communique, the
 Buddhist Institute on 3 July called
 for a period of good will between
 the Saigon. government and the Bud-
 dhists, indicating that it would
 cease opposition at least until an
 extraordinary session of its parent
 organization, the Unified Buddhist
 Association (UBA}, convenes in a
 few weeks.
 This latest Buddhist position
 was apparently made possible by
 conciliatory letters from Premier
 Ky to moderate Institute Chairman
 Tam Chau last week which promised
 reparations for damaged pagodas
 and clemency for Buddhist clergy
 members and lower ranking non-Com~~
 munists involved in the "struggle
 movement.  Immediately after the
 Buddhist communique was issued, the
 government responded by releasing
 about 300 prisoners--including some
 100 Buddhist monks and nuns.
 The UBA conference may extend
 the truce for lack of any real al-
 ternative.  No change of heart is
 likely, however, among its polit-
 ical-activists, who are responsive
 to militant monk Tri Quang and have
 built the UBA into a formidable po-
 litical force, primarily in central
 Vietnam.  Formal UBA participation
 in the September elections does not
 seem likely at this point.  The
 L'BA, however, could still exert
 some positive influence by unoffi-
 cially supporting candidates on the
 local level.
 Despite the public dialogue
 with Tam Chau, the government is
 not relying on many persons c
 to the Buddhist Institute.
 Premier Ky's new cabinet, the for-
 mal announcement of which was again
 delayed, may retain the one minis-~
 ter close to the institute, but his
 responsibilities are likely to be
 reduced.
 Meanwhile, the government has
 arrested and may court-martial five
 generals, including former I Corps
 commander General Thi, who were in-
 volved in the recent antigovernment
 movement.

 SUKARNO'S POWER DWINDLING
 Indonesian leaders have made
 decisive and perhaps conclusive
 gains in their phased campaign to
 relieve President Sukarno of his
 power.
 The nation's top policy-making
 body, the Provisional People's Con-
 sultative Assembly (MPRS), on 5
 July revoked Sukarno's life presi-
 dency but allowed him to remain in
 office until an elected congress,
 to be chosen in the next two years,
 takes further action.  Sukarno's
 title, "Great Leader of the Revolu-
 tion," was declared honorary and
 not a source of executive authority.
 A special committee will review
 presidential decrees to determine
 which are constitutional.  In a
 speech to the closing session of
 the MPRS on 6 July, Sukarno an-
 nounced that he accepted that body's
 decisions.
 The MPRS confirmed Suharto's
 e~~.rlier ban on the Indonesian Com-
 munist Party and outlawed the "propa-

 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 On 1 July the People's
 Daily described the recent polit-
 ical  upheaval in the past tense
 as a "counterrevolutionary coup"
 which had been thoroughly crushed.
 Subsequent pronouncements in Red
 Flag, another journal of the
 party central committee, indi-

 ~~olitburo members, an important
 military official (Yeh Chien-
 ~~ing), and Tao Chu, the powerful
 }arty boss of the Central-South
 I3ureau.  The failure of Mao and
 Defense Minister Lin Piao to
 :show up is not necessarily sig-
 nificant since neither appears
 ~_egularly in public.
 A People's Daily editorial
 on 1 July commemorating the 45th
 anniversary of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party, asserted that the
 plotters, who were not mentioned
 by name, had schemed their way
 into high positions in the party,
 army, and government.  Their ob-
 jective, the paper charged, was
 to carry out a Khrushchev-style
 coup and restore "capitalism."
 This coup attempt was said to
 be in the same class with un-
 successful plots by high offi-
 cials in 1953 and 1959 to usurp
 power.
 The editorial published
 brief quotes praising Mao's
 thinking by his four lieutenants
 --Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai, Lin
 Piao, and Teng Hsiao-ping--as if
 to demonstrate that the plot was
 put down by a leadership unified
 under Mao.  Another apparent at-
 tempt to show which leaders are
 in good standing was the turnout
 of high officials at the Peking
 airport to greet Chou En-lai on
 his return from abroad on 1 July.

 seemed a faithful reflection of
 Mao's awn thinking on intellec-
 tuals.
 The "cultural" purification
 drive which is sweeping China
 has not only led to the downfall
 of high officials, but is also
 producing an atmosphere of appre-
 hension and even terror at lower
 levels.  Red Flag revealed that
 hundreds of millions of people

 Tito's removal of his heir
 apparent, party secretary Ranko-
 vic, and the impending party re-
 organization and purge have
 created the first party crisis
 in Yugoslavia since the upheavals
 in the mid-1950s when Milovan
 Djilas challenged the regime's
 one-party system..  Rankovic had
 been a top leader and Tito's
 trusted friend since their par-
 tisan days in World War II.
 Tito plans a complete over-
 haul and purge of the party and
 has established a 40-member com-
 mission to work out the details.
 The commission's membership--
 more than one fourth of the cen-
 tral committee, including many
 top leaders--suggests that the
 expected transformations will
 be extensive and makes certain
 the adoption of its recommenda-
 tions, possibly at an extra-
 ordinary party congress later
 this year.
 Tito apparently became
 alarmed at some of the activi-
 ties and methods Rankovic was
 using to widen his power base
 in the regime, and possibly saw
 a threat to his own authority.
 `i'he 1 July plenum, which forced
 Rankovic's resignation as party
 secretary, was told that he had
 attempted to use his control of

 Rankovic
 may have attempted, unsuccess-
 fully, to extend his power and
 influence into the army, which
 has long supported Tito, a move
 the Yugoslav leader would have
 viewed with special alarm.
 In the accusations made
 against Rankovic there were ex-
 plicit attacks on his conserva-
 tism and opposition to the eco-
 nomic and political reforms in-
 stituted in the last few years.
 The object of these policies has
 been to remove the party from
 direct control of all aspects
 of political and economic life
 and to transform it into a guid-
 ing ideological force which
 would exercise influence in the
 formulation of policy by persua-
 sion, not command.  Rankovic
 probably saw in these policies
 a trend that would undermine
 party control of the country,
 and thus his own authority, after
 he succeeded Tito.
 Rivalries among the Yugo-
 slav nationality groups, partic-
 ularly between the Serbs and
 Croats, are likely to be exacer-
 bated by the action against Ran-
 kovic.  Rankovic's conservative
 outlook made him the champion
 of those elements in the Serbian
 and other republic parties who
 saw the reforms as a program
 which would injure the less-de-
 veloped regions of Yugoslavia to
 the benefit of Croatia and Slo-

 politically strongest in his

 form would mean loss of jobs,
 prestige, and influence.  Con-

 with satisfaction.
 The political demise of
 Ra~zkovic reopens the question of
 a ,successor to the 74-year-old
 Tito and enables some of Yugo-
 sl,~via's young liberals to emerge
 as potential candidates.  Al-
 th~~ugh the position of party
 se~~retary and President of the
 Fe~~eral Assembly Edvard Kardelj
 ha;~ been almost automatically
 enlZanced, he has displayed few

 Vl~~hovic, the other party secre-
 tary,does not appear to have yet
 established a power base from

 party secretary and presumably

 SOVIET LEASERS ALTEP TRAVEL. PLANS
 An unusual amount of current
 business in July, possibly including
 a high-level party gathering, has
 obliged at least two members of the
 Soviet leadership to curtail foreign
 travel.  There are indications that
 a party meeting may be convened in
 midmonth to prepare for a session of
 the Supreme Soviet scheduled for
 early August.
 On 24 June TASS announced that
 Premier Kosygin's state visit to
 Sweden, postponed once and resched-
 uled for 18 to 24 July, had been
 postponed indefinitely because of
 25X1"unexpected circumstances."
 the Supreme So-
 viet session called for 2 August was
 the reason far the postponement,
 since Kosygin would need time to pre-
 25X1 pare  for  the  session.
 A
 further hint that a  ig - eve  gath-
 ering may be in the offing was pro-
 vided by Soviet Ambassador to the
 US Dobrynin who said on 25 June that
 he would probably be leaving for
 Moscow on 10 July.  He is a member
 of the central committee.
 The 2 August Supreme Soviet
 session, in addition to attending
 to the pro forma business of re-form-
 ing a government in the wake of last
 month's elections, may consider
 some important measures requiring
 prior confirmation by the central
 committee.
 The Soviet leaders' docket for
 July, Kosygin's in particular, is
 crowded, with the Warsaw Pact meet-
 ing in Bucharest and a number of
 visits by foreign dignitaries
 scheduled toward the end of the
 month.  India's Prime Minister, Mrs.
 Gandhi, is slated to visit Moscow
 from 12 to 16 July.  UN Secretary
 General Thant will confer with So-
 viet leaders from 25 to 28 July and
 Iraq's Premier Bazzaz is to arrive
 on 27 July..
 DE GAULLE~S VISIT TO THE SOVIET UNION
 The most significant result of
 De Gaulle's 20 June - 1 July tour of
 the Soviet Union may be the encour-
 agement it gives other West Euro-
 pean states to open bilateral "dia-
 logues" with the USSR.  Both sides
 apparently see advantage in giving
 cautious impetus to detente in Eu-
 rope.  The joint declaration issued
 after the visit stresses the ''deci-
 sive contribution" toward detente
 made by France and the USSR and the
 need to draw others to their efforts.
 The forms of future French-So-
 viet contact are laid out in the
 joint declaration's call for mutual
 consultations on bilateral and

 international relations, the estab-
 lishment of a Paris-Moscow "hot
 line," and the creation of a joint
 commission to oversee fulfillment of
 the two economic and scientific tech-
 nical agreements signed during the
 visit.  The frequency and level of
 the "mutual consultations" were not
 specified, but they may include semi-
 annual meetings of the foreign min-
 isters such as took place last year.
 As expected, the declaration
 revealed considerable Soviet-French
 accord on disarmament, the UN, and
 Vietnam
 On
 the question of Germany and European
 security arrangements, the declara-
 tion merely noted that both sides
 "exchan ed their views."
 At the outset of their talks,
 Brezhnev made clear that Moscow's
 position on Germany was not negoti-
 able.  He stressed the well-worn
 doctrine that there are two German
 states, and indicated that any dis-
 cussions with the West on Germany
 would have to proceed from accept-
 ance  of  that fact.
 De Gaulle probably views the
 visit as a success, however, in plac-
 ing France in the forefront of those
 n~itions seeking a European settlement.
 DE:spite some ackowledgement that the
 LT;. has a role to play in that settle-
 mE~nt, De Gaulle probably believes
 treat he has taken a significant step
 toward the day when it can be pri-
 marily the work of the Europeans
 themselves.
 The Soviets displayed excep-
 tional public cordiality and defer-
 ence toward De Gaulle including an
 invitation--unprecedented for a
 WEBsterner--to view an ICBM and sat-
 ellite launching.  Reference in
 tree Soviet-French declaration to
 tree encouragement of "an atmosphere
 of detente" and a "normalization
 ar.,d then gradual development of re-
 lations between all European states"
 indicates Moscow's intent to con-
 tinue its present policy toward
 Europe.  The Soviets in recent
 months have been projecting an im-
 age of reasonableness and respon-
 siveness, holding out the prospect
 of fruitful relations with those
 who will follow the "realism" of
 French policy.
 Most other West European capi-
 tals have reacted to the trip more
 with relief than enthusiasm.  De
 Gaulle's firm position on Germany
 has pleased Bonn and eased the way
 for a cordial reception when he
 visits Germany later this month.
 The impression of De Gaulle working
 for a European detente without fi-
 nally breaking with the West appears
 temporarily to have muted criticism
 from other European capitals.

 NATO DEVELOPMENTS
 Despite hints from French
 officials of limited future co-
 operation, the basic uncertainty
 regarding France's military posi-
 tion in the Alliance remains.
 While the French response is
 thus mild in tone, it seems to
 involve neither a retreat from
 previous positions nor any com-

 PRO-NAS I R COUP ATTEMPT FAILS I ~ l RAQ
 Iraqi President Arif's re-
 gime appears to have been strength
 ened as a result of crushing last
 week's coup attempt by pro-Nasir
 elements. The regime put down the
 uprising within a few hours after
 it began on 30 June.  The dissi-
 dents were led by former premier
 Razzaq, who was also responsible
 for a similar effort that mis-
 carried in September 1965.
 The uprising began in mid-
 afternoon with an air attack
 against the Presidential Palace
 in Baghdad.  The attacking MIG-
 17 jet fighters came from Mosul,
 in northern Iraq, where the com-
 mander of the 4th Infantry Divi-
 sion had joined the conspiracy
 and taken control of the airport.
 Uther rebel units seized a Bagh-
 dad radio station and began is-
 suing proclamations from the
 "Council of the Revolutionary Com-
 mand" over Razzaq's signature.
 The regime, however, was aware
 that a coup was in the making,
 and the Republican Guard, together
 with other loyal military units,
 moved quickly to defend the palace
 and restore order.  Razzaq and
 most of the other prominent par-
 ticipants in the abortive effort
 have been arrested.
 The Egyptians' failure to
 give Razzaq any material assist-
 ance probably will make possible
 the maintenance of a facade of
 normal relations between Baghdad
 and Cairo, as was the case fol-
 lowing Razzaq's failure last fall.
 Premier Bazzaz has already pub-
 licly described the coup attempt
 as "a domestic incident" for which
 the government does not "accuse
 anyone outside Iraq."  Nasir,
 nevertheless, may now have more
 difficulty in getting the Iraqi
 Government to cooperate in his
 proposed alignment of "progressive"
 Arab states.
 Arif's success in suppressing
 the pro-Nasir uprising may help
 to ease relations with Iran.  The

 SOVIET MILITARY AID TO IRAQ
 The USSR and Iraq are work-
 ing out delivery schedules for
 over $100 million worth of mili-
 tary equipment ordered under the
 fifth Soviet-Iraq arms agreement
 signed on 5 May.  The abortive
 coup attempt of 30 June in Bagh-
 dad has had no effect on Soviet-
 Iragi relations.
 Iraq's minister of defense
 was reported to have arrived in
 Moscow on 28 June to sign de-
 livery contracts.  The first de-
 liveries under this agreement
 probably will take place next
 spring.  Soviet instructors and
 technicians are scheduled to ar-
 rive in Iraq in the last quarter
 of 1966 in order that basic in-

 can be completed before delivery.

 TERRORIST ACTIVITY COf~TIN~IES Its SOUTH ARABIA
 The recent rise in Egyptian-
 directed terrorist activity in
 South Arabia suggests that Nasir
 still hopes to foster the illu-
 sion that the British are being
 driven out and at the same time
 to prevent the orderly transfer
 of power to any but a pro-Nasir
 government.
 London's declaration in
 February that it would evacuate
 its Aden base and grant independ-
 ence  to  the British-created
 South Arabian Federation (SAF)
 in 1968 would appear to have
 deprived the Cairo-backed nation-
 alists of their principal cause
 for terrorism.  Two extreme sub-
 groups of the Egyptian-backed
 Front for the Liberation of Occu-
 pied South Yemen (FLOSY)--the
 Arab Nationalist Movement and the
 leftist National Liberation
 Front--are close to a break with
 FLOSY over this issue.  Neverthe-
 less, in June there were 86
 incidents, and comprehensive
 stocks of terrorist weapons and
 equipment have been uncovered.
 Plans by FLO5Y to set up a
 South Arabian government-in-exile
 in Yemer. have yet to materialize,
 and proposed executive elections
 have been postponed.  Neither of
 the two natural candidates for
 leadership commands both local
 and Egyptian support.  One is
 Aden's former premier Makkawi,
 whose interests South Arabians
 suspect center too exclusively
 on Aden.  The other, Adeni labor
 leader Abdulla Asnag, has coun-
 seled legal political methods,
 objects strongly to continued
 violence, and is beginning to
 suspect that FLOSY is supported
 by Cairo only so long as it
 serves Nasir's purposes.
 Both men ere aware that
 ~ FLOSY is losing ground to the
 Saudi-backed South Arabian League
 ~ (SAL} and the SAF.  They have
 ~ recently toured Arab countries,
 coming up with a statement of
 support for FLOSY from Algeria.
 They assert that the British
 should be discussing the future
 of South Arabia only with FLOSY.
 They have also sought to embel-
 lish their appeal in South Arabia
 by claiming that political and
 economic support from Russia,
 China, and various Arab states
 has been promised to FLOSY if
 it gains control of an independ-
 ent  South  Arabia.  FLOSY has
 had to continue its propaganda
 war against the SAL, which claims
 to have attracted more adherents
 from among South Arabian dissi-
 dents.
 The .SAF government has tried
 ~o appear independent enough to
 attract the support of the mod-
 erate nationalists but still
 retain the support of the British.

 and received assurances of con-

 barred from any UN commission.

 CONGA (BRAZ'AVILLE) GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATING WITH DISSIDENTS
 The confrontation between
 the radical Congo (Brazzaville)
 Government and dissident elements
 of the 1,700-man army has been
 temporarily checked by the return
 of President Massamba-Debat from
 abroad.
 With the President`s popu-
 lar appeal and self-confidence on
 its side, the dominant political
 leadership seems to have retained
 the upper hand, and negotiations
 with the dissidents appear to be
 under way. In the long run, how-
 ever, Massamba-Debat and his gov-
 ernment will be hard pressed to
 contain the ideological, tribal,
 and personal quarrels which were
 so glaringly exposed during the
 disturbances.
 Massamba-Debat criticized
 government and party leaders for
 their handling of the military
 mutiny in a two-hour speech de-
 livered on his return on 3 July.
 He said the leadership should
 have curbed rumormongering rather
 than contributing to it by its
 fears and failure to take deci-
 sive action.  The President
 blamed the mutiny on a few indi-
 viduals who he claimed were in-
 fluenced by tribalism or a coun-
 terrevolutionary spirit.  He gave
 no indication of how he would
 quiet army unrest, noting only
 that he would undertake a "ser-
 ious analysis" of the problem.
 The government appears to
 have rejected most of the dissi-
 dents' demands.  It has refused
 to dismiss the 200 or so Cuban
 soldiers who guarded government
 and party leaders last week and
 has launched a campaign to praise
 the broad scope of Cuban aid to
 Congo (Brazzaville).  Leaders of
 the regime are said to believe
 that without the Cubans, the gov-
 ernment would have fallen.  A re-
 cent government broadcast claimed
 that Cuba will continue to provide
 not only instructors for paramili-
 tary units but also extensive tech-
 nical and educational assistance in
 agriculture and medicine.
 Despite opposition from con-
 servative elements in the army, the
 regime is going ahead with plans to
 "democratize' the army as called
 for by the ruling party's central
 committee last spring.  It does not
 intend to disarm paramilitary units
 which are under party control, as
 the dissidents have requested.
 However, the regime has given some
 ground by appointing a new provi-
 sional army command made up of po-
 litically reliable junior officers.
 The present whereabouts of the un-
 popular former army chief of staff,
 Mountsaka, who was arrested by
 mutinous soldiers, is unknown.
 Although Deputy Army Chief
 of Staff Kimboula claims that most
 of the army supports the govern-
 ment, a major question is whether
 the regime actually has the power
 to flout the dissidents' demands.
 At last report, the paracommandos
 were reportedly still holding out.

 ARGENTINE MILITARY GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING PRE-COUP PLANNING
 Argentina's new military

 Juan Carlos Ongania, appears to
 be following plans established
 prior to the 27 June coup.
 Ongania has appointed a
 cabinet of civilian technicians

 appointees to the cabinet of
 junior secretary positions have
 university backgrounds and are
 without ties to political groups.

 NEW D~JMI N I CAN PRES l DENT l NAUGURATED

 Balaguer set the tone for his
 administration in a somber, de-
 termined
 inaugural address on 1
 July.

 The new President stressed
 that his government would estab-
 lish the rule of law for both it-
 self and the governed.  He made
 it ~~lear that he does not intend
 to allow a dissident minor~~  to
 disrupt the peace and order he
 claimed three fourths of the Do-
 minican people desire.
 Ile outlined an austerity
 program of at least six months
 duration which will begin with
 salary cuts for an estimated nine
 percent of the government's work
 force, including himself,  Bala-
 guer affirmed his intention to
 enforce the law prohibiting pub-
 lic employees from striking by
 automatically firing all those
 joining  walt_;,uts.   'the  President
 warned that he intends to put a
 stop to corruption, privileges,
 and unearned pensions, which he
 claimed were making the country
 a "nation of invalids."  He prom-
 ised that the state-owned enter-
 prises, especially the debt-rid-
 den Dominican Sugar corporation,
 would be purged of politics. By
 a decree of 2 July, Balaguer him-
 self assumed direct control of
 the sprawling sugar complex to
 "eradicate political interfer-
 ence."
 An all-inclusive agrarian
 reform program was listed by
 Balaguer as the most important
 social reform he plans to ini-
 tiate.
 The newly appointed 13-
 man cabinet is dominated by nine
 members who owe their political
 allegiance to Balaguer.   The
 other three civilian ministers
 are leading members of the op-
 position Dominican Revolution-
 ary Party.  The only holdover
 ~:rom the provisional government
 is Defense Minister Enrique
 Perez y Perez.   Although not
 particularly popular among his
 fellow officers, Perez y Perez
 has done a creditable job and
 his retention appears to indi-
 cate that Balaguer plans no im-
 mediate sweeping changes in the
 armed forces.
 On the international
 scene Balaguer quickly ruled out
 any recognition of Castro's
 Cuba but has already taken steps
 to normalize relations with the
 Duvalier regime in neighboring
 Haiti.   The Dominican Republic
 will,  according to Balaguer,
 seek closer economic ties with
 Puerto Rico,  whose economy he
 termed complementary.   He also
 forecast efforts to establish
 '"commercial  relations"  with  "so-
 cialist" countries.

 GUATEMALAN PRES l DENT PLEDGE`. GOVERNMENT OF UN[TY
 Guatemalan President Mendez
 in a reasoned and powerful in-
 augural speech on 1 July pledged
 responsive and responsible gov-
 ernment "representing unity of
 the nation."  He expressed the
 belief that the armed forces would
 be-loyal to the constitution they
 had created, reminding them that
 the law makes him commander in
 chief.  He singled out economic
 issues and internal security as
 being especially grave among the
 many problems facing the country.
 Mendez invited guerrillas
 and terrorists to make peace but
 warned them not to misinterpret
 his remarks as weakness.  This,
 he said, would cause his ex-
 tended hand to "become a strong
 fist" to defend the interests of
 the entire community.
 Mendez' first decree was
 to lift the state of siege which
 had been in effect since early
 May.  It is too early to tell
 what, if any, effect this decree
 will have on the guerrilla-ter-
 rorist situation.  However, Luis
 Turcios Lima, the chief of the
 Communist Party's action arm,
 stated some weeks ago that his
 people would continue the battle
 until the government was toppled.
 SURFACE CALM RETURNS TO BRITISH HONDURAS
 With surface calm returned
 at least temporarily to British
 Honduras, Governor Stallard on
 4 July lifted the curfew imposed
 during last week's rioting.  Dur-
 ing the curfew period over 60 ar-
 rests were made.  Public servants
 mounted a sit-down strike on 1
 July; participation was 50 per-
 cent or better in Belize City.
 Most essential services were con-
 tinued during the strike, however
 The recent demonstrations
 stemmed from public concern that
 mediation of problems connected
 with independence for British
 Honduras might open the country
 to excessive influence from
 neighboring Guatemala, which has
 long claimed the area.  Stallard,
 in a radiobroadcast on 1 July,
 tried to allay this fear.  He
 stated that the US mediator had
 not yet terminated his investiga-
 tion and that only suggestions had
 been offered thus far in the UK-
 Guatemalan discussions.  The gov-
 ernor assured the people that they
 would have full opportunity to dis-
 cuss the final proposals once they
 were made, adding that the UK would
 not impose a solution against the
 desires of the people.
 Past statements by UK offi-
 ci~~ls have not reassured the pop-
 ul;~ce and further pronouncements,
 perhaps even by the US mediator,   25X1
 many be necessary to prevent
 an~~ther outbreak in Belize City.

 VELASCO FALTERING I N ECUADOR
 Former L'cuadorean president
 Velasco Ibarra's arrival in Quito
 on 2 July failed to live up to
 advance billing.  A maximum of

 BOLIVIA ELECTS A NEU11 GOVERNMENT
 With 75 percent of the vote
 counted from last Sunday's na-
 tional elections, Rene Barrientos
 and his Bolivian Revolutionary
 Front (FRB) have a commanding-lead
 over all other parties.  According
 to official returns, Barrientos
 and the FRB have won 61 percent of
 the total vote, virtually assuring
 Barrientos of the presidency, and
 the FRB has a majority of seats in
 both houses of congress.
 The Christian Democratic Com-
 munity, a front for the rightist
 Bolivian Socialist Falange, and
 Victor Andrade's faction of the
 Nationalist Revolutionary Move-
 ment are running second and third
 respectively in a close tally.
 The Barrientos regime, sched-
 uled to be inaugurated on 6 Aug-
 ust, will face a variety of new
 and inherited problems.  The FRB
 is not a cohesive, disciplined po-
 litical force and may disintegrate
 in the near future.  Thus the new
 president will have to rebuild his
 political base, possibly moving
 closer to the right because of
 military pressure.  Barrientos will
 also be faced with several chronic
 economic problems, including a bud-
 get deficit.  The unfamiliarity of
 thE~ new leaders with these prob-
 lerns may cause considerable delay
 in developing an economic program.
 The major problem for Barri-
 entos is to restrain the armed
 fox:ces from trying to regain active
 corxtrol of the government.  As in
 thE~ past, junta chief General Al-
 fredo Ovando is the key to future
 government-military relations.
 Ov~~ndo reportedly told foreign
 cox:respondents  on Monday  that  '?the
 arrled forces will observe the new
 go~rernment and will act again if
 thE~y think that the interests of
 thE: people are not well served."
 Ov~indo did not set a limit on how
 long the military would give Bar-
 rientos to prove himself.
 Before the elections Ovando,
 in a candid conversation with the
 US ambassador, said that he was
 pe:~simistic about Barrientos' suc-
 ce:~s in governing the country.  He
 al:~o made it clear that he would
 as:~ume power if the Barrientos gov-
 ernment brake down.  Thus, if an
 is:~ue develops between the two
 men, there could be trouble..
