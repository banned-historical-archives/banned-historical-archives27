	   	.			    	report   	(gi~t).
					 	"If  the  report  is  right,  China  will  actually  approve  U.S.  military  facili-
					 	ties.    	This  report  is  worth  drawing  our  attention.    	These  telecommunication
					 	facilities--will  naturally  have  military  featurea.    	The  fact  that  China  is
						about  to  appr.ove  the  conatruction  of  these  facilities  suggests  that  the
						relationship  tetween  China  and  the  U.S.   	is  also  closely  linked  with  quasi-
						~nilitary  affairs.
						"Deng's  r~,::arks  are  also  worth  drawing  our  attention  in  the  sense  that
						Vice  Premier  ~eng  refrained  from  making  fundamental  critici~,m  of  actual
						continuation  of   	:he  U.S.  policy,   	"one  China  and  one  Taiwan,"  but  that  Deng
						made  reserved  remarks  ~a  tf~e  conventional  continuation  of  U.S.-Taiwan  mili-
						tary  relations,   	the  conventional  continuation  which  is  reflected  in  a  new
						U.S.   	Taiwan  act.    	Deng'3  remarks  also  provide  evidence  that  China  has  an
						unprincipled  raprrochement  with  the  U.S."

					Tokyo  JPS  in  English  0930  GMT  16  Apr  79  OW
					[TexC]    	Tokyo,   	16  Apr   	(JPS)--AKAHATA  carried  an  editorial  on  April  16,   	en-
					tiCled  "The  Great  Significance  of  Agreement  Between  the  Japanese  Communist
					Party  and   	Che  Comm+~nist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union."
					The  editorial  said  that  in  Che  agreement  reached  in  the  preliminary  Calks  be-
					tween  the  .TCp  and  Clie CPSU  held  in  Moscow  on  April  11-12,  and  made  public  on		    	-
			     	April  15,   	the  Soviet  side  states  that  "all  maneuvers  done  in  th~  name  of  the
			     	communist  movement,  by  ex-JCP  members  or  by  groups  of  various  sorts,  are
			     	manifestations  nf  anti-party  activities,  whatever  flag  they  may  carry  or
			     	whatever  excuse  they  may  create,  and  that  the  Soviet  side  will  not  have  ~ny
			     	relation  at  all  with  activities  of  those  groups."									 	_
			     	"Needless  to  say,   	the  Shiga  clique  3s  included  in  the   	'ex-JCP  members  or
			     	groups  of  various  sorts'  mentioned  in  the  agreement.    	This  agreement  goes
			     	further  to  say  that   	'the  Japaneae  side  especially  gave  an  affirn~ative  esti-
			     	mation  Co  the  constructive  position  expressed  by  the  representatives  of  Che
			     	Communist  Party  c~f  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  Tokyo  preliminary  talks  on  the
			     	problem  of  the  past  relat!.onship  between  the  two  parties.'    	As  was  made  clear
			     	in  the  Nishizawa   	(JCP  vice-iresidium  chairman--ed)   	statement  in  March,   	the
			     	JCP   	'estimated'   	the  Soviet  statement  in  the  preliminary  talks  that  the  SovieC
			     	side   	'will  not  ~ustify  the  pnst  publication  of  articles  in  PRAVDA  supporting
			     	the  Shiga  clique,  and  that  was  not  corre_t...."    	This  evenCually  carried  a
			     	realistic  meaning  [as  received]  at  the  conclusion  of  these  preliminary  talks.
			     	"Viewing  this  point  reflect  in  the  agreement,   	it  is  plainly  indicated  that
			     	the  position  of  the  Shiga  cliquA,  who  subverted  democratic  centralism--the
			     	organizational  principle  of  the  Communist  Party--was  naturally  expelled  from
			     	the  JCP  for  violation  of  the  party  constitution,  and  has  been  spending  their
			     	days  in  raising  troubles  in  the  revolutionary  movement  in  Japan,  by  making
			     	obeisance  to  foreign  forcea  their  duty,  do  not  get  any  support  in  Japan,
			     	and  internationAlly  as  well.    	[Graf  as  rea~ived)
			     	"This  is  entirely  pertinent,   	looking  at  it  from  the  standpoint  that  the  rela-

				    	[Editorial:    	"Carter's  ~nergy  Policy")
				    	~Text]    	President  Carter  has  announced  a  new  energy  policy  in  which  the
				   	price  ceilings  on  U.S.-produced  crude  oil  will  be  gradually  lifted  from
				   	June  1  to  allow  them  to  approach  international  levels  by  the  end  of  Sep-
				   	tember  1981,  and  about  half  of  the  windfall  profits  to  be  gained  by  the  oil
				   	companies  will  be  sopped  up  by  a  tax.
				   	This  new  policy,  which  over  the  long  run  will  curb  domestic  demand  in  the
				   	U.S.  and  help  reduce  crude  oi~  imports,   	is  to  be  welcomed  by  Japan.
				   	Many  energy  experts  have  ar~ued  that  only  $  return  to  a  fiee  market  would
				   	prove  effective  in  curbing  demand  2nd  increasing  the  supply  of  domestically
				   	produced  oil.    	The  new  policy  effectively  acknowledges  this.						  	~
	    	.		     	Carter  failed  in  an  attempt  to  impose  a  tax  on  domestically  produced  oil			  	1
				   	last  October  because  of  strong  opposition  from  congress  and  the  oil  industry.
				   	Stimulating  New  Production														     	(
				   	In  his  new  energy  blueprint,   	Carter  proposes  to  take  only  half  of  the  in-			 	~
				  	creased  revenues  in  tax,   	though  it  is  the  business  of  congre~s  to  determine
				   	tsx  ratios.
				  	Carter  apparently  aims  at  stimulating  the  oil    	fndustry  to  explore  for  new
				  	oil  resources  and  to  increase  oil  production.
				  	His  previous  surcharge  on  domestically  produced  oil  was  criticized  as  be;ng
				  	aimed  at  only  curbing  demand,  doing  nothing  fcr  expanding  supply.
	    	-		    	In  the  case  of  natural  gas,  whose  pri.ce  was  lifted  by  last  October's  energy
				  	act,   	supply  is  now  abundant,   	indicating  that  the  same  may  be  the  case  for
				  	oil.																				   	`

				    	(Editorial:    	"Carter  on  ~nergy  Crisis"]
				    	[TextJ    	"The  energy  crisis  is  real.    	Time  is  running  short."
				    	This  statement  of  President  Carter  most  eloquently  epitomizes  the  essence
				    	of  his  new  energy  policy  calling  on  Americans  to  produce  more  oi1  and  con-
				    	serve  more.
				    	In  his  somber,   	2,400-word-address,  President  Carter  unveiled  on  April  5  the
				    	second  ma3or  energy  plan  of  his  administration  in  the  "stern  manner  of  a
				   	Dutch  uncle  delivering  a  tought  lecture"  as  a  foreign  dispatch  commented.
				   	Carter's  decision  should  be  considered  a  timely  warning  not  only  to  his
				   	countrymen  but  also  to  Japan  in  view  of  the  fact  that  oil  consumption  is			  	-
				   	steadily  on  the  increase  while  oil  producing  countries  are  all  lined  up  to
				   	raise  their  oil  prices.
				   	In  his  new  plan,   	Carter  announced  that  he  is  decontrolling  oil  prices  as
				   	from  June  1,   	so  that  domestic  prices  will  rise  to  world  levels  by  the  autumn
				   	of  1981.    	The  world  price  now  is  $14.64,   	compared  to  the  average  U.S.  price
				   	of  $9.60.
				   	The  United  States  legislated  the  oil  price  control  in  1973  for  the  purpose
				   	of  restraining  inflation  and  conserving  domestic  oil  resources,   	bu t�.the
				   	development  of  the  situation  in  the  meantime  proved  that  the  control  has
				   	failed   	to  serve  the  original  purposes.    	Cheap  domestic  oil  has  only  helped
				   	Americans  to  consume  more  while  the  oil  development  at  home  came  to  a  stand-
				   	still,   	resulting  in  increased  imports  of  oil  from  abroad.    	Last  yea*_-  alone,
				   	the  United  States  imported  $40  billion  worth  of  oil,  aggravating  Yts  inter-
				   	national  balance  of  payments  position  and  accelerating  inflationary  trends.

					 	Pr~sident  CArter  proposed  in  April  1977  ~  drastic  "national  energy  plan"  but
	    	.			    	the  related  energy  bi11s  were  completiely  watered  down  3n  the  course  of  a  year
					 	and  a  half  long  delibertttion  3n  Congress  and  chances  for  reatraining  Che  im-
					 	port  of  oil  were   	then  lost.
					 	Carter  at  Che   	Cime  wanted  ta  promotie  development  of  oil  resources  aC  home  and
					 	restra3n  consumption  by  raising  the  prices  of  domesticaYly  produced  oil.    	His
					 	idea  of  raising  prices  by  an  equallzation  tax  while  ma~ntaining  price
					 	control  to  some  exCent  was  a  total  failure  in  face  of  the  strong  oppoaition
					 	raiaed  by  the  producers  who  called  for  complete  decontrol  and  consumers
					 	who  were  up  ugainst  the  price  hike,    	Carter  was  attacked  from  both  sides.
					 	Carter  invoked  preaidential  authority  in  13fting  the  oil  prices   	this  time
					 	and  it  does  not  require  the  consent  of   	the  Con~ress.    	The  prices  of  domesti-
					 	ca11y  produced  oi1  will  eventually  go  up  and  Che oil  industry  will  step  up
					 	its  efforts  to  develop  new  oil  fields  at  home.    	As  hoped  by  Che  U.S.  Govern-
	  	=			    	ment,   	the  decontrol  may  result  in  a  decrease  of  oil  imports,  thus  fulfilling
					 	purt  of  the  U.S.  pledge  made  at  the  Bonn  SummiC  last  year.						 	-
					 	There  is  no  denying  the  fact  also  that   	the  current  measure  enta3ls  many  rislcs.
					 	To  begin  with,   	we  must  point  out  uhepossibility  of  worsening  inflation.    	'"he
					 	U.S.  Government  estimates  that  gasoline  wi11  go  up  about  7  cents  per  gallon
					 	and  Chat  inflation  w~11  rise  by  about  0.1  percent  this  year,  and  0.2  or  0.3
					 	percent  in  the  fo~.lowing  years  as  a  result  of  the  decontrol.    	The  same  sources
					 	do  not  seem  to  be  taking  a  serious  view  of  ttie  inflation  elements.
					 	However,   	it  must  be  noted  that.one outstanding  feature  of  the  American  economy
					 	is  that  everything  goes  up  when  the  gasoline  grice  is  raised.    	Hence  the  of-
					 	ficial  view  of   	the  U.S.  Government  is  highly  political.
						Another  problem  fs  what  to  do  with  the  "huge  a.nd  ur.deserved  windfall  profits"
					 	the  oil  companies  will  reap  from  decontrol.    	CarCer  proposed  a  50  percent
						windfall  profits  tax  as  a  companion  piece  to  decontrol,   	so   	that  oil  companies
						will  not  reap  a  bonanza  of  more  than  $10  billion  in  higher  prices  by  the  end
						of  1982,  as  well  as  an  energy  security  fund  to  aid  low  income  families  who
						wold  be  hardest  hit  by  higher  prices  under  decontrol.    	The  fund,   	he  said,
						will  be  financed  by  the  windfall  profits  tax.    	He  also  said  such  a  tax  bill
						wi11  be  used  to  develop  alternative  energy  resources.
						In  the  United  State~,   	about  55  percent   	of  the  total  oil  consumption  is  for
					 	the  people's  livelihood.    	With  the  presidential  election  scheduled  for  next
						year,  we  can  read  the  strong  determination  of  Carter  in  announcing  the  current
						step  which  is  c ertain  to  hit  the  people's  household  economy.			_

				  	The  main  pillars  of  Che  new  policy  are  the  following:    	(1)  pricc  controls				~
				  	nn  U.S.-produced  petroleum  will  be  nbolished  in  stages  3n   	two  years  and   	four
				  	mc~nthy  ACr~rtin~;  from  tht~  ,1ime;    	(2)   	50  rercent  of  the  profita  oF  oil  com-
				  	pnniea  rea~ilting   	Crom  the  price  increase  will  be  ~bsorbed  by  a  windfall
				  	proftts  tax  and  diverted   	to  an  "energy  stabilization  fund,"  and   	(3)   	~he
				  	fund  will  be  used  to  aid  low-income  families   	(average  $100  a  year  per  house-
				  	hold),   	for  the  construction  of  an  efficient  mass   	transportation  system  and
				  	the  development  of  technology  for  a  lon~-range  solution  to  Che  energy  prob~
				  	lem.
				  	President  Carter  has  also  devised  various  measures  to  economi~e  on  the  con-
				  	sumption  of.  petroleum.    	He  wants  states  to  set  up  programs  to  curb  gasoline
				  	consumption.    	He  warns  that  ~illing  sCations  could  be  ord~ered  to  close  on
				  	weekends  in  staCes  rhat  do  not  achieve  certain  goals.    	In  connection  with
				  	the  nuclear  power  generation  plant  accident  on  Three  Mile  Island,  Penna.,			  	~
				  	he  has  ordered  the  establishme~nt  ~f  a  presidential  coimnittee  to  determine
				  	the  ca~3aes  of  the  accident  and  recommend  safety  measures.							  	~
				  	The  five  natioiial  energy~  bills  which  President  Carter  presented   	to  the  U.S.
				  	Congress  in  1977  underwent  rough  sailing  for  a  year  and  a  half.    	They  were
				  	finally  approved  by  Congress  last  October  but  without  the  crucial  bills
	    	-		    	forming  the  core  of  the  policy,   	such  as   	those  on  the  crude  oil  equalization
				  	tax,   	the  petroleum  and  gas  utilization  tax  and  the  emergency  gasoline  con-
				 	sumption  tax.    	The  outstanding  feature  of  the  latest  policy  is  that  it  has
				 	made  use  of  that  bitter  lesson  and  has  been  given  a  realistic  facelift.
				 	Ever  since  the  so-called  oil  shock,   	the  U.S.  had  made  frantic  ineffective
				 	policy  efforts  to  step  up  its  supply  of  domestic  energy  soui~es,   	economize
				 	on  consumption  and  reduce  imports  of  crude  oil.    	Among  these  endeavors  were
				 	the  "energy  self-supporting  plan"  of  the  Nixon  administration  and  the				  	~
				 	"energy  policy  and  conservation  law"  of  the  Ford  government.    	The  resul*s
				 	of   	these  measures  have  been  almost  invisible,  and  the  country's  reliance  on
				 	imported  petroleum  continues  to  grow.    	As  pledged  at  the  Bonn  summit,  Ameri-
				 	cz's  oil  imports  last  year,   	in  terms  of  the  annual  total  volume,   	decreased			 	-
				 	a  ljttle.    	However,   	the~-   	rose  sharply  again  from  around  November,  and  accord-
				 	ing   	to  President  Carter  in  his  address,   	the  country  will  import  $50  billion
				 	worth  of  petroleum  this  year.
				 	The  U.S.   	is  the  world's  foremost  energy-consuming  and  top  petroleum-import-
				 	ing  nation.    	Whether  Amer~cans  can  conseYve  petroleum  and  curb  imports  will
				 	greatly  affect  the  international  energy  and  currency  situation.    	But  if
				 	oil  imports  continue  to  expand  thp  economic  situation  of  the  whole  world  is
				 	liable  to  be  exposed  to  uneasiness  forever.    	In  this  context,   	success  or
				 	fai~ure  of  the  U.S.   	energy  policy  is  a  matter  of  great  concern  to  us.
					A  fact   	that  is  particularly  important  is  that  in  America,   	domestic  petroleum
					production  and  natural  gas  output  hit  the  ceiling  respect~vely  in  1970  and
					1972.    	If  the  consumption  of  energy  rises  four  percent  a  year  as  a  result,
				 	the  burden  wi11  fall  almost  in  its  entirely  on  petroleum  imports,  making  it
					inevitable  for  imports  to  increase  by  24  Percent.    	The  big  task  is  how  to
					promote  the  development  and  increased  production  of  domestic  energy  sources.

				    	(Text)    	Tokyo,   	5  Apr   	(JPS)--Hnrishi  Tachiki,  acting  chairman  of  the  inter-
				   	nationnl  relaCions  and  foreign  policy  commiasion  of  th~  Japanese  Co~nunlst
				   	P~rty,   	iesued  a  statement  on  April  3,  on  China's  decision  nnd  notificntion
				   	to  the  Soviet  Union  of  the  abrogatiun  of  th~  Sino-5oviet  treaty  for  friend-
				   	ship,   	nlliance  and  mutual  aid  on  the  same  day.    	The  stntement  said:
				   	1.    	Although  the  Sino-Sovietfriendahip  alliance  treaty  has  been  a  treaty  in
				   	name  only,   	the  abrogation  of  it  is     	clearly  motivated  by  China'g  strategy
				   	against  the  Soviet  Union,  not  merely  a  matCer  of  form.    	It  is  a  paradox  in
				   	history  that  China  now  recognizes  the  Japan-U.S.  militnry  alliance,   	and  is
				   	taking  steps  toward  a  relationsh~o  which  hae  been  obaerved  to  be  a  quasi-
				   	military  alliance  between  the  United  States,  Japan  and  China.
				   	2.    	Needless  to  reiterate,  China's  attitude  t~  approve  the  imperialist  mili-
				   	[ary  alliance  hostile  to  socialism  and  national  liberation  movements  is  con-
				   	nected  with  its  deviation  from  the  socialist  cause,  which  constitute  the
				   	same  root  as  the  one  of  its  aggression  against  Vietnam.

				  	[Editorial:    	"Honoring  War  Criminals'
				  	[TexCJ    	It  wae  disclosed  Thureday  that  14  men  who  were  tried  as  clasa-A
				 	war  criminala  by  the  Far  East  Military  Tribunal  after  the  Pacific  war,   	in-
				 	cluding  wartime  Prime  Miniater  General  Hideki  To3o,  have  been  enahrined  in
				  	the  Yasukuni  ehrine  in  Tokyo,  which  ie  dedicated  to  the  war  dead.
				 	Considering  Chat  war  ia  the  greatest  crime  of  mankind,  thie  i~  !-tghly  re-
				 	grettable.
				 	Religious institutiona~do,   	or  course,   	have  the  freedom  to  enshrine  any  deity
				 	or  deceased  person  they  choose,  but  still  we  should  ask  ourselves  whether
				 	the  Yasukuni  ahrine  should  have  enahrined  these  14  men.
	  	-		     	It  hae  not  been  proved  beyond  a  ahadow  of  a  doubt  that  they  did  commit  war
				 	crimes~  but  they  are  generally  believed  to  have  been  the  men  most  responsible
				 	for  the  war.
				 	'Martyra  of  Showa'
				 	The  Yasukuni  ehrin~  choae  to  enshrine  the  14  men  as  "Martyrs  of  Showa  (the
				 	reign   	of  the  current  emperor),"  along  with  the  men  who  fought  and  died  in
				 	the  war,  without  asking  the  relativea  of  either  the  14  men  or  the  other
				 	war  dead  what  they  thought  about  it.												  	~
				 	We  suspect  the  shrine  staff  were  not  sure  that  the  bereaved  families  of  the
	  	-		     	14  men  and  the  war  dead  would  agree.
				 	Thia  event  is  related  to  the  moves  to  place  the  ahrine  under  the  protection
				 	of  the  government  again,   	the  Shinto  religion  having  played  a  special  role  in
				 	prewar  days  as  a  sort  of  etate  religion.
				 	The  principle  of  separation  of  politics  and  religion  should  be  guarded  vigi-
				 	lantly~  however,  and  for  this  reason  we  have  repeatedly  opposed  any  more
				 	to  put  the  ehrine  under  the  protection  or  support  of  the  government.

					   	Japan  and  the  United  States  as  we11  as  between  Japan  and  Europe.
					   	The  etructural  chengea  in  the  world  economy  were  cauaed  by  the  relative

					  	The  world  economy  increased  in  interdependency,   	in  line  wiCh  the  progress

					  	rather  than  on  reduction  of  tariffs.
					  	Since  the  agreement  called  for  reduction  of  nontariff  barriers,   	Che  coun-
					  	tries  concerned  will  be  obliged  to  probe  their  own  domestic  industrial  sys-

					  	of  how  to  avoid  a  frontal  clash  with  na tional  interest.    	The  terms  of  the
					  	Tokyo  Round  could  be  used  to  ~ustify  trade  protectionism,   	depending  upon  the
					  	circumstances  of  actual  implementation.

				  	Tokyo  THE  DAILY  YOMIURI  in  English  13  Apr  79  p  2  O~a
				  	[Editorial:    	"Toward  Free  Trade"]
				  	[Text]    	At  last,  a  pat~ge  agreement  completing  the Tokyo  Round  of  multina-
				  	tional  trade  talka  was  initialed  in  Geneva  Thursday,  ab~ut  aix  years  after
				  	the  talka  began,   	ao  the  rules  governing  world  tirade  in  the  1980s  have  nowi
				 	been  set.
				 	This  does  not  mean,   	however,   	that  all  problems  have  been  solved,  and  a  con-
				  	stant  battle  against  protectionism  is  to  be  expected.
				 	The  Tokyo  Round,   	aimed  at  raising  living  standards  and  welfare  throughout
				  	the  world,  atarted  in  September  1973.
				 	This  oil  crisis  soon  after  cauF:.d  stagnation  in  many  countries  and  suspension
				 	of  the  talks  until  progress  began  again  in  January  last  year.
				 	A  further  deadlock  occurred,  however,  because  of  the  negative  attitude  of
				 	the  European  Communities  (EC),  and  the  agreement  still  falls  short  of  what
				 	was  originally  aimed  at.
				 	Reduced  Nontariff  Barriers
				 	The  agreement  to  reduce  tariffs  by  slightly  less  than  30  per~ent  is  being
				 	hailed  as  the  main  feature  of  the  package,  but  this  is  not  �really  so  import-
				 	ant  considering  that  the  market  pricws  of  goods  fluctuate  greatly  under  the
				 	floating  exchang~  r~te  system.
				 	The  really  important  part  of  the  agreement  is  that  calling  for  a  reduction
				 	of  nontariff  barriers,   	for  it  is  this  that  will  make  world  trade  free.
				 	Even  this  section  doea  ~.mt  go  far  enough,   	especially  with  the  trend  toward
				 	protectionism  against  the  so-called  more  developed  of  the  developing  ~oun-
				 	tries,  which  can  be  expected  to  go  all  out  to  break  their  way  into  world
				 	markets  during  the  1980s.

				     	(TextJ    	A  rather  strange  full  page  ad  bearing  the  words,   	"We  are  in
				    	trouble,"  in  extremely  large  print  appeared  in  the  morning  edition  of
				    	six  n~tionnlly  circulated  newepapera  an  13  March~    	In  the  corner  of  the
				    	page  was  a  small  print  explatation  which  said~   	"Japan's  t~lephone  system
				    	is  in  danger.     	'The  sponsora  of  the  nd  were  the  Telecommunfcation  Machine
				    	Industry  Aasociation  and  the  Telecommunication  Cable  and  Other  Related
				    	zndustries  Association.
				    	These  are  not  familiar  names  but  upon  closer  reading  it  turns  out  that
				    	these  are  groups  of  subcontractors  for  NTT  and  their  message  is  "The
				    	United  States  tells  us  to  open  equipment  for  NTT  to  co~peritive  inter-

				    	decline  and  service  costs  will  increase."
				    	Reading  between  the  lines  it  seems,   	in  short,   	that  if   	there  were  free
				    	competition  those  businesses  which  so  far  have  been  idling  along  With  a

					    	(Text]    	"Whatever  may  be  done  in  the  case  of  telecommunications  machinery,
					    	n  firm  decision  ehould  be  made  to  liberalize  at  l.east  a  part  of  tele-
					    	cortnnunicationa  cables  gnd  service  parts."    	This  stat~ment  was  made  in
					    	the  economic  ministerial  level  conference  which  m~t  on  12  February  and
					   	executives  of  the  telecommunicationa  cAble  industry  seemed  to  have
					   	virtunlly  leapt  up  in  astonishment  at  what  went  on  in  that  conference.
					   	'fl~e  igAUe  of  releasing  NT'C's  equipment  procurement  had  been  regarded  as  a
					   	symbol  of  the  friction  in  Japanese-United  Stat~s  trade.    	Whatever  might
					   	t~ave  been  the  reaction  to  making  telecommunications  cable  alone  the  prime
					   	ta~get  of  this  move,   	business  seems  to  have  been  taken  aback  by  the  idea

				    	in  bidding,  we  will  have  to  publicize  detailed  meChodg  concerning  toals
				    	for  copper  refining,   	etc.,   	in  order  to  have  the  United  States  make  cable
				    	for  Japan.    	Ultimately,   	technology  on  which  Japan  has  ~pent  money  would
				    	flow  out  of  Japan.    	In  thia  process  Japan  would  be  learning  nothing  from
				    	the  United  Statea.    	Consequently,  only  the  United  States'   	level  of
				    	technology  would  go  up.    	Japan's  induatry  would  lose  out  in  competition
				   	overseas  ancl   	then  in  Japan.    	In  the  end  the  induatry  would  be  ruined.
				    	But,   	it  would  be  fine  if  all  the  countries  in  Che  world  wer~  to  have
				    	competitive  bidd~ng."   	(Mr  Kumamoto)
				    	If  this  is  the  case  with  telecommunications  cable,  one  can  probably
				    	conjectu~re  what  would  be  the  case  wiCh  other  telecommunicarion  equipment.
				   	Of  course,   	it  is  probably  undeniable  that  one  of  the  reasons  NTT  will
				    	adamantly  resist  opening  up  the  door  is  that  NTT  has  in  mind  the  pre-
				    	servation  of  the  "NTT  family"  where  people  from  NTT  can  be  placed.
				    	Nevertheless,   	since  it  is  the  United  StaCes  which  is  making  this  un-
				    	reasonable  demand,   	how  is  the  Japanese  Covernment  to  respond  to  it?
				   	An  expert  in  economics  gives  this  explanation.
				    	"Opening  up  NTT  is  one  of  America's  demands,  but  it  is  not  so  strong  a
				   	demand.    	It  is  being  taken  up  on  a  grand  scale  because  of  the  "family
				    	situation"  on  the  Japanese  side.    	The  itens  of  greatest  interest  for  the
				   	United  States  are  beef  and  oranges  on  which  a  tentative  compromise  was
				   	reached  but  this  left  a  great  deal  of  dissati~faction  in  the  United  States.
				   	For  success  in  the  Tokyo  Round  and  for  Prime  Minister  Ohira's  trip  to  the
				   	United  States  before  the  end  of  the  round,  Japan  needs  some  sort  of
				   	"present."    	However,   	since  the  "beef  and  orange  farmers"  cannot  be  angered
				   	before  the  unified  local  elections  and  the  House  of  Councillors  election,
				   	NTT  has  been  taken  up."

					  	be~n  sh~rply  atCacked  in  a  United  Stntea  Congressional  reporC  on  Japanese-
					  	Americ~n  Trade   	(The  Jones  Report).
					  	bisst~tisfiPd  with  Japgn's  heavy  surplus  balance,   	the  United  StaCes  is
					  	using  NTT  instead  of   	the  beef  and  oranges  it  had  been  using  until  only
					  	recently  as  the  symbol  of  Che  cloaed  nature  of  JapAn's  market  and   	is
					  	pressing  for  liberalization  of  equipment  procurement.    	Prime  Minister  Ohira

					  	visit  Co  the  United  States  comiMg  up  in  May  some  compromise  will  have  to
					  	be  made  but  resistance  from  NTT  is  strong.    	There  are,  of  course,   	some
					  	fairly  convincing  poinCs  in  what  the  corporation  says.
					  	5ome  of   	the  corporation's  counter  arguments  are:    	"When  we  inCroduce
					  	telecommunications  equipmenC  we  develop  this  equipment  in  con~unction
					  	with  domestic  manufacturers  from  the  research  stage  on.    	If  we  were  to
					  	change  from  the  current  private  contract  method  to  competiCive  bidding
					  	we  would  be  forced   	to  make  public  detailed  manufacCuring  methods  and  know-
					  	how  would  flow  out  to  foreign  countries."
					  	"Japan's  telephone  service  boasts  Che  lowest  breakdown  rate  ir?  the  world.
					  	This  is  because  we  even  go  into  the  factorfes  to  make  our  checks.    	Such
					  	stringenC  checks  would  not  be  possible  in  foreign  firms."
					 	The  situation,   	however,   	is  too  complicated   	to  have  the  United  States
					 	understand  these  excuses  from  NTT.    	Besides,   	there  have  been  some  weak-
					 	nesses  in  the  corporation's  handling  of  the  matter;   	the  export  promotion
					 	delega~ion,   	the  ~roup  of  United  States  Congressmen  and  the  people  from  the
					 	United  States  Government  who  have  visited  Japan  on  this  matter  since  last
					 	autumn  were  received  in  such  a  way  that  they  were  left  hanging.    	Thus,
					 	the  persistent  thinking  within  the  government  is  that  whatever  else  may
					 	be  said,   	the  corporation's  best  counter-argument  is  that  the  20~  companies

						on  a  bill  Co  asAeas  imporC  aurcharges  against  Japan,  ~desC  Germany  nnd
						Switzerland  begina  before  Che  Tokyo  Summit,   	the  conference  would  be
						under  an  oppreasive  aemosphere  and  there  would  be  no  chance  of  success.
						From  this  point  of  view,   	it  is  desirable  for  Japan's  economy  as  a  whole
						that   	Eriction  in  Japanese-American  trade  be  kept  to  a  minimum  by  making
						NTT's  procurement  of  machinery  as  open  as  poasible.    	Nevertheless,
						friction  in  Japanese-American  trade  relations  will  probably  not  disappear
						even  if   	the  NTT  question  is  aettled~    	Even  if  NTT  were  Co  buy  from  the
						United  States  10  percent  of  the  nearly  $3'billion  worCh  of  equipment  it
						procures  annually,   	this  would  come  only  to  $30  million  and  this  would  be
						only  a  drop  in  the  bucket  in  light  of   	the  total  trade  imba3ance  (Che
						United  States  deficit  in  trade  with  Japan  last  year  was  $11.6  billion).
						Judging  from  the  difference  in  productivity,   	the  difference  in  efforts
						to  export  and  the  relationship  between  growth  rates  and  exporCs  in
						United  States  and  Japanese  industry,  Japan's  surplus  trade  balance  can
						be  viewed  as  "structural"  and  the  surplus  will  continue  in  the  near
						future  even  if  the  surplus  in  the  ordinary  balance  declines  somewhat.
						The  United  States  also  sees  its  trade  deficit  with  Japan  as  "structural"
						~nd  looks  for  its  causes  in  Japan's  "unfair  trade"  and  insufficient
						c:fforts  to  cooperate  overseas.    	Consequently,   	the  United  States  will  press
						for  increasing  the  Japanese  growth  rate  and  changing  Japan's  system  and
						pr~ctices.    	Our  side's  real  inclination  is  t~  reply  that  "we  are  distressed
						that   	the  United  States  will  not  accept  the  fact  that  the  surplus  will

					     	[Text~    	The  current  point  of  focus  in  Che  attempt  to  avoid  economic  friction
					    	beCween  Jnpan  and  the  United  SCaCes  is  Che  question  of  opening  up  NTT
					    	in  which  it  is  dem~nded  Chat  NTT  admit  foreign  �irms  to  participaCidn
					    	when  Che  corporation  procures  equipment.    	From  the  technological  point
					    	of  view,   	however,  mosC  busineas  people  feel  that  "there  is  liCtle  equip-
					    	ment  which  NTT  can  import."
					    	NTT's  yearly  capital  procurement  comes  to  about  600  billion  yen.    	Out  of
					    	this  200  billion  yen  is  spent  for  high  technology  intensive  products  such
					    	as  electronic  swiCching  equipment  and  coaxial  cable  with  a  life  span  of
					    	20  to  40  years.    	The  level  of  Japanese  technology  in  this  field  is  very
					    	high  and  only  a  handful  of  the  largest  American  companies,   	such  as  AT  and
					    	T  can  contend  with  the  four  giant  emnmunications  firms  Nihon  Denki,
					    	Hitnchi  Seisaku~o,   	Fukitsu  and  Oki  Denki.    	S~nce,   	however,   	the  large
					    	American  communications  manufacturers  have  no  intention  of  coming  into
					    	Japan,   	there  can  be  no  equipment  imports.
					    	~ven  in  the  case  of  types  of  equipment  which  belong~  technologically  in
					    	the  second  rank,   	it  seems  that  Japanese  firms  would  win  out  if  NTT  were  to
					    	implement  competitive  bidding.    	In  the  field  of  public  pay  telephones,
					   	for  Example,  one  firm,  Tamura  Denki  Seisaku~o  says~   	"We  are  the  firm  that
					   	controls  the  Third  World  markets,  such  as  Southeast  Asia."    	Ultimately
					   	what  Japan  can  import  can  be  narrowed  down  to  Celecommunications  cable  and
					   	some  terminal  items  such  as  in-house  switching  equipment  and  telex  which
					   	Are  employed  at  the  user's  end  of  the  system.    	Even  for  these  items  it
					   	seems  Che  precondiCion  w~uld  be  "if  the  American  firms  sell  cheaply  to
					   	gain  a  market."    	For  E,xample,  NTT  showed  a  liberal  attitude  toward  intro-
					   	duction  of  the  pocke:  bell  on  which  the  American  Motorola  mounted  a  sales
					   	camp~~i~n.
					   	Nevertheless,   	even	 	these  items,  with  their  small  scale  markets,   	are
					   	combined   	they  woulc  not  be  of  too  much  use  in  reducing  the  surplus  in
					  	Japan's  internation~~.l  balance.

					 	has  assumed  a  cautious  attitude   	toward  iCs  conCinuation  because  ori~ianlly
					 	the  cooperation  question  was  decided  politically  and  because  it  has  too  much
					 	of  Fukuda's  hand  in  it.
					 	When  visiting  Che  United  St~tes   	in  May  last  year,   	Prime  Miniater  Fukuka  ~n-
					 	nounced  his  concepC  for  Japan-U.S.   	science  and  technology  cooperation  at  the
					 	Japan  Club  in  New  York.    	The  prime  minister  had  two   	things  in  mind:    	first  of
					 	all,   	nuclear  fusion  for  energy  developmenC  in  the  21sC  century,   	and  secondly,
					 	hydrogen  utilization  from  photosynthesis.    	However,   	last  summer,  at  the  offic-
					 	ial  level  negotiations,   	the  U.S.   	brought  up  only  energy  technology  for  Chis
					 	century,   	such  as  coal  liquefaction,  geoChermal  energy  and  wind  power  genera-
					 	tion.    	What  each  country  was  asking  was  compleCely  contrary  to  the  other;
						but,   	finally,   	both  countries  compromiaed,   	giving  cooperative  supporC  to  nuclear
					 	fusion  and  coal  liquefaction.    	They  decided  concretely  on  the  following  three:
					 	1)    	Japan  will  participate  25%  in  America's  Gulf  Oil  Company's  coal  liquefac-
					 	tion   	technology,   	"SRC  II;"    	2)    	the  U.S.  will  invest  25%  in  the  Ministry  of
					 	International  Trade  and  Industry's   	(MITI)  Agency  of  Industrial  Science  and
						Technology's  "methods  for  direct   	storage  of  liquefied  hydrogen"  technology;
						3)    	the  U.S.  and  Japan  will  ~ointly  invest  50~  each  in  the  remodeling  plan
						ot  America's  General  Dynamics'  nuclear  fusion  experimental  equipment,   	"Doublet
						3."
						Amon~  these,   	"SRC  II"  will  require  an  extremely  large  amount  o.f  money;   	the
						totlil  cost  for  the  5-7  year  period  is  anticipated  to  total  about  700  million
						do11:3rs   	(130  billion  yen).    	Japan  and  West  Germany  will  each  participate  25%
						to  the  U.S.'s  50~.    	But,   	the  disadvantage  is  that  "SRC  II"  will  be  able  to
						use  U.S.   	coal  and  West�G~rman  coal,  but  not  Japan's  coal.    	MITI's  explanation
