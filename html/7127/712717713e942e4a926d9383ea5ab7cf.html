 Talking Points for the NSC
 Gorbachev and the Military
 Summary:   Gorbachev's efforts to restrain the growth of defense
 spending and modify Soviet positions on several sensitive
 security issues are causing some uneasiness within the
 military.   Gorbachev, however, has demonstrated he can manage the
 military for now and his Politburo colleagues appear to be giving
 him time to demonstrate whether his domestic and foreign policies
 will work.
 Gorbachev's Security Policy
 1.   Gorbachev has made the modernization of the Soviet economy
 an important part of his security policy.   His focus on civilian
 investment has inevitably challenged the economic priority
 accorded the military.
 o   Accounts of Gorbachev's unpublished speech in Moscow to
 the military leadership in Minsk in July 1985 claims he
 told them there would be "zero growth" in the military
 budget.
 some military officers       25X1
 believe Gorbachev intends to budget less for defense, and
 are dissatisfied because their interests would be
 adversely affected.
 o   Our estimates suggest some       increases in defense spending,
 but it may be less than some military leaders feel  they
 need to keep pace with United States.
 2.   To help justify the strategy, he and his political allies
 have highlighted  that economic weakness has security
 implications.
 o   In his interview with the Czechoslovak party daily in
 September,  Gorbachev argued that "if we become stronger
 and more solid economically, politically, and socially,
 the capitalist world shows greater  interest in normal
 realtions with us."

 Supporters in the Central Committee have noted that
 Western aggressiveness increased when the USSR began to
 face serious economic problems in the late 1970s, and a
 healthy economy was the best guarantee of combatting
 imperialism.
 3.    Gorbachev appears to be trying to ease pressure for defense
 spending by diplomacy and effective public relations.
 o   In February, he placed unusual emphasis on the role of
 diplomacy in national security, telling the party congress
 that "the nature of today's weapons denies any state the
 hope of defending itself solely by military-technical
 means... security is increasingly a political task, and  it
 must be solved by political means."
 Gorbachev and his advisors have privately exuded optimism
 about their ability to play on Western and American public
 opinion and boost efforts to restrain US defense spending.
 o   Gorbachev has taken a number of steps--the nuclear test
 moratorium, shifts in arms control proposals, offers of
 troop cuts,  shifts in verification policy--that
 significantly modify Soviet positions.
 Gorbachev told the military that such concessions were
 necessary to achieve an arms control agreement with the
 United States.
 Military Reaction to Gorbachev Defense Policy
 4.    Military reaction in both public and private commentary
 range from implicit support to quiet resignation.   Gorbachev
 apppears to have a fair amount of support among some officers,
 who may take a longer term view of national security and may
 believe their career advancement will depend on their loyalty.
 Statements by some Soviet military leaders suggest they recognize
 that future military power demands major improvements in economic
 performance.
 o    Since at least the late 1970s and particularly since
 Gorbachev's election,  some military officers have argued
 that new weapons systems depended heavily on advanced
 technologies stressed in his modernization drive.

 5.   While defense industry leaders have a long-term interest in
 the modernization program, Gorbachev's modernization drive could
 exacerbate friction in the short term, as military procurement
 and defense industry modernization increasingly compete for
 priority with civilian machine building.
 o  The military newspaper Red Star published an article last
 winter by a major general, who expressed uneasiness about
 the failure of the new party program to incldude a promise
 to supply the military with all "modern means"  to secure
 the national defense.
 o   Gorbachev allies,  Premier Nikolay Ryzhkov and Secretary
 Lev Zaykov, who oversses defense industries, have publicly
 advocated more defense industry assistance to the civilian
 economy and several defense industry managers have been
 criticized by the Politburo for producin-g_ shoddy consumer
 goods.   These developments probably generate some tension
 with defense industry leaders.
 6.   Over the longer haul, Gorbachev could face a tougher
 challenge sustaining support from the military and defense
 industry managers.   While the high level of past investments in
 defense industry give him breathing space to moderate investment
 in that sector, he will come under increasing pressure to invest
 in defense industry for the production of the next generation of
 weapons toward the end of the decade.
 o   The severity of the competition for resources will depend
 on the success of his modernization strategy.
 o   If it falls  far short of plan goals, as we now expect,
 this would  force Gorbachev to choose between diverting
 resources from his modernization goals and stinting on
 defense industry needs.   This choice would be more
 difficult if his foreign policy strategy--heavily reliant
 on negotiations to avert major new threats like SDI--fails
 to bring  favorable results.
 Security Concerns
 7.    Gorbachev's foreign and arms control policies appear to be
 even more controversial with the military than his resource
 allocation decisions,  judging by                              open
 sources.   There has been evidence of military concern on several
 key fronts.
 o    Arms Control: The military has reportedly been anxious
 about shifts in the Soviet position to facilitate
 reengagement with the United States.   One Soviet diplomat
 claimed that members of the military establishment  felt
 that Gorbachev's  "bold"  proposals gave  away  too much while
 the United States had offered nothing  in  return.

 some forces from Afghanistan andMongoli'  and the possible
 openning of Vladivostok--the headquarters of the Soviet
 Pacific Fleet--to foreigners.
 o Moratorium:   Several Soviet officials,       including
 Gorbachev, have suggested that the military does not
 enthusiastically support his nuclear testing moratorium.
 They may be uneasy about its open-ended nature--its
 already been extended four times--and their ability to
 keep pace with SDI without testing.   A senior military
 officer publicly alluded to differences, while denying any
 military-political rift.
 o   Verification:   Articles by senior military leaders suggest
 their continued uneasiness with on-site inspections, and
 military representatives at some arms fora have resisted
 intrusive verification as tantamount to espionage despite
 Gorbachev public statements accepting the principle.
 Civilian Echos of Military Concerns
 8.     Certain of Gorbachev's Politburo colleagues reportedly
 shared some of the military's uneasiness after last year's summit
 meeting.
 o Gorbachev's tone at the November 1985 Supreme Soviet
 following the summit was defensive,  stressing the positive
 nature of American commitments to the reengagement process
 and the opportunities this afford for influencing public
 opinion.   The Politburo statement on the summit, however,
 downplayed the atmospherics and stressed the need  for
 progess on SDI.   Premier Ryzhkov subsequently argued
 against those who "belittled" the results, addressing
 probable criticism.

 President Andrey Gromyko reportedly shares some of the
 military's concerns about Gorbachev's strategy of           25X1
 reengagement with the United States.   His public
 endorsements of the Geneva summit were not as strong as
 Ukrainian party boss            25X1
 Vladimir Shcherbitskiy, a full member of the Politburo and
 longtime supporter of defense interests, acted as a
 spokesman for some in the military in challenging the
 wisdom of last year's summit.               _
 Reshaping the Military
 9.   Despite these diverse signs of their unhappiness with many
 of his security policies, Gorbachev probably does not face a
 concerted political challenge from the military or his
 colleagues.   So far, he has had the initiative and has
 effectively employed his control of appointments to strengthen
 his position.
 o   His success in pressing his security agenda has also been
 faciliated by the turnover of the political leadership
 since Brezhnev's death.   The Politburo is dominated by
 Gorbachev allies.
 o   The top leadership may now be less sensitive to military
 concerns.   While many of the leaders from Brezhnev
 generation had close ties to the military or had served  in
 the Second World War, only two current full members of the
 Politburo--Shcherbitskiy and KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov--
 served in the military.
 o    Gorbachev has made key changes in the military leadership,
 including the naming three new service chiefs and one
 additional deputy minister, a new first deputy minister,
 and the head of the Main Political Administration.
 o    Gorbachev has taken steps to replace top Brezhnev era
 defense managers--appointing new heads of the Council of
 Ministers'  Military Industrial Commission and the party's
 Defense Industry Department.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP87TO1145R000100110010-4
 10.   The political  influence of the military has also eroded due
 to loss of its two most forceful spokesmen in 1984 with the death
 of Defense Minister Ustinov and the demotion of Marshal Ogarkov
 from Chief of the General Staff.
 o   Ustinov's replacement, the 75-year old Marshal Sergey
 Sokolov,  is not a politically influential  figure,  and only
 has candidate membership on the Politburo in contrast to
 his two predecessors who were full members.
 o   General Staff Chief Akhromeyev is less assertive than his
 outspoken predecessor, Marhal Ogarkov.'
 Implications
 11.   The current level of skepticism over Gorbachev's approach
 among some civilian and military leaders is not-sufficient to
 challenge Gorbachev politically in the short-term.
 o   Gorbachev now commands a dominant position in the
 Politburo, having routed the Brezhnev old guard, and
 retains operational control over foreign policy.
 o   His allies appear to have endorsed his strategy for
 dealing with the US and are willing to allow time for
 Gorbachev to demonstrate whether his strategy of holding
 down military spending to modernize the economy will work.

 Talking Points for the NSC
 The New Soviet Foreign Policy Establishment
 Summary:  Since becoming party leader in March 1985, Mikhail
 Gorbachev has achieved considerable personal control over Soviet
 foreign policy decisionmaking and appears to have broad
 leadership support for his foreign policy strategy.
 -- His efforts have intensified since the Geneva summit and
 he has now largely succeeded in putting his own foreign
 policy team in place.
 -- Changes in Soviet foreign policy decisionmaking apparatus
 appear intended to provide the leadership with a broader
 array of information and policy options on security
 issues.
 -- Soviet willingness to introduce a number of bold
 proposals, particularly in the arms control arena,  is a
 clear departure from past practice and  indicates
 Gorbachev has considerable political lattitude in
 pursuing his foreign policy objectives.
 Revamping  the MFA
 1.   Gorbachev inherited a rusty foreign policy decisionmaking
 apparatus that was  ill-suited to dealing with the complex
 challenges now confronting Soviet foreign policy.
 -- Under Brezhnev and during the protracted succession
 period,  Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko gained
 unprecedented control over both the formation and
 implementation of Soviet foreign policy.
 -- Gromyko presided over a foreign policy apparatus that had
 undergone little change during his 30-year tenure as
 foreign minister and was increasingly ineffective in
 meeting new diplomatic challenges  (INF, waning Soviet
 influence in the Third world).

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP87TO1145R000100110010-4
 -- There was growing concern among lower-level officials at
 the lack of strong policy direction from the top.
 2.   Gorbachev began his assault on the foreign policy
 establishment by ending Gromyko's tenure as foreign minister and
 moving him to the largely honorific post of president in July
 1985.
 By replacing him with a novice in the foreign policy
 sphere--former Georgian party leader Shevardnadze--
 Gorbachev was better able to place his personal stamp on
 the direction of Soviet foreign policy.
 Gromyko's move and the subsequent reshuffling of foreign
 affairs personnel has greatly reduced hit and the MFA's
 influence on foreign policy.
 3.   Gorbachev renewed his drive to reshape the MFA at an
 unprecedented gathering of the foreign policy establishment in
 May 1986.
 Gorbachev was sharply critical of the MFA's past
 performance.
 Gorbachev complained of the diplomatic corps'  failure to
 transmit negative news back to Moscow,  signaling out
 reporting on foreign reaction to Soviet arms control
 proposals as overly positive.
 The conference was implicitly critical of Gromyko's
 approach and called for a more pragmatic and flexible
 foreign policy.
 4.   In the wake of the conference, personnel turnover in the MFA
 accelerated, particularly in the area of East-West relations.
 -- Both First Deputy Ministers were replaced with men having
 extensive experience in East-West affairs,  underscoring
 the high priority the leadership places on bilateral
 relations.
 -- Alexsandr Bessmertnykh,  the former head of the Ministry's
 USA Department with 18 years experience in the US, was
 appointed Deputy Minister responsible for bilateral
 relations.
 -- New departments have been created to deal with arms
 control and human rights.

 Strengthening Party Control
 5.   Changes in the party Secretariat at the 27th Party Congress
 in March 1986 marked a new stage in Gorbachev's efforts to
 reshape the foreign policy apparatus.
 -- Anatoily Dobrynin, a career diplomat, was brought back
 from Washington to run the International Department
 replacing Boris Ponomarev who had served as its chief for
 30 years.
 -- Vadim Medvedev replaced Brezhnev crony Konstantin Rusakov
 as head of the bloc relations department.
 -- Gorbachev's propaganda tsar Alexsander Yakovlev--an
 expert on US policy--was elevated to the Secretariat.
 6. Gorbachev followed up by expanding the charter of Dobrynin's
 International Department.   By most accounts the department has
 become Gorbachev's most important source of policy advice.
 -- Rather than dealing mostly with non-ruling communist
 parties and front groups, as it had done since its
 formation in 1955, it was given a broad role in all
 aspects of foreign policy.
 Former First Deputy Foreign Minister  Korniyenko was
 appointed Dobrynin's assistant, adding another top US
 specialist to the party apparat.
 The creation of a new arms control sector headed by Lt.
 Gen.  F. M.  Starodubov, gave the department the expertise
 necessary to formulate its own views on the technical
 details of arms control,  independent of the General
 Staff.
 -- Starodubov's appointment could be a step towards the
 creation of an NSC type structure in the Central
 Committee,  that Gorbachev is reported to want.   Such a
 staff would increase his ability to make the large Soviet
 foreign policy bureaucrary serve him.
 7.   The Secretariat's Propaganda Department has also assumed new
 responsibilities and launched a more sophisticated effort to
 garner a favorable Western response to Gorbachev's policy
 initiatives.
 -- It took over the function of the International
 Information Department, which was abolished, and now
 oversees both the internal and external propaganda.

 -- Under Yakovlev the Soviets have demonstrated a more
 nuanced public diplomacy.   He appears to be giving new
 impetus to Moscow's efforts to court West Europe, and
 exploiting   the differences between the US and  its major
 allies as well as play more effectively on US opinion.

 formulation has shifted from the MFA to the Secretariat.

 Dobrynin is the key player in forming US-Soviet policy.
 His high profile and wide-ranging activities indicate
 that he has a central role in all aspects of Soviet
 foreign policy.
 Yakovlev also continues to serve Gorbachev as a key
 foreign policy advisor.   The recent appointment of Yuri
 Sklyarov as Chief of the Propaganda Department is
 reportedly designed to leave Yakovlev free to concentrate
 on larger issues--including possible summit preparations.
 Other Players
 10.   Beyond the formal party and governmental bureaucracy,  the
 General Secretary has other sources for policy advice,  some of
 which represent important groups whose views cannot be easily
 discounted.   Gorbachev has enhanced his own role in
 decisionmaking by acting as the chief arbiter among these
 competing centers.
 Through his Politburo membership and his unique expertise
 on US-Soviet relations,  Gromyko can play a role in
 foreign policy, possibly serving as a focal point for
 opposition.
 Although civilians now appear to be playing a larger
 role, military views still carry considerable weight in
 developing arms control positions.
 The KGB plays a major role in acquiring and analyzing
 data relevant to foreign policy decisions.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP87T01145R000100110010-4
 -- Gorbachev's personal staff plays a key role in foreign
 policy decisionmaking by drafting speeches and
 coordinating materials from other key players.   Gorbachev
 recently appointed Anatoily Chernayev as his foreign
 policy expert, replacing Andrey Aleksandrov-Agentov,  who
 was the key foreign policy advisor to Brezhnev, Andropov
 and Chernenko.
 -- A number of foreign policy institutes are also playing an
 important role in supplying analysis to policymaking.
 While their role in the policy process is indirect--
 institute leaders such as Georgiy Arbatov  (head of the
 Institute of USA and Canada)  can become more directly
 involved in policymaking as a result of their consulting
 activities for key leaders.
 11.   The changes in the foreign policy apparatus over the past
 year should provide Gorbachev more creative options with which to
 achieve his objectives, and put him in a better position to set
 the agenda.   The Politburo,  however, remains the place where
 final decisions on all important issues in Soviet foreign affairs
 are hammered out, and domestic constraints may prevent Gorbachev
 from implementing some of his ideas.
 -- Many of the changes Gorbachev has instituted are designed
 to ensure that the foreign policy apparatus will be more
 responsive to the top and that he will receive a wide
 range of advice.
 -- Advancement of Americanists  in the MFA and Secretariat
 suggests that Gorbachev will be getting better advice
 about the US than any of his predecessors.
 -- While the General Secretary cannot unilaterally impose
 decisions on the Politburo, he appears to have gotten
 general approval  for his foreign policy strategy, has
 effective opperational control over the decision-making
 apparatus, and has considerable lattitude in pursing
 agreed objectives.

 MEMORANDUM
 SUBJECT:  Gorbachev's Goals at the Reykjavik Meeting
 While it is obvious that Gorbachev hopes that his personal engagement of
 the President might lead to major substantive movement by the US on key arms
 control issues, it mtrst be far from obvious to Gorbachev that the President
 will accommodate him.
 -- From Moscow's perspective, the most likely areas of possible agreement
 are a framework INF agreement (i.e. an agreement on a mutually
 acceptable outcome with the details to be worked out in Geneva), an
 accord on Risk Reduction Centers, and possibly an agreement on banning
 chemical weapons.  In each of these areas, US and Soviet positions have
 moved closer to one another in recent months.
 Gorbachev's optimal goal for the Reykjavik meeting would be to further
 solidify the prospects for an INF agreement complemented with additional
 understandings on either nuclear testing or an agreed formula for continuation
 of SALT-related constraints, however characterized.  He probably does not
 realistically anticipate that a formula for continued adherence to the ABM
 Treaty or on SDI research constraints can be achieved at the Reykjavik
 meeting.  At best, he is probably hoping that the President might agree in
 principle to continue a dialogue on extending or non-withdrawal from the ABM
 Treaty.  Likewise, Gorbachev will probably defer discussion of reductions of
 offensive nuclear arms pending US movement on the ABM Treaty issue or possibly
 nuclear testing.
 A framework INF agreement in particular would be attractive to Moscow
 because it would serve the goal of encouraging European expectations of early
 progress on an issue close to home, thus potentially increasing the pressure
 on the US for compromise on the technical aspects of an accord such as
 verification while promoting the image of a more benevolent Soviet security
 posture toward West Europe.  Gorbachev may thus view the Reykjavik meeting as
 an opportunity to bargain with the President on the remaining major issues of
 dispute on INF--Asian reductions and limits on shorter range systems--arguing
 that an INF accord coupled with agreement on secondary issues would allow for
 an early summit in Washington.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP87T01145R000100110010-4
 While such a package may be enough from Moscow's perspective to justify
 the Reykjavik meeting, Gorbachev's public and private statements have
 repeatedly cited ABM/SDI issues and nuclear testing, in addition to INF, as
 central to Soviet deliberations on a summit.  Despite the recent progress on
 INF, therefore, Gorbachev's agenda in Reykjavik will be to press the President
 hard on additional issues such as the ABM Treaty, SDI research, nuclear
 testing and future US policy on SALT restraints.
 Given Gorbachev's presumed interest in-bargaining directly with the
 President, it is also possible that Gorbachev may offer new ideas or surprise
 initiatives on each of these issues.
 -- Such surprises might include proposing to ban all ABM systems (an idea
 voiced by Foreign Minister Shevardnadze during his conversations with
 Secretary Shultz), an expression of interest in agreed limits on-
 strategic nuclear force levels (including US cruise missiles) even if
 certain SALT-defined limits are exceeded by the US, or a proposal for a
 low threshold nuclear test ban instead of a total ban.
 Gorbachev's purpose in such probing would be to guage the President's
 underlying flexibility in addressing stated Soviet concerns.  In this regard,
 public and private Soviet commentary has suggested strongly that the Soviets
 perceive significant divisions within the US Administration on a number of
 arms control issues.  The US-Soviet arms negotiations in Geneva as well as the
 recent set of nuclear experts talks in Moscow and Washington may have led
 Gorbachev and his colleagues to conclude that expert-level negotiations are,
 in effect, hostage to US bureaucratic politics.  In response, Gorbachev will
 try to elicit the President's own views on the possibilities for compromise in
 order to better gauge his own policy options not simply with respect to
 summitry, but with regard to continuing Moscow's nuclear test moratorium,
 Soviet commitment to SDI-type research programs, and other military programs
 potentially subject to arms control understandings.
 Gorbachev may have relatively little to say on regional and bilateral
 issues, although Foreign Minister Shevardnadze stated on 1 October that the
 talks could include discussions of Afghanistan.  His recent public and private
 statements suggest that he is most concerned with bilateral strategic arms
 issues.
 -- He probably anticipates that the President will raise questions related
 to Soviet arms control compliance but Gorbachev will almost certainly
 seek to defuse these by downplaying their importance.
 -- Similarly, he probably anticipates that the President will raise human
 rights issues.  Gorbachev will no doubt seek to deflect the issue
 without appearing contemptuous.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP87T01145R000100110010-4
 Nevertheless, Gorbachev will probably not want to appear combative in
 view of his presumed interest in convincing the President that compromise on
 outstanding issues is possible.  To this end, he will probably not dismiss out
 of hand contentious issues.
 -- On compliance, he may seek to appear responsive to the President by
 offering to discuss on-site inspection in the context of future arms
 control accords, while rejecting contentions of past Soviet cheating.
 -- On human rights, he may offer movement on such issues as divided
 families, while stressing that arms issues should be the main focus for
 the Reykjavik meeting.
 What Could Go Wrong?
 The Reykjavik meeting could carry some domestic political risk for
 Gorbachev if its results made Gorbachev appear either to be embarrassed
 personally or weak in the face of a determined and uncompromising US
 President.  Substantively, however, the Reykjavik meeting would appear to
 entail relatively low risk for Gorbachev; the persistence of continued
 disagreement on central issues would affect the issue of a summit but would
 probably not saddle Gorbachev in the eyes of his Kremlin colleagues with the
 onus for failing to make progress.  Indeed, if the Reykjavik meeting should
 somehow prove disappointing to Moscow, the Soviets will no doubt seek to lay
 the blame at Washington's feet for lack of progress in arms control, claiming
 that Washington's allegedly uncompromising position on such issues as nuclear
 testing had derailed the summit and was forcing Moscow to consider resumption
 of nuclear testing once its unilateral moratorium expires in January.
 It is more likely, however, that Gorbachev expects a mixed outcome from
 the Reykjavik meeting without radical concessions on either side.  The
 appearance of continued dialogue, from Moscow's perspective and from
 Gorbachev's personal political perspective, would allow for continued Soviet
 maneuvering on the summit issue.  Moscow's strategy in this regard appears to
 be to exact as high a price as possible from Washington for a second summit
 while keeping open the option of a more modest substantive agenda for such a
 meeting if the President appears willing to enter into a bargaining process on
 nuclear arms issues, including INF, and if Moscow judges, therefore, that the
 process of summitry itself will facilitate the continued evolution of US
 positions.

 EXCERPTS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 27 MAY
 DECISION ON MUTUAL RESTRAINT
 "...I have determined that, in the future, the United States
 must base decisions regarding its strategic force structure on the
 nature and magnitude of the threat posed by Soviet strategic
 forces, and not on standards contained in the SALT structure.
 "...As we modernize, we will continue to retire older forces
 as our national security requirements permit.  I do not anticipate
 any appreciable numerical growth in US strategic offensive
 forces.  Assuming no significant change in the threat we face, as
 we implement the strategic modernization program the United States
 will not deploy more strategic nuclear delivery vehicles than does
 the Soviet Union.  Furthermore, the United States will not deploy
 more strategic ballistic warheads than does the Soviet Union.
 "In sum, we will continue to exercise the utmost restraint,
 while protecting strategic deterrence, in order to help foster the
 necessary atmosphere for significant reductions in the strategic
 arsenals of both sides...I call on the Soviet Union to seize the
 opportunity to join us now in establishing an interim framework of
 truly mutual restraint" (emphasis in text).

 Allied Expectations for the Reykjavik Meeting
 Allied publics and governments in Western Europe and the Far
 East overwhelmingly welcome the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in
 Iceland.     Allied publics in particular will be looking to the
 meeting for confirmation of a thaw in US-Soviet relations.   In
 West European eyes, maintaining momentum in the arms control
 process is as important as the content of any agreement.
 Expectations now focus largely on INF.
 --   European publics will be satisfied if the two leaders
 appear to be having a serious and friendly dialogue, and
 if plans are announced for a follow-up summit in the
 United States.
 --   Any announcement of concrete progress toward achieving
 an agreement in one of the arms control forums would be
 an added plus.
 --   A statement indicating US willingness to exercise
 restraint in strategic force deployments also could have
 as favorable an impact on public opinion as a new arms
 control agreement.
 A positive tone to the meeting and subsequent Summit could
 provide a significant boost to several governments.
 This memorandum was prepared by the Office of European
 Analysis and the Office of East Asian Analysis.

 --    In the context of the Korean peninsula, South Korea
 presumably would welcome US emphasis on the need for
 Moscow's North Korean ally to resume the North-South
 dialogue.  With the 1988 Olympics in Seoul on the
 horizon, President Chun also is concerned that the
 Soviets not only give a favorable public view of
 stability on the peninsula, but also attend the Games.
 On the negative side, we believe that public expectations
 for the meeting probably are overly high, and will certainly grow
 if rumors spread over the next week that an agreement to limit
 INF is imminent.
 --   If a framework for an INF agreement is not achieved,
 disappointed expectations would reduce the meeting's
 positive impact on public opinion by focusing press
 commentary on the reasons for lack of progress toward an
 agreement.
 If West European leaders and politicians suspect an INF
 agreement is imminent, they may well issue optimistic statements
 next week speculating about the impact of an agreement on
 deployments in their countries.
 --   Such statements could weaken the US bargaining position
 and increase future pressures on Washington to achieve
 an INF accord.
 --   Dashed optimism could also reopen a debate in the
 Netherlands about whether initial deployments should
 proceed at all.
 Allied governments will want to be kept informed of
 preparations for the meeting.  Despite the general desire for an
 INF accord, there is considerable nervousness about its terms,
 and a number of officials have warned that any agreement must not
 overlook Allied interests.

 replacing withdrawn Pershing Its with Pershing I-Bs.
 --   All of the basing countries also worry that the number
 of INF warheads in Western Europe might fall so low as
 to reopen a debate about reallocation of missiles among
 the basing countries.
 --   Seoul                                                 would worry
 that an agreement favoring Europe would fuel domestic
 criticism that the US sees Korea as merely a pawn in its
 global strategy.

 Likely Allied Reactions to an Interim INF Agreement
 Any INF agreement leading to a reduction of the number of Pershing Its and
 QQ4s in Western Europe would be immensely popular and would vindicate those
 governments which expended much political capital by endorsing deployments.
 Allied governments will want to be kept informed of preparations for the

 Bs.
 --   All of the basing countries also worry that the number of INF warheads
 in Western Europe might fall so low as to reopen a debate about
 reallocation of missiles among the basing countries.  From their
 standpoint, there should be enough warheads deployed to permit basing
 in all five basing countries.

 China's Response to Gorbachev's Speech
 Summary
 We  believe China   will  seize  the  opportunity  presented  by
 Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech to push for further Soviet concessions, to
 increase Chinese leverage with the United States, to explore ways to
 reduce the Soviet threat to China, and to sow concern in Hanoi about the
 reliability of Soviet support. Domestically, Deng may see an opportunity
 to set the course for China's relations with the USSR before he hands over
 power to his successors, leaving them free to focus on the reform
 program.
 In  our  judgment,  China  has  not  changed  its  fundamental
 assessment  of the  Soviet threat--nor is  it even  reevaluating  it.  By
 publicly calling for Soviet concessions on Cambodia, Beijing has placed a
 constraint on how far it can go with Moscow and tried to reassure
 Washington. In responding to Gorbachev, we believe Beijing will attempt
 to probe for and encourage additional concessions from Moscow without
 alarming the United States and China's Asian friends or allowing Moscow
 to exploit a Sino-Soviet dialogue to enhance Soviet leverage in the
 Office of East Asian Analysis.  Information available as of 8
 October 1986 was used in its preparation.

 triangle.  In keeping with its "independent foreign policy," moreover, China
 will continue to send mixed signals in its press commentary on both
 Soviet and US actions.
 At the ninth round of bilateral normalization talks that began in
 Beijing on 6 October, we believe Beijing, in addition to pressing on
 Afghanistan and Cambodia, is pushing Moscow to:
 ? Withdraw the majority of Soviet troops from
 Mongolia.
 ? Pull back troops from its border with China.
 ? Reduce SS-20s deployed in the Soviet Far East.
 ? Curtail reconnaissance flights against China
 through North Korean airspace.
 ? Relinquish Chimnaya/Heixiazi Island across from
 Khabarovsk.
 In our judgment, significant Soviet concessions in at least one area
 could  induce  China  to  make  one  or  more  of  the  following
 counter-concessions:
 ? Conclude a mutual nonaggression pact with Mongolia.
 is Agree to confidence-building gestures along its northern border.
 ? Set dates for foreign ministerial talks.
 ? Increase working-level exchanges and consultations.
 In fact, the Chinese have already agreed in principle to resume
 border talks suspended since 1978 and last month allowed visiting Soviet
 First Deputy Premier Talyzin to meet with Premier Zhao Ziyang.
 We believe the Chinese will continue to rebuff Soviet efforts to
 reestablish party ties and will not agree to a summit between Gorbachev
 and either preeminent Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping or General Secretary
 Hu Yaobang prior to significant Soviet concessions on Cambodia. China is
 in the process of normalizing party relations with Eastern Europe--a move
 apparently sanctioned by Moscow in the hope of facilitating possible
 normalization  of  Sino-Soviet  party  ties  later--to  promote  Chinese
 influence in the region at Moscow's expense.       The Chinese also will
 continue to expand defense and economic ties with the United States.[

 Beijing's Soviet Policy on the Eve of Gorbachev's Speech
 In the months preceding Gorbachev's speech on 28 July, the Chinese increasingly
 exhibited signs of frustration with Moscow's refusal to follow up its smooth rhetoric
 with concessions on any of what China calls the "three obstacles" to improved relations:
 Soviet  support  for  Vietnam's  occupation  of  Cambodia,  the  Soviet  presence  in
 Afghanistan, and the deployment of Soviet troops in Mongolia and along the Sino-Soviet
 border. Beijing last year tried to encourage Gorbachev to reassess Moscow's hardline
 policies toward China's security concerns by agreeing--without corresponding Soviet
 concessions--to resume long-suspended trade union and parliamentary relations and to
 exchange visits by their foreign ministers in 1986.  We believe these moves were also
 designed to increase Beijing's leverage with Washington.
 Moscow's  continued  intransigence  at  the   last  three  biannual  Sino-Soviet
 consultations and its blatant efforts to exploit the impression of improved Sino-Soviet
 ties to enhance its position vis-a-vis Washington, however, caused Beijing to brand
 Gorbachev's foreign policy as meaningless "smile diplomacy" and to back away from the
 exchange of foreign ministers.  We believe Beijing chilled political relations for two
 reasons.  First, the Chinese wanted to remind Moscow that the Soviets must address at
 least one of the "three obstacles" if gradual normalization of relations were to continue.
 At the same time, the Chinese sought to reassure the United States, Thailand, Pakistan,
 and others that China remained committed to resisting the security threat posed by the
 USSR and its Asian allies.
 Indeed, Soviet military developments prior to Gorbachev's speech did little to
 persuade Beijing that Moscow had altered its long-term strategy of encircling China.
 Although Gorbachev has not deployed any new ground forces or SS-20s in the Far East,
 he  has  markedly  stepped  up  reconnaissance flights targeting the  Chinese  coast,
 expanded the Soviet Pacific Fleet, and upgraded Soviet airpower in the region.

 Gorbachev's Proposals
 In his speech given in Vladivostok on 28 July, Gorbachev made the
 following new proposals concerning China:
 ? The Soviet Union will withdraw six regiments from Afghanistan by
 year's end.
 ? Moscow is ready to discuss "concrete steps" to reduce land forces
 along the Sino-Soviet border.
 ? Soviet and Mongolian leaders are examining the removal of a
 "substantial part" of what we believe to be approximately 60,000
 Soviet troops in Mongolia.
 ? The Soviet Union and China could cooperate in space exploration.
 Gorbachev once again:
 ? Proposed bilateral discussions "any time, and at any level"
 on improving relations.
 ? Suggested the official boundary on the Amur River might pass
 along the main shipping channel instead of the Chinese bank.
 (Although this is the first time Moscow has publicly proposed
 this boundary formula, the Soviets did so privately as early
 as 1964.)
 ? Resurrected his call last year for a Helsinki-style Asian
 security conference.
 ? Reiterated Soviet willingness to establish a rail link between
 Soviet Kazakhstan and Chinese Xinjiang.
 ? Endorsed already-begun bilateral negotiations to jointly develop
 the Amur River Basin.

 Factors Governing China's Response
 Public              statements by senior Chinese officials indicate that Beijing
 sees   Gorbachev's   proposals     as   failing   to   address   China's   top   security
 concerns--Vietnam's efforts to expand its influence at China's expense and Soviet
 efforts to encircle China militarily.  Chinese strategic thinkers have also stressed in
 private conversations with Americans that China's assessment of the Soviet threat has
 not changed.
 Nonetheless, we believe China has compelling reasons to begin a dialogue with
 Moscow on Gorbachev's proposals.       In our judgment, Beijing believes further marginal
 improvements in Sino-Soviet relations would:
 ? Buy time for China to modernize its forces along the border.  Beijing is in the
 process of implementing a new defense strategy that it believes requires at least
 a decade of reduced tensions to become completely credible.
 ? Stimulate competition between Moscow and Washington to woo Beijing.
 ? Increase tension in Soviet-Vietnamese relations, a major Chinese goal, by playing
 on Hanoi's fear of being sold out by Moscow.  Vietnam periodically dispatches
 delegations to Moscow to seek reassurances of Soviet support.
 ? Assist domestic political goals.
 At the  same time,  Beijing  is well aware that too positive a  response to
 Gorbachev's  proposals could jeopardize its access to US, Japanese, and Western
 European  advanced technology,  investment, trade, and defense cooperation--major
 Chinese political goals.   Nor does Beijing want to signal its friends and enemies in
 Southeast  and   South  Asia  that it  might  reconsider its  stand  on  Cambodia  and
 Afghanistan. Therefore, we believe China will attempt to:
 ?  Encourage Soviet flexibility while continuing to criticize on the three obstacles
 and other security issues.
 ? Probe for major Soviet concessions on the three obstacles and China's northern
 boundary.
 ? Reassure Washington of China's pro-Western tilt, but implicitly try to exploit its
 option of playing the "Soviet card" to extract concessions from the United States
 on Taiwan or other bilateral issues such as trade and technology transfers.
 ? Reduce Moscow's ability to play the "China card" against Washington.
 ? Keep Thailand and Pakistan from wavering on Cambodia and Afghanistan.

 Domestic Fallout from the Gorbachev Speech
 Deng and his reform allies can gain in two areas from some further
 relaxation in Sino-Soviet relations, in our view.  First, any reduction in tensions
 tends to benefit China's economic modernization program.  Second, progress on
 the issue should smooth the transition to power for Deng's successors.
 We believe Deng has designed many of China's foreign policy initiatives,
 most notably closer relations with the West, to support his economic reforms.
 Consequently, although he distrusts the Soviets, Deng would probably be willing
 to be more flexible if he believes he can win real Soviet concessions that can
 help his modernization goals.  Avoidance of border tensions allows a more
 measured pace of military modernization and frees transport, manpower, and
 other resources. Deng may also hope to expand exports of goods China cannot
 trade elsewhere and gain further Soviet assistance in modernizing Soviet-built
 factories.
 On the political front, Deng may see an opportunity to set China's Soviet
 policy before he hands power over to his successors. We believe that Deng has
 kept foreign policy issues closely under his own control, relying on his personal
 prestige and influence to manage this sensitive area.  Deng's successors will
 not have his personal clout and therefore might be more vulnerable to groups
 that either have a different foreign policy orientation or seek to exploit foreign
 affairs for domestic political ends.  The more Deng can stabilize relations with
 Moscow and win agreement on how to proceed, the more likely we believe his
 successors will be able to carry on the reform program with a minimum of
 distraction.
 In our estimation, Deng's conservative opponents, who argued last year
 for a more flexible approach to the Soviets, cannot capitalize politically on
 Gorbachev's initiatives.   We believe that recent political developments have
 greatly weakened the conservatives--especially those at the top--and have
 made it increasingly unlikely that the conservatives will be able to challenge
 Deng.  In any case, it is our judgment that the conservatives are suspicious of
 both the United States and the Soviet Union. Thus, while there is some support
 among the conservatives for more distant relations with Washington, we also
 see very little active pressure for closer political relations with Moscow.

 Possible Chinese Responses
 We believe the Chinese will use scheduled contacts over the next several weeks
 to seek further indications of Soviet intentions, but the ninth round of vice foreign
 ministerial normalization talks in Beijing that began on 6 October provides the best
 venue to engage the Soviets in a meaningful dialogue on Gorbachev's proposals.
 Outlined below is our speculation about what the Chinese may be saying and why.
 Security issues.  Remarks by Chinese strategic thinkers support our judgment
 that China is not satisfied with Gorbachev's implicit pledge to freeze the number of
 SS-20s in the Far East or his explicit promise not to relocate in the region any SS-20s
 that might be removed from Europe. We believe the Chinese are pressing for their total
 withdrawal.   China proably is also protesting overflights of North Korea by Soviet
 reconnaissance planes targeting the Chinese coast, Moscow's expansion of its Pacific
 fleet, and the upgrading of Soviet airpower in the Far East.
 We nevertheless believe that the Chinese view Gorbachev's offer to withdraw
 troops from Mongolia and the Sino-Soviet border as an important unilateral gesture.  If
 the Soviets commit themselves to withdraw one or more of their five divisions in
 Mongolia--a move that would not jeopardize Soviet or Mongolian security--Beijing
 could reciprocate in a number of ways without compromising its own security. Chinese
 options include:
 ? Announcing the "deactivation" of the 69th Field Army opposite Mongolia (we
 believe this unit was secretly deactivated last September).
 ?      Agreeing to warn each other of military exercises or major troop movements
 near the Sino-Mongolian border.
 ? Pulling back tank regiments from selected border defense divisions along the
 Mongolian frontier.
 If the Soviets go beyond a token withdrawal and pull back most if not all of their forces
 from Mongolia, we believe the Chinese would be willing to go further, perhaps signing a
 friendship treaty with Mongolia renouncing any claim to Mongolian territory and serve
 as a de facto mutual nonaggression pact--something the Soviets have been seeking.
 We believe a Soviet proposal to negotiate some sort of demilitarized zone along
 the Sino-Soviet border would be far less attractive to China than deactivation of Soviet
 divisions.  Beijing has always expressed greater concern about the number of Soviet
 divisions in the Far East than about their proximity to the Chinese border.  Nonetheless,
 if the Soviets offered to pull back all regular ground units 30 kilometers from the border,
 China, in our judgment, could respond by transfering northern border security duties
 from the PLA to the People's Armed Police.  China's major PLA border units are already
 deployed 100 kilometers back, leaving small border defense regiments as the only forces
 within 30 kilometers of the frontier.

 Expanded Political Contacts
 China's cautious response to Gorbachev's initiative comes amidst a flurry
 of high-level exchanges with the Soviet Union and Mongolia that we believe is
 a combination of earlier scheduling, Chinese interest in Gorbachev's proposals,
 and Moscow's desire to portray Sino-Soviet relations as improving:
 ? Soviet First Deputy Premier Arkhipov arrived in China for
 "acupuncture treatment" on the eve of Gorbachev's speech
 and met with Vice Premiers Li Peng, Wan Li, and Yao Yilin
 before returning to Moscow on 26 August. According to a
 Western press account, Arkhipov presented the Chinese
 with an advance copy of the speech.
 ? Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing proceeded with
 a long-scheduled trip to Mongolia--the highest-level
 Chinese visit to that country in over 20 years--which
 culminated in the signing of a consular treaty on
 9 August. This treaty is consistent with similar
 agreements Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian signed in Berlin
 and Budapest in late spring, but takes on added signifi-
 cance because it follows on the heels of Gorbachev's
 Mongolian overture, which the two sides also discussed.
 ? Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong began a two-week visit to
 Moscow 17 August, the first such mayoral visit since
 the 1950s.
 ? Soviet Deputy Premier and Alternate Politburo member
 Talyzin, accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister
 Rogachev, visited China in early September as Yao's
 guest. Talyzin also was received by Premier Zhao
 Ziyang and left Beijing with a new consular agreement
 and an accord to expand ties between Soviet and Chinese
 state planning commissions.
 ? Wu and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze held
 the third annual Sino-Soviet foreign ministerial
 meeting at the opening of the UNGA in September.
 They agreed in principle to resume border talks
 next year, but did not schedule reciprocal visits.

 ? President Li Xiannian hosted Polish leader Wojciech
 Jaruzelski for a 3-day working visit to Beijing in
 late September. Jaruzelski also met with Deng Xiaoping,
 Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang, and Zhao. Li, Hu,
 and Zhao accepted invitations to visit Poland and Li
 invited Jaruzelski to make an official visit to China,
 but the two sides stopped short of announcing a full
 normalization of party ties.
 ? Hu and Li will host an official visit to China by East
 German General Secretary and President Honecker in late
 October. Honecker's and Jaruzelski's visits to China--
 the first such trips in many years by Soviet bloc party
 leaders other than Romania's Ceaucescu--and the progress
 toward normalization of party ties most likely signal similar
 developments with other East European Communist parties.
 Beijing sees these visits as leading to increased Chinese
 influence in East Europe, but Jaruzelski's and Honecker's
 party position and the certainty that Moscow has approved
 their trips nonetheless give the visits a Sino-Soviet
 focus as well.
 ? Rogachev is now is Beijing as head of the Soviet delegation to
 the ninth round of Sino-Soviet vice ministerial normalization
 talks.
 Boundary Talks.   Wu and Sherarduadze announced at their UNGA meeting in
 September that China and the USSR next year will reopen formal border negotiations,
 which broke down in 1978 after Beijing publicly insisted on Soviet withdrawal from
 disputed areas and added a new demand that Moscow reduce its forces along the
 Sino-Soviet border to the level of Khrushchev's time.  Gorbachev's hint that Moscow
 would     accept  the deepest  channel  (thalweg)  of  the  Amur  River  as  the  line  of
 demarcation holds out the promise that China would exercise sovereignty over most of
 the disputed islands in the river.  Ownership of Chimnaya (Heixiazi) Island opposite
 Khabarovsk, however, is likely to be a sticking point, and any negotiations on the border
 are likely to be protracted as both parties weigh the impact on disputes with other
 nations.
 Amur River Basin and Railway Cooperation.  China earlier this year reopened to
 Soviet shipping the port of Tongjiang on the Songhua River near the Amur, and we
 believe the two sides will sign an agreement on use of the basin based on their recent
 expert-level  negotiations.   China  has  announced  that  it  plans  to  extend  the
 Harbin-Longzhen railway 240 kilometers to Aihui on the Amur River and might cooperate
 with  the  Soviets  in  building  a  rail  bridge  across the Amur between Aihui  and
 Blagoveshchensk to facilitate border trade.    In the west, China plans to add some 400

 kilometers to the  single-track Lanzhou-Urumqi  railway, extending  it
 to
 within
 80
 kilometers of the Soviet railway terminus at Druzhba.  We would not
 be
 surprised
 if
 Beijing accelerated its construction schedule and agreed to connect the two railways as
 a sign of goodwill to Moscow.
 Areas Where Beijing is Unlikely to Accommodate Moscow
 Beijing has stated it will not compromise with Moscow on Afghanistan and
 Cambodia,  and  we  believe  China  will  hold  significant  improvements  in political
 relations--such as party ties and a Deng/Hu-Gorbachev summit--hostage to meaningful
 Soviet movement on these "obstacles."     In an interview with Mike Wallace of "60
 Minutes" in early September, Deng offered to travel to Moscow to meet with Gorbachev
 if--but   only  if--the Soviets withdraw their  support for Vietnam's  occupation  of
 Cambodia.
 China probably calculates that even the hint of China's flexibility on these issues
 would greatly harm its credibility with the United States, and such Asian friends as
 Pakistan and Thailand.  Moreover, we believe the Chinese will attempt to assuage their
 friends'  natural suspicions  of any  Sino-Soviet  border agreement,  and may  couple
 progress in one area with stepped-up criticism of Soviet activity elsewhere, especially
 Cambodia and Afghanistan.   We expect the Chinese to reject Gorbachev's proposed
 Asian security conference, as they have in the past.  Beijing also will not, in our view,
 agree to forswear the option of strategic cooperation with Washington against Moscow.
 Finally, Beijing's pride in its own space-launch capabilities most likely will keep
 China from taking Gorbachev up on his offer to join the ranks of Mongolia, Cuba, and
 various East European satellites as a junior partner in the Soviet space program.  The
 Chinese, moreover, have already expressed interest in a US invitation to participate in a
 future space shuttle mission.
 Positive Signals China Can Send in Other Areas
 Even  if the Chinese  rule  out  concessions  specifically  linked to Gorbachev's
 proposals on the grounds that Gorbachev merely responded to earlier Chinese gestures,
 they could nevertheless reward Gorbachev and encourage further Soviet concessions in
 other ways. Possible moves might include:
 ?         Increasing consultations between working-level officials on international issues,
 including relations with the United States.
 ? Regularly exchanging views
 economic development and foreign policy issues.
 ? Proceeding with the exchange of foreign ministerial visits.
 ? Exchanging visits by editors of Pravda and People's Daily.

 Without significant progress on Cambodia, however, we believe the Chinese will
 not agree to a summit between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping or Hu Yaobang.  Such a
 move would be too close to a resumption of party ties, which Beijing probably believes
 would  give  the  Soviets  excessive  leverage  within  the  strategic  triangle  while
 undermining China's credibility as an independent actor in both the West and in the
 Third World.
 Outlook for the Remainder of 1986
 We expect the Chinese to try to use Gorbachev's initiative to encourage US
 concessions on Taiwan, trade, and technology transfer. But Chinese officials in private
 probably will take pains to reassure the United States and others of China's continued
 goodwill.  Beijing, in our judgment, will exploit the "coincidental" timing of Defense
 Secretary Weinberger's and Rogachev's visits and the fact that US Navy warships in
 November will make their first port call to China to press the Soviets for concessions on
 Chinese security concerns and to balance any improvements in relations with Moscow.
 China will also closely monitor developments in US-USSR relations as a possible
 full-blown Reagan-Gorbachev summit approaches, out of concern that Beijing may be
 caught behind the curve.  Finally, in keeping with its "independent foreign policy," China
 will continue to send mixed signals in its press commentary on both Soviet and US
 actions.
