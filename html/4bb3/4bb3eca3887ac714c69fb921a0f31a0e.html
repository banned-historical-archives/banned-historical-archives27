 FAR EAST
 Indochina: Politicians Hold Forth
 The political wrangling that was stirred up
 by Lon Nol's sudden resignation over two weeks
 ago finally ended when the ailing Cambodian
 leader fashioned a compromise solution for or-
 ganizing a new government. Ironically, his blue-
 print called for him to remain as prime minister,
 with Sirik Matak still responsible for actually
 running the regime as his "delegate." Matak lost
 little time in assembling a new cabinet, which
 won quick approval from the National Assembly.
 Before Lon Nol re-entered the picture, Chief
 of State Cheng Heng made several futile attempts
 to find someone who would agree to try to as-
 semble a new cabinet. His first candidate was
 Matak, who quickly declined on the grounds that
 he was unwilling to respond to pressures for
 sweeping changes in government personnel and
 policies. Heng's next nominee was his own lack-
 luster personal counselor, Chuop Hell, who evi-
 dently was never a serious choice and who bowed
 out of the running in short order. National As-
 sembly President In Tam was next on Heng's list,
 but his candidacy soon collapsed when he was
 unable to get the backing of Lon Nol and Matak.
 The compromise proposal fashioned by Lon Nol
 succeeded in calling a halt to this passing parade
 before it reached Son Ngoc Thanh
 Matak's political position seems to have
 improved considerably as a result of the prime
 ministerial imbroglio. With a reaffirmation of sup-
 port from Lon Nol, he probably can continue to
 rely on the cooperation of the military establish-
 ment. Moreover, his chief political antagonist,
 Lon Non, apparently has been whipped into line
 by his brother, the prime minister. It is likely that
 Lon Non's strong public declaration early in the
 week supporting Matak was part of the price
 Matak demanded in exchange for his agreement
 to put together and direct the new government.
 Matak's cabinet has the earmarks of a politi-
 cal compromise. The most important positions in
 the new administration have been allocated to
 members of the outgoing government and the
 Phnom Penh establishment. Matak, for example,
 will act as his own defense minister. Foreign Af-
 fairs Minister Koun Wick retains that position,
 while National Assembly President In Tam is first
 vice premier and minister of interior. Matak's
 choice for second deputy prime minister in charge
 of economic affairs is Sok Chhong, the former
 director of the National Commercial Bank. Hang
 Thun Hak, the popular minister of community
 development, has retained that portfolio and also
 is third deputy prime minister. At the ministerial
 working level, however, Matak has filled the re-
 maining ten cabinet slots with junior bureaucrats,
 most of whom seem to be relatively well qualified
 for their respective responsibilities.
 The new administration should be able to
 get off to a relatively stable start. Now that they
 have helped contribute to the eclipse of some of
 the old guard, reform-minded elements in the
 capital are likely to be content to sit back for the
 time bein  and see how the new government
 perform

 The Military Situation
 The Cambodians also registered some rare
 military progress during the week. Over a month
 after they set out to reopen Route 4, government
 forces-spearheaded by Khmer Krom troops-
 finally succeeded in making contact with the two
 Cambodian Army battalions that had been
 stranded at the Pich Nil pass. Only limited Com-
 munist resistance was encountered by the govern-
 ment troops as they moved into the pass area. No
 Cambodian truck convoys have yet tried to use
 Route 4, however, probably because there are still
 sizable numbers of Communist troops near Pich
 Nil.
 Vietnam: Thieu Thinks Election
 President Thieu's early re-election activities
 are centered on frequent image-building trips to
 the hustings. He is currently spending a day or
 two in the countryside each week, and plans three
 such trips a week as the election nears. In the
 manner of Western campaigns, he confers with
 local officials and mingles with the populace. He
 also makes a standard, hard-line, anti-Communist
 speech to evoke national pride, and enumerates
 the government's programs that reflect favorably
 on his stewardship in Saigon.
 Thieu also apparently is trying to ensure the
 support of some usually progovernment political
 parties. Recently he reportedly urged labor leader
 Buu to organize his new Farmer-Workers Party
 (FWP) more quickly, and indicated that he would
 support FWP candidates in this summer's Lower
 House elections. Earlier, Thieu suggested to lead-
 ers of the Revolutionary Dai Viet Party that he
 would back some of their candidates in the Lower
 House elections. Thieu's basic attitude toward
 party politics probably has not changed-he holds
 most politicians and parties in low esteem-and he
 still seems determined to rely primarily on other
 groups such as the government bureaucracy. He
 apparently realizes, however, that parties do have
 some influence in the country and that their
 support could decide a close election. With Vice
 President Ky's candidacy becoming more likely,
 Thieu may feel that there is now a greater chance
 for a tight race.
 Thieu may also be concerned about support
 from the South Vietnamese Army-support he
 considers vital to his re-election.
 Little Fighting For Now
 A period of accelerated Communist activity,
 evidently set for early May, still has not gotten
 off the ground. Enemy forces along the coast in
 the northern provinces shelved or even called off
 many attacks that had been long in preparation
 with two notable exceptions: South Vietnamese
 territorial forces beat back a strong assault by

 Communist regulars below Da Nang; and the
 Communists' stepped up rocket bombardment of
 Da Nang city and the adjacent air base.
 Laos: Talking about Talking
 In the first important political move in many
 months, the Communists this week proposed re-
 viving discussions with the government to arrange
 peace talks.
 The reaction on the gov-
 ernment  side. was                  positive  and with cabinet
 approval a cable was sent to Souphanouvong wel-
 coming Souk's visit. No further word has been
 heard from the Communists, although speculation
 has already begun in Vientiane that Souk will be
 arriving there early this month.
 The talks about peace talks last year were
 largely concerned with procedural questions, and
 both sides tried to gain the advantage before
 entering  into substantive  matters.  The Com-
 munists proved fairly flexible, backing away from
 sweeping demands for a total bombing halt as a
 prelude to  talks and accepting a face-saving
 formula on the question of whether Souvanna's
 negotiator would represent him as "prince" or as
 "prime minister.  The preliminary talks broke
 down, however, when Souvanna rescinded his
 earlier agreement that the negotiations would be
 conducted in the Communist-held town of Khang
 Khay on the Plaine des Jarres. The whole subject
 was suspended while Operation Lam Son 719 was
 being executed.
 How seriously the Communists and the
 Laotian Government intend to push for talks this
 year and how flexible they are prepared to be in
 order to move the negotiating situation along will
 become clearer after Souk's arrival. The objectives
 of the NLHS presumably are still to lay the
 groundwork for a future settlement that will
 enable it to resume some participation in the Lao
 Government and, more immediately, to obtain a
 bombing halt or some other diminution of the
 war that is to its advantage.
 Muong Phalane Falls Again
 Three battalions of government irregulars
 were driven from the Muong Phalane area on 2-3
 May by a North Vietnamese force estimated at
 five battalions. The irregulars, who had recap-
 tured the town about six weeks ago after the
 Communists seized it in late January, withdrew
 westward to Dong Hene and have been moved
 back to their base camp for rest and refitting. One
 company of irregulars is still missing, however,
 and is believed to have suffered heavy casualties.
 Communist propaganda has claimed that
 Dong Hene will be attacked after the fall of
 Muong Phalane. If the Communists follow past
 practice, however, they will be content with hold-
 ing Muong Phalane during the rainy season, thus
 keeping government forces well to the west of the
 important  Communist  infiltration  corridor
 through Muong Phine.

 Communist China: Face Saving or Face Lifting?
 The large May Day turnout in Peking last
 week shed little light on the intensified infighting
 that has wracked China's ruling elite over the past
 year.  Instead, the regime's handling of three
 prominent absentees and its refusal to list the
 remaining  politburo  members  who  appeared
 alongside Mao Tse-tung and heir-designate Lin
 Piao in any sort of authoritative pecking order
 indicate that Peking is still unable to solve its
 difficult leadership equation.
 The most notable absentees were politburo
 standing committee  members Chen Po-ta and
 Kang Sheng. Chen, Mao's personal secretary, and
 Kang, the regime's top security specialist, played
 leading roles in Mao's sweeping purges of the old
 Communist Party apparatus. According to per-
 sistent rumors circulating in Peking's diplomatic
 circles, Chen and Kang were severely criticized at
 a major party gathering last fall, and both have
 been out of sight for some time.
 Peking attempted to rationalize the absences
 with the lame excuse that some leaders were
 unable to be present due to "work or sickness."
 The Chinese have never before resorted to this
 device to explain the absence of important lead-
 ers. At this stage it seems premature to conclude
 that both men, long close allies of Mao, have been
 finally divested of all responsibility within the
 leadership, but their continued absence from pub-
 lic view strongly suggests that they have suffered
 a major setback.
 The fluidity of the current leadership situa-
 tion in Peking was also affirmed by the absence
 from the ceremonies of politburo member Hsieh
 Fu-chih, who came under fire last year, pre-
 sumably from leftist elements in the regime. Al-
 though Hsieh was appointed head of the Peking
 municipal party committee on 19 March, he did
 not deliver the customary address at the munici-
 pal congress and may not even have been present
 at the meeting. Hsieh's continued lingering in the
 shadows thus suggests that there is still some
 pulling and hauling going on within the leadership
 over his political status.
 Signs of continuing strains throughout the
 leadership hierarchy were also evident in the
 sober regime commentary on domestic develop-
 ments in the authoritative editorial marking May
 Day. The editorial's stocktaking of internal prog-
 ress was surprisingly limited, particularly in view
 of the rapid quickening since last December in the
 formation of party committees at the provincial
 level and below-the first order of domestic busi-
 ness for the past two years. Instead of indulging
 in  self-congratulation,  however,  the  editorial
 stressed the necessity for senior cadre to improve
 their  understanding  of  Mao's  "revolutionary
 line," to combat resurgent revisionist influences,
 and to commit fewer mistakes. Such strictures
 have become the overriding theme in domestic
 propaganda in recent months, and their reitera-
 tion not only attests to the often broad gap
 between Peking's demands and the performance
 of local authorities but also reinforces the im-
 pression that fundamental differences over policy
 implementation are continuing to feed personal
 antagonisms at the top of the regime.

 Philippines: Protesters on the Move
 The fatalities during May Day demonstra-
 tions in Manila have set the stage for a new period
 of domestic turmoil. The Philippine student
 movement, which has been relatively quiet since
 February, fielded some 2,500 leftist students and
 workers in a protest over the policies of the
 Marcos administration. Despite advance warning
 that the group was inclined toward violence, only
 forces untrained in antiriot techniques were as-
 signed to the scene at the Congress building.
 Firing into the crowd, the security forces killed
 four and wounded over 30, allegedly after the
 protesters hurled homemade bombs. An indigna-
 tion rally set for 7 May promises to be massive,
 although the clear readiness of the government to
 take firm repressive measures could persuade radi-
 cal organizers to ease off on provocative acts.
 Student disaffection is based on conviction
 that President Marcos is using the presidential
 office for self-enrichment to the neglect of the
 country's pressing social and economic problems.
 Despite his repeated denials, suspicion is growing
 in the Philippines that Marcos intends to evade
 the two-term constitutional limit, which obliges
 him to step aside after his current term expires in
 1973. This view is strengthened by the obvious
 efforts of President and Mrs. Marcos to control
 delegates  to a constitutional  convention that
 opens next month.
 Student radicals have looked on the exercise
 in constitutional reform as an administration ploy
 to divert public attention from government short-
 comings and as a tool for Marcos to further his
 own political ends. Student activism, currently
 limited by the absence of many students from
 Manila for the annual school holidays, could
 reach serious proportions after the new school
 year begins in July. Students no doubt will dem-
 onstrate then against expected increases in school
 fees, which were raised last year. If by mid-sum-
 mer Marcos also has tried to push the constitu-
 tional convention into lifting the stricture against
 his continuance in office, the student temper
 could be considerably inflamed.
 A Marcos decision to impose martial law in
 the face of persistent street action would have the
 immediate result of hardening battle lines and
 would have a widely adverse effect on public
 opinion. The government might be hard pressed
 to maintain security, although it certainly has
 enough well-trained forces to prevent a complete
 breakdown of law and order. In the longer run, a
 dramatic manifestation of popular disillusionment
 with the leadership could have a strong bearing on
 Marcos' final decision regarding a  residential
 term  after  1973.

 Soviet-US Relations: Trade, Politics, and Violence
 A high-level Soviet economic delegation led
 by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Komarov
 arrived in the US on 5 May for a two-week visit.
 The 14-man delegation is composed largely of
 representatives of the motor vehicle and ma-
 chine-building industries.
 The primary purpose of the visit is probably
 to obtain advanced technology and equipment
 from US corporations for a heavy truck manu-
 facturing complex to be built in the USSR. The
 Soviets have already conducted preliminary nego-
 tiations with some of these firms through inter-
 mediaries. The delegation will also try to encour-
 age US businessmen to lobby for relaxation of
 licensing controls on the export of sophisticated
 manufacturing equipment to the USSR.
 Anomalies in the arrangements for the visit,
 however, suggest that political as well as eco-
 nomic  considerations  may be involved. Most
 members of the present delegation were sched-
 uled to come to the US several weeks ago, but
 their trip was postponed. No more was heard on
 an official level until 22 April, shortly after the
 sudden "thaw" in US-Chinese relations, when
 Soviet officials hastily began arranging visas for
 the delegation-only two weeks before it was to
 depart. Moreover, the composition of the delega-
 tion was upgraded by the addition of several
 high-ranking officials. Moscow's haste in upgrad-
 ing the delegation, its timing, and other peculiari-
 ties suggest a link to Soviet concerns over the
 turn in American-Chinese relations and a desire to
 offset recent events.
 Moscow apparently attaches considerable
 political and economic importance to the visit. It
 has been arranged despite recent warn;ngs from
 both Foreign Minister Gromyko and Ambassador
 Dobrynin that curtailment of Soviet delegations
 to the US is being given "serious consideration"
 because of continued harassment and violence
 directed against Soviet officials here.
 Some curtailment of cultural exchanges has
 already occurred. The Soviets have refused to
 approve a previously arranged trip for a US per-
 forming group, contending that because "condi-
 tions" in the US had forced cancellation of the
 1971 Bolshoi Ballet tour, the USSR should not be
 obligated to receive US groups. In addition, the
 Soviets have balked at permitting a US techno-
 logical exhibit, stating that harassment in the US
 may force cancellation of a similar USSR exhibit.
 I he Soviets obviously believe that they have
 been restrained in their reaction to attacks on
 Soviet personnel, fire-bombings of their auto-
 mobiles, bombings of Soviet offices, and other
 such harassment. What seems to irritate them
 especially is the fact that many of those re-
 sponsible have thus far escaped punishment. The
 Soviets are prone to regard the inability of the US
 Government to interfere effectively in these local
 judicial matters as calculated "connivance" by
 Washington in the harassment. The fact that most
 of  the  harassment  is carried  out by Jewish
 militants only makes matters worse in Soviet
 eyes.
 Should the attacks and harassment continue,
 further  deterioration  in  the  atmospherics  of
 Soviet-US relations is likely-including additional
 curtailment of cultural exchanges and retaliation
 in Moscow against US officials and citizens. But,
 as the visit of the economic delegation suggests,25X1
 Moscow will not abandon those exchanges and
 other contacts it considers to be in its own in-
 terest.

 Civilian R&D Still Troubles Soviets
 At the 24th party congress Brezhnev con-
 tinued to show concern over the persistent prob-
 lems of assimilating new technology into civilian
 production, stating that "the weakest links (in
 technical progress) are those which connect the
 achievements of science with their practical reali-
 zation         and  utilization  in  mass  production."
 Eleven decrees were issued on this subject during
 1965-70, but these have failed to effect any dra-
 matic improvements in applied civilian research
 and development (R&D).
 Faced with declining factor productivity
 (labor and capital) in industrial production since
 the late 1950s, the Soviets have been aware that
 more rapid introduction of modern technology is
 needed to reverse this trend. Despite claims by
 Brezhnev that a "planned socialist economy
 opens the widest scope to the all-sided progress of
 science and technology," efforts have been ham-
 pered by the ineffective organization of the scien-
 tific and technical sector as well as by the criteria
 used to judge the performance of research and
 design institutes and industrial enterprises.
 Over-all civilian R&D goals are centrally
 planned, and there is insufficient coordination
 between the scientific researcher, the designer,
 and the final user at the enterprise level. The
 researcher and designer receive little feedback re-
 garding the success or failure of their inventions
 and the user has little control over the design of
 equipment received. In addition, technological ad-
 vancements are usually planned on an enterprise-
 by-enterprise basis with little thought to broader
 applications.
 Some aspects of the incentive system further
 hinder coordinated R&D efforts. Researchers' and
 designers' rewards do not depend on the use-
 fulness of their inventions. Enterprise incentives
 focus on short-run goals for output, profits, and
 sales fulfillment, thus discouraging disruptions of
 the productive process and extensive outlays of
 funds for new equipment.
 The 11 decrees that have been issued reflect
 the regime's deep concern over the problem but
 also show that the Soviets have not developed a
 consistent approach for reaching a solution. Some
 provisions extend the role of centralized control,
 while others grant more autonomy to directors of
 scientific organizations. One promising provision
 encourages linking research, design, and testing,
 and bases rewards on the effectiveness of a new
 development. With the exception of industry-
 wide reform in the electrotechnical industry,
 however, the effects of the decrees appear to be
 negligible.
 In  many  cases,  imported  technology
 provides only a short-run solution, bypassing
 applied R&D channels and meeting the same
 resistance at the enterprise level as new Soviet
 technology.  Future efforts at speeding the
 implementation of new technology will largely
 depend on the integration of research institutes,
 design organizations, and enterprises. Removing
 enterprise resistance  to  new  technology  will
 probably require restructuring  incentives to
 reward  innovation,    and  adjusting prices to
 compensate for the initial high costs of new
 methods of production.

 East Germany: Passing the Torch
 "The years are demanding their due and do not allow
 me any longer to carry out such demanding activity
 as that of Central Committee First Secretary. "
 With these words Walter Ulbricht prefaced his
 resignation on 3 May from the top party post in
 favor of his protege, Erich Honecker.
 There are numerous reasons why the change
 came about at this time. Besides his age and its
 accompanying infirmities, Ulbricht's penchant for
 overambitious economic plans had become a domes-
 tic irritant. Moreover, the Soviets were annoyed by
 his obstructionist attitude regarding East-West nego-
 tiations. Given these circumstances, the 78-year-old
 leader apparently felt that it was expedient to imple-
 ment his carefully nurtured plan for an orderly
 transfer of authority, an unprecedented event in
 ruling Communist circles. Ulbricht is now chairman
 of the party, a new, honorary post, as well as chair-
 man of the Council of State. While neither of these
 posts as such confers meaningful political power,
 Ulbricht may continue to wield influence on key
 questions.
 Honecker became a politburo member in 1958,
 and diligently worked at advancing his own career.
 No matter was too small or too great for his atten-
 tion. His activities ranged from dealing with citizens
 seeking permission to visit relatives in the West to
 the substantial task of supervising secret prepara-
 tions for the erection of the Berlin Wall in the
 summer of 1961. In addition, he has been the
 party's cadre chief and has had responsibility for all
 security matters. Honecker is skilled at political ma-
 neuver, and has a strong personal following in the
 party.
 At a central committee meeting last December,
 Honecker joined with a consensus of politburo
 members who favored economic policies placing
 high priority on a balanced economy and an im-
 proved standard of living for East German workers.
 This contrasted with Ulbricht's position, which em
 phasized developing a few select industries such as
 computers and chemicals. Honecker so skillfully
 handled this turning point in relations with Ulbricht
 that there were no visible signs of disruption within
 the party.
 The USSR was the first of East Germany's
 allies to congratula'e Honecker warmly. Less effu-
 sive congratulations from other Eastern European
 capitals followed. Initial domestic reaction appar-
 ently favors the changeover.
 Honecker's previously expressed views on for-
 eign policy, however, give little indication that Pan-
 kow will alter its hard-line position on relations with
 the West. In his maiden speech as party first secre-
 tary on 3 May, Honecker reiterated East Germany's
 demand that Bonn ratify the treaties with the USSR
 and Poland prior to a settlement on Berlin. Never-
 theless, Honecker does not have Ulbricht's prestige
 in Moscow, and should the Soviets decide to move
 in the stalemated Berlin negotiations, the key to
 European  detente,  Honecker  would  have  little
 choice but to go along.                         25X1

 The Vatican has resisted pressures from
 both the Polish Government and episcopate for
 a resolution of the question. Even though it
 favors the normalization of Polish church-state
 relations, it does not want to offend German
 Catholics. Some members of the Curia, how-
 ever, appear to be less concerned about Ger-
 man sensibilities on this issue. Cardinal Koenig
 of Vienna, for example, made his position clear
 during a tour of the disputed Polish territories
 last week when he referred in speeches to "this
 land of yours-your western territories."
 Many other points of friction between the
 episcopate and the regime will have to be me-

 tions can occur. These include disputes in the
 fields of religious education, the religious press,
 taxes, and church construction. There has been

 want the Vatican to recognize the Polish church's

 Vatican prefers to delay any decision until after
 the Polish - West German nonaggression treaty is

 this matter would amount to de facto recognition
 of Poland's postwar borders.

 The property transfer cannot be completed,

 episcopate. Several members of the Polish ecclesi-

 plead their case, and Bishop Dabrowski was re-

 Yugoslav Regime Confronts Internal Problems
 Deeply angered by growing regional chauvin-
 ism, criticism of party reforms, and noncompli-
 ance with economic stabilization measures, Presi-
 dent Tito has been forced into using his consider-
 able prestige to demand forceful corrective meas-
 ures. This obviously personal tactic, although po-
 tentially effective,  is a temporary setback to
 Tito's efforts to institutionalize the choice of his
 eventual successor as well as to his plans for a new
 decentralized federal system. Tito has already re-
 ceived the party leadership's general endorsement
 for the program and regional party support seems
 to be falling into place, but there are signs of
 resistance from other quarters that could pose a
 test of wills.
 Last week the party presidium was sum-
 moned to Tito's Brioni retreat for three days of
 private discussions on internal problems. The de-
 liberations ended in apparent unity on the gravity
 of the problem but seem to have failed to pro-
 duce a comprehensive scheme for corrective ac-
 tion. Some vague steps were announced, which
 included plans for convening, at an unspecified
 date, a party conference on ideological unity and
 organizational strength. There was also a call for
 correction of "shortcomings" in the internal se-
 curity apparatus, and an announcement of a firm
 policy for checking the "destructive criticism"
 emanating from the national press. Moreover, the
 presidium ordered heightened vigilance against
 foreign attempts to undermine national unity.
 The day after the presidium announced its
 position, Tito took his case to the people. Speak-
 ing at a May Day celebration in Labin, he blasted
 critics of his reform program, demanding stern
 measures against irresponsible media, student dis-
 sidents, and those managers who ignore centrally
 imposed economic stabilization measures. In the
 latter case, Tito threatened a sweeping purge that
 "will probably take a few months." This an-
 nounced plan for extensive personnel changes
 could be counterproductive, lead to further de-
 lays and confusion, and in the end weaken the
 President's ability to carry through his political
 and economic programs.
 Tito also said there would be party cadre
 changes and a "regrouping" of the federal gov-
 ernment. He indicated that he wants to transform
 the party into a unifying force around which the
 federation can be safely decentralized.
 Regional party support for Tito's position
 seems assured. The Croatian party, which has
 been the focus of criticism, has called for a cen-
 tral committee plenum on 11 May, presumably to
 discuss the full implications of the presidium's
 position, and to take appropriate action. In gen-
 eral, federal government organs and some republic
 governments have agreed with Tito's calls for
 stern measures.
 Student leaders, on the other hand, are
 showing no inclination to knuckle under to pres-
 sures against their opposition to constitutional
 reforms and their independent political activi-

 Soviet efforts to bring pressure on Bonn to
 change its position on the Berlin negotiations
 have recently received considerable attention in
 the West German (FRG) press.
 The press has cited as examples of these
 pressure tactics the Soviet refusal on 5 March to
 conclude a trade agreement covering West Berlin,
 and the suspension of Soviet-FRG talks on an air

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Egypt: Falling Out at the Top
 Vice President Ali Sabri raised his opposition
 to President Sadat's policies from sniping to an
 open challenge last week and got himself fired for
 his pains.
 Strains appear to have been building up for
 some time between the President and Sabri, who
 had received only a nominal office in the post-
 Nasir administration. At a meeting of the Arab
 Socialist Union (ASU) central committee on 25
 April, Sabri  intemperately questioned Sadat's
 justification and authority for agreeing to Egypt's
 entry into the Federation of Arab Republics with-
 out prior consultation with the ASU. Sadat had
 handled  the  arrangements  for the federation
 pretty much on his own for larger political rea-
 sons, apparently confident that he would receive
 pro forma approval from Egypt's political institu-
 tions, including the ASU. He was therefore vul-
 nerable to Sabri's outspoken criticism of the com-
 promises worked out with the Syrian and Libyan
 leaders and, failing to rally support from other
 ASU officials, he had to submit to some of the
 changes demanded of him. The open challenge to
 his authority required a response, however, and
 within a week Sabri was out.
 In dealing with the Sabri-ASU challenge,
 Sadat and others within the hierarchy must have
 recognized that a more basic issue between the
 two was Egypt's current effort to explore the
 possibility of a peace settlement with Israel,
 against which an ASU-based campaign has been
 operating for the past several months. A purge of
 Sabri's followers in the ASU is likely to follow in
 the near future. It is reasonably certain, however,

 that political repercussions will be largely con-
 fined to this organization, where Sabri's sup-
 porters are concentrated.
 Sadat's position has probably been strength-
 ened by removal of this vice-presidential gadfly-
 assuming that the dismissal holds, which at the
 moment seems likely. Both Sadat's supporters
 and detractors cannot but have been impressed by
 the decisiveness with which he cut down an in-
 creasingly  embarrassing  critic.  Sabri's  ouster
 leaves the other vice president, Husayn Shafii, as
 Sadat's undisputed constitutional successor.
 Assessed as a lightweight by many political
 observers when he assumed office last October,
 Sadat now seems to be exercising leadership with
 an increasingly firm hand. When he moved against
 Sabri, Sadat was no doubt confident of the sup-
 port of both the army and Minister of Interior
 Goma, who controls the security apparatus and is
 one of the three or four key figures in the regime.
 Sabri's prominent identification with the
 Soviet Union is an embarrassment for Moscow,
 particularly in view of the coincidence of Sabri's
 dismissal with Secretary Rogers' visit to Cairo this
 week.
 The Soviets
 Lpro ably recognize the cha lenge orTered to Sadat
 by Sabri and by the ASU politicians as being out
 of bounds, although this will not greatly mitigate
 their discomfiture. Moscow is already nervous
 about ongoing US-Egyptian contacts. The dis-
 missal of Sabri, and presumably his principal fol-
 lowers in the ASU, will probably sharpen Soviet
 apprehensions about the direction of current
 Egyptian policy and prompt Moscow to seek fur-
 ther reassurances from Cairo. Over the longer
 term, Sabri's ouster is unlikely to do much dam-
 age to Soviet-Egyptian relations. Soviet fortunes
 in Egypt do not rise and fall with one man. The
 commitments that Moscow has made to Cairo
 ensure it a continuing position of substantial in-
 fluence.
 Sadat's May Day Speech
 The lengthy and elaborate praise of the So-
 viet Union in Sadat's May Day speech may have
 been yet another attempt to assure Moscow that
 there were no anti-Soviet implications in Sabri's
 dismissal. Sadat's forthright defense of the federa-
 tion and of Cairo's efforts to explore the possibil-
 ity of a political settlement with Israel may be
 interpreted as a public response to Sabri and
 other critics of Sadat's policies in the ASU.
 Portions of the address relating to the sus-
 pended hostilities seem to have been intended to
 set the tone and the terms for Egypt's position
 during the talks with Secretary Rogers. With re-
 gard to reopening the Suez Canal, Sadat reiterated
 points made in his initiative of 4 February, insist-
 ing on Egypt's right to deploy its armed forces on
 the eastern bank and on a definite limit on the
 cease-fire period during which Jarring would set a
 timetable for complete Israeli withdrawal. As to
 the conditions for an over-all settlement, Sadat
 categorically rejected the demilitarization of the
 Sinai and any form of an Israeli presence at
 Sharm ash-Shaykh.
 Although the speech contained no hint of
 change in past Egyptian positions, it was notable
 for the low level of histrionics and sabre-rattling.
 Although the option of resuming hostilities was
 kept open, Sadat did not dwell on the con-
 sequences if peace discussions should fail. As
 Cairo prepared to welcome the US Secretary of
 State, Al Ahram  editorially stated the general
 Egyptian expectation that, following his visi125X1

 world and before history, about what will happen

 ISRAEL: Israel's hard  line against withdrawal

 who comfort themselves with the hope that Is-
 rael's position can be worn down, or softened by

 Commenting on Sadat's demand that Egyptian

 tive opinion in the "legislative" body. The cabi-
 net, made up primarily of incumbents of previous
 republican governments, is a balance achieved in
 behind-the-scenes  maneuvering  by  established
 power  factions.  The  prime  minister,   Ahmad
 Numan, at 71 is one of the oldest republican
 leaders as well as one of the first to rebel against
 the former royalist regime. Government policy,
 therefore, is expected to be conservative.
 The government will be challenged by prob-
 lems in five major areas: Numan's need for a good
 relationship with General al-Amri, a member of
 the three-man executive Republican Council and
 head of the army; the general economic situation,
 still aggravated by the war and the aftermath of a
 long drought; the attitude taken by the leftists
 who feel betrayed by the slow pace of the revolu-
 tion; the success (or lack of it) of the institutional
 machinery created by the new constitution; and
 finally, developments in the unpredictable state
 of Southern Yemen, now called the Peoples
 Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY).
 Yemen has become awkwardly embroiled in
 Saudi Arabia's attempt to subvert the PDRY by
 subsidizing dissidents who operate from both
 Yemen and the southern fringes of Saudi Arabia.
 Both Yemens have made efforts toward union,
 each on its own terms, but the timing has always
 been such that the political systems were irrecon-
 cilable. Yemen's current involvement in the Saudi
 Arabian effort derives from its dependence on
 Saudi aid and goodwill, but its association is
 causing it much embarrassment with the more
 radical and powerful Arab states as well as posing
 the  dangerous  possibility  of  future  military
 clashes with its southern neighbor.

 Pakistan: Fighting Subsides, Economic Problems Increase
 West Pakistani troops have taken almost all
 important towns in East Pakistan, although some
 areas are still under Bengali control and some
 fighting continues. Direct government control,
 however,  is still  limited to major population
 centers and a few other strategic points. There are
 now more than 50,000 government troops in the
 province, but they could easily be tied down by
 garrisoning and protecting what the army now
 holds. Most of the 62,000 villages are still subject
 only to indirect control through economic and
 military reprisals.
 Incidents of sabotage and ambush by the
 largely unorganized Bengali forces are likely to
 continue. With little leadership and no prov-
 ince-wide coordination, however, the Bengalis
 probably will be unable to wage a full-scale guer-
 rilla war for some time.
 and on the development of a plan to transfer
 resources on a massive scale to East Pakistan. The
 bank official noted that, in general, the Pakistani
 Government had not been aware until recently of
 the seriousness of its over-all financial situation-
 domestic finances are also in very bad shape-and
 that hopes for economic recovery were still based
 on unrealistic assumptions about making up for
 lost exports and taxes.
 Islamabad,  in one way or another, has
 managed to outrage all important aid donors
 other than Communist China. In a clarifying
 statement on its recent decision to apply a six-
 month moratorium on debt repayments, the gov-
 ernment has indicated that the moratorium will
 apply to Communist creditor nations as well as to
 official Western creditors.
 In the meantime, the government faces
 growing economic problems in both parts of the
 country and potential political problems in West
 Pakistan. Z. A. Bhutto, whose party won a ma-
 jority of the West Pakistani races in elections last
 December, has publicly warned the military gov-
 ernment against any "inordinate and unneces-
 sary" delay in transferring power to the elected
 representatives.
 A World Bank official has said that Pakistan
 needs sharply stepped-up aid from the West to
 avoid economic collapse. Islamabad has been in-
 formed, however, that any support from Western
 donors would depend on a return to normal in
 East Pakistan, on exchange and fiscal reforms,
 Economic activity is picking up in East Paki-
 stan, but the situation remains grim. Prices of all
 major commodities increased  substantially  in
 Dacca in the last week-rice by 13 percent and
 kerosene by 81 percent. Lines of communications
 remain disrupted, with only 54 percent of the rail
 network in service. On the positive side, exports
 of jute, Pakistan's main foreign-exchange earner,
 have slowly begun to get under way, and 15 of 51
 jute mills in the major urban areas are attempting
 to begin one-shift operations.
 Relations between New Delhi and Islamabad
 continue to be characterized by charges of border
 violations and diplomatic maneuvering for third-
 country support. As of 6 May, the fate of Indian
 diplomats in Dacca and Pakistani diplomats in
 Calcutta had not been settled, according to the
 Pakistanis because of "India's intransigence and
 inability to fulfill the assurances given Pakistan."

 Peking Courts Turkey and Iran
 Communist China's campaign to expand its
 diplomatic contacts world-wide and to win votes
 for admission to the UN is gaining ground in
 Turkey and Iran.
 Direct Sino-Turkish talks on establishing dip-
 lomatic relations started in Paris around 22 April.
 The Turkish foreign minister has pre icte  tat
 the talks will take a long time, but the Chinese
 undoubtedly are eager to gain recognition before
 the next session of the UN, and may continue to
 demonstrate the flexibility concerning recogni-
 tion formulas that they exhibited recently in
 establishing relations with Kuwait and Cameroon.
 Iran's interest in establishing diplomatic ties
 with Peking became obvious with the recent visit
 to China of the Shah's twin sister, Princess
 Ashraf, and the Shah's remarks to Japanese and
 Egyptian newsmen indicating that Iran was study-
 ing the question of recognition. Princess Ashraf
 has left little doubt that she will recommend
 diplomatic relations. Teheran has followed up her
 visit with one by the Shah's half sister, Princess
 Fatimah, who arrived in China on 29 April. Dur-
 ing a banquet in her honor in Peking the next
 day, Premier Chou En-lai remarked that friendly
 Chinese-Iranian relations had "begun to be re-
 established."
 Both Turkey and Iran regard` Communist
 China as a possible balancing factor in their
 relations with the Soviet Union and they are
 unlikely to be overly concerned about the possi-
 ble effects of recognition on issues at the United
 Nations. The Turks also reportedly believe that
 recognizing Peking would gain them the potential
 support of Peking and its friends for Turkey's
 position on Cyprus, which would be eventually
 translated into support at the UN on the issue.
 Despite statements by Iranian and Turkish
 spokesmen that their governments wish to
 preserve their relations with Chiang K'ai-shek's
 regime on Taiwan, both Teheran and Ankara
 probably are counting on Chiang's breaking off
 relations with governments recognizing Com-
 munist China to save them from the potential
 diplomatic embarrassment of publicly forcing the
 Nationalists to leave.
 Recognition by Turkey and Iran will in-
 crease pressure on other Middle Eastern govern-
 ments to follow suit. Lebanese leaders apparently
 would prefer to put off an early decision, but
 Beirut's foreign minister recently revealed that
 recognition of Communist China by Kuwait had
 already increased internal pressure for Lebanon to
 make a similar move. Pressure on Libya, which is
 attempting to build an image as a "liberated"
 Arab state, may also increase.

 Turkey: Military Grip Tightens
 In the two weeks since the new government
 invoked limited martial law, the military has sig-
 nificantly tightened its grip over major trouble
 centers, particularly Ankara and Istanbul. The
 restrictions  have  been  applied  primarily  to
 extremists, however, and inconvenience to the
 public has been kept to a minimum. As the do-
 mestic security situation has improved there has
 been a perceptible growth of public confidence
 and optimism.
 in their crackdown on both the left and
 right, the martial law authorities have banned
 several newspapers and have arrested over 200
 persons, including at least 25 military students
 ,ind junior officers. In Ankara alone more than 20
 student organizations have been banned. All labor
 strikes and lockouts are forbidden. At the same
 time, many schools and universities are being
 reopened and, for the first time in several years,
 students are able to take their spring examina-
 tions in a peaceful atmosphere.
 Military leaders are also inspecting Kurdish
 areas where unrest has been reported. Raids in
 Kurdish villages in eastern Turkey are said to have
 uncovered substantial quantities of arms, am-
 munition, and explosives, but the threat of a
 Kurdish separatist movement appears to be exag-
 gerated. In parliament, a new and tougher martial
 'aw bill being processed will substantially increase
 the powers of search, seizure, arrest, and trial.
 Despite martial law, sporadic violence con-
 tinues. Six explosions occurred in Ankara in a
 single night. On 3 May a bomb thrown from a
 moving train in Istanbul injured four and en-
 dangered the lives of over 1,300 visiting business-
 men, most of them foreign nationals.

 law will be extended beyond the initial 30-day

 Cyprus: Intercommunal Talks Still Flounder
 Intercommunal talks, stalemated for several
 months, recently hit a new low, brought about
 this time by Greek Cypriot statements favoring
 "enosis" (union with Greece) and the deliberate
 Turkish omission of the word "provisional" in
 referring to the Turkish Cypriot Provisional
 Administration. Nevertheless, neither the Greek
 nor Turkish Cypriots appear willing to bear the
 onus for ending the talks that were reopened on
 28 April. Moreover, Ankara and Athens, not
 wanting to risk another clash over Cyprus, have
 encouraged both sides to continue meeting.
 Turkish Cypriot negotiator Rauf Denktash,
 after consultations with Ankara, on 28 April re-
 stated the Turkish Cypriot position on the whole
 range of constitutional issues that have occupied
 the talks for almost three years. The most striking
 aspect of the Denktash proposal is the insistence
 on  local  autonomy provisions that, if imple-
 mented, would essentially give the Turkish
 Cypriot minority a more separate and equal
 partnership than that granted under the 1960
 constitution.
 Although Denktash did not press for any
 preconditions for further negotiations, his Greek
 Cypriot counterpart, Glafkos Clerides, believes
 Denktash's proposal is unyielding in substance
 and doubts that continued discussions will be
 useful. Clerides maintains that the Denktash
 proposal highlights the basic difference in the
 fundamental approach to the problem by the two
 sides: a unified government on the island as op-
 posed to two communal administrations. He
 added that a meeting in Athens will be necessary
 before the Makarios government can decide on its
 reaction to the Denktash proposal. Such a Greek -
 Greek Cypriot discussion probably cannot be held
 before 17 May when the next intercommunal
 meeting is scheduled.
 The Turkish Cypriots, on the other hand, are
 more self-confident because of reinforced backing
 from the new Erim government in Ankara. Erim
 has indicated that Turkey is frustrated over the
 lack of progress in the intercommunal talks. He
 said he wanted direct talks with Greece on the
 problem, but admitted that, in the absence of
 adequate preparations, such discussions are not
 possible at this time. Nevertheless, Erim agrees
 that until a satisfactory compromise solution to
 the Cypriot stalemate can be found, the com-
 munal talks must continue in order to maintain a
 climate of good relations between Athens and

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 May Day in Latin America
 May Day events in Latin America were on a
 larger scale, more demonstrative, and more nu-
 merous than in many years. Leaders of at least
 eight countries addressed large crowds. Parades
 and demonstrations with nationalistic themes oc-
 curred in about a dozen countries, but there was
 little violence.
 President Allende shared the rostrum in San-
 tiago with Chilean Cardinal Silva, the Cuban and
 Soviet ambassadors, and other dignitaries, but
 Fidel Castro stayed at home and addressed a rally
 in Havana. Allende's speech was moderate and
 cautious. With only minor exceptions he es-
 chewed  "anti-imperialist"  rhetoric  and  em-
 phasized his administration's desires for a "hu-
 mane revolution."
 In Bolivia, President Torres did not speak,
 but he marched in a massive parade in La Paz
 with more than 15,000 workers and students.
 There was no violence, however, probably be-
 cause Torres had anticipated leftist demands by
 canceling the concession of a US-owned mining
 company the day before.
 Guyana's Prime Minister Burnham marched
 with workers in the capital, and in response to
 criticism from the crowd, he delivered an angry
 speech. In a mining center in the interior, workers
 successfully defied the government's efforts to
 ban what became the largest May Day parade on
 record there.
 General Torrijos of Panama delivered a
 lengthy address to a sizable crowd in a provincial
 town, and parades and demonstrations with gov-
 ernment backing occurred in major cities. In his
 most quoted remark, Torrijos said that he and the
 Panamanian Government would enter into nego-
 tiations about the Panama Canal "on our feet or
 dead, but never on our knees."
 President Figueres of Costa Rica delivered
 his state of the union speech in San Jose follow-
 ing the largest May Day parade in recent years.
 President Lanusse was the first military ruler of
 Argentina since Juan Peron to address a May Day
 crowd. He spoke at the inauguration of a new na-
 tional university and discussed some of his pro-
 grams that are designed to return Argentina to
 constitutional rule. Brazilian President Medici an-
 nounced an increase in the minimum wage, which
 he said was consistent with his goal of improving
 the lot of the workers. Venezuelan President Cal-

 Cuba:  Castro Reasserts His Leadership-
 Fidel Castro is showing signs of resuming the
 vigorous style of leadership that he abandoned in
 mid-1970. His recent spate of speeches-five in
 two weeks-suggests that he is rapidly regaining
 the confidence that was shaken by last year's eco-
 nomic setbacks. His launching of a strident cam-
 paign against intellectuals, too, is reminiscent of
 his aggressive reaction to past challenges. In addi-
 tion, the newly announced housing construction
 plan contains the same overoptimism charac-
 teristic of his previous economic schemes.
 Cuban intellectuals, in particular, are in for
 trouble. Reacting to events related directly to the
 recent arrest of poet Heberto Padilla in Havana,
 Castro delivered a vehement denunciation of in-
 tellectuals and "cultural colonialism" in a major
 speech on 30 April at the closing session of the

 national congress on education and culture. He
 gave a severe tongue-lashing to European and
 Latin American writers and artists who leaped to
 Padilla's defense and also criticized the wasting of
 precious resources on "useless, decadent books"
 written by a "privileged minority" in Cuba. Al-
 though Castro characterized dissident intellectuals
 at home as only "two or three stray sheep" who
 want to "continue to sow poison, insidiousness,
 and intrigue in the revolution," it is clear that
 intellectual ferment is much more widespread.
 Castro's pronouncements are a forewarning that
 the "small group that has monopolized the title
 of 'intellectual' " will find the publication of its
 works impossible unless it adheres to the political
 guidelines demanded by the regime.
 . The congress' final resolution reflected much
 of Castro's antipathy toward writers and artists
 and also indicated the regime's concern with the
 impact on Cuban youth of such foreign cultural
 influences as "extravagant fashions, religion, and
 moral and sexual deformations...." Although it
 stated that "neither religion nor homosexualism is
 an important obstacle to the development of
 Cuban youth," the resolution proposed a plan "to
 prevent religious sects from proselytizing and
 making new converts" and specified the "socially
 pathological nature of homosexuality...."
 Castro's new moves against intellectuals
 could affect directly Haydee Santmaria, the gov-
 ernment official responsible for inviting foreigners
 to participate in Cuban literary competitions;
 these have been a special target of Castro's wrath.
 She is a member of the central committee of the
 Communist Party and has been a faithful follower
 of Fidel since the early years of the revolution.
 Castro's May Day speech was directed more
 toward economic themes. Although he now seems
 to have adopted a long-term view regarding the
 achievement of significant material benefits, he
 apparently has retained his penchant for overesti-
 mating the productive capacity of the people. I n
 his May Day speech, for example, he revealed
 plans for a schedule of house construction that
 calls for 100,000 homes a year by 1975. Castro
 may be using this as a device to buy time in the
 face of a steadily worsening housing shortage, but
 he could wind up in much the same position in
 which the unfulfilled commitment to produce ten
 million tons of sugar in 1970 placed him. Such a
 monumental building program is doomed to fail-
 ure if, as Castro maintains, it must be carried out
 by underemployed workers and without a major
 diversion of resources of the construction indus-
 try.

 Central American Common Market: Another Try to Save It
 Diplomats from El Salvador and Honduras
 are preparing for what may be the final attempt
 this year to normalize their relations and repair
 the damage done to the Central American Com-
 mon Market by their war in July 1969. Having
 agreed at last month's OAS General Assembly to
 discuss all outstanding issues, both sides are draw-
 ing up position papers for presentation at a bi-
 lateral meeting scheduled for 20 May.
 Previous attempts to resolve bilateral prob-
 lems have floundered because neither side was
 willing to address the subject of greatest impor-
 tance to the other. Thus, El Salvador has placed
 primary emphasis on ending Honduran blockage
 of the Pan American Highway to Salvadoran traf-
 fic, while Honduras has insisted on discussion of
 the border dispute as a precondition to negotia-
 tion of any other issue.
 Common Market talks have thus far proven
 equally fruitless. Honduras, believing it has bene-
 fited least from Common Market membership,
 has demanded that the other member states give
 special assistance to its industrial development.
 Moreover, concerned about its deficit position in
 G uyana: End of Bauxite Strike?
 The 13-day wildcat strike by workers of the
 Demerara Bauxite Company (DEMBA) ended on
 3 May, relieving the Burnham government, at
 least temporarily, of the most pressing of several
 related problems confronting it. If Burnham dis-
 appoints the workers' expectations, the strike
 could resume, costing the government public con-
 fidence and provoking more problems that the
 political opposition could exploit.
 During the strike, the workers

 of-payments problems, Honduras has refused to
 participate in the market until corrective steps are
 taken to end these imbalances. El Salvador, how-
 ever, has blocked such concessions and is unlikely
 to change its position until it can achieve some of
 its political objectives. In order to end the im-
 passe, the current negotiating effort will attempt
 to arrange a package deal incorporating trade-offs
 on bilateral and Common Market issues.
 Although there have recently been some bor-
 der incidents, and hard-line elements in both
 countries will continue to oppose any com-
 promise, there exists at present a particularly fav-
 orable negotiating climate. President-elect Cruz of
 Honduras has taken an active interest in the prob-
 lem and would like to begin his administration
 having resolved his country's major foreign policy
 problems. The Salvadorans realize the urgency of

 preparations for the 1972 elections will reduce

 advantage of the strike. Neither was notably suc-
 cessful but there were side effects that may prove
 troublesome to Burnham in the future. One was
 ASCRIA's departure from its usual go-it-alone
 policy, soliciting the cooperation of other mili-
 tant groups, including the youth arm of the pre-
 dominantly East Indian PPP, on issues ostensibly
 unrelated to labor unrest. Although these joint
 efforts were unimpressive, a precedent has been
 set. Another development was Jagan's meetings
 with the bauxite strikers and with civil service
 organizations that chose this time to push their
 long-neglected wage demands. The US Embassy
 believes, however, that consultation and public
 cooperation by ASCRIA and the civil servants
 with Jagan was only a tactic to put pressure on
 the government and that Jagan's political pros-
 pects probably have not been appreciably en-
 hanced.
 The government appears to have played its
 hand rather clumsily during the strike. Burnham
 first affected a lack of concern about the stop-
 page and blamed DEMBA and its parent com-
 pany, the Aluminum Company of Canada, for
 fomenting it. Then, probably because ASCRIA's
 influence is generally believed to be strong among
 the bauxite workers, he sent Eusi Kwayana,
 ASCRIA's Presiding Elder, to talk to the strikers.
 Kwayana failed to persuade them, probably be-
 cause the issues are primarily a labor matter and
 the strikers did not want the dispute politicized.
 The Burnham government may find itself
 subjected to a heavy though probably not fatal
 combination of pressures if the strike is resumed.
 The opposition is presumably constrained by the
 overriding importance of the successful national-
 ization of DEMBA, but Burnham's unimpressive
 recent performance cannot have been lost on the
 public generally or on the opposition particu-
 larly.
 Colombia Has a "New" Party
 Former dictator Rojas Pinilla announced on
 19 April that his National Popular Alliance
 (ANAPO) has become a political party. The deci-
 sion to formalize ANAPO's status was based on
 the belief that the new voting generation and the
 lower class urbanites are no longer attached to the
 traditionally oriented Liberal and Conservative
 parties and that ANAPO, as a party, would thus
 attract them.
 The  1970  general  elections,  in  which
 ANAPO took part as a faction of the Conservative
 party, showed that the traditional strength of the
 Liberals and Conservatives had greatly eroded and
 that ANAPO appeared to have inherited much of
 their former support, particularly among low-in-
 come groups. This development springs from
 causes within the political groupings themselves
 and society as a whole. The bonds connecting the
 two major parties with their mass following have
 deteriorated because of factors such as immigra-
 tion from the countryside, growth of cities, the
 breakdown of traditional institutions, and a grow-
 ing concern over socioeconomic issues. The ap-
 peal to low-income Colombians is based, in con-
 siderable measure, on ANAPO's demagogic op-
 position to the "establishment" and to the Na-
 tional Front that has governed the country since
 1958. This system is scheduled to end in 1974.
 The vote that ANAPO received in 1970, however,
 may have been a transitory phenomenon. Some
 former adherents of the traditional parties voted
 for Rojas Pinilla more because they were dissatis-
 fied with their own parties' candidates than be-
 cause they were attracted to Rojas.
 The "new" party will formally proclaim it-
 self on 13 June and will also issue its platform at

 that time.
 ANAPO is portraying itself as the party
 of the exploited, but it will have to overcome
 many internal difficulties before it becomes a
 strong and  viable  political  organization. The
 unification of its disparate elements into a
 party structure will be difficult and these ef-
 forts are already coming under fire from party
 stalwarts. The platform itself and the final se-
 lection of a standard bearer for 1974 will also
 present difficulties, and there is a considerable
 lack of secondary leadership.
 General Rojas, at 71, is the central figure in
 ANAPO and he is the party's one unifying ele-
 ment. His death or illness would greatly hamper
 resolution of these difficult issues. When Rojas
 dies-his many illnesses appear to be under con-
 trol for the moment-it would fall to his daugh-
 ter, Maria Eugenia Rojas de Moreno, to maintain
 the solidarity of the movement. This will be a
 difficult task at best and next to impossible if she
 persists with her presidential ambitions. In such a
 situation the movement could fragment, thereby
 seriously damaging its chances for the future.
 Much will depend on the Liberal and Conservative
 parties. Both are currently undergoing schisms,
 but if these are resolved and one or both of them
 adopt positions more responsive to the genuine
 popular pressures for social and economic re-
 forms, then ANAPO would be undercut and
 would probably lose much of its apparent
 strength.
