 The Social Democratic-Liberal
 Alliance: Breaking the Mold
 of British Politics?
 Key Judgments The fledgling Social Democratic-Liberal Alliance is aiming to capture the
 Information available middle ground from Prime Minister Thatcher's Conservatives and the
 as of 23 May 1983 increasingly leftist Laborites in the British general election on 9 June. We
 was used in this report.
 believe that problems of internal leadership rivalries and policy differences
 and a slim campaign budget will keep the Alliance from breaking through
 to national power. There is an outside chance, however, that the Alliance
 could prevent either traditional party from winning a majority and. thus
 emerge with the balance of power in the next Parliament.
 The Alliance's electoral support has fluctuated considerably in the polls,
 from a high of 50 percent in December 1981 to its current low of l7 per-
 cent. Even if the Alliance increased its momentum and captured about a
 third of the vote-probably the most it can hope for-it almost certainly
 would not gain a third of the seats in Parliament. Under the British
 electoral system, the parliamentary seat in each district goes to the
 candidate who wins a plurality-a practice that works against the Alliance,
 because its support, unlike that of the Labor and Conservative parties, is
 spread out thinly across the country. Nevertheless, depending on how
 evenly the vote divides between Labor and the Tories, 30 percent for the
 Alliance could yield sufficient seats to prevent the other parties from
 winning a majority.
 If the Tories or Labor sought Alliance support in forming a minority
 government, the Alliance would attempt to extract some concessions
 designed to moderate the policies of the larger party. The Alliance
 probably would not demand (or be offered) a coalition arrangement with
 the other parties, but would bargain for policy compromises-especially
 electoral reform to implement proportional representation-in exchange
 for its parliamentary support. We believe that once Alliance leaders
 entered a partnership with one of the major parties they would hesitate to
 press their positions too hard, however, because they would be leery of
 provoking an early election before rebuilding the party's finances. The
 Alliance probably would still be in a position to encourage job creation and
 slightly more expansionist monetary policies under a Tory government or
 to soften the unilateralist defense policies and isolationist economic policies
 that would evolve under a Labor government. The Alliance has said it
 could support either major party, but its positions on such issues as the EC,
 the economy and-to a lesser extent-defense probably would make it
 somewhat easier for the Alliance to work with the Tories than with Labor.

 British relations with the United States and other Western allies undoubt-
 edly would suffer under a minority government since it would be unstable,
 possibly of short duration, and London's ability to meet its obligations
 would be less certain. To accommodate Alliance reservations, a minority
 Tory government ruling with Alliance support might delay INF basing or
 the purchase of Trident. Conversely, however, NATO and the West would
 be better off with a Labor minority government, no matter how unstable,
 than with a Labor majority. The right wing of the Labor party probably
 would use Alliance support as an excuse to avoid implementing unilateral
 nuclear disarmament and a pullout from the European Community.
 The Alliance has managed to throw a serious scare into both traditional
 parties. Its success to date points out that over the long term, the increased
 polarization of British politics and the growing swing vote that is evolving
 with the decline in support for both the Labor and Conservative parties
 probably will provide ample opportunity for a moderate middle-of-the-road
 party.

 The Social Democratic-Liberal
 Alliance: Breaking the Mold
 of British Politics?
 In late 1980 and early 1981, a group of Labor Party
 notables made public their deep unhappiness with
 their party's swing to the left. In particular, the group
 publicly declared it would not support unilateral
 nuclear disarmament, leaving the European Commu-
 nity, or changes giving the Labor left wing more say
 in choosing the party leader. Encouraged by the
 positive public response to its proposals, the so-called
 Gang of Four-Shirley Williams, David Owen, Wil-
 liam Rodgers, and Roy Jenkins-formally launched
 the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in March 1981. In
 total, 13 Members of Parliament from the Labor
 Party and one from the Conservative Party moved to
 the SDP, making it immediately the third largest
 party in Parliament. Allied with neither big business
 nor with the labor unions, SDP leaders indicated they
 were interested in attracting the "moderate main-
 stream" by rejecting the class basis for parties-"the
 board room versus the trade unions"-and by steering
 a path between the two.
 The SDP got off to a heady start,' initially attracting
 500 to 1,000 members per week according to press
 reports. A poll of 4,000 SDP members at the First
 Party Congress in October indicated that more than
 two-thirds were professionals, managers, teachers,
 civil servants, or self-employed businessmen. More
 than half of the delegates had no previous political
 affiliation, less than 7 percent were former Tories,
 and just over 30 percent had left the Labor Party. The
 rank and file was also determinedly democratic, as it
 demonstrated at the SDP constitutional conference in
 February 1982 when the floor favored a one-man,
 one-vote selection of the party leader by all party
 members as a way of distinguishing the SDP from the
 old parties. In midyear, the SDP elected Roy Jenkins
 as leader in the first-ever postal ballot by any British
 party.

 Before the SDP was a month old, Liberal Party leader
 David Steel had agreed with the four collective SDP
 leaders to form an electoral Alliance. The Liberal
 membership dragged its feet a bit, afraid of being
 swamped by the new "pop-star" SDP, according to
 press and Embassy reporting.' Ultimately, however,
 the Liberal conference approved Steel's overture.
 Embassy reporting indicates the Liberals thought the
 SDP could help their cause by providing government
 experience gained in Labor cabinets and attracting
 more working class votes.
 'The US Embassy in Lisbon reported that a large Liberal Party
 delegation, in an unusual move for a British party, even visited
 Portugal to ask the advice of Portuguese Social Democrats on how
 the Liberals could hold their own in the proposed coalition.

 The Liberal Party, whose antecedents date back to
 the Whigs, was supplanted in the 1920s by Labor as
 one of the two major parties in British politics. Its
 share of the vote in recent years has hovered between
 10 and 20 percent, and in 1979 it elected only 11
 Members of Parliament. Nevertheless, the SDP lead-
 ership probably considered Liberal participation
 nearly indispensable in its effort to establish a centrist
 party. Although Liberal strength is higher on the
 Celtic fringes of Scotland and Wales, the party has a
 significant following elsewhere and a nationwide or-
 ganizational structure. Ideologically, the Liberal
 Party maintains a resolutely classless approach (al-
 though most members come from the middle class),
 which complements the ideas of the new-born SDP.
 Association with the Liberal Party has its drawbacks,
 however, since the public has long viewed a vote for it
 as a throwaway, and it has had trouble fielding
 credible candidates and raising money.'
 Although the Embassy reports the two parties saw
 themselves as complementary at the outset, the effort
 to find common platform positions has not been easy.
 Each side has been fearful of a "takeover" by the
 other and each at times has maintained a separate
 policy line while agreeing to a joint program. If the
 Alliance can generate renewed interest in the polls,
 however, we believe it can probably pull together
 during the campaign in the interest of gaining power.
 Perhaps the most divisive policy issue has been disar-
 mament. Since 1981 the Liberal rank and file has
 voted at its annual conventions in favor of unilateral
 disarmament. At its last national meeting in Septem-
 ber 1982 the party called for a "phaseout of the
 ' The Times has described the Liberal party, a little maliciously, as
 "a curious cross section of historical, geographic, and sociological
 strata. At the bottom, heavily submerged, are a few Whig grandees.
 Above them lie the remnants of the 19th century Liberal tradi-
 tion-middle class, libertarian, nonconformist, high minded, but by
 no means as free market orientated as (you might) expect. Then
 there is a thick layer of discontented lower middle-class refugees
 from conservatism-what might be called the Poujadist element.
 Next come ... radical idealists from the 1960s, preaching commu-
 nity politics, federalism, and devolution. Finally, as a top sprinkling,
 there are the new radicals of the past five years-all ecological
 purity and antinuclear enthusiasm. This rather ill-assorted alliance
 has naturally had considerable difficulty in getting its act
 together."
 Polaris force as soon as possible" and came out
 against "the deployment of cruise missiles" in the
 United Kingdom. In contrast, the SDP policymaking
 body-the 400-strong Council for Social Democ-
 racy-voted decisively in January against canceling
 the deployment of cruise missiles and recommended
 that Parliament make the ultimate decision on de-
 ployment in light of progress in the Geneva
 negotiations.
 The two parties' positions have been reconciled only
 because Liberal leader Steel has openly ignored his
 party's sentiment on this issue and essentially ac-
 cepted the SDP position. According to press reports,
 Steel believes that nuclear defense issues will be of
 key importance in the election campaign and thinks
 that the Alliance can capitalize on the rift between
 Tory and Labor to capture the middle ground. As
 long as Steel sees it as beneficial, therefore, we believe
 he will continue to ignore dissent in his own party and
 work with the SDP multilateralists.
 Choosing a Prime Minister-designate also continues
 to raise hackles. The Alliance never got around.
 formally to choosing a leader, but Jenkins tacitly
 assumed the role. Jenkins had both cabinet experience
 and the aura of international statesman from his stint
 as EC Commission president. The Liberals began to
 have second thoughts about Jenkins, however, as
 Thatcher recaptured the limelight and the Alliance
 plummeted in the polls after the Falklands campaign.
 Jenkins was not effective in Parliament, and Embassy
 reporting indicates that the Liberals now believe
 Steel-who leads all British leaders in polling popu-
 larity-should be named Prime Minister-designate of
 the Alliance despite his lack of government experi-
 ence. A compromise was announced in late April
 whereby Steel would head the Alliance election cam-
 paign and Jenkins would be named the Alliance
 candidate for Prime Minister. Although the compro-
 mise has not satisfied everyone, we think it will help
 limit interparty squabbling during the campaign.

 Alliance unity is most severely tried, however, over
 the splitting of constituencies. Liberals were vocally
 unhappy that in about half the contests for the
 general election their candidates-some of whom had
 worked for years to build up a following-were told to
 step aside in favor of Johnny-come-lately Social Dem-
 ocratic candidates. Some Liberals refused to stand
 down even when Steel said he would endorse the SDP
 candidate in their stead, and in the Darlington byelec-
 tion in March about 25 percent of Liberal voters did
 not cast their votes for the SDP Alliance candidate.
 Social Democrats, for their part, have complained
 publicly over the number of winnable seats their party
 was allocated. A study done last November by three
 Oxford University professors shows that the Liberals
 were given eight of the nine "safest" seats and 13 of
 the top 20. According to the study, some of the Gang
 of Four might even lose their seats in the June
 election. Another survey conducted in April by two
 British political scientists contradicts the earlier find-
 ings, however, and suggests that the SDP could win as
 many seats as the Liberals. The SDP grievance has
 probably been held too long now for this newer study
 to have much of a mollifying effect.
 Both sides have had to moderate individual party
 stances in order to effect a joint Alliance program.
 The Alliance manifesto, published on 13 May, in-
 cludes some careful wording to minimize differences
 in contentious areas, especially defense. In other
 areas, the manifesto calls for cutting the unemploy-
 ment rate through public investment and tax cuts,
 joining the European Monetary System, expanding
 UK regional and social activities in the European
 Community, and electoral reform to institute propor-
 tional representation.
 Defense
 Defense policy leans heavily toward the SDP position
 but makes some bows to the Liberals. According to
 the manifesto, the Alliance approves of multilateral
 disarmament and cancellation of Trident. Any deci-
 sion on INF basing would be delayed both until the
 Geneva talks conclude and until there is a dual key
 agreement guaranteeing that the missiles would not
 be fired without UK consent. Polaris would be in-
 cluded in the Geneva talks. Differences of opinion
 over whether this means that Polaris would be as-
 signed to NATO control and not be used "indepen-
 dently" by the United Kingdom-as the press reports
 Liberal leader Steel would prefer-or whether the
 British Government would retain control-as the
 press reports SDP defense spokesman Owen prefers-
 have apparently been swept under the rug.
 Economic Positions
 An Alliance government would not only maintain EC
 membership, but would make Britain a full member
 of the European Monetary System. In the domestic
 arena, the manifesto proposes a middle-of-the-road
 economic program that emphasizes public investment,
 tax cuts, and schemes to cut unemployment by 1 mil-
 lion over two years. Public sector borrowing would
 rise, and there are proposals to encourage industrial
 democracy, limit pay and price increases, and provide
 more government aid to children, pensioners, unem-
 ployed, and the disabled.
 When most of these same economic policies were first
 proposed in a March position paper, at least one
 newspaper, The Guardian, endorsed them as having
 "a better chance of shrinking the dole queues than
 any other in the arena." Many of the job creation
 ideas had already been espoused by the Tory left
 wing, leading the Financial Times to note that much
 of the economic program appeared designed as a
 prospectus for partnership with the Tories if the
 election failed to return a clear majority.

 Parliamentary Reform
 Another aspect of government reform touches on the
 House of Lords. Jenkins espoused a long-held Liberal
 policy last year when he stated in a press conference
 that he would end participation by hereditary peers
 and take away the voting rights of life peers. The new
 second chamber would have members elected by the
 regional assemblies and be able to delay for up to two
 years any government bills except for financial meas-
 ures. This latter reform is unlikely to go far, even
 should the Alliance gain a voice in government.
 Carping about the Lords has been endemic for years,
 but we believe there is no strong support among the
 tradition-conscious Britons for changing its role so
 drastically. Perhaps more importantly, the present
 House of Lords is unlikely to acquiesce in such a
 revision and could retaliate by holding up most of an
 Alliance government's legislation until the plans are
 dropped.
 The issue to which both parties are most committed is
 proportional representation, and this is the one both
 claim they will hold out for if the Alliance holds the
 balance of power after the election. Alliance solidarity
 on this issue stems from the dissatisfaction of all small
 parties with the electoral system's awarding of parlia-
 mentary seats to the candidates winning pluralities in
 their districts. Traditionally the system favors the
 large parties and works against small parties whose
 support is spread evenly across the country. Under
 proportional representation, majority government
 could become a thing of the past even if current voting
 patterns remain stable, and with the encouragement
 that such a system would grant to third parties, voting
 patterns probably would change markedly over the
 longer term. While we believe the Alliance would be
 unable to obtain anything better than a promise of
 some kind of referendum on the subject, this might be
 enough to garner its support, especially since the SDP
 and the Liberals are both anxious to participate in
 government.

 undercurrent of public dissatisfaction with the two
 major parties-not yet apparent in the polls-that
 will translate into Alliance votes on election day.
 Support for the two traditional parties has eroded over
 the last 30 years, creating a volatile swing vote on
 which the Alliance is pinning its hopes. At the other
 extreme, Alliance members could find they do little
 better than did the Liberals in the general election in
 1979, when they won 13.8 percent of the popular vote
 but only 1.7 percent (11 seats) of the 635 seats in the
 House of Commons. In this worst case, the Alliance
 could find itself disintegrating in frustration.'
 ' The Alliance will not be the only small party that could provide
 support in the case of a hung Parliament. Ulster Unionists will
 probably win about 12 seats and would probably be the first party
 that the Conservatives would try to deal with if they are only a few
 seats short of a majority. Since neither major party is anxious to
 encourage Alliance aspirations, the Alliance would almost have to
 come in a strong third before it was approached for support.
 We believe that the Alliance at best has an outside
 chance of winning enough contests to deny an abso-
 lute majority to Labor or the Tories. This slim
 prospect rests on the possibility that there is a large

 British Parties'

 from 15-20 percent over this time period.

 It is still unclear how much electoral support the
 Alliance will command, however, especially since the
 polls reveal considerable fickleness in voter prefer-
 ence. After peaking at a remarkable 50 percent in the
 Gallup poll taken during December 1981, the Alli-
 ance slid to about 20 percent in mid-1982 following
 the Falklands war before climbing back to a second
 place 30 to 34 percent, ahead of Labor, early this
 spring. More recent polls reflect support for the
 Alliance at below 20 percent, a drop it can ill afford.
 The Alliance needs to regain momentum in order to
 appear an attractive option for disaffected voters
 during the election and not just a between-elections
 "event."
 Should the Alliance regain lost ground and capture as
 much as a third of the vote, it would gain less than a
 third of the parliamentary seats. According to politi-
 cal scientist Ivor Crewe, a vote that runs between 25
 and 30 percent and is spread evenly across constituen-
 cies, as is the Alliance's, would gain the Alliance few
 victories under the plurality electoral system. He
 calculated in the June/July issue of Public Opinion
 Performance at Bermondsey and Darlington
 The Alliance's stunning upset win in the Bermondsey
 byelection on 24 February has worried the traditional
 parties. Bermondsey had been a safe Labor seat for
 generations, but a combination of Labor inf'ighiing-
 there were two Labor candidates running against each
 other-and long-held antipathy for the Tories fn the
 constituency swung the election to the Liberal candi-
 date of the Alliance. When the dust settled, the
 Alliance had changed an 11,700 vote Labor majority
 in 1979 to a 9,300 vote Liberal majority, a fear` that
 required an almost unprecedented 44 percent swing in
 the vote.
 Election analysts have dwelt at length on the "tacti-
 cal voting" that seemed to help the Alliance in
 Bermondsey. Three quarters of the small Tory con-
 tingent voted for the Alliance candidate as the one
 who seemed to have the better chance, while half of
 the Labor voters, their loyalties split, did the same.
 This trend has buoyed Alliance hopes, and SDP
 president Shirley Williams predicts that supposedly
 safe Tory or Labor seats may be as vulnerable as
 marginal ones. We believe these conditions are un-
 likely to develop very often, however, during the
 national election.
 The Alliance euphoria following Bermondsey was
 followed by a drastic letdown the following month in
 the Darlington byelection. Although the SDP candi-
 date began the campaign the oddsmakers'favorite, he
 finished third, while the Labor candidate actually
 increased Labor's winning vote total over the 1979
 results. Moreover, with the Tory candidate only
 2,400 votes behind Labor, Darlington has provided
 the Tory campaign with a readymade warning that to
 vote for the Alliance is to throw the election to Labor.
 that it would capture only 30 to 35 seats out of the
 635 in the present Parliament.' According to Crewe,
 the Alliance would begin to win significant numbers

 Approved For Release 2008/08/19: CIA-RDP84SO0555R000200070003-2
 of seats only if it gained more than 34 percent of the
 vote. Above 37 percent, the Alliance would be the
 second-largest party in Parliament; higher than 39
 percent, it could gain a plurality and have a chance at
 forming the government.
 According to their own projections, Alliance strate-
 gists think they could take anywhere from 50 to 100
 seats in the next Parliament if they can win Labor
 votes in the south where the Conservatives dominate.
 A bloc of 100 seats for the Alliance would almost
 guarantee a hung Parliament and give the Alliance
 the balance of power. Such a large number of seats
 going to the Alliance seems highly unlikely at this
 point, since it implies about 35 percent of the popular
 vote. It is not totally out of the question, however,
 given the recent volatility of the British electorate.
 Capturing close to 50 seats in Parliament-around 30
 percent of the vote according to Crewe's study-
 might still be enough to steal a majority from the
 traditional parties and give the Alliance influence
 over government policies-depending on the vote
 spread between the Tories and Labor.
 If the Alliance did obtain enough seats to hold the
 balance of power, it would probably not join a coali-
 tion but would simply negotiate for policy concessions
 in return for its support. It is not in the British
 tradition to form coalition governments, and both
 Thatcher and Foot have already made press state-
 ments ruling out this option. The Alliance leaders
 have told the press that they would be willing to work
 with either a Labor or Conservative minority
 government.
 If the next election results in a hung Parliament with
 the Alliance holding the balance of power, British
 relations with the United States and other EC or
 NATO partners will become unsettled, because such
 a government probably would be unstable and might
 last only one to two years. In trying to press its views
 on the governing party, however, we believe the
 Alliance would be unwilling to push any issue to the
 point of rupture, especially in the early months. As
 the weaker partner (and the poorest party financially)
 the Alliance would be leery of forcing a new election,
 which could be run "on its back." Therefore, it would
 be cautious in promoting even strongly held views and
 would likely back down if the government dug in on
 an issue. Even so, the Alliance would have a moderat-
 ing effect on the extreme tendencies in either party it
 supports.
 An Alliance partnership with a Labor government
 would be better for US interests than Labor governing
 on its own, because it would work to eliminate the
 more radical planks in Labor's program, such as
 immediate unilateral disarmament, and would try to
 stop Labor's planned withdrawal from the European
 Community. The Labor right wing probably would
 welcome Alliance participation in beating back the
 Labor left, and there is even a chance that such
 cooperation could so enrage the radical left-whose
 policies have dominated Labor's election programs-
 that the Labor Party would divide. Under this scenar-
 io, the moderate Laborites and the SDP might co-
 alesce and the radical Labor group could shrink into a
 small leftwing party.
 In support of the Conservatives, the Alliance would
 work to implement some of its populist aims-such as
 creating more jobs-although it seems unlikely that
 Thatcher would agree to anything that could set back
 one of her most heralded accomplishments, the strik-
 ing decline of British inflation. A minority Tory
 government would have to weigh Alliance reserva-
 tions about cruise missiles and might even be forced to
 delay deployment. Based on its platform, the Alliance
 would also try to prevent the purchase of Trident on
 the grounds that it is too expensive. As in the case of
 Labor, Alliance influence on Tory policies could even
 be welcomed by many in the party who have thought
 the Thatcher policies too extreme. This influence
 probably would not have the same divisive effect on
 the Conservatives, however, because internal dis-
 agreements lack the bitter quality that has marked
 disputes in Labor ranks.

 The Alliance has said it could cooperate with either
 Labor or the Tories, and it is likely to try to work out
 a deal with whichever party gains a plurality. The
 Alliance probably could cooperate more easily with
 the Tories, whose positions on such issues as the EC,
 the economy, and-to a lesser extent-defense, are
 close enough for the two to find compromises. The
 Tories, whose support has not eroded over time as
 drastically as that of the Labor Party, might also be
 better able to make a bow toward the Alliance
 demands on proportional representation. The Alliance
 probably would be better off trying to support Labor,
 however, if it is ever to entice the right wing of that
 party into its camp and realize its goal of replacing
 Labor as the alternative to the Tories.
 We believe the gradual, long-term decline in electoral
 support for both Labor and Tory parties, the in-
 creased polarization of British politics, and a large
 sector of the population that seems willing to try
 something new, has left space for a moderate party in
 the middle.' Current downward trends in support for
 the two major parties, moreover, seem to indicate that
 the share of voters looking for a moderate alternative
 will continue to grow. All of this has undoubtedly
 encouraged the Alliance in its hope of eventually
 replacing the Labor Party as an alternative to the
 Tories or at least gaining a permanent balance of
 power position in the center of the British political
 spectrum.
 The Alliance has no room for complaisance, however.
 The large swing vote has proven to be fickle, as
 illustrated by the outcome of the Darlington by-
 election, and Alliance solidarity has been tenuous at
 the local level. Even the national leaders might be
 tempted to split, especially if members of Parliament
 are lopsidedly elected from only one of the Alliance
 partners. In an April press statement, Steel firmly
 ruled out the possibility that the Liberals would make
 agreements with one of the larger parties on their
 own, but SDP members publicly concede that the
 strength of their commitment depends on the election
 result. Other problems-the rivalry for leadership
 preeminence, financing, policy differences, and the
 public's low expectations about Alliance prospects-
 could all scuttle Alliance hopes of a breakthrough at
 the national level.
