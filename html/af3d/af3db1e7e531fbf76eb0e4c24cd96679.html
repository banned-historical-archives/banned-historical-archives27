 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 "B" EASTERN EUROPE, A  ANIA. Soviet Controls Tightened, According to the
 Albanian radio, pro-Soviet Minister of Interior Mehmet Shehu has been
 appointed interim Minister of State Control by decree of the Presidium
 of the Albanian People's Assembly. Former Minister of State Control
 Manush Myftiu has been appointed Vice Premier. In addition to harsh con-
 trol measures previously instituted by the Stalinist hierarchy under
 Shehu, all privately owned radio sets are reported to have been seized
 and persons guilty of violating the current regulations for radios will
 be severely punished, Since the bomb explosion at the Soviet legation,
 all persons are reportedly searched before being permitted to enter any
 Government office. The "Special Police" has now returned to its various
 headquarters and resumed "normal activit " which may be a forewarning
 of mass arrests of nationalist suspects.
 COs The appointment of Moscow-favored Shehu as Minister of State
 Control is a logical development in the increasing Soviet control over
 Albanian internal affairs. Previous intelligence in recent weeks has
 revealed intensified Soviet efforts to maintain its domination in
 Albania despite a marked growth of resistance activity.
 "B" F  LAND. Workers Rebuff Communists in Trade Union Elections, As a result
 of elections held 1-15 April for delegates to the quadrennial congress
 of the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) scheduled for
 June, preliminary estimates give the Social Democrats approximately 150
 seats to 70 for the Communists. This is a considerable proportional gain
 over the 1947 congress, at which the Social Democrats held 170 seats to
 the Comrmunistst 130. (P Helsinki 547, 16 Apr 51). C0      : The Social
 Democrats are now assured of continued control of SAK, and are also in
 a stronger position to prevent anticipated Communist gains in the nation-
 wide parliamentary elections next! July. A likely result of the trade
 union elections will be a decision at the SAK quadrennial congress to
 withdraw from the Moscow-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 "B" YIJGOSIw1VZA. Yu os1 via Prepared for Severance of Relations with Hungary.
 The Yugoslav Government has announced that the Swiss Government has been
 asked and has agreed to protect Yugoslav interests in Hungary in the
 event of a rupture of relations between Yugoslavia and Aiingary. Veljko
 Vlahovic, President of the Foreign Affairs Council of the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs, who is apparently acting as Foreign Minister during the
 illness of both Kardelj and Tito, explained that the Yugoslav Government
 has been forced to take measures to safeguard the employees of the Yugo-
 slav legation in Budapest and their families because of the obvious intent
 of the Hungarian Government to worsen relations between the two countries,
 (U NIT, 17 Apr 51). CON T: In 1949 the Cominform States and Yugoslavia
 began to withdraw their heads of missions and gradually reduce their

 diplomatic representations to token staffs. In November 1950 Yugoslavia
 suspended relations with Albania and closed the Albanian Iegation in Bel-
 grade. With this exception. however, the Yugoslav action with respect to
 Hungary marks the first time that any country on either side of the quarrel
 has prepared for a complete severance of relations. For the events which
 precipitated the current crisis in Hungarian-Yugoslav relations see OCT
 Daily Digests of 4,5 and 9 April 1951.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 "C"   GREECE. Municipal Elections Show Trend to Right. Nearly complete re-
 turns from Greece's first municipal elections in 17 years indicate that
 right-wing and liberal coalition candidates scored crus'Zing victories over
 left-wing opponents in nearly all major towns and cities.  (Washington
 Post, 17 Apr 51).  COMDAEN7:While complete returns are not yet in, the
 elections appear to have resulted in a greater swing to the right than
 was expected.  The apparent failure of the National Progressive Union
 of the Center (EPEK) to make a stronger showing in the elections  may
 well increase EFEK's desire to join a coalition with Prime Minister
 Venezelos' Liberals.
 "B"   IRAN. Shah Allegedly Plans Strong Measures to Cone with Current Crisis.
 25X1C                                           the Shah has decided to abandon the
 "neutrality" policy, align Iran with the West, and replace Prime
 Minister Ala by a strong government.  The following are the major points
 in the Shah's plan:  within two or three daysAla will resign and Seyyid
 Zia-Ed.-Din Tabatabai will be appointed Prune Minister.  The Shah believes
 that the.Majlis will approve him, and he will then dissolve the Majlis and
 rule by decree.  Mass arrests would be carried out rendering the National
 Front impotent and removing one to two hundred disloyal subversives.  The
 Shah is appealing to the US to support such a plan.  He considers Seyyid
 Zia essentially loyal to the throne, and that given a chance to govern he
 would show that he is not a British "stooge."                                  25X1A
 25X1A                    COMMENT:  This report would appear to repres en  ana her
 attempt by the supporters of Seyyid Zia to procure the Premiership for
 him. While Prime Minister Ala has shown unexpected strength during the
 last weeks, he has not yet obtained a vote of confidence and there had
 been much lobbying in favor of the appointment of Seyyid Zia or Qavam as
 his successor.  The plan as presented is essentially one which. has been
 backed by the UK as the best method of bringing about a reversal of
 Parliamentary approval of the nationalization of Iran's oil resourcea.
 While the movment in favor of Seyyid Zia appears to have become stronger
 in the last few weeks, there is still no definite evidence that the Shah
 has overcome his distrust of Seyyid Zia.  There is, moreover, no guarantee
 that Seyyid Zia, who has not held high public office for more than 30
 years, would turn out to be the "strong man" for whom Iranians are search-
 ing.  In view of the current Iranian temper on the oil issue, the appoint-
 ment of a man with reportedly close UK connections would probably be
 followed. by widespread popular disapproval and internal disorder.
 "B"  SYRIA/ISRAEL. Need for Greater UN Authority. US Ambassador Cannon in
 Damascus, commenting on the forthcoming debate in the UN Security Council
 of the Syrian-Israeli frontier dispute, expresses the Embassy's concern
 lest the UN may prefer to seek a settlement by handing the problem lack

 to the Mixed Ar iistice Commission (MAC), without grappling with ;the
 fundamental issue of sovereignty in the demilitarized  zone.  (See
 OCI Daily Digest, 12 and 13 Apr 51).  Cannon observes that unless UN
 authority in the demilitarized zone is clearly defined, the impotence of
 the MAC will invite repetitions of incidents at the next favorable
 occasion.  Cannon also reports the field observations of George Weller,
 foreign correspondent for the "Chicago Daily News."  As a result of the
 latter's tour with the Syrian Army.and UN observers, Weller concluded that
 the Israelis had depopulated four Arab villages in the Lake Hule region
 with the purpose of eliminating indigenous inhabitants from the demilita-
 rized zone.  Weller also reported that the Israelis have prevented UN
 observers from entering the demilitarized zone near Lake Tiberias, and
 he expressed the fear that Israeli success in thwarting the efforts of the
 UN truce observers might result in a break-doom of the UN machinery in
 that area.  (S Damascus 535, 15 Apr 518 R Damascus 530, 13 Apr 51)~.
 COMMENT: While both Israel and Syria, after airing their complaints in
 the Security Council, are again apparently amenable to seeking a solution
 of their dispute through the MAC, the problem is still serious since the.
 views of both sides are. wide apart.  Israeli?s evacuation of Arab villages
 in the demilitarized zone underlines the lack of adequate MAC authority
 for dealing with recurrent Israeli-Arab border incidents.
 "C"   PAKISTAN. O p]2osition NewsnarPr Banned by Punjab Government. US Embassy
 Karachi reports that on 13 April the Punjab provincial government seized
 and sealed the press on irhich the anti-Moslem League NAVA-I-WAQQT, an
 Urdu daily, was printed.  On 15 April the Karachi radio announced the
 appearance in Lahore of a new Urdu daily, THE JIHAD, edited by the staff
 of NA?A-I-WAQT.  (S Joint Weeka 15, Karachi, 13 Apr 51; U FBIS Ticker,
 Karachi, 15 Apr 51).  COWJENTs In recent provincial elections in the
 Punjab (See OCI Daily Digest, 5 Arr 51), the non-Co.mmunist NAWA-I-PAQT
 was the sole, Urdu daily in Lahore supporting the Jinnah Awami Moslem
 League, the strongest party opposing the Moslem League of Liaquat All.
 Khan.  Although the Moslem League won 143 out of the 197 seats contested
 in the elections, its actual popular vote was only slightly more than
 50% of the total.  The closing of NAWA-I-WAQT suggests that the Moslem
 League is still concerned over its opposition.  The appearance o4' JIHAD
 presumably will not relieve the government's anxiety.
 "A"   INDOCHINA. Viet Minh Action in Northwest Tonkin Predicted. A French
 officer in the northwest Tonkin area states that during the recent incur-
 sion of a Chinese battalion into this area, Viet Minh forces occupied the
 post of Binh Lu.  The source states that there are "several indications"
 that the Viet Minh intends to make a strong effort to seize the surround-
 ing area which is inhabited by non-Vietnamese mountain tribes.  (S uanoi
 572, 13 Apr 51).  COMMENT: There is no evidence to support the estimate
 that the Viet Minh intends to make a strong effort to gain control. of
 this area other than the fact that Viet Minh units are operating there
 and may seize the opportunity to initiate action which will drain French
 reserves from the critical zone of operations,in the Tonkin delta.

 "B"   INDOCHINA. Pro-French Vietnamese Faetior. Purges Opposition Nationalists.
 Under the vigorous direction of Nguyen Van Tam, Police Chief and close
 associate of Premier..Tran Van Huu, drastic personnel changes have been
 made in the administration of the regional administration of North Vietnam.
 The list of expelled office-holders includes both members of the :Dai Viet
 party and independent nationalists who have opposed, or been suspected
 of opposing, the policies of Premier Huu,  (S Hanoi 571, 13 Apr 5:L)
 COMMENT: The reorganization of the North Vietnam administration began
 with Premier Huues successful campaign to remove the able and intensely
 nationalistic Governor of North Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tri.  In late March,
 Tri was replaced by an official of meager ability whose amenability to
 the policies of the Huu cabinet is demonstrated by his submissiveness to
 the purge tactics of Police. Chief Tam.  The current ascendancy of Huu
 and Tam, both of whom are naturalized French citizens and pro-French in
 sentiment, has seriously undermined the effective administration which
 had been built up under the leadership of ex-governor Tri in North
 Vietnam and has caused profound discouragement among Vietnamese nationalists
 who are opposed both to Communism and to continued French domination of
 Vietnam.
 "C"    INDONESIA. Plans Continue forMa.siumi-PNI Cabinet. Although cabinet
 discussions between the Masjumi (Moslem) Party and the Indonesian
 National Party (PNI) have reached a complete impasse, the possibilit
 25X6         of a government supported by both parties still exists*
 the PNI has come
 to the conclusion that although it cannot form a government with the        25X6
 Masjumi neither can it depend chiefl  a on leftist groups and form a
 government excluding the Masjumi.                                premier-
 designate Sartono of the PNI will return his mandate to President Sukarno
 within a few days and that the President will then request a non-;party
 man to form a cabinet.  Vice-President Hatta appears to be the logical
 formateur  or such a cabinet and may be instructed to select the 'best
 men from the two major parties--the Masjumi and the PNI--to fill ministerial
 posts.  Foreign Minister Roem, a Mas umi leader who has taken part in the
 cabinet talks,                                              expects a presidential
 announcement on government formation shortly.  (S Djakarta 1438, :L6 Apr 51).
 COMMENT: Cabinet negotiations undertaken by a non-party man such as Hatta
 would encounter fewer difficulties than interparty efforts,chiefl;y because
 it would be unnecessary for one party to yield to the other.  Since the
 PNI has exhibited a more cooperative attitude in the task of government
 formation than had been expected and since its chief ambition for months
 has been solely that of achieving participation in the government before
 elections are held, there is a strong probability that the developments
 will take place and will be successful.

 "C"   PHILIPPINES. Current Huk Capabilities. The Government's intensified
 military operations apparently have forced the Huks to disperse into
 small groups and disrupted the Huk top command.  The continuation of
 these operations may succeed in reducing the chances for large scale
 raids; any relaxation of military effort, however, will probably result
 in Huk outbreaks.  Although the Huks would probably experience difficulty
 in regrouping for large raids, there is no positive evidence that they
 cannot do so.  There is little immediate danger of a Manila raid, but
 any weakening of Government forces stationed in the capital might pre-
 cipitate Huk action.  (S PHILCOM USAF 1882, 13 Apr 51).  COMMENT: The
 Government is apparently continuing an energetic anti-Huk campaign.
 It will probably require military units to continue to provide a strong
 guard for Manila.
 "A"  CHINA. Rumored Death of MAO Tse-tung. A Chinese source of unknown re-
 liability states that MAO Tse-tung died on the evening of 26 March in
 Peiping.  Alleged contributing causes were "too much drink and women,"
 reverses in Korea and Soviet default on promises, and high blood-pressure.
 During his illness, MAO is said to have appointed LIU Shao-ch'i to act
 for him.  (S Hong Kong 3031, 16 Apr 51).  C O M E  : Since MAO's last
 appearance at a public function in Peiping on 26 January, several sources
 have reported him to be seriously ill.   An Indonesian Attache at Peiping
 was recently quoted as stating that he had seen an official announcement
 of MAO's illness.  Although MAO may indeed be ill, or dead, there has
 been no confirmation of these reports from reliable sources.
 "C"a          Anti-UK Demonstration on Taiwan. The British Consulate at Tamsui,
 16 miles from Taipei, was entered on 17 April by 40 Chinese students who
 tore drvm the Union Jack and raised, the Nationalist flag.  At the request
 of two Nationalist policemen the demonstrators peacefully withdrew.  A
 consulate official stated. that trouble had been expected since the spread of
 advo-
 t
 t
 y

 rumors that the British draft notice on the Japanese peace
 cated the transfer of Formosa to Communist China.  (U Taipei Reuter,
 17 Apr 51).  COMMENT: In mid-January 1950, a similar anti-British demon-
 stration occured.  British policy toward Communist China has been a sore
 spot with the Nationalists, many of whom felt that the UK was the prime
 mover in the recall of MacArthur.

 that members of "his organization"--an alleged anti-Communist. network in
 the Communist administration--have neither training in nor facilities for
 gathering intelligence, and that his information is largely derived from
 overheard conversations and is transmitted verbally.  While most of source's
 reports have been fairly plausible, none has yet been confirmed by events,

 KOREA. North Koreans Extend Unacceptable Peace Terms. In the April 15
 "Peace Offer" broadcast over the. North Korean radio by Foreign.Minister
 Pak Hunyong, a prerequisite demanded for the "peaceful settlement of the
 Korean problem," was that the United Nations "stop the crimes of the
 American imperialist in Korea immediately and punish the war criminals
 who organized and agitated for these crimes."  (R FBIS, 15 Apr 51).
 COMMENT: Little divergence from previous Communist "Peace Appeals"
 is evident in the 15 April statement.   Communist adherence to the
 fiction of "American aggression" in Korea is sufficient to discredit
 Pak's statement as propaganda.

 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 "B"  FRANCE.  A reement on European Army Unlikely before French Elections.
 According to t e French delegate to the European Army Conference,
 no'agreement as to size of the basic military unit and level. of
 integration is likely until after this year's French elections,
 because prior to that time "it is difficult-for the French Government
 to talk about anything resembling German divisions."  Since Communist
 propaganda would have a particularly telling effect at present, the
 French Foreign Office is pursuing a policy of minimum publicity and
 is content to give the impression that the conference is deadlocked
 or quiescent.  (S Paris 6221, l1 Apr 51).  COMMENT:  This is the
 first indication from official sources that  hie French are purposely
 delaying agreement.  Despite French assurances to the contrary,
 development of NATO may be delayed by failure of the western European
 nations to reach an agreement on these important points, particularly
 if French elections are not.held before autumno  While most Frenchmen
 probably now accept the inevitability of German rearmament, this
 issue can still be successfully exploited for political purposes.
 "C"  BELGIUM.  Defense Contribution Termed Inadequate.   In a strongly-
 wordec speech  to the Flemish Economic Union, a business group,. the
 US Ambass'~dor bluntly stated that "doubts" existed in Washington
 over the size of Belgium's financial commitment for Western defense
 in relation to its ability to contribute.. He also warned of possible
 cuts in US aid if it is determined' after careful study that defense
 efforts are ..not adequate.  The Ambassador added that there was
 "curiosity" in Washington concerning Belgian transit and other trade

 activities with the Soviet Orbit.  (U NY Times,' 17 Apr 51).  CONWNT:
 The popularity of the one-party Catholic Government of Premier
 Pholien, which has never been well-received, probably will reach
 a new low as a result of;:  (1) criticism of its defense effort;
 (2) inadequacy of its export control policy; and (3) stoppage of EGA
 'allotments as an outgrowth of a court order holding up US dollars
 earmarked for Greek railroads,  (See OCI Daily Digest, 6 Apr 51,
 14 Apr 51, 16 Apr 51).  Consequently, the Belgians probably will
 review their defense commitments to dated  However, no changes in
 the composition of the Government are expected until after September.
 The Belgians have cooperated fully within the limits of their laws
 in preventing transit and other shipments of strategic commodities
 to,the Soviet Union and Orbit nations, and strengthening their
 present export control policy poses a difficult financial and employ-
 ment problem.
 ."C" ICELAND.  US Press Treatment of Defense Pacts Disturbs Foreign Minister.
 Foreign Minister Benediktsson fears that an.artic e in a US newspaper
 alleging current negotiations for "bomber bases in Iceland from which
 to attack Moscow' will be exploited by the Communists to embarrass
 the Government and therefore will hamper public acceptance of the
 US-Iceland defense agreement now being negotiated.  Benediktsson
 expressed particular alarm over indications in the article that
 information came from the US Defense Department and also seemed upset
 because the article.gives an erroneous impression of the immediate
 purposes of the defense pact.  (TS Reykjavik 199, 15 Apr 51).
 C01AIENT: The Foreign Minister has deliberately kept current
 negotiations shrouded in great secrecy in Iceland to preclude advance
 Communist propaganda attacks and to minimize the time for public
 prejudice against the agreement to develop.  If the news is subject
 to Communist exploitation prior to its-formal release to the public,
 the Government's careful plans for speedy passage with a minimum of
 publicity may be seriously jeopardized.

 OFFICE OF CURRENT INTELLIGENCE
 DAILY DIGEST OF SIGNIFICANT S/S CABLES
 17 April 1951
 "A"  Soviet Position Appears Somewhat Clarified.  Following an informal dis-
 cussion on 14 April among the principals at the Deputies' Conference, the
 three western representatives agree that Gromyko conveyed an impression of
 absolute rigidity on his demand to have reduction precede level of armament,
 and that he would probably continue to insist on giving priority to the
 question of German demilitarization.  On the other hand, he seemed receptive
 to elimination of the Soviet-proposed NAT item and to a possible deal on
 Trieste.  The Chief of the French delegation emphatically stated his steadily
 hardening conviction that the West cannot yield on the position of armament
 reduction, beat he considers a final decision at this conference urgent, and
 suggested a "double formulation" (split agenda) on the armaments sub-item as
 offering the best possiblity of breaking the.impasse.  The UK delegate seemed
 to concede that this might well eliminate UK fears that the Soviets may be-
 come more uncompromising.  (S S/S Paris 6227, 14 Apr 51),  CO10 ENT:  The in-
 formal Tripartite meeting on Saturday indicates that the Western delegates -
 notably as a result of the UK stand - are closer to an agreed position than
 was apparent in their recent discussions.
 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 "B"  YUGOSLAVIA.  US and UK to Meet Yugoslav Economic Crisis.  In accordance
 with the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, and after consultations with
 North Atlantic Treaty members, the US Government has decided to grant
 $29,000,000 to Yugoslavia for raw materials and other supplies.  The aid was
 authorized because existing shortages are "so acute as to jeopardize the
 combat effectiveness of the Yugoslav Armed Forces and to weaken the ability
 of Yugoslavia to defend itself,   To meet the current critical raw material
 shortage in Yugoslavia, the UK Government on 5 April approved'a credit of
 4,000,000 pounds.  (U  N.Y. Times, 16 Apr 51; S S/S London 5299, 6 Apr 51)?
 CO  ENTm' In early March 1951 the Yugoslav Government made a formal request
 for "30,000,000 North of raw materials,, notably cotton, wool, hides, chemi-
 cal raw materials                   and coke, to meet the Yugoslav economic crisis.  (OCI
 Daily Digest S Mar 51),  According to the British Economic Mission in

 Belgrade, the US and UK grants will cover at best only a period until the
 end of June 1951.  US, UK, and French representatives are currently holding
 economic talks in London to determine the best means of meeting the longer
 term economic requirements of Yugoslavia and balancing Yugoslav foreign
 trade as soon as possible.
 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 "C" PERU.  Opening of Conversations on Troop Offer for Korea.  President Odra
 informed our Ambassador in Lim on 14 April that Peru would offer a
 "contingent" of troops to take part in the Korean campaign on condition
 that Peru would not be obliged to equip, transport, or maintain troops in
 Korea, and provided further that the US would guarantee peace in Latin
 America.  (S S/S Lima 520, 14 Apr 51).  0ONiENT:  Although the initial sug-
 gestion is extremely vague as to the number of troops to be offered, and al-
 though the Peruvian Government undoubtedly realizes that'the suggested
 conditions are unlikely to be accepted in full, Peru may well intend to make
 a sincere offer ultimately.  A strong impetus to participate actively in the
 Korean campaign is provided by Peru+s rivalry with Colombia, which did offer
 1080 men who are currently being trained and equipped with modern weapons.
