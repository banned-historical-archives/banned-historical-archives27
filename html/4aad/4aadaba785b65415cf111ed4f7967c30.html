 THE FUTURE OF LATIN AMERICA
 AND THE PROBLEM OF THE SO-
 VIET QUISLING REGIME IN CUBA
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, over the
 past several weeks, some of our most
 distinguished Senators have made state-
 ments On the subject of Cuba, expressing
 diverse opinions. This is as it should be,
 if the Senate is truly to fulfill its advi-
 sory fuction in the critical realm of for-
 eign affairs.
 For my own part, I have hesitated to
 speak before today for several reasons.
 In the first place, I do not regard the
 Cuban situation as one which lends it-
 self to a simple one-word or one-action
 solution.
 I do not believe that the way to deal
 with it is to send in the marines tomor-
 row.
 In the second place, I know how great
 the cares of the President are, and how
 many different factors must be taken in-
 to consideration in establishing our pol-
 icy toward Cuba and toward Latin,Amer-
 ica as a whole.  I do not wish to add to
 the great burden he is_carrying.  I want
 to help our President, and that is why
 I speak today.
 But, in the course of the current de-
 bate on Cuba, there are certain things
 that have not yet been said; there are
 certain aspects of the situation that have
 not been given due consideration.
 I speak today in the hope that I can
 contribute, at least in small measure, to
 the discussion which is essential to the
 clarification of our collective thinking on
 Cuba.

 to accept as gospel the evaluation of the
 Castro movement which found its way
 into the staid columns of the New York
 Times through the pen of Mr. Herbert
 Matthews.
 Mr. Matthews. assured the American
 public that Castro was not a Communist
 and that the Castro movement was not
 Communist-dominated; , and Matthews
 built up a hero image of Castro in which
 all the virtues, of Robin Hood and
 Thomas Jefferson,, of George Washing-
 ton, and Abraham Lincoln, were com-
 bined in a single man.
 The-American people were fed more
 of the same hokum over the CBS net-
 work in a documentary film prepared
 by their Cuban correspondent,  Mr.
 Robert Taber. Mr. Taber, who was dis-
 missed by CBS when he was called
 before the Senate Subcommittee on In-
 ternal Security, later blossomed forth as
 director of the Fair Play for Cuba Com-
 mittee, a Castro-subsidized front organ-
 ization which for some time enjoyed a
 considerable vogue in this country.  It
 also developed that Mr. Taber had a long
 criminal record, which included convic-
 tions for robbery and kidnaping.
 Because we were thus misled as to the
 true nature of the Castro movement, be-
 cause the reports of our Ambassadors
 and of our i        ce ~P~, .rv,    , , were
 minimized or Ignored, because some of
 the experts in our Latin American divi-
 Sion assured their superiors, in almost
 vehement terms, that there was no proof
 that Castre was a .Communist or that his
 movement was Communist dominated-
 because of these things we did nothing to
 prevent Castro from coming to power in
 Cuba.  Indeed, to the extent that our
 .diplomacy did intervene in Cuba, it in-
 tervened in a manner that was mathe-
 matically guaranteed to assure , the in-
 stallation of a Castro regime.
 The Batista regime crumbled pri-
 marily because it was venal and inept
 and cruel and had lost popular support.
 But it was American policy that was
 responsible for the timing of Batista's
 downfall and for the fact that when he
 fell, the only man that could fill the
 vacuum that was thus created was Fidel
 Castro.
 No effort had been made to encourage
 the formation of a middle-of-the-road
 alternative to both Batista and Castro.
 No -effort was made to explore the pos-
 sibility of an election under OAS aus-
 pices, which our Ambassador to Cuba
 had advocated and believed possible.
 As another variant, -we might have
 explored the possibility of democratic
 reform under a non-Castro regime by
 stabilizing the situation until President
 Rivero Aguero; who had been elected as
 Batista's successor in November 1958,
 eDuld be formally installed in an in-
 augural ceremony that was scheduled for
 February 24, 1959.
 But apparently no alternative to a
 ,Castro takeover was given serious con-
 stderatign.   Our  position  was  that
 Batista had to go and go immediately;
 and if Castro -was the only man on the
 scene able, to tq~ie over at that time,
 then the prudent thing to do was to be
 nice,to' Castro and to give him a chance
 to prove that he 'was basically a "de-
 cent fellow."
 Because this was our attitude, no ef-
 fort was made to warn the Cuban people,
 the overwhelming majority of whom
 were anti-Communist, of the dangerous
 degree of control which Moscow-trained
 Communists exercised in the Castro
 movement.
 When the Castro regime publicly re-
 vealed its true colors, a decision was
 made, during the last months of the,
 Eisenhower administration, to give ac-
 tive assistance to the Cuban opposition
 in an effort to overthrow the Castro dic-
 tatorship.  This effort could have suc-
 ceeded, indeed, I am certain it would
 have succeeded, had we determined in
 advance to support the Cuban freedom
 fighters on their beachhead with Ameri-
 can air cover, to assure the success of
 their undertaking.  But in this case,,..
 policy which had been rightly and
 T ere was, in particular, great concern
 that active American involvement in the
 Cuban invasion would alienate many of
 the Latin American and Afro-Asian na-
 tions and further complicate our posi-
 tion within the United Nations.
 With some advisers pulling one way,
 and some advisers pulling the other way,
 the Cuban freedom fighters and the
 cause of Cuban freedom became the in-
 evitable casualties.
 The freedom fighters did not receive
 the air support which had been consid-
 ered essential to the success of the in-
 vasion; and the result was the Bay of
 Pigs disaster.
 THE HIGH COST OF NOT TAKING DECISIVE
 MEASURES
 To overthrow. the Castro regime to-
 day-I have ng illusions on this score
 will require a far greater effort than it
 would have required 1 year ago.
 But the cost of overthrowing it today
 would be infinitely smaller than the
 price we will have to pay 2 or 3 years
 hence, when we may very well be con-
 fronted not with a single Castro regime,
 but with some half-dozen Castro regimes
 scattered through Latin America.
 . Each year that we fail to face up to the
 danger of Castroism, the cost of con-
 fronting it goes up in geometric propor-
 tion.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD at the
 conclusion of my remarks an article on
 Cuba written by the distinguished col-
 umnist Roscoe Drummond, which ap-
 peared in the August 29 issue of the
 Washington Post.  I consider it an ar-
 ticle of such significance that I hope all
 Senators will find the time to read it.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)           -
 Mr. DODD.  The basic argument of
 Mr. Drummond's column is that we can-
 not expect the Castro dictatorship to die
 on the vine; that while 'there is hunger,
 undernourishment and monumental mis-
 management under the Castro regime,
 Castro, despite all ' this-I quote  "is
 steadily tightening his grip on the Cu-
 ban state and on the Cuban people-
 with so much Soviet help that he is both
 ally and captive."
 Approved For Release ?2006/09/27.: CIA-RDP64B00346R000200150003-4
 Perhaps the most cogent -argument
 against the "let Castro die on the vine"
 thesis was made by the internationally
 famous liberal historian, Salvador de
 Madariaga, one of Europe's most revered
 elder statesmen, who for many years
 played a distinguished role in the League
 of Nations.  Professor de Madariaga
 makes this statement in his recent book
 "Between the Bear and the Eagle":
 The argument that Castro had better be
 l f+~'~      oven  ennngh  T s a~+^-  hang
 himself is worthless. the experience of other
 nations fallen into the unscrupulous hands
 of the Communist Party allows of no such
 optimism.  Time could only make of Cuba
 an  impregnable base for communism to
 spread all over Latin America.  The Latin
 American - governments  who  shilly-shally
 over it are only preparing the rope with
 which they will be hanged.  Castro must go
 soon.                             -
 I concur, wholeheartedly in this opin-
 ion. If we permit the Castro regime to
 remain on the Latin American vine, in
 the hope that it will perish, the chances
 are that, instead of perishing of its own
 weakness, it will spread its disease to the
 rest of the vine.
 We have committed ourselves to a
 massive program, the Alliance for Prog-
 ress, in an effort to rehabilitate and
 modernize the economies of the Latin
 American countries.  But this entire
 program is vitiated from the outset by
 I the mere exisetnce of the Castro dicta-
 torship.
 The fact is that we are losing the cold
 war in Latin America and we shall con-
 tinue to lose it so long as we use foreign
 aid, unsupported by vigorous political
 action, as the chief instrument of Amer-
 ican policy.
 I have heard from many sources that,
 in most of the Latin American countries,
 the Alliance for Progress program is vir-
 tually unknown to the man on the
 streets. True, the intellectuals do know
 about it; but as things are 'today in
 Latin America, the majority of the in-
 tellectuals are prone to condemn the
 Alliance as a device for the enslavement
 of Latin America by "American imperial-
 ism." -
 We put up money to build schools and
 combat illiteracy and encourage higher
 education. But all too often the teach-
 ers in these schools and the professors
 in the universities are members of Com-
 munist-dominated unions, who use their
 American-supported educational facili-
 ties to teach their wards to hate America
 and despise capitalism, and to admire
 everything that bears the Soviet brand-
 mark.
 A recent survey in Venezuela showed-
 that the percentage of Communist teach-
 ers in grade schools ranged from a high
 of 86 percent in some schools to a low
 of 33 percent in other schools.  It also
 showed. that  there  were  800  card-
 carrying students in the engineering
 school of the University of Venezuela.
 In Brazil, according to the newspapers,
 the Communists also completely domi-
 nate the student movement. I quote
 from a New York Times dispatch from
 Rio de Janeiro, dated July 23:
 The leftist-dominated National Students
 Union has elected an unopposed list of of-
 ficers on a platform including opposition to

 I cannot, however, agree with those
 who are today urging that we invade and
 occupy Cuba with American forces.
 -'  a ca ~3r nrul scan m      oc
 cupation of Cuba is false -in its emphasis
 and lays us open to unnecessary attack
 by the Communist and Castroite propa-
 ganda apparatus.  Because of this, an
 American military occupation of Cuba,
 even if carried out with 'dispatch and
 -efficiency, might very well produce a
 worseping  of  the political  situation
 throughout Latin America.
 The Cuban people must be liberated
 from Soviet slavery. The right of self-
 determination must be restored to them.
 But the task of liberation must be car-
 ried out, in the first instance, by the
 Cuban people themselves.  The role of
 the United States and of the other
 American nations must be limited to
 supporting the forces of Cuban freedom.
 There is too great a tendency to ac-
 cept Communist revolutions as irreversi-
 ble and Communist regimes as perma-
 nent.
 Indeed,  this  assumption  somehow
 seems to have become an essential in-
 gredient of our foreign policy.
 It is an ingredient which seems to have
 had a paralyzing effect on our under-
 standing and on our will.
 It is not too much to say that unless
 we can succeed in shaking off this paral-
 ysis, the triumph of the Communist
 world, over the free world is inevitable.
 Even those who urge conciliation with
 communism will not dispute the state-
 ment that the Communists seek to sub-
 ject the remaining,free governments of
 the world by every means at their dis-
 posal-by propaganda, by political agi-
 tation, by infiltration, by guerrilla action,
 and, in certain cases, by direct military
 aggression. Nor would they question the
 statement that, employing these means,
 the Communists since World War II have
 annexed or succeeded in taking over the
 following roster of countries and terri-
 tories:   Lithuania,  Latvia,  Estonia,
 Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Ru-
 mania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania,
 East Germany, North Korea, mainland
 China, North Vietnam, Tibet, northern
 Laos, and Cuba.
 Rosters of names, I know, make dreary
 reading.  But I do not think it would
 hurt us to repeat this roster to ourselves
 at regular intervals.
 True, we did succeed in preventing the
 Communists from taking over in Greece,
 inGuatem ala and in South Korea. But
 the final outcome of the struggle is a
 matter of simple arithmetic if the Com-
 munists continue to annex new terri-
 tories while we limi1t ourselves, at each
 juncture, to defending 'sometimes sucv,
 cessifully, sometimes unsuccessfully, what
 remitins of the free world.
 I believe that if Communist counter-
 revolutions are possible, revolutions for
 freedom are also possible.' I believe that
 if Communist regimes can be imposed on
 peoples, there are also ways in which
 .these regimes can be deposed. I believe
 that the entire record of the postwar
 period, indeed, underscores the vulnera-
 bility of Communist regimes and the

 This combination of ineptness and `      If such a total revolution against com-
 cynicism, of economic hardship and

 tyranny, has, in turn, produced in the
 countries subjected by communism a
 hatred more violent and more universal
 in nature than anything heretofore re-
 corded by history.  The phenomenon of
 total dictatorship has, in fact, produced
 the phenomenon of the "total revolu-
 tion," in which entire peoples, including
 the military forces under supposedly
 Communist  direction, - have  revolted
 against their Communist masters.     -
 The French Revolution was opposed
 not merely by the aristocracy, but by
 substantial sections of the middle class
 and, in certain parts of France, even by
 the peasants.
 . The American Revolution, in terms of
 popular support, was at best a majority
 proposition, with substantial portions of
 the population remaining loyal to the
 British Crown, while other portions re-
 mained uncommitted.
 The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and
 the Communist revolutions that. have
 taken place since that time, were dis-
 tinctly minority affairs, in which dis-
 ciplined conspiratorial parties, number-
 ing only a tiny fraction of the total popu-
 lation, succeeded in imposing their will
 on their peoples by force and by subter-
 fuge.            -
 But there was no such national divi-
 sion at the time of the East German up-
 rising in 1953, of the Polish uprising of
 1956, of the Hungarian revolution of Oc-
 tober 1956, of the Tibetan uprising of
 March 1959.  These national uprisings
 against Communist tyranny have been
 marked by their universal nature, by
 the fact that in each case the armed
 forces sided with the people against the
 tyrants.  The report of the United Na-
 tions Committee on Hungary, for ex-
 ample, made the point that, when the
 Red army invaded Hungary to put down
 the revolution, there was not a single
 recorded instance of Hungarian fighting
 against Hungarian.  It was the Hun-
 garian people as a whole fighting against
 the tanks of the Red army.
 munism were to take place in Cuba,
 however, its immediate success would be
 assured for the simple reason that the
 Soviet Union and Communist China
 would be in no position to intervene in
 Cuba as they did in Hungary and East
 Germany and Tibet. -
 Against this background, Mr. Presi-
 dent, I do not think it unrealistic to
 suggest that we should strive to assist
 the Cuban freedom movement to build
 up its forces and to foster the conditions
 for a total anti-Communist revolution,
 uniting the Cuban people and the Cuban
 armed forces against the quisling ty-
 rants who oppress them.
 We should not wait for this revolution
 to take place accidentally or spontane-
 ously.  On the contrary, short of open
 military intervention by American mili-
 tary forces, we should do everything in -
 our power to encourage and to assist the
 forces of Cuban liberation.
 I believe that the proposal of Profes-
 sor de Madariaga for collective action by
 the Organization of American States in
 support of Cuban freedom is the ideal
 for which we should strive. But if such
 action cannot be organized, if our Latin
 American friends continue to shilly-
 shally, then, as President Kennedy sug-
 gested in his historic speech before the
 American Society of Newspaper Editors
 after the Bay of Pigs disaster, we must
 be prepared to act alone in support of
 the Cuban people.
 Our patience is not inexhaustible-

 then I want it clearly understood that this
 Government will not hesitate in meeting its
 primary obligations which are to the security

 Like all of my colleagues, I have given
 much thought to the situation in Cuba.
 I should like to submit for their consid-
 eration a six-point plan of action for the
 liberation of Cuba.
 I submit this plan with no sense of
 finality.

 Economic aid from the Soviet Union and
 Red China is failing to live up to promises-
 even as Fidel has failed to live up to his
 promises. Castro is finding that'Communist
 bloc assistance-except arms-is not only
 doled out very carefully, but is also costly.
 Cuba's slim reserves of foreign currency are
 steadily being drained away, largely because
 Cuba no longer has the exports it can sell
 to the hard-currency countries.
 But Latin American sources on the con-
 tinent are convinced that Castro is steadily
 tightening his grip on the Cuban state and
 on the Cuban people-with so much Soviet
 help that he is both ally and captive.
 Castro's armed forces seem to be all that
 he needs-and more-to prevail over any
 opposition.that might develop.  The Soviet
 Union is stepping up its shipments of arms
 and thousands of "technicians." Castro has
 recruited the forces in ample volume.  There
 is every reason to assume that the army
 Is  loyal  to  Castro's  bidding. While  the
 regime has been unable to feed his people
 properly, it has taken care to see that its
 troops are a favored class.  This means that
 the Castro army is massively armed, well
 fed, and heavily disciplined for its duty-
 to keep the dictatorship in control at all
 costs.
 A LIBERAL'S VIEW
 A distinguished European liberal who has
 recently visited Latin America contends that
 Cuba ought to be liberated by the Organi-
 zation, of American States.  These are the
 words of Salvador de Madariaga:
 "The argument that Castro had better be
 left alone and given enough rope to hang
 himself  is  worthless.   The experience  of
 other nations fallen into the unscrupulous
 hands of the Communist Party allows of
 no such optimism.  Time could only make
 of Cuba an impregnable. base for commu-
 nism to spread all over Latin America.                                                                                                                                       The
 Latin  American  governments  who    shilly-
 shally over it are only preparing the rope
 with which  they will be hanged.      Castro
 must go soon."
 But wishful hoping will not free the Cu-
 ban people.                                                                                                                                    Castro will fall-only if he is

 RED DECISION To BOOST AID TO CASTRO Is
 SEEN
 (By Donald May)
 The Soviet Union appears to have made
 a major policy decision to prop up the Castro
 regime in Cuba and draw it closer to the
 Communist camp, U.S. observers said yes-
 terday,
 Administration officials, who a week ago
 reported a big increase in Soviet military aid
 to Castro, gave this updated account of the
 situation :
 Military supplies believed to include trans-
 portation,  electronics,  and  construction
 equipment which had been reported being
 unloaded at Cuban ports late July and early
 August, apparently are being transported to
 sites around the island.
 Officials feel it is a pretty safe prediction
 that the supplies will turn out to include
 Soviet antiaircraft missiles similar to the
 U.S. Nike.  The prediction is based on other
 equipment which has been identified and the
 fact that Russia has given such missiles to
 Iraq and Indonesia.
 A number of small patrol craft arrived as
 deck cargo aboard Soviet ships.  It is not
 clear whether they were torpedo boats, as

 tions which the military refused to accept on
 charges of fraud at the polls.
 Peru's economy, compared to that of other
 South American countries, is in fair shape.
 Yet more than 6 million of its 11 million
 people live in poverty, illiteracy, and squalor.
 Little has been done to help these people, and
 the Communists are busy among them.
 Venezuela, Reds' No. 1 target: As a demo-
 cratic country which leads all on this con-
 tinent in terms of social gains made in re-
 cent  years,  Venezuela's  democratic  Gov-
 ernment has become a prime target for
 Communists.
 Under   President   R6mulo Betancourt,
 schools are going up, land is being parceled
 out to those who farm it; low-cost housing
 is rising in city and town.  But lingering
 recession in some industries keeps the. num-
 ber of unemployed at about 300,000-or 12
 percent of the work force.
 Venezuelan Communists are trying their
 best to justify the prediction of Castro of
 Cuba that Betancourt would be "gone" by
 the  year's end.  Reds  spearhead  the  op-
 position in the Chamber of Deputies, control
 young gangsters at the University of Caracas,
 stir up revolts in the armed forces, stage
 bank and store robberies. Jittery Venezue-
 lan businessmen have been exporting their
 capital.
 Chile, a squeeze: President Jorge Ales-
 sandri of Chile is caught in a squeeze be-
 tween wealthy landowners who block reform
 bills in, congress and a five-party Popular
 Front grouping which includes  the Com-
 munists and which expects to win the pres-
 idency in 1964.
 One result of the squeeze has been failure
 of the government efforts to get more returns
 from income taxes.  But taxes. on the U.S.-
 owned copper companies are rising higher
 and higher.
 Wealthy Chileans are sending their capital
 abroad in such quantities that reserves of
 foreign currencies have dropped  sharply,
 and the value of the Chilean escudo has
 fallen too.
 All over South America, troubles of a polit-
 ical and economic nature appear to be ris-
 ing faster than ever in recent years.
 Bolivia, the nearly bankrupt welfare state
 of the Andes, has been kept going by doses of
 U.S.  aid  doled  out  as  direct  gifts.  Now
 powerful labor unions are resisting changes
 in the fantastic featherbedding pratcices of
 the nationalized tin mines.
 In Ecuador, where the conservatives won
 a victory in last spring's elections sitdown
 strikes took over all the private banks in
 Guayaquil, the country's main port city.
 Political rioters had to be dispersed with
 tear gas by police.  The chances of getting
 much-needed     measures  for  land  reform
 seemed slim.
 Missing, dynamism: Through most of the
 countries of South America there is a short-
 age of dynamism in the democratic systems
 of government.
 Experts of the. Kennedy government who
 surveyed.  South  America's  leadership  ap-
 parently counted on parties of the "demo-
 cratic left" in various countries to supply
 the drive to push through reform programs
 vital to the Alliance for Progress.
 Now, it appears, these parties just are not
 strong enough to do the job.  In the recent
 Peruvian elections, where U.S. officials ap-
 peared to hope for a victory by the APRA
 Party, much of the "reform" fervor appeared
 to have gone out of that group.  Landown-
 ers had become APRA supporters, and the
 relatively moderate APRA program drew less
 than 33 percent of the votes.
 Military  men  rising  throughout South
 America also are turning out to be a varied
 lot, no longer predictable.  In Argentina the
 military leaders have so far shied away from
 taking the Presidential post and left it to a
 civilian.   In Peru, where the military did
 Like the stickers on all the buses saying:
 "Consume the produce of your country"-
 when Cubans would quite happily consume
 anything  from  anywhere  to  supplement
 beans and dry bread.
 Like the single island of elegance atop
 Havana's highest skyscraper where diplomats
 (and an occasional Cuban Cabinet minister)
 eat duckling while Cubans far below go
 empty bellied to their beds.
 Said one Cuban: "It's way up there in the
 sky so no one can see what's on their plates."
 Like the new tourist literature, superbly
 done, that claims in bold letters across the
 front of gay brochures: "Cuba has a flavor
 all its own."
 Like the barmen in the world-famous
 "Floridita," who have removed the solid gold
 brooches, shaped into their names, from the
 lapels of their white jackets.
 They stand now before the large letter-
 ing along the bar, "Da Cuna del Daiqueri"
 [the cradle of the Daiqueril and explain a
 little sadly: "It seemed all wrong to keep
 wearing the gold brooches-with customers
 coming in with open-neck shirts."
 Like the , taximan who jerks his thumb
 toward the building that housed the U.S.
 Embassy and says reassuringly: "I tell you
 frankly,, senor, the Yanquis will be back in
 there 12 months from now."
 But when you hope it will be nice for him
 he adds, apologetically: "Ah senior, I am
 leaving soon with my family for Florida."
 Through all of this the Cubans have re-
 tained their infinite capacity for courtesy
 and friendliness.
 In many visits to Cuba I have never once
 been treated with discourtesy-despite being
 taken much of the time for an American.
 The same applied on this occasion, even
 though I tried to buy American magazines.
 The shelves were stacked high with Mao
 and Lenin, and a flood of Communist-bloc
 literature.
 From the harbor wall where boys still cast
 for snapper, I looked back before leaving on
 a city that has worn itself out.
 Russians move in by the thousands; but
 the heady fervor of rebellion has spent its
 force.
 For  Havana,  3  years  and  7  months
 later, the "Barbudos" (bearded ones] are but
 a memory of what might have been.
 Nothing is left now but the soldiers * * *
 and the slogans * * * and everywhere the

 GROWING  TURMOIL  IN  LATIN  AMERICA-ARE
 REDS WINNING?
 (Reported from Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro,
 Caracas, and Lima)
 The Minister of Economics of Argentina,
 Alvaro Alsogaray, gave this gloomy picture of
 the outlook for his country on August 16:
 "If there is no, political stability, if every
 day we are threatened by coups d'etat, if at
 every moment we are fearful that blood is to
 be shed among Argentines * * * if we look
 more like an anarchical state than an or-
 ganized country, then this system of modern
 free economy with a social distribution of
 wealth fails at its base, and cannot work.
 "We cannot attract capital under the per-
 manent threat of revolutions."
 What Alsogaray said of Argentina is basi-
 cally the case of virtually every one of the
 'South American nations.

 this half of the hemisphere are getting much
 of the blame-or credit.
 Leaders of some democratic governments,
 on the defensive, are blaming Mr. Kennedy's
 Alliance for Progress for many of their trou-
 bles.  They say that the Alliance has raised
 false hopes of quick solutions to problems
 rooted deep in centuries of backwardness.
 Actually, the seeds of change were taking
 root in Latin America long before the Ken-
 nedy program began, long before Fidel Cas-
 tro's  Communists  took  over  Cuba                                                                                 and
 reached out toward South America.
 Whatever the cause, there is no doubt that
 the 10 countries of this continent are up
 against  political  turmoil generated   deep
 down at the grass roots.
 A crisis of authority is paralyzing govern-
 ments.                                                                               They  are  fighting  resistance  to
 change by entrenched cliques of wealthy
 landowners and      bankers.   They  are also
 fighting off  Communists  and  their  allies
 who are demanding extreme solutions.
 It is now a year since the Alliance for
 Progress went into operation.    In that year
 only 3 of 10 South American countries-
 Bolivia, Chile and Colombia-have produced
 long-range development  plans  as  agreed.
 And there is little sign of the reforms in
 education, taxes and land distribution which
 are considered essential to the Alliance.
 The shape and extent of the challenge
 rising from angry people becomes clear in a
 survey of what Is happening inside each
 country.
 Argentine paralysis: Argentina is almost
 at a standstill.  The most advanced country
 on this continent, Argentina is almost para-
 lyzed by a running battle among its military
 leaders over what to do about a threatened
 comeback by the followers of Juan D. Perlin,
 the dictator ousted in 1955.
 The new Argentine President Josh Maria
 Guido, has barely survived a military crisis
 that brought his country to the brink of
 civil war.  It was the second such crisis in
 his 5 months of office.  More trouble lies
 ahead.
 Military men took over last March when
 President Arturo Frondizi lifted a ban on
 the Peronists, who promptly staged a star-
 tling comeback in state and congressional
 elections.   Guido,  then  Senate President,
 succeeded Frondizi.   But the real power lies
 in the hands of the military men, and they
 are divided.
 The military promise elections next year,
 but Per6n's men, they say, will be barred
 from running candidates. Whoever wins will
 thus be caught in the same tug of war
 between the armed forces and Peronists,
 Who dominate labor unions.
 In the meantime, things are going from
 bad  to  worse  in  Argentina.  Exports  are
 crippled by a meat packers' strike.   Living
 costs are shooting up.  The peso is sinking
 in value.  Communists are making common
 cause with Per6n's followers.
 Brazil, Reds gaining:  The giant among
 South America nations, Brazil, is up against
 roaring inflation.  Communists are making
 such gains that many ordinary people in
 Brazil are beginning to echo the Reds' anti-
 United States line.
 President Joao   Goulart presides over a
 weak and divided Government.  He wants to
 do away  with  the present  parliamentary
 system which weakens presidential powers
 by sharing them with a prime minister. But
 the political issues are  blurred, executive
 discontent is rising and
 talent is limited

 President Kennedy have asserted that the

 yesterday neither had chosen to implement
 it; both have relied instead upon the so-
 called machinery of the inter-American se-
 curity system.
 That is, the U.S. Government has put its
 trust in the hope that others will act rather
 than in acting itself.  Where once a weak
 nation was bold enough to put its shield
 over the other nations of the hemisphere, a
 strong nation has hoped that its weak neigh-

 danger on its own doorstep.

 President Kennedy has issued a statement
 saying that the Castro government of Cuba
 will not be permitted to extend its in$uence
 further in the Western Hemisphere and
 strongly implied that the United States will
 stand by its doctrine of 140 years ago.
 Just .2 years-in July 1960-Mr. Khru-
 shchev said the Monroe Doctrine was dead.
 The President of the United States says it is
 still alive.  Now the problem today, as it
 was in the days of Imperial Russia, Is for the

 CUBA AND MONROE DOCTRINE
 (By William H. Stringer)
 WASHINGTON.-At  his  last  news  confer-
 ence President Kennedy was asked point-
 blank what the Monroe Doctrine meant to
 him in the light of world conditions and
 Cuba. He replied that it meant the same as
 it has since President Monroe and John
 Quincy Adams enunciated it.
 Yet there have been changes.  Originally
 the Monroe Doctrine was a unilateral warn-
 ing by the United States that European
 powers must not "extend their system" to
 any portion of the Western Hemisphere.
 The doctrine told czarist Russia to stop en-
 croaching in the Pacific Northwest.  It ad-
 vised France to quit Mexico in 1865.
 Since   the   good-neigh or   policy,   the
 United States has sought more and more to
 enlist all of the hemisphere's states in the
 defense of hemispheric integrity. The Rio
 Treaty  of 1947 refined encroachments to
 include     an  aggression which  is not    an
 armed   attack." At  1962,s Punta del Este
 conference the Organization of American
 States aimed ,ihe broadened doctrine, albeit
 mildly, at Castro's Luba, declaring his re-
 gime to be "incompatible" with the Ameri
 .can system.
 The United States has sought to set in
 motion events that will eventually topple
 Fidel  Castro-embargoing  Cuban  trade,
 talking up the Castro menace throughout
 artillery,  and  communications  equipment,
 plus supplies for a floundering economy?
 The Kremlinologists constantly remind us
 that Moscow seldom acts from a single
 motive.     We have two explanations for the
 Soviet move.     One is that Moscow cannot
 afford, in terms of world prestige, to see its
 Cuban ally collapse in economic chaos.  This
 would be no advertisement for communism.
 Ergo, Moscow must sail to the rescue, and
 with sufficient military equipment to make
 Senor Castro invulnerable to internal revolt
 or small-scale amphibious attack.
 The other explanation is that Moscow sees
 a way to make big trouble, close to home, for
 the United States; sees a chance to fortify a
 base for revolution that can reach out to
 all of Latin America; sees an opportunity to
 build a technological redoubt which can even
 track U.S. space  experiments from Cape
 Canaveral.
 Actually, the weighty probability is that
 both explanations will prove true.  Having
 moved in to save the Cuban economy, Pre-
 mier Khrushchev will exploit his leasehold
 to the full.
 The question facing President Kennedy is
 what Moscow's boosted intervention will do
 to the "peace and safety" of the United
 States, which the original Monroe Doctrine
 was summoned up to protect.
 Cuba as a creaking semi-Communist state
 was no great menace.  Cuba as a Soviet-
 bloc state so heavily armed as to shift the
 military power balances in Latin America is
 a much bigger menace.
 But if Cuba ever came to mean, to Pre-
 r tier Khrushchev or 'anyone else, that the
 United States, for fear of nuclear conse-
 quences,  would  hesitate  to  act  when  its
 peace and safety" was threatened, then this
 would be the biggest peril of all.
 This latter prospect was directly implicit

 NATO  GOES  CUBAN,  MOVES  RED  CARGO
 The current mass shipment of food, arms,
 and technical equipment from the Soviet
 bloc to Cuba has been accomplished with the
 aid of some of the closest allies of the United
 States in the North Atlantic Treaty Organ-
 ization.  Shipowners in Britain, Norway, and
 Greece, among  other  countries  supplied
 most of the tonnage running to Havana and
 other Cuban ports.  The "emergency" ship-
 ments were made necessary by Cuba's failure
 to provide enough of the necessities of life for
 her people, under the present Communist
 system.   President Kennedy disclosed that
 the United States had discussed the Cuban
 shipping excursions by NATO country ship-
 owners and said he would make every effort
 to have them curtailed.
 .The move by our allies to ship Communist
 supplies to Cuba is considered a direct con-
 tradiction of NATO policy, which is to stand
 firm against the Communist menace.  Any
 weakening of this structure could have severe
 repercussions to the Western World.

 Higgins had so succinctly put it in her
 latest column "is not whether the So-
 viet-supplied missiles are offensive or
 defensive or whether Soviet officers are
 in Bermuda shorts rather than battle
 gear," but whether or not our policy of
 hesitation and restraint is not encourag-
 ing the Soviets to press harder.
 The same sentiments, in effect, were
 expresed by Robert Frost on his return
 from the Soviet Union, when he said:
 Khrushchev said he feared for U.S. mod-
 ern liberals.  He said we were too liberal to
 fight.  I  suppose  he  thought  we'd  stand
 there the next hundred years saying, "On
 the one hand; but on the other hand."
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD the perceptive article by Mar-
 guerite Higgins.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 RUFFIANSHIP VERSUS RESTRAINT
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 WASHINGTON.-The key issue in Cuba is
 not whether the Soviet-supplied missiles are
 offensive or defensive or whether Soviet of-
 ficers are in Bermuda shorts rather than
 battle gear.  The issue is whether American
 policies  of  so-called  restraint  tempt  the
 Russians into putting on more pressure
 everywhere or whether U.S. restraint will be
 rewarded by Soviet restraint.
 So  far,      President  Kennedy,  with,    of
 course, the most honorable of motives, has
 most often taken the advice of those officials
 who counseled caution even at the price of
 letting the Russians get away with a slice
 here and a slice there of the U.S. world
 position in areas ranging from the Far East
 to central Europe to the Caribbean.
 The President himself at a press confer-
 ence stated part of the rationale for this
 attitude by indicating that America had to
 be cautious in Cuba because action against
 the Communist incursions there might re-
 sult in Soviet counteractions in places like
 Berlin.
 But what a tragedy if, for example, the
 initial slowness of American reaction should
 prove one day to be the factor that de-
 cided Khrushchev to authorize a new- em of
 brinkmanship in Berlin by threatening to
 use the missiles newly emplaced along the
 Western air corridors to the city.
 And with a new crisis boiling up, it seems
 important to' bring to the surface what has
 been known for several months to insiders in
 Washington.   This  is  that  Americans  of
 great stature, both in and out of Govern-
 ment, Democrats as well as Republicans, are
 now asking whether President Kennedy will
 preside over the decline of America as a.great
 power.
 Perhaps this seems unduly  alarmist  at
 a time when America is so psychologically
 attuned that headlines give greater atten-
 tion to  a  "satisfactory  conversation"                                                                                                                               be-

 than to dispatches from Berlin saying that
 Russians have riddled an American military
 car with 40 machinegun bullets.
 But  nonetheless  the  question  is  being
 asked and soon, it can be predicted, will be
 put on the public record because the men
 involved know that the issues are too cru-
 cial to go undebated.
 Indeed, some of President Kennedy's ad-
 visers most closely connected with the Berlin
 situation feel that in the coming months
 the United States is risking the most seri-
 ous-and needless-confrontation with the
 Russians in Berlin because this country-
 not just in Europe but also in Cuba and
 elsewhere-has not faced up to the possi-

 But if the Senator from New York
 was doing more than speculating, if he
 knows of a deal involving a "horse
 trade" on Cuba and Berlin, that is a
 completely different matter.  I am sure
 that the Senator from New, 'ork, would
 agree that this is critical .inf,'ormation
 of the greatest importance to the Na-
 tion.  I am sure, too, that the Senator
 from New York would agree further that
 the President should also have access
 to this critical information and its
 source, since the President, beyond talk-
 ing or speculating, has the responsi-
 bility for decisions involving the very
 lives of Americans with respect both to
 Berlin and -Cuba, as well as elsewhere.
 So I would ask the Senator from New
 York, whether or not he, has specific
 information that a deal is being worked
 out, or is even being seriously contem-
 plated, involving some kind of trade as
 between the situations in Berlin and
 Cuba; and, if so, can he give the Senate
 the details and his source of informa-
 tion?
 Mr. KEATING.  Mr. President, I ap-
 preciate the remarks of the distinguished
 Senator from Montana, our majority
 leader, whom we all deeply respect.
 The news account to which he has re-
 ferred, referred to a television program
 in Buffalo, in which I was very careful
 to say that the linking of Cuba and
 Berlin as a deal was a rumor which was
 prevalent in Washington; and I am sure
 the distinguished majority leader has
 not in these remarks for the first time
 heard-the rumor that such a deal might
 be made.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, at
 this point will the Senator from New
 York yield?
 Mr. KEATING.  I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I must admit in all
 honesty that I have never heard of a
 "deal" being made relative to a combina-
 tion of matters affecting Cuba and Berlin.
 Of course I have heard the President and
 Members on this floor,  the present
 Speaker  included,  in  discussing  the
 Cuban situation, mention the fact that
 the responsibilities of the President were
 worldwide in nature; in addition to hav-
 ing to keep an eye on Cuba, he also had
 to watch conditions in Berlin, in south-
 east Asia, in the Middle East, in Africa,
 and in the Far East, in the region of
 Formosa, as well. There are other points
 which could be mentioned.
 But I must admit-and I say this most
 sincerely-that I have never heard of any
 kind of "deal" which would affect the in-
 terrelationship of Berlin and Cuba, inso-
 far as the policy of our President is
 concerned.
 Mr. KEATING.  Of course, Mr. Pres-
 ident, I accept as a fact the statement of
 the majority leader.
 If the word "deal" were not used, per-
 haps the majority leader has previously
 heard the rumor that these were all part
 and parcel of one proposal.
 Perhaps it would clarify the situation
 to include following my remarks excerpts
 from such respected publications as U.S.

 these two articles be printed at this point
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the two ar-
 ticles were ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD" as follows:
 [From V.S. News & World'Iteport]
 Wax over Cuba, involving the United States
 with Russia, is moving closer, now that the
 'Soviets have an advanced military base just
 oft the coast of Florida.
 President Kennedy, on aeptember 7, asked
 Congress for authority to call up to 150,000
 reservists.  Main reason: The Russians' move
 into Cuba.
 Soviet submarines, based on Cuba, are ex-
 pected soon to lie athwart strategic lifelines
 of the United States to the Panama Canal, to
 the oil and raw materials of South America,
 ready to help Castro's Reds move. to the
 mainland.
 Missile-carrying Soviet submarines, based
 on Cuba, would threaten U.S. cities.  Cuba,
 military leaders say, is an ideal base for high-
 accuracy missiles that can cover the heart of
 the United States,
 In late 1959,, long before the armed power
 of the, Soviet Union moved into Cuba, Sam-
 uel Flagg Bemis, professor of diplomatic
 history and inter-American relations at Yale
 University, wrote an article for U.S. News &
 World Report.  Professor Bemis, an out-
 standing authority in his field, warned that
 Communist power established in the Carib-
 bean could "tip the balance of power fatally
 against the United States in the present
 deadly crisis of power and politics which
 we call the 'cold war.' "
 With Cuba as a Soviet base, the United
 States suddenly finds itself engaged with
 threats from the four points of the compass-
 from Cuba on the s uth and along the Atlan-
 tic seaboard, from Russia against Berlin and
 Western Europe on the east, from Russia over
 the North Pole, from Russia and Red China
 to the west. Mr. Bemis warned in 1959 that
 "we simply cannot allow that to happen."
 Now that it has happened and that the
 Soviets are involving the United States on a
 fourth front, the' whole problem of Cuba is
 taking an a new dimension-one that admit-
 tedly is far more dangerous to the security
 of the United States than at any time in
 ,the past.
 A POLICY` THAT, FAILED
 Soviet power, now firmly planted in the
 Caribbean, marks the collapse of a U.S. policy
 followed since Cuban exiles were allowed
 to invade Castro's Cuba without air cover or
 support in 1961.
 American policy, up to this month, had
 been "to allow Cuba to wither on the vine."
 U.S. officials talked until recent days of iso-
 lating Cuba.
 The idea at the highest level of the Ken-
 East. Chinese Communist will move, against
 Formosa or prod North Koreans to move into
 South Korea.
 With Khrushchev of Russia and Mao of
 Red China working together during a Cuban
 showdown, the United States could find it-
 self swinging in all directions.
 Cuba under Soviet domination is described
 by military  men as throwing the United
 States off balance.
 SOVIET BUILDUP
 Armed forces within Cuba are gaining sub-
 stantial strength.
 President Kennedy himself,, on September
 4, reported that the Russians without doubt
 have put ground-to-air missiles similar to
 the early U.S. Nike-Ajax into Cuba.   Mr.
 Kennedy also confirmed that there are now
 Soviet-made torpedo boats with ship-to-ship
 guided missiles in Cuba.
 In addition, Castro has at least 60 opera-
 tional Mig fighters, Soviet-made tanks and
 Russian 122-millimeter artillery plus other
 guns in quantity, modern antiaircraft guns,
 considerable numbers of Soviet jeeps and
 trucks, quantities of radar and other elec-
 tronic  equipment.   Small arms, including
 the latest machineguns from Communist
 Czechoslovakia and ammunition for such
 arms, have been supplied in quantity.
 Main factor in Soviet aid, as confirmed by
 the President's statement, is a minimum of
 3500 Russians, described by British news-
 n}en in Cuba who saw them as "brawny
 young   men * * * tanned * * * fit   and
 constantly in training."  An eyewitness re-
 port by one of the British observers set the
 number of these Russians at "from 5,000 to
 8,000."
 , Senator KENNETH B. KEATING, Republican,
 of New York, said that there were 5,000 Rus-
 sian  troops-not  technicians-already  in
 Cuba.
 Such doubly confirmed reports, differing
 only as to the number which admittedly is
 growing day by day as Soviet freighters and
 personnel carriers arrive in Cuba, appear to
 be in  line with earlier reports of Khru-
 shchev's  personal  pledge  to  Raul  Castro,
 brother of Fidel, It supposedly was made
 to Raill on his visit to Russia some months
 ago.
 The Cuban, Defense Minister in his broth-
 er's dictatorship, asked Khrushchev to take
 Cuba into protection of the Warsaw Pact
 grouping.  Khrushchev is said to have re-
 plied:  "I will do better than that.  I will
 send Russians to Cuba."
 There are no reliable reports as yet that
 nuclear  warheads  or  long-range  missiles
 capable of delivering them on U.S. cities
 have been placed in Cuba.  Chances are, ex-
 perts say, that Khrushchev would insist on
 keeping such weapons aboard Russia's nu-
 clear submarines, which, however, could use
 Cuban bases.

 WHAT IT WILL TAKE
 Congressional leaders, by September                     7.
 were agreed it might take U.S. military ac-
 tion in Cuba to remove the threat to U.S.
 security.  Republican leaders urged legisla-
 tion giving Mr. Kennedy authority to make
 what military move he deemed necessary.
 It was then that the President asked au-
 thority to call 150,000 reservists.
 If it comes to a fight to oust Castro's
 dictatorship,  the  conflict  may  be  bloody.
 U.S. soldiers in Cuba would find themselves
 up against not just Cuban Reds, but Rus-
 sians too.
 War over Cuba, discounted by administra-
 tion leaders until recent weeks, has been
 brought closer by Khrushchev's act of mov-
 ing Soviet arms and military men into an
 island of the Americas.

 ALL TRAFFIC HARASSING EXPECTED;  1961 NOTE
 WARNED UNITED STATES ON CUBA
 (By Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott)
 The East Germans are expected to soon be-
 gin harrassing the allies' Berlin air traffic
 with    newly  installed  electronic  counter
 equipment.
 These electronic devices, similar to those
 being installed in  Cuba,  are showing up
 along the three air corridors linking West
 Berlin to West Germany.
 U.S. Intelligence estimates warn that the
 ECE stations are being readied to blockade
 the corridors by jamming the guidance con-
 trol systems of allied aircraft flying into the
 big Templehof Airfield in West Berlin.
 By really intensive use of these and other
 methods, the East Germans, if backed by the
 Soviets, can effectively block the corridors
 according to U.S. military experts.  Planes
 flying these airlanes because of bad weather
 in the fall and winter months must depend
 about  80  percent  of  the  time  on radio
 guidance from ground control stations.
 Already the Soviet puppet East German
 regime is preparing to justify this warlike
 takeover by listing  the corridors  as East
 Germbn    Republic  airlanes  in  documents
 circulated to all countries recognizing the
 Communist government.
 Copies of these explosive documents, ob-
 tained by U.S. intelligence agents are being
 carefully examined for their full significance
 by State Department experts on East Ger-
 man-Soviet affairs.
 One opinion of these experts is that Soviet
 Premier Khrushchev is planning to use the
 East Germans to touch off a brandnew war
 of nerves over West Berlin to determine if
 the United States will stand firm.
 Also that Khrushchev will link the East
 German blockade of the  corridors closely
 with the use of ECE measures against U.S.
 planes flying over and around Cuba.
 THE SECRET NOTE
 Although the communication was never
 made public, Khrushchev sent a blunt note
 to President Kennedy in April 1961 threat-
 ening West Berlin if the United States used
 troops against Cuba.   This alarming note
 was delivered to the White House on the
 weekend before the ill-fated Cuban invasion.
 A congressional source, who  knows the
 whole story about the note, says that it
 scared McGeorge Bundy, the chief foreign
 policy adviser in the White House, into pre-
 vailing on the President to call off U.S. air
 strikes. planned to help the Cuban rebels
 bomb out Castro's air force on the invasion
 eve.
 This could explain why such a note was
 not made public-because it would make

 I again express my gratitude to the
 Senator from Montana for the manner
 straight on any occasion when such a
 .situation was placed before him.
 r.  E. i TNG: 'Whe-n'I received a call
 from the Secretary of State this morn-
 ing, that is exactly what I said to him-
 that a statement by the President or the
 are not part and parcel of one transac-
 tion, to be traded off against each other,
 would be the very best way to set the
 record straight. I still think it would be.
 But the fact that the distinguished ma-
 jority leader has made this statement on
 the floor gives me great confidence that
 that is the situation.
 Let me further say that I recollect
 when I approached the State Depart-
 ment in mid-August asking for a report
 on the Soviet landings, I received, after
 2 weeks, a reply that was so uninforma-
 tive as to be virtually useless.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. KEATING. I yield.
 Mr. MORSE.  I am pleased that the
 Senator from New York has had this
 colloquy with the majority leader grow-
 ing out of the telecast program that he
 has already -explained to the Senate;
 but I would like to make these comments,
 if he would permit me to do so, apropos
 his observations.
 I assure the Senator from New York
 that President Kennedy does not barter
 freedom. Freedom is not for barter, and
 It would be unthinkable that President
 Kennedy for a moment would relate Ber-
 lin and Cuba for negotiating purposes in-
 any negotiations with Russia.
 As chairman of the Subcommittee on
 Latin American Affairs, I want to say
 that the President of the United States
 has no intention whatsoever of linking
 the two in any negotiation, because the
 two could not be linked without just
 such ugly rumors as the Senator said he
 heard arising in Washington-namely,
 that the President of the United States
 is bartering freedom.
 I would have us all remember that in
 the very critical situation involving Cuba
 there must be complete unity among us
 in supporting the right arm of the Pres-
 ident of the United States. In the very
 delicate and difficult crises that exist
 around the world, it is very easy, I think,
 in the field of semantics, to link Cuba
 and Berlin; but they are urilinkable in
 that each crisis involves its own set of
 facts.
 I say to the Senator from New York
 and the American people that they can
 rest assured that the President of the
 United States does not trade off freedom
 in any negotiation in any field of for-
 eign policy.
 My subcommittee is maintaining very
 close contact with this administration.
 For example, Monday afternoon at 4:30,
 we are to have a conference with the
 United States Ambassador to the Or-
 ganization  of  American  States,  Am-
 bassador Morrison.  Tomorrow, we will
 meet with other State Department offi-
 cials on the same subject. As chairman
 of the subcommittee, I have taken the
 position from the very beginning of this
 crisis that we must be kept informed
 with regard to what is going on. I think
 we are.  The Senator from New York
 and the American people can rest as-
 sured that these crises are being con-
 sidered in their separable, individual na-
 tures. and they are not being considered
 in any negotiating package. Let me as-
 sure the Senator from New York of that

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                    17883
 The Senator will share my point of
 view that the time has come when we
 must ascertain the position of our as-
 sociates in the Western Hemisphere,
 members of the Organization of Ameri-
 can States, as to what the course of
 action should be, if there is to be joint
 action, in regard to the threat of the
 establishment of a Russian-Communist
 beachhead in Cuba.  I think there is
 grave danger that such a beachhead
 might very well be established.
 One of the most delicate problems we
 have-it is very risky even to comment
 on it publicly, but it should be com-
 mented on-is the problem involving the
 Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine
 is not dead, but I do not think the Mon-
 roe Doctrine is the doctrine it was when
 it was first established by the United
 States, or when we enforced it 50 or 75
 years ago.  In part-and note my lan-
 guage-it was established in order to
 guarantee to our neighbors to the south
 of us that we would protect them, as
 well as ourselves, from any possible over-
 running of them, or any one of them, by
 a foreign power.
 We carried that out, although, as we
 know, the historians have written that
 in the early decades we carried it out
 through the British fleet. After all, our
 great ally, Great Britain, enforced the
 Monroe Doctrine for a good many years,
 in that other foreign nations knew if
 they sought to exercise any extraterrito-
 rial ambitions over Latin America we
 would stand firm on the Monroe Doc-
 trine but., the Monroe Doctrine would,
 in those days, be enforced by the British
 fleet.
 y A great many changes have occurred
 since the initiation of the Monroe Doc-
 trine.  For example, the section which
 declares that we will not become involved
 in European affairs is a completely dead
 letter. Insofar as it relates to this hem-
 isphere, it is a two-pronged doctrine;
 and let us never forget it. It is a doc-
 trine in which we made clear that from
 the standpoint of our Own national se-
 curity we did not propose to have for-
 eign powers  establish extraterritorial
 rights in the Western Hemisphere. But
 we also said we were opposed to that
 because we were going to protect our
 neighbors to the south who, in that time
 of history, were exceedingly weak na-
 tions and could have been easily over-
 run if they could not rely upon their
 great neighbor to the north to come to
 their defense and assistance if necessary.
 In our conferences in Latin.America
 for some time past we? have found that
 the' attitude of. our Latin American
 friends today in some instances is not
 the attitude they adopted at the time
 the Monroe Doctrine was first initiated.
 This is a delicate subject, but some of
 them have taken the position-and it
 is well recognized-that any carrying out
 of any policy of the Monroe Doctrine
 as originally contemplated by the United
 States, so far as Latin American coun-
 tries are concerned, would have to be
 done with their complete consent, co-
 operation, and association.  In other,
 words the Latin Americans question the
 right of the tfinited States to take the
 position that It
 can say to any foreign
 power, ""Your relationships with country
 X, Y, or Z in Latin America are going
 to be', determined by the United States."
 So we enter into areas of conflict,
 which require the exercise of very,deli-
 cate diplomacy.
 During World War II, we negotiated
 a series of treaties and declarations by
 Western  Hemisphere  nations  which
 sought to make incursions by Axis Pow-
 ers into the hemisphere the subject of
 combined opposition and resistance by
 the signatories.
 We sought, in other words, to en-
 force the Monroe Doctrine not unilater-
 ally, but through hemispheric action.
 That Is how we changed the concept
 of the Monroe Doctrine during World
 War II relative to the German-Italian
 Japanese axis.
 Since then, we have done much the
 same', thing relative to communism. We
 have held a series of conferences in an
 effort to keep communism out of this
 hemisphere not simply as U.S. policy and
 by U.S. action but as a policy and action
 of the OAS.
 I do not know of any country which
 signed the act of Punta del Este which
 would not want to cooperate with us
 in stemming the establishment of com-
 munism in Latin America by way either
 of a beachhead in Cuba or of a Com-
 munist taking over of X, Y, or Z country
 in ' Latin America, for there is a recog-
 nition that if that should happen in
 Latin America to one country, or to two
 or three, it could very well extend
 through the hemisphere.
 !'here have been in the press some
 rather excited editorials whose writers
 have 1 not taken into account that the
 Monroe Doctrine today is not the Mon-
 roe Doctrine established by President
 Monroe, because of these changes in the
 attitude of some of our Latin Ameri-
 can friends in regard to the applicability
 of the Monroe Doctrine to certain types
 of facts now. I only mention it in pass-
 ing in this discussion, because it ought
 to be noted in the RECORD.
 So' the senior Senator from Oregon
 believes  our  subcommittee  ought to
 know what is going on within the
 Organization of American States and
 within the council of the Organization
 of American States. To that end I asked
 Ambassador Morrison this morning if he
 would make himself available to give us
 a very informal executive briefing in re-
 gard; to the Organization of American
 States, as we have a right to ask.  He
 has the privilege of giving it or of not
 giving it.  I am sure he will give it.
 We have asked officials of the State
 Department-either the Secretary of
 State or the Assistant Secretary of State
 for Latin American Affairs-to give us a
 briefing tomorrow in regard to this whole
 issue vis-a-vis Cuba. and other Latin
 American states.
 I appreciate the generosity of the
 Senator from New York in letting me
 make these comments at this length. I
 am about through.  I felt that in the
 midst of this colloquy with the majority
 leader I owed it to my administration
 to in ake the statements I made.
 close by saying that I want the
 I
 American people to know that they have
 every reason to place complete faith in
 the President of the United States, ir-
 respective of their partisanship relative
 to this Cuban crisis, for the President
 of the United States has not placed Cuba
 and Berlin on the barter market.
 The President is seeking to defend
 freedom both in Cuba and in Berlin on
 the basis of the facts involved in each
 crisis, and they are different in some re-
 spects.  The coinmon objective is not
 different; it is our policy in both places
 that freemen are not to be Overridden by
 communism without American support
 of freemen. _ We intend to support free-
 dom where freemen are willing to stand
 up and fight for freedom.
 Mr. KEATING.  Mr. President, it is
 very heartening to have this additional
 assurance from the distinguished Sen-
 ator from Oregon, who acts as the chair-
 man of the important subcommittee
 dealing, with Latin American affairs of
 the Committee on Foreign Relations, and
 to hear from his lips the assertion that
 no effort will be made to relate Berlin
 to Cuba in connection with any negotia-
 tions.
 I hope that when the President Is
 asked again' about the situation he will
 make that very clear.  If he is going
 to say that the United States has obliga-
 tions all around the world, including
 West Berlin and other areas, and if he
 is going to say that the Cuban question
 must be considered as a part of the
 worldwide challenge posed by Commu-
 nist threats to the peace, then the very
 delineation which has been made by the
 Senator from Oregon might be' added, in
 order that it might be made perfectly
 clear to the American people-because
 I am sure that is what they want-that
 there is no negotiation as between these
 two situations, and there will be no con-
 cessions made on the one issue in order
 to get concessions on the other.
 I also wish to make it clear, knowing
 the President of the United States, hav-
 ing served with him, that there is not
 one doubt in my mind for a moment as
 to his intentions, his patriotism, or his
 desire to do the right thing under the
 circumstances.  If'these colloquies serve
 no other purpose, I hope they will serve
 the purpose of making it clear to the
 President's advisers that the Congress
 is behind the President in any decision
 which he may make'which is a firm one,
 a solid one, one in which interests are
 not paired off one against the other.
 I commend the Senator from Oregon
 for his action in trying to get' from the
 members of the Organization of Ameri-
 can States some information as to what
 their attitude will be.  That is very im-
 portant. 'We should make every effort to
 proceed in concert with our friends of the
 Latin  American  Republics.  When  I
 made four suggestions the other day, the
 second- suggestion was that we try to do
 that very thing. The Senator from Ore-
 gon is on the right track on that point.
 I must add one word about the Mon-
 roe Doctrine.  It is now undergoing a
 reinterpretation.  Before  the  Senator
 from Oregon came to the Chamber, the
 distinguished Senator from Connecticut
 (Mr. DODDI was speaking on that sub-'
 ject.  I think perhaps the Senator from
 Oregon did not hear him. The Senator
 from Connecticut said that if we say that

 And again: "With the existing colonies or
 dependencies of any European power we have
 not interfered and shall not interere."
 This resolve on our part to refrain from
 participating in the affairs of Europe is a
 dead letter. But what of that section of the
 Monroe Doctrine relating to the Western
 Hemisphere?   It declared,  and  I quote:
 "That the American continents, by the free
 and independent condition which they have
 assumed and maintain, are henceforth not
 to be considered as subjects for future colon-
 ization by any European                                                                                                                                              powers."  And
 again: "But with the governments who have
 declared their independence and maintained
 it, and whose independence we have,    on
 great consideration and just principles, ac-
 knowledged, we could not view any inter-
 position for the purpose of oppressing them,
 or controlling in any other manner their
 destiny by any European power in any other
 light than as the manifestation of an un-
 friendly  disposition  toward  the  United
 States."
 The 1962 Declaration of Punta del Este
 was a much better restatement of the Mon-
 roe Doctrine than the  Olney dispatch of
 1895.
 The United States is no longer "practically
 sovereign" in the Western Hemisphere.
 Our relations with Latin America have
 been radically altered by two revolutionary
 changes since the end of World War IL  The
 first of these has been the emergence of the
 United States from the confines of the Mon-
 roe Doctrine  than the Olney dispatch                                                                                                                                        of
 ening of our foreign policy horizon from
 regionalism to globalism.  The global com-
 mitments incurred by, or thrust upon, the
 United States In the late forties constituted
 a revolution in American foreign policy-a
 revolution, in the words of Prof. Hans Mor-
 genthau,  that  marked                                                                                                                                               "the  permanent
 assumption by the United States of responsi-
 bilities beyond the limits of the Western
 Hemisphere."
 The second great change has been the
 emergence of Latin America into the main-
 stream of world history, or, more precisely,
 the awakening of the long-quiescent peoples
 of Latin America to the great social forces-
 communism, democracy, and, above all, na-
 tionalism-that in our time have aroused
 all the people of the non-European world.
 Thus it may be said that while the United
 States has emerged from isolation to join
 and lead a worldwide community of wealthy
 and long-established democratic states, the
 nations of Latin America have emerged from
 isolation to join the new countries of Asia
 and Africa not in a community but in a
 common revolution.  It is a revolution con-
 ceived in economic deprivation and political
 humiliator, nurtured by the force of na-
 tonalism and soaring hopes of economic ad-
 vance, and dedicated to the goal of securing
 for themselves decent, dignified, and reward-
 ing lives as modern nations.
 Both the United States and the Latin
 American Republics came into their new
 roles with unresolved dilemmas and anoma-
 lies.  The ambiguity for the United States
 was its failure until very recently to adjust
 the regionalism of the Monroe Doctrine to
 the new globalism of the problems that con-
 front W.
 While we spent billions to rebuild Europe,
 and more billions to help the new nations of
 Asia and Africa, we said to Latin America:
 "We are not going to help you, and under
 the Monroe Doctrine, we are not going to
 let anyone else help you, either."
 Latin America came into the modern world
 afflicted with an even greater dilemma-the
 deep contradiction between the language of
 democracy and progress, and the reality of
 oligarchy and reaction that have conditioned
 the political life of Latin America since the

 "Democracy," said Benito Juarez a cen-
 tury ago, "is the destiny of future human-
 ity."  But the history of Latin America has,
 with rare exceptions, belied that destiny and
 an angry and aroused generation of Latin
 Americans now demands an end to the an-
 cient hypocrisy and immediate efforts on
 the. part of their governments to achieve per-
 formances that ,match their promises.
 The Mexican writer andl diplomat Octavio
 Paz  (currently in the Office of External
 Affairs, Mexico City), expressed the basic
 contradiction incisively in an essay on the
 character of his country.  "The liberal and
 democratic ideology;' he wrote, "far from
 expressing our concrete historical situation,
 obscured it. The political lie installed itself
 almost constitutionally among our coun-
 tries.  The moral damage has been incal-
 culable and reaches into deep layers of our
 character.  Lies are something we move in
 with ease.  During more than a hundred
 years we have suffered regimes of brute force,
 which were at the service of feudal oligar-
 chies, but utilized the language of liberty."
 Such considerations as these-too briefly
 defined-condition the relations between the
 United States and Latin America in the
 1960's.  The problem for' both the United
 States and Latin America is to devise a hem-
 isphere policy in a global context.  I should
 like now to examine some of the elements
 that might comprise such a policy.
 The basic policy of the United States to-
 ward Latin America today is to foster both
 security and progress in the shortest pos-
 sible time.  The Alliance for Progress has
 belatedly been recognized as a vital modern
 implementation  of the Monroe Doctrine,
 along with the establishment of the Or-
 ganization of American States, and the dec-
 larations that first ,nazism and later com-
 munism have no rightful place in the inter-
 American system.
 The success of the Alliance for Progress,
 given the explosive social forces at work in
 Latin America today and our woefully be-
 lated willingness to come to grips with them,
 is problematical.  Its conception and intent,
 however, are wisely attuned to the realities
 of the 1960's, to the need for a hemisphere
 policy in a global context.
 The Alliance for Progress represents for
 the United States a new form of "interven-
 tion," an intervention in depth to cope with
 deeply rooted social and economic ills of
 Latin America. Before commenting on some
 of its problems and prospects, I should like
 to reexamine briefly the traditional concepts
 of intervention and nonintervention in re-
 lation to the new forces at work in Latin
 America.
 Today's problem of nonintervention, sim-
 ply stated, is whether the Organization of
 American States can or cannot intervene in
 the affairs of one of its member states in
 order to forestall intervention from beyond
 the American, continents that threatens the
 security of the entire hemisphere.
 The question is a simple one but any
 answer to it is enormously complicated by
 the fact that to the Latin Americans "inter-
 vention" is not an abstract, concept but an
 historical  experience  deriving  principally
 from their relations with the United States.
 It is not difficult to- understand that, for
 deeply rooted historical reasons, the Latin
 American reaction,to,Spviet intervention, in
 the hemisphere is conditioned, by the ex-
 perience of American Intervention,
 The attitude of the Latin Americans to-
 ward  intervention by  the United  States
 is by no means one of unambiguous hos-
 tility, as is widely believed.  It is rather an
 ambivalent attitude,. depending upon the
 cause for which intervention is undertaken.
 In recent years there has been a steady pro-
 cession of Latpg Coming to Washington to
 petition for U.S. assistance for overthrowing
 Batista or, Castro in Cuba, Trujillo in the
 Dominican Republic, or some other Latin
 American ruler.  To these exiles-of whom
 the most conspicuous at present are the large
 number of refugees from Communist Cuba-
 the doctrine of nonintervention in itself has
 no appeal.  It is their contention that when
 we withhold assistance we are in effect in-
 tervening on the side of entrenched regimes.
 The ' United States is thus doubly damned,
 regardless of its acts or omissions, and I
 think that those well-meaning persons who
 suffer excessively from fiagellations of con-
 science over our deviations from noninter-
 vention would do well to face up to the fact
 that the United States cannot avoid playing
 a major, and often decisive, role in the af-
 fairs of the Latin American Republics.
 "The moral here," as one perceptive stu-
 dent of Latin American affairs recently put
 it, "is that a great power such as the United
 States necessarily intervenes in the affairs
 of'other countries, especially smaller ones,
 as much by what it does not do as by what
 it does. A policy of nonintervention, if that
 term is interpreted in the strictest, most
 liberal sense, becomes plainly impossible.
 The 'question, therefore, is not one of inter-
 vention or nonintervention per se, but of
 the ends and means of intervention.'
 Latin antipathy to intervention derives
 directly from the historical fact that most
 of the interventions of the past have been
 by the United States and for ends and by
 means that most Latins find objectionable.
 American  interventions,  it  is  widely  be-
 lieved-and not  altogether inaccurately-
 have' been designed to protect American busi-
 ness interests. Few Latin Americans are
 aware of the preeminently strategic consid-
 erations centering on the security of the
 Panama Canal that motivated the repeated
 interventions in Central America and the
 Caribbean in the first three decades of the
 20th century-the only large-scale sustained
 interventions in which the United States has
 engaged.
 An even more subtle ambivalence charac-
 terizes Latin American attitudes toward the
 problem  of  Communist  intervention      and
 subversion.  Most Latin American govern-
 ments are able at present to deal with the
 hard core of Moscow-trained Communists
 operating within their own frontiers.  Soviet
 intervention in  Cuba  is  another    matter.
 While  Castro  has    proclaimed      himself  a
 Marxist-Leninist, many Latin       Americans,
 persuaded that he has the support of the
 Cuban people, are disposed to accept his open
 espousal of Marxism as  an alarming but
 nonetheless legitimate exercise of the right of
 self-determination.   This  consideration  is
 coupled with the sensitivity and     fear  of
 many Latin American governments to wide-
 spread and volatile fidelista sentiment in
 their own countries.  One can express satis-
 faction, and even surprise, that the Punta del
 Este Conference went so far as to deprive
 Cuba of participation in the Organization of
 American States.
 The compelling question at this juncture
 is the degree to which the governments of
 Latin America are prepared to tolerate the
 efforts of the Castro regime to subvert the
 legitimate representative governments that
 now prevail in most of Latin America.  There
 can be no question that some progress was
 made at Punta del Este when shipments of
 arms and other  implements of war from
 Cuba to subversives in other countries of the
 to generate new attitudes toward interven-
 tion, more favorable in regard to the United
 States, and more realistic in regard to Cuba
 and the Soviet Union.
 The. Alliance for Progress and the Cuban
 revolution represent two forms of revolu-
 tion, which are engaged in a sustained con-
 test for prevalence throughout Latin Amer-
 -Ica.  The Cuban revolution aims to im-
 pose a new form of tyranny on the peoples
 of the American republics, by consent if pos-
 sible, by force, demagoguery, or subversion
 if necessary.  The Alliance aims to generate
 the means for creating a decent social and
 economic life for all Latin Americans under
 free institutions.
 It represents a new form of intervention in
 depth, designed to cope with ancient so-
 cial and economic ills and to recast the so-
 cieties of Latin America.  I should like, in
 the remainder of these remarks, to consider
 some of its problems and prospects.
 The basic problem of the Alliance for Prog-
 ress is to carry out a social revolution with
 due process of law.
 The social and economic problems that op-
 press Latin America are nothing less than
 staggering.  It is highly unlikely that even
 a generation of concerted effort will over-
 come Latin America's grievous mismanage-
 ment and entrenched selfish interests, its
 political factionalism and racial, class, and
 national animosities.  What is new in Latin
 America is not the existence of these an-
 cient evils but the eruption in recent years
 of massive forces of popular protest and so-
 cial discontent.
 The social and economic grievances of the
 Latins can be indicated by a few facts and
 figures:
 The fuedal land system created by the
 Spanish conquerors has persisted with some
 modifications  to the present day.  Three-
 fourths of all of the arable land in the en-
 tire continent is owned in the form of vast
 latifundia by 2 percent of the people. The
 result is the desperate "land hunger" of the
 millions of dispossessed.
 Industry and commerce, the mines,   oil
 fields, and  other  nonagricultural assets,
 when not owned by foreign capitalists, are
 dominated    by  a  small  oligarcy  of great
 great wealth, some of whom are also owners
 of latifundia.   Taking all forms of wealth
 together, it is estimated that 50 percent of
 it is owned by only 2 percent of the people.
 Over half of the people of Latin America
 are undernourished and over half are illiter-
 ate.  For lack of schools and teachers, mil-
 lions of children are deprived of even rudi-
 mentary formal education.
 With an average per capita income of only
 $289 a year, levels of material consumption
 are far below the minimum required for a
 decent life by even the lowest income groups
 of Western Europe or North America.
 In addition, Latin American is beset by a
 population explosion, with the result that
 per capita production of wealth has not only
 stopped growing but appears to be declining.
 Latin America's population, now 200 mil-
 lion, is increasing at a rate of about 2ii/ per-
 cent a year, the highest of any major region
 in the world.  Over 40 percent of the popula-
 tion is  under  15  years of  age,  with  the
 result that the economically productive por-
 tion of the population must support a greater
 inactive proportion than those supported in
 more advanced countries.
 OAS were embargoed.  Another measure to                 The Latin American  oligarchies bear  a
 forestall intervention from Cuba was the                heavy burden of responsibility for the grave
 setting up of a five-man committee of ex-               inequities of Latin American societies, al-
 perts on how to combat subversion.                                                                                               though the harshest and most violent ex-

 intolerable and Communist intervention with             inefficiently run and underproductive and
 indifference or only mild concern.  The Al-             land reform is probably the most explosive

 moving toward a center ground.
 Frost said that he could notice the hu-
 manizing of Soviet life in Russian poetry,
 "I said to them that you could tell from
 their poetry that they were humanizing a
 little down from the severity of their idea-
 easing off toward democracy.  They let me
 get away with It," he said.
 "I am not a Communist and I feel it quite
 hard to strain up to socialism.  I go slow
 about it.  I drag my feet.  But I have about
 decided that socialism is the only way to
 handle the billions being born now." Frost
 said.
 'I see that ahead, but I'll be dead by
 then.  I told the Russians that they're eas-
 ing down to socialism and we're straining up
 to it"
 Describing the 10-day visit as "the time
 of my life," Frost confirmed that Khrushchev
 gave him a message for President Kennedy
 during their talk.  He declined to say what
 it was.  Asked when he planned to see Mr.
 Kennedy, he said, "I don't plan, I wait for
 the President."
 Frost said he regretted that he referred
 to Khrushchev in a Moscow press conference
 as a ruffian.
 "I should have modified that a little and
 said rough and ready, not ruffian," he said.
 "Ruffian is a pretty strong word."
 Frost, who continued on by a connecting
 airline to his home in Cambridge, Mass., de-
 nied that he read his poem, "Mending Wall,"
 during his visit to embarrass the Russians
 about the wall in Berlin.
 "Everybody asks me for the poem," he
 explained.  "If I don't do it I get blamed."
 He did liken the concept of a wall to cur-
 rent Soviet-United States relations, how-
 ever.
 "All life is cellular," Frost said.  "Even the
 Communists have cells.  All cells are a mat-?
 ter of walls breaking down and renewing.
 "That's what happens after a war-new
 boundaries and a danger of new wars," Frost
 said.
 Frost who said he did not discuss Cuba
 with Khrushchev, was asked if he planned
 to return to the Soviet Union, where he
 went this time at Russian invitation.
 "Some day," he answered.  "I said I would
 be back when I got older and wiser."
 Mr. President, our no-win foreign
 policy is responsible for our plight today
 in Cuba, where a strong Communist mili-
 tary arsenal is being built to establish
 communism  firmly  throughout  the
 Western Hemisphere, and in Berlin,
 where we are being constantly squeezed
 by the Communists to get out and for-
 feit the Western World's greatest outpost
 of democracy-and possibly all of Ger-
 many.
 I have stated over and over again, Mr.
 President, that the American people
 must demand a change in our foreign
 and domestic policies if we are to win in
 this struggle which the forces of world
 communism have forced on us.  Many
 in this country-and many in this
 body-have bought the so-called so-
 phisticated approach to foreign policy
 and domestic policy on the basis that
 we must be modern in a modern world
 and that we must not provoke a nuclear
 holocaust in the atomic age.  We have
 found, however, Mr. President, that the
 "sophisticated" policies have brought us
