 "Rectification" in Communist China
 This study is a working paper, reflecting information
 received through December 1958.      The paper offers a full ac-
 count of Communist China's recent "rectification" campaign:
 the introductory phase ofe 1956 and early 1957, in which the
 Chinese Communist party set the objectives of improving its
 working style and bettering its relations with the masses,
 and encouraged outside criticism; the formal launching of
 the campaign in May 1957, a month in which the enthusiasm
 and scope of criticism gave the party a very disagreeable
 surprise; the deflection of the campaign, in the summer of
 1957, into a period of "anti-rightist struggle"; the merging
 of the struggle and the party's rectification, in autumn
 1957, to make a nationwide rectification campaign; and the
 identification of the remodelled campaign, early in 1958,
 with the "great leap forward."  As it turned out, the
 rectification campaign was of most interest in showing the
 response of party leaders to a crisis, in particular their
 determination to maintain a united front.  The summary and
 conclusions of this paper appear on pages 97 through 108.

 RMCTIF?IATION" IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 On I May 1957, the `Pei
 i
 p
 ng people's Daily, organ of the
 Chinese Communist party's central comet  tee,
 tral committee directive that the edit?re      published   uct
 a new ."rectification" campaign.   te       party would conduct
 that the campaign was to be directed againstdnes libureaucrAti and
 sectarianism;,, and subjectivism" and would have as its theme
 "the resolution of . contradictionsamong the people."  This
 was the formal .inauguration of a campaign whicl11 with far-
 reaching changes in direction and emphasis, was to dominate
 the' domestic scene in Communist China throughout the rest of
 1957 , and the early ,months of 1958.
 Because of the elaborate introduction which preceded it,
 the circumstances of its inception, andf_the vicissitudes which
 it encountered and which caused it to be radically altered,
 the rectification campaign can be
 an insight Intothe policy-making profitably studied to gain
 y?makiug process in Communist""'Ch,ina.
 The Chinese Communists have been engaged in one campaign or
 another ever since their assumption of
 rectification of 1957 recapitulates theimportant9features
 p
 of these movements and adds some of its own.
 The origins of "Rectification"
 The origins of the campaign go. back 20 years to Mao Tse-
 "tung's 1937 pamphlet "On Contradictions."
 'ruary 1957 which keynoted the rectification acampaignhwas an-
 elaboration of the earlier thesis,
 ation of the Chinese Communist . party.hadovastly,changedlbeitu-
 tween 1937 and. 1957, there were some basic similarities.   As
 will bo'discussed below, the party was faced in both instances
 with a complex set of problems, internal and external, which
 required for their solution the somewhat incompatible achieve-
 ments of greater discipline among relations with the nonparty masses party
 andyoffmembers icials~nd'improved
 The Chinese term for a rectification campaign is a con
 traction of a phrase meaning "to correct the style:of work,,,
 which is derived from a.`speech delivered by Mao Tse-tung at
 the Chinese Communist party's headquarters in Yenan in 1942
 when the original'rectification campaign began.   The Chinese
 Communists claim that Mao's invention of the rectification
 process was a great contribution to the "Marxist-Leninist
 theory of party-building."  Mao himself said in-.Moscow

 in November 1957:   ,In many years of revolutionary p
 we have developed the method of the rectification campaign
 ee'in in accordance with the Leninist princplethefinitiativinof
 close touch with the masses, recognizing
 the masses, and practicing criticism and self-criticism."
 Mao inaugurated the 1942 rectification when, onr11 Feb
 mFnies
 ruary, hedelivered an address at the opening-day
 of the party school in yenan.   In his speech, he vigorously
 ty  and
 attacked subjectivism                                                  to
 formalism; in literature

 tion.   A week later, Mao and the party's then propaganda
 chief Kai: Feng elaborated on the evils of formalism.               After
 a series of discussions and the appearance of several edi-

 scale war with Japan had broken out.     This led to the forma-
 tion of the United Front between the Kuomintang and the Chi-
 jnese Communist party and the establishment of the Communists'
 "Anti-Japanese War Bases."  This was followed by a
 expansion in party membership from about 40,000 in 1937 to
 hundreds of thousands by 1942.
 The; circumstances in which the party found itself after
 1937 demanded a program        would

 During the summer of 1956, provincial party congresses were
 held as a prelude to the September National Party Congress.
 At these provincial meetings, a major topic of discussion
 was shortcomings within the party including commandism, bu-
 re.ucratism, and subjectivism.   Retiring provincial party
 committees were often severely criticized for their, failings,
 and a general streamlining process was carried out in party
 .organizations at the provincial level and below.
 The timing of the campaign and the fanfare which pre-
 ceded its introduction were influenced by Chinese Communist
 interpretation of events in Hungary and, to a lesser extent,
 in Poland during 1956.   Before and during the Chinese Com-
 munist party congress in September 1956 it was evident that
 some sort of party reform was envisioned for the not too
 distant future.   Not until 15 November 1956, however, short-
 .:ly after the Eastern European disturbances, was there an in-
 dication that a formal reinstitution of a rectification cam-
 paign on the 1942 model was contemplated.  Mao's linking of
 the Hungarian disturbances with failure to: resolve contra-
 ?dictions among the people also suggests the significance of
 this factor in the timing and extent of the rectification
 -campaigg.
 The time was appropriate for the party reform for other
 reasons also.   The greatly accelerated socialization and col-
 lectivization program which Mao had personally advocated in
 1955 had been "basically completed" by the fall of 1956. The'
 relative success of this program may have prompted Mao and
 other top Chinese Communist leaders to conclude that the need
 for coercive measures had passed, and that broader popular..
 support for party policies could be sought without critical
 danger to the party's position.
 The Chinese Communist party in 1957 consisted very large-
 1Y .of members who had not been in the party during the periods
 of war and civil struggle in which the party had received its
 final tempering before taking control of the entire mainland.
 These newer members had been subjected to occasional ideologi-
 cal reform movements but not to so comprehensive or painstak-
 ing a process as a.full-scale rectification,  Meetings of party
 organizations which preceded the eighth party congress in Sep-
 tember 1956 demonstrated concern with the problems of bringing
 wayward members into line and eliminating the small minority
 that could not be saved.   The precedent thus set was to con-
 tinue throughout the campaign and eventually affected even
 some party members of long standing'.

 Another  motive for party reform was the-vast prolifera-
 tion of the government bureaucracy in the eight years fol-
 lowing the Communist takeover..  Since this bureaucracy was
 led and, to a large degree, manned by party members, the par-
 ty provided a convenient instrument for the thorough over-
 haul of:the bureaucratic mechanism.   The error of`bureaucrat-
 ism was'; usually mentioned first'in listing the targets of
 rectification during the preliminary=and early stages of the
 campaign, although active measures were not taken to promote
 this phase of the movement until later.   These measures will
 ..be referred to in the discussion of the actual course of the
 rectification campaign.
 The earPt explicit statement of the themes. which were
 developed in Mao's contradiction speeches occurred in the
 first Chinese Communist response to Soviet criticism of Stalin.
 This took the form of an article in the People's Daily of 5
 April. 1956 entitled "On the Historical Experience owe Dic-
 tatorship of the Proletariat."  The article was-said to be
 "based on the discussions of the enlarged meeting of the Po-.,
 liticalBureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
 of China."  This article stated the thesis that contradictions
 could persist even.in a Communist society.   "Viewed in this
 light," the article said,  "the existence of contradictions
 between the individual and the collective in a socialist so-
 ciety is nothing strange."
 InDecember 1956, the People's Daily published an article
 called "More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship
 of the Proletariat," a sequel to its April comment on "de-
 Stalinization."  The later article again commented on contra-
 dictions and introduced the distinction between those "between
 the enemy and ourselves" and those "within'the ranks of the
 people."  It also noted that "finder specific conditions a cer-
 tain contradiction among the people may be gradually trans-
 formed into an antagonistic contradiction when one side of it
 gradually goes over to the enemy."  The article made use of
 the.formula devised during the 1942 rectification campaign
 and elaborated on by Mao in his February contradictions speech;
 "Contradictions among the people themselves can and ought to
 be resolved, proceeding from the desire for solidarity, through
 criticism or struggle, thus achieving a new solidarity under
 new conditions."
 In'themonths that intervened between these articles,
 ;two other important statements appeared on the question of
 contradictions and how to deal with them.   In May 1956 Lu
 Ting-i made a speech before a gathering of Chinese scientists,

 writers, and artists in which he revealed the content of the
 speech made by Mao three weeks previously which had intro-
 duced the "hundred flowers" liberalization policy.  ?Lu thus
 performed for Mao in that instance a service similar to that
 which he rendered later in connection with the new rectifica-?
 tion campaign..  'Lu,declared that contradictions between ma-
 terialism and idealism would continue even in a Communist
 society.   He said, however, that there must be a "strict dis-
 tinction between the ideological struggle within the?people
 and the. struggle against counterrevolutionaries."
 In September 1956, just before the eighth. congress of'
 the Chinese Communist.party, an article appeared in the Peo-
 plel's Daily which developed the distinctions between anti
 nlstlc an c nonantagonistic contradictions in the course of
 demonstrating that?antagnonistic contradictions were then in
 the process of:elimination in Communist China,   With the pub-
 lcation of`this article, the?theoretical basis for the theses
 presented in Mao's.speeches of February and March 1957 had
 been established.
 Themes of' "Rectification," Autumn '1956
 At.the Chinese Communist party.'s eighth party congress in
 September 1956, the first congress held in 11 years, themes
 were introduced which were later incorporated into the rectifi-
 cation movement.   In this brief address that opened the con-
 grass, Mao Tse-tung pointed to the errors which were attacked
 in the early phases of the subsequent rectification campaign-
 Among many of our comrades there are standpoints and
 styles of work which are contrary to Marxism-Leninism,
 namely, subjectivism in ways of thinking, bureaucracy
 in their way of work,  and sectarianism in organiza-
 tional questions.   Such standpoints and such styles
 of work alienate us from the masses, cut us off from
 reality, and harm unity both within and without the
 party.
 In his speech to the congress, Mao did not touch on the
 "hundred flowers" policy which he had introduced the previous
 spring. He did, however, urge that action be taken to im-
 .prove relations between party and nonparty people, a major
 aim of. rectification-
 Although there are over 10,000,000 members in our
 party, yet they constitute a very small minority
 of the country's population.   In the various

 toget the work well done unless we are well versed
 in relying on the, masses and cooperating with non-
 party people ...(we should also continue to strength-
 enlunity among all our nationalities, democratic
 classes, democratic parties, and. people's organiza-
 tions, and consolidate and expand the people's demo-
 cratic united front.)  We must take determined ac-
 tion to get rid of any unhealthy manifestations in
 any part of our work that are detrimental to the
 unity between the party and the people.
 The principal address to the-eighth congress was deliv-
 ered byiLiu Shao-chi.   Called a "political report," it ranged
 over all facets of party and government activity, summarized
 past developments and laid down some guide lines for the fu-
 ture.   Liu's references to the faults of party members and
 the need for rectification were not as concise and specific
 as those of Mao and others, but at various points, he intro-
 duced ideas which were later integrated into the initial plan
 for the rectification campaign of the following spring.
 In .a section entitled "The Political Life of the State,"
 Liu discussed the struggle against bureaucracy as the first
 of the major tasks in improving the government administra-
 tion.   This bureaucracy, he said, was
 characterized by,armchair leadership which does not
 understand and which suppresses the opinions of subordi-
 nates and the masses, and pays little attention to the
 life of the masses.   Such bureaucracy, which manifests
 itself in being isolated from the masses and from re-
 ality, seriously hinders the growth of democracy in
 national life, hampers the unfolding of popular initia-
 tive, and holds back the advance of the socialist cause.
 The struggle against bureaucracy, Liu said, would be a
 long one.   The first step necessary to correct bureaucratic
 vices was the strengthening of Communist party supervision
 over state organs and over party members employed in govern-
 ment departments.   Another measure recommended by Liu was
 greatersupervision by the "masses of the people, and by the
 low-ranking government workers, over the organs of state."
 As a means of exercising this supervision, he said,  "criticisms
 and exposures from below must be encouraged and supported.
 Those who suppress people making criticism or avenge them-
 selves on the critics must be duly punished."

 In the one small portion of his speech devoted exclusive-
 ly to internal problems of the Chinese Communist party, Liu
 said that "one' of the tasks confronting the party leadership
 is to study and analyze past mistakes, draw lessons from them
 so as to be able-to make fewer mistakes and, as far as possi-
 ble, avoid repeating past mistakes, and prevent small mis-
 takes from becoming big ones."  One source of mistakes is
 the influence`of bourgeois ideas which still persists and
 must be prevented from impairing the party's political purity.,
 The major emphasis of Liu's discussion of the party's
 internal problems, however, was on the avoidance and correc-
 tion of the "leftist" expression of subjectivism--i.e., doc-
 trinairism.   He strongly attacked'the"'?'leftist-opportunist
 line" of Wang Ming and Po Ku who were the last opponents dis-
 placed by Mao Tse-tung in his rise to undisputed leadership
 of the Chinese Communist party.   "Their mistaken leadership,"
 Liu said, "caused serious defeats to the revolutionary strug-
 gle, and resulted in the loss of 90 percent of the revolutiona-
 ry bases and of the workers' and peasants' Red Army,"    Liu
 -then went on to claim that since Mao's assumption of leader-
 ship in 1935,  "our party, under' the leadership of the central
 committee headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, has not made any
 mistake in its line."
 The reason for the avoidance of fundamental errors after
 1935, Liu said, was that "instead of meting out severe punish-
 ment to comrades who had made mistakes, the party still'as-
 signed them to suitable leading posts.   With regard to these
 comrades, the party patiently waited for and helped them real-
 ly to recognize their mistakes ideologically."  Liu summed.uip
 this method with the familiar slogan,  "Take warning from the
 past in order to be more careful in the future; treat the ill-
 .ness in order to save the patient."  He gave much of the cred-
 it for improving the party's work to                   the 1942 rectification
 campaign which demonstrated that,  "in order to insure the
 smooth advance of the party's work and to avoid major mistakes,
 the key lies in overcoming subjectivism ideologically."  This
 emphasis on ideology is characteristic of Liu..
 As to Mao's personal role in guiding the party along its
 error-free path, Liu had the following to say:
 As everyone knows, the reason why the leader of our par-
 ty, Comrade Mao Tse-tung, has played the great role of
 helmsman in our revolution and enjoys a high prestige
 in the whole party and among all the people of the coun-
 try is not only that he knows how to integrate the universal

 arxism-Leninism with the actual practice of
 the Chinese revolution, but also that he firmly be-
 lieves in the strength and wisdom of the masses, ini-
 tiates and advocates the mass line in party work, and
 steadfastly upholds the party's principles of democracy
 and collective leadership."
 Liu asserted that there were still "serious mistakes of
 subjectivism" in the thought and work of many cadres.   The
 remedy for these errors, he said, was ideological education
 rather than the practice of "ruthless struggle and merciless
 blows" which had been indulged in by the discredited "leftist
 opportunists."  "Organizational methods" were not to be rash-
 ly resorted to lest they sap the vitality of the party.
 In a very brief section of his speech on "Culture and
 Education," Liu Shao-chi called for continuation of the "hun-
 dred flowers" policy which he credited to the "central com-
 mittee of the party."-  "On questions of academic and artistic
 nature," he said,  "the party should not rely on administrative
 orders to exercise its leadership; it should promote free dis-
 cussionand free emulation to foster the development of science
 and art,."  He showed his continuing distrust of existing intel-
 lectuals, however, by emphasizing recruitment of intellectuals
 of "laboring class origin."  Liu acknowledged that the serv-
 ices of:existing intellectuals must be used, but he warned
 that "we must not allow the boureois and petty bourgeois ideas
 which they bring with them to corrupt the ranks of the prole-
 tariat.' On the contrary, we must hake every effort to help
 them become new intellectuals closely linked with the work-
 ing people."
 Another important speech made to the eighth congress was
 that ofparty Secretary General Teng Hsiao-ping., who reported
 on revision' of the party constitution.   Teng began his report
 by pointing out the differences between the situation of the
 party in 1956 and that which obtained at the time of the pre-
 vious congress in 1945.   Since 1949, he said, the party had
 found that "to assume the position of the party in power is
 also to'subject our comrades to the danger of easily acquir-
 ing the habit of bureaucratism."  This in turn would result
 in "errors of subjectivism," i.e., doctrinarism and empiri-
 cism.   Moreover, Teng said, "there are also those who like
 to consider themselves as leaders and to stand above the
 masses giving orders instead of consulting with the masses
 on all matters"--an attitude of "narrow sectarianism."  Thus,
 Teng said,  "confronted with this situation, the party must

 constantly attend to the struggle against subjectivism, bu-
 reaucratism, and sectarianism."  He went on to say that the
 Communist party was "in need of supervision over our party
 organs and members by the masses of people and personages
 outside of the party."
 Teng offered an explanation of the party's "mass line"
 as contained in the new constitution.   This line must be
 re-emphasized, he said, because "it is the fundamental ques-
 tion in the organizational work of our party, the funda-
 mental question in the general principles of the party con-
 stitution."  The mass line "demands that party leadership be
 courteous and cautious."  Teng condemned pride, arrogance, a
 domineering spirit, conceit, and failure to consult the masses
 which characterized the attitude of some cadres.   He again
 gave special emphasis to the dangers of bureaucratism and the
 need'for a struggle against a growing tendency toward this
 evil.
 Teng Hsiao-ping next commented that the party constitu-
 tion could not automatically solve all problems; he suggested
 a number of practical measures for carrying out the mass line.
 Among such measures, Teng advocated that there be "'sufficient
 freedom and support. to enable the basic-level party and gov-
 ernment organizations to criticize expeditiously and freely
 mistakes and shortcomings in the work of upper level organiza-
 tions."  He gave considerably greater attention to a point
 which Liu had touched on only briefly.   "In implementing the
 mass line and launching the struggle against bureaucratism,
 it is of great significance to cooperate closely with non-
 party personnel and utilize extensively nonparty personnel
 in the struggle."  The significance of the relationship be-
 tween party and nonparty people, Teng said,
 lies in the fact that these democratic people outside
 of the party can play a supervisory role which our par-
 ty is not easily capable of doing by relying solely on
 party members, that they can discover in our work cer-
 tain errors and shortcomings which we have been unable
 to discover ourselves, and that they can be of some
 help to our party..
 The most liberal of Teng's remarks appeared in his de-
 fense of the new provisions of the draft party constitution
 regarding the rights of party members to discuss freely "the
 theory and practice of party policy" and to criticize any
 party organization or personnel--provisions similar to those
 in the CPSU statutes.   Going well beyond the Soviet position

 eng asserted that party members,.while bound to honor majori-
 ty decisions of party organizations, could properly reserve
 their private opinions and present them totheir own organiza-
 tion or even to higher organizations.   In most cases, Teng
 said, dissenters would ultimately recognize the correctness
 of the majority position and so join the majority willingly.
 "If, on the other hand, the truth is shown to rest with the
 minority, the reservation of their right to sustain their
 views will enable the party to discover the truth more easi-
 ly.
 A fourth major speech at the.eighth party congress was
 delivered by Chou En-lai who discussed the central committee's
 proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan.   He had less to say,
 about the aims and methods of the forthcoming rectification
 campaign than had Mao, Liu and Teng.  His closing exhortation,
 however, seems to have anticipated the campaign and its later
 association with a new economic "upsurge":
 Comrades, the day is not far ahead when the First Five-
 Year Plan will be fulfilled successfully and the Second
 Five-Year Plan will begin....  If only we are careful,
 modest, and patient and rectify subjectivism and.,bureau-
 cratism in our work  we will be able to go forward'in
 the-s-truggle for building our country. into a great, so-
 cialist industrialized, and strong country.
 The resolution on Liu Shao-chi's political report passed
 by the congress outlined the party's basic policies for the
 coming years.   It contained most of the elements which were
 combined to form the rectification movement when the campaign
 was introduced the following spring..  On liberalization, the
 resolution said that the "guiding principles of 'letting
 flowers of all seasons bloom and diverse schools of thought
 contend' must be maintained so as to insure that sciences.and
 arts flourish."  On the matter of criticism and "supervision"
 from below, the resolution had the following to say:
 It!is essential to make further efforts to invigorate
 the democratic life of the country, oppose bureaucracy,
 strengthen supervision by the people's congresses over
 thej government and criticism and supervision by the
 masses of people and government departments of lower
 levels, and make appropriate adjustment between the
 administrative powers and functions of the central
 and; local authorities.

 Finally, theresolution cites for correction the same
 errors which the rectification campaign was originally de-
 signed to correct:
 The fundamental shortcoming in the present work is
 that many party cadres have not yet shaken off sub-
 jectivism in thought and work.   It is necessary to
 develop the party's mass line, carry out the princi-
 pal of collective. leadership and inner party democra-
 cy, and overcome. bureaucracy and sectarianism.
 During the months that followed the eighth party con-
 gress, there was some discussion of liberalization policies
 in the People's Daily and party theoretical journals:   The
 major theoretical  journal argued in January 1957 that there
 is "not enough independent thinking and free discussion" in
 current theoretical studies.   The article attacked blind
 belief in "authorities" and advocated the extension to the
 party schools of "letting diverse schools contend."  This
 extension of liberalization was never fully endorsed by the
 party leadership, however, and the "hundred flowers" policy
 remained substantially restricted to the arts and sciences
 until,it fell victim to "antirightist" attacks during the
 following summer.
 The formal decision to institute a new rectification
 campaign was announced to the second plenary session of the
 new central committee on 15 November 1956.   Mao Tse-tung
 called on all government workers and economic personnel "to
 struggle, through rectification-of work style, against ten-
 dencies toward. subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratismo
 In this connection, a party ideological journal in January
 1957 defined "rectification, of work style":
 It is a method by which the Chinese Communist party
 educates cadres with Marxism-Leninism to overcome
 all nonproletarian thought.   It comes from the rich
 experience gained through the summing up, by the par-
 ty center and Comrade Mao Tse-tung, of the ideologi-
 cal work done in the past.
 The journal described three phases of the method:  (1)
 study of documents to enable cadres to distinguish'right
 from wrong;  (2) criticism and self-criticism to determine
 the state of mind and work of each person; and (3) correc-
 tion of errors in accordance with the principles of (a)
 "warning a person in advance so he may do well in the fu-
 ture," and (b) "curing the disease to save the patient."

 Cadres were cautioned against false accusations, rudeness,
 hastiness, and giving too much attention to fixing. responsi-
 bility rather than correcting errors.
 Peiping's later claim that the rectification campaign
 was based on the proceedings of the eighth party congress ap-
 pears to be justified.  The principal elements of the cam-
 paign were introduced on that occasion.  The "antileftist"
 character of the campaign, strongly emphasized during its
 early phases, was given a great deal of attention.by Liu Shao-
 chi, while Teng Hsiao-ping spoke at length on the similar
 theme of the need for criticism from outside. the party.   It
 was the failure of the latter feature that brought about the
 radical revision of the campaign during the summer of 1957
 and the institution of an "antirightist "campaign to recti-
 fy the rectification.; All major speakers at the congress
 touched on the need for correction of the errors of "s,ubjec-
 tivi-sm,'sectarianism,:and bureaucracy"--although the order
 of listing varied--which became the principal targets'of the
 rectification movement.
 Prior to February 1957, the discussion of the need for
 rectification and its principles and goals was confined to
 Communist party channels.   The eighth congress,  the second
 plenary session of the central committee elected at that con-
 gress, the People's Daily and other party publications all
 served to disseminate the views of party leaders to the rank-
 and-file membership.   The task of extending this dissemination
 beyond the party was undertaken by Mao Tse-tung in his famous
 speech on. "contradictions," which attempted to promote one of
 'the major aims of rectification:   improvement of relations be-
 tween party members on the one hand and the puppet parties and
 the masses on the other.
 Mao's Speech on "Contradictions"
 February 1957
 On27 February 1957, Mao Tse-tung delivered before a
 SupremeiState Conference an address which was to provide a
 major canon of the rectification campaign.   A. Supreme State
 Conference is an ad hoc body of variable membership which
 may be convened aEtEorder of the'chairman of the Chinese
 Peoples Republic and which has served in the past as a forum
 for major pronouncements by Mao.   In this instance, the mem-
 bership of the conference included the entire Chinese Peoples
 Political Consultative Conference, principal organ of the
 "united front".in..Communist China, and other "democratic per-
 sonages" not associated with any party.   The address was-en-
 titled "on the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the

 PeopIe"  The speech remained unpublished until 18 June 1957
 when a much.>modified "text" appeared at a crucial moment in
 the development of the rectification campaign.  In the inter-
 vening 'monthsi, however, there lwas much ,published comment on
 this speech and on another on'the same subject delivered on
 12 March, and there were also several private accounts of
 these speeches, so that the main lines of Mao's position be-
 came fairly c'lear,,   (The alterations evident in the June
 official version will be noted in the discussion of the
 period in which they were made.)
 Mao reaffirmed the concept of "contradictions" which had
 been stated in the collective pronouncements on intrabloc re-
 lations in April and December 1956.   He declared that there
 are important "contradictions"--conflicts of many kinds, in-
 cluding Conflicts of interest--even in a socialist society.
 He specified that there are contradictions within each class--
 workers,.peasants, intelligentsia and national bourgeoisie--
 and between those classes.   Of more importance, he said (and
 repeated, in the June official version) that there are con-
 flicts between the interests of the state (collective inter-
 ests) and the interests of the person (individual in
 .and between "the leadership and the led."  He added that prob-
 lems arise also from the "bureaucratic practices" of state
 functionaries.
 Mao maintained that all of the above-cited "contradic-
 tions" are contradictions "among the people," and are there-
 fore to be regarded as "nonantagonistic.11                   They differ in
 kind from contradictions between "the people" (the four
 classes named above) and their enemies--this latter type of
 contradictions being "antagonistic" or fundamental.   This be-
 ing so, Mao said, the regime is justified in using different
 types of measures to'handle the different types of contradic-
 tions.
 For the purpose of resolving nonantagonistic contradic-
 tions among the people, Mao prescribed the formula worked out
 during the 1942 rectification campaign.   This formula called
 for the resolution of contradictions by proceeding from a "de-
 sire for unity" through a period of "criticism or struggle"
 to achieve a "new unity" on a firmer basis.   Mao cited the
 value of this method in 1942 in bringing the "doctrinaries"
 into line with the Mao-oriented mass ::6f party members.
 Mao emphasized that his approach to nonantagonistic con-
 tradictions was once of reliance in "persuasion and education,"

 not coercion.   He reportedly criticized Stalin for having re-
 lied excessively on coercion for handling his problems, al-
 though he is said to have reaffirmed the position,of the April
 1956 statement on de-Stalinization that Stalin's merits were
 on balance more impressive than his faults.   He is said also
 to have: noted that the liquidation of counterrevolutionaries
 in China had been just about completed.

 Mao's soft line of this period was particularly apparent
 in that part of his speech in which he reaffirmed his "hun-
 dred flowers" policy.   The reaffirmation was unquestionably
 very much stronger in the actual speech than in the official
 and amended text published in June.   Mao is reported to have
 said that his policy was absolutely necessary, that he had
 insisted on it  despite opposition in the party,'and that
 his critics were mistaken,   (Actually, they proved to be
 correct.   The significance of this aspect of the speech is

 er chronological sequence.
 Although Mao's references to mutual supervision were ob-
 scured-by the changes made in the speech before publication,
 a quotation in the People's Daily of 12 May 1957 provides
 some light.   A Chinesproa 1?y ,heard Mao ;.deliver b.s. cppkeech
 quoted Mao as saying that "90 percent of the party membership
 do not understand the 'long-term coexistence, mutual supervi-
 sion' policy."   In the light of many public statements which
 appeared in party publications throughout the preliminary and
 early stages of the rectification campaign, it is evident that
 Mao referred to the fear of many cadres that criticism from
 outside the party would expose their shortcomings and add to
 their problems.   An editorial from the Shanghai Liberation
 Daily, reproduced by the People's Daily in a column ascent
 the policy to the same severe restrictions as were imposed on
 other liberalization measures in the June text.   The nature
 of these restrictions will be taken up in more detail in prop-
 In; addition to the "hundred flowers" policy, Mao also
 dealt  with that of "long-term coexistence and mutual super-

 ties.                         This latter policy was potentially and, as later events
 were to'show, actually, a more dangerous one since it referred
 specifically to political matters rather  than to the arts and
 sciences as had the "hundred flowers."  In the published ver-
 sion of:his speech, Mao gave very little attention to mutual
 supervision, and only with the apparent motive of subjecting

 on. noted above, said that some party members,
 confronted with the , prospeetr of general discussion, felt
 "afraid,: aggrieved, troubled, rushed."  Such an attitude,
 ,the editorial said, was wrong and should be replaced by an
 "? appreciation". of the advantages of general discussion outside
 party circles.   Criticism from "our friends outside the par-
 should be welcomed, the editorial asserted, since the
 multifarious problems of estabjishing socialism could  not
 .be solved by Communist party members alone.   This line, which had
 been conspicuous in the speeches of Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Hsiao-ping at the party's September congress, remained in
 effect.until criticism struck too close to home during the
 early weeks of rectification and stringent countermeasures
 were taken.-
 .-In arguing the need for resolution of contradictions-
 'among the people,  Mao was reportedly careful to point out
 the relevance of the Hungarian example.   He is said to have
 argued, in approximately the language of the June official
 text, that where "foreign and domestic counterrevolutionary
 elements are at work, the reactionaries i.n.a socialist .country,
 in league with the imperialists, take advantage of contradic-
 tions among the people to foment disunity and dissension and
 .fan. the flames of disorder in an attempt to achieve their con-
 spiratorial aims,. This lesson of the Hungarian events deserves
 our attention."

 disquisitions.   Mao reportedly made this clear at the conclu-
 sion of the section on the two different types of contradic-
 i-tions in his' February speech.   In the language of-the official
 text:

 years since defeat of the Wang Ming line'
 the Chinese Conamu?

 line.
 In the decade between 1935 and the party's seventh con-
 gress in 1945, according to Lu's article, the party, under
 the guidance of its central committee led by Mao, had car-
 ried out a thorough study of previous mistaken lines and
 had clarified the thought of its cadres.   The 1942 rectifi-
 cation was an important part of this ideological education,
 Lu said, and was largely attributable to Mao himself:   "Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung devised the rectification campaign--a form
 of movement suited to inner party struggle.   It is a great
 contribution to the Marxist-Leninist teaching on building
 the party."'

 "The great majority of our party members exert themselves
 positively and their work is:effective,"" Lu said,   "Still,
 this is not to say that all who have entered the party organi-

 None of our; new methbers has gone through an ideologi-
 cal remolding such as the 1942 rectification movement.
 In general they cannot be deeply aware of what sub,jec-
 tivism.is.   Among them a number still retain the unre-
 formed thinking of the old society, and have not changed
 their original:petty bourgeois standpoint to,a proletarian
 standpoint.
 The magintude of this problem. is indicated by the fact that
 the party's membership in 1942 was "several hundred thousand,
 according to a statement by Mao Tse-tung, while by 1957 it had
 surpassed 12,000,000.   Thus by the time of the new rectifica-
 tion campain only a minute fraction of the party membership
 had undergone the rectification process.   "Such a situation,"
 Lu Ting-i said,  "demands that we arrange a new rectification
 movement throughout the entire party with the aim.of setting
 right the cadres' style of thinking and style of work,"
 In conclusion'Lu said:
 If the coming new rectification campaign is carried out
 successfully, it will greatly increase the ability of
 our party to lead socialist construction and will play
 a great role in promoting the great enterprise of build-
 ing a socialist China.   The purpose of our commemorating
 at this moment the rectification campaign in Yenan 15
 years ago is to make this point clear.
 It will beseen that.Lu Ting-i's article reiterated the
 vigorous attack on "leftist" doctrinairism within the party
 which Liu Shao-chi had emphasized in September.   Lu also fol-
 lowed Liu in praising the leadership of Mao Tse-tung in over-

 rectification campaign.,  Like Teng Hsiao-ping, Lu noted 0600he
 problems'posed by the fact that the party's membership had
 grown enormously since the previous rectification movement.
 tie also pointed out, ashad Teng, that becoming the party in
 power carried with it the danger of falling into bureaucratic
 ways.   In devoting such attention to the connection between
 rectification and: the economic and cultural progress of the
 country, Lu's article repeated points that had already been..
 made by Chou En-lai in September 1956 and by Mao in February
 1957.,  The article extolled the importance of Mao's 1937 writ-
 ings "On Practice" and "On Contradictions" and quoted from.
 them at length, although it did not refer specifically to Mao's
 February ;speech.
 Although the tex tof Mao's reports on contradictions was
 not published immediately, there were numerous "discussions"
 of the topic among the leadership,of the non-Communist puppet
 arties and local Communist party organizations.   The People's
 Daily allo.devoted considerable attention to the subjeZt.
 On 13 April 1957, a People's Daily editorial dealt with
 ,the question of contradic. gns between the people and their
 leaders,the boldest of Mao's innovations.   "At present," ac=
 cording to the editorial, the "contradictions between the
 .masses of our country and the leaders result mainly from.bu--
 reaucratic leadership ih..`:work."  Many leaders were accused-of
 having acquired a habit by.which "as soon as they gain power,
 they enforce orders and..depend-solely on the enforcement of
 orders to take the place of ideological and political work
 among the masses.   Such a tendency to commandism is a manifes-
 tation of a bureaucratic style of work.."
 Ten; days later another People's. Dail editorial called on
 all Communist party organizations  o  eaal-correctly with in-
 ternal contradictions among the people.   The paper said that
 it was the "urgent task of all Communist party organizations,
 (particularly high-level organizations and their responsible
 members, conscientiously to study and carry out Chairman Mao's
 directive on correctly treating the internal contradictions
 within the ranks of the people."  One of the aims of this
 study was to consolidate the "friendly relations between the
 Communist party and the people."
 The; same editorial reported that Mao's reports had "at-
 tracted the greatest attention of all Communist party members
 .and the people.   The widespread discussion of this question by
 all the .different social strata of. the various localities'has
 'brought 'a striking change in the political life.of our country.

 In spite of this claim of; wide popularization, texts of the
 reports were not yetpublished for general circulation.
 During this same period, Peng Chen, an important polit-
 bu.ro,member and second ranking member of. the party's secre-
 tariat-,-'discussed Mao's speeches before a party meeting..` He
 was quoted-by Peiping radio as having said that the "period
 of class war within the country had, by and large, ended, and
 it was now all-important to recognize any difference that may
 arise , within;., the big family of China's people. are family dif-
 ferences which can .be...settled only by democratic means, that
 is, by discussion and persuasion proceeding from a desire for
 unity."  According to the radio report, he stressed the im-
 portance.of "encouraging the free expression of opinion, crit-
 icizizig as-weak-hearted and incompetent' those who feared such
 freedom of expression."
 It seems probable that not all party leaders were taking
 a line identical with Peng Chen's--a line which reflected the
 unprecedentedly "liberal" tone of Mao's various remarks of
 early 1957.   Liu Shao-chi at the party congress in September
 1956 had emphasized the need to avoid "doctrinairism," but
 Liu had been careful as always to state the other side of the
 picture--the dangerous-influence of bourgeois ideas, and the
 unreliability of unreconstructed intellectuals.   It was this
 darker side which had been missing from Mao's statements in
 early 1957.   In this connection, Liu made a report to govern-
 ment:.cadres in Canton sometime prior to mid-April which was
 never published.   The:speech was presumably concerned with"
 some.aspect of Mao's policy on "contradictions," and may well
 have . had a lessliberal tone than Mao at that time thought de-
 sirable..  Teng Hsiao-ping, who like Liu had apparently been
 in agreement with Mao's approach as of September 1956,  like
 Liu-was not associated publicly with the more liberal tone of
 early 1957.   Another politburo member, Kang Sheng, spoke at
 the. same meeting as did Peng Chen; Kang's speech, like Liu's
 earlier, remained unpublished.
 "Rectification" Formally Launched, May Day 1957
 It was in this atmosphere of vigorous propagandization
 of Mao's "contradictions" thesis that the Chinese Communist
 party's central committee approved, on 27 April 1957, the di-
 rective that formally launched the new rectification campaign
 throughout the country. on May Day,   After citing the "great
 victory" of.the 1942 campaign, the directive linked the forth-
 coming rectification campaign to the need to "lead the trans-
 formation of the whole society and the construction of a new

 society." "In order to strive to fulfill the. target of build-
 ing a great socialist state," the directive said,  "our. party
 and the working class must at the same time remold themselves."
 The, directive then explained the- necessity for further
 rectification in terms of the principal errors which had al-
 ready been frequently pointed out as requiring correction::
 In the past few years there has been in the party a
 new growth of bureaucracy, sectarianism, andsubjectiv
 ism'which departs from the masses and reality.   There-
 fore, the central committee considers it necessary, on
 the; basis of the policy of "proceeding from the desire
 .for unity and, through criticism and self-criticism,
 achieving new unity on a new basis," to launch within
 the; party once again an extensive, throughgoing recti-
 fication against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and sub-
 jectivism, and to raise the Marxist ideological level
 of the whole party and improve the working style so
 as to conform with the needs of socialist transforma-
 tion and construction.
 Referring to the new circumstances in which the-party
 found itself, the directive said that "ma ny"+comrades -,do not
 understand or understand inadequately this new situation and
 task of the party."  Because the party is now in a ruling po-
 sition and has "won-the support of the masses of the people,"
 many par.ty.members..had become. prone to using purely adminis-
 trative measures in dealing with problems, according to the.
 directive...  Another group of party members were described as
 "wavering, elements" who were "liable to be contaminated with
 remnants,;of the Kuomintang style of work from the old society,
 to think of themselves as privileged,: and even resort to at-
 'tacks or oppression when dealing with the masses."  All of
 these erroneous methods of action and thought were to be identi-
 !fied, criticized, and rooted out in the course of the forthcom-
 ing rectification campaign.
 The directive specified that the campaign .would': be "guided
 ideologically" by Mao's two reports on contradictions.   These
 reports,:according to the directive, had been "relayed to broad
 sections; of the cadres and intellectuals and will be relayed to
 .all party members and the people."  The directive said that
 these reports had already stimulated vigorous discussion both
 :within and without the party.   Party committees at all levels
 were ordered to organize study of these reports and to examine
 other relevant documents in accordance with the basic ideology.
 .of the reports.

 .Regarding the techniques to be apple  in conducting the
 new campaign,` the directive said that "this campaign should
 be a movement of,ideological education carried out seriously,
 yet as gently as-a breeze or a mild rain."   The criticism and
 self -criticism practiced during the campaign should be car-
 ried "to the proper extent," and meetings ehould be limited
 to small:-discussion meetings or group meetings   The direc-
 tive specifically forbade "large. meetings of criticism or
 'struggle.'.."  Instead,."comradely heart-to-heart talks in
 -the form of conversations, namely exchange of views between
 individuals," were to be used.
 The methods prescribed for closing the gap between party
 -members and the masses were not limited'to discussion and edu-
 -cation.   The directive also provided that:
 In order to strengthen the contact between the party
 and the broad mass of working prople and to change
 thoroughly the situation where many of those in lead-
 ing positions are separated from the masses, it is neces-
 -sary, while the rectification campaign is being conducted,
 for the whole party to advocate and encourage that the
 leading personnel who hold key positions at all levels in
 the party., the government, and the military service, and
 who are fit for physical labor, should devote part of their
 time to engaging in physical labor with the workers and
 peasants.   This measure should gradually be made into a
 permanent system.
 Such activity would to a large extent eliminate bureaucracy,
 sectarianism, subjectivism, and "lordly airs," according to the
 directive.
 First secretaries of party committees were charged with per-
 sonal responsiblity for organizing the campaign and furnishing
 "firm leadership."  Two weeks were allowed for submission of
 concrete working plans to the central committee by party organi-
 zations.
 The directive gave brief attention to nonparty participa-
 tion in the campaign:
 Nonparty people who wish to participate in the rectifica-
 tion campaign should be welcomed.   But this should be
 done on an entirely voluntary basis, and no coercion is
 allowed.   They should be permitted to withdraw freely at
 any time.

 The central committee directive recapitulated, more con-
 cisely than Lu Ting-i's introductory article a few weeks earlier,
 the major characteristics of the new campaign as envisaged by
 Chinese'Communist leaders.   It gave as a primary'motive for
 the campaign the improvement of party leadership during the
 coming period of "socialist construction."  It cited the suc-
 cess ofthe 1942 campaign and specified the "unity-cf?iticism-
 unity" formula as the basic policy of the new movement.   The
 directive vigorously attacked "leftist" mistakes and declared
 that Mao's "Contradictions" speeches would provide ideological
 guidance for the campaign.   Party cadres were directed to study
 means of carrying out both the "hundred flowers" and "mutual
 supervision" policies, and the noncoercive nature of the move-
 ment was emphasized in the slogan devised for the new campaign:
 "As gently as a breeze or a mild rain." Finally, it was explicit-
 ly stated in the directive that the new rectification was to be
 .a party movement better to enable party members to lead the rest
 of society; nonparty people were to take part~-only voluntarily.
 Inonly two respects did the central committee directive
 add to previous authoritative statements.   As would be expected,
 the directive provided specific instructions on implementation
 of the new campaign.   In addition, the directive ordered lead-
 ers to perform physical labor to the extent that their duties
 and capabilities permitted.   This measure gathered momentum
 throughout the campaign until the exploits of leaders at all
 levels who went out among the people to labor occupied a pvomi-
 nent place in the domestic news in Communist China.

 Explanations, May `1957
 Publication of the Chinese Communist party's central com-
 mittee directive on rectification on 1 ,May 1957 initiated an
 intensive press campaign to explain and promote the new move-
 ment   On the following day, the party's newspaper linked the
 May Day celebrations with rectification and devoted a part
 of its front page to-an editorial entitled "Why Rectify?"
 This editorial referred the origin of the movement to the
 preceding party congress:   "The party center directive on
 the rectification campaign is in reality a continuation of
 the resolutions of the eighth party congress."
 The editorial summarized and extended earlier state-
 meits on the current situation and the need for rectifica-
 tion.   The principal contradictions remaining in the country,
 `according to the editorial, were not those between enemies.
 They were those among people who faced the demands of build-
 =inglbf an advanced industrial country and the reality of a
 backward agricultural country; the need for rapid economic
 and cultural development, and a situation in which the exist-
 ingeconomy and culture could not fulfill the people's needs.
 This situation, the editorial said, was unique in the
 history of the party and the nation, and the party faced cir-
 cumstances and tasks that were completely new:   "Since con-
 tradictions-  between the enemy and ourselves will not again
 become the principal contradictions in the nation, the party's
 task in domestic problems is to unite the entire people to
 develop production."  The goal of the new rectification cam-
 paign was said to be that the party should "learn correctly
 to resolve contradictions among the people in order to ful-
 fill the glorious task of developing socialist construction
 and building a socialist nation."
 The editorial sought in earlier statements and writings
 of Mao for justification of the methods to be used in the
 forthcoming rectification.   Mao was quoted as using a proverb
 during the'anti-Japanese war:   "Toward ourselves, peaceful;
 toward the enemy,  fierce."  His 1949 work "On the People's
 Democratic Dictatorship" was quoted to the effect that in
 the process of reforming "ourselves" in the direction of so-
 cialism and communism, the methods that should be Used are
 "democratic,  persuasive methods,  not coercive methods."
 This editorial closed with a declaration that the point
 of view expressed was identical with that of Mao's February

 speech on contradictions. To put this point of view to work,
 it said, was of great historical significance.
 During the early days of May, daily headlines. exhorted
 party members to rectify themselves and provided examples to
 be followed.   These examples were drawn from party organiza-
 tions within the central government organs and various pro-
 vincial party organizations in which rectification was'ap-
 parently undertaken with great alacrity.   "Leading cadres"
 were urged to take the initiative in reforming themselves
 and entering into the rectification process.
 On 8 May 1957, a meeting took place which set in train
 a reaction that brought an abrupt shift in the rectification
 campaign.   This was a symposium convoked by the Chinese Com-
 munistparty's United Front Department for "responsible'men
 of the democratic parties and nonparty democratic personages."
 The central question for this discussion, according to the
 People's Daily report, was:   "What ideological and operational
 pro  ems  o tie democratic parties and nonparty democratic
 personages wish our party to solve in the process of rectifi-
 cation?,"       only were nonparty people invited to criticize
 the Communist party and the government, but they were pro-
 vided with an opportunity to respond immediately to the invi-
 tation.
 Li; Wei-Than, director of the party's United Front Depart-
 ment, stated that his purpose in calling the symposium to-
 gether was "to ask everybody to help us carry out 'rectifica-
 tion, to help us correct our shortcomings and mistakes."  Li
 said, that this was the first time in the history of the Chi-
 nese Communist party that the united front method had been
 used to carry on a rectification movement.   "Because of this,"
 he said',  "it is hoped that everyone will express many criti-
 cal opinions."
 Among those who responded to this liberal invitation
 were Minister of Communications Chang Po-chun and Minister of
 Food Chang Nai-chi.. Both of these ministers were later re-
 moved from their posts in the "democratic" puppet parties of
 which they were officials and, after many months, from their
 government posts.   Both voiced a number of complaints which
 centered around the futility of non-Communists attempting to
 exercise real influence in national affairs.   Although the
 Communist party spoke often of "mutual supervision" among
 the Communist and "democratic" parties,  they said, there was
 actually no means by which this supervision could be exer-
 cised.

 ill will.   It will be of interest to examine some of the oth-
 er reasons for the: momentary opening of the floodgates.
 : The close relationship between.the opening of the rectifi-
 cation campaign and the: Chinese Communist party's invitation
 for` criticism: from non-Communist quarters indicates that."out-
 side" criticism was initially regarded as an integral and im-
 portant part of the rectification process.
 Since a major goal of the rectification movement was to
 improve relations between Communist party members and the
 public,   Communist authorities apparently believed that cadres
 should be exposed to a certain amount of criticism from those
 .whose good will they were intended to seek.   It appears like-
 ly,,therefore, that the statement by the director of the Chi-
 nese Communist party's United Front Department that the.pur-
 pose of. criticism was to assist the Communists to carry out
 rectification and correct their shortcomings and mistakes con-
 tained a certain element of sincerity.   That this tactic was
 not unanimously approved within the party was indicated by
 a comment in the Shanghai Liberation Daily that lower cadres
 were "terrified of the criticism o?  the masses."
 The response to the new liberalization move was far more
 rapid and widespread than had been the case after Lu Ting-i's
 announcement of the "hundred flowers" policy.   As suggested
 above, this response was due in part to the provision of forums
 at which replies might be expressed immediately.   The fact that
 the invitation was linked with the widely publicized rectifica-
 tion campaign may also have lent a greater air of sincerity and
 thereby invoked a freer response.   An additional factor may
 have been that the invitation was addressed not only to academ-
 ic intellectuals but to "political" figures who might be more
 inclined to express their views publicly in the hope of influ-
 encing the course of affairs.
 The Chinese Communist party may also have been motivated
 .by a ,desire to foster a greater sense of participation in the
 government. on the part of an articulate portion of the popula-
 tion.   By thus creating an illusion of free discussion, party
 authorities may have hoped to relieve the party of a part of
 the burden of responsibility for unpopular government measures.
 This tactic had been pursued in theory since the founding of
 the Chinese People's Republic in 1949 but never in matters of
 fundamental importance.
 The fact that the invitation was Issued indicates a.seri-
 ous overestimation by the Communist leadership of the. extent o
 which non-Communist intellectuals and political figures had

 been converted to the-Communistpoint of view.   It appears
 that the. long silence from non-Communist quarters was inter-
 ,preted as acquiescence rather than as the discretion which,
 until then, non-Communists had felt . to -be the.:better part of
 valor.   Since Mao Tse-tung.was presented.as the foremost ad-
 vocate of a policy of relaxation of restrictions .on freedom
 of expression, he must-also be considered foremost among
 those who failed to assess correctly the true attitudes of
 non-Communist intellectuals and puppet party leaders.
 Mao was quick to perceive this error.   On 25 May 1957,
 he spoke before a national congress of the New Democratic
 Youth League (now.the Young Communist League) in the presence
 of the entire top echelon of the Chinese Communist leadership.
 Mao made a statement that recurred frequently during the fol-.
 lowing weeks and became the keynote of the Chinese.. Communist
 .party's counterattack on its newly discovered opposition:
 "Any word or action that is at variance with socialism is
 .completely wrong."  Thus, less than three weeks after it was
 issued,'the invitation: to free speech was rescinded.
 The CCP''s Counterattack, June 1957
 During the next few days,. the counterattack gained mo-
 mentum.   Peiping radio announced on 3 June that the follow-.
 ing day Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper next in authority to the
 icommunienparty's  eople's Daily,, would carry an editorial
 entitled "Criticisms for Unity."  The broadcast observed:
 The editorial points out that it is not true that all
 criticism will lead to a new.level of unity.   Only
 criticism which is factual and. just will serve  this
 purpose.   It is only when criticism is true and sin
 cere and when friendly relations exist between those
 who are criticizing and those who are being criticized
 that it is possible to establish comradely unity.
 This marked the beginning of an attempt to stem the flow
 .of criticism at the same time giving the impression that one's
 freedom in this regard was not cut off.   On the day following
 the Ta Kung Pao editorial, the.People's Daily reprinted an
 edit orislrrom a Nanking paper w  c  urge  continued int.en.-
 si.ve development of the rectification movement.   Those who.
 had been lax in their criticism, the editorial said,. should.
 increase their efforts in the "blooming" and "contending" of
 opinions over various questions.  As for the future,  "this
 should become the practice of today, as it should.also be
 the practice for tomorrow, for both the rectification move-
 ment and the principle of 'let flowers of many kinds bloom

 and diverse schools of thought contend' are long-term .matters . "
 Throughout the remainder of the rectification campaign the
 terminology of the brief period of "liberalization" continued
 to be used, but the meaning of the words was greatly changed.
 A`considerable part of the initial counterattack on crit-

 Simultaneously with the publication of the People's Daily
 editorial-.the Chinese Communist party put into a  etc  anc tz
 well-worn propaganda technique in its-efforts to stifle the em-
 barrassing flow of critical opinion.   In Peiping a symposium of
 trade.union cadres and workers was held in which to air opinions
 on-the case.of-the threatening letter.   According to Peiping
 radio" 'they were unanimously opposed to all kinds of false
 statements departing from socialism, and condemned. the low trick
 of threatening people by anonymous letters.""  It was  also re-
 ported;that workers and staff members of many factories in
 Tientsin met to express their indignation.   These meetings
 .quickly developed into general attacks on critics of Communist
 .leadership.   Their limited scope suggests that they were con-
 vened hastily in anticipation of the forthcoming intense cam-
 paign to suppress opposition to-the regime.
 ,on 9.June 1957, the People's Daily developed the thesis
 that. while criticism was per ec  y correct, countercriticism
 was also: correct.   The editorial then distinguished between
 ,proper and improper criticism:
 As for criticism which is not well-intentioned and which
 aims at undermining the socialist undertakings, the peo-
 ple's democratic dictatorship, and the. unity between the
 party and the people, since it is not compatible with
 the interests of either the people or the party's recti-
 fication movement,! it is, to be sure, all the more neces-
 sary to wage correct countercriticism against this criti-
 cism of a destructive nature.
 Since there are now these two different schools of criti-
 cism, those who are responsible for the people's under-
 takingscannot afford indiscriminately to regard all
 criticism
 h
 as
 elpful ad bfiit
 nenecal_o the people.   They
 cannot but offer their own opinions in answer to that
 criticism which,is.wrong and of a destructive.nature.  If
 no countercriticism is offered against wrong opinions'in
 debate, not only will it be impossible to uphold the truth,
 but also the socialist undertakings will inevitably suf-
 fer damage.

 : The next day,  the People's Daily added further direction
 to the Communist 'party's co~xnerak .   "During the past two
 days," the editorial said, "many workers in Peiping, Shanghai,
 Tientsin, Mukden, Anshan, and other areas have successively
 held symposiums during which they indignantly denounced the
 reactionary, antisocialist views of the extremely small num-
 ber of rightists,"  'Assuming further the role of spokesman
 for the working class, the editorial asserted that "the work-
 ing class realizes that at a time when there are those who
 are conducting activities opposed to the socialist system
 and to the leadership of the Communist party, the most im-
 portant thing:`is to unite as one and defeat these attacks."
 Another appeared in the People's Daily two days later
 entitled "On the Socialist Founaa ion,ale of the Whole
 Country Unite!"    This began on a somewhat defensive note.
 In the words of Peiping radio,  "the editorial emphatically
 points out that to follow the socialist path without the lead-
 ership of the working class and the Communist party is unim-
 aginable."  The editorial then recalled the various attempts
 of certain rightist elements to take advantage of the rectifi-
 cation movement to oppose socialism and undermine socialist
 undertakings.   These rightist elements, the editorial said,
 were a small remnant which evidently hoped that its opinions
 would receive support from private industrial and commercial
 circles.   In prescribing a course of action tobe pursued
 under these circumstances, the editorial called for efforts
 clearly to distinguish between those people who support so-
 cialism but who harbor certain temporary doubts, uncertainties,
 and reservations because of their temporary failure to conform
 to changes, and rightists who are hostile to the socialist sys-
 tem.   The editorial concludes that "all those who are truly
 patriotic and who are willing to stand on the side of socialism
 should, therefore, draw a line of demarcation between themselves
 and the rightists, so as to gain a clearer understanding of
 questions regarding right and wrong."  As for the rightists
 themselves,  "they have also finally come to realize that unless
 they fundamentally change their attitude toward socialism they
 will become an utterly isolated, pitiable group.   In other words
 they will be thrown out of the train of the times."
 The following day,  the People's Daily carried its final
 editorial of the  series on the a  egrightist" attack on
 Communist leadership and the principles of socialism as in-
 terpreted by the Chinese Communist party.   In this editorial
 the leaders of the Communist party apparently attempted to pre-
 vent the rectification campaign from becoming entirely displaced
 by the antirightist campaign.   Speaking for the Communist party,

 the editorial emphatically pointed out that "we must bravely
 accept all correct criticism and promptly take measures to
 correct all defects and mistakes in work."  In conclusion,
 the editorial said that "regardless of the attempt by.a
 small number of rightists to disrupt our rectification move-
 ment with their destructive opinions, we must carry out the
 rectification movement."  It added that the Communist party
 must continue to enlist the aid of the masses outside the
 party in.the rectification campaign.
 Mao Takes a Hard Line,  June 1957
 With the Chinese Communist party's counterattack on its
 critics; well under way as a result of a series of editorials
 published by the People's Daily, the next major step~in the.
 anti-rightist campaign was taken.   This was the publication
 on 18 June 1957 of an official "text" of Mao Tse-tung's Feb-
 ruary speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions
 Among the People."  According to an introductory note,."The
 author has gone. over the text based.on the verbatim record
 and made certain additions."  These "additions" somehow re-
 sulted in a text that was much shorter than the original
 speech.' Since portions of the published text were undoubt-
 edly added as a result of "rightist" attacks, there must
 also have been very substantial deletions from the speech.
 as originally delivered.
 During the months between Mao's delivery of the speech
 and its publication, lengthy commentaries on its content ap
 geared in the People's Daily and elsewhere.   From these com-
 mentaries and various ddirect and indirect quotations it is
 possible to forma fairly accurate idea of the general im-
 port of the speech.   On the basis of this picture of the
 speech as originally presented, it is almost certain that
 ,the published text went beyond the original speech in setting
 limits to free expression of opinions.   As far as the rectifi-
 cation campaign is concerned, the principal changes in the
 published version occurred, as might be expected, in those
 sections dealing with the definition of contradictions, the
 ;application of the "hundred flowers"-and "mutual supervision"
 policies, and the avoidance of waste.
 In the opening paragraphs of the June version there ap-
 pears a definition of "the people" which permitted the re-
 gime to judge arbitrarily who might exercise the rights
 guaranteed. by the Chinese Communist constitution.   It thus
 provides a doctrinal basis for confinement of the regime's
 ,tolerance to those who serve its ends:

 At'this stage,of building socialism, all classes,. strata
 and social groups which approve, support, and work for
 .the cause of socialist construction belong to the cate-
 gory of the people, while those social forces and groups
 which resist the socialist revolution,  and are hostile
 to and try to wreck socialist construction, are enemies
 of the people.
 In his general discussion of contradictions, Mao offered
 ,the example of the 1942 rectification campaign and the, "unity--
 criticism--unity" formulas as the correct method for resolv-
 ing contradictions among the people.   "In 1942," he said, "we
 used this method to resolve contradictions inside the Commu-
 nist party, namely, contradictions between the doctrinaires
 and the rank-and-file membership."  As has been pointed out,
 this view was consistent with the emphasis of the introductory
 statements which preceded the new campaign, i.e., rectification
 .was to be strictly a Communist party affair in which nonparty
 people might assist if they wished.   In the June text, how-
 ever, this view was apparently qualified with additional re-
 marks.
 This apparent modification was introduced by an abrupt
 statement that "we extended this method beyond our party."
 It was then argued that during the anti-Japanese war the
 rectification formula had been "used very successfully to
 deal with relations between those in positions of leadership
 and the masses, between the army and the civilian population,
 between officers and men."  It was even claimed that the meth-
 od had been used since 1927 to deal with relations between the
 Communist party and the masses and "in general with relations
 among the people."
 This portion of the published speech concluded with a
 definition of future tasks which portended the extension of
 the rectification campaign beyond the Communist party:
 Now our task is to continue to extend and make still.
 better.use of this method throughout the ranks of the
 people; we want all our factories, cooperatives, busi-
 ness establishments, schools, government offices, pub
 li.c bodies, in a word, all the six hundred million of
 our people, to use it in resolving contradictions among
 themselves.
 This statement heralded a fundamental change in the na-
 ture of the rectification campaign. It was the beginning o:f,
 a. movement which was to carry rectification to all sectors

 and allilevels of Chinese society.   Because-of the size and
 complexity of the task thus undertaken, the campaign was
 initiated at. different times and carried out :to varying de-
 grees in various  parts of the country; eventually, however,
 it penetrated,.in one form or another, to the most remote
 areas and to the lowest levels of society.
 The heart of the new restrictions placed on free expres-
 sion in;the revised text of Mao's speech occurred in the sec-
 tion on the "hundred flowers" and "long-term coexistence and
 mutual supervision" policies.   In discussing distinctions
 between "fragrant flowers'' and "poisonous weeds," Mao pre-
 sented a list of six criteria:
 We believe that, broadly speaking, words and actions
 can be judged right .if their:
 1) Help to. unite the people of our various nationalities,
 and do not divide them;
 2) Are beneficial, not harmful to socialist transforma-
 tion and; socialist construction;
 3) Help to consolidate, not undermine or weaken, the
 people's democratic dictatorship;
 4) Help to consolidate, not undermine or weaken, demo
 cratic centralism,
 5) Tend to strengthen, not to cast off or weaken, the
 leadership. of the Communist party;
 6) Are beneficial, not harmful, to international social-
 ist solidarity and the solidarity of the peace-loving peoples
 of the world.
 Maoiadmitted that these were political criteria but de-
 'fended their their inclusion in a discussion of a policy that ap-
 iplied to the arts and sciences.   They were necessary, he
 said,. in; addition to other criteria for judging the worth of
 scientific or artistic activities:   "In a socialist country
 like ours, can there possibly be any useful scientific or
 artistic activity which runs counter to these political cri-
 teria?"
 The June text proceeded to a discussion of the policy
 governing relations between the Chinese Communist party and.
 the "democratic" puppet  parties which had been summed up in

 the slogan:   `"long-term coexistence and mutual superv,s on.
 The slogan was presented in somewhat defensive terms.   In

 published `version of'the speech, however,, left no doubt
 that the survival of. the non-Communist parties was=dependent
 on their observance of the six criteria previously presented:

 This was a far cry from the calls for criticism which.
 had been issued only a few weeks previously.   The earlier
 invitations had evidently been based on an assumption that
 "ideological remoulding" had already taken place among prom-
 inent non-Communists to such an extent that   they could be
 trusted to offer mild and perhaps even salutary criticism
 of the Communist party.   When it had become apparent by mid-
 June that this assumption was wrong, the publication of a
 revised version of Mao's February speech provided a means of
 reimposing stringent limits on the freedom to criticize.
 Throughout the June version of the speech there occur
 statements which contrast with. assertions made during the
 introductory phases of the rectification campaign.   It seems
 likely that these statements had been inserted in order to
 counteract the overoptimistic mood in which the, campaign had.
 been conceived.   In the section on the suppression of counter-
 revolution, for example,  Mao is reported to have said that.
 "even when all the counterrevolutionaries in existence, have
 been rooted out, new ones may emerge.   If we drop our guard
 we shall be badly fooled and suffer for it severely."  This
 has the appearance of a hedge on the earlier insistence that
 counterrevolutionaries had been "basically eliminated."

 dictions,' the National People's Congress opened 'its fourth
 session in Peiping on 25 June 1957.           The congress had been
 twice postponed and was preceded by an unusual "preparatory
 meeting" at which, presumably, the proceedings of the forth-
 coming session were carefully laid out.  Both the delays and
 the -_ preparatory. meeting probably were occasioned by the need
 to allow delegates time to study carefully the official. text

 Although it dealt largely with economic and administrative
 matters, the speech was studded throughout with statements
 in defense of previous measures of the regime and attempts
 to correct. the impression of tolerance of real criticism
 which. had been created during the opening phases of the
 rectification movement.   In.line with the People.'s'Daily
 editorials of early June and the official text of Mao's
 speech, Chou also attempted to correct the overoptimistic
 assessment of the docility of nonparty people which under-
 lay the party's solicitation of outside criticism.
 In the course of a. review of the events of the past
 few years, Chou admitted that mistakes had been made dur-
 ing the "socialist transformation" of agriculture, handi-
 crafts, industry and commerce.   He blamed these mistakes
 largely on the mass nature of the movements and claimed
 that the errors had been outweighed by the achievements
 attained.   As for those who had been unjustly harmed, how-
 ever, "we should apologize publicly to those people who
 suffered unnecessarily in the movement."
 Chou reiterated earlier optimistic estimates of the
 status of the revolution but emphasized the continuing
 role of the class struggle:.
 When we say that the socialist revolution has tri-
 umphed in the main and that the turbulent class
 struggle waged by the masses on a large scale has,
 in the main, been concluded, we do not mean. to say
 that class struggle has ended.   When we now bring
 to the fore the question of correctly handling con-
 tradictions among the people, we do not mean to say
 that there are no longer contradictions between our-
 selves and the enemy.
 Chou attacked critics of the regime in terms that left
 little doubt as to the point at which their criticism had
 overstepped the bounds of tolerance:
 Certain right-wing elements have come out with quite
 a number of utterances of a destructive nature, on
 the pretense of helping the Communist party with its
 rectification campaign.   Not a few such views aimed
 directly against the basic state system of our coun-
 try.
 What these critics were really trying to do, Chou said,
 was "to get,our state-power away from the vanguard of the
 . -39-

 working class--away from  the leadership piof thetyommunisto-
 party."  In defending the Chinese Communist
 power, Chou cited the 1954 constitution which acknowl
 edges the party's leadership.  He also presented one of the
 Communists! favorite circular arg dents, that the socialism"
 ship of the party is necessary
 and thus attain "the world of universal harmony of which the
 Chinese people have always dreamed."
 Finally, Chou reinterpreted the policy of "long-term co-
 existence and mutual supervision" so as to leave no doubt
 about the future role of the puppet parties and the terms on
 which they; would be permitted to survive.   He paid lip-service
 to the importance of the "united front" but affirmed that "the
 Communist party is the guiding force and the core of the united
 front and the common goal of struggle for the people of the
 eaatire country."  As for the function of the united front:
 Through the various democratic parties and groups and
 people's organizations brought together in
 front, it is possible to do better
 cialist ideology, more effectively carry through so-
 cialist transformation, and advance the cause of so-
 cialist construction.   This is the function and pur
 pose.of the policy put forward by the Communist par-
 ty for long-term coexistence with the democratic par-
 .         the people expect
 tiesand mutual superv
 of the democratic      i parties siois thattthey should firmly
 tdhere to the socialist stand and pay attentoni-
 ideological remolding so that they can play a po
 tive:role in state affairs to the fullest extent of
 their capabilities.
 In the unlikely event that any delegates had failed to
 appreciate any of the points made by Chou En-tai, they
 repeated and underscored in a. speech by the party's p  p
 ganda chief, Lu Ting-i, on 11 July 1957.   Lu's long and de-
 tailed article in the people's Daily in March had heralded
 the rectification campaign.
 Like Chou, Lu began on a defensive note.   Some rightists,
 he said, attributed the rectification campaign to insuperable
 difficulties which confronted the Chinese Communist Party.
 These rightists were quoted as having said that the Communists
 had made mistakes in every field and that the country was in
 utter darkness.   On the contrary, Lu said, the rectification
 eampaignihad been made possible by the decisive victory of
 the socialist revolution, and because,  "in the course of the

 struggle for this victory, democratic-parties and groups, the
 national bourgeoisie,. and      intellectuals had generally ac-
 cepted or agreed to the socialist revolution." He claimed
 that "the. overwhelming majority of the people see the campaign
 and the policies of the party from the standpoint of love for
 the country and socialism."
 Why, then, had the antirightist campaign become neces-
 sary?..  Because, said Lu, "a very few bourgeois rightists think
 that the moment has come for. an upheaval and that a great of -
 fensive.can be launched against socialism, against the peo-
 ple's democratic system, and against. the Communist party."
 Lu especially attacked rightist attempts to provoke stu-
 dents to carry out disturbances.   He accused them of planning
 to use students as the spearhead of a movement which would
 eventually attract workers and others and provide a pretext
 for a rightist offer to. settle the disturbed situation.   Lu
 charged that. the non-Communist minister of communications,
 Chang Po-chun, had connived at such a.plan during a talk with
 six professors a few weeks earlier.   One of the six, Lu said,
 was the vice.minister of higher education.   Lu was referring
 obliquely to a sizable student demonstration which had taken
 place in Wuhan about a month before his speech.   Chang was
 later accused directly of having been involved in inciting
 this. demonstration.
 The schemes of the rightists failed, according to Lu,
 because they over-estimated their forces.   He claimed that a
 maximum of 1 to 3 percent of the students in higher institu-
 tions had supported and followed the rightists and that of
 these a mere handful remained.   Although the rightists had
 centered their hopes on the higher intellectuals, Lu said,
 they had won the support of only a small percentage, most of
 whom had already forsaken them.'
 Lu also charged that. the rightists had expected help from
 the capitalists but had only evoked a few scattered echoes.
 The "democratic" parties also had failed to respond to rightist
 overtures, Lu said,  and many of them had decided to carry out
 their. own. rectification campaigns.   He thus acknowledged the
 services of the many non-Communist delegates who had risen
 to accuse their colleagues of "rightist" tendencies.
 Lu also made it clear that the single standard by which
 any. utterance would be judged was adherence to Communist goals
 and methods:
 -41-

 To reject socialism, to reject the leadership of the
 working class, to reject the people's democratic dic-
 tatorship and democratic centralism, and to reject
 the alliance with the Soviet Union can only destroy
 our country.   What the rightists stand for is exactly
 what will destroy our country and lead us to annihila-
 tion,
 In discussing the class struggle, Lu reversed the empha-
 sis of his earlier article:   "The exploiting classes have
 basically been eliminated and the period of large-scale class
 struggle is over.   But this certainly does not mean that there
 is no class struggle in a socialist society."  He further as-
 serted that this struggle "will sometimes assume a very ac-
 tive form."
 Lu Ting-i concluded his speech with a reaffirmation of
 the Communist party's liberalization programs and urged "bold
 encouragement of criticism and self-criticism to correct the
 shortcomings and mistakes in our work."  He made it clear,
 however, that liberalization and criticism of the regime would
 be allowed to survive in name alone:   "The rightists must be
 mercilessly criticized and the rectification campaign must
 be resolutely continued."
 A final feature of the National People's Congress ses-
 sion was'the delivery of a number of abject confessions, spoken
 and written, by prominent nonparty personages who had come in
 for criticism as rightists.   These included the three minis-
 terial officials who had been especially sharply criticized
 at the meeting.   More than six months were to pass, however,
 before they were formally dismissed from their posts.
 The Communist leadership's concern over the political
 s-ituation among students was again demonstrated on the day
 following'adjournment of the National People's Congress.   On
 16 July 1957, both Chou En-lai and Peng Chen, a politburo
 member and mayor of Peiping, addressed a meeting of 12,000
 1.957 graduates of institutes of higher education in Peiping.
 Chou exhorted the graduates to work in the interest of the
 s; torte and ';society rather than seeking their own pleasure.
 fie told them that he had high hopes for them and noted with
 satisfaction that most graduates of institues of higher learn-
 ing had been "steeled" in the recent political struggle against
 rightists and that they had conducted themselves properly. Chou
 expressed the hope that the graduates, after leaving school,
 would continue to reform and temper themselves through politi-
 cal struggle and also through participation in physical labor.

 The tone of. Chou's talk to the graduates was not at all
 conciliatory.   Apparently the student. disturbances during the
 summer had not disposed the regime to make concessions to
 student groups as a means of placating them.  Chou did not
 even hold out the hope of a future reward.   To buildChina,
 into a highly industrialized and advanced nation, he said,'
 was a task that would require several decades.  To the stu-
 dents, as to other segments of Chinese society, the leader
 sh.ip presented an appearance..of bland confidence that,   ex-
 cept for a few malcontents, the populace would be happy to de-
 vote their lives to the aims provided for them by the Chinese
 Communist party.
 Peng Chen lectured the. graduates on the important educa-
 tional significance of the antirightist struggle and called
 on his hearers to associate closely with workers and peasants,
 to. respect them and learn from-them, and to comply with the
 work assignment given them by. the state.   Peng maintained
 that the great majority of students had been able to distin-
 guish right from wrong during the antirightist struggle be-
 cause of. the guidance of the Communist party and their teach-
 ers.   He,  hoped that students who had committed mistakes in
 the course of the campaign "would resolutely correct them and
 would follow the path to socialist construction and socialist
 transformation."
 The unyielding line taken by Chou and Peng in their ad-
 dresses to the graduates was confirmed,by a State Council di
 restive issued the..following day which required stringent po-
 litical investigation of all graduating classes.   Students
 whose attitudes were not acceptable would be placed on proba-
 tion for periods of up to three years during which they would
 perform menial tasks while undergoing "ideological correction."
 The authorities avoided violent measures for the time being,
 but some erring students were forced to forego their summer
 holidays in order'to undertake special ideological studies.
 By late July the antirightist campaign had reached into
 the Communist party itself and. a number of party members in
 journalism and publishing activities had been condemned for
 their criticism of party.cadres.   A basis for this phase of
 the campaign was provided by a People's Daily editorial of
 28 July.   The, editorial began with a  ustlfieation of the
 antirightist.campaign on the grounds that it would be "im-
 possible to consolidate socialist undertakings if the revolu-
 tion is under way only in the aspect of ownership-of produc-
 tion means without corresponding progress on the political
 and ideological fronts."  In order to carry out the political
 -43-

 Approved For Release 2000/0418CCIA RDP79T01049A001900060001-4
 and ideological revolution, the editorial said,  "everyone must
 go throughthe gate of socialism."
 Communist party members would not be automatically as
 s6ed to be above question in these matters; the editorial as-
 serted that for each party member, "the attitude to adopt with
 regard to this struggle is a significant political test since
 eery party member, too, must go through this gate of social-
 ism."  The editorial pointed out the seriousness of the situa-
 tion:
 Certain well-intentioned comrades seemed to be of the
 opinion that the rightists existed only outside of the
 party, and only among the bourgeoisie, democratic par-
 ties, and the intellectuals who had never reformed them-
 selves.   This view, however, is not in keeping with the
 facts, for the anti.rightist struggle under way in vari-
 ous areas has exposed many rightists within the party.
 In the heat of the fierce battle between the Chinese
 bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the editorial said, the
 rightists within the party began to show their true faces:
 '?They joined rightists outside the party and took advantage
 of certain individual and scattered shortcomings and defects
 in party and state life to launch an attack against the par-
 ty from within and without."  The editorial said that, under
 these circumstances,  "in order to protect the party from right-
 ist corruption and to maintain the ideological and political
 purity of the party, it is necessary to develop an 'impartial
 and equal.' struggle against the rightists within and without
 the party:."
 The People's Daily editorial cautioned, however, that
 '.'oversimplified an -impetuous methods" should not to be used
 against the rightists.   Instead, the rightists were to be
 isolated by persuasion and criticism.   Party members were al-
 go warned never to make false charges against nonrightists.
 On the day after the publication of the People's Daily
 editorial on rightists within the Communist party, the  wang
 Ming Daily, mouthpiece of the "democratic" parties, carried
 a6ed  or al entitled, "Why Is It Necessary for Democratic
 Parties to Launch an Antirightist Struggle?"  The editorial
 pointed out that the events in the course of the antirightist
 campaign of the past month had vividly proved that the strug-
 le was of key significance to the puppet parties.   These
 . Parties were warned that they must go through this struggle
 to "clarify their stands."   In case there should remain any

 misunderstanding on the part of members of the puppet parties,
 they were told explicitly that this was a matter of life and.
 death for the parties.
 Thus, by the end of July 1958,. the rectification cam-
 paign which had begun as a Communist party movement had been
 extended to the ranks. of the non-Communist political parties,
 while the antirightist campaign which had at first involved
 non-Communists had been extended into the Communist party.
 The two.campaigne,.however, had not yet been formally merged.
 During the next few weeks, the antirightist campaign in-
 creased in scope and. intensity while the rectification cam-
 paign was completely refashioned.
 "Antirighti'st Struggle" Continues, August 1957
 In an apparent move to intensify the campaign against
 opponents of the regime, Chinese Communist authorities gave
 increasing publicity to the capture of alleged conspiratorial
 bands in widely separated parts of. the mainland during late
 July and August 1957.   After several bands had been broken
 up, a link was established between such counterrevolutionary
 activity and certain accused rightists.   The leaders of a
 band reportedly seized in the Hupeh-Hunan border area were
 quoted as declaring that Minister of Communications Chang
 Po-chun and Chu-An-ping, former chief editor of the "demo-
 cratic" parties' Kwang Ming Daily,                     "belonged to their group."
 Another non-Communist o   cial who had criticized the regime.,
 Minister of Timber Industry Lo Lung-chi,. was accused of hav-
 ing formed an alliance with.Chang which had been responsible
 for the two-day student riot in the city of Wuhan in June.
 By associating these men with counterrevolutionary activity--
 most heinous crime in the Communist code--Communist authori-
 ties undoubtedly hoped to discourage other potentially disaf-
 fected intellectuals and bureaucrats from openly expressing
 opposition.
 .  Another cause for concern on the part of Chinese Commu-
 nist leaders during.the late summer. of 1957 was the lagging
 grain procurement program in rural areas..  The People's. Daily
 in early August declared that the food question waasrimar  y
 an ideological problem.   Three days later, the GCP central
 committee ordered immediate action by all levels of. the party
 to give the peasants a "true appreciation" of-the superiority
 of cooperatives, the necessity for government purchasing and
 marketing of grain, the. nature of the relationship between
 urban workers and peasants, and the importance of suppressing
 counterrevolutionaries.   The directive linked the situation

 among the peasants with''the antirightist campaign and declared
 that "reactionaries and' counterrevolutionaries" who raised
 their voices were to be silenced at once.   This was followed
 by another long editorial in the People's Daily explaining
 the party line put forth in the d re   ve.
 High-level officials.of the Chinese Communist party con-
 tinued to take advantage of every possible occasion to pro-
 mote the antirightist and rectification campaigns.   The empha-
 sis was still on the antirightist phase.   On 4 August, polit-
 buro member Peng Chen, mayor of Peiping, addressed a meeting
 of the Peiping People's Congress.   The purpose of the meet-
 ing, Peng said, was "to expose further and criticize the re-
 actionary heresies of the bourgeois rightists (and) to give
 impetus to the progress of the rectification campaign." Peng
 characterized the antirightist struggle:
 It is a great debate of the whole people, a great po-
 litical and ideological battle, a struggle between
 capitalism and  socialism; it is also a struggle which
 concerns the destiny of the 600,000,000 people and.the
 social development of our country, and a struggle of
 great historical and international significance.   So-
 cialism will not triumph if we do not win this battle.
 The term "great debate" quickly became part of the jar-
 gon of the antirightist and rectification campaigns.   Appar-
 ently the authorities, in order to maintain a semblance of
 the abandoned liberalization policies, sanctioned the use of
 the word "debate" once it had been clearly established that
 no real debate would bepermitted.   The so-called debates
 that were organized throughout the country from this time
 onward served no purpose but to propagandize and justify the
 policies of the regime.
 Peng Chen went on to advise the rightists "obediently to
 jay down their arms, raise their hands, express their determina-
 tion to repent, and truthfully confess their crimes.   If an early
 offort is made, they can still expect to be saved."  Peng then
 proceeded; to refute rightist charges that the regime had made
 "'a mess" of the country.   He admitted mistakes and shortcom-
 ings,  "some of which are of a very serious nature," but.con-
 tended that these were "incomparably insignificant when com-
 pared with the successes achieved."
 Although his primary stress was on the antirightist cam-
 paign, Peng also called the attention of his audience to the
 general aims of his rectification campaign.   According to press
 -46-

 reports.of his speech, he pointed out the main mistakes and
 shortcomings of certain leading and working.cadres, both Com-
 munist and non-Communist, and criticized their work and. their
 working style.   He was further reported. to have pointed out.
 that "such mistakes and shortcomings were also perpetrated
 by our leadership.". The names of the individuals whom Peng
 criticized were not reported but tieir shortcomings were
 described, in some detail.  These faults were.,, for the most
 part, those which had been singled out for criticism during
 the introductory phases of the rectification campaign.
 Peng urged that everyone diligently labor at the type
 of work for. which he was best suited.   In keeping with earli-
 er directives on. rectification, he recommended that cadres
 do a certain amount of manual work.    Peng also proposed a
 measure that was put into effect amidst a great deal of pub-
 licity during the following months:
 In the future, 30 to 50 percent of the working person-
 nel of government offices and administrative personnel
 of productive and nonproductive enterprises should be
 dispatched to workshops, stores, farms, agricultural
 cooperatives, handicraftmen's cooperatives, and other
 basic-level units to participate in productive labor
 and basic-level work for a comparatively long period.
 On 15 August, a preparatory conference for another peo-
 ple's congress meeting, in Shanghai, provided an opportunity
 for Ko Ching-shih, secretary. of the. East China bureau of the
 Chinese Communist party, to promote the antirightist and recti-
 fication campaigns.   Twelve days later, a lengthy resumd of
 Ko's speech was published in the People's Daily, a significant
 indication of high-level endorsement of  is v ews.
 Ko began with the familiar assertion that the rectifica-
 tion campaign and the antirightist.struggle constituted a so-
 cialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts
 which had become necessary after completion of the revolution
 in regard to ownership of.the means=ofproduction.   Ko's dis-
 cussion of the two campaigns followed lines that had already
 been laid down but his treatment was,fresher and less cliche-
 ridden than were most other statements on the subject.
 Ko credited "the party's central committee and Chairman
 Mao Tse-tung" with having devised.a series of policies which
 would solve internal questions among the people and bring in-
 to full play the energetic initiative.of the masses in build-
 ing socialism., The party, he said, had started the rectifica-
 tion campaign in order to be better able to cope with the new

 situation and unite all the forces that could be united to
 slerve in building socialism.   Ko maintained that these poli-
 cies would be carried out by democratic. methods and persua.
 lion rather than coercion.
 Ko succintly summed up the aims of rectification:
 Our objective is to create a political situation in
 which there is both centralism and democracy, both
 discipline and freedom, both united will and personal
 ease of mind, and vitality to serve the interests of
 the socialist revolution and socialist construction.
 This will make it easier to overcome difficulties and
 build China's modern industry and agriculture more
 rapidly.   Also the party and the state will be  more
 consolidated and more capable of weathering storms.
 This. is the conclusion which our party drew by summing
 up considerable historical experience.
 Ko reaffirmed the validity of the liberalization poli-
 dies as "guiding principles" for the rectification campaign.
 these policies, he said,  "certainly will not be stopped half
 Way   because of the struggle against the rightists."  Ko as-
 Serted that the struggle against the rightists was, in fact,
 for the purpose of creating conditions in which the rectifica-
 tion campaign could be carried out.   It was apparent that Ko
 hoped to prevent the antirightist campaign from completely
 eclipsing the original rectification campaign.   He assured his
 hearers that,  "at the present moment, while the struggle against
 the rightists is going on, the party's rectification campaign
 is also continuing."
 Ko repeated the claim that the number of rightists was ac-
 tually very small but urged that the struggle be carried through
 to the end so as to secure complete victory.   He described rec-
 tification and the antirightist campaign as "a nationwide pub-
 tic debate," on such questions as "whether our revolution and
 construction work were correct; whether we should follow the
 toad to socialism; whether we wanted the leadership of the Com-
 munist'party, the dictatorship of the proletariat and democrat-
 ic centralism; and whether the foreign policy of this country
 was correct."  By this time Ko was able to assume, apparently,
 that his listeners would be well aware that the answers to
 these questions had already been determined and that the "de-
 bates" would serve only to reaffirm them.
 Ko made a transparent attempt to attribute to the rightists
 an error which had in fact been made by the Communists.   The

 antirightist struggle, he said, had been instigated by the
 bourgeois rightists who had "made a wrong assessment of the
 whole situation."  This interpretation of the campaign also
 "explained" the embarrassing fact that the Communists had
 been taken by surprise by the opposition expressed in the
 early phases of the rectification campaign.
 On the day following Ko Ching-shih's speech, the Peo-
 ple's Daily published an editorial which summed up.the anti-
 rist campaign, criticized its conduct by some units and
 cadres, and indicated that the campaign would be a long and
 thorough-going one.   According to the editorial the antiright-
 ist struggle had been instituted only in the upper levels of
 the organizations concerned:
 The antirightist struggle which was started in early
 June has been going on for more than two months now.
 At present, the top-level organizations of the central
 government, the various provinces, municipalities, and
 autonomous regions are all broadening this struggle.
 This struggle is also being developed gradually among
 the top-level organizations of special administrative
 areas, hsien, and urban areas, as well as in major fac-
 tories, mines, middle schools, and industrial and com-
 mercial circles.
 The development of the antirightist campaign, however,
 had been "uneven," the editorial said.   This was attributed
 "not only to the difference of time in starting this struggle
 by different units, but also to the difference in the seri-
 ousness of the leadership and the extent of the work being
 carried out."  The directors of some units were even charged
 with having "wanted perfunctorily to close the issue at an
 early date."  Thus notice was.served on the party leadership
 at all levels that the energetic pursuit of the antirightist
 campaign would be their primary duty.   "In many cases," the
 editorial said,  "the lack of greater development of the anti-
 rightist struggle is caused by the principal responsible cad-
 res of the units concerned who failed to assume a serious re-
 sponsible attitude in this matter."
 The editorial presented the familiar arguments in justi-
 fication of the antirightist campaign and described the strug-
 gle as one "on which the destiny of our country hinges and
 one concerning the life or death of the cause of socialism."
 In conclusion, the editorial referred to the antirightist cam-
 paign and socialist, construction as "currently two central
 tasks of our country which must be considered as being of

 equal importance."  The editorial failed to mention the recti-
 fication 'campaign.
 The promotion of the antirightist campaign continued dur-
 j.ng this.period at a meeting of "teachers of Marxism-Leninism"
 at Peiping.   This meeting was addressed by the Chinese Commu-
 nist party's propaganda chief Lu Ting-i and by politburo alter-
 hate Kang Sheng whose public activities since 1956 have dealt
 largely with educational matters.   Lu Ting-i addressed the
 more than 5,600 persons, at the meeting on the "situation and
 significance of the current antirightist struggle and the rec-
 tification movement, and called on teachers of Marxism-Leninism
 and other, intellectuals to become intellectuals of the working
 class."  Lu stressed the need to create a working-class intel-
 1igentsia, as-had Liu Shao-chi at the eighth congress of the
 0CP the previous September.
 Kang: Sheng devoted major attention to the general prob-
 lems of teaching Marxism-Leninism and to methods of carrying
 on the antirightist and rectification campaigns in educational
 institutions.   The "violent phase of the counterattack against
 the rightists" had already taken place in most of the educa.-
 tional institutes throughout the country, he said, and the
 "'upsurge in the large-scale mass struggle to repel the right-
 ist attack had ended."  Kang cautioned his hearers, however,
 that the rectification movement and the antirightist struggle
 had not yet been concluded.
 Taking the line of the People's Daily, Kang Sheng said
 that the intensity and the scope of  he antirightist struggle
 had been uneven among the various schools.   To cope with this
 problem, Kang said, the propaganda department of the CCP cen-
 tral committee, the Ministry of Higher Education, and other
 agencies concerned had decided that political education would
 be made apart of the formal curriculum of all schools in ad-
 dition tocontinuing as a major extracurricular activity. Kang
 described the nature of the new course:
 This course is of the nature of class education in the
 socialist revolutionary movement.   It must not be re-
 garded as an ordinary course in the general curriculum.
 This is a course of the rectification movement and so-
 cialist education and a component part of the great all-
 people debate."
 It is apparent from the remarks of Lu and Kang that the
 regime was answering student discontent with increased attempts
 at indoctrination, and discontent among intellectuals with a

 re-emphasis on the creation of a body of new intellectuals
 rather than the "remolding" of existing ones.
 Public statements on the two campaigns continued to urge
 the use of reasoning and persuasion in order to convert peo-
 ple who exhibited rightist tendencies.   In the case of stu-
 dents, however, one of the rare instances of intimidation by
 bloodier methods occurred in early September.  On 6 September
 1957, the Chinese. Communist press announced that three ring-
 leaders of the student;  riot at Wuhan in June had been exe-
 cuted on that day.   The announcement was obviously timed to
 coincide with the opening of the academic year so as to have
 the maximum effect on returning students.  Others involved
 in the riot were given, sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years.
 By early September, three months after it had begun; in
 an atmosphere of surprise and haste, the antirightist cam-
 paign had been formalized, channeled, and provided with its
 own vocabulary of "newspeak" jargon.'  During these three
 months the rectification campaign almost disappeared in the
 welter of speeches, articles, and editorials on the struggle
 against the rightists.   The two campaigns had been treated
 as complementary but separate throughout this period.   By
 September, however, the leadership apparently decided that
 the antirightist campaign had progressed to the extent that
 more attention could be directed, safely to some of the origi-
 nal goals of the rectification campaign, as Ko Ching-.ship
 had hinted three weeks previously.   Further: developments dur-
 ing the month of September 1957, therefore, were to. open -a
 new phase in the courseeof the rectification campaign.

 Rectification Reoriented
 By the end of August 1957, the Chinese Communist lead-
 ers had apparently decided that the "antirightist" opposi-
 tion, which had risen so vigorously in response to the party's
 bid for criticism, had been brought sufficiently under con-
 trol that the rectification campaign could return partially
 to its original aims and methods.  The unexpected events of
 the summer, however, had forced changes in the campaign which
 were in some respects fundamental.  During September the new
 direction; of the movement was clearly pointed out to mem-
 bers,of the non-Communist parties as well as to the rank and
 file of the Chinese Communist party.
 A People's Daily editorial on 5 September 1957 both ra-
 tionalizea the             of the early weeks of the campaign
 and presented the official outline of the coming phases. The
 most conspicuous new feature of the revised campaign was that
 it would combine the original rectification movement with the
 antirightist movement which had so unexpectedly interrupted
 it.   In addition, the campaign was greatly enlarged in scope.
 In the words of the editorial: "The rectification movement of
 the party and the struggle waged by the masses against bour-
 geois rightists now are undergoing expansion to become a rec-
 tification movement of all the people."
 The editorial maintained that in addition to the anti
 rightist struggle, a "great mass debate" would be developed
 among all, groups to examine "fundamental questions concerning.
 the socialist revolution and the socialist construction" of
 the country.  This description of the high-pressure propaganda
 campaign to wipe out all overt opposition to the aims of the
 regime became standard throughout the remainder of rectifica-
 tion.
 The "rectification movement of all the people" had two
 major goals, according to the People's Daily editorial. One
 goal was to "enable" the bourgeoisie, bourgeois intellectuals,
 and the petty bourgeoisie to "accept socialist transformation
 and to tread the socialist path."  The working class and the
 '!essential column of the Communist party," on the other hand,
 were to rectify working styles and overcome bureaucratism,
 subjectivism, and sectarianism.  The editorial admitted that
 these questions were different in nature but justified their
 inclusionin a single campaign on the grounds that the same

 methods--"criticism and self-criticism, and the great mass
 debate by reasoning through facts"--were to be used in each
 cased
 The editorial recounted the gains made by the party in
 enabling "many people to raise their political consciousness
 considerably within such a short period of time,,,  This did
 not mean, however, that there would be no further obstacles
 in the path of the rectification campaign.   "Even now," the
 editorial said, "there,are still many comrades who are skep-
 tical regarding development of the great mass debate in fac-
 tories and rural areas.."  These party members were described
 as fearing exposure and criticism by the masses and arousing
 rightists or "backward elements;"
 To comfort those who harbored these fears, the editorial
 put forward the official fiction that the reaction to the op
 ening of the rectification campaign was due entirely to "those
 smug rightists who were promptly surrounded by the masses and
 who suffered attacks launched from all sides and quarters."
 This reaction had been only a 'temporary phenomenon, according,
 to the editorial; during the "struggle to repel the rightists,"
 the rightists themselves "gradually realized their own mis-
 takesand now stand at the side of the masses,"  This turn of
 events, the editorial stated,  "serves to illustrate that the
 correctness of our undertaking is unquestionable,"  The edi-
 torial asserted that the "broad masses have resolutely ac-
 cepted Communist party leadership and have chosen the social-
 ist path,"  Shameful defeat was said to lie in store for any-
 one who attempted to resist this "will of the broad masses."
 Somewhat inconsistently, the editorial also extolled the
 advantages of "the turbulence of revolutionary struggle" and
 maintained that the struggle against ",among, reactionary words
 and deeds"provided cadres and the masses with the best educa-
 tion and training.  Alluding to the "hundred flowers" slogan,
 the editorial pointed out that "flowers which are cultivated
 in a hot house, free from wind and rain, may be fresh and
 pretty, but they are not possessed of much vitality,"  Thus
 the Chinese Communist party's official newspaper trod the
 narrow line between the insistence that all was peaceful and
 stable and the need to predict and oppose further struggle.
 The editorial then turned to a discussion of the great
 "mass debates" to be undertaken throughout the country; Cadres

 were urged to form the habit  ,of relying on the masses and
 consulting the masses when anything comes up."  Criticism
 should be'welcomed, the editorial said, because "the honest
 and open criticism of others creates a favorable objective
 condition,for one to rectify his shortcomings and mistakes
 and effectively insures that he will push ahead and improve
 his work."
 In afurther attempt to encourage apprehensive cadres,.
 the editorial made some unusually frank comments on rectifi-
 cation in the armed forces.   "Even in the people's army, the
 possessors of weapons,",it said, "the party has carried out
 thilitary, political, and economic democratization to a cer-
 tain extent and under centralized guidance."  As a result of
 these moves, the editorial continued, relations between of-
 iicers and soldiers and between the army and the people had
 become very close, and the morale of the troops was high.
 The editorial pointed out the applicability of this sit-
 iation to the over-all rectification movement:   "Since this.
 nethod can be adopted even in the army, why can it not be im-
 plementedin the factories and rural areas?  How is it pos-
 sible for; Communist party members to fear their own flesh-and-
 1lood relations, the Chinese people, when they are not even
 afraid of the imperialist reactionaries?"  This question
 throws a rare and revealing light on the actual relations
 between the party rank and file and the populace whom they
 ire supposed to cherish and assist.
 In the event that any reader should be so obtuse as to
 fail to appreciate tlielaid  oliterthe editorial al interpretation of
 with an explicit warning against a
 current propaganda:
 Of Gourse,-reliance upon the strength of the masses
 and:the solution of problems through mass debate do

 democratic centralization, and abandonment of labor
 andpolitical discipline.   On the contrary, the very
 purpose of debate is to strengthen leadership, cen-
 tralization, and discipline--not to weaken them. Even
 in the course of debate, there is absolute necessity
 to Observe definite centralization and'discipline, and

 anarchy will not be permitted.  Furthermore, discus-
 sions and debate must be conducted under proper lead-
 ership and in a systematic and planned manner,

 Even the party's alleged reliance on the wisdom of the
 people was subjected to qualification by the editorial
 We cannot expect the people to understand the truth
 of all.things all . bythemselves0.  Therefore it is
 natural for them to express erroneous opinions or
 be. temporarily swayed by erroneous opinions.  How-
 ever, if only we strengthen leadership instead of.
 abandoning leadership,. find how to educate the. masses
 with. their own personal experiences, and actively
 help the masses understand the over-all truth, the
 great.majority of the people will undoubtedly stand
 on the_correct.side after. holding discussions. and
 debate.
 Four months after the opening of the rectification cam-
 paign, the editorial admitted that "many" cadres below the
 provincial level were still not familiar with the nature and
 importance of the party's mass line.  The editorial all:too
 accurately forecast the character of the propaganda output
 over the following months:  ."In order to familiarize the cadres
 with the mass line, there is need to discuss it over and over
 again,. After correctly. solving a number of questions, the
 results should be carefully summarized and extensively pub-
 licizedo"  In an unwitting. commentary on Communist propaganda
 technique, the editorial then remarked that "after a time,
 the people will consider this a routine procedure.""
 The People"s Daily editorial of 5 September 1957 dealt
 largely with the problems of relations between party mem-
 bers, especially cadres, and the nonparty masses.   On 11
 September another editorial appeared on the question of "right-
 ists" within the party itself.   Entitled "Handle Innerparty
 Rightists Sternly," the editorial proposed to advance one step.
 further the discussions on the matter which the newspaper had
 initiated on 28 July.
 Most of the innerparty rightists, it was claimed, had
 joined the party "at about the time of. the nationwide libera-
 tion" (i.e. 1949),  The paper admitted, however,. that "there
 are also many..of.them who are veteran party members of 10 or
 20 years."   In spite,of.the presence of.these:traitors.within
 the ranks, the party was assured that "the overwhelming ma-
 jority of our party members, especially the overwhelming

 SEe
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 majority of our veteran party members, have...been willing
 to serve as staunch fighters for Communism."
 The problem of innerparty rightists would always exist,
 the editorial said, because however strict the selection of
 members, "there would always be individual class dissidents
 and opportunists who would succeed in sneaking into the party."
 As for those already in the party, "there would also be cer-
 tain party members, weak in will and vulnerable to corruption.
 by bourgeois ideology, who would deteriorate and change their
 characteristics."  These circumstances made it certain, ac-
 cording to the editorial., that in every revolutionary struggle
 there would always be a group of party members who would be-
 tray the party because their individual and class interests
 clashed with those of the revolution.   Cadres were thus in-
 formed that their vigilance against betrayal from within could
 never be relaxed.
 The major purpose of the editorial appeared in its accus.a-
 tiion that "certain cadres" had taken the struggle against in-.
 nerparty rightists much too lightly.    Even worse, "after the
 party central authorities ascertained the characteristics of
 the rightists and the guiding principle of meting out the
 same treatment to them within and without the party, they
 would tend to tolerate and overlook those 'party members' whose
 political'features are completely the same as the rightists
 outside of the party and would be reluctant to classify these
 persons as rightists."  The particular fault of these cadres
 was that they "would wail and become tenderhearted over cer-
 tain veteran party members who should have been classified as
 rightists."
 Since there were no differences in the characteristics of
 rightists in or out of the party, the editorial said, "the
 presence of rightists within the party is even more dangerous
 to our party and revolutionary undertakings" than the exist-
 ence of rightists outside the party.   If the existence of
 rightists in the party should be tolerated, it was asserted,
 "these rightists will collude with rightists outside the
 party to attack and oppose us from within."  These innerparty
 rightists were also considered more harmful because they could
 masquerade as party members and thus increase their "political
 capital" and more easily deceive the masses.
 The editorial maintained that undue consideration for
 "party standing" was partly to blame for an excessively tolerant

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 attitude toward innerparty rightists.   The proper attitude,
 the editorial said, was quite the opposite since, "in view
 of their long standing in the party and the service they
 rendered, it is all the more expected" that those Communists
 would not make mistakes.   "Being rightist is therefore an
 unforgivable state for them," the editorial maintained, and
 "they are not worthy of our pity."  Readers were reminded
 that "we must realize that this party of ours is a revolu-
 tionary fighting organ, not a sentimental faction."
 The editorial ended on a note of caution.   It recom-
 mended that party members not be summarily classified as
 rightists.  Only after the collection and analysis of evi-
 dence should such classification be made.  The note of cau-
 tion was nearly drowned out, however, by the exhortation to
 pursue the stern struggle against rightists.
 In the same issue of People's Daily, an article by the
 Chinese Communist party's personnel chief, An Tzu-wen, also
 dealt with the question of innerparty rightists and other
 ideological weaklings   The majority of the members of the
 Communist party were proved resolute during the "blooming and
 contending" campaign and the antirightist struggle, An said.
 He stated, however, that these movements had also resulted
 in the exposure of "a portion of Communist party members
 whose stand is not firm, who are ideologically inclined to-
 ward the right; there is even a very small minority of these
 members who have betrayed the cause of the proletarian rev-
 olution."
 The article proceeded to an analysis of the origins and
 motives of these innerparty rightists.   It cautioned that so-
 cial background does not determine everything about a party
 member, although members of nonproletarian origin should be
 subjected to especially close scrutiny.   It was pointed out
 that party members from nonproletarian classes had, "in the
 absolute majority of cases, accepted Marxist-Leninist educa-
 tion, changed their original character, and become fighters
 of the proletariat--many of them having sacrificed their lives
 for the cause of the party and the people."
 An explained the persistence of nonproletarian view-
 points as a result of the "peaceful" nature of the socialist
 revolution in China.  He noted that:

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 Precisely because the change of our economic foun-
 dation has been realized through peaceful means,
 and!on the ideological and political fronts there
 has not been a fierce class struggle--that is to say,
 a thorough socialist revolution has not been carried
 out !on the ideological and political fronts--those
 people who do not support, or even oppose, the so-
 cialist revolution still remain within the ranks of
 the revolution though their hearts are away from it.
 Though these people are inside the Communist party,
 they dream capitalist dreams.
 This. formulation, in addition to providing a rationaliza-
 tion for the continued presence of unregenerate Communists,
 linked the antirightist'struggle with'the rectification cam-
 Paign, since the campaign had often been defined as "the so-
 cialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts."
 An Tzu-wen made another contribution to the introduction
 of the t'new" rectification campaign in the form of an article
 In the China Youth News of 20 September 1957. Entitled "Refu-
 tation of die Rig zt a s on the Question. of Cadres Policy,"
 the article was a declaration of the necessity for political
 sophistication, as well as professional qualification, as a
 riterionfor selecting cadres.   The rightist criticism which
 1he article purported to refute was that the Communist party
 selected cadres solely on the basis of political reliability
 and without regard to real talent.  An accused the rightists
 of maintaining that political conditions should not be stressed
 during the period of construction and that the political sta-
 tus of cadres should not be considered.   "Obviously, such a
 view is absurd", he wrote.
 An'sargument against this view was that "if one is reac-.
 tionary politically, then the greater his 'talent,' the great-
 ~Ir the harm to the people's cause.  For his is not a 'talent'
 to serve the people but a 'talent' to oppose the people." An
 claimed that such cases had been numerous during the anti-
 rightist struggle.
 Another rightist criticism attacked by An was the accu-
 sation that the Communist party was guilty of sectarianism in
 its insistence that the vast majority of cadres in all activ-
 ities be party members.  An countered this accusation with a
 simple and convenient redefinition of 'sectarianism' in such
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18:   ff P79T01049A001900060001-4
 SECRET  .
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 a way as to absolve the party of guilt.   "Those who raise
 this question," he'wrote,."confuse party leadership with
 sectarianism.   If this state of affairs is`represented and
 opposed as a manifestation of 'sectarianism,' it would amount
 to liquidation of the leadership of the working class and of
 the Communist party."  An also adduced statements that the
 party was firmly opposed to sectarianism as evidence that it
 could not. be accused of practising this sin.
 An's article insisted on the fundamental importance of
 cadre policy as a factor bearing on the success or failure of
 the party's cause.  Notice was served that the party would
 remain.inflexible in this matter in the statement that "the
 working class and its.political party will not waver on such
 an important question of'principle."  An's primary point--
 that cadres must be politically qualified as a prerequisite
 for responsibility--became a major tenet of rectification
 during its latter stages under the slogan "Red and Expert."
 Members of the non Communist "democratic parties;" which
 had produced the most troublesome critics of the Chinese Com-
 munist party and its government during the opening phase of
 rectification, were also informed at this time of the official
 rationalization of the past summer's events and bluntly warned
 that compliance with the Communist party's program was the
 price of survival. This indoctrination was presented in a
 speech by Li Wei-han, chief of the United Front Work Depart-
 ment of the central committee of the Chinese Communist party.
 The speech was delivered on 15 September 1957 but was not
 published until 16 November, when it'. appeared In the Kwangming
 Daily--organ of the non-Communist puppet parties.   It is likely
 that the speech as delivered was even more firm and uncompro-
 mising than the published version.
 The topic;of Li's speech was the "self-remolding" of the
 minor parties.   Li began with the flat assertion that "all
 the democratic parties in China have always been and are still
 bourgeois political parties."  They differed from ordinary
 bourgeois parties only in that they had accepted the leader-
 ship of the Communist party in 1948 and 1949, although their
 "social basis" remained the same.   Measured by the six cri-
 teria laid down in Mao Tse-tung's speech on contradictions,
 Li said, the democratic parties contained "a small number of
 both leftists and rightists, with the great majority in the
 middle.   Most of these middle-of-the-roaders, he said, were

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 capable, "under the leadership of the Communist party, of
 Continuing to accept socialist transformation and changing
 from 'a capitalist to a socialist standpoint.   Indeed, a
 section of them now is almost leftist.''
 Li complained, however, that these non-Communist person-
 ages, even though impelled by the prevailing wind to move in
 the socialist direction, did not accept socialist transforma-
 tion wholeheartedly.   "Some even feel antagonistic," he ex-
 claimed.  This was a transitional state, Li said, and could
 4ot remain unchanged.  The only possible course open to these
 bourgeois survivors was presented in unambiguous language:
 !'As the tide of socialist revolution'sweeps forward, it is
 i-rong and indeed impossible to 'act cautiously to save one's
 skin,' to ''come to terms with the present,' or to 'straddle
 the fence',.'  There is only one way, and that is to accept
 socialist transformation actively."
 The existence of bourgeois rightists among the member-
 ship of the minor parties was explained by Li as a result of
 the "high; tide of socialist transformation" of 1955-56.
 Since that time, he said, "a bourgeois right wing gradually
 Crystallized out among the bourgeois elements."  This right
 wing, according to Li, reflected the stubborn opposition of
 a section!of the capitalist class.
 Li named three questions to be decided by the puppet
 parties.  These, with their self-evident answers, were in ef.-
 ect a                      survival program for the non-Communist parties.  The
 first question was "whether to follow the socialist road."
 dearly, no doubt could remain as to: the answer.
 The second question involved the proper functions of the
 non-Communist parties while their members were undergoing
 socialisttransformation. These parties, Li said, naturally
 represent the interests of the capitalist elements and bour-
 geois intellectuals who make up their membership.  He granted
 that "during the period of socialist revolution, the various
 democratic parties must follow the laws of development. of
 history and represent those interests and demands of capital
 .sts and bourgeois intellectuals that are in keeping with
 1$he development of the socialist revolution."  Primarily,
 ii said, the parties should represent the basic, long-term
 .nterestsjof their members by "helping them to accomplish

 socialist self-transformation, become masters of their own
 destiny, and look forward to ,a bright future."  That is, they
 were to lead their members:to total surrender to the Commu-
 nist party.'
 The third question was "one of sincerity in accepting the
 leadership of the'.Communist party."   Li remarked that this was.
 "the fundamental principle for judging whether the democratic
 parties can proceed along the.socialist road, gain the peo-
 ple's confidence, and permanently coexist with the Communist
 party."  Li removed any lingering misunderstanding by making
 it absolutely explicit that the Communist party's slogan
 promising "coexistence and mutual supervision" in its rela
 tions with the minor parties did not include any implication
 of coleadership.  The rightists, he.said, had "wanted the
 democratic parties to challenge the power of the Communist
 party and share leadership with it."  All in all, Li added,
 "the political line of the rightist drags'the democratic par-
 ties into the abyss of counterrevolution."
 Li Wei-han concluded his speech by laying down for his
 hearers the line by which they were to be guided during the
 remaining months of the rectification campaign:
 This rectification campaign is a great socialist rev-
 olutionary movement, politically and ideologically,
 It is of great historical import.  For all the dem-
 ocratic parties it is a severe test and a turning
 point in their fundamental transformation.   It is
 necessary for all the democratic parties to go into
 the rectification. campaign extensively and deeply,
 successfully pass this test, and lay a massive mile-
 stone on the route of their fundamental transforma-
 tion.

 Teng Isiao-ping Keynotes New Campaign
 The comments of the People's Daily, An Tzu-wen, and Li
 Wel-han on 'the subject of the course or the rectification
 campaign were, for the most part, addressed to specific audi-
 ences or concerned only with limited aspects of the campaign.
 The task of presenting a;detailed, comprehensive, and authori-
 tative statement on the shortcomings of rectification in the
 past and its proper course in the future was left to Teng
 HOiao-ping, member of the standing committee of the Chinese
 Communist party's politburo and chief of the party's secre-
 tariat.  The occasion for Teng's statement was the third en-
 larged plenary session of the eighth cnetral committee of the
 party, which he addressed on 23 September 1957.   This was the
 first plenary session of the central committee since November
 1956, whenMao had announced that a formal rectification cam-
 paign would be instituted.
 Teng began with comments on the general situation of the
 campaign.   He described the spread of the campaign from party
 and government organs to the lowest strata of society.   Teng
 reiterated the declaration of the People's Daily that the move-
 ment was to be broadened into a nationwide reMication. He
 cited the best possible authority for his remarks:   "an over-
 all appraisal of the nature and status of the rectification
 movement and the antirightist struggle, and clear-cut princi-
 ples for the development of the movement" offered by Mao Tse-
 tting at a conference of "some provincial and municipal com-
 mittee secretaries convened in July at Tsingtao."                       Teng added:
 "The nationwide movement is now developing successfully in
 cdmpliance:with the guiding principles of the central authori-
 ties.
 Teng's opening comments dealt with the antirightist as-
 pects of rectification.   He pointed out that "the significance
 o1 this criticism against the capitalist rightists should not
 be underestimated," giving as a reason the fact that "the
 socialist revolution on the economic front alone in 1956--
 cdncerningthe ownership of the means of production-is in-
 adequate and not consolidated."  Teng made enthusiastic use
 of the jargon which had developed in connection  with rec-
 tificationand the antirightist movement.  He credited "the
 great national debate currently under way" with having solved
 some of the major questions concerning the correctness and
 iiportance of the Communist program.

 Although Teng claimed that "the development of the move-
 ment during the.past four months and more has been fully com-
 patible with the analysis by the central committee and Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung,'" his ' definition of the aims of rectifica-
 tion provided a concept of the movement that differed markedly
 from that presented during the introductory and early phases
 of the campaign.   Teng said that "this movement aims at re-
 solving two sorts. of contradictions--contradictions between
 our enemies and ourselves and those among'the people them-
 selves.".  This is in considerable contrast to the banner
 headlines of the People's Daily-for 1 May 1957, which had
 proclaimed that rec  ficcat on would resolve contradiction
 "among the people" only.   The question of contradictions "be-
 tween our enemies and ourselves" had been treated as es-
 sentially solved and given scant attention at that time.
 As noted previously, the movement had evidently been conceived
 and initiated as a means of improving the "work style" of
 Communist party members in order to better relations between
 the party and nonparty masses and to make the party a more
 efficient tool for carrying out the ambitious economic plans
 of the regime.
 Teng, however, mentioned among the motives of rectifica-
 tion the "extreme necessity of conducting.a large-scale rec-
 tification movement among the fundamental column of the Com-
 munist party."  The first necessity, he said, was to wage
 "a resolute. struggle. against the capitalist- rightists and
 other antisocialist elements."  The reason for this, he said,
 was that these elements were "extremely wanton and vicious in
 their attack against the socialist path and the leadership of
 the Communist party.   They have a .platform, organization, and
 plan.   They aim at the restoration of capitalism and reaction-
 ary domination."  He failed to point out that this alarming
 situation had apparently been discovered only after the rec-
 tification campaign was under way, and that it had not'been
 taken into account in the original plan for the campaign.
 Teng echoed earlier statements in his assertion that
 "the party is fundamentally healthy and the overwhelming
 majority of party-member cadres are good."  -He justified
 continuation of rectification within the party, however, by
 stating that ''during the great blooming and contending of the
 masses, a considerable number of shortcomings in our work
 and in working styles were exposed--some of them quite seri-
 ous."  Meanwhile, he said there was still a small number of
 rightists among the party members and youth league members,
 and there were some others.who harbored serious rightist-in-
 clined ideas.

 Teng outlined the "correct methods" for handlingcontra-
 !idictionslamong the people in the familiar vocabulary of rectifi-
 ;cation:   "To practice great blooming, contending, and debating;
 to state!the facts and to explain the reasons; to produce posters;
 land to hold symposia and debate meetings."  During the great
 blooming; and contending, he said, "we light the fire to consume
 our enemies and our own shortcomings as well.   Both these.things
 !we :want . !'  Tang described fear of criticism and failure to. "trust
 the masses" as rightist-inclined views, thus emphasizing the
 seriousness with. which the party would regard cadres' failure
 to expose themselves to and accept criticism.
 The changes in the aims and methods of the campaign between
 May and September were also apparent in Teng's division of rectifi-
 cation into stages.   Earlier commentaries on rectification had
 spoken of three stages (see p.11), in which the emphasis lay
 entirelyon the correction of faults within the party.   Teng
 !named four stages through which rectification would be required
 ,to pass in party and government agencies from national to county
 .levels.   These were: (1) Blooming and contending--with simultan-
 eous  rectification and improvement;   (2) Repulsion of rightists
 --with simultaneous rectification and improvement;   (3) Vigorous
 rectification and improvement; and (4) Study of relevant docu-
 !ments, criticism and introspection, and individual elevation.
 It will be seen that Teng's fourth stage comprised all of the
 rectification campaign as originally conceived; the three pre-
 ceding stages became necessary because of the unforeseen reac-
 .tion aroused during the opening weeks of the movement.
 Teng implied that some agencies had successfully completed
 the first two stages by the time of his speech.   "In all agencies
 where the antirightist struggle has gained a decisive victory,"
 .he  said,   efforts  should  be  -exerted  to  make  the
 timely transition to the third stage of emphasizing rectifica-
 ltion and improvement, as well as to conduct systematic criti-
 cism of bourgeois ideas."                          He took the precaution of adding,
 however,!!lthat "if more rightists are discovered during the
 third and fourth stages, or if known rightists remain with
 their heads held high, opposition to these rightists would
 naturally remain a task.  Accordingly, these four stages must
 not be regarded too rigidly."
 Teng also declared that rectification need not run its
 full course down to the lowest levels.   He acknowledged that

 "some situations are. different from those. in official , agencies,,
 and the stages in the development of.their movements are thus not
 entirely the same."  While it,is necessary to conduct socialist
 education among farmers and workers, he said,  "only a small part
 of them should conduct criticism and self-criticism, just as,
 it would be impossible to require everyone to follow the ex
 ample of the official. agencies in studying..documents, criticism,
 and introspection;." Teng also included students,         those,.
 who "should continue blooming and contending anshould urge.._
 and assist the leading cadres during the stage of rectifica-
 tion and improvement.; they themselves, however, are not re-
 quired.to emphasize rectification and improvement as much as
 the leading cadres are."  His hearers were thus reminded that
 cadres would not be permitted to overlook their own faults in.
 their zeal to correct the faults of.others;
 Teng next,discussed rectification as it applied to the
 bourgeoisie and intellectuals.   In accordance. with Communist
 dogma that intellectuals do not constitute a class in themselves,
 Teng was compelled, to justify treating the two groups together.
 This he did: by asserting:,  "In the . present. situation of. our
 country, most intellectuals do come from bourgeois and petit-
 bourgeois family backgrounds, and the education which they re-
 ceived was in the bourgeois style,,. For the sake of convenience
 they are therefore, grouped together with the bourgeoisie""  Teng
 announced unequivocally their ultimate fate:   "Elimination of
 the bourgeoisie is a fundamental question of the socialist rev-
 olution,"
 Teng's remarks reflected the disillusionment of the party
 leadership with respect to the degree to which the bourgeoisie
 and intellectuals had been persuaded to accept Communist leader-
 ship.                    "The bourgeoisie, especially their intellectuals," he
 said,. "now constitute the main force that can challenge the
 proletariat..   Politically they still have status, capital,
 and influence, and the proletariat needs their knowledge." The
 only way for bourgeois intellectuals to avoid a fatal clash with
 the proletariat, Teng added, was to transform  themselves so as
 to serve the interests of the socialist economic foundation.
 Teng maintained the'pretense that the bourgeois "democratic"
 parties might, still play a meaningful role.   He reiterated the
 claim that "the. party, carries out the guiding principle of long-
 term coexistence and mutual supervision with regard to the demo-
 cratic parties.   Within the academic and cultural fields, the. party

 calls on all schools of thought to contend and all flowers
 to bloom.'!  He added the restriction, however, that "so-
 cialism is the premise for all these guiding principles and
 policies."   Teng repeated the official explanation of the
 abortive "liberalization" policies of the early phases of
 riectification in his assertion that "encouraging 'poisonous
 weeds' togrow is done only to educate the masses through
 negative examples and to use them as fertilizer in the train-
 of the proletariat and the masses."
 Tenggave a great deal of attention to the shortcomings
 of the intellectuals.   Only a small number of them had be-
 come leftists, he said, while many were still "thoroughly
 immersed in the bourgeois world outlook."  To reform the
 intellectuals ideologically, Teng stated, was a long-term
 task which might take ten years or more.   Meanwhile, he
 advocated the creation of a new group of intellectuals of
 working-class origin:
 With 'a view to the successful building of socialism,
 the working class must have their own technical
 cadres; they must also have their own professors,
 teachers, scientists, journalists, men of letters,
 artists, and Marxist theoreticians.   A group on
 suchia scale cannot be formed with a small number
 of people.   The whole party must endeavor to cul-
 tivate revolutionary experts.
 This"virtual abandonment of the attempt to convert
 existing intellectuals in favor of a drive to cultivate
 a group of thoroughly proletarian intellectuals--a drive
 characteristic of the latter months of the rectification cam-
 paign--againillustrates the profound changes which had taken
 place in the campaign since its inception and which the party
 leaders were attempting to gloss over.
 Teng's speech dealt at length with the problems of
 political, and ideological work in rural areas.   The emphasis
 was largely on the need to strengthen and consolidate agri-
 cultural cooperatives, especially by increasing capital funds
 and development of cooperative-owned capital construction
 pro ects.'  Teng foreshadowed the "leap forward" of 1958 by
 declaring that, following the "great debate" between so-
 cialism and capitalism, another such debate on agricultural
 production and construction "will give impetus to an up-
 surge" during the winter.

 Teng, of course, strongly urged rural cadres. tofollow
 closely the party's "mass line" in.the course of their opera-
 tions.                   In advocating the mass line., Teng made an unusually
 frank statement regarding oneof the principal motives be-
 hind this method of encouraging mass participation.in party
 programs:
 If we allow the broad masses to discuss and make
 decisions on the undertakings launched by..us,.all
 will bear the responsibility of, failure and a lesson
 will thus be learned.   Such a practice is of great
 importance to the consolidation of unity and the.
 correction of errors.   Cadres on the basic level
 should be trained to pay close. attention to this
 at all times.
 Teng's remarks on rectification among the working class
 were relatively limited,,presumably because this aspect of
 the campaign. had"Mot,produce'd.the 'd t f:icul`ti_es` `that . had :-a`risen,
 with respect to the bourgeoisie and the intellectuals, nor
 was it as important to the economy as the stabilization of
 agriculture.   Teng urged that cadres participate regularly
 in physical labor and that they "plunge deeply into actual
 production,.. establish close relations with the workers, and
 show concern for the pain-and hardship of the masses, so
 that they may make the worke.rs.feel at home while living
 with them.   All privileges in livelihood enjoyed only by the
 cadres should. be resolutely abolished."
 Teng. touched lightly on the question of rectification
 among the minority nationalities.   He particularly attacked
 local nationalism and "great. Han. chauvinism," the two bug-
 bears of minority policy.   Teng demonstrated a willingness
 to recognize realities regarding these matters by declaring
 that "it should be pointed out to cadres and members of the
 upper strata=of the minority nationalities" that these two
 tendencies were a "danger to the.unity and unification of
 the various nationalities of'the socialist motherland."
 Teng also dealt-briefly with rectification among the
 armed forces.   A few rightists had been discovered, in the
 armed forces, he said, "but the composition of the armed
 forces in general is comparatively pure."  Teng commented
 that after the conclusion of the  antir?ightist struggle,
 rectification in the armed forces should concentrate on  the
 working style of the officers.   He noted, for example,, that,
 !'relations between the forces and local party and government
 organs have. not been close."

 In discussing the specific application of rectification
 to problems within the Communist party, Teng returned to a
 considerable degree to the original aims of the campaign.
 He attributed the party's difficulties to three factors:   first,
 most of the party members came from  nonproletarian families;
 second, party organs were developed at such a speed that the
 quality of members was neglected and ideological and political
 work failed to keep abreast of development; and third and most
 important, the great majority of party members, admitted
 to the party in an environment and at a time when victory had
 already been achieved, lacked genuine socialist awareness at
 the time of admission.
 During the third and fourth stages of rectification,
 Teng said, problems within the party should receive more at-
 tention than those outside.   He urged that the party "hence-
 forth endeavor to choose for promotion to cadres persons of
 fine character who are of worker and peasant origin."  This
 was to correct a situation arising from the fact that "during
 acertainperiod in the past we absorbed too many young in
 tellectuals who had not undergone productive labor, steeling,
 and actual struggle for work."  Teng also declared that "an
 appropriate plan should be mapped out to enable graduates of
 universities, colleges, and technical schools to do manual
 work in production organizations suited to their specialties""
 for at least one year after graduation.
 Teng devoted disproportionate attention to a question
 which was not a major part of rectification and must there-
 fore have been one which was proving troublesome to the party
 at the time of his speech.   This was the so-called "local-
 ization of cadres" which Teng defined in his complaint by
 stating that "some people even hold the sentiment of wishing
 to cast out cadres from other localities."  Teng declared
 that party: cadre policy had never been governed by the prin-
 ciple of localization of cadres.   He justified assignment of
 "outside" cadres to certain areas by stating that "localism
 and Communism are incompatible," and that selection and pro
 motion of local cadres must necessarily continue to observe
 the principle of the dual requirement of political and pro-
 fessional qualification.
 A re-emphasis on the original aims of rectification--
 after three months of concentration on the antirightist.
 struggle--was especially apparent in the final section of
 Tong's speech devoted to the party's faults and the methods
 td be used in overcoming them.   Pointing out the party's
 mdre glaring defects, Teng rioted that "many regulations and
 systems are unreasonable, impractical, and redundant," and
 Ipproved For Release 2000/04/    IA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 SE

 that there were "indications g f.; excessive, centralism as. well
 as divisionism."  Healso,,noted.that 'many organizations and.
 persons had shown indications of, .."seriously, alienating them-,
 selves from reality and the. masses.".  These , people,:. Tang
 said, had been busy with their functional duties and. had had
 few contacts with the masses; therefore they had little under-
 standing of the problems confronting the. masses,  The third
 major def'ec:t among.party_member.s was that "numerous cadres.are
 arrogant and self-satisfied, think of themselves as always
 right, ignore the mass line, and fail, to. consultthe masses
 on all matters.,''
 Teng presented a three-point. program for correction of
 these faults within the. party during the remainder, of the
 rectification campaign.   Under the heading "overcoming Sec-
 tarianism and the Deviation toward Special Privilege," he
 observed that members of the Communist party "must be  just
 and selfless, join the masses, and share the bitter and
 sweet in life." .,Party members,Teng said, should have more
 friends and closer associations with the  nonparty masses
 and personages.   He.declared that there should not bea great
 difference between the living standards . of cadres and.masses.
 The second part of the program presented by Teng was
 concerned, with correcting irrational practices,, making "ap-
 propriate adjustments".i.n, the relations between the party and,--
 the government and between higher and lower levels, and correct-
 ing excessive centralism.   Teng cited As a basis for effecting
 these improvements, three documents which had been drawn up
 by the politburo and submitted to the plenary session of the
 central committee prior to his speech.   These documents con-
 tained the decentralization plan, under which a considerable
 amount of authority in certain types of enterprises would
 be shifted fr6m higher to lower levels.   "'Such change,"
 Teng said, "'definitely means an improvement in the present
 systems."
 Under the second part of his program, Teng discussed
 at some length the necessity for a "vigorous retrenchment"
 in the "excessive number of functionaries in party and gov-
 ernment organs and nonproductive personnel in enterprises and
 public institutions."  These "inflated and overstaffed organi-
 zations," he said, "had also contributed to the growth of sub-
 jectivism and bureaucratism,"  This enforced migration of
 cadres from urban centers to the countryside became a cons-
 picuous feature of the rectification campaign during the fol-
 lowing months.   Tong pointed out and subsequent rectification
 propaganda endlessly reiterated that these measures would

 have two beneficial results:   the efficiency of the organi-
 zations involved would be raised through savings in man-
 power and money, and an army of "steeled cadres who are de-
 voted to the cause of Communism and can weather storms"
 would be created.
 Teng's third proposal was for the purpose of "broaden
 ing democracy among the people and continuing to strengthen
 the democratic system."  This meant, in effect, methods for
 putting the regime's programs into effect with the least
 possible resistance among the people.  Teng stressed the use
 of persuasion and education as a means to this end.  He
 repeated the slogans with which the campaign had opened:
 that rectification would be conducted like a "gentle rain or
 mild breeze" and under the banner of "unity--criticism-
 Unity.
 Tengclosed his speech with a plea for greater attention
 to work improvement.   Pointing out that performance in this
 regard had been better in some areas than in others, he
 warned against using the -antirightist struggle to cover
 up mistakes and to "evade rectification and improvement and
 sneak over the hurdle."  In the course of improving work,
 Teng said,,, "our slogan for the masses should be:   Express
 your opinions resolutely, boldly, and thoroughly.    Our slogan
 fOr leading personnel should be:   Improve work resolutely,
 booldly, and thoroughly.'

 High-level Promotion of the Campaign, November 1957
 The People's Daily editorials of'early'September 1957
 and Teng  s ao-p ng, s report to the third plenary session
 of the eighth central committee of the Chinese Communist
 party set the course which the rectification campaign-was
 to follow during the remainder of the year and, in many
 important respects, throughout the remainder of the cam-
 paign.,                      The only further fundamental development which the
 campaign was to undergo began early in 1958, when rectifica-
 tion was merged with the "great leap 'forward" in economic
 progress.   During the intervening months, however, the
 rectification movement continued to dominate domestic pro-
 paganda and. its doctrinal basis was' elaborated by comments
 in the People's Daily and statements by major leaders.
 The People's Daily editorial of 1 November 1957 was
 entitled    he ll- eeople Rectification Campaign Is an Im-
 portant Development of the Socialist Democracy of Our Country
 The editorial followed Teng's example'by setting "contradic-
 tions between the enemy and ourselves" ahead of "contradic-
 tionswithin the 'ranks of the people" as targets for the cam-
 paign.   The methods used to resolve these contradictions, the
 newspaper said, had given rise to "a new type of socialist
 democracy compatible with the current political and ideological
 socialist revolution.
 The editorial harked back to the rectification campaign
 of 1942 in order to demonstrate the innovations of the current:
 movement. ' The former movement,  it said, had been carried
 out by means of systematic criticism and self-criticism,
 and had enabled all Communist party members to correct their
 mistakes and raise their ideological standards.   The earlier
 campaign was also characterized by the use of wall posters
 and the convocation of symposia, according to the editorial.
 The paper stated that subsequent reform programs had used the
 method of "reasoning struggle" and that mass criticism and
 self-criticism had been "universally adopted" in factories,
 rural areas, schools, and the armed forces,
 These "traditional democratic methods," the editorial
 said, had recently developed into "a complete new form of
 socialist democracy characterized by 'contending, blooming,
 and debating." By these methods,  it was claimed,  "all problems
 are solved quickly, totally, and finally."
 The'editorial disparaged those who feared, this process
 and claimed that the regime's, program had the support 'of the
 -71-

 Approved For Release 2000/*1S : CIA-RDP79T01049A001900060001-4
 great majority of the people.   In support of this contention,
 the editorial gLsserted that the'main force of the revolution
 inChina had been "the most oppressed and suppressed strata
 inthe old society --the workers, poor peasants, and lower-
 middle peasants."  These and others who support 'socialism
 were said to account for approximately 90 percent of the
 country's population.   As for the remaining 10 percent, the
 editorial stated,,not all "were resolutely opposed to social-
 o
 fm, either,."  In fact, t socialism, and claimed,
 those only   been isolated
 of ;the people opposed among the masses.
 The editorial described the inception of the antirightist
 campaign in somewhat sanguine terms:   "At the height of the
 'contending' and 'blooming' by the rightists, there seemed
 to'be a little turbulence in the revolutionary regime."  The
 silver, lining in this cloud was revealed, however, when "as
 soon as the masses clearly identified this enemy and launched
 an attack on him, the revolutionary regime not only stopped
 the turbulence but also became 100 times more consolidated."
 Should "blooming and contending" not be permitted, the ed-
 itorial said, minor disturbances, and perhaps even major ones,
 would break out.
 The editorial admitted that the campaign had departed
 at times from its intended gentle nature.   This was justified,
 however, because "since the outset of the rectification cam-
 paign, theirightists have attacked us with stormy force."
 Although the masses had been obliged to retaliate in kind,
 the newspaper said, "this campaign will eventually return to
 its 'breeze and gentle rain' character in the end."
 Another significant comment on rectification appeared
 on 1 November in the form of a statement by Ko Ching-shih,
 first secretary of the Shanghai Communist party committee.
 Several ofIKo's pronouncements on rectification received
 national attention, and he was elevated to the party's polit-
 congress.

 in the city had entered the third stage of rectification and
 improvement.   Ko?pointedout,  however,` several significant
 faults in the movement.  Most noteworthy was his statement
 that "a majority of leading cadres hesitate to admit their
 mistakes and shortcomings and thus hesitate to reform."  A
 large number of leading cadres, Ko said, had "committed form-
 alism and; bureaucracy in accepting proposals and criticisms

 of the masses and in carrying out.the work, , of ,rect if i:cation
 and improvement."  Many units, he added, had taken action to
 overcome mistakes and,shortcom.ings,  "but their.actions were
 only superficial and not basic."
 Ko demanded that. leading cadres be the first to improve
 their work and rectify their working styles, since      rectifi-
 cation and improvement' means to improve work and to rectify
 the working style of the whole party.'.`  He implied a tendency
 toward complacency by declaring that "it is wrong to think that
 the rectification campaign is over as soon as the 'blooming'
 and 'contending' and the antirightist struggle have been con-
 cluded."
 Ko called attention, as had the People's Daily editorial
 of the same day, to the "illogic, impracticality, and contra-
 dictions,in many regulations and systems."  He asserted that
 many leading cadres allowed important matters to be disposed.
 of by lower-level personnel, called too many meetings to dis-
 cuss matters. both essential and nonessential, did not follow
 the "mass line," or failed to practice diligence and thrift.
 Leading cadres should not only overcome such defects,.Ko said,
 but should. also strive to raise. their ideological level.
 . Ko referred also to,the. ,,"problem of cadres participating
 in manual and production-work."  He pointed out--somewhat
 inaccurately--that this was the basic system of the nation,
 and he called upon leading cadres to. practice frugality,  im-
 prove their relations with the masses, and train themselves
 in factories, in schools, or in the countryside.
 Mao Tse-tung himself provided an interpretation of the
 rectification campaign on 6 November 1957 in the course of
 a speech in Moscow on the occasion of the celebration of the
 40th anniversary of the October. Revolution.   While granting
 due deference`to the example of his. Soviet hosts, Mao assert-
 ed:                  "The Chinese revolution has its own national characteris-
 tics, and it is entirely necessary to take these into considera-
 tion."  He spoke with pride of his regime's accomplishments,
 claiming that "in the short period of eight years, China has
 already achieved in various fields of construction results in
 it was not able to achieve in the past 100.-years."  Mao dis-
 missed rather casually the severe criticisms directed against
 the Communist party during.., the previous summer'-
 In China a. handful of bourgeois rightists try to oppose
 taking the path to socialism and oppose the leading
 position of the Communist party.in national life, as

 well as the close union between China and the
 Soviet Union and the other socialist countries.
 Their vain efforts have been utterly defeated by
 the, counterattack of the people throughout our
 country.
 In describing the rectification campaign, Mao returned
 to the emphasis with which the campaign had begun and men
 tioned only that it was "a campaign to'resolve correctly
 the contradictions which actually exist among the people
 and which have to be resolved immediately by means of a
 .nationwide debate which is both'guided and free, carried
 :out in the urban and rural areas."  Mao did not refer to
 .the need to resolve contradictions between "ourselves and
 .the enemy" which had been given primacy by the People's
 :Daily and Teng Hsiao-ping during September--an omission
 whin may have been due to a desire to place China's in-
 ternal situation in the best possible light for his non-
 Chinese audience.
 Maoclaimed great successes for the rectification cam-
 paign and added:   "We are now carrying forward this people's.
 self-education campaign among our 600,000,000 people, stage
 by stage:and section by section, and it is probable that in
 .another few months nationwide success will have been achieved."
 He failed to explain the circumstance that six months pre-
 viously the campaign had been intended to last only six months.
 Maodiscreetly claimed credit for invention of the rec-
 tification method:  "In many years of revolutionary practice
 we have developed the method of the rectification campaign
 in accordance with the Leninist principles of keeping in
 close contact with the masses, recognizing the initiative of.
 the masses, and practicing criticism and self-criticism."
 He announced that in the future there would be periodic rec-
 tification campaigns "every year or every other year" as one
 of the main methods of resolving various social contradictions
 in the country "during the whole period of transition."  He
 said, however, that these subsequent campaigns would be much
 short:   than the current one.
 On the same day on which Mao spoke in Moscow, Liu Shao-
 chi delivered an address in Peiping celebrating the same oc-
 casion.                          Liu paid perfunctory respects to the occasion and then
 turned to a discussion of the current situation in China and
 the progress of rectification.   He declared that although the
 "socialist revolution in our country in the ownership of the
 means ofproduction was in the main completed in 1956," a
 mere change in the economic system was insufficient and that

 "the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working
 class is not yet at an end." Only socialism could save China,
 he said, and it was a."sheer hoax" "that' socialism could be
 built without party leadership or without the dictatorship of
 the proletariat.
 Liu identified the unforgivable sin of the "bourgeois
 rightists" when he said they "actually oppose Marxism-Leninism
 itself."  They were certain to be defeated, he said, because
 of the general; trend toward the road'to socialism which must
 be taken--"the only difference being that the majority are
 going ahead on their own accord, while a minority do so under
 compulsion."  Liu presented this process as an inexorable one
 in which "there may be a difference in precedence, but no
 freedom of standing still."
 Liu discussed rectification itself in terms of the ac-
 cepted cliches, defining it as "a full and frank expression
 of opinions,  general debates, wall posters, discussions, forums,
 and so on."   He defended the "democracy" embodied in the rec-
 tificationprocess and attacked those rightists who complained
 that there was'only,centralism but no democracy in the country.
 Liu resorted to the same imagery which Teng Hsiao-ping had
 used in September in his declaration that "the flames of full
 and frank criticism will burn out not only the enemy, but our
 own shortcomings and mistakes as well."
 Liu gave considerable attention to the need for rapid
 economic progress.   He urged "quantity, speed, quality,  and
 economy" in building socialism--a slogan which became the
 watchword of'the latter.stages of the rectification campaign.
 Liu spoke of the necessity for austerity and increased ac-
 cumulation onthe part of individuals and organizations as a
 condition for achieving these. goals.
 Liu also touched on the "red and expert" theme, stating
 that the working.ciass must have its own force of scientific
 and technical personnel, its.own pkofessors, teachers, scien-
 tists, journalists, writers, artists, jurists, and Marxist-
 Leninist theorists.   He acknowledged that this force would also.
 include "all those~intellectualswho, though coming from the
 old society, have been-really remolded and firmly take the
 working-class stand."' 'This force of working-class intellectuals,
 Liu said, must be 'a vast one, a small number would not do.

 Vigorous Implementation of the Campaign, November-December 1957
 On 21 November 1957, Hsi Chung-hsun, secretary general of
 the State Council, delivered his "second rectification campaign
 mobilization report."  nisi spoke to a meeting of cadres of the
 various offices and organs under the direct control of the State
 Council.  The party organization of these governmental offices
 became the spearhead of the campaign, and periodic reports on
 the progress of rectification at this level were used as guides
 for forthcoming developments atlower echelons.
 Hsi 'began by stating bluntly that it could not be assumed
 that all personnel of state organization were serving the cause
 of Communism devotedly and responsibly.   "The state demands the
 ,roper transformation of each and every one of us," he said.
 This was'to include the eradication  of even the smallest short-
 comings,Hsi stated, since "a number of veteran cadres of from
 10 to 201, years' standing sometimes commit mistakes because of
 these  'small shortcomings.'   Hsi admitted that there were also
 :'some cadres who have not been transformed at all."
 Hsi.Chung-hsun described the rectification campaign as only
 a transient matter, while the struggle between the bourgeoisie
 and the proletariat--"particularly their struggle on the polit-
 ical and; ideological fronts"--was a long-term task. The "up-
 surge inithe present revolution," however, was an opportunity
 for the party to conduct "a systematic and thoroughgoing social-
 ist education program among the great masses of cadres and the
 people. Hsi'!s report, like Teng Hsiao-ping's in September, fore-
 shadowedthe coming link between rectification and the "great
 leap forward."  Hsi declared that "without a number of revolu-
 tionary,sudden progressions, it would be impossible to build
 socialism."  He stated that in his opinion, "the all-people
 rectification campaign this year is a sudden revolutionary pro-
 gression.  The forthcoming upsurge in socialist construction in
 rural areas will constitute another sudden revolutionary progres
 pion."
 Hsi criticized the progress of "contending and blooming" and
 complainejd that some units imposed restrictions regarding matters
 to be discussed.   Even the private lives of cadres should be dis-
 cussed, he said, "if the private life involves the violation of
 aw and discipline."  Hsi said that within the secretariat of the
 State Council the major fault in criticism  and discussion was
 that few:big issues which needed radical correction had been
 ;touched on.'Such issues were'the most difficult',to talk about, he
 added, and thus this situation was natural.   InJthe future,

 however, "blooming.'and contending',' should'be carried out more
 deeply and in. a mor,e. thoroughgoing, manner."
 As for-methods of conducting"blooming and contending,"
 ,'Hsi recommended wail posters as "not merely one'wayp'but,the
 principal way."  He;said the-various-state organizations had
 posted more than 220.,000 such posters and advanced more than
 380,000 "rationalization proposals."  The number of wall posters
 and the number of problems. they subf-it, Hsi claimed, would de-
 termine the extent of an upsurge. in. contending sand blooming.
 "The masses.," he stated,-"hold that 'symposia serve the purpose
 ofgiving a warning in. comparative privacy and wall posters
 serve the purpose of doing so in public'; this shows that wall
 posters are. loved by the. masses."  For this reason, he continued,
 "wall posters should be used a.s the principal means of conduct-
 ing contending and blooming.                     Symposia aid debate conferences
 can only be'considered as'auxiliary means for doing so."
 Hsi found fault with the progress of rectification and im-
 provement as well as with contending and blooming.  The leaders
 of some organizations, he said, "should realize that contending
 and blooming has been conducted solely for the purpose of recti-
 fication and improvement.   For this reason,.after contending
 and blooming, rectification and improvement must follow.   If
 they fail to dovetail with eath other, the campaign will cease
 to progress."
 Hsi cited three reasons why the campaign seemed to have
 lost must of its vigor.:   "l) lack of experience; 2) the inepti-
 tude of the leadership in treading the mass line and its lack
 .of courage and resorcefulness in carrying out this work; and
 3) the practice of treating this work in the same way as common
 matters are treated."  This last'practice, he said, was tanta-
 mount to attempting to overcome bureaucratism by bureaucratic
 means.
 Hsi reminded his listerners that rectification was a revo-
 lutionary movement and that "we should not be too gentle in this
 work."  On the contrary, he said, "we should break out of the
 old rules with which we used to confine ourselves in the past."
 If the leadership adopted a "great, fighting spirit in conduct-
 ing this campaign," the faults noted above could be corrected.
 Hsi cautioned, however, that the work of the campaign should
 be carried out systematically as well as seriously.
 Hsi discussed at some length the policy of sending cadres
 .to lower levels for physical labor.   A number of units had taken
 advantage of this work simply to get rid of some cadres, he said,
 but "this is not correct."   The policy was not intended to "get
 rid of the bulge" or to "haul in the sails," Hsi maintained, but

 to "make over-all arrangements for over-all transformation."
 It would result, he said , in the establishment of "an  army
 of cadres who have,struggled for the cause of Communism, who
 have been trained, and who are able to survive trying circum-
 stances"  He added that it would be only   matter of time
 before "each cadre, particularly each young intellectual, under-
 goes this course."                                                           '
 Hsi was frank in his presentation of the difficulties of
 the program.   He said that "some have painted a beautiful pic-
 ture ofliving conditions in rural areas," but that "this is
 not realistic."  If the picture is.,too beautiful, he claimed,
 the. cadres are bound to be diga,ppointed when they get there.."
 Hsi admitted that transfer. to rural areas involved a "cata
 clysmicchange" for the person concerned.  Therefore, he said,
 "it is better to tell them realistically and to prepare them
 mentally!; otherwise, after you push them into that envioronment
 they will one day come back and grumble at you."  In another
 note of 'realism, Hsi recommended that the transfer of cadres be
 done selectively "so as not to add to the troubles. of the peas-
 ants."
 In another statement on 5 December 1957,before a conference
 of the. Communist party committee for the central government
 agencies!, Hsi Chung-hsun again spoke bluntly on the progress of
 the rectification campaign.   He said that inadequate rectifica-
 tion and!improvement remained the major shortcomings,. and that
 as a means of correcting this situation, leading organizations
 !should "master the trends in the wall posters" by assigning
 them serial numbers and organizing them into sequence for anal-
 ys.is .
 Hsi again concluded his statement with a reference to the
 downward transfer of cadres.   Notice was served unequivocally
 on those in authority that no delay would be tolerated:   "This
 is a rather urgent problem--one in which the leadership either
 takes the initiative or else loses it, with the consequence of
 hindering progress in the rectification campaign."  Hsi claimed
 that many persons had "applied" for transfer to lower levels
 and that the various localities had made preparations for them.
 "Any lack, of enthusiasm in this matter," he threatened, "would
 result in undesirable consequences."
 The Chinese Communist press reported about this time that
 more than 810,000. personnel had been transferred to lower levels
 throughout the country.   In the future, it was predicted, the
 number of, persons to be transferred to the "labor front and to

 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 lower levels for practical training" would far exceed this
 figure.   Some of those already transferred were said to be
 intellectuals who had not had any experience in productive
 labor,  -Others were cadres from "administrative organs,
 business- units, and enterprises, and personnel holding such
 positions as, messenge_rs,, servants, and probational employees,"
 who.were "comparatively more familiar with rural and low-level
 work."
 In the 15 major provinces and three major municipalities
 of China a total of 575,000 persons were reported to have been
 'sent down."  Some 303,000 of these had been assigned to the
 "labor front," while the remainder had obtainedwork.in,basic-
 level organizations.,  The report spoke enthusiastically of the
 results of this, movement, claiming that "many intellectuals who
 used to find it hard. to identify the five, grains and ,who used
 to 'take wheat sprouts for leeks' had now gained much agricul-
 tural knowledge,"  Many of the.cadres who used to "cover their
 noses with handkerchiefs when they.came across a dunghill now
 scramble to carry baskets loaded with dung,"  according to the
 report o
 On the other side of the picture, it was reported that
 state-owned enterprises in Peiping had reduced the ration be-
 tween administrative cadres and workers from 38,4 to 11.2 per-
 cent.   In Tientsin, it was claimed, 80 to 90 percent of the
 cadres in some government organizations had applied for "pro-
 ductive-labor-in factories or farm work.in the countryside."
 Comparable statistics were (cited for many other areas through-
 out the country.
 Another major statement on the progress of rectification
 was made on 9 December by Chiang Hua,. first secretary of the
 Communist party committee of-Chekiang Province.  The signifi-
 canceof this report is indicated by the fact that it was?sub-
 se.quentlypublished by the People's Daily,-which allotted 'it
 two full pages and commented editorially that "the questions
 dealt with in the first part of the report are nationwide, not
 just local in character.,"
 Chiang reviewed the course of the rectification campaign
 with the customary bland assertion that the antirightist aspect
 had been intended from the beginning   As for the current
 status of the campaign in his own province, Chiang said, most
 of the leading organs above the-county level had obtained "pre-
 liminary experience," and that cadres had "begun to master the
 new working style of socialist democracy."  Practice had shown
 that the instructions. of the Communist party central committee

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04118 : CIA-RDP79T01049AO01900060001-4
 and of Chairman Mao had been absolutely correct, Chiang said,
 but "it must be pointed out that the socialist revolution we
 have carried out on the political and ideological front during
 the past year is still in the process of gradual development
 on the basis of studying, practicing, and accumulating ex-
 perience."
 The heart of Chiang's report lay in his discussion of cer-
 tain "diverse views" which had existed in the party.  With un-
 usual candor he admitted that "in the course of this great
 .change, the understanding of certain questions has not been
 entirely; unanimous in the party."  Citing the authority of
 "the directive of the party central committee and Chairman
 Mao"--presumably the directive which inaugurated the recti
 f ication campaign on 1 May 1957--Chiang offered four "expla-
 nations": in connection with these divergent views.
 First,Chiang said, "there appeared an extreme rightist
 tendency, and a 'leftist' tendency" during the first half of
 1957.  Those guilty of'the extreme rightist tendency failed
 to discern that contradictions "between the enemy and our-
 selves" still existed, while the second tendency exaggerated
 such contradictions.  Both of these views were held within
 the party, Chiang stated, and should be corrected by a care-
 ful assessment of the motives of those who offered criticism,
 so that those who were merely confused or mistaken would not
 .be wrongly regarded as "enemies."
 Chiang next pointed out that "many comrades" failed to
 realize 'that "the situation develops with intermittent tensed
 .and relaxed periods along a winding and complicated path of
 progress."  For this reason, he said, "with the decisive vic-
 tory ac'ieved in the antirightist struggle and with the class
 enemies forced into retreat, relaxation may appear  in the
 struggle at certain periods."  Chiang warned, however, that
 under certain conditions the rightists might again launch new
 attacksagainst socialism and that "fluctuations of this kind
 in the struggle will occur repeatedly for a number of years."
 Chiang's third point referred to the significance of civil
 disturbances--a rare admission that such disturbances had oc-
 curred.; Chiang mentioned specifically certain incidents which
 had resulted in "the disintegration of many agricultural co-
 operatives" in one country of his province.  This had been bad,
 he said, but it had had a good effect in the end.

 After the. provincial. and district committees dispatch
 functionaries to strengthen leadership and  sum up ex-
 periences and lessons, it became possible to rectify
 effectively'the'rightist ideas and the bureaucratic and
 commandist working :methods on the part of certain func-
 tiona res,, to strike down the destructive activities
 mounted by the enemies, and to develop the socialist
 education campaign in the rural areas.`'
 Chiang's fourth "explanation" dealt: with the ."new form'
 of the mass lime--large scale blooming, contending, debating,
 and posters."  Many comrades had not yet fully realized the'
 advantages of these methods, he said, while some "appeared
 to lack determination and. confidence" in them "for fear that.
 they would incur difficulties, would lose out in debates with
 others, or would 'draw fire on themselves." -Chiang advised
 the universal panacea of "confidence'in the masses" as a remedy.
 Chiang;. concluded. his report with a,reminder that. "improve-
 meint in work is equally as important as the antirighti.st strug-
 gle."  He said that work improvement was only beginning, and
 that leading organs should conscientiously strengthen leader-
 ship over this . aspect of the campaign'.

 "Rectification" Firmly Linked to Economic Upsurge.
 With the opening of the new year the rectification cam-
 paign entered its last major phase.  This was heralded in the
 People's Daily editorial for 1 January 1958 entitled "Ride
 to Wind an   reak the Waves:"  The editorial began with the
 observation that "the thoughts of man usually fall behind
 realitywith respect to an adequate estimation of develop-
 ments affecting the objective situation."   In a mood of
 exuberant optimism the, paper maintained that the events of
 1957, both international and domestic, bore out this conclu-
 sion.   With regard to the international situation, the
 editorial quoted the slogan used by Mao in Moscow that "the
 east wind prevails over the west wind"; domestically, the
 rectification campaign was cited as one of the "brilliant
 victories" achieved by the people during 1957.
 The editorial pointed out that the rectification cam-
 paign was not over, however, since "what remains to be done
 is to resolve contradictions between the remaining bourgeoisie
 and the proletariat and between the capitalist path and the
 socialist path during the period of transition."  This strug-
 gle between the capitalist and socialist paths was a con-
 tradiction "between the enemies and ourselves" in compara-
 tively few instances, the editorial said, "while in the
 greater number of cases it proves to be a contradiction
 within the ranks of the people."
 The editorial declared that the current task of the
 rectification campaign was to strive for complete victory
 on all fronts before May 1958.  The campaign, it said, had
 been a "motive force pushing forward the work in all fields,
 and should be regarded as the 'key to all activities."'  The
 paper urged all-out efforts to carry the,., rectification cam-
 paign to';people throughout the whole country.   The editorial
 expressed the conviction of its writers that "victorious
 completion of this campaign will give our society a new
 appearance and stimulate the energetic initiative of the
 people as never before.   It will unleash an immense tide of
 growth in industry, agriculture, and all other constructive
 work."
 Therectificatiopcampaign was thus officially harnessed
 to the drive for economic progress. "Using the great achieve-
 ments of',the rectification camapign, the successful completion
 I

 of the First Five-Year:', Plan, and other favorable, conditions,"
 the paper said, "'we must mobilize all positive factors and
 apply ourselves to all the construction projects, with  in-
 dustry and frugality as the guiding principle.., and,'on the
 basis of quantity, speed, quality, and economy, create a
 victorious beginning for the Second Five-Year Plan."
 On 19 January 1958, Hsi Chung-hsun, secretary general
 of the State Council, spoke again on the subject of rectifica-
 tion.  His words, blunt and to the point as usual, indicated
 clearly the new direction which the campaign had taken.  Hsi
 criticized the campaign's progress.in familiar terms and
 emphasized the continuing danger of rightist errors both
 within and outside the party.   These errors, he said, were
 evidenced by undue conservatism and failure to keep up with
 the masses (i.e., the demands of the party) in the headlong
 plunge toward socialism.
 Hsi then specified the first step by which rectifica-
 tion would be called upon to aid the economic drive.   "At
 the advanced stage of the rectification campaign,"' he said,
 "an antiwaste movement should be carried out."  Hsi declared
 that "all our central state organs, whether they be indus-
 trial, cultural, or educational, are guilty of some waste in
 spending their construction and administrative funds."  This
 state of affairs, he said, must be "clarified from an ideo-
 logical point of view and solved once: and for all.'"  Other-
 wise, he stated, it would be "impossible for us. to carry out
 the policy of the Communist party central committee to build
 our country industriously and economically and to do so on a
 larger, quicker, better., and. more economical scale."
 It was. apparent from Hsi's final remarks that pursuit
 of the rectification.campaign.had been causing interference
 with the performance of day-to-day functions.  Hsi advocated
 equal attention to the tasks of handling rightists, carrying
 out the rectification campaign, and continuing regular opera-
 tional work.  He said it should be possible for these tasks
 to be carried out without their interfering with each other.
 Hsi pointed out, however:   "It should be realized that it
 is possible to make up for regular operational work later
 on, if such is sacrificed for the, sake of the rectification.
 campaign.   But if the rectification campaign is sacrificed
 because of operational work,-it may become,impossible to
 solve some ideological questions--a matter of much greater
 importance."

 Perhaps as a counterbalance to Hsi's remarks, __P_____e__o__p~le's
 Daily a .few days later published another report by  _~,~ Ching-
 shih, first secretary of the Shanghai Communist party com-
 mittee,calling attention to some of the original goals of
 rectification.  The paper endorsed Ko's views highly, saying
 that his report was "worthy of conscientious study because
 it is filled with revolutionary spirit."  Ko particularly
 attacked the bureaucracy of some cadres, pointing out that
 "the views voiced by the masses highlight their dissatisfac-
 tion with the 'bureaucracy' practiced by these party cadres."
 People's Daily commented that this passage of the report
 was very good and went on to offer some further comments on
 the subject.
 The paper observed that the "bureaucracy" which Ko
 Ching-shih had attacked was, in fact, "our most dangerous
 enemy."   It defined this bureaucracy as "a working style
 which is divorced from the masses."  The paper pointed out,
 however, that since "as little as 10 percent of our working
 personnel are guilty of this working style," people should
 not make the rightist mistake of regarding all Communist
 party members and government personnel in that light.
 The editorial warned that the struggle against bureaucracy
 would be a long one since "in a socialist society, or even in
 a Communist society of the future, contradictions between the
 leaders and the led may exist for prolonged periods."  Such
 contradictions were said to belong to those within the ranks
 of the people, however, and should be treated according to
 "democratic methods through logical reasoning, not by force-
 ful suppression as exercised against the enemy."
 On 2 February 1958, People's Dail  formally launched the
 antiwaste campaign which had been anticipated by Hsi Chung-
 hsun a fortnight earlier.   Citing a report delivered before
 the National People's Congress by Li Hsien-nien on the previous
 'day, the editorial proposed the slogan "Oppose waste and
 Ibuild the country on the basis of industry and thrift" as a
 ,guide for action for people throughout the country.
 The days preceding the fifth session of the National
 .People's Congress in February were utilized by the "democratic"
 parties for meetings at which each party formally expelled
 from its ranks those who had been accused as rightists dur-
 !ing the months since mid-1957.  On the day before the congress

 officia--llyconvened, the standing committee announced the
 removal from office of the three non-Communist ministers
 who had been the principal subjects of attack during the
 early phase of the ""antirightist struggle."
 As its first item of business, the congress considered
 a credentials report which stated that 16 rightists ""who
 had betrayed the fundamental principles of the Constitution"
 had been recalled by their electoral districts.  Another 38
 rightists whose constituencies reported that they should
 be recalled were cited in the credentials report.   Ten of
 the latter had held posts on the standing committee of the
 National People's Congress and on the National Defense
 Council.
 On its opening day the congress also heard a report by
 Li Hsien-ni.en, vice premier and minister of finance, on the
 implementation of the 1957 state budget and the proposed
 budget for 1958.   Li praised the achievements of 1957 which,
 he said, had overfulfilled the economic plans for the year
 and thus assured fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan.
 These achievements, Li said, were also ""eloquent proof of
 the immense vitality of the socialist system and a rebuff to
 the slander of the bourgeois rightists regarding our country's
 financial and economic condition."
 Li admitted there.had been some temporary and local
 difficulties in carrying out financial and economic plans
 and said the rightists had "rejoiced at our temporary
 troubles."'  They had been proved wrong, he asserted, and now
 "we even want to thank them, because like poisonous weeds
 turning into fertilizer, their attacks have greatly helped
 to raise the consciousness of the working people to new
 heights and thus have greatly pushed forward the movement
 to increase production and practice economy."'
 The final section of Li's report was an appeal to "op-
 pose conservatism and.waste, and ensure the implementation
 of the 1958 state budget with a large-scale movement to in-
 crease production and practice economy."  The situation was
 favorable for such developments, he said, since "on every
 front of our national economy there has now arisen a gigantic
 upsurge for socialist construction, aiming at greater quantity,
 faster speed, better quality, and greater economy."  Li said
 that rectification had contributed to this situation because

 "in the process of rectification, the broad masses of work-
 ers and staff members made many proposals to overcome waste
 and to'do more things with less money.,,
 Li claimed that "the rectification movement is develop-
 ing and penetrating into the basic units, the factories, mines
 and enterprises, and the agricultural producers' cooperatives."
 The campaign, he said, would "continue to impel leading per-
 sonnelat various levels to rectify their style in work, to
 go down among the masses and into the actual work of produc-
 tion.": Li had high praise for this program and added:  "This
 kind of change in the style in work of leading personnel at
 various levels will certainly help bring about a tremendous
 growth of industrial and agricultural production in 1958."
 Li stressed the need to expand and develop the movement
 to increase production and practice economy in order to ren-
 der possible the "gigantic leap in production" contemplated
 for 1958.   In the course of the rectification campaign, he said,
 it would be necessary that "every enterprise, every economic
 department, and every unit should set aside ten days or so to
 launch frank and full expression of opinion and debates on the
 question of opposing waste and mobilize the broadest masses to
 wage an uncompromising struggle against all waste."
 The other major report to the National People's Congress
 was that delivered by Chou En-lai entitled "The Present Inter-
 national Situation and China's Foreign Policy."  Chou began
 his report with a tribute to the rectification campaign, al-
 though it was not precisely germane to the matters under con-
 sideration.   In the latter half of 1957, he said, the Chinese
 people,"led by the Chinese Communist party and Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung," had "repulsed the frenzied attacks of the bourgeois
 rightists." Chou stated that the rectification campaign,  "which
 continues with growing intensity, enables our people to take
 great forward leaps in construction, filling them with enthu-
 siasm and fresh ardor and infusing an unprecedented new spirit
 into our work in various fields."  Echoing the exuberant tone
 then prevalent in official statements, Chou added: "Our nation
 rides the rising tide; it is driving full steam ahead in the
 work of!socialist construction."

 Economic Goals Emphasized,. Other Reaffirmed
 "The rectification campaign is giving rise to a new 'flood
 crest' in all enterprises, undertakings, and government organ-
 izations,".announced a People's Daily editorial on 18 February
 1958  That is, the newspaper continued, "a new high tide of
 contending and blooming and a new high tide of administrative
 improvement designed to combat waste and conservatism are be-
 ing raised.'"The editorial reported that in. the course of
 this.high-tide the personnel of, governmental organizations
 in Peiping had put out 250,000 wall posters, and. the workers
 and office employees of 31 enterprises in the city had put out
 200,000 posters and offered 430,000 suggestions--all within
 a period of 20 days.   This .''grand movement" was said to be
 aimed at;+thoroughimplementation of the principle of doing
 .more, faster, better, and more economically in national con-
 struction and at the promotion of a big leap forward in pro-
 duction and work!'
 The editorial declared that combating waste and conserva-
 tism had become the central problem of the rectification cam-
 paign.   "Judging by what is taking place in various districts
 and government organizations and enterprises," it continued,
 "the present movement against waste and conservatism differs
 from all previous increase-production and practice-economy
 movements in that it has actually become a struggle against
 all backward: phenomena in the ideological, political, and
 economic fields and that it has brought about a high tide of
 emulation."  It was claimed that the movement was "obviously
 an outgrowth of the socialist revolution on the political and
 ideological fronts which began last year throughout the coun-
 try.'
 While reaffirming the emphasis on economic matters, however,
 the editorial reminded readers that the original goals of rec-
 tification could not be ignored.  The editorial accused some
 units of lacking a thorough knowledge of the situation with the
 result that they neglected "ideological work, concerned them-
 selves only with economic problems, and simply took some tech-
 nical measures instead of seriously developing popular debate
 and completely changing the methods of work and style of lead-
 ership."  The proper procedure, the editorial said, was to
 tackle: both the economic problems and the ideological and po-
 litical problems so that "through contending, blooming, and
 debate we should not only combat waste and conservatism but
 also combat bureaucracy, sectarianism and subjectivism."

 The campaign to "combat waste and conservatism"--pro-
 moted on a national scale by the People's Daily on 2 Febru-
 ary 1958 apparently to last a few weeks--was extended on
 3 March by a Communist party central committee directive
 lengthening it two or three months.  During the last days of
 February and the month of March, the "leap forward" received
 added impetus as the production goals which had been set forth
 at the National People's Congress were surpassed verbally by
 new "fighting targets"--supposedly advanced by the workers
 themselves in individual factories and in whole industries
 throughout the country.  By early April, Hu Yao-pang, first
 secretary of the Young Communists League, spoke of a new
 "workers' target" of an increase of 33 percent in industrial
 production for 1958--a considerable contrast with the goal of
 14.5 percent presented to the National People's Congress in
 February.
 Further reports on the number of cadres "sent down" to
 work in the countryside, factories, or in basic-level organ-
 izations at this period indicated the rapid pace at which this
 part of the program was being carried out.   The New China News
 Agency; reported on 23 February that 1,300,000 cadres had al-
 ready departed for the countryside or lower levels, more than
 half a million more than in December.   Reports indicated that
 a total, of about 2,750,000 cadres were slated for such treat-
 ment in the various provinces and municipalities throughout
 the country.   It was announced that the program was to be com-
 pleted by April 1958.
 At the end of February 1958, People's Daily published an
 article by Chou Yang, a deputy direr or of tie Communist party's
 propaganda department.   The article was said to have been written
 "on the basis of a speech made at an enlarged session of the
 Communist party group in the Union of Chinese Writers on 16
 September 1957, with revisions and additions, and after ex-
 changes of opinion with comrades in literary and art circles."
 Chou Yang has frequently been given the assignment of laying
 down the law in cultural circles for the apparent purpose of
 correcting any misapprehensions that might arise regarding the
 means of distinguishing "flowers" from "weeds."
 Chou Yang justified his attention to the "great debate on
 the literary and art front" by asserting that "literature and
 art are the barometer of the times; whenever any drastic change
 is about to take place in the situation of the class struggle,
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18:.CIA-RDP79TO1049A001900060001-4
 SECRET
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04/18 CIA-RDP79TO1049AO01900060001-4
 signs of it may be seen on the  barometer.."   He then proceeded
 to embed nuggets of advice to authors in a matrix of illogic
 and propaganda which repeated and exaggerated the official ex-
 planations of the "rightist attacks" of the previous summer.
 Chou Yang declared that "one's attitude toward the Hun-
 garian episode has become an important criterion by which one
 .maybe judged as to whether one is a true Communist and a true
 revolutionary."  He returned to this theme repeatedly through-
 out his long and rambling article.  Chou, aftor asking rhetor-
 ically whether one ought to. be a revolutionary or a reaction-
 ary,.answered his own question unequivocally: "Now that we
 are at the stage of socialist revolution, we must oppose cap-
 italism and follow the socialist road if we are to remain
 revolutionaries.   If you want to follow the capitalist road,
 then you are a reactionary.  These.are the only alternatives;
 there.is no middle road."  This provides a good example of
 the sort of."debate" which characterized the latter stages
 of rectification.
 Chou Yang enunciated another rule that furnished the text
 for many pious sermons on the function of the arts in the new
 society:   "In a socialist society individualism is the root
 of all evil."  He solved the many contradictions in. his theses
 by ignoring them:
 Socialist literature and art must take over all the.
 fine traditions of the past literature-and art, and
 our writers must learn.from their predecessors. But,
 since our literature and art are called socialist
 literature and art, they can only take the Communist
 world outlook as their ideological basis.   Therefore
 they must, as the "Communist Manifesto" points out,
 effect "the most radical rupture with traditional
 ideas."
 Total Capitulation of the Puppet Parties, March 1958
 The. final phase of the rectification campaign was marked
 by the complete submission of the "democratic" parties to the
 overlordship of the Communist party.  The minor parties had
 never had any real independence, of course.  The most embar-
 rassing.of the attacks on the Communist. regime during the
 early days of rectification, however, had come largely from

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2000/04/185    gFP79T01049A001900060001-4
 men who occupied prominent positions in these parties, and
 the surrender of the 'puppet parties to their Communist mas-
 ters in mid-March 1958 was a complete, final, and highly
 publicized conclusion to that troublesome :phase of rectifi-
 cation
 The necessity for sincere acceptance of Communist lead-
 ership.had been one of the essential points made by Li Wei-han
 when he lectured the non-Communist parties in September 1957
 on their future conduct.  From that date until January 1958
 these parties maintained a silence that was broken only oc-
 casionilly by the exposure of some newly discovered rightist.
 As noted above, all eight democratic parties met in January
 1958 and dismissed their rightist members from office.   on
 March 1958, the standing committee of the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Council,official mechanism of the united
 front, dismissed its rightist deputies.  Their rightists hav-
 ing been disposed of, the puppet parties could then turn to
 the second requirement laid down by Li Wei-han--the "self-
 transformation" of their members.
 The movement for self-transformation was ostensibly set
 in motion on 24 February 1958 by a resolution of 17 scientists
 in Shanghai who challenged their colleagues to become truly
 "red" experts by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan.   The
 challenge was taken up by one of the democratic parties on the
 next day, and on 28 February representatives of all the dem-
 ocratic parties and of the "nonparty bourgeoisie" met and de-
 cided to launch a national competition in self-transformation.
 A mass meeting was held on 16 March as the first step in the
 campaign, and a charter was adopted which was intended to pro-
 vide the bourgeoisie with a standard of conduct and ideology
 by which to guide their progress.
 The charter opened with a reference to the "inspiring
 leadership of the Chinese Communist party and Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung," under which "the people of our great motherland are
 moving 'ahead along the socialist road like 'a ship riding the
 waves with full wind in its sails.",  The charter pledged the
 democratic parties and "unaffiliated democrats" to work "with
 revolutionary drive so that we may as quickly as possible
 change ourselves from bourgeois to working people living by
 our own labor, from bourgeois intellectuals to  working-class
 intellectuals who are ideologically socialist and profession-
 ally expert."  The charter then listed a number of specific
 pledges of action by which these goals would be attained.

 A gathering of 10,000 non-Communist."leaders" of the.
 bourgeoisie was held on the day following adoption of the
 charter in,the great square which is the usual scene of mass
 demonstrations in Peiping.   The parade was amply covered in
 the press, most fulsomely by the Kuang Ming Daily, spokes-
 man for the democratic parties.  According to that newspaper:
 "The parade is beginning.    Men's hearts are leaping, their
 blood is boiling, their feet move toward the left,'"  As the
 demonstrators entered the squarey..the paper said, they lifted
 their heads and gazed "at the spot from which.Chairman Mao
 reviews the October and May. parades."" and seemed to say,
 "Revered and loved Chairman Mao, and.you other comrades of
 the. central committee, please review our parade?</div></div></div>  </div>
