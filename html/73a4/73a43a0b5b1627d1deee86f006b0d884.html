 THE SOVIET MILITARY POSTURE
 I.   The intelligence community has recently completed
 the annual review and up-dating of the package of
 National Intelligence Estimates which deal with
 the military capabilities of the Soviet Union.
 II.   Each successive year, we are able to base these
 estimates on improved and more comprehensive

 cated analysis.

 C.   Our estimates,  then,  show Soviet progress in
 both strategic attack and strategic defense.
 1.    We do not believe, however,  that the So-
 viets themselves expect to be strong enough
 by the mid-1970's to convince the Kremlin
 leadership that it can successfully risk
 launching an attack on the United States.

 MRBM-IRBM FORCE

 ?  25X1
 I.   During the past year there have been no major
 changes noted in the Soviet MRBM/IRBM force of
 about 600 medium and 100 intermediate range
 launchers.
 A.    While this force is capable of delivering
 a devastating attack on Eurasia--especially
 against European targets--it is also highly
 vulnerable because it is predominantly soft
 and concentrated.
 B.    Future developments in the MRBM/IRBM force
 will probably feature greater dispersion of
 missiles in hardened sites and mobile
 launchers.   Mobile launchers could be con-
 cealed and moved at irregular intervals,
 making it difficult to determine their
 number and location.   Mobile launchers
 could also be shifted to meet such contin.-
 gencies as an increased threat from China.

 2.   The strength of Soviet tactical aviation
 is concentrated primarily in the Euro-
 pean U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe.
 VI.   The Soviets continue to help the East European
 satellite forces to modernize and improve their
 military capabilities.  Paradoxically, this im-
 provement comes at a time when these countries
 are showing increased political independence.
 A.    The East European governments can contribute
 about one million men and 42 divisions for
 early commitment to Warsaw Pact needs.
 B.    Among the East European armed forces, Hungary
 has made the greatest qualitative jump in
 the past year.  Of a total of six Hungarian
 divisions,  four are now considered combat
 ready.

 BRIEFING PACKAGE                            January 1967
 THE SOVIET ECONOMY
 Introduction
 I now want to discuss the economy of the
 Soviet Union, but first I should probably apol-
 ogize to those of you who are going to feel that
 this is  the second or third time you have heard
 this briefing.
 I can only offer you the explanation of the
 schoolboy who was accused of copying his brother's
 theme on the family pet--it's the same dog.
 By and large,  the Soviet economy has the
 same strengths,  the same weaknesses,  the same prob-
 lems that it had a year ago, and two years ago, and
 three years ago. Only the figures have changed--
 to protect the jobs of our analysts.
 I intend, therefore,  to skip some of the de--,
 tail that we have covered before, and concentrate
 on the highlights and the latest figures.   There
 will have to be a certain amount of repetition,
 however,  to give you a balanced and a comprehen-
 sive picture.

 BRIEFING PACKAGE
 January 1967
 I.      The Soviet economy is somewhat less than half
 the size of the U.S.  economy. The Gross Na-
 tional Product of the U.S.S.R.                      for 1966 is
 roughly 45 percent of the U.S. GNP.   Indus-
 trial production lies in about the same
 proportion--somewhat less than half of U.S.
 industrial output.
 A.    The Soviets,  however, do not allocate their
 output the same way that the pie is divided
 here in the United States.   The Soviet con-
 sumer is way down in the pecking order,
 and winds up with barely more than half of
 the national product.
 (CHART, US AND SOVIET GNP BY END USE).
 B.    As a result, as this chart for 1965 shows,
 Soviet expenditures for defense are able to
 approach our own.   Outlays for investment
 are more than two-thirds those of the U.S.

 As for consumption,  the Soviet population
 which is nearly one fifth larger than ours
 gets only about one-third as much in total
 consumer goods.
 (CHART, US AND SOVIET NATIONAL POLICY EXPENDITURES)
 C.    Soviet economic policy is further illus-
 trated by the comparison of a group of
 strategic components of GNP that may be
 termed national policy expenditures.   They
 include defense,  foreign aid, education, and
 industrial investment.
 1.   Although the total Soviet economy. is
 less than half the size of ours,  in
 1965 they virtually matched our expend-
 itures in these critical fields sup-
 porting foreign policy and the domestic
 economy.
 2.   They accounted for nearly two-fifths
 of total GNP in the U.S.S.R.,  but less
 than one-fifth in the United States.
 3.   The comparisons for 1966 will be quite
 similar.
 II.   Soviet GNP grew by 7 percent in 1966.   This
 rate was well above the average 1961-65 growth
 rate:.of 4 1/2 percent.

 (CHART, US AND SOVIET AVERAGE ANNUAL GNP GROWTH RATES)
 A.    In 1966 the U.S.S.R. had the largest grain
 harvest in its history because of favorable
 conditions. Net agricultural production
 rose by an estimated 7 percent in 1966 com-
 pared to an average annual rate of about
 2 1/2 percent in 1961-65.  Last year's rate
 of increase in agriculture cannot be main-
 tained.   Hence,  the 7 percent rise in GNP
 in 1966 should not be interpreted as a re-
 turn:to the high growth rates of the 1950's.
 (CHART,-US AND SOVIET ABSOLUTE GNP)
 B.   From 1951 to 1960 the Soviet growth rate
 averaged twice that of the U.S.--6 versus
 3 percent.   In this period the absolute
 gap between the two economies actually de-
 clined a little.
 C.   Since 1960, however, both economies have
 grown at about 4 1/2 percent.   The absolute
 increase in the U.S. has been twice that of
 the U.S.S.R.   The gap between the two eco-
 nomics has therefore increased rapidly and
 steadily.

 (CHART,     INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, US vs USSR)
 D.   The increase in Soviet industrial production
 in 1966 was above 7 percent for the first
 time since 1962.   This rate is an improve-
 ment over the average annual rate of 6 1/2
 percent for the early 1960's.   On the other
 hand,  it is below the 9 percent average in-
 crease of the 1950's.
 E.   Two factors explain most of the lower in-
 dustrial growth rate of the 1960's.
 1.   First,  the Soviets have not been.able
 to maintain the rate of growth of in-
 vestment in new plant and equipment.
 2.   Second,  the defense and space programs
 have taken the high-quality resources
 needed to modernize industry.
 III.   Military and space spending remained fairly stable
 between 1962 and 1965.   We estimate, however,
 that in 1966 outlays on military and space pro-
 grams were up by 7 percent.   Soviet plans for
 1967 seem to include a further substantial rise.
 The resource commitment to defense will continue
 to act as a drag on the whole economy.

 (CHART, TOTAL DEFENSE EXPENDITURES and proportion
 devoted to exotics--R and D, advanced weapons pro-
 curement, etc.)
 A.      Advanced weapons and space programs require
 the best and scarcest inputs of skilled
 scientists and engineers, new alloys and
 other high-cost materials, highly sophis-
 ticated electronics, and the most advanced
 industrial processes.
 (CHART, SPENDING FOR R AND D, etc.)
 B.    Soviet spending on military research and
 development,  the space program,  and the
 procurement of advanced equipment for mis-
 siles, radars, and nuclear programs are
 growing much faster than total military
 spending.   They have more than doubled
 since 1958.   Most of this increase has oc-
 cured as a result of the rapid growth of
 expenditures on research and development.
 C.    The state budget for 1967 includes an in-
 crease of 1.1 billion rubles in the ac-
 knowledged defense budget.   Additional spend-
 ing on defense, however,  is concealed in
 other budget allocations such as scientific

 research.   Changes in these hidden expen-
 ditures may be more influential in determin-
 ing the final size of defense spending than
 shifts in the explicit budget.
 IV.      The poor performance in Soviet agriculture since
 the late 1950's has been another major reason
 for the general slowdown in over.-all growth of
 GNP.
 A.   The problems here are chronic--the inherent
 deficiencies of the collective and state
 farm system,  some important limitations in
 soil and rainfall,  the difficulty in train-
 ing enough skilled farm managers and me-
 chanics,  and the basic problem of insuffi
 cient incentives for the farmers?
 (CHART, TOTAL AND PER CAPITA: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION)
 B.      Soon after Khrushchev's ouster in late 1964
 the new leadership announced an ambitious
 and expensive program to boost farm output.
 On a per capita basis,  agricultural produc-
 tion remained below the 1958 level until
 last year.
 1.   The new program calls for investment of
 $80 billion in Soviet agriculture in

 1966-70,   twice the rate of the preced-
 ing five years.   This investment in-
 cludes
 - provision of large quantities of
 chemical fertilizers;
 - drainage or irrigation of millions
 of acres;
 - supply of thousands of additional
 tractors and other farm equipment;
 and
 - construction of many new repair
 shops and farm buildings.
 2,.           In 1966, this agricultural investment
 program already was showing signs of
 lagging.   The program was huge to start
 with, and the good 1966 crops may have
 weakened the government's resolution to
 pour large resources into agriculture.
 V.    Aside from defense and agriculture,  there is a
 more general reason for the slowdown of the Soviet
 economy.        The Soviets must pay a high price for future
 technological advance.

 A.   The easiest technological gains have been
 made,  including those gains taken over lock-
 stock-and-barrel from the U.S. and Western
 Europe.   Further technological gains will
 require more domestic R .and D--and more re-
 sources.
 B.   The system of management and incentives in
 industry places emphasis on physical out-
 put.   Many known technological advances do
 not get put into industrial practice.
 C.   Furthermore,  the Soviet system is notori-
 ously clumsy in meeting modern demands for
 a wider variety and assortment of products.
 D.   As a result of all this,  every percent of
 future growth is a little harder to achieve.

 (CHART, SOVIET FOREIGN TRADE)
 VI.    Total Soviet foreign trade has increased con-
 tinuously,  but the rate of growth has slowed
 down since 1962. The geographic distribution
 of trade has shifted,  however, reflecting
 both economic and political considerations.
 A. Soviet trade with the industrial West has
 been affected by the balance of payments
 problems.
 1.      Soviet leaders in 1964 and 1965 cut
 back imports of advanced equipment to
 make room for large-scale imports of
 Western wheat.   These have averaged
 more than $400 million. annually-over
 the..last:.four years.
 (CHART, THE HARD CURRENCY DEFICIT)
 2.   The Soviet Union has been unable to
 generate enough foreign exchange to
 buy large quantities of wheat,  and at
 the same time maintain other imports.
 B.    Even with the reduction in non-grain imports,
 the U.S.S.R. had to sell $1.5 billion worth

 dwindled to about $1 billion by the end of
 1965--only about one-third of the peak.level
 in the mid-1950s.
 C.   Medium-term credits  (up to 5 years) helped
 to finance plant and equipment purchases
 from the West during the early 1960's.
 They lost their utility by 1964 or 1965
 when the repayments began to offset the new
 credits.
 1.    In 1964 and 1965 the Soviet Union was
 offered $700 million in long-term credits
 for six to 15 years.
 2.    The Soviet leaders chose to take up only
 about $300 million, apparently because
 they were cautious about incurring a
 large burden of debt.
 D.    Last year, however,  the Soviet hard currency
 deficit fell to roughly $100 million, as ex-
 ports rose with little or no growth in im-
 ports.   The improvement in the Soviet balance
 of payments made large gold sales unneces-
 sary, and the Soviet gold reserve increased

 by roughly $100 million in 1966.   (Domes-
 tic production of gold was about $190 mil-
 lion in 1966.)
 E.   The improvement in the Soviet payments posi-
 tion in 1966 has been accompanied by a re-
 surgence of new Soviet orders for Western
 plants and equipment.
 1.      Roughly $750-800 million in new con-
 tracts were signed in 1966 with Western
 suppliers,  including the Fiat deal with
 Italy.   About three-fourths of these
 contracts involved long-term credit.
 :2.      Imports of equipment in 1967 probably
 will not exceed the $500 million average
 of the past two years,  because of the
 long lead time for delivery.   Imports
 of wheat in 1967 may fall to $200 mil-
 lion.   Consequently total Soviet im-
 ports from the industrial West probably
 will drop in 1967.
 :3.  The Soviet regime probably will continue
 to hold the lid on imports in order to
 conserve foreign exchange and to rebuild
 its depleted gold reserve.

 (REPEAT FOREIGN TRADE CHART)
 VI. Soviet foreign trade with the less-developed
 countries has been erratic--static in 1963-64,
 up sharply in 1965 and apparently up moderately
 in 1966.
 A.      This trade is largely sustained by deliv-
 eries under Soviet aid agreements and their
 repayment by the less developed countries.
 Growth will be sustained by large unspent
 aid commitments, and by a continuing Soviet
 interest in trade expansion.
 B.    Trade with other Communist countries con-
 tinues to grow,  but at a declining rate.
 These countries account for more than two-
 thirds of total Soviet foreign trade.
 1.   Soviet demands for higher prices for
 its raw material exports and East
 European requests for better terms of
 trade with the U.S.S.R. reflect in-
 creased economic self-interest by all
 parties concerned.
 2.   Both the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe
 have been looking more to the West,  in
 order to acquire the modern equipment

 main limiting factors.
 C.   The Sino-Soviet dispute has been reflected
 in the continual decline in Soviet trade
 with Communist China,  from a high of $2 bil-
 lion in 1959 to about $400 million in 1966.
 D.   Cuba is still dependent on Soviet willing-
 ness to take sugar at a high fixed price;
 in turn, Cuba buys Soviet machinery,  fuels,
 and raw materials.
 E.   Yugoslavia's improved relations with the
 U.S.S.R. are reflected in rapidly growing
 trade.   Cuba and Yugoslavia account for
 most of the rapid growth of trade since 1961
 in the "other" category.

 VII.  Foreign aid programs continue to be one of the
 most active and far-ranging instruments of Soviet
 foreign policy.
 A.      Aid has been extended to nearly all other
 Communist countries, and to 35 less developed
 countries in the Free World.   Both economic
 and military aid have been provided, and
 each is backed up by substantial technical
 support.
 B.      Soviet programs have been small in comparison
 to those of the United States.   Nevertheless,
 the Soviets have proven themselves to be
 lively competitors--not only against us,
 but against the Chinese--when it comes to
 seeking goodwill through aid in the less
 developed countries.
 1.   The long-range Soviet motivation, of
 course,  IS to win friends and converts
 to Communism.
 2.   The U.S.S.R. appears equally alert,  how-
 ever,  to exploit aid opportunities where
 the only prospective pay-off is the

 VIII'..   Total extensions of economic aid in 1966 amounted
 to about $1.2 billion, compared with the peak
 of $1.9 billion in 1964.
 A.   This chart shows trends in Soviet economic
 aid since 1954.   In general,  the year-to-
 year fluctuations do not reflect changing
 Soviet policies,  but merely changing needs
 and opportunities in the recipient countries.
 1.    The flow of aid extensions has been
 jerky,  partly because of economic emer-
 gencies, partly because of periodic
 commitments to such major programs as
 five-year development plans.
 B.   Economic aid to Communist countries, amount-
 ing to $7 billion, has been prompted by var-
 ious:'.special situations.   Four cpuntries,
 which have received more than $1 billion
 each, account for two-thirds of the total.

 1.   Cuba's trade deficits and the rehabilita-
 tion  of. itS dislocated economy have re-
 quired substantial Soviet aid.
 2.   Another high priority has been as-
 sistance to East Germany,  in its
 futile effort to compete with West
 German prosperity.
 3.   Development requirements in two of
 the more backward Communist countries--
 Bulgaria and Mongolia--also have led
 to large amounts of Soviet aid.
 C.    Known Soviet economic aid to North Vietnam
 approximates $400 million, most of which con-
 sists of credits extended during 1951-60.
 The amount of recent economic assistance to
 North Vietnam is uncertain but may be size-
 able.
 D.    Communist China is no longer a recipient of
 Soviet aid,  but it received extensions of
 some $500 million before the strain in Sino-
 Soviet relations ended the program in 1961.

 into a complex and varied program.   Credits and
 grants of $6 billion have been extended during
 the past 13 years.   Extensions in 1966 reached
 nearly $1 billion, or slightly less than the
 previous high in 1964.
 A.   Much of the Soviet aid to less developed
 areas is focused on the largest and most
 influential neutralist countries, and on
 a few countries situated along the Soviet
 Union's southern border.   India, the United
 Arab Republic, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and
 Iran have received nearly two-thirds of
 total Soviet economic aid to less developed
 countries.   More than one-half of the ex-
 tensions in 1966 consisted of support for
 India's new five-year plan.
 B.      At the same time, the Soviet Union is los-
 ing few chances to extend its influence and
 make mischief for the West by extending eco-
 nomic aid in small chunks to many of the
 newer African countries.   Even so,  it is en-
 couraging recipients to consider their ca-

 choosing among possible aid projects, so
 as to get the most   out of this assistance.
 C.    The burden of these programs on the Soviet
 Union is smaller than appears on the sur-
 :face.
 :i. Considerable time is needed to implement
 programs of project aid, and only about
 two-fifths of credits extensions to
 less developed countries have been drawn
 so far.  Current deliveries are being
 offset by repayments on previously in-
 curred debts.
 Repayments,  in fact, have already reached
 a level that is causing difficulty for
 some of the less developed countries.
 Several have recently received or re-
 quested a rescheduling of payments to
 ease the financial strain.
 D.    :[n spite of occasional political setbacks
 for the Soviet Union in countries receiving
 aid--for example,  the downfall of Ben Bella
 in Algeria and of Nkrumah in Ghana--the
 Soviet leaders apparently are convinced that
 the programs serve their long-term political

 X. Military aid has been one of the most dynamic
 tools employed by the Soviet Union in its re-
 lations with less developed countries in the
 Free World.   Such aid usually has had an imme-
 diate.political impact, and has paved the way
 for closer economic ties.
 A.      Since 1955,  the Soviet Union has extended
 an estimated $4.2 billion in military as-
 sistance to 18 less developed countries of
 the Free World.   As the chart shows,  exten-
 sions have not been as high recently as in
 the early 1960's, but deliveries have been
 continuing at a rate of several hundred mil-
 lion dollars annually.   About 80 percent of
 military aid extensions already have been
 drawn.

 B.   Indonesia and the United Arab Republic
 account for about 55 percent of Soviet
 military aid to Free World countries.
 1.   Their armed forces, and those of Af-
 ghanistan, Algeria,  Iraq, and Syria,
 are now equipped almost entirely with
 Soviet arms, and are trained in Soviet
 methods.   These and other less developed
 countries now depend heavily on the
 Soviet Union for ammunition, spares,
 and technical support.
 2.   This dependence gives the Soviets a
 certain amount of political leverage,
 which might be employed in a critical
 situation.
 3.   The Soviets are cautious in using such
 pressures, however, because of the risk
 of endangering long-run political rela-
 tions.
 C.    The Soviets are well aware that the real
 power in many of the less developed court=
 tries is: held by the.1 armed- :forces:..'  Thus,
 they have used military aid to establish

 who--if they are not in the government
 themselves--are in a position to influence
 the government's composition and policies.
 D.      Soviet objectives also have been served by
 the willingness of such countries as the
 United Arab Republic to re-export Soviet
 arms  (with Moscow's concurrence) to third
 countries.   In this way,  Soviet arms have
 been channeled to such countries as Algeria,
 Cyprus, and Yemen, as well as to dissident
 groups in the Congo and other trouble-
 spots in  Africa.
 E.   Initially,  the Soviet Union supplied. largely
 obsolescent weapons from existing stockpiles.
 1.    Since 1961, however,  it has increasingly
 provided Free World countries with ad-
 vanced weapons such as MIG-21 jet fighters
 and surface-to-air missiles.
 2.    Consequently, about two-thirds of the
 equipment delivered to date consists of

 F.      Scheduled payments on debts of about $2.4
 billion arising from Soviet military aid
 have become a serious drain on the econ-
 omies of some of these countries.   The
 Soviet Union has further ingratiated it-

 XI.   The goals of the new Soviet Five-Year Plan, running
 hroi.gh 1970,-show that the. Brez-hnev-Kosygin
 regime is making a determined effort to regain
 the economic momentum of the 1950's.
 A.    The plans provide for an average annual
 growth of 6 percent in GNP,  8 to .8 1/2
 percent in industrial production, and 4 3/4
 percent in agricultural production.   We do
 not believe the regime will be able to
 achieve such high rates of increase, unless
 unexpected successes are scored in expanding
 agricultural production and in improving the
 efficiency of industry.   We anticipate a
 continued drain of high-quality resources
 into military and space production.
 B.   In industry,  the growth rate may improve
 slightly over the 6 1/2 percent average of
 1961 to  '65.   The Soviet leadership is pin-
 ning many of its economic hopes on a series
 .of reforms in industrial management.   These
 reforms may ultimately improve the function-
 ing of the system.                                   In our judgment,  however,

 they do not provide the essential flexibility
 and incentives necessary to a modern eco-
 nomy.   Specifically,  they do not solve the
 critical problem of introducing new tech-
 nology and new products into industry.
 C.   If the new regime's program of massive in-
 vestments and financial incentives are im-
 plemented, agricultural production should
 rise by an average of 3 or 4 percent a year
 over the balance of the decade.   Traditionally,
 programs for agriculture have fallen short,
 and this ambitious program is not likely to
 be carried on in full.   Nonetheless, agri-
 cultural growth during the balance of the
 decade should show a marked improvement over
 the near stagnation of 1961 to 1965.
 D.      The average rate of growth of Soviet GNP
 during the Five-Year Plan period should-lie close
 to 5 percent.   The Soviets will continue-.to
 run their economy at full capacity, and to
 experience periodic shortages and delays.
 Commitments to various programs are already
 being cut.

 I.   The policies of the U.S.S.R. today are in an in-
 troverted phase, in the sense that Soviet thoughts
 these days are mostly about the internal scene
 and matters close to home.
 A.    The U.S.S.R. has not exactly withdrawn into
 a shell, but domestic concerns and the Chi-
 nese problem are its overriding considera-
 tions.
 B.    At home, many of the familiar economic prob-
 lems remain as far from solution as ever.
 They may, in fact, be multiplying under the
 impact of technological change with its
 attendant political and social effects.

 considering that the power which was tradition-
 ally wielded by a single individual now in effect
 lies with a committee which has to make up its
 operating rules as it goes along.
 A.   Those who made the coup against Khrushchev in
 October 1964 had one thing in common, other
 than political ambition:   dismay, even re-
 pugnance, at Khrushchev's radical swings in
 policy, and his unrealistic promises of
 achievement.
 B.   Otherwise, they made a curious blend of in-
 terest and authority.   In order to make a
 go of it, they needed the kind of undramatic
 mic:dle-of-the-road policies--unlikely to
 offend grievously--which have been their hall-
 mark.   They needed the evenness and the gyro-
 scopic stability of government-by-committee.
 C.   There now seems to be a fairly formal mechan-
 ism. at the Politburo level for decision-
 making, and a fairly rigid code of individual
 behavior to ensure collectivity.
 D.   Only two aging members, Shvernik and Mikoyan,
 have left the Politburo.   They were given
 honorable retirement--something of a novelty
 for the Soviet Union.

 II.   The present leadership,  from necessity and en-
 lightened self-interest, has accepted certain
 broad rules for its collective game.   So far,
 however, it is anything but certain that it has
 designed a piece of political machinery with
 any staying power.
 A.   There are necessarily controversial policies,
 such as economic reform, and these are bound
 to get mixed into the personal and political
 conflicts.
 B.   It is questionable, too, how much longer
 this present set-up will remain "collegial"
 in any meaningful sense.   There has been a
 steady enlargement of the position of Gen-
 eral Secretary Brezhnev,
 1. On a number of occasions, particularly
 at his 60th birthday in December, Brezhnev
 was given the kind of personal praise
 reminiscent of an earlier era.
 2. He now seems to have the most important
 voice--probably the final word--in the
 making of key assignments.

 is crucial to the functioning of the current
 leadership.

 1.   The relationship has stood up for more

 ment in a system of divided authority.
 2.   There is rather good evidence that the
 relationship is one of wary toleration,
 however.   The extensive overlap of party
 and government institutions and interests
 inevitably produces strain.
 D.   Other Politburo leaders have clearly suffered
 setbacks in the political struggle.
 1.   Shelepin had long been a favorite of
 Kremlin watchers, because of his ambition,
 his ties with the Committee of State Se-
 curity  (KGB), and his youth--he is still
 only 48.   He has now lost some of the
 broad responsibilities he had in the early
 post-Khrushchev period, including his role
 in security affairs.
 2.   Podgorny was kicked upstairs to the So-
 viet Presidency.   He has since managed
 in a small way to enlarge the role of the
 Supreme Soviet;  i't, serves as a sort of
 watch-dog over the government ministries,
 but without a full set of teeth.

 3.   There is a second rank--from whom the
 successors to Brezhnev and Kosygin will
 eventually come.   These men, with whom I
 would include Shelepin, hold important
 posts such as deputy premier, and some of
 them are relatively young  (Polyansky is
 49; Mazurov is 53).
 Despite the inherent difficulty of decision-
 making by consensus, the present leadership has
 had some successes in dealing with the problems
 of a complex and highly structured society in a
 complex and increasingly unstructured Communist
 world.
 A.   The 1966 harvest was the best in Soviet his-
 tory, partly because of some sensible changes
 in policy, but partly because of good weather.
 B.   In 1965, the leadership decided to test some
 aspects of a market economy in a few carefully
 selected industries.
 1.   These changes might well have been as help-
 ful as the changes in agriculture, but
 implementation has been slower than planned.
 2.   This was partly because even limited change
 involves immense technical problems in the
 Soviet Union.

 3.   It.was also, as the Kremlin admits, be-
 cause of bureaucratic inertia, if not
 downright obstruction.
 IV.    This is a cautious regime in Moscow,, and it is
 not prepared to venture beyond these small steps.
 It has not begun to face up to the larger prob-
 lems.
 A.   The basic question of how to allot economic
 resources among competing sectors is un-
 answered.   This is one reason why the current
 Five Year Plan has not yet received final
 approval although the Soviet Union is already
 heading into the second year of that plan.
 B.     There is a very uneasy coexistence between
 the regime and the intellectuals.   The re-
 gime is cracking down, as it did in the
 Sinyavsky-Daniel trial.  The intellectuals
 are constantly testing the regime's per-
 missiveness in literature and the arts.
 C.   In all things, the regime has tended to seek
 the middle way.   It has hesitated to crack
 down hard on the unruly elements in Soviet
 society, but the trend has been, nevertheless,
 toward a tightening of discipline.

 1.   The regime increased police powers and
 punishment, to deal with a growing inci-
 dence of crime and juvenile delinquency.
 2.   The problem of dealing with minority na-
 tionalities may have been made worse by
 reversion to a more centralized manage-
 ment of the national economy.
 3.   In education, steps to provide universal
 10-year schooling, and to increase the
 capacity of higher education institutions,
 are going to look like halfway measures to
 the youngsters.   The new generation looks
 on education--rather than the perfection
 of a Communist society--as the stepping

 I.   Soviet foreign policy is being made with China
 constantly in mind.   The Russians now feel that
 they have the upper hand in the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute.   They are beginning to behave somewhat more
 boldly.
 A.      Tensions between Moscow and Peking have intensi-
 fied markedly in recent months.   The impact of
 the Vietnamese conflict and the upheaval in-
 side China have helped to bring Sino-Soviet
 relations almost to rock bottom.
 1.         Moscow's aid to the Vietnamese Communists
 ..as earned it large dividends in the dis-
 pute with Peking.   This help has brought
 North Vietnamese expressions of gratitude,
 which the USSR has been able to use to
 good effect to undercut Chinese allegations
 of Russian double-dealing.
 2.    The Russians have also made the most of
 Peking's outright rejection of Moscow's
 appeals for "united action" in support
 of North Vietnam.

 eign Communist parties that the Chinese

 are more interested in fighting Moscow
 than in helping Hanoi.
 4.             Most of the world's Communists have also
 been persuaded of the truth of Soviet
 charges that Peking is out to split the
 movement.
 II.  Khrushchev's successors can congratulate them-
 selves on the results of their anti-Chinese
 tactics.     They have paid out the rope, and the
 Chinese have proceeded to hang themselves.
 A.     China's recent setbacks are due in large part
 to Peking's own rigidity and clumsiness.
 1.    Advancing age, the pressures of their
 struggles with the Soviets, and frustra-
 tions over domestic and foreign reverses
 have all combined to give Mao and the
 other "true believers" around him an
 arrogant certitude that is shutting Pe-
 king in behind a new Great Wall.
 2.    The Chinese present themselves as the
 fount of all valid revolutionary experi-
 ence.   They call neutrality in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute "impermissible."   By try-
 ing to force all Communists to choose
 sides, they have seriously damaged their

 relations with important parties which
 once leaned toward Peking.
 B.      Three years ago, Peking appeared to be well
 on the  way to building a bloc of Communist
 supporters that could meet Moscow on some-
 thing like even terms.   Now, although the
 Chinese still have a few backers, the pre-
 ponderance of influence is so clearly in
 Moscow's favor that a significant challenge
 to Soviet authority no longer exists.
 1.   Peking can count with assurance on sup-
 port only from Albania, the Communist
 Party of New Zealand, and a handful of
 tiny splinter groups.
 2.   The Chinese have suffered their most
 serious setbacks in the Far East.   The
 ruling parties of North Korea and North
 Vietnam have edged away from Peking,
 and the Japanese Communist Party can no
 longer be counted on for support.   Further-
 more, the Communist party of Indonesia--
 long one of China's supporters--was
 shattered in the wake of the unsuccessful
 coup attempt in the fall of 1965.

 3.   China's relations with Cuba have also
 sunk to an all-time low, and Peking is
 no longer able to work through pro-Castro
 activists in Latin America.
 C.    The so-called "cultural revolution" has
 helped immeasurably to discredit and isolate
 the Chinese.   Red Guard excesses have provided
 a real windfall for Moscow's propaganda mill.
 1.   Early last year the Soviets began a rather
 discreet campaign aimed at vilifying the
 Chinese leaders through sarcastic, tenden-
 tious reporting of events in China.
 2.   Pravda recounted,  for example, the ludi-
 crous episode of the Chinese who had been
 denounced for claiming that, if a man did
 not know how to climb a pole,.a reading
 of Mao's works would hardly help him do
 it.   This, reported Pravda, amounted to
 heresy in China, where it is official
 doctrine that "a study _ of -Chairman Mao's
 works gives immediate results."

 ward more direct and authoritative criti-
 cism of Peking.   Recently, top Soviet

 leaders have personally attacked Mao Tse-
 tung, claiming that his regime has for-
 feited the right to call itself Communist.
 4.   The Russians have gone so far as to align
 themselves openly with what they call the
 "growing opposition to Mao and his clique"
 inside China.
 D.   Moscow's decision last summer to switch back
 to open attack, after two years of ignoring
 Peking in public, stemmed primarily from a
 determination to capitalize on recent Chinese
 setbacks.
 L.      There is also, however, a significant:,
 element of genuine Russian concern over
 the excesses oft:the Red Guard upheaval,
 and what it may mean for the future.

 Brezhnev to drum-L.up wide international

 3.          The Soviet Union has persuaded many
 foreign Communist parties to join in
 the public condemnation of Peking's
 policies.
 ~:.          Now Moscow is pushing the idea of a
 world Communist conference to adopt a
 formal, authoritative denunciation.
 5.          Some foreign parties are still strongly
 opposed to such a move, however, and
 if the Kremlim leaders push too hard,
 they might jeopardize the more~.effec-
 tive inter-party working relationships
 they have cultivated since they threw
 Khrushchev out.
 E.   It is impossible to predict with any assur-
 ance when the final rupture between the
 USSR and China might take place, and under
 what circumstances.

 however, shows how far the deterioration

 assigned to the Russian UN mission, and a
 Soviet diplomat has stated in private
 that relations will have to improve con-
 siderably before Moscow will think about

 SOVIET RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES
 I.   To turn from the Sino-Soviet dispute to the Soviet
 relations with the United States--it is clear that
 the U.S.S.R. wants to keep some lines of communica-
 tion-with Washington open, despite the strains im-
 posed by Vietnam and some Kremlin sensitivity to
 Chinese charges of Soviet-American collusion.
 A.   The Kremlin leaders realize that if there is
 going to be any meaningful progress along the
 lines of their national interests in European
 security, arms control, and East-West trade,
 sooner or later thay are going to have to
 resume the dialogue with the United States.
 1.   Moscow puts the complete blame for the
 Vietnamese war on the United States.   This is
 a  necessary assumption for their policy
 lines, but it may also be a matter of con-
 viction.
 2.   In private, however, Soviet leaders have
 emphasized that they want to avoid any
 showdown between Moscow and Washington
 over the Vietnamese issue.  Whenever
 they have a chance to: make the point

 3.    Ambassaodr Kohler talked to President
 Podgorny and Deputy Premier Polyansky be-
 fore he left Moscow.   Both of them emphasized
 their interest in increased trade and scien-
 tific and technical exchanges.
 4.    The recent civil air and space agreements
 show that limited cooperation--not affecting
 Vietnam--is still possible.   There are also,
 of course, encouraging signs that a nuclear
 nonproliferation treaty may soon be signed.

 OTHER FOREIGN POLICY LINES
 I.  The U.S.S.R. is working hard to erase its old
 image in Western Europe.  The familiar Soviet
 policy of intimidation, threat, and ultimatum--
 to which we have become so accustomed--has been
 laid ,aside, or at least placed in reserve.
 A.      Moscow seems to feel that American pre-
 occupation with Southeast Asia provides a
 grace period in Europe for the building of
 Soviet diplomatic, economic, technological,
 and scientific contacts.
 B.      Moscow has made much ofits rapport with De
 Gaulle, hoping that other West Europeans--
 particularly members of NATO--will borrow a
 leaf or two from the French book.
 1.. But talk about a Franco-Soviet alliance
 is overwrought.  We doubt that even the
 French have many illusions, but we are
 reasonably sure that the Russians are
 not much interested in the French for
 their own sake.
 2? They do see a chance to use De Gaulle
 against both the US and Germany.

 C.   Concurrently, Moscow never ceases to play on
 distrust of the Germans. Soviet propaganda
 compares the professed reasonableness of the
 Soviet Union with their picture of West German
 and American "militarism and intransigence."
 D.   All this is contributing to the obvious
 growth of unease among Western Europeans who
 are eager to depart from old, cold-war for-
 mulas which they feel do not now serve their
 national interests as well as they used to.
 E.   The Soviets will probably remain wary of
 risking a serious confrontation--for instance,
 over Berlin--which might prove counterpro-
 ductive by reviving the obvious reasons for
 Western unity.
 II.    In the: less developed areas,  the Soviets now seem
 to be placing greater reliance on the tools of
 traditional diplomacy.  They are treating local
 revolutionaries with considerably more circumspec-
 tion.
 A.   Latin America is a good case in point. Through-
 out the Southern Hemisphere, the Soviet accent
 now is on improved state-to-state contacts,
 more trade, more cultural exchanges, and the
 like.

 1.      The Soviets have certainly not abandoned
 local Communist parties, nor stopped
 giving encouragement to assorted dissident
 forces. It is clear, however, that aid
 to such antigovernment elements is being
 given with increased caution, especially
 if these elements have only a questionable
 revolutionary potential.
 2.      This is a sore point between the Soviets
 and Castro.  The Cuban dictator has made
 plain his contempt for what he considers
 Moscow's half-hearted view of Latin American
 revolution.
 B.   In the Near East, the Soviets have been making
 a special effort to court a number of pro-Western
 states.

 December--the first by a Soviet premier in
 43 years--capped a series of friendly ex-
 changes between the two countries.   These
 are largely in the realm of atmospherics,
 but Moscow obviously hopes the future will
 bring something of substance.

 of 1965 was followed last August by a
 sale of limited military hardware.  There
 are signs now that  a   deal in oil and gas

 Syria, the Soviets probably have their
 hands full dealing with an unpredictable and

 matic, and occasionally requires a selling job.
 A.   The heads of all these states, except Albania
 and Yugoslavia, have met twice in the past
 year for a joint consideration of policy mat-
 ters.
 1.      When they met last July as the political
 consultative committee of the Warsaw Pact,
 three Soviet policies they endorsed were:
 (1) further aid to Vietnam, including
 volunteers if requested;  (2)  denial of
 nuclear weapons to West Germany; and  (3)
 convocation of a European security confer-
 ence.

 2. These same heads again demonstrated
 their togetherness when they met in Mos-
 cow in October, though no policy announce-
 ments were made at that time.
 III.   Not surprisingly, therefore, there have been no
 dramatic assertions of independence vis-a-vis the
 U.S.S.R. in the recent past, but neither has there
 been any back-tracking on the part of those East
 European states which have assumed divergent posi-
 tions.
 A.     Albania has staunchly maintained its alliance
 with China.   It shows no inclination to abandon
 Stalinism internally.
 B.     Tito kept alive the idea, if not the substance,
 of his nonalignment by holding a summit meet-
 ing with Nasir and Mrs. Gandhi last October.
 C.     And Rumania has again made clear that it op-
 poses any, new international Communist meeting.
 1.    In November, Rumania's party chief
 Ceausesco  (cho-sess-ku)  even compared notes
 on this subject with Tito, another staunch
 opponent.
 D.   :Poland is perhaps among the most interested in
 maintaining good relations with the United States.
 In January, 1966, Warsaw undertook peace soundings

 in Vietnam at Ambassador Harriman's request.
 In recent months Poland has been particularly
 reasonable in working out bilateral problems.
 IV.    There has been a proliferation of issues, moreover,
 on which the East European states do not agree
 among themselves.
 A.    The possibility that West Germany may seek
 to establish diplomatic relations with East
 European states,  for example, has been wel-
 comed by Rumania and Hungary, but has dis-
 turbed Poland and East Germany.
 B.    In recent months, Hungary has criticized
 Rumania over the interpretation,of an his-
 torical event, while Yugoslavia and Bulgaria
 have revived their traditional territorial
 dispute over Macedonia.
 C.    Even the UNITED NATIONS-meetings have be-
 come the scene of competition among the
 East European states for election to UN
 offices and for pre-eminence in UN commit-
 tees.

 V.   The regimes of Eastern Europe are all stable at
 present.
 A.      The peoples of most of these countries are
 generally resigned and apathetic, concerned
 primarily with bettering their own individual
 economic lot.
 1. For example, the authorities in Budapest
 were nervous last October about the 10th
 anniversary of the Hungarian revolution,
 but it passed without incident.
 B.      During the past year, the Communist parties
 of Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and
 Hungary all held congresses which demonstrated
 there is no serious challenge to the present
 leaders from within the ruling elites.
 VI.  There has, nevertheless, been a revival of faction-
 alism within most of the regimes of Eastern Europe.
 A.      The more moderate leaderships are trying to
 undertake economic reforms which involve a
 decentralization of economic decision-making.
 This has political overtones.
 1.   Party members are not certain how, precisely,
 they are to continue exercising control under
 the changed circumstances.

 2.   Conservatives in these regimes see a
 threat to the retention of their positions
 of authority, while liberals get frus-
 trated by conservative obstructionism.
 VII.    In Yugoslavia, the liberal-conservative split has
 presented Tito with his greatest crisis since
 Milovan Djilas was purged in the early 1950s for
 attacking the "new class."
 A.    The crisis was precipitated last summer when
 Tito deposed his heir-apparent, Aleksander
 Rankovic, the darling of the conservatives.
 1.   Rankovic had moved too far too fast in
 attempting to ensure his eventual succession,
 even to the point of bugging Tito's
 residence and office.
 2.   Rankovic was the leading Serb in the regime,
 so his purge also had overtones of being
 directed against the country's largest
 nationality group.
 B.    Tito has set out to make sure another Rankovic
 can't emerge.
 1.   The secret police, who were under the control
 of Rankovic, are having their authority
 curtailed and decentralized.

 2.   In October, Tito began a thorough re-
 organization of the party and a de-
 centralization of political power within
 it.
 3.   The government is also slated for a.;
 shake-up; regional authorities are to
 receive greater power.
 C.   These events have produced indiscipline and
 confusion within the regime.
 1.   Some-party leaders have gone so far as
 to call for an approved opposition within
 the Communist party.
 2.   And parliamentary bodies have become more
 aware of their political prerogatives.
 3.   Committees no longer rubber-stamp proposed
 laws.

 refused to pass a draft bill in October,
 the cabinet of the republic resigned.

 EAST EUROPEAN ECONOMY
 ?
 ?
 VIII.     The highly industrialized countries of Eastern Europe
 are not doing as well on the economic front as their
 neighbors who are less developed.
 A.   The less developed East Europeans have better
 prospects for growth because their non-agricul-
 tural work force is still growing.
 1.   Over the next five years,  for instance, the
 increase in non-farm jobs will range from
 nearly five percent in Rumania, down to per-
 hays one percent in Czechoslovakia and vir-
 tually zero in East Germany.
 B.      Foreign trade also affords brighter prospects
 for the countries which export raw materials,
 particularly foodstuffs and wood products.
 1.   They can still find growing markets in both
 East and West.
 2.   The industrialized countries have just about
 reached the limit in selling processed man-
 ufactures in the West, and are running into
 growing competition, and a preference for
 Free World products, when they try to sell
 their goods within the Bloc.

 C.   In the first half of this decade, East-West
 trade increased by about 50 percent, but the
 rate of growth is slowing down.   The East
 European countries remain interested in West-
 ern machinery, and particularly in Western
 know-how, but are finding it increasingly
 difficult to hold up their end of the trade
 balance.
 D.   Economic relations with the Soviet Union are
 under new strains, to some degree because the
 U.S.S.R. now seems to be reciprocating the
 new East European fashion of measuring deals
 by the yardstick of self-interest.
 1.   The new Soviet leadership concluded in
 1965 that trade with East Europe involved
 a substantial cost to the Soviet Union,
 which must not be increased,  and should
 be reduced if possible.
 2.   This decision is reflected in new trade
 agreements negotiated over the past 18
 months.
 3.   The Soviet Union has been sending raw
 material to the Czechs and East Germans,
 and to a lesser extent to Poland and

 Hungary, in exchange for machinery and
 finished goods. Now Moscow has deter-
 mined that it costs Russia more to produce
 the exported raw materials than it would
 to produce the additional machinery at
 home.
 4.    As a result, the East Europeans found
 when the new trade agreements were nego-
 tiated that Moscow was insisting on much
 better terms, and being more selective
 about the goods it wanted.
 E.      The Soviet Union, however, still accounts
 for 45 percent of total trade for the in-
 dustrialized countries of East Europe, and
 the Soviet Union remains a key element in
 their economic plans.

 CHINESE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
 ?
 9
 I.   Communist China is being racked by the greatest
 political convulsions since Mao Tse-tung took
 control in 1949.
 A.   Mao, aging, sick, and more and more inflexible,
 is concerned about where Communism is heading
 in China, and about who is going to succeed
 him.
 B.   Around Mao,  the men who aspire to take his
 place have the same concerns.
 C.   The result has been a naked struggle for power,
 accompanied by a drive to re-shape the Commu-
 nist Party, or to replace it with a younger
 version with the old revolutionary zeal.
 D.   That is what is behind the phenomenon of the
 so-called "cultural revolution" and the Red
 Guard today.
 II.    Any attempt to determine where this revolution
 stands today, or who is likely to come out on top,
 is like trying to pick a winner when a bunch of
 cats are fighting under a rug.

 A.    The cultural revolution has already turned
 on some of the leaders who ostensibly started
 it.   The Red Guard is split, and rival units
 battle each other or fight with workers in
 the streets.   There have even been some posters
 attacking Mao himself.
 (PHOTO CHART, COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP)
 B.      The prime mover at present is Defense Minister
 Lin Piao.     (Lin Byaw)
 1.   He was proclaimed second man in the leader-
 ship,  and Mao's chosen successor, when
 the cultural revolution began last summer.
 2.   Since that time he has been engaged in
 a drive to unseat any potential rivals.
 3.   His immediate targets are the two men
 who have been at the top of the party
 machinery, Chief of State Liu Shao-chi
 (Lyew Shao-chee), and the general secre-
 tary, Teng Hsiao-ping.   (Dung Shaw-ping)
 C.    For the past couple of months, Lin's drive
 appeared to be stalled.   There was some
 reason to believe that a group headed by
 Premier Chou En-lai  (Joe En-lye) does not
 want to see the party machinery completely
 s~aattered.

 1.                    The role of Mao Tse-tung (Mao Dzeh-dung)
 during this period was obscure.   It
 appeared that he was giving general sup-
 port to Lin Piao (Lin Byaw),  but was
 reluctant to condone extreme action
 against men as close to him as Liu  (Lyew)
 and Teng  (Tung).
 2.   Despite violent public and private
 criticism, Liu and Teng still showed
 up at major rallies.   In the new
 alignment of the hierarchy, Liu had
 dropped from second to eighth,  but
 still acted as chief of state.   Teng
 dropped a notch or two,  but still ran
 the party machinery.
 D.    Early in January,  the leadership struggle
 apparently entered a more critical phase.
 1.   Newspapers and Red Guard organizations
 have published authoritative reports of
 a bitter personal attack by Mao himself
 on Liu and Teng.
 2.   According to these reports,  Mao charged
 that the two men had been working ever
 since 1958 to push him aside and take
 over the country.

 .3.   This involvement of Mao's personal
 prestige could only be taken as the
 signal for a showdown.
 E. There was an almost immediate reaction from
 the party old-timers around Liu and Teng.
 Organized groups of workers in Nanking and
 elsewhere were reported fighting pitched
 loattles with the youngsters in the Red
 Guard.
 :L.     It remains difficult to determine from
 day to day which element of the hierarchy
 is backing which mass organization.
 It has been apparent in the past,
 however,  that the extremist faction
 of the Red Guard which is probably most
 responsive to Lin Piao is the one which
 has staged the most violent attacks on
 factory workers, on party headquarters,
 and on government ministries.
 .3.     If these street battles spread much
 farther,  the situation is going to
 border on civil war.
 III.   The final destruction or dismissal of Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping would be only a first step

 for Lin Piao. His goal all along has been to

 B.   Many of the party leaders owe their careers
 to Liu and Teng, who have dominated the
 party machinery for more than a decade.
 1.   If Liu and Teng go down in disgrace,
 Lin will be able to use their past
 associations to demote or dismiss large
 numbers of party officials in key posi-
 tions.
 C.   Nobody appears to be above the reach of the
 purge.
 1.   In January, Peking began recalling its
 diplomats.   At least 150,  from 13 major

 capitals, were called home, presumably
 for questioning and reindoctrination.
 2.   Tao Chu (Taow Joo)  last fall was promoted
 from lower levels of the leadership to
 the Number Four spot, and put in charge
 of the party propaganda department.   He
 was also named one of the directors of
 the cultural revolution.
 3.    Now Tao Chu is himself under attack.
 Mao's wife and the chairman of cultural
 revolution committee say that Tao Chu
 is a bourgeois reactionary who supports
 Liu and Teng.
 D.   There are rival Red Guard organizations which
 raid each other's headquarters.
 1.    There are counterfeit Red Guard organiza-
 tions organized by party leaders in the
 provinces trying to protect themselves
 from attack.

 China to let the students take part in
 the cultural revolution, and this makes

 Red Guard organizations. Some of them
 are more aptly called children than
 students.
 ,3.     Initially an effort was made--particularly
 by the more practical governmental leaders
 around Chou En-lai,  to keep the Red Guards
 from disrupting the harvest and the
 factories.   Now, however,  the Red Guards
 have a charter to go everywhere in the
 name of instilling new revolutionary
 fervor and destroying the foes of Mao.
 IV.   When and how will the turmoil in Peking finally
 be resolved?
 A.    We have no idea.   The opposing forces, judging
 by the protracted struggle, must be quite
 evenly matched.
 1.   Some days,  it looks as though they are
 digging in for a long winter of political
 trench warfare.
 2.   The next day, a war of movement and a
 showdown may appear imminent.
 :3.  I would say it is still too early to
 speculate usefully on the outcome.
 B.    There are two points, however, which we can
 make.

 1.                     First, as long as China's leaders are
 pre-occupied with this internal wrangling,
 they will find it difficult to reach
 agreement on any new policy lines.   So
 we do not expect any radical departures
 from existing policies.
 2.       Second, whoever wins, we can see no reason
 for suspecting that there will be any
 dilution of Peking's implacable hostility
 to the United States.   Chinese policy
 might become somewhat less aggressive if
 the winner turns out to be one of the
 more practical leaders--for instance,
 Chou En-lai.

 BRIEFING PACKAGE January 1967
 CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY
 I.   Chinese Communist foreign policy is designed to
 serve the ambitions of the Peking leaders to
 exterLd their military reach and political sway
 in Asia.
 A.   As Communists,  they want to spread Communism,
 but they are also Chinese.   Their sense of
 history invokes the ancient China known as
 the "Middle Kingdom," to which the surrounding
 lands paid tribute.
 B.   That was far in the past.   And with the
 current troubles besetting Peking,  the
 Chinese must realize that any significant
 movement toward a restoration of that hegemony
 is probably many years off in the future.
 C.   In the past year or so, Chinese fortunes in
 the outside world have sunk to a new low,
 Or, as Peking puts it:   there have been many
 "twists and turns."  For the time being,  the
 regime will have to seek   comfort in Mao's
 words--that the path to victory follows a
 twisting course.

 II.  The Chinese have suffered their most humiliating
 defeats in Africa, where their heavy-handed
 pressure tactics have alienated a number of
 important Afro-Asian leaders.
 A.   These leaders are increasingly aware that
 Peking could as easily support their opponents
 against them.   China's diplomats have been
 largely unsuccessful in assuring the
 continent's leaders that African nationalism
 is being supported for its own sake and not
 for ulterior Chinese motives.
 1.   Early last year the Central African
 Republic and Dahomey broke relations with
 Peking.
 2.   The successful coup in Ghana deprived
 the   Chinese  of another major base of
 operations.
 3.   In Kenya,  too,  there has been mounting
 pressure to throw the Chinese out.
 Several Chinese intelligence agents have
 already been expelled.
 B.    The Chinese have always viewed Africa as an
 area where over the long run they could score
 significant gains at the expense of the US,
 Vie USSR, and Nationalist China.

 1.   Their present policy, however, appears
 to be to keep new commitments to a
 minimum and fight what amount to holding
 actions.
 2.   At one briefing, Chinese press officials
 were told that Peking would have to be
 "realistic," and take current conditions
 into account.
 III.   Of all China's reverses abroad, probably the most
 serious has been the elimination of pro-Communist
 elements from positions of power in Indonesia.
 A.      The Indonesian Communist party, one of Peking's
 .staunchest and largest supporters in the
 world Communist movement,  has been so badly
 zurt that it will take years to recover.
 In the past,  Peking often used the Indonesian
 government as a front man in such international
 enterprises as the Afro-Asian movement.   Nov
 'they appear to have written off Sukarno, and
 must look elsewhere for someone to give a
 non-Communist camouflage to their maneuverings
 among the international front groups.
 IV.   There are a few areas where the Chinese may feel
 they have scored some measure of success in 1966.

 A.   the main Chinese victory was over the tiny
 Portuguese colony of Macao,  across the
 Canton estuary from Hong Kong.
 1.   Communists fanned a minor disturbance
 in Macao into serious rioting,  and Peking
 made this a pretext for threats which
 extracted a wide range of concessions
 from the new Portuguese governor.
 2.   They included,  for instance,  the surrender
 to the Communists of a number of Chinese
 Nationalist agents who had taken refuge
 in Macao.
 3.   With a sort of gun-boat diplomacy, Peking
 demonstrated that Macao exists only at
 China's pleasure.   This was supposed to
 repair Peking's image as the protector of
 Chinese living under foreign rule, and
 also serve as a warning to Hong Kong.
 B.   The Chinese also probably enter Pakistan on
 the plus side in their diplomatic ledger.
 1.    Peking has continued to supply aircraft,
 tanks,  and artillery to Pakistan.   China's
 willingness to provide MIG-19s.,   its most
 modern fighters,  shows the value Peking
 puts on its ties with Rawalpindi.

 2.    Actually,  the relationship is little more
 than a marriage of convenience, based on
 mutual hostility to India and on Pakistan's
 need for a new source of weapons after the
 fighting over Kashmir. The Chinese welcome
 anything that disturbs the Indians,V--,and
 adds strains to Pakistan's ties with the
 U.S.
 C.   Tanzania is another of the few places where
 China's position has improved over the past
 year.
 1.    President Nyerere has come to rely more
 and more on Peking for military assistance,
 and the Chinese have a large mission
 training the Tanzanian police force.
 2.    The Chinese are also talking about building
 a railroad from the Tanzanian coast into
 Zambia, which would be useful for bringing
 out copper.
 3.    The Chinese find Tanzania particularly
 valuable as their main point of contact
 with rebel forces operating in the
 southern half of the African continent.

 China will probably increase its support
 for subversive efforts against Mozambique
 and Rhodesia.
 V.   Vietnam remains at the center of Chinese foreign
 policy.       Public Chinese commentary on the war
 has dropped off sharply since last spring, but
 there has been no softening of Peking's opposition
 to a negotiated settlement.

 an authoritative newspaper editorial repeated
 Peking's familiar position that it   is
 necessary for the Vietnamese to keep fighting
 until all U.S. forces are driven out of
 Vietnam.
 1.     The Chinese Foreign Minister told the
 French Ambassador last November that U.S.
 troops would have to be pulled out of
 Vietnam before there could be any
 negotiations at all.   This is stiffer
 than Hanoi's position.
 Peking will almost certainly continue to
 denounce any proposals for a compromise
 settlement and any new U.S. pause in the
 bombings as a US "peace plot" aimed at

 C.   The Chinese continue to promise the North
 'Vietnamese all necessary support,  but their
 public pronouncements reveal an increasing
 degree of caution.
 1.   Peking has made no mention of "volunteers"
 for Vietnam since the fall of 1965,  except
 for a brief flurry of statements just
 after the U.S. bombing of POL storage
 facilities around Hanoi and Haiphong.
 :3.  The Chinese continue to emphasize that
 the Vietnamese must bear the primary
 responsibility for the fighting.
 :3.  Chinese comments about the "inevitability"
 of war with the United States have dropped
 off from the high level they reached in
 mid-1965;  they are now infrequent.
 VI.    The Chinese apparently believe that time, at
 least,  is on their side in Vietnam.   Peking's
 efforts are concentrated on keeping the Viet-
 namese Communist forces in the field,  in the
 expectation that the U.S. will eventually grow
 weary and pull out.

 sizeable military presence in the northern
 part of the country.
 B.    Peking is probably willing to increase its
 logistic support if necessary to keep the
 Vietnamese in the war.
 C.    But the Chinese obviously prefer to fight
 the war by proxy.   The crunch will come
 if the Hanoi leaders should decide to
 negotiate, and the only Chinese alternative
 is to use its own forces to keep North
 Vietnam at war.

 BRIEFING PACKAGE
 January 1967
 CHINESE ECONOMY
 1.   The Chinese economy has regained only a part of
 the ground lost as the result of the disasters
 of 1959-61,  and prospects to recover the momentum
 of the 1950's appear remote.
 A.   Nevertheless, the regime has made progress
 in some special areas, particularly in its
 program to develop advanced weapons.
 B.   The regime claims it is beginning the second
 year of the Third Five-Year Plan,  but we
 have had no indication that a genuine plan
 exists.
 1.   China's leaders are probably too preoccupied
 with political matters to devote themselves
 to thorough economic planning.
 2.   To be realistic,  such planning would have
 to acknowledge the collapse of the "Great
 Leap Forward."
 3.   Instead,  the regime has just issued highly
 exaggerated claims of economic accomplishments
 in 1966--especially for agriculture.

 4.   There are even indications that the
 economy may be pushed into a new try
 at a Great Leap Forward,  not because
 there is any better chance of success,
 but because Mao regards it as a means
 of re-igniting the revolutionary.,
 fanaticism he feels the Chinese are
 losing.
 C.    There has not been time for the political
 turmoil to show up in the economic statistics,
 but workers who are battling with Red Guards
 certainly cannot be maintaining production
 at the same time.
 II.   Stagnation in agriculture. is still the chief
 obstacle to a resumption of adequate economic
 growth, and prolongs the persistent threat to
 economic stability.   The regime has formally
 claimed a record harvest, but hasn't even
 bothered to hide the evidence to the contrary.
 (CHART, FOOD/POPULATION GROWTH IN CHINA)
 A.   For the fourth successive year, grain
 production has failed to increase.   Output
 in 1966 was actually somewhat lower than
 the preceding year, and below the level of

 :L0 years ago, when there were about 130
 million fewer people to be fed.
 B.   :Food rations during 1966 were cut in many
 areas because adverse weather reduced the
 :Local harvests   below average.  -Even
 in areas which were not affected, per capita
 consumption remained well below the levels
 of 1957 but still above the level of the
 "lean" year of 1960.
 I.   The rations could be kept above the
 "lean" year of 1960 because China
 imported more than 5 million tons of
 grain from the Free World in 1966.   The
 below-average harvest of 1966 will
 probably require substantially increased
 purchases in 1967.
 C.   The regime has made little progress in long-
 term solutions for the food-population problem.
 1..   The birth control program has not been
 pushed with enough vigor--particularly
 in rural areas--to have a sharp effect
 on population growth.
 2.    Nor has the regime shown any intention
 of coming up with any practical "big push"

 for agricultural production--for example,
 greatly increased use of chemical
 fertilizers, and seed stock that responds
 well to such fertilizer.
 III.    These major deficiencies in agriculture, which
 limit new investment, constitute the principal
 reason for believing that industrial growth also
 will be slow at best during the next several years.
 Other important obstacles to industrial expansion
 are the scarcity of trained manpower,  and the
 concentration of the best of China's limited
 industrial resources on advanced military programs.
 A.   Industrial production during 1966 was above
 1958, when the "leap forward" collapsed, but
 still well below the high level of 1960.
 1.   Following a sharp drop in 1961-62,  there
 has been some recovery in industrial
 production since 1962, with much of the
 increase resulting from greater use of
 existing plants.   This expansion slowed
 down in 1966,  largely because heavy
 industry has now reached a stage where
 additional production must come primarily
 from new or expanded facilities.

 B.      Top priority has been given to developing
 modern weapons.   However, a few select
 non-military industries have been favored.
 1.   China has become almost self-sufficient
 in petroleum products,  including jet
 fuel, at the present low level of
 consumption.   Some imports of some high
 quality lubricants and additives continue,
 however.
 2.   Output of chemical fertilizer has doubled
 compared to 1960, to an estimated 5 million
 tons.   Availability of chemical fertilizer,
 including imports, is still less than
 one-fourth of China's needs,  estimated
 conservatively.
 C.   Production of light industrial products continues
 to be restricted by shortages of agricultural
 raw materials.   Average cloth rations in 1966
 are believed to have increased slightly,  to
 three or four meters per person.

 IV.  Since 1960,  the regime has pointed with pride to
 its policy of "self-reliance" and its freedom
 from dependency upon the Soviet Union; nevertheless,

 foreign trade--in particular, trade with the
 Free World--is playing an increasingly important
 role in China's economy.
 A.   Total trade in 1966 probably reached $4.1
 billion, almost equalling the peak year of
 1959.   However,  the character of China's
 trade has undergone a major reorientation
 since 1959.
 1.   In 1959 almost 70 percent of trade had
 been with the Communist Bloc countries.
 In 1966, more than 70 percent of trade
 was with the Free World.
 Trade with the Soviet Union, which reached
 a level of almost $2 billion in 1959,
 fell to about $400 million in 1966.   Japan
 replaced the U.S.S.R. as China's chief
 trading partner.
 B.    This sharp shift in the direction of trade
 has taken place largely because of the need
 to import grain, which could be obtained
 only in the Free World,  and because of the
 Sino-Soviet dispute, which moved China to
 reduce its economic and technological
 dependence on Russia.

 C.   China's deliberate turn to Japan and Western
 Europe as its principal source of foreign
 technology takes the form of imports of
 complete plants, imports of small but
 highly important commodities--for example,
 precision instruments and machine tools--
 and an increasing exchange of trade missions
 and industrial exhibitions.
 V.      Economic problems at home have not prevented
 China from continuing its program of economic
 and military aid to selected foreign countries.
 Until 1963, most of Peking's aid commitments
 to Free World countries were in Asia.   Since
 then,  Peking has also directed its attention
 toward Africa and the Middle East.
 A.   The Chinese have emphasized their support
 for revolutionaries in the less developed
 countries, but direct military aid has not
 been large.
 I.   The chief recipients of arms aid have
 been Algeria, Cambodia,  Indonesia, and
 Pakistan.
 2.   Since the fall of 1965, Peking has become
 the principal supplier of military aid
 to Pakistan.
