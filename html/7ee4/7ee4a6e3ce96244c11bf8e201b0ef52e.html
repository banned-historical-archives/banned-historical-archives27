 SCOPE NOTE
 Both China and Taiwan will soon face the problem of political
 succession. But unlike China, where orderly succession to Deng Xiao-
 ping seems to have been largely established, Taiwan faces greater
 uncertainties at the moment in determining who will succeed Chiang
 Ching-kuo. This Estimate explains why the transition in Taiwan is likely
 to be difficult, what some of the possible outcomes are, and how US in-
 terests are likely to be affected should political succession occur some
 time within the next few years.

 KEY JUDGMENTS
 Taiwan President Chiang Ching-kuo, 80, is unlikely to serve out his
 term of office, which extends until 1990. His departure will bring to an
 end the Chiang dynasty, which has ruled the Chinese Nationalist
 movement since 1927 and Taiwan since the Chinese civil war of the late
 1940s. Despite existing constitutional provisions and whatever general
 succession plans Chiang may have made, we are concerned that the
 succession to him could be difficult because:
 - Present constitutional succession procedures on Taiwan-by
 which native Taiwanese Li Teng-hui would succeed Chiang-
 do not accord with power realities; Li does not have the support
 among the mainlander inner circle necessary to effectively
 wield power.
 - Chiang has not groomed a specific successor and has declared
 that he will not be succeeded by a member of his family.
 - Certain key senior leaders, who almost certainly were to have
 played a prominent role in the transition, have become inca-
 pacitated or disgraced during the past two years.
 - Members of the inner circle, fragmented by personal rivalries
 and policy differences, are likely to engage in a power struggle
 when Chiang is gone or can no longer effectively balance them.
 We are particularly concerned that during the succession period,
 certain serious challenges could arise that might further complicate the
 situation on Taiwan. These potentially include:
 - Greater economic difficulties. Taiwan has enjoyed rapid eco-
 nomic growth, but external trade problems and internal
 structural maladies could combine to create serious problems.
 - Difficulties in managing the relationship with the United
 States. Relations with the United States are crucial for Taiwan,
 but Chiang's successors may experience problems with the
 United States over arms sales and Taiwan's $10 billion trade
 surplus.
 - Increased inducements or pressure from China for negotia-
 tions to reunify Taiwan with the mainland. China's approach
 to Taiwan will be influenced by both the forthcoming succes-
 sion in China to Deng Xiaoping and China's perceptions of the
 political situation on Taiwan. Shifts in China's approach will
 affect Taiwan's internal political situation, most likely making
 leadership consensus more difficult to achieve.

 - Imbalances and tensions in Mainlander-Taiwanese relation-
 ships. Native Taiwanese now comprise 85 percent of Taiwan's
 nearly 20 million people, about 70 percent of the ruling
 Kuomintang (KMT - Nationalist Party) membership, and 46
 percent of the prestigious KMT Central Standing Committee
 (CSC). But actual power is still exercised by mainlanders, and
 potential successors disagree about the pace and extent of
 Taiwanese participation
 Responses to these challenges and the succession issue will be
 heavily determined by the leaders Chiang has drawn into the upper
 echelons of the KMT. These leaders derive power from their access to
 the President, and some have developed extensive personal loyalty
 networks within the party, government, and security services

 Our judgment is that initially there will be no clear-cut successor-
 a situation that might obtain for a few months or, more likely, for an ex-
 tended period-but that a loose coalition representing the influence of
 most or all of those individuals we have noted, and perhaps a few
 others, will be established. This collective leadership would seek to
 perpetuate Chiang Ching-kuo's legacy. If Chiang were to step down
 before his term expires and allow Li to become President, it could give
 Li certain powers and advantages and might also smooth the transition.
 However, as the transition unfolds, Li Teng-hui would probably be a tit-
 ular leader of the government but would not effectively wield power
 since senior mainlanders in the KMT would actually run things.' While
 such an arrangement might work out for a while, we believe that the
 stresses and challenges of governing, together with personal rivalries and
 political infighting among would-be contenders for Chiang's mantle,
 will probably result in policy drift and in failure to deal effectively with
 such important issues as power sharing with the native Taiwanese and
 economic reform.
 Consequently, over time, there will be a tendency for a new
 individual to arise who will attempt to assume Chiang's strongman role.
 No one would likely be able to attain Chiang's status quickly and would
 have to take into account various views in determining policy. Never-
 theless, we believe that the rise of certain individuals could have policy
 implications. The rise of any particular individual is highly contingent
 upon the factors and potential challenges we have presented; evidence
 is lacking on which is most like'
 ' The Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, feels that, as the
 hand-picked and constitutional successor, Li Teng-hui could well play a more effective role as leader of
 the transition team than suggested by this Estimate. To the extent that he does, the severity of potential
 problems identified here will be diminished.

 During the short and medium term we believe that native
 Taiwanese are not likely to assume positions of actual power. Over the
 longer term, extending beyond the period of this Estimate, Taiwanese
 will probably gain a more significant role. The "Taiwanization" of the
 ruling KMT, a process now under way, could continue and perhaps be
 strengthened depending on who the successors are. If Taiwanization is
 not continued or if there is an effort to "turn back the clock" on
 Taiwanization by some senior mainlanders, it would greatly increase
 societal tension, possibly leading to conflict between mainlanders and
 Taiwanese. If Taiwanization is continued, we can visualize in the
 distant future that there could actually be a role reversal, with
 mainlanders holding figurehead positions, but native Taiwanese actual-
 ly exercising power.
 We believe that the Taiwanization process will not be accompa-
 nied by significant steps toward democratization or ending one-party
 rule. We rule out the likelihood that opposition groups will play a
 significant role in the succession, and believe there will be no strong,
 broad-based support for greater democracy among Taiwanese in the
 KMT, or on the island, during the period of this Estimate.
 Taiwan's succession could be influenced by external factors.
 China's response will be of particular importance. We believe that
 China's leaders will continue to offer positive inducements for negotiat-
 ing reunification, a situation that eases the perceived threat to Taiwan,
 but at the same time is likely to be a source of political controversy
 among Taiwan's leaders on how to respond. A more threatening stance
 by China, however, would cause the sublimation of political differences
 on Taiwan. We believe the Soviet Union will not be a player in the tran-
 sition. While Japan has important economic interests in Taiwan, we
 believe Japan is not likely to be of great influence in the political
 succession.
 Taiwan's most crucial relationship is with the United States, and
 any new leader will want assurances of US support. Thus, US decisions,
 especially those concerning the sale of arms and weapons technology,
 6

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/07: CIA-RDP90TO01 55RO01 200050001-5
 will have an influence on succession politics. Beyond this, decisions by
 the United States on economic relations, unofficial visits, and other
 cooperative ties will also have an impact. Consequently, US actions,
 however well intended, could cause greater infighting among the
 leadership over how to and who can best manage the US connection.
 But at the same time, the United States will be placed in the
 dilemma of trying not to jeopardize its ties to Beijing while also trying to
 support Taiwan during the crucial political transition:
 - At the time of succession on Taiwan, the United States could
 face increased pressure from Beijing to cease arms sales to
 Taiwan. Beijing might also increase pressure on the United
 States to push Taipei into an accommodation with Beijing.
 - If those leaders in Taiwan who favor more "official" status in
 relations with the United States come to power and try to
 subvert our existing agreements with Beijing on the "nonoffi-
 cial" nature of our relations with Taiwan, Beijing might increase
 its protests and step up pressures on the United States to resolve
 the "Taiwan problem."
 Also, it will complicate the United States' efforts to express support
 for Taiwan during the succession period if the successors do not move
 forward on such issues as democracy, free trade, and human rights.
 We lack strong evidence on how particular succession scenarios
 might affect US interests, but we generally believe that:
 - The initial succession period will most likely provide some
 challenges to the United States since there is a good chance that
 the predictability of Taiwan's policies will decrease and the
 leadership's capability to function effectively will come into
 question. If factional infighting and policy drift come about, US
 concerns on trade and other elements of the relationship will
 probably not be dealt with effectively.

 Despite the problems and uncertainties surrounding the succession,
 we do not anticipate a major political upheaval in Taiwan over the next
 five years. We also believe it unlikely that Taiwan will declare its
 independence or renounce its status as the "Republic of China" during
 the period of this Estimate, though mainlanders and Taiwanese favor-
 ably disposed toward a greater Taiwanese participation in policy
 matters could increase their political strength. Greater factional infight-
 ing on Taiwan in the succession period, however, may well test the
 ability of the United States to help maintain Taiwan's viability while at
 the same time continuing to improve relations with China.

 DISCUSSION
 Introduction: Background to the Succession
 Problem
 1. In recent months it has become increasingly
 apparent that Taiwan President Chiang Ching-kuo,
 80, will probably not serve out his term of office,
 which extends until 1990. His departure will bring to
 an end the Chiang dynasty, which has ruled the
 Chinese Kuomintang (KMT-Nationalist Party) since
 1927 and Taiwan since the Chinese civil war of the
 late 1940s.
 2. Since Chiang's assumption of the presidency in
 1978, he has continued many of the policies of his
 father, Chiang K'ai-shek, which enabled Taiwan to
 enjoy economic prosperity and political stability.
 Chiang has put his own stamp on policy, however, by
 moving more forcefully to allow native Taiwanese
 participation in party and government affairs. Chiang
 has been successful in:
 - Promoting gradual "Taiwanization" of key insti-
 tutions-including the KMT, government bu-
 reaucracy, and the military officer corps-to
 give Taiwanese a greater stake in and sense of
 identity with the KMT. Taiwanese, who com-
 prise about 85 percent of Taiwan's nearly 20
 million people, now make up over 70 percent of
 the rank and file of the KMT, 46 percent of the
 prestigious KMT Central Standing Committee,
 and almost half of the Cabinet.
 - Implementing limited reforms to allow the Tai-
 wanese electorate to choose most of its represen-
 tatives, at least at the local level, and to permit
 the opposition (dangwai) to organize and to run
 candidates against the KMT in both local and
 national legislative elections.
 - Fostering strong economic growth that has bene-
 fited the largely Taiwanese business and middle
 classes. Economic prosperity has helped mute
 communal antagonism, dissolved social barri-
 ers-particularly between the younger genera-
 tion of mainlanders and Taiwanese-and divert-
 ed Taiwanese energies from politics into business,
 the professions, and education.
 - Maintaining Taiwan's political independence in
 spite of erosions to its international diplomatic
 claim as the legitimate government of China, the
 "Republic of China."
 3. Taiwan's progress in the past decade owes much
 to Chiang's ability to balance divergent loyalty net-
 works within the KMT and to maintain some flexibili-
 ty in policy. With his death or departure, we believe
 that the succession could be difficult and usher in a
 period of political and social instability.
 4. One major reason the succession could be diffi-
 cult is that the constitutional mechanisms for succes-
 sion do not accord with the realities of power. Chiang
 has placed a native Taiwanese, Li Teng-hui, in posi-
 tion to constitutionally succeed him as leader of
 Taiwan, but not the KMT. In March 1986, Chiang also
 promoted Li to become third-ranking member of the
 prestigious KMT Central Standing Committee. As
 Vice President, Li represents a possible candidate to
 succeed Chiang Ching-kuo as President. But Li has no

 Native Taiwanese-the majority of the population on
 Taiwan-trace their family histories back to the 17th-
 19th century migrations from southern Fujian Province.
 Others claim membership in the large Hakka communi-
 ty-centered in the northwest and southwest sections of
 the island-which came to Taiwan from Guangdong.
 Mainlanders-about 15 percent of the total popula-
 tion-include those who fled to Taiwan during the
 Nationalist retreat of 1948-50 and their offspring.
 After a period of initial euphoria when Taiwan
 returned to mainland control at the end of World War
 II, mainlander-Taiwanese relations rapidly soured as
 the Nationalist Army liquidated the indigenous elite
 and drained Taiwan's coffers to support the Nationalist
 war effort on the mainland. The crowning blow came
 on 28 February 1947-known as Erer Ba to native
 Taiwanese-after mainlander troops killed an elderly
 Taiwanese woman. In the ensuing riots, over 10,000
 Taiwanese lost their lives, setting the foundation for
 over 30 years of mainlander-Taiwanese animosity.
 after his death and public confidence in the govern-
 ment. But we believe Li would be at best a titular
 successor only, with little, if any, of Chiang's power
 and prestige. This is because the senior mainlanders,
 who dominate the inner councils of power, are very
 unlikely to accept Li's leadership
 5. Another reason is that, unlike his succession to his
 father, Chiang has decreed that no member of his
 family will succeed him. Furthermore, members of his
 The End of the Chiang Dynasty
 Chiang Ching-kuo's death will signal the end of the
 Chiang Dynasty's rule on Taiwan. Groomed to succeed
 his father over a 30-year period, Chiang has not
 repeated the process with any of his immediate family
 members. None of Chiang's three legitimate sons-
 whose half-Russian parentage effectively disqualifies
 them as successors in the eyes of many racially con-
 scious Chinese-are expected to figure prominently in
 any succession government. Indeed, Chiang has stressed
 publicly that no member of his family will succeed him.
 Since the mid-1960s as economic conditions im-
 proved dramatically and as the KMT began to allow
 more and more Taiwanese-including some opposition-
 ists-to campaign for national and local level legislative
 offices, friction between the two groups has decreased.
 Indeed, economic achievements have served as a cush-
 ion against political discontent by providing the grow-
 ing Taiwanese middle class with one of the highest
 standards of living in East Asia. Distinctions between
 mainlanders and Taiwanese have also diminished over
 the years due to growing rates of intermarriage, a rare
 event 20 years ago. Additionally, most younger main-
 landers-many of them born on Taiwan-speak the
 local Taiwanese (taiyu) dialect. Nonetheless, the lack of
 full participation in the political decisionmaking process
 has left some Taiwanese bitter and hostile toward the

 will likely be a crucial factor in the success or failure of

 constituency of his own and would be dependent on
 mainlanders who control key institutions-the party,
 the military, and security services. A scenario could
 develop whereby Chiang steps down before his term
 of office expires in order to promote Li as President.
 This would allow Chiang to use his political power to
 ward off opposition from the KMT old guard as well
 as to perpetuate the "Taiwanization" of the KMT. By
 backing Li, Chiang could devote his final energies
 toward establishing a collegium of individuals, thus
 further seeking to promote a smooth transfer of power
 Some press attention has been focused on Chiang's
 illegitimate sons. Chang Hsiao-yen (John Chang) cur-
 rently serves as Director of the North American Affairs
 Department of the Foreign Ministry and reportedly is
 close to his father. Many local pundits believe that he
 will have an influential role in a future government,
 though he is not well positioned to actually become his
 father's successor. Chang's twin brother, Chang Hsiao-
 tzu, is head of the Law Department at Soochow
 University.

 toward high political office
 7. As a result of these and other personnel shifts,
 and since Chiang has not groomed a successor, no
 single identifiable individual has emerged who can
 balance personal loyalty networks and groups as has
 Chiang Ching-kuo. Without his presence, members of
 the inner circle, fragmented by personal rivalries and
 policy differences, may become mired in a power
 struggle, which could lead to indecision and policy
 drift.
 Challenges Facing Potential Successors
 8. We are particularly concerned that during the
 succession period, certain serious challenges could
 arise that might further complicate the situation on
 Taiwan. These potentially include:
 - Greater  economic  difficulties.  Taiwan  has
 achieved rapid economic growth over the past
 decade. But problems such as a huge foreign
 surplus (almost $30 billion-nearly equal to that
 of Japan and rapidly growing), falling private
 investment, rising unemployment, and other
 structural impediments could become serious.
 Business confidence has been further under-
 mined by lack of a credible successor to Chiang.
 -Difficulties in managing the relationship with
 the United States. Relations with the United
 States are crucial for Taiwan. Taiwan's leaders
 will have to cope with the US pledge to continue
 reducing the dollar value (adjusted for inflation)
 and quality of arms it provides Taiwan under the
 August 1982 Communique with China. Leaders
 on Taiwan seek to circumvent that agreement.
 Additionally, there is pressure from the United
 States on Taiwan to reduce the $10 billion trade
 surplus and to stop counterfeiting goods. These
 pressures could prove disruptive.
 - Increased inducements or pressure from China
 for negotiations to reunify Taiwan with the
 mainland. Should China's present low-key ap-
 proach to Taiwan shift because of China's own
 leadership transition or because of China's
 leader's perceptions of the changing situation in
 Taiwan, the result could be troublesome. China's
 blandishments could make leadership consensus
 in Taiwan more difficult to achieve while greater
 pressure would exacerbate the island's perception
 of threat.
 Imbalances and tensions in Mainlander-Tai-
 wanese relationships. While Chiang has expand-
 ed the Taiwanese role within the KMT and
 government, many mainlanders are reluctant to
 take further steps to share power. Tensions be-
 tween mainlanders and Taiwanese could be fur-
 ther exacerbated by the unwillingness of main-
 landers to let Li Teng-hui actually rule. The
 problem for mainlanders of how to democratize
 without jeopardizing their privileged position
 remains essentially unresolved.
 Individuals Who Will Figure Pominently in the
 Succession
 9. The succession to Chiang and the approach taken
 to the resolution of Taiwan's many challenges will be
 determined by key individuals who President Chiang
 has brought into the inner circle. These leaders derive
 power from their access to the President, and some
 have developed extensive personal loyalty networks
 within the party, government, and security services.
 These influential figures include prominent mainland-
 er civilians, representatives of the military and securi-
 ty services, and some native Taiwanese

 Taiwan's sharp decline in economic growth from 10.5
 percent in 1984 to 4.6 percent in 1985 probably
 foreshadows several years of slower growth. Although
 strong by international standards, growth of 4 to 5
 percent is below Taiwan norms and is likely to shake
 consumer confidence and dampen domestic investment
 needed to reshape the economy. The export sector,
 which has accounted for half of Taiwan's GNP over the
 past five years, faces both growing protectionism in
 developed countries and stiffer competition from devel-
 oping nations. The decline in 1985 led to a sharp drop
 in domestic investment, increasing business failures, and
 growing unemployment-as much as 20 percent in
 some areas. In the near term, how quickly the economy
 recovers will depend in large part on a resurgence in
 demand for Taiwan's exports, particularly in the United
 States, its largest market. Over the long run, Taiwan
 must diversify markets. Taiwan could remain competi-
 tive in exports if government-initiated reforms were
 implemented, but Taipei has been reluctant to take
 firm action to open its economy and boost its more
 technologically advanced industries.
 Taipei has taken some halting steps to liberalize its
 economy and thus encourage investment and more
 trade. Restrictions on foreign investment, information
 exchange, and financial transactions have been eased.
 These changes should benefit the domestic economy
 greatly, especially in the long run. However, there are
 both positive and negative effects of Taiwan's trade
 related measures. For example, in response to US
 demands, Taipei has selectively reduced tariffs; but if
 Taiwan reduced tariffs on all or most imports, Japan-
 Taiwan's largest supplier-would be the main benefi-
 ciary, not the United States. Devaluating the New
 Taiwan dollar, moreover, would boost exports but
 would also increase the costs of imports, widening the
 Taiwan-US trade gap.
 Energy supplies and market access may be the two
 largest issues facing Taiwan in the future. Taipei, once
 eager to find new sources of energy, has done little to
 reduce its dependence on foreign oil and coal, which
 total about 90 percent of energy supplies. As long as
 prices are depressed, Taiwan can continue to rely on
 energy imports. At the same time, increasingly restrict-
 ed access to foreign markets gives Taiwan fewer cus-
 tomers for its products and will continue to dampen
 growth rates. But if prices on energy and other raw
 materials rebound, Taiwan will be ill prepared to stave
 off market inflation and a major economic slowdown.
 Taiwan benefits from unofficial trade with China.
 Annual indirect trade now totals about $1.6 billion,
 three-fourths of which are exports from Taiwan. It
 could continue to grow at an average rate of 15 to 20
 percent a year for quite some time. Thus, Taiwan's
 indirect exports to China may total $3 billion annually
 by 1990. Were Taipei to change its current policy and
 permit completely open trade with China, Taiwan
 might export as much as $6-10 billion by 1990 and boost
 its annual economic growth rate by 2 or 3 percentage
 points.

 which individuals he encourages or allows to remain
 close to the levers of power, and how much power he
 actually gives them. When he is gone, potential succes-
 sors will be hard pressed to achieve the "Mandate of
 Heaven" and establish authority and legitimacy in the
 transition period. There are several potential succes-
 sion outcomes, which will have implications for US
 interests.
 14. We judge that initially there will be no clear-cut
 successor-a situation that might obtain for a few
 months or, more likely, an extended period-but that
 a loose coalition representing the influence of most or
 all of the individuals we have noted above, and
 perhaps a few others, will be established. This collec-
 tive leadership would seek to perpetuate Chiang
 Ching-kuo's legacy. Li Teng-hui would probably be
 titular leader but would not effectively wield power
 since senior mainlanders would actually run things.3
 While such an arrangement might work out for a
 while, we believe that the stresses and challenges
 of governing, together with personal rivalries and
 political infighting among would-be contenders for
 Chiang's mantle, will probably eventually result in
 policy drift and in failure to deal effectively with such
 important issues as power sharing with the native
 Taiwanese and economic reform.
 15. Consequently, over time, there will be a ten-
 dency for a new single individual to arise who will
 attempt to assume Chiang's strongman role. No one
 would probably be able to attain Chiang's status
 quickly and would have to take into account various
 views in determining policy. Nevertheless, we believe
 that the rise of certain individuals could have policy
 implications. The rise of any particular person is
 highly contingent upon the factors and potential chal-
 lenges we have presented, evidence is lacking on
 which is most likely

 16. During the short and medium term we believe
 that native Taiwanese are not likely to assume posi-
 tions of actual power. Over the longer term, extending
 beyond the period of this Estimate, Taiwanese will
 most likely gain a more significant role. Any effort to
 discontinue or "turn back the clock" on Taiwanization
 we believe would greatly increase societal tension,
 possibly leading to conflict between mainlanders and
 Taiwanese. We can visualize in the distant future that
 there could actually be a role reversal, with mainland-
 ers holding figurehead positions but native Taiwanese
 actually exercising power.
 17. We believe that the Taiwanization process will
 not be accompanied by significant steps toward de-
 mocratization or ending one-party rule. While the
 KMT may make additional overtures to the opposition
 dangwai, we rule out the likelihood that opposition
 groups will play a significant role in the succession,
 and believe there will be no strong, broad-based
 support for greater democracy among Taiwanese in
 the KMT, or on the island, during the period of this
 Estimate.
 18. Taiwan's succession could be influenced by
 several external factors. Of particular importance will
 be China's response. We believe that China's leaders
 The opposition, or dangwai trace their beginnings
 back to the 1950s, but assumed their present form
 during the early 1970s when the government allowed
 dangwai candidates to run for national legislative office
 for the first time.
 At present, there are three recognizable dangwai
 factions. The Kaohsiung Incident faction (named for the
 demonstration that took place in December 1979 that
 escalated into a riot and resulted in the arrest and
 imprisonment of 39 people) led by the relatives and
 lawyers of leading Kaohsiung Incident prisoners have
 been the dominant group since 1983. Militant and
 inclined toward confrontational tactics, they are also the
 most outspoken in favoring self-determination for Tai-
 wan. Their voter appeal-based on a sympathy vote for
 their jailed relatives-has begun to decline as the
 memory of the Kaohsiung Incident begins to fade.
 The fastest growing group within the dangwai is the
 New Generation faction. A strong proponent of moving
 step by step toward forming a formal political party, it
 has its origins in opposition magazines and some Taiwan
 universities. The New Generation faction has a strong
 appeal among younger voters and can even count some
 younger mainland politicians among its adherents.
 The most moderate of the factions is led by veteran
 politician K'ang Ning-hsiang-long an advocate of
 working within the system and even cooperating with
 the KMT, particularly with younger KMT mavericks in
 the Legislative Yuan. K'ang and his followers generally
 appeal to the mainstream voter in Taiwan who is
 looking for an alternative to the KMT.
 The dangwai leaders are opposed to continued KMT
 and mainlander dominance and have used their re-
 stricted political freedom to push for:
 - An end to martial law.
 - The right to form legal political parties.
 - Freedom of assembly and the right to demon-
 strate.
 - Direct elections for key offices.

 inducements for negotiating reunification, a situation
 that eases the perceived threat to Taiwan, but at the
 same time is likely to be a source of political contro-

 more threatening stance by China could, paradoxical-

 Implications for the United States
 19. A significant test for the United States will be
 how to deal with the new leadership. Regardless of
 who comes to power, any new leader will want
 assurances of US support and will regard strong sub-
 stantive ties to the United States as vital to Taiwan's
 security, its economic well-being, and-by extension-
 its political stability. As Beijing continues to chip away
 at Taipei's ties to other countries, the new leaders are
 likely to see Taiwan as even more dependent on the
 United States. But support may prove difficult for the
 United States in the case of successors who favor
 policies that are not parallel with US objectives.
 20. A particularly sensitive issue will be the military
 relationship, and specifically, decisions made by the
 United States on the supply of arms. Any government
 in Taipei will view the supply of weapons as both a
 symbol of Washington's continued commitment to
 Taiwan's security and as a key deterrent to Chinese
 military intervention or intimidation. Taipei has not
 been very successful in diversifying its sources of
 supply since the United States normalized relations
 with China in 1979. Nor will Taiwan have the techni-
 cal know-how or funds necessary to make its defense
 industries self-sufficient in the foreseeable future.
 Even the new weapon systems its industries have
 produced over the past few years have required
 foreign-mainly US-technology and components.
 Therefore, Taiwan will remain heavily dependent on
 the United States for advanced military technology for
 the foreseeable future. As the implementation of the
 August 1982 Sino-US Communique on US military
 sales to Taiwan gradually reduces US arms for Taiwan
 21. But at the same time, Beijing is likely to put
 increasing pressure on the United States to abide by
 China's interpretation of the provisions of the August
 1982 agreement and cease arms sales altogether. Chi-
 nese leaders continue to publicly insist that Taiwan is a
 key irritant in the Sino-US relationship and that arms
 sales are the test issue. Hu Yaobang has been particu-
 larly strident on the Taiwan question, and if he
 succeeds Deng, as we anticipate, then the United
 States may face greater difficulty with China over the
 fication.
 22. The United States could also face increased
 concern over the "officiality" question. Some Taiwan
 leaders are trying to restore greater officiality in the
 status of relations between Taiwan and the United
 States. This would undermine Washington's agree-
 ments with Beijing specifying that our contacts with
 23. The United States would like any new govern-
 ment in Taiwan to be more responsive to the aspira-
 tions of the Taiwanese majority, more tolerant of the
 political opposition (dangwai), and in general more
 sensitive to human rights questions. Such a govern-
 ment would be most likely to achieve political stability
 at home and promote political tranquility in the
 region. However, we are concerned that political
 trauma during the succession could limit or perhaps
 even retard progress in Taiwanese participation and
 human rights questions, and we are not optimistic that
 the successor regime will make significant nroaress in
 these areas over the next few years.
 24. Another significant interest for the United
 States is the reduction of Taiwan's massive $10 billion
 trade surplus with the United States. The United States
 will also continue to push Taiwan to take strong
 measures against counterfeiting Western goods. Tai-
 wan's economy will remain highly dependent on
 exports to the United States, and during the succession
 period, Taiwan's leaders, already divided by other
 troublesome policy questions, will most likely not
 move decisively to address key trade issues. Only a
 strong, stable government is likely to be responsive to
 US concerns on these problems, a situation that,
 unfortunately, we think is not in the cards, at least in
 the short term.
 25. We lack strong evidence on how particular
 succession scenarios might affect US interests, but we
 generally believe that:
 - The initial succession period will pose difficulties
 and challenges to the United States since there is
 a good chance that the predictability of Taiwan's

 tional infighting and policy drift come about,
 there is a greater danger some leaders on Taiwan
 might adopt policies, such as insisting on greater

 which could embarrass US relations with China.

 26. Despite the problems we project for the succes-
 sion and the uncertainties surrounding who may even-
 tually emerge to replace Chiang Ching-kuo, we do not
 anticipate a major political upheaval in Taiwan over
 the next five years. We also believe it unlikely that
 Taiwan will declare its independence or renounce its
 avowed status as the "Republic of China" during the
 period of this Estimate, though we also believe, de-
 pending on the policies adopted by Chiang's succes-
 sors, that mainlanders and Taiwanese favorably dis-
 posed toward  greater Taiwanese  participation  in
 policy matters could increase their political strength.
 Greater factional infighting on Taiwan in the succes-
