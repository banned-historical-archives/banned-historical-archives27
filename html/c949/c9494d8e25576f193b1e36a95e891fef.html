 TO INCREASE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO AMERICAN
 CIVILIAN INTERNEES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1974
 U.S. SENATE,
 AD Hoc, SUBCOMMITTEE
 OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
 Washington, D.C.
 The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 6202,
 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Quentin N. Burdick presiding.
 Present : Senators Burdick and Fong.
 Also present : William P. Westphal, chief counsel : Brian C. South-
 well, deputy counsel; and Kathy M. Coulter, clerk.
 Senator BURDICK. This morning we are meeting to receive testi-
 mony on S. 1728 which contains proposed amendments to the War
 Claims Act of 1948.
 There are two separate amendments, the first providing an increase
 in benefits paid to civilian internees in Southeast Asia from the present
 $60 per month to $150 per month. This would be paid out of the War
 Claims Fund and would amount to a total of approximately $275,000.
 This measure was passed by the Senate on October 8, 1973, and sent
 to the House. It was amended by the House to provide certain priorities
 in payment of claims by individuals and corporations for property
 lost in World War II which is the subject of today's hearing.
 The War Claims Act was intended to provide some measure of relief
 to U.S. citizens and U.S. corporations who suffered injury, death or
 property loss as a result of the hostilities with Japan and Germany.
 They were to be paid as a matter of grace from the moneys received
 from the sale of enemy assets.
 Because the claimants had no vested rights in the fund and because
 full payment of all claims was unlikely, Congress authorized payment
 through a system of priorities based on equity.
 Personal injury and death claims were given first priority, with
 claims of small businesses, and those of $10,000 or less also paid in full.
 In 1970 further amendments gave full satisfaction of claims by reli-
 gious, charitable, and similar nonprofit organizations and authorized
 additional payments not to exceed $35,000 of which $11,000 has been
 paid to date. All claims not yet fully satisfied were to take from the
 balance on a pro rata basis.
 Six thousand six hundred and ninety-two claims have been fully
 satisfied of approximately 7,000 total claims. The total expenditure
 to date is approximately $350 million. The remaining 161 corporate
 and 187 individual claims represent the largest of the nonpriority
 awards.
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/292: CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 The payments which have been made to date can best be summarized'.
 as follows :
 Thirty-four death and personal injury awards paid in full totalling
 $510,035.
 Two hundred and fifty-one small business awards paid in full.
 totalling $12,026,093.
 Five thousand six hundred and thirty-four awards of $10,000 or less
 paid in full tomlling $13,059,352.
 Thirty-three religious, charitable and nonprofit awards paid in full.
 totalling $24,189,313.
 Eight hundred and eighty-six individuals have received payment of
 $35,276,571 leaving 187 individuals with a remaining unpaid claim.
 balance of $6,578,916.
 One hundred and ninety-nine corporations have received payment.
 of $249,441,491 leaving 161 corporations with a remaining unpaid
 claim balance of $94,700,830.
 The amendment made by the House has now proposed a payment
 priority which would satisfy all individual claims up to $500,000 and
 pay up to $50,000 on each corporate claim with the balance of any
 funds remaining after these priority awards to be divided pro rata
 by the corporations. This proposal would require an additional $6 mil-
 lion in priority payments and reduce the pro rata fund accordingly.
 It is anticipated that a total of $20 million will be available for both
 the priority and the pro rata disbursement from the fund. Under the
 present law, priority payments would take approximately $5,300,000
 leaving a fund of $14,700,000 to be distributed pro rata. The House
 amendment would require $11,300,000 in priority payments and reduce
 the pro rata fund to $8,700,000.
 At our hearing today we will hear from various claimants, individual
 and corporate, who, variously support or oppose the House amend-
 ment. Before calling our first witness a copy of S. 1728 as passed by
 the House will be incorporated in. the hearing record and be received
 without objection.

 Senator BuRDicK. Also the House hearing record will be incorpo-
 rated by reference only.
 Our first witness is Congressman Eckhardt.
 Welcome, Congressman.
 STATEMENT OF HON. BOB ECKHARDT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
 CONGRESS FROM THE EIGHTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF
 THE STATE OF TEXAS
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate this commit-
 tee's hearing me today, and I appear here only because I was most
 active in setting up the hearing in the subcommittee on the House
 side, since John Moss, the chairman of my subcommittee, was at the
 time recuperating from an operation.
 I must say frankly that the merits of the bill that.passed the
 House ultimately, that is, S. 1728, came to me as the result of study-
 ing the problean here involved, and hearing the witnesses to it. I think
 it first must be clearly understood-and I am sure that the members
 of the committee do understand it, but perhaps it is not generally
 understood by members of either body-that this of course is not the
 same as a claim in bankruptcy in which various claimants are making
 a claim against a contractual interest. It constitutes in effect a rather
 bounteous grace on the part of the Government to try to do the best
 that can be done to relieve the suffering of certain American citizens
 who suffered loss because of action taken by the enemy. Typically,
 these claims arise from Nazis taking over a family-owned corporation
 or a family-owned business in which there was an American interest,
 for instance, the case of the children of someone who may have been
 a national of Germany.
 Now of course the claims include both corporate and private in-
 dividual claims. As is known, the amount available is very inadequate
 to satisfy all the claims and thechairman has set out basically what I
 have said in the first few pages of my testimony. I would only repeat
 to say that there remain unpaid portions of 186 awards to individuals.
 My figures indicate a total of $6,525,000, Mr. Chairman. I think that
 is roughly the same as the chairman stated. There also remains 161
 awards to corporations, totaling $94,700,000. The remaining assets
 of the War Claims Fund, however, 'are far less than the total of these
 unpaid awards.
 Mr. Chairman, under existing law each award holder would receive
 up to $24,000 plus a pro rata share of the amount remaining in the
 Fund, if any, after the $24,000 distribution. Thus, under the existing
 law the corporate award holders would receive 96 percent of all pro
 rata distribution..
 Now we in the House, recognizing that the funds are not ad  uate
 and recognizing that to follow the present system would result in
 rather small recovery by those who had lost everything they had in
 connection with certain actions by enemy forces, typically of course
 the Nazis seizing the business of Jewish extraction in Germany-we
 felt that preference should be given to the individual claims. This
 would cost the corporate claim holders approximately 20 cents on the
 dollar, but it would give really substantial reparation to those who
 lost all they 'had. In other words, it is the difference between making

 Approved For Release 2001/08/2) : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 whole those who were the victims of a disaster and making whole those
 w ho engaged in a, business enterprise and ultimately lost.
 Mr. Chairman, to give a typical example of one, of the major cor-
 porate contena.er's case, I could use the case of Boise Cascade. I hope
 the committee will understand that what I say here is of course in no
 way to detract from counsel who represent the, various corporate claim
 holders, because of course they are concerned about recovery of several
 million dollars for their clients and it is quite understandable that they
 would take the position that the, present law should continue in effect.
 When I was practicing law, you know, I used to say to some of my
 colleagues on the other side of the table somewhat facetiously that
 1 wished I was on their side because if they won, they had a degree
 of victory, and if they lost, they knew that justice had been done. And
 I am also quite sure that even some of the advocates must understand
 that this is a question really of fundamental justice.
 But getting back to the case of Boise Cascade, it goes something
 like this. Boise's claim arises from the loss of Shanghai Power Co.,
 which was purchased by or was a part of American & Foreign Power
 Co. American and Foreign had completely written off Shanghai as
 worthless at the time that it consolidated with Ebasco Industries. Sub-
 sequently Ebasco was purchased by Boise Cascade, and therefore, af-
 ter 30 years with four changes in corporate structure and with pur-
 chasers always anticipating the lack of any value with respect to
 Shanghai, Boise was nevertheless able to recover $5 million up to the
 present time on the claim for Shanghai. And if this bill is not passed, it
 will recover another $3 million.
 On the other side of the scale we had a number of persons-and in-
 cidentally, that happens to be information that was contained in Boise
 Cascade's corporate publication, which I have a copy of, and I should
 like to ask permission to have it made a part of the record at this point.
 Senator BuFDicx. It, will be so inserted.
 [The corporate publication referred to follows:]
 (By Alice Dieter)
 Boise Cascade may benefit financially from the dramatic and sudden change
 iu relations between the U.S. and China. The money, which the company has
 never really counted on and doesn't today, would come from a settlement of U.S.
 claims totaling $200 million for American property expropriated by the Chinese
 in 1950.
 Boise Cascade's claim is based on its ownership of 80 percent of the common
 stock of the venerable Shanghai Power Company, a property worth $56 million
 which came to Boise Cascade in 1969 through its merger with Ebasco Indus`ries.
 The Shanghai property has never been carried by Boise Cascade as either an
 asset or a liability. In fact, even Ebasco's predecessors had written, the property
 off many years ago.
 Interest in the Shanghai Power matter has heightened considerably since it
 became evident that relations between the U.S. and China were moving toward
 relative cordiality. Settling old business debts is an invariable prelude to re-
 establising formal diplomatic recognition, which is considered a virtual cer-
 tainty in the case of China and the U.S.
 The story of Shanghai Power is a fascinating bit of recent history. When
 the government of the People's Republic of China took over the electrical utility
 it acquired what was by anyone's standards one of the world's important utility
 properties.
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : c lA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Shanghai Power began in 1901 as the electrical department of the municipal
 council administering Shanghai's famous International Settlement. Under the
 now repudiated concept of "extraterritoriality," foreign nationals doing business
 in China operated under laws of their own countries. Thus the International
 Settlement was, in effect, a western city within China.
 The Shanghai Municipal Council sought a buyer for the utility in 1929 because
 management responsibilities were becoming more than the council wanted to
 handle. The successful bidder was the Shanghai Power Company, an offshoot of
 American & Foreign Power Company, a U.S. corporation with extensive utility
 holdings in Latin America. American & Foreign Power eventually merged with
 Electric Bond and Share to become Ebasco just two years before Dbasco merged
 with Boise Cascade.
 After its successful bid, Shanghai Power found itself with a steam generation
 and electrical distribution system already producing 535 million kilowatt hours
 annually.
 During the 1930s, both Chinese and foreign industrial developers were attracted
 to Shanghai by the power company's rates, then the lowest in the world; its
 +            abundant supply of electrical energy ; the treaty port status of Shanghai ; and the
 relative stability of the area, in part made possible by the presence of powerful
 foreign gunboats. During this period, from 50 to 75% of China's industrial
 capacity was in the Shanghai area, and Shanghai Power's annual kilowatt out-
 put eventually passed the billion mark. Even today all of Alaska is consuming only
 a little over one billion kilowatt hours.
 Letters written by the power company's original officers describe with enthusi-
 asm the size and potential of their new acquisition's operating area. With some-
 what less enthusiasm, the American businessmen reflected on the British way
 of doing business, marked by the tradition of taking time for tea no matter what
 and on dealing with the Chinese, whose thousands of years of highly cultured
 existence dictated that in all things they be subtle, oblique and, of course,
 inscrutable.
 Reginald Edwards, Shanghai Power's secretary-treasurer and the last U.S.
 manager to leave following the expropriation, reported that from the very begin-
 ning the policy was to gradually build a management nucleus of Chinese. As a
 result, the western executive corps of 70 was reduced to 25 by 1945, when Shang-
 hai Power began to rebuild following the end of the war with Japan.
 The impact of the Japanese incursion into China was first felt by Shanghai
 Power in 1937 and reflected in the American & Foreign Power Company's annual
 report for that year. The Japanese Army had captured Shanghai. The company
 suffered some loss of transmission and distribution equipment during the infa-
 mous bombing of Shanghai. There was also a significant drop in power usage
 and revenue.
 The 1937 bombing and subsequent fighting were reported to shareholders as the
 "Shanghai incident." Considering the magnitude of the struggle, the damage was
 slight and by year's end demand for power was again on the upswing.
 Under Japanese influence, the International Settlement continued to exist ini-
 tially. One newspaper described it as "a small piece of neutral territory in the
 middle of a battlefield." Local Chinese officials were simply displaced by
 Japanese.
 Subsequent reports to stockholders indicated a growing electrical output, but
 any business benefits were outweighed by political and economic instability. In-
 flation kept exchange rates zooming as Chinese currency lost value, the output
 of Chinese coal mines was lost and the cost of fuel to operate the electrical gen-
 erators increased significantly. Transportation costs climbed, too, as the war in
 Europe began and much of the world's merchant shipping fleet was drawn into
 the task of supplying the allied war effort.
 By 1941, even Shanghai lost its unique status. Japanese presence became mili-
 tary occupation. Officers of Shanghai Power were interned. As far as share-
 holders were concerned, the property in China was written off in 1941 and never
 again appeared as an asset on the books.
 When the war in the Pacific ended in 1945, the officers of Shanghai Power,
 some still living in internment camps, quickly repossessed the company. Its
 generating plant had been severely disabled and its crucial supply of coal totally
 depleted.
 For the next four years Shanghai Power, along with the city of Shanghai,
 worked to rebuild and expand. Shareholders of American & Foreign Power

 were given yearly reports of plant repairs and additions and of expanding power
 capacity as the area grew and the economy revived.
 But turmoil in China continued. The civil war, interrupted by the Japanese
 invasion, resumed. It was a Mantle struggle for control of a sleeping giant oi'
 s00 million people, untold natural resources and developmental potential. No
 matter who won, the future of foreign investors was to remain uncertain.
 Shanghai Power Company operated entirely on its local income and resources.
 Authorities allowed no exchange for payout to foreign shareholders.
 So, in spite of the optimistic reports of increased power capacity and a growing;
 market, realities; dictated that the investment could not he safety reinstates,
 as a corporate asset.
 In 1950, with the final triumph of the People's Army led by Mao Tse-tung and
 fhe flight of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists to Formosa, came the last
 word: "None of the foreign staff remains in Shanghai. Shanghai Power now has
 uo contact with the Chinese locations and no direct knowledge of their operations."
 Before that filial leave-taking. company officials witnessed Nationalist planes
 from Formosa. Creak a pledge not to bomb the company's operating facilities.
 After the deliberate bombing, which Mao's regime viewed as U.S. inspired,
 company officers were required to spend daylight hours within the company's
 main generating plant as insurance against furl her bombing.
 From that day on the major concern was to secure exit visas and transporta-
 tion to get western personnel safely out of China.
 Shanghai Power existed for western interests only as sheaves of corporate
 records, volumes of annual reports, correspondence, charts and photographs,
 and in the testimony before war claims commissions convened to establish. the
 value of expropriated property.
 That value was first recognized in 1967 when Ebasco was awarded $4.8
 million in compensation for damage and loss to property sustained during the
 war years. Claim payments came from the liquidation of Japanese and German
 holdings seized at the start of World War 11. '1 lie payments amounted to 61.3? on
 the dollar.
 In a quirk of legal fate, the claims payment to Shanghai Power was again
 frozen by the U.S., this time as it Chinese asset because, by law, the company
 is a "Chinese entity." Ilbasco was allowed only reimbursement for pension
 payments made to retired Shanghai Power employees and an additional sunn to
 continue their pensions and cover expenses entailed in claims actions.
 The current claim for $56 million was certified under the International Claims
 Act of 1949 and, with claims for other expropriations, is the subject of negotia-
 tions with Pekin;, now. These negotiations will determine what share, if any, of a
 settlement Boise Cascade will realize. And the situation is certainly not simple.
 Negotiations must also decide the final release of $78 million in Chinese assets
 frozen and held in this country since 1950, including funds belonging to Shanghai
 Power.
 And, although Congress would probably not b:- receptive, there may be pressures
 to present additional claims against China, claims that were not filed during the
 18-month period in the mid-1960, when the international Claims Commission
 existed. New claims allowed now would undonSatedly reduce the size of the even-
 tual share each valid claimant would receive on its lost investment or property.
 Even if all these loose ends are tied up, there is still another roadblock to a
 final closing of Shanghai Power's books. Some stocks and bonds issued by the
 company exclusively within China in the early :1930s were pegged to the Shanghai            shy,.
 tael, a local currency.
 Hoping to facilitate settlement, Boise Cascade asked a Delaware court to deter-
 mine the value of these Chinese securities. In a recent decision which is still sub-
 ject to appeal, the court held to the classical ec!onomie theory that a currency is
 only as valuable as its government can guarantee. Political disruption and con-
 sequent. inflation erased the value of the Shanghai tael and succeeding currency
 issues, the court said. Near the end of the 1940s. $111.5 million Chinese dollars
 were equal to only $1 (Tl.S. ).
 The pace of justice and diplomacy considered, it will be some time before the
 matter of Shanghai Power is ended.
 The human side of this small part of history is the story of men and women
 who worked to build the largest electrical generating and distribution facility in
 all of China.
 Reginald Edwards, the former Shanghai Power executive, writes about his
 experience from his retirement home in England. "Looking back on the 20-odd

 years period the company existed under American management, from a detached
 point of view as I can see now, it was quite magnificently run under fantastic
 conditions. Throughout there was virtually no return to the shareholders. But
 by 1949 we were able to hand over the plant and materials in the same state as
 in 1941. The plant had been renewed and rehabilitated completely and converted
 twice-coal to oil, oil to coal.
 "The importance to China generally and to Shanghai itself cannot be over-
 emphasized. The company had nothing to show for 20 years of endeavour except
 total loss. The gain went to China."
 Mr. ECI HARDT. On the other side of the coin, Mr. Chairman, the
 claims of the individuals are typically of this nature, for instance,
 someone may have had a family business like say a bakery. They may
 have escaped confiscation of the bakery for a particular period of time
 by using some family business name or family corporation, but ulti-
 mately it was discovered that it was say, the Greenberg bakery and
 was ultimately seized by the Nazis. Everything was lost in that case.
 The persons involved in such a venture were not in a position to
 choose where they engaged in risk. They were simply doing the best
 they could to hold their family business intact.
 I should hasten to say that none of these claims can be made by
 other than citizens of the United States who at the time of the loss
 were citizens of the United States. So I think that there is a vast dif-
 ference between the two categories of the plaintiffs. The person losing
 say, the family bakery would ultimately receive only a relatively small
 part of the loss of an entire family fortune if we do not change the law
 at this time.
 Now those it seems to me are the points which sustain the merits
 of the action that has been taken up to this time. I certainly thank
 the committee for this opportunity.
 Senator BURDICK. Well, Congressman, you have presented a good
 case for your proposition.
 Mr. ECKIIARDT. Thank you, sir.
 Senator BURDICK. I have some questions. You say that if the indi-
 vidual claims are paid in full, that the corporate claims will be paid
 out at the rate of 80 cents on the dollar?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. I don't believe it would run that high.
 Senator BURDICK. Well you said it would cost them 20 cents on the
 dollar.
 Mr. ECKHARDT. It would cost them 20 cents on the dollar of their
 recovery. Their recovery would be reduced by 20 percent if the indi-
 vidual claims were paid first, in other words.
 Senator BuRDICK. I am still saying that they get 80 percent of their
 claim?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. They get 80 percent of their entitlement under this
 claim. I think we may just be bickering with words. I think generally
 though what you say is correct; yes.
 Senator BURDICK. With the $20 million available for payout, if the
 individuals are paid in full, then their entitlement, Mr. Eckhardt,
 based upon the $20 million, would be reduced 20 cents on the dollar. Is
 that another way of putting it?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Yes; the amount they would receive if the House
 amendment became the law, Senator, would be reduced by 20 percent.
 Senator BuRnrcx. In other words your $20 million is undivided at
 this particular moment, correct? Let us say it is. And if the individ-
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/2tP: CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 uals are paid out in -full on this entitlement, the corporations then
 would have to be reduced by 20 percent?
 Mr. EcxnARerr. That is right.
 Senator BURDICK. Why should we take a different rule than we use
 in bankruptcy cases? There is no such preference when you have a
 bankruptcy claim, is there?
 Mr. EOKHARDT. Mr. Chairman, that is what I started out saying,
 that I think this has to be distingushed from a case in which persons
 are making a claim against a fund to which they have a contractual
 right. In such a case T think as a matter of constitutional law, we can-
 not destroy their contract. Sometimes we do individuals injustice by
 following that rule, but we are bound to do it because there is a con-
 tractual right to a claim against the fund which remains, which is less
 than enough to pay the whole amount.
 And in this instance of course, nobody has a contractual right or
 any property right in the fund at all. The entitlement which is created,
 was created by statute. The fund comes from the sale of enemy assets
 that we seized and of course those assets had nothing to do with the
 assets of say Boise Cascade or any of the individuals involved. The
 question is, to what extent and in what manner will we divide this
 fund, which we have complete control over and in which nobody has
 a contractual right or a property right, and how do we best handle
 this to achieve the highest degree of equity? That I think is the dif-
 ference between the bankruptcy situation and the one here.
 Senator Brn;nrcic. You say that when weighing or balancing the
 equities, an individual has lost everything and the corporations are
 still in existence.
 Mr. ECKHARDT. That is correct. The corporation in the first place
 risked only a small part of its total capital, but they would take up
 the major part of the remaining amount. But, as I say, as a proportion
 of the total investment of the corporation, the claim was very smnall.
 As I pointed out, it is extremely difficult to get funds back to
 those who lost them 30 years ago iin a corporate situation because the
 corporation's stockholders have changed even in the normal situation.
 And as I say, the example I gave of Boise Cascade, well, in that one
 there were even a number of acquisitions; there were three or four
 acquisitions or consolidations that occurred in the 30-year period.
 But in the case of an individual, Senator Burdick, it is that person
 who has the loss and it, is that, person who is recompensed for the loss.
 I should also mention that a number of these claims are insurance
 claims. In a case like that, of course, the insurance company was will-
 ing to take a risk overseas say in Germany and willing to take a risk
 overseas say in France. The insurance company was drawing premiums
 from all its risk taking. Now in Germany it lost whereas in France
 perhaps it didn't. Of course., also it has great investments in the
 United States.
 The thing is that the insurance comnanv was in the business of risk
 taking and was paid for that risk taking through premiums. but it is
 now attemptin.a to recover the losses where it bet and lost. Now that
 is not the situation of the individual.
 Senator FrNO. May I interject here?
 Senator Burnzcx. Certainly.
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : di -RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Senator Form. You say the insurance company is in the business of
 taking losses and is paid premiums to take that risk. If you say that,
 why do you class insurance corporations with other corporations in
 the same class?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Well, Senator Fong, perhaps there is a different
 equity there too. It is difficult for me to see much justification for an
 insurance company's recovery, but even in the case of a large corpo-
 ration, the large corporation is risking only a small part of its capital
 because it expects a gain with respect to its investment. Perhaps that
 gain was considerable before the taking of the property. So it at least
 had the choice of running the risk overseas or not running it.
 In the case of virtually all of the individual claims, there was no
 choice at all. This was a matter of family savings.
 Senator FONG. Now the insurance company claims, are these sub-
 rogation claims?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. I think some of them are. I am not sure about that,
 but I think that is correct. Counsel could probably verify that.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. That is my understanding, Senator Fong, that they
 are filed on a subrogated basis and they have received about 65 per-
 cent to date.
 Senator FONG. I see. So insurance companies are actually now taking
 the place of the person who was at a loss? In other words it paid the
 person under the insurance policy, and now they are asking to be
 subrogated in the place of that person, is that correct?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. That would be the case of those subrogations for
 corporate losses of the same type as the corporate claims.
 Senator FONG. Wouldn't it be fair to give that premium back?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. We haven't asked that, and that has not been raised.
 Senator FONG. What I am trying to show is, in this business this
 is a risk they take.
 Mr. ECKHARDT. I think it is.
 Senator FONG. And now they are asking to be reimbursed in full
 plus the premiums that they have received?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Frankly, I don't think that is too different from the
 situation of a company that say purchases Shanghai Power Co. That
 was a risk too and it was an understood risk at the time it was taken.
 Frequently overseas investment may reap very large and even windfall
 profits. On the other hand they may result in the kind of losses that
 occurred here.
 Senator FoNG. Now a corporation under your formula would lose
 20 cents on every dollar. Is that correct?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Well, what I am trying to distinguish between is
 that they are not receiving 20 percent less than their entire losses, but
 they would receive 20 percent less on their recovery than if the law
 remains as it is today. In other words, we would reduce their recovery
 by passage of this bill by 20 cents on the dollar in order to give
 individual preference.
 Senator FONG. In other words if we didn't enact this bill, they would
 recover 20 percent more?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. That is correct.
 Senator FONG. But still they would not be made whole?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Nobody would be made whole.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/21M: CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Senator F0NG, Yes. Now with the passage of this bill as passed the
 house how much would the corporations lose as distinguished from the
 individuals? Would the individual be wholly paid?
 Mr. ECKHHAR.DT. The individuals have remaining awards totaling
 $6,525,000. That is 186 awards. Out of the fund they could be paid
 wholly for this amount as I understand. Of course they are really never
 wholly paid because what they are getting is their capital losses after
 30 years, so nobody is really getting true value.
 Senator FONG. That is right, but what we are trying to do now, you
 see, we are trying to establish equities. Everybody has suffered. The
 corporations have suffered. They haven't used their money. The indi-
 vidual has not gotten his money and hasn't used the money.
 1-row would the difference between the individual and the corpora-
 tion come about if this bill is pas=sed by the Senate, which was passed
 by the House?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Well, let me seek. Thera remains in the fund unpaid
 portions of 186 awards to individuals, which is $6,525,000, and there
 remains 161 awards to corporations, totaling $94,700,000.
 Mr. WESTFHAL. Mr. Chairman, I believe I could supply the infor-
 mation the Senator wants.
 Senator FONG. Would you supply it for us later on?
 Mr. WESTPZU.AL. Well, I could give it to you right now.
 Senator FONG. All i_ght.
 Mr. WESTPirAT,. Under the House amendment, $6.5 million approxi-
 mately would be paid to individuals. This would pay individuals in
 full. On the part of the House amendment under which each corpora-
 tion or corporate claimant would get up to $50,000 on its claim, that
 would require $4.8 million. That would leave a balance of $8.7 million,
 assuming a total fund of $20 million. So it would leave a balance of
 $8.7 million available for pro rata, distributions to corporations.
 So that under the House amendment the total payments that would
 go to corporations, assuming the $20 million is available, would be ap-
 proximately $12.5 million.
 Senator FONG. You say $15.5 million?
 Mr. WESTPHAL. No; $12.5 million.
 Senator FONG. What was that?
 Mr. WESTPII&L. No, excuse me, $13 million.
 Mr. EGKHARDT. So roughly two-thirds to the corporations and one-
 third to the individuals.
 Senator Force. You divided the corporations into big corporations
 and small corporations, didn't you? Mr. ECKHARDT. Yes; that was under the McCollister amendment,
 which honored first up to $50,000, which is an advantage to those with
 the relatively smaller claims. That wouldn't necessarily be the smaller
 corporations though, but there has been consideration in previous
 payments with respect to small business.
 Senator FoNG. So some small corporations have been paid in full
 already?
 Mr. ECKITAHDT. I don't believe anybody has been paid in full.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Small corporations as defined by the Small Business
 Administration have been paid in full.
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Oh, yes.
 Senator F0NG. And what is the rationale on this $50,000?

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : Cl ,-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Mr. ECKHARDT. The rationale was that when there is-well, actually
 this was a compromise that ultimately sort of sold the bill. Mr. McCol-
 lister on the Republican side offered this, which seemed pretty equit-
 able; that is, that relatively small claims should have a preference over
 relatively big ones.
 Senator FONG. Do you know what happened in World War I? Do
 you know what we did than? I mean, with respect to claims in World
 War I did we follow something like this?
 Mr. ECKIIARDT. No, sir, I don't. I don't know what happened in
 World War I.
 Senator FONG. You don't know how they distributed the money?
 Mr. ECffiIARDT. No, sir.
 Senator FONG. Mr. Chairman, we would like to find that out.
 Senator BulmICK. All right, we will do what we can and make it a
 part of the record.
 [The information referred to follows:]
 MEMORANDUM PREPARED RY THE STAFF OF TIIE AD Hoc SUBCOMMITTEE, JANUARY 8,
 1975
 Re : World War I War Claim Priorities
 Claims of damage to person or property as a result of the hostile action of
 World War I were governed by the "Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928",
 45 Stat. 254. These claims and awards were administered by the Mixed Claims
 Settlement Commission.
 World War I claims varied most markedly from the claims arising from World
 War II in that awards were given not only to U.S. nationals for their claims
 against the Axis powers but also to German, Austrian and Hungarian nationals
 for certain losses caused by the United States.
 To pay these various awards seized assets were liquidated to create the "Ger-
 man Special Deposit Account" from which all claims were paid.
 Section 4(c) of the Act enumerated the priorities of payment from the fund.
 Awards of U.S. nationals were given first priority and were distributed as
 follows :
 (1) Payment of all expenses of administration of the Act
 (2) Payment of all awards of U.S. nationals for death and personal injury
 (3) Payment of all awards of U.S. nationals other than death or personal
 injury and up to $100,000
 (4) Payment of all U.S. nationals with awards over $100,000 up to 80
 per cent of the remaining balance after payment under priority 3.
 The remaining distribution priorities are directed to awards of foreign nationals
 and the United States government.
 Senator FONG. I have no further questions.
 Senator BURDICK. What are the facts in regard to the corporations
 taking tax losses on their claims whereas individuals I am advised
 have not? Would you tell us about that?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. Well there was a difference in the results from tax
 benefits enjoyed by the corporate award holders because of their losses
 The corporate award holders have collectively taken more than $37
 million in tax benefits as the result of the deduction taken from U.S.
 income taxes. Such tax benefits, coupled with subsequent payments
 under the War Claims Act, have allowed many corporations to recover
 almost the entire amount of their loss.
 These tax deductions were not of benefit to individuals because even
 though the individuals were all U.S. citizens at the time of their loss
 under the terms of the War Claims Act, judicial interpretation of the
 deduction provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to pre-
 sumed rate of loss prevented most individuals from taking the deduc-
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/1-4: CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 tions. U.S. corporations were unaffected by this interpretation and
 remained free ~so deduct their losses.
 Senator BuiwICK. What you are saying is that if the corporations
 have gotten a benefit of some $37 million, they actually got a great
 deal of tax benefit and no individual got any tax benefit in income tax
 returns?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. I think that our records before our committee show
 they didn't. There is also this problem that in order to show a tax loss,
 Senator, you have to make something in which you could write off
 your losses against. The corporations were always in a position to write
 this off against their earnings, but of course a lot of the individuals
 simply were making nothing. A lot of them were elderly people and
 a lot of them were sirr,ply living off the interest of their investment,
 which was then removed.
 Now at this point there was nothing for them to take a loss against.
 Senator FONG. But if they did take a tax loss, don't you think that
 should be taken into consideration?
 Mr.  ECKHARDT.  There has been sorne consideration taken with
 respect to deductions for tax losses ; yes.
 Senator Foxe. For individuals?
 Mr. ECKHAR]Yr. In the cases of all claimants, as I understand it; yes.
 But of course that consideration can't correct the fact that some people
 have been totally reimbursed through tax losses.
 Mr. WVr sTPH.tr.. Mr. Chairman, if I could just ask a couple of clarify-
 ing questions here?
 Senator BURDICK. Fine.
 Mr. WEsTPnAL. Uneer the War Claims Act of 1948 there was a pro-
 vision which said that any corporation which claimed. a tax loss on
 account of any of these war losses had to report their claim of a
 tax loss to the War Claims Commission, and in turn the War Claims
 Commission was required to deduct the amount of tax benefit resulting
 from that claimed tax loss, that is, deduct it from the amount of the
 award which was made to that corporate claimant.
 Now by virtue I believe of section 206 of the War Claims Act, which
 is section 2017(E) under title 50 of the appendix, any corporation
 which reported a tax loss was then granted a tax exemption insofar
 as any payments made on their claim was concerned. So that a corpora-
 tion for example which claimed a tax loss, whether it be $400 or $4.,000,
 and thereafter received any payments at all on its claim, it would be
 exempt from any income taxation on it.
 Now to the extent that a corporation might receive a claim of 100
 percent from the War Claims Commission, that payment would be
 entirely tax exempt whether it were treated as a capital or ordinary
 income or on any other basis. If it is taxable, it is granted an exemp-
 tion. Now that applies, only to corporations. That is my understanding
 of the law, Mr. Chairman. Is that yours, Congressman?
 Mr. ECIKHARDT. I certainly thank counsel for the clarifying state-
 ment. I understand it the same wav.
 Senator BURDICK. But because of the operation of the Internal Rev-
 enue Service Code or because an individual had no income, he had no
 tax benefits from tax losses?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. That is generally the case from the testimony we
 received, and I think it is uniformly the case.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : dA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Senator FONG. May I ask a question. When the corporation filed its
 claim was the tax loss a deductible item in that claim or did they file
 a full claim disregarding the tax loss they took?
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Senator, my understanding-and it can be corrected
 by Mr. McClellan who will be a later witness-'but my understanding
 is that the corporation filed its claim in the full amount and the Com-
 mission determined the value of the property which it lost in the full
 amount, and then by virtue of this law, it was required to deduct from
 that full value the amount of any tax benefit received by that corpora-
 tion as the result of a claimed tax loss.
 Senator FONG. Take, for example, if the corporation had a $1 million
 loss and they took $50,000 out of it as tax loss, what would their claim
 be?
 Mr. WESTPHAL. That would reduce their claim to $950,000.
 Senator FONG. So the figure is $950,000?
 Mr. WESTPHAL. That is correct.
 Senator FONG. And you said the corporation's stockholders are en-
 tirely different from the stockholders who were then the stockholders?
 Mr. ECKIIARDT. In 30 years it would be a very great change, yes. In
 some instances these has been an entire supplanting of previous cor-
 porations by sale or merger in which these losses have already been
 taken into account.
 Senator FONG. As I understand it, some of these corporations were
 incorporated by persons who wanted to get away from losing their
 property so they took their personal property and made several organi-
 zations or corporations?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. No, sir. Actually the claims by a. corporation are only
 for corporate losses, the individual claims may be the interest of an
 individual in a corporation and he must be an American citizen-in
 other words, you see, I am talking about totally owned family type
 corporations.
 Senator FONG. And how did you treat them?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. They are the individual claimed losses, you see?
 Senator FONG. And they are treated as individuals and -are not
 treated as corporations?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Mr. Chairman, may I just ask one question here?
 Senator BURDICK. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. You make reference to Boise Cascade involving the
 Shanghai powerplant. It is my understanding that the claim was
 filed and allowed in the amount of approximately $7 million and some
 fraction and that in 1967 or 1969, as a result of the payment authorized
 by Congress, some $4 million was paid on that claim. Now that was
 paid, according to my understanding, to Ebasco and not to Boise
 Cascade; Ebasco being a predecessor of Boise Cascade. $4 million was
 paid and I think you refer to it as a $5 million payment. Now that
 payment was made to Ebasco prior to 1969 when Boise Cascade ac-
 quired all the corporate stock and assets of Ebasco. Do you have
 anything to indicate that my understanding is incorrect?
 Mr. ECKHARDT. I think that is correct. I think that is probably cov-
 ered in this attachment.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. There will be a witness from Boise Cascade later
 on and we can attempt to clarify the facts at that time. That is my
 understanding of what the facts and the record shows though.

 Mr. EcKHARU/r. The attachment I have here is called the Venerable
 Shanghai Power Co. and is written by Alice Dieter. As I under-
 stand it, Boise Cascade's claim is based on its ownership of 80 percent
 of the common stock of the Venerable Shanghai Power Co., a prop-
 erty worth $56 million., which came to Boise Cascade in 1969 through
 its merger with Ebasco industries. The Shanghai property has never
 been carried by Boise Cascade as either an asset or liability. In fact,
 even Ebasco's predecessor had written the property off many years
 ago. By 1941 even Shanghai lost its unique status and the offices of
 Shanghai Power Co. were interned. As far as the shareholders are
 concerned, the property in China was written off in 1941 and never
 again appeared as an asset on the books.
 So, Mr. Westphal, I am not sure who got the money or whether it
 was one of the successors in line, but I am sure that you must be correct
 if you have looked into the matter, Mr. Westphal, that Ebasco was
 the one that received it.
 Mr. WIESTPRAL. In any event that can he clarified by a later witness.
 Mr. EcKHARDT. That is right. Whoever was the owner of Shanghai
 at the time of that claim I am sure received the money and that
 would of course appear clearly on the record.
 Senator BURDTCK. Well Ebasco became a part of Boise Cascade?
 Mr. ECKHARDT.That, is right.
 Senator BURDIOK. So when they got the money, whether that became
 a part of Boise Cascade or not is a question we will have to ask a
 later witness.
 Mr. ECKHARDT. That is right, and of course, Boise is now claiming
 the additional amount.
 Senator BURDICK. Well thank you very much, Congressman.
 Mr. ECKHAFDT. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, may I ask
 that the full statement be incorporated into the record ?
 Senator 13u:mICK.  Without objection, that will be received and
 placed in the record.

 ON AMENDING THE WAIL CLAIMS ACT
 STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN BOB ECKIIARDT (.3)-TEXAS), BEFORE A SUBCOMMITTEE
 OF THE  SENATE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE, DECEMBER 3, 1974
 f. appreciate the opportunity to testify before this Subcommittee in support of
 S. 1728, as amended by the House of Representatives. I am a member of the Sub-
 committee on Commerce and Finance of the house Interstate and Foreign Com-
 merce Committee which held hearings on this bill and which added the House
 amendments.
 On October 8, 1973, the Senate passed S. 1728 to amend the War Claims Act
 to provide additional compensation to U.S. civilians who had been held prisoner
 during the Vietnam war to give them the same benefits as those enjoyed by mili-
 tary prisoners or war. On November i, 1973, the House Subcommittee on Com-
 mn.erce and Finance held hearings on S. 1728 and also on two House bills to
 amend the War claims Act to give individuals a priority over corporations in the
 payment for awards for property losses suffered during World War II. The Sub-
 committee examined these proposals in great detail, approved them, and com-
 bined them into a single bill, S. 1728. That bill was subsequently further amended
 and reported by the full Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, and it
 was passed by Vie House by a vote of 368-17 on August 12, 1974. Since then S.
 1728 has been awaiting Senate action on the House amendments.
 The War Claims Act was passed to compensate U.S. citizens for losses suffered
 in World War L[ out of he assets of German and Japanese nationals seized by
 the U.S. Government during the War. The Act created the Foreign Claims Settle?

 ment commission to adjudicate each claim for an award. All claims have now
 been adjudicated. Awardholders in four priority categories created by previous
 legislation have been paid in full, as follows : (1) awards based on death or
 personal injury; (2) awards to small business corporations; (3) awards under
 $10,000; and (4) awards to charitable and religious organizations. There remain
 unpaid portions of 186 awards to individuals (totaling $6,525,000) and 161 awards
 to corporations (totaling $94,700,000). The remaining assets of the War Claims
 Fund, however, are far less than the total of these unpaid awards. Under exist-
 ing law, each awardholder would receive up to $24,000, plus a pro rata share of
 the amount remaining in the Fund, if any, after the $24,000 distribution. Thus,
 under existing law, the corporate awardholders would receive over 96 percent
 of all pro rata distributions.
 Recognizing that all the remaining outstanding awards cannot be paid in full,
 the Subcommittee, the full Committee and the House of Representatives concluded
 that the losses suffered by individuals as a class were of such a fundamentally
 different character from the losses of corporations as a class that the individual
 awardholders should be given priority in the payment of their awards. The
 4 marked contrast between the two kinds of losses compelled such legislative con-
 clusion. The individuals' awards were the result of loss of homes, personal belong-
 ings and small family-owned and operated businesses. In most cases the indi-
 viduals lost everything they had. In every case in which an individual award was
 based on a business loss that business was family owned. Some of these businesses
 were corporations, some not, but the critical point, in my view was that the in-
 dividuals did not simply lose an investment ; they lost the core to economic
 survival. In comparison, the corporate awardholders lost assets of foreign sub-
 sidiaries that constituted a very small portion of their overall net assets. Every
 major corporate awardholders is a large, publicly held multinational corpora-
 tion which emerged from the war relatively unscathed, well prepared to do busi-
 ness as usual. Thus, the personal disasters suffered by the individuals differed
 so fundamentally from the relatively insignificant investment losses suffered by
 the corporations in their immediacy, severity and totality as, to justify a priority
 to individual awards within the spirit and intent of the War Claims Act.
 It is pertinent here, I think, to note that many of the individual awardholders
 who sustained those losses are now elderly persons living on small fixed incomes.
 Most of them receive scant Social Security benefits since they spent most of their
 productive years abroad. Full payment of their War Claims awards would go a
 long way toward providing a final financial stake for them now. Such payments
 would be at small cost to the corporations because the aggregate amount of the
 individual awards is so small compared to the aggregate amount of the corpo-
 rate awards that enactment of S. 1728 would cost the corporate awardholders
 only about twenty cents on each dollar of their award balance.
 It is also pertinent to note that the individual awardholders either suffered
 the loss themselves or are the widows or children of those who did. Many of the
 corporate awardholders, on the other hand, are conglomerates that derive their
 claims as a result of the acquisition of the companies 'suffering the loss many
 years after the loss had occurred. In some cases the acquiring company paid
 little or nothing for the stock of the acquired company since its assets had been
 substantially reduced by the loss they had sustained. A good example of such an
 acquisition involves Boise Cascade, one of the most vocal opponents of S. 1728.
 Boise's loss is based on a loss suffered by the Shanghai Power Company in 1941.
 At the time of the loss, Shanghai Power was a subsidiary of American and For-
 eign Power. Many years ago, A&FP wrote the assets of Shanghai Power down to
 zero. A&FP merged with Ebasco in 1967 and Ebasco was acquired by Boise Cas-
 cade in 1969. Both Boise and Ebasco have always carried the Shanghai Power
 stock on their books at zero. Boise now seeks to recover $3 million in compensa-
 tion for the losses suffered by Shanghai Power (A&FP having -already received
 almost $5 million from the War Claims Fund). These facts are set forth in an
 item that appeared in the "Boise Cascade Quarterly" of February 1974, which
 I ask to be included in this record of hearings.
 Boise Cascade's claim for compensation is far more remote sand far less com-
 pelling than the claim of an individual who saw his home, personal property or
 small family business destroyed in the war. Under any principle of equity these
 two claims cannot be regarded as equivalent. S. 1728 would not deny Boise a
 right to compensation. It would merely give priority to claims of greater
 immediacy.

 Even in those cases in which the present corporate award-holder is the com-
 pany that suffered the loss, many of the present stockholders are not the stock-
 holders of 30 years ago that suffered the loss. By contrast, the individual award-
 holders are the Very persons or the widows or children of the persons who suf-
 fered the loss.
 Every individual awardholder is a United States citizen. It was the basic
 purpose of the War Claims Act to compensate U.S. citizens for their loss. Some
 of the stockholders of the corporate awardholders are foreign nationals who have
 participaited and will participa to in payments fromthe Fund.
 In addition to the fundamental difference in the character and personal im-
 pact of the war losses between individuals as a class and corporations as a class
 there is a significant difference in the benefits already received by the two
 classes. This difference results from the tax benefits enjoyed by the corporate
 awardholders because of their losses. The corporate awardholders have collec-
 tively taken more, Than $37,000,000 in tax benefits as a result of deductions from
 U.S. income tax. Such tax benefits, coupled with subsequent payments under
 the War Claims Act, have allowed many corporations to recover almost the en-
 tire amount of their loss. These tax deduction:: were not of benefit to individuals
 because, even though the individuals were all U.S. citizens at the time of their
 loss under the terms of the War Claims Act, judicial interpretation of the de-
 duction provisior. of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to presumed date of
 loss) prevented most individuals from taking n deduction. U.S. corporations were
 unaffected by this interpretation and remained free to deduct their losses.
 Furthermore,, corporate claimants may also ;lave taken substantial deductions
 from state and local taxes as a result of their war losses. These tax benefits were
 not taken into account at all in granting of war claims awards.
 Many corporate awardholders may also have received substantial tax and
 other benefits after the war from foreign governments because of their'war losses.
 These benefits were unavailable to individuals. Foreign tax benefits were not
 taken into account in the granting of war claims awards.
 lany of the corporate claimants are insurar ce companies which insured risks
 at high rates during the war years and paid out proceeds on the policies they
 had written. These insurance companies, which have been subrogated to the rights
 of the insured corporations, have already received significant compensation for
 their losses through their premiums.
 The present corporate awardholders have already received more than $150
 million from the War Claims Fund. Through this recovery, together with their
 tax benefits, they have received in compensation for their losses more than 11
 times as much as the individual awardholders.
 In summary, the individual awardholders suffered losses that were more
 severe than those of the corporations, but they have recovered a smaller portion
 of their losses.
 In the past, the Congress has created numerous priorities for payment under
 the War Claims Act. Therefore, creation of a priority for individual awardholders
 as provided by S. 1728 would set no precedent, but rather would continue the
 established  pattern  of  weighing  the  equities  among  different  classes  of
 awardholders.
 It is especially important that the Congress enact this bill during this session.
 Another distribution from the War Claims Fund-perhaps the final distributio?n-
 is scheduled to he made early in 1975. Therefore, if this bill is not enacted now
 the issue may well be rendered moot by this prospective distribution. I believe
 that a compelling case for S. 1728 has been made, and I urge the Subcommittee
 to recommend that the Senate adopt the bill as amended by the House.
 Senator BIT DICK.  Our next w'Ltness is Mr. Wayland McClellan,
 General Counsel for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.
 STATEMENT OF WAYLAND McCLEIJAN, GENERAL COUNSEL,
 FOR'EI'GN CLAIMS SETTLEMENT COMMISSION
 Mr. MCCr,Fr,r,.AN. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and members of
 the subcommittee. I appreciate this opportunity of appearing here this
 morning. I have to apologize for not having a written statement. I
 explained to Mr. Westphal that we at the Commission had made a
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75BOO38OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : d  -RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 full report on this legislation and the amendment by the House com-
 mittee that was chaired by Congressman Eckhardt in his subcommit-
 tee, and we would just like to reiterate our position that we are, op-
 posed to the changing of the payment priorities as reported out and
 passed by the House of Representatives.
 We feel that all of the small claimants have already been taken
 care of. We feel that even though there are individual claimants who
 have unpaid balances on awards, that these are not the so-called
 small claimants. The Congress in the initial enactment of this legisla-
 tion took care of what they thought the equities were insofar as small
 claimants were concerned. They paid the death claims first and they
 paid the small business corporations and small business people as de-
 terminated by the Small Business Administration. They paid up to
 $10,000. After that they had a pro rata payment then based upon the
 money that was available in the war claims fund.
 The Congress also decided at a, later date that there were other peo-
 ple who should be taken care of and these were the charitable groups
 that the chairman referred to this morning.
 Initially the Commission opposed that change but we compromised
 or rather the Congress compromised by adding an amendment to say
 that they would pay the charitable groups in full, but they also raised
 the amount from $10,000 to $35,000. The Commission then withdrew
 its opposition to that amendment when they raised the priority to
 $35,000 and we felt that this would be sufficient to take care of all of
 the so-called small claimants and the equities would be served by doing
 this.
 Now the amendment that the House has passed in our opinion is
 bad precedent. We feel that this could affect-I mean we feel the In-
 ternational Claims Settlement Act, which the Commission also ad-
 ministers, would be affected, and it could hamper the Department of
 State in its negotiations with various countries on claims agreements
 if they feel that once an agreement is concluded based on a set of
 rules, that we go back and change the rules in the middle of the game.
 I think that would be bad precedent for the Congress to do.
 Now, of course, as Mr. Eckhardt has said, this is strictly a matter
 that is within the purview of the Congress. You can do this. There
 is no law that will prevent the Congress from doing this, but we feel
 that it is bad precedent. And I don't want to prolong this because I
 think Mr. Eckhardt has made a very good statement. I notice we have
 a lot of witnesses here. So our position is already in the record and
 I think that my time and the committee's time would be better served
 if I just referred by reference to our statement, which you already in-
 corporated, and also answered any questions that the committee may
 have.
 I think that this would be a better procedure if you so desire.
 Senator BuRDICK. Well, we certainly appreciate that approach. It
 is always helpful to get at the meat of the thing. You say that all
 claims of individuals up to $35,000 were either paid or will have been
 paid under present law?
 Mr. McCLELLAN. They probably will be paid under present law.
 That is correct. They have already received up to $10,000. Let us say
 you have $100,000 or a $200,000 claim. So they got $10,000 initially.
 And when the program was completed in May of 1967 and we made

 Approved For Release 2001/08/x: CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 our final report to the Secretary of the Treasury, who is the paying
 agent, he was able to pay an additional 61.3 percent of the award. in
 excess of the $10,000, of the amount of the award in excess of $10,000.
 In 1972 or 1973 there was another deposit. The charitable and reli-
 gious groups received a priority and then they paid out an additional
 $11,000. So the claimants we are talking about now have received
 substantial amounts on the awards that, have been granted. All the
 strtall claimants in our opinion have been paid in full.
 Senator BURDICK. That is what I am getting at. Under the present
 law they haven't been paid all yet, but they will be paid up to $35,000?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. TTp to $35,000; yes.
 Senator B1rRnICK. For each individual claim?
 Mr. MCCL,Fr,r Ax. That is correct.
 Senator BURDICK. Then we are talking about claims between $35,000
 and $500,000, aren't we, in the House amendment?
 Mr. MCCLELL,AN. Well, that is approximately what we are talking
 about.
 Senator BURDICK. Well, when the $35,000 payments are completed,
 what percentage of the small claimants will that take care of?
 Mr. McCrxu,AN. Well this should be all of them. It all depends
 really, on what, we are calling small claimants.
 Senator BURDICK. My staff tells me all the small claimants will
 be taken care of except 43.
 Mr. McCr,FT.r AN. That is correct.
 Senator BURDICK. Of course, their claims would range from up-
 wards of $35,000 to $500,000?
 Mr. MCCLFLT AN. Yes, sir, that is correct.
 Senator Brmoicx. Now in this group of individual claimants are
 there small companies?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. I wouldn't consider them very small. We made a
 study when this bill was first introduced and we examined all of
 the individual awards that had unpaid balances. Many of them were
 based upon. ownership interests in corporations that themselves couldn't
 qualify. I mean, the statute that we administer requires that in order
 to qualify as a corporate claimant, the corporation had to be organized
 in one of the 50 States or one of the territories or the District of Colum-
 bia, and the outstanding stock must have been owned by natural per-
 sons who were U.S. citizens to the extent of at least 50 percent.
 Now some of these individuals who have unpaid balances, claimed
 through corporations that were incorporated in Germany, for example,
 while that corporation itself could not. qualify as a claimant, individ-
 uals
 came in for their proportionate stockholder interest in this Ger-
 man corporation. Frankly, we just don't see the difference between that
 type of a corporation and an American corporation. We feel that
 this is discriminatory toward the American corporations. I am not
 going to argue the relative merits of whether or not a family holding
 was cloaked in a corporate structure to try to protect themselves from
 confiscation under the Nazis. This may have been true in some cases,
 but I am sure this is not true in every case where you have individuals
 with unpaid balances.
 Senator Fox(}. If I as an individual had $10,000 in a German corpo-
 ration as a stockholder, then I would have a claim then for $10,000?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. For your stockholder interest. Let us say you had

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : ClA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 100,000 outstanding shares of stocks, and you owned 10,000, you
 would be entitled to claim 10 percent of the total loss sustained by the
 German corporation.
 Senator FONG. But if I had that share in the American corporation,
 I would not be?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. You could not file.
 Senator FONG. I could not file?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Only the corporation could file.
 Senator FONG. Only the corporation?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator FONG. It is my understanding that any Federal tax savings
 were deducted from the amount of the awards made to the corpo-
 rations.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct. The statute required the Commis-
 sion to deduct this from the total amount of the award. Mr. Westphal,
 I think, directly stated in answer to your previous question, Senator,
 that if you had a loss of let us say $100,000 and the corporation re-
 ceived tax benefits of $10,000, we would say that the loss was $100,000,
 but the award granted would be $90,000 because the law requires the
 Commission to deduct from the loss the tax benefits received on ac-
 count of this loss.
 Senator FONG. Was any consideration given to deductions for corpo-
 rate, State, or local tax savings?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. No.
 Senator FONG. That is to say you took the tax saving as a Federal
 tax saving?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator FONG. What about the State tax savings?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. I don't think this entered into it.
 Senator FONG. That didn't enter in?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. No.
 Senator FONG. So if the corporation say out of $10,000, which he
 saved because of Federal tax losses, saved that much and then he saved
 $1,000 on a State loss, that $1,000 would not have been computed?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Well, it may have been. I can't answer that
 definitely because the practical administration of this was as follows :
 The corporations were required to submit a statement under oath
 that stated the amount of tax benefits that they had received on
 account of the same loss for which the claim was made.
 Senator FONG. I see. That would have been included?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. They may have included this in their affidavit. I
 can't answer definitely they did not include this into their considera-
 tion. I am sure, some of the representatives of the corporations would
 be able to answer that because they are, I am sure, thoroughly familiar
 with how they arrived at the affidavits that they presented to the
 Commission under oath as to what benefits they did receive.
 Senator FONG. I see. So the benefits were not confined to Federal
 tax losses?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That could be. I just can't answer that definitely
 because I don't know what they considered when the corporations
 furnished this information to the Commission, and I would guess that
 any accountant on the corporate staff would probably include the
 State taxes also.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29: CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Senator FONG. Could you ascertain that for us?
 Mr. MCCLMLAN. Yes we can. There was one other question that
 maybe I just ought to clarify just a little bit and that was asked of
 Mr. Eckhardt :in connection with the insurance company claims.
 ,\s you all know, during World War II the U.S. Government in
 order to get supplies to Europe and to the war areas encouraged insur-
 ance companies to underwrite these losses in order to encourage private
 shipment to send supplies to our force,, who were fighting all over
 the world. Now the statute that we have administered required the
 Commission to pay the net losses to the insurance company. This would
 mean that any premiums that they had received would have to be
 deducted from the amount of the losses for which they would certify
 in their favor. So it is not a windfall in chat the insurance companies
 got the premiums, they paid out, and then they recovered the full
 amount of the loss. 't'his is the net loss the insurance company receives.
 Senator FOND. Subsequent to the war when these corporations went
 back and reestablished their businessess there, were there any tax
 considerations given to these corporations?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Most of these corporations in Germany, for ex-
 ample, were required to pay into a fund in Germany. They have what
 they call an equalization of burdens law in Germany which re-
 quired many of the corporations that made money during the war
 to pay into a fund to pay certain benefits to people who sustained
 losses in Germany that. were not covered by our particular statute.,
 Senator FONG. Do you know whether these companies that reestab-
 lished their businesses were paid by foreign governments?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. I would doubt very seriously that an American
 corporation thit sustained losses would receive any benefits from a
 foreign government. I can't say definitely, but I doubt this very
 seriously because I don't think that the laws that were enacted by the
 ' \rest German Government after -World War II made any provision
 for this type o. thing, and I am sure that some of the representatives
 here, who have corporations that did reestablish operations in Ger-
 many, could answer this.
 Senator Far G. Do you know how we took care of the war claims
 in World War I ?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. It was a mixed claims commission that was estab-
 lished. It was a German-American mixed claims commission. My
 Commission of course, wasn't even in existence then.
 The German Government did make payments, but I am not sure
 exactly what the payment priorities were. As a matter of fact, some
 payments are still being made by the Treasury Department on some
 of these awards that were granted by the mixed claims commission.
 I am not sure whether there was any priority established on this.
 Senator FONG. And you say that the War Claims Commission is
 against. this am endment by the House?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, we, are opposed to it. We just don't feel that
 the precedent is good. We feel that the small claimants, or the so-
 called needy claimants have already been taken care of, and we feel
 that this is discriminatory toward the American corporations. We
 feel that at this point in the payment procedure all the very needy
 people have already been paid.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : &'IAA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 I don't think there are any welfare cases at this point of time.
 Most of these individuals were large claimants. And if you look at the
 unpaid balances on the charts that appear in the House hearing
 record that the Commission submitted, many of these unpaid balances
 are well in excess of $1 million. I don't call this a very small claim.
 Senator FONG. Does the War Claims Commission feel that the law
 should be left alone?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. We think it should be left exactly the way it is
 now.
 Senator FONG. Do you think that is fair?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. We think it is fair. We think that the Congress
 has already expanded the priorities which would take care of the so-
 called needy cases and the small claimants.
 Senator FoNG. In the case of the corporations you said that if they
 had a claim of $200,000, they were paid initially $10,000?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. $10,000.
 Senator FONG. Was that increased to $35,000 afterward?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. No. What happened is they got the $10,000 and
 then they got 61.3 percent of the amount in excess of $10,000, the un-
 paid balance, and then they got an additional $11,000.
 Senator FONG. Oh, they get an additional $11,000?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator FONG. And that $11,000 came from what?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. A deposit that was made in the war claims fund
 around 1970 or 1971 or 1972.
 Senator FONG. So a claimant who had $200,000 in a claim would get
 $10,000?,
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator FONG. And then he would get how much of the balance, of
 the $190,000 ?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Well the second payment he got was 61.3 percent
 of $190,000 and then he got a third payment of $11,000.
 Senator FONG. So he would have gotten about $136,000 already?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes; and you see the pro ration under the present
 law doesn't come into effect until the $35,000 is paid.
 They have to pay across-the-board payments up to $35,000 so there
 wouldn't be any pro ration under the present statute until another
 $24,000 is paid.
 Senator FONG. You mean the $10,000 will be increased then by an-
 other $14,000 ? No, by another $24,000 ?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN, Well this is a question that the lawyers in the
 Treasury Department are going to have to figure out if the statute
 remains the same; that is, whether or not this amount we set at $35,-
 000 means $35,000 in addition to the $10,000 or whether or not it
 means an additional $25,000. The language is not clear.
 Senator FONG. That is not clear.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. It is not clear on that but the Treasury Depart-
 ment lawyers are studying this. I don't think they have reached
 any conclusion as to whether or not they would interpret that to mean
 an additional $35,000-no, an additional $25,000. My personal view
 is that it means an additional $35,000. So this would be the $10,000
 plus the $35,000.

 Senator Foie. So initially you had $10,000 and then from your
 interpretation they would have to have another $35,000.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator BUIDIarc. I. think I have this figured out now. Are you
 through?
 Senator FONG. Yes,
 Senator Brrznrcx. Now as I understand it, in April of 1967 a $10.,000
 payment was made to all claimants?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Well that is not exactly true. In some cases it was
 true.
 Senator BITE-MCI- What cases wouldn't it be true?
 Mr. MCCr.ELLAN. It would depend on when the claim was adjr idi-
 ea,ted by the Commission. You see, we started this program back in
 1963 and between 1964 and 1965 we issued decisions on claims. There
 came a point in time when the Treasury Department fig fired that they
 had enough money in the fund in order to pay at least $10,000 after
 they had paid the priority payments of death, personal injury, and
 small business claims. And when they had enough money in the pro-
 .-ram and we had progressed into the program to the extent that they
 felt they could safely pay $1.0,000 without depleting the fund, then
 they started making the initial payments on these claims.
 For example, somebody brought up the Shanghai Power claim this
 morning. It just happened that in April of 1967 a $10,000 payment
 was made on that particular claim and----
 Senator BIILDTCIi. My point is sometime the $10,000 was paid?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator BliuDICK- Let me give you an example here. Let us take a
 rnan with a $100.000 claim. He got $10,000; correct?
 "MIr. MC'CLrLLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator BURDICK. And that reduced it to $90,000. And then he got
 61.3 percent in October of 1067 of the $90,000. And I figured it out.,
 and that would be $5:5,170. Then he got on November 11 of 1971 an-
 (it her $11.000; correct ?
 Mr. MCCLrLL.AN. That is right.
 Senator Buiwicic. Now, if the present law is carried out where he
 gets another $24,000 to make up the balance of the amount, then when
 1 add that up I get 5100,170.
 Mr. MCCLrLL.AN. Well, he wouldn't get more than what the award
 was.
 Senator BURDICK. No.
 M r. MCCL ELLAN. It, would be up to. Let us say he had an unpaid
 balance of $11!,000,, then he would get $12,000.
 Senator Brrr;niax. In that you are right. My point is if the present
 law is carried out, a man with $100,000 in a claim would be paid in
 I'~il] ?
 1/fr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct. That, is assuming we get the money.
 Senator BTTRDTCK.  You say the ]-present law guarantees the balance of
 $4,000 to make that $;15,000 payment, correct?
 M"r. MGCL.LLAN. This is assuming that the funds are put into the
 war claims fund. You see, what has happened is that the only money
 that is currently available to eo into the war claims funds is $5 million.
 You see, the Department of Justice through its Civil Division liqui-
 dates the German assets. They turn over what they call their freed
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 :  A-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 balance to the Commission for deposits to the war claims fund. Now,
 the mechanics is this. Say we can get $5 million to put in the war
 claims fund. The Commission gets a check from the Treasury De-
 partment for $5 million made out to the Foreign Claims Settlement
 Commission. We in turn deposit 10 percent of this to the general fund
 of the Treasury to reimburse the United States for administrative ex-
 penses and the 90 percent is put into the war claims fund. This is how
 the Commission's administration expenses are reimbursed from the
 U.S. Government. Then when this money goes into the fund, the Treas-
 ury Department figures out how much can be paid for each claimant.
 Now, so far as we know, there is only $5 million currently available.
 Now, $15 million more may be available at some future time, but
 nobody can guarantee this because some of these assets are still tied
 up in litigation. They may have to return it to the original owner, you
 see. So when we talk about $20 million, I am just not sure of the exact
 figure.
 Senator BURDICIC.  But you are talking about the mechanics now.
 What I am saying is the law authorizes the payment of $24,000 when
 and if it is available.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Only if it is available.
 Senator BURDICK.   Yes, sir, that is correct. The mechanics of how
 it becomes available have been described, but what I am saying
 Mr. McCLELLAN. Then, if it becomes available, your example is cor-
 rect, Senator.
 Senator FONG. The corporations would get that $24,000, too?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, everybody.
 Senator FONG. So if you don't have enough money, they wouldn't
 get theirs?
 Senator BURDICK. You say they would have to be paid back, too?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Everybody is treated the same way across the board.
 If they have enough money to get another $10,000, then everybody will
 get another $10,000.
 Senator FONG. And if you have enough money to get the $24,000
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Then they would get their $24,000.
 Senator BURDICK. On my example of $100,000, they would be paid in
 full?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator Bunnlcii. That is under the present law?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator BuRnicK. And that would take care of nonprofit organiza-
 tions and everybody else?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Well, nonprofit people have been paid in full
 already.
 Senator BURDICK. Then over and above this are still the 43 claimants
 who under this formula would not be paid in full?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator BURDICK. These are individual claimants. And under your
 recommendation they should share with the corporations the balance
 of the fund ?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator BURDICK. Thank you, I understand your position now.
 Senator FoNG. The 43 individuals, concerning those, what would be
 the lowest claim that would be made for these 43 individuals?

 Approved For Release 2001/08/298 CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Mr. McCLELLAN. I am not sure I have that, but we can figure it out,
 I can furnish it to the. staff person when I get back to my office.
 Senator Fowo. Will you furnish it to the committee?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator FONG}. And this would take care of those individuals above
 a certain claim.?
 Mr. MCCLELS,..AN. Yes, sir. We can get that.
 Senator BURDICK. I have also figured out on my little pad here that
 for one who had a $200,000 claim, under the present law he would have
 received up to this date $165,400 leaving a balance of some $34,600
 and some, which would be paid under a fair distribution, pro rata basis.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Not on a pro rata basis yet. It won't be until you
 net up to $35,000.
 Senator BunDICK. Well, I have the $24,000 in there. I said he would
 have a $34,600 balance and he would share the remaining money with
 everybody else?
 Mr. McCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Senator BuRDICK..And that would bring it up, of course, much
 higher, too?
 Mr. McCI.ELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator BmwieK. So we have it little bit of the picture.
 Mr. McCLELLAN. Of course, we are also interested in the other part
 of this bill that we haven't discussed here this morning.
 Senator BURDICK. Well, let's discuss it.
 Mr. McCLELLAN. And the Senate passed it some time -ago. We are
 getting quite a bit of correspondence from civilian Americans who
 were interned in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict, and of
 course we have told them that this body has passed that legislation,
 but it has been held up. We do have toanswer a lot of correspondence
 on these type of claims, and I would hope that the committee would
 take this into consideration.
 Senator Fort. You are for the first part of the bill that the Senate
 passed?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Oh, yes, sir; that we are in favor of.
 Senator Bunnicx. I understand there isn't much objection to that
 either?
 Mr. McCLELLAN. No, I don't think anybody could object to that.
 Senator BURDICK. The staff has a, couple of questions.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Mr. McClellan, on the last point you mentioned, this
 bill as it originally passed the Senate over a year ago provided that
 civilian internees' compensation for the period of their internment
 in Southeast Asia would be increased from $60 a month to $150 a
 month. Is that the part you refer to ?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, Sir.
 Mr. WESTiIiAL. Now, that payment to them, whether it is $60 or
 $150, would be made out of this same war claims fund that we are
 talking about. "Correct?
 Mr. MCCLELL;AN. No, sir; that isn't correct.
 Mr. WESTPIIAL. What fund are those payments to civilian internees
 front?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Those. are appropriated funds. You see, the -war
 claims are being paid out of the -war claims fund which is separate.
 We have two funds, in effect. We have two different funds within the
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : t7IA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 Treasury Department. The claims covered by the House amendment
 are paid from liquidated assets, but the claims for the civilian internees
 in Southeast Asia are paid from moneys appropriated from Congress
 from taxpayer funds.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. All right. Now then, on the matter of the claims
 that are covered by these two House amendments to the Senate bill
 and thus to clear this 'thing up, this arises under the original War
 Claims Act of 1948, does it not?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And without being technical, briefly what is in-
 volved here is that when that was first passed, it provided u means of
 liquidating these belligerent assets that were in this country, and the
 job of liquidating of 'those assets was turned over to the Justice
 Department.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And from 1948 when that law was passed and for
 the next 12 or 14 years, the Justice Department was engaged in liqui-
 dating a large number of those assets, were they not?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. During that period of time, was the Commission, of
 which you are counsel, in existence? Was the War Claims Commission
 in existence?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. We, the Commission, came into existence in-well,
 we were officially organized in 1949.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. All right. Now, then, by 1962 the Justice Depart-
 ment liquidiated enough claims and turned the money over to the Treas-
 ury Department, earmarked for this war claims fund, so that there
 were some funds available for distribution?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct, Sir.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And in the original provisions of the law, Congress
 did state some priorities, did they not?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, they did.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. They first created a priority to pay in full all claims
 for death or personal injury arising out of belligerent actions?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And the second priority that Congress created was a
 priority for all small business claims?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes; that is right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And as the Chairman's opening statement indicated,
 some 251 small business claims in the total amount of $12 million were
 paid?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And a third priority that Congress created in the
 history of this war claims legislation was a priority to pay all claims
 under $10,000; to pay them in full?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir; that is correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Whether these were corporate claims or individual
 claims, but still to pay them in full?
 Mr. McCLELLAN. It didn't make a bit of difference.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. If the claim was under $10,000, then it was paid in
 full and some 5,630 of those claims were paid in full at a cost of some
 $13 million?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/2918 CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now then, in 1962 there were still about 1,000 claims
 left that involved essentially property loss. These were claims made by
 corporate insurance companies, corporations, and by individuals anti
 by individuals representing their ownership in a so-called family cor-
 poration that was used as a guise to hide assets that otherwise the
 Nazis would have confiscated?
 Mr. MCCLFI.LAN. Yes, sir. The exception to this is, as you say, 11 - 962.
 Well, the 1962, act was the statute that provided for the death and
 personal injury as well as the small business and
 Mr. WESTPHHAL. Yea; but what I am saying is that Congress origi-
 nally started out and created three priorities.
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. That is correct.
 Mr. WFBTYrrAL. All right. And those priorities were for the death.
 and personal claims, small businesses, and all claims under $10,000,
 whether filed by corporations or by individuals?
 Mr. Mc CLFLLAN. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPr3AL. And then in 1962 Congrss passed an amndment
 which said that every claimant., both corporate and individual, shoulcl
 get $10,000 paid on the claims?
 Mr. McCLEra,AN. The chronology here is not exactly right. In Oc-
 tober of 1962 Congress passed title 2 of the War Claims Act. You. see,
 Public Law 87-846 was enacted on October 22 of 1962. This is the
 statute that authorized the death and personal injury claims and. the
 small business claims or any war damage claims that arose during
 World War 11 in certain areas of Europe and the Pacific.
 Now, that statute had a section which set forth the priorities that
 you have just, enumerated. Now, this is the way the statute stayed until.
 ;zr'o,ind 1.971, f believe, which was when the Congress changed the
 payment provision and they authorized another priority, and this was
 the priority that said that charitable, religious, and other groups shall
 be paid in full. They had already received initial payments, so they
 got the unpaid balances of that money at that date. This is when
 the Justice De-oartment turned over approximately $13 million, which
 was put into the fund, and that money enabled the Treasury De-
 partment to wipe the books clean so far as the charitable groups were
 concerned and allowed them to pay the $11,000 in 1972 that we talked
 about a little earlier.
 Mr. WF,sTPFCAL. All right. So basicallly, what has happened in the
 history of this payment on claims under the War Claims Act of 1948
 is that when funds were available for payout, Congress created certain
 priorities. The first priority they created was the payment in full of
 all claims for death or personal injury. The second priority they ere-
 a.ted was the payment in full of all claims by small business. The third
 priority they created was the payment of all claims under $10,000 in
 full. The fourth priority they created was the payments of all claims
 by religious, charitable, and nonprofit corporations. Those claims were
 paid off?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPH-AL. So then-and I am referring now to a table that
 was published in the House report on this bill on page 5-so that
 again what we had was a total of 886 individual claims, 199 corporate
 claims, and 1 claim apparently by the United States. Now, in regard
 to those claims, what Congress authorized was the payment of $10,000
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 29
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 on each of those claims plus 61.3 percent of the amount of the award
 to each and every one of those claimants, whether corporate, individ-
 ual, insurance, or whatever?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now, then in the 1970 amendments, what Congress
 authorized was a total payment of $35,000, or rather up to $35,000
 on each and every claim remaining unpaid after these prior payments
 that I have referred to; isn't that true?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, Sir.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And some time after that 1970 amendment, the Com-
 mission paid '$11,000 of that $35,000 congressional authorization
 correct?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And as the law now stands, there remains to be paid
 $24,000 of that $35,000 previously authorized by the Congress.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now you have suggested that there may be some
 question as to whether there is $24,000 remaining to be paid, or only
 $14,000 to be paid, but in any event, the hearings in the House and
 the House consideration of the bill and in fact, the position taken by
 all the claimants is that the prior $10,000 payment is not a deduction
 from the $35,000 and only the $11,000 payment is a deduction from it,
 and there remains to be paid $24,000?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is my interpretation.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. All right.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. But the Treasury Department lawyers will have to
 make this interpretation. Maybe this is good to have this on record
 now and to let them know what your feeling is on this because there is
 some disagreement on it.
 Senator BURDICK. Is there some question about this?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. I think there is some question.
 Senator BURDICK. Well, we better fix the question.
 Senator FONG. The question is on whether the $24,000 is to be paid
 or the $35,000 is to be paid?
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Or whether the $24,000 is to be paid or $14,000 is to
 be paid.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. There is some question as to whether or not when
 the $35,000 figure was put in by the Congress, whether this meant
 an additional $35,000 or whether this meant an additional $25,000,
 to the $10,000. So if you add the additional $10,000 and then $25,-
 000 and then $35,000, there is some question as to
 Senator BURDICK. Well, we would like to have an opinion by your
 counsel because this makes a difference on how we act.
 We would like to have, a firm opinion from you.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Well, I will submit it to you on this. I will have
 to ask
 Senator BURDICK. Because I have been going on the assumption
 there is another $24,000 to be paid to everybody. I am assuming that.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Well, this is the question we ought to clarify,
 and our position is that you are correct that there is another $24,-
 000. Now, there is some question within the Treasury Department,
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/2da CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 I believe. I have talked to some of the lawyers over there as to how
 they view this, and there is some question,.
 I gave them my opinion. At the time it wasn't in writing, but I
 would. be glad to put it into writing for this subcommittee as to what
 this means.
 Senator FoNG. So the question will be whether another $14,000 is
 clue?
 Senator BURDICK. No. Another $24,000.
 Senator FoNG. Oh, another $24.,000? Is that the question?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. Yes.
 Senator FoN'G. And your position is another $24,000 is due?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Another $24,000, yes, sir; that is correct.
 Senator FOND. That is you are giving them the full benefit of the
 4-3r
 ,000?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. Right.
 Senator FoNco. With no deduction?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. With no deductions, yes, sir. That is correct.
 Mr. WESTIurAL. So that from where we stand today or where; we
 stand now or where we stood at the time the House made this amend-
 Inent to the bill, it is that after these other payments and priorities
 and everything that we previously discussed today, there remains 187
 individual claims which are unpaid to the extent of approximately
 .,x'6.5 million?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir, that is correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And there are 161 corporate claims that are unpaid
 in the amount of $94.7 million?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Mr. WFSTPHAL. So that there is a total of $101.2 million of claims
 that are presently unsatisfied?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. That is correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And again, the assumption made in the House pro-
 reedings is that there would be approximately $20 million yet to be-
 come available under this War Claims Act system of payments. That
 would be approximately the maximum?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. We feel that that would be the maximum.
 Mr. WFSTPEAL. All right.
 Now, then, what the House did was, Looking in anticipation of $20
 million becoming available, they then legislated yet another priority
 to apply to the $20 million that is anticipated. Is that correct?
 Mr. MC,CLFaa,AN. I would have to assume that this is what they did.
 Sir.
 Mr. '"TFSTPIIAL. Well, they did. They gave a priority to individual
 claims to pay them in full, did they not?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPHCAL. All right. Now, then, as to what is the status of the
 187 individual claims and the 160 and some corporate claims the com-
 mittee has received and incorporated into the record by reference to
 the House hearing report on this legislation, on pages 32 through 37
 of that report are tables that list each and every one of these 187 indi-
 vidual claims and each and every one of the 161 corporate claims. Is
 that not true?
 Mr. MCCLFLLAN. Yes, sir.
 Mr. WFSTPI[AL. All right, now. Those tables show four categories of
 claims remaining; there are corporate insurance claims, which as
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : UA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 shown by the summary on page 33 total $15 million to begin with, and
 they have already received $9.9 million, which is approximately on
 the average 65.1 percent of the face of the claim, and there is,an unpaid
 balance of $5.2 million. Is that correct?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. All right. Now, then, if you look at the individual
 claims within that category, for example, Guarantee Insurance Co. has
 received 98.9 percent of its original award, and no insurance company
 has received less than 61.3 percent of its original award. Isn't that true?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir, it is.
 Mr. WESTPIiAL. Excuse me, 61.1 as shown in the table.
 Mr. McCLELLAN. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now, then, for corporate and partnership and such
 claims, generally there was a total amount awarded to that category
 of $230.9 million in awards made by your Commission of which $141.5
 million has already been paid, and those corporate claims generally
 have been paid on the average of 60 percent of their claim, leaving
 them a balance of $89 million yet to be paid or actually, 89.4. So that
 between the corporate insurance and the corporate general claims,
 they add up to the $94.6 million or the $94.7 million that is still unpaid
 insofar as corporate claims are concerned?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now, continuing on by reference to this House re-
 port, they then list three categories of claims that are treated as in-
 dividual claims. One is labeled "Corporate and Partnership Individual
 Claims"; this again being generally regarded as situations where
 claims resulted from the fact that a family in Germany formed a cor-
 poration in order to keep their property from being confiscated had the
 individual been learned. That is generally the type of situation, is it
 not ?
 Mr. McCLELLAN. I would assume that some of these claims would
 involve that situation. I can't say that all of them do, but some.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. All right. But in any event, they fell into one of the
 categories by statute which you were authorized to treat as a claim?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now, those claims total $7.3 million, of which $5.1
 million has already been paid or an average of 70.6 percent, leaving
 $2.1 million still unpaid? Then you have a category of individual
 claims which originally totaled $7.2 million, of which they have re-
 ceived $5.5 million, for an average of 76.3 percent of the award being
 paid. There remains $1.7 million yet to be paid, correct?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Then you have a mixed claims category, which
 again is an individual classification, and they totaled originally $8.9
 million. They have already been paid $6.2 million. The average per-
 cent there is 69.8 percent of awards being paid; they have an unpaid
 balance of $2.7 million. Correct?
 Senator FONC. On that point, on the mixed claims, may I ask about
 the three claims here almost at the end of the schedule?
 Mr. McCLELLAN. Yes, sir, I see those.
 Senator FONG. Eric Warburg, Gisela Wyanski, and Anita Warburg.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir ; I see.

 Senator FONG. The award to Eric Warburg was $389,863.23 and
 the same amount for the other two. One has been paid $372,152.05 and
 another has been paid $381,007.64 and another has been paid the same
 amount. So in one case, 95.5 percent had been paid, and in the other
 two cases, 97.7 percent had been paid. How were they paid so much
 in relation to the others?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. The only explanation that I can give for this is
 that I would have to go back and look at the decision on this.
 There is a possibility that some portion of the award may have
 been paid as small business. You see what happened is that we had
 some claims that were based on individually owned property and we
 also had corporate owned property. Now the corporate owned property
 may have qualified as a small. business concern, and it may have been
 paid in full on that particular part of the award, and the pro ration
 on the other part comes in on the individually owned property as
 opposed to the small business award. I know that there are some
 individual cla-.mants here who would fit that example that I gave,
 but anyway, o:a these three, I just don't know unless f looked at the
 files on those. I would be glad to do so.
 Senator ForrG. There is a claim here of almost $400,000, and they
 got about 97 percent of their claim already paid.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. That is correct. It took a lot of work to get these
 charts together, and we have a very small staff. We devoted a lot of
 time to do this. We thought that the Congress ought to have the figures
 so that they would know exactly what each person is getting and the
 types of claims that we are talking about. I mean, you can talk about
 individual claims, which may be completely different, than a corpora-
 tion claim, or where a person is operating a two-man partnership.
 I mean, you could have a situation where they had a small apartment
 house that they used to make income off of as opposed to a big corpora-
 tion. This is different *rom some of these claims, where you had family
 owned businesses which were really not small businesses at all. They
 were very big businesses, and they have interest in these corporations
 or they inherited interest in these corporations in Germany or Europe
 or wherever the damage has occurred, and they are not really small.
 This is why we feel that it is important that these statistics be studied
 because this indicates that what we are talking about now at this point
 in the payment stage are really people who have received substantial
 payments on t:ieir awards. And nobody ever can really be made whole
 iii legislation like this. It was never intended for it. Congress knew
 when they initially passed this legislation that everybody wouldn't
 he made whole. This is an effort to alleviate some of the losses that
 American citizens sustained as a result of World War IT.
 Senator BuiwicK. You said that small corporations were paid out?
 Mr. MCCLE'LLAN. Yes, sir.
 Senator BURDICK. What is your definition of small? What is your
 definition of a small business?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. We didn't get into this. They had to qualify under
 the Small Business Act. There was a question on our claim form
 which asked whether or not they qualified as a small business concern.
 If they said yes. we sent a questionnaire to the Small Business Admin-
 istration and they made that determination based on the provisions
 of the Small Business Act. They communicated with the claimants

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : 8TA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 and they secured the information as to the number of employees and
 things like this, and their income. I am sure that this was the basis on
 which the Small Business Administration made the determination
 and they would certify to the figures that John Doe is a small business
 concern, and so on.
 Senator BURDICK. He may have a claim of $300,000 or $400,000 or
 $500,000, though?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Oh, sure.
 Senator BURDICK. And they were paid in full?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. Yes, Sir.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. I have just two more points I would like to clarify,
 Mr. Chairman.
 As I read the House report and their amendment, they set forth
 basically as the basis for their amendment, which would give a pref-
 erence to individuals as compared to corporations, the fact that under
 the law, corporations got tax benefits and tax exemptions, which no
 individual got. Now, in our conversation on Monday after you returned
 to Washington, I asked you whether the Commission could furnish
 us with a list of those corporations which took a tax loss and reported
 that tax loss to you so that this committee might know which of those
 161 remaining corporate claimants took a tax loss which you deducted
 from their award, and then which in turn were granted a tax exemption
 on any payments made by the Commission under this War Claims Act.
 Now, would you explain to the committee what your capacity is to
 furnish the committee with a list itemizing which of the corporations
 took the tax loss, and how much of it they took?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. We can furnish that information to the committee.
 We don't have it today, but we can furnish it. Our files are retired to
 the Federal Records Center out in Maryland. It takes some time to
 get some of these files back. We will furnish this information to the
 committee.
 I think a study has been made by some of the witnesses that may
 appear here today as to how many of these corporations did that.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Well, one of the witnesses has attached to his pre-
 pared statement that he is to submit to the committee a list of corpora-
 tions and the amount of the tax loss which they claimed, but until
 we hear from that witness, we don't know what source compiled that
 list, or whether it is accurate.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. They probably got it from our own agency. We
 have been very cooperative to both sides on this issue. We made what
 records we could available to them.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Let me ask you, how long do you think it would
 take to do this?
 Mr. MCCLELLAN.' I think you could do it in a couple of days.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest the witness be re-
 quired to furnish that to the committee as soon as possible.
 Mr. MCCLELLAN. I would be glad to.
 Senator BURDICK. Fine, and that will be placed in the record.

 [Editor's Note : The following is the response of Mr. McClellan to
 the tax information request of the subcommittee:]

 Chairman, Ad floe Subcommittee, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: At the hearing on the bill, S. 1728, held December 3,
 1.974, you requested that the Commission furnish information concerning the
 tax benefits der:.ved by corporations having unpaid balances on awards granted
 cinder Title II of the War Claims Act of 194*, as amended. Enclosed is a list or
 the corporations with the tax benefits derived, if any, on account of the losses that
 were the subject matter of the claims. This list generally corresponds to the list:
 that appears on pages 32-34 of the transcript: of the hearing held on November
 7, 1973, by the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on
 Interstate and Foreign Commerce. House of Representatives.
 I would like 1:0 clarify my response to certain questions relative to whether
 the tax benefits deducted from awards by the Commission included state or
 foreign tax benefits that. may have been derived by these corporations. tinder
 Section 206(b) of the War Claims Act of 1948 (50 U.S.C. App. 2017e, the Coramis-
 ;ion was required to deduct from these corporate awards the Federal tax bene-
 fits. State or foreign tax benefits were not considered. It should also be noted
 that this statute did not require the deduction of any tax benefit that individuals
 may have received. Thus, our claim forms were not designed to obtain this
 information.
 During the course of the hearing, the issue arose regarding whether paragraph
 3, which was added to Section 213(a) of the War Claims Act by Public Law
 91-571, approved December 24, 1970, required that the $10,000 payment author-
 ized in paragraph 2 be counted when computing the $35,000 ceiling set forth
 in the said paragraph. While there is testimony on the bills, H.R. 2669 and S. 941,
 the proposals which became Public Law 91-571 to the effect that the $10,000
 should be counted to reach the $35,000 ceiling, the Senate report (S. Rept. No.
 91-1375) on H.R. 2669, makes it clear that the new $35,000 ceiling on payments
 in paragraph 3 was in addition to the $10,000 referred to in paragraph 2.
 Therefore, the Commission Is in full agreement with the view on this issue
 t xpressed by the Chairman at the hearing.
 The  Commissi.on is pleased to furnish this information.
 Very truly yours,
 WAYLAND D. MCCLELLAN,
 General Counsel.

 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, we are grateful for this
 opportunity to express the objections of CPC International, Inc., to enactment
 of the House amendments to S. 1728. My name is Charles S. Mack, Director of
 Public and Government Affairs for CPC. With me are Harold Plimpton, Jr., Vice

 S.  1728 AND ROUSE AMENDMENTS
 As originally proposed, S. 1728 sought to amend Section 5 of the War Claims
 Act for the purpose of increasing the detention benefits of civilian internees of
 the Southeast Asia conflict. This is meritorious legislation and it is unfortunate
 that it has been clouded by two irrelevant and highly controversial amendments.
 The House amendments address themselves not to internee benefits, but rather
 to establishing new priorities for payments from the War Claims Fund. The first
 Mouse amendment grants priority of payment to all individual awardees,, before
 .any distribution to corporate claimants. The second House amendment proposes
 that each corporate awardee receive.an award in equal amounts up to $50,000
 Or the. amount of the award, whichever is less.
 BASIS OF CPC's CLAIM
 CPC International-then Corn Products Refining Company-was one of the
 first U. S. Corporations to invest in productive facilities abroad. By the time
 of World War II, CPC had large interests in Europe and the Far East, principally
 in food manufacturing plants. By the end of the War, however, virtually all of
 .CPC's properties in Germany, Czechoslovakia, and the Far East, had been expro-
 .eriated or otherwise lost, Included in this loss was a corn milling plant in Barby,
 Germany which was at the time, the largest food processing plant in Central
 Europe. The Barby plant was one of a number dismantled and shipped to the
 'Soviet Union, with the consent of the United States Government, under the
 Potsdam Agreement.
 under the War Claims Act, CPC was able to claim a portion of these losses.
 WV,e received a gross award from the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of
 some $26 million, for a net award of approximately $22 million. Of this sum,
 some $14 million has been recovered, leaving about $8 million of proven losses
 for which CPC has not yet been compensated. It is this substantial unpaid
 balance which is the basis of CPC's vital concern,with, the proposed amendments.
 It should be emphasized at this point that no Federal appropriations have
 ever been involved in these payments. The source of payments derive entirely
 from German and Japanese assets seized by the United States during World
 War II.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29,CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 L OBJECTIONS To INDIVIDUAL PRIORITY AMENDMENT
 a. The individual amendments will benefit only 43 Individuals, with nine
 of the individuals getting the lion's share.
 The present law requires that each ind Ividual and corporate awardee be
 granted all additional $24,000 (or the amount of their award whichever is less)
 from any additional monies which become available to the War Crimes Funi,
 before pro rata distribution begins. It. Is significant then, that under the present
 law, 146 of the 1819 individual claimants will to fully compensated for the a:mourct
 of their awards.--without any further action by the Congress. In other words.
 only 43 individuals stand to benefit by enactment of this amendment.
 b. These 43 individuals have already received substantial amounts from prior
 war claims distributions (see Exhibit).
 It is interesting to note that of these 43 awardees, 31 have already been paid
 ai. least ." ICl0,i10"J each. And under present law (which grants an additional $29,-
 000 to each) 42 of the 43 awardees will eventually receive over $100,0003--
 without any change in the law. Furthermore, enactment of the individual priority
 a mcndnent will result in these same 43 individuals getting 83% of all payments
 to individuals. (That is. these 43 will receive some $5.5 million of the approsi-
 tinately $t;.5 million which would be distributed to individuals under the amend-
 uient.) Even more disturbing is the fact that: of these select 43 individuals who
 would benefit by a change in the law, it. mere nine will receive nearly two-thirds of
 the funds distributed to individuals.  (These 9 individuals will receive as
 million of the $5.5 million awarded to the 43.)
 CI'C seriously questions whether the Senate will want to enact legislation whic-a
 lienefits principally such a handful of individuals-particularly, since previous
 legislation has long since satisfied proven hardship cases, including death and
 injury, small businesses, and charitable, religious, and non-profit organizations.
 e. CI'C believes that enactment of the amen(T:nent will establish an unjustifiable
 precedent.
 The situation before us Is akin to a. bankruptcy proceeding, in that there are
 insufficient funds available to satisfy all claimants. We see no reason to break
 front the long standing law or pro rata distribution, particularly when most of
 the individuals seeking priority of payment would have difficulty establishing
 I liemselves as "hardship" cases.
 41. It is wrong to enact preferential rights for individuals because of alleged tai:
 benefits received by some corporations.
 Some individual claimants argue that an injustice exists since corporations
 received tax deductions for their war losses while individuals did not. Therefore,
 they argue, this injustice should be remedied by giving individual claimants ?a
 priority to the monies available in the War Claims Fund.
 We refute this argument as nonsense. Some corporations did not get any tax
 deductions for their losses. And while other corporations, like ourselves, did
 .btain tax benefits, these benefits were deducted from the awards granted by the
 Commission. In other words, all present corporate awards are net of tax benefits,
 ^fhere has been no double benefit as Implied by individual claimants.
 II. OBJECTIONS TO AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD GRANT UP TO $50,000 TO EACH
 CORPORATE CLAIMANT
 (tPC holds that the second amendment, which proposes that each corporate
 a vardee receive equal payments of up to $50.000 or the amount of their award,
 has even less validity than. the Individual priority amendment.
 In its report,-,he House Committee reasoned that "equitable considerations"
 led the Committee members to adopt the amendment. However, the Committee
 report did not explain "equitable considerations" and. therefore, we can only
 guess at why the Committee felt It necessary to give preference to small awar-lees.
 We suppose that the House Committee must have reasoned : "The smaller the
 award, the smaller the company. Therefore, to help the small businessman., we
 will give him preference on his claims."
 1 close examination of the facts, however, Indicates that this reasoning Is fal-
 lacious, and. in fact, should the amendment pass, the effect would be to create
 mn inequitable situation.
 ' On. awardee, Itlrlch Strauss, is a double awardee-having been granted an "[ndi-
 'i,lial" award and a "Mixed" award. For the purpose of this data, each award Is treated
 cparately.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29
 Specifically, we object to this amendment on the following grounds :
 a. Those Claimants Qualifying as Small Businessmen Have Already Received
 Compensation for the Full Amount of Their Award.
 It is important to remember that previous War Claims legislation enacted in
 1962, has already made provisions for small business claimants. Those claim-
 ants qualifying as small businessmen were granted a priority, and, therefore,
 have been fully compensated for the amount of their claim. This fact refutes the
 reasoning that this amendment will benefit the "small businessmen."
 b. CPC Objects to This Amendment Because it is Erroneous to Believe that
 "Small Claims" Means Small Corporations.
 On the contrary, some of the smaller claims outstanding are held by such
 corporate giants as Westinghouse, Borg-Warner, S. S. Kresge, and Studebaker-
 Worthington. Some of the claimants who will benefit the most by passage of the
 amendment are not small corporations, but are very large.
 c. Enactment of the Amendment Will Have the Effect of Reverse Pro Rata
 Distribution.
 This amendment favors the small corporate awardee, at the expense of the-
 large awardee. Those corporations who have $50,000 or less will receive full
 compensation for their award, while large awardees will have the amount avail-
 able for pro rata distribution reduced by the amount awarded to the small
 claimants. Traditionally, when claimants face a situation in which insufficient
 amounts are available to satisfy all claims, the amount available is awarded on,
 a pro rata basis. Under the proposed amendment, this approach would be over--
 thrown. The inherent unfairness of the amendment is best summarized by Con-
 gressman Kuykendall's remarks in his supplemental views to the House report..
 He said : "Such a scheme cannot commend itself as good law or simple justice..
 It must be based on the premise that the more one lost, the less entitled lie is to
 reimbursement."
 d. This Amendment Discriminates in Favor of Insurance Claimants Over
 Manufacturing Claimants.
 Total corporate awards  (combining insurance and manufacturing 'corpora-
 tions) amount to approximately $94.7 million. Of this, approximately $5.3 mil-
 lion, or 6%0, constitutes awards to insurance companies. The remainder, approxi-
 materly $89.4 million, or 94%, is attributable to manufacturing corporate claims.
 however, if the amendment is passed, insurance companies will receive about
 20% of the benefits assuming $10 million remains for distribution. It is difficult, in
 view of these statistics, to discern how "equitable considerations" will be servedi
 when insurance companies will get disproportionate relief.
 Both of these amendments are inequitable and ill-founded. The first amendment
 would benefit only a handful of individuals, while the second amendment pro-
 vides discriminatory relief to those who have lost the least, over those who have
 lost the most.
 Moreover, CPC asks that the continued legislative crippling of our claims.should'
 stop. The War Claims Act has already established a string of precedents for pri=ority of payouts; first death and personal injury claims were given priority,-
 then small businesses ; later, religious, charitable, and non-profit organizations
 and finally, in effect, all other small claimants up to $35,000.
 Whether some or all of these priorities have some merit is not the point, what
 is important is that the legislation now before you is not unique, but rather the
 latest in a succession of actions which have steadily undermined the ability of
 companies such as ours to obtain our rightful share of the limited funds available
 for recompense of our losses-losses which we suffered in the first place with
 the tacit consent of the U.S. Government.
 In light of these factors, CPC International urges that the subcommittee rec-
 ommend against both the House Amendments.
 This list gives the names of the 43 individuals who would benefit by enactment
 of the individual priority amendment-the amounts they have received' to date-
 and the minimum amount they will eventually receive if no change is made in,the
 present law.2

 11Ir. M.a(lx. Thank You. CI'C International. as Mr. Plimpton said,
 was then known as Corn Products Refining Co., and was one of the
 first U.S. corporations to invest in productive facilities abroad. In fact.
 1'119 was the year in which we opened our first overseas plant. By the        =
 time of World 1Var TT, CPC had large interests in Europe and the Far
 East, principally- in food mannfa.cturing plants. By the end of the war.
 however, virtually all of CPC's properties in Cxermanv, Czechoslo-
 vakia, and. the Far East, had been expropriated or otherwise lost.
 Included in this lose was a corn milling plant in Barbv, Germany,
 v-hich was at the time the largest food-producing plant in central
 Europe. The FEarhv plant was one of a number of plants ,physically
 dismantled and shipped back to the Soviet Union, with the consent of
 the U.S. Government. under the Potsdam agreement.
 Under the War Claims Act CPC was able to claim part of these
 losses for a. net worth of approximately- $22 million and of which some
 $14 million has been recovered, leaving about $8 million in proven losses

 for which we have not yet been compensated. It is this very substantial
 unpaid balance which is the basis of our vital concern about the pro-
 posed amendments.
 Air. Clute addressed himself very eloquently and very knowledge-
 ably to the objections which we would certainly share, too, in enactment
 of the individual preference amendment, and I would simply highlight
 a couple of those before moving on and discussing the second amend-
 ment in a little greater detail.
 We would note with reference to the preference amendment that it
 will benefit only 43 individuals with 9 of those individuals getting the
 lion's share; that is, some two-thirds in fact of the benefits which would
 accrue to the individuals under this legislation. If the amendment is
 enacted, the amount that would be received by nine individuals and
 the details on that can be found in the appendix exhibit to our
 statement.
 Second, these 43 individuals have already received substantial
 amounts from prior war claims distributions and, indeed, without any
 change in the law all but one will eventually receive over $100,000.
 Mr. Chairman, we certainly question whether the Senate at this time
 of national economic crises will really want to spend its time and
 really want to spend the Nation's resources in enacting legislation
 which benefits principally such a handful of individuals, particularly
 since it has been noted that previous legislation has long since satisfied
 proven hardship cases including death and injury, small business,
 and charitable and religious organizations.
 We concur too that the statement that enactment of the preference
 amendment will establish an unjustifiable and perhaps a dangerous
 legal precedent., and we think it is wrong to enact preference for in-
 dividuals because of alleged tax benefits received by some corporations.
 Mr. Chairman, there is no double benefits. In our case our award
 was net of tax benefits.
 Now let me move on if I may, Mr. Chairman, and spend a moment
 or two on the second amendment, which would grant up to $50,000 to
 each corporate claimant.
 CPC holds that the second amendment, which proposes that each
 corporate awardee receive equal payments of up to $50.000 or the
 amount of their award, has even less validity than the ' individual
 priority amendment.
 In fact, Air. Chairman, it is a mystery amendment. Nobody is really
 sure who is for this and nobody has come before this subcommittee
 to speak for it and it suggests a mystery as to why it was even put into
 the law.
 The House report talked about "equitable considerations" which led
 committee members to adopt the amendment, but the report does not
 state what those equitable considerations are. In fact, I was present at
 the meeting of the full House committee when this was added to the
 bill and there was hardly any discussion of what "equitable consider-
 ations" were, so we can only speculate that the committee must have
 somehow felt it necessary to give preference to small awardees on the
 reasoning that the smaller the award, the smaller the company and
 therefore it helped the small businessman.
 A close examination on the facts, indicate this reasoning is fallacious,
 and, in fact, should the amendment pass, we believe the effect will
 be to create an inequitable situation.

 Our specific, objections are these :
 First of all, those claimants qualifying as small businessmen have
 already received compensation for the full amount of their award.
 This was done in the legislation enacted in 1962. It fully compensated
 them, and therefore those who are small businessmen have been taken
 care of and so we will not address ourselves to them.
 Second fallacy we believe is that small! claims do not denote small
 corporations. On the contrary, some of the smaller claims outstanding
 are held by companies such as Westinghouse, Borg-Warner, S. S.
 Kresge, and Stadebaker-Worthington. These are distinguished cor-
 porations, but they pare very large corporations.
 The third point is that enactment of the amendment will have the
 effect of reverse pro rata distribution. This amendment, favors the
 small corporate awardee, who has, as I just said, not necessarily been
 a small company and he gets awarded at the expense. of the large
 aw.ardee. Those corporations who have $50,000 or less outstanding will
 receive full compensation for their awards, while large awardees will
 have the amount available for pro rata distribution reduced by the
 amount awardec to the small claimants.
 'traditionally, when claimants face a situation in which insufficient
 amounts are available to satisfy all claims, the amount available is
 awarded on a pro rata basis. Under the proposed amendment, this
 approach would be overthrown. The inherent unfairness of the amend-
 ment is best summarized by Congressman Kuykendall's remarks in
 his supplemental views to the House report. He said-
 such a scheme cannot commend itself as good law or simple justice. It must
 be based on the premise that the moire one lost, the less entitled he is to
 reimbursement.
 Fourth, this amendment discriminates in favor of insurance claim-
 ants over mairafacturng claimants and other companies. Total
 corporate awards, that is combining insurance and manufacturing;
 corporations, amount to approximately $94.7 million. Of this, approx-
 imately $5.3 million, or 6 percent, constitutes awards to insurance
 companies. The remainder, approximately $80.4 million, or 94 percent,
 is attributable to manufacturing corporate claims. However, if the
 amendment is passed, insurance companies will receive about 20 percent
 of the benefits assuming $1.0 million remains for distribution. It is
 very difficult to discern how "equitable considerations" will be served
 when insurance companies will get disproportionate relief.
 I would add that this morning Congressman Eckhardt sitting in this.
 chair noted that insurance companies were paid to take risks. I would
 ask if indeed the House committee felt that way, then I, for one, am
 at a complete loss why they would want to give these insurance com-
 panies a special break, which the McCollister amendment would
 indeed do.
 Both of these amendments are inequitable and ill-founded. The first
 amendment would benefit only a Handful of individuals, while the
 second amendment provides discrirninator ;y relief to those who have
 lost. the least, over those who have lost the most.
 Perhaps most important though, Mr. Chairman, is that CPC asks,
 that the continued legislative crippling of our claims should stop.
 The War Claims Aet has already established a string of precedents.

 for priority of payouts; first death and personal injury claims were
 given priority; then small businesses; later, religious, charitable, and
 nonprofit organizations; and finally, in effect, all other small claimants
 up to $35,000.
 Whether some or all of these priorities have some merit is not the

 committee recommend against both the House amendments.
 We thank you for your attention and consideration, Mr. Chairman.
 Senator BURDICK. Thank you very much for your contribution to-
 day. In this list of claimants I presume you start with the largest
 figure first and then go on down?
 Mr. MACK. Yes, sir.
 Senator BURDICK. You go down as the amount decreases?
 Mr. MACK. Yes.
 Senator BURDICK. You said that individual preferences will benefit
 only 43 individuals with 9 individuals getting the lion's share. Now
 would those nine be the first nine of the list?
 Mr. MACK. Yes they are. They would receive, Mr. Chairman, in
 dollar totals, that is of the $5.6 million total awards $3.6 million would
 go to those nine.
 Senator BURDICK. I understand. I was just wondering if you started
 from the top on down and I presume it would be from the top on down ?
 Mr. MACK. Yes, sir.
 Mr.'vVESTPIIAL.I just have a couple of questions. How many claims
 -does CPC or Corn Products Co., have pending before the War Claims
 Commission?
 Mr. MACK. Three.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And one was in the original awarded amount of
 ;$15.3 million and another one was in the amount of $6.3 million and
 the third one was in the amount of approximately $800,000, is that
 not correct?
 Mr. MACK. I think those are correct. Mr. Conafay has those but, yes,
 sir, that is substantially correct, totaling about $22 million in our net
 award.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Right, now those awards were made to CPC by
 the War Claims Commission after first deducting some $2,353,000 of
 tax benefits which CPC received?
 Mr. MACK. That would be slightly more-I mean, there would be
 slightly more than that. Our gross award was $26 million. The tax
 benefit: was $4 million in round figures.
 Mr. WESTPITAL. The $4 million was the tax benefit in round numbers?
 Mr. MACK. Yes, sir.
 Mr. WESTrrrAL. Now on those three claims you have received as I
 understand it from your statement, approximately $14 million. Is
 that right?
 Mr. MACK. That is right.
 Mr. WESTPIIAL. So out of $26 million worth of property you have
 received in tax benefits plus claims made some $18 million?

 Mr. MACK. That would be correct.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. And the $14 million which you have received by
 virtue of the law has been exempt from all forms of taxation whether
 it is ordinary income or capital gains by virtue of you having reported
 41io tax loss benefit which you received?
 Mr. MACK. I ',weld yield to Mr. C'onafay on that question.
 Mr. CON,yFAY. That is correct.
 Mfr. WESTPI IAL. I have no further questions.
 Mfr. CoXAFAY. I might point out there that I know that some of the
 individual claimants have said that they are not entitled to this tax-
 free income or their awards will be subject to taxation or may be
 sul_hject to taxation, and I will submit a memorandum concerning that
 opinion to the committee.
 Mr. MTES'rPHAL. Would you do so?
 Mr. CONAFAY. Yes, Sir.
 Air. WES'rPrrps,. And again these dollar, values we are talking about
 are dollar values around 1939 or 1941?
 Mr. MACK. Well these assets were overrun at the end of World War
 Il.
 -If-,'. WESTPHAL. All right. And the $4 million worth of tax benefit--
 "(,I[, in other words, you have $4 million in taxes. What returns for
 w hat. vea.rs was the $4 million saved in?,
 Mfr. MAv'"K. 1941.
 .t1r. WWESTPHAL. So the assets were. ,it 1941 valuations and the tax
 dollars you saved were at 1941 valuations and the $4 million in 1941 is
 worth iiiore than $4 mil ion today?
 Mr. MACK. Well I might note that while that is true, Mr. Westphal,
 there is another aspect here which hasn't been discussed. We talked
 about cash flow. Mr. Roever talked about cash flow earlier. The
 entire' }basis; of our award was the physical assets. Most of our manu-
 facturing facilities were in Eastern Europe. This is a gigantic market
 wl.ic}i grew even more in the 3(1 years since and which would have been
 served by the Barby plant. There is no way a dollar figure can be put
 on the market loss which would be attributed to that plant, but that
 would also have been worth vastly more than the $4 million then or
 now.
 Mr. WrSTPIIAL. Did you reestablish any of these plants after World
 War Ii ?
 'Tr'. ATAC K. Not in tha East. We have, plants in the West. We have
 planets gin'\Vest (1-ermany, but none in East Germany.
 1Ir. W'EC'rptrAL.. Tn reestablishing those plants, there has been a con-
 tiituiiig allegation here by some of the individual. proponents of the
 I-Touse amendmeent that. some of those governments made tax conces-
 sions when businesses were reestablished over there. Did you receive
 any sii h tax concessions for the businesses vou. did start?

 that came np and we were just made aware of it today. I will look

 Senator BURntcK. You made an interesting observation that the size
 of the claim didn't necessarily reflect the size of the corporation.
 Mr. MACK... That is right.
 Senator BURDICK. Are there examples in this list of claims where
 the claim, let us say, of a small business corporation is larger than the
 claim of a large business corporation?
 Mr. MACK. I am sure-and it is very easy to go through this list-
 but I am sure you can find relatively smaller companies with larger
 claims than some of the large corporations.
 Mr. PLIMPTON. Mr. Chairman, Westinghouse has a $17,000 claim. I
 think that pretty well answers that question.
 Senator Buitnicic. That is all, gentlemen. Thank you very much.
 Our next witness will be Mr. William Munroe, USM Corp. Welcome
 to the committee, Mr. Munroe.
 }            STATEMENT OF WILLIAM C. MUNROE, JR., INTERNATIONAL
 COUNSEL, USM CORP.
 Mr. MUNROL. Mr. Chairman, I am here in place of our general coun-
 sel, Mr. Robert Maynard who has been ill and is unable to come on
 doctor's orders. He prepared our claim. He traveled through Germany
 and central Europe in the sixties putting this together and is cer-
 tainly the person most knowledgable of it.
 USM Corp. appears in the claim as United Shoe Machinery Corp.,
 which was our name up until about 1968.
 Now I will give you a little bit about the background of our claim.
 The losses were suffered primarily due to damage to factories, ware-
 houses, and manufacturing equipment from air raids during World
 War II. As documented in our claim, the damage to the business pre-
 mises of some of our subsidiaries ranged to 90 percent of some build-
 ings. There were four separate companies involved, with three in
 Germany. Of these three, two were 100 percent owned subsidiaries and
 had been since the early 1900's. The third in Germany was 79 percent
 owned at the time of loss and is now 100 percent owned.
 There was a small company in Denmark that suffered some losses
 that were covered by the War Claims Act.
 USM Corp. asked to testify today basically for two reasons : first
 because we read in the House testimony and again a point was made
 this morning of claims that the corporations had all received tax
 benefits. As I recite in our statement, our foreign claims settlement
 decision, W-21327 states :
 On the basis of the entire record, the Commission concludes that claimant is
 entitled to an award in the amount of $5,231,219 for losses due to military opera-
 tions of war or special measures under Section 202(a) of the Act. Claimant has
 stated under oath that no tax benefit has been derived on account of the losses
 which are the subject of this claim.
 In support of that, Mr. Manard asked our independent auditors
 Coopers and Lybrand to determine and certify that we had received
 no tax benefit and by letter to Mr. Manard dated November 23 of
 1966, they wrote-and I will quote in part, and if you want a copy of
 this I can get it for you-they wrote :
 In connection with your application for compensation under the War Claims
 Act of 1948 as amended for certain losses of real and tangible property in-
 .curred during World War II you have asked us to make a limited review of
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/249 CIA-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 your Federal income tax returns and. those of certain subsidiary corporations
 Tor the purpose of determining the amount, if any, of Federal tax benefits
 derived from any deductions claimed for the losses for which you have filed your
 rlaini.
 They then proceed to list our foreign companies covered by the
 claims, the years which they reviewed which were 1938 through 1965,
 and then in their final paragraph stated :
 Based upon this review we have concluded that in none of the years covered
 ?lbereby slid you or any of the domestic subsidiary corporations listed above
 cake any deduction or loss which relates to the investment in any of the for-
 ?eign corporations listed above. Accordingly in our opinion neither you nor ammm'
 of said domestic subsidiary corporations has received any federal tax benefits
 in and  of the above years with respect to the investment. in such foreign
 -corporations.
 The other reason for appearing today was that in bringing this bila
 to the attention of various Members of the Congress we received from
 one of them a copy of this memorandum, which I believe is the same
 one alluded to earlier entitled "Memorandum : Financial Condition of
 Individual Awardholders." This memorandum recited I believe 113
 cases and not. the 11 that was alluded to earlier, and says in part, with..
 out referring to any of the named individuals, but reads:
 'Elie following are specific examples illustrating the financial condition of
 the individual awardholders under the war Claims Act of 1948 and the fol-
 lowing cases are typical.
 After reciting the cases it says :
 Tile above cases are generally typical of the entire class of award holders.
 Most of these individuals are elderly persons beyond their productive ;,ears;
 o ud have few sources of income, and many dr., not qualify for 'substantial social.
 security payments because their productive years were spent out of the U.S,

 Enactment of 6.1728 would provide for many of them a financial state adequate
 to support them in their declining years.

 [The prepared statement of William Munroe follows:]
 STATEMENT  OI'  WILLIAM  C.  MUNROE,  JR., oN S. 1728 AT A HEARING HELD DY
 TIIE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
 Mr. Chairman : USM Corporation is a United States corporation having a
 remaining unpaid award of just over two million dollars under the War Claim
 Act of 1948, as amended. Until 1968 we were known as United Shoe Machinery
 Corporation, and it is in that name that our claim and award appear in the
 records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.
 USM's. award arises out of its share ownership in three German and one
 Danish subsidiary. In three of these cases the ownership was, and remains, one
 i          hundred per cent. In the fourth, the ownership at the time of loss was 79%,
 but is now 100%. In each case, USM has owned these companies since the
 early 1900's.
 The losses suffered were primarily damage to factories, warehouses, offices
 and manufacturing equipment from air raids during the War. As documented
 in USM's claim, damage to the business premises of USM's subsidiaries ranged
 up to 90% of some buildings.
 Proponents of the preference for individual claimants over corporate claimants
 have made much of the tax benefits received by the corporate claimants under
 Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 USM Corporation received no tax benefits under this or other Sections of
 the Code, because USM at no time deducted its losses in these subsidiaries. USM's
 Foreign Claims Settlement Decision W-21327 states :
 "Ou the basis of the entire record, the Commission concludes that claimant is
 entitled to an award in the amount of $5,231,219 for losses due to military opera-
 tions of war or special measures under Section 202(a) of the Act. Claimant has
 stated under oath that no tax benefit has been derived on account of the losses
 which are the subject of this claim."
 The validity of USM's statement under oath has been verified by independent
 auditors, Coopers & Lybrand.
 USlli' Corporation did not appear in opposition to the 1970 amendment to the
 War Claims Act which assured all claimants an additional $24,000 or full payment,
 whichever was less. The 1970 amendment would provide full payment for 144 of
 the 187 individual claimants who still have unpaid balances. USM strongly believes
 that no basis has been shown for now further amending the law to provide an
 absolute preference for the remaining 43 largest individual claimants over U.S.
 corporate claimants.
 Furthermore, from the statistics set forth on pages 32-37 of the Hearings held
 November 7, 1973, before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the
 Commerce Committee of the House, it would appear that of these 43 individuals,
 payment in full of the remaining balances of the five largest individual claims
 would total almost 2.3 million dollars.
 USM has seen no persuasive reasons for granting preference to such sub-
 stantial individual claimants over U.S. corporate claimants.
 USM Corporation has been in existence since 1.899. the large majority of its
 shareholders have during that time been U.S. citizens and for many years it
 has encouraged share ownership by its employees and through direct and in-
 direct ownership  a  substantial percentage  of  USM's  present and  retired
 American employees are shareholders of this Corporation.
 We believe that every justifiable preference for individual and small claim-
 ants has already been granted and that the preferences which would be granted
 under the proposed amendment are, for the reasons stated, inequitable to U.SM
 Corporation and its shareholders, and should therefore be opposed.
 Thank you.

 Memorandum: Financial Condition of Individual Awardholders
 The following are specific examples illustrating the financial condition of the
 individual awardholders under the War Claims Act of 1948. The following cases
 are typical.
 Lilli Bernstein of New York City is a widow 78 years old. The firm of which
 her husband was a partner is 4L bankruptcy and the vast majority of her
 previous recoveries under the War Claim, Act have gone to :pay Creditors. She
 lives on the balance of her award. in a small apartment. The unpaid balance
 of her award is $393,000, payment of which would make her financially secure.
 Ulrich ,Strauss of Los Angeles is in his 70's and works as a short order cook.
 His income is less than $5,000 per year. The unpaid portions of his, two awards
 total about $300,000.
 Siefffried Aram* of New York ie 81 years old and has an income of about
 $3,000 per year. While the unpaid portion of phis award is quite small, any
 amount he can recover would be an important addition to his meager income.
 Berbert Jov.7dtl* of Long Island City,'New York, is an elderly man withan
 income of about $5,000 per year. Payment of his $24,000 award would mnkc a
 substantial di8'erence in his financial condition.
 Eli :Prockenheim of Brooklyn, New York is 80 years old and lives with his
 ailing wife an an income of $9,000 per year. Much of his income goes to'meet her
 medical expenses. Payment of their $43,000 award 'Would be of enormous benefit
 to the couple.
 The Bell`fafrsity* of San Francisco consists of'l0 Children of Edward fell. All
 of them were interned in a Japanese concentration camp during the war. While
 their incomes vary, all are modest, and payment of their relatively small awards
 would be a significant benefit to them.
 Helen APting"nri* of New York is a 78-year-old widow living on small social
 Security payments. Since the bulk of her husband's career was spent in Germany
 the Social Security payments she receives are very small.'Mrs. Allington is ill,
 ant Fpayment of hol, $7,000 award would help her greatly.
 Er .e.t Lormuw* of New York lives on a small income. Though both.-he and
 his wife are past 70, both still hold jobs to support themselves. Their $14,Oa)
 award substantially'exce?ds their current combined incomes.
 lffnst Ratkantu,* nep ierb of the German minister who signed the Versailles
 Treaty ending World War 1, lives in New'York on an income of about'$9,000.
 Mr. Ratnanau is elderly and has relatively few productive years ahead of him.
 Adele Geyer* is over 90 years old and lives in a nursing home. Payment of
 her $10,000 award would alleviate the financial burden of maintaining her in
 the home.
 Carla Palm* of Fort Thomas, Kentucky is SI years old and an invalidrequir-
 ing constant care. Payment of her~$25,900 award would help pay the heavy cost
 of this care. $24,185.34 ($165.34) will remain unpaid.
 Ernest H"nsn of Los Angeles is a wealthy man who does not-require pay-
 ment of his award in order to live comfortably. He has supported the effort to
 pass S. 1728 primarily because he believes that the'principle of S. 1728 is sound
 and that these individuals, many of whom he has come to know, are deserving
 of this-relief andneed it badly.
 The 'above eases are gerrerally typical of the entire class of individual award-
 holders. Most of these individuals are elderly persons beyond their productive
 years and have few sources of income. Many do not qualify for substantial
 Social Security payments because their productive years were spent outside the
 United States. The fruits of their labors were lost in the war and are the basis
 of their War Claims awards. Enactment of S. 1728 would 'provide for many of
 them a final financial stake to support them In their declining years.
 Senator Buiznrcic.. Is that your statement then?
 Mr. MiaNizor:. Yes.
 Senator RTTRDICK. All right. Thank you very much. Can you ex-
 plain, M. Munroe, the reason why TTSM did not tike a tax loss in
 the, 140's when the property Was lo A or destroyed'$
 Mr.MUNROn. Sir, we tried to determine that. We were unable to.
 The best conclusion tha : we were able, to reach was that we had owned

 these properties going back prior to World War I and we had gotten
 them back after World War I and we think we must have assumed we
 were going to win this one also and we kept them on the books. We
 did not take a tax loss for them.
 That may seem inadequate, but that is the only thing I can-well,
 we have been unable to determine really why they did not take it tax
 loss at that time. There was basis and it could have been done.
 Senator BURDICK. If we assume under any formula of priorities that
 USM will never receive 100 percent payment of claims of $5.2 million,
 could it claim a tax loss in the year in which the Claims Commission
 makes its final payment leaving a balance due and owing on your
 claim?
 Mr. MUNROE. I am not a fax attorney, sir, but I don't believe that
 we could.
 Senator BURDICK. In other words you would suppose that if $2
 million was paid out of the $5 million claim you could not claim the
 $3 million at that point?
 Mr. MUNROE. I don't believe that we could, but, as I say I am not a
 tax attorney.
 Senator BURDicx. If you find to the contrary, would you let us
 know?
 Mr. MUNROE. Yes.
 Senator BURDICK. After the award did USM reactivate these three
 German and one Danish subsidiaries?
 Mr. MUNROE. They did, sir.
 Senator BURDICK. They are operating?
 Mr. MUNRoE. They are operating now and we have rebuilt them.
 Senator BURDICK. In doing so did you receive any'War concessions, either
 tax or otherwise, because of the loss sustained in the    ?
 Mr. MUNROE. We could find no tax benefits that we received. Mr.
 McClellan I believe this morning alluded to something called the
 equalization of burdens taxes, which were payments required from
 corporations to be made to the Government of Germany by German
 corporations and it is my understanding that we did make such pay-
 ments, but we did receive no benefits.
 Also as for just taking deductive losses, in reviewing the financial
 statements of those companies for those years, it would appear to us
 that we operated at a loss during the years immediately subsequent to
 World War II and therefore didn't have profits against which we
 could take such losses.

 mation request by the subcommittee.]

 DEAR SENATOR Buanicx : In my testimony last Tuesday afternoon in opposition
 to granting additional preferences to. individuals as proposed by S. 1728 (amend-
 ment to the War Claims Act of 1948), I stated that USM Corporation had re-
 ceived no Federal Income Tax benefit from the losses it suffered due to damage to
 and loss of property of its German subsidiaries in World War II.
 Following my testimony, you Inquired whether USM would be able to obtain
 any tax benefit from these losses in the event that USM was unable to recover

 it could but I was not a tax specialist, and you asked that I verify this,
 I have since reviewed the matter with our Tai: Counsel, and I am assured that
 it is much too late to take a deduction for the original loss, that we cannot at
 any time take any deduction for the difference between our award and such lesser
 amounts as we receive, and further, that all amounts received by USM under
 the award are subject to Federal Income :Lax.
 I wish to take ,his opportunity to express -my thanks to the Committee on
 beh;iif of USM Corporation for the opportunity to be heard on this matter. I
 have not previously had occasion to testify before a Senate Committee and
 I v ae most impres; ed by the willingness of both you and Senator Fong to devote

 11r. 1' TESTPIIA:'... I don`t know whether they are questions, but I would
 "tike, to clear up one thing for the record, Mr. Chairman. Several of
 the % itnesses have made reference to various memorandums that were
 eireulated. I think the record should show or will show that the

 'I'lis memorandum referred to follows:]
 Com-miTrrun ExilnuT 1
 FiORT SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS ITT FAVOR OF THE HOUSE
 AMENDMENTS TO 5. 1728
 1. Individual awards are based on the loss of homes, personal tie-
 lwt_aings and small family businesses. In most cases, the individuals
 lost all they had. The corporate awardholders are almost exclusively
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : Cl 6RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 large multinational corporations that lost only a small fraction of their
 total assets. The corporations suffered losses, but the individuals
 suffered disasters.
 2. The corporate awardholders have taken more than $35 million in
 tax deductions as a result of their losses and have had the use of the
 money they saved for over 30 years. A thorough and diligent search has
 disclosed no individual shareholders who took tax deductions. Cor-
 porations have therefore recovered a much higher percentage of their-
 losses. (A detailed memo on this subject is attached at tab I).)
 3. The majority of individual. awardholders are elderly persons.
 Many of them live on small fixed incomes and receive little in the way
 of social security payments since their productive years were spent
 abroad. Their war claims awards represent a final financial stake to
 support them in their declining years. (A detailed memorandum on
 this subject is attached at tab C.) by contrast, at least 96 percent of
 the unpaid corporate awards are held by large companies whose stock,
 or whose parent company's stock, is traded on the New York or Ameri-
 can Stock Exchange. All small business corporations have already been
 =.z id in full under a previous priority.
 4. Granting priority to individuals would reduce the amounts avail-
 able to corporate awardholders by only about 5 cents on the dollar.
 By contrast, the failure tc give individuals a priority would result in
 a permanent loss to individuals of about 70 percent of their unpaid
 awards. Under existing law, corporations would receive about 93
 percent of all pro rata pa vurents and more than 83 percent of all pay-
 ments to corporate awardholders would go to the 13 largest corporate
 awardholders.
 5. Many corporate awards are held by corporations that acquired
 the stock of the company that actually suffered the loss many years
 after the loss was incurred. In some cases, the acquiring corporation
 paid litle or nothing for the stock of the company suffering the loss.
 Recovery by such acquiring corporations would be a total windfall
 to these corporations. The individuals are the very persons who suf-
 fered the losses, or, in some cases, the children of those who suffered
 the loss. In all cases, the individual awards have remained in the
 family.
 6. Corporations received large tax and other benefits from foreign
 governments in compensation for their losses when they reestablished
 their operations abroad after the war. Individuals received no such
 benefit.
 7. In order to receive an award, claimants had to provide documen-
 tary proof of their ownership of the property that had been lost. Many
 individuals lost their documents in the war. U.S. corporations, which
 maintained extensive records in this country, were able to document
 a much greater percentage of their losses and hence received awards
 to cover a, larger portion of their losses.
 8. All individual awardholders are U.S. citizens. Many of the stock-
 holders of the corporate awards are foreign nationals. The basic theory
 o'the War Claims Act. is to compensate U.S. citizens. The priority for
 individuals furthers that purpose.
 9. S. 1728, as amended, passed the Rouse by a vote of 368-17.

 Summary:
 It is suggested. that because of the reasons outlined in this memo-
 randum the Senate reject the amendments proposed by the House.
 In the alternative, we suggest that the issues are of sufficient import
 to warrant at least a hearing by the committee, before resolution.
 1; ackaround:
 The War Claims Act (50 U.S.C. app. 2017) was enacted to pay awards
 to those Americans who lost their lives and had property destroyed
 in enemy lands during the Second World War. As the law presently
 stands, all awardees (both individuals and corporations) are to be
 paid up to $35,000, or the amount of their award, Whichever is less.
 All awardees (with a few exceptions 1) have been paid at least $11,01)0
 of their award. Ili fact, as will be shown later, some awardees have
 received in excess of $100,000. In any case, awardees can expect to
 receive an additional $24,000 (or the full amount of their remaining
 claiIll, if their award does not total $35,000) before pro rata distribu-
 tionbegins,
 Proposed legislation:
 Senate. bill 1718 (S-1728) was passed by the Senate last year con-
 tailning but one section, which increased payments to American civil-
 ialis held as prisoners of war during the Vietnam conflict. The House
 Commerce Committee then adopted amendments which were passed
 by the House in July 1974. The House amendments proposed :
 (1) That all individual awardees receive the full amount of
 their award prior to any funds being distributed to corporate
 awardees; and
 (2) That before pro rata distribution shall take place among
 corporations, all corporate awardees shall be paid $50,000, or the
 fall amount of their award, whichever is less.
 Dicussion
 REASONS WHY AHZFNDMENT-WHICH GIVES INDIVIDUAL AWARDEES PREF-
 ERENCE OVER CORPORATIONS--SHOT LD NOT BE ENACTED
 1. No legal, precedent
 I' nder present law, there is no legal precedent which places individ-
 uals on a separate and :ligher footing than corporations. On the con-
 trary, the law of bankruptcy, corporate liquidations, commercial
 credl-it., et cetera, places corporations and individuals on an equal foot-
 in* q. That is, where inadequate funds remain to satisfy all claims, the
 fluids are distributed pro rata to those claimants with the greath.st
 claim. No distinction is made as to whether the claimants are individ-
 uals or eorpor. ations.
 The instant case should provide no rationale for exception. In fact,
 establishment o:t such a priority could prove a dangerous precedent;
 particularly in light of similar claims which may arise out of national-
 izal ions in Cuba, et cetera.
 Annie awardees, those who suffered physical injury, small business claimants, and
 eleemosynary institutions. have been paid in full.

 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : C1A-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 2. Only 43 individuals will benefit by. enactment of this amendment
 Enactment of this amendment will benefit only 43 individuals. All
 other individual awardees will receive the full amount of their award,
 when under the present law, distribution of $24,000 is made. Many of
 the remaining: 43 claimants who will not receive the full amount of
 their award are wealthy individuals who cannot be considered to be
 living under "necessitous circumstances." Iii, fact,,even a cursory review
 of the statistics filed by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission
 (see page 35 of the House hearings) shows that many of these individ-
 uals have already been compensated to a large degree. For example:
 (1) If the present law granting $24,000 per claimant is allowed
 to stand, the average amount received by the 43 claimants will
 be in excess of $200,000 apiece;
 (2) If the present law granting $24,000 per claimant is allowed
 to stand, 16 of the 43 claimants will have been awarded in excess
 of $200,000 apiece;
 (3) If the present law granting $24,000 per claimant is allowed
 to stand, 41 of the 43 claimants will have been awarded in excess
 of $100,000 apiece;
 (4), Finally, if the amendment is allowed to pass, 9 of these 43
 claimants will take a lion's portion of 62 percent of the individual
 awards.
 In light of these statistics, it is difficult to justify that individuals
 should receive preference over corporations.
 3. It would be wrong to enact preferential rights for individuals be-
 cause of alleged tax benefits received by corporations
 Some individual claimants argue that an injustice exists in that
 corporations received tax deductions for their war claims while in-
 dividuals did not. Therefore, they argue, this injustice should be
 remedied by giving individual claimants a priority to the moneys
 available-the war claims fund.
 We refute this argument as nonsense. A. review of the facts show
 that some corporations did not get any tax deductions. for their war
 claims. And while other corporations did obtain tax benefits, these
 benefits were deducted, frorn, the awards granted by the Commission.,
 In other words, all present corporate awards are net of tax benefits,
 There has been no double benefit as implied by some individuals.
 REASONS WHY AMENDI ENT-WHICH ALLOWS $50,000 FOR EVERY CORPO-
 RATE CLAWANT OR AMOUNT OF AWARD, WHICHEVER IS LESS-SIIOULD BE
 REJECTED
 In its report, the House committee reasoned that "equitable con-
 siderations" led the committee members to adopt the amendment.
 However, the committee report did not explain "equitable considera-
 tions" and, therefore, we can only guess at why the committee felt it
 necessary to give preference to small awardees. Nevertheless, it seems
 reasonable to assume that the committee reasoned: "The smaller the
 award, the smaller the company. Therefore, to help the small business-
 man, we will give him preference on his claims." A close examination
 of the facts, however, indicates that this reasoning is fallacious; and
 in fact, should the amendment pass, the effect would be to create an
 inequitable situation.

 Specifically, we object to the amendment on three grounds. They are:
 1. Those claimants qualifying as small i isinessmen have received com-
 pensation for the full amount of ther,award
 It is important to remember that the War Claims Act has already
 made provision for small business claimants under section 2017-1 (50
 App. USCA 2017). Those claimants qualifying as small businessmen
 (along with charitable nonprofit organizations) received compensation
 for the full amount of their claim. Secondly, some of the smaller out-
 standing claims are held by such corporate giants as Westinghouse,
 Borg-Warner., S. S. Kresge, and Studebaker-Worthington. Our point
 is this : The amendment does not actually favor the small businessman.
 The truly small businessman has already been compensated for his lose,
 and furthermore, some of the claimants who will benefit the most by
 passage of the amendment are not small corporations, but on the con-
 trary, are very large.
 The proposed amendment discrimina Fes against manufacturing cor-
 porations, in favor of insurance companies
 To illustrate this point, consider the following statistics :
 Total corporate awards (combining insurance and manufacturing
 corporations) amount to approximately $94.7 million. Of this, approxi-
 mately $5.3 million, or 6 percent, constitutes awards to insurance com-
 panies. The remainder, approximately $89.4 million, or 94 percent, is
 attributable to manufacturing corporate claims. However, if the
 amendment is passed, insurance companies will receive 20 percent of
 the fund's moneys, assuming $10 million remains for distribution (see
 app. A). It is difficult, in view of these statistics, to discern how
 "equitable considerations" will be served when the amendment ob-
 viously benefits insurance companies to the detriment of manufacturing
 coporations.
 3. Enactment of the amendment swill give preference to those corpora-
 tions who have lost the least, over those corporations who have
 suffered ti   most
 This amendment favors the small corporate awardee, at the expense
 of the large awardee. Those corporations who have $50,000 or less wilt
 receive full compensation for their award, while large awardees will
 have the amount available for pro rata distribution reduced by the
 amount awarded to the small claimants. Traditionally, when claimants
 face a situation in wIr.ch insufficient amounts are available to satisfy all
 claims, the amount available is awarded on a pro rata basis. Under the
 proposed amendment, this approach `mould be overthrown. The in-
 herent unfairness of the amendment is best summarized by Congress-
 man Kuykendall's remarks in his supplemental views. He said : "Such a
 scheme cannot commend itself as good law or simple justice. It (this
 amendment) must be based on the premise that the more one lost, the
 iess entitled ha is to reimbursement." Obviously, this is an inequitable
 proposal.
 In summary, then, we feel that the amendment is patently inequitable
 lsecause it does not necessarily help the small businessman; it dis-
 criminates in favor of insurance compa:?ues, and it overthrows the nor-
 mal priorities by compensating one who has lost the least, before com-
 pensating those who have lost the most.

 Senator BURDICK. This is not a court of law, but we are trying to get
 the exhibits pretty well identified here. Any more questions?
 Mr. WEsTPRAL. No, I have none.
 Senator BURDICK. Well, thank you very much.
 The next and I believe the last witness is Mr. Thomas Davenport,
 corporate counsel for Budd Co.
 STATEMENT OF THOMAS DAVENPORT, CORPORATE COUNSEL, BUDD
 CO., ACCOMPANIED BY RICHARD TOWSLEY, MANAGER, TAX
 ADMINISTRATION
 Mr. DAVENPORT. This is Mr. Towsley who is our tax expert, and
 he is with me in case you have some questions that he can fill in, sir.
 Senator BURDICK. All right. I might ask him a question right now.
 Mr. Towsley, suppose after the fund is liquidated and we find out
 that company A has only been paid half of the claim and there is 50
 percent of the claim unpaid. Now, at that point could a corporation
 -claim any kind of a tax loss?
 Mr. TowsLEY. No, there would be no loss deduction available for
 that difference. There might conceivably be a loss of liquidation meas-
 ured by the difference between the cost of the subsidiary and the as-
 sets received, whatever they may be, if the company were less than
 80-percent owned. That is all. The answer to your question is no.
 Senator BURDICK. Well, T carry some low-priced stock with the ever-
 present hope that some day it may do something. Five years from
 now I may decide to call it worthless. I have the option at that point,
 haven't I, to declare a loss?
 Mr. TOWSLEY. As an individual, as a shareholder, if your stock
 becomes worthless, this is a capital loss, yes.
 Senator BuRDmczi. But you can't use the same argument with the
 war claims? You always have hopes that they might be paid in full?
 Mr. TowsL,EY. Yes, but I know of no provision in the law which
 would permit you to take a deduction for the amount of the claim
 specifically.
 Senator Bonnier. All right. Thank you very much for the pro-
 fessional opinion. You may proceed.
 Mr. DAVENPORT. We have presented a copy of our statement so I
 won't proceed to read it, but I would like to emphasize a few points.
 We are representing the Budd Co., and the Budd Co. has some 23,-
 '000 shareholders and some 18,000 employees, and all of them and us,
 too, are interested in the House amendments. We are primarily an
 automobile parts supplier. We are, along with the industry, having
 problems and facing a liquidity crisis. Any further payment on this
 award is of great importance to us.
 We are here to say that we believe the proposed amendment is un-
 fair because on the one hand it proposes to distinguish treatment of
 a class of individual claimants from the class of corporate claimants
 which amounts to an ultimate denial of the balance of the corporate
 claims, but on the other hand, the proposed amendment would ignore
 distinct differences within the class of individuals and within the class
 of corporate claimants. We believe that the only equitable alterna-
 tive to pro rata payments would be to give separate consideration
 to the situation of each claimant. Conversely, we do not believe that

 100
 all corporations should be penalized as a class because some received
 major tax benefits or were otherwise able to reduce the effect of their
 losses.
 Significantly the Budd Co. did receive a tax benefit but the award
 was in the order of $2,860,000. The tax effect was $16,300.58. This
 is less than 6/10 of a percent of the reognized loss.
 The tax treatment of the Budd Co. was dictated by the subsidiary
 structure of the investments in prewar Germany. We can't exactly
 tell you the reason why no greater tax effect was available, but we
 can assure you that that was the total tax effect of the war loss. There
 was no further significant tax consideration until Budd finally dis-
 solved the subsidiary structure some 30 years later.
 In 1971 the Budd Co.'s corporate income tax was reduced by aA
 amount equivalent to 30 percent of the unpaid balance of the award.
 It is significant, however, that that 30 percent will be reassessed when-
 ever and to whatever extent Budd receives a further payment on the
 balance of the award.
 Concerning the statement made on page 20 of the hearing of No-
 vember 7, 1973, which indicated it typical corporation with it war loss
 of $1 million would receive some 90 percent of its loss in tax benefits.
 Well, we fail to find any way of identifying such a typical corporation.
 Certainly the Budd Co. is not. such a corporation. W e don't believe that
 that median corporation exists.
 We have put; in some of the statistics in our formal statement as to
 that, but I don`t think I need to repeat them. I would just like, to say
 that we have no objection to a small claim preference on a level to
 be determined by Congress. It has already fixed it at $35,000, but, we
 think the proposal to give individuals fall priority clearly constitutes
 an unfair and unreasonable preference. We have knowledge Only of
 the Budd Co.',,; situation specifically as to this.
 Mr. Chairman, we had insignificant tax benefits, and we have reason
 to believe that many other corporations also have not realized the
 significant benefits that are attributed t;o their situation.
 We respectfully oppose the amendments and are willing to answer
 any questions you may have.
 Senator Bmu~rcn. Thank you very much for your contribution. Any
 questions?
 Mr. WFS'rr1rAr,, I just: have, a couple, Mr. Chairman. Your statement,
 Mr. Davenport, says that in 1971 the Budd Co's corporate, income tax
 was reduced by an amount calculated at 30 percent of the unpaid
 balance of the award, that is, the award of $2.8 million. Now I under-
 stood the chairman to ask Mr. Towsley, your tax counsel, whether
 it was possible to claim it tax loss; at such time as the War Claims
 Commission determine? that they have made their final payout and
 there is no more money to be paid. out, end here you are, under the
 chairman's example, with an unpaid claim of $3 million and he asked,
 assuming you hcd been carrying that claim as an asset on your books,
 could you then write) that off. Mr. Towsley told the chairman that you
 couldn't, yet in i_971, apparently a loss was taken for some assets that
 were destroyed back during 1939 to 1945. Could either you or Mr.
 Towsley explain that?
 Mr. 1)AVr.xroxr. We would like to. I should have perhaps given some
 more detail. We had it manufacturing facility in what became East

 Berlin. It made automobile stampings and made automobile bodies as
 such. We lost all of that production facility. There was left a corporate
 shell that had some patient properties, and that corporate shell was
 continued. Then eventually the corporate shell was liquidated. At the
 time of the liquidation it was necessary for us to show that we had
 received this war claim award.
 Mr. WESTPIIAL. In other words what you are saying is that the
 amount you had received up to 1971 on your claim of $2.8 million had
 to be taken into account when you determined what loss you had
 sustained by liquidation of one of your wholly owned subsidiaries. Is
 that about what you are trying to tell me?
 Mr. DAVENPORT. That is about it.
 Mr. WESTPIIAL. Is that essentially it, Mr. Towsley?
 Mr. TowSLEY. That is essentially it. The question I believe from
 Mr. Burdick was, could we take a loss when the claim against the
 War Claims Commission became worthless and the answer is that no
 we could not.
 In this case we had a subsidiary and that subsidiary domestically
 owned the foreign subsidiary. The foreign subsidiary Ambe Budd did
 survive the war although it had nothing left. It was continued in busi-
 ness, but not as an operating company. When it continued in business,
 it collected some royalties and so forth. Eventually 30 years later that
 foreign subsidiary Ambe Budd was liquidated. When it was liquidated,
 we received some $27,000 as our share of the assets in liquidation. That
 was all. Our loss, which Zve deducted at that time as a capital loss, is the
 loss resulting from the liquidation of an investment in stock of a
 foreign corporation.
 The loss is measured as the difference between our investment costs
 and that $27,000. There is one more point I wish to make. The point
 I wish to make is that the $1.7 million payment on our award did not
 come home tax free. It was treated by the Internal Revenue Service as
 a reduction of the basis of our investment.
 Mr. WESTPHHAL. In the return that you filed for the taxable year
 1971?
 Mr. TOWSLEY. Yes.
 Mr. WE, STrriAL. All right; now then, as I understand what you have
 explained to me, it is that you had a wholly owned subsidiary that you
 carried on the books of USM as having certain value
 Mr. TowSLEY. The Budd Co. and not USM.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Excuse me, the Budd Co., as having a certain value.
 Now when that wholly owned subsidiary was liquidated
 Mr. TOWSLEY. Not wholly owned, sir.
 Mr. WESTrrrAL. In which you had an interest.
 Mr. TowsrY. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. Now when that was liquidated, you received $27,000
 from the liquidation?
 Mr. TOWSLEY. Yes.
 Mr. WESTPIIAL. You had been carrying your stock ownership on
 your books at a higher value?
 Mr. TowSLEY. No, sir; we get a little bit more complicated here.
 The investment had disappeared from the books back in the 1940's.
 I can go into more detail if need be
 Mr. WESTPHAL. No.

 Mr. TOWSLEY. But there was no i:nvestm ent whatsoever on our books ;
 however, the tax basis is a matter of record entirely apart from what
 we had on our books. We had a tax basis of $2.7 million, which is
 coincidentally about the same as the amount of the award.
 Mr. WESTPHAL. So that here we have the situation you just ex-
 plained to us which is a situation where one corporation owned part
 but not all. of the shares of stock of another corporation and whether
 it ccarried it on its books as having a value or not, it nevertheless had
 an acquisition cost basis which for tax purposes would allow you to
 el to im a tax loss at the time you received only $27,000 in liquidation ?
 Mr. Towsra y, That is correct.
 Mr. WESTPIIAL. Were you present in the hearing room when I was
 trying to determine what the cost basis was of Shanghai Power Co.
 as .acquired by Boise Cascade?
 Mr. Towsr.FY. Yes, sir.
 Mr. WESTPHi L. Would you care to present an opinion as to whether
 the tax treatrnccnt you received might be available under the same
 provision of the Internal Revenue Service to Boise Cascade in con-
 nection with this Ebasco matter?
 Mr. TOWSLEY. I don't believe I can give any opinion or any com-
 ment on the Boise Cascade situation. It appeared to be a rather com-
 plic-ated and complex merger situation involving exchanges of stock
 and groups of assets, e cetera. I could say nothing further on that..
 '.lr. vVESTPJIAr.,Thankvou.Ihave nothing further.
 Senator Bunrrcx. Thank you very much.
 `file prepared statement of Thomas I;lavenport in full follows:-!
 aiy nurse is Thomas I. Davenport. I am Corporate Counsel for The Budd
 Cam- Michigan, Mr. Richard F. Tcusley, our Manager, Tax Administration,
 a3   t ;.;c:.;ct;is The Budd Company. I have a very short statement; Mr. Tousley is
 pr , ja -- I to ;.;ive more details and we are both ready to answer any questions.
 We appreciate the opportunity to give the viewpoint of one corporation in
 op ,.,.:ition to any unfair discrimination among claimants. There are some 18,000
 ene)rioye'S and some 23,000 shareholders receiving our newsletters, all having an
 iub'rest in the health and assets of The Budd Company. Though perhaps I)eft(,.r
 ke ?~.,z 'oar i?s railway passenger cars, 80% of the Company's production is for
 th?' : ?ttotnoiive industry.
 t e believe the prouose-l amendment is unfair because, on the one hand, it
 prto distinguish treatment of the class of individual claimants from the
 class of corporate claimants, amounting; to an ultimate denial of the balance of
 th=r nts. There are numerous instances among the corporate
 nwa rds. in which the company that actually suffered the loss has long since been
 acquired by the present awardholder. By contraat, the individual awards are
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 1aCCIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 all held by the persons who suffered the loss or by members of the family that
 suffered the loss.
 Fifth. Many corporate awardholders were eligible for substantial tax and
 other benefits from foreign governments after the war as incentives for reestab-
 lishing their operations in those countires. These benefits, which further com-
 pem;ated the corporations for their losses, were in no way taken into account in
 the calculation of their war claims awards. Such benefits were unavailable to the
 individual awardholders.
 Sixth. Many of the corporate awardholders are insurance companies that
 insured risks overseas at premium rates to reflect the risks of war. These
 companies were then subrogated to the rights of the insured. The substantial
 premiums received by these insurance companies were not taken account of in
 the calculation of war claims awards. No individual awardholder is in a com-
 parable position.
 Seventh. Full payment of the individual awards will not substantially affect
 the amounts that will be available to pay corporate awards, The corporate awards
 total about $94.7 million. There will be only about $20 million at most available
 for` payment of all awards-both corporate and individual. Thus, even under
 existing law, the corporations will receive at most about 20 cents on the dollar.
 Since the total amount payable to individuals is only $6.5 million, giving a
 priority to individuals will reduce the corporate recovery by only a few cents
 on the dollar.
 Eighth. The corporate awards represent a greater percentage of the actual
 losses of the corporate awardholders than the individual awards represent of
 the actual losses of the individuals. In the granting of awards, the Foreign
 Claims Settlement Commission required documentary proof of the loss for which
 an award was sought. Many individuals who suffered property losses also lost
 their documentary proof of ownership in the war. Large U.S. corporations that
 maintained extensive records in this country did not have similar problems and
 hence were able to document a much higher percentage of their actual loss than
 were individuals.
 Ninth. All the individual awardholders are U.S. citizens. The War Claims Act
 required that an individual be a U.S. citizen at the time his loss in order to be
 eligible for an award. By contrast, a corporation need only have been incorporated
 in the United States and 50 percent of its assets owned by U.S. nationals in order
 to qualify. A not insubstantial portion of the stock of many corporate award-
 holders is held by foreign nationals. Since the basic purpose of the War Claims
 Act was to compensate U.S. citizens for their losses, this purpose is more
 consistently served by allowing individual awardholders, all of whom are U.S
 citizens, a priority.
 These are compelling reasons I submit, in behalf of enactment of a priority
 for individuals in the payment of World War II war claims awards. I hope,
 therefore, that the Subcommittee will recommend acceptance by the Senate of
 the House amendment of S. 1728.

 DEPARTMENT OP STATE,
 Washington, D.C., December 2,19711.
 DEAR SENATOR BUR.DICK : I am writing to urge favorable consideration of S.
 1728 by the special Subcommittee you are chairing for the Committee on the
 Judiciary. The basic purpose of this bill is to increase detention benefits for
 our civilian prisoners of war under the War Claims Act to $150 per month-
 equivalent to the benefit provided for our military POW's. It is now more than
 twenty months since our men returned from captivity in Indochina, which makes
 this a matter of urgent priority. By the action of your Subcommittee I hope
 it will be possible to move to final approval of this legislation before the Congress
 adjourns.
 We recognize that the bill as approved by the House contains a second section
 relating to a different provision of the War Claims Act. The Department has
 testified against this amendment because it would discriminate against corporate
 claimants in favor of certain individual claimants and would establish an
 undesirable precedent. The Department favors equal treatment of all claimants
 without preference.

 this other section, we hope a way can be found to gain final approval of the

 T)SAR (;-TIAuRuAN T:ASTLAND: This letter i;, in opposition to S. 1728. as amended
 by the House to alter the preferences estalilished for payments under the V9a.r
 Claims Act of 1948 by providing for priority payments to individual claimants
 ill the full amount of their award before any further pro-rata distributions to
 other claimants may be made.
 We are in agreement with the statemen ~` in opposition to the amendments
 by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. We would like to present this
 brief additional statement viewing the proposed legislation from the viewpoiif
 of (;eneral Electric Company shareholders.
 As it stands, the statute already contains significant preferences for individual
 claimants. Under these preferences, claimants with an award of $100,000 or ben
 will he paid in full before any further pro-rata distributions will be made.
 ']'his results from the fact that an individual claimant will have re,,eived
 $10,(X)0 under paragraph 2 of Section 213(x) of the Act, as well as 61.8% cf
 the remaining $90,000 of his award, i.e., $55,170. Thereafter, the addition :l
 w35,000 preference added in 1970 through a new paragraph 3 comes into applico-
 lion. Under this preference an additional payment of $11,000 to each claimant
 has already been coo do, As the funds become available, an additional "non
 pro-rata" payment of $24,000 must be made for an aggregate preference    wont
 t :x100,000.
 We believe that claims in excess of $100,000 should not be considered to lie
 small claims entitled to preferential treatment. This is particularly true wilier.
 claims of such size are considered in the context of the shareholders of General
 11'.eetrie. We have nearly 300,000 shareholders who own less than 50 shares
 c1 stock, an inveretnient of less than $2,000 at current market. There are rot:ghly
 200,000 shnreholr'ers who own between 50 and 300 shares, an investment between
 $2,000 and x20,000. Fairness and equity between individuals, whether they be
 corporate shareholders or direct claimants, require that preference to individuals
 t wt be extended beyond the full compensation to claimants with awards of nln
 to $100.000. which is already provided for.

 IISAR SENATOR FASTT.AND: I am asking your support of S. 1725, as amended, a
 bill to amend the War Claims Act of 1945, which has been reported by the House
 Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and is at present: pending before
 the House Riles Committee'. This bill originated in the Senate Judiciary Com-
 mittee and passed the Senate on October 8, 1973. The House Committee on Inteer-
 staTe and Foreign Comrnerre reported this bill on July 3. 1974. and added all
 amendment to the War Claims Act previously embodied in two House bills, H.R.
 4870 and 11.11. 1729, giving individual II.S_ citizens who are awardholders under
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : CIA-RDP75B0038OR000500380003-7
 Approved For Release 2001/08/29 : 171X-RDP75B00380R000500380003-7
 that Act a priority over corporate awardholders in further payments from the
 War Claims Fund in compensation for losses suffered in World War II. The Sub-
 -committee on Commerce and Finance unanimously approved it during compre-
 hensive hearings.
 I am an individual awardholder claiming payment for the loss of two fully
 equipped factories and adjacent property. I received an award from the Foreign
 Claims Settlement Commission to compensate me for this loss, but unless S. 1728
 is passed, most of the funds available for payment of this award will go instead
 to big corporations, such as Exxon and IT&T, rather than to individuals such as
 myself. Since the War Claims Fund-consisting entirely of enemy assets seized
 by the United States Government during World War II, and containing no funds
 appropriated by Congress-is too small to pay all awards fully, a substantial
 part of my loss will never be paid unless S. 1728 is enacted.
 There are two important reasons for this legislation :
 (1) The large corporate awardholders lost a minute fraction of their corporate
 assets, while individual U.S. citizens, such as myself, lost homes, personal belong-
 ings, and small family businesses, in short, all they had.
 (2) The corporations could claim millions of dollars in tax deductions under
 a special provision of the Tax Code as a result of their losses, while individuals
 were unable to take advantage of these deductions. Thus, between their tax deduc-
 tions and the large payments already received by corporations under the War
 Claims Act, the corporate awardholders have recovered a much greater part of
 their loss than have individual U.S. citizens.
 I do hope that S. 1728 will be passed by the House very soon, as I am no longer
 young and have already waited a long time for this final settlement. I therefore
 urge you to give your active support in assuring that the Senate will concur in
 the House amendment of S. 1728 when the bill returns to the Senate.
 Sincerely yours,
 Ilan. JAMES O. EASTLAND,
 U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND : This is to ask your support for bill S. 1728 which is
 to amend the War Claims Act of 1948, and now pending before the House Rules
 Committee. It would amend the War Claims Act to give individual U.S. citizens,
 who have been awarded but not fully paid priority over corporate awardholders
 in any further payments for losses suffered during World War II. The Subcom-
 mittee on Commerce and Finance held comprehensive hearings on this amend-
 ment and unanimously approved it.
 illy husband is a retired physician, 80 years old, I am 70. I am deriving my
 awards from the loss of my private house, and the loss of considerable business
 assets. The award was received by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to
 compensate these losses. Unless S. 1728 is passed a substantial part of my losses
 will not be compensated, and the vast majority of the funds available will go
 to big corporate awardholders such as Exxon, and ITT. The War Claims Fund
 consists entirely of enemy assets seized by the U.S. Government during World
 War II, and no funds appropriated by Congress.
 The important reasons for this legislation are:
 (1) The individual U.S. citizens, such as myself, lost homes, personal belong-
 ings, and small businesses. Most individual awardholders lost nearly all they
 had.
 (2) Corporate awardholders took tax deducations of millions of dollars under
 a special provision of the Tax-Code as result of their losses and used and saved
 their money over 30 years. The individual awardholders did not have these
 advantages. Therefore through their tax deductions and the large payments
 already made to the corporations under the War Claims Act the corporate
 awardholders have recovered a significantly greater percentage of their loss
 than the individual U.S. citizens.
 I am hopeful that S. 1728 will be passed by the House in the near future, and
 I urge you to do your utmost in assuring that the Senate will concur in the
 House amendment of S. 1728 when the bill returns to the Senate.
 Thank you very much for your help on this legislation.
 Very sincerely yours,

 DEAR  SENATOR  EASTLAND:  I  understand that                            the  House has approved  the
 above bill as amended, and am writing to enlist your support when it comes
 up for joint action.
 I am an individual awardholder, having received my award from the Foreign
 Claims Settlement Commission in compensation for the loss of property in Past
 Germany.
 As you know, the moneys remaining in the War Claims Fund do not suffice
 to pay all claims fully; and unless S. 1728 as amended is enacted, by far the
 largest part of these funds will go to big corporate awardholders like EXXON
 and ITT, leaving a substantial portion of my loss-and the losses of all indi-
 vidual awardholders--uncompensated.
 As you also know, corporate awardholders (whose losses in any event amounted
 to only small fractions of their total assets) have already recovered a con-
 siderably larger percentage of their loses than individuals, on basis of cor-
 porate tax deductions permitted them in addition to the original War Claims
 Fund payments they received.
 It would therefore, in my thinking, be no more than fair and equitable that
 8. 1728 as amended he made into law, to assist all individual awardholders
 such as myself.

 I received an award for the loss of real property in Germany. but unless S. 1728
 is passed the vast majority of the funds available for payment for this award
 will go instead to big corporate awardholders such as Exxon and IT&T. Since
 the War Claims bund-consisting entirely of cnermy assets seized by the U iited
 States Government during World War II is too small to pay all awards, this
 means that a substantial part of my loss will go uncompensated unless S. 1728 is
 enacted.
 There are two main reasons for the proposed legislation:
 (1)  In contrast to the large corporations who lost a  fraction of their
 corporate assets, individual U.S. citizens who suffered losses, such as myself, lost
 hulnes, personal belongings, and small family businesses. Most of them lost all or
 nearly all they h?ed.
 (2) The corporate awardholders took large tax deductions, under a special
 provision of the Tax Code, as a result of their losses. In(dividuals, however.
 could not take tax deductions for their losses. Thus, between their tax deduc-
 tions and the large payments already made to corporations under the War
 Claims Act. the corporate awardholders have recovered a significantly greater-
 percentage of their loss than have individual 11.S. citizens.

 I hope that S. 1728 will be passed by the House in the near future, and I ask
 you to take an active role in assuring that the Senate will concur in the House
 amendment of S. 1728 when the bill returns to the Senate.
 Thank you for your assistance in this legislation.
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: Please support  Bill S. 1728. I am a U.S. Citizen,
 who has suffered great losses in World War 2. My former residence, personal
 belongings and business interests have all been lost. As a senior citizen I will
 never be able to recoup these losses. Please help me by supporting Bill S. 1728.
 Thank you very much.

 Senator QUENTIN M. BURDICK,                       Cincinnati, Ohio, AugnNt 10, 1974.
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR BURDICK: It is my understanding that the Senate will soon
 receive the War Claims Act of 1948, bill number S. 1728 as amended. I would
 like for the Senate to consider this as soon as possible and to approve S. 1728.
 'This bill originated in the Senate on October 8, 1973. The House Committee
 on Interstate and Foreign Commerce reported this bill on July 3, 1974 and added
 an amendment, previously embodied in two House bills, II.R. 4870 and II.R.
 1729, which would amend the War Claims Act to give individual U.S. citizens
 priority over corporate claimants in further payments of World War II losses.
 The House Rules Committee heard testimony on this issue on July 30, 1974 and
 w^as to consider it on August 6, 1974.
 I need your support on this bill so that payment to U.S. citizens for World
 War II losses can be settled in the near future.
 Corporate claimants took millions of dollars in tax deductions for their losses
 which individual claimants were not able to take.
 My personal interest is a part of Claim W. 9529; decision W. 21512 for a total
 of $70,425 dated May 3, 1907 of which $58,040.33 has been paid. This leaves an
 unpaid balance of $12,384.67.
 This claim is for real estate located in Hamburg, Germany which was bombed
 during the war.
 The
 1943. illy rfather mentioned
 as the admiiistra or of herder by m a ea.nd sp nt onsid w ho died in
 for many years until his death last year in efforts to receive compensation due
 the estate.
 I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping us receive the unpaid
 balance due so that the claim can be settled.
 Sincerely yours,
 WIIITESTONE, N. Y.,
 Senator JAMES O. EASTLAND,                                                   A24?gn?4t 1,, 1971.
 Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,
 Washington, D.C.:
 Urge your support of Senate bill No. S-1728, allowing individual U.S. citizens
 to receive awards for losses suffered in World War II under the War Claims
 Act of 1948.
