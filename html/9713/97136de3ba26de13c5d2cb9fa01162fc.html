 MEMORANDUM FOR:            Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence,
 United States Army
 SUBJECT:                   Lessons from Experience with Aerial
 Surveillance and Target Acquisition in Vietnam
 1.      From 6 August 1964 until 27 August 1965 the under-
 signed served as Chief of the Reconnaissance
 and Photo Intelligence
 Division under the Assistant Chief of Staff, J2, U. S. Military
 Assistance Command, Vietnam (see Annex A for a resume of
 experience involving surveillance and target acquisition during this
 period).  The experience demonstrated that there were a number of
 lessons to be learned that applied to three separate but related
 subjects. These are as follows:
 a.      Techniques of surveillance and, targeting.
 b.      Air-ground doctrine.
 c.      Counterinsurgency doctrine.
 (See Annex B for a discussion of the implications of these lessons on
 Army organization and operating procedures. )
 2.      The undersigned would be pleased to assist in any
 further discussion of these problems by the Army.

 Resume of Experience with
 Aerial Surveillance and Target Acquisition in Vietnam 1964 - 1965
 1.      Turning points in history are nb"lways as clearly
 defined as the battle of Waterloo or the invasion of Normandy.  For
 this reason it might be of use to later historians for us to postulate
 and describe the evidence that suggests that the 13th of November 1964
 might well mark the beginning of the decline of "Wars of National
 Liberation. " On that date ten A-1H fighter bombers belonging to the
 Vietnamese Air Force successfully attacked a small Viet Cong base a
 few miles to the west of Saigon.  This wads the first attack launched
 against guerrilla base areas in South Vietnam on the basis of newly
 developed targeting techniques which have subsequently been used
 with increasing effect to harass the Viet Cong in areas which they
 previously occupied with impunity.
 2.      Many scholars have discussed the interrelationship of
 war and politics.  It is desirable to describe in greater detail certain
 military developments in South Vietnam in order that their full
 political significance may be understood.
 3.      It is well known that the United States Military Assistance
 Command under General William C. Westmoreland and the South

 Vietnamese military establishment have been fighting an enemy whose
 basic strategy is derived from the earlier theories of Mao Tse Tung
 with elaborations devised by General Giap and other Communist
 leaders of the war against the French in Indochina.  According to their
 theory, small guerrilla forces base themselves in remote areas where
 terrain, vegetation, and the lack of communications make it difficult
 for conventional military forces to attack them.  These base areas are
 used as sanctuaries as the guerrilla forces extend their operations into
 more populated areas, and as the guerrillas win support among the
 population, the bases are used for the collection of supplies and as
 training areas for newly recruited guerrilla units.  As the guerrilla
 force' increases in numbers, and as it establishes more reliable sources
 of weapons and ammunition, some of the guerrilla units are converted
 into small regular military units with professional training.  If the
 guerrilla campaign continues successfully, the small regular units
 are pulled together to form larger regular units.   The regular units
 may emerge from the base areas from time to time to engage in
 combat for training purposes as well as to supplement the harassment
 campaign of the guerrilla forces, but in general, great care is
 exercised to avoid committing these regular units to combat in circum-
 stances that might result in the destruction off' the unit.  The campaign

 of guerrilla harassment and the concurrent accretion of regular units
 continues until a regular military establishment has been created
 insufficient strength to enable it to emerge from its base areas and
 destroy the regular military forces of the Government.  (At the end of
 Annex A are selected extracts from an article by Lin Piao, Minister
 of Defense of Communist China, published on
 2 September 1965, which
 shows something of the current Communist attitude toward the war in
 Vietnam and the importance they place on bases in their theory of warfare. )
 4.      The Communists have followed this strategy in South
 Vietnam, beginning about 1960 with a small number of guerrilla forces
 held over from the days of the war against the' French.  The Viet Cong
 established themselves in several large remote areas including the
 notorious War Zones C and D and the Do Xa region.  This guerrilla
 force was expanded rapidly on the basis of captured materiel and the
 guerrillas established themselves in a large number of additional base
 areas of varying sizes.  At the same time, the North Vietnamese began
 to send parties of technicians and organizers and small quantities of
 critical equipment into South Vietnam either by sea or through the
 jungles of Laos.  These cadres began to organize the regular "main
 force" Viet Cong units.  At first in company strength and later in
 battalion strength, these units from time to time emerged from their
 base areas to conduct an ambush, to attack a hamlet, or to overrun

 some small Vietnamese army post.  These operations were usually
 rehearsed in great detail and provided excellent training for the troops
 involved at relatively small risk.  Later, as more regular troops were
 organized, military operations began to involve several battalions and
 a fairly sophisticated degree of staff coordination.  All of these
 attacks added to the disrupting effect of the guerrilla campaign.  The
 recipients of these attacks often could not tell whether they were being
 attacked by guerrilla or regular forces, and the effect was to increase
 the reputation of the guerrillas and to contribute to the idea that the
 guerrilla forces will be the inevitable victor in the struggle with the
 Government.  This idea was reinforced by the examples of the Chinese
 and North Vietnamese successes based on similar strategy.
 5.           There are two glaring weaknesses in the Communist
 strategy.  The first is that regular units engaged in combat against
 conventional forces require crew-served weapons and consume
 tremendous quantities of ammunition while in combat.  This means
 that no matter how Spartan the regular force may be in other respects
 it must have a clearly established source for a reasonably homogeneous
 family of weapons and it must have sufficient ammunition on hand or in
 a well organized pipeline to support combat expenditures.  The second
 weakness is, the dependence of both guerrillas and main force units on

 Annex A
 Approved For Release 200./KWIWKL8502149R000100320002-3
 freedom from attack in their base areas.  The problems of recruiting,
 organizing, and training effective units cannot be solved satisfactorily
 if the unit is under constant harassment. In the case of the Viet Cong
 guerrilla, this situation is compounded by his dependence upon locally
 produced food.  A large proportion of the, time of both guerrilla and
 main force units is devoted to growing food for their own consumption.
 This dependence, on local food commits them to a geographic location
 for an extended period of time.  If they are forced to move, they run
 the risk of losing the food in which they have already invested a
 considerable effort and which they must have to support their future
 operations.
 6.      These considerations led General Westmoreland in
 mid-1964 to order the development of a campaign of harassment directed
 against Viet Cong areas.  This was no easy problem since the Viet Cong,
 being aware of the importance of their base    as, had gone to great
 lengths to conceal and camouflage their activities.  Each military
 problem, however, has to be solved as it occurs.     Just as the British
 learned to combat the German submarines in World War I and the United
 States Cavalry learned to fight the Plains Indians in the 1870s, it was
 necessary to learn how to solve this new military problem.  This was
 finally done by combining old and established intelligence techniques

 with new methods of reconnaissance to pinpoint the location of Viet Cong
 activity.
 7.      The basic principle of this new
 method of identifying
 targets is to use basic area coverage of conventional black and white
 photography as the focal point for organizing information from other
 sources in order that information which indicated current Viet Cong
 activity might lead the image interpreter to the photography most likely
 to reveal the location of the Viet Cong unit, camp, or base that could be
 attacked.  The principal sources of information concerning current
 Viet Cong activity were:
 a.      Airborne radio direction finding.
 b.      Infrared reconnaissance.
 c.      Reports of aircraft hit by enemy ground fire.
 d.      Reports of visual contact with the Viet Gong
 from aerial surveillance and ground force elements.
 In all cases it is necessary to identify the location of the reported Viet Cong
 activity in the conventional black and white photography and interpret the
 photography to identify the point at which an attack by air strike or
 artillery would be most likely to hit the Viet Cong.  This new method
 of target selection was first used on 13 November 1964.  During the
 following months it was tried on other occasions and while not infallible

 proved to be a great improvement over previous procedures.         Sufficient
 confidence was established in the new methods to justify a great
 expansion in the number of aircraft used in attacks against the Viet Cong.
 By February 1965 large numbers of U. S. aircraft were being committed in
 this campaign in support of the limited resources of the Vietnamese
 Air Force.  Many Viet Cong base areas were attacked for the first time
 since the beginning of the Viet Cong insurrection.
 8.   As in most strategic bombing campaigns, the effects of
 this program are cumulative, and for some time even the Viet Cong
 appeared to have been unaware that something new and different was
 happening to them.  As time went by, however, it became more and
 more obvious that the campaign was achieving significant results.
 This was reflected first in the complaints of Viet Cong prisoners who
 expressed fear of air attack.  The prisoners also began to complain
 of the lack of food and the numbers of prisoners themselves, as well
 as an increase in the number of defectors, began to reflect the
 increased pressure caused by the campaign.  In most cases it is not
 possible to check the results of these air strikes immediately on the
 ground because they are conducted against targets in remote areas.
 In many cases, however, stories eventually filter out through the
 grapevine telling of the numbers of Viet Cong killed at such and such
 a place on such and such a date.  These stories not only provide

 useful information concerning the effects of the campaign but they
 also tarnish the myth of final Viet Cong victory.  This in turn increases
 the difficulty of the Viet Cong in getting support from the populace.
 9.      In June 1965 the campaign was reinforced by the
 introduction of B-52 bombers.     These airplanes, although designed
 for a different purpose, have a unique capability for laying down a
 heavy pattern of bombs, and this pattern bombing is an ideal method
 of attack against Viet Cong installations scattered in heavy jungle.
 10.     Throughout the campaign General Westmoreland and
 his staff have been constantly aware of the effects of this campaign
 on the uncommitted civilian population.  Fortunately, the great
 majority of targets are, by Viet Cong choice, in remote areas where
 there is little civilian population.  Extreme care has been used to see
 that civilian villages are not hit.   Strikes are conducted under the
 control of Forward Air Controllers who fly in light aircraft close to
 the target to make sure that the strikes are placed on the target and
 not against peaceful villages.  The press has mistakenly associated
 civilian casualties with this large scale campai   against the Viet Cong
 base areas.  Unfortunately, since the beginning of the war civilians
 are and have been killed or injured by bombs from aircraft as well
 as by bullets and shells from rifles, machine guns, and mortars.

 The great majority of these casualties occur in conjunction with
 fighting between units on the ground.  Aircraft are often called in to
 provide close support to Vietnamese and U. S. forces engaged against
 the Viet Cong.  Even though these attacks are directed by a Forward
 Air Controller, it is sometimes impossible to avoid causing civilian
 casualties in these circumstances.
 11.     The United States and Vietnames Air Forces are
 conducting a strategic campaign against the Viet Cong that may well
 result in the complete disruption of the Viet Cong base system that
 has been developed over the past five years.  If this is the result of
 the campaign, small groups of Viet Cong guerrillas can probably
 continue to operate, but in the long run it will probably be impossible
 for the Viet Cong to continue to maintain their Main Force units intact.
 This will have the effect of cutting off the logical progression from
 guerrilla unit to regular army envisaged in the doctrine of "Wars
 of National Liberation. " Once that stage has been reached the
 counterinsurgency doctrine developed by the United States, involving
 political and economic action in conjunction with police and other
 local security measures, should eventually be able to restore South
 Vietnam to sufficient. stability to enable the South Vietnamese people
 to make progress in developing their natural resources and restoring
 the damage caused by the Communists.

 12.     If this is the result of current U. S. efforts in Vietnam,
 we will have broken the myth of infallibility of the Mao technique.
 More important, however, we will have demonstrated the basic flaw
 in the theory.  We will have demonstrated that guerrilla forces cannot
 establish themselves in invulnerable base areas and we will have
 developed techniques that will permit ourselves and our friends to
 hunt down the guerrillas if any should be so foolish as to attempt this
 type of warfare.  It is interesting to speculate concerning the fate of
 history if this technique had been developed earlier.  Castro's small
 forces in eastern Cuba, for example, might well have been wiped out
 in 1958 and the war in Malaya might well have ended much sooner.

 On the basis of this analysis Comrade Mao Tse-tung formulated the
 strategy for a protracted war.  China's war of resistance would be
 protracted and prolonged efforts would be needed to gradually weaken
 the enemy's forces and expand our own so that the enemy would change
 from being strong to being weak and we would change from being weak
 to being strong and accumulate sufficient strength finally to defeat him.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out that with the change in the balance
 of forces between the enemy and ourselves the war of resistance would
 pass through three stages, namely, the strategic defensive, the
 strategic stalemate, and the strategic offensive.  The protracted war
 was also a process of mobilizing, organizing, and arming the people.
 It was only by mobilizing all the people to fight a people's war that the
 war of resistance could be persevered in andlthe Japanese aggressors
 defeated.
 To rely on the peasants, build rural base areas, and use the countryside
 to encircle and finally capture the cities--such was the way to victory in
 the Chinese revolution.
 Since China's key cities have long been occupied by the powerful
 imperialists and their reactionary Chinese allies, it is imperative for
 the revolutionary ranks to turn the backward villages into advanced,
 consolidated base areas, into great military, political, economic, and
 cultural bastions of the revolution from which to fight their vicious
 enemies who are using the cities for attacks on the rural districts,
 and in this way gradually to achieve the complete victory of the
 revolution through protracted fighting; it is imperative for them to do
 so if they do not wish to compromise with imperialism and its lackeys
 but are determined to fight on, and if they intend to build up and temper
 their forces, and avoid decisive battles with a powerful enemy while
 their own strength is inadequate.
 Experience in the period of the second revolutionary civil war showed
 that, when this strategic concept of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's was
 applied, there was an immense growth in the revolutionary forces and
 one Red base area after another was built.  Conversely, when it was
 violated and the nonsense of the "left" opportunists was applied, the
 revolutionary forces suffered severe damage, with losses of nearly
 100 percent in the cities and 90 percent in the rural areas.

 During the war of resistance against Japan, the Japanese imperialist
 forces occupied many of China's big cities and the main lines of
 communication,' but due to the shortage of troops they were unable to
 occupy the vast countryside, which remained the vulnerable sector of
 the enemy's rule.  Consequently, the possibility of building rural
 base areas became even greater.  Shortly after the beginning of the
 war of resistance, when the Japanese forces surged into China's
 hinterland and the Kuomintang forces crumbled and fled in one defeat
 after another, the Eighth Route and New Fourth armies led by our
 party followed the wise policy laid down by Comrade Mao Tse-tung
 and boldly drove into the areas behind the enemy lines in small
 contingents and established base areas throughout the countryside.
 During the eight years of the war, we established 19 anti-Japanese
 base areas in northern, central, and southern China.  With the
 exception of the big cities and the main lines of communication, the
 vast territory in the enemy's rear was in the hands of the people.
 The base areas established by our party became the center of gravity
 in the Chinese people's struggle to resist Japan and save the country.
 Relying on these bases, our party expanded and strengthened the
 people's revolutionary forces, persevered in the protracted war, and
 eventually won the war of resistance against Japan.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung has provided a masterly summary of the
 strategy and tactics of people's war.  You fight in your way and we
 fight in ours; we fight when we can win and move away when we can't.
 In other words, you rely on modern weapons and we rely on highly
 conscious revolutionary people; you give full play to your superiority
 and we give full play to ours; you have your way of fighting and we have
 ours.  When you want to fight us, we don't let you and you can't even
 find us. But when we want to fight you, we make sure that you can't
 get away and and we hit you squarely on the chin and wipe you out.
 However superior he may be in technical equipment and whatever tricks
 he may resort to, the enemy will find himself in the passive position of
 having to receive blows, and the initiative will always be in our hands.

 U. S. imperialism relies solely on its nuclear weapons to intimidate
 people.  But these weapons cannot save U. S. imperialism from its
 doom.    Nuclear weapons cannot be used lightly.
 U. S. imperialism has been condemned by the people of the whole
 world for its towering crime of dropping two atom bombs on Japan.
 If it uses nuclear weapons'again, it will be  me isolated in the
 extreme.  Moreover, the U. S. monopoly of nucar weapons has
 long been broken; U. S. imperialism has these weapons, but others
 have them too.  If it threatens other countries with nuclear weapons,
 U. S. imperialism will expose its own country to the same threat.
 For this reason, it will meet with strong opposition not only from the
 people elsewhere but also inevitably from the people in its own
 country.  Even if U. S. imperialism brazenly uses nuclear weapons,
 it cannot conquer the people, who are indomitable.
 However fully developed modern weapons and technical equipment
 may be and however complicated the methods of modern warfare, in
 the final analysis the outcome of a war will be decided by the sustained
 fighting of the ground forces, by the fighting at close quarters on
 battlefields, by the political consciousness of the men, by their
 courage and spirit of sacrifice.  Here the weak points of U. S.
 imperialism will be completely laid bare, while the superiority of the
 revolutionary people will be brought into full play.  The reactionary
 troops of U. S. imperialism cannot possibly be endowed with the
 courage and the spirit of sacrifice possessed by the revolutionary
 people.  The spiritual atom bomb which the revolutionary people possess
 is a far more powerful and useful weapon than the physical atom bomb.
 Vietnam is the most convincing current example of a victim of aggression
 defeating U. S. imperialism by a people's war.  The United States has
 made South Vietnam a testing ground for .the suppression of people's
 war.  It has carried on this experiment for many years, and everybody
 can now see that the U. S. aggressors are unable to find a way of coping
 with people's war.  On the other hand, the Vietnamese people have
 brought the power of people's war into full play in their struggle against
 the U. S. aggressors.  The U. S. aggressors are in danger of being
 swamped in the people's war in Vietnam.  They are deeply worried that
 their defeat in Vietnam will lead to a chain reaction.  They are expanding
 the war in an attempt to save themselves from defeat.    But the more they
 expand the war, the greater will be the chain reaction.  The more they
 escalate the war, the heavier will be their fall and the more disastrous
 their defeat.  The people in other parts of the world will see still more
 clearly that U. S. imperialism can be defeated, and that what the
 Vietnamese people can,do, they can do too.

 Lessons from Experience with
 Aerial Surveillance and Target Acquisition in Vietnam
 1.      PROBLEM
 A.      Several lessons may be learned from Army experience
 in Vietnam which may well affect doctrine, organization, and
 procedures for aerial surveillance and target acquisition.  Most of
 the lessons stem from a need occurring in any war involving ground
 forces to find enemy targets that should form part of the commander's
 knowledge of the enemy situation and which should be considered by
 him for specific attack by:
 1.      Supporting Air;
 2.      Artillery;
 3.      Ground Operations.
 B.      This need has become increasingly important because
 technological developments have made it possible for the enemy to
 strike from greater distances than formerly and to disperse his
 forces for concealment and security to areas far beyond the cognizance
 of front line troops.
 C.      There are a large number of places in the world where
 the U. S.. may conceivably be involved against a guerrilla enemy, and
 the guerrilla, by axiom, seeks to operate in those areas where it is
 most difficult for conventional forces to find him.

 Annex B
 Approved For Release 20011DW'E'IDW02149R000100320002-3
 D.      There is a need, therefore, to develop our techniques
 of reconnaissance to overcome increasing concealment and dispersal
 on the part of the enemy, particularly that which takes advantage of
 natural features such as terrain and vegetation.
 II.     THE ARMY'S ROLE
 A.      The Communists have made an intensive effort in recent
 years to extend knowledge of their guerrilla doctrine.  There have been
 many reports of training schools for guerrilla leaders behind the Iron
 Curtain and in Cuba.  There is considerable evidence that several
 hundred men from all over Latin America have  een trained in guerrilla
 theory and techniques in Cuba.
 B.      Communist-influenced guerrilla or irregular forces
 have been encountered in the Congo, Dominican Republic, and various
 other places in Latin America and Africa.  There is no way to predict
 political developments that might involve the U. S. directly in any of
 these situations, but each of them must be recognized as a potential
 situation in which the U. S. Army may be involved directly or
 indirectly.  The manner of Army involvement conceivably might take
 various forms.  For example:
 1.      The U. S. involvement might be limited to
 covert support. of counterguerrilla forces.  In such
 circumstance it would be necessary to provide aerial
 surveillance and target acquisition elements to operate

 Annex B
 ? Approved For Release 2001/Q,$ 1E'jMAMV     02149R000100320002-3
 under civilian cover.  It would be almost impossible in
 peacetime for any civilian organization to provide
 equipment and personnel, train them, and hold them in
 readiness for contingency use in the event of hostilities.
 In the face of a war of this nature, the Army's role would
 probably be to provide equipment, training, developed
 doctrine and techniques, and trained manpower in support
 of the organization primarily responsible for the conduct
 of covert support to the counterguerrilla forces  (in
 Indonesia, for example).
 2.      It is possible that a situation might develop
 in which the U. S. support against guerrilla operations
 would be desired by the local government but not admitted
 publically because of political repercussions.  In such a
 circumstance it might be desirable to deploy U. S. Army
 elements in uniform under ostensible cover of a training
 mission or some other legitimate military function but
 with the actual mission of conducting .erial surveillance
 and identifying guerrilla targets for attack by friendly
 3.      There is also the possibility that U. S.
 Armed Forces might be involved in a fully overt war
 against guerrilla forces such as that currently under way

 Annex B
 Approved For Release 2001/#9 1"FfWIU?S02149R000100320002-3
 in Vietnam.  In such a situation the Army would require
 aerial surveillance and target acquisition elements to
 use and complement the results of reconnaissance
 performed by the U. S. Air Force elements.
 4.      There is also the'possibility that the U. S.
 may become involved in a war against conventional
 military forces.  There again, it might be necessary for
 U. S. Army aerial surveillance and target acquisition
 elements to use and complement reconnaissance
 performed by the U. S. Air Force elements.
 in.      LESSONS FROM VIETNAM
 A.      On the basis of experience in 'Vietnam, it would appear
 that there is a defect in current doctrine concerning the employment
 of Tactical Air.  According to current doctrine, the area deep behind
 enemy lines is the responsibility of Strategic Air and Tactical Air is
 to be employed to:
 1.    Gain air superiority over the battle area;
 2.      Isolate the battlefield; and
 3.      Provide close support to U. S. ground forces.
 This statement of the responsibilities of Tactical Air sounds compre-
 hensive, but let us examine its implementation in greater detail.
 B.         In carrying out the mission of gaining air superiority,
 part of the Tactical Air Force would be required for employment in
 Approved For Release 2001/08/31 : CIA-RDP78SO2149R000100320002-3
 CONFIDENTIAL
 Annex B
 Approved For Release 2001/O.'i02149R000100320002-3
 an air-to-air role.  In addition, however, strikes against air bases
 and related supporting facilities would be appropriate.  These
 strikes would probably take place behind or in the rear portion of
 the battle area.  It would appear to be appropriate for the air
 component to have the primary responsibility for selecting the
 targets to support this particular activity.
 C.      In carrying out its mission to isolate the battlefield
 (i. e. , interdiction), Tactical Air would be used primarily against
 lines of communication and against targets of opportunity that might
 be discovered as a result of armed reconnaissance.  By the nature
 of the mission a large proportion of the targets attacked would tend
 to be toward the rear of the enemy's combat zone.  Again it would
 appear to be appropriate for targeting for this mission to be
 performed by the Air Force, so long as the interdiction program
 were coordinated with the plans of the ground force commander.
 D.      The targets struck in the course of carrying out the
 close support mission would tend to be near the Forward Edge of the
 Battle Area.    By its nature the strikes in this last category are
 usually delivered as the result of the operations of a request system
 originating with troops on the ground.  Strikes are usually delivered
 against targets that can be seen from the front lines or identified by
 short range reconnaissance assets under the direct control of the
 ground force commander in contact with the enemy.  There is

 relatively little opportunity for preplanned strikes, and there is
 normally no staff element in either the Army or Air Force with
 adequate analytical and imagery interpretation resources to
 systematically develop targets that are in the enemy's combat
 zone but outside of immediate contact with troops at the Forward
 Edge of the Battle Area.
 E.      If the missions described above are plotted out
 schematically, it becomes clear that there is a gap in responsibility
 between the interdiction strikes placed at the rear of the enemy's
 combat zone and the close support missions placed at the front of
 the enemy's combat zone.  Furthermore, no single agency has
 I
 clear responsibility for the conduct of what might be called a
 strategic battlefield campaign employing air strikes, Army missiles,
 and artillery in an integrated program of destruction or harassment
 aimed at enemy forces that may be in the combat zone but which are
 not involved in direct combat with U. S. ground force elements.
 F.      In Vietnam this problem was complicated by the basic
 ground rules for the clearance of air and-artillery strikes, by the
 need to persuade rather than command allied ground force commanders
 to authorize strikes against enemy targets, and by the lack of any
 clear-cut responsibility for developing targets for pre-planned
 strikes.  The problem was solved in part initially by the creation of
 an ad hoc joint organization known as the MACV J2 Target Research
 Approved For Release 2001/08/31 : CIA-RDP78S02149R000100320002-3
 CONFIDENTIAL
 Annex B

 and Analysis Center.  This organization successfully applied both
 new and already established techniques employing aerial photography,
 radio direction finding, infrared reconnaissahce, and collateral
 information to identify a large number of possible Viet Cong targets.
 A large number of these possible targets wer i e attacked by either
 air or artillery and a few were attacked by ground operations.  The
 capabilities of the organization, however, were never fully integrated
 into the Tactical Air Support System because.of the apparent defect
 in doctrine which caused that system to be focused almost entirely
 on the close support mission, with the result that it was organized
 to respond primarily to requests originating with front line troops.
 G.      On the basis of the experience cited above, it would
 appear desirable to have established doctrine reflect the existence
 of a requirement for a Strategic Battlefield mission in addition to
 those already established.  It would also appear to be appropriate
 to assign primary responsibility to ground force elements for
 developing the targets to be attacked in accordance with this campaign.
 It would also appear logical to assign to the ground force commander
 the responsibility for deciding the means to be employed in attacking
 a given target and empower him to direct air attacks against those
 targets deemed by him to be most appropriate to be attacked by
 Tactical Air.

 H.      In addition to the organizational experience cited above,
 the U. S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam also made some
 technical developments in the use of reconnaissance.  It was found,
 for example, that if the results of infrared reconnaissance were
 plotted onto existing recent conventional photography of an area, it
 then became possible to interpret and derive additional significance
 from the conventional photography.  Results of airborne radio direction
 finding were also handled in this manner.  As a result of this experience,
 MACV developed a technique for conducting the various forms of
 reconnaissance so as to concentrate on an area believed to be occupied
 by the Viet Cong so that image interpreters and target analysis
 personnel would be able to establish patterns of Viet Cong activity
 and have a maximum opportunity to identify possible strike. targets
 in the conventional photography.  MACV was able to organize this
 reconnaissance so that infrared missions could be flown in the early
 evening and the results compared with existing black and white
 photography, possible targets identified, target mosaics prepared
 and annotated, and the necessary copies of the target mosaics gotten
 into the hands of the appropriate ground force elements in time to
 permit an air strike to be conducted at daylight the following morning.
 MACV was also able to work out a method by which side-looking radar
 aircraft could be integrated into a quick-reaction strike capability.
 This involved training the radar operator to interpret geographic

 coordinates from the radar film record while in the aircraft.  The
 result of all of these technical developments was to make it possible
 for MACV to conduct a heavy campaign of harassment directed
 against Viet Cong in the general battle area but not directly engaged
 against friendly troops.
 IV.     THE NEED FOR A NEW ORGANIZATION
 If, as stated above, U. S. military doctrine should provide for
 the conduct of a strategic battlefield mission, there also exists a
 requirement for a reconnaissance and targeting organization to
 support such a campaign.  To be effective the reconnaissance program
 must be conducted in such a way that it can identify possible targets
 and put the necessary information and target materials into the hands
 of those responsible for conducting operations in sufficient time to
 enable the targets to be struck before they can move.  This means
 that a number of complicated activities must mesh together with
 absolute precision.  For this reason it is essential that there be created
 a single organization having under its control all of the elements
 required to permit it to carry out its mission oL dentifying possible
 enemy targets and providing the necessary information and targeting
 materials to action elements in the most timely manner possible.
 V.     TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 A.      The first consideration in developing an organization
 for targeting is the requirement for speed.  A targeting operation
 Approved For Release 2001/08/31 : CIA-RDP78S02149R000100320002-3
 CONFIDENTIAL
 Annex B
 Approved For Release 2001 ThZ FMEWEEAMS02149R000100320002-3
 against fixed installations can afford to move at a measured speed
 and with factory-like efficiency.  On the other hand, if the targeting
 operation is being aimed against troops and mobile equipment, the
 system must operate with a speed that will permit the necessary
 attack to be launched in time to catch the troops or mobile forces in
 the locations at which they have been discovered.'  Such speed may
 well require a redundancy of equipment and personnel, and procedures
 that are not efficient in an economic sense.  For example, there must
 be adequate photo processing equipment to process reconnaissance
 film immediately without having to wait in the backlog that would be
 required if the photo processing machine were to be used to its full
 capacity.  In other words, if two or more reconnaissance aircraft
 delivered their film simultaneously, the film should be processed
 simultaneously and not stacked up in some priority sequence to be
 processed by a single machine.  In general, maximum efficiency in
 the use of machinery is inherently incapable of delivering maximum
 speed in a targeting operation.
 B.      One of the critical decisions that has to be made at
 an early point in planning a targeting operation is whether the image
 interpreters will work from prints or transparencies.  This decision
 is influenced by the need for target materialf these are required,
 it will be necessary for the analyst to work on the prints that can be
 used immediately as target materials or provided with the immediately
 Approved For Release 200tMP S JA P73 S02149R000100320002-3
 Annex B
 Approved For Release 200 1/(    I.T  F~UL8S02149R000100320002-3
 available laboratory and reproduction facilities to make it possible to
 produce target materials from transparencies within a matter of
 minutes.  In general, the level of training and experience of the
 average image interpreter'is not good enou   at this point in time to
 enable him to work satisfactorily from a negative.  This is further
 complicated by the fact that targeting may well involve terrain and
 cultures not familiar to the image interpreter and of such complexity
 that months of experience would be required before he would learn
 them thoroughly.  In such a circumstance the interpreter should be
 given all assistance possible.  It seems fairly clear from the
 experience of the past few years in the U.S. intelligence community
 that a duplicate positive can give the image interpreter the best
 chance to perform sound interpretation.  It would seem appropriate,
 therefore, to plan the targeting system around the use of duplicate
 positives as the primary medium for image interpretation.  This in
 turn will have direct consequences in the equipment and procedures
 acquired for the rapid production of target materials.
 C.      If the enemy is conscious of the need for concealment
 and is well trained in camouflage and concealment techniques, it will
 be difficult for the targeting operation to operate on the assumption
 that targets can be selected by direct identification of enemy activity.
 (i. e. , one cannot "acquire" a target.  One must perform an elaborate
 analysis to deduce its probable location).  The more difficult it is to
 Approved For Release 2001/08/31 : CIA-RDP78S02149R000100320002-3
 CONFIDENTIAL
 Annex B
 Approved For Release 2001Miql-I?MN;M7j?S02149R000100320002-3
 see the enemy directly, the more important it is to be able to deduce
 his location by indirect methods.  In general, these indirect methods
 fall into two categories, namely, the use of tchnical sensors and the
 detection of changes in two or more sets of photography that indicate
 enemy activity.  Both of these indirect methods require that the image
 interpreter have on hand recent high quality photographic coverage of
 the areas in which he is looking for enemy activity.  This requirement
 means that the reconnaissance system must be capable of generating
 large quantities of area coverage photography, probably on a continuous
 basis.  This area coverage photography provides the focal point for all
 of the other information that can be brought to bear to detect enemy
 activity and select targets that can be recommended for strike.  This
 is the opposite of the conventional reconnaissance technique that begins
 with the generally known target location and requires relatively small
 area coverage of the known target and its immediately surrounding
 territory.  The basic area coverage photography can be used in the
 indirect identification of targets in the following ways.
 1.      Visual reconnaissance can report probable
 enemy activity at a particular location.  The most recent
 area coverage available can then be studied immediately
 to see if the report of enemy activity' will permit the
 interpreter to put new meaning into the things that he sees
 in the photography.

 CONFIDENTIAL
 Annex B
 Approved For Release 200 @Op'LDCMJFMl S02149R000100320002-3
 2.      Current ad hoc reconnaissance photography
 can be compared with the most recent basic coverage of
 the same area to see if recent changes in terrain, vegetation,
 cultural features, etc. , indicate probable enemy activity.
 3.      The results of radio direction finding can
 be plotted on the most recent area coverage available and
 the photography interpreted to see if the presence of an
 enemy radio at a given location can assist the image
 interpreter to identify the probable location of the unit
 supported by the radio.
 4.     . The results of infrared reconnaissance can
 be plotted on basic area coverage to permit the interpreter
 to discount those infrared returns for which a peaceful
 explanation is evident in the photography, eliminate false
 returns, and to identify those returns which may be
 significant as indicating current enemy activity.
 5.      The results of reconnaissance by side-
 looking radar, particularly those returns detected by the
 Moving Target Indicator, can be plotted on the basic
 area coverage to assist the image interpreter in deriving
 new meaning from the photography. '
 6.      The area coverage also provides a locational
 background against which collateral information from
 Approved For Release 2001/08/31 : CIA-RDP78S02149R000100320002-3
 CONFIDENTIAL
 Annex B
 Approved For Release 20011@$WrDVJAiFM3S02149R000100320002-3
 clandestine agents, prisoner interrogation, and other
 human sources can be indexed to assist the interpreter
 in identifying probable enemy activity in the photography.
 In theory it would be possible for the image interpreter to detect some
 probable enemy targets in spite of camouflage and concealment by
 immediate thorough scan of all area coverage photography obtained.
 In practice, however, the volume of such photography is normally far
 in excess of that which can be handled by the numbers of trained image
 interpreters likely to be available.  While it is highly desirable to scan
 all such photography, the best results can be obtained when other
 information indicating current enemy activity can be used to lead the
 image interpreter to the specific photography that requires intensive
 analysis.
 D.      The reconnaissance and targeting concept outlined above
 contains certain implicit requirements for equipment which must be
 taken into consideration in drawing up the TO&E for the unit
 implementing the concept.. The main considerations are:
 1.      Aircraft.  It is necessary to have
 reconnaissance aircraft capable of providing large
 quantities of photography covering broad areas on the
 ground.  The photography required would generally
 fall between the scales of 1:3, 000 and 1:5, 000.  A
 large format for the photography is desirable to
 simplify the problem of making target materials.

 Annex B
 Approved For Release 20011    II     iRDRY3S02149R000100320002=3
 9x18 format is probably the best, but 9x9 would be
 satisfactory.  In addition, there should be a capability
 to take high quality stereo photography of selected
 smaller areas on an ad hoc basis.  A smaller format is
 satisfactory for this purpose, but the larger format
 would do just as well if adequate stereo quality can be
 obtained.  At' the present time the aircraft most likely
 to perform the broad basic coverage mission are in the
 inventory of the U. S. Air Force.  Suitable aircraft
 performing the ad hoc reconnaissance mission are also
 in the Air Force inventory, but the Army Mohawk can
 also perform this mission and other aircraft within the
 weight limitations of Army aircraft could probably be
 developed to perform this role.  The most suitable
 aircraft for the direction finding rol  appear to be the
 Army L-20 and L-23.  Other aircraft could probably be
 configured to perform the DF mission, but the smaller
 aircraft in the U. S. Army inventory seem to be the
 most suitable.  Light observation of the 0-1 type are
 also necessary to perform visual surveillance.  Most
 of the Army aircraft mentioned above could perform the
 courier role required to deliver target materials and
 photographic prints to ground commanders and forward
 air controllers.

 interruption by the requirement for immediate scan of
 new photography.  There should also be adequate
 enlargers, copy cameras, and photo reproduction
 equipment to permit the rapid production of target
 materials in substantial volume.
 4.      Communications.  in addition to the
 capability to deliver target materials, the unit must
 have its own secure communications to provide
 immediate contact with troop commanders and forward
 air controllers, since much of the information derived
 from the analysis of photography can be reported in
 textual format.  Secure communications are also
 required in order that the unit may receive all available
 intelligence from non-reconnaissance sources in order
 that the unit may be fully informed of the intelligence
 situation and may conduct its search for targets in the
 light of the best information available concerning enemy
 activity.
 E.      Although the unit performing target identification and
 analysis must have all of the collateral intelligence available to assist
 it in its task, the unit will also require additional intelligence support
 and guidance that it cannot perform for itself.  Presumably the
 intelligence component of the next superior headquarters would have

 available to it a more fully rounded understanding of the intelligence
 situation.  There should be a close working relationship between the
 organization performing the targeting function and its superior
 headquarters in order that the targeting organization can focus on
 those areas of most immediate importance to the current military
 situation and the operational plans of the commander.  In addition,
 there is likely to be intelligence of such sensitivity that it cannot be
 made available directly to the targeting organization. The higher
 headquarters must assume the responsibility of integrating such
 sensitive intelligence and providing guidance to the targeting
 organization in the light of the resulting knowledge.
 F.      Inasmuch as the identification of possible enemy targets
 involves a number of highly technical considerations not understood by
 the average field commander or staff officer,
 it is important that the
 targeting organization have adequate competent liaison personnel to
 maintain contact with field headquarters and strike elements being
 supported in order to explain the rationale behind the selection of
 specific targets and to assist the supported units in preparing plans for
 attacks against the targets identified.
 VI.    ARMY AVIATION BATTALION,  AERIAL SURVEILLANCE
 AND TARGET ACQUISITION (ASTA)
 A.      It is proposed that the Army provide for an integration
 of aerial surveillance and the analysis necessary to identify concealed

 targets by organizing an Army Aviation Battalion, Aerial Surveillance
 and Target Acquisition (ASTA) in accordance with the following
 mission:
 To support the ground force commander by identifying
 targets for attack by air strike, artillery, or ground forces
 in the following situations:
 a.      As the sole aerial surveillance
 element in operations against guerrilla or other
 irregular forces;
 b.      As the U. S. Army aerial
 surveillance element cooperating with comple-
 mentary USAF reconnaissance elements in
 operations against guerrilla or other irregular
 forces;
 c.      As a U. S. Army aerial surveillance
 element cooperating with complementary U. S. Army
 surveillance and USAF reconnaissance elements in
 conventional military operations.
 B.       It is proposed that the ASTA battalion be organized as
 shown on the attached following chart:

 C.      The ASTA battalion should be under the operational
 control of the intelligence division of the principal headquarters
 responsible  for the conduct of operations in the combat zone.  This
 would permit the commander to insure proper coordination between
 intelligence and operations within his own staff.  It would also fix
 responsibility for the conduct of an aggressive intelligence program
 leading to the identification of enemy targets, and would provide a
 means by which the commander could influence the course of the
 war above and beyond the influence that could be exerted through
 conventional ground operations.
 D.      It is important to fix responsibility for targeting for
 the following reasons:
 1.      To assure initiative in the analysis of
 intelligence information for the purpose of identifying
 targets.
 2.      To allocate assets to the task of target
 identification in a rational manner.
 3.      To provide an advocate at the staff level
 to represent a strategic battlefield campaign when deciding
 upon the allocation of strike forces.
 4.      To develop technical expertise and doctrine
 for the execution of an important and complex mission.

 Approved For Release 200lMiSFIXtLNAMWMS02149R000100320002-3
 E.      Not only is it necessary to fix the responsibility for
 targeting, but it is also necessary to have a specialized organization
 carry out this function for the following reasons:
 1.      To provide for the necessary technical
 expertise and technical equipment required in the
 conduct of analysis leading to target identification.
 2.      To minimize friction between the
 collection, processing, and analytical phases of the
 cycle which results in target identification.
 .3.      To reduce the time involved in target
 identification to an absolute minimum to make it
 possible for the techniques to be employed against
 enemy forces that may move from their present
 location with no prior warning.
