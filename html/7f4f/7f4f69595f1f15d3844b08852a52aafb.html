 A nationwide cease-fire-the first step
 in implementing the Syrian-Palestinian
 accord concluded on July 29-was finally
 arranged late this week by Arab League
 mediators in Beirut. The accord, which
 also calls for roundtable negotiations and
 Palestinian adherence to the 1969 Cairo
 agreement regulating fedayeen activities
 in Lebanon, has won only lukewarm sup-
 port from the other major warring parties.
 Lebanese leftists and radical fedayeen
 have scored the agreement for failing to
 include a Syrian pledge to withdraw from
 Lebanon and have urged PLO chief Yasir
 Arafat to repudiate it. The Christians,
 fearful that Syria may have reached a
 secret  understanding with the
 Palestinians, are insisting that the
 fedayeen adhere to even more stringent

 restrictions than in the past.
 Despite leftist pressure, Arafat would
 clearly like to end his feud with the
 Syrians and seems to be trying to make
 the agreement work. The Palestinians
 sent their principal negotiator, Faruq
 Qaddumi, back to Damascus this week to
 help work out the terms of a general
 cease-fire.
 Damascus, in turn, has urged the
 Christians to abide by the accord. The
 Syrians particularly pressed Camille
 Shamun to permit the evacuation this
 week of some of the more than 1,000
 wounded Palestinians trapped in the Tall
 Zatar refugee camp.
 Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam may
 go to Beirut soon to help oversee the truce
 accord. If he does go, it could reflect a
 Syrian decision to put more direct
 pressure on the Christians to observe the
 cease-fire terms.
 The Syrians, however, are probably still
 skeptical that Arafat will live up to his end
 of the bargain. They have made no move
 yet to pull back from Sawfar on the
 Beirut-Damascus road, which the Pal-
 estinians claim the Syrians promised to
 do. Instead, Damascus has been rearm-
 ing the Christians. Earlier this week the
 Syrians attacked the village of Rum, an
 important Palestinian-held position
 between Jazzin and the port of Sidon
 where the leftists and Palestinians con-
 tinue to receive a steady flow of
 "volunteers" and arms shipments by sea
 via Libya and Egypt.
 The Syrians also tried to drive a wedge
 between the Palestinians and Egyptians
 by unilaterally inserting a preamble into
 the Syrian-Palestinian accord blaming the
 second Sinai agreement between Egypt
 and Israel for the war in Lebanon. Arafat
 quickly dissociated himself from the
 preamble. The Syrian maneuver appears
 only to have reignited the propaganda
 battle between Damascus and Cairo.
 Stung by the charge, Cairo has accused
 Syria of trying to annihilate Palestinian
 and leftist forces in Lebanon and of con-
 spiring with the Israelis in a plot to
 SYRIA
 The appointment of Major General
 Abd Ar-Rahman Khulayfawi as Syria's
 new prime minister reflects President
 Asad's confidence in his domestic position
 and in his foreign policies, especially
 toward Lebanon.
 The former prime minister, Mahmud
 al-Ayyubi, had offered to resign after los-
 ing his party post in elections last year.
 Asad, however, believed that those who
 were seeking to unseat Ayyubi were in
 fact working to limit his own power, and
 he refused to replace the prime minister in
 order to avoid any appearance of yielding
 to pressures.
 With Syrian troops now entrenched in
 Lebanon and domestic political and
 security problems apparently under con-
 trol, Asad presumably concluded that his
 position was strong enough to go ahead
 with the cabinet change.
 Khulayfawi is expected to announce a
 list of cabinet members late this week.
 Several key ministers are likely to retain
 their positions, underscoring Asad's in-  25X1
 tention to continue his present policies. 25X1

 Khulayfawi is a long-time confidant of
 the President. He was a key supporter
 when Asad took power in 1970, and
 served as minister of interior and prime
 minister until ill health forced him to
 resign in late 1972. Well-regarded in both
 party and military circles, Khulayfawi is a
 strong, pragmatic administrator.
 Syria's Baath Party newspaper has
 suggested that Khulayfawi will draw on
 his wide experience in dealing with
 domestic issues,   concentrating on
 economic and financial problems. This
 would better enable Asad to maintain his
 focus on foreign affairs.
 Like his predecessor, Khulayfawi is a
 member of Syria's orthodox Sunni
 Muslim majority. His selection preserves
 the regional and confessional balance in
 Asad's regime. The President and many
 of his supporters in the army belong to the
 small Alawite Muslim sect, centered in
 Syria's   coastal   region.  F_
 Parliament this week began debate in
 preparation for confidence votes in the
 senate and chamber on Prime Minister
 Andreotti's Christian Democratic minori-
 ty government. Andreotti's government
 will almost certainly be approved, but it
 will be the first under the 1948 constitu-
 tion to depend for its survival on Com-
 munist cooperation in parliament.
 The vote will be taken in the senate this
 week and in the chamber next week. An-
 dreotti must receive a majority from-those
 voting in each house to complete the in-
 stallation of his government, which was
 sworn in by President Leone on July 30.
 Because none of the major parties will
 join the Christian Democrats in voting af-
 French Territory of the Afars and Issas
 A refusal by one of the principal
 political parties in the French Territory of
 the Afars and Issas to participate in a new
 government has frustrated French efforts
 to form a broad-based regime to lead the
 territory to independence.
 The legislative assembly elected Ab-
 dallah Khamil Mohamed on July 29 to
 serve as president of the new government.
 Ali Aref Bourhan, the former president,
 had resigned in mid-July after losing the
 support of a majority of the assembly's
 members.
 Khamil, an Afar tribesman who had
 been secretary of the territory's govern-
 ing council under Aref, was elected by
 only 24 of the assembly's 40 deputies.
 Sixteen members of Aref's National
 Independence Union walked out of the
 assembly session without voting.
 Khamil's ministerial appointments in-
 cluded two members of the African
 People's Independence League, a
 predominantly Issa party. The League has
 steadily gained strength over the past year
 as a rallying point for Aref's opponents,
 but it has no seats in the legislative
 assembly. The other ministers are former
 supporters of Aref in the legislative
 assembly who broke with the ex-president
 because they believed he was practicing
 divisive ethnic politics.
 France had hoped to form a broad co-
 alition government capable of withstand-
 ing efforts by Somalia, aided by its sup-
 porters in the territory, to annex the
 territory. The refusal by Aref's party to
 support Khamil increases the likelihood
 of instability as the FTAI approaches in-
 dependence.
 Aref contends that the Independence
 League is simply a stalking horse for
 Somalia. The League receives financial
 support from Somalia, and militant
 members support union with it, but the
 French are hoping that the inclusion of
 the League in the government will
 strengthen the position of party members
 who favor genuine independence.
 firmatively, Andreotti will need Com-
 munist abstention to survive the votes.
 Although the Communists have been
 hinting that they would abstain, the party
 did not officially agree to do so until An-
 dreotti presented his program in parlia-
 ment late this week. The Communists had
 earlier commented positively on the way
 Andreotti drew up his program-he in-
 cluded the Communists and organized
 labor in the consultations-and on the
 composition of his cabinet, which ex-
 cludes Christian Democrats accused by
 the Communists of corruption or in-
 competence.
 The Communists were probably en-
 couraged to abstain also by the enhanced
 influence they will acquire as the pivotal
 party in the installation of Andreotti's
 government. Once the Communists ab-
 stain,  the Christian  Democrats-with
 135 seats in the senate and 262 in the
 chamber-will be able to muster a majori-
 ty regardless of how the remaining parties
 vote. The Communists will clearly have to
 be consulted on any major government
 programs and will cite their new role as
 evidence that Italy cannot be governed
 without Communist cooperation.
 In drawing up his cabinet, Andreotti
 has sought to freshen the Christian
 Democrats' image by including more new
 faces and technocrats than any recent
 government. Eight of his 21 ministers are
 new, including Italy's first woman cabinet
 officer. For the first time in years, no
 former prime ministers, other than An-
 dreotti, are included in the cabinet.
 Andreotti, meanwhile, received some
 encouragement from abroad this week
 when visiting French Justice Minister
 Lecanuet  conveyed the  French
 government's willingness to support An-
 dreotti's efforts to deal with Italy's
 economic problems. Lecanuet did not
 publicly specify what form French sup-
 port might take.
 Currency Reserves  ;
 Since the elections in June, Italy has in-
 creased its foreign currency reserves by
 $1.12 billion through lira sales and repaid
 all of the $500 million drawn on its swap
 facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of

 New York.
 Major factors influencing the increase
 in reserves appear to be the Christian
 Democrats' retention of a plurality in the
 general election, the prior deposit scheme,
 and the normal influx of summer tourists.
 An expected extension of the amnesty per-
 mitting the return of capital illegally ex-
 ported is also likely to encourage the
 return of funds.
 The import deposit plan has absorbed
 liquidity and stabilized the exchange rate.
 The scheme, which requires a 50-percent
 noninterest-bearing deposit on most
 foreign purchases, has been extended
 three months. The high interest rates in
 Italy have also helped the lira.
 The exchange market intervention that
 has accompanied the reserve increases has
 kept the lira, which closed at 834.9 to the
 dollar on August 4, remarkably stable
 since the elections. In the last week, the
 Italian currency has not varied by more
 than one lira from the rate of 835.5 to the
 dollar; nor has it varied from the 834 to
 840 range since the beginning of July.
 Italian authorities have intervened in
 order to obtain reserves and to avoid
 greater lira appreciation that could hurt
 exports.
 The lira still faces an uncertain future.
 The $2 billion gold-backed credit granted
 by West Germany is due in September.
 While no decision on repayment has been
 made, Italy may pay back $200 to $500
 million in order to make it easier to
 renegotiate the loan and to avoid having
 to pledge more of its gold reserves as
 collateral to counter the fall in gold prices.
 The lira's prospects will be clouded by
 uncertainties over the durability and
 economic programs of the new govern-
 ment, as well as by the high rate of in-
 flation-currently at a 20 to 22 percent
 annual rate, more than double the average
 rate of Italy's major trading partners.
 USSR-CSCE
 Moscow marked the first anniversary
 of the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe with a spate of ar-
 ticles proclaiming full Soviet compliance
 with-and Western violation of-the
 provisions of the final act. Moscow
 emphasized its role in bringing about the
 CSCE and what it sees as its major ac-
 complishments: the establishment of the
 principles of the inviolability of frontiers
 and noninterference in the internal affairs
 of others, and its contribution to
 "detente."
 The Soviets claim that they have im-
 plemented the provisions of Basket III,
 citing the relaxation of exit visa
 procedures, increased sales of Western
 newspapers, improved working conditions
 for foreign journalists, and removal of
 some travel restrictions for Western
 businessmen. In general, however, they
 have limited their discussion of Basket
 III,  concentrating instead on  other
 evidence of their compliance with the final
 act:   broader  political   contacts;
 Brezhnev's proposal for a European con-
 ference on the environment, transporta-
 tion, and energy; and the advanced notice
 they gave of two military exercises.
 The Soviets contend it is the West that
 has failed to comply with the final act.
 There is greater use of Western cultural
 materials in the Soviet Union than vice
 versa, Moscow asserts, and a large
 number of foreign visitors have come to
 the CEMA countries.
 Moscow attacks the West for:
 ? Interfering in the internal affairs
 of the USSR and other countries, such
 as Italy.
 ? Subversive, anti-Soviet activities
 of Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty.
 ? Continuing  to  deploy  new
 weapons systems.
 ? Increasing defense expenditures.
 The Warsaw Pact countries are using
 the anniversary to repeat standard themes
 on CSCE, but some differences in
 emphasis are detectable. Warsaw's com-
 mentaries skirt the issue of free exchange
 of ideas. Prague, in a somewhat more
 vigilant tone, reiterates that it will not
 allow "ideological subversion" against the
 socialist  states.  Bucharest drones on
 about the principles of nonintervention
 and sovereign equality applying equally to
 all CSCE states. The Yugoslavs point to
 the tough tasks ahead before real security

 During demonstration in Barcelona earlier this year, marchers demand amnesty for political prisoners
 SPAIN
 The amnesty decree issued by King
 Juan Carlos late last week is a positive
 step toward the national reconciliation
 promised by Prime Minister Suarez. The
 initial reaction of opposition leaders and
 the press has been favorable, although
 some criticized limitations in the decree.
 The amnesty is intended to boost the
 government's political reform program by
 enlisting the support of the previously il-
 legal democratic opposition parties. These
 parties have been vociferous in their
 demands for a complete amnesty. Now
 that the government has responded with
 the decree, talks which Suarez has begun
 with  opposition leaders about the
 government's plans for reform should be
 facilitated.
 The amnesty will free many of Spain's
 remaining political prisoners and restore
 civil rights to the Republicans who fought
 against  Franco in the Civil War.
 Estimates of the number of political
 prisoners affected by the decree vary
 because implementation will be left to the
 courts and the exact number will not be
 known until all cases are reviewed.
 When the amnesty was announced, the
 minister of justice estimated their number
 at some 200-a figure considerably less
 than the 600 who are believed to be in
 prison for political reasons. The US em-
 bassy later reported that more than 400
 are likely to be freed.
 The amnesty covers all political crimes,
 such as participation in previously illegal
 political meetings and distribution of
 propaganda.
 Specifically  excluded  are  persons
 convicted of terrorism causing death or
 injury and workers charged with organ-
 izing or taking part in politically moti-
 vated strikes.
 The government had difficulty over-
 coming the opposition of conservative
 senior officers to including the military in
 the amnesty, according to a Madrid of-
 ficial.
 The nine officers convicted earlier this
 year of subversion because of member-
 ship in the clandestine Military Dem-
 ocratic Union will be released but for-
 bidden to return to military service.
 Jailed conscientious objectors will also be
 freed, and armed forces members who
 fought against Franco in the Civil War
 will  become eligible for pensions.
 A substantial share of Cuba's trade
 with noncommunist countries has gone to
 US subsidiaries since the partial lifting of
 the US embargo in August 1975.
 In the past 10 months, Cuba has award-
 ed these firms sales contracts totaling
 $293 million-the equivalent of one fifth
 of Cuba's estimated noncommunist im-
 ports last year. About 60 percent of sales
 have involved agricultural commodities.
 Some 85 percent of the business went to
 US subsidiaries in countries such as
 Canada and Argentina, which are already
 among Cuba's large trading partners.
 Purchases from Cuba by US subsidiaries
 thus far have been limited to about $2-

 JAMAICA
 Opposition Jamaica Labor Party leader
 Edward Seaga apparently has backed
 away from a threat made privately last
 month to pull out of the coming national
 election  because of the government's
 partisan enforcement of the state of
 emergency.
 In mid-July he told the US ambassador
 that the Labor Party could not win under
 existing conditions and that a decision on
 whether to remain in contention would be
 made at a party meeting on July 25. Now,
 buoyed by a recent successful campaign
 swing, Seaga says that he thinks his party
 might still be able to win a "fair" election
 notwithstanding the state of emergency.
 He fears, however, that harassment of his
 party will intensify as the election-which
 must be held by next May-draws near.
 Seaga's concern is warranted. The
 potential for uncontrolled violence in
 response to government provocation
 poses a major threat. Labor Party leaders
 have so far taken pains to keep their
 gunmen on a short leash; even the arrest
 of deputy  party  leader  Pearnel
 Charles-who remains in prison-did not
 provoke retaliatory action.
 The People's National Party headed by
 Prime Minister Michael Manley and the
 Labor Party traditionally have employed
 violence to aid their cause. There is every
 reason to believe that in the key "swing"
 districts, the use of force will be more
 savage than ever. Already the security
 forces-even with all reserves on
 duty-are stretched thin and morale is
 low. It is doubtful that they will be able to
 maintain order if violence escalates and
 spreads beyond Kingston.
 Meanwhile, Cuba and Jamaica have
 continued a high level of interchange in
 the past few weeks on a broad range of
 issues. For the second year, Cuban
 Political Bureau member Juan Almeida
 headed a delegation that participated in
 Jamaica's independence celebration on
 August 2. There has been close contact all
 summer between top officials of Manley's
 party and a section of the Cuban Com-
 munist Party staffed by personnel respon-
 sible in the 1960s for efforts to export
 Cuba's revolution.
 Seaga claims that the chief of this
 party section-who in the 1960s headed
 Cuba's General Directorate of Intelligence
 -will visit Jamaica in early August. In ad-
 dition, the first contingent of Jamaican
 youth that spent the past year in Cuba
 studying construction techniques returned
 home at the end of July. The 183 mem-
 bers were hand-picked by Minister of
 BRAZIL     C'
 Brazil's trade deficit fell to $1.3 billion
 during the first six months of 1976 com-
 pared with $1.8 billion in the same period
 last year.
 Exports should increase about 16 per-
 cent in the second half of this year, com-
 pared with 5 percent in the first half, for
 an overall 11 percent for the year. The
 trade deficit for the year should be 60 per-
 cent lower than last year.
 Despite rising interest payments on
 foreign debt, the improved trade balance
 is likely to reduce the current-account
 deficit to $5 billion for the year-down
 nearly $2 billion from 1975.
 After a slow first quarter, caused by
 reduced sugar sales, export earnings are
 picking up rapidly this year. Foreign sales
 in June climbed to $1 billion, a record
 high monthly total.
 A record value of coffee exports made
 up nearly one third of the total. Sharply
 rising world coffee prices contributed to
 the jump. Increased soybean sales also
 were a factor in Brazil's record June trade
 performance.
 Stringent import controls are an impor-
 tant factor in the trade improvement.
 Government  organizations,  which  ac-
 count for nearly half of all imports, have
 been ordered to cut purchases abroad by
 25 percent this year. In addition, the re-
 quirement for a noninterest-bearing ad-
 vance deposit with the Central Bank
 equivalent to the value of an import has
 been expanded to cover nearly one third
 of Brazil's imports.
 Overall import volume, already down
 about 4 percent in the first six months, is
 unlikely to exceed 90 percent of the 1975
 level.
 Record harvests for some crops and a
 revival of industrial output prompted by
 strengthened consumer demand in the
 first half of the year should raise Brazil's
 real economic growth rate slightly-to 5
 percent-in 1976 despite import restric-
 tions. This recovery still leaves the coun-
 try well below the 10 percent annual
 avera e of the boom period of 1968 to
 1974.

 Tension and uncertainty pervade the
 ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with
 Japanese prosecutors now poised to arrest
 additional politicians and officials im-
 plicated in the Lockheed affair. Following
 the dramatic arrest of former prime
 minister Tanaka early last week, specula-
 tion centered on LDP Secretary General
 Nakasone as the next major figure to be
 named.
 Prime Minister Miki has not said
 whether he would follow tradition by
 resigning if a senior party official or
 cabinet member is implicated, but he
 nant denials followed quickly. This week,
 the Socialists returned the favor by reviv-
 ing questions about Miyamoto's involve-
 ment in a pre - World War II murder
 case.
 Meanwhile, an initial public opinion
 sampling has registered strong satisfac-
 tion with the investigation so far, in-
 cluding Tanaka's arrest. At the same
 time, a majority hold the conservatives
 responsible for the affair rather than
 Tanaka as an  individual.  Finally,
 overwhelming majorities of 90 percent or
 more in polls believe that corruption ex-

 change a great deal as a result of the

 Foreign Minister Miyazawa is the architect of Tokyo's
 harder line toward Peking. He has made a number of widely
 publicized remarks that have led to a cooling of Sino-Japanese
 relations.
 Japan-China: Harder Line Toward Peking
 C
 Iq
 T
 After nearly a year of official op-
 timism, Japan has lowered its expec-
 tations and hardened its position in its
 relations with China.
 The changes suggest that in the near
 term, Japan feels under no compulsion to
 conclude a treaty of peace and friendship
 with China and is prepared to accept what
 it probably hopes will be only a temporary
 deterioration in relations with Peking.
 Page  7      WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Miyazawa's Role
 The architect of this shift in Tokyo's
 position is Foreign Minister Miyazawa.
 In widely publicized remarks over the past
 few weeks he has:
 ? Warned the US against any im-
 provements in its relations with China
 that might adversely affect Taiwan's
 security.
 ? Cautioned Peking about the an-
 ti-Soviet statements of Chinese visitors
 in Japan.
 ? Characterized the difference
 between the attitudes of Japan and
 China toward the USSR as the
 primary obstacle to concluding a
 Sino-Japanese peace and friendship
 treaty.
 Although Miyazawa's statements
 reflect views on China policy that
 Japanese government leaders have ex-
 pressed privately, his decision to go
 public-and become a target for Chinese
 wrath-suggests that he is motivated by
 personal as well as broader foreign policy
 concerns.
 Miyazawa is a relatively young and am-
 bitious politician who calculates that his
 remarks will strengthen his position dur-
 ing this period of Liberal Democratic Par-
 ty infighting. Although Miyazawa has
 been regarded as a progressive throughout
 his career, he has long been on good terms
 with Deputy Prime Minister Fukuda, the
 leader of the party's more conservative
 wing. Since becoming foreign minister in
 late 1974, Miyazawa's efforts to mend
 relations with Taiwan and South Korea
 have measurably improved his standing
 with party conservatives.
 Miyazawa may well share the widely
 held view within the party that a
 Fukuda-led government is likely to come
 to power regardless of the political fallout

 from the Lockheed affair. His actions on
 China could strengthen his ties with
 Fukuda by helping lay the groundwork
 for Fukuda's foreign policy; as the next
 prime minister, Fukuda would inherit a
 notably stiffer  policy toward  Peking
 without having to bear the onus for in-
 stituting the change.
 Prime Minister Miki, long hopeful of
 concluding a treaty with Peking, reported-
 ly was upset by Miyazawa's remarks.
 Miki apparently has concluded, however,
 that he is boxed in on the issue by the
 current political balance in his party. In
 discussing Sino-Japanese issues in the
 Diet on July 28, Miki neither overruled
 nor undercut Miyazawa's statements.
 Thus, little forward movement in Tokyo's
 ties with Peking is likely while Miyazawa
 is foreign minister.
 The Treaty Impasse
 Broader considerations also have en-
 couraged the change in Tokyo's outlook.
 The most important has been increasing
 Japanese pessimism over prospects for a
 peace and friendship treaty, which is hung
 up on the anti-Soviet "hegemony" clause
 that Peking insists be included in the pact.
 Despite a consensus in Japan in favor of
 the treaty, Tokyo is concerned that un-
 qualified acceptance of the antihegemony
 principle would publicly identify Japan
 with an overly extreme anti-Soviet
 posture. This sensitivity, combined with
 pressure from more conservative and
 pro-Taiwan members of the Liberal
 Democratic  Party,  has prompted
 Japanese attempts to dilute the an-
 tihegemony formula.
 China's persistent failure to accom-
 modate on this issue, its recent press
 criticism of Miyazawa's position on the
 treaty, and the current leadership struggle
 in Peking have led Tokyo to conclude
 there is little possibility for compromise in
 the near future.
 Taiwan and the US Angle
 Given Japan's pessimistic view of the
 prospects for a treaty, the timing of the
 Sino-US normalization process has
 assumed greater importance in Tokyo.
 Japan is determined to maintain as good,
 if not better, contacts with China than
 does the US, and Miyazawa, concerned
 that the US might formalize ties with
 China before or after the November elec-
 tion, has been cautioning US officials
 since early June about any abrupt change
 in Sino-US relations.
 Miyazawa is not opposed to eventual
 Sino-US normalization or to a new for-
 mat for assuring Taiwan's security. But,
 like others in Tokyo, he regards a US
 guarantee for Taiwan's future as the ma-
 jor issue in the Sino-US normalization
 process. The Japanese have maintained a
 considerable economic stake in Taiwan
 since establishing relations with China in
 1972. In Tokyo's view, a sudden break in
 US relations with the Chinese
 Nationalists might jeopardize Taiwan's
 political stability, threaten Japan's
 profitable trade and investment links with      25X1
 the island, and complicate its relations
 with China.
 A recent article in Peking Review suggests by analogy that
 the left has not made much political headway since Teng
 Hsiao-ping's fall from power.
 China: Problems for the Left
 An unsigned article io  ast month's
 Peking Review has striking parallels with
 the present political situation in China. It
 may indicate that the left has encountered
 substantial difficulty in making further
 gains since Teng Hsiao-ping's fall from
 power.
 In particular, the leftists seem to be ad-
 mitting that they lack support among the
 military and among civilian leaders in the
 provinces and that Mao's withdrawal
 from public life has not helped their cause.
 The article is an update of one publish-
 ed during the anti-Confucius campaign in
 1974 which contained some phrases that
 have a moderate cast. The new version in-
 cludes new material which may refer to
 more recent events, such as Mao's declin-
 ing health, and rewrites a number of
 politically sensitive passages that give the
 article a decidedly leftist thrust.
 Significantly,  both versions contain
 strong attacks on provincial military and
 civilian leaders. The fact that the article
 has thus far been noted only in a foreign
 language journal not readily available in
 China could be an indication of the great
 sensitivity of the subject matter.
 Using historical analogy, the article
 describes a power struggle between
 "reformists" and "conservatives," two
 factions that closely resemble today's lef-
 tists and moderates. The article says that
 conservatives in the national leadership
 controlled access to the emperor (read
 Mao) and ran the government in collusion
 with provincial leaders. The reformists
 were able to chip away at the conser-
 vatives' power by demoting or removing
 some conservatives from office, but ul-
 timately the reformists could not dislodge
 their opponents because they lacked
 military power.
 The article seems to be referring to the
 ouster of Teng Hsiao-ping and possibly
 some of his subordinates, but it also
 suggests that the left cannot make further

 headway without military support.
 Indeed, the support of the military, es-
 pecially of the powerful military region
 commanders, is probably crucial in the
 current power struggle. There is no
 evidence that the majority of the military
 is backing the left.
 The article states that after the refor-
 mists failed to gain the upper hand in the
 national government, the conservatives
 were able to strengthen their own position
 by using the emperor's illness as a pretext
 to force him to abdicate. This appears to
 be an allusion to the party Central Com-
 mittee's decision that Mao will no longer
 meet foreigners because of ill health. It
 suggests that the decision may have been
 motivated by political as well as medical
 considerations and that leftists were not in
 agreement with it. Mao's absence from
 public view certainly makes it difficult for
 the left to use his name as a source of their
 authority. New statements from him sup-
 porting their position-and none have
 appeared since Mao's seclusion-would
 immediately be suspect if only because the
 public has no way of knowing to what ex-
 tent the Chairman is directly able,
 physically or politically, to insert himself
 in the political process.
 The article contends that opposition to
 the emperor has always come.from senior
 provincial leaders rather than from of-
 ficials at lower levels, where there is a
 reservoir of leftist strength. Moreover,
 provincial governors, with the support of
 "haughty soldiers" and "fierce generals,"
 openly defied orders from the national
 government.
 To rectify this situation, the reformists
 in the analogy advocated abolishing
 provincial governorships and appointing
 trustworthy soldiers, thereby turning over
 local administration to lower level of-
 ficials. This seems to be a call to purge
 provincial leaders and regional military
 commanders, most of whom have not
 been enthusiastic about the anti-Teng
 campaign. Abolition of provincial gover-
 norships bears some resemblance to an
 idea floated late in 1974 to break up
 China's 29 provinces into 51 units-a plan
 never implemented.
 The article on two occasions refers to a
 five-month period during which the refor-
 mists enjoyed a measure of political
 power. Once the conservatives regained
 power, high level officials in the reformist
 camp were removed from office. Five
 months is roughly the length of time
 between the naming of Hua Kuo-feng as
 "acting premier" and the publication of
 the article itself. This could be a subtle
 appeal to Hua Kuo-feng to side with the
 left during the current struggle-he thus
 far seems to have avoided firm factional
 alliances-on the grounds that his
 premiership could be short-lived if the lef-
 tists lose out.
 Some Chinese do feel that Teng Hsiao-
 ping could make a comeback because he
 is still a member of the party, Teng's par-
 ty membership seems to be a sore point
 with the left, which has argued for his dis-
 missal from the party. The moderates
 could indeed attempt to bring Teng back
 should Mao die in the near future. A lef-
 tist bid for Hua Kuo-feng's support on the
 grounds that the popular Teng has not yet
 been completely eliminated as a rival
 could have some appeal to the Premier.
 The left has clearly gone out on a limb
 in this article by emphasizing its
 differences not only with civilian but also
 military leaders in the provinces. The arti-
 cle could be read as a near declaration of
 war against these important military
 figures. The peculiarities of publication,
 however, the choice of a foreign language
 journal, and the lack of any reference to
 the earlier version of the article or the
 author suggest some disagreement in the
 leftist camp over the exploitation of the
 most sensitive charges raised in the arti-
 cbe.  Its generally defensive tone,
 moreover, suggests that it may be more a 25X1
 statement of principle than an attempt to
 expand the campaign and may be an ad- 25X1
 mission that the left must establish a
 wider  base  of support.

 The spreading rought in Eastern Europe has hurt harvest
 prospects for this yer, and output will be further reduced if it is
 not broken very soot. Large US grain sales to the region seem
 likely)-
 Eastern Europe: Drought Hurts Harvest
 The spreading drought in Eastern
 Europe has hurt prospects for a record
 grain harvest this year.
 In mid-June, forecasts by the US
 Department of Agriculture placed poten-
 tial output at a record 93 million tons. As
 a result of the continued hot, dry weather,
 we now project this year's grain output at
 about 89 million tons, only slightly better
 than last year's mediocre crop.
 Grain output at this level, coupled with
 a serious reduction in fodder and forage
 crops, suggests that imports of grain in
 the marketing year ending June 30, 1977,
 will remain near the record level of 12
 million tons reached last year. If the US
 retains its market share, exports to
 Eastern Europe may again exceed 6
 million tons, twice the level of the 1973 to
 1974 period.
 Drought conditions are worst in East
 Germany. As of mid-July, soil moisture
 had fallen to less than half of normal. Un-
 til rain fell at the end of July, critically
 low soil moisture levels also had existed in
 western Poland, Czechoslovakia, and
 Hungary. A second drought area centers
 in Romania's main grain producing
 region and extends into Bulgaria. Only
 Yugoslavia has received adequate rainfall.
 Crops there are reported in good condi-
 tion.
 The drought will have the least impact
 on winter grains, reducing output by
 about 5 percent. We expect the winter
 wheat harvest to reach 31 million
 tons-10 percent higher than last year,
 but almost 3 million tons below the record
 crop of 1974.
 Drought damage will be more severe to
 spring-sown grains, and to the fodder
 crops, especially potatoes for feed use.
 Pastures are also hard hit. The corn
 harvest may reach 27 to 28 million tons,
 roughly 5 to 10 percent below last year's
 crop despite a somewhat larger area
 planted this spring.
 Output will be further reduced if the
 drought is not broken very soon.
 Premature harvesting of corn for silage,
 rather than for grain, would lower our
 projection even further.
 Potatoes, important for both food and
 fodder in the northern countries, will be in
 short supply, contributing to the con-
 tinued meat shortages. Fresh vegetables
 and fruits also will fall short of consumer
 needs.
 East German grain production will fall
 for the second year in a row. Dry con-
 ditions have ruled over much of East Ger-
 many since last September, and water
 levels are now so low that some localities
 are being supplied from water trucks. If
 sufficient rains do not fall soon, East
 Germany will have to cope with another
 disastrous potato harvest. Last year, a
 summer drought reduced the potato crop
 by one third.
 Grains in Poland survived the winter in
 good condition, and timely rains fell in
 May to offset a dry spring. The current
 drought is confined to the western and
 southwestern parts of the country.
 Reports from Wroclaw indicate that
 potato and sugar beet crops are stunted
 and reflect concern over premature ripen-
 ing of grain crops. In other areas, where
 summer rainfall has been adequate, cool
 temperatures will delay the start of the
 harvest.
 In Czechoslovakia, grain production
 probably will be held to the 1975 level.
 According to the US agricultural attache,
 additional output from a 5 to 6 percent in-
 crease in winter wheat acreage was
 probably more than offset by damage
 from freezes in early March. Potential
 losses from the drought were moderated
 by light rains in early July. Prospects for
 the corn  harvest  are still  uncertain;
 corn has developed poorly, and more
 rain is needed this month to avoid large
 losses. Good rains still could save the
 potato and sugar beet crops.
 The drought hit Hungary later than
 other East European countries and has
 had a relatively small impact on wheat.
 The moderate rainfall on July 21 and 22,
 covering four fifths of the country, may
 alleviate the situation. The most serious
 damage is to fodder crops, meadows, and
 pastures. The corn crop, more than half of
 grain output, could be damaged if good
 rains do not come soon. Hungarian of-
 ficials already estimate that potential ex-
 port availabilities of wheat and corn may
 be cut by half, or I million tons.
 Severe drought struck southeastern
 Romania in early May. Many wheat fields
 were plowed under and replanted with
 corn, but the continuing drought suggests
 the new effort will not succeed.
 Little information is available on crop
 conditions in Bulgaria. Much of the corn
 is grown on irrigated land which will
 temper the impact of the drought.
 East European countries will have to in-
 crease their purchases in foreign grain
 markets. Among the major importing
 countries,  East  Germany  and
 Czechoslovakia probably will boost their
 grain imports to about 4 million tons and
 2 million tons respectively. Even with
 larger grain imports, East Germany will
 not be able to avoid acute shortages of
 animal feed.

 Polish grain imports will probably be
 less than they were last year, but they may
 run between 4 and 5 million tons, mostly
 wheat and corn. The amount may depend
 on whether Warsaw chooses to import
 meat for immediate consumption or grain
 to support livestock production.
 East European purchases in the West,
 particularly from the US, will depend
 largely on the amount of grain the USSR
 can supply. The USSR has provided in
 the past as much as one half of East
 European grain imports.

 shipments to Eastern Europe because of

 pared with 3 million tons the previous
 crop year. If the USSR supplies a
 minimum amount-around 3 million
 tons-US sales to Eastern Europe could

 EC: Overhaul of Joint Float Proposed
 The Netnertanas proposect a major
 overhaul of the European joint float at
 last week's meeting of European Com-
 munity finance ministers, The proposal
 calls for wider bands on joint-float curren-
 cy fluctuations, more frequent ad-
 justments in central rates, and constraints
 on parity changes for nonparticipating EC
 currencies.
 The Dutch initiative reflected the
 problems encountered in maintaining
 parity between the guilder and the
 stronger West German mark.
 From its beginning in 1972, the EC
 currency band-the "snake"-has been
 beset by problems. Britain and Italy
 dropped out of the arrangement within a
 year of its inception. West Germany has
 twice revalued relative to other float
 currencies. France has left the snake
 twice, most recently in March 1976.
 The snake's chief problem has been its
 inability to cope with differential rates of
 inflation and shifts in short-term interest
 rates among member countries. Bonn's
 success in fighting inflation has made the
 West German mark the strongest curren-
 cy in the band. The heavy intervention
 costs involved in keeping the mark and
 weaker currencies within 2.25 percent of
 one another-and members' resistance to
 additional changes in central
 rates-precipitated the withdrawal of the
 pound, lira, and French franc.
 The truncated snake has continued to
 encounter similar problems. The West
 German inflation rate of 5 percent is
 about half the rates in other participating
 countries. To maintain parity with the
 mark, the smaller member countries have
 been forced to maintain tighter fiscal and
 monetary policies than they would prefer.
 With unemployment ranging from 5.5
 to 8 percent, the governments of Den-
 mark, Belgium, and the Netherlands have
 found  the go-slow economic policies
 politically painful. The Dutch proposal is
 an attempt to dilute float rules sufficiently
 to give the smaller participants an alter-
 native to the disciplined German
 economic policy stance.
 As might be expected, West Germany
 opposes the Dutch proposal on grounds
 that its adoption would further lessen in-
 centives for harmonizing economic
 policies among EC members. The UK
 and Italy also are skeptical. Both have
 rates of inflation well above those in other
 E:C countries and feel they need the flex-
 ibility of floating to pursue domestic
 policy goals.
 Bonn and London succeeded at last
 week's meeting in postponing serious dis-
 cussion of the proposal until October. In
 the meantime, the plan will be studied by
 the EC monetary committee.
 The Hague may be receiving support
 from Paris and from some of the smaller
 joint float countries. The Dutch proposal
 parallels a reform package presented
 earlier this year by France, prior to its
 desertion from the joint float. Many of
 the smaller countries, like the
 Netherlands, have had trouble main-
 taining parity with the strong West Ger-
 man mark and probably favor a more
 flexible system.
 While Bonn has managed to prevail
 against a reform for the time being, the
 Schmidt government probably recognizes
 that maintaining the snake will likely re-
 quire changes in either the operating rules
 or the central rates. On the basis of the
 past West German record, we expect that
 Bonn may opt for a moderate mark
 revaluation, but only after the national
 election in October. Until then, the
 Schmidt government will want to avoid
 charges that it has harmed West Ger-
 many's chances for a sustained economic
