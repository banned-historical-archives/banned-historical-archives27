"The Chinese 
Red Guards 
Don't Know 
Lenin" 
Communist Writings  
Which Communists  
Can't Read  
Briefly Noted V 
TASS on Nov. 19 an-
nounced that a delegation of the 
Soviet-Chinese Friendship Society 
headed by PRAVDA observer V. Mayevsky 
had been forced to cut short its tour 
of China by Chinese provocations and 
insulting, hostile attacks as reported 
in our Propagandist's Guide to WCA, 
#8. IZVESTIYA on the 22nd carries the 
text of a long statement by M. to a 
press conference on the 21st. De-
ploring the senseless "great-Khan 
chauvinism and anti-Sovietism" in Red 
Guard actions to eradicate foreign 
culture, M. says: 
"...The major part of the CR 
Committee at the University have 
been educated in the humanities: 
they are philosophers, lawyers, 
etc.... All of them call them-
selves M-Ls. Nevertheless, dur-
ing the sharp discussion, it be-
came evident that they had only 
the very scantest knowledge of the 
opinions of Marx, Engels, and 
Lenin on culture." 
After the RG stated their criti-
cal view of Beethoven, M. asked them 
what they find "specifically unaccept-
able" in the Appassionata, to which they 
reply: "We have not heard it, but we 
regard it critically." M. comments: 
"The words of Vladimir Ilyich 
Lenin, who called this work an 
amazing, wonderful creation of 
human genius, were a surprise to 
them. They sincerely admitted 
that they did not read Lenin's 
works on proletarian culture 
and that they did not know 
about L's talks with Klara Zet-
kin in which he called the widest 
possible proletarian culture 
could be built and the really 
new and great Communist society 
grow. ...The library collabor-
ators announced: 'Pushkin was 
a non-proletarian writer.' 
Upon our mentioning that V.I. 
Lenin called Piishkin a classic, 
that he valued his works and 
read them again and again, they 
remained silent.... (Etc.)" 
We have long emphasized that the 
Communists are vulnerable where they 
do not -- or are not allowed to --
study their own "classics." Now a 
prominent Communist journalist gives 
assets a fresh peg for new commen-
taries on the subject. Leftist and 
revisionist assets might stress the 
utter incompatability of the parrot-
style learning of Mao's thought with 
real study of Marxist classics, add-
ing that this parrot-learning recalls 
similar practices in Russia under 
Stalin, and that Russia has not yet 
recovered from its own intellectual 
straitjacket. Lenin read Pushkin; 
how many of today's Soviet Commu-
nists have read Kafka?

from the Chinese Communist mission. 
Miao Chen-pal had been thinking about 
this move for some time - in fact, 
he had a suitcase packed for fully a 
week before he saw his chance to make 
a break. And when it came he took the 
suitcase from the shelf above his bed 
and headed straight for the U.S. Em-
bassy in Damascus. In the suitcase 
were two suits, four shirts, a trans-
istor radio and a Chitese-English 
dictionary. He explained that he 
wanted to wear his own clothes and 
be able to study English and find out 
independently what was being said about 
him and his exploit. U.S. officials 
reported that in hotels en route to 
Washington, he even insisted on making 
his own bed. The attachment from U.S. 
NEWS AND WORLD REPORT's 7 November 
1966 issue tells the reader a great 
deal more about this engaging yound 
Chinese. He appears intelligent, 
thoughtful, practical and objective - 
qualities which come through very clearly 
in the attached. It is suggested that 
distribution of the interview in whole 
or part should appeal to an audience 
much wider than that of the youth stu-
dent or intellectual.

Authoritative "What is U.S. Policy, 
Speaker Spells Anyway?" 
Out Answer 
Although our business 
is covert, not overt, 
propaganda, we are often confronted with 
questions from contacts and others as to 
what U.S. policy really is, especially in 
Vietnam. Even friendly people often pro-
fess to be puzzled as to what the U.S. 
is trying to do; less friendly individ-
uals sometimes imply or state openly 
that they doubt that the U.S. knows it-
self what is is doing. Beyond this, 
there is a tendency to think that the 
U.S. lacks confidence in its policy, 
and is unsure whether or not suc-
cess in Vietnam is possible. This 
latter belief in turn encourages 
Hanoi to refuse any curtailment of 
its activities and demands. 
Excerpts from an informal speech 
by W.W. Rostow, given at confer-
ence of educators in Washington, 
16-17 June 1966, and reproduced in 
PRESS COMMENT, 7 February 1967, 
are well-suited to answer these 
questions and doubts. Rostow is, 
of course, the former M.I.T. 
economist and author of many books, 
including STAGES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH 
more recently the chief of the 
Policy Planning Council of the 
Department of State, and now Special 
Assistant to the President, work-
ing in the White House. His 
remarks are clear, authoritative, 
and confident. Particularly note-
worthy is Rostow's emphasis on 
the positive economic goals of 
the U.S. government. 
Rostow's speech is suitable 
for showing to appropriate indi-
vidual contacts or for our own 
background information for use in 
person-to-person discussion. Out-
lets should not in general be 
asked to publish all or portions 
of the speech, but may use it, 
together with other more recent 
information, as background for 
discussions of economic growth, 
development programs, or U.S. 
aims and policies, especially with 
regard to Vietnam. All such pub-
lic discussion, of course, should 
be written or broadcast from a 
point of view appropriate to the 
country in which the outlet is - 
located or to which it addresses 
itself.

1092. THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE: TWENTY YEARS LATER  
SITUATION: 
"This is a serious course upon which we embark. I would 
not recommend it except that the alternative is much more 
serious.... 
25X1 C1 Ob 
The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery 
and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty 
and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a 
people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope 
alive. The free peoples of the world look to us for support 
in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, 
we may endanger the peace of the world - and we shall surely 
endanger the welfare of our own nation." 
President Harry S. Truman, in his 
Message to Congress, March 12, 1947. 
On March 12, 1947, President Truman asked Congress to appropriate 
000,000,000 for economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey. That 
Presidential Message to Congress, more popularly known as the Truman 
Doctrine, signaled the end of American hopes of tranquil relations with 
the Soviet Union. It marked the beginning of the open struggle between 
the free world, led by the United States and communism. 
Before the Potsdam Conference of July 1945, and even before the San 
Francisco meeting that established the United Nations Organization (April 
1945), President Truman's encounters with Molotov had given him premol.-
nitions of serious trouble. The Potsdam Conference supplied the President 
and his advisers with further qualms about the intentions and the future 
behavior of the Soviet Union, and from that juncture to the end of the 
Truman administration (and during the ensuing years) the Soviets pursued 
with increasing consistency a course of secretiveness, duplicity, obstruc-
tive hostility, and tacit repudiation of agreements, of which their pro-
longed blockade of Berlin and their fomenting of war in Korea were the 
extreme manifestations. With staggering rapidity the Soviet Union built 
up a ring of satellites in Eastern Europe.

Under stresses that seemed at times to be leading straight into a 
third world war, President Truman was forced into improvising the radi-
cally new policy of containment -- a flexible holding operation along 
the entire far-flung periphery of Soviet domination, with aid supplied 
as needed to whatever forces were resisting communization. The three 
crucial tests of the policy of containment were Greece, the Berlin Block-
ade and Korea. Greece was pacified, and the communist threat quashed; 
the Berlin blockade was roundly beaten by the airlift, and Korea, a 
stalemate by military criteria, was a success in the sense that Southern 
Korea remains independent and prosperous today. 
The initial hopes for a successfully functioning United Nations were 
quickly dashed in the earliest days of that body by the obstructionism 
of the Soviet Union. The veto, the walkout, the boycott, and calculated 
rudeness became standard Soviet tactics, and there was widespread fear 
that the United Nations seemed doomed to failure. It was in this context 
that President Truman, in proclaiming his Message to Congress, stated 
"The United Nations is designed to make possible Lasting freedom and 
independence for all its members. We shall not realize our objec-
tives, however, unless we are willing to help free people to main-
tain their free institutions and their national integrity against 
aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them totalitarian re-
gimes. This is no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian 
regimes, imposed on free peoples by direct or indirect aggression, 
undermine the foundations of international peace and hence the secu-
rity of the United States." (See unclassified attachment for complete 
text). 
Affairs in Greece had been in varying states of crisis since the coun-
try's liberation-TT-744. The British, whose forces had come in when the 
Germans moved out, had tried unsuccessfully for three years to restore 
stability and to cope with the communist-fomented civil war. On February 
24, 1947, the British Ambassador in Washington informed the Department of 
State that after March 31 Great Britain would have to discontinue her eco-
nomic assistance to Greece and also to Turkey. Subsequently, the British 
Government announced that its troops in Greece would have to be altogether 
withdrawn. 
President Truman did not take the matter to Congress until nearly 
three weeks after the British notification. One reason for his delay was 
his deliberate intention to make his message coincide with the arrival of 
Secretary of State Marshall in Moscow for conferences; Marshall was to im-
press upon the Soviets that the days of the soft policy were over, and that 
Soviet good faith would no longer be taken for granted by the United States. 
What President Truman meant by the Marshall mission and the message of aid 
to Greece and Turkey was a double-barreled declaration that the United States 
would stand up to the Soviets and resist their continuing subversion and 
grabbing of areas vital to our security.

Legislation was introduced and adopted in Congress (which formally 
approved the request for aid on May 15) to provide that the program of 
aid should lapse whenever the General Assembly or the Security Council 
should decide that action taken by the United Nations had rendered the 
continuance of US aid unnecessary or undesirable and that, if the ques-
tion came before the Security Council, the US would waive its right of 
veto. Other provisions of the legislation passed by Congress called for 
aid in the form of loans or grants and for the dispatch to Greece and 
Turkey of civilian and military advisers to help the recipient govern-
ment make effective use of the aid. The President was required to with-
draw any or all aid if requested to do so by either the Greek or Turkish 
governments. The recipient governments were required to give free access 
to US officials and to the press so that they might observe how the aid 
was being used. Full publicity was to be given to the programs within 
each country. 
The Truman Doctrine, although faced with formidable difficulties, 
achieved its fundamental aim of keeping Greece and Turkey out of the 
Soviet orbit. By the end of January 1948, over 90,000 tons of American 
military equipment had been sent to Greece. At the request of the Greek 
government American military advisors were sent into the field to advise 
directly in operations. Toward the end of 1949 hostilities came to an 
end in Greece, and attention shifted to the country's very serious eco-
nomic problems - disastrous inflation, severe unemployment, and the almost 
desperate circumstances of wage earners and white-collar workers. 
As to Turkey, the quarterly reports submitted on the program in 1949 
expressed satisfaction with the progress toward the objective of a smaller 
but more effective Turkish armed force - one better matched to the resources 
of Turkey. 
The Truman Doctrine first set the terms and the pattern for US finan-
cial, economic and military assistance to nations of the free world, as 
later developed under the Marshall Plan and various subsequent foreign aid 
programs. 25X1 C1 Ob

1093 EUR. FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS  
25X1 C1 Ob 
SITUATION: The 18th Congress of the French Communist Party (PCF) 
was held in an industrial suburb of Paris from 4 to 8 January 1967. The 
sessions were marked by little enthusiasm and no spontaneity, and the 
closing statements included no surprises or innovations. These four 
themes ran through the discussions at the Congress: 
1. The PCF rank-and-file should realize that the Party's 
agreement with the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left 
(FGDS)* solidified the PCF's emergence from political isolation 
and therefore justified the compromises which have been made with 
the non-Communist left. 
2. A campaign must be mounted to oppose the domestic policies 
of the Gaullist government and voters must be encouraged to vote 
for the PCF in the legislative elections now scheduled for 5 and 
12 March 1967. 
3. The organizational and ideological unity and discipline of

*The FGDS (Fdgration de la Gauche De,

the Socialists, the Radicals, and an assortment of left-wing political 
conventions and clubs which initially took shape in late 1965. Its aim 
was to present one candidate from the left against de Gaulle in the 
Presidential elections in December of that year; the PCF decided not to 
run its own candidate but to support the FGDS candidate, Franiois Mit-
terrand. An agreement between the FCP and the FGDS was formalized in 
December 1966 in preparation for the forthcoming legislative elections;

The first day of the Congress was taken up almost entirely by the 
report of General Secretary Waldeck RochW who admitted that there had 
been opposition within the PCF to the recently concluded agreement with 
the FGDS. Some French press observers recalled that the language he used 
("sectarianism," "dogmatism," "right opportunism") was similar to that 
used by the Party before a purge, but when the Congress closed, the new 
Central Committee and the Politburo showed little change and Waldeck 
Rochet appeared to be still in control of the Party apparatus. 
As expected, the Congress paid considerable attention to the sub-
ject of Vietnam, but it showed more fervor in condemning the Chicoms for 
hampering Soviet aid to Hanoi and interfering in the internal affairs of 
fraternal parties. Waldeck Rochet asserted that the PCF favored a world 
conference of Communist parties; the Soviet delegate, CPSU Central Com-
mittee Politburo member Arvid Pelshe, was more cautious in noting that 
such a conference would have to be "thoroughly prepared", -- a theme 
echoed by the Finnish CP delegate; Italian CP Secretary General Luigi 
Longo expressed his party's reservations on the conference question. 
The final resolution on the proposed world conference, however, declared 
that the PCF "will work so that conditions for this convocation, which 
have ripened recently, will be realized as soon as possible." 
The most important relected amendment to the final political reso-
lution would have made it more critical of Gaullist foreign policy. The 
rapporteur, Etienne Fajon, asserted that even a reactionary government 
like the Gaullist one could take certain measures favorable to peace, 
and to attack them would discourage the "forces of peace" and make the 
PCF misunderstood by the "popular masses." According to the Soviet news 
agency TASS, Waldeck Rochet's opening speech, after noting that de Gaulle's 
visit to the USSR and Kosygin's visit to France had been "received with 
satisfaction by the majority of Frenchmen", stated: 
"At the same time, as pointed out in the draft resolution sub-
mitted to the Congress, the PCF, while unhesitatingly supporting 
all steps in the direction of peace, 'comes out against the nega-
tive and dangerous aspects of de Gaulle's foreign policy which serve 
the interests of monopolies and not the national interests.' 
Analyzing the political situation in the country, Waldeck Rochet 
noted the intensification of the economic and political struggle 
waged by the working class and other social strata. He particularly 
stressed the need for unity of the workers and the democratic forces 
and agreement between them on the basis of a joint program with a 
view to putting an end -,V) the regime of personal power [the standard

Five days after the Congress closed, the Executive Committee of the 
FGDS met under the leadership of Franiois Mitterrand and, according to 
TASS, "endorsed" the agreement on joint action with the PCF in the March 
elections. Under thisagreementa Communist or Federation candidate who 
receives more votes in the first round of the elections will be backed 
by both organizations in the second round. The FGDS was reportedly 
"not displeased" with the results of the PCF Congress and plans to pro-
pose a continuing series of private talks with the PCF after the elec-
tions to discuss and widen the areas of agreement between them. The 
FGDS also reportedly hopes that "more liberal elements" in the PCF will 
gain more influence and that "in a decade or so" a real dialogue might 
become possible. 25X1 C1 Ob

1094 FE. NORTH VIETNAM TRAINS THAIS IN SUBVERSION  
25X1 C1 Ob 
SITUATION: In early 1965 Chinese Communist Foreign Minister Chen Yi 
told a visiting diplomat that "we may have a guerrilla war going in Thai-
land before this year is out." Chen went on to say that the Thai govern-
ment would be overthrown with the aid of Chinese arms and supplies sent to 
the insurgents operating in Thailand. The same year China presided over 
the organization of the Thailand Patriotic Front in Peking with the spe-
cific purpose of directing Communist subversive activities in the north-
eastern and southern provinces of Thailand. (Begin SECRET NOFORN) Now 
there is new evidence that Thailand's Communist Party, with support from 
Peking and Hanoi, is penetrating areas in northeast, northern and southern 
Thailand. According to a source with good contacts in the area, the Com-
munists have brought eight villages in northern Thailand under their con-
trol since early 1966. In response to these activities the Thai government 
is giving renewed attention to these areas - both to oppose Communist ac-
tivities and to expand civil programs aimed at bringing the government 
closer to the people. Although government forces have been searching out 
Communist strongholds in two provinces (Nakhon Phanom and Sakhon Nakhon) 
they have been unable to establish contact with terrorist bands operating 
there. The rugged terrain of such areas, their accessibility to Communist-
controlled areas in Laos, and the absence of effective Thai government con-
trol and contact with the people have made these areas natural targets for 
Communist subversion. Peking is making capital on the situation and has 
actually been training some Thai insurgents in Communist China. The extent 
to which Hanoi and Peking may be coordinating their efforts in this field 
is not known. (End SECRET NOFORN) It is known, however, that Hanoi has 
been conducting such training of Thais in North Vietnam since at least 1962. 
On 1 April 1966 a Thai farmer surrendered to the Thai government-
operated counter-subversion center in northern Thailand and reported that 
he had been one of a class of 130 Thais taken to North Vietnam and trained 
by North Vietnam (NVN) army personnel in guerrilla warfare against the gov-
ernment of Thailand. His details of training, indoctrination, the location 
and physical layout of the school etc., were corroborated and surfaced to 
the press in October 1966 (see unclassified attachment). In November two 
other Thais, trained at the same school, were also surfaced to the press as

Interview 
A FIRST-HAND REPORT 
ON RED CHINA TODAY 
With a Chinese Who Grew Up Under Communism 
CPYRGHT 
Behind the turmoil in Red China?
Are the Communists riding for a fall? Is their 
tight control slipping? What do China's millions 
really think of their rulers? 
A vivid picture of today's China emerges from 
this interview with a Communist defector, Miao 
Chen-pai. He has only boyhood memories of 
China before the Reds. But his knowledge of his 
homeland since is sharp and perceptive. 
Miao Chen-pai, now in the United States, was 
interviewed by two members of the staff of 
"U. S. News & World Report" who have lived in 
China. Both were struck by his intelligent, ob-
jective answers to their questions. 
Q Mr. Miao, where were you and what were you doing 
when the Communists came to power in China in 1949? 
A I was living with my parents about three hours' train 
ride from Shanghai. I was 13 then. My parents were both 
schoolteachers. I was in school. 
Q As a 13-year-old boy, what did you think of the 
Communists and Mao Tse-tung? 
A Mao Tse-tung was a hero to me. I believed in him, 
and in the Communists. I believed their ideas were right 
and gopd for China, so later I joined the Communist Party. 
Q Ilow long did you continue to believe? 
A For many years. That's why I went on to join the 
Communist Party. I could see some things that were good 
for my country. Conditions improved for the lowest of the 
peasants?the ones who never owned any land. The country 
was unified, too?brought under one Government. 
Q What advantages do you get by being a member of 
the Communist Party? 
A We don't get any immediate material advantages 
from being a member of the party. A party member, for 
example, gets the same pay as a nonparty member doing 
vpie the same job. But all Chinese know that, in the long run, 
the party member does benefit. 
Nobody talks about this, but we can see it. Party mem-
bers are promoted faster, move up to higher jobs. Of course, 
as you move up the ladder, you get better living quarters 
MIAO CHEN-PAI, 29, joined China's Young Com-
munist League in 1949 and the Communist Party 
itself in 1956. He was in China's armed forces from 
1950 until 1957. Then he went to work for the Min-
istry of Foreign Trade. Last year, Mr. Miao was as-
signed by the Communists to the commercial mis-
sion of the Chinese Embassy in Damascus, Syria. It 
was there that he walked into the U. S. Embassy 
last July 26, asked for political asylum and got it.

and better food. So, if you want to get ahead faster, you 
try to get into the party. 
Q Why don't people talk about this? 
A You don't like to talk about anything like that in 
China. For example, students in the universities are not 
only graded for their work, but also are graded for their 
loyalty. The party does the grading on loyalty. So, if the 
party committee at your university hears that you have said 
something that sounds disloyal, that is put in your record 
when you graduate. This is bad for you, because it means 
you are sent to an unsatisfactory job or to some faraway 
place. All students know this, so they try to show how 
loyal they are. 
Q When did you, Mr. Miao, begin to have doubts about 
Mao Tse-tung and the Communists?and why? 
A Almost all Chinese trusted Mao Tse-tung, thought of 
him as being almost infallible, until 1957. They believed 
him when he said he wanted a hundred flowers to bloom 
and a hundred thoughts to contend. Because they trusted 
him, many expressed their ideas and criticisms. 
Then we found out that the "hundred flowers" was a trap. 
Mao Tse-tung used this trap to get people to tell their 
thoughts. In this way, Mao Tse-tung found out who opposed 
him?and got rid of these people. 
Still, many people continued to believe in Mao Tse-tung. 
They said the trap had been a smart move by him?to get 
rid of people who were bourgeois and antiparty. 
Personally, my doubts began in 1959, when it became 
obvious to me and others that the "Great Leap Forward"?
a creation of Mao?was a failure. Then, afterward, Mao 
never criticized himself for this error?although he had al-
ways said that members of the party should criticize them-
selves. 
Then, when Marshal Peng Teh-huai [former Defense Min-
ister] was purged for criticizing Mao's "Great Leap For-
ward," I realized that Mao would not criticize himself, nor 
would he accept the criticism of others. Instead, he blamed 
others for the failure. 
This strengthened my doubts. Not only did Mao Tse-tung 
refuse to accept criticism, but he also was trying to make 
himself appear infallible, a man who could make no error. 
? Did others feel this way? Did people talk about it? 
A I am certain many people felt this way. But nobody 
talked about it. We were afraid. Ever since the trap of the 
hundred flowers, we Chinese keep our discontent in our 
hearts. We are afraid to speak of these things to each other. 
? Then how can you be certain others felt this way? 
A It came out later, in the last few years. It came out 
in literary work. It came out in criticisms by economic peo-
ple and the educated classes. It came out even inside the 
party?which is why you now see the purges and the "great 
proletarian cultural revolution." 
O How did you learn about these events inside the party 
in China while you were in Syria? 
A Beginning last May, while I still was in the Embassy 
in Damascus, our Ambassador received 9rders from Peking 
to implement the cultural revolution. Peking began sending 
him a number of documents on the situation in China. These 
were studied and discussed in long sessions held every day 
in the Embassy. 
Some of the documents and reports were shown only to 
the relatively few Communist Party members in the Em-
bassy. As a party member, I was shown these documents. 
From them, I learned what happened to Peng Chen. 
Peng Chen was one of the six most-powerful men in the 
Politburo of the Communist Party?the mayor of Peking, the 
capital, and also head of the party organization there. The 
documents showed that he was removed primarily because 
he was anti-Mao. 
In September of 1965, Peng Chen made statements at a 
national meeting of provincial propaganda workers. The state-
ments were considered anti-Mao. What Peng Chen said was 
that everyone should be given freedom to speak?and that, 
even if it is Chairman Mao who is wrong, he, too, must be 
criticized. 
Mao Tse-tung no doubt has made many errors, but as 
long as he retains power, no one will be allowed to criticize 
him. Peng was purged a few months later. 
Q Peng and others must have known the fish's they were 
taking when they dared to criticize Mao. Why did they do 
it? 
A Peng and other high leaders in the party and the mili-
tary have their own followers. [don't know, but it may have 
been that they felt strong enough, politically, to voice their 
opinions. 
But this I do know: The reason for the existence ail% 
widespread opposition to Chairman Mao's policies is the 
many setbacks the country has suffered. Both domestically 
and in the field of foreign relations, the policies of Mao have 
not succeeded. But these policies have no chance of being 
changed so long as Mao Tse-tung is alive, and so long as 
anyone who questions the policies is purged. 
O Do you believe, Mr. Miao, that the purges and mobs 
of young Red Guards will make everyone obedient to Mao 
Tse-tung now? 
A No, I don't. As long as Mao's policies are followed, 
whether by Mao himself or by his successors, there will be 
opposition. There are other groups besides the Mao Tse-tung 
group. As I said, Peng Chen had many followers, and many 
of these have not been purged. There are groups in the mili-
tary, too. As long as there are groups who believe that Mao 
Tse-tung's policies are wrong for China, the struggle will 
continue. 
Q What in your mind are the main policies of Mao that 
are causing the problems? 
A There are two main policies: At home, there is the pol-
icy of continued class struggle; abroad, there is the policy of 
world revolution. 
o Are these policies popular? 
A I don't think so. The class struggle at home means con-
tinuing war against the bourgeoisie and the people with 
bourgeois thoughts. Chinese suspected of having bourgeois 
thoughts are those who are not opposed to the bourgeoisie. 
As for world revolution, I don't think the Chinese are en-
thusiastic or very much interested. They are more interested 
in getting a better life for themselves. They do not like to 
make sacrifices to help "liberate" people far away. People 
ask why we have to send help to foreign "liberation move-
ments" when we don't have enough money for our own de-
velopment.

rol is hated. People are unhappy" 
Q What do rhe Chinese think they should have to make 
their lives better? 
A Personal freedom is the main thing. Thought control is 
hated. People are unhappy with the way Communism is 
breaking up traditional family life. They want time in the 
evening to spend with their families?instead of attending 
study groups and self-criticism meetings and listening to 
propaganda lectures. People want time for themselves. 
Q What do they think of things like the law against mar-
riage before a fairly advanced age? 
A The law isn't too bad. It says men can marry at age 
20 and women at age 18. But the party says men shouldn't 
marry until they are 27, and women until they are 25. And 
you must understand that, in China, what the party says is 
more important than the law. So, generally, in the cities, men 
don't marry until they are 27. In the countryside, however, 
more people get married earlier?following the law rather 
than the party. 
? Chinese propaganda also discourages sexual relations 
before marriage. Is this accepted? 
A Many people do accept this. They work hard, practice 
self-restraint. But many people do not obey?particularly in 
the universities. You never hear about it in China, but there 
,.re a great many babies born out of wedlock. 
AweQ How effective is the party propaganda in China? 
A Very effective. Remember, we hear nothing from the 
outside world that the party doesn't want us to hear. As a 
result, Mao Tse-tung has been able to make the Chinese be-
lieve one thing at one time, and just the opposite at another 
time. 
In 1956, for example, Mao Tse-tung told us that Russia 
was the great leader and teacher of the revolution. Then a 
few years later, after Khrushchev had gone to Camp David 
to see Eisenhower, he made us believe that Khruslichey no 
longer was a Marxist-Leninist, and Russia no longer was the 
leader of the revolution. 
AS MAO'S TROUBLES GROW?
() Well, if Mao's propaganda is that effective, why does 
he now need the cultural revolution and the Red Guards and 
the purges of party leaders? 
A Mao Tse-tung needs all this because of the opposition 
that has developed to his policies?and because of his failures. 
-le started the cultural revolution because of this opposition. 
4100' 
Then he found that many members of the Young Communist 
League were not supporting the cultural revolution, or were 
not enthusiastic. 
So then he had to turn to the Red Guards. These are the 
younger people, who are most easily swayed and controlled 
by the propaganda. 
? Who are the Red Guards? How did they get started? 
A The Red Guards started in the universities in Peking. 
That was well after the cultural revolution had been started. 
At first, the Red Guards were not publicly formed in the 
name of the party. The party element behind Mao and Mar-
shal Lin Piao wanted it to appear that the Red Guards had 
been formed by student leaders in the universities. But, in 
fact, the Red Guards were backed, instructed and developed 
by this element of the party. 
? Do you think the Red Guards can be controlled?or 
that they might turn out to be some kind of "Frankenstein 
monster" and turn on their creators? 
A I don't think it is possible that they will get out of 
control, like a "Frankenstein monster." That is because Mao 
and Lin have created them, would make sure to have means 
of control over them. Chinese Communist Party leaders have 
had great experience in creating and stopping such move-
ments, you know. 
? Is the present situation connected in any way with the 
results of the break with Soviet Russia? 
A I don't think it is, in the minds of the people. 
When it became realized that there was a break, people 
were happy, in a way. Now, they thought, China can show 
the world that it can progress on its -own, without help. We 
Chinese had confidence that we could progress on our own, 
although we realized it would take longer. But we felt that 
the accomplishment would be more satisfying, because it 
would be ours. 
Besides, there was dissatisfaction with the type of help 
Russia was giving us. Engineers told me that the automobile 
plant the Russians helped us build in Changchun was not 
good. I didn't see the Russian plants myself, but many peo 
pie who did told me the same kind of story. 
"CHINA CAN PUSH AHEAD"?
? Can China, in fact, progress on its own? 
A I think China basically can push ahead economically. 
Of course, China is still economically weak. Because of this, 
she hopes to supplement her own technological and scien? 
tific capabilities with the technological and scientific capa-
bilities of the Western countries. 
She is seeking to do this now by developing her foreign 
trade with these countries. Though she has shown she can 
do things on her own?the atom bomb, for example?China 
has a long way to go, still, in many, many fields. Such 
things as bombs, of course, are not everything. China in 
recent years has refused development aid from Russia, and 
there have been no new developments or changes on this. 
I don't believe China needs aid from Russia or anybody 
else. As a matter of national pride, and because China is a 
vast country and full of resources, I believe China can do it 
on her own?though it will take time. And, of course, she 
needs to develop her foreign trade in order to strengthen her-
self economically and technologically. 
^ What will be the effects of the development of a 
nuclear-carrying missile which Communist China has just 
announced? 
A I don't believe it will have any actual military worth, 
but it can elevate China's influence and be of use to her in 
a propaganda way for prestige. 
I think the reaction of the Chinese people will be pride, 
just as they were proud that China had an atom bomb. 
? Is there any sentiment of importance in favor of 
Chiang Kai-shek's coming back from Taiwan? 
A Older people might like to see Chiang come back. 
Others might want the personal liberties that they now be-
lieve existed under the Nationalist Government. But the 
young people know hardly anything about Chiang and the 
Nationalists?except what the Communists tell them. 
? Is there any man or group who appears to the Chinese 
to give hope of restoring the personal liberties they want? 
A I know of no specific person or group, but the people 
do long for personal freedom. So, eventually, maybe the peo? 
-
ple will be able to find such a man or group for themselves.

. "The U.S. is the enemy in the popular mind" CPYRGHT 
Many, particularly the older people, long for the old ways 
and customs. I'll give you an example: 
A few years ago, Mao Tse-tung ordered the whole Peking 
Opera changed. This was the great opera of China. The songs 
were familiar, and many people loved them. Mao Tse-tung 
changed the opera so that it would do songs that help the 
revolution. One day, in a barber shop in Peking, I heard an 
older man ask the barber to please turn off the radio while it 
was playing one of the new songs of the opera. The barber 
did. 
CI How would you describe the kind of personal liberties 
that the Chinese want? 
A There are many different kinds, depending on who 
the individual Chinese is and where he is. A peasant wants 
to own his own land. A worker wants to be free to enjoy 
his time off work. A writer wants to be free to put down 
his own thoughts?to criticize if he feels strongly about 
something. 
What it amounts to, I guess, is the kind of revisionism 
they have in Russia and Eastern Europe, although this I did 
not realize until after I left China. 
The material shortages bother the Chinese people. But many 
people live just about as they did before. Some?the lower 
peasants?may live a little better than before. 
But it is the spiritual oppression that is hated most?the 
thought control, the control of your time. 
12 How tight is political control from the party headquar-
ters in Peking? 
A It is extremely tight. Whenever provincial party lead-
ers get out of line, people are sent out from Peking to 
straighten them out. This happened in Anhwei and in other 
provinces. 
Now the Red Guards are being used against some of the 
provincial party headquarters. 
CI What do the Chinese people generally feel about the 
American people now? Are we the hated enemy, or would 
they like to make friends again? 
A I am sorry to say that the U. S. is the hated enemy 
in the popular mind as a result of the propaganda. I do not 
feel that they particularly fear the U. S.?and this, also, is the 
result of propaganda. 
It is hard for foreigners to understand this if they have 
never lived under such a system. Ever since 1950, the prop-
aganda against the United States has been never-ceasing. 
After being subjected to such cleverly devised propaganda 
day after day for 15 years, the human mind can't help but 
he affected by it. 
CHANCES OF WAR WITH U. S.?
o What about the war? What would make the Chinese. 
enter the fighting in Vietnam? 
A We Chinese do not feel that the party wants war with 
the United States. I personally never felt we were going to 
war in 1958 over the offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu. 
I cannot say now what would force the party to decide 
to fight in Vietnam. Once the party said China would go to 
war if Hanoi was bombed. But Hanoi was bombed, and 
China did not go to war. 
Maybe China would go to war if American ground troops 
invaded North Vietnam and moved too close to the Chinese 
border. But I am not even sure of that. It isn't like Korea. 
There, the party feared that the Americans would threaten 
the Chinese industries just north of the Yalu River. 
I think China might enter the war if the whole regime 
of Ho Chi Minh were threatened, but I don't know. 
O In your view, what is the main danger that Commu-
nist China now presents to its neighbors? 
A I can't say what the danger is to any other neighbor-
ing country now, except for Vietnam. There, the Chinese 
Communist Government policy is to prevent any peace ne-
gotiations. There are two reasons: 
First, Chinese Communist foreign policies are in conflict 
with Soviet foreign policies. Therefore, the Chinese Commu-
nists, by pushing their foreign-policy ideas in Vietnam, hope 
to win an ideological victory over the Soviets. 
Second, the Chinese Communists hope to expand Commu-
nism throughout Southeast Asia through successes in Viet-
nam. The Vietnam war, therefore, is the basic key to Mao's 
whole theory of world revolution and wars of "national lib-
eration." He wants victory in Vietnam because that would 
be taken as evidence that he is right and Russia is wrong. 
But, if the United States can bring about negotiations for 
peace, he loses. 
South Vietnam is not Mao's whole goal. It is the key to 
Communist expansion generally. So Mao will try every pos-
sibility to prevent peace. 
WHY COLLAPSE IS UNLIKELY-
O Where does China go from here? Is it headed for in-
ternal collapse, for example? 
A So far, I haven't seen anything to indicate that an 
internal collapse is coming to China. But, inside China, 
there are a lot of contradictions, and these contradictions 
are sharpening. The main one is the desire of the people for 
more freedom. 
After a period of time?how long, I really couldn't guess 
?this might bring about a trend toward something like re-
visionism and changes in China. But, so far, I really see no 
basis for believing internal collapse is coming. 
O Is there a chance that China will break up into semi-
autonomous regional governments or regimes? 
A I see no possibility of this, because the power of the 
Central Government?Mao and his group?is simply too 
strong, too ironclad. 
China won't go back into the old system of war lords. 
And I don't think there will be semiautonomous regional 
governments set up. We had them, you know, even under 
Communism. It wasn't until 1954 that Mao Tse-tung was 
able to break the hold that some party groups had over 
various regions. 
But what you are more likely to see develop is political 
divisions among various groups. We already have had that 
?which is why we now have the purges and the cultural 
revolution. 
CI In your personal opinion, what is the best course China 
could take? 
A This is a very difficult question. 
My personal view of revisionism is that it is the period of 
transformation from a socialist system to a capitalist system. 
You see, Marx himself told how to carry on revolution 
against capitalism, but he never explained a specific way 
to build socialism. 
All over the world there are people who say they are 
Marxists, and many are trying to build socialism. But Rus-
sia itself, after almost 50 years, has reverted to revisionism, 
and this, to my mind, is evidence of the failure of socialism. 
So, up to now, I don't know how to build socialism in 
China, and I don't know who does. 
Also, I don't see how anybody can deny that modern 
capitalism is successful.

THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE 
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE OF MARCH 12, 1947 
The gravity of the situation which confronts the world today 
necessitates my appearance before a joint session of the Congress. The 
foreign policy and the national security of this country are involved. 
One aspect of the present situation, which I wish to present to you 
at this time for your consideration and decision, concerns Greece and 
Turkey. The United States has received from the Greek government an urgent 
appeal for financial and economic assistance. Preliminary reports from the 
American Economic Mission now in Greece and reports from the American Am-
bassador in Greece corroborate the statement of the Greek government that 
assistance is imperative if Greece is to survive as a free nation. I do 
not believe that the American people and the Congress wish to turn a deaf 
ear to the appeal of the Greek government. 
Greece is not a rich country. Lack of sufficient natural resources 
has always forced the Greek people to work hard to make both ends meet. 
Since 1940 this industrious and peace-loving country has suffered invasion, 
four years of cruel enemy occupation, and bitter internal strife. 
When forces of liberation entered Greece they found that the retreat-
ing Germans had destroyed virtually all the railways, roads, port facilities, 
communications, and merchant marine. More than a thousand villages had been 
burned. Eighty-five per cent of the children were tubercular. Livestock, 
poultry, and draft animals had almost disappeared. Inflation had wiped out 
practically all savings. As a result of these tragic conditions a military 
minority, exploiting human want and misery, was able to create political 
chaos which, until now, has made economic recovery impossible. 
Greece is today without funds to finance the importation of those 
goods which are essential to bare subsistence. Under these circumstances 
the people of Greece cannot make progress in solving their problems of re-
construction. Greece is in desperate need of financial and economic as-
sistance to enable it to resume purchases of food, clothing, fuel, and seeds. 
These are indispensable for the subsistence of its people and are obtainable 
only from abroad. Greece must have help to import the goods necessary to 
restore internal order and security, so essential for economic and political 
recovery. 
The Greek government has also asked for the assistance of experienced 
American administrators, economists, and technicians to insure that the 
financial and other aid given to Greece shall be used effectively in creat-
ing a stable and self-sustaining economy and in improving its public adminis-
tration.

The very existence of the Greek state is today threatened by the 
terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by communists, 
who defy the government's authority at a number of points, particularly 
along the northern boundaries. A commission appointed by the United 
Nations Security Council is at present investigating disturbed conditions 
in northern Greece and alleged border violations along the frontier be-
tween Greece on the one hand and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia on the 
other. Meanwhile, the Greek government is unable to cope with the situa-
tion. The Greek army is small and poorly equipped. It needs supplies 
and equipment if it is to restore the authority of the government through-
out Greek territory. 
Greece must have assistance if it is to become a self-supporting and 
self-respecting democracy. The United States must supply that assistance. 
We have already extended to Greece certain types of relief and economic 
aid, but these are inadequate. There is no other country to which demo-
cratic Greece can turn. No other nation is willing and able to provide 
the necessary support for a democratic Greek government. 
The British government, which has been helping Greece, can give no 
further financial or economic aid after March 31. Great Britain finds 
itself under the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in 
several parts of the world, including Greece. 
We have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis. 
But the situation is an urgent one requiring immediate action, and the 
United Nations and its related organizations are not in a position to ex-
tend help of the kind that is required. 
It is important to note that the Greek government has asked for our 
aid in utilizing effectively the financial and other assistance we may give 
to Greece and in improving its public administration. It is of the utmost 
importance that we supervise the use of any funds made available to Greece, 
in such a manner that each dollar spent will count toward making Greece 
self-supporting and will help to build an economy in which a healthy de-
mocracy can flourish. 
No government is perfect. One of the chief virtues of a democracy, 
however, is that its defects are always visible and under democratic pro-
cesses can be pointed out and corrected. The government of Greece is not 
perfect. Nevertheless it represents 85 per cent of the members of the 
Greek Parliament who were chosen in an election last year. Foreign ob-
servers, including 692 Americans, considered this election to be a fair 
expression of the views of the Greek people. 
The Greek government has been operating in an atmosphere of chaos 
and extremism. It has made mistakes. The extension of aid by this coun-
try does not mean that the United States condones everything that the Greek

government had done or will do. We have condemned in the past, and we con-
demn now, extremist measures of the Right or the Left. We have in the past 
advised tolerance, and we advise tolerance now. 
Greece's neighbor Turkey also deserves our attention. The future of 
Turkey as an independent and economically sound state is clearly no less 
important to the freedom-loving peoples of the world than the future of 
Greece. The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself today are consid-
erably different from those of Greece. Turkey has been spared the dis-
asters that have beset Greece. And during the war the United States and 
Great Britain furnished Turkey with material aid. 
Nevertheless, Turkey now needs our support. Since the war Turkey has 
sought financial assistance from Great Britain and the United States for 
the purpose of effecting that modernization necessary for the maintenance 
of its national integrity. That integrity is essential to the preservation 
of order in the Middle East. The British Government has informed us that, 
owing to its own difficulties, it can no longer extend financial or economic 
aid to Turkey. As in the case of Greece, if Turkey is to have the assistance 
it needs the United States must supply it. We are the only country able to 
provide that help. 
I am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United States 
extends assistance to Greece and Turkey, and I shall discuss these implica-
tions with you at this time. 
One of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States 
is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to 
work out a way of life free from coercion. This was a fundamental issue: in 
the war with Germany and Japan. Our victory was won over countries which 
sought to impose their will and their way of life upon other nations. 
To ensure the peaceful development of nations, free from coercion, the 
United States has taken a leading part in establishing the United Nations. 
The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and inde-
pendence for all its members. We shall not realize our objectives, however, 
unless we are willing to help free people to maintain their free institu-
tions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek 
to impose upon them totalitarian regimes. This is no more than a frank 
recognition that totalitarian regimes, imposed on free peoples by direct 
or indirect aggression, undermine the foundations of international peace 
and hence the security of the United States. 
The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had 
totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The government of 
the United States had made frequent protests against coercion and intimida-
tion in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. 
I must also state that in a number of other countires there have been similar 
developments.

At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose 
between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. 
One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is dis-
tinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, 
guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and free-
dom from political oppression. 
The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly 
impressed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a con-
trolled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal 
freedoms. 
I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support 
free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities 
or by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to 
work out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help 
should be primarily through economic and financial aid, which is essential 
to economic stability and orderly political processes. 
The world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred. But we 
cannot allow changes in the status quo in violation of the Charter of the 
United Nations by such methods as coercion, or by such subterfuges as 
political infiltration. In helping free and independent nations to main-
tain their freedom the United States will be giving effect to the principles 
of the Charter of the United Nations. 
It is necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survival 
and integrity of the Greek nation are of grave importance in a much wider 
situation. If Greece should fall under the control of an armed minority, 
the effect upon its neighbor Turkey would be immediate and serious. Con-
fusion and disorder might well be spread throughout the entire Middle East. 
Moreover, the disappearance of Greece as an independent state would 
have a profound effect upon those countries in Europe whose peoples are 
struggling against great difficulties to maintain their freedoms and their 
independence while they repair the damages of war. It would be an unspeak-
able tragedy if these countries, which have struggled so long against over-
whelming odds, should lose that victory for which they sacrificed so much. 
Collapse of free institutions and loss of independence would be disastrous 
not only for them but for the world. Discouragement and possibly failure 
would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples striving to maintain their 
freedom and independence. 
Should we fail to aid Greece and Turkey in this fateful hour, the 
effect will be far-reaching to the West as well as to the East. We must 
take immediate and resolute action. 
I therefore ask the Congress to provide authority for assistance to 
Greece and Turkey in the amount of $400,000,000 for the period ending June 
30, 1948. In requesting these funds I have taken into consideration the 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24 : CIA-RDP78-030,1A1C040X170009-3 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070009-3 
maximum amount of relief assistance which would be furnished to Greece out 
of the $350,000,000 which I recently requested that the Congress authorize 
for the prevention of starvation and suffering in countries devastated by 
the war. 
In addition to funds I ask the Congress to authorize the detail of 
American civilian and military personnel to Greece and Turkey, at the re-
quest of those countries, to assist in the tasks of reconstruction and for 
the purpose of supervising the use of such financial and material assistance 
as may be furnished. I recommend that authority also be provided for the 
instruction and training of selected Greek and Turkish personnel. 
Finally, I ask that the Congress provide authority which will permit 
the speediest and most effective use, in terms of needed commodities, 
supplies, and equipment, of such funds as may be authorized. 
If further funds, or further authority, should be needed for purposes 
indicated in this message, I shall not hesitate to bring the situation be-
fore the Congress. On this subject the executive and legislative branches 
of the government must work together. 
This is a serious course upon which we embark. I would not recommend 
it except that the alternative is much more serious. 
The United States contributed $341,000,000,000 toward winning World 
War II. This is an investment in world freedom and world peace. The as-
sistance that I am recommending for Greece and Turkey amounts to little 
more than one tenth of one per cent of this investment. It is only common 
sense that we should safeguard this investment and make sure that it was 
not in vain. 
The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. 
They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach 
their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. 
We must keep that hope alive. The free peoples of the world look to us 
for support in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, 
we may endanger the peace of the world -- and we shall surely endanger the 
welfare of our own nation. 
Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement 
of events. I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities 
squarely.

THE WORLD TODAY 
Pre-election manceuvrings in France 
,PETER STRAFFORD 
FRANCE has been living through a long-drawn-out pre-election period 
ever since last year's presidential campaign. The elections for the 
National Assembly, which have to be held by next March at the latest, 
have been described as the third round of the presidentials and, although 
this terminology is disputed by Gaullists, there is no denying the close 
link between the two votes. 'I'aken together, they will demonstrate not 
only the electorate's view of the achievements of Gaullism, but also 
something of the pattern that French political life will have in the future. 
General de Gaulle, after all, is an exceptional figure, and the events that 
brought him to power were also exceptional. Now that France is in a less 
critical state, the question is how far the present pattern of things is to be 
continued. 
The immediate issue is whether the present Gaullist coalition will 
retain its overall majority in the Assembly. This majority has enabled the 
General to go his own way with little hindrance from parliamentarians, 
and has drastically reduced the importance of the Assembly. If the 
Gaullists now lose their majority the situation will immediately be 
altered. Whatever their divisions?and they arc considerable?the 
Opposition parties will still have the possibility of outvoting the Govern-
ment, and this fact alone will give extra weight to the Assembly. - 
The Gaullists received a scrious shock from the General's relatively 
poor performance in the presidential election. If they arc again returned 
with a majority in the Assembly, much will have been done to repair the 
damage, and politics will settle back into the familiar pattern. But things 
Mr Strafford is a commentator on the French political scene.

FRANCE 
will not be quite the same as before. People will be looking ahead to the 
day of the General's departure, sooner or later, and the centrifugal 
tendencies which have been building up within the Gaullist coalition in 
the last few months would seem likely to become more marked. M. 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, in particular, the former Minister of Finance 
and now increasingly vocal as the leader of the Independent Republicans,. 
'has been doing everything he can to convince public opinion that he is not. 
an 'unconditional' Gaullist. Unless his party comes very badly out of the 
elections, more will be heard of him, and it will almost certainly not be to 
the liking of the orthodox Union for the New Republic (UNR) 
The situation shows all the signs, then, of becoming more lively than it 
has been, and the question is whether French politics are heading back to 
a state comparable with that of the Fourth Republic. General de Gaulle 
did not hesitate to threaten that this would be the result if he was not re-
elected last December, and Gaullists are making much of this in their 
campaign preparations. Their high command, with M. Pompidou at its 
head, has the title of Comite d' Action pour la Verne Republique, with the 
,implication that all the Opposition parties are trying to return to the 
Fourth Republic. The recent announcement by M. Pierre Pilimlin, 
Mayor of Strasbourg and a member of the Mouvement Republican 
Populaire (MRP), that he would not be standing for re-election to the 
Assembly' was, with its implication that the choice, was between 
Gaullism and chaos, grist to their mill. 
To speak of a return to the Fourth Republic is, however, to ignore the 
changes that have conic about in French political life under Gaullism. In 
the first place, the presidential election, now part of the country's voting 
habits, has done much to modify political structures. There has also been 
a groundswell of general political interest which is 119W just beginning to 
challenge the ways of the traditional parties. The growth of this interest 
has been in strong contrast to the impotence of the parties, and to a great 
extent in reaction to it. It is not solely a reaction to the rule of Gaullism. 
It began with disgust at the way politics were conducted under the Fourth 
Republic, and has been further stimulated by the high-handedness of 
the Gaullist regime. 
The most obvious sign of this concern, and the means by which it has 
been focused, have been the political clubs. The growth of these clubs 
has been one of the most marked features of the Fifth Republic. Some, of 
course, such as the Club des Jacobins, had been created before 1958, but 
the greater part of them have come into existence since then and they 
now exist in towns all over France. They burst on the public conscious-
ness in 1964, when the two main groups each held a congress, and a 
number of them now have an established position in the Fdderation de la 
Gauche Democrate et Socialiste, the left-wing grouping 'headed by M. 
.Francois Mitterrand. Club members have long worked for a fusion of 
parties in the interest of greater effectiveness, and they have been able to 
bring a certain pressure to bear on the evolution of the federation. They 
have played a part in the working out of its programme, and have suc-
ceeded on occasion in preventing the big parties, the Socialists and the 
Radicals, from imposing their views on the federation as a whole.

It is oftourse important not to overestimate the political weight of the 
clubs. They consist to a great extent of 'intellectuals'?academics, civil 
servants, and professional people?and when it comes to nominating 
candidates, or getting out the vote, in the elections for the Assembly they 
cannot have much direct influence. What they have done, however, is to 
enable a whole new section of informed people to find their place in 
political life. In the past too many people tended to look down their noses 
at the activities of politics, even if they had an interest in public affairs as 
such. They regarded politicians as mediocre, and the political parties did 
nothing to encourage them to take an active part. This meant that the 
parties tended to lack qualified people to speak on the issues of the day, 
and concentrated on the purely political aspects involved. 
The clubs have provided a half-way house, between non-involvement 
and total party commitment, and enabled their members to bring their 
expertise to the service of the parties. They vary considerably in their 
political leanings, and have very different views on the degree to which 
they should commit themselves to political action. By far the greater part 
of them are on the Left, and they have used their relative freedom to dis-
cuss political issues in depth and to bring pressure on the left-wing parties. 
Their most marked feature is their view that French political life, and 
particularly the traditional parties, need to be re-structured. 
In this they have come up against the resistance of the parties them-
selves. The influential Club Jean Moulin, for instance, gave strong back-
ing to M. Gaston Dcfferre, the Mayor of Marseille, last year when he 
attempted to create a new federation ranging from the Socialists to the 
MRP, and the move failed. Members of the hierarchy of the Socialist 
Party speak with scorn of the 'unrealistic' ideas of club members, and the 
current smear-word `technocrat' is freely used against them. A techno-
crat, for these officials, is someone who knows what is best for other 
people and aims at deciding for them; he is a man who regards himself as 
belonging to an Clite, and considers that politicians are idiots. 
The violence of this reaction reveals the strength of the feelings in-
volved, and the divisions which have to be overcome if the Federation de 
la Gauche is to develop into a more effective force. At the moment the 
Socialists regard it as more or less their property, and their leadership 
shows no intention of allowing any diminution of its own sovereignty in 
the interests of a wider, more co-ordinated movement.. In this they are 
opposed by the club members, but one may suspect that it will take more 
than the pressures of a few `technocrats', however vocal, to make them 
change their minds. There is, none the less, an evolution, in that the 
federation has agreed On a common programme and is to present candi-
dates standing in its own name, rather than in those of the parties, in 
virtually all constituencies. Further progress will depend, on the success 
that it meets at the polls. 
The aim of the federation is to present itself as an alternative Govern-
ment, with its own left-wing programme and leaders capable of taking 
over the Ministries.. It is this which lies behind the proclamation of a 
'contre-Gouvernement', or shadow Cabinet, and the specialists who 
have worked on the programme have attempted to make it a plausible 
document, with realistic objectives. The road to power will be a long 
haul, however, and on the way the federation will have to decide what 
attitude to take towards the Communist Party, which now monopolizes 
approximately half France's left-wing voters.

The federation is the main example of an evolution in French political 
life which has begun during the Fifth Republic. It has succeeded in 
' bringing together the Socialists and the Radicals, as well as M. Mitter-
rand's Union Democrate et Socialiste de la Rdsistance (UDSR), a small 
party founded, as its name suggests, at the end of the war. At the same 
time, it has brought in the 'intellectuals' of the clubs, many of them 
_ highly qualified men in their own fields, and this has given it an informed 
, basis for policy that French political parties have not traditionally had. 
It is, of course, easy to point to its shortcomings. It is nowhere near 
winning an overall majority in the Assembly, it is divided within itself, 
and it is strongly opposed by some of the most vocal elements of the non-
Communist Left, in particular the supporters of M. Pierre Mends-
France. The innovators, the 'forces vives', come up against the rigid and 
doctrinaire attitudes of the traditional parties, and it is not at all certain 
- that the whole structure will not fall apart after the elections for the 
Assembly. It does nevertheless exist, and if it can poll a higher percentage 
of votes than the Communist Party it will have taken its first step towards 
its aim?of becoming the major pole of attraction for the Left. 
The problem for the Gaullists is a very different one, but it does have 
!a number of points in common with that of the federation. The Gaullists, 
, too, have to face the question of maintaining the cohesion of a coalition, 
? though for them it has evolved in the opposite direction. Whereas the 
, Left is confronted with the need to unite a number of distinct entities, 
the Gaullists have to think how they are going to keep together the 
various shades of opinion which have been brought into the same camp 
? by the personality of the General. The strength of General de Gaulle's 
appeal has always been that it has attracted men with many different 
political sympathies. This applies particularly in something like a 
referendum, or the presidential election, when he has been able to pick 
Up votes that would normally go to, say, the Socialists or the Com-
munists. It also means that the spectrum of active Gaullists is now a very 
wide one, ranging from a new grouping of those of the Left who are 
entirely in agreement with his foreign policies to people of the traditional 
Right who see him as the man who brought stability and self-respect to 
France. 
This wide electoral appeal has given the General and the Gaullists 
' commanding position since 1962. France has had strong and stable 
government for the first time for many years, and the question confront-
ing the Gaullist leaders is how to maintain this situation when the 
General is gone?or is felt to be on the point of going. For the UNR, of 
course, the ideal solution would be that it should increase its number of 
seats in the Assembly, now rather short of an absolute majority, to a 
- majority, so enabling it to do without the increasingly grudging support 
of M. Giscard d'Estaing's Independent Republicans. It certainly cannot 
, count on such an eventuality, however, and the tactics since the cold 
douche of the presidential election have been to enlarge the base of .sup-
port for the Government itself. M. Edgar Faure, a Prime Minister during 
the Fourth Republic and a man with his own following, has been brought 
into the Government as Minister of Agriculture, and a certain prominence 
has been given to 'left-wing Gaullists' in general. M. Edgar Pisani, now 
Minister of Equipment, has taken a leading part in the Front du Progth, 
an association of this type, pronouncing himself firmly for a change in the 
Government's internal policies.

This wing of the coalition serves to balance the more right-wing 
Independent Republicans, and to justify the claim, made by M. Pom-
pidou himself, that the Gaullists are in the centre of the political spectrum. 
It is an indication, however, that the UNR itself, the core of Gaullism, is 
on the defensive, and only the future will tell whether these various ele-
ments will find enough common ground to stick together. If they do, the 
Gaullist vision is of a vast majority grouping, basing itself essentially on 
the principles enunciated by General de Gaulle, but 'pragmatic' in their, 
application. The vision does not include an effective Opposition, capable 
of coming to power in the place of the Gaullists. - 
It is interesting that the Gaullists, like the innovators of the Federation 
de la Gauche, now lay emphasis on the need for politicians to have the 
backing of expertise. Here too they have arrived at a similar position after 
setting out from a quite different basis. Whereas it is felt in the federation 
that Deputies should be qualified and well informed in order to help 
! raise the standing of the Assembly from its present low ebb, the Gaullists 
take the view that the Assembly now fulfils its role very well. It has given 
up its habit of overturning Governments, and this, in the Gaullist view, 
means that the Deputies, deprived of the opportunity of `playing' 
politics', take more trouble to prepare their positions. They claim that 
Gaullist Deputies, far from being the mere ciphers they. appear to be, 
play an important role in influencing Government policy behind the 
scenes. 
This optimistic view ignores the notorious rate of absenteeism in most 
sessions of the Assembly, and the difficulty that all parties are now 
having in finding able men ready to stand for election. The Assembly as it 
is at present simply does not attract such men. The Gaullists are never-
theless attempting to relieve their old guard, replacing them with 
younger, better-qualified men who will present a more modern image. 
Gaullism is, after all, something of a brotherhood at its centre, its mem-
bers taking pride in being able to assert that they were with the General 
. in London during the war. It is now realized that the movement must 
change if it is to become an effective party for the future. 'Military' 
Gaullism has to be transformed into 'political' Gaullism, as one UNR 
official has put it, and the close family feeling must be replaced by pro-
fessional competence. This attitude is not unlike that of those on the Left 
. who are struggling to replace the old warhorses of the past. In the case of 
the Gaullists, it will mean that a number of Deputies now in the Assembly 
will not be encouraged to stand again. 
The Gaullists tend to decry the political importance of the clubs that 
have developed on the Left. The UNR has nevertheless created a few of 
its own in a number of provincial centres?there is one, for instance, in 
Marseille, another in Clermont-Ferrand?and in them they promote the 
! examination of specific local problems, rather than broad political issues.-
! M. Giscard d'Estaing, too, has set about founding clubs very actively this 
year, as part of his campaign for promoting his party's .interests. They 
now exist in several different towns, under the general title of Perspectives 
et Realitds. The object of these clubs is not only to give purely political 
backing to particular parties, but also to provide a forum in which the 
problems of the day can be examined in detail. This tendency towards . 
tapping the resources of specialists is one of the marks of the present 
. political scene. . 
A more specialized approach to political problems will not, however, 
- by itself -make for stability when General de Gaulle has gone. The presi-

dential election seems likely to remain, and it is this which has clipped the 
wings of the traditional parties. But for the present system, there would 
have been no possibility of M. Mitterrand or M. Jean Lecanuet, the 
centre candidate, achieving the status of national figures, and subse-
quently being able to launch political movements that are not limited by 
the traditional boundaries between parties. It is not surprising that the 
presidential election is supported by many members of the left-wing 
political clubs, while being opposed by the party hierarchies, The election 
by universal vote has enabled the candidates to win a particular place 
? with the electorate which is a means of bringing pressure on the parties. 
On the other hand, it is not only the 'system' which is responsible for 
the present relative simplification of French political life. There is also 
the personality and political ability of General de Gaulle. Last year's 
presidential election was dominated by the General, and the Opposition 
parties were obsessed by the need to measure up to him. Unless the 
General is still on the scene in 1972, when he will be eighty-two years old, 
the same will not be true at the next presidential election, and it is not im-
possible that there will then be a whole array of candidates, more than one 
of them from the present Gaullist coalition. M. Mitterrand's success in 
; winning the support of the whole of the Left?Radicals, Socialists, and 
Communists, as well as of the smaller parties?was largely due to the 
presence of the General opposite, and there is no certainty that he or a 
successor will bring off a similar feat next time. There could be more than 
one 'Gaullist' candidate, and more than one from the Left. 
The manceuvrings that have been taking place in preparation for the 
elections to the Assembly hardly suggest that French politics are going to 
, lose their long-standing complexity. If one excludes the extreme Right, 
, which came particularly poorly out of the presidential election, there are 
at least five main groupings, none of them homogeneous, jostling for 
position: the UNR, the Independent Republicans, M. Lecanuct's 
Democratic Centre, the left-wing federation, and the Communist Party. 
Alliances will certainly be struck up between them, but there is nothing to 
suggest that these alliances will survive the elections. 
The Gaullists, as the coalition in power, have the most to lose. The 
UNR is far and away the largest party in the Assembly, and feels that it 
should dominate strategy for the Government group. It has, however, 
run up against the ambitions of the Independent Republicans, and the 
resulting dispute between the two parties has damaged the Gaullist 
image. M. Giscard d'Estaing has agreed to sit on the Comild d' Action 
pour la Verne Republique, but it is still not certain that he is going to go 
along with M. Pompidou's ruling that there should be only one Gaullist : 
candidate standing in each constituency. He is determined to increase the 
number of Independent Republican Deputies, and there arc several 
constituencies, in the Paris region in particular, in which his ambitions 
and those of the UNg clash. M. Giscard d'Estaing has declared his Sup- ; 
port for Government policies in general?having left office only in I 
January, he would have found it difficult to do otherwise?but he has 
made it clear that this support does not always extend to particular 
aspects. He has announced, for instance, that if he had remained at the 
Ministry of Finance he would not have followed the same policies as his 
successor, M. Michel Debre. He is also making a strong bid for the sup-
port of people who oppose General de Gaulle's European policy. 
One of the key sectors in the elections will be the area now known as 
the centre. To the amusement of political commentators, claims to

M. Lecanuet, M. Giscard d'Estaing, and, last but not least, Porn, 
pidou. It was M. Lecanuet, the surprise candidate in the presidential 
election, who first demonstrated the value of this sector, and the danger 
to the whole Gaullist position if it were lost. The centre includes people 
!. who disagree with the Gaullist concept of Europe, but also many who are 
-dissatisfied with the Government's internal economic and social policies. 
The Democratic Centre, which M. Lecanuet founded after the presi-
dential election, aims at repeating his success of last December by taking 
votes both from the Gaullists and from the Left. It is, of course, a target 
for Gaullist onslaughts, and M. Giscard d'Estaing has set his sights on at 
least a part of its potential electorate. M. Lecanuet reckons, however, on 
winning enough votes to enable the Democratic Centre to emerge as the 
'arbiter' of any Government that may be formed afterwards. 
His view is that no overall majority will emerge from the elections, and 
that the centre will be able to impose its conditions for participation in, 
or support for, the new Government. Since such a Government is in-
finitely more likely to be Gaullist than Leftist, M. Lecanuet appears to 
consider that he will be able to influence the policies of General de Gaulle 
?more effectively from outside the coalition than M. Giscard d'Estaing 
ever succeeded in doing from inside. He may not be right, but it is 
interesting that a poll published by the French Institute of Public 
Opinion in August found only 22 per cent of those questioned in favour 
of a majority consisting solely of Gaullists, while a further 21 per cent 
favoured a coalition of Gaullists and the Democratic Centre. 
M, Lecanuet's position would be stronger if he had better chances of an 
alternative alliance on the Left. The question of possible alliances be-
tween the centre and the Federation de la Gauche has, however, become 
the major point of disagreement on the Left, and, in spite of various 
overtures, M. Lecanuet cannot count on much open support from that 
quarter. There are many members of the federation, particularly among 
the Radicals, who would be very willing to co-operate with the centre. 
But they have been flatly told by the Communists that the federation 
cannot have it both ways: either it allies itself with the 'reactionaries' of 
the Democratic Centre, in which case any deal with the Communists is 
out, or else it reaches an agreement with the Communists. Put this way, 
the dilemma of the federation is a difficult one. An exclusive alliance with 
the Communists can, after all, be counted to frighten away a number of 
supporters. On the other hand, since the failure of M. Defferre's plan for 
a centre-Left federation, M. Mitterrand and other leaders of the non-
Communist Left have given priority to links with the Communists. 
For the Communists, the main object of the election campaign is not so. 
much to defeat the Gaullists, much of whose foreign policy they support, 
as to take a further step out of the 'ghetto' in which they have been kept 
since the 1940s. Their support for M. Mitterrand in the presidential 
election was a move in this direction, but it was taken out of weakness, for 
fear of the poor showing-211y Communist candidate would have made on 
his own. They feel stronger in the campaign for the. Assembly, and arc 
determined not to find themselves committed to a non-Communist Left 
which is itself tainted with centrism. M. Lecgrolpt iq +keno tio.wi,fige.-1

all worlds, 'Atlantic' ii his foreign policy and 'liberal' at home. They sec 
no reason to trust the policies of the federation towards the centre, and 
give every sign of playing their own cards strongly in the elections. They 
were the first to present a full list of candidates, and the first to have their 
election posters out in Paris. 
The federation has remained unruffled and equivocal in the face of 
Communist demands, conceding only the principle that priority goes to 
an arrangement with the Communists. Its own interest, as far as the 
. elections go, lies in the traditional policy of making different alliances in 
different constituencies, some with the Communists, some with the 
centre. Its two leaders, M. Mitterrand and M. Guy Monet, the secretary-
general of the Socialist Party, are both astute politicians, and of the two it 
is M. Mollet who swings more political weight within the federation. He 
is a man who likes to keep all his options open for as long as possible. 
The main question-mark over the elections is how far General de 
Gaulle will intervene in the campaign himself. The Gaullist party leaders 
are counting on him, and he learned last December that an Olympian. 
attitude did him no good with the voters. If he associates himself strongly 
with the UNR, he will do something to counteract their weakness at local 
level, and help them to take votes from the Socialists and Communists. 
He himself has always been able to do this, and his visits this year to the 
Soviet Union and Cambodia are certain to have appealed to left-wing 
. voters. On the other hand, such a degree of involvement would also mark 
him out as a party leader, and this is something that he is notoriously 
reluctant to be. It would also involve him in any setback that the Gaullists 
might suffer. 
What he will do if such a setback takes place remains even more un-
certain. Clearly much depends on the extent of the damage, and the 
limitations that are imposed on him. The Opposition parties arc so 
divided among themselves that they could be ineffective against him. 
He has the possibility of calling new elections, of introducing a referen-
dum, or even, in the last resort, of taking special powers under Article 16 
of the Constitution. He could, of course, decide that the moment had 
come for him to return finally to Colombey-les-deux-liglises. But the 
situation would presumably have to be very critical before he took this 
step.

A 
Vvnat is more symbolic of royal diyertis-
sement than a hunt in the coverts on the 
great estate at Rambouillet? And what is 
more symbolic to anti-Marxists of Marxist 
zeal than socialized medicine? The juxta-
position of these questions results from 
''our amusement at two reports appearing 
' simultaneously in the newspapers on Fri-
day. The first was about the Soviet leaders' 
day out with their guns as guests of Presi-
dent de Gaulle at Rambouillet. The second 
was about the Soviet physicians who have 
made the quite startling proposal that 
' Russians should open self-supporting 
1 hospitals in which patients should pay for 
care. ? . 
Of course all this is further evidence of 
how we fool ourselves by accepting stereo-
types. We really should not have been' 
startled in the first place. Russia is still 
! Russia, despite all the slogans we have 
heard for nearly half a century about the 
1:workers of the world, about the interna-
tional proletariat?or even dialectical ma-
' terialism. Increasingly, we are coming to 
see that Commissars end up as ambitious 
as Czars to further Russia's rather than 
communism's interests. And we were, of 
course, shortsighted if we ever thought 
that communism would make much differ-
ence to human nature for very long. 
There

photos were the male counterpart of those 
which appeared at the time of the visit of 
the de Gaulles to Moscow, showing a 
quietly elegant Mrs. de Gaulle in company 
with: some of the Soviet leaders' wives. 
The latter were far from dowdy in their 
choice of dress and maquillage. Indeed 
they were doing very well in trying to 
keep up with the Faubourg St. Honore?
and seemed eons away from peasant ker-
chiefs or even collective farms. 
The most recent news we read about 
collective, farms was that they were 
changing, too. They have not been dis-
mantled or turned over to private owner-
ship yet. But pay and benefits for workers 
on them are robbing the farms of their 
original dour austerity. So much so, in 
fact, that guaranteed minimum wages are 
keeping workers on the farms now, even 
in slack periods. There was a time when 
workers welcomed slack periods as an 
opportunity to slip off and make some-
thing on the side through self-employ-
ment. Now they are so much better off 
that they turn up for work on the farms, 
winter and summer, and the management 
does not know what jobs to give them.

in self-supporting hospitals further shows,

The Communist party is the

President de Gaulle's 'Union for 
the New Republic, and claims 
about 20 per cent of the elec-
torate. The Federation was 
formed last spring under Frari-,

presidential balloting ?against 
General de Gaulle a year ago.

munist party agreed early today 
to fight Gaullism together in 
next spring's parliamentary elec-
tions. 
The terms of the agreement, 
which are not to be published 
until tomorrow, are considered. 
to be less important than it 
existence. 
Assuming that it is respeetet 
during the campaign, the agree. 
ment marks the end of the Corm 
munists' long virtual isolation 
from other political groups. The 
'Communists were in the first 
all- embracing coalition that 
governed France just after 
World War II but were than outi 
in 1947 and have been isolated 
since. 
The agreement does not mean 
that the left will win the elec?
tions next March. Rather it is 
viewed as a first step in the 
'direction of developing a uni-
fied left. It is still commonly 
expected that the Gaullists will 
retain a majority, even if they 
have to piece it together with 
some non-Gaullists. The leftists' 
unity agreement is itself re-
ported to be a loose one, be-
cause even among the partici-
pants there is dissent. Moreover, 
It embrades only a part of the 
opposition and, in fact, only a 
part?albeit a major part---of 
the left. 
' Federation Is Young 
The parties to the agreemtnt 
are the Communist. party and 
the Federation of the Democrat-
ic-Socialist Left, which com-
prises the big Socialist party, 
the once-big Radical party, and 
several small political "clubs." 
Within the Federation, some 
Radical party members feel 
that they should be making al-
liances with the political center 
and not with the far left. An-
other group of young politi-
cians and professionals who call 
themselves the Jean Moulin 
Club have joined the Federa-
tion but recently published an 
angry criticism of, any link to 
the Communists. 
The Communists themselves 
evidently have internal dissen-
sion. French Communism, base-
? ally pro-Moscow, also has its 
? elements 'distrustful of any al-
liance. 
There are also hold-outs. The 
Socialist 12.5 per cent, the 
Radicals 4.7 per cent and a 
centrist got 15 per cent.. The 
remaining votes went mostly to 
conservative ?groups, most of 
which are now likely to vote 
Guallist. 
The first part of the new 
agreement is a common plat-
form that notes the points on 
which the parties agree, ac-
knowledging that they disagree 
on others. They agree, for M-
stance, in their opposition to 
"one-man rule," but not on the 
more fundamental point of 
what form of government 
France should have. 
The second part of the agree-
ment provides for the with-
drawal of candidates in next 
spring's elections. In the first-
round balloting, on March 5, 
the Communists and. the Feder-
ation will have their own sep-
arate candidates in most of the 
485 constituencies. 
There is no rule for narrow-
ing the field to two contestants 
In the second round, a week 
later. But if two leftists stay 
In the running against a Gaullist 
they risk giving the election to 
the Gaullist. Thus the agree-
ment establishes conditions for 
one or the other of the leftists 
to pull out. 
Third Part Called Vital 
? ? The third part a the agree-
ment goes beyond next year's 
elections and is being interpret-
ed as the most important. Its 
essential point is that the Com-
munists and the Federation 
should continue to work to-
gether., 
The Communists have been 
champions of unity for some 
time. Mr. Mitterrand has wanted 
to link the Federation with the 
Communists, but not so closely 
that the unity Would seem to 
mean the formation of a Com-
munist dominated left. ,

HOW POPULAR A FRONT?  ---
.?Is,a ,French Popular Front really in 
; the making? The agreement signed a 
fortnight ago between the communists 
and M. MITTERRAND'S Federation of the 
Left was little more than an arrangement 
for working together in the March par-
liamentary elections. But in his address 
to the Communist Party Congress yester-
day M. WALDECK ROCI1ET, the secretary-
general, made it clear that he is looking 
beyond this poll. The aim of the party 
remained the establishment of a political 
programme common to the whole left, 
he told the delegates. 
? That is a good deal more than has 
been achieved up to now, though last 
month's agreement did look forward to 
the long-term objectives of the left. 
Much will obvioutly depend upon the 
success of this initial arrangement. What 
are the chances ? ? , 
' The failure to reach agreement on 
' more than a few items of policy need 
not be a fatal handicap at this stage.

his arrangement with the communists

against GENERAL DE, GAuLLE just over 
a year ago?even, though he differed 
from them on a number of questions, 
particularly on foreign policy. Norway 
has shown how four separate parties with 
their own individual programmes can 
win an election and go on to form an 
effective coalition government.

followers for a mere marriage Of con-

than that, and it maY'be significant that , 
M. RocitET was at pains to justify it to

Gaullist Opposition to Peking's Isolation 
.Gains European Support 
By HAROLD KING ! JAPAN TDISS 
PARIS (Kyocio.:Reuter) ? 
Vim an ambassackor installed 
in Peking the French Govern-
ment is pursuing a discreet 
but assiduous campaign to 
bring China into the concert 
of nations. even if it cannot 
bring it into the United Na-
tions Organization. - " 
The latest evidence of this 
was an appeal to parliamen-
tary representatives from the 
seven Western European 
Union' nations to "treat the 
China of (Chairman) Mao 
:like a civilized community." 
I This plea came from a 
French Gaullist member of 
the national assembly, Col.

close contact with 'President

parliamentary assembly of 
the Western European Union 
on last Dec. 13. .

there is any means of ward-

The non-Communist center and 
right, of course, will have nothing 
to do with the Communists at all. 
And, most significantly, the new . 
left-wing alliance is itself a cau-
tious arrangement, decidedly less ' 
solid than the left?wing Popular 
Front that actually held power in 
the mid-1930's. 
At that time, the two senior 
partners of the coalition, Leon' 
Blum's Socialists and Edouard, 
Herriot's powerful Radical 'Social-
ists, were .for a time unconditional ? 
allies of the Communists, then led.' 
,by Maurice Thorez, in an alliance' 
cemented by the fierceness of at-
tacks against it from the right 
and center. 
Undoubtedly, the constitution of '-
today's alliance has been facilitated 
by the general detente between' 
East and West that gradually de-
veloped since the Khrushchev era 
and the ensuing more relaxed view 
of Communism taken in most of 
Europe. This evolution has been 
furthered by General de Gaulle's 
recent overtures toward the East., 
? The new arrangement links the 
Communists to the nine-month old' 
Federation of the Democratic-So-
cialist Left. The Federation is the 
big Socialist party, the once big 
but now small Radical party, and a 
collection of left-wing political 
groups. 
The Federation's leader is 
Francois Mitterrand, the man who 
ran second in the Presidential elec-
tions 13 months ago.' He shares 
his influence, though, with Guy. 
Monet, the ex-Premier who heads, 
the Socialists, and there are vari-
?Ili interpretations as to which onel 
has been really the more influen-: 
tial . in shaping the new alliance 
with the Communists. In fact, nei-
ther one is rated as a strongman.' 
The alliance started taking' 
shape in late 1965, when the Com-
munists decided not to run a Presi-
dential candidate of their own and 
to support Mr. , Mitterrand. ' 
their 18th party Congress. They 
had a new look. 
Their meeting hall was a 
smartly styled gymnasium in the 
Industrial suburb of Levallois ? 
well lighted and ventilated, and 
not a militant slogan in sight. A 
? large adjacent room Was temporar-, 
ily made over as a gallery of mod-
ern art, with hardly a trace of 
the old "socialist realism." 
The visible newness was sym-
bolic and intentional. Not three 
weeks ago the party made an al-
liance with France's non-Com-
munist left to fight together 
against the Gaullists in the Na-
tional Assembly elections in 
March. Their historic pact put an 
end to, two 'decades of Communist 
isolation as the untouchables of 
French politics. 
The Communists are the second 
most powerful party here, after 
President de Gaulle's Union for 
the New Republic. They polled 
20 per cent of the vote in the 
last Assembly elections, five years 
ago, and they hold 41 of the As-
sembly's 487 seats. (This is a 
smaller percentage than their 
popular vote because seats are 
contested by districts.) There are 
Communist mayors in Le Havre 
and more than 200 other smaller 
cities and towns, including 60 sub-
urbs of Paris. 
, Because of the Communists' 
strength the Government must ac-
commodate them from time to 
time. General de Gaulle's flirtation 
with Moscow is at least partly 
motivated by this. But fundamen-
tally they have lacked national 
respectability since the cold war 
began. Members of the broad 
coalition that ruled France at the 
end of World War IT, they were 
kicked out in 1947 and have re-
mained out. 
Even today the Communists are 
far away from full acceptance. 
The Gaullists count on frightening

THE EIGHTEENTH Congress 
of the French Communist Party, 
which ends this evening, has more 
to celebrate than just the party's 
return to the thick of French 
political life through its new 
alliance with the non-Communist 
Left. 
' It ? can also celebrate the most 
important success to date of the 
Popular' Front policy blessed by t 
Moscow .as long ago as 1956. . 
This policy reflects the interests of 
both the Soviet Union and the Euro-
pean ,Communist Parties. Moscow, 
sctireely expecting to, See Comunist

. The Western Communist Parties 
themselves have at last accepted that 
they .must abandon some of their 
rigid exclusiveness if they are to sur-

can capture an increasing number of 
votes while the orthodox Communist

it supported a broad militant

The trouble here is that the British 
Communists are arguing from a. 
position of weakness, since the Labour 
Party has no need of them, Similarly, 
in the Austrian elections last year, 
indirect Communist support damaged 
the Austrian Socialist Party.

the French party and M. ?Mitterrand 
have completely failed to agree on a 
common political programme. But 
there are already signs of rethinking 
too radical to be easily accepted 
either by the Soviet Union or by con-
servative European party members. 
For example, discussion about the 
possibility of a multi-party system 
under Communism is no longer 
taboo. The key theory of the ' dicta-

interpreted in a more gentle way.

DE GAULLE ON WAR 
Communist Conference Also 
Forms New Election Tie 
By RICHARD E. MOONEY 
Special to The New York Timex 
'PARIS, Jan. 8?France's Corn-
The'announcement of another 
new anti-Gaullist political pact 
was made by the party chair-
man, Waldeck Rochet, in a 
speech to the final session of 
the congress. The Communists' 
newest ally is the Unified So-
cialist party, a small party that, 
had taken the position that the 
larger left-wing alliance estab-
lished last month was domin-
ated by old dogmas and thus 
too soft. 
Junked to Federation 
Last month's alliance linked 
munists concluded their 1.6tn 
party congress today with a 
strong denunciation of Peking, 
restrained praise for President 
de Gaulle and announcement of 
-another new political pact for 
the coming French elections. 
' The official theme of the five-
day congress was more domestic 
than international ? generally 
building up for the National As-
sembly elections in March, and 
specifically celebrating last 
month's historic agreement to 
wage the campaign in concert 
With most of France's non-Com-
munist left. 
But there were frequent ref-
erences to the war in Vietnam, 
the Chinese-Soviet split' and a 
world conference of Communist 
parties. The final. resolution 
called for the convocation of 
such a conference "as promptly 
as possible." 
Of China the resolution said: 
"The party condemns the cur-
rent Chinese leaden who are 
breaking, in every respect. with 
Marxism-Leninism and with the 
rules of behavior for Communist 
parties." 
It said that "tahe activities of 
denigration and division" by 
Peking's leaders were an argu-
ment in favor of a world con-
ference. 
The resolution praised General 
De Gaulle "without hesitation" 
for his improvement of Paris-
-Moscow relations and for his at-
titude on the Vietnam war. But 
in the same sentence the party 
said that it remained opposed to 
"the seriously negative aspects" 
of his foreign policy on dis-
armament, for ingtance. 
It explained that the few 
.aspects did not result from great 
statesmanship but from "con-
tradictions between capitalist 
countries, accentuated by the 
'change in the world balance of, 
power."

pressures building up toward

. One looked like a govern-

opposition's right to free as-

'other was the release of a pub-

that the police had claimed 
they would not have sufficient 
men to handle such large 
gatherings. Yet the Gaullists 
had been given the hall for

The Communist poll was

Of those questioned, 51 per

since 1944 useful, and only 21

North Vietnam Runs Guerrilla School for Thais  
The North Vietnamese regime has been operating a secret guerrilla 
warfare school for Thais for the past four or five years. One training 
school near Hanoi gives an eight-month course; other establishments for 
indoctrination of Thai farmers have been located in China and in Pathet 
Lao-held territory in Laos. 
A young Thai farmer revealed details of the school near Hanoi at a 
press conference in Bangkok in mid-October. Like many other Thais he had 
gone to North Vietnam, not knowing that he was to be given guerrilla instruc-
tion. He had joined the "Farmers' Liberation Party" at the behest of a man 
from another Thai province, not realizing that this "Party" was a Communist 
front organization. Through this organization, he was offered a chance to 
go abroad to study, and he accepted this offer, hoping to receive medical 
training. The man who had induced him to join the "Farmers' Liberation 
Party" conducted him and four others from Thailand into Laos. There they 
were met and guided by Pathet Lao or Vietnamese soldiers. After 18 days of 
travel the group reached Hanoi, and proceeded to the training school. 
Our Thai farmer was given eight months of training in Communist doctrine 
and guerrilla warfare. A political course instructed the trainees in methods 
of persuasion to use to get villagers to "join the revolution" and the regular 
courses were reinforced by enforced listening to the clandestine "Voice of 
the People of Thailand," as well as to Hanoi radio. 130 Thais attended the 
school while the farmer was there; most of them were laborers and peasants 
from the south, middle and northeasterly sections of Thailand. The group in-
cluded 18 women. Trainees were paid in Vietnamese currency at a monthly rate 
equivalent to 120 Thai baht. On leaving, they received a pair of pants and 
a final payment of 400 baht. The farmer said that he was in the fourth group 
of trainees, and since the school had been set up four or five years ago, his 
information indicates that there are by now a sizable number of potential 
guerrillas in Thailand, trained by Hanoi. They return to Thailand in the 
way they come, via Laos; the instructors tell them that they will be given 
instructions by the liberation movement after they reach home. 
In the case of this farmer, the indoctrination failed. On arriving home 
in March 1966, he told his parents what had happened, and on their advice he 
gave himself up to the Thai police. Even before he got back to Thailand, he 
related, he had known that the Communists were trying to use him as a tool. 
Also, he had no desire to endanger his life for the sake of Communism.

Outlawed Thai Communeg1 tFarty 
Links Itself to China-Based 'Front' 
By Stephen S. Rosenfeld 
"V,Vashinirton Post Staff Writer 
The Thai Communist .varty 
has for the first time associated 
Aself publicly with the 
'Thailand Popular Front," the 
nsurgency movement welded 
together last year under the 
sponsorship of China and 
North Vietnam. 
And for the first time the 
Thai Party has broadcast an 
appeal in its own name on the 
clandestine radio station regu-
larly, used by the Front. The 
station is thought to be near 
Kunming in southern China. 
The Thai Communist Party, 
outlawed in Thailand, is small 
and ? in exile or underground, 
and its- leaders, are unidenti-
fied. Some observers saw its 
new move as an effort to 
broaden its base and to con-
trol at least part of the action 
in northeast Thailand, focus 
of the insurgency. 
The Front has not pre-
viously claimed or recognized 
the Communist affiliation that 
its opponents have con-
tinuously alleged, although 
Party documents are said to 
have been discovered among 
Front material captured in 
the northeast. 
? All sides agree that the in-
surgents are Thais. Their op-
ponents say, however, the in-
surgency is directed from 
Hanoi and Peking. 
The Western consensus is 
that the insurgency is bother-
some but not serious, because 
Thailand lacks the history of 
foreign domination which has 
nourished nationalism and 
communism ? elsewhere in 
Asia. 
The Communist Party state-
ment was issued on its 24th 
anniversary last Dec. 1 but be-
came known only through a 
broadcast to the northeast last 
, Saturday. The broadcast was 
monitored here. 
In saluting the Front, the 
Communist Party did not 
claim formal affiliation or con-
trol. It said it had "welcomed 
with joy" the Front's forma-
tion last year and it expressed 
"satisfaction" at the Front's 
"rapid development." 
"We want to make known 
here also that we are ready at 
any? time to cooperate with 
any group of patriots in the 
struggle to drive the Ameri-
cans out the country and over-
throw the Thanom - Praphat 
(government) , clique," the 
Party said. 
Scoring the Soviet Union, 
the Thai Party statement 
urged study of Mao 'rseAung's 
"thought" and also his 4.1guer-
rilla warfare tactics."

Article: Thais Counter Subversion  
by Gordon Tate 
Thailand has strengthened her internal security against the threat of 
Chinese-inspired subversion by local Communists. The Thai Government's 
measures include the provision of more up-to-date weapons, communication 
equipment, and river craft to patrol the Mekong River which for 500 miles 
forms the border between Thailand and Laos. 
It has stepped up the social welfare programme. Plans have been put 
in hand for "self-help" villages in the more fertile and much less populated 
south: the first group of 100 families is now settled in Narathiwat Pro-
vince. Both in the south and north-east, mobile development teams visit 
outlying villages offering practical assistance in farming, education, and 
public health. The government's experiment with sending young "Peace Corps" 
type workers (known as Rural Development Volunteers) to under-developed areas 
has proved so successful that a new batch was called up in August. 
Communist ambitions became obvious in 1964 with the creation of a united 
front organisation - the "Thailand Independence Movement" (TIM). In 1965, it 
joined a similar group, the self-styled "Thailand Patriotic Front" (TPF), ac-
cepting its leadership. Both have been exhorting the people of Thailand to 
overthrow the government and replace it with a "neutralist" coalition com-
prising "all patriotic parties in the country" - generally the first step in 
a Communist bid for power. 
Both "fronts" are backed by China, North Vietnam, the Communist-dominated 
Pathet Lao movement in Laos, and the "South Vietnam National Liberation Front." 
One of the TIM messages - reported by the New China News Agency on Novem-
ber 2, 1966 - appeal to the Thai people to be ready at any time to "take up 
arms and unhesitatingly plunge into the glorious people's war" against "im-
perialism and its Thai running dogs." It further called for "unreserved 
support and help" to what it described as "the people's armed forces," mean-
ing the Communist terrorists. 
For years China has been infiltrating guerrillas and agents into Thailand 
through Laos and Burma. The main target for subversion has been the north-
east which is separated from South China by only 200 miles of Pathet Lao-held 
territory, and where the hill tribes are the same on both sides of the Thai-
Burmese border. Communist guerrillas, an official Thai statement revealed, 
are armed with the latest Chinese rifles and automatic weapons. 
NOTE: Gordon Tate is also a journalist and a lecturer on international 
affairs, who worked for many years in the Middle and Far East.

Armed clashes in the north-east between Security forces and terrorists 
have recently increased, as have the quantities of arms smuggled in. On 
November 14, it was stated in Bangkok that during a search operation in 
the jungle of Nakhon Phanom Province six policemen were killed and another 
three wounded. Two days earlier a police sergeant was killed during a 
similar encounter in the neighbouring province of Sakol Nakhon. 
Another area of terrorist operations is the mid-south: a third con-
sists of what is known as Thailand's Deep South; in particular the four 
predominantly Muslim provinces of Songkhla, Yale, Pattani, and Narathiwat. 
In the Deep South, the challenge to stability comes from the remnants 
of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), whose terrorists are living in jungle 
camps on the Thai-Malaysian border. The MCP is a predominantly Chinese 
movement and has its main base in the Betong salient - a strip of Thai ter-
ritory extending into Northern Malaysia, from which the terrorists operate 
further afield. 
MCP tactics include anti-government propaganda, indoctrination meetings 
in villages, abduction, blackmail and extortion. MCP agents collect "taxes" 
from the intimidated local peasantry, and many plantation owners have been 
compelled to pay monthly "protection money." 
A Bangkok report last July revealed that captured documents had estab-
lished "close co-ordination" between the guerrillas in the north-east and 
those in the south. 
Non-violent agitation has also been fostered by the MCP or Thai Commu-
nist Party (TCP) and TIM and TPF. 
In the Deep South, the MCP has been encouraging a separatist movement 
in the Muslim provinces by holding out the prospect of their union with 
Malaysia "once Thailand has been brought under Communist control." Even 
religion is used to achieve the same object. The Far Eastern Economic Re-
view has quoted Thai Minister of the Interior, General Prapas Charusathira, 
as stating that "malcontents" in the area had abused Islam for their own 
ends, claiming it was against this religion to learn the Thai language. 
Communists rounded up by the authorities not long ago included a rubber 
planter, the manager of a bull-ring, and seven members of a shadow-play 
ensemble - a popular open-air entertainment given by artists travelling from 
village to village. The company had performed plays containing Communist 
propaganda.

1095 WH,f. LATIN AMERICA: 
25X1 C1 Ob 
Subversive Misuse of Universities  
SITUATION: In the course of 1966 universities in five Latin American 
countries were invaded by the security forces of their governments, in 
most cases in order to put an end to student-inspired violence. The coun-
tries were Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Venezuela. For Latin 
America this is a much more serious act than for most other areas of the 
world since in that region there is a long-standing tradition of university 
"autonomy" which in some cases has grown to the point of giving the uni-
versity almost extraterritorial status. The governing councils of the 
universities -- composed of representatives of students, faculty and gradu-
ates -- have acquired the prerogatives of hiring and firing of the entire 
university staff, including the rector (President), establishment of the 
curriculum, disbursement of all funds, even exclusive control over policing 
the university grounds. The only role left to the state is providing the 
funds. 
While the concept of university autonomy partly originated with the 
laudable objective of protecting the universities from unwarranted politi-
cal interference by the governments in such academic matters as curriculum, 
staffing, and teaching (still a matter of honest concern in many countries), 
it has been perverted in too many cases to other ends. Specifically, 
political agitators have long taken advantage of the facilities which uni-
versity autonomy offers for political, propaganda and even paramilitary 
action. Before the Second World War these agitators were most often Fascists. 
Since the war they have been most often Communists and other leftist radical 
groups. The result has been not only to "politicize" the universities to an 
inordinate degree, but also to so lower academic standards that Latin Ameri-
ca's needs for well-educated university graduates are not met. At the same 
time university autonomy has acquired an almost mythical sanctity which has 
prevented governments from taking the necessary steps to depoliticize them 
and turn them toward their true educational purpose. 
Therefore the governmental interventions during 1966 and the evident 
approval of these actions by the people are essentially welcome steps in 
slaughtering the sacred cow of absolute university autonomy. We wish to 
draw on these events in order to encourage the governments involved to con-
solidate their gains and to encourage other nations faced with similar prob-
lems to take remedial action. 
The Central University of Venezuela (UCV) in Caracas was a prime ex-
ample of the gross perversion of university autonomy. Its dormitories 
housed students, bandits, and guerrillas indiscriminately. Its chemistry

laboratories were used to produce explosives for Communist terrorists, its 
cellars and attics were caches for weapons of all sorts. Terrorists com-
mitted their crimes and then headed full speed for the university campus. 
If they made it, they were "in free," since policemen in pursuit were not 
allowed on campus. One student was working his way through college by 
renting out an armored Volkswagen to student guerrillas. 
In December 1966 the Venezuelan government finally invaded the campus 
to rid it of criminals and weapons. In so doing the government announced that 
henceforth university autonomy would mean academic freedom and autonomy and 
not immunity from the nation's criminal statutes. Happily, and somewhat to 
everyone's surprise, the government's actions received overwhelming public 
approval.

January 1967 
Turmoil in the Universities 
Although the Communists have attempted to establish footholds among 
the peasants, workers, and students of Latin America, it is only among 
the latter that they have had any widespread success. It has been largely 
the university students who have supplied the troops for both urban and 
rural guerrilla forces. In Venezuela, for instance, the universities 
provided up to 80% of the guerrilla fighters in the countryside, the urban 
terrorists, even the money and equipment. During the past year this 
militancy has obliged various governments of Latin America to take 
stringent measures against the university students, including temporarily 
closing several universities, and sending the police into others to put 
down rioting and lawlessness. 
Over the past year or so students in Mexico caused the downfall of 
the. rectors of the University of Baja California, the University of 
Sinaloa, and even the Autonomous National University of Mexico in the 
country's capital. There have been less dramatic student strikes at 
other universities around the country. Student agitation in Durango 
in the summer of 1966 caused the downfall of the state governor. Demon-
strations which built up from August into October 1966 in the town of 
Morelia, where the university of Michoacan state is located, were also 
aimed at overthrowing the governor there. 
On 8 October 1966 Mexican paratroopers and cavalry moved into 
Morelia, violating the customarily-immune territory of the University 
of San Nicolas de Hidalgo, to quell growing student riots and sabotage. 
The student protests had begun in August 1966 with attempts by certain 
students to extort free student tickets from the proprietors of the 
Morelia sport stadium and cinemas. In September, when the local bus 
company announced fare increases, students demanded a contribution from 
the company in exchange for foregoing protest demonstrations against 
the increase. However when fares were raised the students commenced 
rioting which resulted in the death of a student. The student's death 
was then used as a basis for demanding the ouster of the Michoacan state 
governor. When student groups attempted to sabotage two city power plants, 
and after increased instances of vandalism and organized terrorism against 
Morelia merchants, the Government of Mexico sent troops into the univer-
sity grounds to end the disturbances. 
The governor issued a statement denouncing non-university and 
extra-Michoacan groups for their involvement in the riots. These groups 
included professional Communist agitators, some of whom had spent years 
in the Soviet Union, Cuba, and Communist China receiving training in 
subversion and guerrilla warfare. Mexican officials showed to the press 
samples of Communist Chinese and Cuban political and guerrilla training 
literature found in all six student houses at San Nicolas University. 
In Colombia student rioting has provoked sharp reactions from the 
government of President Carlos Lleras Restrepo. The first major act of 
his government after he took office on 7 August 1966 was a decree that

(cont.) 
moo' 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070009-3 
students would be required to attend 80 percent of their classes and 
that days missed because of participation in strikes would be counted 
as triple absences. This move as provoked by a prolonged strike at 
the Univeesty of Antioguia in Medelin. At the end. of August the univer-
sity was closed for the remainder of the semester. 
On 24 October President Lleras Restrepo was attacked by a stone-
throwing mob of about 100 students when he appeared on the campus of the 
National University in Bogota to inaugurate a new veterinary science 
building. Furious over this act of anarchy and the open disrespect for 
the office of the nation's president, Lleras Restrepo ordered Army 
troops onto the university grounds to disperse the rioters. 
Subsequently the Colombian government issued three stringent anti-
subversive decrees. The new laws state that anyone "linked to subversive 
activities" can be held under house arrest, that subversive publications 
can be banned and the property of their publishers confiscated, that 
travel to Cuba is forbidden, and that the student council at National 
University is suspended. The decrees affirm the legal right of the 
police and soldiers to enter the university grounds to preserve order. 
They also provide severe punishment for stone-throwing, impeding traf-
fic, and baiting policemen. President Lleras left no doubt about his 
determination to implement the decrees. In a radio speech to the nation 
on 27 October he said: "The group of extremists that has dominated the 
university because of the cowardice of some, the neglect of others, and 
the indifference of the majority, is trying to distort the facts, to 
present them with ill But they have not been able to conceal 
the truthe.. ...The law will be abided by, and we will not allow riots 
to hold sway for even a minute. ...Whenever any crime is attempted in 
the university, the authorities will again enter it and enforce the 
law... I want to convey to the country -- which is why I emphasized my 
words -- that the government will indeed preserve public peace, tran-
quillity, and freedom of expression and thought, over and against all 
fanaticisms and conspiracies." 
A third and final example of lawlessness in the universities may be 
found in Venezuela, where the Central University of Caracas has long 
been notorious as a base for the guerrillas and terrorists who have 
plagued the nation for years. In fact the guerrilla movement in Venezuela 
has largely been defeated by the government. The turning point came in 
late 1963 when the Communist forces were unable to make good their threat 
to prevent elections. By the summer of 1966 Communist violence had been 
reduced to sporadic instances of terrorism against undefended targets 
and the orthodox Communist leadership had decided to abandon the hopeless 
armed struggle and shift to political activity. However a small hard 
core of terrorists obtained renewed support from Castro and launched a 
new wave of violence in the last months of 1966. In Mid-December the 
chief of staff of the Venezuelan army was wounded in a terrorist attack 
and a lawyer for the Defense Ministry was assassinated. Determined to 
put an end to the lawlessness, President Raul Leoni ordered the army to

occupy the University campus, to search it thoroughly for guerrilla 
weapons and documents, and to arrest known criminals and guerrilla leaders 
hiding on university grounds. The result was a thorough sweep of the 
university which produced a considerable number of weapons, from dynamite 
to machineguns, plates for counterfeiting paper money, military clothing, 
radio transmitters, Cuban instruction manuals for sabotage and guerrilla 
warfare, and large quantities of passports, identification cards and 
other documents. The university was closed until mid-February 1967 and 
the student dormitories were converted to classrooms. President Leoni, 
in a hard-hitting speech to congress on 16 December, stated that the 
extra territorial status of Venezuelan universities would henceforth be 
ended, though the educational and administrative autonomy of the univer-
sities would be protected. 
Significantly the strong actions taken against the universities in 
Mexcio, Colombia and Venezuela have all met with strong popular approval. 
It is evident that the people of those countries will no longer tolerate 
a situation in which a small segment of the population -- led by an even 
smaller group of Communists -- declared itself exempt from the normal 
criminal statutes of the nation.

HOW CAMPUS REDS TREED 
VT 
TAKE OVER A COUNTRY 
There's a lesson for others in Caracas, where Communists con- , 
verted a university campus into a "sanctuary" to give them a free 
hand in plotting to overthrow the Government. They almost got 
19-way with it before an official crackdown foiled them?for now. 
CARACAS 4: -1- Within the university, troops foul 
Ar a rime when student leftists are' 
causing more and more trouble on cam-
puses in the U. S. and other countries, 
take a look at the Central University
Caucusin Caucus to see what can happen 
when Communists grab control' of a 
university. 
The occupation by Venezuelan troops 
of the Central University in late De-
cember uncovered substantial evidence 
that the Reds were using the school as 
an arsenal and staging area in a major 
effort to overthrow the Government. . 
People in this capital city of close to 
2 million inhabitants have known for 
more than five years that the Central 
University was a focal point of trouble. 
Communist-led gangs sallied forth from 
the campus again and again to stage as-
sassinations, rob banks and blow up 
supermarkets and oil pipelines. 
? It was the most sustained campaign 
of terrorism in Latin America since Fi-
? del Castro took over Cuba. Until last 
month,' the troublemakers were able to: 
dash back to safety through the uni-
versity gates. 
, Central University, like most others 
; in Latin America, held the status of an: 
' autonomous institution under the consti-
tution. The campus grounds were iniJ 
mune to Venezuelan law and off limits 
to any type of federal or municipal law 
' enforcement. 
The last straw. Tolerance of the 
Communist sanctuary finally ended ab-
? ruptly last month when a judge was as-
. : isassinated and the Venezuelan Army 
'Chief of Staff was wounded in a new 
:wave of violence. 
1 Findings made on the campus: since 
?troops moved in are enabling Venezue-
lan authorities to piece together the full . 
story of the conversion of the university 
into a base of terrorist operations. ? 
Even though the university was on 
'vacation when the troops struck, they 
arrested some 650 persons there. Many 
were not students at all but professional 
,troublemakers in the pay of the Coin-
munists. Forty-five were singled out as 
;ringleaders. Among them was a retired

A otber ems' .i..h, ailciacc. One non-. 
. :Communist student now says that ev-
erybody knew what was going on but 
. was too afraid to talk for fear of Com-
munist reprisal. 
ISome key members of the university 
ad 
!. ministration and faculty were Com-
munists or sympathizers, so allowed the ; 
j terrorists a free hand. In this situation,' _ I 
campus dormitories became the refuge [ 
I, nal agitators. The criminals teamed, . 
of professional criminals as well as pro-
fessio  ;i 
i ? up with students to rob banks?"for the 
...people's cause," as they told bank ofk 
!ems and customers. . 
1 The campus became a recruiting; 
ground, for guerrilla units in the hills as 
! some students took t"mountain sabbati- . 
' cals." Many of these were [attracted to 
! the, guerrillas by the supposecrglamour 
. . 
of becoming mountain fighters. 
',"If -you were in: the mountains? with 
guerkillas," said a. non-Conminitist stu-
dent who did not succumb, "ypia were 
,.. 
I irresis:ible with girls." ' 
At the same time, the university sane- .: 
tuary was used 'as a rest and recupera-
tion area for the regular guerrillas, as !? 
well as their fund-raising center. 
"Trials". and torture. Evidence also ; 
Is. emerging that the campus was used ' 
for Communist "trials" and torture. One !! 
recent victim was Alfredo Rafael Seijas, - 
I a lawyer who worked in liaison between :? 
the police and Army. Seijas disappeared 
last September while on a visit to the 
university. Ills bound body was found. 
the following night on a deserted Cara-
cas street with 16 bullet holes. His 
.,.. mouth- was stuffed with a handkerchief. 
Police say Scijas was seized and hid- . 
den at the university by Communist I' 
? terrorists, "tried" in a university audi-
torium, beaten and tortured, stuffed into ' 
the trunk of a. par, then shot to death. ! 
The main function of the Communist i 
base at Central University, however, was i ? 
to serve as the .staging ground for an ; 
all-out campaign of terrorism against the i 
capital itself. That campaign got under 1 
way in 1961 after Fidel Castro publicly L 
declared Venezuela his No. 1 target. ' r 
The terrorists objective was to sub-
ject Caracas to so touch turmoil us to . 
provoke a military take-over Iand dis- ' 
credit the democratic Government ofI 
President ROmulo Betancourt. In th&. 
years that followed, Caracas experienced: 
terrorist bombings almost nightly:. For u; 
time, teriorist, gunners were killing ai. 
. policeman a day?often from fast-mov-
ing cars that headed straight buck to 
;the university. . 
Voters defied Reds. The campaign. 
to oust the Government by such activi-
ties in:Citrates -failed. In 1963, the peo-
ple defied Communist threats by going 
to the polls in record numbers to elect 
a successor 'to Betancourt. It was the 
first peaceful transfer of power between; 
democratically elected regimes in VCIIC-i 
zuela's history. 
But the Communists did not ;give upi 
They just shifted tactics. After, 1963,! 
the. Reds moved into the hills for a 
guerrilla campaign on the ' CuStro or 
Chinese Communist pattern. ? 
By 1964, guerrillas were operating in - 
eight of Venezuela's 20 Statesi. 
. Outwardly, ':central Ure&Oty up, 
peared to have 'become a in re peaceful 
!place after the Communists moveil their 
light to the hillst Secretly, however, it. 
i''remained a beehive; of activity on be-
,'hal( of the Reds. - 
Then, in the closing ?weeks of 1966,i 
.1 violence broke out again in Caracas, 
! and it was traced to the university. Al-
ter seven persons were killed and mil- . 
; lions of dollars' worth of property was 
; damaged, Venezuelan President, ;Raid 
Leoni moved in with troops. 
I Most Venezuelans, despite tradition of 
; autonomy for universities, appear to up-
'prove the Government's occupation .0i 
the campus. Ordinary people say they 
; were tired of terrorist gangs' using the 
!university as a haven. Some find fault1 
with the Government, for waiting so long; 
;to move. 
As political observers here in Caracas 
see it, the importance of the occupation 
of the university is far greater than just 
the arrests and the seizure of clandestine 
; material. 
It puts out of action the Commu-
nist sanctuary and center of subversive 
activities for the most concerted drive 
ever launched by the Castro Commu-
nists against a South American country. 
? And it involves a clear warning that it 
could happen again. 
? A similar change of mind over the 
hot subject of university autonomy is 
going on-; throughout Latin America. 
Universities have been occupied in four 
other countries in addition to Venezuela. 
These are Argentina,. Ecuador,. Colombia' 
and Mexico. 
The outlook for the Communists in all. 
; five countries, as a result, is for tougher 
[ times. No longer can they count on ? 
luniversity campuses as ? their 'private 
.!sanctuaries in working to undermine' 
'.governments. mon

? The autonomous status differs 
In degree from country to 
, 'country, of course. It is. s 
supposed to preserve academic 
, freedom from dictatorship. s 
Academic "autonomy" 
apparently., has its roots in 
'Spanish colonialism, when the 
sons of the ruling classes were 
eligible for higher learning.. It 
was a sort of gimmick to 
preserve the status quo. 
Now Limos have changed, and., 
,it is a gimmick to upset the 
status quo. 
We've had a sample of it in * 
the United States Let's see 
? 
how it worked. 
I 
,In the ? ? 
Monthly for September, i 
Professor Lewis Feuer, 'who ' 
taught philosophy and. social 
'science at California University, ? 
? describes how the "free speech . 
explosion" there in 1964-65 i 
resulted in its decline. 
Faculty ? action and inaction; 
plus a police, failure, in 
compliance with 1. faculty.' equivocation, gave the 
university at Berkeley an

universities.

to be. a stumbling block to 
Improvement in academic 
standards. 
The Califonia faculty 
Promulgated a charter, says 
Professor Fetter, which could be 
used to safeguard the advocacy 
and planning of immediate acts 
of violence, illegal 
demonstrations, terrorist 
operations, interference with 
troop trains and obscene. speech 
and melon ' 
"In* effect," he sayit,'; 
created a moral vacuum in the 
heart of the university. It 
founded an enclave which 
cancelled the limits of any 
previously defined freedom of 
speech . . . students were 
allowed to avocate and plan any 
sort of political activity, legal or 
Illegal, violent or non-violent 
PI no 
? ? ? 
A migration of "non-students" 
descended on Berkeley: "Tired 
radials came to be rejuvenated 
lumpen intellectuals , . . 
Maoists arrived determined to , 
'escalate now' on the campus; 
varieties of sexual reformers 
(orgyists, they called them-
selves) expounded their creeds 
on the university steps." 
Finally, it was estimated 
there were about 2500 "non- , 
students" at Berkeley. 
? 
MURDERER 
"Some were in flight from 
stark tragedy," he says, "some 
were clanging to rebellion and . 
adolescence and one was a 
youth who had murdered a 
'seven-year-old child in New , 
York; when Federal authorities 
arrested him for violation of 
parole, he told how he had come 
to Berkeley to make himself 
useful to humanity." 
Professor Fetter asks "What 
is a non-student? . he has no 
job, no calling, no vocation; he 
is a guerilla fighter against 
His description fits every non-
'student in South America as 
11 1 
Professor Fetter fails to point 
out how disciplined and 
organized some of them are in 
their fight "ag'in" established 
Moderates in the Berkeley 
? student body, disgusted with 
faculty capitulation' and 
ambivalence, stayed away from 
the student elections. As a 
result, a communist leader was 
elected ... 
The f a C u It si policy of 
? 
, ambiguity and permilsiveness 
submerged the concept of 
freedom of speech as a means 
. of fair discussion. 
' This also is true in many 
:"autonomous" South American 
- universities. 
ONE-SIDED 
Supporters of President 
' Johnson's policies' are also, in 
effect, denied a forum on 
Berkeley's ? campus, says 
-Professor Feuer. Students also 
managed to halt momentarily 
, the presentation of an honorary 
?degree bo lJ.S. ?Ambassador to 
? the. .1Jnibed .Nations Arthur 
Goldberg. The students had 
another one for him: "Doctor of 
War." ' 
'At a Meeting with students, a" 
professor had to stand for being 
called a "son-of-a-bitch." Only 
one student protested: He said 
he may be one but it was 
impolite to call him that to his 
face. ' ??? ? 
"This was Indeed a time of 
transition for many Berkeley 
professors," Says Professor 
Feuer, "from libertananism to 
authoritarianisM in one short 
? year." . ? 
? Student ethics lowered., the 
city of Berkeley had 
unprecedented crime (traced in 
large part to students and non-
students) "guerilla war was 
waged against s m a 11 store-
k

Selective Service." 
It certainly sounds like an 
' t A.A.. I 
university. 
CRACKDOWN 
Last month, in Argentina. 
provisional President Juan 
Carlos Onganla ended the 
? autonomy of Buenos Aires 
University, whose schools of. 
science and engineering were 
riddled with communists ,and 
far-left activists.

Impending action, seized the 
university buildings and locked 
themselves In them. Police were 
called to re-take them, 
r professors' and students' heads 
I were broken, some were jailed 
and several pollee wounded. 
NO APOLOGY 
"Of course I lament the 
violence," Gen. 'Ongania told 
this reporter shortly. 
afterward." If I did not, I would 
be ashamed of myself." 
,i But he refused to apologize ;

Speech by Venezuelan President Raul Leoni, 16 December 1966 
President and vice president of the Congress; chairman and other members 
of the honorable Senate committee; chairman and other members of the honorable 
Chamber of Deputies committee: 
? I an receiving the honorable legislative committee members who have come to inform 
r'sic of the closing of the 1966 regular session of Congress at a time when the 
!Icriminal actions of terrorists have compelled me to suspend several constitutional 
guarantees throughout the nation with full cabinet approval. This is: the first 
time that I have resorted to emergency measures provided by the Constitution during 
Hmy term in office. I can assure all Venezuelan citizens that although I was forced 
Hto suspend those guarantees, it is contrary to my republican sentiments. 
!i However, it iz well known that the lack of adequate legal instruments and of speedy 
procedures to prevent and repress communist subversion and terrorism of any kind 
11 obstructs government action under existing laws to protect civil liberties, the 
security of persons and their properties, and even the stability of our democratic 
institutions. Therefore it was necessary to impose emergency measures which will 
temporarily provide the national. government with adequate means to destroy the 
anti-Venezuelan conspiracy eirected by international communism from Havana which 
has come to the fore in Venezuela through common crimes and (words indistinct). 
The communists have expressed their desire for a long war in the present stage of 
our national life, the long-range goal of which would be a victory for establishing 
. a totalitarian tyranny in which life, liberty, and dignity would be meaningless. 
In the meantime, the communists carry out an intelligent division of work. 9n_tre 
, 
one hand. there are the fanatics who favor armed battle, which they effect through 
the action of rural guerrillas. That has been a complete failure in spite of 
intermittent resurgence. There are also the urban guerrillas, who are treacherously, 
scandalously, and audaciously directed to obtain money and other material resources, 
to frighten the ,working man, and to exasperate the forces which maintain collective 
, security and institutional integrity. 
On the othpr hand are_t.he_spft-liners, those who favor the battle of the masses and 
the propagandists for democratic peas;e, and amnesty for insurrectionists who have.. 
taken up arms against national sovereignty and for those who have stained their hands 
with human blood and have stolen the properties and money of others. 
As chief executive I can assure all Venezuelans that my government will never hesitate 
to courageourly assume the responsibility which the popular mandate and the 
constitution have placed upon my shoulders. I an convinced that it is a short step be-
Itweenpolitical Juggling tnd the government's surrendering to the spasmodic attacks of 
communist subversion, Far from controlling subversion, a surrender by the government 
:would only serve to stimulate communist aggressiveness in a society and a nation , 
that, should it show any Weakness, might succumb to inevitable destruction. 
! My government has the full and' firm support of all the people and the loYalty of the 
armed forces. That is why I am. in a position to completely assume my responsibility 
' as chief executive and as a Venezuelan citizen and to use the powers tested in me by 
. law, using my own judgment for humanitarian purposes and national interests. I have 
so acted and I will continue to do so. 
Congress also has its responsibilities, which it exercises in accordance with the 
balance that exists circumstantially between the congressmen who support the government 
and those who oppose it. In my judgment Venezuela lacks the proper legal instruments 
to fight crime, both common and political, with maximum efficiency. I believe that 
such a situation inevitably leads to the enactment of laws necessary to better maintain 
constitutional order. Following that reasoning I issued a decree during this morning's 
cabinet meeting under which the thief executive assumegain fact, responsibility for 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400.070009-3 
mainteggrgCglic order and the personal security of all citizens within the 
. boundaries of all national universities. The decree leaves the supervision and 
. administration of education in the hands of university authorities. 
--or Release 1999/08/24 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070009-3 
In my judgment, universities are Institutions dedicated to philosophic and scientific 
investigation and to the education and preparation of our citizens for life and ' 
the exercise of democracy, the promotion of culture, and the development of.the 
spirit of human solidarity, as provided for in our Constitution. As a good Venezuelan 
citizen and university graduate, .1 reject the idea that universities should be at 
the exclusive service of political groups or that they should be used for 
totalitarian subversion, planned and organized by international communist centers 
which conspire against liberty and the democratic fate of the American continent. 
I also believe that university autonomy has been established, not only to guarantee 
education and academic freedom in the universities, but also to provide freely and 
democratically elected university authorities with sufficient administrative 
power to govern their fate. We cannot accept reasoning aimed at making the university - 
into a state within the state. In recognizing these aims for the common welfare, 
my government has decided to restore to the autonomous universities their national 
characteristics as autonomous universities. Thereby they can better express their 
educational, cultural, and scientific functions, establishing them in the frameWork 
of national sovereignty, which is one and indivisible, The universities will remain 
autonomous as far as teaching and administration are concerned. However, as far as 
public order is concerned, they will be governed by to the laws which are the same 
for all citizens and all institutions which live and prosper in our nation. 
In order to realize this supreme aspiration of all Venezuelans, the executive branch 
will immediately proceed to adopt the necessary measures and regulations. From 
now on university schoolrooms and streets will again be reserved for the authentic 
concerns and aspirations of all Venezuelans, and universities will again represent the 
best hopes of Venezuela to definitely attain its great national and American fate. 
Citizen congressmen, this has been a year fraught with difficulties and calamities. 
The debate on the tax reform bill prompted psychological disorders which caused a 
serious depletion of our bank reserves and international currency. 
These are fortunately already being replenished. Natural disaster caused considerable 
damage to the national highway system and to the properties of a considerable sector 
of our population, unfortunately to the most unprotected sector. To repair as 
much. as possible the damage caused by heavy rains, I have asked Congress for 
authority to provide additional appropriations amounting to 45 million bolivares 
which, I am sure, will be approved with the urgency that the case demands. 
Finally, there were political difficulties such as the attempted rebellion at 
the Ramo Verde National Guard school, which was fortunately discovered, and the 
resurgence of political terrorism which, as I have already said, compelled us to 
suspend constitutional guarantees. Some of those calamities and problems will be 
overcome in a short time. Others will require more time to heal due to their 
very nature. 
This is a good time to convey to the Senate 
deepest and sincerest satisfaction, as well 
nifiuent tasks performed during the current 
that will serve to accelerate the economic, 
of the republic. I am convinced that those 
promote the economic development and social

PRIMERA INTERVENCION DEL SENADOR LA RIVA ARAUJO SOBRE 
GUERRILLAS, VIOLENCIA, TERRORISM? Y SITUACION UNIVERSITARIA 
CPYRGHT 
SENADOR LA RIVA ARAUJO. Cludadano Presidente del 
Senado: Honorables Colegas: Ayer, al salir del debate que se 
efectue en el Senado, me dirigi a la Camara de Diputados 
pare presenciar otro debate en el cual desarrollaba en su 
discurso el Diputado Jose Vicente Rangel, el tema de la des-
aparielein y muerte de Alberto Lovers. Escuche la aerie de 
culpabilidades e imputaciones que hada este honorable Di-
putado. Me sente en las bancadas de in Camara de Diputa-
dos y escuche todo el debate, en el que un grupo de la opo-
sleeks sentaba en el banquillo de los acusados al Gobierno,' 
pare culparlo de la deseparicien y del asesinato de un ye-
nezolano. For ml mente pasaron una serie de observaciones. 
Empece a recorder el afio de 1961, cuando una violencia im-
placable se desenceden6 en este pats pare derrocar al Re-
gimen Constitucional de ROmulo Betancourt. Recorde a tana 
tos muertos y las voladuras de oleoductos. Recorde el terro-
rismo desatado en Carecae y en las grandes capitales de ye-
, nezuela; pero no me explicaba, ciudadanos Senadores, como 
e Venezuela podia olvidar toda la tragedia que viva Vefa unaa 
barra aplaudiendo freneticamente al orador Jose Vicente Ran-
ti gel. Vela oradores eufdricos acusando al Goblerno. Yo me es-' 
tremeci en la sills., cludadanos Senadores, porque no habia, 
derecho 'pars olvidar ni por un instante la tragedia que item' 
el pale. No hay derecho pare que se hayan cambiado los pa-v 
peles y veamos a loa acusados transformarse en acusadores: 
los acusadores en acusados. Entonces pergenaba la inter-
vends% de hoe, en el &nada, porque yo querla y quiero ye- , 
nir aqui este tarde, en nombre de ml partido, a coiocar en ? 
' una justa posiciem, con toda la altura y la responsabilidad tie 
'dirigente del pais y con la mime, altura de siempre, el pro-
blems, del recrudechniento de las guerrillas urbanas y rurales. 
Pruebas del Recrudecimiento 
de la Subversion 
- ? No tengo necesidad de probarle al Senado la verded en el . 
_tema tie mi intervencion. Peal la palabra pane hablar sobre 
, el recrudecimiento de las guerillas y de la accien subversi-
ve en el pais. Me da la reef% el pronto Ministro de Relaciones 
,Interlores, el nuevo y recien Ilegado Ministro de Relaciones 
Interiores, doctor Leandro Mora, cuando la prensa de boy no 
' dice a grandes titulares: "Acordadas anoche medIdaa energi-' 
cas contra recrudectmtento del terrorismo". "Primera reunion . 
del doctor Reinaldo Leandro Mora con el Comando Policial 
Unificado". . 
El escrilor Juan Liscano, en articulo publicado el 12 de 
novlembre de 1966, me ahorrd un gran trabajo: y hace el 
recuento del eltimo mes, el mc s de noviembre, en que cons-
tatamos hechos tremendos de la acchen subversive?

es la guerra histerica. No es una guerra que este sujeta a re---,?

otra guerra la que se inkier en Venezuela desde 1961. Es unaa 
guerra sobre el individuo, sobre su moral, sobre u caracter,,

. Li guerra sicolOgica este, haciendo indiferente a una gran; 
; mass de poblaclen venezolana, porque utilizen el amino aloe 
logico, por un lado, para hacerle ver a muchos que no e tan 
grave el problema, y por el otro, dan los goipes pars confun-* 
dir al gobierno y a la opinion ptiblica venezolana, pero al' 
, fin de cuentas lo .que hacen es poner al hermano a, asesinar 
; a su hermano. En este guerra,.amigos Senadores, los pueblos, 
e 
on dominados sin lucha, porque la lucha es sorda, fria y. 
calculada. Senores Senadores, les miter? decir: unaucha 
en que cada uno de nosotros es tin combattente, defendiendol 
' una cause. o lee contraria, pero cada uno de nosotros este.:

militares con sus acetones en las guerrillas venezolanas. Los'.

pero todos, haste aqui en el Senado, estamos encuadrados.en':

Pero senores, ye qulero nether la atenciein sobre algo ; 
que este. sucecliendo en el pais. Planteo la gravedad de la 11 
tragedia, pero slento y aprecio que en mucha parte de la Po- 1 
t blacidn venezolana hay letargo, hay indolencia y hay haste 
tranquilidad en muchos, a pesar de todo s estos estrujones que,; 
? (Hari? nos hace la subversion comunista. Senores, yo quiero 
Hamar la atencion a todos los combatientes en esti guerra 
para decirles, que la concesion que se le haga en este mo-e!

Las Decisiones de la Conferencia 
Tricontinental de La Habana 
Yo quisiera recordarle al Senado que esto que esti suce-
diendo en Venezuela no es obra del azar. Aqui hay cerebros 
de una conspiraciern universal que dirigen la insurreccion. 
En La Habana o celebro la Conferencia Triconttnental, y se" 
planed todo lo quo este. sucediendo en Venezuela y en mu-
chat partes de Latinoarnerica y del mundo. Yo quisiera ells-
traer tin poquito la atencion de los ciudadanos Senadoree,' 
pare que se den cuenta de un estudio preparado por la Co-
misiOn Especial de Consults sobre Segurldad de la 0. E. A. en 
au sexto period() de sesiones ordinaries. Esa ComisiOn obtuse" 
la documentaciem y todos los debates que o habian celebra-1 
do en la Conference). Tricontinental de La Habana. En este 
estudio 68 transcriben frases de lo aprobaclo en la Conferen-
cia, tales como estas: Abuser intencionalmente ?amigoie de 
AcciOn Democrietica, y ?igen esto? "Abuser intencionalmen-
te &Ede el punto de vista politico, de la buena voluntad, con-
sideracien y tolerancia de las naciones democraticas". 
"Ei ejercilo renecionario tiene que ser stistituido por un. 
ejercito revolucionerio tele 'prantice la realizacidn de pla-
nes que s'e.t.sfagan las aspiraciones de todo el pueblo. Por eso . ? 
,nosoiros les venezolancs hemos escogido la lucha armada sin

Colombia, Venezuela ..'' Olgan blen: prestar el m?decidido 
apoyo, a fin de responder con las medidas Inas eficaces para 
contrarrestar los efectos de la politica agresiva global del im-
perialism? norteamericano. 2. "Denunciar ante todos los pafses 
de los tres Continentes la intervencion yanqui y las lucha3 
armadas de Colombia, Venezuela y Peru y promover la soli-
derided militante de los combatientes de estos nafses entre 
si, con los pueblos de los tres Continentes en la batalla por 
la liberaciOn nacional". 
? .-Para esa decision, un poderfo inmenso se colocaba de-
tree de ellos. Allf estaba presente China y la Union Sovietica 
-ciando el aval a la decisidn de fondo quo tomaba la Conferen-
cia Tricontinental. Luego, lo que esti nasando en Venezuela 
no es una cuestidn de grupos aut6nomos y anarquicos del Co-
munismo, sin? todo un plan sincronizado, perfectamente diri-
gido, abastecido y respaldado. Ello nos tiene que llamar a mu-
&Jaime reflexidn. 
Realizacion del Plan 
Veamos la realizacion del plan, cludadances Senadores. 
Dude 1961 ?y aqui no empiezo por hacer suposiciones, ciu-
cladanos Senadores, ya que son realidades escritas en la his-
lona las que hablan, ya que no son esquemas mentales de;. 
un Senador eopeyano? empiezan las realidades del -dolor, del 
sufrimiento, del pesar y de las lagrimas que se han vertido 
en el pais. Comienza en el Rfi0 61 una lucha implacable con- : 
tra el Gobierno Constitucional. Las cludades primero emple-
zan a sentfr los golpes de un comando unificado resuelto a 
estremecer los cimientos de un Gobierno y de la sociedad ye-
nezolana; y empleza Caracas, Valencia, Maracaibo, junto con 
los campos petroleros a recibir el impact? tremendo, al lgual 
gee la, produccion naclonal, las industries. Son verdades evi-
(lentos; todo empleza a recibir el impact? de la destrucciOn. 
Vierie despues el period() de las guerrillas en el campo vene-
zolam; y esa es tambien historia ya escrita en el pals. 
Ahora sefiores, les voy a hacer un poco de incapie en una 
parte del esquema de la insurrecciein comunista en Venezuela; 
algo sobre lo que yo quiero flamer la atenciOn. La guerra al-
colOgica ?decla el Arzobispo Makarlos que es experto en 
cuestiones de guerra y subversion, cuando vino en su gira 
por Latinotimerlea? "la guerra sicoleigica es tan grave y tan 
peligrosa como la guerra armada". Y aqui en Venezuela cast 
nadie sabe las tecnicas de la guerra revolucionaria, excepto 
el Partido Comunista y el M.I.R. La guerra sicolOgica plant-
ficada dentro de la guerra revolucionaria cuenta con mate-
riales para realizar la destruccien, tal como lo denuncle una 
vez en el Senado al hablar del "arsenal" de Garabato, que 
ful a ver personahnente con otros compafieros de la Comi-
sion de Defensa del Senado. 
Alit no hebia tal arsenal; lo que habla ?y para refits-, 
carles la memoria? era una especie de Escuela Superior de 
Guerra, en In cual se dirigia todo un plan pars la fabricacion 
de armas modernas, hasta cohetes; alit tenian el model? y la 
especificacidn para la construccion do toda clase de armas. 
' Por clerto quo es neceserio reconocerle al pueblo de Venezue-
la, talcnto e inteligencia, porque los expertos y los tecnicos 
de ermas nos decian, que las grenades que se construien o que ' 
se disefiaban para construlr en Garabato, eran superiores a -1 
les grenades checoslovecas 3, a las grenades belgas, inclusive - 
a las grenades chinas que cram muy buenas. Aqui utilizaron la 
forma sencilla de simples botellitas de material plastico o 
rociador de ropa, a cuya tapa se ajusta el percutor; estas 
botellitas de material plastic? se compran en cualquier be-
doge; y ustedes recordaran lo que les dije en aquella opor-
tunidad, que los explosivos maks poderosos los consegufan los 
tOcnicos de la insurreccion en Venezuela, con mezclas de pol-
vo de aluminio y nevazUcer o almagre. La ignicion en las 
mechas que se utilizan para las minas, recorre miles de 
metros en fracciones de segundo. 
Veamos como es el estado actual de la guerra. Cam-
po de operaciones: Lo conocen ustedes; primer?, el campo 
venezoleno con nuestras montailas, ubleado en Lara, Portu-
guesa, Yaracuy, Miranda, Falcon, Trujillo, Guarico y toclos

El otro die la prensa Informd que habian desembarcado 
unos barbudos on las cOstas de Falcon, y empezd la con-
seja popular a hacer un poco mftica In noticia sr a perderla 
en las brumes de In incertidumbre. MIs quericlos amigos, yo 
tengo la informacidn exacta de que esos barbudos era n la 
for y nate de algunos guerrilleros venezolanos que, amaestra- d, 
dos en La Habana, vinleron rumbo a Curazao, de Curazeo pa- .? 
saron a las costeede Falcon y de las costes de Falcon fueron 
trafdos a la Plaza Venezuela (en los alrededores de In Pla-
za Venezuela suceden inuchas cosas). Salleron de /a UnIver--
sided, doctor Paz y de la Plaza Venezuela salieron los carros 
que los conducfan a El Bachiller. 
senores, les qu1ero anunclar algo no me digan ave 
agorera? pero yo tengo la grave responsabilidad como ciu-
dadano y como Senador, de decirles a ustedes todo en este, A. 
tarde. Tengo entendido que esti aprobado el plan terrorists 
para la eluded de Caracas y que ha habldo contactos entre " 
los grupos autemornos de guerrillas dirigidos por Fidel Cas-.1 
tro y el propio Partido Comunista; y se pondra en Rector' .4 
muy pronto el plan para el Oriente de In RepUblica; 7 esto.1 
se prueba en In Universidad, porque ya empiezan Muchos es. 
tUdiantes a irse de ella para ocuper sus puestos en las gue-
Mlles de Oriente. En la Universidad se constata el hecho de' 
la emigracion de estudiantes en este epoca. 
Pero hay algo m? Existe un plan especial contra In I 
Direcclan General de POI/Cia. En este memento In Direcci6n.-
.General de Policia es objeto directo de la insurreccion comU- ? 
nista en Venezuela; antes la hablan dirigido contra la po- ; 
licit% en general ?le Policia Municipial y otros cuerpos po-
liciales? pero esti especificamente dirigido 'el plan contra la if 
Digepol, como ustedes lo podrin haber constatado. 
Lo peon de estas cosas es quo hay coordinacion con el .1 
hampa; el Partido Comunista esti utilizando el hampa ye. 
nezolana y eso es ortodoxla del marxismo, seflores Senadores, 
porque en Venezuela aprenden la leccion que ensell6 Stalin 
en las luchas de tierra adentro en la Union Soviitica, nen. gl 
do sus aliados eran los salteadores y los asaltentes, y so Va-
116 de ellos y los hizo sus aliados. 
La Guerra Sicologica 
? Senores: les dije que lba a hacer un aparte en el estudlo 
de la guerra sicoldgica y me permitire hablarles de ello por 
must breves =mentos.. La guerra sicoldgica se dingo con 
un gran talent() y toclos, inconscientemente, vim elementos 
de guerra en la guerra sicolOgica. 
Yo expresaba el otro dia en el debate sobre scguridad per-
sonal que planted el Senador PicOn Giacopini, de que la Po- ; 
licfa actuaba con una slcosis especial. Eso es cierto, dude- , 
danos Senadores, es in tension nerviosa de la Policia ?quo 7 
a veces es el miedo? y lo saben los medicos y los sicOlogos y 
el sentido com?n, que muchas veces el miedo FIC011Seja, haste 
Ins cosas Inas crueles, por la exasperacion que produce; y en .` 
nuestros policies &esta donde esti influyendo esa tensi6n ; 
nerviosa provoceda por un cerebro que quiere desqulciar a to.? ,s1 
dos los organismos que garentizan el orden en orden en Ve-
nezuela? Se desata la Ira a quienes reprimen. 
Pero, sefiores, esta guerra sicololiga ha sido tan grave, 
que hasta nos ha arrancaclo del corazdn el sentimiento tan 
venezolano de la generosided. Cuando fbamos per los caminos 
de Venezuela hace unos afios, F alguien nos podia Una

Hoy no creo que hayan venezolanos tan ingenuo que cuando

, tan inteligente la conduccidn sicoldgica de la insurreccien en e 
este pais, que ha Ilegado hasta hacer confundir al Gobierno 
y a Is opinien en los conceptos de pacificaciem y apacigua-
miento. El Gobierno cree que es lo mismo pacificaciem que 
apaeiguamiento to algunos del Gobierno, no acusemos a to-
dos). En la opine% general hay tambien confuse% entre pa-
cificaciOn y apaciguamlento, to mime que entre amnistia, e 
indulto. Hay una sublime e inteligente confusion de concep-
tos. La pacificaciem es restablecer la paz, es eliminer las 
CRUM de Is guerra, y la pacificacion sincere y real, amigos 
? de Accien Democratica, conlleva Ia entrega de las armas del. 
enemigo que ataca. Y yo no he sabido que en los planes de pa-, 
cificaciem del Gobierno hays peclido la primers entrega de 
? armas al etiemigo. A veces el apaciguamiento se confunde 
? ,con 'la tregua que realize el enemigo. Otras veces es calmer, 
es aquietamiento. Sera esto lo que est?ogrando el Gobler-
r no en lugar de pacificaciem? eaquietamiento?, ecalmar los 
animos? Hay que pensar detenidarnente sobre esto. eY la, 
amnistia? La aministia es el perdtin de la falta, tEil como 
viene con este Ley que nos estan asomando. ellasta donde. 
, se perdona la fella a los que asesinaron, a los que mataron, a 
elair h los qua violaron? a los que saquearon, a las que hicieron de-

;. mientras no hay e un ejemplo de severidad con quien co-
, mete un dent? y haste que no hays is conducciem aerie y 
formal de una idea exacta de la pacificacien, estaremos slcndo 
juguetes y burla del contrail?. 
El indult? es el perddri de la pena que fella, por eso es e 
distinto indultar quo amnistiar. 
Recordemos que en In luche subversive no se actua tanto

Senores, si ustedes van per Is Universidad, como he ido 
yo, y lo saben los profesores muy erninentes en este Camera 
? del Senado, (veo que mire el Senador Paz a Acosta Saignes: 
per cierto lo decia per Cl, porque es eminente y es profesor) 
pueden darse cuenta de qua en los afiches de In -Universidad, 
en los discursos de los mitines y en sus campanas electorale& 
el ambiente y el espiritu que se vele es ,de una emote per-
manente de violencia. Haste en las cuestiones electoralee Pa-
ra propaganda de reivindicaciones estudiantilcs los afiches 
representan a muchachos que se agachan y agarran una pie- /?4 
dra pare zumbarsela a no se .quien. En las %elms eitudian-
Wei, el espiritu, el afiche, el mitin, todo es de consagraciem 
a la violencia, y lo que es m?grave, los hampones de este, 
pais, creen que en la Universidad encuentran el refugio, 
se van para aIl?porque esti% seguros de que alll is insu-
rreccion comunista, el estudiante que tiene conexiOn %me-
diate con is insurreccion, lo ampere., porque puede ser una 
ficha clave y decisive pare ellos. Todo estos tenemos quo 
decirlo con valor, porque muchas veces se politiqueit con la' 
? Universidad, y este es un moment?, Senaciores de le, mayoria 
y Senadores de la oposicidn, en que debemos hablar con' sin-, 
ceridad, porque se ester) tratando cosas muy graves. 
Para terminar sobre la Universidad. voy a dectr lo Ultimo 
, grave. Tengo que hacer una declaracion antes de entrar en 
este tema. Estoy seguro de que las Autoriciades Universita-
rifts, los Decanos, etc., manejan con puleritud los dineros 
' de la Universidad. Hago' este deciaracion de conciencia, por-
que me consta y conozco is vide de muchas de las autorida-
des de la Universidad; son hombres honcstos. No creo que 
hayan ensuciado sus manos con pealed? en el presupucsto e 
universitarlo. Pero esto no quite, senores, pars yo hacer otra / ? 
aseveraciOn. Las filtraciones estudiadas por el Partido Co-
munista que se logran del presupuesto de la Universidad, he 
dan al Partido Comunista un ingreso anual equivalente a .1.1 
diez millones de bolivares. El Partido Comunista cuenta con ; 
ese ingreso, no porque sustrac de tins Partida especial dichos?  'et 
ingresos. No, el Partido Comunista lo sabe hacer muy ? 
ligentemente. Aprovecha Is imprenta, la Bihnoteca, las met-
tles a los estudiantes comunistas, los empleados comunistas. 
Vemos a jovenes recien graduados con altos sueldos, pues en 
? tres afios pasan de simples recien egresados a Profesores ti-
? tulares. La burocracia gana m?que todos los Profesorer de 
Is Universidad juntas; mks de seiscientos .empleados son del 4 
Partido Comunista. Las becas, viajes, viaticos y creditos, pre-; ; 
ferenciales, son dados con criterto de ayudar a los mieMbros 
del Partido Comunista. Yo estoy en Is obligachen de tdecir 
est& aqui en el Senado, y repito Is salvedad de mi prienera 
intervenciem frente a las autoridades universitarlas, de quo 
? es pulcro el manejo de los dineros por las autoridades y sus 
Decanos. No creo que roben tin centavo, porque son honestos,,, 
pero en la inconciencia que vlve el pais, no hay Is, acucloste

EL GOBIERNO DE LA REPUBLICA ANTE ESTA REAL!- 
DAD? Senores, emplezo por hater un reconocimiento; is sin-
ceridad de mi discurso y Is objetividad del mismo me obligan 
a reconocer en el Gobierno, que ha hecho algunas cons para 
enfrentarse al problems de la insurreccien comunista. to pri-
mero que ha hecho es dar la orden, clara y terminante, a las 
, Fuerzas Armadas Venezolanas para que acometan con toda 
energia Is guerra antiguerrillera, Ilamemosla asi. Eso es muy 
bueno. Hecho positivo del Gobierno. Segundo, ha creado 
una conelencia antiguerrillera en algunos sectores claves de 
las Fuerzas Armadas; edemas de crear esa conciencia; el Go-
biertio ha autorizado cursos de muchos Oficiales para que 
vayan a las Escuelas de Panama y a otros sitios, a obtener 
conocimientos sobre is guerra moderna que se esti &sem-
Ilando en el pais. Se y me consta de muchos planes que tie-
- ne el Gobierno, muchos de los cuales, no los ha realizado; ad 
y me consta que ha pretendido organizer los Comandos de las 
Policies a fin de unificar Is acceen de todas cites, pues su . 
accion era incongruente y muy desorganlzada; adtniro las' 
gestiones que ha hecho el Gobierno de Is Republica pars 1 
organizer un Comando enico en las Policies, y pars entre-
narlas eficlentemente en el plan antiguerrillero. 
Pero senores, estoy en Is obligacian de hacer ciertes crf-
tIcas a Is politica antiguerrillera del Gobierno; y le pido a 
, 
Is mayoria gubernemental, represented& en esta Camara por 
los parted.% Acchen? Democratica y URD, que las crfticas 
que voy tram: esLa tette no me las tomen como venidas de 
? un personero de la oposiclem que vs atacar al Gobierno, sin?

Millones pars comprar .aviones que no van a hacer nada, o 
muy poco, en una guerra antlguerrillera, no se compraron 
helicepteros modernos, lanchas torpederas y lenchas petit.

? Les voy a hacer una pregunta en este analisis de Is. po-
litica a traves del Ministate() de Is. Defense, eQue met con 
el barco cubano que merode6 nuestras costes hace unos dies?. 
Decian las noticias de prensa lo sigutente. El 12 de noviembre: , 
''Encallada una nave cubana en costes venezolanaa", primers e 
noticia. Segunda noticia: "Duque cubano al garcte cerca de e 
las Islas de Ayes. Sc niegan a recibir ayuda y existe In sees-
pecha de que vienen en mision del gobierno Oomunista de 
Castro". Noticia de prensa que sigue una categorfa: "Unida- , 
des do ' la Armada Venezolana vigilan de cerca el buque,' 
cubano". Fijense. Primer? le. noticla "Aparece un buque", "me. 
' rodea", "encalla"; despues: "Unidades salon a verb". Ter. 
cera noticise "Orden de requisar el buque cubano si entre 
, en agues' venezolanas": "Sigue rechazando la ayuda que le 
It. ban ofrecido". "Patrulleros de la Armada Venezolana siguen : 
, rastros del carguero cubano". "Atrac6 Ryer en La Guaira, , 
decfa, el P0-6, pars reabastecerse de agua y combustible, a fin ' 
.1 de salir luego en ruts Norte", SIguen las notIcias. "Desapare-t 
i do el bare? cubano". fr asf termina la secuencia de las no-e 
1 tides. iDeseparecid I Pero, ,que pas6? Yo quicro averiguar 
I eso. eQue pase? Yo les voy a decir Is. verdad. Tenemos In ate 
, informacidn en la Comisidn de Defense.. A las 10 de Is. ma-,;i' 
? hana del dat 12, recibi6 la Comandancia de Is Marina Is In. 
?;formacidn 'do que estaba un buque cores de las costes de e 
,, Venezuela y que pedia auxin?. Entonces el Oficial de guardia 
!de is Marina do is orden de que el. patrullero P0-4, que eto; l 
etaba anclado en La Guaira, salters. en direccien a las coor-'i 
1

denadas que se le hebian sciialado pare ubicar el barco r 
empezar el patrullaje y la inspeccidn. Y al cabo de un mato 
recible contraorden de la Comandancia de la Marina, Infor. 
, mandole quo dicha Comandancla asumia directamente la fug-

: .filcal de guardia. Pero, ea que hors proced16 Is Comandati. 
- cia de is Marina? En Is tette., y apenas en is tarde fue que ' 
salieron a buscar el barco y, IQue diantes1 Con tantaa horns, 
e de retraso?desapareci6 el barco cubano; as! lo dice, Is prensa. 
Yo quisiere que se estudiara ese prqblema, porque, 'ado-, 
Quire.? &dries que no conozco los planes del Goblerno" ? 
frente a is guerra sicologiee;',y aunqUe los conociera, quiero 
? decirles quo no homes visto en el pais in contraofensiva a 
la guerra sicologIca que adelanta Is. insurreccidn comunista. 
No veo que estemes cenendo la poles en el campo sicolagico: 
todo lo contrario. Las tensiones de la Policia, las exasperacio-
nes de les gentes, ci ward? a salir tie noche, la prensa, con 
Ins noticies que transmite y is. radio, contribuyen a, que se 
mantenga dirigIda per Is insurrection comunista, is guerra

iniervencidn, me permito traer una aerie de conclusiones al 
Senado.

Primera.? Que hagamos una revisiOn general de Is politi-
ca antlguerrillera. En este sentido,.que se Invite aquellos par., 
tidos de Is oposicidn que puedan aportar aigo, pars que ana-
licemos torlos si Is politica que se ha seguido es corrects, y sl 
an prueba lo contrarlo, que se haga una revision con humil-
? dad. Les propongO, en nombre del Partido Social Cristiana 
Copel, el eatudio conjunto pars ham una revision (3 pars qua 
ustefies nos expliquen tantas cosas, que a lo mejor no las 
sabemos. 
Segundo.? Que el Alto Mando explique a) La iltima corn:-
pra de los aviones en lugar de helledpteros y lanchas. patru-
Items; b) El no abordaje del barco cubano. 
Tercera.? Que el Goblerno explique la politica de Indul-
tos. A lo major la explicaciOn? la aceptamos; pero mientras 
? lento la creemos contraproducente, inoportuna, discriminato-
via muchas veces; tExpliquennosla: 
Cuarta.? Que se proeeda a la selecelon, formed& y 
en-
trenamlento tie la Direcci?n General de la Policia. Una Poll-.

ridad del Estado, sea mita Iddoco m?seri? y m?responsad

Gobierno no siente que algo grave le arremete en sus cimien-'.' 
los, y si esa realidad lo sobrepasa, tendremos horns muy tris-. ,

nos de quienes conducen el Gobierno; y que no digan manes ;4

de un pais. Le pido a Dios que nos ayude, qua sl mis palabm 
ban sido exageratias o agoreras, que me ?dispensen, pero ea ?1
