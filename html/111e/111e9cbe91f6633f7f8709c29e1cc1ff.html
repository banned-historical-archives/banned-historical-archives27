 Shelepin Removed from
 Soviet Politburo
 The Soviet party Central Committee meeting in
 Moscow yesterday signaled the beginning of prepara-
 tions for the next party congress and eliminated
 one of the potential runners in the long-term race
 to succeed General Secretary Brezhnev.   The removal
 of trade unions chief Aleksandr Shelepin from the
 Politburo does little to clarify the succession
 picture, however, and there could well be additional
 moves within the leadership between now and the con-
 vening of the congress.
 Brezhnev was clearly in charge at the plenum,
 delivering a report on plans for the congress, now
 set for February 24, 1976.  Foreign Minister Gromyko
 delivered a report on foreign affairs, which is
 usually given by Brezhnev.  This continues the trend
 toward greater collectivity in the leadership that
 has been apparent since the General Secretary's
 illness this winter.   Since his return to public
 view, Brezhnev has been pacing himself more care-
 fully.   As a result, greater public exposure has
 been given to his colleagues.
 The decision setting the date for the party
 congress has come earlier and more smoothly than
 it did for the 24th congress in 1971.  This suggests
 satisfaction on the part of the leaders with present
 political conditions and confidence in their ability
 to set the course of the Soviet Union over the next
 five years.
 The announcement of the opening date for the
 congress should trigger a cycle of party meetings
 which will begin in the fall and continue up
 through the hierarchy, ending by late January or
 early February.   Personnel shifts will probably be

 occurring from now on at all levels within the party,
 and final results of these shifts will determine the
 relative political strength of the various Soviet
 leaders for the next several years.
 Shelepin has long been regarded warily by some
 of his colleagues as a dangerous combination of
 ability and ambition, and his departure from the
 Kremlin removes a potential element of instability
 in the leadership.   In 1965, he mounted a serious
 but unsuccessful. challenge to Brezhnev's leadership.
 When that failed, his career took a precipitous
 slide.   In 1967 he was removed from the party
 Secretariat and given the trade unions post--a
 traditionally powerless figurehead position.
 Shelepin's visit to England and Scotland last
 month was greeted by a tremendous outcry in the
 British press against him personally as a former
 chief of the Soviet secret police  (KGB), and
 clearly hurt his prospects for the future.  I

 Soviet Central Committee Meets
 25X1
 25X1
 The resolution issued by yesterday's Central
 Committee plenum expressed satisfaction with the
 fruits of the four-year-old Soviet "peace program"
 and endorsed continuation of a detente policy.
 Striking a typical balance, the resolution also
 observed, however, that the successes of Soviet
 foreign policy were based on Soviet economic and
 military strength, and noted that the forces of
 war and reaction were still active.
 The resolution put the party's stamp of ap-
 proval on further progress in the force reduction
 talks and SALT by holding that political detente
 must be accompanied by military detente, including
 arms reductions.   It also noted the continuing im-
 portance of bilateral and multilateral summitry in
 improving international relations.
 In light of recent international developments,
 the Soviet leadership apparently concluded that this
 was an appropriate time for a foreign policy review.
 Like past Central Committee resolutions, however,
 this one is short on specifics.  Details were almost
 certainly taken up by Foreign Minister Gromyko'in his
 report to the plenum, but neither his speech nor
 that of party chief Brezhnev is likely to be made public.
 The plenum's emphasis on foreign policy jibes
 with reports that Moscow has begun a broad assessment
 of Soviet relations with the West in preparation for
 the party congress next February.

 This interpretation of Soviet thinking is ob-

 be prepared to argue that the foreign policy line
 should be adjusted to take advantage of the chang-

 with other signs of the mood in Moscow.   A recent
 article in Pravda by the minister of foreign trade,
 which highlighted the rapid growth of trade with the
 West, took a strongly self-confident stance, con-
 trasting the strengthened political, economic, and
 military posture of the USSR with the troubles of
 the West.   During Secretary Simon's visit to Moscow

 Iraqi's Visit Fails to
 Stem Soviet Concern
 The brief, official visit to Moscow of Iraqi
 strong man Saddam Husayn, which ended April 15, ap-
 pears to have been amicable, but probably did not
 lessen concern in the Kremlin about Baghdad's drift
 away from the USSR.
 In his speech at a dinner for the Iraqis, So-
 viet Premier Kosygin implied that Iraq's accord with
 Iran will reduce Baghdad's dependence on Moscow.
 He did not endorse the accord and cautioned that
 "imperialists" still have designs on Iraq.   The
 agreement was endorsed, however, in Moscow Radio's
 Arabic-language broadcast of the communique.
 Kosygin's remarks suggest that Moscow is con-
 cerned that the Baathist regime opposes a role for
 the Iraqi Communist Party in the government.   He
 said that Moscow regards the cohesion of leftist
 forces as an "earnest" of Iraq's revolutionary
 credentials.
 The Soviet Premier also indirectly voiced mis-
 givings about Iraqi policy toward the Kurds.                                The
 Soviets, who have been cool to Iraq's armed suppres-
 sion of the rebellion, may think that the Baathists
 intend to eliminate the Kurds as a political factor.
 The Soviets may hope that the collapse of Kurdish
 leader Barzani's movement will lead to a revival of
 leftist influence among the Kurds that the Soviets
 could exploit.
 Kosygin championed closer cooperation among
 Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, arguing that a united posi-
 tion would enable the Arabs to confront Israel more
 effectively.   In an apparent reference to Baghdad's
 charges that Syria has diverted water from the

 Yu oslav-Soviet Relations
 After the Bijedic Visit
 Premier Bijedic's visit to the Soviet Union
 from April 9 to 15, during which he hit back at
 recent Soviet efforts to belittle the Yugoslav
 partisan resistance during World War II, was a
 qualified success.
 Bijedic carried Belgrade's resentment into
 the halls of the Kremlin itself where, in toasting
 his hosts, he pointedly referred to the unique role
 of the partisans in liberating Yugoslavia.   As a
 result, the final communique pays special tribute
 to the Yugoslav peoples for their struggle against
 fascism.   It also notes that both Yugoslavia and
 the Soviet Union made huge sacrifices during World
 War II.   Following his talks in Moscow, Bijedic
 drove Belgrade's point home in Leningrad and Kiev.
 Furthermore, he sniped at the Soviets by pointing
 out that the partisans received military aid from
 the Western allies before Soviet assistance arrived
 in 1944.
 Despite the communique's claim that the visit
 took place in a spirit of "friendship and mutual
 understanding," it is clear that other differences
 persisted.   On international problems, for example,
 the communique said only that the two sides had a
 "comprehensive exchange of views"--a formulation
 that implies disagreement on a number of issues. The
 one area where the two sides expressed satisfaction
 with bilateral relations was in economic relations.
 Moscow's handling of the 30th anniversary of
 victory in World War II, coming on the eve of the
 Bijedic visit, showed an almost complete lack of
 sensitivity to Yugoslav pride over the partisan war
 effort                                          One Soviet

 diplomat in Belgrade tried to excuse the Kremlin's
 heavy-handedness to a Western colleague by blaming
 Soviet military writers.   He  grudgingly admitted,
 however, that the blunder had prejudiced chances
 of Yugoslav participation in VE Day celebrations
 planned by the socialist countries.
 Although the Yugoslav press generally indicates
 satisfaction with the Bijedic visit, the articles
 stress that good bilateral relations depend on the
 adherence of both sides to previously agreed princi-
 ples.                                Indeed the communique specifically refers to
 the need for "mutual respect, sovereignty, full
 equality and non-interference in internal affairs."
 Yugoslav commentator Milika Sundic stressed these
 principles in his evaluation of the trip, warning
 that failure to live up to them is unacceptable to
 Belgrade and "cannot be useful for the Soviet Union."

 Force Reduction Talks Recess
 25X1
 The fifth round of the force reduction talks
 in Vienna ends today. There has been no progress
 in resolving basic differences, and the talks re-
 main stalemated.  They will resume in mid-May.
 Both East and West marked time during this
 round.  The Soviets and their allies offered a
 revised scenario for negotiating their proposal
 of last October that called for initial reductions
 of 20,000 men by both sides in 1975.  They also
 offered to amend slightly their basic proposal
 of November 1973.   Eastern representatives com-
 mented informally that they did not expect the
 West to take these proposals seriously  and were
 not surprised when the Western delegations re-
 jected them.
 .   Neither East nor West has shown signs during
 the round that they are overly disturbed by the
 lack of progress in Vienna.   The Soviets have never
 appeared to be under time pressure during the talks.
 Various Soviet officials have implied that there
 would be no movement in Vienna until the European
 security conference in Geneva concludes in a satis-
 factory manner.   In addition, there have been some
 indications that Moscow is aware that the West
 might substantially modify its basic proposals, and
 the Soviets apparently are content to await such an

 Moscow Plans for China Without Mao
 25X1
 The Soviet Union has apparently concluded that
 the course of the post-Mao power struggle will be
 protracted.  There is no entirely clear or con-
 sistent picture of the Soviet appraisal of the post-
 Mao years and there probably are differences among
 various bureaucracies about how best to deal with
 China, both now and in the future.  Nevertheless,
 certain broad outlines emerge, and running through
 these is a theme of hopefulness that the USSR will
 be able to influence the outcome in ways that will
 ease Chinese hostility.
 Moscow sees all power in China as concentrated
 in the hands of Mao and three factions:   the leftists
 (usually associated with the Shanghai party organiza-
 tion), the moderates  (those associated with Chou En-
 lai and the economic ministries), and the military,
 whose political power has been dramatically reduced
 but whose allegiance in the post-Mao period cannot
 yet be predicted.   Mao is seen as in control, but
 not as all-powerful, acting as a sort of arbiter
 who imposes his policies on China by manipulating
 the factions that contend for his favor.
 China Immediately after Mao
 Soviet observers have at times claimed that
 the Cultural Revolution eroded power at the center
 and enhanced separatist tendencies in at least some
 regions of China.
 By and large, how-
 ever, Soviet commentary piays                                     n the prospect that
 China will break up during the post-Mao years.
 Instead, Soviet China-watchers anticipate a
 prolonged period of political instability at the
 center during which Mao's myrmidons will struggle

 with one another for pre-eminence.  This period
 will last, according to various Soviet observers,
 from seven to ten years, and no strong figure is
 expected to emerge from the upper echelons of the
 present leadership.  By the end of this period,
 however, some as yet unknown figure will have con-
 solidated power into his hands.
 Most Soviet observers feel that the leftists
 will have the initial advantage in the post-Mao
 period, but will not be able to consolidate this
 hold because they lack a strong base in the provinces
 and in the army, and have little practical administra-
 tive experience.  Thus, neither Wang Hung-wen or Yao
 Wen-yuan (long abused by Soviet propaganda) is expected
 to be able to fill Mao's shoes.  Chou En-lai is said
 to be regarded with suspicion by Mao and will not be
 able to rally sufficient forces to gain predominance.
 Other current leaders, such as Teng Hsiao-ping, are
 regarded with contempt by the Soviets and are not
 considered to have much staying power.
 In Moscow's view, the political struggle among
 these contending forces will result in a stalemate.
 New policies are not expected to be pursued with any
 consistency as the present generation of Chinese
 leaders kills itself off, politically if not physically.
 During these years of maneuver, however, Moscow will
 have opportunities to propose the expansion of commercial,
 cultural, and diplomatic relations.  These offers will
 be made primarily to show Soviet good will and to gain
 a sense of the direction of the political changes in
 China.  Because of the unsettled leadership struggle
 in China, however, the offers will be made primarily
 to probe Chinese intentions and to prepare the ground
 for more extensive actions when, in Moscow's view, the
 time is ripe.   There is little evidence in Soviet
 25X1           writings                                      hat a force-

 Sino-Soviet Relations and Factions Within China
 Although Moscow sees little hope for improved
 relations with China in the.immediate post-Mao
 years, over the longer run the Soviets are cau-
 tiously confident that China will break with Mao's
 hostility toward Moscow and that the two countries
 will be able to reach some sort of modus vivendi,
 perhaps even a relationship that can be labeled
 detente.
 25X1
 Soviet optimism rests, in part, on the expectation
 that the new generation of Chinese leaders will view
 domestic imperatives and the outside world (including
 the Soviet Union)  from quite different perspectives
 than the current leaders.  Moscow detects a considerable
 diversity of opinion beneath the surface in China and
 expects that in time new forces and ideas will emerge.
 Questions of domestic development, international economic
 relations, and Chinese relations with the Soviet Union
 are among the topics that are considered likely to be
 debated vigorously in the post-Mao years and to be
 answered in terms different from the current orthodoxy
 in Peking.
 This deduction flows from Moscow's strong belief
 that such Maoist campaigns as the Great Leap and the
 Cultural Revolution, as well as Mao's anti-Sovietism,
 are inconsistent with Chinese needs.  Moscow is con-
 vinced that these policies have generated opposition
 within the party and the military which will come to the
 fore after Mao's demise, providing the opportunity for

 improved Sino-Soviet relations.   In its simplest
 terms, this Soviet attitude reflects a conviction
 that China needs Soviet friendship to carry out
 the sort of modernization the Soviet Union knows
 that China wants.  Maoism is seen as an aberration
 that may persist for a time after Mao passes from
 the scene but will ultimately be repudiated.
 Moscow Perceives Chinese Factionalism
 Although Soviet commentary usually portrays
 the Chinese leadership as divided between radical
 and pragmatist, it appears that Moscow does not
 regard these labels as useful analytic tools.  In
 fact, it appears that the USSR does not see a great
 deal of substantive difference between the two fac-
 tions on issues that will matter in the future.
 This is illustrated by the recent observation
 by a Soviet official                         that
 differences in China on   a question or relations
 with the Soviet Union have nothing to do with the
 radical-pragmatist split since members of both groups
 want to improve relations with the Soviet Union.
 Moscow almost certainly thinks that factions
 will decide the post-Mao power struggle, but these
 factions will be split on bureaucratic and func-
 tionalist rather than ideological grounds.  Moscow
 will probably look at this'power struggle in light
 of the one that. followed the death of Lenin and will
 see it as a contest between groups of politicians
 whose thirst for power is stronger than their con-
 sistency or loyalty to labels acquired in the late
 Maoist years.
 Following the death of Lenin, political labels
 and policies played only a subsidiary role in deter-
 mining victor and vanquished as the Soviet leaders
 maneuvered and changed policies to gain supreme power.
 Policies were used largely as a means of gaining

 advantage in the power struggles.  Power was sought
 by a combination of persuasion and force used to
 mobilize large segments of the party on the basis
 of appeals to bureaucratic self-interest and to
 conceptions of national good.
 In post-Mao China, Moscow would assume that
 contenders for power would espouse positions not
 as ends in themselves but as a means to power.
 Chinese factions would adopt certain programs
 because they believed significant portions of the
 party would be convinced--logically, emotionally,
 and by the implied threat of force--that the policies
 were both in the national interest'and in the
 bureaucratic self-interest of these elites.  Starting
 with a conviction that Moscow knows what is best for
 China  (e.g., economic development along Soviet lines
 and greater cohesion with the communist movement)
 and viewing post-Maoist power struggles in light of
 the Soviet past, the USSR would expect to influence
 internal developments in China in a significant way.
 Dealing with the Factions
 Moscow will probably attempt to intervene in the
 contentions for power at strategic moments by identifying
 the interests and needs of vital party and governmental
 organizations as well as the motivations, needs, and
 weaknesses of the major figures who have'a substantial
 constituency within the party.  It will seek to provide
 incentives and rewards to selected groups and elites
 in order to influence them toward improved relations.
 Among those whose voices will be heard in the succes-
 sion struggle will be the militar
 Moscow appears convinced that the military
 or at least important elements within the military
 establishment, would be willing to improve relations
 with the Soviet Union in order to ease the danger of
 a war and in return for access to advanced weapons.

 It is uncertain how much military aid the Soviet
 Union might be willing to provide China after the
 long period of open hostility between the two coun-
 tries.  Moscow's habitual use of military aid as
 an instrument of political influence, however,
 suggests that the Soviet leaders would grant aid
 if they were convinced that it would assist a pro-
 Soviet faction in Peking.
 Moscow also is convinced that vital groups
 within the party are anxious to set out on a path
 of rapid industrial development.  Moscow might
 have some of the same reservations about providing
 economic aid as about military aid, but on balance
 it will probably look upon the promise of economic
 assistance as a useful form of influence during the
 course of the power struggle in China.   Moscow prob-
 ably is now also attempting to identify those within
 the party who would try to consolidate power on the
 basis of a program of rapid development of heavy
 industry.
 A further group that Moscow will hope to influence
 will be the ideologists within the Chinese party.  Rec-
 ognizing that many in this group will hope to'perpetuate
 Mao's hostility toward the USSR, Moscow nevertheless
 will look to the so-called healthy elements within
 the party to seek a reconciliation with the CPSU.  The
 Soviets may harbor the forlorn hope that by drawing
 these elements back into communion with the movement
 as a whole, their prestige and authority will be raised
 at home.
 In attempting to identify, reward, and thereby
 assist policy coalitions and potentially friendly
 figures in post-Mao China, the Soviet Union may offer
 other policy concessions particularly in the border
 dispute.   Since negotiations on this issue began in
 1969, the two sides have made no apparent progress
 largely because of the Chinese demand that Soviet
 forces draw back from the territory along the border

 designated by Peking as "disputed."   Moscow has
 already shown some willingness, however, to com-
 promise on this issue, and
 Soviet officials have suggested
 that further concessions were possible.  One of
 the reasons for delaying these concessions may be
 that Moscow is waiting until the post-Mao years,
 when it hopes to be able to identify and reward
 favored individuals and groups with a timely
 border offer.
 Conceivably, Soviet intervention in Chinese
 affairs could become more direct, particularly if
 the post-Mao power struggles lead to a drastic
 weakening of authority at the center.   In the 1930s
 and 1940s the Soviet Union attempted to exploit
 periods of Chinese weakness, particularly by ex-
 panding its influence and presence in Sinkiang.
 The USSR will not ignore such opportunities if they
 occur again, but it is doubtful that Moscow is de-
 voting much planning to this possibility.
 Prospects and Implications
 We doubt that the Soviets have access to sources
 of information in China that will enable them to
 assess and manipulate events in post-Mao China with
 a high degree of confidence.  Their record in dealing
 with the Chinese Communist Party since it was founded
 in 1921 can hardly give them high expectations of
 success.
 If Moscow again attempts to interject itself
 into Chinese affairs, it will probably hinder rather
 than promote improved relations.  Soviet officials
 themselves, in their less manipulative moments, prob-
 ably recognize this.

 Moscow, nevertheless, probably does not feel
 that it will have many alternatives in dealing
 with post-Mao China.  Neither military interven-
 tion nor total passivity will seem attractive,
 and efforts to manipulate the power struggle may
 be seen as potentially useful without incurring
 major risks of over-involvement.
 Since it sees little or no prospect for improved
 relations with China as long as Mao is in power and
 in the immediate post-Mao period, the Soviet Union
 will probably use this time to try to improve its
 knowledge of Chinese politics and to gain access to
 potentially influential figures.   Moscow's hopeful-
 ness over the longer term implies, moreover, that
 it will avoid major military moves and s' nificant
