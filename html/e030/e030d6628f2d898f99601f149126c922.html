 SUMMARY. CODEL CURTIS MEETING NOVEMBER 13 WITH VICE
 FOREIGN MINISTER WANG HA'I-JUNG PROVIDED NO SURPRISES
 EXCEPT THAT WANG  DID NOT AVAIL HERSELF OF OPPORTUNITY TO
 TAKE SWIPE AT DETENTE.  END SUMMARY.
 1.  IN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTE MEETING NOVEMBER 13 WITH
 SENATOR CURTIS AND HIS FIVE COLLEAGUES AND AMBASSADOR
 GATES,  WANG HAI-JUNG PRESENTED A RATHER RELAXED AND
 CONFIDENT EXTERIOR.
 2.  ON SI NO-SOVIET RELATI O NS, WANG REITERATED
 CHINESE IDEOLOGICAL CRITICISM OF SOVIET REVISIONISM,
 BUT STATED THAT "THE DEBATE OVER PRINCIPLES NEED NOT
 HINDER AND OBSTRUCT STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS." QUESTIONED
 ABOUT SOVIET TROOPS ON CHINA'S BORDER, SHE DISMISSED
 THEM AS TOO SPREAD OUT TO BE A SERIOUS THREAT, AND
 CLAIMED THAT ANY INVASION WOULD BE "ANNIHILATED IN THE
 GREAT SEA  OF A PEOPLE'S WAR."  IN ANY CASE,  SHE SAID,
 THE SOVIET THREAT WAS DIRECTED MAINLY AGAINST THE UNITED
 STATES,  NOT CHINA, SHE EMPHASISED THAT THE UNITED STATES
 AND THE PRC HAVE A  "VERY GREAT POINT  IN COMMON"  IN
 COUNTERING SOVIET AMBITIONS. THROUGHOUT THE TALK,  SHE
 AVOIDED ANY CRITICISM OF DETENTE. SHE CHARACTERIZED THE
 SOVIET UNION AS A WEAKLING, A PAPER TIGER, DUE TO  ITS
 INTERNAL ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND ITS UNPOPULARITY
 ABROAD.
 3,IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT NORMALIZATION, WANG
 REPEATED THE STANDARD THREE POINTS ON TAIWAN: THE U.S.

 HUA WAS LOYAL TO MAO'S REVOLUTIONARY LINE AND POLICIES
 AND WOULD CARRY THEM OUT.  INCLUDING THOSE IN FOREIGN

 "GANG OF FOUR" AS A FULFILLMENT OF WHAT CHAIRMAN MAO
 WOULD HAVE DONE HAD HE LIVED,  AND REPEATED THE NOW

 CURTIS: YES,  WE DID.
 LI:, THAT WAS A MAJOR EVENT IN CHINA. THIS YEAR FIRST PREMIER
 CHOU EN-LAI PASSED AWAY, THEN CHU TEH, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL
 PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, AND THEN OUR GREAT LEADER AND TEACHER CHAIRMAN
 MAO TSE-TUNG?
 CURTIS: WE FOLLOW ALL THE NEWS WE GET FROM CHINA BECAUSE WE VALUE THE
 FRIENDSHIP OF YOUR GREAT COUNTRY. WE WISH TO EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES
 ON THE LOSS OF YOUR LEADERS, PARTICULARLY CHAIRMAN MAO. ALSO, WE
 BRING GREETINGS TO YOU FROM PRESIDENT FORD.
 LI: THANK YOU. WHEN PRESIDENT FORD VISITED CHINA LAST YEAR,
 I MET HIM, PLEASE CONVEY MY GREETINGS TO HIM.
 CURT IS : THANK YOU,  I  WILL DO So. A FEW DAYS BEFORE I LEFT THE U.S.
 I HAD A CALL FROM FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON AND HE ASKED THAT I CONVEY
 HIS GREETINGS TO CHINA AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE.
 LI:  PLEASE CONVEY MY THANKS TO MR.'NIXON.
 CURTIS: YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT WHEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF
 OUR VISIT WAS MADE, ALL OF US EXPERIENCED A TREMDNDOUS RESPONSE
 FROM  OUR PEOPLE WHO EXPRESSED A GREAT INTEREST IN CHINA. MY
 NEBRASKA CONSTITUENTS WERE DELIGHTED THAT WE WERE MAKING THIS TRIP.
 LI: YOUR STATE HAS A HIGHLY DEVELOPED AGRICULTURE.
 CURTIS: YES,'WE ARE A GREAT AGRICULTURAL STATE. A NUMBER OF
 THE SENATORS HERE REPRESENT AGRICULTURAL STATES AND WE HAVE BEEN
 TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED BY THE INDUSTRIOUSNESS OF YOUR AGRICULTURAL
 W ORKERS.
 LI: SENATOR YOUNG, YOU ARE ALSO FROM AN AGRICULTURAL STATE,  I
 BELIEVE.
 YOUNG:  I'M A F ARMER MYSELF AND MY THREE SONS F ARM, ONE OF THE
 AMAZING THINGS TO ME IS THAT YOUR LAND HAS BEEN PRODUCING FOR
 2,000 YEARS OR MORE AND PRODUCES JUST AS WELL AS OURS WHICH HAS
 BEEN PRODUCING FOR ONLY A LITTLE OVER EEONE ONE-HUNDRED YEARS.

 LI:  IN THE PAST 2,000 YEARS OR MORE WE WERE UNDER FEUDAL RULE
 AND PRODUCTION WAS RESTRAINED. AFTERWARDS, THERE WAS AGGRESSION
 BY FOREIGN IMPERIALIST STATES SO OUR AGRICULTURE DID NOT DEVELOP.
 BEFORE LIBERATION (IN 1949) PRODUCTION WAS BACKWARD IN CHINA
 AND NOT ONLY DRAFT ANIMALS BUT ALSO HUMAN BEINGS HAD TO
 PULL PLOWS. THERE WAS THE RUTHLESS PLUNDER BY.LANDLORDS
 AND BUREAUTCRATICMCAPITALISTS,  AS WELL AS BY  IMPERIALISTS. SO
 PEASANTS
 AT THAT TIME WERE IN A DIRE PLIGHT.  IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT
 SEVERAL MILLION PEASANTS STARVED TO DEATH. THAT WAS THE
 SITUATION DURING THE FEUDAL DYNASTIES AND UNDER CHIANG KAI-SHEK
 RULE.  YOU MIGHT VERY WELL STUDY WHY CHIANG KAI-SHEK FELL,
 THERE MUST BE SOME REASONS BEHIND IT.  IT WAS BECAUSE HE
 OFFENDED THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, ABOVE ALL HE OFFENDED THE
 PEASANTS AND WORKERS. NOW IN CHINA, WITH SUCH A VAST TERRITORY
 AND 800 MILLION PEOPLE, WE HAVE SOLVED THE FOOD PROBLEM  IN T H
 MAIN,  SO PEOPLE WON'T STARVE TO DEATH OR; DIE OF COLD. THIS WAS
 THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT MADE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN MAO
 AND BY RELYING ON THE EFFORTS OF THE BROAD MASSES OF PEOPLE.
 BUT WE ARE NOT SATISFIED. JUST_NOW I SAID WE HAD SOLVED
 THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE MAIN.  IT IS NOT YET COMPLETELY SOLVED AND
 WE MUST CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS.  WE JUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FOOD GRAIN
 TO FEED OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE SOME TO EXPORT BUT WE ALSO IMPORT
 SOME.  THE AMOUNT IS LIMITED COMPARED TG , YOURS.  WE EXPORT
 ONE OR TWO MILLION TONS AND IMPORT ABOUT THE SAME. WE MUST
 RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS AND RUN EVERYTHING WITH OUR OWN STRENGTH.
 CURTIS:  I WISH TO COMEND YOU ON YOUR GREAT PROGRESS, AND ON
 YOUR DETERMINATION TO Be SELF-SUFFICIENT IN FOOD, YOU HAVE DONE A
 GREAT JOB.  I  UNDERSTAND YOUR E=XPORTS  INCLUDE: SOME RICE.  IS THAT
 RIGHT?
 LI:  WE EXPORT SOME RICE AND SOY BEANS.
 CURTIS:  WHAT DO  YOU IMPORT?
 LI : A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WHEA T, A LSO  SOME FOOD GRAINS FROM
 YOUR COUNTRY.
 CURTIS: WHILE WE COMMEND YOUR DETERMINATION TO BE
 SELF-SUFFICIENT    IN FOOD GRAIN.  IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ANY,  PLEASE
 COME TO US. SENATOR YOUNG IS A WHEAT FARMER AND SO IS
 SENATOR BAYH?

 CURTIS: THEN WE MUST BUY SOMETHING FROM YOU. DO YOU HAVE SOME
 OIL TO SELL US?
 LI: WE ARE JUST SELF-SUFFICIENT IN OIL. OUR SURPLUS IS
 NOT MUCH. OF COURSE WE HAVE BIG OIL DEPOSITS.
 CURTIS: WE UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IS VERY GREAT.
 LI:  YES, YOU'RE RIGHT, FURTHER EFFORTS SHOULD.BE MADE FOR
 EXPLORATION.  OUR OIL INDUSTRY IS STILL VERY YOUNG AND IN THE
 PAST WE HAD VERY LITTLE.  IN 1960 WE BEGAN TO HAVE OUR OWN OIL
 INDUSTRY. BUT WE HAD TO IMPORT OIL FROM OTHtRS, ESPECIALLY
 FROM OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH WHO TRIED TO STRANGLE US.

 BAD RELATIONS.
 CURTIS: WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY NEIGHBORLY.
 LI!  THEY SEEK HEGEMONY.
 CURTIS:  THE MAJOR REASON THE U.S. SPENDS SO MUCH TO STAY STRONG
 MILITARILY IS THAT WE FEEL THAT WILL RETARD ANY CHANCE THAT THE SOVIET
 UNION WILL TRY AGGRESSION.
 LI:  THE SOVIETS HAVE BIG AMBITIONS, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE
 WHOLE GLOBE. BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT BECAUSE
 THEIR STRENGTH IS NOT THAT GREAT. POLITICALLY. THEY SEEK HEGEMONY
 NO MATTER WHAT TRICKS OR FINE WORDS- THEY USE, THEY WILL EVENTUALLY
 BE EXPOSED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. THEIR SEEKING HEGEMONY
 MAKES THEM THE ENEMY  OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE. AT HOME THERE IS
 LOPSIDED DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOVIET ECONOMY,  THERE  IS NOT ENOUGH
 FOOD TO EAT, NOT ENOUGH FOOD GRAINS. SOME PEOPLE SATIRIZE THE
 SOVIET UNION BY SAYING THE SOVIETS SOW SEEDS IN
 THE UKRAINE AND HARVEST CROPS  IN THE US.
 THEIR TOP PRIORITY  IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE  AND  IN

 FEEBLE.
 CURT IS t YOU HAVE HAD A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER AND YOU
 ARE A STUDENT OF ECONOMICS. WHY IN YOUR OPINION IS THE SOVIET
 ECONOMY WEAK?
 LI:  I'M NO STUDENT OF ECONOMICS.  I'M NOT A SCHOLAR OF ECONOMICS.
 BUT I DID FIGHT IN THE WAR.  IN MY VIEW, THE SOVIET UNION HAS
 OFFENDED THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND BROAD MASSES OF. THE PEOPLE,
 THEREFORE THERE IS NO ENTHUSIASM ON THEIR PART.  IN PLANNING,  THEY
 GIVE PROMINENCE TO DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. OTHER BRANCHES
 OF INDUSTRY     MACHINE BUILDING, CHEMICALS, ETC, -- ARE LAGGING BE-
 HIND.      IN RELATIONS BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE, THEY
 NEGLECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE. YOU CAN STUDY WHETHER OR
 NOT I'M RIGHT.  IN THE SOVIET UNION LINE, PRINCIPLES, AND
 POLICIES ARE ALL WRONG. THEY PRACTICE REVISIONISM AND FASCISM,
 AND THERE  IS NO WAY TO MOB IL ICE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE WORKERS,
 PEASANTS AND OTHER PEOPLE.
 CURTIS! WE IN THE U.S. ARE VERY AWARE OF.THE' SOVIET MILITARY
 THREAT AND THE GREAT SUMS THEY  ARE SPENDING ON ARMAMENTS. THAT IS
 WHY WE INTEND TO STAY STRONG,  WHY WE MAKE SACRIFICES IN MANY
 PARTS OF THE WORLD TO RESIST SOVIET AGGRESSION.
 LI: WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF SOVIET MILITARY STRENGTH, BUT THEY
 TALK OF DISARMAMENT EVERY DAY.
 CURT IS: DO YOU THINK TIE SOVIETS HAVE PLANS FOR WESTERN EUROPE IF
 THEY ARE NOT RESISTED?
 LI: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PLANS? THE SOVIETS THINK FIRST OF ALL
 ABOUT EUROPE.
 CURTIS:  I MEAN AGGRESSIVE PLANS.
 LI:  SOME PEOPLE  IN THE WORLD TEND TO THINK THAT THE FOCUS
 OF SOVIET STRATEGY LIES IN THE EAST. CHAIRMAN MAO THOUGHT THAT.
 THE SOVIET STRATEG IC FOCUS WAS IN EUROPE,  INCLUDING THE MIDDLE
 EAST.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL SLACKEN OUR VIGILANCE.  WE ARE
 HEIGHTENING OUR VIGILANCE.  THAT IS WHY  WE DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND
 STORE GRAIN EVERYWHERE. BY DIGGING TUNNELS DEEP WE MEAN IF THE
 SOVIETS INVADE US WE WILL FIGHT BACK. MAO TAUGHT US TO PREPARE
 AGAINST WAR, PREPARE AGAINST NATURAL DISASTERS,   AND DO EVERYTHING
 FOR THE PEOPLE. BY PREPARING FOR WAR WE MEAN IF THE SOVIETS ATTACK

 LII WE HOPE YOU WILL ESTABLISH AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP WITH EUROPE
 AND ALL OTHER PEOPLES OF THE WORLD?
 CURTISI DO THE SOVIETS HAVE MANY TROOPS ON YOUR BORDERS?
 LI I THEY CLAIM TO HAVE STATIONED ABOUT ONE MILLION TROOPS ON THE
 BORDER. THE BORDER EXTENDS OVER MANY THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS. ITS
 A LONG FRONT LINE;I DO YOU THINK THE ONE MILLION TROOPS ARE
 DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA ONLY? I THINK THEY ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED
 AGAINST THE U,S.1 THEN AGAINST JAPAN, AND-OF COURSE ARE ALSO
 DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA. ONE MILLION TROOPS IS NOT. ENOUGH TO FIGHT
 AGAINST CHINA, EVEN IF THEY ADDED ANOTHER ONE MILLION IT WOULD
 NOT BE ENOUGH, NOR EVEN TWO MILLION MORE.. IF THE SOVIETS COME,
 WE'LL YIELD SOME PLACES TO THEM. THEN CLOSE OUR DOOR AND BEAT THE
 DOG INSIDE THE ROOM. WHEN THE DOOR IS CLOSED,  IT-IS EASIER TO,
 DEAL WITH THE DOG AND TO BEAT THE DOG. THAT WAS THE WAY WE
 FOUGHT THE JAPANESE. WE CLOSED THE DOOR AND THOROUGHLY
 ANNIHILATED THE JAPANESE, AT THAT TIKE, CHINA WAS RULED BY
 CHIANG KAIj-SHEK AND LARGE TRACTS 'OF TERRITORY IN THE NORTH AND
 CENTRAL CHINA WERE LEFT TO US BECAUSE CHIANG KAIw$HEK RAN AWAY.
 CHIANG KAI-SHEK FIRST RAN FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE JAPANESE
 OCCUPIED IT. THEN FROM NORTH. CENTRAL, SOUTH AND EAST CHINA.
 CHIANG KAI-SHEK TROOPS WERE RUNNING IN,FRONT OF THE JAPANESE AND
 OUR TROOPS WERE RUNNING AFTER THE JAPANESE. THEY TURNED THEIR
 BACKS Tv" THE JAPANESE BUT?WE FACED THE JAPANESE. DURING THE WAR
 OF RESISTANCE AGAINST THE JAPANESE t NORTH, CENTRAL, EVEN EAST AND
 SOUTH CHINA WAS LED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY. SO ONE MILLION
 SOVIET TROOPS ON THE BORDER WILL BE NO MATCH FOR US.
 IN FINAL ANALYSIS; THE FOCUS OF THE SOVIET STRATEGY IS EUROPE,
 MY FRIENDS MAY NOT BELIEVE MY WORDS BUT FACTS WILL BEAR ME
 OUT, AS FOR THE DISARMAMENT THEY ARE ALWAYS
 TALKING ABOUT. WE DON'T BELIEVE IT.   IC

 LIs YOU FLATTER ME.
 BAYH= THIS HAS BEEN A LONG PROLOGUE.  I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHT
 S
 ON WHAT I THINK OUR WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, AS I UNDERSTAND
 SOMETIME THIS YEAR YOU WILL PROMULGATE YOUR FIFTH FIVE YEAR PLAN OF
 YOUR COUNTRY. ARE THERE ELEMENTS IN THIS PLAN WHICH YOU COULD DISCLOS
 .E
 TO US IN WHICH A CLOSER
 RELATIONSHIP  OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US
 COULD BE BENEFICIAL? ARE THERE WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD BE OF ASSISTANC
 E     .
 -- ALTHOUGH I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR STRONG FEELING OF SELF-RELIANCE --
 TRADE OPPORTUNITIES, MACHINERY, FACTORIES,  EQUIPMENT AND A LARGE
 RANGE OF AREAS WHICH COULD BE PART OF THE,
 CONTINUING RELATIONSHIP BETEWEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES?
 LIr  SPEAKING ABOUT OUR PLAN IS COMPLEX AND INVOLVES LOTS OF
 ASPECTS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.
 DURING HIS LIFETIME, CHAIRMAN MAO NOT ONLY LAID DOWN THE BASIC
 LINE FOR POLICY FIJT ALSO THE BASIC LINE AND
 PRINCIPLES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. THESE PRINCIPLES WERE
 STATED IN THE REPORT BY THE LATE PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI AT THE FOURTH NP
 C.
 HE DISCUSSED THE MODERNIZATION OF INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE. NATIONAL
 DEFENSE,  AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.  IN MAKING ECONOMIC PLANS,  WE
 MUST FIRST THINK OF THE 800 MILLION PEOPLE AND BEAR
 IN MIND THE FOOD, CLOTHING AND HOUSING PROBLEMS OF 800 MILLION PEOPLE
 SO WE PLAN THE ECONOMY IN THE ORDER OF AGRICULTURE, LIGHT INDUSTRY

 AND HEAVY INDUSTRY. THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE TEACHINGS OF CHAIRMA
 N
 MAO THAT WE MUST FIRST DEVELOP AGRICULTURE.  IF WE DONUT HAVE ENOUGH
 FOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE, EVEN IF WE IMPORT 10 OR 20 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN
 THIS WOULD NOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEM.  IF AGRICULTURE IS DEVELOPED.                      IT
 IS EASIER TO DEVELOP LIGHT INDUSTRY,. AND HEAVY INDUSTRY WILL HAVE A
 SOLID FOUNDATION, SO WE MAKE OUR PLANS ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE.
 WE HAVE A PLAN BUT IT IS NOT YET FINALIZED. WE HAVE NO INTENT
 MAKING  IT PUB... THE PLAN HAS NOT YET MATURED           STILL UNDER
 "DTSD       N.  IN DISCUSSING IT WE MAY FIND NEWW PROBLEMS AND REVISE THE
 PLAN, AS    FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY
 TRADE,  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  WE HAVE BOUGHT SOME EQUIPMENT FROM THE
 us
 --SUCH AS CHEMICAL FERTILIZER PLANTS.
 BAYHS  THE KELLOGG UREA PLANTS.
 LI:  IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE_E;D PHIS AND ARE ABLE TO DO  IT. THE
 QUESTION OF NECESSITY;IS EASY. RUT IF WE. ASK OUR MINISTER+ HE WILL
 .
 ASK FOR MANY THINGS.  AS FOR OUR ABILITY.  THAT  IS VERY DjILLUO
 WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY, ONT-R-TNCIPLI  WE RELY ON OUR OWN
 EFFORTS. MAINLY WE RELY ON OUR OWN EFFOR'TS. WE DO NOT PLAN TO BE IN
 DEBT. WE WERE ONCE IN DEBT TO THE SOVIET UNION. OUR DEBTS TO THE SOVI
 ET
 UNION WERE INCURRED IN 1950-51 DURING THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AGAINST
 THE U.S. AND TO ASSIST KOREA.  WE FOUGHT A WAR IN THAT COUNTRY, OUR
 TWO COUNTRIES.  IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE A DEBTOR,
 BAYHi  IT  IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE A CREDITOR OF THE SOVIETS EITHER.
 L I : EEa  a  .THE SS O____I ET1lN I a  .FINDS IZ__P_LZASANT. THEN WE MADE
 OUR MINDS UP TO REPAY ALL DEBTS TO THE SOVIET UNION.  AFTER THAT WE
 NEVER  INCURRED ANY FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC DEBTS,  ONCE WE  ISSUED PUBLIC
 BONDS BUT W E LATER REPAID  THEM.           SO A S TO TRADE BETWEEN OUR
 TWO COUNTRIES,  WE'LL HAVE TO SE.            I HAVE JUST  SAID THAT  IT DEPENDS ON
 NECESSITT AND ABILITY.  ANOTHER THING  IS YOUR HIGH TARRIFF WHICH  IS
 TROUBLESOME. I  THINK IT IS NOT EASY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR THE
 TIME BEING. ROUGHLY THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AT THE PRESENT STAGE.  I
 THINK WE  IMPORT MORE FROM THE U.S.  THAN YOU DO FROM US.
 BAYH:  YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE.
 WHAT  I  ASKED WAS IN RESPECT TO OUR FUTURE RELATIONS.  I THINK THAT TO
 THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN  INCREASE TRADE OPPORTUNITIES,   PERMIT MORE
 PEOPLE OF THE US TO VISIT CHINA AND MORE ?CHINESE TO VISIT THE U.S.

 STAYING OUT OF DEBT. THANK YOU.
 HOLLINGS: MR. VICE PREMIER,  I  APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY
 AND I AM PARTICULARLY HONORED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU,
 SINCE YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE U.S. AS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE
 VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH AND AS A PARTNER WITH CHAIRMAN MAO
 AND PREMIER GHOU IN THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA.
 LI: WELL WORK STILL HARDER TO BUILD OUR COUNTRY UNDER THE
 LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA,  RELYING
 ON THE EFFORTS  OF THE PROPLE.
 HOLLINGS: AS A SENATOR,  I MUST POINT OUT THAT I SPEAK INDIVIDUALLY.
 WE ARE TOLD THATANYTHING A U.S. SENATOR MAY UTTER IS CONSIDERED
 A POSITION OF THE USG. THAT IS NOT TRUE. EACH ONE OF US SPEAKS FOR
 HIMSELF. THERE ARE FIVE OTHER SENATORS HERE: AND THEY DO NOT
 SPEAK FOR ME AND I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEM. I. BELIEVE YOU HAVE AN
 INVESTMENT IN THE TIME AND EFFORT IT TOOK TO BRING ME
 ALL  THE WA'Y TO CHINA AND I WISH, TOi SPEAK FRANKLY.  SPEAKING FOR
 MYSELF,
 WE BELIEVE  IN,THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI  COMMUNIQUE AND WE
 BELIEVE WE ARE ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLES, AND AS THE COMMUNIQUE
 STATES,  AS TENSIONS EASE, WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS UNDER THE
 SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. WE BELIEVE THIS TRIP,SO GENEROUSLY PROVIDED TO
 US. HAS HELPED TO EASE TENSIONS AND CERTAINLY HAS-ENHANCED MY UNDER-
 STANDING AND APPRECIATION OF CHINA. AS SENATOR,  I BELIEVE THAT THERE
 IS ONE CHINA AND THAT  YOU ARE THAT CHINA.
 LI:  YOU'RE RIGHT.
 HOLLINGS: HOWEVER, WE HAVE HAD FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING ON
 TAIWAN AND AS A SENATOR,  I  DON'T BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF THE
 U.S. SENATORS WOULD ABRUPTLY ABANDON THAT FRIENDSHIP,  A JOURNEY OF
 1,000 MILES,  THEY SAY IN CHINA,  BEGINS  WITH ONE STEP. I  THINK WE
 SHOULD MAKE STEPS TOGETHER TO  TRY  TO INCREASE TRADE,

 OPEN AIR ROUTES, AND,ON OUR SIDE REDUCE TROOPS ON TAIWAN TO
 MAKE STEPS TO THE REALIZATION OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE
 PRINCIPLES. WE IN THE US HAVE NEVER. BELIEVED IN HEGEMONY. THE FACT IN
 OUR LONG HISTORY IS THAT WE GAVE FREEDOM TO THE PHILIPPINES
 AND CUBA.
 AFTER WORLD WAR  11  IN WHICH WE DEFEATED GERMANY,  ITALY,  AND JAPAN,
 WE NOT ONLY  GAVE THEM FREEDOM BUT ALSO' FINANCED THEIR RECOVERY.

 k,,WE ABSOLUTELY REFUTE THAT BY  OUR  OWN ACTS OVER 200 YEARS
 HS,~   OF HISTORY.        SH NOTHING BUT FREEDOM FOR THE PEOPLES AND I THINK
 THE U.S. AND CHINA WORKING TOGETHER COULD BRING ABOUT FREEDOM AND
 ECONOMIC SUSTENANCE TO THE THIRD WORLD.
 I'M SURE THIS VISIT HAS SERVED AS A PLATFORM OR STJATING POINT rnR
 ....tE,, AS A SENATOR TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE GREATNESS OF CHINA
 AND I HOPE SIMILAR VISITS BY, Ycl R DISTINGUISHED LEADERS TO THE U.S.
 WILL FOLLOW.
 LI: HOW CAN WE GO TO THE US SINCE THE EMBASSY OF THE TAIWAN CLIQUE IS
 THERE?
 HOLLINGS: THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE WILL HAVE TO SOLVE
 AND WE IN THE SENATE W ILL BE WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM.
 LI: THE SOLUTION MUST CONFORM TO THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.
 CURTIS: SENATOR S.TEVENS OF ALASKA.
 LI:  THAT  IS THE NORTHERNMOST STATE.
 STEVENS:     YES WE ARE.  ALASKA  IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO YUNNAN PROVINCE
 WHERE I WAS STATIONED DURING THE WAR.  IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW
 THAT THOSE?OF US IN THE AIR FORCE HERE HAD GREAT RES SECT FOR YOUR
 PEOPLE IN NTH E NORTH. MY SQUADRON SUPPLIED YOUR TROOPS AT TIMES.  YOU
 SPEAK THE TRUTH WHEN YOU SAY YOU REALLY FOUGHT THE JAPANESE. WE
 KNEW THAT AND RESPECTED YOU FOR  IT. MY LARGE COLLEAGUE FROM THE
 SOUTH,
 HE SPEAKS CANDIDLY AND WE RESPECT HIS CANDOR. BUT I'D LIKE TO
 PURSUE HIS POINT.  ISN'T THERE SOME WAY  E COULD START THE FLOW
 OF VISITS BOTH WAYS? WE HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN CONGRESS IN BEING
 ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON  THE  IMPLICATIONS OF  THIS RELATIONSHIP
 BASED ON A  LACK OF UNDERSTANDING . YOUR PEOPLE HAVE DOUBLED SINCE I
 WAS HERE.  YOUR HOUSING AND FOOD PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED,  BUT THAT
 WORD ISN'T G ETTIN3 BACK TO THE U.S.  WE NEED: MORE OF OUR PEOPLE
 COMING THIS WAY BUT ALSO MORE OF YOUR PEOPLE COMING TO THE U.S.  TO

 SOVIETS IN DAYS TO COME.  WHAT THE SOVIET UNION SAYS IS  ACTUALLY
 UNBELIEVABLE AND IS MEANT TO DECEIVE PEOPLE.  THEY TALK OF SHAM
 THINGS. THIS CONCLUSION IS DRAWN FROM THE CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES
 OF THE SOVIET UNION.
 CURTIS:  I CAN SHARE YOUR OPINION.  I HAVE GREAT DOUBTS OF MANY
 THINGS THEY SAY.  I REGARD THEM AS ADVENTURERS .AND A POTENTIAL
 THREAT. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER PUT TO ASK WHAT SHOULD BE OUR
 COURSE OF ACTION WITH REGARD TO   THE SOVIET UNION.
 WANG: WHAT COURSE THE U.S.  WILL TAKE IS A MATTER FOR THE U.S.
 GOVERNMENT.  THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE  IS TO EXPOSE THEIR
 SCHEMES,  CRITICIZING  AND REPUDIATING THEIR SCHEMES, AND EXPOSING
 THEIR DECEPTIONS AND FALLACIES AND ADOPTING A TIT-FOR-TAT STRUGGLE
 AGAINST THEM.  IN DEALING  WITH SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM, CHINA AND
 THE U.S.. HAVE A VERY GREAT POINT  IN COMMON.  OUR DIFFERENCE OF
 PRINCIPLE WITH THE SOVIET UNION MUST CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT.
 BUT THE DEBATE ON PRINCIPLES NEED NOT HINDER AND OBSTRUCT STATE
 RELATIONS. BUT WE HOLD THAT THE SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISTS HAVE

 IMPERIALISTIC NATURE WILL NEVER CHA'IGE+
 CURTIS:  DO YOU FEEL THE SOVIETS ARE A THREAT TO YOUR BORDER?
 WANG S PEOPLE- SAY THEY HAVE DEPLOYED ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG THE
 BORDER.  ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG A BORDERLINE OF MORE THAN 7,000
 KILOMETERS,  WHAT USE IS IT TO STATION SO MANY TROOPS ON SUCH A
 LONG BORDERLINE?  I F THEY DARE TO MOUNT AN INVASION AGAINST US,
 JIM SURE THEY WILL BE ANNIHILATED IN THE GREAT SEA OF A PEOPLE'S
 WAR, OUR POLICY IS:  "WE WILL NOT ATTACK UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED.
 IF ATTACKED WE WILL CERTAINLY COUNTER-ATTACK." WE HAVE NO FEAR OF
 THEM, THE SOVIET THREAT IS MAINLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE U.S.
 CURT IS:  WHY DO THEY THREATEN THE U.S.?
 WANG., BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STRIVE FOR WORLD HEGEMONY. YOU HAVE
 INTERESTS IN THE WORLD TO DEFEND 'AND THE SOVIET UNION SEEKS TO
 EXPAND.   IN OUR VIEW,  SUCH A SITUATION WILL NEVER CHANGE.
 CURT IS S I AGREE THAT THEY ARE A SERIOUS ADVERSARY  AND I AM
 INTERESTED IN YOUR VIEWS REGARDING THEM.
 WANG: SUPERFICIALLY, SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM APPEARS WILDLY
 AMBITIOUS, BUT ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERY WEAK,  THE IMPERIALISTIC NATURE
 OF THEIR POLICIES CAUSES THEM TO CARRY OUT AGGRESSION, EXPANSION,
 AND TO BULLY OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT ESSENTIALLY
 THEY ARE WEAK,  ALTHOUGH WILDLY AMBITIOUS,  IF' THEY CONTINUE

 PERMIT NO FREEDOM TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE,  AND HAVE AMBITIONS TO

 OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE TO.MOVE TOWARDS NORMALIEAT'ION?
 WANG:  OF COURSE,  THE LINES AND POLICIES FbRMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO
 ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN PO].ICY AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL
 COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA.  WE WILL RESOLUTELY IMPLEMENT
 SUCH LINES AND POLICIES.  ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION BETWEEN
 OUR-TWO COUNTRIES, AS I HAVE OFTEN
 STATED TO  AMERICAN FRIENDS AND MR. GATES OF THE LIAISON OFFICE
 UNDERSTANDS WELL,  IF BOTH PARTIES ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE
 SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA CAN BE
 IMPROVED.  THIS WAS STATED BY PREMIER CHOU IN HIS REPORT TO THE
 FOURTH NPC. ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION BETWEEN OUR TWO
 COUNTRIES,  WE-HAVE THREE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE HAVE TIME AND AGAIN
 STATED,  I AM SURE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH'THEM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
 CLEARLY STATE THEM FOR YOU.  THE THREE PRINCIPLES ARE: SEVER
 DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND TAIWAN; WITHDRAWAL OF-
 AMERICAN TROOPS FROM TAIWAN, AND ABROGATION OF THE SO-CALLED
 DEFENSE TREATY WITH TAIWAN.  THESE ARE  INSEPARABLE AND  INDISPEN-
 SABLE. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. ON THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN,
 WE DO  NOT BELIEVE  IN THE SO-CALLED PEACEFUL-TRANSITION. CHAIRMAN
 TAUGHT US "WHERE THE BROOM DOESN'T REACH, DUST WILL NOT RUN AWAY
 BY ITSELF."  IN TAIWAN, THERE IS STILL A BUNCH OF COUNTER-REVO-
 LUTIONARIES.  OUR$_TAND ON TAIWAN IS THAT WE BASE OURSELVES ON
 _-A_.F00.I_IN G TO FIG HT. AS TO WHEN WE WILL LIBERATE TAIWAN AND THE
 METHODS WE_WILL ADOPT TO LIBERATE TAIWAN, THIS IS PURELY AN
 INTERNAL MATTER FOR CHINA AND NO OTHER NATION HAS,THE RIGHT TO
 INTERFERE WHATSOEVER, SINCE YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE,  I HAVE STATED
 OUR CONSISTENT STAND VERY CANDIDLY.
 BAYH:  I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR?  OUR NATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO
 THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE ALTHOUGH WE REALISE THERE MIGHT BE
 SOME DIFFICULTIES, BUT WE ARE DEDICATED TO THIS PURPOSE AND

 MENTIONED. ONE LAST THING--
 AFTER TALKING WITH OUTSTANDING LEADERS LIKE YOURSELF,  AND
 MEETING WITH OUR HOSTS WHO ARE. OUTSTANDING AMBASSADORS OF GOOD-
 WILL,  I  AM CONVINCED THAT OUR TWO  NATIONS HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER
 TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE WORLD.  I AM CERTAIN THAT IF OUR TWO
 NATIONS ARE INTERESTED IN SOLVING THESE QUESTIONS, WE CAN FIND A
 METHOD TO RESOLVE OUR DIFFERENCES.
 WANG: BETWEEN FRIENDS,  WE CAN HAVE A CANDID EXCHANGE OF
 VIEWS. BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. THERE ARE MANY COMMON POINTS ON
 MANY ISSUES.  THE BIG ISSUE IS THE INTERNATIONAL ONE, TAIWAN IS A
 MINOR ISSUE. A` _QNG._T-E_  ANYCOMMON

 OUR NORTHERN SOCALLED ALL-Y._.
 BAYHI  WE NAVE A SAYING.. THAT WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT WE DON'T
 NEED ENEMIES.
 CURT IS: WE DO HAVE SOMETHING VERY MUCH IN COMMON --  THE PROTECTION
 OF THINGS WE HOLD DEAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS, JUST AS YOU HAVE. THE
 FACT THAT YOU EXTENDED AN INVITATION TO  US AND THAT WE WERE ABLE
 TO ACCEPT  IT HAS LED TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING.  I COMMEND YOU ON
 INVITING US TO VISIT HERE. WE ALSO COMMEND YOU ON YOUR STATEMENT
 THAT THE LARGE PICTURE IS WORLD AFFAIRS, AND THE WELFARE OF YOUR
 GREAT COUNTRY AND OUR COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOVIET UNION.
 WE ALSO FEEL THAT WAY, WE ARE PLEASED TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE
 PROBLEM  OF TAIWAN  IS SECONDARY TO THESE WORLD PROBLEMS.  TAIWAN IS

 TIME TO SPEAK. THIS FIRST VISIT TO CHINA HAS BEEN AN EYE-OPENER.
 AS MUCH AS I HAD RESPECTED YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR PEOPLE,  I NOW
 RESPECT THEM EVEN MORE.  I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR
 MORE CHINESE TO COME TO THE U.S.  I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SLIGHT
 SUGGESTION.  I AM CONVINCED IT CAN RESOLVE SOME PROBLEMS.
 RELATIONS COULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE THROUGH BROADER EXCHANGE
 PROGRAMS, MORE TRADE, AND OTHER WAYS OF GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER
 BETTER. WE'VE HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE ARE ONLY SIX OF US.

 WANG: SINCE THE DOORS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US WERE OPENED BY
 YO UR FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON.  AND BY CHAIRMAN MAO,  AND AF' TER  THE
 ISSUANCE OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW
 EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND  THE  U.S.
 CURT IS: YOU HAVE BEEN A MOST GRACIOUS HOSTESS. BEFORE WE END,      I
 WONDER IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
 YOUNG. WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO KNOW YOU
 BETTER,  WE WILL KNOW YOU MORE IN THE FUTURE. THE U.S.  IS SPREAD
 THINLY OVER THE WORLD BUT WE ARE BOUND NOT BECOME SECOND TO THE
 SOVIET UNION-  STILL, THERE ARE PROBLEMS -- THE PHILIPPINES WANT US
 TO REMOVE OUR BASES. WE HAVE PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THAT'S
 WHY WE NEED FRIENDS LIKE YOU.

 SENATOR BAYH HAS POINTED OUT, THIS VISIT HAS BEEN AN EYE OPENER.
 CHINA HAS A BIG PART OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AND THE U.S.
 AND CHINA SHOULD,BE WORKING TOGETHER FOR PEACE IN THE FUTURE.
 I  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET
 YOU THIS AFTERNOONS
 STEVENS:  I THANK YOU TOO. THIS HAS BEEN A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME AND
 IT IS MOST MEMORABLE FOR ME TO COME BACK AGAIN.  I  WOULD LIKE AT
 SOME TIME TO EXPLORE WHY WE CANNOT HAVE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT LEAD
 TOWARDS NORMALIZATION PRIOR TO THE REALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES
 YOU HAVE MENTIONED,  SUCH AS AIR ROUTES, EXPANSION OF EXCHANGES.
 I_ THINK, AND IT MAY BE IMPORTANT, SOMETIMES I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE
 FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE FACE, AND INCREASED
 EXCHANGES WOULD  HELP YOU BECOME  'AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS.
 JOHNSTON: MADAME  VICE FOREIGN MINISTER,  I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY

 STATINTL      FROM:
 Sorry I didn't get these to you sooner.
 The top two USLO cables are summaries of
 talks that the Curtis Delegation had with
 Li Hsien-nien and Wang Hai-jung.   I've also
 added the full text of each meeting.
 Senator Bayh posed the questions on the
 Chinese economy to Li at my suggestion.   Most
 analysts here and at State consider the Chine
 not giving anything away but they are general
 d
 following the more moderate tone reflecte
 in talks with Schlesinger and Mansfield.
