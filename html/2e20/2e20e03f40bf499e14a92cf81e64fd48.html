 One man's war for access to UFO secrets
 Meet the man who probably knows more about Unidentified Flying Objects
 than any other private citizen in the world. His name is Colman S. VonKeviczky
 and he owns a gigantic collection of some 9,000 slides and photos of UFOs as
 well as reams of formerly classified U.S. government documents on the sub-
 ject. By Hal McKenzie.
 Salvador chief pleads for `moral support'
 President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador made a recent trip to Washing-
 ton where he spoke to President Reagan and other top policymakers. In a
 speech before the National Press Club, he accused the mass media of sen-
 sationalizing the violence in his nation and pleaded for "moral support." Robert
 Morton reports from Washington.
 How South Koreans view the future
 A recent survey by a major newspaper in Seoul sheds light on South Koreans'
 attitudes and views of the future. Most Koreans feel much better about the
 United States, but are pessimistic about chances of reunifying their nation in
 the next decade. The wide-ranging poll also revealed that two-thirds of Kore-
 ans feel that it is improper for an engaged couple to kiss before marriage. Tim
 Elder reports from Seoul.
 Moscow, lbkyo clash over northern islands
 When the Soviet Union seized four seemingly insignificant islands off Hok-
 kaido at the end of World War II, it provided Japan with one of the rare issues
 on which most Japanese can agree. Increasingly, the Kremlin's refusal to turn
 over the islands presents a barrier to improved relations between lbkyo and
 Moscow. By David Hulme in lbkyo.
 Seoul seeking improved ties with Peking
 South Korea and China have compelling reasons to improve relations, but
 major obstacles still stand in the way. For Seoul, improved ties with Peking
 could help ease tension on the Korean peninsula. For Peking, the lure is South
 Korea's dynamic young economy and enhanced opportunities for trade. David
 Hulme reports from Seoul.
 A modern adaptation of age-old laws
 The swing toward Orthodox observance that marks the administration of
 Prime Minister Menachem Begin has focused the spotlight on a little-known
 institute that combines religion and science. Evans Johnson reports from Jeru-
 salem.
 Split on arms issue threatens Germany
 As West Germany braces fora demonstration against nuclear arms by pacifists
 and environmentalists, other Germans demonstrate at the polls their concern
 at the direction the ruling Social Democrats are taking. Jeremy Gaylard
 reports from Bonn.

 UFO expert wages one-man war
 for access to secret govt files
 By Hal McKenzie
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 NEW YORK - Colman S. Von-
 Keviczky probably knows more
 about UFOs than any private citizen
 in the nation or even the world.
 His collection of some 7,000
 black and white photos of UFOs plus
 2,000 color slides, reams of for-
 merly classified U.S. government
 documents obtained through the
 Freedom of Information Act, stacks
 of UFO magazines and literature
 from around the world, and govern-
 ment documents from other coun-
 tries where he has personal
 contacts in high places, makes his
 UFO archives, neatly crammed into
 his Queens apartment, one of the
 most extensive anywhere.
 Nevertheless, he is fond of say-
 ing without false modesty, "Don't
 ask me, my opinion means nothing.
 Look at what the Pentagon says."
 And he will point to document after
 document that proves the U.S. mili-
 tary, as well as the armed forces of
 the Soviet Union and other coun-
 tries, possess a great deal more
 hard evidence concerning UFOs
 than he or any other individual
 could hope to gather.
 This information includes
 reports of sightings of UFOs by
 military personnel around the
 globe and of incidents where mili-
 tary aircraft or anti-aircraft batter-
 ies fired on UFOs.
 Much of this was just recently
 made known by documents
 released under the Freedom of
 Information Act.
 But VonKeviczky believes the
 government has even more star-
 tling physical evidence of UFOs
 that is still top secret- including as
 many as eight crashed flying sau-
 cers and the bodies of 30 humanoids
 captured or taken from the
 wreckage.
 He arrived at that number from
 published reports obtained alleg-
 edly from servicemen involved in
 the super-secret activity of examin-
 ing the crashed "saucers" or
 transporting the alien corpses.
 Many of these reports are the
 result of research done by Leonard
 H. Stringfield, who once evaluated
 UFO sightings for the U.S. Air
 Force.
 By 1966, VonKeviczky had devel-
 oped enough documentation that he
 decided to make a radical proposal
 to the United Nations, where he was
 employed in the U.N. Secretariat's
 Office of Public Information.
 "I filed a memorandum with Sec-
 retary General U Thant, and in the
 memorandum explained to him
 that, No. 1, the UFO problem is an
 international problem; No. 2, it is
 not a scientific problem, it is an
 international security problem."
 VonKeviczky's memorandum
 proposed the establishment of a
 U.N. authority to coordinate the
 study of UFOs and to attempt to
 make contact with them.
 "On Feb. 9,1966 1 had a personal
 conversation with Secretary Gen-
 eral U Thant and I presented him a
 document that the U.S. and Soviet
 Union are shooting at the UFOs," he
 said.
 For his trouble, VonKeviczky
 was rebuffed and considered a secu-
 rity risk by the federal government.
 Therefore he founded the Intercon-
 tinental UFO Research and Ana-
 lytic Network (ICUFON) to realize
 his goal through other means.
 Finding `common ground'
 VonKeviczky's concern is
 summed up in a recent address he
 gave to a meeting of the Planetary
 Professional Citizens Committee
 (PPCC) headed by Jerome Eden.
 He said the crucial necessity for
 establishing worldwide cooper-
 ation on UFOs is "to find the com-
 mon ground that would preclude a
 fatal Third World War, which could
 easily escalate into a disastrous con-
 frontation with the UFO forces. Is it
 not far better to seek a common
 ground for a means of international
 cooperation on the UFO problem,
 than to dig a common grave for all
 mankind?"
 VonKeviczky hopes that,
 through educating people about
 UFOs, enough public pressure can
 be brought to bear to force the
 "mighty powers" - the United
 States and the Soviet Union - to
 carry out this project.
 Reagan ignores memo
 In addition to the memorandums
 sent to U.N. Secretary Generals U
 Thant and Kurt Waldheim, Von-
 Keviczky recently sent an even
 more extensive work, chock-full of
 all his latest evidence and doc-
 umentation, to President Reagan but without receiving any response.
 The reason for this policy of
 secrecy is "very clearly expressed,"
 he said, in a declassified CIA memo-
 randum dated 1952. The memo says
 "a national policy should be estab-
 lished as to what should be told the
 public regarding the phenomena, in
 order to minimize risk of panic."
 The memo goes on to say that a
 "world-wide reporting system has
 been instituted and major Air Force
 bases have been ordered to make
 interceptions of unidentified flying
 objects"
 Tb "intercept" a flying object in
 military jargon means to shoot it
 down if it refuses to land or be
 escorted out of friendly air space,
 VonKeviczky says.
 Typical of a hard-nosed military
 man and painstaking researcher
 into documented facts and evidence
 of UFOs, he is scornful of the ten-
 dency among some UFO enthusi-
 asts to claim telepathic
 communication with spiritual UFO
 entities.
 "We have to educate in a correct
 and honest way and not to put them
 into the fog of parapsychology,
 ghosts and spirits. UFOs, as you can
 see from the documentation, are
 solid objects. We don't deal with
 ghost kind of objects which are
 invisible."
 VonKeviczky grows more ani-
 mated when he talks about the dan-
 gerous situation the world is in from
 the secrecy and suppression of the
 truth imposed by the rival powers in
 the Cold War.
 "We must force the mighty pow-
 ers to stop the space war and to stop
 the Third World War. When the U.S.
 and Soviet Union, the two military
 and space exploring super powers,
 escalate their unfriendly relations
 to a war, the space people will be
 involved and make a final action -
 and we don't know what the
 aftermath of this action will be."
 The truth suppressed
 However, neither the Pentagon,
 the CIA, nor any other government
 agency here or abroad is revealing
 what they know. Tb VonKeviczky
 and other UFO researchers, this is
 an outrageous denial of citizens'
 right to know the facts concerning

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/16: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100320006-6
 the most important event in human
 history - contact with extraterres-
 trial civilizations.
 Furthermore, VonKeviczky is
 convinced that the number of hos-
 tile actions by earth forces against
 UFOs, following the common cold-
 war military policy of opening fire
 on any suspicious object, risks pro-
 voking a "space war."
 If the nations of the world would
 join together to study and make con-
 tact with UFOs, not only would this
 danger be averted, but the Soviet
 bloc and Western nations could find
 "common ground" to avoid mutual
 annihilation in a Third World War,
 VonKeviczky believes.
 With these considerations in
 mind, it is not surprising that Von-
 Keviczky works with a driving
 intensity to spread his message and
 his knowledge to the world, espe-
 cially to the United Nations and the
 U.S. government. But so far he has
 met with nothing but rebuffs from
 either body.
 Hungarian-born VonKeviczky
 dates his interest in UFOs from 1952
 when he immigrated to the United
 States. That was also the year of the
 great UFO flap in Washington, D.C.,
 in which glowing UFOs were
 sighted over the nation's capital and
 surrounding states both visually
 and by radar, and Air Force jets
 were scrambled to intercept them.
 The flap generated sensational
 headlines and pressures from the
 public for an explanation from the
 government.
 "Regarding this UFO invasion-
 like flap over Washington, D.C., and
 the neighboring states, there were a
 few pictures published," Von-
 Keviczky said in his heavily
 accented English. "As a profes-
 sional movie man and photogra-
 pher, deeply involved and
 experienced in the technology, I saw
 that photos which were published in
 the newspaper were genuine photo-
 graphs, but the government, mainly
 the Pentagon, misinformed the peo-
 ple that they are hoaxes."
 "Parallel with that I got inter-
 ested in various UFO
 organizations," VonKeviczky con-
 tinued. He collected documentation
 for groups in foreign countries,
 especially in Germany where he
 had good connections, and became
 the New York representative of
 Germany's Deutsch UFO'IFO-
 Studiengesellschaft (DUIST),
 founded in 1956 by Karl Veit.
 Hanging on the wall of Von-
 Keviczky's study is a picture of him
 with German rocket scientist Her-
 mann Oberth, DUIST's honorary
 chairman.
 Army background helped
 VonKeviczky's background of 17
 years in the Hungarian army, where
 he achieved the rank of major and
 the position of chief of the Audio-
 Visual Military Education Depart-
 ment of the Royal Hungarian
 General Staff and Ministry of
 Defense (1938-1945), served him in
 good stead as a UFO researcher spe-
 cializing in the military aspects of
 the problem.
 Employing his expertise in pho-
 tographic techniques and
 knowledge of military strategy, tac-
 tics and technology, "I began to
 evaluate and analyze the UFOs'
 operations and activity." Von-
 Keviczky said.

 Salvador chief accuses media
 of sensationalizing violence
 By Robert Morton
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 WASHINGTON - Media
 accounts have sensationalized the
 violence in El Salvador and have
 misled the public as to its causes,
 President Jose Napoleon Duarte
 charged during his recent visit
 here.
 In Washington for a 10-day unof-
 ficial visit, the El Salvador leader
 pledged in a speech at the National
 Press Club to bring democracy to
 his nation, which he said had been
 ruled for too long by violence.
 He also pleaded for the "moral
 support, "comprehension" and the
 prayers of the American people.
 "The United States has been told
 that the guerrillas are so strong that
 there is no solution," Duarte said.
 "I think that you here are
 thinking that if you go to El Salvador,
 that the moment you get off the
 plane you will find guerrillas and
 soldiers shooting at each other. It is
 not true."
 TIry to smear government
 More serious than sensation-
 alized press reports are the deliber-
 ate efforts by leftist guerrillas to
 make their violence appear to be the
 work of El Salvador's security
 forces, Duarte said.
 "We are fighting against terror-
 ist groups who are killing many peo-
 ple and in such a way as to blame the
 security forces;' he said.
 "Why else would they kill some-
 one and put their body in the street
 or cut off their heads and put them
 in the street? It's to attract photog-
 raphers who will send their pic-
 tures all around the world."
 Duarte pledged his "life and his
 honor" to introduce democracy to
 the beleaguered Central American
 nation, which, he emphasized, had
 been governed for too long by vio-
 lent groups on the left and the right
 who had decided that the law
 "applied only to the chicken thieves
 and not to them"
 Since 1977, conflicting forces
 iecided that "violence was the only
 solution." Now, "cultural violence"
 and "social disorder" prevail in El
 Salvador, Duarte said.
 "Then came Cuba, Libya, Viet-
 nam and all those other countries
 ready to give arms to train guerril-
 las," and the violence has acceler-
 ated. Duarte said his own son had
 been wounded by gunfire two weeks
 ago.
 Leftists' disruption typical
 When three leftists disrupted
 Duarte's speech with monotonic,
 chanted accusations, he com-
 mented: "You have an example of
 their methods"
 "I believe in democracy; I
 believe in everyone expressing
 their opinion," Duarte continued.
 "The only solution will come when
 every Salvadoran is free enough to
 make his own decision."
 Free elections will be held "as
 soon as possible;' and the political
 parties involved will decide the con-
 ditions for the election with no gov-
 ernment or military interference,
 he said.
 Asked if the Democratic Rev-
 olutionary Front (FDR) could par-
 ticipate in the elections, Duarte said
 the group could enter the campaign
 only " if they promise not to offer
 violent solutions."
 Duarte told Free Press Interna-
 tional that his private U.S. tour had
 been difficult thus far but that he
 was optimistic that the remainder
 of the trip would be more fruitful.
 He did not elaborate.
 "I came here first of all to ask
 comprehension," he said. In his 20-
 minute visit with President Reagan
 last week, Duarte said he asked for
 nothing and that "Reagan said he
 understood and would support a
 political democratic solution."
 Duarte concluded his remarks
 with an emotional plea for the
 prayersand the understanding of
 the American public.
 "Those who have truth do not
 need violence, and those who per-
 form violence will not find truth," he
 said. "I pledge my life for my peo-
 ple's objective of freedom and jus-
 tice."

 Most S. Koreans feel better
 about I.S. now, poll shows
 By Tim Elder
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 SEOUL - Nearly two-thirds of
 South Koreans feel better about the
 United States than they did one year
 ago, but most are pessimistic about
 the chances of reunifying their
 country within the next decade.
 These and other findings are the
 results of an extensive poll recently
 conducted by one of Seoul's major
 daily newspapers.
 According to the poll published
 last week, 63 percent of those ques-
 tioned reported that their feelings
 toward the United States had
 improved over the past year, while
 almost none said that their feelings
 had worsened.
 Commenting on this finding, Dr.
 Sung-hon Rhee, professor of politi-
 cal science at Kongook University
 in Seoul, said that in the closing
 months of the Carter administra-
 tion most Koreans were deeply con-
 cerned over the tensions that had
 built up between the United States
 and Korea, and were anxious to see
 these relations normalized.
 New appreciation in U.S.
 The general opinion of Koreans
 today, Rhee reported, is that the new
 administration has a greater appre-
 ciation for "the strategic impor-
 tance of the Korean peninsula" and
 for "the need to maintain stability
 within the nation" following the
 assassination of President Park
 Chung-hee in October 1979.
 In other findings, more than 80
 percent of those questioned identi-
 fied themselves as members of the
 middle class, while- only a small
 minority placed themselves in the
 lower class bracket. Further, more
 than three-quarters expressed con-
 fidence that their livelihood will
 improve over the next five years.
 Dr. Yoo Hyuk Kim, a noted spe-
 cialist on social development and a
 professor at Dankook University in
 Seoul, commented that these fig-
 ures, particularly with respect to
 rural areas, demonstrate the suc-
 cess of South Korea's Saemaul (New
 Village) Movement.
 While cautioning that the defini-
 tion of what it means to be middle
 class might differ significantly
 between urban and rural areas, Kim
 reported that the Saemaul Move-
 ment has, by encouraging residents
 of rural villages to work together for
 their common welfare, lifted a vast
 portion of the population above
 what they themselves consider to be
 a lower class existence.
 Pessimism about
 reunification
 The results of the poll show
 Koreans to be generally pessimistic
 on the possibility of reunifying
 their country. More than three-
 quarters were doubtful that reunifi-
 cation could come about within the
 foreseeable future, and a signifi-
 cant number doubted whether it
 could ever be achieved.
 Other findings reflected the
 depth of the influence of Confucian
 morality. Two-thirds said it would be
 improper for an engaged couple to
 kiss before marriage. In fact, a
 quarter of the respondents said that
 such a couple should do no more
 than have conversations while sit-
 ting face to face. Only a very small
 number said they would approve of
 premarital sexual relations.
 Koreans are evenly divided on
 the question of divorce, according
 to the poll. Half said that divorce is
 permissible given a good reason,
 but the poll did not go into what
 these reasons might be. The-
 remaining half either disapproved
 of divorce on any grounds or had
 never even considered the issue.
 The Confucian emphasis on edu-
 cation was also reflected in the find-
 ings. Ninety percent of parents with
 children at home said they would
 want to send their sons to university,
 and nearly three-quarters said they
 would want to send their daughters
 to university.
 On the other hand, very few felt
 that a degree from the right school
 is the major factor in achieving suc-
 cess in society. More than a third
 said that hard work is the major fac-
 tor in success, while slightly less
 said that ability is what it takes to be
 successful.
 Asked to indicate three areas
 which should be of particular con-
 cern for the government, the over-
 whelming majority indicated the
 fight against inflation, slightly less
 than a quarter indicated the
 improvement of social welfare and
 almost the same number indicated
 expansion of educational opportu-
 nities. Only 11 percent felt that
 human rights problems should be
 anarea of particular concern for the
 government.
 This poll was conducted by Joon-
 gang Daily News between July 30
 and Aug. 11. A sample group of 1,232
 was chosen which was representa-
 tive of the general population
 according to age, sex, educational
 background, and urban-rural dis-
 tribution.
 The newspaper had expreienced
 pollsters interview 65.8 percent of
 the sample group and the remain-
 der completed questionnaires;
 1,084 returned responses which
 could be used to tabulate results.

 Soviet occupation of 4 islands
 still strains Moscow-Tokyo ties
 By David Hulme
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 TOKYO - When the Soviet
 Union grabbed four seemingly
 insignificant little islands off the
 coast of Hokkaido at the end of
 World War II, it handed Japan one of
 the extremely rare issues on which
 most Japanese can agree.
 Although the two countries rees-
 tablished diplomatic ties in 1956,
 the Kremlin's refusal to return the
 islands, known as Japan's Northern
 territories, remains a major barrier
 to improvement of an extremely dif-
 ficult relationship.
 The Northern Territories issue
 may have even hastened Japan's
 swing to the right of recent years,
 and the ruling Liberal Democratic
 Party (LDP) has made considerable
 political capital out of it this year.
 A campaign aimed at high-
 lighting the problem began with the
 declaration of Feb. 7 as Northern
 Territories Day. This date marks the
 signing in 1855 of the Japan-Russia
 treaty of Shimoda, which recog-
 nized the disputed islands as Jap-
 anese territory.
 The highlight of the campaign,
 which has been regularly
 denounced by Moscow, came with
 the Sept. 10 visit of Prime Minister
 Zenko Suzuki to Hokkaido, where he
 "observed" the easily visible
 Soviet-occupied islands from a mili-
 tary helicopter flying above the
 Hokkaido coastline. He was the
 first Japanese prime minister to
 visit the area adjacent to the
 islands.
 Such a strong stand has certainly
 annoyed the Soviets. The govern-
 ment would rather avoid this, but
 has been pushed by persistent
 appeals from northern residents for
 a demonstration of concern on'Ibk-
 yo's part, by pressure from the right
 wing of the LDP and by rising pop-
 ular sentiment.
 A week before the Hokkaido
 visit, LDP hardliners felt betrayed
 when the prime minister changed
 his mind at short notice about
 attending a government-sponsored
 rally in'Ibkyo demanding the return
 of the islands.
 Suzuki still ambivalent
 Aboard the prime minister's
 plane on the way to Hokkaido, the
 chairman of the LDP Special Com-
 mittee on the Northern Territories
 Issue, Masaaki Nakayama,
 criticized Suzuki's apparent ambiv-
 alence.
 "If you are going to eat poison,
 you may as well eat the whole plate,"
 he said in an interview.
 Nakayama is one of the many
 Japanese who regard the Soviet
 Union with almost total cynicism
 for unilaterally breaking a non-
 aggression pact and attacking
 Japan when it was on the brink of
 surrender, still reeling from the
 Hiroshima atomic blast three days
 earlier. He does not forget that Sta-
 lin attempted at the time to gain con-
 trol of large chunks of Japan.
 Nakayama also pointed out that
 in 1973, following a Japan-Soviet
 summit meeting in Moscow, a joint
 communique was issued that recog-
 nized the Northern Territories issue
 as one of the "yet unresolved prob-
 lems remaining since World War II"
 Since the improvement of rela-
 tions between Japan and the
 People's Republic of China, Moscow
 has simply pretended to ignore this
 statement and refuses to enter
 negotiations.
 The Japanese side, too, has hard-
 ened its attitude.
 In 1979, the Japanese were
 aghast to discover the Soviet Union
 actually constructing military
 bases on the disputed islands.
 The invasion of Afghanistan pro-
 vided another shock.
 Economic considerations
 At the same time, however, there
 are strong forces pulling the two
 countries together. It is a truism of
 Japanese foreign policy that rela-
 tions with such a large and powerful
 neighbor cannot be allowed to dete-
 riorate too far.
 In theory, the two economies are
 almost perfectly compatible. Japan
 needs access to the abundant raw
 materials of the Soviet eastern
 regions and the Soviet Union needs
 Japanese financing and technology
 to help develop these resources.
 For years the Soviets have been
 pressing the Japanese to get more
 involved in the development of Sibe-
 rian natural gas, oil, timber, mining
 and transportation projects. A few
 projects got under way, but LDP
 encouragement has been minimal.
 Moscow also presses Tokyo for a
 treaty of good neighborliness and
 cooperation and an agreement on
 long-term economic cooperation,
 but the Japanese are extremely
 wary of such proposals and insist
 that the territorial issue must be set-
 tled first.
 Why are the Japanese being so
 stubborn over a mere 5,000 square
 kilometers of not very productive
 land?
 It is true that Japan is rather
 short of space and that Soviet occu-
 pation of the islands has denied Jap-
 anese fishermen access to some of
 the world's richest fishing grounds.
 It is also plausible for campaigners
 to claim they are fighting for "jus-
 tice and international law."
 Continues postwar trauma
 However, according to Hiroshi
 Kimura, professor of political sci-
 ence at the Slavic Research Center
 of Hokkaido University, the deeper
 reason for the surprisingly tough
 Japanese stance is the powerfully
 ingrained concept of "inherent ter-
 ritories."
 For the Japanese, the Soviet
 occupation of the islands repre-
 sents a continuation of the painful
 "postwar era" in which the United
 States occupiedtheir territory.
 Kimura claims the Soviets are
 incapable of fully comprehending
 this island nation's viewpoint.
 "The Soviets and the Japanese
 have fundamentally different atti-
 tudes towards territory," he said in a
 recent interview.
 "Because the Soviet Union has no
 natural boundaries they have no
 concept of inalienable territories,"
 he added.
 Inapaperon the subject, Kimura
 expanded this argument, boiling
 the Kremlin's logic down to a belief
 in the maxim of the German
 geopolitician Haushofer:
 "Boundaries are fighting places

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/16: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100320006-6
 rather than legal norms of deci-
 sion."
 Strategy vs economy
 Kimura also identified military
 strategic considerations as the
 overriding reason why the Kremlin
 could be expected to refuse to
 return the northern islands to
 Japan.
 "The northern islands are sit-
 uated at the very point which con-
 trols passage from the Pacific
 Ocean into the Sea of Okhots-
 k ....There are signs that the
 Brezhnev government has plans to
 construct a huge military-
 industrial complex in the near
 future along the Sea of Okhotsk,
 spanning Siberia, Sakhalin, Kam-
 chatka and the Kurile Islands, and
 that the project is progressing
 steadily.... Above anything else, it
 was with the aim of making the Sea
 of Okhotsk a sanctuary that the
 Soviet Union has deployed ground
 troops on three islands in the
 Northern Territories - Etorofu,
 Kunashiri and Shikotan," he
 explained.
 This analysis explains the Sovi-
 ets' disdain for Japanese demands
 to negotiate the issue, as the Krem-
 lin feels itself within reach of being
 able to thoroughly intimidate Japan
 with an overwhelming military
 presence in the north combined
 with the menace to sea lanes from
 newly acquired naval bases in Viet-
 nam.
 But this is not to say there are no
 alternatives.
 "The Soviets have very serious
 economic problems," said Noboyuki
 Fukuda, president of Tsukuba Uni-
 versity near Tbkyo, who recently
 visited Moscow and Siberia at the
 invitation of the Siberian branch of
 the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
 Fukuda agreed that Moscow,
 faced with ponderous economic
 stagnation in its European regions,
 is attempting to shift the focus of the
 entire Soviet economy eastward.
 This involves a multiplicity of
 political, social and administrative
 as well as technical problems, each
 compounded by the difficulty of
 convincing qualified people to
 endure the utterly daunting bleak-
 ness of long Siberian winters.
 On top of this, Fukuda said, the
 Soviets are "terribly inefficient"
 Because of these problems, he
 said, the Soviets recognize far bet-
 ter results are likely from an infu-
 sion of Japanese high-power
 tecnhology and capitalistic enthusi-
 asm.
 "The only chance the Soviets
 have to save their economy is to syc-
 cessfully develop the eastern
 regions. This is extremely difficult
 to do. It certainly can't be done very
 well without cooperation from
 Japan, or perhaps the United States.
 But the Japanese are not going to
 get involved more until relations
 are better, and that means the
 Northern Territories issue must be
 resolved," Fukuda argued.
 From this point of view, it
 appears almost essential for Mos-
 cow to come to the negotiating table
 with Japan to discuss the disputed
 islands.
 On the other hand, if military
 expansion in the Far East is to con-
 tinue, the Sea of Okhotsk "sanctu-
 ary" is indispensable.
 It boils down to a choice for
 Moscow between outright militar-
 ism and economic recovery. Fukuda
 considered it inevitable that Soviet
 planners are divided on the ques-
 tion, for even militarism requires an
 economic base.
 "They can't have it both ways," he
 concluded.
 Therefore, how the Northern
 Urritories issue is handled by Mos-
 cow may be a clear indicator of the
 Kremlin's priorities in the Far East.

 With eye on North, South Korea
 seeks improved ties with China
 By David Hulme
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 SEOUL- The Republic of Korea
 and the People's Republic of China
 have compelling reasons to improve
 relations, but both find North Korea
 and Thiwan are obstacles.
 For South Korea, rapidly
 emerging as a dynamic element in
 East Asian relations, there are two
 main reasons for wanting to get
 closer to Peking.
 "Fundamentally, we would like to
 reunify our country, and of course
 we have to survive;' said Dr. Kim
 Jun-yop, director of Korea Univer-
 sity's Asiatic Research Center, in an
 interview.
 Seoul's leaders perceive commu-
 nist China's new pragmatism and
 relations with the West as a chance
 to win at least a litle leverage with
 the North Koreans, perhaps even to
 draw them into meaningful negoti-
 ations.
 Korean President Chun Doo-
 hwan's offer to meet his Northern
 counterpart Kim 11-sung at any time
 and in any place without precondi-
 tions has so far met rebuffs, but the
 new South Korean administration
 continues to seek every possible
 way of encouraging the commu-
 nists out of isolation.
 Peking is perhaps the most plau-
 sible intermediary to help ease
 tension on the Korean peninsula.
 The first attempts to approach
 Peking began almost three years
 ago under the leadership of the late
 President Park Chung-hee. Jap-
 anese Foreign Minister Sunao
 Sonoda was asked by the South
 Koreans to indicate their interest in
 better relations to Chinese Senior
 Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping when
 he visited Tbkyo in late 1978, and
 during subsequent contacts.
 "We don't want to have another
 Korean War. In order to achieve this,
 China's influence on North Korea is
 very important;' said Kim.
 Trade relations
 The second reason South Korea
 wants better relations with China is
 related to trade.
 "China is very close to the
 Korean peninsula and has a lot of
 natural resources, such as oil and
 coal. Also we are looking for world
 markets for our products. China is
 so close to the Korean peninsula, so
 it should be very easy to trade with
 mainland China;' Kim explained.
 Some trade through third coun-
 tries, particularly Hong Kong, has
 already begun, with the total esti-
 mated to be approaching $1 billion
 annually. There are also sporadic
 reports of coal ships sailing directly
 between China and South Korea.
 The South Koreans are also hop-
 ing that Peking will follow the lead
 set by Moscow in allowing South
 Korean experts to attend some pro-
 fessional seminars in Moscow, and
 have already quietly hosted Chinese
 representatives in Seoul.
 A lawyer, Yuan Chuan-jing, from
 the Law Institute of the Chinese
 Academy of Social Sciences in
 Peking, traveled from the United
 States last July to attend a scientific
 workshop here.
 The first mainland Chinese to
 visit the southern half of the Korean
 peninsula since 1948, according to
 sources in Seoul, was an official
 from Peking who came secretly last
 year and was shown various indus-
 trial complexes including the
 Pohang integrated steel mill, which
 is a big user of Chinese coal.
 The Taiwan question
 In their rapprochement with
 Peking the Koreans have a similar
 problem to that of the United States
 -uneasiness on the part of Taiwan.
 Kim pointed out that the Taiwan
 question is important to South
 Korea and the Chinese Nationalists'
 enduring deep suspicion of Peking
 made it "difficult to advocate"
 closer ties with the communist
 regime.
 Opposition from Thiwan is a
 minor problem, however, compared
 to the pause North Korea gives to
 Peking in warming to South Korea.
 Peking must move very warily to
 avoid pushing the doctrinaire North
 Koreans completely into the Soviet
 camp.
 Chinese officials privately con-
 cede their North Korean allies are
 rather prickly to deal with. Pyong-
 yang has, despite Kim Il-sung's
 juche (independence) doctrine,
 demonstrated willingness to play
 one side against the other in finding
 a policy line between Peking and
 Moscow, and is even now thought to
 be leaning increasingly towards the
 latter.
 "Once North Korea is totally
 under the influence of the Soviet
 Union then Manchuria would be
 completely surrounded by Russian
 influence;' Kim said, explaining
 Peking's caution.
 The Taiwan question also
 'becomes an obstacle from Peking's
 point of view, for full relations with
 South Korea would mean an official
 "two Koreas" policy, something the
 PRC avoids for fear of legitimizing
 the unacceptable "two Chinas"
 model, Kim pointed out.
 Ironically, perhaps, it is Nation-
 alist Chinese intelligence sources
 that reported recently an unpub-
 lished speech by mainland Chinese
 Foreign Minister Huang Hua, in
 which he described the PRC's rela-
 tions with the ROK as "a door which
 is closed, but not locked."
 Convergence of interests
 Notwithstanding considerable
 barriers, the South Korea-China
 relationship is certainly budding, if
 not blossoming. In the past year, the
 Chinese have shown remarkable
 willingness to have frank discus-
 sions with South Koreans in third
 countries. U.S. analysts note the
 increasing convergence of inter-
 ests between the two countries and
 Washington.
 Peking's official line is still to
 oppose the presence of U.S. troops
 onthe Korean peninsula, but there
 isa lack of enthusiasm for pushing it
 too hard.
 "The Chinese are intelligent
 enough to know what the conse-
 quences of following their advice
 [on the U.S. troop pullout] would be,"
 Ambassador at Large Vernon Wal-
 ters stated here recently.
 The Chinese are also casting
 eagerly about for reliable models
 for development, having shown
 great interest in finding an alterna-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/16: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100320006-6
 tive to the Maoist commune system.
 So far 1 iwan has not responded to
 Peking's overtures, and greater
 interest is now developing in the
 South Korean Saemul (New Village)
 Movement.
 In addition, China needs a
 neighbor capable of supplying
 middle-level development technol-
 ogy. Enormous difficulty has
 accompanied attempts to absorb
 sophisticated Japanese and
 American technologies, whereas
 the South Korean exports could
 prove much more compatible with
 China's present needs.
 The most compelling aspect of
 PRC and ROK common interest,
 however, concerns North Korea.
 Both countries have an interest
 in contributing to the stabilization
 of the Korean peninsula, but as
 things stand only the Chinese can
 communicate very effectively with
 the North Koreans.
 Even when North Koreans vis-
 ited Seoul in 1972, under an
 exchange initiated by the late
 president Park, they were known to
 misreport their observations to
 Kim I1-sung.
 Kim's dictatorial and doctrinaire
 style militates against the possibil-
 ity of him getting "displeasing"
 information from advisers, and ana-
 lysts in Seoul worry deeply that he
 may in fact have a grossly distorted
 image of conditions in the South,
 prompting a miscalculated military
 adventure that would prove very
 costly to both sides.
 If China can make sufficient
 progress in its relations with Seoul,
 the North Koreans may well recog-
 nize at last that the southern part of
 the peninsula has something to offer
 them, too.

 Israelis call on religious institute
 to adapt old laws to modem reality
 By Evans Johnson
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 JERUSALEM - The swing
 toward Orthodox observance that
 marks the administration of Prime
 Minister Menachem Begin has
 focused the spotlight on a little-
 known institute that combines reli-
 gion and science.
 "Our main purpose here is to
 facilitate the interaction and work-
 ing together of rabbis and scien-
 tists," Mrs. Esther Feuchtwanger,
 program director for the Institute
 for Science and Halacha, said in a
 recent interview.
 "Halacha" is the body of reli-
 gious law amassed by learned rab-
 bis down through the centuries that
 basically governs the everyday
 norms and behavior of observant
 Jewish life.
 "Halach is God-given and it has
 to be applicable to every possible
 situation;' Mrs. Feuchtwanger said.
 "Basic laws need to be applied to
 new situations. But now, technical-
 ities have become so involved that a
 rabbi has to find out from an expert.
 A rabbi must know how something
 works to be able to judge whether it
 is halachically sound, and there is
 an old tradition in Judaism of asking
 the expert."
 Asking the experts
 The institute's director, Rabbi
 Shneur Hoffman, and the "new
 things" expert, Rabbi Levi Itzhak
 Halperin, oversee research in two
 basic categories: technical ways of
 getting around halachic
 restrictions in emergencies and
 methods to enable Israeli firms to
 comply with state laws against
 working on the Sabbath.
 One of the most difficult bans
 observant Jews must live with is
 that forbidding the switching one or
 off of electricity on the Sabbath.
 "Making any electrical contact is
 essentially creating fire," Mrs.
 Feuchtwanger said. "The basic idea
 of the Sabbath is not that things not
 get done, but that a person should
 .not create. By not creating, we show
 that we believe that God created the
 world and then rested on that one
 day."
 Halacha recognizes that there
 are certain times when it must be
 violated. "lb save a life, anything
 can, be done on the Sabbath," she
 emphasized. But what, rabbis have
 argued, about a situation where a
 person's life is not in specific dan-
 ger but he may be very ill or in dan-
 ger of losing a limb or an organ?
 As an answer to these questions
 and as an aid to halachic medicine,
 the institute has developed several
 devices that do not technically vio-
 late halacha and can be used in
 emergencies on the Sabbath even
 though they appear forbidden.
 "The Gramma Switch" is the
 institute's most significant inven-
 tion. It is based on the ancient hala-
 chic term "causation," which Mrs.
 Feuchtwanger said means, "You're
 allowed to help in cases of danger by
 causing something to get done, but
 not by doing it yourself."
 "Consider the case of a danger-
 ous fire that breaks out on the Sab-
 bath. It doesn't necessarily threaten
 human life, but it may cause injury
 or financial ruin. You may not put it
 out, but you can ring the fire with
 earthern jugs filled with water.
 When the flames reach them, they
 crack from the heat and the water
 gushes out and douses the fire.
 "We've translated these ideas
 into electronics. We've been able to
 develop certain devices which work
 on the principle of causation."
 The Gramma Switch, at the heart
 of all these electrical systems,
 essentially allows a person to move
 a mechanical plate, thereby block-
 ing the path of an electric eye relay
 system. Technically, he has simply
 and mechanically prevented a cir-
 cuit breaker from functioning.
 Work that isn't work
 Its halachic basis lies in the
 axiom that "stopping something
 from being stopped is considered
 less a fault than doing something
 directly," according to Mrs.
 Feuchtwanger.
 Based on this principle, the insti-
 tute has produced a telephone,
 lighting system, emergency call
 system and water heaters that can
 be used on the Sabbath.
 Tb a non-Jew and even to many
 secular Jews, the whole idea may
 seem like splitting hairs, but to an
 observant Jew the Sabbath is every-
 thing. In fact, according to
 Orthodox belief, if all Jews refrain
 from violating two consecutive Sab-
 baths, the Messiah must come.
 "The people who ask us ques-
 tions are religious," Hoffman
 stressed. "Therefore, our answers,
 our inventions, are important to
 them. We can explain why our sys-
 tems are acceptable by using both
 halacha and physics."
 The Gramma Switch principle
 arose from the institute's
 involvement in planning Jerusa-
 lem's ultra-modern and Orthodox
 Sha'are Zekek Hospital. "Nothing
 was built without our checking it
 first," Mrs. Feuchtwanger said.
 The hospital board wanted their
 institution to conform as closely as
 possible to halacha. One main con-
 cern was for patients who would not
 switch on the nurses' call light on
 the Sabbath.
 If a physician told his patient he
 was dying, it would, of course, be all
 right for him to press the button if he
 needed help. However, the doctors
 could not tell their patients that
 because that would increase their
 danger if they lost their will to live.
 With a Gramma Switch installed
 near each bed, a patient can sum-
 mon a nurse in an emergency with-
 out violating the Sabbath.
 Beyond enabling institutions to
 operate in accordance with halacha,
 the institute is also a consultant to
 the government on the subject of
 labor on the Sabbath.
 Under Israeli law, labor on the
 Sabbath is proscribed except in cir-
 cumstances when not to work would
 bring the "danger of large eco-
 nomic loss to the country or an
 industry," institute engineer
 Charles Marcus said.
 "Permits are necessary to work
 on the Sabbath," his assistant, Mrs.
 Hasida Lerer, explained. "A firm
 approaches the Ministry of Labor
 for them, and the ministry may
 come to the institute for a solution.
 We work with the plant engineers to
 suit solutions to the plant in each
 case"
 Solutions for industry
 Institute engineers point out to
 industry planners and engineers
 different processes and procedures
 that could enable a firm to close for

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/16: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100320006-6
 the Sabbath from Friday dusk to
 Saturday evening.
 In many industries, Saturdays
 are set aside for maintenance. "One
 solution is to train the maintenance
 men in modern methods that avoid
 Sabbath work," Marcus explained.
 "We encourage and participate in
 courses that teach how to combine
 regular industrial production and
 maintenance, or how to schedule the
 work for Friday afternoons before
 sunset or Saturday nights before
 the crews report for work on Sunday
 morning."
 The institute also brings to Israel
 news of the latest advances in auto-
 mation in more developed nations.
 This, however, can pose a problem.
 "It could develop that if people
 are not needed on the Sabbath, then
 perhaps they're not needed on other
 days as well," Marcus said. "In that
 case, a worker would oppose auto-
 mation" and, by inference, become
 more attached to Sabbath work.
 "You have to be terribly careful
 how you give advice," Mrs. Lerer
 cautioned, "so as not to, God forbid,
 insult a firm's engineer. However,
 halachic improvements have also
 enabled industries to better their
 general functioning as a by-
 product.
 "There is a trend today towards
 the five-day work week in Israel and
 for more time off and better social
 benefits;" she said. "With these ten-
 dencies spreading, firms need to
 think ahead towards changing over
 their systems and they can do it
 according to halacha."
 Although many small firms have
 been able to alter their operations to
 fit the Sabbath, "The toughest prob-
 lem is industries where processes
 have to go on'round the clock," Mar-
 cus explained.
 "A cement kiln, for example,
 cannot be stopped except perhaps
 once a year for general mainten-
 ance. It works 24 hours a day, seven
 days a week, for up to three years
 without interruption" If the kiln
 were shut down over the Sabbath, it
 might crack from the strain of
 cooling and reheating so often.
 What holds for cement man-
 ufacturers also goes for Israel's
 mainstay, the phosphate industry,
 and for ceramic and chemical
 firms. But institute engineers are
 optimistic about automation
 breakthroughs and new kiln sys-
 tems now appearing in Europe.
 "Automation provides a steady
 heat balance in the oven, which
 improves the product and cuts
 energy consumption," Marcus said.
 However, given Israel's stormy
 labor relations and the increasing
 tensions between observant and
 secular Jews, it may take some time
 before the institute or the Ministry
 of Labor can convince one of the
 industrial giants to change over
 from labor-intensive to automated
 and halachically allowed produc-
 tion processes.
 One area in which automation is
 already dominant and in which the
 few people employed on the Sabbath
 are not a problem is the generation
 of electricity.
 Without electricity, how could
 hospitals function, how could an
 iron lung operate, how could a swel-
 tering heart attack victim be
 refreshed by an air conditioner?
 "Electricity production is essen-
 tial because it is necessary for the
 preservation of human life," Mar-
 cus stressed.

 W. German split on arms
 threatens ruling coalition
 By Jeremy Gaylard
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 BONN - As Oct. 10 draws near,
 West Germans are beginning to pre-
 pare for the inevitable injured
 policemen and property damage
 that accompany demonstrations of
 the so-called "peace movement"
 A massive rally has been orga-
 nized by a loose coalition of Marxist
 groups, environmentalists and
 church activists, with 100,000 peo-
 ple expected to march to Bonn's
 market square to protest nuclear
 armaments.
 Incomprehensible in the light of
 previous experience is the decision
 by three West German states to give
 schoolchildren the day off to attend
 the rally.
 A demonstration in West Berlin
 during the recent visit of Secretary
 of State Alexander Haig resulted in
 128 policemen wounded, 10 of them
 seriously, and a rally to support
 squatters in that city last week
 accounted for the death of a young,
 masked protester.
 Placating the left
 West German observers see the
 willingness of the ruling Social
 Democratic Party (SPD) to accom-
 modate the "peace movement" as an
 attempt to placate the left wing of
 their own party, which is against
 nuclear modernization.
 Members of the "peace move-
 ment" were invited for a public
 debate with the SPD at party head-
 quarters in Bonn last month, most of
 which was televised nationally, and
 SPD spokesman Egon Bahr was
 unable to defend his party's position
 on nuclear arms convincingly.
 Headed by party chairman Willy
 Brandt, the pacifist wing of the SPD
 has become vocal against the NATO
 (North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
 tion) decision of December 1979 to
 deploy U.S. nuclear weapons in
 Western Europe by 1983 failing suc-
 cessful arms reductions talks with
 the Soviets.
 Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has
 staked his political future on the
 NATO decision, and the outcome of
 the U.S.-Soviet arms talks, planned
 for late November in Geneva, may
 determine whether he remains to
 complete his term of office.
 Meanwhile Brandt, who has
 made a political comeback as head
 of the Socialist International, is
 challenging Schmidt's commitment
 to the NATO decision and contesting
 West Germany's position within the
 Atlantic alliance.
 The release and pardon of Guen-
 ther Guillaume, the East German
 spy whose discovery in high office
 led to Brandt's resignation as chan-
 cellor in 1974, in a sense exonerates
 Brandt and elevates him within the
 SPD.
 A party conference in April may
 determine whether Schmidt
 remains in favor or whether the
 majority of the SPD prefers
 Brandt's brand of neutralism,
 aimed at reconciliation with East
 Germany at the expense of
 American friendship and protec-
 tion.
 A wave of anti-Americanism,
 accentuated by terrorist attacks on
 U.S. Army installations and persoQ-
 nel in recent weeks, has been
 blamed by opposition politicians on
 the anti-NATO sentiments
 expressed by SPD politicians such
 as Brandt and Bahr.
 Coalition's collapse seen
 Some local observers see the
 possibility of a collapse of the ruling
 coalition of the SPD and FDP (Free
 Democratic Party) as a result of
 SPD disunity, and a coalition
 between the FDP and the opposition
 Christian Democrats (CDU) taking
 over the reins of government.
 State elections in the state of
 Lower Saxony this week gave the
 conservative CDU an absolute
 majority of 50.2 percent against
 36.9 percent for the SPD, and in
 West Berlin the SPD was ousted by
 the CDU in May after ruling the city
 for 26 years.
 A government headed by the
 CDU would clamp down on the
 efforts of the neutralists to drive a
 wedge between Western Europe and
 the United States and stifle the
 "peace movement," which repre-
 sents a small minority of the pop-
 ulation.
 However, the CDU would be
 inheriting a government plagued
 with a massive public debt and con-
 tradictory foreign policy, and
 unless they could pull things
 together quickly they could soon
 lose out to the SPD under extreme
 left-wing control.

 The super-crime of the century
 After a 35-year silence, Lev Navrozov confesses to the super-crime of the cen-

 to vote against the universe, God, nature, the past, present and future. Not to

 How I committed the super-crime
 of the century in Stalinist Russia
 LEV
 NAVROZOV
 There I was, 18 years old and
 voting for the first time, and as it
 happened, for Stalin. It was 1946,
 Moscow.
 Last year I voted in the United
 States.
 My first impression of the two
 events is quite similar - men and
 women sit at a desk and check your
 name. There is one difference,
 though. In the United States, you go
 inside a booth and vote, secretly.
 In Stalin's Russia, there was a
 similar "booth for secret voting,"
 but the question is, why go inside at
 all? From one of those men and
 women at a desk you received your
 voting paper, which displayed the
 name of Stalin. Then you could go
 into a booth, strike out the name of
 Stalin in total secrecy and write in
 the name of your candidate, also in
 total secrecy.
 But surely you did not want to
 strike out the name of Stalin, so you
 did not go inside the booth, but
 walked to a ballot box in general
 view and dropped your voting paper
 into it.
 Those who beamed
 Only one kind of people would go
 into a booth. They took their voting
 papers and beamed. Then they
 would ask, beaming, "May I go into a
 booth?"
 "Of course," a man or a woman at
 the desk would answer, smiling. And
 the beaming voters would go in and
 soon emerge, beaming.
 Everybody knew: They were the
 kind of people who could not just
 drop in their voting papers - they
 had to write something on them in
 addition like, "Long live our beloved
 leader, teacher and friend Stalin!"
 Or, "Thank you, Comrade Stalin, for
 our happy life!"
 Except for the beaming kind, no
 one went into a booth, and if you had
 done so without this obvious beam-
 ing purpose, you could have been
 followed by plainclothesmen to your
 home.
 Having been thus identified, you
 could have further risked having
 your fingerprints compared with
 those left on a voting paper where
 the name of Stalin was struck out in
 total secrecy. Thus, it would be
 established that you voted against
 Stalin.
 Tb vote against Stalin was to vote
 against the universe, God, nature,
 man, the past, present and future. It
 was not a crime. It was the super-
 crime of the century, something
 unspeakable, and indeed impossi-
 ble, like blowing up the Earth along
 with all mankind.
 The secret police would never
 believe that any Soviet inhabitant
 could do it on his own, so they would
 have investigated you until you con-
 fessed that you were a Gestapo-
 trained master agent of a vast
 powerful CIA-based organization
 (say, the All-Russian Union of
 Struggle for the Liberation of Rus-
 sia, or ARUSLR). Then you would
 have been duly shot, though by that
 time you would be in such a state
 that it would probably be a relief.
 But could I abstain from voting
 and stay home? Absurd. Insane.
 Mortally dangerous. Not to wish to
 vote for Stalin? So I had to. And since
 I had to, I decided to vote - against
 Stalin.
 Super-crime of the century
 So here I am, 18, and I am plan-
 ning the super-crime of the century.
 Tb read Pravda, all mankind con-
 siders Stalin the greatest man that
 ever lived or will live. Why, even Sir
 Winston Churchill, the inveterate
 enemy of the Soviet regime who
 wanted to destroy it by war way
 back in 1918, paid glowing tribute to
 Stalin's greatness.
 This may be, but then I disagree
 with all mankind, including Sir Win-
 ston.
 I cannot vote for Stalin, even
 though everyone knows that this
 voting is an inane empty convention
 to which no one, except those beam-
 ing fools, pays any attention and
 which makes no difference whatso-
 ever, for Stalin would not budge an
 inch from his absolute power even if
 100 percent of the population struck
 out his name and inscribed someone
 else's.
 I put on gloves (no fingerprints,
 please), cut a card out of thick, stiff
 paper about half the size of the
 voting paper, and wrote on it in bldck
 letters: "I hereby vote against Stalin
 and his network of thugs, gangsters
 and murderers enmeshing my
 country." I added several more sen-
 tences in the same spirit, but I do not
 remember them word for word.
 Ironically, this was not my style.
 I loved Russian and French poetry, I
 wanted to be a painter, and I
 despised "politics" and "political
 language" of any kind. But I signed:
 "All-Russian Union of Struggle for
 the Liberation of Russia. Moscow
 Section."
 The last addition was to create
 the impression that this vast power-
 ful organization had spread far and
 wide, almost ready to overthrow
 Stalin's regime, and I voted on
 behalf of its Moscow section.
 This wasalso uncharacteristic of
 me. I did not see anything odd about
 my apparently being in the minority
 of one against all mankind, includ-
 ing Winston Churchill. I was a loner,
 spiritually. But since I had stepped
 onto a political path, I felt that an
 organization was needed, if only on
 paper.
 I left a glove on my left hand and
 put the card (and my left hand) into
 the left pocket of my coat. I was
 ready to commit the super-crime of
 the century - and try to escape
 scot-free!
 Scene of the super-crime
 Here is another difference
 between voting in Moscow and in
 New York. When my wife and I went
 to vote last year in New York, we
 couldn't find the polling place very
 easily until we stumbled on a
 building that looked like an aban-
 doned high school.
 In contrast, our polling station in
 Moscow was located in the mansion
 of Prince Yusupoff, with beautiful
 18th-century French tapestries on
 the walls and cast-iron fireplaces.
 The loudspeakers outside blared
 forth music for the entire election
 district to hear, voters strolled
 toward and around the building as
 on a promenade, and the building
 itself was decorated like a
 Christmas tree. What a lark to vote
 for Stalin.
 With my gloved left hand in my

 Keep it home, if you please
 That fuss stirred up the past week
 by Whitey Herzog's picking up a
 few extra bucks plugging Toyota
 cars ignored the broader aspects of
 the problem. The editorial arm of
 the United Auto Workers deplored
 Whitey's taking the bread out of the
 mouths of the American workers
 by urging them to buy the imports;
 nowhere did it examine the issue of
 WHY the public preferred the items
 from far-off places, tariff and all,
 against the home-made product.
 Maybe the story about an empty
 Coke can being found inside the door
 panel of one of the Detroit jobs got
 around to a lot of places, true or
 false.
 Misguided or not, Whitey shouldn't
 have done it in uniform. His boss,
 (he's G.M. of the Cards as well as
 field manager, but even G.M.'s have
 bosses) told him so publicly. So the
 next time we see Whitey's honest
 features suggesting we do some-
 thing that we will profit from, finan-
 cially, socially or spiritually, he'll
 be wearing a neat business suit.
 Double-breasted. Herzog's been
 sporting a major-league baywindow
 for several seasons, as befits a fellow
 given to spurts of nervous eating.
 When Whitey was a chubby tod-
 dler there was an "in-uniform" inci-
 dent in sports-a different one from
 baseball-that provided prose-
 makers and after-dinner speakers
 with a line they long cherished. It
 concerned Joe Gould, a New York
 character who managed fighters for
 a living. In the depths of the Depres-
 sion he had picked up an honest
 Irishman who could take a punch.
 He worked sporadically as a long-
 shoreman on the Jersey docks over
 in Hoboken. The $50 or $100 he
 picked up for an evening's fistic
 work frequently was all that came
 between his sizeable family and
 brutal starvation. Social programs
 were a little up the road.
 James J. Braddock and Joe Gould
 made a perfect team, and one day
 there was Braddock in a position to
 challenge for the world heavyweight
 title held by Max Baer. He was a
 10-1 underdog, Braddock was, and
 of course he out-gamed the awe-
 some-physiqued Baer in 15 rounds.
 So for trivia devotees it was
 Braddock who was the champ who
 came between Baer and Joe Louis.
 Later Louis flattened Braddock and
 when the war came Braddock and
 Gould had pretty much passed from
 the picture.
 Braddock was passed over in the
 draft because of his considerable
 family, and so there was the odd
 picture of a fighter being deferred
 and his manager taken. Well, hardly
 "taken." Joe Gould went in as a cap-
 tain in the Quartermaster Corps and
 had his pals assign him to the
 Brooklyn Port of Embarkation. In
 those days it was a five-dollar cab
 ride from the center of Manhattan.
 The war eventually ended but
 before it did it gave the boxing fra-
 ternity a choice item to discuss for
 a long time. There was a group
 stealing from Army shipments by
 the freight-car load. Among those
 grabbed and tossed into the can
 without too much discussion was Joe
 Gould, former manager of a world
 heavyweight champion.
 Boxing has always put up with a
 lot of aberrant conduct but in
 Gould's case he was castigated by
 virtually every member of the fistic
 community."He should'na done it in
 uniform," was the universal
 assessment.
 Have you seen Uncle Harry?
 Any mention of three-times
 Stanford all-American, Bobby
 Grayson, must inevitably be
 followed by a reference to his uncle,
 Harry. That salty ex-Marine, Harry
 Grayson, moved along to the sports-
 writers' Valhalla a decade ago.
 Bobby Grayson, a tremendous
 player in the '30s when fullbacks
 rarely topped 200, and routinely
 played 60 minutes, died of a heart
 ailment in the state of Washington,
 his native area, last week.
 He had come down from Oregon
 at the start of the '30s to play on
 three successive Rose Bowl teams
 at Stanford, a record. The Indians
 almost set another record of another
 dimension; they lost two of three.
 Harry Grayson was sports editor
 of NEA (Newspaper Enterprise
 Association, an adjunct of the
 Scripps-Howard chain,) and was
 known for his ability to break up a
 press conference, important or triv-
 ial, in record time. He could clear a
 room in the middle of something
 like an earth-shaking announcement
 that Louis would be fighting a second
 bout with Schmeling by interjecting,
 "Lemme tell yuh somethin' " He had
 a drill-sergeant's voice. Insults
 merely bounced off his fine head of
 wavy hair like spaldeens.
 When Bobby Grayson decided to
 go to Stanford (every college in the
 country was after him) Harry
 immediately became his nephew's
 one-man publicity organization. And
 he had plenty to talk about. Grayson
 was right up there with a lot of
 Stanford All-Americas like Monk
 Moscrip, Bob Reynolds (who late
 co-owned the Angels with Gene
 Autry), and Bones Hamilton. You
 had to admit these were names that
 could roll off a tongue easily. Espe-
 cially Harry's.
 Stanford lost to Columbia in what
 was probably the biggest Rose Bowl
 upset ever (The Light Blue was the
 last Ivy League rep in what was then
 the biggest post-season football
 attraction in the country).
 Then they lost to Alabama, where
 Frank Thomas (yes, there have been
 'Bama coaches other than Bear
 Bryant) had such performers as Don
 Hutson, one of the greatest ends in
 history; Bill Lee and Millard (Dixie)
 Howell. Fellow by the name of Bear
 Bryant played the other end. He was
 working his way through college and
 wooing the governor's daughter. He
 accomplished both.
 In Grayson's last Rose Bowl
 appearance Stanford beat Southern
 Methodist, 7-0. That was the end for
 Grayson. He never played pro, not
 for a salary like $5,000 for the sea-
 son. He was an academic all-
 America as well as a fine football
 player and there were things to be
 done as the country was pulling out
 of the Great Depression.
 About Uncle Harry. They told a
 million stories about him and his
 attitude toward life (Jimmy Breslin
 was once his office boy and may
 have picked up a few pointers.) One
 of the best was when he was sen-
 tenced to working in Cleveland,
 NEA's home office.
 Harry was a big-city guy and
 didn't care for any part of Cleveland,
 including the raging snowstorms
 that blew in from Lake Erie in mid-
 January.
 He was struggling up Euclid Ave-
 nue, which at the moment resem-
 bles the main drag in Irkutsk. A lone
 motorist pulled up alongside,
 lowered his snow-encrusted window,
 and called, "How do I get out of
 town?" He was lost.
 Harry wasn't of much help. "How
 the hell do I know?" he snarled
 through lips blue with the cold. "If I
 knew, do you think I'd be doing this?"

 Fidel's friends on Capitol Hid
 Foreign Policy
 Report
 By Ted Agres
 FREE PRESS INTERNATIONAL
 WASHINGTON - "Fidel Castro
 saw me, ran over and shook my
 hand. He said, 'You must be George
 Crockett. My friend Ron Dellums
 said you'd be coming...' "
 Thus did Rep. George Crockett
 Jr., D-Mich., a newcomer to the Con-
 gress, recount the marvelous time
 he had in Havana, hobnobbing with
 the exalted leader of the "non-
 aligned" nations and puppet of the
 Soviet Union, Fidel Castro.
 Crockett was one of seven con-
 gressmen who last week also par-
 ticipated in a controversial
 symposium on Capitol Hill titled
 "The U.S. and Cuba: Prospects for
 the '80s." But if the conference can
 be any judge, prospects for
 sympathyfrom the Reagan admin-
 istration appear slight indeed.
 The State Department, just days
 before the event, cancelled visas for
 officials from Cuba to attend the
 seminar. Cuba's enthusiastic sup-
 port for Marxist insurrection and
 guerrilla armies in Central Amer-
 ica and elsewhere were officially
 cited as reasons. But Castro's bel-
 licose denouncement of the United
 States during an international gath-
 ering in Havana the previous week
 was the real straw that broke the
 camel's back.
 In any event, Castro's good
 friends in Congress weren't
 deterred by any of this. Crockett
 had gone to Havana just a week
 before, along with Rep. Theodore
 Weiss, D-N.Y., and a few other legis-
 lators, to attend a meeting of the
 Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
 It was at this meeting that Castro
 erupted into choice rhetoric. U.S.
 lawmakers came back and dutifully
 reported on their experiences for
 the congressional Cuba conference.
 Audience of aged Marxists
 The mostly appreciative audi-
 ence was comprised mainly of aged
 Marxists, who seemingly had
 embraced communism in the 1930s
 when it was still considered chic
 and who have since not let reality
 interfere with their concepts. Also
 to be seen were a few trendy lefties
 of the Institute for Policy Studies
 (IPS) mold and an assortment of
 reporters and curiosity seekers.
 Crockett told the audience at the
 outset of the symposium that
 "[Rep.] Mickey Leland is very well
 known in Cuba. He is a good friend
 of Castro.... He is almost our unoffi-
 cial ambassador to Cuba. He said,
 'I'll let my good friend Fidel know
 you're coming down,' " Crockett
 said.
 "Ron Dellums also said, 'I'll let
 my friend Fidel know you're coming
 down, " Crockett told the pleased
 audience.
 The combined notifications
 apparently had the desired effect,
 for Crockett was dutifully
 impressed by the treatment he
 received in Havana.
 Leland, D-Texas, assured the
 audience that the Reagan adminis-
 tration is embarked on "a danger-
 ously misguided policy ... Cuba is
 high on our international hit list." He
 warned that war is inevitable unless
 the United States halts its "militar-
 ism and confrontation" and bows to
 Cuba's desires.
 Crockett added that he thought
 "the State Department and the gov-
 ernment is characterized by racis-
 m ...[and] to me, fascism is another
 way of saying'racist' "
 Castro, in his tirade at the IPU
 conference, called the United States
 "fascist; "`genocidal" and "covered
 with blood'' Crockett, seemingly
 puzzled, lamented that the rest of
 the U.S. delegation in Havana had
 declined to discuss these sensitive
 issues with the Cuban dictator.
 The congressional symposium
 was sponsored by the Center for
 Cuban Studies, a non-profit organi-
 zation based in New York whose
 members are largely pro-Castro
 Marxists. The center, according to
 one participant, had contacted
 Johns Hopkins University and
 American University to co-sponsor
 the symposium and to send the intel-
 lectuals. They complied.
 Dr. Riordan Roett, professor and
 director of Latin American Studies,
 Johns Hopkins School forAdvanced
 International Studies, was the
 chairman for the event. "We want
 different positions expressed;" he
 said.
 "This is not an anti-Reagan rally,
 and we will not endorse any particu-
 lar point of view," Roett stated with
 apparent naivete.
 A look at some of the people orga-
 nizing the conference would have
 illustrated the inherent bias toward
 Cuba and away from the Reagan
 administration. In addition to the
 congressmen mentioned pre-
 viously, other far left sponsors
 included: Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-
 Calif.; William Gray, D-Pa.; Stephen
 Solarz, D-N.Y.; District of Columbia
 delegate Walter Fauntroy; and Sen.
 Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.
 Research for the economic anal-
 yses of U.S.-Cuba relations was
 attributed to David Williams, a
 staffer at the pro-Marxist Council
 on Hemispheric Affairs.
 The Cubans who were denied
 visas instead sent videotapes of
 themselves, which were displayed
 on a wide-screen video player.
 These included Alberto Betancourt
 Roa, of Cuba's Ministry of Foreign
 Trade, and Marcello Fernandez
 Font, chief adviser to the Cuban
 Central Planning Board. The head
 of Cuba's interests section in Wash-
 ington, Ramon Sanchez Parodi,
 appeared in person and was warmly
 welcomed.
 Other participants included:
 Victor Rabinowitz; George Pills-
 bury, state senator from Minnesota
 and director of the Pillsbury Co.;
 Irving Louis Horowitz, of Rutgers
 University; and Robert Pastor, the
 radical IPS-linked fellow who
 served on Jimmy Carter's National
 Security Council.
 A buffet lunch for the sympo-
 sium participants was held at the
 home of Stewart Mott, millionaire
 sugardaddy of leftist and radical
 causes and an heir to the General
 Motors fortune.

 New YorTimes vs. Haig:
 New turning truth upside down
 The New York Times' front-page
 headline read "Haig Rebuffs Poor
 Nations' Program for More Aid."
 The main element in Bernard
 Nossiter's piece on Secretary of
 State Alexander Haig's speech at
 the U.N. General Assembly was
 negativity. Haig was depicted as
 cruelly turning down poor nations'
 requests for more aid, asking Third
 World countries to instead "rely for
 development on free markets, pri-
 vate initiative and foreign capital."
 The wording implies that Haig is
 kicking mendicant nations away
 from the West's door and requiring
 them to fall back on their own
 resources with no help from the
 West.
 The actual thrust of Haig's
 speech was far from being cruel or
 negative toward Third World needs.
 Haig, in fact, called for a new era of
 world economic growth based on
 open trade, increased cooperation
 in food and energy production and
 an emphasis on private enterprise.
 Key point missed
 Nossiter totally ignored Haig's
 key point - that the world faces a
 "crucial choice" between growth
 and development through
 increasing international com-
 merce, or stagnation and decline
 due to government protectionism,
 socialism and political instability
 spread by Soviet-backed commu-
 nist subversion.
 Nor did he mention Haig's refer-
 ence to the World Bank's ominious
 prediction that "the difference
 between the two cases [free trade
 and protectionism] amounts to
 some 220 million more absolutely
 poor people" But,of course, Nos-
 siter doesn't want to show Haig as
 trying to solve poverty, but as turn-
 ing his back on it.
 What many of these nations are
 asking for is a socialistic "new eco-
 nomic order" consisting of "a large
 increase in resources flowing from
 rich nations to poor," as Nossiter
 said. However, the universal exper-
 ience of this planet - not only of the
 United States - is that income dis-
 tribution schemes, taking from the
 rich to give to the poor, simply do not
 work.
 Such schemes manage to stifle
 initiative, destroy incentives,
 strangle business in government
 red tape and, in general, lead to a
 shrinking economic pie with less for
 all.
 It was a Chinese sage who said
 some thousands of years ago that "If
 you give a man a fish, he will be fed
 for one day. Teach a man to fish, and
 he will be fed for the rest of his life"
 That is what Haig wants to do for
 the Third World - give them the
 opportunity and know-how to
 acquire the prosperity that has
 evolved in the industrialized
 nations instead of being permanent
 charity cases.
 Haig did not, therefore, "rebuff"
 anybody. The poor nations want to
 get out of their poverty situation, as
 of course they should. Here is how
 they can do it, Haig said. The fact
 that his plan differs from the "new
 economic order" being pushed by
 many Third World nations - most
 of whom are allied with the Soviet
 bloc- is not by any means a refusal
 to recognize their real needs.
 Nossiter employed the usual
 dodge of reporters trying to get
 their own preconceived ideas
 across - quoting anonymous
 sources to depict Third World del-
 egates as deeply pained by Haig's
 speech. He quoted "several Third
 World delegates, who declined to be
 named:' as being "distressed by
 what they saw as a rejection of their
 proposal for what they call a new
 international economic order."
 Unwilling to name sources
 Frankly, there is something
 shady about diplomats, whose job is
 to be spokesmen for their countries
 in a public forum, being so shy to be
 identified with a certain position. If
 these anonymous delegates' point
 of view is as widespread in the
 United Nations as Nossiter would
 have us believe, then why are they so
 ashamed of being publicly associ-
 ated with it? If there are so many
 Third World delegates at the United
 Nations who are opposed to Haig's
 position, couldn't Nossiter have
 found any that were willing to be
 named?
 Reading between the lines, it is
 obvious why Nossiter would not
 identify his sources. They probably
 came from Marxist or socialistic
 regimes which are so tied to the
 Soviet bloc that their opinions
 would be totally discredited by the
 readers if they knew where they
 were coming from.
 The last thing Nossiter wants to
 do is clearly identify opinions that
 conform with his own as originating
 from communist sources; it might
 blow his reportorial cover and
 reveal him as an apologist for leftist
 causes.
 While dwelling at great length on
 Haig's "rebuff" to the Third World,
 Nossiter devotes one paragraph to
 the positive aspects of Haig's
 speech, just to show that he is being
 "objective" The effect of this is, of
 course, to make Haig look even
 more niggardly.
 He writes that "Mr. Haig did
 make what appeared to be one
 important gesture toward the Third
 World. The very poorest nations like
 Mali and Bangladesh do 'require
 long-term and generous conces-
 sional aid,' he said. But he added that
 help should come from developing
 as well as industrialized nations."
 A humane appeal
 In fact, Haig's entire speech was
 an "important gesture" towards the
 Third World. Haig was making an
 eminently practical, rational and
 humane appeal for an end to the bar-
 riers - many of them self-imposed
 - that have kept the developing
 world in poverty. Haig was also call-
 ing for a "new world economic
 order"- one which would multiply
 prosperity instead of sharing scar-
 city, as is the rule in socialist
 regimes.
 Is it any wonder that more and
 more conservatives are calling for
 "an alternative to The New York
 Times"? A publication that sup-
 presses so much of the truth in its
 reporting does not deserve the pres-
 tige and the influence that the
 Times enjoys.

 `U.S. Foreign Policy in the '80s'.
 a realistic view of global affairs
 MATTHEW
 CONROY
 THE
 PEPPER
 MILL
 Although Washington is a one-
 industry city of politics, another
 major activity other than govern-
 ment business is the holding of con-
 ferences every day, seven days a
 week. Confronted with more confer-
 ences than can possibly be attended,
 the working journalist must choose
 carefully and wisely in allocating
 his time.
 One of the more interesting Wash-
 ington conferences took place a few
 weeks ago. The theme was "U.S. For-
 eign Policy in the '80s," and the
 sponsor was the Professors World
 Peace Academy, a division of the
 International Cultural Foundation,
 Inc.
 Tbo often, conferences involving
 academics lean toward the unreal-
 istic. College professors tend to see
 the world not as it is but as they
 would like it to be. Probably the most
 outstanding example of this kind of
 myopia was provided by Henry
 Kissinger during his years of gov-
 ernment service, when he applied
 unworkable academic views to the
 real world. Happily, most of the dais
 speakers in the PWPA conference
 were realists.
 Perceptive comments
 The major address at the PWPA
 conference was delivered by the
 conference chairman, Professor
 Morton A. Kaplan of the University
 of Chicago. Dr. Kaplan paid the usual
 lip service to the need for "reason-
 able agreements" with the Soviets
 and Chinese, but was realistic enough
 to call for maintenance of U.S. mili-
 tary strength at a high enough level
 to ensure our power credibility.
 A few more comments by Dr.
 Kaplan called for greater support
 for the Afghan people battling their
 Soviet invaders, a stronger West
 European defense force to deter a
 Soviet attack, and an admirably real-
 istic approach to Cuba. I quote from
 Dr. Kaplan's report:
 "We should have gone into an air
 and naval blockade of Cuba imme-
 diately after the Russians moved in
 force into Afghanistan. Although it
 would be a mistake to attempt to
 bring the [Cuban] regime down
 directly with American force, its
 activities may in the future provide
 us with a reason for isolating it.
 .,It is a vicious, terroristic regime
 which never would have come into
 power except upon an American
 decision to allow it to happen in the
 expectation that constitutional and
 democratic government would be
 restored.... There is no American
 incentive to come to terms with a
 Cuba that is repressive, terroristic,
 and our enemy."
 Dr. Kaplan's comments on the
 problems of the developing world
 also reflect a gratifying realism.
 "Development is not primarily a
 matter of external assistance," he
 writes. "Investment certainly is
 necessary, but South Korea, Thiwan,
 Hong Kong, and.Singapore give
 ample proof that capital funds are
 available if they can be employed
 profitably....
 "These countries have found the
 route to national independence, or
 at least to as much of it as is pos-
 sible for a small nation in the modern
 world. And this will permit the res-
 toration of national pride... .Good
 government, sound economic poli-
 cies, good education systems, rela-
 tively honest and efficient local
 entrepreneurs, and achievement
 orientations are required."
 Dr. Kaplan was rebutting the
 "myths" of the Brandt report and
 the policies of Robert McNamara
 as head of the World Bank that called
 for ever-increasing aid to the devel-
 oping countries. If we subscribe to
 that approach, he said, "we will
 finance local elites at the expense
 of their nations, proliferate the
 number of large hidden Swiss bank
 accounts, destroy capital, and pro-
 duce explosive frustrated expecta-
 tions"
 More clandestine work
 The major topics chosen for dis-
 cussion by the PWPA conference
 related to Central America, the
 Middle East, intelligence, religion
 and public policy, and Japan's role
 in Northeast Asia. The speaker on
 "The Role and Capabilities of U.S.
 Intelligence Operations in the 1980s,"
 Dr. Ray Cline of Georgetown's
 Center for Strategic and Interna-
 tional Studies, forcefully empha-
 sized the U.S. need for clandestine
 services to support friendly groups
 and frustrate hostile revolutionary
 forces abroad. High-quality research
 and analysis services are an abso-
 lute must if we are to understand
 international events and purposes,
 he said.
 An academic conference with a
 realistic political orientation is a
 refreshing welcome. For too long
 the American people have been
 overly exposed to reports, ads and
 statements by leftist elements of the
 academic world organized and
 manipulated by those who look to
 totalitarian-type solutions to long-
 standing economic and political
 problems.
 'b the argument that at least total-
 itarian states solve the problem of
 hunger, Dr. Kaplan reminds us that
 people are not cattle to be contented.
 It was John Stuart Mill who affirmed
 that he would rather be an unhappy
 human than a happy pig.
 One looks forward to the next
 PWPA conference.

 BOXING RATINGS
 The Junior Middleweights
 1. Sugar Ray Leonard-Ray
 had to give up his WBA junior
 middleweight title when he beat
 Hearns, but he's still the best in the
 division.
 2. Wilfred Benitez-Has good
 punching power at 154 pounds.
 Wilfred must get the desire for
 training to keep his title.
 3. Thomas Hearns-Hearns
 should concentrate on this division.
 He's too tall to be fooling around at
 147 pounds. This could be his ideal
 weight.
 4. Ayub Kalule-Fought his heart
 out against Leonard, but didn't have
 enough firepower to win. He could
 get his title back against a lesser
 opponent.
 S. Roberto Duran-"The No Mas
 Kid" is saying ridiculous things
 about beating up both Leonard and
 Hearns. Can you remember one
 time in his career when Duran was
 far behind in a fight and battled
 back to victory? I can't.
 6. Ibny Ayala Jr.-A surefie
 future champ. Ayala can punch
 with the best of them. His one
 punch 1st round KO of Jose
 Baquedano was super.
 7. Nino Gonzalez-Lost close
 disputed decision to Duran. Carl
 Duva is handling his future.
 Brother Lou nixed a Tony Ayala-
 Nino Gonzalez fight, according to
 Garden matchmaker Harold
 Weston.
 8. Rocky Fratto-Undefeated
 youngster from upstate New York
 might be better than people think. .
 He is fighting Tidashi Mihara
 (who?) for the WBA title left vacant
 by Leonard.
 9. Maurice Hope-Hope seemed
 to be all washed out when he lost
 the title to Benitez. He's strictly an
 opponent now.
 10. Charlie Weir-Good right
 hand puncher from South Africa
 can bang with the best of them.
 Chin not the best.
 The Junior Welterweights
 1. Saoul Mamby-Sweet Seoul
 is one of a kind. Could go down as
 one of the most underrated champs
 of all time.
 2. Aaron Pryor-Pryor is looking
 for a shot at Leonard's welter
 crown. Fat chance of winning.
 3. Miguel Mntilla-Lost in two
 title bids, but still hanging in there.
 4. Lennox Blackmore-Twice
 KO'd new lightweight champ
 Claude Noel, but was blitzed out in
 two by Pryor.
 S. Du Juan Johnson-Kronk stable
 mate of Hearns won a disputed nod
 over Montilla in Detroit.
 6. Jo Kimpuani-Lost a tough 15
 round decision to Mamby. Not
 through yet.
 7. Johnny Bumphus-"Bump
 City" needs more polishing.
 Punching power-average.
 8. Billy Costello-Needs TV
 exposure to get deserved recog-
 nition. Best left hooker in the
 division.
 9. Domingo Ayala-KO'd by
 Montilla and by welterweight Resto.
 Chin-horrible, yet he can bang.
 10. Monroe Brooks-Past prime.
 Good opponent.
 The Junior Lightweights
 1. Sammy Serrano-Best of
 a shaky lot. Division could change
 champs quickly.
 2. Rolando Navarett-Beat
 Boza-Edwards for the title. Also
 shaky crown.
 3. Cornelius Boza-Edwards-
 Might never recover from the
 beating he got from Navarete. He
 just takes too many punches.
 4. Edwin Rosario-My pick is for
 Rosario to beat Serrano for the title
 in December.
 S. Johnny Verderosa-"The Heat"
 from Staten Island needs work on
 his defense. A big banger could
 reach his chin.
 6. Tony Santana-Santana might
 move down to Featherweight. He
 shutout tough Alberto Colazzo in his
 last fight.
 7. Thtsutsuen Uehara-Won title
 from Serrano on "Hail Mary" right
 hand but gave it back early this
 year.
 8. Bazooka Limon-Dirtiest
 fighter around, but lot of heart.
 9. Ildefonso Bethelmy-Lost to
 Limon on 15 round KO.
 10. Hector "Macho" Camacho-
 Youngster from the Bronx looked
 impressive in stopping veteran
 Robert Mullins at the Garden.

 REPORT
 Sept. 16,1981 A Background Briefing On Strategic Events
 Moscow's
 Secretary of State Alexander Haig's
 recent charge that the Soviet Union is

 investigation into persistent reports of
 a "yellow rain" causing agonizing
 deaths among Lao, Cambodian and

 U.S. officials said the investigation
 had been stymied until recently when
 "fresh" samples of contaminated
 water, vegetation, blood and urine were
 shipped to Washington from Cambodia
 enabling researchers to identify the
 lethal agent involved.
 However, there is another factor
 behind the timing of Haig's
 announcement which U.S. officials
 may have been too embarrassed to
 mention. That is a book due to be pub-
 lished in New York next month, written
 by a lone investigator utilizing his own
 resources who managed to identify the
 deadly agent and its Soviet source
 months ahead of the U.S. government.
 The book is "Yellow Rain" by Ster-
 ling Seagraves (M. Evans publisher).
 An advance review of the hook
 appeared in the Far Eastern Economic
 Review, Aug. 21-27, written by Wash-
 ington correspondent Richard
 Nations.

 MOSCOW
 FROM PAGE 1
 Seagraves' book names the killing
 agent which proved so elusive to U.S.
 investigators as tricothecene, or T-2, a
 deadly compound including poisons
 originally developed in the Soviet
 Union 25 years ago. The toxin caused
 agonizing, convulsive deaths among
 Hmong hill tribesmen following aerial
 bombardments of a mysterious yellow
 powder, the "yellow rain" of the book's
 title.
 Seagraves links the bizarre hemor-
 rhaging deaths seen in Laos with the
 same symptoms reported in
 Afghanistan and Yemen, two other
 countries where chemical warfare
 against tribespeople has been widely
 reported during attempts by Soviet-
 backed communist governments to
 suppress opposition in remote moun-
 tain or desert areas, far from the pry-
 ing eyes of the Western press.
 U.S. lacked `proof'
 Suspicions that the Soviet Union
 was engaged in biological warfare - in
 direct violation of international
 agreements - had been heightened by
 reports of an accident that killed thou-
 sands in the city of Sverdlovsk in April
 1979. Eyewitnesses quoted in Samizdat
 (underground) reports indicate that
 more than 1,000 people died in the Sibe-
 rian city from a deadly virus or germ
 that escaped from a super-secret germ
 warfare laboratory.
 But the U.S. government, in its
 extensive investigations to identify the
 killing agent in Laos, said it had not
 established what it called "analytical
 proof" that T-2 was responsible until
 they received the samples from Cam-
 bodia earlier this year.
 From all indications, the delay in
 completing the investigation was due
 more to the Carter administration's
 reluctance to embarrass the Soviets
 while trying to establish "detente" than
 any mysteries concerning the deadly
 chemical.
 The CIA certainly had access to the
 same Lao and Cambodian refugees as
 Seagraves. It also is supposed to peruse
 Soviet technical literature for evi-
 dence of new advances in Soviet mili-
 tary capability. The fact that U.S.
 intelligence could not establish the
 obvious link between tricothecene
 toxin symptoms and the manufacture
 of the same toxin in the Soviet Union
 doesn't say much for U.S. intelligence
 capability. It also points to the
 politicization of the U.S. intelligence
 agencies dating from the Carter
 administration which has hampered
 their ability to provide this country
 with full and rapid evaluations of the
 Soviet threat.
 U.S. officials told Nations that
 "research in this country had been
 hampered, both by the clinically poor
 samples brought out of the Lao high-
 lands and by the inherent difficulties of
 formulating complicated tests without
 a plausible hypothesis to guide the
 search." The same sources concede
 that Seagraves had provided that
 hypothesis for the investigation.
 Hamstrung by `detente'
 One might ask what prevented the
 U.S. investigators from arriving at the
 same hypothesis. The answer appears
 to be that Seagraves was not ham-
 strung as the U.S. probers were by the
 political implications of pointing the
 finger at the Soviet Union while the
 Carter administration was playing
 footsie with the Kremlin.
 "Officials in the State Department
 and the Pentagon say privately that
 their search was not encouraged while
 the administration of former president
 Jimmy Carter was preoccupied with
 pursuing detente with the Soviet
 Union," Nations writes.
 Seagraves arrived at his hypothesis
 in two stages, first by comparing
 accounts of poison gassing episodes in
 Laos, Afghanistan and Yemen, and
 then isolating violent internal hemor-
 rhaging as the unique symptom hith-
 erto overlooked that is both common in
 most reported cases and the one phe-
 nomenon not accounted for by the
 known poison gases of the two world
 wars.
 Raised by missionary parents in
 northern Burma among hill tribes
 similar to the Hmong in Laos, Seag-
 raves travelled to Laos, Afghanistan
 and the Middle East for three years
 gathering material for his book. He
 then proceeded to identify the biotoxin
 tricothecene as the agent causing the
 mysterious bleeding symptomatic of
 the "yellow rain" deaths in Laos.
 U.S. target of germ bombs
 In publicizing Soviet involvement in
 illegal chemical warfare, the Reagan
 administration has acted none too
 soon. In his book, Seagraves presents
 evidence that bombs carrying the
 super toxin may be aimed at the United
 States from 90 miles away in Cuba.
 A recent column by Jack Anderson,
 which mentions the Seagraves book,
 refers to the death of a Cuban in
 Havana last year from symptoms dis-
 tinctly those of tricothecene toxin.
 Anderson also quotes his own CIA
 sources as saying that the toxin as well
 as other germ and chemical warfare
 agents are stored in Cuba for future use
 against the United States, based on the
 testimony of a defected Cuban officer
 who had trained in a chemical warfare
 battalion.
 FRANCE
 FROM PAGE I
 more active role in the Third World.
 That policy, according to analysts, con-
 trasts sharply with that of the Reagan
 administration.
 Of greatest concern to Washington
 is France's intervention into Latin
 American affairs. Mitterrand has a
 long history of supporting guerrilla
 movements in the region, and has
 appointed as his chief adviser on Third
 World affairs a former guerrilla -
 Regis Debray - who fought alongside
 Che Gueverra in Bolivia.
 Mitterrand has also been highly
 critical of U.S. policy in Central Amer-
 ica, including Reagan's cutoff of aid to
 Nicaragua and the U.S. trade embargo
 on Cuba. In an interview with Le Monde
 on July 2, he was quoted as saying: "I
 have serious reservations, not to say
 more, about U.S. policy in Central
 America. It is not a matter of Commu-
 nist subversion, but a refusal to see the
 misery and degradation."
 Mitterrand's election was hailed by
 Sandinista Commander Bayardo Arce,
 who referred to the French Socialist as
 "a militant of the Sandinista cause."
 Junta leader Daniel Ortega added his
 congratulations, saying "Your triumph
 is our triumph."
 In addition, Mitterrand's wife,
 Danielle, is a Socialist activist with a
 special interest in Latin America. She
 is a strong supporter of the political
 opposition in El Salvador and a mem-
 ber of the Salvadoran Solidarity Orga-
 nization.
 But the Socialist government's first
 big splash into international waters
 was not exactly a complete success.
 Officials at the French External
 Affairs Ministry, headed by veteran
 diplomat Claude Cheysson, said they
 were prepared for a hostile U.S.
 response to the French-Mexican decla-
 ration but were surprised by the force
 of Latin American reaction. Nine coun-
 tries, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia,
 Chile, the Dominican Republic, Guate-
 mala, Honduras, Paraguay and Ven-
 ezuela, issued a joint statement
 protesting French and Mexican inter-
 vention into El Salvador's internal
 affairs.
 Until now, the French government
 has focused its attention on domestic
 issues - nationalizing industries and
 revamping its social welfare system.
 But with the recent initiative on El Sal-
 vador, the Mitterrand government is
 beginning to exercise its foreign policy
 options.
 This could mean trouble for the

 United States, especially in matters
 involving the Third World. A recent
 Heritage Foundation study states that
 " Most of Mitterrand's and his Socialist
 Party's principles ... are diametrically
 opposed to those of the Reagan admin-
 istration" As a consequence, France
 could "play a critical role in undermin-
 ing American foreign policy."
 In some issues - such the nuclear
 modernization in Europe,
 Afghanistan, Poland and disarmament
 negotiations - Mitterrand's policies
 appear to coincide with Reagan's. For
 example, Mitterrand is the first
 French president to tentatively sup-
 port the deployment of NATO missiles
 in Europe.
 But these policies are primarilly
 defensive measures. According to the
 Heritage study, France continues to
 view the Atlantic Alliance as a "dis-
 tasteful necessity."
 In addition, analysts say, Mit-
 terand's denunciation of the invasion
 of Afghanistan along with other anti-
 Soviet rumblings are more an expres-
 sion of a independence from the two
 superpowers than a tough anti-Moscow
 line.
 Other problems are likely to crop up
 in the Middle East, where France main-
 tains strong economic ties to the Arab
 world. Despite Mitterrand's personal
 support of Israel and the Camp David
 accords, economic pressure and oppo-
 sition from his own Cabinet memem-
 bers is likely to influence French
 policy in the region.
 At the heart of the problem is a dif-
 fering perception of Western responsi-
 bilities and relations to the so-called
 'T'hird World. French Foreign Minister
 Cheysson has warned that the Reagan
 administration could provoke "major
 difficulty" with its European allies and
 with France in particular if it fails to
 improve relations between the indus-
 trialized nations of the "North" and the
 developing nations of the "South"
 Washington has placed great
 emphasis upon the developing world -
 Reagan himself plans to attend the
 upcoming North-South talks in Can-
 cun, Mexico - but tends to view devel-
 opment issues within the context of
 East-West relations and the threat
 posed by Soviet expansionism.
 BA CKGROUNDER
 Despite the fact that Ronald
 Reagan, during last year's presidential
 campaign, suggested that an appropri-
 ate U.S. response to a Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan might be to blockade
 Cuba, his administration now has ruled
 out that option should the Russians
 invade Poland.
 Reagan's get-tough response to
 Soviet military aggression drew fire
 and even ridicule from some members
 of former President Carter's adminis-
 tration. But Reagan's advisers recog-
 nized that the Soviets would respect
 such "linkage" and would understand
 that there is a price to be paid for their
 empire-building activities.
 The policy of "linkage" continues to
 play a major role in the administra-
 tion's approach to the Soviet Union in
 such areas as strategic arms control.
 Secretary of State Alexander Haig has
 stated that Soviet military behavior
 will be tied to U.S. involvement in
 future SALT negotiations, for example.
 But linkage is apparently limited in
 the scope of its application.
 The State Department, National
 Security Council, U.S. intelligence and
 other agencies have been preparing
 policy options for the president should
 Poland be invaded. Some of the sug-
 gested responses include: suspension
 of grain sales, halting of trade, censure
 by the United Nations and other diplo-
 matic actions taken in concert with U.S.
 allies, and beefed-up broadcasting of
 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to
 Eastern Europe.
 Other suggestions are more out of
 the ordinary, such as positioning a U.S.
 warship in international waters off the
 coast of Poland to rescue "boat people"
 fleeing that country.
 But the Cuba quarantine has been
 ruled out by the administration insofar
 as Poland is concerned. "A naval
 blockade would be an inconclusive
 measure and of dubious relevance,"
 said one informed source.
 "'Ib attack Cuba, while the Russians
 are attacking Poland, would be to tell
 the world that the two superpowers are
 symmetrical - each attacks a weak
 country," he said, adding that such an
 action would be counter-productive.
 Cuba, however, could be blockaded
 by the United States if Fidel Castro
 steps up his drive to subvert
 neighboring Latin American coun-
 tries, and intelligence agencies have
 concluded that Soviet ruler Leonid
 Brezhnev would not jump to the aid of a
 beleaguered Cuba.
 North Korean arms shipments to
 Iran have escalated, but are now com-
 ing by sea rather than being
 transported by Iranian 747s as they
 were shortly after the outbreak of the
 Iran-Iraq war. Why is Kim 11-sung con-
 tinuing to supply light arms and artil-
 lery to a nation at war with Pyongyang's
 non-aligned comrades in Iraq?
 Perhaps his tactics were coordi-
 nated with Moscow. Or, as some ana-
 lysts suggest, Kim may like Khomeini's
 strident anti-Western rhetoric and the
 hard currency he has to offer.
 During his visit last month to Aden,
 South Yemen, Libya's Moammar Qad-
 dafi signed a friendship treaty with the
 leaders of South Yemen and Ethiopia in
 which they vowed to cooperate in
 opposing U.S. designs in the region.
 Qaddafi also talked to representatives
 of such Arab organizations as the
 Sudanese communists, the Gulf Liber-
 ation Front, the Oman Popular Liber-
 ation Front, Lebanon's communist
 party, and the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
 Qaddafi continued to call publicly
 for peace between the pro-Soviet
 regime in South Yemen and North
 Yemen, which is backed by Saudi Ara-
 bia and, increasingly,by Iraq. But his
 money is likely to continue to support
 Aden's guerrilla activities to the North.
 Some North Yemenis are bitter that
 the West is not supporting their
 struggle.
 .  One villager, who had moved to the
 capital with his family, told our corre-
 spondent: "It is ultimately Russia
 which is supplying the front with weap-
 ons through  the rulers of South
 Yemen. But who is helping us? The
 West and America are just looking on"
 An intense educational program on
 civil defense is stirring uneasiness
 among the East Germans, many of
 whom recall similar feelings just
 before the beginning of the Second
 World War. According to reports from
 East Berlin, students throughout that
 district are learning how to build air
 raid shelters during compulsory
 seven-day courses in civil defense. And
 government publications on the sub-
 ject are increasing in number.
 "Every citizen has to participate in
 the strengthening of the national
 defense with greater personal effort,"
 stressed Col. Werner Huebner in the
 party magazine, Einheit (Unity).
 Huebner, who is the director of the
 Central Committee for Socialist
 Defense Education, said that "if peace
 is at stake, we cannot tolerate egoism
 and laziness."

 North-South violence flares again in Korea
 North and South Korean soldiers
 fought a 10-minute machine-gun battle
 across the tense Demilitarized Zone
 shortly after a Japanese government
 delegation recently visited the truce
 village of Panmunjom.
 There was no indication that the two
 events were connected, but the
 shooting seemed to underline the lin-
 gering threat of renewed conflict in the
 Korean peninsula more than 30 years
 after North Korea started the Korean
 War.
 The South Korean government has
 asked Japan for economic aid which
 would help Seoul to boost its defenses
 against the military threat from the
 North.
 On the day of the fighting, however,
 talks between the visiting Japanese
 delegation, led by Foreign Minister
 Suaao Sonoda, and South Korean offi-
 cials in Seoul ended in disagreement on
 the aid issue. Sonoda reiterated his
 government's position that Tokyo was
 unwilling to help fund South Korea's
 defense because it would conflict with
 Japan's "peace" constitution. A first
 round of Japanese-South Korean talks
 held in Tokyo barely three weeks ear-
 lier had stumbled on the same problem
 (See International Report No. 36).
 Sonoda and five other Japanese offi-
 cials briefly visited Panmunjom, about
 90 miles to the west of where the
 shooting occurred minutes later.
 In its account of the incident, the
 Seoul Defense Ministry reported no
 South Korean casualties. It was not
 known whether anyone was hit on the
 North Korean side, whose guards at
 one of the DMZ border posts had
 started the firefight.
 A South Korean spokesman blasted
 the North Koreans for their "stepped-
 up provocation." The last similar inci-
 dent had been reported in April, when
 North Korean forces fired across the
 DMZ in a vain attempt to prevent one of
 their soldiers from defecting to the
 South.
 The Seoul talks failed to produce a
 customary joint communique, but the
 two sides agreed that a meeting should
 be arranged between South Korean
 President Chun Doo-hwan and Jap-
 anese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki.
 No date was set.
 Tokyo has been unwilling to accept
 the South Korean contention that the
 Japanese should contribute to Seoul's
 defenses because they have an impor-
 tant stake in preventing a possible com-
 munist invasion or takeover of South
 Korea which would also pose a threat to
 Japan.
 But South Korean efforts to obtain
 increased economic aid from Japan
 got a boost in early September when
 formerPrime Minister Kakuei Thnaka,
 one of Tokyo's most powerful political
 figures, backed the idea. He was
 quoted as saying, "It is unnatural that
 there should be such a big fuss about $5
 billion or $6 billion needed (by South
 Korea) for economic assistance."
 Japan's second-largest opposition
 group, the centrist Komeito Party, also
 recently threw its support behind
 Seoul's request for more aid.
 In another development, seven U.S.
 Air Force advanced F-16 jet fighters
 arrived at the South Korean air base of
 Kunsan recently. A total of 48 F- 16s are
 expected to be deployed in the country
 by next March, replacing the aging
 USAF F-4 Phantom jets.
 Chinese labor camp
 A unique hand-written 196-page
 account of life in a Chinese communist
 prison camp was reportedly smuggled
 out recently. The document, penne1 by
 38-year-old dissident Liu Qing records
 instances of prison brutality, including
 severe beatings, and bitterly criticizes
 Peking's political and legal system.
 Many thousands of Chinese unde-
 sirables are said to live in communist
 penal camps where they undergo "edu-
 cation through labor."
 Knowledgeable Chinese sources
 said they believed Liu's report was
 genuine.
 Liu had reportedly sold transcripts
 of the trial of China's well-known dissi-
 dent Wei Jingsheng and was arrested
 in Peking in November 1979. Wei was
 imprisoned for 15 years on subversion
 charges.
 Western correspondents in Peking
 obtained Liu's document at a time when
 Peking officials have launched a
 renewed effort to clamp down on what
 they call a Western-influenced "bour-
 geois liberalist tendency" among Chi-
 nese writers and artists.
 The Peking campaign mainly
 involves attacks by high-level party
 functionaries, including the top lead-
 ership, in the state media against
 "ultra-individualistic" artists who
 "want absolute liberty." Strong and
 repeated official criticism was espe-
 cially leveled against 61-year-old
 screen writer Bai Hua for his film
 script "Bitter Love," in which he por-
 trayed the late Mao Tse-tung as a "god
 who failed" and raised questions about
 China's future under communism.
 Attacks on Bai Hua are widely seen as
 a warning to the public against
 expressing similar thoughts.
 In another development in Peking
 recently, the standing committee of the
 National People's Congress rubber-
 stamped a relatively minor cabinet
 shuffle among several trade and indus-
 try ministry posts. It also said that an
 NPC session in November will discuss
 a report on the national economy by
 Premier Zhao Ziyang.
 Among the announced changes in
 the cabinet was the replacement of
 Foreign Trade Minister Li Qiang by
 Zheng Thubin.
 Cambodians seek to formn exile government
 Leaders of the three main Cambo-
 dian resistance groups met in Singa-
 pore during the first half of September
 and agreed in principle to form a coali-
 tion government-in-exile. Although
 many important details still have to be
 worked out in future negotiations, the
 three factions want to present the out-
 line of their consensus before the cur-
 rent session of the United Nations
 General Assembly.
 The U.N. still recognizes the ousted
 Marxist Khmer Rouge regime led by
 Khieu Samphan and Pol Pot as the
 legitimate government of Cambodia
 under the name of "Democratic Kam-
 puchea"
 Aside from Khieu, the other leaders
 at the Singapore talks were former
 Prime Minister Son Sann and Prince
 Norodom Sihanouk. Further talks are
 to be held in Bangkok.
 Some officials of the five-member
 Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations (ASEAN) - which organized
 the meeting - were quoted as saying
 the Khmer Rouge appeared to he
 intransigent.

 Analysts believe the group's Peking
 backers have encouraged them to take
 an aggressive stance by providing
 them with ample supplies of weapons
 and funds and by spreading massive
 pro-Khmer Rouge propaganda. This
 propaganda is believed to be responsi-
 ble for a widespread belief that the
 Khmer Rouge are the only effective
 anti-Vietnamese resistance group in
 Cambodia.
 Some media reports, attributed
 mostly to statements by Thai officials,
 have recently suggested that Son Sann
 was intransigent in demanding that
 Khmer Rouge leaders leave Cambodia
 following a possible withdrawal of
 Vietnam's 200,000 occupation troops
 and that military leadership should go
 to his Khmer People's National Liber-
 ation Front (KPNLF). But analysts sup-
 port Son Sann's contention that the
 Cambodian people would prefer con-
 tinued Vietnamese control over a
 return to power of the genocidal
 Khmer Rouge.
 The analysts believe many reports
 of Khmer Rouge victories in fighting
 Vietnamese-led government troops
 inside Cambodia are being deliber-
 ately exaggerated in order to boost
 their credibility as a resistance force.
 But they concede that well-trained
 Khmer Rouge guerrillas could prob-
 ably overwhelm the smaller and rel-
 atively ill-equipped KPNLF army and
 Sihanouk's tiny Moulinaka group if the
 Vietnamese left Cambodia. Son Sann's
 aides have explained that this is the
 main reason for his reluctance to com-
 promise on some political and military
 issues, saying most Cambodians could
 not support him if he opened the way
 fora possible Khmer Rouge comeback.
 Intense pressure from the Thai gov-
 ernment - which wants to please
 Peking because it sees China as its only
 potential protector against Vietnam-
 ese aggression - led Son Sann to
 weaken his strong stand against
 Khmer Rouge participation in a future
 Cambodian administration.
 But observers believe the KPNLF
 leader hopes to get political and mate-
 rial support from Western countries -
 especially the United States which has
 so far done practically nothing to
 strengthen Son Sann's position vis-a-
 vis the Khmer Rouge - in return for
 his readiness to deal with the Pol Pot
 group.
 Vietnam, meanwhile, reportedly
 made a lame attempt to improve the
 prospects for ASEAN recognition of its
 puppet regime in Phnom Penh by sug-
 gesting to Indonesian officials that it
 was willing to replace President Heng
 Samrin with Communist Party chief
 Pen Sovan. Diplomats in Jakarta
 apparently spread the rumor that such
 a suggestion - which some observers
 termed ridiculous - was made by
 Hanoi officials in talks with visiting
 Indonesian military intelligence chief
 Benny Murdani recently.
 Within ASEAN, Indonesia is prob-
 ably the staunchest opponent of
 Peking's policies toward the region. It
 is also generally more receptive to
 Vietnam's repeatedly stated concerns
 about a Chinese threat than some of the
 other ASEAN governments.
 Afghan rebels on offensive
 The Hizbe Islami Afghan guerrilla
 group claimed recently to have wiped
 out up to 1,000 Soviet troops and
 destroyed 200 tanks at the important
 Baghlan province army base of Qalagi,
 about 90 miles north of Kabul. The
 insurgents said their attack, in late
 August, was the most devastating
 operation they have carried out since
 the 1979 Soviet invasion.
 Western diplomats have confirmed
 recent major guerrilla successes in
 repelling Soviet offensives, but the
 Hizbe group's figure for Soviet casual-
 ties in the Qalagi raid was probably
 inflated.
 Inanother development, diplomatic
 sources said in early September that
 Moslem insurgents have thwarted
 attempts by Soviet-led Afghan govern-
 ment forces to seize strategic Panjshir
 Valley, some 60 miles north of the capi-
 tal.
 The sources also said that guerril-
 las had regained control of the town of
 Paghman near Kabul.
 Kabul authorities, meanwhile, have
 limited a recent call-up order for for-
 mer soldiers under age 35 following
 widespread demonstrations against
 the move.
 Police reportedly killed two stu-
 dents at a Kabul girls' school in trying
 to forcefully disperse demonstrators
 protesting the call-up, which was
 announced at the beginning of this
 month. Many other public protest
 moves were reported for several days,
 including a one-day strike by shop-
 keepers. An undetermined number of
 people were injured in confrontations
 with government forces.
 The authorities later issued a modi-
 fied version of the original
 announcement, exempting teachers,
 lecturers, students and government-
 employed drivers from the call-up.
 The Kabul regime is desperately
 trying to bolster the ranks of its army,
 which have been depleted by mass
 desertions.
 Egyptians explode KGB operation... again
 Egyptian intelligence officers
 capped a three-year investigation of
 KGB activity in Egypt on Sept. 15 with
 the expulsion of the Soviet ambassador
 and six other diplomats.
 In a long operation dubbed "Apple
 19" involving the use of electronically
 monitored contacts between the KGB
 members and Egyptian opposition fig-
 ures, the Egyptians discovered that
 Soviet intelligence agents mas-
 querading as diplomats in Cairo had
 engaged in anti-state activities and
 were responsible for much of the sec-
 tarian strife in Egypt during the last
 year.
 The development confirmed the
 fears of many experts who have
 warned that Egypt, because of its
 closeness to the United States, has been
 one of the foremost targets of Soviet
 subversion.
 The case seemed a textbook exam-
 ple of KGB activity in foreign coun-
 tries.
 The Soviets booted from Egypt
 included Ambassador Vladimir Pol-
 yakov, six of his embassy staff, two
 Soviet journalists - one for the Soviet
 news agency Thss and the other for the
 magazine Trud - and a Hungarian spy
 working as a diplomat.
 They were accused of working - in
 coordination with intelligence ser-
 vices and embassies of ther Eastern
 bloc countries and local communists -
 to overthrow the government of
 President Anwar Sadat and fomenting
 sectarian strife.
 The Egyptian government also can-
 celed the contracts of all Soviet techni-
 cians working in Egypt - frequently
 sent by Moscow to Third World coun-
 tries equipped with special training in
 indoctrination and disinformation
 techniques - and gave them a week to
 leave.
 Western sources say about 1,000
 Soviet experts remained in Egypt this
 week - mostly working at the Soviet-
 built Aswan dam and working in steel
 and aluminum plants and other pro-
 jects.
 In addition, the Egyptian govern-
 ment ordered the Soviet military
 bureau in Cairo closed and shut down
 its own military office in Moscow.
 Cairo charged that the Soviets
 recruited Egyptians to spy on "politi-
 cal, religious, economic and military
 conditions touching on state security"
 and played "an outstanding role insti-
 gating and escalating Moslem-
 Christian strife."

 The Soviet Embassy was also
 ordered to reduce its staff. Moscow
 will be able to post no more diplomats
 to Cairo than Egypt has posted in the
 Kremlin. The 1981 diplomatic direc-
 tory lists 40 Soviet diplomats in Cairo,
 nearly twice the number of Egyptian
 envoys in Moscow. Cairo gave the
 embassy one week to reduce its staff.
 The expulsions come two days after
 the public announcement of the Soviet
 plot. According to the official Egyptian
 newspaper Mayo, two Soviet diplomats
 were the link between the local plotters
 and Moscow.
 The paper said the plot, code-named
 "The Swamp;' involved, in addition to
 KGB agents, a former Egyptian deputy
 prime minister, Mohammed Zayyat -
 said to have been the local head of the
 operation - as well as former minis-
 ters, university lecturers and journal-
 ists.
 Other prominent Egyptians
 accused of taking part in the plot were
 the deputy chairman of the leading
 opposition Socialist Labor Party,
 Mohammed Murad, a prominent fig-
 ure representing the Moscow-oriented
 National Unionist Progressive rally.
 The eight Egyptians involved were
 among the more than 1,500 people
 arrested on Sept. 5 during a govern-
 ment crackdown on Moslem and
 Christian extremists and political
 radicals.
 There was no reaction from the
 Kremlin to the Cairo crackdown,
 although Moscow Radio dismissed as
 "absurd" the charges by Sadat of
 Soviet involvement in plots.
 Relations between the Soviet Union
 and Egypt have been strained since
 Sadat unceremoniously expelled
 17,000 Soviet military personnel in
 1972.
 Four years later, he unilaterally
 abrogated a friendship treaty with the
 Soviets because of their opposition to
 his Middle East peace policies and rap-
 prochement with the United States.
 In January 1980, Sadat ordered a
 more than 50 percent reduction in
 Soviet embassy staff to protest the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
 Experts say that one of the Soviet
 Union's aims in Egypt was to arrange
 communication links between Egyp-
 tian leftists and the hard-line Arab
 rejectionist front.
 The front consists of Algeria, Syria,
 Libya, South Yemen and the Palestine
 Liberation Organization - all closely
 tied to Soviet Mideast policy. All the
 countries involved have severed diplo-
 matic ties with Egypt and have been
 violently hostile to Sadat's Mideast
 peace policies.
 The hard-liners gathered in Libya
 on the day of the expulsion to discuss
 the new U.S.-Israeli strategic cooper-
 ation agreement. Iran was invited to
 join their organization and partici-
 pated in the meeting.
 The immediate purpose of the Libya
 gathering was to devise a plan to coun-
 ter the Reagan administration's plan
 for a strategic alliance of pro-West
 nations in the Middle East. Last week,
 Prime Minister Menachem Begin met
 with President Reagan in Washington
 where they agreed to forge a strategic
 cooperation agreement to oppose
 Soviet expansion in the region.
 Defense Secretary Caspar Wein-
 berger and Israeli Defense Minister
 Ariel Sharon will meet in November to
 work out the overall plan.
 Western allies abstain as U.N. slaps S. Africa.
 The major Western powers and
 Japan rejected a harsh and polemical
 condemnation of South Africa by the
 United Nations in mid-September.
 In a 117-0 vote, the U.N. General
 Assembly voted to "impose compre-
 hensive sanctions" to punish South
 Africa for its recent raid into Angola to
 wipe out terrorist strongholds and for
 its reluctance to grant indepdendence
 to Namibia on U.N. terms.
 Ignoring Third World rhetoric, the
 U.S., Britain, France, Japan, Canada
 and West Germany along with 19 other
 nations abstained from voting on the
 U.N. resolution.
 In terms of its actual repurcussions,
 the U.N. vote against the South Afri-
 cans is virtually meaningless.
 The U.N. wants to supervise elec-
 tions in Namibia but insists on
 maintaining its long-standing recogni-
 tion of the Soviet-backed South West
 Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
 as the "sole legitimate representative
 of the Namibian people."
 There are several major political
 parties in the territory which, unlike
 SWAPO, do not promote violent "class
 struggle." But the U.N. has consistently
 refused to recognize them. This, pri-
 marily, has led South Africa to block
 the road toward Namibian indepen-
 dence, which, in return, has resulted in
 additional condemnation from the U.N.
 Mutinies plague Chad
 Beginning in early September, a
 series of army mutinies erupted in
 Christian-dominated southern Chad,
 creating suspicions of Libyan
 involvement, according to Vice
 President Abelkader Wadal
 Kamougue. Not surprisingly, however,
 there were no public accusations
 against Libya, which is believed to
 maintain more than 5,000 troops and
 advisers in Chad to bolster the regime
 of President Goukouni Oueddei.
 The immediate cause of the riots
 appear to be the government's inability
 to pay its army. This created a situation
 on Sept. 9 in which troops took over the
 town of Sarh, Chad's third largest. Gov-
 ernment officials and army officers
 were seized, along with government
 money.
 Reports have been circulating of
 alleged embezzlement of public funds
 by the government of the southern
 zone.
 Kamougue is a southerner himself
 and he may represent a faction in the
 government which has come to resent
 Libya's attempts to promote its ide-
 ology of Islamic socialism and pro-
 Sovietism throughout Africa. The
 northern parts of Chad are dominated
 by Semitic Muslim peoples whereas
 the southern population is mostly
 black and Christian.
 More Uganda terror
 Ugandan government troops in
 mid-September murdered 18 civilians,
 including children, in the village of
 Wakio during a three-day rampage,
 according to residents.
 This was the latest of several major
 looting and killing incidents involving
 Uganda's undisciplined army. On Sept.
 1, police and troops battled in Kampala
 after soldiers reportedly robbed civil-
 ians.
 Government officials denied that
 anti-government  insurgents were
 involved. Socialist President Milton
 Obote has vowed a complete investiga-
 tion.
 Other wanton killings by Ugandan
 forces have been reported in north-
 western Uganda. More than 100,000
 refugees have escaped into
 neighboring Zaire as of early Septem-
 ber, according to missionaries and
 relief officials.
 Libya-Sudan war of words
 Sudanese officials quickly denied a
 recent statement by the Libyan news
 agency JANA that a state of emer-
 gency had been declared in Sudan and
 that disaffected army officers had
 been arrested there.

 sion between the two countries,
 officials in Khartoum denounced the
 Libyan regime's allegations. Tripoli
 has been trying to foment rebellion in
 Sudan through guerrilla groups and
 other Sudanese opponents of Khar-
 toum's pro-Egypt and anti-Soviet
 stance.
 Sudanese army and security forces
 have been conducting exercises
 recently, according to the Khartoum
 officials who note their troops were
 "testing military efficiency." It was not
 known if the exercises were related to
 recent published reports of a Libyan-
 hacked buildup of guerrilla forces
 close to the Sudanese border in
 neighboring Chad.
 Solidarity s `bill of rights' threatens Moscow
 Solidarity's first-ever national con-
 gress this month was much more than
 simply a meeting of trade union del-
 egates. It was more like a political con-
 vention, and a final resolution drafted
 by union members read like a bill of
 rights for Eastern Europe.
 Speeches given by the delegates
 showed that Solidarity was far more
 interested in politics than mundane
 trade union matters. Resolutions
 adopted by the 892 delegates called for
 free elections to the national parlia-
 ment, a national referendum on the
 scope of self-mangement, and reforms
 that would grant workers significant
 power in running businesses and fac-
 tories. They also demanded "social
 control" over mass media and changes
 in educational textbooks, as well as
 freedom for political prisoners.
 All this was heady stuff for a nation
 very much under the dominion of the
 Soviet Union. Tb no one's surprise, the
 Kremlin reacted harshly to the Soli-
 darity congress, calling it an "anti-
 socialist, anti-Soviet orgy."
 According to Western diplomats,
 the fury of Soviet attacks on Solidarity
 has shown that the Kremlin's
 "patience" with developments in
 Poland is beginning to wear very thin.
 This week, the Soviet Union
 accused Solidarity of spreading an
 anti-Soviet and anti-socialist "psycho-
 sis" in preparation for overthrowing
 the government.
 Of particular concern to Moscow
 has been Solidarity's demand for
 access to the mass media. Solidarity
 leader Lech Walesa was quoted
 recently as saying his union would
 build its own television transmitter if
 the communist authorities continued
 to restrict the union's access to the
 mass media.
 But the head of state television,
 Stanislaw Loranc, retorted by vowing
 that the authorities would oppose all
 attempts to break the state
 broadcasting monopoly.
 Three commentaries published by
 the official Soviet media left no doubt
 that Moscow was not only enraged by
 the resolutions passed at Solidarity's
 Gdansk congress but also regarded
 them as a direct challenge.
 Gone were previous careful
 attempts to direct all criticism of the
 10-million member union towards an
 unspecified group of "extremists" in
 the leadership. Instead, Solidarity as a
 whole was condemned as a counter-
 revolutionary group ready to "make a
 grab at power."
 Absentalso wereany expressions of
 confidence or support for the hard-
 pressed communist leadership in War-
 saw.
 A particularly sharp attack was
 reserved for the union's declaration of
 support for the creation of indepen-
 dent trade unions elsewhere in the
 Soviet bloc, branded by the commen-
 tary as "openly provocative and impu-
 dent toward the socialist countries."
 Diplomats said this showed that in
 M'hscow's eyes Solidarity had gone too
 far, that it was now challenging not only
 the leadership in Warsaw but Commu-
 nist authority in the whole Soviet bloc.
 There has been little sign that other
 governments need fear the birth of a
 rebellious labor movement. But the
 Kremlin might consider that the sheer
 "insolence" of the union toward Mos-
 cow could undermine its authority in
 Eastern Europe.
 But other diplomats said Moscow
 will bide its time and hope the growing
 shortages of food and fuel in Poland
 would solve the problem by them-
 selves.
 The Kremlin may be hoping hard-
 ships of the coming winter will destroy
 Solidarity's credibility. If violence
 broke out, an intervention to restore
 law and order could be presented to the
 rest of the world as an act of mercy.
 Haig bolsters NATO morale in anti-Soviet talk
 Secretary of State Alexander Haig
 has accused Moscow of jeopardizing
 peace in Europe through its rapid
 expansion of nuclear weaponry in the
 region.
 The accusations were contained in a
 recent speech in West Berlin designed
 to boost the morale of NATO allies and
 halt the drift toward neutralism in
 Europe. Washington has been con-
 cerned by the reluctance of some Euro-
 pean allies to either boost their defense
 spending or agree to a NATO plan to
 deploy medium-range nuclear mis-
 siles on their soil.
 "It is Soviet tanks, not NATO's
 defense against those tanks that
 threaten the peace of Europe," Haig
 said, charging the Soviets with a "rapid
 expansion of nuclear weaponry" in
 Europe.
 In the speech, Haig also accused the
 Soviet Union of using poisonous
 chemicals in Afghanistan and Indo-
 china in violation of international
 agreements.
 The speech took place before a
 backdrop of violent anti-U.S. demonos-
 trations in West Berlin. Sixty police
 were injured and 128 arrests reported
 during a demonstration of up to 50,000
 protesters.
 The official sponsors of the demon-
 stration were the youth organizations
 of the SocialDemocrats and of Foreign
 Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's
 Free Democrats. Also participating in
 the demonstrations were the Commu-
 nist Party, pacifist, religious-liberal
 and anarchist groups. But radical left-
 ists were known to have played an
 instrumental role in organizing the
 rioting. Rally organizers played heav-
 ily on fears of war and opposition to the
 NATO plan to deploy U.S. medium-
 range missiles in Europe.
 Two days after the demonstration,
 the commander-in-chief of the U.S.
 Army in Europe was slightly injured in
 an ambush by terrorists firing guns
 and anti-tank grenades. It was the
 fourth terrorist attack on Americans in
 West Germany in two weeks.
 A spate of anti-American protests,
 including arson attacks, followed the
 bombing last month of the U.S. Ram-

 bility.
 Norway votes right
 A conservative-led coalition com-
 mitted to strong NATO ties has
 defeated Norway's Labor Party gov-
 ernment under Gro Harlem Brund-
 tland, the Nordic country's first
 woman prime minister. Although the
 Labor Party emerged with the largest
 bloc of seats, Conservative Party
 leader Kaare Willoch was expected to
 become the next prime minister by
 forming a coalition with two smaller
 conservative groups.
 The Conservatives promised a
 period of economic austerity, firm
 adherence to the NATO alliance and an
 end to Mrs. Brundtland's often tempes-
 tuous, aggressive style of government.
 Willoch, who describes himself as
 "not extremely liberal in economic
 policy, but anti-socialist," strongly
 favors more defense spending. While
 Labor was legislating NATO's 3 per-
 cent annual defense increase last year.
 Willoch was urging a 4 percent
 increase.
 Qaddafi tied to British left
 Libyan strongman Moammar Qad-
 dafi has reportedly been making reg-
 ular contributions in packages
 sometimes as large as $100,000 to left-
 ist supporters in Britain.
 According the the Sunday 't'ele-
 graph newspaper, much of the money
 was donated to the Workers Rev-
 olutionary Party-whose most famous
 member reportedly is actress Vanessa
 Redgrave-to finance leftist activities
 and subsidize its party journal, News
 Line.
 The WRP is active in several unions
 and in inner city areas such as the Lon-
 don slum of Brixton, where race riots
 erupted last spring and during the
 summer resulting in hundreds of
 arrests.
 The newspaper, quoting Libyan
 exiles living in London, said'Tripoli had
 made regular donations as high as
 $100,000 once or twice a year over the
 past several years to leftist groups in
 Britain.
 Pinochet shuts down his Marxist opposition
 Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military
 government marked its eighth anni-
 versary in power earlier this month
 with a renewed pledge to crack down on
 communist advances in Chile.
 Despite a recent upsurge of guer-
 rilla violence attributed to the out-
 lawed Movement of the Revolutionary
 Left, President Pinochet retains a firm
 grip on the nation. The Chilean leader,
 who led the 1973 military coup against
 Marxist Salvador Allende, has banned
 political activity and rendered the for-
 merly heavily politicized trade unions
 powerless in what is officially
 described as a transition to democracy.
 Last year, 67 percent of Chilean voters
 voted in favor of a new constitution
 extending military rule for at least
 eight more years, a term which ends in
 1989 with presidential elections.
 During the anniversary celebra-
 tion, Pinochet said Chile's interna-
 tional relations were improving
 despite "an active anti-Chilean cam-
 paign being conducted from Moscow."
 He announced in his speech that the
 government would elaborate a new law
 to define terrorist crimes and to penal-
 ties to be imposed so that "this evil
 which threatens all Chileans can he
 eradicated."
 Referring to relations with the
 United States, he said positive results
 had been obtained since President
 Reagan came to office.
 Reagan has moved to end a U.S.
 embargo on arms exports to Chile
 imposed by President Carter's admin-
 istration in protest over Chile's human
 rights record.
 Pinochet cited the official visit to
 Chile last October by President Joao
 Figueiredo of Brazil as contributing to
 "promising expectations" and added
 that Chilean views coincided with
 many of those held by Uruguay and
 Paraguay - which both have military-
 dominated governments.

 New crackdown in Managua
 Nicaragua's leftist rulers have
 declared an economic state of emer-
 gency with a sweeping decree that
 bans strikes and court injunctions
 against government decrees for one
 year.
 The wide-ranging decree also pro-
 hibits "false" news reports that trigger
 changes in prices, salaries, rents or
 currency exchange rates.
 The "false" news report provision
 carries a maximum thi cc-year sen-
 tence as do provisions declaring it
 illegal to destroy raw materials or to
 halt the nation's mass transit system.
 Also outlawed are mass land
 takeovers and incitement of foreign
 governments or credit institutions to
 withhold or suspend economic aid to
 Nicaragua.
 The right to strike was suspended
 and individuals were banned from
 scei., .g cu;i: t injunctions to block gov-
 ernment administrative decisions.
 Junta leader Daniel Ortega also said
 unofficial currency exchanges, which
 buy U.S. dollars for more than twice the
 official rate of exchange, have been
 temporarily shut down. The govern-
 ment also is imposing a hiring freeze,
 trimming the current budget by five
 percent and slashing private sector
 subsidies by 10 percent in a move that
 should save the Nicaraguan treasury
 $43.gmillion this year, Ortega said.
 Caribbean aid on schedule
 A multinational plan to develop the
 Caribbean basin is expected to be com-
 pleted by next year. The economic plan,
 mapped out in a conference earlier this
 year, involves cooperation between the
 United States, Venezuela, Mexico and
 Canada, among other countries.
 A top State Department official,
 Thomas Enders, has emphasized the
 program will not be a "mini-Marshall"
 plan made in America, but instead an
 economic partnership among the more
 affluent nations in the Hesmisphere.
 "We can contemplate no aid to
 Cuba," Enders said. "So we agreed to
 disagree, and went on to emphasize
 what we do have in common - a com-
 mitment to helping the area. We believe
 we have established a firm partnership
 for preceeding," he said.
 Enders is undersecretary of state
 on inter-American affairs. He said that
 the foreign ministers of the United
 States, Canada, Venezuela and Mexico
 will meet later this year, and he added
 that contacts will be extended to inter-
 ested countries outside the Caribbean
 later in the fall. "We are not looking for
 quick fixes. There are none - and we
 know it," he said.
