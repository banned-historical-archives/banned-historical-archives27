 sole in the maritime industry.  But so long
 ,as the Government is involved-so long, for
 tastance, a s" the Government is called upon
 to pay 72 cents or more of every dollar in
 wages aboard subsidized ships-the voice of
 the Government must and will be heard.
 Now, I think we can all agree that neither
 higher subsidies nor higher rates could, by
 themselves, enhance the fortunes of the
 merchant marine.  Much more is required.
 As President Johnson said in exhorting us
 to achieve progress in our maritime affairs:
 "To do so will require much more than the
 answer of just money alone.  So in all the
 fields of transportation, our future progress
 depends upon the willingness of many dif-
 Zerent groups and interests to cooperate in
 a manner to which they are not always
 accustomed."
 Only with this kind of cooperation will the
 national interest be served.
 Only ' then, can each of us concerned with
 the standing of our merchant fleet be able
 to say he has done his utmost to shake off
 the effects of neglect.
 As men directly concerned, as officers of
 the U.S. merchant fleet, you will bear high
 responsibilities.  In your hands will be the
 security of your ship, your crew, your passen-
 gers, and the million of dollars in cargo that
 you carry.  These are life-and-death respon-
 sibilities assumed by few other Americans.
 But your commitment does not end on the
 bridge or in the engineroom.  I urge you to
 view your duties as far more than an exer-
 'cise of professional skills.                    View them in the
 perspective of national needs and national
 :purposes
 Pot only with that perspective can we truly
 restore America to its proper place in the
 high seas.
 Thank you, good sailing, and godspeed.
 stration while a chief of state is visiting the
 "majority elect" President of the United
 States of America, we cannot figure.  We
 know any true lover of peace, let them un-
 derstand, would trade all them for one Cap-
 tain Hackley, of Roanoke, my good friend
 (killed in action in South Vietnam) in or-
 der to return him to duty and family.
 To the haters of non-lethal (clearly de-
 fined in Webster) chemical agents, such as
 tear and vomiting gas, which is self explana-
 tory, doing what the names imply, and white
 phosphate, used in screening and marking.
 I've enclosed a picture of a bus.  The bus
 was filled with women and children and an
 incendiary round fired from a Chinese rocket
 launcher triggered the ambush in which Sgt.
 Jerry Rose of Huntington, W. Va., left forever
 a wife of only 9 months and family.
 To you "Mothers of Peace," or whatever
 you call yourselves, and the believers of only
 the United States are aggressors in what
 you call a civil war in Vietnam, there was
 no regard for the civilians in the bus.  This
 attack in the central highlands of the south
 was initiated by a hard core line unit of
 North Vietnamese regulars.
 To the providers of medical aid for the
 Vietcong, the American soldier here really
 has nothing but pity for you because of
 how misled and uninformed you are.  For
 your convenience, I've enclosed a picture of
 a young mother killed by small arms fire
 from Vietcong weapons and her baby which
 survived through a night alone before she
 was picked up by what you call dowrongers
 American soldiers and taken to Pleiku.  We
 are very happy to say the baby is much alive
 today, but without a family.  This medical
 aid they wish to render, we cannot believe
 here in South Vietnam would be put to its
 best advantage by troops that would murder
 a mother and run away in the night leaving
 a baby to feed on a dead breast.
 To all of the minority groups, as you re-
 turn home tonight from your banner waving,
 sit4owns, protesting, and all the other pitiful
 demonstrating you have done today, as you
 retire in front of your TV's with coffee and
 family in your secure homes, I pray you'll
 take a couple of minutes to think,  We are
 sure you'll say thanks for, above all, our
 God, health, country; president Johnson for
 carrying the weight of world problems and
 your petty grievances on his shoulders while
 you sleep; a powerful military of which over
 400 already with such strong convictions
 have died in Vietnam, and for democracy
 whereby tomorrow you may return to your
 demonstrations.
 We here in Vietnam will pray for the
 safety of our families and you, hoping that
 you, your children, and our sons will never
 see southeast Asia under any conditions other
 than peace, and we will remain forever if
 necessary to fulfill this goal-at any cost.

 Some Queries
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. GLENN R. DAVIS
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, August 3, 1965
 "Mr. DAVIS of Wisconsin.  Mr. Speak-
 er, Loyal Meek, formerly on the staff of
 Senator JACK MILLER, of Iowa, did not
 leave his keen perception of our Nation's
 problems behind him when he left Wash-
 ington to become the editorial writer on
 national affairs for the Milwaukee'Sen-
 tinel. In a recent editorial, he has pin-
 pointed our basic inconsistency in prose-
 cuting the war in Vietnam.  I com-
 mend Mr. Meek's penetrating queries to
 the thoughts of my colleagues:
 SOME QUERIES
 America's commitment to the war In Viet-
 nam is sharply and ominously escalated by
 President Johnson's decision to double the
 draft call.
 This must be done, Mr. Johnson tells the
 Nation.  Whether the Nation Is convinced
 of the necessity is by no means certain.
 The President has endeavored to persuade
 the people that the United States must make
 the stand against aggression in Vietnam and
 that he and his advisers are doing everything
 that can be done.
 Americans, with the exception of a few on
 the wild left, generally agree that Commu-
 nist aggression must be stopped.  But seri-
 ous doubts remain whether the United States
 is doing all that can and should be done
 to halt the spread of the Red evil.  Partic-
 ularly,  the question remains whether the
 United States has done everything it can
 short of taking the drastic step of expending
 more and more of "the flower of our youth"
 in those remote jungles.
 For example, has the United States done
 enough to choke off the supplying of the
 North Vietnam war machine by sea?
 According to unclassified figures available
 through  Defense Department  sources,  401
 ships flying the flags of free world nations
 called at North Vietnam ports during 1964.
 Disclosure has slowed down  this traffic.
 Still, through June of this year, 74 free world
 ships visited ports of North Vietnam.
 Representative  CHAMBERLAIN, Republican,
 of Michigan, has pointed out that since
 World War II, the United States has given
 almost $41 billion in aid to the countries
 that have been carrying on this trade.
 Even more astounding, he says, is the fact
 that the foreign aid authorization bill for the
 coming fiscal year proposes to give aid to six
 of the countries whose ships have been carry-
 ing cargos to North Vietnam during the
 first half of this year.
 Before  American  young  men  are  con-
 scripted to risk their lives in Vietnam, at
 poverty level wages at that, shouldn't the
 United States forthwith stop putting money
 into the hands that are feeding the enemy?
 Also, while we are bombing North Viet-
 nam, why do we spare the harbors through
 which are passing thousands of tons of sup-
 plies necessary to sustain the Communist
 fighting forces?
 Instead of listening to how grievous a de-
 cision it is to send young men off to war,
 we would like to hear the answers to these
 questions.

 ing the bow knife through the whitecaps.
 To my mind, man's sense of mastery over the
 elements cannot be equaled in any domain
 as at sea.  So in addition to my best wishes,
 my heart is with you newly licensed officers
 today.
 I don't need to discuss with you the pur-
 pose of the merchant fleet in war and peace.
 Neither must I expound the history of our
 country's oldest industry and the maritime
 tradition that is engraved in our national
 character.  Nor is it necessary to elaborate
 on the exciting challenges that lie in your
 future.
 You have been studying these things for
 4 years, and if those years at this, fine Acad-
 emy had not been productive you would not
 be members of the class of.1965.
 In the light of the maritime situation,
 however, I do want to reassert the Nation's
 interest in a strong, reliable merchant ma-
 rine-and to emphasize the need for putting
 the national interest first.
 Events in southeast Asia remind us dra-
 matically of how indispensable it is to have
 a merchant fleet ready and able.
 It is in time of peril that the sharpest
 focus is on our merchant marine.  National
 survival has often depended upon our capa-
 bility to move vast amounts of men and ma-
 teriel to faraway places where freedom Is
 challenged.
 We have seen this urgency demonstrated
 forcefully within the memory of many of us
 here today, in the two World Wars, in Ko-
 rea-and now in Vietnam.  In that distant
 but vital area of southeast Asia, the United
 States is fulfilling Its commitment to protect
 the right of people to live in liberty and
 dignity, free from subversion and naked ag-
 gression.
 All of us are involved in the commitment.
 The Maritime Administration already is re-
 activating ships from the National Defense
 Reserve fleets, at the call of the Military Sea
 Transportation Service.  MSTS is chartering
 private vessels to supply our forces in Viet-
 nam.  The flow of essential materiel must
 and will go on.
 And the, requirements of Vietnam could
 very well determine your initial billets.  So
 this to a crucial situation of distinct personal
 meaning to all of you.
 But it shouldn't be necessary to cite crises
 In order to underscore the national interest
 in a healthy merchant marine. The vital,
 continuing function of the maritime in-
 dustry is to transport people and products
 in intercontinental and coastal commerce,
 By all standards, this is a major Industry.
 By Itself, the maritime industry accounts
 for $1.5 billion of our gross national product.
 It pays $75 million in Federal and State
 taxes.  It  employs  100,000  workers,  who
 themselves pay $80 million in income taxes.
 Moreover,  the merchant       marine  is an
 essential element of the transportation com-
 plex which absorbs nearly 20 percent of the
 spending which goes into our total output
 of goods and srevices.  In 1964 this added
 up to $120 billion, an amount substantially
 greater than the Federal budget.
 This figure alone indicates just how much
 the cost of transportation affects the cost of
 everything we buy and just abouteverything
 we do.  And that Is why the Commerce De-
 partment Is giving such high priority to
 transportation research.  We want to im-
 prove the Nation's huge transportation sys-
 tem-and this includes the merchant fleet-
 in order to achieve significant economies in
 time, money, and efficiency. When we do so,
 we will be able to pour additional resources
 into a steadily -growing economy and thus
 raise the American living standards higher.
 A  strong,  competitive merchant  marine
 also serves the national interest by helping
 to overcome the deficit in our international
 balance of payments, which in the last sev-
 eral years grew to serious proportions.
 As a national concern, the balance of pay-
 ments cannot be overstressed.  The. dollar
 must and will be maintained at full value
 and full strength.
 Trade flows on confidence In. the. dollar,
 and trade is as essential to our domestic
 economy as it is, to the world economy.
 Nearly 31/2 million American workers owe
 their livelihood to exports.  The role of the
 merchant fleet in world trade is obvious.
 And its direct benefit to our payments posi-
 tion is substantial.  The U.S.-flag fleet con-
 serves millions in dollar exchange every year.
 And conserve we must-in every channel
 of  business,  banking,  and  commerce-for
 there must never be a doubt about the dollar.
 It is essential that we alleviate our payments
 deficit in order to maintain the strength of
 the dollar and curtail the drain in our gold.
 Let's state the case unequivocally:    the
 strength of our national economy and our
 defense  posture  rest  squarely  upon  the
 strength of the   dollar.     In solving our
 balance-of-payments problem a healthy U.S.
 merchant marine can make substantial con-
 tributions,
 We are making headway in easing the
 strains on the dollar.  As you know, Presi-
 dent Johnson developed a program of volun-
 tary cooperation among business and bank-
 ing executives to bring our international ac-
 counts into balance.    Businessmen have
 voluntarily exercised restraint on the invest-
 ment of dollars abroad, stepped up exports
 and taken other steps to improve their in-
 dividual balance-of-payments ledgers.  The
 results so far are promising. But parentheti-
 cally, I want to express regret that American
 traders who voluntarily committed them-
 selves to a key aspect of the President's pro-
 gram have been thrown off stride by the ship-
 ping tieup. They are the ones who agreed to
 use U.S. vessels to keep their transportation
 dollars at home-and who were compelled to
 use foreign bottoms instead, or find their
 cargoes immobilized in strike-bound ships.
 The  expansion  of  world  trade  and  its
 fabulous potential indicate the importance of
 maintaining a strong merchant marine.  To
 fulfill that interest, we have a lot of ground
 to make up.  President Johnson made this
 clear 2 weeks ago when he said our pros-
 perity and safety through history have been
 linked closely to our role on the seas of the
 world, a role we can never neglect.   The
 President added this:
 "I believe," he said, "we are all increas-
 ingly conscious of the fact that as a great
 nation we have been laggard and we have
 been neglectful in many areas of our trans-
 portation responsibilities and our transporta-
 ,.tion opportunities.
 "I am hopeful-greatly hopeful," the Presi-
 dent went on, "that we can in the next few
 years shake off the effects of these neglected
 years and move forward to acheive the pro-
 gress that we are so clearly capable of in
 every sector, from the highways on which we
 travel to the high seas upon which we sail."
 As Secretary of Commerce, I take that to
 mean that you and I and everyone connected
 with the maritime industry are under orders
 to achieve the progress we are capable of in
 revitalizing the merchant fleet and enhanc-
 ing its competitive capability through tech-
 nology and modernization.
 Regrettably,  we  must  admit  that  the
 United States does not now rank where it
 should in merchant seapower.   We have
 been neglectful.  We have not acted to meet
 the challenges of change and our competi-
 tion.                                                            When the world's most active trad-
 ing nation employs its own ships for only
 9 percent of its seaborne commerce, we are
 lagging behind our abilities as well as be-
 hind our competition.
 The present state of the merchant marine
 requires this frank assessment of our mari-
 time condition in view of an ever-increasing
 contribution  in  the  form  of  subsidies.
 A4279
 Since World War II operating subsidies have
 added up to $1.7 billion.  And since the
 start of the fleet replacement program in
 1955, construction subsidies have totaled
 $600 million.
 Clearly, subsidies, in themselves, do not
 provide the answers to our maritime prob-
 lems.  We have witnessed a decline in our
 maritime industry despite an increase in
 subsidies.
 President  Johnson  is  determined  to
 strengthen America  on      the  seas.  In  his
 state of the Union message he promised a
 new maritime policy. That policy is de-
 veloping.  About a year ago the President
 appointed an advisory committee represent-
 ing management, labor, and the public to
 make recommendations to the Secretaries
 of Commerce and Labor on matters of mari-
 time  concern.  The recommendations  are
 taking shape.
 In addition, we have created an interde???
 partmental task force on maritime policy
 'under the chairmanship of Alan Boyd, the
 Under Secretary of  Commerce  for Trans-
 portation.  The task force is working closely
 with the advisory committee, and on the
 basis of their respective findings Secretary
 of Labor Wirtz and I will soon be in a posi-

 Secretary Wirtz has described the current
 weeks in which  we  have  an unfortunate
 shipping strike as being crucial to the fu-
 ture of this industry.  I agree.  But I also
 want to assure you that, despite the enor-
 mous problems and despite the skeptics, we
 are moving toward the development of a
 more vigorous and versatile, a more efficient
 and competitive merchant marine.
 Our goals must be to stabilize and then
 improve our merchant fleet.
 Now any plan for improvement must be
 keyed to modernization.  We possess the
 technological know-how to send to sea the
 mechanized ships so essential to compete
 with the vessels of other nations.  By apply,
 ing our technology, we hope to cut the costs
 of building, operating, loading, and unload-
 ing our ships.  Mechanization aboard ship,
 of course, means a reduction in crews.  But
 this should not obscure the need.  For one
 thing, normal attrition already is reducing
 the seagoing work force.  We'll have to re-
 cruit additional seamen.    And for another
 thing, as we become more competitive with
 the ships flying the flags of other nations,
 and as our international trade grows, we will
 need more ships and thus more men-men.
 building In the yards and sailing on the seas.
 But isn't it the challenge of competition.
 which has made this country the most pro-
 ductive and  prosperous in the history of
 man?  Isn't it the challenge of competition
 which has enabled our system to demon-
 strate its superiority, by allowing private en-
 terprise to take risks and to exercise the
 initiative, imagination,  and  ingenuity  to
 convert risks into success?  Are we going to
 continue to be complacent about the fact
 that ships can be constructed and operated
 so much more economically by other nations,
 enabling them to take the shipping business
 away from us?
 In the maritime industry, as in any other,
 private enterprise must bear the prime re-
 sponsibilities for stability and progress.
 As It is, these burdens are shared by man-
 agement, labor, and Government.  The im-
 mediate interests of each party are not al-
 ways  identical.  Management  and   labor,
 quite naturally, are concerned with profit
 and wages. The Government's lasting obli-
 gation _ is to all Americans.  But I want to
 emphasize this point: The ultimate respon-
 sibilities.of each party, one no less than the
 other, are to the national interest.

 INFLUENCE PEDDLING?
 Privately, oilmen point to what they con-
 sider influence peddling affecting the Phillips
 decision.            They see it as significant that
 Puerto Rico was represented by the Washing-
 ton law firm of Arnold, Fortas & Porter, al-
 though Abe Fortas, a personal friend and con-
 fidant of President Johnso i, denies he had
 anything to do with it.  Oscar L. Chapman,
 an influential Democrat who was Harry S.
 Truman's Secretary of the Interior, was at-
 torney for Phillips.
 Udall's decision evoked dissension even
 within his own Department.  Assistant Sec-
 retary of the Interior John M. Kelly, an inde-
 pendent producer and Udall's top oil adviser,
 didn't see eye to eye with his boss.  Sube-
 quently, Kelly quit his post and went home
 to New Mexico.
 STATUS aEPOAT
 Despite the opposition, including threats of
 law suits by some companies, it was soon ap-
 parent that Udall would stand his ground.
 "Other companies will be a little bit un-
 happy," he says, "but I'm willing to take the
 criticism."
 Then Udall's opponents in the oil industry
 launched  their  counterattack.  The  com-
 panies that began lining up at his door with
 demands for foreign-oil-supplied complexes
 of. their own were the same that had most
 vigorously objected to the Phillips decision.
 Besides those interested in Puerto Rico, a
 sixth  company proposed  a petrochemical
 complex to be run on foreign oil in Appa-
 lachia,  The company, Borg-Warner's chem-
 ical division, Marbon, reasoned that West
 Virginia has unemployment problems, too.
 SERIOUS INTENT
 While the companies are grimly serious
 about their Puerto Rican applications, they,
 as well as Udall, realize that he cannot ap-
 prove them all without opening a wide breach
 In import controls. Thus, any company that
 has its proposal granted will be sharing rel-
 atively exclusive economic advantages.  On
 the other hand, if a? request is turned down,

 .  Thus, the Secretary, still feeling his way
 on uncharted seas, is moving with delibera-

 plan took 2 years to be approved, so there is
 no need for hurry on the rest.  Meanwhile,

 ETNA
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 in his Johns Hopkins address last April
 7, President Johnson stated his willing-
 ness to enter into unconditional nego-
 tiations with North Vietnamese officials
 seeking to end the war in Vietnam. His
 hard-nosed militarist Ambassador to
 South Vietnam at that time, Gen. Max-
 well Taylor, when asked about proposed
 unconditional negotiations, was quick to
 say that our President did not suggest
 unconditional negotiations, but only con-
 versations.  It would take a militarist
 to make the distinction between uncon-
 ditional negotiations and unconditional
 conversations to try to end a war at a
 conference table.
 Fortunately, in his recent press con-
 ference, President Johnson enlarged the
 invitation that was the high point of
 his  Baltimore speech.  He definitely
 stated our ,willingness to enter "uncon-
 ditional discussions" over. Vietnam. He
 added in his letter to United Nations
 Secretary General U Thant:
 The United States is prepared to enter
 into  negotiations  for  peaceful settlement
 without condition.
 This is significant. It takes the ground
 from under militarists and warhawks,
 many of whom favor the bombing of
 nuclear  installations  in  Red  China,
 which is capable at this time of produc-
 ing only the crudest sort of nuclear weap-
 ons.  In other words, some of our gen-
 erals and warhawk leaders of the minor-
 ity party in the House of Representatives
 appear to advocate our waging preemp-
 tive war' against Red China by destroy-
 ing that nkttion's nuclear installations.
 Furthermore, our President has stated
 explicitly that he is willing to discuss
 the four-point program of Hanoi which
 was announced last April.  In other
 words, he has come closer to the demand
 of Ho Chi Minh, the president of North
 Vietnam, who has urged "free elections
 in Vietnam."
 President Johnson, in his latest press
 conference, stated that we are willing to
 include representatives of the Vietcong
 in any negotiations and that this is not
 an insurmountable problem at all.  He
 further indicated that we are willing to
 agree to free elections in the south, or
 throughout all Vietnam, under interna-
 tional supervision and that the purposes
 of the 1954 Geneva agreement on Viet-
 nam "still guide our actions."
 Notwithstanding this, he said that the
 machinery for this was "tragically weak"
 and that these agreements were "cruelly
 shattered" by the Communists.
 The Hanoi program, announced last
 April, called for "observance by both
 sides of the military provisions of the
 1954 Geneva accord" and urged "recon-
 vening of an International conference
 along the pattern of the 1954 Geneva
 Conference."
 If this is still the position of the leaders
 of -North Vietnam, and if the Vietcong
 will select delegates to represent them
 at the conference table, it appears that
 an honorable peace or cease-fire In South
 Vietnam is well within the realm of possi-
 bility.  Without a doubt, Ambassador
 at Large, Averell Harriman has held
 some fruitful conferences in Moscow
 and elsewhere proposing a cease-fire in
 South Vietnam.  Now our President, by
 his letter to Secretary General U Thant
 and his instructions to our Ambassador
 to the United Nations, Arthur J. Gold-
 berg, has acted in a constructive manner
 toward extricating the United States
 from a commitment that was first made
 in 1954 under General Eisenhower. This
 action has proved by hindsight to be a
 mistake and this mistake has been com-
 pounded many times until now, instead
 of 2,000 men of our Armed Forces being
 involved in southeast Asia, 150,000 or
 thereabouts are involved, and many lives
 are being lost.
 Here is an opportunity for the United
 Nations to demonstrate that it is more
 than a mere debating society and that
 by exercising some initiative it can be-
 come a real peacemaking force.
 President Johnson has now made
 some modest enlargement of previous
 statements toward peace.  His state-
 18369
 ments are so clear and unequivocal that
 even militarists bent on preemptive war
 cannot distort their meaning.
 In negotiating for a withdrawal of our
 forces we are presently able to negotiate
 from strength.  If Hanoi is willing to
 have its delegates meet at a conference
 table and discuss ending this fighting
 and bloodshed on the basis of a stale-
 mate, with election of a President of
 Vietnam agreed on at an early date to
 be supervised in the manner stated, then
 there is real. hope for a cease fire, and
 peace may be just over the horizon.
 Mr. President, those Republican lead-
 ers in the House of Representatives, in-
 cluding GERALD FORD, MELVIN LAIRD, and
 others, who urge that we unleash our
 air power against all industrial plants,
 installations, and cities in North Viet-
 nam are in reality calling for all-out
 war in  southeast Asia.  This would
 bring North Vietnam and possibly Red
 China directly into the conflict, and
 could mean our involvement in a disas-
 trous land war In southeast Asia.  These
 warhawks are really opposed to uncon-
 ditional negotiations to end the war in
 South Vietnam honorably.
 To date, our bombing of North Viet-
 nam has failed to weaken the Vietcong.
 In all likelihood, increased bombing will
 only  stiffen  enemy  resistance.  Our
 military situation there has been going
 from bad to worse.  The only answer is
 a negotiated settlement involving major
 concessions by both sides which would
 offer the Communists a reasonable and
 attractive alternative to military vic-
 tory.
 President  Johnson  seems  trapped
 politically by Vietnam.  When he and
 others advocate negotiation so that we
 may withdraw our Armed Forces, the
 warhawks scream: "Appeasement. Send
 in more ground troops."  If we send in
 more ground troops, they denounce this.
 These armchair militarists say we ought
 to win the war the easy way, by all-out
 bombing, not only of Hanoi but also of
 Red Chinese nuclear installations and
 airfields.  Then,  were  thousands  of
 American boys to be killed and this Na-
 tion bogged down in 'a terrible land war
 in southeast Asia, these presently war-
 hawk Congressmen, including FORD and
 LAIRD, would next year be terming it
 "Lyndon's war."
 THE AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING

 Mr. BREWSTER.                          Mr. President, I
 have spoken several times during recent
 weeks about the sad decline of the Amer-
 ican shipbuilding industry.  The emer-
 gency in Vietnam, requiring the reactiva-
 tion of 15 ships from the mothball fleet,
 has once again pointed up this continu-
 ing and worsening problem.
 An excellent and timely article on the
 subject appeared in the Journal of Com-
 merce dated July 22 of this year.  Mr.
 President, I ask unanimous consent that
 this article be printed in the RECORD.

 SHIPPING  OUTLOOK:   U.S.  SHIPPING  TIEUP
 - LIMELIGHTS PLIGHT OF AILING SHIPBUILDING
 INDUSTRY
 (By Charles F. Davis)
 The U.S. shipping strike which has im-
 mobilized a major portion of the U.S. mer-
 chant marine could be serving a useful pur-
 pose, ugly and sordid as the situation may
 now appear. The tieup came, about over such
 relatively narrow if thorny issues as Ship-
 board automation.  Already, however, it has
 directly  or  indirectly raised some much
 broader points.    These include the purpose,
 scope and execution of the Nation's shipping
 laws and the objectives of the maritime sub-
 sidy programs.  All this needs a thorough
 airing and, hopefully, it will get it in the
 months ahead.
 The airing may well. extend beyond the
 problems of the shipping industry as such,
 into the U.S. shipbuilding Industry, for ex-
 ample, where the shipping tieup has brought
 Into sharp focus  an unhealthy state of
 NEEDED IN A HURRY
 The situation develops as a result of the
 Defense Department's decision to break out
 15 vessels from the reserve fleet to move
 military cargoes to Vietnam in lieu of com-
 mercial shipping halted by the strike.  The
 vessels are needed in a hurry and the dead-
 line on reactivating the ships has been set
 for early next month.
 Reactivating these ships, mostly World
 War II Victory-class vessels, Is a considerable
 task to undertake in such a short time but
 not one which would normally be beyond
 the capacity of shipyards.
 ,However, in at least one 'instance a New
 York yard has been forced to turn down
 some of this business because of the shortage
 of trained manpower.
 PROBLEM NOT UNIQUE
 Reports from Baltimore and other areas
 indicate that this problem is not unique to
 New York.
 The fact of the matter is that the U.S.
 shipbuilding industry, lacking new orders
 and, as a matter of policy by the Defense
 Department, allocated only a marginal share
 of naval work, is withering on the vine.
 It can't, moreover, wither much more be-
 fore It will be unable to cope with the rou-
 tine requirements of the  ,S. shipbuilding
 industry much less an emergency situation
 such as has been brought about by the strike.
 A score of yards have gone out of business
 in the past decade and a number of big fa-
 cilities owned by major shipbuilding firms
 have been closed because of a lack .of busi-
 ness.
 The shrinkage of the industry has brought
 with it a shrinkage of trained and skilled
 Workers who, laid off or unwilling to con-
 tinue In a precarious employment, have
 turned to other trades.
 PART AND PARCEL
 Thus, it is all too apparent that the plight
 of the U.S. shipbuilding industry is part and
 parcel of the whole problem of the maritime
 industry.
 We submit, therefore, that this should be
 considered in any realistic appraisal of forth-
 eoming construction programs, immediate or
 long range.
 It certainly puts a new light on any pro-
 posal to build American-flag shipping in for-
 sign- yards, naval or commercial.
 It miglit well be also considered in terms
 of,the Navy's parsimonious assignment of re-
 pafr work on naval vessels to private indus-
 try in favor of naval yards.
 In sum, the work capacity of American
 shipbuilders is a vital part of the entire U.S.
 maritime picture- and any realistic program
 aimed at restoring the maritime Industry's
 health should be drawn up with this in
 mind.
 Mr. BREWSTER.  Mr. President, on
 the same subject, an editorial appeared
 in the July 30, 1985, issue of Life maga-
 zine. The editorial discusses the present
 strike in the maritime industry. I do not
 wish to assess blame or take sides in the
 strike.  I do wish to emphasize the
 problem we have in the American mer-
 chant marine industry and that some-
 thing must be done.  American tax-
 payers have hundreds of millions of dol-
 lars invested in ships which are tied up
 at the same time that cargoes are being
 carried on foreign-flag ships because
 American ships cannot carry them, and
 also U.S. ships are flying foreign flags.
 The editorial states:
 No new maritime policy will make sense
 until Washington solves this problem.
 I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
 torial be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From Life magazine, July 30, 1965]
 SINK OR ,.SWIM FOR U.S. SHIPS
 The U.S. Government pays out some $350
 million a year to subsidize a U.S.-flag, U.S.-
 built merchant marine.  But when the De-
 fense  Department needed to expand its
 military shipments to Vietnam it had to hire
 British and Danish vessels for some ship-
 ments and then to mobilize some 30 U.S.
 ships. The reason for this costly humiliation
 of a traditionally great maritime nation was
 that most of our best cargo vessels have been
 tied up for nearly 6 weeks in one of the
 industry's perennial strikes.
 This one, kept going by the Marine En-
 gineers'  Beneficial  Association,  has  been
 termed "intolerable" and "against the pub-
 lic interest" by the Secretary of Commerce.
 Since U.S: taxpayers already get up 72 cents
 of every maritime wage dollar, and would
 normally pay 100 percent of any increase, he
 can say that "public interest" again.
 MEBA represents  16,000 seagoing engi-
 neers who already average $1,500 a month.
 It is known as the "head-kicking union" be-
 cause at one session its president, Jesse Cal-
 hoon, was charged with jumping on the ne-
 gotiating table and kicking a shipper in the
 jaw.  Negotiations have since broken down,
 the tough issues being retirement income
 and automation.  The owners have also lost
 confidence in the arbitrator but are willing
 to arbitrate almost, anything under a new
 one,  including  any  appointee  of  George
 Meany's. MEBA says no.
 Joe Curran       of  the  National Maritime
 Union, a third of whose sailors have been
 beached by it, calls this "a political strike"
 and "a threat to all other workers in the
 maritime industry.   Curran is gored be-
 cause the strike plays into the hands and
 treasury  of  the    Seafarer's  International
 Union, which means unsubsidized tramps
 and liners and whose chief, Paul Hall, has
 been Curran's bitter rival for many years.
 The fact that only part of the maritime In-
 dustry is shut down also prevents the Gov-
 ernment  from  invoking  a  Taft-Hartley
 emergency and sending the engineers back
 to work.
 Chronic interunion feuding, extravagant
 demands, and ruthless tactics have cost the
 maritime industry 10  million man-hours
 since World War II.  The subsidy formula,
 which offsets the fact that U.S. wage costs
 are three to four times foreign costs, has
 hitherto floated of the exorbitant settle-
 ments.  But not this time.  This strike co-
 incides with a more general crisis in the
 U.S. merchant marine.
 President Johnson promised last January
 to introduce a whole new maritime policy to
 replace the 1936 system.  His lively young
 Maritime  Administartor,  Nicholas  John-
 son, has not only been scaring the unions
 and owners alike with boyish speeches but
 has threatened to keep new wage increases
 out of the subsidy formula and even dis-
 allow increases of several years past.                                                                                                                                      U.S.
 shipowners, both struck and unstruck, are
 therefore fighting for their lives against ris-
 ing costs, foreign competition, and uncer-
 tain Government policy.  By tonnage, U.S.
 shipping's share of U.S. foreign trade has
 fallen from 50 percent to 9 percent since
 1945.  Large parts of the fleet have been
 scuttling to Liberian and Panamanian reg-
 istry or counting their last days as eldering
 tramps carrying giveaway "food for peace"
 at subsidized rates.  The U.S. maritime pic-
 ture                                                                                                                                  is  gloomy  indeed-except  in  one
 respect.
 The authors of our 1936 subsidy policy,
 chiefly F.D.R. and Joseph P. Kennedy, knew
 what they were about.    They wanted a first-
 class, liner-type cargo fleet sailing established
 routes-and thatwe have.  It is second only
 to the British in size; in quality, second to
 none.  The  15  leading  U.S.  lines  (Grace,
 Lykes. Moore-McCormack,       United   States
 Lines, etc.) run their 300 vessels on a subsidy
 contract which requires them to keep their
 fleets modern; as a result, 80 percent of all
 cargo vessels in the world capable of more
 than 20 knots fly the U.S. flag.  If U.S. fcr-
 eign trade is measured by value instead of
 by tonnage, U.S. ships carry 37 percent of it.
 Nicholas Johnson would like to see  tae
 Government out of the shipping business
 eventually.  He sees no future in passenger
 subsidies and would cut cargo subsidies by
 relying on improved productivity through
 technological change, including such futt r-
 istic carriers as undersea pipelines and hy-
 drofoils.
 Undoubtedly great technological improve-
 ments lie ahead of ocean shipping, the most
 realistic being specialized bulk cargo ships.
 The industry Itself has ordered 35 new "au-
 tomated" freighters.  But much of their au-
 tomation is in the engine room, and ME13A
 refuses to agree to any fixed manning sched-
 ules in advance.  This puts all savings from
 automation in doubt-the more so since any
 maritime labor settlement is subject to later
 interunion whipsawing.
 Some owners have suggested a "czar" to
 save their industry from further strife and
 stalemate.  Czars  seldom  solve  anything,
 but this one might provide what U.S. ship-
 ping desperately needs, a period of labor
 peace while it adjusts to the throes of tech-
 nological change.                                                                                                                                             No new maritime policy
 will make sense until Washington solves this
 problem.  The jobs at risk from automation
 will either expand with an expanding indus-
 try or sink with-a dead one.

 had requested. I ask unanimous consent
 that the nine avenues of honorable ne-
 gotiations offered by the President of
 the United States in, that speech and
 the press conference that followed be
 included at this point'in the RECORD and,
 that they be differentiated one from an-
 other, either through the use of asterisks
 or through the use of numbers.
 I make this request because I think the
 President has,just about covered every
 conceivable possiblity in seeking to bring
 about a negotiated settlement of the
 situation now existing in South Vietnam
 and it ought to be clear that he has.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Once the Communists know, as we know,
 that a violent solution is impossible, then a
 peaceful solution  is  inevitable.  We are
 ready now, as we have always been, to move
 from the battlefield to the conference table.
 I have stated publicly and many times,
 again and again, America's willingness to be-
 gin unconditional discussions with any gov-
 ernment at any place at any time.
 Fifteen efforts have been made to start
 these discussions, with the help of 40 na-
 tions throughout the world.  But there has
 been nq answer,  But We are going to con-
 tinue to persist, if persist we must, until
 death and desolation have led to the same
 conference table where others could now join
 us at a much smaller cost.
 2
 I have spoken many times of our objec-
 tives in Vietnam.                 So has the Government
 of South Vietnam.  Harlot has set forth its
 own proposals. We are ready to discuss their
 proposals and our proposals and any pro-
 posals of any government whose people may
 be affected, for we fear the meeting room no
 more than we fear the battlefield.  And in
 this pursuit we welcome and we ask for the
 concern and the assistance of any nation and
 all nations.
 s
 And if the United Nations and its officials
 or any one of its 114 members can by deed or
 word, private initiative or public action,
 bring us nearer an honorable peace, then
 they will have the support and gratitude of
 the United States of America.
 4
 I've directed Ambassador Goldberg to go to
 New York today and to present immediately
 to Secretary General U Thant a letter from
 me requesting that all the resources, and
 the energy and the immense prestige of
 the United Nations be employed to find ways
 to halt aggression and to bring peace in
 Vietnam.
 a .
 But we insist and we will always insist
 that the people of South Vietnam shall have
 the right of choice, the right to shape their
 own destiny in free elections in the South
 or throughout all Vietnailr under interna-
 tional supervision, and they shall not have
 any government imposed upon them by force
 and terror so long as we can prevent it.

 As I just said, I hope that every member
 of the United Nations that has any idea or
 any plan, any program, any suggestion, that
 they will not let them go unexplored.
 And as I have said so many times, if any-
 one questions our good faith and will ask us
 to meet them to try to reason this matter
 out, they will find us at the appointed place,

 possibility that might lead to a solution of
 this matter.  In my letter to the Secretary
 General this morning  which  Ambassador
 Goldberg will deliver later in the day, I re-
 iterate my hopes and my desires and I urge
 upon him that he-if he agrees-that he
 undertake new efforts in this direction.
 Ambassador  Goldberg  understands the
 challenge.  We spent the weekend talking
 about the potentialities and the possibilities,
 our hopes and our dreams, and I believe that
 we will have an able advocate and a search-
 ing negotiator who, I would hope could some
 day find success.

 We have stated time and time again that
 we would negotiate with any Government,
 any time, any place.  The Vietcong would
 have no difficulty in being represented and
 having their views presented if Hanoi for a
 moment decides that she wants to cease ag-
 gression, and I would not think that would
 be an insurmountable problem at all. I think
 that could be worked out.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I commend the
 President for the frankness he has
 shown In publicly making these pro-
 posals.  I only hope that those who are
 interested in peace, who have eyes to see,
 who have ears to hear, and who can rec-
 ognize print when they see it will take in-
 to consideration the nine choices, some
 of them cumulative, which have been
 offered by the President of the United
 States to the peoples of the world in seek-
 ing to bring about an honorable conclu-
 sion through negotiations to this most
 complicated conflict.

 PRINCIPLES
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, last
 week, speaking of the reapportionment
 proposals  now before the Senate, I
 stated:
 If the majority of the people of any State
 decide that the majority shall each have less
 than one vote in the selection of the mem-
 bers of one of the bodies of their State leg-
 islature, it is my firm conviction that they
 should be permitted so to decide.. ,
 Writing in the Washington Star last
 night, August 2, 1965, in a column en-
 titled "Dirksen's Apportionment Plan,"
 James J. Kilpatrick thoughtfully and
 clearly set forth a point-by-point analy-
 sis of Senator DIRKSEN's reapportionment
 amendment, stressing that it "is founded
 surely and squarely upon the oldest prin-
 ciples of republican government."
 I ask unanimous consent that the arti-
 cle by James J. Kilpatrick in the Wash-
 ington Star for August 2, 1965, entitled
 "Dirksen's  Apportionment  Plan"  be
 printed in the RECORD at the conclusion

 There being no objection, the article

 DIRKSEN'S APPORTIONMENT PLAN
 (By James J. Kilpatrick)
 It is one of those marvelous ironies of
 parliamentary life, that the merits of Ev-
 ERETT M. DIRKSEN's amendment may yet be
 obscured by the radiance of his charm.
 The venerable senior Senator from Illinois
 is struggling to win approval of a profoundly
 significant resolution, intended to preserve
 one of the great principles of American gov-
 ernment; but the DiRKSEN enchantment is
 such that he might almost as well be speak-
 ing of his choice of the marigold to become
 the national flower.
 Which is to say that not many of the Sen-
 ator's friends or foes seem actually to have
 read what he proposes.  They are enraptured,
 ensorcelled, overcome with delight.
 In the past few months, DIaKSEN suddenly
 has emerged as an American institution, to
 be ranked in the Nation's affections some-
 where between Jimmy Durante and Casey
 Stengel. ' *
 As a consequence, people are not writing
 about DIRKSEN's resolution; they are writing
 about DIRKSEN's style. It is a terrible tempt-
 ation.                                                                                                                            If the Senate has been long on abil-
 ity in recent years, it has  been woefully
 short on color.  Now, after all these years,
 recognition has dawned that in  DIRKSEN,
 some genuine color has returned. And we
 correspondents knock ourselves out to cap-
 ture the charm of the guy; the face that looks
 as if he had slept in 1t; the rumpled hair,
 like an old Brillo pad; the rolling eye, the
 eloquent hand, the sepulchral  voice that
 sadly sighs at the insensitivity of his Demo-
 cratic friends.
 But he can't get the Senate's attention.
 The assumption is that his reapportion-
 ment resolution would "thwart the Supreme
 Court," or "nullify democracy."  About the
 most that ever is said is that the Dirksen
 resolution, if it were added by amendment
 to the Constitution, would permit the States
 to apportion seats in one house of their legis-
 latures by factors other than population.
 There is much more than this to the Dirk-
 sen proposal.  It begins with that great and
 forgotten noun with which the Constitution
 itself  begins-the  noun  that  recurs  four
 times in the Bill of Rights.  "The people," it
 begins.
 "The people of a State may apportion one
 house of a bicameral legislature using popu-
 lation, geography, or political subdivisions
 as factors, giving each factor such weight
 as they deem appropriate." Here DIRKSEN is
 reaching to the very roots of sovereignty, to
 the people themselves.  He would let them
 decide.
 In the next phrase, he echoes the words.
 Before such a plan of apportionment could
 be adopted, it must have been submitted "to
 a vote of the people and approved by a ma-
 jority of those voting on the issue."  But
 this is not the only safeguard: When such a
 plan of apportionment is submitted to a
 vote  of  the  people,  "there  shall  also be
 submitted, at the same election, an alterna-
 tive plan of apportionment based upon sub-
 stantial equality of population."
 What could be fairer?  This was precisely
 what was done in Colorado, where the people
 twice rejected by overwhelming margins the
 bogus "democracy" one man, one vote.
 The people are capable, DIEKSEN is saying,
 of deciding their own destinies better than
 the Supreme Court is capable of deciding for
 them.
 Yet the Dirksen proposal has still one ad-
 ditional..safeguard.  The indefensible mal-
 apportionments of recent years cannot be

 permitted to recur, even in one chamber, as
 q consequence of one decision, Shoe made.
 Every 10 years, any apportionment plan
 based on considerations other than popula-
 tion "shall be resubmitted to a vote of the
 people."  There must be a continuing re-
 newal of the people's consent to be governed
 by legislators of their own choosing, and not
 by "King Numbers."
 This is what the Dirksen amendment pro-
 vides.              It is founded surely and squarely
 upon the oldest principles of republican
 government.  We ought not to become so
 mesmerized by the Senator's parliamentary
 skill and by his beautiful basson voice that
 we fall to heed what the Senator says.
 STOP TIGHT MONEY-END THE RE-
 STRICTIVE  MONEY POLICY  OF
 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD
 Mx. HARTEE. Mr. President, last
 week, business loans of the leading New
 York banks fell for the fourth straight
 week.  The decline since the 1st of July
 has now reached $394 million. Mere is
 proof positive of the tight money policy
 of the Federal Reserve System in action.
 `Three months ago, the Federal Reserve
 moved to place our banking system in a
 negative reserve position.  The result for
 the last 3, months has been an average
 weekly reserve position of minus $150
 million to $175 million. Sooner or later,
 as I and my distinguished colleague, the
 Senator from Minnesota [Mr. McCAR-
 Tsyl, have consistently warned, this
 pressure bti the banks would bring pres-
 sure to bear on business.  Furthermore,
 the Johnson administration's basic fiscal
 policy-which looks to an expanding
 economy which can produce higher tax
 revenues at lower tax rates-is being
 placed in jeopardy.
 I conferred with the Senator from
 Minnesota [Mr. MCCARTHY], and It is
 with his entire concurrence that we call
 for a reversal of the Federal Reserve's
 tight money policy.
 Dining the past month, it has become
 the::stated policy of the U.S. Govern-
 ment- ddciared so by Treasury Secretary
 Fowler-to work toward expansion of the
 International money supply by reforming
 the intentional monetary _system.  Soon
 it will be possible for this policy to be
 translated into progressive and enlight-
 ened action.  But this policy will be
 meaningless, this action will be ineffec-
 tive-If it Is not based upon a soundly and
 continuously expanding American econ-
 omy.              It is now time for the funda-
 mental and forward-looking revision of
 international  monetary  policy  an-
 nounced by Secretary Fowler to be ac-
 companied by a similar revision of do-
 mestic monetary policy by the Federal
 Reserve.
 The foundation that exists today for a
 continued expansion of economic activity
 Is unprecedented-and should be unques-
 tioned.  But questions will continue to be
 asked, both at home and abroad, until
 all branches of the American Govern-
 ment agree in deed as well as in word
 that American prosperity is the No. 1 pre-
 requisite for world prosperity.  In order
 that this agreement may be made known
 to all the world, I once again call upon
 the Federal Reserve to end Its tight
 money policy before a squeeze on money
 becomes a squeeze on activity, profits,
 and jobs.
 THE GROWING DANGER OF OUR
 CONTINUING UNFAVORABLE BAL-
 ANCE OF PAYMENTS
 Mr.  SYMINGTON.  Mr.  President,
 back in 1963, in a series of five Senate
 talks, I presented my growing apprehen-
 sion about the continuing unfavorable
 balance of payments.
 Since then there has been increased
 discussion of this subject along, with Its
 relation to such program as first, off-
 shore military  expenditures;  second,
 tourism; third, private investment and
 lending abroad; and fourth, foreign aid.
 Some years ago the two nations rep-
 resenting the two power centers of East
 and West achieved what might be termed
 a "'nuclear standoff"; a position that has
 been described in various ways: "Bal-
 ance of terror," "two scorpions in a bot-
 tle," and so forth; and since then it has
 become increasingly clear that total vic-
 tory, as known in the past, would be im-
 possible in any future all-out war.
 There is a sphere in which this Na-
 tion could suffer total defeat; and that
 is in the economic field.
 For over 100 years various Communist
 leaders, especially Lenin, have pointed
 to that possibility; and I believe it could
 become more than a possibility if we do
 not face up to all the implications of
 this continuing unfavorable balance of
 payments.
 This thinking has brought an in-
 creased interest in reassessment of our
 foreign economic policies; and it Is based
 on that interest that I now present these
 thoughts.
 With the sole exception of 1957, the
 United States has been running con-
 sistent balance-of-payments deficits for
 15 years-since 1950.
 Starting with 1958, these deficits be-
 came disturbingly large-and remained
 at a $3 to $4 billion level through
 the 1958-64 period.
 As a result, the Nation's gold supply
 has dwindled some $10 billion. Our gold
 stock now stands at less than $14 bil-
 lion with our current liabilities to for-
 eigners, redeemable in gold, totaling
 over $28 billion-more than twice the
 volume of our gold stock.  That stock
 is now lower than it has been since
 August 1938.
 Recently there has been a flurry of
 publicity that, as a result of voluntary
 actions, the balance-of-payments deficit
 is now licked. Any jubilation Is prema-
 ture.                                                              The President, In his press con-
 ference of July 9, was wise in caution,
 as evidenced by the following colloquy.
 Question. Are the reports, sir, that the
 balance-of-payments deficit is wiped out in
 the last 3 months true, and, if so, what
 about some worry among economists that
 It will hurt the economy of Europe, that they
 will not  have  the dollars that  they had
 before?
 Answer. The reports I have read are high-
 ly inaccurate.                                                          They cannot be confirmed.
 We do not have the exact information.
 I asked the Secretary of the Treasury to
 give me even his speculation.  He refused
 to do that yesterday.  After I read the wire
 service stories and stories in other periodicals,
 I asked the Chairman of the Economic Ad-
 visers, the Secretary of Commerce, and the
 Secretary of the Treasury.
 All of-them were unfamiliar with it. They
 said that the only thing they could say
 was that  it was premature, it was inac-
 curate and undependable as far as the infcr-
 mation to the President is concerned.
 Now, in the days ahead, they may be exact-
 ly on the nose, but they are unwilling to
 say that in their position today, even to
 me, or to the task forces.
 How long can this development con-
 tinue before the dollar is forced into de-
 valuation?
 The answer is clear-not very long.
 There are those who ask about the im-
 portance of a $3 billion deficit in an econ-
 omy where the gross national product
 approaches $650 billion; and ask also of
 what real relevance is a foreign aid pack-
 age of $5.7 billion.  In this connection,
 the 1966 fiscal year request for foreign
 aid was $780 million for development
 loans; $210 million for technical co-
 operation and development grants; $580
 million for Alliance for Progress; $369
 million for supporting assistance; $271
 -million for contingency fund; $206 mil-
 lion for the Inter-American Development
 Bank; $500 million for the fund for
 special operations of the IDB; $104 mil-
 lion- for the IDA, the soft loan window of
 the World Bank; $125 million for the
 Peace Corps; $1,658 million for foodfor
 peace; and $1,170 million for military
 assistance.
 The answer is that our ability to con-
 tinue our policies of lending and giving
 away financial resources is dependent
 upon first, the size of our gold stock;
 second, our net annual foreign earnings;
 and,  third,  liquid  short-term  assets
 abroad, less our - short-term liabilities to
 foreign holders.  It is not dependent on
 either our income, or our assets, in the
 United States.
 Any continuation of a $3 billion deficit
 in our international accounts can only
 mean that we will not be able to under-
 take much of the planned foreign aid
 and military  expenditures programs.
 Actually, and as I have presented previ-
 ously, we are already borrowing from
 foreign countries in order to carry out
 aid and military programs for these for-
 eign countries.
 If we continue in this fashion, there
 is real danger of a forced devaluation of
 the dollar; and this could well set off
 a chain reaction of diminished world
 trade and serious domestic recession if
 not actual depression.
 With respect to foreign aid, never in
 history has any nation so willingly
 opened its purse to so many for so long.
 In the early post-war period, we re-
 sponded wholeheartedly to the needs of
 economic reconstruction, pumping bil-
 lions of dollars into European and Japa-
 nese recovery. Of the $64.5 billion in net
 foreign  assistance  provided  between
 July 1, 1945, and December 31, 1957,
 $53.8 billion, or 83.4 percent, was in the
 form of nonrepayable grants.   Only $9
 billion was in long-term, low-interest
 credits, the rest being in sales of com-
 modities under agricultural surplus dis-
 posal programs.
 Of the total $53.8 billion in foreign
 military and economic grants during this

 Mr. THURMOND._? Mr. President, one
 of the best editorial commentaries I have
 seen on the President's address of July
 28, 1965,  to  the  Nation  on U.S.
 policies in Vietnam has been printed in
 the Greenville News, of Greenville, S.C.
 The editorial is entitled "LBJ Left
 Much To Be Desired" and was printed in
 the July 29, 1965, issue of the Greenville
 News.
 I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi-
 dent, that this editorial be printed in
 the RECORD at the conclusion of these
 remarks together with my newsletter
 dated  August  2,  1965,  and  entitled
 "Prospects in Southeast Asia."
 There being no objection, the editorial
 ,,.,kand newsletter  were ordered  to  be
 printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Greenville News, July 29, 1965]
 LBJ LEFT MUCH To BE DESIRED
 President Johnson's address to the Nation
 and the world at his press conference yester-
 day on the administration's "new" plans for
 prosecuting the war in Vietnam left much to
 be desired on the part of American families
 directly affected and those who, as a matter
 of national policy and welfare, hoped for a
 definition of plans for victory.
 It did not help at all in this respect for
 the President to turn from his rather general
 and even vague discussion of American battle
 plans and goals in Vietnam to his hopes for
 further extension of the benefits of the
 Great Society.
 is folksy personal references and his
 declaration that he did not intend to see
 the hopes and dreams of the people swept
 away by war fell flat.
 And against this backdrop his announce-
 ment of the appointment of John Chancellor
 df NBC to head up the Voice of America
 and of Abe Portas to succeed Arthur Gold-
 berg on the U.S. Supreme Court was sadly
 out of place.
 On the one hand the President flatly stated,
 for the first time so far as we can recall,
 that the conflict in southeast Asia is -a war
 between freedom and communism.
 But on the other he said no declaration
 of war was needed because the Chief Ex-
 ecutive had ample authority to do what had
 been done up to now and that he had been
 in constant consultation with the Congress
 and had received unstinting cooperation and
 support.
 "This is war" Mr. Johnzon said, and the
 United States positively will not surrender
 or retreat, for that way lies hopeless disaster
 and an invitation to further Red aggression
 in Asia and elsewhere.
 But the President did.not speak of victory
 as the goal of that war.
 Instead, he digressed to declare that the
 United States not only intended to help the
 South Vietnamese to reach the point where
 they could set up their own government with
 free elections; it also will render economic
 assistance on a large scale.
 Mr. Johnson announced that large num-
 bers of additional troops will be sent to Viet-
 nam, including specific units ranging from
 special battalions up to the new "Air Mobile"
 infantry division.
 This outfit has been formed only this
 summer by taking crack units from the Na-
 tio's eomb4.t-ready divisions and training
 and, equipping them to Inove entirely by air-
 going into battle in planes, helicopters and
 by parachute-drop.
 But he said there were at present no plans
 for calling up reserve units or individual
 reservists, although recruiting efforts and the
 draft will be stepped up.
 The President Said he had asked Gen.
 Wil'.am  Westmoreland,  the  South  Caro-
 linian in' command of all American forces in
 Vietnam what he needed to do the job as-
 signed to him, although the General's mis-
 sion has not been clearly defined to the pub-
 lic's satisfaction, and these forces and the
 necessary equipment were going to be sup-
 plied.
 In his formal address  the President de-
 fined the American goal in Vietnam as a lim-
 ited one, although he didn't call it that.
 The purpose, he said, is to convince the Com-
 munists they cannot win, or rather that the
 United States cannot be defeated, by mili-
 ary force alone.  The idea is to force the
 Reds to the conference table.
 But he did not say American forces would
 be turned loose to do what is necessary to
 convince the enemy of this fact by inflicting
 on him a thorough defeat in and from the
 air and on the ground.
 In his speech and in answer to questions,
 he emphasized that escalation of the war, es-
 pecially a direct confrontation with the go-
 viets and the Chinese Communists, will be
 avoided if possible.   More significantly  he
 said  that  the  policy  of having   American
 troops  serve primarily  as  advisers  to  the
 South Vietnamese, rather than taking over
 and running the war themselves, would not
 be changed.
 He made no reference at all to the commit-
 tal of larger air and naval forces to stepped
 up air and coastal raids on the Vietcong
 training centers and supply bases in North
 Vietnam.
 This is the crux of the matter.  The United
 States is committing more troops to the con-
 fined battle area of South Vietnam.  Their
 mission, presumably, is to make the war so
 costly to the Vietcong that they, instead of
 the South Vietnamese and the United States,
 will give up and ask for peace talks.
 But the tactical and strategic problems of
 maneuvering such a force against the Com-
 munist guerrillas effectively on a battlefield
 and in tactical situations created by the Viet-
 cong are staggering.  It is hard to see more
 than a stalemate, at best, as possible in a
 war fought under such conditions.
 Perhaps the President has Issued orders he
 did not disclose for security reasons, but his
 emphasis on hopes for bringing "peace with
 honor" by negotiating with the Communists,
 hopefully with the full assistance of the
 United Nations, indicates the contrary. And
 he conceded that the war could continue
 indefinitely.
 Mr. Johnson emphasized the importance
 of the war, and none can deny it.  But the
 apparent limitations on goals and tactics
 are not in keeping with the gravity of the
 situation.
 Mr. Johnson emphasized the impor-
 tance of the war, and none cany deny it.
 But the apparent limitations on goals and
 tactics are not in keeping with the grav-
 ity of the situation.
 [From weekly newsletter by Senator STaoM
 THURMOND, Republican, of South Carolina,
 Aug. 2, 1965 ]
 PROSPECTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 The President's announced steps to meet
 the crisis in Vietnam were significant.  Even
 more significant, however, was his statement
 of U.S. objectives in southeast Asia, for these
 objectives provide the basis from which the
 prospects for the war can be measured.
 Initially, the President rejected the alter-
 native of surrender.  He wisely pointed out
 that surrender would not bring peace, for
 "success only feeds the appetite of aggres-
 sion."
 Therefore, the President said, "We intend
 to convince the Communists that we cannot
 be defeated by force of arms or by superior
 power."  There can be little doubt that the
 United States can, by committing large num-
 bers of military personnel, avoid total mili-
 tary defeat in southeast Asia.  Conceivably,
 we can occupy strong points in South Viet-
 nam for decades, although the cost in casual-
 ties and resources may well be high.
 Next, the President said, "We are ready
 now, as we have always been, to move from
 the battlefield to the conference table."
 The prospects for negotiations appear un-
 likely.  North Vietnam has rejected out of
 hand all overtures advanced by the United
 States and by other nations.  Red China has
 shown an equal unwillingness to negotiate.
 Some hope that the Soviet Union will as-
 sist in bringing about negotiations.  Realis-
 tically, this too appears most unlikely.      The
 Soviets have much to gain from U.S. Involve-
 ment in a ground war in Asia.  Against an
 essentially guerrilla-type offensive, the United
 States  must confront the enemy with an
 overwhelming numerical superiority in an
 area 10,000 miles from the United States.  In
 this area, the Communists have almost un-
 limited manpower in adjacent areas, and
 supplies from all the Communist nations.
 Largely unknown to the public, the United
 States is already faced with a very serious
 and severe shortage of equipment essential
 to fight this type of war.  Major resources
 will have to be committed as the war con-
 tinues.  The Soviets can also logically reason
 that the requirements for financing a ground
 war in Asia will cause the United States to
 increasingly divert resources away from its
 strategic  military  forces,  which  is  the
 nemesis of Soviet expansion plans.   In ad-
 dition, the Soviets could and probably do
 reason that U.S. involvement in a ground
 war in Asia would make us less capable and
 less willing to respond vigorously to Soviet
 expansion efforts  in other areas, such as
 Africa and Latin America.
 It is unrealistic to believe that the Soviets
 would assist in bringing about negotiations
 which would end the conflict.  Indeed, they
 are  now supplying the Communist forces
 with equipment and supplies, including mis-
 siles, in order to assure that the Communist
 aggression can be sustained.   The one ma-
 jor world power who has most to gain from
 a major U.S. ground war in Asia is not the
 United States nor Red China, but the Soviet
 Union.
 In any negotiations the President stated
 that the United States would insist that the
 people of South Vietnam shall have "the right
 to  shape their own destiny in free elections
 in the south."  The 1954 Geneva accord spe-
 cified that elections would be held in Vietnam
 in 1956.  The elections were never held, be-
 cause it was obvious that the Communists,
 through the use of terror and intimidation,
 could win any election.  In 1956, the Gov-
 ernment controlled 70 percent of the terri-
 tory;  now, the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment and the United States control less than
 20 percent of the territory.  The fact is, we
 could not even hope to win an election in
 South Vietnam.  If we are negotiated out,
 even under the guise of free elections, we will
 lose Asia just as surely as if we pull out now;
 and the casualties we incur in the meantime
 will have been fought for naught.
 To win the war in Vietnam, it would be
 necessary to bring to bear our real power ad-
 vantage-air and sea power.  It may also re-
 quire that we use troops from the Philip-
 pines, Korea, and Nationalist China.  Such
 actions would involve a risk of confronta-
 tion  with  all  communism, including the
 Soviets.
 In the final analysis, however, there is no
 realistic middle ground. We must either ap-
 ply our power to win the war or get out,
 either now by surrendering, or later, after
 more  casualties,  through  negotiations,  if
 they ever come to pass. We cannot escape
 the immutable truth of General MacArthur's
 warning, "There is no substitute for victory."

 ney, Australia, writing in the August 4,
 1965, issue of the Christian Century
 under the title "An Australian Looks at
 Vietnam," states:
 The world outside the contending powers
 pleads: In the name of humanity, in the
 name of God, stop. before it is too late.
 Turn from the battlefield to the conference
 table.  Take risks for peace rather than
 continue the risks of war.  Accept military
 disengagement now.
 I echo his sentiments. I have ex-
 pressed these views for a year and a half
 on the floor of the Senate and elsewhere.
 I reiterate the pleas of many here in
 the United States for a cessation of the
 est lation of the undeclared war in Viet-
 naln before it is too late.
 The Reverend Walker's words should
 be heeded by all who would urge a fur-
 ther military buildup of armed might
 there. I ask unanimous consent that the
 Reverend Alan Walker's article in the
 Christian Century for August 4, 1965,
 be printed in the RECORD at the conclu-
 sion of my remarks.
 The same issue of the same periodical
 contained a thoughtful and thought-
 provoking editorial entitled "Runaway
 War or Deadlocked Peace" in which the
 options facing not only the major powers
 of the world but the world itself. The
 editorial concludes with the question:
 Will American Christians and Jews and
 and all other men of good will have the
 maturity and the energy to compel their
 government to choose those next steps which
 could lead from the brink of runaway war
 to the long hard pull that-the best we can
 hope for-is the deadlock of a peace in which
 neither side has victory and  neither is
 destroyed?
 Without such maturity and without
 such energy to persuade this adminis-
 tration to turn from the paths of war
 to the paths of peace, the dangers of a
 future thermonuclear devastation clearly
 lies ahead.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 editorial also be printed at the conclu-
 sion of my remarks.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 HOW STAY THE CONFLICT?
 There are three ways by which the war in
 Vietnam can be halted.   One is by a full-
 scale American military effort aimed at im-
 posing peace through victory.  But the price
 would probably be war with China, certainly
 a yearsiong policing by the United States
 of a Pained and an  embittered Vietnam,
 north and south.  Another way is by ne-
 gotiation.  That way fie difficulties, as the
 cool reception met in Asia by the Common-
 wealth nations'  peace                                                                          mission  indicates.
 Certainly if peace is to come through ne-
 gotiation there must be a new spirit in
 Hanoi and terms more specific than "uncon-
 ditional   negotiations"  from                                                                            Washington.
 But the struggle for negotiated settlement
 must go on; peacemakers must not permit
 their patience to be exhausted by rebuffs.
 The third way to halt the move toward
 disaster is for the United States to accept
 the Geneva Accords of 1954 and withdraw its
 armed forces from Vietnam.  Surely America
 does not need to prove its opposition to
 communism by prosecuting an unnecessary
 war, a war condemned by great segments of
 the world's people and opposed by atleast
 40 percent of its own citizens.  Surely with-
 drawal would be preferable to continuance
 of the agony of the Vietnamese people, to
 great power confrontation leading to nuclear
 catastrophe.  The world outside the con-
 tending powers  pleads:                                                                            In  the  name  of
 humanity, in the name of God, stop before
 it is too late. Turn from the battlefield to
 the conference table.  Take risks for peace
 rather than continue the risks of war. Ac-
 cept military disengagement now!
 A WAR IMMORAL, UNJUSTIFIED
 Disengagement as a prelude to peace in
 Vietnam is imperative.  For one thing, the
 conflict there is immoral and unjustified.
 All war, says the Christian judgment, is in-
 compatible with the mind of Christ.  And
 this war is to a greater extent than most
 wars indefensible.
 Vietnam has become a cockpit for the
 cold war.  Behind North Vietnam and the
 Vietcong  in  the  south stands  the Com-
 munist world;  behind the South Vietnam
 Government, the West.    Competition for in-
 fluence, desire to impress neighboring states,
 a test of will-these are the vital elements
 in the conflict. The United States and now
 my own country are committed in Vietnam

 of Churches has said: "The effort to solve      idea that others' lives and lands may be

 economic justice.  By the time the United
 States managed to "defeat" communism by
 military force, the peninsula would be a
 bloody shambles.   Where then could a gov-
 ernment be found that would be accepted
 by the people?     The United States Would
 have to buttress some sort of puppet gov-
 ernment for years on end.
 How can a war be justified that is em-
 barked upon unilaterally by nations that at
 the same time are pledged to work thrcugh
 the United Nations?  The United States has
 long contributed to the Ineffectiveness of the
 world body by its irrational insistence on
 the exclusion of mainland China.  Now it is
 further undermining its effectiveess by tak-
 ing unilateral action without seeking com-
 bined  world  action  through  the  United
 Nations.
 All this has made millions of men of good
 will throughout the world uneasy in con-
 science; they know in their hearts that the
 war in Vietnam is basically immoral and
 without justification.
 INTOLERABLE SUFFERING OF A PEOPLE:
 It is almost impossible to estimate Viet-
 namese loyalties accurately.  That military
 governments can "represent" any people is
 questionable, and the present Government of
 South Vietnam is a military despotism, as
 were  the  eight  regimes  that preceded  it
 through the past 20 months. Certainly the
 strength of the South Vietnam armed forces
 and their persistence despite huge casualties
 testify that a large body of opinion is op-
 posed to the Vietcong.                                                                                                                                               Yet it is hard to
 believe that the Vietcong could exert virtual
 control over about half the country without
 the collaboration of people from village and
 countryside.   Neutral observers--the Com-
 mission of the Churches on International
 Affairs for one--report that there is among
 the Vietnamese a deep-seated desire to be
 independent.   Certainly there is no doubt
 that the suffering of the people is deep
 and tragic.  It has lasted for 19 long years.
 Terrorized by action both sides, subjected
 to atrocities, sniped at in the jungles, bombed
 from the air, decimated by the dread napalm
 bomb, one of the most hideous weapons yet
 devised, the Vietnamese see no end to their
 miseries.   For  the  Communist  and  the
 Western nations to prolong their suffering is
 iniquitous.
 As an Australian I was ashamed because
 of all the nations represented at the Com-
 monwealth prime ministers' conference it
 was my country that by choosing to be a
 combatant in Vietnam embarrassed Prime
 Minister Harold Wilson's peace mission. Dis-
 engagement would make it possible for Aus-
 tralia to extract itself from a conflict into
 which it has been led, without debate, by a
 government that has been less than frank
 with our citizens.
 Australia's present policies run counter to
 its own and its neighbors' long-range inter-
 ests.  For our future is irretrievably bound
 up no~ with the West but with the 1,000 mil-
 lion people of Asia, where the days of Western
 dominance are numbered.  We must learn to
 live at peace with our neighbors.  Meanwhile,
 the presence of our soldiers on Asian soil
 combined with our "white Australia" policy
 at home gives us an ugly image throughout
 Asia.  From such an attitude as we now
 display are enemies made.  And the Bible's

 warning still holds: They who sow the wind
 reap the whirlwind.
 While freedom of speech remains, before
 casualties mount and emotions are danger-
 ouly aroused, there is still time for Aus-
 tralian troops to be withdrawn and an
 example of disengagement to be set is a
 prelude to peace.
 AHEAD, NUCLEAR HOLOCA49T
 Of one thing we can be certain: the world
 today faces its 'greatest peril since World
 War IT. ' Consider the pattern of escalation
 thus  far  established.   First,  the  United
 States simply proffered) aid and advice to
 the government in the `south.     Then came
 military support, with mounting numbers of
 American troops engaged.  Then retaliatory
 bombing of military targets.      Then Aus-
 tralia's adding its quota to the flames by
 sending troops.  Finally, on June 10, Presi-
 dent Johnson's announcement that American
 troops would take the initiative in attack.
 What are the later steps, unless arrested?
 Crossing of the 17th parallel; accompanied
 by bombing of the cities in the north, with
 the inevitable slaughter of noncombatant
 men, women, and children; then increased
 and open Chinese intervention.  The West
 could have but one answer to the impossi-
 bility of countering the military manpower
 the 700 million Chinese can provide: nuclear
 bombing.  Then-one short step to complete
 nuclear involvement and a third world war,
 leaving the planet contaminated with radia-
 tion for generations to come.
 Imposible?  Improbable?  Hardly.  Mental
 attitudes so easily lead to overt action. And
 there are forces, particularly powerful in the
 United States, that would urge the atomic
 bombing of China now as a means of keep-
 ing it from becoming a nuclear power.            Cor-
 rupted by unreasoning fear of communism,
 Public opinion in the United States, and to
 a lesser extent in Australia, could depart
 from rationality. The peril of all-out nuclear
 war lies just beyond the Vietnam firing lines.
 Right now the world may be offered its last
 chance to pause and seek deliverance.  The
 search for a solution in Vietnam must move
 from the battleground to the conference
 table. And for that, no matter what the risk
 or sacrifice involved, disengagements is a
 necessity.  There is still 'time to reverse the
 tragic trend.  I would hope that a ground
 swell  of  opposition  to  our  Government's
 policies in southeast Asia might move across
 my'own nation, that Australia might become
 a reconciling, a peacemaking force in today's
 splintered world. To seek peace, not to make
 war, is the call our people-as well as those
 in the United States-must hear.  Let us
 demand that our troops be recalled, that the
 issues be transferred to the United Nations.
 Above all, as Christians let us pray that the
 miracls may take place, that the doors to
 peace missions now closed may be opened.

 RUNAWAY WAR OR DEADLOCKED PEACE
 SAIGON, July 14.-In the judgment of this
 member of the clergymen's mission sent to
 southeast Asia at the end of June by the
 Fellowship of Reconciliation, a dangerous
 turning point in the war in Vietnam is at
 hand.  As Henry Cabot Lodge returns to the
 Embassy in Saigon and the White House
 starts a sweeping reappraisal of Vietnam pol-
 icy, the only real alternatives in Vietnam it-
 self, it seems to me, are a runaway war and
 a deadlocked peace.  It is a shocking fact
 that the choice, between these harsh alter-
 natives is being made unilaterally, in this
 20th anniversary year of the United Nations,
 by the U.S. Government on the one hand
 and the National Liberation Front (Viet-
 cong) on the other. The destiny of millions
 of people and perhaps of the whole world
 is being decided by a small group of military
 and political officers, with not much more
 chance of broad citizen-participation in the
 decisionmakng process in the United States
 than in Vietnam, let alone among the many
 other peoples who will bear the consequences
 of the policies chosen.
 All developments during this beautiful
 rain-then-sunshine-again summer in Viet-
 nam,indicate that on both sides those who
 possess the power of choice are moving
 swiftly toward runaway war: The Vietcong
 has astonished even its Chinese mentors in
 the art and science of revolutionary warfare
 by moving directly from the first phase-
 defense-to the third phase-offense-with-
 out bothering with Mao's prescribed second
 phase-a balance of forces.  At Djakarta re-
 cently, a spokesman for Peiping stated that
 his government was studying the methods
 and strategy of the Vietcong, who in their
 20-year struggle have become unequaled
 masters at effecting social transformations
 through revolutionary warfare.
 The Vietcong are everywhere in South
 Vietnam. They have cut all major transpor-
 tation arteries linking the several regions of
 the country, making air transport the only
 means of supplying either urban centers or
 mountain villages with food produced in the
 delta.  They hold from one- to two-thirds
 of the area of many provinces by day as well
 as by night, leaving the Republic of Vietnam
 forces, with their American advisers, in the
 tense posture of beleaguered garrisons.  By
 night the -Vietcong hold this cakital city it-
 self In a ring of terror. Last Sunday evening
 about 10 p.m. my taxi driver missed the
 house where I am staying at the edge of the
 city-a  bare  3  miles  from       downtown
 Saigonl As the road led through the dense
 tropical orchards toward the rubber planta-
 tions, he became quite anxious.  Soon we
 were approaching the sources of some of the
 artillery fire that is heard  in the   city
 throughout the night, and we saw some of
 the flares with which the army posts con-
 tinually flood the forest area with light.
 These are the measures by which the repub-
 lican army tries to discourage the grouping
 of Vietcong forces for terroristic forays into
 the city itself.
 But as everyone knows, the Vietcong is not
 merely an insurrectionary movement in the
 countryside, strongly supported by Hanoi,
 but a politico-military force within Saigon
 and the other cities of the south. There are
 terrorist strikes, such as those against the
 U.S. Embassy, the floating restaurant, the
 Saigon Airport, and very seldom do the
 passersby offer the authorities any evidence
 to help apprehend the offenders.  I have
 .talked with city people who, as both patriots
 and social progressives, are continually solic-
 ited by the Vietcong to join the national lib-
 eration movement to help overthrow the
 latest of Saigon's junta governments and to
 rid the country of the Americans, who are
 viewed as the remaining vestige of'white im-
 perial occupation.  My interlocutors had re-
 luctantly declined to enter the Vietcong only
 because they could not stomach its wanton
 violence.  The Vietcong appear to sense that
 their people are closer to the goal of an in-
 dependent Vietnam, free of the last traces of
 foreign domination, than they have ever been
 since the French first arrived a century ago.
 They smell victory and will stop at nothing
 in their effort to grasp it firmly in their hard
 and horny hands.
 II
 Meanwhile,  North Vietnamese battalions
 are taking up positions back of the guerrilla
 warriors, ready to consolidate their gains.
 The Foreign Minister of neutralist Cambodia,
 Koun Week, warned me in an interview that
 if these troops should prove unable to with-
 stand the increasing number of U.S. para-
 troopers and infantrymen, "the Chinese will
 not hesitate to employ millions of soldiers in
 a combat with the United States on the
 ground in southeast Asia, and Peiping would
 definitely use the nuclear arms at her dis-
 posal."
 There is no need here to recall in detail
 the escalation of the American war effort in
 South Vietnam from a few hundred military
 advisers 10 years ago to more than 75,000 men
 today, supported by bombing missions origi-
 nating both from aircraft carriers off the
 Vietnamese coast and from the Guam naval
 base more than 2,000 miles away.  There is
 great need to hold congressional hearings and
 nationwide debate on the wisdom and right-
 ness of current Pentagon plans to turn the
 large-scale American war effort into a mas-
 sive land war in southeast Asia, whose im-
 mediate objective might well be an independ-
 ent and friendly South Vietnam but whose
 ultimate  goal  would  inevitably  become-
 once the armed might of the United States
 became locked in mortal encounter with the
 North Vietnamese and the Chinese peoples'
 armies-the  liberation  of  North  Vietnam
 from the Communist rule of No Chi Minh
 and the overthrow of the imperialist Chinese
 Communist government of Mao Tse-tung.
 Since every Western military expert be-
 lieves that the United States possesses weap-
 onry more than sufficient to balance the sheer
 numbers of the Asian Communist armies,
 the crucial question would then be the re-
 sponse of the Soviet Union.  I have met no
 one in southeast Asia who believes that in
 such a showdown the Soviet Union could
 avoid giving modern military support to the
 poorly equipped armies of sister Communist
 nations.  This feeling that such a situation
 would close the rift between the Soviet
 Union and China is based not on sentimental
 factors but rather on the sober surmise that
 a Pentagon which was allowed to destroy
 Chinese power would be expected by the
 Soviets to turn its sights at once on the
 Kremlin itself-the only logical outcome of
 the chain of reasoning that begins with the
 attitude of "Why not victory?"  The Soviet
 Union too has to worry about falling domi-
 noes.  The likelihood is that, as this fear
 begins to dominate the planners who con-
 trol the levers of command at the heart of
 both the vast affronting blocs, the brush-
 fire on the Mekong delta will blaze into a
 runaway conflagration.
 The Cambodian foreign minister termi-
 nated our conversation by saying: "The world
 is at an extremely dangerous turning point
 In the Vietnamese war.  The peace efforts
 of the American clergymen';; committee are
 laudable but, I fear, doomed like all others
 to failure.  The world is headed  straight
 toward nuclear war."
 III
 The peace movement on the American
 campuses and in the American churches has
 long been aware of the sinister character of
 the war in Vietnam.                                 It has reminded all who
 would listen that the struggle there is ba-
 sically political and must eventually be re-
 solved by a political settlement, that military
 power alone cannot obtain any end that
 could be termed victory.  And it has pointed
 out the very real and perilous possibility
 that  one-sided concentration  on  military
 force will end in general war.
 Most of those Americans who have urged
 President Johnson to stop the war in Viet-
 nam have responded to his question "How?"
 by calling for negotiations.   When pressed
 for more detail they have envisaged the re-
 convening of the Geneva conference or some-
 thing similar and have insisted on a return
 to the 1954 agreement for a reunified Viet-
 nam in which a national government would
 be established on the basis of free elections.
 These elections, the withdrawal of foreign
 armed forces and the integrity of the total
 territory of Vietnam would be guaranteed by
 some kind  of international peacekeeping
 police power.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE          August 3, 1965
 the I2 members of our clergymen's mission
 in South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand,
 we heard no knowledgeable person call for
 reunification of the two Vietnams. Not only
 does no one we met believe it to be a pos-
 sible political objective at present, but most
 would seriously question its desirability now
 or for years to come.
 We were astonished at the cfepth of the
 antagonism between the North Vietnamese
 and the South Vietnamese. whatever their
 individual political coloring-particularly be-
 tween the Tonkinese, who predominate In
 the north, and the Cochinchinese, who con-
 stitute 90 percent of the population of the
 south.  When the Chinese exercised their
 1,000-year suzerainty over the area that now
 comprises the two Vietnams, they were al-
 ways obliged to handle them separately, and
 the French did likewise during their cen-
 tury of colonial rule.  One reason for the
 governmental instability that has charac-
 terized South Vietnam for the past 10 years
 is that many of the top posts have gone to
 able and aggressive men among the refugees
 that came from the north in 1954.  No Co-
 chinchinese has yet been Prime Minister or
 President of South Vietnam.  In university
 circles and among religious groups-e.g., be-
 tween the two main Buddhist reform move-
 ments-this same regional tension obtains,
 rendering unified action all the more diffi-
 cult.
 Iv
 In a word, a deadlocked peace-one in
 which continuing division of the country Is
 the only reasonable and perhaps the only
 realizable basis for political settlement-is
 the true option to a runaway war.  But a
 separate South Vietnam can be achieved only
 it the National Liberation Front participates
 In its government.  And here lies a formida-
 ble obstacle to all negotiations.  There have
 teen 'indications that the "unconditional"
 discussions suggested by President Johnson
 might countenance Vietcong representation
 in the delegation of North Vietnam. But the
 people with whom I talked unanimously de-
 clared that this arrangement would never be
 accepted by the National Liberation Front,
 arguing that the N.L.F. and its Vietcong war-
 riors, while quick to utilize Ho Chi Minh's
 skilled personnel and his material support,
 have no intention of turning over to him
 aiid the detested northerners the fruits of
 24 years of struggle and suffering. The N.L.F.
 will insist on being represented at the con-
 ference table in its own right, and a good
 share of the cabinet posts in any coalition
 government must go to it.
 What kind of society would this coalition
 government offer the continuing Republic of
 South Vietnam?  It would have as its base,
 ray respondents answered, a planned econ-
 omy in which landlords would have a dimin-
 ishing,part-a "national socialism" such as
 Algeria and other new nations are trying to
 establish.  But as for foreign policy the
 country would be nonalined, on the model
 of neighboring Cambodia-swinging toward
 China if pushed too hard by the West but
 swinging  toward  the  United  States  and
 France if pushed too hard by China.   Like
 much of the "third world," most South Viet-
 namese  Who  think  in  geopolitical                          terms
 aspire to national independence, economic
 development under a socialist type of gov-
 Arnmeri.t and elemental security from hunger
 and violence.
 v
 Could such a small neutralist state remain
 independent against new pressures  from
 North Vietnam and eventually from China?
 It is clear that the viability of such-a South
 Vietnam could be guaranteed only by the
 continuing  presence  of  an international
 peacekeeping force.   But from all sides I
 have heard it affirmed that no whites, be
 they  American  or    Swedish,  Russian  or
 French, would be acceptable for this task.
 Only an international police force composed
 primarily of representatives of the armies of
 India, Burma, Indonesia, and the smaller
 countries of the area--and quite possibly
 Africa as well-would have a chance of being
 accepted as essentially different from colonial
 powers.
 This vision of the future will not please
 many Americans, and it may, seem to be an
 entirely inadequate reward to many of our
 military leaders for all the risks run, mate-
 rials consumed, lives lost.  But will our Con-
 gress reassume its constitutional authority
 to control the warmaking machine?  Will
 our President restore to the State Depart-
 ment the role of supreme adviser in the mak-
 ing of foreign policy?  Will American Chris-
 tians and Jews and all other men of good
 will have the maturity -and the energy to
 compel their Government to choose those
 next steps which could lead from the brink
 of runaway war to the long, hard pull that--
 the best we can hope for-is the deadlock of
 a peace in which neither side has victory and
 neither is destroyed?

 BIG BROTHER: FEDERAL SNOOPING
 Mr. LONG of Missouri.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, my Big Brother item for today con-
 sists of two unusually good editorials.
 One is from the Miami Herald, of July 21,
 1965, and the other is from the Times of
 Corpus Christi, Tex.
 I ask unanimous consent that they be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Miami Herald, July 21, 1965]
 CASE OF FEDERAL SNOOPERY
 Some of us who fuss about big government
 and bureaucracy often are set down as lowly
 beaters of dead horses.  But look what big
 government and bureaucracy begot in the
 Internal Revenue Service.
 A Senate subcommittee which has been
 looking into charges of invasion of privacy
 by revenue agents has uncovered some exam-
 ples of unrestrained folly.
 Wiretapping is practiced so widely that
 there are government schools where agents
 are trained in its niceties.  A recruit can also
 learn how to pick a lock, plant a microphone,
 set up a two-way mirror and operate gadgets
 that see in the dark.
 All of this is not only illegal; it's even for-
 bidden by departmental regulations.  Thus
 these invasions of privacy make a hypocrite
 of the law itself, which is perhaps their worst
 offense.
 Of course, it is all done in a good cause.
 Many a hoodlum would have gone tax-free
 as well as scot-free but for some kind of
 surveillance on which the law frowns.  The
 temptation is to write off this activity as a
 necessary evil in the complicated process of
 doing good.
 We think, however, that the law ought to
 be observed or repealed.
 In practice, it is not considered illegal to
 tap a wire or bug a room unless conversations
 which are picked up are in turn disclosed
 officially.  Yet evidence of this sort cannot
 be used In court.
 So the law becomes not merely hypocritical
 but inconsistent and thus ridiculous.
 Privacy, like water, is ignobly polluted in
 the United States today.  The Senate hear-
 ing may have the effect of cleaning up some
 of the sources if a shocked public opinion
 becomes the detergent.
 [From  the  Corpus  Christi  (Tex.)  Times,
 July 3, 1965]
 PRIVACY
 Quite a little attention has been focused
 lately on invasion of privacy by units of the
 Federal Government.  The public has been
 made aware that thousands of Government
 employees are given "lie detector" tests or
 psychological tests featuring intimate per-
 sonal questions, that the post office pries into
 who gets mail from whom, that there is a lot
 of authorized and unauthorized listening in
 on phone talk in Government offices, and so
 on.
 Congressional  committee  probes  have
 brought most of these disclosures.   That is
 the first half of a pattern that has emerged.
 The second half, more often than not, is a
 promise by the offending agency that it will
 be less snoopy-less in violation of the basic
 American right to privacy-than in the past.
 The State Department, for example, has
 been reviewing use of psychological tests, and
 may modify its practices.  Postmaster Gen-
 eral Gronouski, after admitting that the so-
 called mail covers "do to some degree invade
 individual rights," has issued new adminis-
 trative rules intended to keep this extralegal
 practice under better control.
 This is an unsatisfactory way to deal with
 a problem that touches closely on a constitu-
 tional right we should be zealous to pre-
 serve-the right to live  our private  lives
 without Government prying.  The pattern of
 disclosure followed by promisesto do better
 in the future is not adequate.    What is
 needed is congressional action to reaffirm the
 principle of individual privacy, and to keep
 the actions of Government agencies firmly in
 check.
 THE HUNGER EXPLOSION
 Mr. MONDALE.  Mr. President, last
 week I spoke to the Senate on the danger
 of the world's -hunger explosion, and the
 urgent need for the United States to do
 more in order to save millions from star-
 vation and crippling malnutrition. I was
 gratified to read, in the Sunday news-
 papers, two articles which illuminate
 the dimensions of this crisis and discuss
 what can be done to cope with it.
 In the Washington Post, Jean M.
 White gives a graphic picture of the de-
 veloping situation in her article, "The
 Poor Are Engulfing the Earth."
 In the New York Times, an article by
 Felix Belair, Jr., gives a detailed discus-
 sion of an important new program ;lust
 launched by our Agency for International
 Development to combat malnutrition in
 preschool children in developing nations.
 His article is entitled "U.S. Acts To Raise
 World Nutrition."
 I ask unanimous consent these two
 articles be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 THE POOR ARE ENGULFING THE EARTH;  THE
 POPULATION EXPLOSION-ACTUALLY, A HOLI-
 DAY FOR DEATH-Is OCCURRING WHERE IT'S
 LEAST SUPPORTABLE
 (By Jean M. White)
 In just 35 years-when many of us still
 will be around-it is very likely that there
 will be twice as many people on earth as
 there are today.
 The time to do anything about that, if
 we had wanted to, was yesterday.  The popu-
 lation problem is here and now and grows
 bigger by at least 11/4 million people each
 week.
 Population projections used to be inter-
 esting   mathematical   exercises   enabling
 demographers to predict when a standing-
 room-only  sign  would  be  posted  on  a
 crammed earth. But today we are finding
 that runaway population Is bound up with

 ington, there is constant need for re-
 freshment of the soul in beauty and
 harmony.
 Such notes were struck on July 26 and
 28 with the beginning of a series of out-
 door concerts at Washington's National
 Cathedral.  The "Summer Festival of
 Chamber Music," as it is called, began
 with a program of trios by Mozart,
 Haydn, and Schumann.  It will extend,
 in the coming weeks, to vocal, choral,
 and other Instrumental presentations.
 . The scene of the concerts is the Steps
 of the Pilgrims, which lead upward to
 the south transept of the Cathedral,
 where floodlights silhouette the gothic
 spires against the darkening blue sky.
 The listeners are surrounded by the orna-
 mental shrubbery of the Cathedral gar-
 dens, where birds accompany the per-
 formers from time to time.
 In the words of music critic Irving
 Lowens of the Evening Star newspaper,
 these concerts have been a sensational
 success from many points of view. One
 indication was the overflow, first-night
 audience estimated at between 1,500 to
 2,000. Mr. Lowens further observes that
 although many cities have long enjoyed
 classical music during the summer, this
 new venture in Washington should pro-
 vide encouragement and an excellent
 precedent.
 Although the names of those respon-
 sible for the festival do not appear on
 the program, I understand that it was
 conceived and planned by Mr. Richard
 Dirksen, who also plays a leading part
 as the keyboard artist, in Its execution.
 Werner Lywen, the concertmaster of
 the National Symphony Orchestra, and
 John Martin, its first-chair cellist, head
 the list of the other outstanding per=
 formers.
 Mr. Dirksen, who has been with the
 cathedral for the past 20 years as its
 associate choirmaster and organist, now
 occupies the position of director of ad-
 vance program.  This office was estab-
 lished a year and a half ago for the
 purpose of expanding the institution's
 ministry by presenting events such as
 the festival as free offerings from the
 catherdral to the community.
 In my judgment, the cathedral and
 these individuals have enriched life in
 Washington by providing pleasant en-
 tertainment in an inspiring setting.
 I would thus like the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD to reflect the appreciation of
 one member of the Senate District Com-
 mittee and undoubtedly many grateful
 citizens.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the schedule of future con-
 certs, together with reviews from the
 Washington Post and Evening Star, be
 printed following my remarks:
 There being no objection, the schedule
 and reviews were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 WASHINGTON CATHEDRAL ANNOUNCES A SUM-
 MER FESTIVAL OF CHAMBER MUSIC

 Trios of Mozart, Haydn, Schumann, and
 Mendelssohn; Werner Lywen, John Martin,
 Richard Dirksen.

 dral close. Come early and by Massachusetts
 Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, or Woodley Road
 bus if at all possible.
 The cathedral will remain open until 10
 p.m. on each of these evenings, but no aids
 will be on duty.  Your quiet postconcert
 visit is most cordially invited.
 CATHEDRAL CONCERT OFFERING PRAISED
 AS "FESTIVAL" EVENT
 At last Washington has the makings for a
 unique  and  glorious  summer  festival  of
 music.  On the basis of last night's first con-
 cert of a series this week and next month,
 Richard Dirksen's organization of outdoor
 musical events on the grounds of Washington
 Cathedral should easily grow into something
 that would attract visitors from far and wide.
 It was by far the most engaging and de-
 lightful summer music that has come my
 way in Washington for a decade.  Dirksen,
 Werner Lywen, concertmaster of the National
 Symphony,  and  John  Martin, first-chair
 cellist of the same joined forces as they have
 many times in the past, and brought us trios
 of Mozart, Haydn and Schumann.
 Aside from the relaxed and gracious music-
 making  from  the  players,                                                                        the   cathedral
 grounds proved to be spectacular as a setting.
 A small platform, backed and angle-roofed,
 was open on three sides and placed near the
 bottom of the wide steps leading to the newly
 completed south entrance to the cathedral.
 About 300 chairs were at the foot of the
 stairs, not nearly enough to hold the crowd
 which brought blankets, chairs, baby car-
 riages, books and children to hear the music.
 Boxwood, magnolias, dogwood and holly
 banked the staircase.  As darkness closed in,
 the lights in the boxwood, those in the arch-
 way of the door above and on the tower
 created a scene around the musicians at once
 both peaceful and exciting ? ? 0 the sort of
 atmosphere best described as majestic.
 But for the newness of the edifice it might
 well have been the Baths or Basilica of Con-
 stantine in Rome, a Cathedral Square concert
 in Spoleto, or a concert in the Mirabel Gar-
 dens in Salzburg.  And it must be said that
 had the concert been given with any less
 than such perfect planning and care for de-
 tails, things would not have been so rare and
 so thoroughly enjoyable.
 The crowd sat on the lawns for at least
 another 50 yards out from the chairs.  No
 amplification system was used but with the
 spell cast by the scene and the music, only
 the occasional zoom of a locust (which man-
 aged a close rythmic pulse in the second
 movement of the Haydn) and a goodnight
 chirping of a cardinal interrupted the calm
 of listening conditions.
 It was a very special evening.  The three
 musicians, longtime friends and playing part-
 ners, were in fine form.  They will take the
 same spot over again Wednesday night, this
 time with other trios of Mozart, Haydn, and
 the Mendelssohn D minor.  A half hour of
 carillon  music  will  be played  by Ronald
 Barnes before concert time at 8 p.m.  See
 you there.

 NEWS OF MUSIC:  CONCERT AT  CATHEDRAL A
 SUCCESS IN THREE WAYS
 (By Irving Lowens)
 NoTE.-Werner Lywen, violin; John Mar-
 tin, cello; Richard Dirksen, piano.  Outdoor
 amphitheater, Washington Cathedral. Pro-
 gram: Piano Trio No. 5 in B flat, K 502,
 Mozart; Piano Trio No. 16 in D, Haydn; Piano
 Trio No. 2 in F, Op. 80, Schumann.
 The first of seven free summer chamber
 music concerts presented by the Washington
 Cathedral in its outdoor amphitheater took
 place last night, and from many points of
 view, it was a sensational success.
 For one thing, there was the size of the
 audience.  It was a bit difficult to estimate,
 since the  amphitheater has no chairs  or
 benches, and people were pretty widely scat-
 tered.  However, my guess would be some-
 where  between  1,500 and  2,000, which                                                                                                                               is
 roughly three to four times the capacity of
 the Coolidge Auditorium.  Not bad for piano
 trios.
 And those on hand did not come just be-
 cause it was a nice evening, although the
 weather may have helped to increase the
 crowd.   They came  to listen  to   Mozart,
 Haydn and Schumann.      They acted as if
 they were at a concert as indeed, they were
 and they gave the excellent performers full
 attention.
 For another thing, there was the loveliness
 of the setting.  The three musicians played
 from a tiny, wood-frame shell perched on
 the steps approaching the southern facade
 of the Cathedral.   As dusk fell  and  the
 shadows deepened, the thrust of the Gothic
 spires against the deep blue sky was awe-
 inspiring.  It would be difficult to think of
 a European festival that takes place in a spot
 more visually attractive.
 It would seem that the potential of a sum-
 mer series of outdoor cathedral concerts is
 limitless, but it would not be fair to those
 who conceived this inspired idea to leave
 the  impression  that  perfection has  been
 achieved at one full swoop.
 The one big difficulty at the moment-and
 it should not be understimated-is that bug-
 aboo of all outdoor music: bad acoustics.
 The musicians play from a spot well above
 their listeners, and the slope of the grass
 from the base of the steps is downward.  If
 you  think  about the  architecture  of  all
 theaters  (indoor  and outdoor),  you    will
 recollect that the audience Invariably looks
 down upon the performers-that is, the slope
 of the seats from the edge of the stage is
 upward.
 The reason for this was plain yesterday-
 sound, like smoke, rises.  As a consequence,
 what one  heard  down below was  a  pale
 echo of the three Instruments, lacking both
 highs and lows and with middle tones faint
 and dull.
 Thus, John Martin's cello (even were he
 not handicapped, in  the Haydn D major
 trio, with a line which doubles the piano
 more often than not) . was barely audible;
 Werner Lywen's violin sounded more like a
 cigarbox fiddle than a fine instrument; and
 Richard Dirksen's piano reminded me of the
 "practice uprights" I used to avoid on cam-
 pus in my student days.
 This was most unfortunate, because from
 the evidence, the Messrs. Lywen, Martin, and
 Dirksen were playing extremely well.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 I was following proceedings score in hand,
 so I feel confident in saying so.  They sim-
 ply were not getting through in aural tones.
 The program, although featuring familiar
 composers, consisted of rather unfamiliar
 works. Only some 4 years separated the B
 flat Mozart (one of the finest of his eight
 piano trios) from the D major Haydn, but
 there is a world of difference in the manner
 in which the two men handle the combina-
 tion.  Mozart looks forward to Beethoven;
 Haydn looks back to the trio-sonata.
 The Schumann F major trio, the least per-
 formed  of  his  three  is  characteristically
 romantic and impetuous, while it does tend
 to be a little verbose, it contains some re-
 markably eloquent pages.
 Tomorrow,   the   Lywen-Martin-Dirksen
 combination returns with a completely fresh
 program: Mozart in E; Haydn in A; Mendels-
 sohn in D minor.                             At 7:80 p.m., half an
 hour before the concert begins, the Cathe-
 dral's carilloneur, Ronald Barnes, plays a
 short recital.
 If the Cathedral's advance program com-
 mittee can get. the acoustics straightened
 out, Washington will get a present of a
 superb outdoor series of fine concerts.
 Bring your folding chairs, camp stools, and
 blankets; sit in close; applaud loudly.  The
 least the city's music lovers can do is to
 testify to the fact that Washington wants
 more than the service bands, the pickup
 orchestras, and the Carter Barron lollipops
 during the long, long summer.

 CATHEDRAL TRIO DRAWS THRONG
 (By John Haskins)
 NOTE.-Werner Lywen, violin; John Mar-
 tin, cello; Richard Dirksen, piano. At Wash-
 ington Cathedral Amphitheater.  Program:
 Trio in E, K. 542, Mozart; Trio in A, Hayden;
 Trio in D Minor, Op. 29, Mendelssohn.
 There may have been as many as six or
 seven hundred persons attending the sec-
 ond in Washington Cathedral's series of out-
 door chamber music concerts last night, but
 it was hard to tell. They sat in seats provided
 on the cinder roadway below the south en-
 trance, they clustered on the dripping steps,
 they gathered on soaked slopes, and they
 just stood around.
 One would have 6 ected the concert to be
 moved indoors, but Richard Dirksen listened
 to the strong though inaudible vox populi,
 and seeing them gathering outside] changed
 his mind for the third time and decided to
 go ahead with the original schedule of place.
 It made trying conditions for everyone, not
 least of all the players, but it was cool,
 though dank, and the only audience loss dur-
 ing the concert was accounted for by cranky
 children who had to be removed when dark-
 ness fell.
 Sound, though not focused, was adequate
 for anyone who could take up a position
 within a couple hundred feet.  In the pecu-
 liar acoustical situation, the Mendelssohn
 trio came off best, because of its restlessness,
 its sweeping romantic character, and because
 the cello was kept in its high range most of
 the time.  A close second was the Haydn, its
 natural  strength asserting itself through
 seoring not so heavy as the Mendelssohn.
 There was better ensemble in the Haydn,
 also.
 Least successful was the Mozart,  its pa-
 trician grace designed for surroundings more
 intimate, its open writing designed to be
 undertaken only after rather more rehearsal
 than this performance suggested it might
 have had,
 Two things can be said for chamber music
 in what the Cathedral chooses to call an
 amphitheater.  There is no more magnifi-
 cent backdrop in the area for music of any
 kind, with the thrusting Gloria in Excelsis
 Tower dignifying all that falls within its
 shadow.  And if hundreds of persons will
 gather for chamber music under conditions
 far less than adequate, the need is un-
 arguable.
 Substitute a proper shell for that junky-
 looking plywood hut, even located where it
 is, and Washington will have something spe-
 cial in the way of summer chamber music--
 better than MgrJ:ct#t-nRili, Park 25 years ago.
 VIETNAM
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I turn
 to the subject of the war in Vietnam.
 In the course of my remarks, I shall ex-
 press  some  respectful  disagreements
 with the Senator from .Wisconsin [Mr.
 PROXMIRE] in regard to a speech that he
 delivered on the floor of the Senate on
 July 28, which I did not have the
 privilege of hearing because I was en-
 gaged in committee work.  I have sup-
 plied the Senator from Wisconsin with
 an advance copy of my remarks this
 afternoon.
 On July 28, the Senator from Wis-
 consin  [Mr.  PROxMIRE]  spoke in the
 Senate on the subject of why the United
 States has not followed the procedures
 of the United Nations Charter in con-
 nection with Vietnam.  In general ex-
 planation of administration action, the
 Senator said:
 We cannot turn to the U.N. for practical
 reasons.  Use of the U.N. Assembly and use
 of the U.N. Security Council are both blocked.
 Yet a few sentences later, the same
 Senator said:
 The President also said that if the United
 Nations can by deed or word bring us nearer
 to an honorable peace, it will have Ameri-
 can support, and that Ambassador Goldberg
 has been directed to tell the United Nations
 that we want all resources of the United
 Nations used to achieve peace.
 I assume the Senator from Wisconsin
 was quoting with approval those state-
 ments of the President.  He is in the
 position that so many administration
 supporters are in of saying that we can-
 not turn to the U.N. but if the President
 turns to it, fine.  Over the weeks and
 months since early 1964, there has been
 an amazing chronicle of American policy
 spokesmen explaining why one avenue
 for action in Vietnam was closed to us,
 only to be followed by a turn down of
 that very avenue 'within a short time.
 This has been true of statements on
 escalation of the war, and it has been
 true of statements on use of the United
 Nations.  If we know anything for cer-
 tain about the conduct of American
 policy in Vietnam, we know that just be-
 cause an alternative is rejected today
 does not mean it will not be used to-
 morrow.
 And I know that the vast majority of
 those defenders of the administration
 will support the administration if it
 should place the whole matter before the
 U.N., just as they now support the ad-
 ministration in not placing the matter
 before the U.N. This is the real mean-
 ing of the opinion polls which are so
 often cited to prove public support of the
 policy in Vietnam. They prove that the
 Public is still putting its trust in the
 President, not that they believe any one
 given policy is the best or the soundest.
 I do not doubt for a minute that if Am-
 bassador Goldberg were to ask for an
 immediate meeting of the Security Coum-
 cil to consider the threat to the peace in
 Vietnam-an action we are duty bound
 to take under the terms of the charter-
 the American people would continue to
 say they have confidence in the handling
 of the Vietnam situation by the Presi-
 dent.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE.  I am delighted to yield.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  What the Senator
 is saying, as I understand, is that if in
 the judgment of the President the time
 appears to be propitious, if the time ap-
 pears to be right, if the situation has
 changed or has become modified, if under
 those circumstances the President pro-
 poses to take a different course with
 regard to the United Nations, he might
 receive the supphrt of many Senators,
 including the Senator from Wisconsin.
 In reply to the Senatorfrom Oregon,
 the position of the Senator from Wis-
 consin is that the situation does change.
 There are many reasons that might bring
 about a change, many of which are with-
 in the knowledge of the State Depart-
 ment and the President of the United
 States, and are not available, at least to
 the Senator from Wisconsin.  It seems
 to the Senator from Wisconsin that, if
 the President of the United States wishes
 to follow a different course in the future
 than he has in the past, that does not
 mean that he was wrong in the past.
 It does mean that the President of the
 United  States  has information  that
 might be persuasive.  I am not saying
 that I give him a blank check because I
 do not. But I do say that the President
 of the United States, under new or dif-
 ferent circumstances, might be' able to
 make a case which would convince the
 Senator from Wisconsin and other Sen-
 ators that his course was correct.
 The situation changes.  It is very
 subtle.  Often the changes are behind
 the scenes.  For perfectly obvious rea-
 sons, they might not be available to the
 general public.  They cannot be.  I say
 under those circumstances it makes
 sense for the President to change his
 policy as time goes on.  The worst kind
 of policy is one which would freeze his
 feet in concrete and never permit change.
 Mr. MORSE.  I should like to say
 good-naturedly and out of love and af-
 fection that by the same argument it
 does not show that the Senator from
 Wisconsin was right in the past.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Oh, I agree.
 Mr. MORSE.  I have been expressing
 the point of view for the last 2 years
 that the Senator has been dead wrong
 for the past 2 years.
 Mr. President, I do not doubt for a
 minute, either, that the politicians and
 the newspapers who are now defending
 our refusal to live up to the charter
 would be the first to defend our resort
 to it if that became the policy of the ad-
 ministration.
 What we have from the Senator from
 Wisconsin and from the Washington
 Post, which he quotes, is a defense of
 the President.  Do either of them mean
 to say they would express public opposi-

 ity Council if the President decided to
 do it?
 Of course not.  They would be the first
 to explain the advantages of such a move.
 The great, basic flaw in the line pre-
 sented by the Washington Post and the
 Senator from Wisconsin is that they set
 up a strawman which they proceed to
 knock down. It is nothing but a straw-
 man to say that supporters of the United
 Nations indicate that going to the U.N.
 would put an end to the whole struggle.
 I do not know of anyone who has held
 out the promise that the United Nations
 could or would eliminate the problem of
 Vietnam.
 The problem would continue to exist,
 but it would be considered in a new con-
 text and a new forum and not solely in
 the context and forum of a confronta-
 tion between the United States alone on
 one side and Communist powers in Asia
 on the other side.
 Second, it is a great, and glaring as-
 sumption of their presentation that the
 United Nations. Charter is no more to us
 than it is to Communist powers-a device
 .to be used when convenient and ignored
 when it is not convenient.  The direc-
 tives of the charter on what to do when
 a threat to the peace occurs are not con-
 tingent on whether they are practical
 for any particular nation. There are
 many times when any constitution is not
 practical.  But if we are to have a rule
 of law either in one nation or among
 nations, the procedures designed in the
 calm of an international deliberation to
 cope with threats to the peace must be
 followed.
 Fifty  years  ago, . Americans  were
 shocked when Kaiser Wilhelm referred
 to a treaty obligation of the German Em-
 pire as "a scrap of paper."  The treaty
 was not convenient and not practical for
 the needs of the German Empire at that
 hour, so that was the end of the treaty.
 Today, we have an American policy
 that views the United Nations Charter
 not as a solemn national obligation but
 as impractical and inconvenient.  Where
 Is our national honor as pledged by our
 ratification of the United Nations Char-
 ter?  Where is our word as a nation that
 we will submit to the Security Council
 any dispute to which we are a party and
 cannot resolve by peaceful means?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE.  I yield.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I feel certain that
 the Senator from Oregon knows that the
 Senator from Wisconsin has never been
 a rubberstamp for the President of the
 United States, who, when he was the
 majority leader, had great power in the
 Senate.  The Senator from Wisconsin
 was the first on the floor of the Senate
 to attack procedures under which the
 Senator from texas was operating,  The
 Senator from Oregon strongly supported
 the Senator from Wisconsin In that posi-
 tion.  But I took the initiative and criti-
 cized the major leader on many issues.
 I shall do so in the future now that the
 former Senator  from  Texas  Is the
 President.
 I do not criticize him in this area
 because I agree with him.  However, I
 invite the attention of the Senator
 from Oregon to the fact that any nation,
 under article 35 of the United Nations
 Charter, can bring any dispute or situa-
 tion to the attention of the Security
 Council or of the General Assembly; yet
 they have not done so. Why? Does this
 mean that all the.nations of the United
 Nations are wrong, and that only the
 senior Senator from Oregon, in this par-
 ticular case, is right?
 Mr. MORSE.  Ninety of them receive
 our foreign aid.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Oh, yes, they re-
 ceive our foreign aid; but a number of
 them do not get it. Some of them that
 receive our foreign aid have been very
 quick to criticize the United States for all
 kinds of factions adverse to the United
 States.  And certainly those 90 nations
 are not so corrupt that they would sell
 their moral obligation for foreign aid.
 No, the time is not ripe.  The other
 nations in the world know that to bring
 this matter before the Security Council
 now would not make sense.
 First. They know that there is a likely
 veto in the Security Council.
 Second. They know that the United
 Nations Assembly is paralyzed and has
 been able to move only on procedural
 matters, and barely that, as a matter of
 fact, in the past 4. or 5 months.  There is
 no prospect that the United Nations As-
 sembly will be able to take action in the
 near future.
 It is hopeful that Ambassador Gold-
 berg and President Johnson may be able
 to change the situation.  The situation
 may change in the future.    I hope and
 pray that it will.  But the fact that they
 have not acted to date has the affirma-
 tion and support of the other nations
 in the world.  Yes, a hundred other na-
 tions could bring up the matter.  Why
 have they not done so?
 Mr. MORSE.  May I say two or three
 things before I proceed with my speech?
 Many of the comments of the Senator
 from Wisconsin are answered In the
 speech.
 Many of the nations that are not now
 receiving foreign aid have never given up
 hope.
 I do not charge the Senator from Wis-
 consin with being a rubberstamp.  He
 will not put words either in my mouth
 or in my speech.  I merely say that I
 believe the Senator from Wisconsin has
 followed bad judgment and reasoning in
 following the President in his unconstitu-
 tional and, therefore, illegal war in Asia.
 The senior Senator from Oregon does
 not intend to follow "the President in
 fighting a war, which the President now
 admits is a war-he started his admis-
 sion last Wednesday-that has not been
 declared.
 As I said in my reply to the President
 last Wednesday, he is conducting an-il-
 legal war.  He is without the slightest
 authority to conduct that war, under
 the Constitution.  The Members of the
 Senate and House who voted to seek to
 delegate power to the President to de-
 clare war cannot resolve their action un-
 der the Constitution, for they have no
 right to delegate the power to make war.
 All that Congress can do is to declare
 war.
 18415
 The senior Senator from Oregon in-
 tends to continue to take the position
 he has taken, calling either for a declara-
 tion of war or for our stopping the mak-
 ing of war and the taking of American
 boys to their slaughter in South Viet-
 nam.
 Many persons are disturbed because I
 said last Wednesday-and I repeat it
 today-that when life is taken illegally,
 those who take it become guilty of homi-
 cide. In my judgment, we cannot justify
 the homicides for which the President, or
 Rusk, or McNamara, or Bundy, or Lodge,
 and the rest of them are responsible in
 conducting an unconstitutional war in
 South Vietnam.
 So far as the other nations are con-
 cerned, they have the same legal obliga-
 tion under the United Nations Charter
 as has the United States. Their failure
 to have the Security Council convened
 does not make our failures to do so
 right.  Furthermore, the United States
 is a major belligerent; we' are a party
 to the dispute.  Therefore, more provi-
 sions of the charter apply to us than to
 others, and we have an even greater
 moral responsibility to live up to our
 obligations under the United Nations
 Charter. That is why, for 2 years, I have
 been pleading from this desk, and I shall
 continue to do so, short of a declaration
 of war, to do what I can to get my
 country to start living up to its obliga-
 tions under the United Nations and to
 stop being an outlaw Nation, which we
 are so long as we violate our obligations
 under the United Nations Charter.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield once more on that
 point?
 Mr. MORSE.  I yield.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Does it not make
 sense that the President of the United
 States, before he takes this issue to the
 Security Council, should do everything
 within his power to create a situation
 in which he can obtain affirmative ac-
 tion from the Security Council to try
 to dissuade Russia, and perhaps France,
 from acting adversely toward us?  Does
 not the Senator from Oregon conceive
 that this may take a great deal of time,
 and that weeks, perhaps months or even
 years may be needed to cause a change
 in the situation?  There has perhaps
 been a change in the attitude of the
 Soviet Union recently.  This is the kind
 of a situation into which the President
 would be wrong in blundering at any
 time, regardless of the situation.  He
 must work carefully with the State De-
 partment, with his ambassadors, with
 those who are talking with the Russians,
 people who are competent and have good
 judgment  concerning  the   situation.
 Should he not permit the new Ambas-
 sador to the United Nations to have an
 opportunity to observe the situation and
 uae his enormous ability in this regard?
 It seems to me that to urge the Presi-
 dent to act impetuously, without regard
 to what the other members of the
 United Nations may do, may be techni-
 cally correct, according to the words of
 the charter; but it seems to me that it
 could be a most unwise policy, and not
 the way an effective, successful policy
 is achieved.

 18416                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 The Senator from Oregon recalls, I
 feel certain, how effective the former
 Senator from Texas was as majority
 leader.  He was very careful, before he
 moved, to make certain that he had his
 "ducks in a row."  He worked for a
 consensus. He made sure that all his
 bases were touched. All this takes time;
 it cannot be done immediately.  Not
 only does it take time, but-and I feel
 sure the Senator from Oregon will dis-
 agree-it takes a display of power and
 takes a demonstration of our resolution
 to act militarily.  These are the ingre-
 dients that must be woven into the
 fabric.
 Does the Senator from Oregon really
 believe that the President, should be re-
 quired to, act impulsively, suddenly, or
 automatically?
 Mr. MORSE. The Senator from Wis-
 consin has asked me a question; I shall
 be glad to answer it.  The question is:
 Do I, in essence think it makes sense
 for the President to follow the course of
 action he has been following in South
 Vietnam?
 My answer is:  No.     I have seen no
 sense in the President's course of con-
 duct in Vietnam. To the contrary, I have
 seen the President write one of the most
 sorry, sordid pages or chapters in Amer-
 ican history by his course of conduct in
 Vietnam.
 "Time," pleads the Senator from Wis-
 consin. During that period of time, boy
 after boy has been taken to his slaughter
 in the escalated war in South Vietnam.
 If it is time the President' has needed in
 order to take this matter to the United
 Nations Security Council,  he should
 have stopped killing boys in South Viet-
 nam.  By escalating the, war, he has
 been clearly in violation of all his powers
 as President of the United States.
 The course of conduct that the Presi-
 dent has followed in South Vietnam is
 completely unjustified with regard to,
 his violations, in my judgment, of one in-
 ternational law obligation after another.
 It would not have taken any time to
 live up to the treaty. If we have pledged
 ourselves to obligations under the treaty,
 then we have no right to continue for
 months and months to violate that
 treaty on the basis of the rationalization
 that time is needed to get "ducks in a
 row"; that, time is needed to get the
 matter before the United Nations Secu-
 rity Council. No time was needed other
 than to lay the matter before the Secu-
 rity Council and tell it that we were
 willing to support the Council's taking
 jurisdiction.
 I know what is going on, in part, in
 regard to this position.  The President
 is aware of 'a rising opposition to him
 at the grassroots of America for his fail-
 ure to take the problem to the United
 Nations.
 Now he is talking, in his press confer-
 ence of last Wednesday, about sending
 Ambassador Goldberg to the United Na-
 tions with a letter to U Thant. That is
 merely a lot of semantics.  He should
 have sent the Ambassador to the United
 Nations with a resolution in behalf of
 the United States, and Instructed the
 Ambassador to lay the matter before the
 Security Council,  That is what the
 President needs to do.
 There wl be plenty of time after we
 get that resolution formally before the
 Security Council, for all the negotia-
 tions alluded to by the Senator from
 Wisconsin.  There will be plent of time
 to consider, as I shall say later in my
 prepared manuscript later this afternon,
 for the negotiations and discussions to
 Some other nations may then come
 forward with different proposals, and
 out of the various offerings, I believe
 they will hammer, pout a final resolution
 that I pray to God will result in the
 United Nations taking jurisdiction in
 South Vietnam and ordering a cease-fire
 and bringing about the steps that I sin-
 cerely hope will bring this affair to an
 end.
 I yield now to the Senator from
 Wisconsin.
 Mr. PROXMIRE,  Mr. President, does
 not the Senator also overlook the fact
 that, as the President said in his speech
 on July 28, that on 15 occasions, working
 through 40 nations, we have sought to
 negotiate with the North Vietnamese,
 with the Communists?  We have tried
 again and again,  We have agreed to
 negotiate  any time,  anywhere,  with
 anyone.
 We are still persisting in that en-
 deavor.  As the President said, we are
 asking that all of the resources of the
 United Nations be used in this endeavor.
 The President may have decided that it
 would be Ineffective and impractical at
 the present time to go to the Security
 Council.  That decision is concurred in
 unanimously by every member of the
 United Nations.  Any nation could go
 to the Security Council.  However, none
 of them do.
 It would seem to me that it is wrong
 to say that the President has not taken
 such action as he could in an effort to
 try to bring an end to this tragic situa-
 tion and try to negotiate.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, my re-
 ply to the Senator from Wisconsin is
 that every so-called semantic offering of
 the President of the United States is
 accompanied by other language which
 rebuts his offer. All that the President
 has ever had to do with to send up a
 formal resolution and lay the matter be-
 fore the United Nations Security Coun-
 cil in accordance with the procedures of
 the United Nations Charter.
 Starting with the President's speech at
 Johns Hopkins, every public professing
 that he has made and all the peaceful
 overtures concerning Vietnam have been
 made while, at the same. time, he has
 been killing, as a result of his orders, boy
 after boy, and thousands of civilian peo-
 ple in South Vietnam.  He has attached
 to every one of his semantic offers, terms,
 conditions, and qualifications that made
 any hope of a United Nations jurisdic-
 tion fly out the window.
 The only way in which we can lay this
 matter, under the law, before the United
 Nations would be to submit a resolution.
 That is what I have been pleading for
 for 2 years.  I do not intend to haveany
 of the verbalism of the President of the
 United States fool me as to the fact that
 we have not formally and officially and
 in keeping with our obligations presented
 this matter to the United Nations.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The Senator from
 Oregon completely overlooks the fact
 that, while the President of the United
 States has again and again sought nego-
 tiations, he has most recently said that
 we will discuss the situation in Vietnam
 even on the conditions which have been
 implied or suggested by Hanoi-on their
 own conditions. Not a single time have
 the North Vietnamese or the Chinese
 Communists agreed to negotiate on any
 conditions, anywhere with us or anyone
 else.  Their answer has been "No, No,
 No".
 It would seem to me, under these cir-
 cumstances, that the President of the
 United States is not killing boys out
 there, and the Senator from Oregon
 knows it. We should recognize the fact
 that we are there at the request of the
 South Vietnamese Government, to help
 defend against Communist aggression.
 The North Vietnamese are doing the
 killing.  They are engaged in aggres-
 sion.  We are trying our best to defend
 the people of South Vietnam, and to
 negotiate.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, they are
 killing under the invitation of a group
 of puppet corruptionists, crooked polit-
 ical tyrants financed by the United
 States.  That is the sordid chapter of
 the history that we are writing.
 I cannot imagine a greater non sequi-
 tur policy than the position of our Gov-
 ernment that we are there at the invita-
 tion of the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment.  That is a group that we have
 set up. That is what history will re-
 cord.
 I love the Senator from Wisconsin.
 However, he and I could not be further
 apart then we are in respect to this great
 public issue.  We are as far apart as
 opposites can be.
 Mr. President, I shall go back and re-
 peat a couple of paragraphs of my text,
 because I believe they should be empha-
 sized.
 Today we have an American policy
 that views the United Nations Charter
 not as a solemn national obligation, but
 as impractical and inconvenient. Where
 is our national honor as pledged by our
 ratification of the U.N. Charter? Where
 is our word as a Nation that we will sub-
 mit to the Security Council any dispute
 to which we are a party and cannot re-
 solve by peaceful means?
 It is the policy of ignoring those obli-
 gations that is destroying the good word
 and the international honor of the
 United States.
 We are not obliged to find out first
 what the U.N. may do in Vietnam. We
 are not obliged to find out whether the
 interests of the United States will be ad-
 vanced  in  Vietnam  by  the  United
 Nations.  We are simply obliged to lay
 the issue before the U.N. That we have
 not done, and it is not being done by the
 various letters between U Thant and the
 American administration.
 The only letter to U Thant that will
 fulfill our treaty obligation is a letter
 asking him to lay the Vietnam issue be-
 fore the Security Council. It can be do ce
 that way.  The Korean aggression was
 done that way.  Once it was made the
 business of the Security Council, t tie
 United States had something to say

 Approved For Release 2003/1
 August 3, 1965          CONGRESSIONAL
 about what action the Security Council
 should take in Vietnam.
 There are many possible courses for
 the U.N. to follpw.  It could ask for a
 reconvening of the Geneva Conference
 of 1954. I have been asking for it for 2
 years. It could ask for the jurisdiction
 to be taken by the SEATO nations.  I
 have asked for that course to be followed
 for 2 years. It could ask the belligerents,
 including the Vietcong, to meet in con-
 -ference. It, could prescribe some precon-
 ditions or not.  There is a great variety
 of courses open to the U.N. But most of
 them are not open to the United States
 acting alone. We are the sole belliger-
 ent, for all practical purposes, on our
 side.  The Government of South Viet-
 nam is our creature, and it rises or falls
 according to the support it receives from
 the U.S. Treasury.  The men who run
 it live off American economic and mili-
 tary aid, without which they would all
 disappear  from  view.   As  President
 Johnson well knows, it is often not pos-
 sible for one element in, a conflict to
 impose its will on its opponent. Settle-
 ment more often. comes by the work of a
 third party who is able to arrange and
 negotiate and suggest alternatives and
 exert a third party opinion upon both
 sides.
 That is what the United Nations is
 supposed to do.  That is why disputes
 that the parties cannot settle themselves
 are supposed to be put before the Secu-
 rity Council.  Do we set up the United
 States above the interests of world
 peace? Do we believe that we have some
 security interest in Vietnam' so vital to
 our- national existence that the_ machin-
 ery mankind devised at the end of World
 War II to save future generations from
 the scourge of war  deserves to  be
 s, uttled?
 Speaking on television Sunday, the
 Nation heard the most respected figure
 in American military affairs, the senior
 Senator from Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL],
 point out that we have no vital American
 security interest at stake in Vietnam.
 That is a contention that many of us
 have been making here in the Senate for
 a long time. It is not a popular theme
 down at the Pentagon, but the Senator
 from Georgia knows it to be true, none-
 theless, and I am satisfied that the great
 bulk of the American people, also, know
 It to be true.
 What we are scorning the United Na-
 tions Charter for is not a vital strategic
 interest of the United States.  We are
 'scorning it because we think we have to
 save face.  We are scorning it because
 we believe that once we have put our
 American stamp upon a government in
 Saigon, we must send as much money
 and as many American boys as may be
 necessary to keep it going. We have al-
 ready shifted our policy from one of
 helping the Vietnamese to save them-
 selves to one of doing the job for them.
 What President Kennedy called a war the
 South Vietnamese must win for them-
 selves is now` overtly transformed into
 a war the United States must win for
 itself.  And President Johnson's , warn-
 ing of last summer that we must not
 send American boys to do what Asians
 must do for themselves is repudiated by
 RECORD - SENATE
 his own announcements of 125,000 troops
 to be sent to Vietnam.
 We think we are saving face in Viet-
 nam, but surely we are not saving free-
 dom. Again, as the Senator from Geor-
 gia stated to the Nation, the people of
 South, as well as North, Vietnam would
 probably elect a government headed by
 Ho Chi-minh if given a chance.  He
 pointed to another obvious but unpopu-
 lar truth, which is that no leadership has
 developed in South Vietnam despite our
 10 years of massive financial and mili-
 tary support and that the United States
 ,is better off out of such a country than
 to continue to fight with its own people
 for its existence.
 I note the Secretary of State felt
 obliged to deny the conclusion of the
 Senator from Georgia about sentiment
 among the people of South Vietnam. No
 doubt he feels all that money we have
 spent there must have produced at least
 some favorable result.
 Let me say f or the RECORD that I would
 rather have the opinion of the Senator
 from Georgia [Mr. RUSSELLI on the situ-
 ation in South Vietnam than that of 10
 Rusks, 10 McNamara's, 10 Bundy's, 10
 Lodge's, 10 of each of those responsible
 for the blueprint who have gotten us
 into this shocking, embarrassing situa-
 tion in southeast Asia.
 Why not hold the election and find
 out?
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE. I yield.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Come on, Senator,
 does the Senator agree-really feel-that
 North Vietnam, a police state, will per-
 mit an unrigged vote or even could?
 North Vietnam is completely dominated
 and controlled by the Communist Party.
 The people of North Vietnam have avail-
 able to them only such information as
 the government wants them to have.
 They see the world strictly through
 Communist eyes.
 There are more people in North Viet-
 nam than in South Vietnam. We know
 that there are Communists in South
 Vietnam who might vote for Ho Chi-
 minh. And under present circumstances
 North Vietnam would vote as they do in
 Russia and China-unanimously. Would
 not the kind of election the Senator from
 .Oregon is proposing result in a sure,
 predictable, grossly rigged takeover in
 South Vietnam by the Communist Party?
 Would this not result in virtually un-
 precedented genocide and destruction of
 the people of South Vietnam?
 Mr. MORSE. I shall reply briefly now,
 and at greater length later.  There are
 so many false premises in that list of
 pretty interesting premises laid down in
 the question of the Senator from Wis-
 consin that I must reply briefly to a few
 of them. The Senator from Oregon says
 North Vietnam is a different kind of
 Communist country from. Red China or
 Red Russia, The Senator from Wiscon-
 . sin is talking about communism, as so
 many people do, in blanket terms.  The
 type of appeals to the inhabitants of
 North Vietnam, the type of municipal
 governments they are allowed to operate
 in many of the towns and cities of North
 .Vietnam, would lead me to characterize
 1 /04 .: CIA-RDP67B00446R000300190001-8
 that part of the regime more as approx-
 imating a Socialist government than
 Chinese or Russian communism.  Ho
 Chi-minh, who was, not long ago, a hero,
 is a paradox of contradictions and po-
 litical ideologies.  He has a surprising
 amount of procedures within his gov-
 ernment that the Senator and I would
 call democratic procedures. But the fact
 remains that North Vietnam is a Com-
 munist country, and I despise it, as I de-
 spise all forms of communism. But I am
 not going to be a party along with the
 Senator from Wisconsin in agreeing to a
 blanket characterization of North Viet-
 nam as a Communist state, leaving the
 implication that it is the same as other
 Communist states.
 Next, the Senator from Oregon has not
 been talking about North Vietnam under
 a trusteeship and protectorate.  I have
 been speaking for the right of the people
 of South Vietnam to determine their
 government.  The Geneva accords did
 not set up a government in South Viet-
 nam.  The United States did that, in
 clear and open violation of the Geneva
 accords of 1954.
 The record is also clear that there has
 been little more political freedom in
 South Vietnam than in the North.
 Candidates for office are as carefully
 screened there as in the Communist
 zone.
 I have always pleaded, and will plead
 again, to set the record straight, for a
 supervised election in both zones under
 which the people would have the right of
 self-determination, under the doctrine,
 which we profess but of which we have
 become notably in violation.  I would
 give to the people of South Vietnam the
 right of self-determination.  But-and
 this is what the Senator from Georgia
 was talking about-if we went to an
 election in South Vietnam, either Ho
 Chi-minh or his candidates would win in
 South Vietnam.  That is what has re-
 sulted from the deterioration of Ameri-
 can policy in South Vietnam.
 That is why I say I completely dis-
 count any appraisal of the Secretary of
 State.  The Secretary of State, the Sec-
 retary of Defense, Bundy, Lodge, and
 Taylor, have been dead wrong on 'each
 of their representations on Vietnam
 that I do not find them to be reliable wit-
 nesses at all with respect to South Viet-
 nam.
 If the Senator will bear with me a
 while longer, he will find in my speech
 that I shall again propose a United Na-
 tions protectorate of South Vietnam.
 That does not mean that we would have
 North Vietnam rule South Vietnam.
 That does not mean we would have
 what the Senator from Wisconsin is
 alluding to, a so-called blood bath in
 South Vietnam.  As the Senator from
 Wisconsin  knows,  the  Senator  from
 Oregon would always insist on a pro-
 cedure that does not let the Vietcong kill
 South Vietnamese in a blood bath or
 that does not let the South Vietnamese
 kill the Vietcong in a blood bath. But
 when it comes to methods and cruelties
 and terrorism in South Vietnam, the
 South Vietnamese are no different from
 the Vietcong.

 Wednesday, at long last the Inter-
 national Red Cross has found it neces-
 sary to take cognizance of man's inhu-
 manity to man there by both the Viet-
 cong and the South Vietnamese.
 There must be a protectorate there.
 I have also called it a trusteeship, I do
 not care what label is used._. But it must
 be a third party trusteeship, just as
 Franklin Roosevelt, 20 years ago at
 Teheran and Cairo, proposed for all
 Indochina.
 But now we have the trouble spot in
 South Vietnam.  At the very least now,
 we should move in, through a concert
 of nations, to change the situation in
 South Vietnam, from one of warmaking
 to one of enforcing the peace.
 I do not know what the United Nations
 may decide, but I am willing to talk with
 the Senator from Wisconsin about some
 hypothetical questions.  I would not be
 in the least surprised if the United Na-
 tions decided to take jurisdiction either
 under the Security Council or through
 the General Assembly, and then to set
 up a protectorate, and that their first
 demand would be for a ceasefire.
 I would pray for that.  I would also
 pray for bringing the killing to an end
 on an sides, and to send in whatever
 number of divisions of many nations
 Would be,necessary-as I say later in my
 sp eeh-to enforce that ceasefire.
 Ili' anyone believes that a ceaseflre will
 end the shooting 100 percent, he could
 not be more wrong. It did not do so in
 the Congo.  It has not done so in the
 Gaza Strip. It has not, done so in Cy-
 prus, It has not done so in the Kashmir.
 But, It ismt~ch better than a full-fledged
 aar, and offers a much better hope for
 ;mankind to lead itself into the path
 of  peace  rather  than  to  complete
 destruction.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.       Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr... MORSE.    I yield.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.        Of course, we all
 wish for a ceasefire, and we all wish to
 stop the killing.  The question I asked
 -the Senator from Oregon, however, was
 in response to his question, "Why not
 hold elections and find out?"  He is
 talking, about Vietnamwide elections, is
 he not?
 Mr. MORSE. Elections in both South
 Vietnam and North Vietnam.  There is
 no question about what North Vietnam
 would do. Let me say respectfully to the
 Senator from Wisconsin that I believe
 we are 10 years away from an election.
 We must have a protectorate for 10 years
 before we can have an election on uni-
 fication.  That is the United States do-
 ing, back in 1956.
 Mr. PROXTVIIRE.  I am talking about
 what the Senator is proposing, a Viet-
 namwide national election. In that kind
 of election--
 Mr. MORSE.  The Senator is wrong.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.    Ho Chi-minh, of
 course, would have a big advantage.
 Mr. MORSE. The Senator is wrong.
 I am proposing an election In North Viet-
 nam, and I am proposing one in South
 Vietnam; but I am also saying that Ho
 Chi-minh would win in South Vietnam
 probably with 80 to 9o percent of the
 votes. Once we get out of Saigon, sup-
 port for the puppet administration which
 the United States Is financing vanishes.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The Senator says
 and I read word for word from the text
 of his prepared speech:
 Ho Chi-mink's followers or General Ky's
 followers would win a nationwide election
 throughout all of Vietnam.
 Perhaps the Senator does not mean
 what he says, but his statement certainly
 is clear to me.  It means a nationwide
 election between the followers of the
 present government in South Vietnam
 and followers of the government in North
 Vietnam. If it does not mean that, it does
 not mean anything.
 Mr. MORSE. The Senator from Wis-
 consin refuses to take into account that
 back of it is the United Nations' protec-
 torate. The United States must find out
 what the feeling is in South Vietnam,
 and what the feeling is in North Viet-
 nam in regard to support for certain
 parties, if any; and, of course, they
 should find out what the support and
 feeling is in regard to unification at the
 present time. But, that is not going to
 create unification at the present time.
 If we have a protectorate, the protec-
 torate is not going to vanish.  In my
 judgment,. we must have a United Na-
 tions protectoratein Vietnam for prob-
 ably up to 10 years in this particular
 trouble spot of the world.
 Mr. President, if the Geneva Agree-
 ment of 1954 is now good enough for us,
 why not permit the canceled election to
 proceed? There is nothing to be proved
 by arguing in the United States whether
 Ho Chi Minh's followers or General Ky's
 followers would win a nationwide elec-
 tion throughout all of Vietnam.  Only
 the people in Vietnam can settle that
 question.  The Geneva Accord states
 that such an election was to have been
 held in 1956 under the supervision of the
 International   Control Commission.
 Discussions were to have taken place be-
 tween officials of the North and South to
 settle the details of time and place of
 voting.
 It was at that point that the United
 States and South Vietnam junked the
 Geneva Agreement because we were
 afraid of what the outcome of the elec-
 tion might be.
 But now President Johnson is talking
 again of the possibility of nationwide
 elections there.  Let us go ahead with
 them. At least we would uphold the ele-
 ment of our national honor which pro-
 fesses great confidence and belief in
 self-determination.
 An election of this kind, too, is some-
 thing that might be better advanced
 through the United Nations than by the
 United States speaking alone.
 Finally, I note that the Washington
 Post editorial, and the Senator from Wis-
 consin in referring to it, regard the po-
 tential veto of the Soviet Union as the
 total obstacle to U.N. action. Of course,
 the possibility of a veto has no bearing
 whatever upon the procedures that are
 mandatory under the terms of the char-
 ter.                                                                                              To talk about a possible veto as a
 reason for not going to the Security
 Council is not to talk about a reason, but
 an excuse. Guesses as to what the Soviet
 Union might do are nought but excuses
 for not fulfilling our legal duties.
 But how do we know what the Soviet
 Union will veto?  We have not put any
 course of action for Vietnam before the
 Council.  Probably there are many po-
 tential U.N. actions that the Soviet Unio.-i
 would veto.  Probably there are some
 that France and China would veto, too.
 But until we make a suggestion for U.N.
 action, we have not the slightest idea
 what Russia might veto. And it is also
 entirely possible that the Soviet Unio i
 might make a proposal that would prove
 workable.
 The Soviet Union did not veto the
 Cyprus peace mission. We tried to keep
 Cyprus out of the United Nations, too,
 because we wanted to handle it through
 NATO, and we used the excuse that if :.t
 went to the Security Council, Russia
 would veto it. But the Cyprus issue was
 put before the Security Council, anyway,
 and the peace mission was sent without
 a Soviet veto.
 I have no way of knowing whether the
 Soviet position would be the same cr
 different on Vietnam; but neither do
 those who wave the flag of a Soviet veto
 as an excuse for not going to the United
 Nations.
 I would also point out that they ale
 already giving not only the Soviet Union,
 but North Vietnam a veto over U.N.
 action.  We  read  again  today  that
 Hanoi has ruled out any United Na-
 tions intervention until the American
 troops have left. Why should Hanoi be
 given great power status at the United
 Nations? Why do we give her an equal
 weight in the Security Council with the
 other five great powers?  Yet we do it
 every time we point to Hanoi's objections
 to U.N. action as a reason for not taking
 action through the United Nations.  It s
 not for North Vietnam to say what action
 the United Nations may or may not
 take in cases of a threat to interna-
 tional peace, any more than It was
 North  Korea's.  North  Korea       was
 not a member of the United Nations.
 We did not give North Korea a veto
 power. We laid it before the United Na-
 tions Security Council and the United
 Nations took jurisdiction.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Oregon yield at that
 point?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. T i -
 DINGS in the chair). Does the Senator
 from Oregon yield to the Senator from
 Wisconsin?
 Mr. MORSE. I am glad to yield.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The Senator from
 Oregon knows very well what happened
 in the Korean situation, that the Soviet
 Union was boycotting the Security Cour..-
 oil.                                                                                              It was not present and, therefore,
 could not physically exercise its veto.
 This was a fortuitous happening from
 our standpoint. That is not the situation
 today. I doubt whether the Soviet Union
 will be caught napping again, certainly
 not in the South Vietnamese situation.
 Mr. MORSE.  The Soviet Union was
 not caught napping in North Korea, in

 my judgment. She found it a convenient
 way for sending the problem to the Secu-
 rity Council, but she stayed for Cyprus.
 In thinking about the Cyprus situation,
 .the United States had to get kicked back
 into the United Nations on Cyprus.
 France and Russia were the leaders in
 support of Security Council action in
 Cyprus.
 That is a good precedent to wrap
 around Russia's neck in any debate in
 the Security Council, over the matter of
 jurisdiction in connection with th.e crisis
 in South Vietnam.
 Let me say to the Senator from Wis-
 consin that we do not know until we try.
 This is the argument which the Secre-
 tary of State has been advancing for
 almost 2 years, before the Committee on
 Foreign Relations; and I keep saying to
 him :
 W. Secretary, why do you not find out?
 Why do you stop reading the charter?  Go
 ahead and read the rest of the charter; and
 if Russia does veto it, you have proved to
 the world by that veto who it is that does not
 wish to follow the rules of law for settling
 the threat to the peace of the world. Take
 them to the General Assembly, and I will tell
 you how many I believe'you would get there-
 a minimum of 90.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  This is exactly what
 the Senator from Oregon and I disagree
 on.
 Mr. MORSE.  Try it.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  It seems to me that
 we cannot determine foreign policy on
 the floor of the Senate.  It seems to me
 that-
 Mr. MORSE.                We certainly could not
 do a worse job than the one which is now
 being done in the State Department.
 Mr. Pf OXMIRE.  it seems to me, that
 without very careful preparation with
 Russia, without knowing precisely what
 Russia is likely to do, it would be an ex-
 ercise in futility, or worse-it could
 mean  premature repudiation. . That
 could forestall constructive agreements
 later.
 There may come a propitious time,
 and it is very important that that time
 be prepared for with the greatest care.
 Russia might very well absent herself
 under the right kind of circumstances,
 but it is very important that they be
 fully prepared in advance.  This 'must
 be done in a way so that it will work.
 It is not wise that we move in merely
 because we can do so under the charter,
 technically.  That does not make any
 sense to me. That is exercising the most
 futile kind of diplomacy.
 Mr. MORSE.      It may not make any
 sense to the Senator from Wisconsin,
 but it was right in 1954.  That is how
 long it has been right.    The argument
 is made that. we must have more time to
 put our ducks in a line.   That is what
 the Senator argues.  It is argued that
 we must have more time to get ready
 to see what Russia will do.
 I do not believe in that kind of secret
 diplomacy.  The American people are
 entitled to have the President and the
 Secretary of State out in the open, with
 open covenants openly arrived at.  In
 regard to the war in South Vietnam,
 they are entitled to have the President
 and the? Secretary' of State take them
 into their confidence. They are entitled
 to have their President and their Sec-
 retary of State follow the clear proce-
 dures of the United Nations Charter, and
 to file a resolution, or to use one of the
 alternatives.
 At the request of the President I have
 worked hard on the international law
 aspects, to give him a memorandum
 which would provide for an alternative
 resolution.
 I do not quote the President, but his
 advisers have found no fault with the
 legal analysis of the Senator from Ore-
 gon.  We get from them the argument
 that the Senator from Wisconsin has
 made, that they doubt that it is prac-
 tical. Of course, my good-natured reply
 is, "Why not find out?" If it is npt prac-
 tical, let us find out.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The Senator from
 Oregon, who is an extremely experienced
 man in these matters, and who has been
 a member of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee for many years, knows perfectly
 well that we cannot discuss all these
 matters publicly.  He knows that it
 might be extremely embarrassing to Rus-
 sia because of her relationship with
 China and North Vietnam. That would
 be true under certain circumstances. He
 knows that these things must be dis-
 cussed privately; otherwise there would
 be very little chance of success.
 The Senator from Wisconsin takes the
 position that that time may never arrive.
 On the other hand, the time may come.
 Mr. MORSE.  I fear that that is the
 Senator's position.
 Mr.  PROXMIRE.  The  time  may
 never come.  If it does not come, the
 President would have been mistaken to
 go to the Security Council. He might
 suffer an action that might be extremely
 adverse to our interest and the interest
 of freedom and, in the long run, adverse
 to the interest of peace. There may be
 other ways of achieving this than by
 relying on the Security Council or of the
 General Assembly, that could be prej-
 udiced by such an action.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, the Sena-
 tor has outlined the difference of opin-
 ion that he has with me.
 It is not possible to have a rule of law
 on the basis of responding as an outlaw
 to one's responsibility as a signatory to
 a treaty.  That is where the Senator
 from Wisconsin and I part company.
 I believe that we have an obligation
 to take these matters to the United. Na-
 tions. I disassociate myself from what I
 consider to be the implication of the
 Senator from Wisconsin, that he thinks it
 is perfectly all right for our Government
 to engage in so-called secret diplomacy.
 That can mean the difference between
 life and death for millions of Americans.
 We cannot even gain access to it, as the
 elected representatives of the people in
 Congress.  They tell us what they want
 to tell us, and no more. I am a great
 advocate of _ Woodrow Wilson's policies,
 one of which was open covenants, openly
 arrived at; and also of Woodrow Wilson's
 concept as to the constitutional duties
 of a President of the United States. He
 enunciated that principle in Congress in
 the historic joint session of Congress on
 the night of April 2, 1917, when he
 pointed out to Congress that it was his
 constitutional duty to come to a joint
 session of Congress and make a recom-
 mendation for a declaration of war, and
 that he was without constitutional au-
 thority to make war in the absence of
 a declaration of war.
 I thought, as an old teacher, that it
 might be helpful for the record to get
 that lesson from Woodrow Wilson into
 the RECORD, which I did last Wednesday,
 for the edification of my President.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. The Senator is tak-
 ing the position that the United States
 is wrong, and he has previously said that
 our hands are dripping with blood.  He
 says that although 'the President of the
 United States has said again and again
 that he wants to negotiate, has indicated
 that he is willing to go along with the
 17 so-called neutral nations, and has
 turned to the United Nations, for ex-
 ample, by asking the Secretary General
 to use his office for intervening, and so
 forth.
 Despite all that, the Senator from
 Oregon now says that he is going to give
 the United States no choice, but that we
 must act at once, that we must move into
 the Security Council, without any pre-
 paratory action at all; that we must act
 at once, and that we alone among all
 nations must conduct our negotiations
 in public, in the headlines, in front of
 the world.  I submit that the Senator
 from Oregon is really handcuffing our
 Government,  and  suggesting rules of
 procedure that the Communists do not
 care about.
 There are moral forces, of course, of
 which we must be aware, and we must do
 all we can to play by the rules.  How-
 ever, this world is not a Sunday school.
 We must do our best and recognize that
 we must act with all the moral means
 that we can find, and always with moral
 ends.  However, at the same time, it is
 proper, it seems to me, to operate dis-
 creetly and try to persuade nations to
 come around to our view quietly and pri-
 vately in a way which would do the most
 good.
 Also, we must time our action in ac-
 cordance with our best judgment as to
 what action can best secure peace. This
 Nation wants peace. The Senator from
 Oregon has never said that this Nation
 wants to get any territorial benefit out
 of the the war in Vietnam, or that we
 want to get any economic benefit out of
 Vietnam.
 In that sense the Senator from Oregon
 would agree that our hands are clean,
 and that all we want is peace.
 What we disagree on is the tactics.
 I say that we should give our country
 an opportunity to work with weapons
 which will enable us to win the peace.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I disagree
 with the Senator not only on tactics, but
 also on the fundamental and basic policy
 of our country in Vietnam.
 Let me make these comments on the
 verbalistic and semantic offerings of the
 President of the United States.  I dis-
 agree. In each one he has a sleeper
 clause and terms and conditions that
 make impossible his professings of his
 -desire for peace, and make impossible
 getting the results that he would like to
 have the people think he is seeking.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 The Senator has heard me say many
 times that I do not pay much attention
 to what politicians say, unless what they
 say can be squared with their actions.
 So the President has caused me to
 come to the conclusion that until he is
 willing to keep our Nation's trust under
 the United Nations Charter by filing a
 resolution calling for United Nations ac-
 tion, it does not make much difference
 what he says.
 The Senator from Wisconsin  [Mr.
 PROXMIRE] again talks about time. We
 must have time.
 We have had time since 1954.  We
 have been a wrongdoer since 1954. We
 have had all the time many, manifold,
 than any nation should need if it really
 wants to correct a wrong course of action.
 - The  Senator  talks  about our ob-
 jectives in South Vietnam. I will state to
 the Senator from Wisconsin that in the
 opinion of the senior Senator from Ore-
 gon they are not as lilywhite as he would
 have us believe from his rhetorical ques-
 tions.
 The Senator has also heard me say
 many times on the floor of the Senate
 that I am satisfied that the major top
 polcymakers in the Pentagon are aiming
 at preventive war against China.  That
 is- what they are after.  The President
 should call them off-and quickly.
 The  Senator from         Wisconsin has
 heard me say many times during the
 past 2 years since that the first demon-
 stration of nuclear power on the part of
 Red China that we have those in the
 Pentagon who wish to bomb those
 Chinese nuclear installations. The Sen-
 ator has heard me say that when we do
 I am satisfied that Red China will come
 in. They have no alternative. The Sen-
 ator has heard me say that I am satis-
 fled that Red Russia will come in, and
 when Red Russia comes in they will
 not pick China as the battlefield for her
 war.
 The great danger is that the President
 of the United States and his advisers
 are leading the United States to the
 brink  of total war.  The  American
 people had better recognize it before
 it is too late.
 Mr. President, I do not like to find
 myself in such complete disagreement
 with my friend the Senator from Wis-
 consin, or with my President, but I feel
 that I have a solemn trust to continue
 to do what I can do to change the course
 of action of the United States from one
 of warmaking, which is unconscionable
 and illegal, to one of peacekeeping, which
 would accrue to the everlasting historic
 credit of this generation.
 I do not believe the United states
 should continue to allow its projections
 of the views of others guide our policy
 at the United Nations. Our treaty obli-
 gations are a far more binding guide
 than the views of North Vietnam, or even
 the potential veto of the Soviet Union.
 I think the objectors to U.N. action
 also ignore the interest Russia itself has
 in confining the Vietnam war. A peace
 mission, sent to Vietnam to keep the
 peace, could be as useful to the Soviet
 Union as to the rest of the world.  A
 peace mission to' Vietnam would have
 much the same role as it has had in the
 Middle East, in the Congo, and in Cyprus.
 Its function would be to pacify; but if it
 were attacked or its peacekeeping opera-
 tions threatened by any party, it would
 shoot back. That should be its function
 in South Vietnam.  If such a mission
 could be established, it would be a great
 improvement over the current "pacifica-
 tion" whereby American troops are going
 to fight the Vietcong while the South
 Vietnamese forces try to establish gov-
 ernment control behind the lines.
 That kind of operation, which is the
 arrangement advocated by General Ky,
 only means that Americans will bear the
 brunt of the fighting, kill the villagers
 along with the Vietcong, bring in our B-
 52  heavy  bombers  for  their  indis-
 criminate support value, and provide an
 umbrella for General Ky and his feeble
 army to establish themselves in the rear.
 Do the Senator from Wisconsin and
 the Washington Post want to call that
 kind of war preferable to a United Na-
 tions mission?  I do not doubt that
 deaths will occur even among a peace-
 keeping  operation.  They  occurred  in
 the Congo. But there was a vast differ-
 ence between the rebels in the Congo
 fighting the United Nations and rebels in
 the Congo fighting American troops sent
 in to prop up a government of our own
 choosing.
 The plain fact is that South Vietnam is
 in no better condition to govern itself
 than was the Congo. It has many more
 elements of leadership that could de-
 velop into a meaningful government; but
 at the present time, it cannot furnish a
 government and it has not furnished one
 out of its own resources for 10 years.
 South Vietnam should be a United Na-
 tions protectorate. It should be policed
 by a United Nations force to. maintain
 peace and order until such time as a re-
 unification election can be held or some
 other political disposition made of its
 future.
 I am not impressed by any of the ex-
 cuses that have been offered by the ad-
 ministration, by the press, or on the
 Senate floor for the continued flouting
 of the United Nations Charter.  I find
 it a shocking and appalling situation
 when the United States of America an-
 nounces itself embarked on a war in
 which we have undergone no attack
 whatever, a war 8,000 miles from our own
 shores, and in which American security
 interests are not at stake, without so
 much as a nod at the United Nations
 Charter. What a travesty upon the ef-
 forts of those who believed an Atlantic
 Charter and a United Nations was an
 essential political objective of World War
 II. What a repudiation of the principles
 we have preached for 20 years. What a
 deplorable precedent we are setting for
 the other nations of the world, whom we
 constantly implore to follow our example.
 Sukarno's Indonesia left the United
 Nations when it found the organization
 no longer served Its international pur-
 poses.                                                             The Soviet Union has stalked
 out from time to time when displeased
 by U.N. actions. But the United States
 merely calls it impractical and engages
 In war without reference to its charter.
 Is it possible that the American people
 are prepared to see their Government
 continue to escalate such a war without
 ever demanding that we live up to the
 U.N. Charter?  Is it possible that our
 people will support an American war in
 Asia that is prosecuted by us just as
 though the United Nations was never
 created? I find that there is an increas-
 ing outcry among our population that we
 have pushed the Vietnam war far enough,
 and that it is time to live up to some of
 the international obligations we under-
 took 20 years ago in order to control fu-
 ture wars.
 I ask unanimous consent to have!
 printed at the conclusion of these re-
 marks correspondence I have received in
 just the last week on this subject.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 CONGRESS  MUST  REMAIN  IN  SESSION
 Mr. MORSE.        Mr. President, in my
 trip across the country and back since
 I spoke on the floor of the Senate lass
 Wednesday, I have been alarmed by the
 rising denunciation of the President
 and his administration for their Viet-
 nam policy. I have heard the word "im -
 peach" used more often in the last week
 than I have heard it since President Tru-
 man sacked General MacArthur. I have
 been asked by more people than I would
 have thought possible if there is not
 grounds for impeachment of the Presi-
 dent, and how the process can be set in
 motion.  I have been advised about pe-
 titions that have been circulated and
 hundreds of people are signing asking
 for the President's impeachment.
 Much of this talk stems from objec-
 tions to a war being undertaken without
 congressional declaration. Most of these
 people see the President as waging an
 executive war in violation of the Consti-
 tution.  They think the impeachment
 clauses of the Constitution must apply
 to such a case.
 I do not think that those of us who
 want this administration to succeed in
 its objectives of peace and prosperity
 should be thinking of going home when
 it is coming under such fire as that. The
 President and his administration are
 going to need all the help and advice
 they can get from Congress on Vietnam
 this fall. It is time they gave ear to the
 views of the Senator from Georgia and
 the Senator from Montana, who appar-
 ently finally got the word through to the
 White House that there is a lot more
 acquiescence than genuine support in
 Congress for the Vietnam war.  The
 Democratic Party has put up a verbs.l
 facade to protect a President of its own
 party.  It has muted or stifled its criti-
 cism, except for a few voices like mine
 and that of the Senator from Alaska
 [Mr. GRUENING].
 But the facade is very close to crack-
 ing. When the welfare of the Nation is
 at stake, the desire to keep up appear-
 ances is less controlling than the desire
 to keep the Nation from making a
 ghastly mistake.
 Members of Congress of both parties
 will serve their President a lot better by
 being here to tell him the truth than by
 adjourning and leaving his ears to the
 exclusive talk of the McNamaras and the
 Lodges and the Bundys and the Rusks
 and the other architects of Asian policy

 who dug us into this pit in the first
 place. The President's advisers on Viet-
 nam have a frightening record of having
 been wrong over and over again about
 the situation in that unfortunate coun-
 try. They have misled the President and
 they have misled the country.  Their
 estimates of the; situation have been
 wrong, and their prescriptions of what
 to do about it have been wrong.
 Congress could do no worse than they
 have done. And in fact, we would serve
 the President better by open and honest
 debate on Vietnam than we have served
 him by going along, sight unseen, with
 whatever the McNamara-Lodge-Bundy
 cabal has proposed. As the war worsens,
 and as the additional 50,000 soldiers are
 sent to Vietnam, and as the draft calls
 go up, the criticism of-the President is
 going to increase. He will need friends
 in Congress then, and he will need some
 advisers who, like the Senators from
 "Georgia and Montana, have a perspec-
 tive on American interests that is lack-
 ing among the White House advisers.
 The American people respect the views
 of these Members of Congress, and the
 administration would do well to attend
 to them, as well.
 This is no time for Congress to take
 a walk, and leave the war up to the
 President. We should remain in session
 until January 1.
 We should never overlook the fact that
 under the Constitution of the United
 States, Congress has the solemn obliga-
 tion to function as an effective check
 upon the President and the executive
 branch of the Government. The Presi-
 dent, too, has his checks upon Congress.
 But in my judgment, with American boys
 dying  in Vietnam,  Congress  cannot
 justify any sine the adjournment.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Let me tell you that
 I fully support your stand on Vietnam and
 am glad some others are now seeing the light.
 Enclosed is an article of mine on the sub-
 ject.
 It is my understanding that whatever com-
 mitment we have to the Vietnam Govern-
 ment is an Executive commitment.  There
 has been no treaty with the advice and con-
 sent of the Senate.   Is this not correct?
 Furthermore weren't whatever commitments
 which have been made made with disregard
 of the Senate and national sense of disap-
 proval of any involvement in Vietnam about
 1954?
 Also, could you tell me what effect presi-
 dent Johnson's speech before the U.N. in
 June has in bringing this issue before the
 U.N.?  What further steps need to be taken
 on the part of the U.S. Government?
 Sincerely,
 KERMIT J. RoFWE.
 P.S.-If you have any good suggestions as
 to what further I can do to support you in
 this matter, let me have them.

 VIETNAM QUESTIONS
 (By Kermit Rohde, professor of psychology)
 What are some of the questions which
 could and should be asked about Vietnam?
 First, what is our purpose for being in Viet-
 nam?
 That we must honor our commitment to
 the South Vietnamese governments is not an
 answer.  The Government to which we made
 this  commitment  was  overthrown,  not
 legally  changed,  and many  subsequent
 changes by force have occurred.  The origi-
 nal government itself became illegal when
 it refused to hold free elections in 1956 and
 thereby to carry out the 1954 Geneva agree-
 ment terms under which it was established.
 Furthermore we committed ourselves pub-
 licly to nations of the world to uphold the
 Geneva agreement which requires us not to
 interfere in Vietnam.
 That we are fighting for freedom is not an
 answer.  During the. 1954-58 period when
 there was peace in Vietnam, we stood firmly
 behind the Diem government as it abolished
 a 40-year old tradition of electing village
 chiefs.  President  Eisenhower  and  Diem
 scuttled the holding of free elections on a
 nationwide basis in 1956 as planned in the
 Geneva Awards. Since then the governments
 that have been formed have been military
 dictatorships  overt  or  covert. Our Diem
 regime, the only one which had a peaceful
 period in which to work, was the most cruel
 and repressive, especially of religious free-
 doms.
 Do we fight for the people of Vietnam?
 The reason General Eisenhower gave for
 overthrowing the planned elections in 1956
 was that 80 percent would vote against those
 we wanted to rule.  There is evidence that
 even the Vietnamese Army is against us.
 Eighty percent of the arms of the Vietcong
 come from the United States much of this as
 a near gift from the Vietnamese Army.  As
 testified by U.S. military men, the Vietnamese
 have used such delivery tactics as marching
 into jungles, carefully laying down their
 arms and running when a shot is fired at
 them.
 Furthermore Vietcong fights a guerrilla
 war.  It is generally conceded that one can-
 not fight a guerrilla war without a friendly
 populace. As Mao, the Chinese expert puts
 it "The guerrilla must be able to move among
 friendly people as fish in a sea." How is it
 possible that huge supplies sufficient to sus-
 tain                                                                         Vietcong forces  which  are strongest
 around Saigon are obtainable?  Saigon at a
 minimum is 500 miles from North Vietnam,
 the nearest friendly source.  Needn't there
 be local friends for direct contributions or
 to facilitate transport?
 It seems unlikely that the Vietnamese are
 cooperative  with  Vietcong   through  force.
 The greatest use of force and terror in our
 time, that by the Nazis and the Japanese, did
 not make unfriendly European and Asian
 peoples cooperative during World War U.
 The answer that we are fighting commu-
 nism brings up other questions.  Is it true
 that the elected president of the Vietcong,
 Nguyen Huu The, never has been a Com-
 munist, and that only one of his vice presi-
 dents has been a Communist?       Are we to
 militarily oppose communism everywhere?
 Are we to militarily engage all types of com-
 munism, the Russian, the Chinese, the Yugo-
 slav, the North Vietnamese type, the Cuban
 Marxism?  Why only Vietnam now?
 The answer that the safety of our Nation
 brings up other questions.  President Eisen-
 hower stated that the price of his famous
 settlement of the Korean dispute was the
 loss of southeast Asia Including Vietnam.
 If the loss of Vietnam makes our Nation
 powerless in its own defense, did President
 Eisenhower sell his country down the river
 for a political advantage or has the impor-
 tance of Vietnam changed?  If it has changed
 what has brought about this change?
 Just exactly and specifically what is the
 great harm which will occur if we do not
 control a nation on the other side of the
 earth?  If Vietnam Is really the key to our
 18421
 safety, what will we do should we lose it?
 Dissolve  our  Nation?   Pull  back to  the
 Hawaiian Islands?  Pull back to the Pacific
 Ocean?
 The second major question one could ask
 is, How practicable is our present plan?
 We are bombing North Vietnam. Why?
 The March  1965 white paper of the U.S.
 Government simply supports earlier esti-
 mates that the Vietcong was mainly a South
 Vietnam movement at that time-only 10
 to 20 percent of the aid comes from outside.
 Almost all of the captured soldiers men-
 tioned, though trained in the north, are na-
 tive born South Vietnamese.
 Can North Vietnam force the war to stop?
 North Vietnam did use its influence to get
 warfare to cease in the south during the
 1954-58 period by selling the Vietcong on
 the idea that 1956 free elections would be
 held as promised by the United States and
 others.  After this betrayal, can the north
 again sell the Vietcong on the good faith of
 the United States or anyone associated with
 it?
 Furthermore, the known morale effects of
 strategic bombing, ever since the Spanish
 civil war, are yo create opposition and to
 harden it. The military effects are negligi-
 ble.  Analysis  of  World  War  U  strategic
 bombing shows that it contributed negligibly
 to military victory. In North Korea, 1950-52,
 the only effect of bombing was to demoralize
 the U.S. Air Force Involved.  I knew those
 airmen well. Indeed Secretary Bundy ad-
 mitted recently on "Meet the Press" that
 bombing has had no visible effect on the
 war. The present allegations that North Viet-
 namese regulars are now fighting indicate
 that It may have had the predictable effect
 of making the war more difficult for the
 United States.
 To fight against guerrilla war takes a ratio
 of 10 to 15 to 1.  On Malaya, it took 350,000
 troops 13 years to win against 8,000 guer-
 rillas.  One-fourth of the officers in the U.S.
 ground forces are now involved in this war.
 If we involve North Vietnam, is it to be
 noted that North Vietnam has an army twice
 the size that Japan had in southeast Asia
 during World War II.  Are we going to con-
 tinue to tie up these large military forces in
 Vietnam?  Will we want to do so for many
 years?
 Vietnam has had a 1,000-year-old tradition
 of resisting China.  He Chi Minh, the leader
 of North Vietnam, has spent years in a Red
 Chinese prison.   There are 16 million people
 in North Vietnam.  Isn't it possible for such
 a group to remain independent of Red China
 as it is for little Finland with only 4 million
 to remain free of the Soviet Union?  Isn't it
 possible that our bombing or further attack-
 ing of North Vietnam will weaken the will
 to resist Red China and enable Red China
 to enter and control North Vietnam?
 .  It is to be noted here that though there
 is general agreement that Red China is hap-
 pier than we over the fight the Vietcong puts
 up, no responsible authority, even our Gov-
 ernment who has every reason to do so, con-
 tends and offers evidence that Red China
 controls Nort.i Vietnam or the Vietcong.  In
 short aren't we  operating to extend Red
 Chinese control in southeast Asia?  As Chou
 En-Lai said "Once we worried about south-
 east Asia.  We don't any more.  The Ameri-
 cans are rapidly solving our problems for
 us'
 Besides these practical questions there are
 legal and moral questions such as where
 would we stand with regard to the principles
 used for judgment at the Nuremberg trials?
 But these I leave for others.
 These are merely some of the questions
 which could and should be asked and to
 which I would like answers and some straight
 answers.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 [From the Oregon State University Daily
 Barometer, May 19, 1965]
 INHUMANE WAR?
 (By Amos Roos, 1965, engineering)
 The war we are pursuing in Vietnam is
 even more inhumane than wars usually are.
 Prisoners of war are tortured in most In-
 genious ways, barbaric beyond comprehen-
 sion.  Whole villages are napalmed on the
 suspicion that they may shelter a few soldiers
 of the Vietcong.  At our prompting, the Sai-
 gon Government has established "strategic
 hamlets," guarded stockaded villages where
 whole populations,  uprooted  from  their
 homes, are forced to live in virtual concen-
 tration camps.  Intellectuals who speak out
 for peace are exiled.
 Perhaps actions as reprehensible as these
 are undertaken  by the Vietcong as well;
 perhaps they are carried out by Vietnamese
 personnel and not by Americans.  Nonethe-
 less, we are responsible.  Torture cannot be
 justified as revenge or reprisal for damage
 done to us; the napalm, regardless of who
 drops it, was furnished by you and me, the
 American taxpayer.
 Once upon a time, such a war was not con-
 sidered civilized; but Hitler has taught us
 to kill vast numbers of civilians on the
 chance that, among them, there might be
 one soldier.  The war we are waging in
 Vietnam is obscenely unmoral,
 The American position in Vietnam cannot
 be defended on moral grounds.  In the poli-
 cies of the Johnson administration, I regret
 to note, justice and morality are no longer at
 issue.  We are not in the Dominican Repub-
 lic to see justice  done, or human lives
 saved, or to support any moral law.  Our
 purpose is political.  We are there to stop
 communism.
 In Vietnam, likewise, our purpose is not
 to help the people attain a fuller life. It is
 to stop the "spread of communism," and to
 retain our "hold" on a piece of land whose
 strategic importance is highly debatable.
 Perhaps our present position in Vietnam
 can be justified from it political standpoint,
 since it clearly cannot be justified from a
 moral or ethical one.  If our presence there
 brings about results which, over the short and
 long term, are beneficial to the interests, of
 the United States, then that presence   ay
 be  considered  worthwhile.  If  the  ends
 justify the means, as they seem to for John-
 son, we must ask whether the means em-
 ployed are likely to lead to the desired ends.
 What are the ends we seek in Vietnam?
 Do we seek to destroy the regime of Ho Chi
 Minh in Hanoi?  His army is presently a
 great obstacle to Chinese incursions into
 Indochina.   Do  our  policymakers  seek to
 provoke the Chinese into a war so we can
 "let 'em have it"?   Such a war, if it ever
 comes, will at best inflict terrible damage on
 both sides.  It will probably become world
 war III.
 Do we seek to destroy the fighting spirt of
 the Vietcong so that a strong and stable
 government may be established in South
 Vietnam?  If so, the people of Vietnam will
 remain  divided,  arbitrarily  at  the  11th
 parallel.
 As the record indicates, there is little hope
 that a stable government could be established
 In the south. And the policies we are follow-
 ing are totally ineffective in destroying the
 Vietcong.  The overwhelming proportion of
 their arms comes, not from Hanoi, but from.
 the U.S. Army.
 The men of the Vietcong axe South Viet-
 namese, fighting to liberate their country
 from the American imperialism which in 1954
 stalled Diem as its puppet ruler, in 1956 pre-
 prevented free elections from taking place,
 and has been devoting ever more effort to
 ravishing their country.
 Let us survey what consequences mightre-
 sult from our present policies in Vietnam.
 Will we succeed in weakening the regime of
 Ho Chi Minh, the guerrilla leader who saved
 Vietnam from the Mao Tse-tung?  Impos-
 sible: under threat from an outside enemy,
 a nation unites under its chosen leaders.
 Are we in Vietnam to demonstrate the ad-
 vantages of a democratic form of govern-
 ment?  Sure thing.  We've already demon-
 strated half a dozen times in the last year
 and a half.
 Will our present policies guarantee -that
 the next Vietnamese Government will be
 friendly to us?  Probably not.  We are pres-
 ently engaged in the destruction of their
 industrial base, such as it was (though we
 are building plenty of good airstrips), the
 disruption of their society, and the decima-
 tion of their population.  Our army, virtu-
 ally an army of occupation, and our vast
 expenditures of money foment profiteering
 and corruption in Saigon.  And history has
 shown us no way to guarantee ourselves a
 "friendly" government.  Though we may try
 to buy them with the offer of a billion-dollar
 Mekong Valley project, such loyalty as we
 may gain will be mixed with contempt.
 Lyndon Johnson seeks peace in Vietnam.
 In 1939, all Europeans wanted peace in Eu-
 rope.  Hitler wanted a peace in which Po-
 land would be a part of Germany.                                                                                   England
 and France sought a peace under somewhat
 different conditions-and the peace was lost.
 A difference of opinions about the condi-
 tions of that peace helped lead to war.  It is
 therefore  of  fundamental  importance  to
 know the conditions of peace which Johnson
 would accept.
 Sooner or later, if world war III does not
 break out, there will have to be a truce in
 Indochina.  How  will  it  be  maintained?
 Who will police it?  If a force of Vietna-
 mese, under whose command?  If an inter-
 national force, how would it be financed?,
 Would it be possible to set up such a forcer
 under  such circumstances that   countries
 such as France, the United States, and the
 Soviet Union would all be willing to con-
 tribute their share of the cost?
 Under what kind of government might
 Vietnam then carry on?  If a neutral gov-
 ernment, how could the situation be main-
 tained?  Because any government which Ho
 did not consider reactionary, Johnson would
 certainly view as Communist.  Perhaps the
 solution would lie in the creation of a trust
 territory under the U.N.  But what country's
 trusteeship would be acceptable to all the
 powers concerned?
 The war in Vietnam cannot possibly cease
 until such questions as I have raised have
 been  thoroughly discussed.  So far, they
 have scarcely been raised.

 If our men must fight give them every
 weapon.  We have no business to do less.
 These men who are dying are precious to us.
 I do not see how our leader has the right
 to draft men and send them to war, when

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I heard an unbeliev-
 able story the other day.  It concerned some-
 thing that the mayor of Mexicali said to
 Chou En.-lai and the Chinese people.
 It seems that the fighting has been raging
 furiously around La Paz and Ensenada in.
 Baja California.  Gringo-equipped banditoe
 from northern Baja California have pene-
 trated across the desert south of Pozo Grande
 and Santo Domingo to threaten La Paz itself,
 and a posse of southern Baja Californirins
 (with  Chinese  advisers)  are  chasing  the
 banditos up and down their mountainous
 retreats in the Sierra de IS, Giganta while
 the Chinese Air Force carries out daily bomb-
 ing raids to the north, knocking out the
 casino and resorts at Ensenada and the
 chamber  of commerce, branches  of  U.S.
 banks, and greenback concessions in Tijuana.
 From the capital city of Mexicali, just be-
 low the California border, the northern gov-
 ernment has issued a statement to all Baja
 Californians, but pointedly addressed to the
 La Paz government of the south.  The great
 Mexican people, it reminded them, share a
 common  heritage  of democracy.  Born  in
 the revolutionary days of Zapata there has
 been a fierce love of liberty throughout the
 land, and a process of change which has seen
 the growth of education and a consequent
 evolution toward  responsible,  enlightened
 democracy and greater and greater individ sal
 independence.  The statement then charged
 that the Emperor of La Paz was a heel-?
 dragger. Balking mulishly against the hands
 of change, he was holding his people back in
 their democratic growth-all under the guise
 of benevolent fathership-and that to save
 this benevolent fathership (which was no';h-?
 ing more than a selfish little monarchy in
 fear of all threats to its fatty status quo of
 conquistadores and Indians) he had put on
 a mask of Communist aspirations and had
 beseeched the Chinese to save him from :;he
 aggression of gringo commercialism.  Ali, but
 what is more ridiculous than descendants of
 Zapata kowtowing to coercion-to Mao Tse-
 tung's tyranny of pseudoscientific economic
 determinism, which itself must change one
 day?  Measured against the proud palomino
 of our native heritage, the communique con-

 eluded, no foreign influence can hope to
 stand higher than the eye of a lizard.
 From the Emperor of La Paz there were
 only the briefest of statements. In an in-
 terview with the Chinese people's daily TV,
 he said that his people were all  Marxist-
 Leninists at heart, were barn and bred in
 dialetical materialism, and only needed to be
 kept free from gringo commercialism in or-
 der to build a showplace Communist utopia
 amidst the cactus and gila monsters of the
 Territorio del Sur.  The Emperor ended on a
 note of humility, offering his selfless services
 as a servant of destiny and of the people.
 Chou En-lai ended the interview, assuring
 the Emperor of the Chinese people's selfless
 and continuing support.  The riches of the
 Vizcaino desert and the heart longings toward
 Marxism-Leninism of the progressive people
 of La Paz must not fall to the greedy com-
 mercialism of the gringos and their lackeys
 in Mexicali, he said. Ending on a similar
 note of humility, he reiterated that the
 Chinese people's purpose in bombing Ense-
 nada was only to defend Peiping and the
 Communist world and that their stay in
 Baja California was only for the temporary
 purpose of fighting the gringo aggressors
 from Mexicali and protecting all of Mexico
 for communism.
 . What was ungraciously unbelievable was
 what the mayor of Mexicali replied to Chou
 En-lai.  Heartily backed by Lyndon Johnson
 and the U.S. Army, he replied that he and
 his people would fight against the pirates
 from China "for 20 years and longer."

 DEAR  SENATOR MORSE: When  you  stated,
 earlier this year, that by the end of 1965
 hundreds of thousands of Americans would
 be dying in Vietnam, I thought you were
 probably exaggerating to make a point. The
 events of the past few days have shown me
 that, as usual, you were right, your critics
 wrong.  It has become obvious that no ac-
 tion is too insane for President Johnson,            I
 think I know now how many Germans must
 have felt during the latter part of the
 thirties.  As many Germans must have done,
 I tell myself that no one is heinous enough
 to order the murder of women and children,
 that no one is mad enough to begin a war
 over a Boy Scout concept of "honor" Never-
 theless, the newspapers, the television, and
 the radio all join in telling me that precisely
 this is happening.
 Also like many Germans, I discover that I
 do not have the courage of whatever it takes
 to meaningfully oppose this idiocy.  No, I will
 not refuse to serve in the Armed Forces; if
 asked, I will even join in the murder of Viet-
 namese women and children.   Like Adolf
 Eichmann, I will "follow orders."    My only
 wish is that bloodthirsty politicians would
 not ask me to believe in what I do, In short,
 I wish men whom I despise and for whom I
 feel nothing but contempt-men such as
 Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, and
 Dean Husk-would cease mouthing empty
 platitudes and childish lies.  Because If the
 American way of life can survive only on a
 base of colonialism, then I hope and pray
 that this society is destroyed as quickly as
 possible.
 I should like now to congratulate you for
 what has been a gallant and inspiring fight.
 Sometimes a voice, in . tl a wilderness paves. a
 society, sometimes it does not.  In any event,
 if the human race has a future, history will
 justify your actions.  As the war gets worse,
 American democracy, such as it is, will prob-
 ably be replaced by a more efficient form of
 government.  So, if you abandon your fight,
 I will not blame you.  Good luck.

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I don't suppose
 this letter will be read by you, since I under-
 stand about 1 in 50 reaches your desk, the
 rest receiving polite acknowledgments from
 your secretaries, but I felt in view of the
 worsening Vietnam situation I had to write,
 feeling as I do that escalation of this war
 will provoke us into a major conflict with
 unforeseeable- if  not  tragic  consequences.
 Much as we would like to be the .savior of
 all  downtrodden countries  and  carry  the
 shining banner of democracy into every land,
 realistically we are not going to be able to
 carry out such a mission, and it is a big
 question whether democracy, in the present
 state of the world, is the answer for all
 nations.
 Many people are questioning whether we
 can wipe out communism and play "Sir:
 Galahad" to all our fellow men.  It may be
 we will have to learn to coexist with Russia
 and Red China, protecting the interests of
 threatened Americans where trouble brews
 (as in Santo Domingo, until that situation
 mushroomed into a foolish and impossible
 crusade), but not extending hostilities into
 enemy territory.  Our lines of supply are so
 far extended compared to the Chinese, in this
 Vietnam situation, to say nothing of the
 juggernaut of Chinese manpower, that we
 will really find ourselves "painted into a
 corner" and unable to get out if we bomb
 Hanoi and other Red Chinese bases.  Maybe
 we could win eventually, who knows, but
 when the experts talk of the war continu-
 ing  10,  15, 20  years, in the holocaust of
 death and destruction, attrition and possible
 use of the atomic or hydrogen bombs by
 either side,  the question of who wins is
 purely quixotic.
 I    often  think  nowadays  of  President
 Franklin Roosevelt's works: "The only thing
 we have to fear is fear itself."  So many of
 us have become so hysterical about the Com-
 munist threat that we have lost all sense of
 proportion and prate about it as deluded
 parents do the bogeyman to frighten a child.
 It is the black plague, the Salem witchcraft
 hunt of our day.  I, for one, get mighty tired
 of all these timid, frightened people who
 scurry around in the dark blind alleys of
 communism, like moles who have lost not
 only their sight but other senses as well.
 We  can  recognize it  as  an unquestioned
 threat to . our way of life but we can meet
 it clear eyed and clear headed.   I think
 much of this pumping up the high blood
 pressure of the Nation can be laid at the
 door of newspapers and periodicals, par-
 ticularly Life and Time which thrive on sen-
 sationalism and the sometimes atrophied
 views of Mr. Henry Luce.  For a refreshing
 contrast to this panic beating of the war
 drums by such publications, read  George
 Feifer'a excellent article "Communism Is Not
 What We Think" in the Saturday Evening
 Post's "Speaking Out" section for February
 27, 1965, and Frederick Nossal's, "Dateline-
 Peiping," published in 1962.
 Dear Mr. Johnson, I think you are a fine
 and dedicated President; we voted for you
 and have  every confidence in your great
 abilities but I think some of your advisers
 are leading you astray when they propose
 stepping up the war and sending ever more
 and more American boys over there.  The
 bombing of villages, of helpless women and
 children, is not only blackening the image
 of the United States in foreign eyes, but a
 grave sin on our own collective soul. When
 we can argue the necessary successful out-
 come of any war on the number of human
 beings killed, whatever sex or age, combat-
 ants or noncombatants, we have fallen low
 indeed.  I never approved the bombing of
 Hiroshima or Nagasaki despite the military
 18423
 arguments designed to salve the national
 conscience and I am heartsick about the war
 in Vietnam.  If we have to "lose face" to get
 out or negotiate, better it be now than in
 some near or distant future when we have
 committed ourselves too far to ever with-
 draw.
 Most sincerely yours,
 MARGARET MOZZANINI.

 Hon. President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 HON.  PRESIDENT JOHNSON:  Your message
 to  the American  people  asking  for  a
 doubling of the draft leaves me appalled.
 How can our Nation call for action on two
 fronts-seemingly contradictory-the wag-
 ing of a wider war, as indicated by an in-
 crease in the military manpower being sent
 from our country to Vietnam and at the
 same time an appeal to United Nations Sec-
 retary U Thant "requesting that all the re-
 sources, energy and immense prestige of the
 United Nations be employed to find ways to
 halt aggression and bring peace in Vietnam."
 I sit in attendance at a 1-week institute
 on teaching disadvantaged  children.  For
 what do we want to prepare these children?
 Don't  we  want  manpower  to  help   our
 country and the world reach new heights of
 achievement for world peace?  How do we
 do this when we are faced with pronounce-
 ments which seem to give greater value to
 possibilities of greater destruction of man-
 kind.
 Our Nation, one of the great powers in the
 world  in  intellectual  and  other  areas of
 achievement, should be giving greater lead-
 ership to efforts for disarmament and total
 world peace. I ask this of you, Mr. Presi-
 dent.                                                                                                                                    Let us not live with the lie that says
 the waging of a wider war is a true pursuit
 of peace.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I feel compelled.to
 write to you on the recent developments in
 the southeast Asian controversy.  As a stu-
 dent I feel that the only way to a settlement
 at all is through the United Nations.  I feel
 that the recent draft increase that the Presi-
 dent has called is unquestionably an act of
 aggression on the part of the United States
 of America, and is therefore an act of war.
 For this reason I feel that the President has
 clearly overstepped his authority.
 As you may well know President Johnson
 becomes very upset when he is criticized,
 but I feel that it is about time that he was
 brought under fire by more people than
 yourself.  I would like to also tell you that
 I am proud that you represent me on the
 floor of the Senate.
 Being a student I realize that the recent
 decisions  of  the  Johnson  administration
 will no doubt affect me much more than I
 realize at this time, and I would serve faith-
 fully in any post that I might get placed in
 should I get called up by the Army.    How-
 ever, I must say in all honesty that had I
 been old enough to vote in 1964 I would
 have voted for Johnson because of his ap-
 parent stand on southeast Asian policy, but
 in 1968 I will be old enough to vote and I
 shall not vote for anyone who runs under
 the same colored flag that he ran under in
 1964.  Johnson has broken his faith with the
 public and if he feels that appointing Mr.

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: From the reports we have
 had this week you, as well as many others,
 are being consulted about the war in South
 Vietnam.
 First, we would like to tell you that we
 are proud of the way you have expressed
 your opinions about the situation and we
 are supporting you all the way when you
 say we should pull out of that part of the
 world.  After careful consideration it ap-
 pears to us that we are not wanted by these
 people-that is with the exception of a few
 at the expense of many.  In the first place it
 was our understanding that it would be for a
 short time to advise and keep the peace until
 they could have an election--which never
 happened.  Then it was supplies and a few
 men and now many more men to fight and
 die for a cause even they do not understand
 the meaning of.  We believe in a free gov-
 ernment and would like to see the people of
 Vietnam free to choose their leaders and
 have the right to rule themselves as they see
 fit, but are we imposing our opinions on
 them so that they find that we are not the
 welcome guests that we would be led to
 bel eve-or are supposed to be? Why are we
 getting more and more involved in a situa-
 tion that is so complicated and why are we
 afraid to lose face? Is it not more important
 to save the lives of our young men than to
 say we have saved face and let so many die
 in a cause that we should never have en-
 tered into?
 Very truly yours,
 Mr. and Mrs. LEWIS LAIRD.

 The OREGONIAN,
 Portland, Oreg.
 To the Editor:
 The Oregonian has performed a vital pub-
 lic role in giving front page space in its
 July 19 issue to the article by AP staff writer
 John T. Wheeler. Most Americans must feel
 both angry and ashamed of what we are
 doing in Vietnam in the name of freedom.
 The London Daily Mirror reports of a July 4
 interview with Air Force General Ky, now
 head of the South Vietnamese Government.
 Asked who his heroes were, he replied: "I
 have only one, Hitler."  In this dirty, un-
 principled war Hitler seems an appropriate
 hero to the General but is he to be our hero
 as well?
 Have we lost all reason, all sense of pro-
 portion and all human conscience that we
 can continue to devastate a country in an
 attempt to save a government which lacks
 any support from its own people?  If this
 senseless slaughter is allowed to continue
 in the name of the American people we will
 certainly go down in history side by side
 with those tyrannical powers who knew no
 moral concern.  Even beyond this, the con-
 tinuation of the war in Vietnam threatens
 to escalate into a total holocaust engulfing
 not only South Vietnam, North Vietnam,
 and China, but the United States itself.  Is
 it so difficult for us to imagine the wailing
 Vietnamese woman cradling a baby in her
 arms-pictured with Mr. Wheeler's article-
 to be an American mother cradling an Amer-
 lean baby midst the ruins of a once happy
 country?.
 Time is running out and the American
 must protest in every conceivable way the
 continuation of this senseless, fruitless and
 ill-conceived war.  Negotiations through the
 United Nations are the only alternative and
 no excuses can substitute for immediate ac-
 tion to end this tragedy.  Senator MORSE has
 repeated time and time again the procedures
 open to the Government of the United States
 if it truly wants to end this fiasco.  Within
 the last few days,  Governor Hatfield has
 called for an immediate convening of the
 United Nations to deal with ending this
 horror.  Both men deserve our thanks and
 support.
 All Americans, of every religious conviction,
 of every ethical persuasion, of every political
 conviction-in the name of humanity and
 it's future-have the urgent task to convince
 our  Government  to  order  an immediate
 cease-fire and to enter into negotiations for a
 political settlement through  the  United
 Nations.
 Sincerely,
 Mr. and Mrs. HOWARD L. GLAZER.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE: Last weekend we
 heard a radio report that you were preparing
 a paper  in hopes of taking the Vietnam
 problem (war) to the U.N.  I've searched the
 papers since and cannot find one line re-
 garding this.  I'm beginning to think we
 have a very well controlled press.
 All I could say was "Bless you," please
 continue that line of thought and speak out
 loud and long and do all in your power to
 try for a settlement of the horrible south-
 east Asia mess.  Somehow the citizens must
 be made to realize that American boys' lives
 are being sacrificed every day for them.
 One does not need a degree in military
 science to see the mistake of getting in-
 volved in Vietnam, unless the Government is
 prepared to fight Red China backed by
 Russia which could mean a war continuing
 many, many years.  China has been prepar-
 ing for this expansion for years with her
 2 million troops in uniform.  Why does the
 Government feel we have to convince the
 South Vietnamese that they should live in a
 democracy when their government has been
 unable to do it for the last 10 years?  Why
 are we so concerned that they not be com-
 munist controlled, when we did so little to
 prevent it in Cuba?  I realize that com-
 munism must be contained but at least we
 could begin in a country that makes an
 effort to defend themselves.  Our Govern-
 ment does not seem concerned when Com-
 munist members and even college professor
 are permitted to speak and influence our
 young-people, who in turn, belittle democ-
 racy and defy our government by burning
 their draft cards.
 We have spent billions on the U.N. and
 that is the one place the Vietnam question
 must be discussed to find out just who is
 wrong.  Where are our  allies?  We  can't
 even depend on our good neighbor, Canada,
 who right now is supplying Red China with
 much needed supplies.  They must feel that
 we are wrong and want no part of It.
 France knows we are wrong, and if nothing
 else, we should have gained a lesson from
 their sad and costly mistake.  England can
 offer nothing but moral support, knowing
 our troops will be a buffer for them in Ma-
 lays, and relieve the pressure on them.  Eo
 our allies, little Australia and South Korea
 send a token of troops, and our boys, the
 cream of manhood between 22 and 30, will be
 killed by the thousands when Red China
 completes their missile bases in North Viet-
 nam.  That doesn't make sense to me.
 We have been given the impression by the
 press that we have to liberate the South
 Vietnamese from the Communists, but to-
 night an article in the Journal says: "Taylor
 and the South Vietnamese officials were in-
 side the stadium attending a rally marking
 the creation of a new movement to liberate
 North Vietnam from Communist control "
 If that is attempted, just who are the ag-
 gressors?
 Now they tell us that the Reserves and tl,.e
 National Guard must be called up.  Do you
 realize what that means?   Thousands  of
 young men who have worked hard for sev-
 eral years to secure a job, have married and
 many with small children, are to be told to
 give up everything and go to a seething jun-
 gle to kill and be killed.  Is that the true
 meaning of the Great Society we hear about
 from President Johnson, who also said dur-
 ing his campaign that he would not send
 troops to Vietnam.  That meant many votes
 for him because we wanted to believe hira.
 We are sick to death of war with every Demo-
 cratic President in office.
 What will become of the families of these
 men?  In most cases they will lose their
 homes, for certainly the salary of the lowly
 enlisted man is not sufficient to maintain a
 home. The Government seems so concerned
 with the war on poverty, Job Corps training
 and all the underprivileged groups, I wonder
 how concerned it will be when these families
 lose their husbands and daddies.
 What is hardest of all to understand Is this
 draft call. Until the late President Kennedy
 decided no married men should be drafted,
 all young men physically able had a military
 obligation to fulfill.  Now it seems all they
 have to do is produce a marriage license and
 they are immune to even 6 months' training.
 We have seen it happen all around us.  Right
 out of high school or maybe a few years ii.n
 college, but at least before that draft board
 calls, that marriage license is the next step,
 and they are laughing up their sleeves at the
 "suckers," as they call them, who got drafted.
 What is fair about all these so-called stu-
 dents, and the troublemakers we find at every
 coastal resort, and the black jacket crowd
 and beatniks, do they not owe anything in
 the -way of military service?   It's terribly
 hard to see them roam the streets and high-
 ways and our young family men obligated to
 give 4 to 6 years and maybe their lives.  For
 we know it will be a terrible price they will
 have to pay once they are sent to fight the
 Vietcong guerrillas with the little training
 they have  received  in  the  Reserves.   My
 cousin fought in New Guinea in World War
 II and because of 8 years' service in tie
 Marines he lived to come home but he said
 it was pure murder to send in such inex-
 perienced men as the Reserves and Guards.
 Again, please do all in your power to get
 this dispute before the U.N. so at least we
 could And out if we have any allies and if
 they are as interested in containing com-
 munism as our Government would like us to
 believe.  Our belief is that they are not, or

 HOn. JACOB K. DAVITS,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. JAVITS: I. am writing to express
 my dismay at the silence of Senators like
 yourself and Mr. Kennedy over the abdication
 by Congress of its sole responsibility to decide
 whether or not the country is to be at war
 in the face of the usurpation of that re-
 sponsibility by the President.
 Article I, clause 11 of the Constitution is
 explicit that Congress alone has the con-
 stitutional  "power * * ? to  declare  war,"
 and under clauses 12 and 13 only Congress
 has constitutional authority "s * * to raise
 and support armies" and "? " * to provide
 and maintain a Navy."
 It is thus clear that the Constitution im-
 poses a tight rein upon the President's par-
 ticipation in deciding whether  or not  to
 declare war: The Constitution provides that
 Congress alone must make that decision.
 "Nothing in our Constitution is plainer
 than the declaration of war is entrusted
 only to Congress."  Youngstown Sheet &
 Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 642 (1952).
 The sole responsibility of Congress for this
 decision is further emphasized by the fact
 that the Constitution does not provide that
 Congress should declare war "on recom-
 mendation of the President," or that the
 "President with advice and consent of Con-
 gress may declare war." As former Assistant
 Secretary of State James Grafton Rogers has
 observed: "The omission is significant.  There
 was to be no war unless Congress took the
 initiative."   Rogers,  "World  Policing   and
 the Constitution," p. 21 (Boston, 1946).
 The proceedings of the Constitutional Con-
 vention  make  clear  that  the                                                                                                                                            Founding
 Fathers were not only determined to deny a
 warmaking power to the President, but were
 even unwilling to entrust it to the Senate
 alone.  To assure the fullest consideration
 of these fateful decisions they therefore pro-
 vided that the entire Congress,  Including
 the House of Representatives should partici-
 pate in the decision.  Bemis, "The Diplomacy
 of  the American Revolution"  (New York,
 1935), pp. 29-35.  See also, Morris, "The Era
 of. the  American Revolution"  (1939), p.
 140-169.
 Despite this constitutional separation of
 powers, the country and the world were sub-
 jected, by the President's East Room press
 conference on July 28, to the spectacle of
 an executive declaration of war.  The Presi-
 dent did not even trouble to characterize our
 involvement as a "police action;" he boldly
 declared not only that we were and would
 be at war, but presumed to decide and to
 declare the extent to which we would com-
 mit troops and other forces in that war.
 I submit that this flouting of the Con-
 stitution is the destruction of the form and
 substance of constitutional government.  No
 justification appears for this disregard of
 the basic separation of powers which is fun-
 damental to our form of government.                                                                                                                                          Con-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE          August 3, 1965
 "We will Insist upon clear explanations of
 the policies in which we are asked to cooper-
 ate. We will insist that we and the American
 people be treated as adults-that we have the
 facts without sugar coating * * *."
 At the same dinner, Senator Green asserted
 that the administration was "isolating our-
 selves from our friends about as fast as the
 administration can grind out new policy
 statements * * *. The administration blus-
 ters about massive retaliation, and our allies
 fear we are Inviting war."
 As you can discern, I deeply believe that
 our involvement in the current war in Viet-
 nam is a tragic and perhaps fatal error. It is
 occurring despite all warnings that we should
 not become involved in a ground war in Asia.
 And it isoccurring in the worst possible cir-
 cumstances, for, as Walter Lippmann has
 pointed out, we are alone in our stand. The
 claim that we must honor our commitments
 is patently hollow.  Not one of the nations
 we are presumably trying to save has seen fit
 to support us in this war, and, if anything,
 the indications are that-they oppose our ac-
 tions.  This includes Indonesia, India, Ma-
 laya, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos;  none of
 their troops are In the field with ours.  Aus-
 tralia is not one of the "dominoes.")                                                                           Even
 the South Vietnam beneficiaries of our com-
 mitment have long since gone or are going
 (many of them over to the other side).      We
 are thus fighting to help people who don't
 want our help, or at least not the kind of
 help-barbaric war-we are giving to them.
 Lawyers call this officious intermeddling, but
 here the potential consequences are more
 appalling.
 I feel that you, as the senior Senator from
 New York and also as a member of an oppo-
 site political party from the President, have
 the greater opportunity and responsibility to
 speak up for constitutional government and
 thereby, in this case, to further the greater
 cause of world peace.  Perhaps they are one
 and the same.
 I am sending a copy of this letter to Sena-
 tor KENNEDY with the hope that he, too, may
 see fit to join with you in opposing the Pres-
 ident's usurpation of the function of Con-
 gress and to bring to end the self-destructive
 policy of Executive escalation of an unjusti-
 fiable and dangerous war.
 I am also sending copies to Senators MORSE
 and GRVENING, to whom, in my humble opin-
 ion, the Nation owes a massive debt for their
 courageous opposition to those policies.  I
 hope future generations will be able to ap-
 preciate their courage and wisdom.  I hope,
 too, that you will join with them in their
 patriotic efforts.
 Respectfully yours,
 HAROLD I. CAMMER.
 gress is and has been In session; the situa-
 tion in Vietnam has been .in the making for
 many years; no sudden emergency or uneE-
 pected  developments  have  arisen  which
 might remotely justify unilateral executive
 action. It is wholly unfitting for the Pres-
 ident to exercise powers which are vested
 solely in the Congress.  As Chief Justice
 Warren pointed out as recently as June 7,
 1965 (quoting James Madison):
 "The accumulation of all powers, legis-
 lative, executive, and judiciary, in the same
 hands, whether of one, it few, or many, and
 whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elec-
 tive, may justly be pronounced the very def-
 inition of tyranny."
 United States v. Brown, - U.S. -, 33 LW
 4603.
 Nor are the President's closed discussions
 with "leaders" of Congress an adequate sub-
 stitute for congressional action.  Under a
 government of laws, action must be taken
 lawfully through the constitutionally estab-
 lished institutions of government-In this
 case by Congress--and in a constitutional
 manner.  Congress acts as a Congress when
 It acts in a parliamentary manner and with
 opportunity to debate and deliberate, not in
 closed meetins with a few over breakfast
 ,or otherwise.-'
 "With all Its defects, delays, and incon-
 veniences, men have discovered no technique
 for long preserving free government except
 that the Executive be under the law,. and
 that the law be made by parliamentary delib-
 erations."
 Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in Youngs-
 tam Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer,
 supra, 655 (1952).
 The President has indicated that he Is
 reluctant to ask Congress for a declaration
 war lest any opposition to his policies,
 even if by a small minority, might give aid
 and comfort to the enemy.  This, of course,
 does not justify his usurpation of powers
 which are solely in the Congress and not In
 himself.
 But even if it were, it is worthwhile to
 recall that when he was Democratic leader
 of the Senate during the administration of
 President Eisenhower, Mr. Johnson rejected
 Such factors as justifying the exclusion of
 Oongress from the fateful decisionmaking
 iu this area, and that he took this position
 in connection with an earlier, and perhaps
 more critical stage of the situation in Indo-
 china.
 For on May 6, 1954, it was Mr. Johnson
 who broke the bipartisanship which had
 theretofore and since the war characterized
 American foreign policy.  On that day, ac-
 cording to the New York Times of May 7,
 1954 (then) Senator Johnson, as Democratic
 leader of the Senate, launched an attack
 upon the administration's foreign policy and
 gave dual notice (1) that the bipartisan-
 ship of the last 16 months was breaking up.
 could not be counted upon for unquestioned
 general support in the field of world affairs.
 According to the Times, Senator Johnson
 and former President Harry S. Truman used
 the Jefferson-Jackson dinner on May 6,1954,
 to lead off the attack by a declaration that
 the administration was alienating allies of
 the United States and that, according to Sen-
 ator Johnson, the United States was in "clear
 danger of being left naked and alone in a
 hostile world."
 Senator Johnson launched this attack at a
 time when the fall of Dienbienphu was im-
 minent, and, in fact, it fell only a few days
 later. Nevertheless, he criticized the admin-
 istration about the differences which he
 claimed it had developed with the traditional
 allies of ?the United States over Indochina
 and  demanded  that  thereafter  Congress
 should be consulted In advance on decisive
 issues of national security policy. He said:
 ONTARIO, OREG., July 29, 1965.
 U.S. Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: I wish to thank you for
 the speech you made in the Senate opposing
 the President's stand in Indochina.  I be-
 lieve it Is the beat speech you ever made.
 Some times I think some Members of Con-
 gress has the backbone of a jelly fish.
 How can we win a war against 700 mil-
 Ron people?
 I have been In nine different States and
 I find very few people in favor of a war
 with any part of China.
 And many many people, workers and young
 men praised your stand "talk first".  Some
 favored get out.
 I was born of white parents in Kansas
 on a farm, taught school, farm work, vet in
 World War I, lived and worked 28 years here
 in eastern Oregon.  Was a watchman at
 Nyasa, Oreg., factory for about 14 years,
 now I am retired.   72 years old this De-
 cember.  Widowed, live all alone and have
 a small place north of Nyasa, worth about
 $5,000, and will keep it for a summer home.
 I pay taxes on it.  I am not in favor of
 vets paying no taxes.
 I bought a house in Osborne, Kans., my
 old home town and plan to spend winters
 there.  Year ago you worked and boosted
 for social security, insurance companies said
 it would ruin them, you said it would make
 them grow and you were right, without it
 we would be in a mess 50 years behind what
 we are today.
 Now Senator there is another thing I wis':i
 you  would  do  for this  United  States of
 America.
 Get the U.S. Supreme Court to make a
 decision  against  State  laws  that  compel
 our people to buy insurance or put up bond
 to travel on our public roads.    Article I,
 section 8 says Congress is to establish post
 offices and post roads, but I do not find any
 place in our Constitution where it compels or
 allows States to have laws that force us
 to buy insurance.
 I pay over $100 a year for car insurance
 and I need that money to live on.
 The premiums are used for members cf
 the insurance companies.  It is not used
 for road maintenance or construction of new
 public roads.
 Drivers licenses money is used for help in
 Oregon paperwork and when a person is
 convicted of an offense he loses his license
 for a time.  Drivers license is OK, I believe.
 A court decision would give each a choice
 in buying insurance or not to buy and I be-
 lieve it would do like you said social se-
 curity would do, make the insurance com-
 panies grow.
 I sure wish the U.S. Supreme Court would
 make a decision like I am asking for.
 Please write me.
 JULY 28, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: What in God's name
 do our military and civilian "experts" hope
 to  accomplish  with the                         insane  policy of
 escalation?
 Please inform the President and his "ex-
 pert" advisers that my wife and I do not
 sanction interference by the U.S. military
 in domestic problems of any country; prob-
 lems which the military mind does not com-
 prehend, or appreciate.
 We suggest the flyboys practice using their
 "toy" guns and hideous napalm to bomb
 in areas in which innocent women, men, and
 children are not to be found.
 We further suggest civilian authorities to
 place restrictions on military policymakers.
 We need no Caesars, Napoleons, or. Ludin-
 dorffs today.  Let the eager military heroes
 attack poverty here and overseas, illiteracy
 in and out of the military, and other ills
 of mankind instead of helpless human beings.
 Sincerely,
 LAKE Oswzoo, OREG.,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to thank you
 for the stand you have taken over the Viet-
 namese situation.  Although, your advice his
 not been heeded by the decision makers, it
 has not gone unnoticed by your constituents.
 Thank you.
 Today, Mr. Johnson gave us it sugar-coated
 pill in his message about Vietnam.  He min-
 imized the situation by indicating that he
 did not think it necessary to call up tie
 reserves, while at the same time he indicated
 that he would reinforce the Vietnam troop
 commitment by 50,000 from a now under-
 manned Army.  He also indicated that Le
 would double the draft.  Young men need
 mature leadership or they quickly die on the
 battlefield.  I have a son who will be one of
 those to go with the 1966 draft or he will
 volunteer, but I do not desire to see him led
 by inexperienced garrison soldiers, or dis-

 turbed and disgruntled reservists.  I think
 that he is entitled to receive his training from
 tried and proven professionals.   One good
 source would be the, hundreds of thousands
 of retired professionals who have left the
 army after only 20 years service.
 Mr. Johnson cannot call up the retired
 soldiers without congressional permission;
 however, many are serving in dual capacity
 as reservists in the retired reserve-many of
 these men in their late thirties and early
 forties could well free' an active army profes-
 sional from stateside or service type or train-
 ing type duties if ordered back to active
 service.  I do not advocate that they be
 called to duty involuntarily, but they all
 should be asked to volunteer their services;
 many with complete dedication would leave
 lucrative civilian jobs to return to harness.
 Each one so returned to duty would lessen
 the need to draft a boy or dislodge an un-
 trained reservist who really doesn't want to
 go, or can't afford to go.  These men could
 replace the military staff at universities,
 recruiting service, station complements, and
 other housekeeping jobs;    thereby, freeing
 well qualified professionals for duty overseas.
 However, as evidenced during the Korean
 war-the administration would not do this
 unless it were dictated by the Congress.  It
 costs less to recall a retiree because he gives
 up his retirement pay-an economic factor,
 plus the efficiency that would be gained by
 the use of experience that is available. Fur-
 thermore, many retirees would be qualified
 for troop duties also.  Of course, only physi-
 cally qualified retirees should be called.
 I would appreciate your comments on the
 above, and ask that you consider these
 thoughts for possible action as my repre-
 sentative in the U.S. Senate If the president
 should call for authority to raise more troops.
 Sincerely,
 RAY A. ZIEGLER.
 AMBLER, PA.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE.
 DEAR SIR (meant to be an appeal to Con-
 gress also) : Have you thought of getting im-
 peachment proceedings started against Pres-
 ident Johnson, or interesting any of your
 colleagues in the legalities of starting im-
 peachment proceedings against a President
 who violates the Constitution by waging
 undeclared war according to his own will
 and whimsey?
 Surely he cannot play havoc with the lives
 of U.S. citizens whom he has sworn to serve
 and protect.
 Surely he cannot order boys to their death
 without Congress lifting a finger.
 How has this egomaniac, power-hungry
 man obtained such absolute authority over
 this democratic Nation?
 Where are the checks and balances of the
 system?
 Can President Johnson (one man) involve
 the whole world in a nuclear holocaust?
 Can he ignore public and world opinion
 and fool Congress with his pious and hypo-
 critical mouthings that are written by an-
 other man?
 Democracy is truly dead, if such a man
 can, unchecked, continue to embroil us, step
 by step, into a deeper and deeper conflict.
 He will sacrifice thousands, yea, millions to
 save face and pride, rather than admit de-
 feat.  He dictates to Congress and then pres-
 surizes  them  into sanctioning  his  wild,
 cowboy foreign policy. Congress has become
 a rubberstamp. For shame.
 Are there no men of good will left, sane
 men of authority who will stand up and stop
 this stubborn, obstinate man?
 The late Edward R. Murrow helped to turn
 the tide against another seemingly invincible
 tyrant, the late Senator Joseph McCarthy.
 Let us hope that enough similar good men
 will come forth, join with you, and turn the
 tide against the Johnson gang before it is
 too late.
 Sincerely,
 MRS. FRANCES COX CECCHINI,
 FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ.,
 July 13, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR  MORSE:  In your  letter of
 July 6 you are probably right in the idea
 that any attempt to remove Johnson from
 office would backfire.            My suggestion for im-
 peachment, however, stems from an anger
 which has been growing for 20 years.  For
 quite -a while after 1945 our diplomacy to-
 ward Russia seemed to me to consist mainly
 of the truculent stockpiling of atomic bombs.
 Then came McCarthy and no issue could be
 discussed anywhere,  domestic or foreign,
 without fear of some kind of reprisal-the
 kind that would, and did, bring ruin to many
 individuals.  Now Johnson has proved to be
 quite as trigger happy as it was feared his
 opponent would be.  I am very much dis-
 appointed in him.
 I have not yet read the excerpt from the
 CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  (July  1,  1965;  pp.
 14915 through 14922)  but I shall study it
 thoroughly.
 I want to endorse the last paragraph of
 your July 6 letter which I will copy here:
 "I hope that the opponents of Johnson's
 policy in Vietnam will not fall apart by
 adopting what we call splinter tactics in
 conducting this struggle for peace in Asia."
 If there is any way in which I can help
 the opponents of Johnson's Vietnam policy
 I will do so.
 I  appreciate very much the care, the
 thought, and experience shown in your an-
 swer to my letter.  You may expect to hear
 from me again.  Meantime, any communi-
 cation or literature from you concerning the
 cause of peace will be most welcome.
 My wife and I are on vacation with truck
 and trailer heading for Colorado.  I am a
 retired postal employee.  We will return to
 San Bernardino in September when her
 school term begins.  She is a teacher of the
 visually handicapped there.  I am studying
 a great deal myself in an attempt to become
 literate in my old age.   Rural Kansas-at
 least the part I was born in-60 years ago
 did not encourage education beyond the
 elementary.  Or at least I can say it did
 not encourage a broad outlook.  During the
 First World War I remember signs on the
 street corners of Newton: "Speak the Amer-
 ican language: If you don't know it, learn
 it.  If you don't like it, get out."  And Ger-
 man was no longer studied in the schools.
 I am sure you can read much between these
 lines.
 The vacation Is expensive.  We should
 have waited really until next year.   But, now
 Is the time.  We are still alive and this beau-
 tiful country is still here to be seen.  What
 next year will bring no one can tell.
 Sincerely,
 CLIFFORD M. TURNER.

 not received the support of their own people.

 FAIR OARS, CALIF., July 27, 1965.
 Hon. LYNDON JOHNSON,
 President of the United States,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. JOHNSON: I am writing to you
 as a citizen of the United States, deeply con-
 cerned with those basic assumptions of our
 foreign policy that seem to underlie our
 recent actions in Vietnam and the Domini-
 can Republic.  Senators FULBRXGHT, MORSE,
 MCGQvERN,  GREENING,   and  others  have
 pointed out on numerous occasions that an
 effective foreign policy must be based on
 present-day realities rather than old myths.
 The following assumptions seem to me ex-
 tremely dangerous in an age of thermo-
 nuclear reality.
 Our foreign policy apparently assumes (1)
 that all Communist governments are dan-
 gerous to our security and therefore no new
 Communist governments should be allowed
 in the world;  (2) that subversion can be
 equated with armed invasion  (3) that our
 foreign policy should be unified and inflex-
 ible and public debate should be discouraged,
 and (4) that we can win the cold war and
 this  can  be  accomplished  by  military
 methods.
 I will try to discuss each of the above
 assumptions, hoping that this discussion
 will help to promote a dialogue on this
 crucial subject.  The first assumption does
 not  correspond   to  present-day  reality.
 Yugoslavia, Poland, and Rumania, for a--
 ample, offer no military threat to our secu-
 rity.                     Inherent in this assumption is the
 belief in a unified worldwide Communist
 conspiracy.  Tito's independence as well as
 events such as the China-Russia split should
 be sufficient to dispell this myth.
 The second assumption is an extremely im-
 portant one.  If a few Communists attempt
 to wield some influence in a,government or
 revolution, are`; we justified in calling this
 an act of aggression in order to justify our
 armed intervention?  How can an effective
 war' be carried o1.t against subversion?  How
 caiti we tell a Communist subversive from a
 a socially concerned patriot?  Why. do we
 fear subversion?  Has any government that
 was sensitive to the needs and wishes of its
 people ever been subverted?
 The third assumption openly violates the
 principles of our constitutional democracy.
 In a society that is ruled by the peoples'
 representatives at the concent of the gov-
 erned, the government must provide the peo-
 ple with accurate information and encour-
 age unlimited discussion in the national leg-
 islature and among the public at large.
 Only then are the people and their repre-
 sentatives able to arrive at w1se decisions.
 The fourth assumption Implies the defeat
 of communism.  In this assumption we im-
 ply that we have the only political system
 worthy of existence in the world and that
 not more than one political ideology can
 exist at one time.  Why is it that we are not
 concerned about the existence of dictator-
 ships?  Isn't this system of government just
 as alien to our own as communism?  Obvi-
 ously we must learn to live peaceably and
 with mutual respect for other systems of
 government.  Our only other alternative is
 to try to conquer the world in order to make
 it safe for democracy.  In my opinion the
 latter course of action can lead only to na-
 tional suicide.
 With sincere concern,
 DAN W. CLANCY.

 DEAR SENATOR: We wish to thank you for
 your opposition to U.S. policy in Vietnam
 and ask you to keep up the fight.  The hopes
 and prayers of millions of parents are with
 you.  Keep up the good work.
 We have admired your fearless stand on
 other matters in the past, but, like most, did
 not take time to write you.
 We, like millions of other parents, are
 wondering why American boys should fight
 for a system obvioulsy so corrupt as the
 South Vietnam Government system is.  We
 are sick and tired of more than a decade of
 bungling in Vietnam.  This country has
 spent enough money there to have bought
 every family there a good .farm, yet the con-
 tinuing poverty of the peasantry makes them
 easy converts to the Vietcong.
 The rest of the world is turning against us
 in this war.  We look great, using napalm
 all over the Vietnam landscape.  How many
 innocent people have been destroyed because
 of indiscriminate plastering of a jungle by
 burning gasoline and high explosives?  The
 pictures of our own press runs of Vietcong
 suspects-suspects mind you-being tortured
 by South Vietnamese soldiers are enough to
 turn anyone's stomach.
 We are losing the respect of all the world.
 And, fighting in a hostile environment where
 technological advantages mean little, we are
 making ourselves the laughing stock of other
 nations.  We and  our South Vietnamese
 allies together can't put down half-starved
 guerrilla fighters who think they have an
 ideal to fight for.
 Please read the attached editorial.  Our
 prayers are with you.

 LET'S  HOPE                              UNITED  NATIONS  WILL  MEDIATE
 IN VIETNAM
 The one cheering note in President John-
 son's press conference speech yesterday was
 the renewed appeal to the United Na dons
 to do something about the Vietnam situa-
 tion.
 'Unless we can get some acceptable inter-
 national body to take over and mediate, it
 appears we're trapped in an increasingly bad
 mess.  For without allies, Asiatic or Eu-
 ropean, we are engaged in a land war in Asia,
 and in the eyes of a great part of the world
 this is rich white men killing poor dark-
 skinned people.
 And it's a war in which there is no real
 winning.  Suppose we somehow whip  the
 Vietcong and occupy and control all of Viet-
 nam, or at least of all South Vietnam, and
 that neither China nor Russia comes into
 the fight. this would be "victory," but one
 in which we'd have to be the occupying con-
 queror for a long, long time.  An alternative
 would be to set up another of the long series
 of dictatorships that have plagued this ].,,)ar.
 of the world.
 Of course, having gone as far as we have.
 it's difficult to back out without losing face
 and welching on commitments.  The com-
 mitments should not have been made; they
 were commitments the American people were
 assured would not be made; they were made
 to a. "government" lacking the support or
 consent of the people it seeks to govern.
 President; Johnson did not make the orig-
 inal commitments, though he has tightened
 them.  But now he's stuck with them, and
 his political enemies, the very ones who hay
 urged him to hit even harder in Vietnam.,
 already have shown they'll make him suffer
 either way.  If he seeks to end the ghastly
 mess, he'll be called an appeaser; if the war
 goes on and gets worse, as It shows every
 sign of doing, it'll be "Lyndon's war" and
 he'll face a candidate pledged to "bring our
 boys home."
 This is a predicament from which we seem
 unable to free ourselves.  That's why some
 help from outside will be more than welcome.
 WASHINGTON, D.C.,
 July 29, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Thank you for your
 courage in speaking out against our occupa-
 tion of South Vietnam by military forces.
 Our position there seems illegal, imm ora.,
 and untenable and completely opposed to our
 stated national concept of goals and ideals
 in dealing with our fellow men.
 Tacit consent in aiding in torture of Viet-
 namese peasants, both adults and teenagers
 and  actually  children,  who  are  caught
 between   the  ambitions  of  two politically
 opposed groups of Vietnam is perhaps one of
 the most barbarous acts committed by this
 country in many decades.
 Ruthlessly     aiding  in bombing   indis-
 criminately, either because of inexperience
 of the military commanders or complete dis-
 regard of international military code, indi-
 cates that we have already taken ourselves
 out of the boundaries of behavior set by the
 United Nations.  As a Christian nation we
 are setting and appalling example of being
 far more ruthless than Communist nations.
 It is most unfortunate that the advisers
 of the President disregard United Nations
 opinion.  Whatever good has been achieved
 on a national level during the President's
 tenure of his office will be of little or no
 importance if we continue our internation l
 policy of interfering in the domestic affairs
 of other countries.  Rather, we should with-
 draw all troops from Vietnam at once, Ieav-
 ing only our Embassy personnel and work
 through the United Nations for fulfillment
 of the Geneva conference to permit the Viet-
 namese electorate to decide their own destiny.
 Hopefully they would be willing to become
 a neutralized nation and put an end to the
 military dictatorship which we are support-
 ing in South Vietnam.
 Again  my gratitude that  we  have  one
 strong, intelligent, and moral voice which
 speaks out again and again for world law and
 order.
 With warmest best wishes.
 Oorclially,
 Mrs. FRED Z. HETZ KL.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: You are fighting a
 losing battle-but thank God you are fight-

 It seems as':though the war hawks includ-
 ing Johnson have gone completely off their
 mind.
 I wish I knew how I could help-I write
 -Johnson almost daily hoping that enough
 mail against war will make him realize that
 his words of peace and his actions of war
 is not fooling anyone.
 He would make a good actor-he is always
 posing-and frankly we turn off our TV
 when he is on-because he seems to think
 he is fooling the American people.  All he
 is doing is showing that he is a war hawk-he
 lied to get the Presidency-so where do we
 go from here?
 Again thank God that you and a very few
 of the others are protesting-it gives us just
 a little hope.
 Please help us to help you in some show
 of.-faith we have in you to possibly make
 the war hawks come to their senses.
 Thank you.

 you should have any suggestion to propose
 to its so that we might be more effective,
 please do not hesitate to so inform me.
 I am wondering if you have available
 copies of speeches, official, publications, or
 any other written material to send me.  I
 would be most pleased for you to place my

 In closing, let me offer to you a more

 appeal to reason so often quoted:
 "Come now, and let us reason together.
 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat
 the good of the land:

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I heard your com-

 suggest that our dear President send a reso-
 lution to the Security Council of the United
 Nations in order to work out a peace through
 world law.
 He is asking for help through the United
 Nations  but  in  turn  is  commiting more
 American forces because the South Viet-
 namese have given up.                                                                       This is not a war for
 freedom. This is an American war. It looks
 like we are in it to stay.
 How can we alert our Congress and the
 people to the facts.  I heard Sander Van-
 ocur-NBC newsman just back from Vietnam
 explaining this type of war can never be won.
 If the Americans want to do it alone it will
 take 2 million men.
 Wish you health in order to keep up the
 courage.  Your Governor Mark Hatfield's
 position is great,  I wrote and commended
 him too.

 July 30, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: My own Senators are
 of no use to me in this matter about which I
 and  many,  many  of  my  neighbors  feel
 strongly.
 I speak of our activities in Vietnam.                 It
 seemed to us that Lyndon Johnson had the
 opportunity of all history to proclaim peace
 for the world when he came into office. He
 did not.
 We look at the wars of history and find
 that after killing numberless men, the peace
 table was the final settlement.  We act like
 beasts.
 What concerns us, out West here, is the
 real motivation for this war in east Asia.  If
 "communism" the favorite cuss word of our
 time, is the real cause, then it is the fears
 of business, private profits and monopolies
 which are the actual urgency.  Is it such
 things as tin, rice, and rubber and their
 future  control by  our  "free  enterprisers"
 which are furthering this killing spree, this
 drafting of more and more young men to
 snatch their profits for them,at the cost of
 lives, defeated family life, and embittered
 young men?
 I remember, during the Korean war, we
 had a pet shop and many soldiers on fur-
 lough used to come in to play with the pup-
 pies and kittens.  One day I asked one of
 these young men what we were accomplish-
 ing in Korea.  I have never forgotten the
 way he stiffened up and replied "Not a damn
 thing."
 After that I made a business of asking.
 Perhaps it was my friendly, gray-haired old
 lady appearance which made them speak
 frankly, but out of the 39 I asked they all
 made practically the same reply.
 Why, for Instance, have we not sent ves-
 sel after vessel loaded with food and mate-
 rials for bettering life in Vietnam, to get the
 same result over communism-if it really
 is communism we fear.  Think of the atti-
 tude toward America to be created by such
 gifts, instead of winning what we now have-
 the disapproval of practically all nations,
 lost trade with the immense Chinese popu-
 lation, and not the least, the fears, sadness
 and unwillingness of the parents of drafted
 soldiers.
 Please set me straight. We need the advice
 and wisdom of a Senator who dares to oppose
 our Government policy.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 Why do our statesmen hide their heads in
 the muck and become merely politicians
 under the heel of President Johnson? Why
 is everyone who disagrees with Johnson
 tarred as a Communist?  is it so that none
 will dare speak out?
 Will we have to whine like the German
 people did of Hitler's war: "We were not
 responsible; it was not of our doing."
 Khrushchev got out of Cuba.  Was he a
 more  responsible  leader  than Johnson?
 Doesn't he know or care that the use of vio-
 lence to solve problems is an absurdity?  Or
 is he some sort of antihero, above the con-
 science of God and man?
 Our late President Kennedy was more than
 a man for America, he was a man for the
 world.  Will there be anyone to seize the
 banner from his stilled hand or are we never
 to have the loathsome yoke of war lifted?
 Must we all follow like lemmings down into
 the hellish pit which Johnson is digging
 deeper for us everyday?
 Johnson's arguments for war are as straw
 In the wind.  Everyone of us knows that this
 country is strong enough to turn back any
 aggressor.  Let not America be the aggressor.
 Why hasn't this vital issue been laid
 squarely before the United Nations where It
 belongs, in this world that is being forced
 to  use  comonsense?  Why  is  Johnson
 hedging this question?
 Surely, America could do more for the
 peoples of Asia and Africa through a demon-
 stration of allout help in a South Vietnam
 that is  separated  from  her Communist
 neighbor, North Vietnam.
 This senseless killing of both Americans
 and .Asians is creating vast fear of the
 U.S. Government throughout the world and
 In American citizens, also.
 In God we trust.

 I understand you are one who is in opposi-

 the terrific military buildup in South Viet-

 appreciation and wholehearted support.
 It seems this situation has gotten way out
 of hand.  Not much but disaster is going to
 be achieved by all the military aggressiveness
 and show of force.  If all the personnel and
 money could be turned to constructive efforts
 and peaceful help and building up of the

 I think that we made a terrible blunder and
 the proper thing now is to admit that we
 made a mistake and get out of Vietnam, be-
 cause after all anyone can make mistakes and
 we have made them before.  We should turn
 it over to the United Nations and let the
 United Nations take responsibility and be
 supported at the very time that it needs our
 support.  This should be done immediately
 before this war escalates into world war III.

 Hanoi.  I hope that your request to the Se-

 will bear fruit before we become more. in-

 not military, will be used from this point on
 to bring an end to the death, destruction,
 and disease in both Vietnams.  The increase
 indraft calls, the request for more military

 frighten all of us and serve to consolidate

 DEAR CONGRESSMAN BROWN: May I again,

 express appreciation and gratitude for your
 firm stand on behalf of world peace in the
 present crisis precipitated by the Johnson
 administration?  You and the courageous
 dissident minority of Senators - and Repre-
 sentatives who are standing out against the
 war hawks may well prove the deciding fac-
 tor in the prevention of ultimate chaos and
 dissolution for civilization.  Your responsi-
 bility is tremendous.
 Your battle is by no means hopeless-the
 people are being mobilized on behalf of
 peace.  It is undoubtedly true that a de-
 cisive majority of the politically consciou8.
 citizenry of the United States stands for
 peace-against the escalation of the Viet-
 namese war and for the prompt settlement;
 of the issues involved through the United
 Nations.  As for the people as a whole, the
 majority is torn by doubts and fears and
 though silent, is by no means convinced that
 it wants its sons to fight a truly foreign war
 There are, of course, the representatives of
 the Pentagon-industrial complex and their
 defenders-always the enemies of interna-
 tional law and sanity.  But these, thougl',
 powerfully entrenched, are by no means in-
 vincible in the face of national and interna-
 tional opinion.  I am eager that you and
 your courageous colleagues accept this wholly
 rational premise.  Do you?  You must not
 concede that you are fighting a losing battle.
 Above all else, it ought to be increasingly
 apparent that the official Washington pre-
 sumption that this Nation has a right to lay
 down the moral law for all humanity is
 ludicrous and totally unacceptable to the
 rest of mankind.  Let's get off our high horse
 and try to be cooperative human beings.

 DEAR SENATOR: The critical Vietnam situa-
 tion is a very serious problem.  It seems
 that most people, who are concerned about
 the Vietnam fight, deal with it only with
 their emotions, not with their intellect (per-
 haps their brain has been numbed by the
 slaughter).
 Oh,  how the American people do need
 understanding and integrity when they are
 confronted with controversial problems.
 The average public official and the average
 American is starving for, at least, one of the
 qualities in which you are outstanding, that
 is intellectual and moral courage.
 I  think the  national  administration is
 making some good progress with many of our
 domestic problems, but the foreign policy
 seems to be far off the course, especially the
 massacre action in Vietnam.
 I think this Nation has no right to use
 military power to force other nations to
 adopt an ultra conservative or reactionary
 government.
 It seems to me that for many years the
 United States has been giving military cr
 economic support to royalty and other dicta-
 tors in foreign countries.
 It seems to me that this Nation is inter-
 fering with the democratic processes in Viet-
 nam.
 This Government should exercise more el -
 fort to stop the Vietnam fight instead of
 extending it.
 Senator, I think some of your views on
 foreign policy are much better than some
 of those being followed.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE, I appreicate your
 active intellectual and moral courage in you r
 concern with our today's problems.

 friends are those who come into my yard to
 help me in a fight with my brother and who
 leave me minus a house, a barn, a crop, every-
 thing.  That is what we are doing in Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. Johnson better take care that he not
 lose more than his face. The one called God
 may take a look-see on this earth and decide
 to sweep it clean of all who encumber it be-
 cause they are spiritually dead.  With God,
 positions and possessions do not count and
 leaders who lead their followers to evil-doing
 are guiltier than the ignorant masses they
 lead.
 May that God inspire you to oppose the
 real malefactors within this and within all
 nations on this earth.  Congress still has the
 last say-so on declaration of war.  Don't let
 Johnson, at al., eucher us into that declara-

 PORTLAND, OREG., July 30, 1965.
 DEAR  SENATOR  WAYNE MORSE:  I feel the
 pulse of heartbreak for our Nation at the
 decision of President Johnson to send his
 peace and progress program forward on for-
 eign soil with the blood of our sons, and tears
 of their loved ones.
 As  our  confidence  in our President  is
 shaken, please let us extend our vote of con-
 fidence to you for the mighty right you stand
 for, and thank God you can speak out so we
 can all hear you.
 We voted for a man who promised that
 no' mother's  son  would  fight  on  foreign
 soil,  and  not at home;  unless  we    were
 attacked.   The Oregonian depicted our new
 President and Vice President in colored pic-
 tures and ink as peace and progress.
 Now he describes "peace" to us as war
 strategy to have peace if we have to fight
 for it.  He never talks of initiating meas-
 ures to bring about a peaceful solution.  He
 only suggests that those who do not have
 either the ability or the confidence in our
 Nation to offer a solution that will be inviting
 enough for us to stop killing them because
 they are Communists.
 President Johnson is right when he claims
 this idea of carrying the war forward over
 there  is  an  old  idea  for  that  is  what
 MacArthur was fired for.
 It was hard to expect anything from Ike
 except war strategy, but somehow we all
 had high hope that Kennedy would grad-
 ually negotiate trade agreements to bridge
 a way to greater understanding among na-
 tions, because of his great intelligence In in-
 fluencing the nations of the world to work
 peacefully toward solutions, and his patience
 to bring them about, and now we mourn his
 loss to our Nation anew as we see the result of
 "impatience."
 When you speak it is like a light high on
 a hill' of hope, again a vote of confidence
 from us to you.
 Sincerely,
 Mrs. JOHN MAXWELL.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate.
 DEAR SIR: As a voter and citizen in the
 .United States, I want to express my deep
 and sincere appreciation for your courageous
 stand upon the question of Vietnam.  It Is
 comforting to know that the Senate is not
 entirely without consciousness that in Viet-
 nam the United States has-put forward 'the
 most unfortunate foreign policy commit-
 ment (with the exception of the inexcusable
 performance in the Dominican Republic)
 to`date.
 The United States should never have been
 in  South Vietnam,  to  begin with.  And
 neither international law nor commonsense
 support our continued adventures in that
 unfortunate country.
 The only conceivably sensible and hon-
 orable thing for the United States to do
 now in Vietnam is to ask the U.N. to exer-
 eise all its possible power to gain a cease-fire
 preliminary to serious negotiations foi a,
 settlement.  And negotiations must include
 all concerned parties (the Vietcong also) at
 the conference table.
 Once the dangerous, insane escalation of
 the war, and the mutual use of terror and
 brutality, have stopped, we may all recover
 our wits sufficiently to make a settlement
 at least as good as the 1954 Geneva accord-
 with the United States a signatory this time,
 please.

 NEW YORK, N.Y.,
 July 31, 1963.
 IJSAR MR. PRESIDENT: As a college educated,
 voting, questioning, responsible citizen, I
 feel "compelled to protest what my country
 is doing in Vietnam and other parts of the
 world.  I may, not approve of what other
 countries do, but that is irrelevant.   This
 is my country, and the only one in which
 I have an involvement.
 I am offended that we feel we have in-
 herited the divine right to determine what
 is right for the rest of the world.     `his
 has burdened us with policing the whole
 world, enforcing our policies most cruelly
 at times and, in short, led us to a kind of
 insanity which calls every revolution com-
 munist and quashes the just struggle for
 fri dom.  We have turned our backs on the
 motivations which, in their turn, caused our
 own revolution.  We are ignoring the reali-
 ties of the world situation.
 I -feel like a citizen of prewar Germany
 who sat and watched while the trains took
 Jews past to be stripped of the final free-
 . dom.  There is no "right" or "wrong  in
 this world politically; but there is a wrong,
 and we all know it, when people are mangled
 and murdered by us.  Hitler leveled Lidice
 in the war when it was supposed to hold
 partisans-and the world called it just one
 more of his atrocities. I do not want my
 country to be doing the same; I grew up
 being taught it could never be so.
 And even more practically, can we go on
 using these methods wherever another coun-
 try would use communism or socialism or
 whatever to achieve what we already have.
 It is none of our business.  And we cannot
 keep it up forever. We must find alternative
 methods to war to settle 'human disputes.
 Instead of relying on defense and armaments
 experts, please listen more to the many
 State Department and university experts who
 are spending their lives working out ways
 to achieve peace through honest negotia-
 tions, economic cooperation, agreement to
 allow others to differ with us.
 In brief, they, whoever they are, are no
 more perfect than we.  We must accept this
 and plan for, not an end to strife, ways to
 settle strife without the horrible means of
 modern war.

 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 MY DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON:                      I wish to
 convey to you my opposition to the present
 policy toward Vietnam.
 Although the number of our troops has
 been increased in that area and the draft
 doubled, the war is hopeless, it seems to me,
 from a military standpoint.  The French
 committed a quarter of a million troops to
 the task of defeating the Vietminh and ulti-
 mately had to withdraw even though they
 continued to hold the major cities.
 If the war continues to escalate, both
 Vietnamese and Americans will be killed in
 increasing numbers in a brutal, senseless
 war which can go on for years until it be-
 comes another Korea.  And the Korean war
 finally became so unpopular that General
 Eisenhower in 1952 promised to go to Korea
 if elected and secure a cease-fire which he
 did.
 The political implication of a continued
 war in Vietnam is that we will lose more face
 than  we  already have  among  southeast
 Asians and probably among undeveloped na-
 tions over the world.                                                                          Moreover,  if it  is
 communism with which we are chiefly con-
 cerned, more Communists will be produced
 with each day the war continues.
 But the most serious results of the war
 might well be a nuclear confrontation fol-
 lowed by someone's decision to employ atom-
 ic weapons.  This danger, it seems to me,
 is so frightening that no nation is justified
 in embarking on the sort of military ad-
 venturism which now characterizes our Viet-
 nam policy.
 I urge you to deescalate the war with a
 view to reducing the tension and removing
 American troops from Vietnam as soon as
 possible.
 Very truly yours,
 J. THEODORE HEFLEY.
 BRONx, N.Y., July 29,1965.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: Keep up your fight against the
 ever-widening U.S. military involvement in
 Vietnam.
 Only Congress can declare war, according
 to the Constitution.  We are in a hot shoot-
 ing war, but why has Congress failed to exer-
 cise its warmaking authority, which is ex-
 pressly mandated in article I, section VIII,
 subdivision 11 of the Constitution?
 I am proud that you keep insisting for
 Congress to debate this issue.  Too many of
 your colleagues in Congress either are too
 timid, or too indifferent to this life and
 death problem.
 Maybe now Congress will take up discus-
 sion of our southeast Asia troubles since
 hundreds of thousands of our men are to
 be sent there, and since it is to cost so much
 money.
 I admire you for standing up almost alone
 in your dissent of current Presidential pol-
 icy on southeast Asia.  The Congress should
 be grateful to you for saving the warmaking
 policy for the Congress to perform, as the
 Constitution states.
 Yours very truly,

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  PRESIDENT         JOHNSON: I wish to  ex-
 press my great dismay at your decision once
 again to escalate the conflict in Vietnam.
 The refusal of our antagonists there to talk
 peace cannot be a convincing reason for
 escalation until we have offered to talk with
 the people we are actually fighting against.
 If that  kind  of  peace negotiation: now
 seems like "backing down," we have nobody
 to blame but ourselves, since our "comlydt-
 meat" to dictate what kind of government
 the Vietnamese shall have violates all our
 basis American values.
 The only moral purpose for a foreign mili.
 tary presence in Vietnam would be to insare
 the freedom of free elections by the Viet-
 namese themselves, and the only way to do
 this is to make the military presence inter..
 national; i.e., under the United Nations.
 If we are afraid that South Vietnam would
 go Communist in a free election, then our
 best bet is to have the U.N. supervise two
 free elections, several years apart, so that
 the Vietnamese have a chance to live under
 the kind of government they now think they
 want and then have a chance to change their
 minds if they want to.
 Such a policy would do the greatest honor
 to our American beliefs in democracy and
 individual freedom.  Until it has been tried
 we cannot honestly claim that we have no
 peaceful and honorable alternatives to war in
 Vietnam.
 Respectfully,
 ELIZABETH CONVERSE.

 Hon.    WAYNE  MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR:            This is  being  written  to
 say that I agree entirely with your position
 in the illegal war we are carrying on in
 South Vietnam.                                      I have read in the papers
 at times that you are one of the very few
 men in Congress who have the courage to
 get on your feet and disagree with Mr. John-
 son in this matter.  We have no business
 in fighting a war in South Vietnam and we
 never made any promises or commitments
 to any country to do so. We were to furnish
 some military advisers to that little country
 but we were never under any obligation to
 send thousands of troops there to carry on
 a war.
 If the forces of North Vietnam get con-
 trol of South Vietnam I do not see whether
 that makes any difference to us.  This whole
 little country is not worth the life of one
 American soldier.  The situation is getting
 worse and worse.   We are losing men every
 day and the expense is terrible and we the
 taxpayers have to pay.   This is a matter
 that the United Nations  should have  to
 handle and not the United States should
 handle alone.  We ought to get out of that
 little country as quickly as we can and slow
 down instead of enlarging the war.   Ii a
 vote in this country were taken, I am con-
 fident that the great majority would agree
 with you that we should not and have no
 right to carry on a war in that country.  I:
 want to congratulate you upon your courage
 in the position you have taken.  It seems,
 however, that practically all the Democrats
 in  Congress  go along with whatever     Mr.
 Johnson wants and are afraid to oppose him.

 Please, please for every mother, son, wife, and
 children left behind, can't someone put a
 stop to this horrible mess before it goes any
 further?  It appears that the U.S. Govern-

 As a private citizen, taxpayer, and voter,
 I am unable to understand the reasons for

 DEAR SIR: I am simply a citizen who feels
 that we are embarked upon a losing so im-
 moral path in Vietnam.  Altho I am aware
 of the many mistakes of U.S. policy of the
 past in this region and of the many fallacies
 and flaws of the present policy, I find it
 difficult to consider alternatives.  Most of
 what I read is either out right opposition,
 with no actual realization of any dangers of
 outright surrender, or approval of the pres-
 ent U.S. policy.  Intelligent criticism, that
 is aware at least of the perils of surrender
 and can consider them and still offer alter-
 natives, is what I seek. If you could send me
 any literature you might have, copies of past
 speeches on this topic or the names of some
 other books so I might read, I would be
 greatly appreciative.

 With assurances of my highest personal

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:    As  I doubt that
 President Johnson's consensus is any less
 evident in Oregon than in my locale in east-
 ern Massachusetts, I wish to congratulate
 you for your (politically) brave stand on this
 Nation's policy of abandon in Vietnam.  Cer-
 tainly, you are alienating many of your con-
 stituents with your statements.  It is absurd
 that the Senate is proving itself so woefully
 lacking in its willingness to get informed on
 the development of U.S. policy in Vietnam
 that only two in its ranks, yourself and Sen-
 ator GRUENING, seem to be able to bring rea-
 son to bear on the problem.  More power to
 you!  Vietnam is obviously too delicate a
 problem to be coped with intelligently by
 politicians.
 I have recently finished reading Harold
 Laski's "The Rise of European Liberalism"
 (1936). Below I have quoted the closing
 passages from that work for you.  In them
 Laski describes his impression of the failure
 of the so-called Liberal states of the 19th
 century to avoid the conflagration of 1914.
 His analysis, which points out the ironies of
 universal ideals compromised  to parochial
 self-interest and reason perverted by crusad-
 ing self-righteousness, seemed to this reader
 compellingly applicable to the posture of the
 present U.S. policy-making machine. At least
 it helps to explain our Government's naive
 understanding of modern Communism, its
 reluctance to understand He, the Viet Minh,
 the Vietcong, Vietnamese-Chinese relations,
 its spurious legitimization of South Vietnam
 in 1954, its sanctification of that regime by
 means of the SEATO protocol in September
 of 1954, and its mounting, of a crusade there
 since 1960.  Surely, the men in our Govern-
 ment who have so consciously pursued a
 power position in Vietnam, a position which
 can be rationalized only through crude abuses
 of fact and history, must feel threatened by
 ideas such as self-determination of peoples,
 anti-colonialism, distribution of goods ac-
 cording to need, to name but a few.
 Whether either blind self-righteousness or
 cunning greed alone inform the outlooks of
 our Vietnam policymakers is impossible to
 determine from my  vantage point.   More
 than likely both these traits are playing im-
 portant  roles  as  our  Government                                                                             enjoys
 equating the protection of mankind's free-
 dom with our national self-interest.                                                                          With
 an unassailable formal justification for our
 policy such as this, it has become increasingly
 impossible for the United States to keep its
 foreign policies geared toward satisfying the
 hoped-for community of diverse nations and
 political systems that gave a reprieve to the
 war-torn  world  in  1945.   In  essence,  the
 United States is committing its power to a
 concept of world order that is already obso-
 lete.                                                                       The self-interest of the United States
 is its own business which it must square
 With the interests of the ?other nations of
 the world; the freedom of mankind is the
 business of a genuine United Nations.
 Well, enough of my theorizing.  Here are
 the passages from Laski:
 "That they  [the  classical  liberals]  had
 made war and revolution in their search for
 authority they either did not remember or
 chose to forget.  That there was a time when
 they,  also, had been driven to  plead for
 understanding and justice and mercy they
 no longer recollected.  That the liberty they
 18433
 cherished was, in sober fact, a freedom denied
 to the overwhelming majority of their fellow-
 citizens too rarely entered into their con-
 scious thoughts.  They had refused to see
 that a just society means either one in which
 there is recognition of an equal claim upon
 the common stock of welfare, or one,  at
 least,  in which differences  in reward are
 capable of justification in terms of relevance
 to that common stock.  They had been con-
 tent to assume that a profitmaking society
 will, as science bestows the fruits of its dis-
 coveries upon mankind, always be wealthy
 enough to buy off its adversaries with mate-
 rial  concessions.   On                                                                                                                                  their  assumptions,
 they could not foresee that the forces of
 production  would  come  into  conflict so
 profound with the relations of production as
 to jeopardize the continuity of all the habits
 by which they shaped their lives.  That con-
 flict  had  been                                                                                                                                 predicted      throughout  the
 course of the 19th century; but, for the most
 part, they had refused to take those steps by
 which its acerbities might have been as-
 suaged.
 "So that when the conflict did come, they
 were unprepared for its advent.  Like their
 predecessors, they fell into angry panic, and
 felt with conviction that no price was too
 high to pay for the retention of their privi-
 lege.  Even when the price exacted was the
 destruction of the liberal spirit, they did not
 hesitate to justify that sacrifice.  They called
 it the common well-being, the maintenance
 of order, the preservation of civilized life.
 They refused to admit that the energizing
 principle of  their  society  was    exhausted.
 They could not believe-even with the evi-
 dence dramatically before their eyes-that
 mankind was ready for a new social order
 based upon a new relation of man to man.
 They had in their hands the choice between
 peace and War.  But so completely were they
 in thrall to the profitmaking motive that, in
 the name of humanity, they blindly chose
 war, without the vision to perceive that the
 thing they called humanity was no Other
 than, the greed they served.  So, as in the
 16th century, mankind seemed to enter upon
 a long period of winter.  We can comfort
 ourselves only with the hope that a later
 generation will detect in its rigors the grim
 prelude to a brighter spring" (pp. 263, 264).

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have a new wrinkle
 of an argument for you in your continuing
 and just fight against the administration's
 immoral policies in Vietnam, though per-
 haps it occurred to you.
 We are allegedly fighting to preserve and
 secure freedom for the South Vietnamese
 and we are using B-52's and napalm in this
 cause.   Do we love freedom so much that
 we would send some marines to South Africa
 to release the hundreds of political prisoners
 there-who  are  imprisoned  because  they
 have stood up for certain minimal human
 rights?  Or is our concern for freedom highly
 selective and relevant only where our banks
 do  not  have significant  investments. In
 short,   our guardianship  of  freedom is
 strangely selective and seems limited to de-
 stroying the terrain of primitive countries
 to stop  communism.   How about freeing
 Albert Luthuli?

 Hon. ROBERT F. KENNEDY,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR KENNEDY: We are tremen-
 dously concerned regarding the escalation of
 our administration's war in Vietnam.  It is
 a war not declared by the Congress or ap-
 proved by the American people.  We believe
 that neither we Americans, nor the Western
 World is being threatened in the manner that
 the Nazis menaced all mankind.
 We further believe that the Vietnamese
 have the right to determine their own destiny
 and their own form of government.  All
 countries cannot be shaped in our image.
 if President Johnson wants free elections,
 let him adhere to the principles agreed to
 at the Geneva convention.
 We urge you to prevail upon our Govern-
 ment to act with sincerity and to talk with
 the majority of the Vietnamese who have
 been fighting for more than 40 years to free
 their country from aggression. The so-called
 ,Vietcong are ' resisting us and it should be
 to these people who are fighting that we must
 address with our proposals of peace, if they
 be real.
 That the German people did not speak out
 and protest a Hitler is now piously lamented.
 We who still have the right of dissent must
 speak up now against the unilateral policy
 decisions which are earning us the enmity
 of the free as well as the 'uncommitted coun-
 tries of the world.  Our stanchest allies can
 hardly contain their criticism of our actions.
 Since our country has not been provoked
 our attitude is insane,  If this madness con-
 tigUes much longer our country will cease
 being a democracy despite the administra-
 tion's brilliant record domestically.
 Where are the leaders who will speak up
 for us?  If no one appears soon enough,
 words ;such as these will soon be deemed trai-
 torous and treasonable.
 May heaven help us.
 Very truly yours,
 Mr. and Mrs. SAMUEL J. HOLLAND,
 BURT S. HOLLAND.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I do not need toex-
 plain to you why I believe our present course
 of action in Vietnam is wrong-if not insane.
 But I can see no hope of reversing it except
 through the action of the U.S. Senate.
 The  people  will  follow  the  President
 blindly, more readily because of his evident,
 sincere desire for peace "with boner."    The
 conditioned reflex of the cry of "stop com-
 munism" is strong.                             But I see little hope of
 a solution along lines acceptable to the Pres-
 ident's advisors through the United Na-
 tions-whom the  Vietcong is  unlikely                                 to
 trust.
 I believe we must get out with what little
 dignity remains possible and save our powder
 for a better fight-which please God may not
 be necessary-such as a Chinese invasion of
 India.  This present one cdn lead to nothing
 but an interminable, massive military occu-
 pation.
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to congratu-

 stand against U.S. military policy in Vietnam.
 This policy (like -a cancer)  has eaten into
 the hearts and minds and morale of our
 American people to the extent that they are
 no longer able to honestly evaluate our ac-
 tions.  I believe the Pentagon must be re-
 sponsible for this.  This damage to ourselves
 could become irreparable if not checked. My
 heart aches for the people of Vietnam.
 What can be done to turn the tide of our
 military policy?  The American people do
 need and want peace.  With all best wishes
 for your continued strength and good health
 to work for peace.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I write to say I ap-

 in which you state you believe the United
 States must take the initiative for peace.
 The President has lagged here, or doesn't
 believe it.
 I am opposed to the present Government
 war policy as I understand it.  I urge you to
 work for cessation of U.S. bombing raids on
 North Vietnam;  cessation of troop move-
 ments to South Vietnam.
 I urge you to continue to work for peace,
 especially to make full use of the U.N. re-
 sources.  I feel the latter has not been done.
 Yours sincerely,

 EAST CHICAGO, IND.,
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to compliment
 you on your stand on the Vietnam crisis.
 It's too bad that we don't have more in the
 Senate today with your understanding.
 I am a lifelong Democrat as my voting in
 East Chicago will verify.  I was one of those
 who welcomed our President to East Chicago
 during the time he ran for President.
 I am very disappointed in his stand on the
 Vietnam policy.  I feel strongly that we have
 no obligation there and especially In the
 needless sacrifice of our American youth.
 Recently I returned from a 4,000-mile vaca-
 tion trip.                                                                     Rather by accident in my travel
 which covered 11 States, the Vietnam situa-
 tion was mentioned and discussed.  Some-
 times it was a gas station attendant and
 others such as fishermen, resort owners, res-
 taurant operators,  etc.  Most of those I
 talked with disclosed their politics, and were
 Democrats, and all of them condemned the
 President and his policy on Vietnam.  In
 Washington,  p.C.,  I heard  the    same
 comments.
 The States through which my travels took
 me were Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio,
 Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C.,
 Virginia,  West  Virginia, North Carolina,
 South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky.
 I estimate that I talked with 40 to 45 per-
 sons.  Remember these are the working class
 of people and not executives, and so forth.
 Also, I determined that by far the largest
 majority were  Democrats and were very
 bitter.
 As a businessman I am hearing the same
 thing from customers every day and this is
 a very strong Democratic vicinity.
 Again congratulations and keep up the
 good work. You are winning a lot of respect.
 Yours truly,
 HERBERT O. JOHNSON.

 present foreign policies.  I am disgusted by
 the acquiescence of Congress in the face of

 GOV. MARK HATFIELD,
 Portland, Oreg.
 DEAR  GOVERNOR  HATFIELD:  With interest
 and satisfaction I noticed that out of all the
 various Governors assembled, only you and
 Governor Romney had sense and courage
 enough to voice opposition to sanctimonious:
 talking Lyndon-come-lately as related par-
 ticularly to the ever-growing-worse situation
 In Vietnam.
 My hat is off to both of you gentlemen
 and my sincere wish is that other men, both
 in Governor's seats and in the U.S. Congress
 will awaken what is going on and side with
 you two gentlemen.
 A fair, sensible and impartial look at U.S.
 Involvement in Vietnam should make every
 Intelligent man and woman realize that from
 the very beginning conditions pertaining to
 U.S. Involvement have steadily gone from bad
 to worse.  And, of late, alarmingly so.
 Henry Cabot Lodge, whom I long ago
 dubbed, "Mr. Saigon failure," accomplished
 little or nothing during his reign in Vietnam.
 Now he is back.  And why?  More because of
 politics than ability.
 Gen. Maxwell Taylor has nothing to boast
 about for his efforts.
 Arrogant McNamara made several trips to
 Vietnam.  And if he accomplished anything
 worthwhile-except  wasting public  money
 on such trips-it has not been apparent.
 It seems to me, as I think it should be to
 anyone and. everyone with good sense, that
 the fault lies with the political leadership
 In Washington.
 The  Vietcong  have,  on  occasions  too
 numerous to mention, made monkeys out of
 the men sent to Vietnam by the Washington
 chapter of the political KKK.
 Just to mention three: When that build-
 ing  was  bombed  killing  several                                                                                                                                 sleeping
 Americans, the official excuse was in the
 jungle  and  couldn't be guarded.   Bah.
 Green, country boys with buckshot could
 have and would have protected that build-
 ing as it should have been. Apparently, no
 leader.
 When those several planes were destroyed.
 Officially, accidental.
 Bah again.  No competent leadership was
 evidently there.
 When correctly timed and planted bombs
 at that floating  restaurant.  These  three
 occurrences should make people wonder why
 this Government did not hire a few Vietcong
 leaders to guide American destinies in Viet-
 nam.
 Now, the United States under the guid-
 ance of the Washington leaders of the polit-
 ical KKK who have made a mess so far in
 Vietnam, is flirting with a real war.
 If we are to become engaged In a real
 war, why, oh why can't the sensible and
 thinking people of America work for and find

 a way to make the nigger vote wooing polit-
 ical racketeers in Washington take a back
 seat, and in their place, put real men to
 guide this Nation when real leadership is
 most wanted?  Men of the caliber of Gen.
 Mark Clark.
 The only war that sanctimonious talking
 Lyndon-come-lately: Smiling, smirking Hu-
 BERT, arrogant McNamara, bullying Katzen-
 bach,  and their tools among the Federal
 judiciary who have made a mockery of city
 and State laws, ban win-have the ability
 to win-ir the war against the hated and
 persecuted South to force equality between
 races that God did not make equal.
 Withholding Federal funds, Federal pa-
 tronage from Members of Congress who dare
 to buck the political KKK, numerous forms
 of reprisals, Federal court edicts that have
 made crimes committed by beastial niggers
 skyrocket, said all such practices of the polit-
 ical KKK will never win a war in Asia or
 Russia.
 This Nation needs real men at the helm
 to guide our destiny-not the poor excuse
 for men with the welfare of their Nation and
 all of its people at heart, that we now suffer
 from.
 Think over what I have told you.  We
 sorely need real  leadership-far different
 from what we now have: a leadership that
 will work for the welfare of this Nation and
 all its people.  Instead of working to win
 the votes of a class that can and will be led
 to the polls as so many sheep.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: May I commend you

 It is heartening to many of us. who feel
 that we are being catapulted into a un-

 some public figures who have the courage to

 Senator LEVERETT SALTONSTALL,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR SALTONSTALL: My deep con-
 cern over the recent stepped-up involvement
 on our part in the war in Vietnam has
 forced me, an unaccustomed public letter
 writer, to write to you.  Like many, I have
 sat by silently awaiting the forces of wisdom
 and restraint to eventually assert them-
 selves in our foreign policy.                    I am now, how-
 ever, appalled and frightened by the accel-
 erated tempo of our determination to risk
 total war as the price of what must appear
 to much of the world as our determination
 to throw our weight around.
 Phrases  such  as  "survival  of  the  free
 world," and "protection of Asia," have ahol-
 low sound as we find no active allies among
 the free world or the Asians.  Indeed, al-
 though our President has clarified what we
 must fight against, there appears little indi-
 cation of any stable entity or philosophy in
 South Vietnam that we are fighting for.  I
 appreciate that the situation cannot be over-
 simplified and that we are in a difficult bind
 in terms of commitments. Yet there must be
 a cheaper price for saving face than further
 immersion In this tragic venture which can
 obviously not be solved through further loss
 of human lives.
 Was it not our fear that just this very kind
 of situation could trigger off another world
 war that made us so determined to set up a
 Council of Nations? Why have we not trans-
 ferred the responsibility of seeking some
 compromise solution for this problem to this
 world body where the United States can take
 its proper, supportive role along with the
 other freedom loving people of the world?
 I do not idealize the power of, the U.N.,
 yet feel  that  It  can only  begin to gain
 statute and become a meaningful instrument
 as we entrust it with the problems of the
 world and invest in it our integri y and
 strength.

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 Washington, D.C.
 SIR: Abraham Lincoln has been credited
 with the statement that "Some of the peo-
 ple can be fooled some of the time but not
 all people can be fooled all the time."  It
 came to mind  Wednesday morning when
 suffering the agony of watching you on my
 television screen announcing the sending of
 countless thousands of young Americans as
 cannon fodder to the slaughterhouse in Viet-
 nam.
 Embarking upon an undeclared war no
 different from the criminal actions of Ger-
 many and Japan when starting World War
 II without the sanction of Congress, in arro-
 gant contempt of and in flagrant violation
 of the Nation's Constitution.   Apart from
 the nauseating grin on your countenance,
 the hypocritical use of the words "peace"
 and "freedom" it was sickening to hear your
 sanctimonious protestations of your concern
 for the young people you are dispatching to
 most cruel, premeditated mass murder and
 misery.
 Like warring heads of state in times past
 you have also invoked the support and bless-
 ings of Providence.   It was the immortal
 Scotch poet Bobby Burns who once exclaimed
 "God does not give nor accept pleas and
 thanks for murder." This on the occasion of
 an  invitation to  participate  in a church
 Thanksgiving ceremony after one of Britain's
 many imperialist,  colonial adventures.   If
 there exists a just Providence what severe
 punishment must await you and your kind
 when summoned to appear on judgment day.
 See   Michelangelo's   masterwork   In   the
 Sistine Chapel in Rome, "The Last Judg-
 ment."
 The German people by silence and acqui-
 escence allowed Hitler to come to power.
 Our planet has still not recovered from that
 tragedy.  Your acts of aggression in Vietnam
 if not stopped can only lead to world war
 III,  for which history will denounce and
 condemn you.
 I, a civilized human nearing the three-
 fourths century mark, will not remain silent.
 For the sake of our planet's preservation and
 in order that America's youth and families
 may live out their lives in peace, uninter-
 rupted by the scourge of war, I demand that
 you cease and desist your acts of aggression.

 DEAR  SIR: Although you are not of my
 home  State,  New  York, nevertheless  the
 views you are holding forth are my views
 and from what I've read in the newspaper,
 may I express my wholehearted admiration
 for your remarkable courage in your out-
 spoken criticism of the President's Vietna-
 mese policy and of the brutal sending of
 our American boys to sacrifice their lives in
 such a coldblooded manner.  I'm shocked
 and may I say that you earn my most pro-
 found respect and may God bless you for
 having  a conscience  and not having  the
 timidity to speak out against the sickening
 war this administration is carrying on with-
 out any regard for our youth and fighting
 men.   I  also have a son  just  turned 18
 who is very depressed and most unhappy
 over the state of affairs now going on in our
 country.  Our Congress is being ignored for
 a formal declaration of war.  We might as
 well have no Constitution for all the admin-
 istration cares.                                                                                                                                          The U.N. is a peacekeeping
 organization.  Where are they functioning,
 on paper only?  Also I see by the newspapers
 that your most worthy Governor, Mark Hat-
 field of Oregon, was the only Governor be-
 sides Governor Romney of Michigan who had
 any spunk to disagree with the other Gov-
 ernors.  It really seems to me, as a resident of
 New York  City, that the  only intelligent
 members of our Government, who have minds
 of their own, are not afraid to express their
 own individual opinions are the rugged in-
 dividualists from the State of Oregon, such
 as yourself, sir, your Governor and also a
 Senator from Alaska.
 Senator MORSE, although I'm only a woman,
 and a poor one at that, were I given the op-
 portunity, I would have liked to get up on
 the floor of Congress and express my anguish
 and sorrow as a mother, and also express the
 pain of the countless millions of mothers of
 our land, the poor people whose lives have
 always been one of hardship and poverty, and
 to have the final insult thrust at them by
 having their  flesh  and blood  sent to  be
 killed-or maimed in a far-off jungle and for
 what, I ask you.  God bless you again, and
 I feel grateful at least that the mothers have
 at least one champion in you to defend us
 in the Halls of Congress.
 May God give you strength to fight those
 policies of the administration in Vietnam and
 to let yourself be heard.

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: This is in inquiry based upon
 fading hope and mounting awe.
 I am shocked by the Vietnam policy of
 the United States.  I have communicated
 this shock to Senator KucHEL, and, to the
 President of the United States.  I have not
 received a reply, despite my letters convey-
 ing an interest in understanding their per-
 ceptions.  But, I need a reply, if only to
 frustrate the growing tension within me
 Which manifests itself by  contaminating
 somewhat the doctrine of peace and democ-
 racy which purportedly motivates our Na-
 tion.  Thus, I am writing you, in the an-
 ticipation that your publically announced
 position on Vietnam will allow you the polit-
 ical freedom to react to my often compro-
 mising questions.
 I Inquired of the Senator and of the Pres-
 ident: by what right does the United States
 impose its might upon a primitive country
 that has for centuries resisted external con-
 trol?  By what authority does the United
 States exercise its weaponry upon innocent
 South Vietnamese  women  and  children?
 Under what aegis does the United States pre-
 empt the United Nations in the search for
 peace, or, if not peace, then negotiation?
 What are our naive assumptions regarding
 the ephemeral nature of the South Vietnam-
 ese  political  puzzle?  What  ideological
 ignorance is the matrix for the apparent pre-
 sumption that the Vietnam population pos-
 sess the awareness of higher authority, na-
 tional identity, or personal integrity suffi-
 dent to form the conviction demanded for
 victory, or even combat?  What evidence is
 there which suggests the commitment of the
 lay South Vietnamese individual, who, ulti-
 mately, will be expected to power the social
 aspect of reconstruction? What is the pro-
 tracted  design                        regarding southeast  Asia?
 Is Vietnam a bogus issue, and is Red China
 the ultimate foe?  What is the reason for
 the apparent disparity between the combat
 troop reports (on deficiencies of weapons,
 material, etc.)  and the Pentagon reports?
 How do you account for the likely bamboo-
 zling of the public by the administration,
 which manifests itself in weekly estimate
 contradictions,  reversing  position  evalua-
 tions, heavy press censure, etc?  How can
 one American death be justified in a war
 that isn't a war, fought by native soldiers
 who aren't soldiers, for a government that
 isn't a government?  Is the stability of the
 mightiest Nation in the history of man de-
 pendent on aggression?   And lastly, what
 happened to Goliath?
 I wonder how representative our Govern-
 ment really is.                      Thank you for your con-
 sideration.
 Sincerely,
 GREELEY, COLO.

 learn.  Is it true that luxury living only
 breeds rabble and it takes 200 years for that
 rabble to getstrong enough to rule things.
 Elections in our loved land Is now only a
 farce.  Under a really free election the people
 who have gotten elected for the last 35 years
 would never have made it.  These people
 fear the truth worse than the Devil hates
 holy water.  What good is education if it
 does not teach godliness, patriotism, honor,
 duty, cleanliness of mind and body, and most
 of all love to work, not play.
 We know that for many years there has
 been an evil force working to destroy every-
 thing that makes life worth living.  They
 talk of progress-the only progress they are
 making is back not forward.  And as sad as
 it is this has all been planned from the
 start of our loved land.  The Constitution,
 the envy of the world, is no longer a shield
 but a weapon.  All this did not just happen,
 but was planned.
 Now anyone with the courage to stand
 against them gets the smear act.  They dare
 not star` an argument by attacking what
 they say, for they only tell the truth-and
 the truth must not be known, at any price.
 The CONGRESSIONAL RECORD Is full of truths,
 but are being ignored.  Let me suggest you
 read up on your history and see if you want
 the same kind of government that men have
 struggled for years to free themselves from.
 Or is the people under 45 unable to be any-
 thing but slaves.
 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,
 New York, N.Y., July 31, 1965.
 LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The President,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR Ma. PRESIDENT: I em writing in sor-
 row and outrage that our country has pro-
 ceeded with an extremely serious escalation
 of the Vietnam war, masked by appeals for
 peace.  Many who voted for you, like myealf,
 voted for opposition to Senator Goldwater's
 call for war.  We will not be deceived by
 words which are denied by actions.
 Others who are now swayed by admira-
 tion of your domestic program and the au-
 thority of your office will be shocked to reality
 as the costs of our country's intervention
 mount.  If vigorous protests were made to
 Democratic Senators and Congressmen when
 an immediate call of the Reserves was ex-
 pected, what will happen when the costs of
 a war which has increasingly ominous pros-
 pects hits vast numbers of our people?
 Reality will not forever be masked by word
 illusions.
 Moreover, I urge that you consider the
 wiser voices of our friends before we suffer
 new setbacks.  As the Manchester Guardian
 recallad  on June  27,  we  twice  removed
 Souvanna Phouma with unhappy results, and
 our illusion that if only foreign subversion
 could be stopped, all would be well is a fatal
 misconcetpion.  As our own press has em-
 phasized,  the  North Vietnam aid became
 significant only after our mounting interven-
 tion.
 Since you quoted the Bible in your Johns
 Hopkins address, it is appropriate to urge
 that you consider another part,  As a man
 sows, so shall he reap."
 Even at this late hour, let us turn from
 words of peace with acts of war to both
 words and acts of peace.  Ask the United
 Nations to organize negotiations among all
 parties involved in the Vietnam war.  This
 will include the Vietminh as well as the
 government of North Vietnam.
 Respectfully yours,
 EDWIN S. CAMPBELL,
 Associate Professor of Chemistry.
 P.S.-I am enclosing a copy of this letter
 in appreciation of your persistent effort for a
 peaceful solution of the Vietnamese war.
 Your work is needed more than ever before.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Enclosed Is a copy

 helps in your brave attempt to keep our
 Government from escalating this war to a
 point of no return.
 Good luck.

 President LYNDON B. JoHNsoN,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I speak to you as a
 mother and want to assure you first of all
 that I am fully aware of the awesome job
 you have as our President.
 As a mother I also have the job of giving
 my son confidence that if he is drafted to go
 to South Vietnam he is doing the right thing
 for his country to kill and perhaps be killed.
 In this capacity I would appreciate it very
 much if you would answer some very trou-
 bling questions.
 In essence you say that we are fighting in
 that small country to keep men free so that
 the ideology of communism will not spread
 in southeast Asia and then have the oppor-
 tunity to come to this country.
 From all reliable reports I have heard the
 majority of people in South Vietnam are
 with or for the Vietcong.  If the majority of
 South  Vietnamese  people  are  with  the
 Vietcong and are helping them fight the
 Saigon Government, my commonsense tells
 me that the Vietcong must be better to the
 people than  the   Government Of Saigon
 which we are keeping in power.
 My questions are:
 1. If the majority of people In South
 Vietnam do not want the Saigon Govern-
 ment ruling them, why should we, thousands
 of miles away, insist, by such methods as we
 are using, that these people be ruled by a
 government they are fighting to get rid of?
 2. Is it our job to tell these millions of
 people that they don't know what is good
 for them?
 3. Shall I tell my son that we are killing
 the Vietcong because we say they are Com-
 munists, and Communists are very bad peo-
 ple in our thinking?
 4. If such be the case then why don't we
 send our army to the other Communist
 countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland,
 Checzoslavakia, Romania, etc., etc., instead
 of having diplomatic and economic relations
 with them?
 5. I would like to tell my son, Mr. Presi-
 dent, what you think a Communist is and.
 just what does communism mean?
 It seems to me that our country's approach
 to the whole Communist problem, (if that's
 what you say our problem Is) is inconsistent
 and really makes no sense to me at all so
 that I could not in good consciousness at
 this point tell my son to go to South Viet-
 nam and in this way help our country.

 NEW YORK, N.Y.,
 July 31, 1965.
 MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I enclose a copy
 of a letter to Mr. Leon Stein, editor of Justice,
 ILGWU, for your reference.
 I regret that I cannot vote for you.  For
 awhile I thought that men like you are no
 longer around.  Although the workers are
 inarticulate because of the suppression of
 democracy in the unions, they are with you
 in this great struggle for morality and the
 good  name of   our country.   History will
 prove you right; unfortunately, the Pentagon
 slay 'swallow millions of lives to provide the
 proof.
 May God be with you all the time.
 Very truly yours,
 JULIUS BUCHWALD.
 NEW YORK, N.Y.,
 July 31, 1965.
 Mr. LEON STEIN,
 Editor, Justice, International Ladies Gar-
 ment Workers Union, New York, N.Y.
 DEAR MR. STEIN: Thank you for your letter
 of June 21, 1965, concerning my suggestion
 that you invite Senator MORSE to reply to
 Dean Rusk's remarks in Justice.  In my let-
 ter of June 4, 1965, I also indicated that in
 the spirit of the current discussion-of Amer-
 loan policy in Vietnam, and in the best inter-
 est of our union, it is essential that all
 pertinent views be heard.
 You state, however, that "The two basic,
 divergent positions in Vietnam were pre-
 sented fully and effectively by two leading
 spokesmen-Senators DODD and CHuRcH-in
 the March 15, 1965, issue of Justice."
 I have. studied the matter and feel that
 since the article by Senator  CHURCH  ap-
 peared more than a month before the Rusk
 excerpts, it cannot be considered an ade-
 quate reply to both DODD and Rusk.                        Also,
 Senator CHURCH'S position is weak and self-
 contradictory.
 Senator  CHURCH asks:  "Why  have      we
 spread ourselves so thin? What compulsion
 draws us ever deeper, into the internal af-
 fairs of so many countries in Africa and
 Asia, having so remote a connection with
 the vital interests of the United States?"
 And he asserts: "Such a vast undertaking
 has at least two defects: First, it exceeds our
 national  capability;  second,  among  the
 newly emerging nations, where the specter
 of Western imperialism is dreaded more than
 -,communism,  such a policy can be self-
 defeating.  As a' seasoned, friendly foreign
 diplomat recently put it: `The United States
 is getting -involved in situations where no
 one-not even a nation of saints-would be
 welcome: "
 But then he adds: "the judicious use of
 both the arrows and the olive branch repre-
 sents our best hope for avoiding a widening
 war in Asia."
 How does this position differ from the ad-
 ministration's?  Come, come, Mr. Stein, do
 you really believe, do you, that Senator
 CHURCH represents the other basic, divergent
 position?  In effect, Senator CHURCH says
 bomb North Vietnam "judiciously" and talk
 about negotiations because "we are losing
 the contest."  Senator CHURCH appears to
 be somewhat more cautious than the admin-
 istration;
 A report concerning a debate between Sen-
 ator CHURCH and. Republican Representative
 FORD of Michigan defines Senator CHURCH's
 position: "A long-time critic of U.S. policies
 on   Setilaiil  from  the  liberal  side,  Mr.
 ro.141-i2
 CHURCH was forced by Mr. FORD'S arguments
 into  a  defense  of  the  administration's
 strategy. The Idaho Democrat declared that
 an abrupt step-up of the war by U.S. air
 attacks would almost certainly bring the
 North Vietnamese Army to intervene in force.
 This would mean the very type of land war
 that Mr. FORD wishes to avoid, Mr. CHURCH
 argued."   (New York Times, July 19, 1965.)
 It is obvious that Senator CHURCH' merely
 objects to our spreading ourselves "so thin"
 and to the "abrupt" step-up of the war, but
 not to a gradual step-up of the war.  I find
 Senator CHURCH'S position very interesting.
 I do not understand on what basis you
 determined that there are two basic posi-
 tions on Vietnam.  May I point out that
 there are other "basic" opinions.   For ex-
 ample:
 Walter Lippmann maintains that North
 Vietnam, Saigon, and the National Libera-
 tion Front (Vietcong) should decide the is-
 sues  for  themselves.  In  the  New  York
 Herald Tribune, July 8, 1965, Mr. Lippmann
 says: "The new policy would have to be, it
 seems to me, a pullback of our forces from
 the defense of villages and small towns to
 one or more highly fortified strongpoints
 with certain access to the sea, and then to
 advise Saigon that it should seek to make
 peace with the Vietcong and with North
 Vietnam."
 And Bertrand Russell has said: "The U.S.
 Government is conducting a war of annihi-
 lation in Vietnam.  The sole purpose of the
 war is to retain a brutal and feudal regime
 in the south, and to exterminate all those
 who resist the dictatorship of the south.  A
 further purpose is an invastion of the north,
 which is in Communist hands.
 -. "The real concern which brings the United
 States to pursue the brutal policy abandoned
 by France in Indochina is the protection of
 economic interests and the prevention of far-
 reaching social reforms in that part of the
 world."   (Letter to the editor, New York
 Times, Apr. 9, 1965.)
 In the New York Times Magazine section,
 January 3, 1965, the well-known playwright,
 Arthur Miller, spoke out against the atroc-
 ities committed by the Saigon regime: "Who
 among us knew enough to be shocked, let
 alone to protest, at the photographs of the
 Vietnamese  torturing  Vietcong  prisoners,
 which our press has published?   The Viet-
 namese are wearing U.S. equipment, are paid
 by us, and could not torture without us.
 There is no way around this-the prisoner
 crying out in agony is our prisoner."
 Lewis Mumford, president of the American
 Academy of Arts and Letters, denounced U.S.
 political and military policy in Vietnam as a
 "moral  outrage."   (The  Nation,  June  21,
 1965.)
 On July 16, 1965, on the Senate floor, Sena-
 tor WAYNE MORSE stated: "I have said for
 many months that I am satisfied, as a mem-
 ber of the Foreign Relations Committee of
 the U.S. Senate, that we have a dangerous,
 desperate group of men in the Pentagon who
 want a preventive war against China and who
 would like to create an opportunity to bomb
 the Chinese nuclear installations.  I consider
 them the most desperate and dangerous men
 in all the World,"     (CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,
 pp. 16523 ff.)
 Here, Mr. Stein, are five opinions which
 justice must take note of, if it intends to pre-
 sent "basic, divergent positions" on Vietnam.
 This may interest you, Mr. Stein: In the edi-
 torial section of the New York, Times, July
 25, 1965, an article by E. W. Kenworthy is cap-
 tioned, "Johnson's Policy in Vietnam-Four
 Positions in Congress."
 I have suggested that you print Senator
 MORSE's opinion because he is the foremost
 American opponent of the Johnson policy
 and he  emphasizes  the imnmorality,  the
 atrocity, the criminality of U.S. aggression in
 Vietnam.  Senator CHURCH complains only
 18437
 that we are "exceeding our national capaoll-
 ity" and that we are "losing this contest."
 What would he say if we were winning?
 Publishing Dean Rusk's statements without
 an adequate reply places our paper in the
 category of an organ of the State Depart-
 ment and the Pentagon, in the service of
 war propaganda.  There must be equal space
 for all pertinent views.  This is the American
 way, Mr. Stein.
 In order that Vietnam may be fully dis-
 cussed, and in order to stimulate discus-
 sion on other important national issues and
 trade problems, I suggest that you estab-
 lish a "Letter to the editor" department in
 Justice, and I hereby submit this letter for
 such a department.
 I also wish to take this opportunity to
 express my indignation at your using our
 union paper for Mr. George Meany's vulgar-
 ity.                                                                                                                                   I am referring to the May 15-June 1
 issue of Justice, in which Mr. Meany defines
 the  academic community  as  "intellectual
 jitterbugs  and  nitwits." Should  someone
 offer you such trash for publication in the
 future, please, Mr. Stein, think before you
 print.
 I look forward to your reply to the issues
 I have raised.

 CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, OHIO,
 July 31, 1965.
 Honorable Senator WAYNE F. MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: While you're not a
 Senator from Ohio (more's the pity), I have
 followed your Senate career and feel I can
 write to you and have a sympathetic ear.
 I am unequivocally opposed to the whole
 Vietnam mess and think the United States,
 under President Johnson (although I voted
 for him because I thought he would not get
 us into a war), is treading a dangerous and
 horrible path.  During my vacation travels
 (on this continent) I've heard nothing but
 grave opposition and real concern at the bel-
 ligerent steps taken by our President. I hope
 you and many other Senators will have the
 intestinal fortitude to stand up against this
 foolhardy increase in men and munitions to
 Vietnam.  You will have my support and
 that of many, many others if you do.  And I
 am mindful that you and Senator CHURCH
 were the only ones (that I remember, any-
 way), who stood out against this in the
 beginning. I think it is monstrous and dis-
 graceful that our President has so high-
 handedly bypassed the U.N.  If it fails, we
 are the ones who made the most massive
 hatchet stroke to bring about its downfall.
 It occurs to me that once again the House
 of Representatives will rubberstamp John-
 son's and McNamara's demands for funds to
 carry this on. Wars never settled any prob-
 lems and never will.  It seems to me that
 man's inhumanity to many is a greater curse
 to the world today than communism.   I
 hope you in the Senate will have the cour-
 age to speak out and vote against any further
 increase in money or men for Vietnam. We
 surely would be the first to protest if they
 tried to come over and bomb us into settling
 our racial problems, in the South or North.
 ARBOR NALL FARM,
 Stilwell, Kans., July 29, 1965.
 Senator MORSE: Keep fighting for a new
 foreign policy.  War is too important to be
 left to the generals.
 We cannot be policemen for the world.

 NEW ORLEANS, LA.,
 July 29,1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Perhaps if I knew
 all  the  facts I wouldn't  agree with you.
 However, from what I've been able to gather,
 our stand in Vietnam is wrong-not to men-
 tion the Dominican Republic.
 L.B.J. did not receive a mandate; it was a
 popular rejection of what Goldyvater stood
 for  ("even Lyndon").  It's ironic that the
 public seems to be getting what, in essence,
 they voted down at the polls in 1964.
 There seems to be an inference that if one
 doesn't agree with the administration, he is
 slightly less than patriotic.  I say "Hogwash,
 and hurray for an intelligent opposition."  I
 have never written a letter like this before,
 but I want you to know that some people
 think highly of you for your courage to stand
 on a seemingly unpopular issue.
 Respectfully yours,
 LAWRENCE Y. YATSU.
 JULY 30, 1965.
 The Honorable Senator WAYNE MORSE:
 Again I have written to our President to
 recommend to him your thinking on Vietnam
 situation.  On page 2 of today's New York
 Times, our President is quoted as being grate-
 ful to the women of the land who support
 his position in Vietnam.  Today, I wrote to
 him explicitly and solely to tell him that
 many "women of the land" are opposed to
 his position in Vietnam.
 Again I read with interest and hope what-
 ever the press prints on your position in
 Vietnam.  I have also written to my Sen-
 ators KENNEDY and JAVITS.
 Respectfully,
 VICTORIA, TEX.

 most of the people in this area concur with
 statements you have made.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 The U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: We should like to congratulate
 you on your publicly critical attitude to-
 ward   the   administration's   Vietnamese
 policy.
 Not only is our position in Vietnam his-
 torically illegal and immoral, but it is tragi-
 cally naive to suppose that a political-
 philosophic movement can be halted with
 guns.  We have, in effect, advanced the
 cause of communism by meddling in Viet-
 nam.                   We should never have been in that
 country, and whatever tenuous support we
 had originally from a singularly corrupt,
 nonrepresentative government is gone.  It
 would appear that due to a recurring, patho-
 logical fear of communism, we are being
 taken down a garden path with patriotic
 platitudes masking a radioactive end.
 We regret that the Senators from Illinois
 are not able to approach the beginnings and
 the end of the Vietnamese question as ra-
 tionally and intelligently as you are.  It is
 regrettable that they show no inclination to
 stop the blind rush to disaster, but we are
 grateful for your continued efforts to bring
 some sense to our policymakers.
 Very truly yours,
 CARLA C. WILDE.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SENATOR MORSE:  The  attached  col-
 umn of Walter Lippmann pretty well ex-
 presses the opinion I have of our involvement
 in the Vietnam conflict.
 In the first place, I am more or less of a
 loss to know what we are doing there.  In
 the second place, that area appears as a poor
 place to have drawn a line in a stand against
 Communist expansion.
 I think that if we had conducted our
 diplomacy right we could have pitted Russia
 against China and restricted our policeman
 role to the Western Hemisphere.
 It appears that we sometime go out of our
 way to get involved in the internal affairs
 of some undeveloped country.  While pre-
 tending to contain communism in some far
 corner of the world, we suffer it to gain a foot-
 hold at our very doorstep.
 It would certainly shock the world if we
 admitted our mistake and withdrew our
 forces from Vietnam.  It is often said that
 it takes a big man to admit his errors.  I
 doubt if we have this kind of big men in con-
 trol of our affairs.
 I have observed with interest your posi-
 tion on some of our foreign affairs issues.
 I hear many expressions of concern locally
 about the position of our administration in
 current foreign affairs.
 Very respectfully yours,
 BRYAN J. MCCALLEN.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: I find myself in a very difficult
 position as do friends of mine and others
 whom I have talked to.  I love my country,
 not in a chauvinistic way, but because of its
 historical roots, its people, the land itself,
 and the possibilities that exist here for the
 development of the human being.  All these
 things I love, however, are now threatened by
 developments  in American  foreign  policy.
 The greatest threat to human development
 is not communism, but perversion of those
 ideals which America has always claimed to
 .believe in,  We have become a nation that is
 Increasingly willing to violate its own pro-
 fessed standards of freedom and justice out
 of an unhealthy and irrational fear of com-
 munism.                                                                                  That word has come to mean to
 us what the word devil meant to our Puritan
 ancestors. This fear has driven us to a course
 of aggression and violation of the right to
 self-determination in Vietnam and the Do-
 minican Republic.  We are pursuing policies,
 especially in Vietnam, that can only lead to
 increased suffering and the decline in moral
 force of the United States, if not to the de-
 struction of our whole civilization.  I love
 my country, but I cannot support it.  I be-
 lieve in the ideals that we profess, and they
 must be practiced, not just given lip serv-
 lee.   It is the discovery that my country
 and its government does not always believe
 in them and is willing to condone grave viola-
 tions of those ideals that hurts most.  The
 only course that I can see for persons like
 myself is to refuse to cooperate with our Gov-
 ernment until it changes its immoral, illegal,
 and dangerous foreign policy.  I urge you to
 use the power and influence of your office
 to seek a sane and just path to world order,
 and I congratulate you on the valiant effort
 that you have made to date.
 Sincerely,

 DEAR Sin: Don't you think that the right

 Please insist that the right to declare war

 ple who must fight those wars.  Please open
 debate  on  our   Vietnamese  participation.
 Please question our course.
 We are burning and bombing, torturing

 This is not my conception of our honor.   Is
 it yours?

 Stop ruthless bombing and killing.  Start

 MY DEAR SENATOR WAYNE MORSE:
 Thank God for your ability to voice your
 convictions so strongly.                                                  I am with you 100
 percent and I think I would explode if I did,
 not hear you voice my convictions against
 the behavior of our Government.                                           I sit here
 helpless, convinced that the United States
 is behaving badly. Thank God again for you.
 I have found a new faith, the Bahai faith,
 a faith with a plan for a Godly world gov-
 ernment.  I understand Woodrow Wilson's
 sister was a Bahai and no doubt the Pres-
 ident got his idea for the League of Nations
 from her. Now we have the U.N. along the
 same line. Rome was not made in a day,

 and if we persevere we may bring to frui-
 tion the projected plan of Bahaullah, a
 prophet with a message for this new era.
 If you are not familiar with this faith I
 believe you might benefit immensely by get-
 ting some of the literature.
 I went from church to church looking for
 a solution to solve the corruptness of our
 country.  I found the faith I had in mind,
 a faith with a plan for coexistence.  Now
 I am thinking in, a straight line which is a
 comfort and I must again say: Thank God
 for you, who can express so aptly my desires
 for the United States.
 I have 19 grandchildren.  Five wonderful
 children. We made the grade in spite of our
 inequality in our economy.  I hope we can
 build a semblance of equality.
 Thank you again for your fairness to all

 Re Vietnam mail.
 'DEAR SENATOR: Today I read an article in
 the  Christian  Science Monitor  entitled,
 "Viet Mails Run Light in Senate." This ax
 ticle stated that the Vietnam mail to Sena-
 tors is falling. off but that the percentage of
 protest against the military buildup is still
 running high.
 The Vietnam mail is running low, because
 the American public is not only uninformed
 but, worse yet, it is misinformed.  For the
 former. they are to blame, but for the latter
 you Senators are to blame, unless you, too,
 have been taken in by the frightening blan-
 dishments of the Pentagon, and unless you,
 too, are unaware of the facts of history, past
 and present, concerning Vietnam.
 If you are not aware of these facts, read
 the  recent speeches  of  Senators WAYNE
 MORSE, FULBRIGHT, and GRUENING (CONGRES-
 SIONAl,  RECORD).                             Armed with this undis-
 putable  information,  certainly                       you would
 have the courage to join ranks with these
 men and make all possible haste to inform
 and  arouse  the      complacent,  indifferent
 American public about Vietnam and the in-
 evitable, useless massacre of Americans and
 Orientals which is going to take place if
 offensive ground action is taken over by
 American forces-to what end?
 Your job Is to help the gullible, brain-
 washed Americans to save themselves rather
 than to sell them down the river to our mili-
 tary-industrial complex for a profit.
 Those Who know the score are begging you
 for assistance.
 P.S.-Has the U.S. Senate abdicated its
 constitutional right to declare or not to de-
 clare war?
 NEWBURG PARK, CALIF.,
 July 27,1965.
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 The Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: Thank God for men of courage,
 like yourself, sir, who see the disaster ahead
 and who are not afraid to speak out the
 truth.
 The appalling side thought is that so-called
 intelligent statesmen (I will not dignify the
 military with this adjective) learn nothing
 from the history of Napoleon, Hitler, et al.,
 and expect to wage a successful war with
 such over extended, supply lines, so close to
 the enemy and so far from home.
 I am writing, as I have from the onset, to
 President Johnson, HUBERT HUMPHREY, the
 late Mr. Stevenson, etc., in, protest of our
 insane policy, but I feel a positive note to
 you is much more constructive, and will be
 counted among the many, many thousands
 I am sure you receive.
 I, for t'Tte first time in my 45 years walked
 a precinct, in the heart of this John Birch
 Society area, in behalf of Mr. Johnson be-
 cause of the policies he once claimed but has
 now abandoned.
 If, in the next presidential election, it
 should be possible to work for one, Senator
 WAYNE  MORSE,  I know I shall work even
 harder, and no matter what the results, I
 shall not wind up with the taste of bitter
 ashes in my mouth.
 Sincerely,
 CHARLES S. BRUCK.
 WEST HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.,
 July 30, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                                       It seems desperate
 to think this way, but I am finally con-
 vinced that the only way that the American
 people, and the people in this planet can
 avoid extreme disaster or extinction, is for
 those who clearly see what McNamara and
 the Pentagon gang are up to, to start a new
 political party.  It is obvious that neither of
 the two major parties as constituted today
 offer the slightest hope.  A new political
 party has to have as its principles, a foreign
 policy of real peace and living together with
 other nations through the U.N.regardless of
 their political orientation.  Let us realize,
 that the Communist nations have not been
 military aggressors, but we have and con-
 stantly are.
 I feel that you or people around you who
 support you could assume the leadership of
 such a party, and I am sure that, even though
 you will be villified, and called names, many
 thousands and  maybe millions of college
 people, intellectuals, rank and file workers,
 and certainly mothers, will rally to the ban-
 ner of a party of real peace and decent rights
 for all.
 I hope that you can consider this matter
 carefully.  I feel that it not only has merit,
 but hope.  It is the only thing I can think
 of that does.
 Yours very truly,
 July 27, 1965.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE.
 MR. SENATOR: I am writing you to express
 how much I appreciate the fight you are
 waging against the war in Vietnam and I
 would like to know how they know how the
 American people think.  I want you to know
 that I and many others think as you do.
 Keep up the good work.
 Many good wishes,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,.
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Despite the lateness
 of the hour, it surely is not too late to stage
 a debate on the conduct and ultimate goals
 of the war in Vietnam, At least we have that
 coming to us.  The most deadly serious ac-
 tions and commitments are made in the,
 name of us all by a series of virtual executive
 fiats.  I am convinced that the role of a
 Member of the Congress of the United States
 is not to simply melt into a "patriotic" mass
 known as a consensus every time a contre-
 temps arises outside our borders.  There ex-
 ists a great vacuum waiting to be filled by a
 genuine opposition.  As far as I can see by
 reading what is vouchsafed to us as suitable,
 Congress acts more or less as a rubber stamp
 whenever the combjngii, weight and prestige
 of the President and his military advisers
 is brought to bear.
 How many years are we prepared to oc-
 cupy South Vietnam?  North Vietnam?  Do
 we intend to wipe out entirely the Vietcong
 insurgents from the face of the earth-if
 this were possible?  Are we prepared to take
 on China on the ground?  Are we looking
 for some trumped-up excuse dreamed up in
 the military circles for bombing China's nu-
 18439
 clear establishments?  Will we launch into
 another "Vietnam" in Thailand?  Cambodia?
 Are we to police the whole of southeast Asia?
 Are we to fall all over ourselves to rush to the
 beck and call of any threatened regime, any-
 where, regardless of how unworthy and inept,
 when the local politicians cry "Communist
 wolf?"
 Has anyone pointed out, when all the hor-
 rified murmurs about "loss of prestige" come
 up when it is suggested we think up a quick
 way out of Vietnam, that the French suffered
 a disastrous defeat in that wretched coun-
 try, and pulled out ignominiously.  French
 prestige, French prosperity have- never been
 higher in years than at this time.  France is
 universally admired and fawned upon by
 those very peoples one would have expected
 to gloat and crow and never allow her to for-
 get what happened in Indochina.
 After four and a half years in England and
 Canada I grew accustomed to lively and thor-
 ough parliamentary debates, where no quar-
 ter was given or expected.  I returned home
 recently and find myself dismayed at the lack
 of discussion, the poor reportage on what the
 opinions of Members of Congress actually
 are on foreign affairs.
 I'm very happy to see, however, that Sen-
 ator MoRsE is still functioning as an excel-
 lent approximation of a full-scale opposition,
 and as the conscience of the Senate.  I sa-
 lute you, sir.
 Yours sincerely,
 Mrs. CECILE H. BOSTROM.

 DEAR SIR: I support your position on the

 am writing you is to ask you for suggestions
 about who I should write to.  I don't flatter
 myself  that  my  letters  will carry  much
 weight, but I know they will carry more of
 whatever weight they have if they get to the
 right place. Please help me.

 Los ANGELES, CALIF.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Several days ago I re-
 turned home after a fortnight in the hospital
 where I enjoyed the advantages of mid-
 20th century medicine and surgery to find
 myself once again in a world in part still
 governed by principles of the stone age.
 Previously I had addressed myself to you
 on the subject of our policies and conduct
 in southeast Asia.   The events of  recent
 months force me again to protest against
 them. The talk should not be of national
 honor but of national preservation, not of

 international responsibilities but of inter-
 national morality.
 To think that the other side can be driven
 to the negotiating table by force of arms is
 to deny all knowledge and understanding of
 human thinking and action.   Negotiations
 can never be undertaken if one side an-
 nounces in advance what It demands for
 satisfaction, for, then, what would be the
 reason for negotiating?
 The blasphemous morality of equating our
 side with God and assigning the other to the
 anti-Christ, of confusing what is God's with
 what is Caesar's, with assuming that political
 and economic systems unlike our own are
 damned, all this may confuse and lead astray
 the thoughtless among our own citizens, but
 not the thoughtful here and abroad.
 May I urge you to temper our policies so
 that among us it will again be recognized
 that "Blessed are the peacemakers," that our
 country be known for its moral might, not its
 military power.
 I am taking the liberty of sending copies
 of this letter to Senators KUCHEL, MURPHY,
 GRuENING, and MORSE.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Every so often we, in
 this snug little, snug little, low-key pitched
 news media area--get, rumbling usually tele-
 vision-of that healthy voice from the north-
 west United States, last stand of the "Bill of
 Rights and the Constitution," which you
 have so long and faithfully and dedicatedly
 and tirelessly represented in Congress. Your
 long and principled devotion to the demo-
 cratic -ideals to which our country has as-
 pired (until Hiroshima and Nagasaki and
 its compromises with the Nazi's in W. Ger-
 many)-deserve  eulogies by your  conati-
 tuenoy  casts a real light of political "en-
 lightenment" upon the State you represent
 and shines like a neon ,sign in a desert of
 gloom. Long may you voice the principles,
 ideas and practicality In a precarious age-
 of international peace and universal brother-
 hood of man.
 And like Abou ben Adam: May your tribe
 increase" And I say-to Democrats and Re-
 publicans and Liberals alike sabre rattling
 bomb-poise breathing forth threads and
 bombast of all world tyrannies-"a plague
 In all your houses."  A party of peace un-
 conditional peace, global peace Is the only
 party (and its candidate for public office I
 shall ever support again).  I nominate you
 to search such out.
 Anyway thank you for your opposition to
 the  "military-industrial  complex"-Penta-
 gon, "face savers" in the administration;
 unilaterlalists in foreign policy Congresses.
 Men---and all such public common weal-
 disservicers-Congress should reassume by
 it

 has delegated to the President over the years
 since 1950.  And never again any admin-

 What I can't understand is why we send
 our men to Vietnam to fight for the freedom
 of colored people, when we deny that same
 freedom to the colored citizens in our own
 country.
 I wonder what the President and the Con-
 gress would do if Africa or.China or Russia,
 were to send soldiers and bombs to the United
 States to fight for the freedom of our Ne-

 I, too, believe we are rushing into world

 "Dear President Johnson: Wednesday, St.
 Louis Post Dispatch, July 28, 1965, has an
 -Interview  by  Larry  Johnson, American
 Broadcasting Co., on his return to St. Louis
 for treatment of grenade wounds.  He was
 asked how the war In Vietnam had changed
 since 3 years ago when he was there.  He
 said the only difference was the war was now
 expanded.  'And   now   the   Vietnamese
 couldn't care less which side wins.'
 "Is this the freedom we are drafting our
 sons for?  To die in a jungle 12,000 miles
 from Washington, D.C.?
 "President Kennedy said the Vietnamese
 have to fight this out.  Now we are combat
 troops, no longer advisers.  The Saturday
 Evening Post's Stewart Alsop says 58 percent
 of the American people do not support the
 war in Vietnam.  Please call a halt to the
 shooting-cease fire-and then negotiate.

 DEAR SENATOR: It seems to me that there
 is only one way to stop President Johnson
 dead in his tracks on the Vietnam situation,
 and that is by setting up committees In every
 city of any size to collect signatures to be
 sent to congressional Representatives and
 Senators calling for the immediate impeach-
 ment of the President violating the Con-
 stitution of our country and for reneging on
 his campaign pledges.  I've sounded out a
 lot of people, in all walks of life, and they
 think it would catch and go like wildfire.
 But it takes someone prominent in political
 life to launch the thing.  You could do it.
 I'm an oldtime ex-union organizer.  I've
 learned that to be effective when you are
 unable to stop someone you must go for
 his throat.  And a threat of impeachment,
 merely the gathering of hundreds of thou-
 sands of signatures, would be a real lunge
 for the President's vulnerable jugular vein.
 I'm convinced it would work.  And I know
 of no other way to get him to listen to reason,
 I hope you will seriously consider this
 step.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE : May the good God
 strengthen you In your marvelous courage
 to uphold sanity and human values in this
 deplorable condition in which we of the
 United States have become embroiled.
 it seems to me the Senate is letting us
 the people down.  Acquiescence is given
 each new rapid step in the escalation, no
 matter what individual Senators have pre-
 viously said about the need for careful ex-
 ploration of the entire Vietnam situation,
 if it developed further.
 Two things call for most careful, con-
 scientious probing.
 First. The President's declaration that our
 cause Is just.
 "Once to every man and nation comes the
 moment to decide etc."
 Second. Today the President said the pres-
 ent course might take many years in its
 completion.
 This latter is a terrific statement given as
 a "plausible possibility."
 How can our Congress fail to open the
 whole situation, lest this brings the end of
 Western civilization?   How blind are we?
 You are our one greatest champion.  Our
 fervent appreciation and earnest prayers are
 yours.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Please accept my
 thanks for your firm opposition to the Viet-

 so few, and so quickly stifled.
 We said goodbye to our only son last night
 as he left for that war, and we cannot, in
 spite of all we have read, studied, or listened
 to, give ourselves any good reason for his
 going.  We have had years of evasion, sec-
 recy and lies, so why should the American
 people now believe anything coming out of
 Washington?  The President does not know,
 nor can he ever, the tears of a mother,
 father, wife or child.  That is nauseating
 hogwash.
 Please continue your stand.   There are
 those of us who applaud you, and thank
 you.

 to you my deepest respect and admiration
 and thanks for the courageous role you have
 taken  upon  yourself  on  the  question  of
 United States involvement in Vietnam.     I
 believe that you personally are responsible
 to a large degree for the increasing willing-
 ness of our Government to take this matter
 before the United Nations.   I also believe
 that through your speeches before the Senate
 and by your personal appearances, such as
 at the Madison Square Garden rally of June
 8, you have given strength and hope to mil-
 lions of Americans who protest our role in
 Vietnam.  As one who has been involved in
 this struggle for the past several months I
 can testify to how easy it is to lose heart
 and get discouraged as more and more men
 are sent over, and how much it means to
 have someone  who is  part  of  the power
 structure of this country who is willing to
 speak out against our role. I don't know
 what the outcome of this struggle will be,
 but if our Government does decide to take
 this matter directly before the United Na-
 tions and will agree to abide by their deci-
 sion, I believe I will be justified in thinking
 that you played a great role in preventing
 the possible destruction of all of mankind.
 No man can possibly do more.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:                       Thank  you  for
 bringing ' before the people the fact that
 President Johnson has no right to make
 war without a declaration by Congress.
 He is dragging us into a ridiculous swamp
 like Korea and possibly over the brink into
 a holocaust.
 Since he talks about honoring promises,
 he has a promise to honor that he made
 to, the American people.  He was elected
 on the basis that he was,against war.  Yet
 his foreign policy is so weak that the only
 way he knows how to implement it is by
 waging war.
 I ,certainly hope that more Members of
 Congress speak up.  I am, of course, writ-

 the "right to work" law now on the books.
 States should retain their present power to
 legislate  on  the  subject,  and  individuals
 should retain their present rights to employ-
 ment without union membership.                                Surely
 there are economic as well as civil liber-

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:  With  today's  an-
 nouncement that the Viet war is being ex-
 panded there is more than ever the need for
 your loyal opposition. Others in high office
 have feared to speak out against the admin-
 istration's terrible mistake, and now there
 will be fewer.  Even the people around here
 appear dazed as to what is happening; there
 is certainly no flag waving among the general
 public because what they thought was noth-
 ing has suddenly become a real threat, and
 they  are   mumbling to themselves  asking
 "What has happened?"
 We Americans have been blessed with too
 few leaders of experience, wisdom, and liberal
 vision.  Liberalism, the patient and reason-
 able defense of our way of life, is the only
 existent and truly effective  alternative to
 marxism.  The present administration has
 lowered themselves to a crass and unwise
 method of dealing with the "marxism" that
 is being displayed in the "underdeveloped
 countries."  America needs your voice, your
 leadership, and your far-sighted wisdom.
 There is a large body of sentiment against
 the war; It is not being expressed in public;
 the fear is too great.  But you do have a
 silent support-but maybe even more im-
 portant you have the support of history.

 DEAR SENATOR: In an article appearing in
 the Ann Arbor News, you are named as the
 one and only Senator who has the fortitude
 to oppose L. B. Johnson's steamroller, as'far
 as Vietnam is concerned.
 Well, I am thankful that there is some
 one in Washington to speak for a host of
 citizens who voted for L.B.J. because they
 were led to believe that he was a "sane, peace-
 loving man" and who are now thoroughly
 disillusioned.
 It is a tragedy that the other Senators
 are such a cowardly lot, intimidated by right-
 wing fanatics who would brand them as
 Communists.
 Perhaps if you persist you can bring the
 power mad war lords in the White House and
 the Pentagon Building and the Senate to
 their senses before the world is engulfed in
 a fearful holocaust.
 Respectfully,
 LAURA GETZ,

 DEAR SIR: I listened to President Johnson
 during his press conference on Vietnam, and
 I recalled that when he was running for elec-
 tion                                                                                                                                        in  November  1964,  he  called  Barry
 Goldwater trigger happy, which now can well
 apply to Johnson. What one cannot forget
 is the promise that if elected he would not
 escalate the  war  in  Vietnam. Evidently,
 those were false promises in order to get the
 people to vote him into office.   He would
 never have received the overwhelming vote
 that he got from both Democrats as well as
 Republicans if the American people had an
 inkling that he would bring them to this
 pass-where  our  young  men    would  once
 again find themselves giving up their free-
 dom and their lives in this atomic age, which
 bodes ill for all humanity.  The atom bomb
 was supposed to have been a deterrent to
 war-now look what is happening.
 President Johnson is a good politician, but
 not a wise statesman, representing a power-
 ful Nation.  It is easy to become involved in
 war, but it takes wisdom to know how to
 avoid one. Johnson has surrounded him-
 self with the wrong advisers-the military
 mind-the CIA-
 ,McNamara-Bundy, et al.
 This    an undeclared war because Presi-
 dent Johnson fears that the Congress would
 not  support  him  in  this drastic step  of
 escalation which may bring on a Third World
 War that spells madness.   While there is
 still time, the American people should openly
 express themselves against this threatened
 holocaust which should be avoided at all
 costs.
 It is either going to be coexistence or no
 existence.
 Very truly yours,
 Mrs. EVA WILLIAMS.

 MY DEAR SENATOR: Since in my own dis-
 trict we get so little cooperation from our
 Representatives in the Congress we have to
 appeal to others on a nationwide basis.
 The enclosed is a letter I am sending to the
 Members of Congress far and wide and to let
 the few great leaders among you know the
 citizens are aroused.
 The situation looks very dark at the mo-
 ment, but I try to believe that the darkest
 hour maybe before the dawn.
 Thank you for your wise leadership.

 MY DEAR SENATOR: In the June 21 issue of
 the Nation (which this year is celebrating
 its  100th anniversary)  I would call  your
 attention to an editorial under the head of
 "Where's Congress?"   It points to the fact
 that Congress has not been relieved of the
 responsibility for the consequences of Presi-
 dential  action  in  committing  the United
 States to hostilities against other states.  In
 failing to actively assume this responsibility,
 the Congress has, by its inaction and abdica-
 tion, nullified the Constitution. With about

 two dozen exceptions, this is literally true.
 thus the war in Asia rises  to increasing
 heights of mutual peril, not to mention what
 is happening in the other Americas.
 There is no logic known to man that can
 justify the ruthlessness of our foreign policy
 in waging war.  It Is tragically reminiscent
 of the Hitler period and I am wondering if,
 when this situation has reached the point
 of no return, the American people will claim,
 as the Germans did, "We were unaware."
 There is no way we can escape responsibility
 for the death and destruction being perpe-
 trated either on a neighboring state or on a
 people half a world away.
 We look to those we have elected to re-
 sponsible places in Government to take lead-
 ership in seeking solutions which will bring
 peace to a war-torn world.  The people are
 still awaiting that leadership.  As a loyal
 American citizen, one who has lived through
 many wars and knows the futility of them,
 I beg of you to stop this mad drive toward
 world destruction.  The more concerned a
 citizen becomes the more suspect. he is.
 This insane fear of communism will surely
 be our ultimate destruction if we do not
 return to reason.

 DEAR SIR: The purpose of this missive is
 twofold, to thank you and to encourage you.
 First, I wrote you last fall asking for cer-
 tain information and copies of speeches that
 you have made in the past.  Your response
 was immediate, exciting, and more than I
 dared hope for.  But, alas, I wait until now
 to thank you,
 Moreover I wish to thank you for your
 consistent positions on such matters as for-
 eign aid, education, and International law.
 Second, I encourage you to continue your
 work with the same zeal that you have here-
 tofore shown.
 I would remind you of a statement of
 President Wilson, one that you doubtless al-
 ready keep in mind.  I refer to his statement
 in reference to "Fighting Bob," prior to our
 entrance Into the First World Wax, wherein
 he stated that Mr. La Follette represented no
 opinion but his own.
 :1 hereby go on record as stating that your
 expressions represent my opinion and my
 position.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I feel that your com-
 ments on the Vietnam situation are most
 perceptive, and, from the historical point of
 view, will eventually be proven to be highly
 profound.   You must, therefore, exert all
 possible efforts to prevent the loss of any
 more American lives defending remote jungle
 outposts populated by ignorant barbarians.
 I can see no justification for the defense of
 any territory whose people generally do not
 understand  the  implications of life in a
 Marxist society and would tolerate elected of-'
 ficelals with pro-Communist views.  For these
 reasons  I  feel that  the  American  forces
 should be immediately pulled out of Viet-
 nam, and that the U.S. Government should
 concede all territory to the Communists up
 to, and including, the State of Oregon, with
 the defense perimeter established at the Ore-
 gon State line.

 the powers of the President not being dicta-

 We certainly need many more men such
 as you in Congress these days.  I do hope
 you will not drop the fight, but keep on
 until we return to the constitutional form
 of government.

 our local Seattle press about you, plus your
 statements over the radio-are all very wel-

 sanity in the country when values seem up-
 side down.  Please keep up this fine courage-
 ous stand. If your office has copies of any
 of your policy speeches, I'd like a few copies.
 Thank you.
 SEATTLE, WASH.,
 July 28, 1965.
 President LYNDON B. JOHwsole,
 The White House, Washington, D.C.:
 It will always be our actions that speak to
 the peoples of the world, no matter how we
 rationalize in words-and the continuation
 of the acceleration of the war in Vietnam is
 an act of stubborn perversity, not wisdom.
 Eventually we shall provoke a conflagration
 we cannot stop, let alone cope with.
 New complex social, political and economic
 problems exist in the world which cannot
 be solved by the old show-of-force technique.
 Greater numbers of our fighting men in Viet-
 nam will only force Russia closer to Red
 China, and Red China will be forced by our
 aggressive "invitations" into war.  No matter
 what one's color or politics * * * when one
 Is hit again and again, one will eventually
 strike back.
 When will the leaders of our country and
 shapers of our foreign policy learn that by
 swallowing just some of our pride and ac-
 tively backing down to peaceful negotiations
 (which may seem to our military minded, a
 "loss of face"), we, in the long run, will
 raise our stature in the eyes of the world.
 What Is the price of our brand of democ-
 racy In southeast Asia?  Slaughter of In-
 nocents as well as the Vietcong? Total war?
 Step by step you are leading us toward the
 latter.  I for one have been ashamed of be-
 ing an American since we stepped up our ag-
 gression.  This Is not what I voted for, nor
 condone. And having spent nearly half of
 last year traveling in Europe, I know what
 the peoples of those countries thought of
 Goldwater's policies.   They were appalled.
 When will we ever learn?
 To sum up: Whatever the causes for the
 war in Vietnam, the reasons (which remain
 very cloudy) for any continuation, any step-
 up, have too high a price in human lives and
 In American dollars.  The money that is be-
 ing spent to keep us in Asia could far better
 be spent in cleaning up our own many prob-
 lems at home.  It is ironic to compare the
 sums .being spent for the Peace Corps, pov-
 erty program and beautification of America
 with the total daily costof this undeclared
 war.  We are rapidly undoing whatever good
 we have done with our Peace Corps program.
 And as for the cost in human lives (what
 Is the "price" of a human life?) * * * any
 realistic and reasonable thought should lead
 one to conclude that wecannot win any war
 with numbers of fighting men in Asia.  Can't
 we learn from France's bitter experience?
 Shall we learn only when Our own home-
 land is finally bombed?  Perhaps we shall

 DEAR SENATOR  MORSE:  I agree with your

 I wish that every member of Government
 would read the article by historian Arnold
 Toynbee entitled "We Must Woo Red China"

 President Johnson stated publicly that as

 was elected to office largely on the strength of
 this promise, which he has subsequently vio-

 paddies of a nation involved in civil war,
 there are also those of more mature reflection
 who believe that American integrity and
 safety are being compromised.
 The fry is arising for preventative, war
 against China. We have had "war hawks" in
 the past.  History pronounces their epitaph
 as the wailing of idiots.  Enough American
 blood has been spilled in this century, not to
 speak of the wanton slaughter of Europe's
 and Asia's millions, with no resolution of the
 problems. Will we not learn that war creates
 more problems than it solves?
 Our people need proper medical care, our
 children need good teachers, our cities need
 hospitals, our rivers and streams are sorely
 polluted.  Yet we callously spend the major-
 ity of our national budget for military pur-
 poses.  Surely, Americans, indeed all people,
 deserve better.  For when we involve our-
 selves in war we are involving all others.
 The responsibility for wise leadership and
 wise behavior rests with the preponderance
 of power. The gargantuan stands guilty as
 accused of misusing its power.
 Men, particularly leaders of men, appear to
 be  more  warlike  than  peaceable.   Con-
 sequently the burden of proof and debate
 rests with the advocates of peace who con-
 stitute the minority.  But, for the sake of
 mankind, the mission of peace is vastly im-
 portant and must be diligently pursued.
 To you, Sir, America owes a debt of grati-
 tude, for you serve America well.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I share your concern
 over the deepening and dangerous involve-
 ment in Vietnam.  I believe that if the Presi-
 dent is arrogating to himself the power to
 conduct war without a specific resolution
 from Congress to that effect by the constitu-
 tional mandate, them impeachment proceed-
 ings are in order. It is, I think, Imperialism
 of a most blatant kind,
 As Norman Mailer said at a recent Harvard
 discussion, . "He shares the insanity that is
 in all of us."  The spending on arms, the
 moon race, and such simple things as build-
 ing highways and killing more people by
 the automobile.
 As Professor Seymour Melman says in his
 recent book, "Our Depleted Society," we are
 tied too much to the military, our defense
 spending and research is throwing the rest of
 development out of kilter.
 So, I thank you for adding your very
 powerful and influential voice in what must
 seem like a quite lonely wilderness, and the
 few other Senators and Congressmen as well
 who have risked Presidential displeasure as
 opposing such wilful and arrogant actions,
 Sincerely,
 GLEN FISHER.

 dent has taken in the Vietnam adventure.
 I admire your intellectual honesty in pursu-
 ing a course advocating the widest possible
 discussion and scrutiny by both branches
 of the legislature in conformity with our
 Constitution.  It seems, indeed, as if too
 many of our legislators prefer political ex-
 pediency to discharging their duty.

 after all they are my representatives and they

 DEAR  SENATOR                                       MORSE: First, congratula-
 tions  for  your necessary response to  the
 President's address this afternoon.   As far
 as I'm concerned, we are in the words of
 Governor Hatfield "being run and told what
 to do by a few experts."  As for me, I agree
 with people like yourself, Senator GRUENING,
 Walter Lippmann, and Drew Pearson.
 I want you to know that you have many
 supporters all over the country and as for
 myself (me?) you're my favorite Senator-
 perhaps because-quite bluntly-you don't
 give a damn about your colleagues and you've
 the guts not to go along and be a yes-man-
 because Johnson says to.  I have been solidly
 behind you ever since I can remember (I'm
 only  16)  possibly  because  in  my  eyes-
 you're the epitome of a person who believes
 wholeheartedly in the welfare of not only
 his country-but the world.
 You don't propose to be a messiah to the
 Negro-as   Senator   ROBERT   KENNEDY-yet
 you show your true colors by voting against
 that segregationist Coleman-whereas "Mr.
 Everything" voted for him.
 I disagree with our policy on South Viet-
 nam.  1. We have no right to be there and If
 it were any country In there but us-all
 - would break loose.  2. L.B.J. constantly
 refers to the "aggressors" but are we the
 epitome of peace when we bomb North Viet-
 nam?  We are always the good guys.
 It is a civil war in South Vietnam and it's
 none of our business and they're not even
 .fighting for the people of that land-they
 fight blindly against the Vietcong-they (the
 Marines) bear a resemblance to the Birchites
 as they seek out and kill the "Reds"
 I could go on and on and on but I don't
 want to consume your time-I just want you
 to please, please, please do all you can to
 convince Senators to vote nay concerning
 the money L.B.J. will ask for to finance the
 war and please-don't ever give in  and
 never feel as though you have no support-
 you have a lot.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:             I am writing this
 letter to you because yours has consistently
 been a voice of reason in the Vietnam crisis.
 After hearing the President's news con-
 ference yesterday, I find myself dismayed
 in t:.e extreme at the continued pursuit of
 what I feel to be a disastrous course.
 This is  a  military operation which,  in
 my opinion, we cannot win; if by that we
 mean causing the enemy to sue for peace
 or. our terms. Both sides concede that this
 could go on for 5  years  or more.  Aside
 from "side issues" of what happens to Viet-
 r. un and its people in this period, as we
 use up more of our own young men and
 materiel in this bottomless pit, the pressures
 for the use of nuclear armaments will in-
 crease, with catastrophic results we can only
 van el-- imagine.
 I am writing to ask you, how an individ-
 ual can register a protest so as to at least
 cause the judgernaut to pause a moment
 before It crushes everyone in Its headlong
 dash?  To whom can one write or speak in
 order to arouse some meaningful opposition
 to this course?
 I really would appreciate an answer from
 you.

 country's foreign policy.                          Why does Presi-

 he really think we can bomb and burn peo-

 reasons of resisting aggression from North
 Vietnam and keeping South Vietnam free
 do not seem consistent with the facts of the
 Vietnam situation.  Why doesn't our coun-
 try encourage popularly supported resistance
 to oppressive authoritarian regimes such as
 in  South  Vietnam, Portugal,  etc.?   Why
 should we support an oppressive anti-Com-
 munist dictatorship any more than an op-
 pressive Communist one?  I can think of no
 justifiable reason, can you?  I can think of no
 other reason than to preserve the foreign

 Americans and American corporations.  I
 certainly hope there are other reasons, but
 what are they?
 Can you suggest any organizations that I
 could work with in an effort to deflect Pres-
 ident Johnson from his present course to-
 ward, I fear, a nuclear thirdWorld war?
 Is there any way to replace President
 Johnson with someone as intelligent and
 sensitive as you as the Democratic Party
 presidential nominee in 1988, if we live
 that long?  His actions concerning Vietnam,
 Latin America and U.N. finances have been
 to. distasteful that I can never vote for him
 again.
 I would appreciate any documentation of
 the inconsistencies of American Vietnam
 policies  with facts that you have readily
 available, and want you to know that I sup-
 port your efforts to bring reason, truth, and
 justice into play as the guiding principle of
 our country's actions in affairs with other
 countries.                                  -

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: As a private citizen,
 I feel sick at heart over the role of our coun-
 try in Vietnam. In your recent remarks, you
 have expressed my sentiments and convic-
 tions very strongly.
 I wish to commend you for your courage
 in speaking out.  People like myself feel so
 impotent to alter the course of events.  Per-
 haps men like yourself, in positions of re-
 sponsibility, will be more successful.
 I know you will continue to speak out as
 you have so often done - In the past.    May
 my expressions of approval give you some
 support.
 Yours very truly,
 Mrs. InaNE A. Wncox.

 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON:                      I am appalled
 at the military action being taken in my
 name and in the name of all Americans in
 Vietnam.  I consider it to be foolhardy and
 immoral.  Moreover, I am certain that it will
 achieve the opposite of its professed alms.
 I feel betrayed as one who supported your
 candidacy for the presidency.
 I have previously expressed my belief In
 this matter to you and to my Congressmen
 by letter.  I have expressed my belief publicly
 on several occasions at debates and protest
 meetings in the Bay Area, including a talk
 before an audience In excess- of 10,000 at the
 Vietnam Day "teach-in" held on the campus
 of the University of California at Berkeley
 in May. I have signed public statements op-
 posing the war in Vietnam Including the
 one sponsored by the "Scientists and Engi-
 neers for Johnson" decrying your failure to
 adhere to the policies implied and promised
 in your campaign.
 I am endorsing and working for the Viet-
 nam Day Committee of Berkeley in prepara-
 tion for massive protests this fall.  I endorse
 the Assembly of Unrepresented People To
 Declare Peace and the other, associated ac-
 tivities scheduled for Washington, D.C., Au-
 gust 6-9.
 These are scattered, perhaps desperate, per-
 haps  ineffective measures.   They are the
 product of people who are seriously alarmed
 at the course of events.  But these alarmed
 people are also informed people, thoughtful
 people and responsible people.  The activi-
 ties listed above are but a few of the many
 such being carried out by a significant pro-
 portion of the most Informed and politically
 responsible segment of the American pub-
 lic-many of them in colleges and universi-
 ties, many of them in the clergy, many of
 them in public service.  Not a few of them
 (like myself) make the study of human be-
 havior their life work; some of them (like
 myself) make the study of Asian society their
 specialty.   They act urgently, perhaps des-
 perately,                                                                               but  not foolishly  or  carelessly.
 They act from knowledge and conviction.
 For an Indication of the variety of activi-
 ties in this realm. I would refer you to the
 recently Initiated "Biweekly Information/Ac-
 tion Report of the Universities Committee"
 (Post Office Box 7228, Detroit, Mich.).
 To those in positions of political power,
 such activities may appear useless, hopeless
 or even ridiculous.  But they are not to be
 ridiculed. We find ourselves becoming impli-
 cated in military and political adventures
 which we fird utterly reprehensible and in-
 defensible.  We cry out for sanity before it
 is too late for sanity.  We do what we do be-
 cause other means have been ignored.
 We will continue to attempt to convey our
 interpretations, our facts and our convic-
 tions In ways which will be heard.  Our
 responsibilities as citizens and as men com-
 pel us to do so.  Many will resort to non-
 violent resistance, refusal to serve in the
 Armed Forces, refusal to pay Income taxes,
 civil  disobedience, to  disrupt munitions
 shipments to Vietnam, etc. I have not found
 these means to be the appropriate ones. But
 if no others are effective, then surely these
 must be tried.  Whether or not they will be
 effective, they at least disassociate their pat-
 t'cipants  from                                                                            the  policies  they  protest.
 They draw attention to the fact of the pro-
 test and the sincerity of those protesting.
 They are an anguished cry, but a cry which
 will be heard.  It is a sad day if this is the
 only cry which will be heard.
 At present I have taken steps to do two
 things to register my personal protest:
 1. 1 have undertaken to resign my com-
 mission in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (in
 which I served actively, 1953-55).
 2. I have refused to participate further in
 training programs for the Peace Corps or
 other governmental programs sending per-
 sonnel to Asia.  These programs are sheer
 hypocrisy In the present context.  You can-
 not buy friends in India while you are killing
 potential friends in Vietnam, and I consider
 it immoral to attempt to do so.
 These are two activities or affiliations which
 I-repudiate In light of the immoral war with
 which they are associated.
 I will henceforth do everything within my
 power and conscience to oppose that war.
 I am totally unconvinced by the.doubletalk,
 doublethink, euphemism and hypocrisy with
 which that war is rationalized by Mr. Bundy
 and your other advisors, and by the Depart-
 ments of State and Defense.
 I wish with all my heart that before this
 country wades deper into the morass which
 is that war, you would listen thoughtfully
 to  its  critics.   Historians  of  the future,
 should there be some, will know that current
 U.S. policy is sheerest folly,  If It-to aban-
 doned it will be no more than an unpleasant
 historical footnote.  If it is not abandoned,
 it may well be the end of the book.
 The present course is hopeless.  There are
 alternatives as you well know.  Please pur-
 sue them.
 Sincerely yours,
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senator,
 Washington, D.C.

 SIR: Yours seems to me to be the most
 vigorous and consistent voice for peace now
 heard in our land.           ,
 I can't help - remembering the virtually
 unanimous clamor after the Second World
 War condemning the German people for
 standing by while Hitler led them down the
 path to ruin.  I mention this, not because
 I think the situation is in any sense analo-
 gous to ours today, but rather to emphasize.
 that perhaps there Is or ought to be some
 action ordinary people might take now be
 fore our country takes the  final step in
 Vietnam.
 I'm doing the usual things.   But Is there
 some political action one might undertak,s
 which could reverse the present trend?  I'd
 like to help if I could.  If this were a presi-
 dential election year, a lot of people would
 like to see you and Senators GRtTENING and
 Creuxci join together.   But what can be
 done now?

 the two Russian-installed antiaircraft mis-
 sile  bases  in  North  Vietnam.  I  should
 like to convey to you my wholehearted sup-
 port and approval of the position you have
 taken in connection with this particular :In-
 cident, and, mire generally, of your oppcst-
 tion to the administration's entire policy in
 southeast Asia.
 I, too, find it impossible to understand the
 President's policy In Vietnam,  I believe it to
 be Immoral, illegal, and dangerous.  More-
 over, even if one accepts the highly dubious

 presence in southeast Asia Is desirable. It

 I am keeping a file (for my own study and
 for display to my friends) of material relat-
 ing to U.S. involvement in southeast Asia,
 which includes press clippings and publica-
 tions of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee.  I would be very grateful for any
 material which illustrates your own views
 that you would care to send me; especially
 welcome would be copies of your Senate
 speeches and public addresses on the subjinct.
 Finally, I urge you to continue your very
 constructive opposition to the administra-
 tion's policy in Vietnam, even though it
 seems to be falling on deaf ears at the White
 House.  It is of no little comfort to those
 like myself who welcome evidences of sanity
 in the National Government to know that
 there are still a few reasonable men where
 they are'so very necessary.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Is it true that our
 young sons just out of high school are being
 sent to Vietnam after a few months' train-
 ing?                                                                                              I have heard this story so often and
 have read newspaper accounts of the 18- and
 19- year-olds fighting and dying in Asia. Why
 are we fighting the Asiatic Communists who
 are supported by Red China when many of
 our former allies are trading with Red China,
 thereby strengthening her against us?
 Now we are going to double the draft call
 and perhaps call up the reserves, although
 we have hundreds of thousands of enlisted
 military holding down civilian jobs on our
 military posts. Why not send these men into
 the war since that is the purpose of the
 Armed Forces?  The draftees and reserves
 could replace these men both here and in
 peaceful areas overseas, meanwhile getting
 P.S.-I have just finished viewing the , additional training so that they could be
 President's press conference, and unfortu-      used as replacements in the theater of war
 nately, my former fears are now increased.
 I still believe the matter should be submit-
 ted to a formal debate in the United Nations
 as a first step toward extricating ourselves
 from  a  wholly  unwise  entanglement  in
 southeast Asia.
 MORRISON'S LODGE,
 Merlin, Oreg., July 25, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am writing to ex-
 press my feeling on the proposed gun bill
 S. 1592.
 From all the press releases and information
 I have read on this bill it appears to me:
 1. The proposed Dodd bill is not strictly
 aimed at law enforcement as Senator DODD
 implies, but it is aimed at controlling and
 hindering gun transactions to all citizens,
 law abiding and otherwise.  This raises the,
 question, Is it your function to restrict firearms to all?
 2. Senator ROBERT KENNEDY (which I think
 highly of)  states, "Let's legislate  nonvio-
 lence."  As I recall the last attempt to legis-
 late morality, prohibition, failed miserably.
 This is an absolute impossibility.
 3. The license fees in section 3Za) will
 prove a hindrance to both sportsmen and
 the small businessman. I have a small busi-
 ness and would not be able to continue to
 sell ammunition It these fees were enacted.
 This is an example, of which I am sure there
 are many.
 4. Interstate shipments, by the individual
 for hunting or any other purpose of which
 there are thousands, will seriously hamper
 the sport hunting industry in many of our
 States. What do we gain by this sacrifice? I
 doubt seriously if the criminal will be dis-
 suaded from his endeavors because of this
 law.
 5. Is this suppression of guns a Federal
 problem?  Certainly there is a big difference
 in States like New York and Montana.
 I could go into quite a lengthy discussion
 on this bill and its different sections, how-
 ever I will be brief, as I believe I have con-
 veyed the main, thought.
 I would very much like to know what your
 stand is on this bill and if you intend to
 vote for o. a~gains its passage.  Please con-
 Bider the intent oR this bill and how the
 proosed bill does not accomplish it.

 pre sion of fireams in crime, would be H.R.

 his lifetime career he does so with the full
 knowledge that he can be sent anytime, any-
 where into whatever war the United States
 becomes involved.  Why are we keeping these
 professional fighters back home or stationed
 in peaceful areas of the world and sending
 teenagers with a few months' training into
 hand-to-hand combat with a tough foe with
 years of training and combat experience? No
 wonder we are losing in Vietnam.  Or is this
 war merely an elimination of excess World
 War II babies for whom there is not enough
 employment or college facilities at this time
 or in the future?                                    Please, please do some-
 thing to insure adequate training for our
 teenagers.

 sincere  appreciation and   respect for your
 position on this issue and your courage to
 speak out against the current horrible trend.
 Your comment of today on the United
 States abandonment of the U.N., our last
 hope, seemed especially cogent and effective.
 I am against this war, as you are.  What
 steps do you think I can take in order to help
 try to avert the final catastrophe?  We can't
 just sit back and frown quietly as we sink

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE:  As a conservative
 Republican I am seldom able to agree with
 your policies.  At this time however, I find
 that you are the only member of the Govern-
 ment who I can 'agree with.  I commend
 your stand on the Vietnam crisis and urge
 you to continue to speak out against the
 dreadful course which is being followed.
 I have listened to and read the speeches
 made by Members of the Congress and ad-
 ministration as well as the many editorials
 printed in support of Johnson's policy in the
 press.  I have also heard loudly condemned
 the "leftist beatnick" groups which oppose
 Johnson.  What has amazed me is the lack
 of publicity or attention given to the respon-
 sible middle-of-the-road and conservative
 elements who oppose our present course of
 action in Vietnam.
 My friends and associates are primarily
 conservative thinking Republican and Dem-
 ocratic   businessmen  of  unimpeachable
 patriotism. Naturally the Vietnam crisis is
 discussed more and more each day-what
 would come as a great shock to President
 Johnson is the opinion that most of these
 persons have-they are dead set against what
 is being done.
 I am not a Communist" or a pacifist, but a
 person who sincerely believes in the Ameri-
 can way.  I fail to see, whatever arguments
 are used, how as an honest, peaceful Nation
 we can continue the terrible things we are
 doing in Vietnam.
 You are by no means alone in your convic-
 tions.                                                                                                                 I am indeed grateful to you for tak-

 more and more embroiled in Vietnam.  Our
 moral stance is a pure shame.  We have in

 the beginning to abandon all reason also.

 your opposition.

 It "seems the American people are being
 forced into a war that they don't need or
 want when a nation for an individual can-
 not decide on a a right course it ultimately
 leads to disaster.  The world is changing
 and people are made restless by these lead-
 ers who don't seem to lead but drift.  We
 all know that after the killings and torture,
 the leaders  will sit down once more and
 divide the world again.  When nations rebel
 and refuse to be friendly with the power's
 who want to help them than something is
 wrong.  It seems to me that the State De-

 partment and the Pentagon seem to run
 this country.  Why don't wehear from the
 Members of Congress who were elected by
 the people to run their affairs, instead of
 supposed experts.
 My wife is now in a mental hospital from
 praying until she no longer could control
 herself.  These are sad days for people of
 liberal feelings.
 O' how long do we have to be deceived.
 All free men should stand up and shout.
 No more wars we are tired of killings.
 Incidently, I would have voted for. you
 as president if you were a candidate.
 I too am a maverick.
 Respectfully,
 SPRINGFIELD, N.J.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: You are indeed a gal-
 lant man.  I admire your courage.  Your
 stands against war are most admirable.
 I, too, believe a victory in Vietnam would
 gain little.  It would temporarily stymie
 future efforts by the Communists to take over
 these small second-rate countries.
 Shouldn't our primary aim be to confront
 and contain the giant Communist nations?
 Why then did we not attempt to stop the
 takeover  of  China  by  the  Communists,
 standing idly by assisting Chang to retreat to
 Formosa?
 We tolerate the Russian rape of Poland,
 Hungary, and countless others, many being
 the same countries ravaged by Hitler, which
 drew the wrath of the free world and led to
 his eventual defeat.  Why did we not then
 stand up and confront the Russians for these
 horrible incidents?
 Our efforts in the little brush fire wars as
 Vietnam prove little. With our huge su-
 periority of modern weapons in the air and
 sea,  and  practically unopposed  in  these
 mediums, makes us look the bully.
 Being a pacifist I realize the futility  of
 atomic war  and believe   everyone's efforts
 should be directed toward disarmament and
 the establishment of a strong United Na-
 tions to prevent abhorring systems as com-
 munism from accomplishing its aims to sub-
 jugate other coverted nations.
 Do you think the masses of people will ever
 wake up and refuse to be the tools of the
 power hungry leaders and their henchmen?
 Respectfully yours,                      1

 any way we can stop this before we have a

 I hope that many of your colleagues now
 regret that they did not openly oppose the
 war buildup as you and Senator GRUENING
 have. Are these men now scared into action?
 Is there any checkpoint you. can see?
 We feel there is nothing we can do.  We
 have spoken of a petition and could easily
 collect signatures of people who oppose our
 Vietnam policy, if we thought this would do
 any good.  We hope you make a Senate
 speech soon and indicate what is a realistic
 approach.  I would like to be on your mail-
 ing list.
 I feel very thankful that you and Senator
 GRUENING have been so outspoken, that there
 are at least two Senators who are willing to
 bear witness against the crime we are com-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to express my
 deep admiration of your courageous, per-
 sistent, and eloquent opposition to the ad-
 ministration's policy  of waging  an  unde-
 clared war against the people of a small,
 impoverished, and war-battered country.
 There is no longer any doubt that the ma-
 jority of the people of South Vietnam are
 opposed to the Saigon government. They
 are not Communists but are siding with the
 Vietcong.  At the very least, they have no
 wish to fight the Vietcong.  Their greatest
 wish is for the war to stop.
 Thus the United States, the richest coun-
 try in the world, is waging war-with the
 planes and bombs and increasing numbers of
 American soldiers-against the people  of
 South and North Vietnam.
 Although our intentions were honorable,
 we are now embarked on a course which is
 morally wrong and endangers the peace of
 the world.  The world must be shocked.
 We must stop.  A peacekeeping mission
 must be brought in by some world agency,
 preferably the United Nations.

 SIR: Having just concluded a letter to the
 Vice President of  the  United  States,  re-
 minding hint of his past record up to the
 Vietnamese mess.  I feel that I must com-
 mend you for your forthrightly courage In
 taking the stand so much in opposition to
 that of our devious administration.
 I have a     normal  circle  of  friends  and
 friendly acquaintances.  They include Demo-
 crats, Republicans, Liberals,  Conservatives,
 one or two leftists, and a few rightists. With
 the exception of the few rightists, I find
 among these friends and acquaintances, no
 approval of our Vietnamese adventure-in
 fact, for the most part there is downright
 disapproval.                     -
 The President is waging a war without
 the approval of Congress, as unconstitutional
 a procedure as any that has ever been at-
 tempted.  Must we risk the destruction of
 humanity just to cover the errors and to
 save face for a stubborn, misled, egocentric
 man?
 By continuing to speak out, as you have
 so far, you wifl earn the gratitude, not only
 of all Americans, but all of humanity.
 Most respectfully yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: God bless you for
 your stand against this foolishness in Viet-
 nam.  It's not even foolishness, it is mad-
 ness.                                                                      I never thought I would be ashamed
 to be an American, but I am today.  And to
 think that  I,  a  conservative  Republican,
 voted for Johnson to preserve peace because
 of Goldwater's "fire and brimstone policy,"
 is more than a bit of gall to drink.
 Alas, alas.

 this family who are against this "mercenary
 army for hire" business we seem to be as-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  The Morse code of
 decency and sanity doesn't fall upon a com-
 plete sea of deaf mutes-lost as most Amer-
 icans seem to be in their refrigerators.
 Yours is a clean, strong voice in a wilder-
 ness of fat and cynical toads.  I wish, on
 odd blue Mondays, I myself were cynical
 toad enough to wish for the shallowy illit-
 erate U.S. public-with its consensus sup-
 port of the megomaniacal   L.B.J.  and his
 neo-Forestal,  McNamara-the  nuclear  way
 it deserves.
 Please keep talking-loud and clean and
 strong.  A few  of  us are with you-plus
 hundreds of millions in Europe and Asia and
 (if you will excuse the expression) the Soviet
 Union.

 DEAR   SENATOR   MORSE: Thank  you  for
 speaking out so clearly this morning on the
 Vietnam crisis.   I feel sorry for President
 Johnson for I know the pressures must be
 enormous, pulling him in different directions.
 So it is especially good to have a Senator of
 your stature reminding us all of the dangers
 the world faces if we continue in our present
 direction  and the alternatives possible.  I
 agree, with you completely, and hope that the
 dismal affair will soon be turned over to
 the United Nations.  If only we would do
 things because they are right, not expedient.
 Sincerely,
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SENATOR  MORSE:  I  am  grateful  to
 have at least one person in Washington who
 represents my point of view.                        I admire your
 courage in speaking for peace when every-
 one in Washington speaks for war.  I hope
 you will continue to fight until the peace is
 won.
 I would appreciate it if you would include
 me on your mailing list.
 I hope my letter reaches you and not a

 you well.

 the Hapsburgs, and the Bourbons as they

 I cannot for the life of me see why Congress
 (the voice of the people) does not put a halt
 to L.B.J. and his group that is heading us
 toward total doom. , The Bible tells us that
 he who taketh the sword shall perish by the
 sword and it looks like the United States is
 going to test this saying.  These are our sons
 that are doing the fighting and dying. John-
 son and his group will be safe in their bomb
 shelters.  Please do something to stop him.
 I'm writing as a mother who loves her sons.
 I'll sacrifice them to defend their homeland
 but please not in some forsaken jungle.  Let
 the people decide by vote whether they want
 war.  They are the ones who will suffer.

 DEAR SENATOR: I have often appreciated
 your courageous devotion to truth, but never
 more than in your sharp reminders that the
 Pentagon program means accelerating the
 crisis in Vietnam, perhaps to the point of
 war.
 This would be a war nobody wants and
 strategically foolish.

 harvest of devastation and war, if we keep
 sowing seeds of acceleration.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SENATOR MORSE: That there  is one
 man in Washington who protests this hor-
 rible war in Vietnam lends one last ray of
 hope to our rapidly dying faith and confi-
 dence.                      After bloody Korea, how can anyone
 want to repeat it?  There were over 160,000
 American casualties there  (Boston Herald)
 and it ended right where it,started.
 At the polls in November 1964, the people
 spoke loud and clear.  Party, did not count.
 There was only one issue.  They voted for
 peace.  They voted against a war in Vietnam.
 Do you believe that there is one parent, black,
 white, or yellow, who believes that Vietnam
 is worth his or her son's life?  Washington
 turned a deaf ear to our, pleas. The people
 apparently do not count any more.
 The late Adlai Stevenson so aptly said:
 "The farmer wants higher prices; but he
 wants peace more.  The businessman wants
 stability and the laborer wants security, of
 course; but they want peace more."  The
 people want all of this but they want their
 sons most.  And now, after nearly a quarter
 of a century, we see our sons still being
 yanked from home and college at the whim
 of Selective Service and sent to senseless
 slaughter in rice paddies of a people who does
 not want to fight.  They are not free. They
 have no choice.  At least the men in World
 War II believed in what they were fighting
 for but these helpless pawns do not have even
 that to sustain them.
 Where are the Reserves?  They are the
 volunteers.  But of course, it is cheaper to
 send our boys.  And so our boys die, cruelly
 and needlessly, before they are 26.  And the
 seething volcano of parents"outrage and re-
 sentment grows and grows and grows.
 As I overheard one little old lady from a
 backward country say the other day (she was
 here for a visit) : "We got our sons. We got
 everything.  You don't have your sons. You
 don't have nothing." She was so right.

 DEAR Sin: The expected callup of Reserves
 is another escalation leading up to a fullscale

 end in disaster for all concerned.  Please
 continue your efforts to stop this path to
 destruction.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have followed with
 interest your critical reactions to recent ad-
 ministration decisions concerning activity in
 Vietnam. I want to say that I wholehearted-
 ly support your position.  We need, in the
 U.S. Senate, more voices like yours.
 Even though I am from another State than
 the State you represent, I feel that I owe it
 to you to let you know that yours is not a
 voice crying in the wilderness.
 I have studied Far Eastern philosophy, cul-
 ture, religion and history.  All I have learned
 leads me to the conclusion that what we are
 doing in Vietnam is dead wrong.  To use vio-
 lenoe to settle problems in a culture which
 in Its several thousand years has not known
 the  methodology  of  violence  is  a  crime
 against humanity.  I hope we eventually
 realize that a military solution will not work
 in a strong Buddhist culture.  .
 Keep up your perceptive criticism for the
 benefit of those of us who agree with the
 stand you have taken.
 Sincerely,

 there  is  no  need to  have  troops in the
 Far East.
 The people In the Far East live different,
 and  think     different, so  let them  fight
 amongst    themselves.  We,   the  people, are
 supposed to be free and can vote for laws
 that has to do with'the people here in the
 United States.
 So why not call for a special national
 election, and let the people here in the

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: As one who was born
 in your State, I feel obligated to tell you of
 my feelings on the present state of the
 Union.
 I am morally opposed to President John-
 son's further involvement in the Vietnam
 war.  I am concerned about future involve-
 ment In view of his press conference today,
 and recent bombings of Russian-built missile
 bases.
 I urge you to convince him that his present
 policy in Vietnam is not in the best public
 interests, or in the best national security
 interests of this Nation.
 I will support you in your efforts to bring
 about a change in foreign policy, and I hope
 for the sake of the United States of America
 that you will be successful.

 DEAR MR. MORSE: Through the years I have
 come to respect your stand for the cause of
 peace and rationality.  Now I write to you
 asking help.  We are a typical young Amer-
 ican family, with ordinary jobs, ordinary
 hopes and dreams and a lovely, extraordi-
 nary child whom we love, protect and hope
 for with all our hearts.  Now we live in
 terror.
 Each news bulletin of the increasing chaos
 In southeast Asia brings the sick chill of
 fear on us like a flood.  We don't talk about
 it, because it only serves to make the peril
 .more real, and we feel so helpless.
 Marvin is one of those in the Army Re-
 serve who will be called to active duty if the
 President and his advisors decide to do so;
 and It looks more likely every day.  He will
 leave for Vietnam with the knowledge that
 he may never return.  To some of our mili-
 tary leaders and perhaps to Mr. Johnson, he
 Is expendable, a mere digit to be sacrificed In
 order to demonstrate our patience and re-
 solve in suppressing the threat of commu-
 nism.
 Patience and resolve are all very noble, but
 this man is not expendable-  He is far more
 than a digit.  He is our light, our warmth,
 and joy and our strength.   It would take
 more'than patience and resolve to make our
 lives meaningful if he were gone.
 Isn't it possible to demonstrate our Na-
 tion's purposefulness with equal strength at
 the conference table?  Must this man and
 thousands like him be sacrificed on the altar
 of bravado?  Can we strengthen ourselves
 by sending men to die?  I only pray that
 you will use your influence to see that this
 does not happen, that you will urge that we
 strive to find a nobler peace than that of
 mutual  destruction,  to  show  the  greater
 strength, of reason.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 I am enclosing tear sheets from the CON-
 GRESSIONAL  RECORD,  containing the latest
 major speech I have made in the Senate on
 the shocking U.S. war in Vietnam.
 In your letter, you asked me for my views
 concerning your suggestion that steps should
 be taken to impeach President Johnson and
 perhaps some other officials.  It Is my view
 that such an impeachment attempt would be
 a very serious mistake.  All it would do would
 be to divert attention away from the basic
 issues involved in American foreign policy
 in Asia and center attention on President'
 Johnson, as an individual.  It would cause
 many people who disagree with his foreign
 policy to rally behind him, because they
 would consider such a movement to be an
 ad hominem approach.  Attacking Johnson,
 personally, will not change his course of ac-
 tion, and it will not win supporters for a
 change of foreign policy in Asia, but to the
 contrary, it will drive supporters away.
 In my opinion, there is no question about
 Johnson's sincerity or his patriotism or his
 desire for peace.  It is Johnson's bad judg-
 ment and mistaken reasoning in respect to
 the war in Asia that constitute the basis
 of the crucial problems that confront us in
 trying to get a change in Johnson's policies
 in Asia.  To attack him, personally, by pro-
 posing impeachment would be the most seri-
 ous  personal  attack  that could be made
 upon him.  It would rally the Nation be-
 hind him and result in his policies being es-
 calated into a major war at a much faster
 rate.  Those of us who  oppose Johnson's
 foreign policies must meet his views on their
 merits.   We should never attack him, per-
 sonally.
 Although you may disagree with me on
 this matter, I am giving you my honest ad-
 vice in this letter.
 I hope that the opponents of Johnsons'
 policy in Vietnam will not fall apart by
 adopting what we call splinter tactics in con-
 ducting this struggle for peace in Asia.
 With best wishes,
 Sincerely yours,
 Eventually I shall write to my own Con-
 gressmen  and  Senators  regarding  these
 things.  But I don't know them as yet; and,
 little publicity as you have been given, I
 am sure I am substantially in agreement with
 you.  I would be interested in all you have
 said concerning international matters.
 I am beginning to ask myself more and
 more what distinguishes us from the Ger-
 many of 1939?  And I quote here from your
 speech of June 8, "The Communists murder
 and kidnap and maim the villagers; we burn
 them with jelled gasoline.   That is some
 record of fighting for  freedom."   We are
 driving Asians by the millions into the arms
 of communism.  Or I might add, into some
 kind of totalitarianism.
 Sincerely,
 CLIFFORD M. TURNER.
 P.S. I am marking this letter personal be-
 cause I want to be sure you read it as soon
 as possible. And the idea of removing John-
 son and perhaps some others from office I
 should rather not at present share with your
 staff. It may be of some help to me if you
 can inform me how such a movement could
 be started.  I recommend you read the ar-
 ticle in Fact for July-August 1965.  Alice
 Herz may well have been wrong in some of
 the things she said or did.  But her suicide
 was not the act of an insane person but a
 brave, sincere, and humane one.  I share her
 feelings-have  since  August  1945-but I
 have never been as courageous or energetic.
 I  was  frightened--terribly frightened-in
 August 1945-but I could not find people
 around me who shared that fright. I am no
 great prophet and no scientist.  But I saw
 or thought I saw-the horrors that such a
 weapon as  the  then comparatively  crude
 atomic bomb could bring humanity.  It took
 no sage or seer to know that the thing could
 be "improved."  Since that . time, all my
 worst fears but one have been realized; we
 have not yet had a nuclear war.
 We must have peace or nothing.
 This subject is endless.   I will leave it
 now.
 P.P.S. I imagine there were many people
 like me-though certainly a small propor-
 tion-who were deeply agitated but were si-
 lent through sickness caused by ignorance
 and apathy-mostly by that which sur-
 rounded them rather than their own.
 SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF.,
 June 29, 1965.
 DEAR        SENATOR  MORSE:  I  copied the en-
 closed suicide note of Alice Herz from the
 July-August issue of Fact.             I tried to type
 it just as  it appears             in  an  article  "The
 Martyrdom of Alice Herz," by Hayes B. Jacobs
 beginning on page 11.
 Jacobs' article           extends  from  page     11
 through page 17.
 There was some publicity about the flam-
 ing death of Alice Herz in the San Bernar-
 dino Sun-Telegram.                               About as much as you
 got for your speech June 8 at Madison Square
 Garden.  I have a copy of that speech.
 I am not as brave as Mrs. Herz but I share
 her feeling.  My own sentiment-dangerous
 to express-is that Johnson should be im-
 peached.                        Sonie other top officials should
 go with him.  Some such drastic attempt
 is necessary if the world is to be saved for
 mankind.
 Our present actions are driving the Chinese
 Reds and the Russians back together.  Do
 our great leaders think we can win a mili-
 tary victory over their combined forces?
 America and Russia in cooperation might
 save civilization; opposed to each other they
 will destroy it.  We surely must have peo-
 ple  in each  country who realize this.
 "Civilized men everywhere have common
 ideals and these ideals have a force that
 unites.  They may prove more lasting than
 current conflicts."  (U Thant, Reader's Di-
 gest, July 1962, p. 172.)
 Civilized people in this country and the
 world over must somehow unite if the world
 as Mrs. Herz said is not to "blow itself up
 to oblivion."
 MARCH 1965.
 To the Nations of the World, to U Thant,
 Executive  Secretary  of                   the  United
 Nations:
 As a citizen of the world, In full possession
 of my physical, mental, and spiritual ca-
 pabilities, before the Creator of this world
 I accuse Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the
 United States of America, for having declared
 his decision-and already started to enact
 it; to use his amassed capacity of 400 times
 overkill  to  wipe  out,  if  necessary  whole
 countries of his choosing.
 To the American people with the help of
 the, colossal lie your Presidents Harry     S.
 Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, J. F. Ken-
 nedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson, have deceived
 and misguided you.   Through hatred and
 fear, deliberately whipped up during the last
 20 years, you have allowed your lawmakers
 in Congress to appropriate endless billions
 of dollars for an arsenal of destruction-
 unlimited.
 Awake and take action before it is too late.
 Yours is the responsibility to decide if this
 world shall be a good place to live for all
 human beings, in dignity and peace, or if it
 should blow itself up to oblivion.
 God is not mocked.  To make myself heard
 I have chosen the flaming death of the
 Buddhists on the Wayne State University
 Campus of Detroit.
 May America's youth take the lead toward
 life.

 DEAR  SENATOR  MORSE: I sincerely regret
 that I am not one of your constituents.  It
 seems impossible that you stand alone, a man
 of convictions who refuses to be swept along
 on a bandwagon.  Even men of my own
 church, whom I know to be men desirous of
 peace, of world brotherhood, etc., have been
 found wanting (BARTLETT, of Alaska, CLARK,
 bf Pennsylvania, HARRISON WILLIAMS of New
 Jersey, and even the late Adlai Stevenson)
 and have allowed their own beliefs to be
 silenced in the interests of political unity.
 Without thoughtful opposition, no matter
 the cost, democracy cannot survive.
 I hope you can raise up some little shadows,
 or  infuse  some  moral  stamina  into  our
 anemic doves, the war hawks have had far
 too much opportunity to bring chaos into
 our beautiful land.
 Though I am not from Oregon, you con-
 tinuously speak for me, and for others who
 reside far afield.  Thank God for at least a
 single voice in the wilderness.

 enough, keep their thoughts to themselves,
 and do not come out to be counted in these
 dire times of contemplated destruction.
 It was James Russell Lowell who wrote:
 "They are slaves who fear to speak
 For the fallen and the weak.
 They are slaves who will not choose
 Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,
 Rather than in silence shrink
 From the truth that needs must
 think,
 They are the slaves who dare not be
 In the right with two or three."

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: The "great manipu-
 lator" (with apologies to Abe Lincoln, the
 great emancipator) who may go down in
 history-if there is any future history-as
 the "great exterminator" has cleverly ad-
 vanced us one fatal step further toward
 doom.
 L.B.J. and his whole "Napoleonic complex"
 administration have brainwashed most of the
 American people but haven't of course fooled
 the rest of the world.
 The grim farce must be stopped.  We must
 negotiate with the Vietcong.  More troops,
 more bombings of North Vietnam will pro-
 duce nothing but further deterioration of
 the situation, aside from dragging us into a
 horrible conflict with China, and perhaps
 Russia.
 And except for a handful of people like
 you, Congress abdicates its solemn duty--
 allows the President to wage, and escalate an
 undeclared war in violation of the Consti-
 tution.
 I do not ordinarily believe in filibusters
 but I think that you and Senators GRUENING,
 CHURCH, McGovERN, etc., must do this now
 or else-goodbye world.

 have resisted the impulse.  But in view of
 the President's announcement today, I feel
 as if I must.
 Sir, in a world of insane voices, yours is
 the only sane one I have heard express itself
 on the Vietnam situation.  I only wish more
 people in high places had the insight and
 wisdom you have shown in connection with
 this terrible war.  I am a young mother of
 2'9, and I remember the Korean war which
 started when I was 14. I remember veterans
 of the. Second. World War saying that they
 would "mop it up" before the summer ended,
 but before it was over there wawa shocking
 waste of young American lives and all for
 nothing.
 This war is just a repetition of Korea.
 Nothing for  the  boys  when  they return
 home because there has been no formal dec-
 laration of war, so there will be no GI bill,
 no mustering out pay, no compensation for
 losing 3 or more years of one's life, not to
 mention; possibly losing one's life, no ade-
 quate pension for the widows, the orphans,
 the lonely mother and very little thanks in
 general for all the suffering our boys are
 going through.
 Every time I hear you speak, my heart lifts
 a little.  You are a tiny light in this sense-
 less horror and senseless waste of our best.
 If only you could make enough people listen.
 You are in a position to be heard; I am only
 one woman, a housewife and mother, in other
 words, a nonentity.  Must we, in every gen-
 eration, waste and spend our best in every
 useless war just to prove our point?
 I have a 3-year-old son, just 3 today, and
 I read in the paper that this war could last
 20 years.  It's just insane enough to be true.
 I will not gladly send my bright, lovely boy
 to die _in some God-forsaken mudflat for
 something, that has begun before he was
 old enough to understand it all.
 Sir, I have faith in you, both as a Senator,
 and as a, man who calls them as he sees
 them.  You are a plain spoken, honest man,
 and God knows, there are pitifully few of
 them in Washington.  You are speaking the
 truth, please make them listen, try and make
 them see what they are doing, how they
 are spending our best.  When will we get
 more?  These are men, not just machines
 to be wound up to die in Vietnam.  That's
 not what they were born for, educated for,
 carefully nurtured for. If this is all that
 faces our male children, then we ought to
 kill them at birth and save the Government
 the trouble.
 I realize that you are a busy man, and I
 won't take up any more of your time.  But,
 in conclusion, I'd just like to say, I wish,
 and most sincerely, that you were one of the
 Senators from New York so that I could say
 that my vote helped send a sane man to the
 V.S. Senate.
 God bless you in all your battles for the
 sanity of the American people.
 Sincerely,
 Mrs. ELLA WILLIAMS,

 .DEAR SENATOR                 MORSE:  I was terrified to
 hear of President Johnson's proposed fund
 towards the war in Vietnam, and to think of
 possible and probable results.
 I always was opposed to the war in Viet-
 nam, but now it seems that the United States
 Is just asking for trouble, by trying to boost
 the war fund.
 In my opinion, the only result that could
 come' troln this monstrous war fund is a
 third world war.
 Although, as a citizen of the United States,
 I am powerless in this matter, I beg you to
 do all you can to veto this fund.
 Sincerely,
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I just want to con-
 gratulate you on your stand in the Vietnam
 affair.  I think you are right on all you
 have said.  What are we there for, and what
 will we get out of it except the loss of a lot
 of our boys and money.  I was in the first
 one, the war to make the world safe for
 democracy, and the war to end wars.  How
 did we come out?  Keep up your good work.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have been follow-

 particular on Vietnam.  Your statements
 have been very logical, mature, and sensible.
 I wholly support your efforts to deescalate
 our involvement in that war and with you
 every bit of God's help in your efforts.
 It  sometimes  becomes  difficult  for  me
 to retain newspaper clippings of your state-
 ments.  I would like to have as complete
 a file as possible, and ask you to send me
 any copies of your speeches you can.
 If you do not have such copies, could you
 please let me know where I could obtain
 them.  I would be glad to pay for them.
 My best wishes for your continued health
 and activities.
 Respectfully yours,

 DEAR MR. Moss: I urge you to continue

 HONORABLE SIR: Our most profound respect
 and admiration are with you for opposing
 the President's stand in Vietnam.
 We know you are a singularly courageous
 and valiant voice of peace and truth in a
 world very much gone mad.
 You have ardent supporters and admirers
 everywhere in this land.  Would that we
 could stop this holocaust.                              We continue to
 write letters of protest to our President.
 With deep gratitude and every good wish
 for your continued efforts toward peace.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Bless you for keep-
 ing your voice raised in the Senate as a
 beacon of hope for the people of our beloved
 country and the world.
 I have written to my own Senator, Senator
 CLARK, many, many times.
 18449
 And as long as I can walk and talk I shall
 in my own small way do what I can with
 others or alone to help stop this holocaust.
 The  average  person  to  whom I  have
 talked-say, "this is all wrong but how do we
 get out."
 The answer is simple yet difficult but pos-
 sible and rational-stop the slaughter, get
 out-and give us the challenging opportunity
 to stop the bloodletting and begin to heal
 the wounds.
 With the deepest of feelings,
 Mrs. DOROTHY KUNKLE.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 "WAR FOR THE SAKE  OF JOBS?
 "The other day a representative of a great
 union sat in my office protesting my position
 on the war in Vietnam.  I listened patiently,
 very much interested in a point of view that
 is held by too many labor leaders in the
 United States today.  During the conversa-
 tion, he mentioned the great interest his
 union had in the helicopters, airplanes, mu-
 nitions, and war materiel In Vietnam that
 was  being  manufactured  by  their  labor.
 Senators know that I would be aghast.     I
 was shocked to think that even the thought
 should go through his mind that any change
 in my position should be dictated by the
 alleged benefits to the economy of the United
 States by fighting a war in South Vietnam."
 (MORSE in the Senate, July 16.)
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Inasmuch as I serve
 the American labor movement in a profes-
 sional capacity, I want you to know that I,
 too, am shocked by the position of the un-
 named leader you cited in your statement.
 I believe that the loss of even one life In the
 war in Vietnam cannot possibly be offset by
 the alleged economic benefits of such a war
 to American workers.  And I do not believe
 that American workers themselves would be
 so callous as to seek economic gains at the
 expense of lives of fellow human beings,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have long admired
 your unswerving determination to speak out
 against our Government's war policies in
 Vietnam.   Those of us in New York who
 have feared the steady escalation of the war
 for a great many months and regard the
 United Nations as one of the promising
 arenas for discussion truly value your per-
 sistent courage as you face the tremendous
 odds on the Senate floor each time you de-
 clare yourself on this subect.
 I and my friends ask that you continue
 to demand that the United States honor its
 commitment to the Charter of the United
 Nations by permitting the dispute to go be-
 fore the Security Council.   We are very
 much behind you.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 3, 1965
 there is great disagreement about what is the
 proper course of action, there is a large per-
 centage of the American people which is
 'convinced that the policy President Johnson
 is following will lead this country to military
 and moral disaster.
 I urge you to speak out against the admin-
 istration's policy.  You will find much pop-
 ular support behind you.  The hostile tones
 of the reporters' questions at President John-

 press.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your television com-
 ments on the Vietnam situation together
 with two other Democratic Congressmen was
 very  informative.   Your  comments  make
 sense and I sincerely hope that you will con-
 tinue to take the position and stand that will
 give the American people an opportunity to
 express displeasure with the method used in
 our involvement.     There are many Ameri-
 can citizens who are deeply concerned about
 the reckless method of pursuing a policy
 that can only bring us disaster.
 If sufficient Congressmen will follow your
 stand  and  proclaim  their  position for  a
 complete discussion of all the facts, then
 perhaps we will not become involved to the
 extent that it's too late to change our course.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have just heard a
 recent speech of yours in which you, once
 again, deplore the situation in Vietnam.  It
 seems that you are one of the few voices of
 reason amid the turmoil, emotionalism, and
 head-strong aggression that appears to char-
 acterize the foreign policy of the present
 administration.
 My husband and I, as well as many stu-
 dents here at the University of Buffalo hope
 that you will continue to use your influence
 to bring about a negotiated settlement and
 peace.  We only wish there were more Sen-
 ator MoasEs.
 Most sincerely,
 Mr. and Mrs. ROBERT BINCKERHOFF.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I want to express my
 gratitude to you for your consistent and
 outspoken criticism of administration poli-
 cies in Vietnam on this latest and most
 drastic occasion as in the past.  Although I
 am not one of your constituents, you have
 given far better expression to my views than
 any of the representatives from my locality,
 and it increasingly appears that you are the
 last  sane  man  in Washington.  Although
 this may not seem to be a good deal to be
 grateful  for. I am nonetheless extremely
 grateful that you are there.
 BROWNSVILLE, TEX.,
 July 28, 1965.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  While I am writing
 this to you on the stationery of the church
 of which I am the minister, yet let me make
 it crystal clear that I am speaking and writ-
 ing for only myself as an individual.
 , With full attention and great interest did
 I listen to and watch you. on TV this morn-
 ing as you held your press conference. Again
 you confounded the prognosticators as to
 what you would probably advocate and say.
 I was delighted with your appointments of
 Mr. John Chancellor as the new head of the
 Voice of America and Mr. Abe Fortas as a
 Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  May I
 say, also, that I think your appointment of
 Mr. Arthur Goldberg as our Nation's, Ambas-
 sador to the United Nations was an excellent
 choice.
 I  am sure  that  the  decisions  you an-
 nounced about the war in Vietnam, the call-
 ing up of more troops and the more than
 doubling of the draft quotas per month were
 reached only after hard, long, and painful
 thought.  I can only commiserate with you.
 While I am more than pleased that the
 number of troops to be called up for duty in
 Vietnam is smaller than the news media pre-
 dicted, yet I am concerned, even distressed,
 about what is now our Nation's official pol-
 icy, posture, and stance regarding the Viet-
 nam situation.  As I see it, it is a war pol-
 icy, posture and stance rather than a policy,
 Believe me, Mr. President, you have my
 prayerful thoughts as you discharge your
 difficult duties and responsibilities.
 Very cordially yours,
 ALBERT F. HARKINS.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Although I am not
 one of your constituents, I have followed
 your congressional activities and efforts for
 20 years and I might add with admiration.
 Why Is President Johnson pursuing this
 Vietnam thing?
 Can we win this fight short of an all-out
 atomic war?  What kind 'of an exercise is
 President Johnson putting us through?
 The only voice in the Senate that I have
 heard opposing this war has been yours.  I
 would appreciate any information you might
 send.  Thank you.

 posture andstance of peace.  This I deeply
 and sorrowfully regret.  For, again, as I see
 it, the Vietcong will have no other alterna-
 tive than to react in kind as well as the
 forces associated with that nation.  Thus we,
 the Vietnamese and the Vietcong will be, I
 believe, enlarging a vicious and widening
 circle.  To me, Mr. President, there is no
 such thing as a "just" war; war is always
 and inevitably destructive and noncreative.
 It destroys persons, and persons regardless
 of their nationality, political allegiance, race,
 creed, educational attainments and economic
 status, are of supreme and unconditioned
 worth-the most precious thrust of all cre-
 ation.  War destroys cities, towns, villages
 and much valuable material.  However lim-
 ited the war may be, nobody wins, but every-
 body loses.
 Because of these convictions may I be so
 bold and brash as to suggest what seems to
 me to be a possible creative way out of the
 present impasse: (1) that the U.N. be re-
 quested to establish a mediation commis-
 sion consisting of representatives of the de-
 mocracies,  the  Communist  bloc,  and  the
 nonalined nations  in  the U.N. Excluded
 from membership on the mediation commis-
 sion should be any nation currently involved
 in the Vietnam war; (2) that a cease-fire or
 truce be effected for an indefinite period so
 as to allow ample time for the mediation
 commission to organize and do its work (3)
 that there be agreements among the nations
 currently involved in the war that they will
 abstain from any activity whatsoever that
 would tend to influence negatively the na-
 tion they regard as their enemy; (4) that the
 mediation commission work with all delib-
 erate speed in attempting to work out a mu-
 tually satisfactory settlement of the disputes
 and issues between the nations now involved
 in warfare; and (5) that upon completion of
 the mediation commission's efforts its find-
 ings, proposals, recommendations and sug-
 gestions be announced before the General
 Assembly of the U.N. and given the widest
 possible publicity.
 I am well aware that it is easy for one
 who is not an expert in international affairs
 to engage in typewriter desk quarterbacking.
 I am aware, also, that there are risks in this
 proposal-it may not work out.  But it does
 seem to me to be worth a try in an effort to
 bring a permanent halt to this horrible and
 terrible carnage and to bring about a state
 of permanent peace-a just peace and a posi-
 tive peace.  And surely this proposal is in
 accord with the Charter of the United Na-.
 tions; to save succeeding generations from
 the scourge of war.
 Mr. President, I am taking the liberty of
 sending copies of this letter to those named
 below.  This may violate accepted protocol
 but when the world is threatened with a
 conflagration  of  immense  proportions,  I
 think protocol can be suspended.
 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SENATOR: We want you to know that
 we support your views on Vietnam, that is,

 We realize the difficulties but we must try.
 We have long hoped for China to be in the

 I  just  can't  understand the  President,
 either, especially since he had promised no
 wider war last September when he told us,
 "We think that losing 190 lives in the period
 we've been out there is bad but it is not like
 190,000 that we might lose if we escalated
 that war."
 It looks as if that was nothing more than
 a campaign promise to be broken as soon as
 he was elected.
 According to the papers he wants to go
 down as the great President.  It looks more as
 If he wants to be the last President.  I, for

 i reel especially keenly and close to the truth
 of your repeated and too often ignored warn-
 ings.  Of course, when I had the temerity to
 applaud I was hustled from the gallery.  I'm
 not sure but some of the other visitors would
 have liked to throw me out onto the floor.
 But even there, some faces registered agree-
 ment with you.
 One other thing.   I was sitting in the
 Orient Restaurant the other night when you
 and Mrs. Morse were also there having din-
 ner.  You look far too tired.  All of us need
 you too much for you to look as weary as you
 did that evening.  Please do your duty by
 the world only as far as you can maintain
 your personal health as well.

 DEAR SIR: Yours is the only sane voice I
 have heard in this wilderness of confusion.
 Keep it up, sir.   The American people are

 you, but I am with you, and I pray to God
 that you will continue to speak the truth as
 you have been doing.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:                         Yours seems to be
 one of the few courageous voices of wisdom
 and moderation still raised in the Senate
 against the wrong and dangerous policies of
 President Johnson in Vietnam.
 One can admire much that he has done
 domestically, but in the international situa-
 tion he seems to have done all we feared
 Goldwater would do and to have led us
 down a path that can end only in the third
 world war which none of us want.  Can you
 not rally your colleagues to oppose or restrain
 such a policy?  We would be the first to say
 that the United Nations should handle this
 matter were another country engaged as we
 are in a foreign nation.
 Sincerely yours,
 DEAR   SENATOR: Thank  you   for  coura-
 geously opposing President Johnson's policy
 in Vietnam.  I wish you Godspeed in your
 efforts. I  think  you  express  the real
 thoughts of the American people; thoughts
 they would express far more vocally If not
 for the stigma of being labeled "unpatriotic."
 Sincerely,
 AUGUST 2, 1965.

 DEAR SIR: The following telegram was sent
 to President Johnson today:
 "As American mothers, we implore you to
 stop the undeclared war in Vietnam.  You
 talk of peace, but you have devastated a
 country.  Now our young men are to be
 sacrificed. You must halt this madness by
 withdrawing American troops."

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: On several occasions
 in the past I have disagreed With your ideas
 and policies.  However, I now wish to con-
 gratulate you on your opinions you have
 voiced regarding our Vietnam policies.
 You must continue to express these views.
 Only through influential people as you will
 we  hope  to   impress  the  administration.
 There are many other people who share our
 views.
 We simply cannot afford to escalate the
 war in Vietnam. The United States must be
 much more willing and desirous of initiating
 negotiations, and every possible effort must
 be made to urge the United Nations to start
 efforts in bringing about a settlement.  As
 of now, we are only subjecting ourselves and
 millions of others in the world to world
 war III.
 Our poor judgment in foreign policies
 should have long been corrected.  We are
 now reaping the results.  It is time we wake
 up and live in the 20th century, instead of
 100 years ago.

 Washington, D.C., August 2, 1965.
 The Honorable WAYNE MORSE,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I amsure that you
 have noticed the article in the Friday, July
 30, New York Times by Tom Wicker suggest-
 ing that the positions taken by Members of
 the Senate played an important role in mod-
 erating the decisions made by the President
 in regard to Vietnam.
 While we appreciate fully the great difficul-
 ties confronting President Johnson in the
 very involved Vietnamese situation, we also
 believe that the restrained and thoughtful
 attitudes of many Members of the Senate
 have made a constructive contribution in the
 shaping of policy at this time.   Certainly,
 any steps taken in regard to the war in Viet-
 nam must be taken with full appreciation of
 their consequences and with every effort to
 achieve the declared goal of negotiations con-
 tinuing at the same time.
 This note will serve to express to you our
 appreciation for whatever role you may have
 played as the leaders of our Government
 faced  very  difficult  problems  and  fateful
 choices during the past 2 weeks.
 We earnestly hope that Members of the
 Senate will continue to advise with the Pres-
 ident concerning their judgments of the sit-
 uation, for in many ways they are closer to
 the concerns of the people of the Nation than
 policymakers often can be due to preoccupa-
 tion with study and detail.
 Sincerely yours,
 HERMAN WILL, Jr.,
 Associate General Secretary.
 CHICAGO, ILL.,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  I believe that your
 same courageous views on Vietnam reflect the
 true interests of the American people.  I be-
 lieve the United States has no more right
 to  intervene in South Vietnam than the
 British had in the South during our Civil
 War.
 Please keep fighting for an honest for-
 eign policy.
 Very truly yours,
 SYDNEY G. BILDERN.
 TRIBUNE,
 Los Angeles, Calif., July 28, 1965.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR:  Since you are one one of
 the few consistently principled men in Con-
 gress, I am appealing to you.  The American
 people  did not elect  Lyndon  Johnson  to
 mount a war in Asia, or anywhere else.  His
 was a mandate from the people to proceed
 in the opposite direction from Barry Gold-
 water.                                                                                Today, he might as well be Barry
 Goldwater.
 I call upon you, as conscientious public
 servant,  to  call  for the impeachment  of
 President Johnson.  He is a vain, capricious
 and  willful  man,  and  his  recent actions
 demonstrate the foolhardiness of electing
 a  southerner.  Militarism and deviousness
 have been inbred in them by hundreds of
 years of brutalizing and deceiving the Negro.
 Mr. Johnson does not have the right to
 throw away lives while he holds out for a
 cease  fire  before  negotiations.   Americans
 have continued to fight when they have
 known that the peace had already been made
 and while they awaited the official word, in
 past wars, that is.  Why stand on such a
 stupid piece of intransigence now?
 You have taken drastic action before for
 a principle.  You owe it to the thousands
 who will the futilely to do something now.
 Sincerely yours,
 ALEMENA LOMAX,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to express my

 The American. people in time will rally be-
 hind you and others who condemn the John-
 son administration for its suicidal actions in
 the field of our policy in Vietnam and the
 whole gamut of giveaway American tax dol-
 lars for this or that reason.
 We need more men like you to trumpet the
 policy of getting our nose out of everyone
 else's business.  Send no arms and no aid.
 Let them solve their own problems.  Our
 relations should be on a congenial trade
 basis.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to express my
 heartfelt commendation and admiration for
 you in the courageous and forthright stand
 you have taken against President Johnson's
 foreign policy-especially that of Vietnam.
 In my opinion, most of our foreign policy
 is idiotic and self-defeating, and that in Viet-
 nam is positively suicidal.  If we are too
 stupid to learn from history, I suppose we
 deserve what we will eventually get.
 I sincerely believe that what we are doing
 in southeast Asia is wicked. I cannot under-
 stand the double talk that comes from our
 President-"war is  peace,"  etc.,  and the
 double think that goes on in our country.
 You are a man of conviction and integrity.
 Would that every State had at least one like
 you. Long may yourepresent Oregon.
 Sincerely,
 NINA M. HARRIS.
 JULY 30, 1965.
 DEAR SIR: I want to thank you so much
 for your stand against the war.
 I thought that is what we put so much
 money into the U.N. for-to solve these prob-
 lems.  It makes me sick for all these men
 to have to go over there when there is so
 much to do and live for in this day of knowl-
 edge in every field.
 It doesn't make sense to say we are going
 to fight poverty and then go ahead and make
 more.
 I heard a reporter that was hurt and back
 here now.  He said the people over there
 didn't care who won.  He said they worked
 beside you in. the daytime and at night would
 go out and sabotage the United States.
 Maybe some countries would appreciate what
 they are doing.  But I have felt those people
 don't care.
 I wish men like you could make others
 see how foolish this war is.
 Yours truly,
 ASTORIA, ORnG., July 29, 1965.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: First, please let me
 congratulate you on your stand and voice
 about the policy in Vietnam.  I think as you
 that we are wrong there now and all my
 World War II veteran friends think so too.
 We should quit militarily.  Very interesting
 that Mark Hatfield thinks as you do on this
 and I'm very glad to have seen his vote at
 the Governors' conference.
 Please recognize this also as the hearty
 hope of myself and my wife (me a doctor of
 the  common  people,  she  a  career  social
 worker) that you will vote nay on the repeal
 of section 14(b)  of the Taft-Hartley Act.

 It seems to me you are right when you
 say we have become the aggressor nation.
 This is a position that I, as an American
 citizen do not enjoy being in.
 It seems to me Congress is playing follow
 the leader with the President.  I believe as
 I am sure millions of Americans do, that it
 is up to.Congress to put a stop to this non-
 sense over there.
 It  was  particularly heartening  to  hear
 Governor Hatfield come out against John-
 son's policies.  How long does the President
 think we can continue supporting the world
 and fighting everyone's battles?  I hope
 others in Congress will have guts enough to
 object and stop this mess.  Or are we slip-

 DEAR   SIR: We followed your advice and
 wrote letters to your colleagues and the
 President expressing our opposition to our
 increasing involvement in the fruitless war
 in Vietnam.   Your courageous pioneering
 'plus a considerable slice of more articulate
 public opinion combined with real pressures
 from friend and foe alike seem to have led
 to a more realistic evaluation of the actual
 factors involved.  This in turn has made
 the outlook for an honorable solution to that
 terrible conflict somewhat brighter.  We are
 thinking  of  the  implementation,    under
 United Nations supervision, of the terms
 of the Geneva agreement by all sides, and
 the subsequent undertaking of a southeast
 Asia development program which might give
 those sorely tried peoples new hope for a
 better life.
 The first order of business would seem a
 renewed suspension of aerial raids on North
 Vietnam in order to clear the atmosphere
 for meaningful negotiations.
 Meanwhile let us express to you again
 our heartfelt gratitude for your courageous
 work on behalf of the most lofty of human
 objectives, peace.

 to renew our efforts to thwart this path to
 oblivion.  Please continue your dissent.  The

 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,

 HONORABLE SIR: Again and again, and yet
 again, I have written imploring you to use
 your influence to stop this senseless war in
 Vietnam.  However, you seem only to listen
 to the experts (so-called), and they appar-
 ently advise to escalate this war.
 You talk about our "commitments" and
 "keeping our word."  Well.  Were there not
 promises to the voters to keep the peace?
 Let me remind you that- we voted you into
 office, as we did Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ei-
 senhower before him, believing all of you
 to be men of peace.  Now, we feel as if what
 we think means nothing to you,. but that
 what you four or five "experts" think is all
 that counts.
 If this Nation continues on its present
 policy, it will become, in my opinion, the
 most hated and distrusted among nations.
 And one might add, that instead of being
 known as a great and good president; you
 may be spoken of as one who "ruled" without
 regard to the voters' opinions, or the man
 who became a dictator.
 It is a sad commentary on this Nation's be
 havior when the neutral nations feel im-
 pelled to attempt to bring about negotia-
 tions.  Were I a Chinese or a Soviet citizen
 I would feel the same way about my nation.

 DEAR SIR: I wish to express my approval of
 your stand concerning the Vietnam situation
 and my admiration for your courage in speak-
 ing out on this apparently unpopular view.
 Although I can see no good solution to the
 Vietnam situation at this late date.  I feel
 the escalation of the war there is the worst
 of  possible  approaches  to  the  problem.
 Basically, it seems that this is the common
 problem of an emerging, uneducated, unpre-
 pared people- struggling                                                                                                                                       with  their  many
 ambitions and also weaknesses.  While I hate
 to see the people dominated by Red China.
 I feel that we have no real right to insist
 that Vietnam be dominated by the West.    I
 am also aware that an independent Indo-
 china. was organized soon after the Japanese
 left only to be squelched by the French with
 American and British approval.  In any case,
 I do not feel it is a cause worth having Ameri-
 can boys (or any other boys, for that matter)
 killed for.
 Again, let me express my appreciation for
 your courage and articulation on this matter.

 because he has the knowledge of Asia, the
 integrity and courage to speak out for what
 is right.  His speech of July 2 in the CON-
 GRESSIONAL RECORD is true.  And being true,
 what reason has the present administration,
 and  the   passel  of  politicians  who follow
 along, have in causing the increased killing
 of American men in Vietnam?         What honest
 reason can be given?
 Another fact: since 1927 when Mao Tse-
 tung came to power in China's communistic
 world, the U.S.S.R. (Stalin until his death)
 has used every means to destroy Mao.  This
 condition  still  exists.  These  two powers
 will fight each other to the end.   Anyone
 who has studied their history should know
 this.  Surely the administration knows this.
 Yet, they are doing exactly what communis-
 tic Russia has planned, if we go to war
 with China.
 If you and the, administration cause the
 death of thousands of American. men, as
 happened in Korea, to take Vietnam, we are
 face to face with 600 million or more Chin-
 ese who have good cause to hate us.  Mao's
 maggot-type armies of millions have been
 warring for the past 40 years or more. It
 is a way of life with them.  On their own
 soil they can go on fighting for another 40
 years or more, slaughtering Americans and
 eventually driving them out.  The situation
 is like a great diseased bed of quicksand.
 in view of the foregoing facts, don't you
 believe  that  the administration's  causing
 American men to die in Vietnam is nothing
 short of criminal?   Without reason?     The
 Vietnam article in Time magazine, July 9,
 gives facts of the complete degeneration of
 the Vietnam government and economy caused
 by the U.S. presence.
 I thought .Johnson would make a good
 president.  His ability in. domestic affairs
 has been good.  But I have no faith in his
 actions regarding Vietnam.  I wonder about
 the caliber of men surrounding him, their
 integrity and their motives.

 I do not know anything of your view-

 are you taking to bring peace?  I most sin-

 soon.  If anything should happen to these
 men, the responsibility rests directly on your
 shoulders and on your conscience.
 I would appreciate hearing from you.

 against the seasoned and well trained sol-
 diers of jungle war.                                    You cannot fight a war
 in the jungles with a modern Army and the
 Communists have unlimited manpower and
 get help from Russia as well as China.  That
 war might well mean a catastrophe for our
 country.  We did not have any business in
 the first place to start this war there; if
 we wanted to oust the Communists why did
 we not oust Fidel Castro from Cuba which
 is only 50 miles from our shore and clean
 up the mess in the Santo Domingo?  This
 is an immediate danger to our country, but
 the Johnson administration and the State
 Department do not seem to be concerned
 about  the  Communists  there. Congress
 should take more action concerning these
 danger spots close to our home.  Hoping you
 will continue to fight against the undertak-

 MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:          It is not easy to
 write this letter, believing as I do that you
 feel sincere in your desire for peace in Viet-
 nam.                                                                       I have followed your statements to
 the press and understand your feeling that
 you are only doing what must be done.  At
 the same time, however, I cannot help but
 feel sorely disappointed, that the man for
 whom I and millions of other Americans
 voted last November has now felt compelled
 to carry out essentially the same foreign
 policy that we then so resoundingly defeated.
 I do not believe that our Nation's "honor"
 requires military victory in Vietnam, even
 if that were possible.  What is being hurt
 is our Nation's  pride-pride in our  mili-
 tary power, and our ability to use it to make
 others do as we desire.  This Nation has
 stamped on all of its money the words "In
 God We Trust"; perhaps "in Guns We Trust"
 would be more appropriate.
 Mr. President, Christian morality compels
 us to end this conflict, even though our na-
 tional pride may suffer as a result.  Im-
 moral means always lead to immoral results,
 and continued killing of the South Viet-
 namese people (whether guerrillas or non-
 combatants) can never contribute to a last-
 ing peace, either for Vietnam or for the
 world.
 Commendable as your call for negotiations
 and for United Nations participation are, I
 fear that what your more war-minded ad-
 visors have in mind is negotiations on our
 terms only. On the contrary, we must be
 prepared to take unilateral steps to end the
 war.   Only in that way  can We hope to
 achieve a settlement that is consistent with
 both the good of the people of Vietnam, and
 our own profession of commitment to Chris-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I take this oppor-

 ageous stand you are taking against and
 concerning the Vietnam war. I am very glad
 to hear also that Gov. Marek Hatfield, of
 Oregon, also is taking such a courageous
 stand against the Vietnam war In the Gov-
 ernors conference in Minneapolis, Minn., and
 in Washington, D.C.  Thus I am very proud
 that two Representatives of the people of
 Oregon are taking this attitude against and
 concerning the war in Vietnam.   I would
 only hope that more Congressmen would do
 the same and support you because you are
 fighting a lone battle against the forces that
 would take us into World War Three if It
 goes worse in this war.  As I wrote you al-
 ready before we will never win this war,
 the French have tried it for over 20 years
 and lost out and they knew that country
 and its people far better than the Americans
 do.  Our boys over there are greenhorns

 DEAR MR. MORSE: For what little it seems
 to be worth, you have my wholehearted sup-
 port in your courageous stand against pres-
 ent U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 Many of my friends are with you also-
 and those who are not concede that there is
 no  possibility  of  political  "hay"  in your
 stand.
 In a way, it must be a lonely feeling-
 your forecasts proving correct, but your
 stature being such that "I told you so" is
 not a satisfaction available to you.  When
 this is all over, and the appraisals are made
 (if there are any appraisers still function-
 ing), my bet is that there are going to be
 many wishes that the "voice in the wilder-
 ness" had been heeded.
 To me, the indications are that we are
 becoming a garrison state with a rubber-
 stamp  attitude  toward  military  demands,
 and a smug self-satisfaction in our inter-
 national affairs.  I am anxious to support
 any movement to reverse the trend.
 Again, you have my deepest admiration
 and appreciation for your rational and self-
 less opposition to the course being pursued.

 and malice of the superpatriots through the
 extensive measures at their disposal. So I
 have some idea what this has cost you. But
 I want you to know that I support you total-
 ly, and that scores of my friends do also, and
 that many of us are literally willing to face
 any eventuality to stop this fiasco and restore
 reason and Christian political values to the

 It may be possible for you, I do not know,
 to continue your efforts to have the Congress
 reevaluate our whole position in South Viet-

 call upon the country for nonviolent protest
 against  that  policy.  These  two  meas-

 the consensus which will logically lead to
 a large-scale land war in Asia, and World

 you will do.  In this I have full confidence.

 The slaughter of women, children, and other
 noncombatants is described daily in our

 country  is  willing  to  make war  in  that
 wretched country has been made abundantly,
 horribly clear. What is not clear is what we
 are willing to do to obtain peace, for to con-

 I wish to thank you for your long and
 dauntless fight to bring some sanity into our
 policy concerning Vietnam.  You and a few
 other daring souls in our Congress and Sen-
 ate give one hope that the democratic sys-
 tem has some hope of survival.  The Presi-
 dent may be mad at you, but you keep from
 utter despair the many, many thousands who

 President JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  MR.                  PRESIDENT:  Certainly- you  will
 agree that saving the whole bodies of Ameri-
 can young men and Vietnamese soldiers and
 civilians is more important than the saving
 of face. I am very pleased that you called in
 your most recent speech on Vietnam for the
 United Nations to try to seek a solution to the
 terrible disaster that Is taking place there.
 However, r believe that we still seem to be
 too concerned with an honor that is dis-
 associated from morality.  We therefore lose
 our chance to gain true honor and glory, to
 show  that we  act on  the principle that
 human life-the lives of citizens of other na-
 tions as well as those of our own-is more im-
 portant than some abstract idea of national
 greatness.
 I therefore call upon you to consider the
 following suggestions: (1) that we again in-
 stitute a period of stopping our bombing of
 North Vietnam and of suspected Vietcong
 areas of South Vietnam.  Indeed, I hope you
 would even consider the more extreme idea
 of calling for a cease-fire.  Is it not worth it
 (so many lives would be spared) to try rea-
 son and good will before we resort to such
 horrific use of force, and (2) I would ask that
 you say not only that you would negotiate
 with all governments, but that you would be
 willing to see- the national liberation front
 co=ne to the conference table as a separate
 entity and not merely as a part of the North
 Vietnamese delegation.  Would it not be to
 our advantage to have an NLF that might be
 able to show some independence from North
 Vietnam?  I realize that our entire position
 is based on the assumption that Hanoi pulls
 the strings and that the NLF is not independ-
 ent, but isn't it worthwhile exploring the pos-
 sibility that there might be some independ-
 ence in the relationship and that it would
 be a good thing for the country of Vietnam
 if we encouraged any independence?  I be-
 lieve that our foreign policy in general suf-
 fers from a blind spot in differentiating be-
 tween different kinds of nationalisms, social-
 isms, and communisms.  We should always
 make every effort to encourage independent
 nationalist movements when they may wish
 to not be beholden to some larger and more
 powerful Communist state.
 We have not been able to help the people of
 South Vietnam to form a stable and demo-
 cratic government.  I believe they will be
 able to achieve one only if the war ends. Let
 us then make every effort-in deed as well as
 word-to help them establish peace in their
 land,
 Sincerely yours,
 Mrs. JOEL ISAACSON.

 ANOTHER WRONG WAR
 (By Judd Arnett)
 TODAY AND YESTERDAY
 What did Lyndon Johnson mean Wednes-
 day when he said of the fighting in South
 Vietnam-"It is really war"?  In a hundred
 newspaper offices across the land the editorial
 writers are probably weighing the first use
 of those words by the President in describ-
 ing our participation in that unhappy affair.
 In due course there will undoubtedly be a
 hundred interpretations.
 To me, the words brought back memories
 of another man and another crisis.  I remem-
 bered the poignancy of Franklin D. Roose-
 velt's farewell to a group of well-wishers at

 DEAR SENATOR:             Undoubtedly you receive
 many letters in regards to your stand in
 Vietnam.  Personally I admire your posi-
 tion.  This war is really a planned effort on
 the part of a few people.
 You have given many speeches on this
 subject. I  would  like  to  have  copies  of
 them. As I recall you related the steps we
 have taken to be in the position we are in at
 present.
 It is most unfortunate President Johnson
 is incapable of turning his ear to the mili-
 tary.    He seemingly deserves to be generous
 to the old and now generous in giving lives
 to a cause that has no value.  In my opinion
 he has fooled our entire Nation.  He appears

 EGG HARBOR CITY, N.J.,
 August 2, 1965.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: If only all your sup-
 porters would write to you.                        It seems as
 though so many people feel as you do about
 "What did he mean?" a hundred editorial
 writers then asked in a hundred different
 ways, but it was some months before the
 true significance of the President's goodby
 was commonly grasped.  Then it was realized
 that F.D.R. had, indeed, been trying to tell
 us something.
 Was the later President, caught in the web
 of still  another international catastrophe,
 trying to tell us something at his rather
 strange and curious press conference of July
 28?  Quite possibly.  As well as he could
 under the circumstances, he may have been
 intimating that we have reached the point
 of no return with the Red Chinese.  The war
 in Asia every American military leader of
 this century has dreaded may become a real-
 ity unless the last dove of peace can some-
 how penetrate the air cover raised by the
 hawks.  What a tragic circumstance.  How
 did it come about?
 A good deal of our share of the responsi-
 bility has stemmed from the American obses-
 sion with communism, bordering,at times on
 hysteria. Off and on since 1919 we have
 been witchhunting in this country,,at times
 paying homage to nitwits who had no other
 credentials  beyond  the  ability  to shrill-
 "There goes a Communist!"
 The result has been a gradual creation of
 a mass inner-instinct to look up on every
 Communist, real or fancied, regardless of
 his location, as a mortal enemy, to be eradi-
 cated  by  any  means.   That  communism,
 particularly when it followed on the heels of
 czarism or some other form of tyranny, might
 be a first step toward freedom has not oc-
 curred to many of us.     We have crusaded
 instead for instant democracy, little realizing
 that it has small chance in this world under
 existing circumstances.
 This obsession has led us into faraway
 places, in the role of the policeman, where
 we had no hope of success.  Vietnam was
 such a place, but we went there, and stayed
 there, because of the assurance that we were
 "fighting communism."  Bosh. To this day
 the average citizen of that hellhole, north
 or south, does not know the difference be-
 tween Marxism and the Bill of Rights.  Nor
 could he care less.  What he wants, in es-
 sence, is what Douglas MacArthur once said
 all Asians were seeking: a roof over his head,
 clothes on his back, food in his belly, and
 the chance to express a bit of nationalism.
 He would appreciate help from all sides, then
 would the foreigners kindly go home, please?
 For years in this country the atmosphere
 has been such that if a decent citizen car-
 ried a sign in a parade, advocating peace,
 he was immediately classified as some kind
 of a nut.  We have even made fun of the
 Quakers,  the  gentlest  people  with  whom
 our society has been endowed.
 A Quaker, mind you, saying that there
 might be something to brotherly love if only
 we pursued it, has been an object of scorn.
 That obsession, again; that inner-instinct;
 that inner-fear; that disregard for the evolu-
 tion of political ideas; that reluctance to pro-
 vide a trouble world with moral and spiritual
 leadership; that substitute for warmth and
 compassion-dollar diplomacy.
 Well, here we are.  At least, here we are
 if I interpret the President's remarks with
 any degree of accuracy. Another wrong war,
 in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
 Sure we will fight it; "My country, right
 or wrong"; certainly we shall win it.  But
 isn't it about time more of us asked: Was
 this war necessary-and how do we avert
 the next one?

 BEHIND  THE MASK
 (By Judd Arnett)
 Persistent visitors to this outpost may
 recall that a sense of uneasiness has been
 weighing upon the sentry who mans it.
 The night has been dark; there have been
 rustling noises out beyond the barbed wire;
 in the distance a dog has howled; to the
 corporal of the guard the sentry has said-
 "There is - something wrong with America."
 But what?  Until now, therehave been no
 proper words for it.  Just mumblings of
 things half seen and whispers half heard.
 Oh, for the power of communication; oh, to
 be able  to draw a    word  picture for the
 corporal of the guard.
 So thank heaven for Seymour Melman,
 who has put the gist of my uneasiness into
 disturbing sentences. They appeared in the
 July 31 edition of Saturday Review in an
 article entitled "Behind the Mask of Success."
 They were but a preview, we are told, of what
 he has written in a book-"Our Depleted
 Society."
 Dr. Melman is a professor of industrial
 engineering at Columbia University and he
 has looked at America through the eyes of a
 man appalled at the erosion occurring in
 our productive capacity.  He states what he
 has seen in this fashion:
 "A process  of  technical,  industrial  and
 human deterioration has been set in motion
 within American society.  The competence
 of the industrial system is being eroded at
 its base.  Entire industries are falling into
 technical disrepair, and there is massive loss
 of productive employment because of the
 inability  to  hold  even  domestic  markets
 against foreign competition.
 "Such depletion in economic life produces
 wide-ranging human deterioration at home.
 The wealthiest Nation on earth has been
 unable to rally the resources necessary to
 raise one-fifth of its own people from poverty.
 "The same basic depletion operates as an
 unseen hand restricting America's relations
 with the rest of the world, limiting foreign-
 policy moves  primarily to military-based
 initiatives."
 What  has caused  this  erosion?   High
 wages? Pleasure seeking? A breakdown in

 public morals?  Widespread unrest because
 of the civil rights revolution?  No, no-none
 of these.
 "The deterioration," Dr. Melrnan writes, "is
 the result of an, unprecedented concentra-
 tion of America's technical talent and fresh
 capital on military production. * * ' Military
 extravagance  has  been  undermining  the
 world value of the dollar and with it the
 world banking position of the United States."
 What is wrong, you may be asking, with a
 Nation that in 1964 produced goods with a
 total value of more than $600 billion? Did
 any of our enemies approach this outpour-
 ing, or any of our friends?  Again, no; we
 were in a class by ourselves. But statistics
 can be deceiving.  To get at the truth you
 have to rephrase the question, How much
 of our production, our growth, was healthy,
 and how much was parasitic?
 Too much was parasitic.  Bad enough was
 the  fact  that. $50 billion of  the Federal
 budget went into the arms and space races,
 which expended manpower and materials
 without, contributing to the Nation's eco-
 nomic health or to future. production.. But
 even worse was the siphoning-off of the
 technicians and scientists so sorely needed
 in industry.
 Very few American companies, Dr. Melman
 notes, are now undertaking extensive re-
 search programs.  For every 100,000 Ameri-
 cans, there are 11 fewer physicians in prac-
 tice than in 1950.  We were short 118,000
 schoolteachers at .tile start of the 1964, au-
 tumn term.  Only 9 percent of our foreign
 trade is carried in American ships-because
 our shipyards have been oriented primarily
 to serving the Navy. And this, if you please:
 "Americans must begin to face the bitter
 fact that, in many areas of industrial tech-
 nology, the United States has already become
 second-rate."
 Our emphasis, and much too much of our
 brainpower, has been devoted to overkill.
 Today, we can deliver the equivalent of 6
 tons of TNT for every person on this planet.
 In overkill, things are booming, you might
 say. But this is progress?

 DEAR SENATOR: We understand you are tak-

 and its impending holocaust.  I and all I
 have talked to are against any involvement
 there and for a complete reversal of our steps
 and thorough withdrawal from that area.
 Our naval control of the seas is ,enough.  We

 DEAR SIR: I write to express my concern
 over the crisis in Vietnam.  I think that
 the increased war is a mistake.  We must
 use our ingenuity to arrange a cease-fire.
 The. reputation of our country is being se-

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I fully support your
 position  for letting the Vietnamese settle
 their differences by a return to the 1954

 We must honor that agreement and stop

 MR. SENATOR: Three cheers for a man with
 courage enough to shout down the United
 States latest political endeavor.
 I am against the Vietnam fray and glad
 to see at least one Senator is also. There is
 no justification to sending Americans to
 their death in a country which doesn't want
 us, will throw us out if "we" win (win
 what?), and imprison all Americans if we
 lose.  I can hardly believe that once again
 our country is in such a worthless mess.

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: It is a tragic mistake
 for us to be involved in fighting an ever-ex-
 tending war in Vietnam.  Our present posi-
 tion in Vietnam brings us more fear among
 our allies and more enemies than any Com-
 munist regime could hope to do.
 The United States must join with the
 United Nations in bringing about negotia-
 tions for a peaceful settlement In Vietnam.
 It is imperative that the Vietminh, as well as
 all other parties involved in the war, be
 brought to the negotiating table.  This is
 the only way in which a real solution could
 be achieved.  The Vietnamese people must
 be allowed to determine their own political
 and economic organization and must be
 guaranteed by the United Nations from in-
 tervention by China, the U.S.S.R., the United
 States, or any other country.
 The war in Vietnam cannot be won by us
 with guns, bombs, fire, the torture of Viet-
 namese guerrillas, or by the destruction of
 the face of Vietnam.  On the other hand,
 your idea of calling for international aid in
 developing the Mekong River Delta is far-
 sighted and humanitarian.  Such ,a develop-
 ment would go down in history as one of the
 great achievements of mankind and your
 name would become one of the bright stars
 in the memories of all peoples.
 Respectfully yours,

 RIGHT OR WRONG   AMBASSADOR LODGE RETURNS
 (By Rev. Daniel Lyons, S.J.)
 Two years ago our commander in South
 Vietnam, General Harkins, declared that the
 war was almost won.- Secretary of Defense_
 McNamara told us that most of our troops
 would be home by Christmas.  Sir Robert
 Thompson, who was  head of the British
 Advisory Mission to South Vietnam, noti-
 fied his superiors at Whitehall that the
 Vietnamese Government "had turned the
 corner and was winning the country back
 from the Communists."  Our distinguished
 career Ambassador, Frederick E. Nolting, _Jr.,
 agreed  wholeheartedly with  these  reports
 and -continued backing the Diem regime.
 President Diem, was so successful that the
 Communists were determined to get rid of
 him.  It ,was their only chance to avoid de-
 feat.                                                                                                                                         In order to get him out, the Com-
 munist concentrated on a propaganda cam-
 paign against him.   They soon convinced
 reporters that the Government was perse-
 cuting the Buddhists.  Ambassador Nolting
 said that in 21/a years he had not seen any
 signs of religious persecution, but the cor-
 respondents kept reporting that there was.
 Their proof was the fact that several Bud-
 dhists committed suicide. A suicide actually
 does not prove anything, but pictures of
 two or three suicides in Saigon electrified
 the world.  They even made a great impres-
 sion on the White House.
 Averell Harriman had been urging Presi-
 dent Kennedy to appoint Henry Cabot Lodge
 as Ambassador to South Vietnam, and when
 Lodge walked into the President's Office in
 June 1963, the President exclaimed: "Just
 look at this.  Where is It all going to end?"
 He showed Lodge a newspaper photo of a
 Buddhist committing suicide.  Kennedy told
 Lodge that the people in Vietnam were
 against President Diem and our policy there
 was liable to fail.  He urged Lodge to go to
 Saigon and take over.
 THE FIRST MISTAKE
 The biggest single mistake about Lodge
 was for the administration to send him there
 in the first place. He did not have any ex-
 perience in Asia, or as an Ambassador to any
 country.  Both former President Eisenhower
 and former Vice President Nixon advised
 Lodge not to take the appointment.  But he
 did, and he arrived in Saigon in August 1963,
 only to commit blunder after blunder.  His
 first mistake was to present himself publicly
 to the leaders of the Buddhists before he
 called on the President of the country.  Less
 than. 2$ hours after he_ arrived, he wired
 Washington that Diem would have to go.
 ,His next blunder was to grant asylum to the
 Buddhist monk, Thich Tri Quang, who had
 been trained by the Communists, and whose
 three brothers were Communists,  Tri Quang
 had been giving the Government a great deal
 of trouble, and Lodge gave him sanctuary in
 the Embassy for 10 weeks, until Diem was as-
 sassinated, even though it was against our
 regulations.  Trf Quang's pagoda was the
 headquarters for the Communist Youth Or-

 ganization.  Father Raymond de Jaegher has
 since testified that Tri Quang was a Commu-
 nist all along.
 The Communists had gained control of
 only 14 of the 3,500 Buddhist pagodas in
 South Vietnam, but the 14 got all the atten-
 tion from the press, with their cries of per-
 secution.  The Communists also spread the
 rumor among American officials in Saigon
 that Diem was trying to make a Catholic
 state out of the country, and that the 500,000
 Protestant in South Vietnam were going to
 be persecuted.
 Ambassador Lodge told President Diem
 that he said send his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu,
 away.  Lodge gave no real reasons for this,
 and Diem pointed out that it was like asking
 President Kennedy to get rid of his brother,
 the Attorney General.  Shortly before his
 death, Counselor Nhu declared that at first
 they thought Lodge, being a Republican,
 "would possess good anti-Communist feel-
 ings, but he did not.                    His political views
 seemed to be dominated by Linus Pauling in
 the New York Times,    and the neutralist
 preaching of Walter Lippmann.  * * * Lodge
 never stopped working against us.  His only
 care has been to intrigue against the legal
 government to which he was accredited."
 THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
 When President Diem requested Lodge to
 send  four           Americans  away  for plotting
 against Diem, Lodge failed to do-so.  Lodge
 told Diem he should replace his ministers,
 who were civilians, with army generals.  He
 even had the generals polled to see If they
 would lead a coup.  None of them wanted
 to, but as Marguerite Higgins wrote: "Every-
 one in Vietnam knew that America had de-,
 clared political war on Diem."
 Secretary of State Rusk had praised Presi-
 dent Diem highly just a few months before
 we instigated his death.  So had Vice Presi-
 dent Lyndon Johnson, and Senate Majority
 Leader MIKE MANSFIELD.  Secretary of De-
 Tense McNamara described the magnificent
 work done by Diem as "a near miracle."
 The House Committee on Foreign Affairs,
 a few weeks before Diem's death, declared:.
 "In the 8 years since Diem took power, Viet-
 nam has acquired full independence, written
 a constitution, and held the first four na-
 tional elections based on universal suffrage
 ever conducted in Vietnam."
 To refute the Communist charges that
 'Diem was persecuting the Buddhists, Diem
 had asked the United Nations to send a
 factfinding  mission  to  Investigate.  The
 report was due to come out that fall, but
 after Diem was killed the United Nations
 did its best to suppress It.   It was finally
 uncovered by Senator THOMAS J. DODD, and
 published by the Senate Internal Security
 Subcommittee.  It completely cleared the
 late President from charges of persecution.
 South Vietnam had enjoyed nearly 10
 years of stable rule under. President Diem,
 and both American and British officials had
 declared that the war was being won.  When
 the Communists  in  Vietnam heard about
 Diem's death, they exclaimed that it was
 "too good to be true."  Of the 8,000 stra-
 tegic hamlets that President Diem. had built
 to protect the peasants from the Vietcong,
 5,000 were taken over by the Communists
 after  his  death.  The war was prolonged
 several years by the death of Diem, a death
 brought on by the policy of American of-
 ficials.  Somehow, through a merciful pro-
 vidence, it is hoped that this time Ambas-
 sador Lodge will not impede the defeat of
 communism,  but  expedite  it.   In  either
 case, his appointment remains a mystery.

 DEAR GOVERNOR HATFIELD: Thank you for
 your courageous stand at the Governors'
 conference  and later at the Presidential

 most thoughtful bipartisan reading and con-
 sideration.                                                                                   Viewpoint  was  obscured  by
 misleading headlines.
 I am grateful that you joined Governor
 Romney in calling for action by the United

 stitution and (2)  that of the United Na-
 tions.  This is indeed a crisis which threat-
 ens not only the peace but the very existence
 of all people.

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:                          I endorse what the
 Clergymen's Emergency Committee for Viet-
 nam has to say in the newspaper ad, New
 York Times, August 1.
 Indeed, I go further than the committee
 does and say that I believe we should with-
 draw from Vietnam forthwith.
 Mr. President, you have said our "national
 honor" is at stake and that we can't with-
 draw now. - With all due respect, may I say
 that leaders In all wars and on all sides have
 said that-all have believed they were right
 and that God was on their side.  This think-
 ing has caused countless millions to the and
 countless millions to be orphaned.  We can
 no longer think in this way if we wish civili-
 zation to survive.
 If the Communists act dishonorably that
 is no moral defense for our acting so.  Un-
 less I am completely wrong about the facts
 of the Geneva agreement and our promises
 in connection therewith, I do not feel that
 we acted altogether with honor there.
 So, I believe we should leave Vietnam now,
 and I say this being fully aware of our com-
 mitment.  A much larger thing is at stake
 than this. Besides I have a hunch the great
 mass of the people In South Vietnam would
 be very glad to see us go.  Present withdrawal
 would take great courage, perhaps too much,
 for the political wolves would surely be at
 you.  But I think the world would salute
 you.
 Aside from the moral question involved, I
 believe our present policy in Vietnam is un-
 sound.  We might succeed in killing and
 maiming an awful lot of Asiatics but our
 policy would fail.  You can't create anti-
 Colnmunists  by killing people-you only
 create more Communists, or some Other dis-
 tasteful breed of 'late.
 Mr. President, I voted for you and I admire
 you for what you have done in several im-
 portant directions.  It is not the purpose of
 this letter to carp, but only to express a
 simple-deep-seated conviction.

 11 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248)
 is amended by adding after subsection (j)
 the following subsection:
 "(k) To` delegate, by published order or
 rule and subject to the Administrative Pro-
 cedure Act, any of its functions, other than
 those relating to rulemaking or pertaining
 principally to monetary and credit policies,
 to one or more hearing examiners, members
 or employees of the Board, or Federal Reserve
 banks. The assignment of responsibility for
 the performance of any function that the
 Board determines to delegate shall be a
 function of the Chairman.  The Board shall,
 upon the vote of one member, review action
 taken at, a delegated level within such time
 and in such manner as the Board shall by
 rule prescribe,
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the RECORD an excerpt from the report
 (No. 533), explaining the purposes of the
 bill.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 S.  1556 would authorize the Board of
 Governors of the Federal Reserve System to
 delegate any of its functions, other than
 those relating to rulemaking or pertaining
 principally to monetary and credit policies,
 to one or more hearing examiners, members,
 or employees of the Board, or Federal Reserve
 banks.
 The Chairman of the Board would be au-
 thorized? to assign responsibility for the per-
 formance of. functions  delegated by the
 Board.  Any one member of the Board might
 under the bill require the Board to review
 actions taken under the delegation.
 S. 1556 would give the Federal Reserve
 Board the same powers of delegation which
 have been granted to most independent
 boards and commissions.  Such authority is
 possessed,  for  example, by  the  Interstate
 Commerce Commission, the Federal Trade
 Commission, the Federal Home Loan Bank
 Board, the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Fed-
 eral Maritime Commission, and the Securi-
 ties and Exchange Commission.
 The situation with which the Board of
 Governors is presently faced because of its
 lack of specific authority to delegate any of
 its functions Is, described in the following
 excerpt from a message sent to Congress by
 President Kennedy on April 13, 1961:
 "The reduction of existing delays in our
 regulatory agencies requires the elimination
 of needless work at their top levels.  Because
 so many of them were established in a day
 of a less complex economy, many matters
 that could and should in large measure be
 resolved at a lower level required decision
 by the agency members themselves.         Even
 where, by the force of circumstances, many
 of these matters are now actually deter-
 mined at a lower level they still must bear
 the  imprimatur  of  the  agency      members.
 Consequently, unnecessary and unimportant
 details occupy far too much of the time and
 energy of agency members, and prevent full
 and expeditious consideration of the most
 important issues."
 Under the bill the Board could not dele-
 gate its rulemaking functions or those per-
 taining principally to monetary and credit
 policies.
 The Board pointed out that in recent years
 its responsibilities have increased tremen-
 dously, both in the field of monetary and
 credit policies and in the field of bank su-,
 pervision and regulation.  For example, the
 Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Bank
 Merger Act of 1960, and the Securities Acts
 Amendments of 1964 have imposed substan-
 tial additional regulatory responsibilities on
 the Board of Governors.
 No. 141-15
 The Board gave the following examples of
 kinds of actions which it might delegate if
 the bill were enacted-though no decision
 to do so has yet been made: extensions of
 time for filing reports by affiliates of State
 member banks; extensions of time for regis-
 tration by bank holding companies; exten-
 sions of time for registration of securities
 of State member banks;  waivers of the
 6-month notice that a State member bank
 must give before withdrawing from member-
 ship; approvals of investments by State mem-
 ber banks in bank premises in excess,gf their
 capital stock; approvals of the declaration
 of dividends by State member banks under
 certain circumstances, and approvals of the
 purchase of certain stocks by foreign banking
 corporations.
 It is expected that the enactment of this
 bill, by relieving the Board of unnecessary
 detail, would enable it to act more effectively
 and more expeditiously on the major func-
 tions  which would  not be delegated.   It
 would be appropriate for the Board to indi-
 cate in future annual reports the extent to
 which this authority to delegate is exercised
 and the benefits resulting from such delega-
 tions.
 ENABLING   FEDERAL   RESERVE
 BANKS TO INVEST IN CERTAIN
 OBLIGATIONS OF FOREIGN GOV-
 ERNMENTS
 The bill (S. 1557) to amend the Fed-

 "(e) To establish accounts with other Fed-
 eral Reserve banks for exchange purposes
 and, with the consent or upon the order and
 direction of the Board of Governors of the
 Federal Reserve System and under regula-
 tions to be prescribed by said board, to open
 and maintain accounts in foreign countries,
 appoint correspondents, and establish agen-
 cies in, such countries wheresoever it may
 be deemed best for the purpose of purchasing,
 selling, and collecting bills of exchange, and
 to buy and sell, with or without its endorse-
 ment, through such correspondents or agen-
 cies, bills of exchange (or acceptances) aris-
 ing out of actual commercial transactions
 which have not more than ninety days to run,
 exclusive of days of grace, and which bear
 the signature of two or more responsible
 parties, and to buy and sell any securities
 which are direct obligations of, or fully guar-
 anteed as to principal and interest by, any
 foreign government or monetary authority,
 and which have maturities from date of_pur-
 chase not exceeding twelve months and are
 denominated payable in any convertible cur-
 rency; and, with the 'consent of the Board
 of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
 to open and maintain banking accounts for
 such foreign correspondents or agencies, or
 foreign banks or bankers, or for foreign states
 as defined in section 25(b) of this Act."
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the RECORD an excerpt from the report,
 No. 534, explaining the purposes of the
 bill.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 18461
 S. 1557 would authorize Federal Reserve
 banks to invest in securities which are direct
 obligations of or fully guaranteed as to prin-
 cipal and interest by any foreign government
 or monetary authority and which have ma-
 turities from date of purchase not exceeding
 12 months and are denominated payable in
 any convertible currency.  This authority
 could be exercised with the consent or under
 the order and direction of the Federal Re-
 serve Board.
 From time to time the Federal Reserve
 banks have had occasion to engage in foreign
 currency operations designed to safeguard
 the value of the dollar in international ex-
 change markets.  These operations have been
 implemented by swap arrangements between
 the New York Federal Reserve Bank and for-
 eign central banks under which the New York
 Federal  Reserve  Bank  acquires  foreign
 currencies.
 Under the present law amounts held by a
 Federal Reserve bank in an account with a
 foreign bank may be invested in bills of
 exchange and acceptances that arise out of
 actual  commercial  transactions  and  have
 maturities of not more than 90 days, or they
 may be placed in an interest-bearing time
 account with the same or some other foreign
 bank.   However, this has not always been
 practicable.  Under present law, such funds
 may not be invested in obligations of foreign
 governments, such as foreign treasury bills,
 which are more readily available under pres-
 ent conditions.                                                                                                                                         S. 1557 would permit this.
 This proposal was recommended by the
 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
 System and was supported by the Treasury
 Department.
 LOANS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
 BY MEMBER BANKS OF THE FED-
 ERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
 The bill (S. 1558) to amend section
 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act relat-
 ing to loans to executive officers by mem-
 ber banks of the Federal Reserve System
 and for other purposes was considered,
 ordered to be engrossed for a third read-
 ing, read the third time, and passed, as
 follows :
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives  of  the  United  States  of
 America in Congress assembled, That sub-
 section (g) of section 22 of the Federal Re-
 serve Act (12 U.S.C. 375a) is amended by
 striking out the first two sentences thereof
 and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
 "(g)  No executive  officer of, any member
 bank shall borrow from or otherwise become
 indebted to any member bank of which he is
 an executive officer, and no member bank
 shall make any loan or extend credit in any
 other manner to any of its own executive
 officers:  Provided, That any member bank
 may extend credit, on terms not more favor-
 able than those extended to other borrowers,
 to any executive officer thereof, and such of-
 ficer may become indebted thereto, in an
 amount not exceeding $5,000, or, in the case
 of a first mortgage loan on a home owned
 and occupied or to be owned and occupied
 by such officer, in an amount not exceeding
 $30,000, but any such indebtedness shall be
 promptly reported by such  officer  to the
 board of directors of the bank of which he
 is an officer.  If any executive officer of any
 member bank borrows from or if he be or
 become indebted to any other bank or banks
 in an aggregate amount exceeding that which
 he could lawfully borrow from the member
 bank of which he is an executive officer
 under this section, he shall make a written
 report to the board of directors of such mem-
 ber bank, stating the date and amount of
 such loan or loans or indebtedness, the se-

 I have directed Secretary Rusk and Secre-
 tary McNamara to be available immediately
 to the Congress to review with these commit-
 tees, the appropriate congressional commit-
 tees, what we plan to do in these areas.  I
 have asked them?to be able to answer the
 questions of any Members of Congress.
 Secretary McNamara, in addition, will ask
 the Senate Appropriations Committee to add
 a limited amount to present legislation to
 help meet part of this new cost until a
 supplemental measure is ready, and hearings
 can be held when the Congress assembles in
 January.
 In the meantime, we wild use the authority
 contained in the present defense appropria-
 tion, bill under consideration to transfer
 funds In addition to the additional money
 that we w,ll ask.
 These steps, like our other actions in the
 past, are carefully measured to do what must
 be done to bring an end to aggression and a
 peaceful settlement.
 READY >?'OR CONFERENCES
 We do, not want an expanding struggle
 with consequences that no one can perceive,
 nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt our
 power, but we will not surrender and we
 will not retreat, _ for behind our American
 pledge lies the determination and resources,
 I believe, of all the American Nation.
 Second, once the Communists know, as we
 know, that a violent solution is impossible,
 .then a peaceful solution is inevitable.
 We are ready now, as we have always been,
 to move from the battlefield to the confer-
 ence table. I have stated publicly, and many
 times, again and again, America's willing-
 ness to begin unconditional discussions with
 any government at any place at any time.
 Fifteen efforts have been made to start these
 discussions with , the help of 40 nations
 throughout the world, but there has been
 no answer,
 But we are going to persist, if persist we
 must, until death and desolation have led to
 the same conference table where others could
 now join us at a much smaller cost.
 I have spoken many times of our objec-
 tives in Vietnam.  So has the government
 of South Vietnam. Hanoi has set forth Its
 own proposal.  We are ready to discuss their
 proposals and our proposals and any proposals
 of any government whose people may be af-
 fected~ for we fear the meeting room no more
 than we fear the battlefield.
 WELCOMES  ASSISTANCE
 In this pursuit, we welcome and we ask
 for the concern and the assistance of any
 nation and all nations.  If the United Na-
 tions and its officials or any one of its 114
 members can by deed or word, private initi-
 ative or public action, bring us nearer an
 honorable peace, then they' will have the
 support and gratitude of the United States
 of America.
 I have directed Ambassador Goldberg to
 go to New York today to present immedi-
 ately to Secretary General U Thant a letter
 from me requesting that all of the resources,
 energy, and immense prestige of the United
 Nations be employed to find ways to halt
 aggression and to bring peace in Vietnam.
 I made a similar request at San Francisco
 a few weeks ago, because we do not seek the
 destruction of any government, nor do we
 covet a foot of any territory, but we insist
 and we will always insist that the people of
 South Vietnam shall have the right of choice,
 the right to shape their own destiny in free
 elections in the south, or throughout all
 Vietnam under international supervision and
 that they shall not .have any government im-
 posed upon them by force and terror so long
 as we can prevent it.
 This, was the purpose of the 1954 agree-
 ments which the Communists. have now
 cruelly shattered.  If the machinery of those
 agreements was tragically weak, its purposes
 still guide our actions.  As battle rages, we

 WOULD HELP ALL ASIA
 As I said at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,
 I hope that one day' we can help all the
 people of Asia toward that desire.  Eugene
 Black has made great progress since my ap-
 pearance in Baltimore in that direction-not
 as the price of peace, for me are ready always
 to bear more painful cost, but rather as a
 part of our obligations of justice toward our
 fellow man.
 Let me also add now a personal note.  I
 do not find it easy to send the flower of our
 youth, our finest  young men, into battle.
 I have spoken to you today of the divisions
 and the forces and the battalions and the
 units.  But I know all of them, every one.
 I have seen them in a thousand streets, of a
 hundred towns, of every State in this Un-
 ion-working and laughing and building, and
 filled with hope and life.  I think I know too
 how their mothers weep and their families
 sorrow.  This is the most agonizing and most
 painful duty of your President.
 There is something else, too.  When I was
 young, poverty was so common we didn't
 know it had a name.  An education was
 something you had to fight for. Water was
 really life itself.  I .have now been in public
 life 35 years, more than three decades, and
 in each of those 35 years I have seen good
 men, and wise leaders, struggle to bring the
 blessings to the land of our people.  Now,
 I am the President.
 It Is now my opportunity to help every
 child get an education, to help every Negro
 and every American citizen have an equal
 opportunity, to have every family get a de-
 cent home and to help bring healing to the
 sick and dignity to the old.
 As I have said before, that is what I have
 lived for.  That is what I have wanted all
 my life since I was a little boy, and I do not
 want to see all those hopes and all those
 dreams of so many people for so many years
 now drowned in the wasteful ravishes of
 cruel wars.
 I am going to do all I can to see that never
 happens. But I also know, as a realistic pub-
 lic servant, that as long as there are men who
 hate and destroy, we must have the courage
 virtually unanimous in advocating rep-
 resentation on the basis of population.
 Thomas Jefferson once said:
 Equal representation is so fundamental a
 principle in a true republic that no prejudice
 can justify its violation because the prej-
 udices themselves cannot be justified.
 Yet the blunt truth is that this is ex-
 actly what we are being asked to do.  We
 are being asked to give constitutional
 standing to a particular prejudice-a
 prejudice against people who live in
 urban and suburban areas in favor of
 people who live in rural areas.
 It is significant, I believe, that even
 before the Federal Union was formed,
 the Northwest Ordinance passed by the
 Congress under the Articles of Confed-
 eration provided that there be one rep-
 resentative for a specified number of in-
 habitants.  Of the 20 States joining the.
 Union after ratification of the Constitu-
 tion and before the Civil War, all but 2
 made population the basis for legislative
 representation in both Houses.
 If history is not as strong a reed as
 supporters of this amendment claim, the
 realities of the 20th century are even
 less encouraging.  Any believer in our
 Federal system must be concerned by,
 the steady erosion of the role of the
 States in this century. This amendment
 will not halt that erosion.  On the con-

 The Senate resumed the consideration

 provide for the designation of the period
 from August 31 through September 6 in
 1965,  as "National American Legion

 I suspect that the ordinary citizen still
 does not realize that what is at stake in
 this debate is his, and every man's, right
 to have an equal voice with his neigh-
 ers think alike and that all urbanites and
 suburbanites think differently.  And,
 from our own experience, we know this
 is not so.  For example, only 2 years ago
 wheat farmers divided almost evenly in
 rejecting the wheat program developed
 by the Department of Agriculture.
 And the same differences in view are
 characteristic of the suburban and urban
 dweller. For farmers and city men and
 suburbanites are more than just that.
 They may be young or old, rich or poor,
 producers as well as consumers, parents
 or bachelors, union members or busi-
 ness executives, wise or stupid, regardless
 of where they live. Geographic location
 may have an influence, but it is only one
 of many factors affecting a given indi-
 vidual.

 which has been most inclined to take
 water for granted and least receptive to
 the changes which must come sooner
 or later.  Within the next year, while
 the water shortage continues, there is
 an opportunity to make these changes.
 Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced
 a measure entitled the Federal Water
 Commission Act, based in large part on
 the Model Water Use Act adopted in
 1958 by the National Conference of Com-
 missioners on Uniform State Laws.  The
 act would cover all water use or water-
 polluting activity affecting any naviga-
 ble, interstate, or coastal water in the
 United States.
 Taking or pollution of these waters
 would be governed by uniform Federal
 standards aimed at insuring that they
 are employed only for beneficial uses.
 A five man Federal Water Commission,
 modeled after the Federal Power Com-
 mission, would administer and enforce
 the law.
 The key provision of the bill authorizes
 the Commission to require and issue
 permits for all uses of water resources
 covered by the bill, including any ac-
 tivity which results in water pollution.
 The  Federal  permit  procedure  spe-
 cifically protects existing uses so long as
 they remain beneficial and serve the pub-
 lic interest.  Householders taking water
 directly from wells or streams for nor-
 mal domestic use are exempted from
 the permit procedure.
 Permits issued by the Commission
 would continue in effect for a minimum
 period of 5 years.  This provision, al-
 though working to the disadvantage of
 a regional, State, or local government
 which quickly corrected the shortcom-
 ings in its own laws, would remove the
 market-depressing element of uncer-
 tainty which would otherwise affect sales
 of water-related assets.  Further, the
 bill provides scrupulous procedural safe-
 ugards and inqualified right of appeal in
 connection with a decision to invoke the
 Federal licensing procedure.
 Another major provision of the bill
 authorizes the Commission to suspend
 the application of Federal licensing pro-
 cedures when it finds, after a hearing,
 that regional, State, or local regulations
 will adequately effectuate the purposes
 of the act.  This suspension or retroces-
 sion of jurisdiction over Federal waters
 would be subject to routine review after
 5 years, and extraordinary reconsidera-
 tion at an earlier date, if an investigation
 and hearing reveal that a particular ju-
 risdiction  had  fallen  below  Federal
 standards in its water use policy.
 The bill also provides the Commission
 with the powers to deal with two classes
 of acute problems: water shortages and
 water emergencies. Where the Commis-
 sion finds that a shortage exists or is de-
 veloping, it may take such steps as re-
 quiring  water  rotation,  barring  new
 water uses, and prorating available sup-
 plies among existing users. Where these
 steps are inadequate to protect public
 health and safety, the Commission may
 take more urgent measures, such as out-
 right water rationing and emergency ap-
 propriation of private water supplies.
 Of course, after the Federal Water
 Commission is in operation, it should de-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE
 velop a long range plan of allocation. If
 this plan is executed properly, shortages
 will be anticipated, and we will not live
 from crisis to crisis.
 Finally, the bill makes two changes in
 the Water Resources Planning Act of
 1965. First, it deletes altogether the ban
 on planning interbasin water transfers.
 Second, It recasts the Water Resource
 Council in the role of an advisory com-
 mittee to the Commission.  This con-
 forms the Council's role to the original
 1956 proposal of the Presidential Ad-
 visory Committee on Water Resource
 Policy, which envisaged the Council as
 an advisory committee to a water re-
 source coordinator who would be in turn
 responsible to the President.
 Mr. Speaker, the principal effect of
 my bill would be to establish a Federal
 Water Commission as a water policy re-
 view board, dealing chiefly with the laws
 and regulations of other governmental
 agencies and political subdivisions.  As
 such, it should be acceptable in principle
 to those who have confidence in the wis-
 dom of their region's allocation of its
 water resources and wish to retain dis-
 cretionary control at the regional or local
 level.
 The Federal Government has respond-
 ed to the critical water shortage In the
 Northeast with prompt technical assist-
 ance to regional, State and local authori-
 ties.
 However, Federal action thus far has
 failed to face the hard fact that we must
 have an integrated national policy of
 water conservation, water development,
 and water pollution control.  It is in-
 conceivable and, in' view of the present
 crisis, intolerable to reject the principle
 of Federal coordination for water re-
 sources when we now embrace it actively
 in developing a national electric power
 grid.  Water is quite obviously a scarcer
 resource and far more vulnerable to the
 devastating caprices of nature.  The
 Federal Water Commission bill I have
 introduced today would close this glaring
 gap in our nation's resource policy in a
 way consistent with both existing re-
 gional differences and the paramount
 necessity of securing an ample, constant
 water supply for all citizens of-bke United
 Ing "that all the resources, energy, and
 immense prestige of the United Nations

 in Vietnam," and by his instructing Am-
 bassador Arthur Goldberg to communi-
 cate the matter to the members of the
 Security Council, we have shown that we
 respect the United Nations and intend
 to use it.
 What comes out of the United Na-

 willing to put into it.  I therefore hope
 and pray for a United Nations call for
 a cease-fire, for United Nations-spon-
 sored negotiations between all interested

 elections to enable the people of South
 Vietnam to decide their own future, and
 for a United Nations program of eco-

 The case for United Nations respon-
 sibility for southeast Asia was well stated
 15 years ago by then Secretary of State
 Dean Acheson in his January 12, 1950,
 speech to the National Press Club in
 Washington:
 What is the situation in regard to the
 military security of the Pacific area, and
 what is our policy in regard to it?
 In the first place, the defeat and the dis-
 armament of Japan has placed upon the
 United States the necessity of assuming the
 military defense of Japan so long as that is
 required, both in the interest of our security
 and in the interests of the security of the
 entire Pacific ? * ? "
 This defensive perimeter runs along the
 Aleutians to Japan and then goes to the
 Ryukyus.  We hold important defense posi-
 tions in the Ryukyu Islands, and those we
 will continue to hold ? ? ?.
 The defensive perimeter runs from the
 nyukyus to the Philippine Islands.  Our de-
 fensive relations with the Philippines are
 contained in agreements between us.  Those
 agreements are being loyally carried out and
 will be loyally carried out.
 So far as the military security of other
 areas in the Pacific is concerned, it must be
 clear that no person can guarantee these
 areas against military attack. * ? ? Should
 such an attack occur-one hesitates to say
 where such an armed attack could come
 from-the initial reliance must be on the
 people attacked to resist it and then upon
 the  commitments  of  the  entire  civilized

 against outside aggression.
 Those words were valid then, and they
 are valid now.
 The President's action in involving the
 United Nations is itself the best answer
 to those in high places who have been
 rasing all manner of objections to in-
 volving the United Nations.
 it is. said that the United Nations can-
 not play a useful role where the great
 powers are involved. In fact, the United
 Nations has more than once intervened
 effectively in just such a case. In 1950,
 despite the opposition of the Soviet
 Union, the defense of South Korea was
 mounted under the banner of the United
 Nations. While the Korean United Na-
 tions action escaped a Russian veto be-
 cause Russia had absented herself from
 the Secuitry Council, the possibility of
 United Nations action even had there
 been a Russian veto was assured by the

 TATE IT
 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PEP-
 PER).              Under previous order of the House,
 the gentleman from Wisconsin  [Mr.
 Rauss] is recognized for 60 minutes.
 Mr.  REUSS.  Mr.  Speaker,    I  ask
 unanimous consent that all Members
 may have 5 legislative days in which to
 extend their remarks in the body of the
 R.sCOan In connection with my remarks.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.      With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 There was no objection.
 Mr. REUSS.  Mr. Speaker, the Pres-
 ident deserves high praise for his action
 last week in invoking the United Na-
 tions in the Vietnam situation. By his
 letter to Secretary General U Thant ask-
 August 3, 1965
 Invention of the "uniting for peace" pro-
 cedure under which the General As-
 sembly can act. In the Middle East con-
 flict of 1956, a United Nations cease-fire
 was obtained against the force of the
 United Kingdom and France, which, to
 their credit, respected the cease-fire. In
 the Congo and Cyprus, the United Na-
 tions played a role where the great powers
 were indirectly involved.  Great powers
 as well as small are likewise not exempt
 from the United Nations writ in Vietnam.
 It is said that there is no role for the
 United Nations in Vietnam because North
 Vietnam and Communist China have re-
 jected and ridiculed a United Nations
 role. Their objection is as irrelevant as
 the unheeded objection of North Korea
 to United Nations action in 1950.  Cer-
 tainly it was never intended that the ag-
 gressor should decide whether he would
 be subject to United Nations peacekeep-
 ing action.
 Equally, it is irrelevant that North
 Vietnam and Communist China are not
 members of the United Nations. Article
 II of the U.N. Charter expressly states:
 The organization shall insure that states
 which are not members act in accordance
 with United Nations principles.
 It is said that our invoking the United
 Nations will be taken as a sign of weak-
 ness by our adversaries, and as a har-
 binger of American withdrawal.  But
 President Johnson's signals are hardly
 those of weakness; and the evidence so
 far certainly points to no misapprehen-
 sion by North Vietnam and Communist
 China on this score.
 It is said that our invocation of the
 United Nations would lead to acrimoni-
 ous debate in. the Security Council and
 the General Assembly on the U.S. posi-
 tion.                                                                                          But such debate, in and out of
 the United Nations, is sure to occur any-
 way.                                                                                          It will have infinitely less founda-
 tion if we show our respect for article I
 of the United Nations Charter, which de-
 fines its purpose as "to maintain inter-
 liational peace and security, and to that
 end to take effective collective measures
 for the prevention  and removal of
 threats to the peace."
 It is said that invocation of the United
 Nations would force the Soviet Union
 into the arms of Communist China, and
 heal the breach caused by differing views
 of violent takeovers by "wars of libera-
 tion"  The Soviet Union in any event
 faces the dilemma posed by conflicting
 desires: On the one hand, to avoid
 heightened danger of conflict with the
 United States and, on the other hand,
 to show itself the champion of world
 communism.
 If the Soviet Union is not going to in-
 tervene militarily against us in Vietnam
 without our going to the United Nations,
 I cannot see her intervening militarily if
 we do go to the United Nations with a
 set of peace aims that are Instinct with
 Justice for all the world to see.  No one
 can tell whether the Soviet Union will op-
 pose, or veto, formal United Nations ac-
 tion, if it comes to that.  But if there is
 a Soviet veto, there is then the General
 Assembly, under the uniting-for-peace
 procedure.

 August 3, 1965           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 It is said, finally, that if all other
 United Nations procedures of mediation,
 arbitration, and recommendation are ex-
 hausted, and the matter then comes be-
 fore the General Assembly, the General
 Assembly may decline to take action or
 vote it down.  I do not for a moment
 concede the point: if we will now move
 -to rehabilitate the United Nations, I am
 confident that the requisite majority of
 the General Assembly would take a stand
 for peace and for the independence of
 small nations.  But even if the United
 Nations should in the end shirk its re-
 sponsibility, we shall at least have shown
 our dedication to the United Nations and
 our willingness to abide by our commit-
 ments under the Charter.
 But as a matter of the first urgency,
 we must overcome the present paralysis
 in the United Nations caused by the
 year-old dispute about the financing of
 prior United Nations peacekeeping oper-
 ations in the Middle East and in the
 Congo.  The Soviet Union and France
 are both more than 2 years in arrears in
 paying their assessments on peacekeep-
 ing forces which they opposed.  Under
 the letter of article 19, they are thus sub-
 ject to the loss of their votes in the Gen-
 eral Assembly.  Last August the Con-
 gress, with administration encourage-
 ment, passed a concurrent resolution
 calling on the permanent U.S. delegate
 to the United Nations to "make every ef-
 fort to assure invocation or-article 19.
 The Soviet Union threatened to with-
 ,draw if denied its vote, and there was a
 ,good chance that France would do like-
 wise.  The result was that the last ses-
 sion of the General Assembly ended in
 paralysis, with no votes allowed to be
 .ken.
 The confrontation in the United Na-
 tions stemming from our concurrent res-
 .olution of last summer, if it is still in ef-
 fect when the General Assembly con-
 venes next month, will result either in
 our defeat or in the withdrawal of the
 Soviet Union and France from the world
 organization.  For that reason, I intro-
 duced last April House Concurrent Reso-
 lution 386, which will permit our perma-
 nent delegate to the United Nations flex-
 ibility in handling the article 19 prob-
 lem, and not compel him to torpedo the
 United Nations when it meets.  For the
 future, we should support the proposi-
 tion that General Assembly peacekeep-
 ing operations be financed by voluntary
 contributions.  For the past, the United
 States, while remaining zealous to in-
 voke article 19 against the countries in
 arrears Zia their regular United Nations
 dues, should not press article 19 on the
 Middle East and Congo special assess-
 ments.
 Congress has just a few weeks to act
 before September is upon us. I hope
 that the State Department will act upon
 House Concurrent Resolution 386, or
 some similar resolution, to end the
 United  Nations  impasse.  When  the
 United Nations is revivified, it will be able
 to play a meaningful role in bringing
 peace to Vietnam.
 Of one. thing I am sure-that the
 American people wholeheartedly support
 a United Nations role in Vietnam.  In
 an opinion poll conducted in Milwaukee
 by the Milwaukee Sentinel, and reported
 in the Sentinel for August 2, 1965, 70
 percent of those asked, "Do you feel it
 is time for the United Nations to step
 in to find ways to halt this aggression
 and bring peace to Vietnam?" answered
 "Yes;" 7 percent said "No,". with 18 per-
 cent saying "Don't know," and 5 percent
 not answering.  I include the Milwaukee
 Sentinel story:
 POLL FINDS SUPPORT FOR L.B.J.-U.S. BUILD-
 UP  IN VIETNAM BACKED
 (By C. Brooks Smeeton)
 The majority of Milwaukee area residents
 support President Johnson's commitment to
 a stepped up role for the United States in
 the Vietnam war.
 This Is despite the fact that almost one-
 half                                                                             of  those  polled  feel  the  President's
 decision to double the draft call and to in-
 crease the U.S. fighting strength is risking
 a major war with Red China.
 More than 6 out of 10 persons agree with
 President  Johnson's order to   double  the
 monthly draft calls from 17,000 to 35,000
 and to send 50,000 more men to South Viet-
 nam.
 This compares with only about  1  in 5
 (19 percent) who disagree with the idea, or
 (18 percent) who don't know.
 One hundred persons were interviewed by
 telephone for the Sentinel by the research
 department of the Journal Co.   Of those
 who participated in the poll, 59 percent were
 women and 41 percent were men.
 Interviewers asked individuals throughout
 the metropolitan Milwaukee area for their
 opinions about the statement last Wednes-
 day on Vietnam by President Johnson.
 Almost half-47 percent-said that they
 read about it in the newspaper while almost
 one-third-28   percent-listened   to   or
 watched the speech on radio or television.
 The results revealed that 40 percent agree
 that  this  action  on  the  part of  the
 United States will bring peace eventually.
 Twenty percent were in disagreement; 35
 percent replied they didn't know and 5 per-
 cent did not answer.
 .,If we didn't do it now it would lead to
 total war," said Howard Bruchkauser, 2709
 East Whitaker Avenue, St. Francis.
 Also in agreement was Thomas K. Ander-
 son,  3455  South  104th  Street,  Greenfield.
 He said, "I like the forwardness in the Pres-
 ident's stand.  It's time we show them that
 we mean business and we will fight to pro-
 tect our freedom."
 Waiter Waech, 4853 North 66th Street,
 indicated he felt the same way when he re-
 plied, "It's the old Teddy Roosevelt theory
 of 'carry a big stick.'  We've been horsing
 around too long."
 SAME AS KOREA
 There were some who disagreed.  In the
 opinion of John H. Ebbe, 3234 South 82d
 Street, "It's the same as Korea-fighting to
 establish a status quo."
 Forty-eight percent of those polled felt
 the action by the United States is risking a
 major war with Red China.  Twenty-nine
 percent said they did not think so, while 19
 percent said they didn't know.
 The women (almost 50 percent) were more
 apprehensive than the men  (46 percent)
 about the-possibility of this country getting
 into a war with Communist China.
 Seven out of ten of the participants in the
 survey said that it was time for the United
 Nations to step in to find ways to halt this
 aggression and bring peace to Vietnam.
 Among those who felt this was Eldon Zich,
 16032 Riviera Drive, New Berlin, who said,
 "I've felt that way for a long time.  It's the
 job for the U.N.  They should have tried to
 keep peace."
 18573
 EASIER THAN FORCE
 John Kailas, 2574 South 35th Street, said,
 "I believe in the U.N. They can settle prob-
 lems easier than brute force."
 Donald Weber,  5856  North  61st Street,
 said, "It's part of United Nations business
 to do this.  They have made no noticeable
 effort as yet."
 Oscar Murphy,  Jr.,  2958-A North  12th
 Street, said, "The United States got them-
 salves into it, so they should get themselves
 Cut."
 William  Anderson,   3702  West  Sarnow
 Street, said, "I am negative on United Na-
 tions.  They don't have too much to say.
 They're too far to the left."
 Mrs. Ray Wotta, 2545 South 66th Street,
 said, "The United Nations will never settle
 anything."
 Here are the Sentinel poll questions and
 the results:
 "Did you happen to listen or watch Presi-
 dent  Johnson's  speech  Wednesday                                                                                                                                             on

 Mr. COHELAN.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. REUSS.  I will be delighted to
 yield to the gentleman from California.
 Mr. COHELAN.  I want to congratu-
 late the gentleman for the very impor-
 tant statement he is making to the House
 this afternoon. I should like to associate
 myself with his remarks.
 I was personally very pleased that the
 President in his press conference last
 Wednesday stated that he had sent Am-
 bassador Goldberg with a special mes-
 sage to Secretary General U Thant urg-
 ing him to make full use of the resources
 of the U.N. in bringing the war from
 the battlefield to the conference table.
 I have been urging that this be done for

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           August 3, 1965
 some months now. I also have been en-
 couraging every official of our admin-
 istration with whom I have talked to
 make every effort to include the United
 Nations in every step and that it be en-
 couraged to play a larger role in this
 effort.
 However, my question to the gentle-
 man at this point, in light of some of
 the comments he has made about the
 prospects of the United Nations perhaps
 being turned down, is that I notice in
 the United Press International dispatch
 this morning that North Vietnam has
 ruled out any United Nations role in
 bringing the war to the conference table
 or for any international settlement.  So
 I ask the gentleman, Do you really think
 it is possible we can get the other party
 to the conference table or to the United
 Nations in light of what they have had
 to say?
 Mr. REUSS.  Yes.  Hanoi in the past
 has shown its contempt for the United
 Nations, and it has done so again in
 the last 24 hours. However, I remind the
 gentleman that the United Nations Char-
 ter, article 2, expressly states, and I
 quote :
 The organization shall insure that States
 which are not members act in accordance
 with United Nations principles.
 So the mere fact that North Vietnam
 resists United Nations action, and is not
 a member of the United Nations, is
 irrelevant.
 Equally in 1950, North Korea resisted
 the U.N. action and was not a member of
 the U.N. Yet that did not stop the U.N.
 from assuming what I think,history will
 regard as an important role in damping
 down that threat to world peace. I do
 not want to minimize the difficulties of
 the situation, but I do not think that
 the intransigence of North Vietnam offers
 the slightest excuse for the U.N. to
 shirk its responsibilities.
 Mr. COHELAN. If the gentleman will
 yield further, did I understand him clear-
 ly in respect to the parties with whom
 we should negotiate?  Do I understand
 that the gentleman includes any and all
 parties that might properly be associated
 with an honorable settlement?  By this
 I mean the National Liberation Front,
 the Vietcong, or any other party, that
 may be present and available to negoti-
 ate. , Is that not correct?
 Mr. REUSS.  Yes.  I said all parties
 and I mean all parties, including those
 who are now most responsible for carry-
 ing on the conflict, that is, the Vietcong.
 President Johnson in his press confer-
 ence of last week indicated if the North
 Vietnamese wished to bring along the
 Vietcong or the National Liberation
 Front to negotiations, that would be ac-
 ceptable, and that statement speaks for
 itself.  Speaking for myself, I would
 think we have to negotiate with whom-
 ever our opponents are, and we can leave
 juridical `considerations as to whether a
 group of people is a government or not to
 one side.  They are the people who are
 firing at us, and they will have to be
 Mr. COHELAN.  Now, if the gentle-
 man will yield further at this point on
 just one other matter before he com-
 pletes his comprehensive statement.
 As the gentleman well knows from our
 own discussions, from discussions with
 very distinguished colleagues of ours in-
 cluding the gentleman from New York
 [Mr. BINGHAM] who at one time was a
 delegate to the United Nations, and with
 members of the administration, there has
 been concern expressed about us going to
 the United Nations at this point and pos-
 sibly causing some embarrassment, par-
 ticularly in relation to article 19.
 Now I realize the gentleman has com-
 mented on article 19, and we have to do
 something about this.  But I wonder if
 he would concentrate on the question of
 the reservations that are entertained by
 some of our colleagues who are equally
 anxious to bring the United Nations
 pressure to bear in this terrible situation
 in southeast Asia.
 Mr. REUSS.  I thank the gentleman
 for asking that question.  I would say
 two things in reply to him.
 First, as to the tactics and timing of
 our United Nations invocation, on which
 we are now happily embarked, I believe
 that the tactics and timing must very
 much be left to those who are directly
 in charge of the day-to-day conduct of
 our foreign policy.  Thus I do not call
 this afternoon for any particular resolu-
 tion to be presented before any particu-
 lar body of the United Nations at any
 particular time.  It may well be that the
 initial step taken, of having Ambassador
 Goldberg simply lodge the matter in-
 formally before the 11 members of the
 Security Council, is a good initial pro-
 ceeding.  I well recognize that to take
 a frozen formal position at the outset
 might not be the most productive way to
 proceed. So my first answer to the
 gentleman's question is that the import-
 ant thing is that we are now before the
 United Nations.  We are not any longer
 being disrespectful of It by refusing to
 come before the United Nations.  And
 this I consider half or two-thirds of the
 battle.
 I would hope that our timing and
 tactics will prove fruitful in the days and
 weeks and months to come.
 The second point I would make has to
 do with article 19; and that is that what-
 ever we do with the United Nations is
 totally dependent upon our putting the
 United Nations back on its feet again.
 It is now in a state of paralysis owing to
 the assessments dispute, and we must
 move fast to see that some sort of a work-
 able compromise can be arrived at on
 that, so that the United Nations when it
 meets in New York next month may be
 once again a going Institution.
 I point out to the gentleman that this
 will require action by the U.S. Congress,
 because the Congress has presently sad-
 dled our permanent representative at the
 United Nations with a rather inflexible
 resolution which in effect requires that
 on opening day of the new General As-
 sembly, he has got to challenge the right
 of France and of the Soviet Union to vote.,
 and both countries, if that challenge were
 upheld, would be highly likely to leave
 the United Nations and thus start the
 tragic course toward a repetition of the
 last days of the ill-fated League of
 Nations.
 Therefore, it is in my judgment vital
 that the State Department and Congress
 move within the next few weeks, prefer-
 ably the next few days, to clarify our
 directive of last summer which was made
 in good faith-I voted for it, and so, I be-
 lieve, did the gentleman from California,
 with all other Members-but, in effect,
 our confrontation strategy of last year
 regrettably did not work, and we are
 now confronted with a larger question of
 whether we wish the United Nations to
 continue.
 I believe the American people want the
 United Nations to continue.  In a poll
 conducted in my own community of Mil-
 waukee over the weekend by the Mil-
 waukee Sentinel, 70 percent of the per-
 sons queried on whether they wished the
 U.N. participation in Vietnam said yes,
 they did; only 7 percent said no; 18 per-
 cent said they did not know, and 5 per-
 cent did not answer.
 So that I think the American people
 share the faith of the gentleman from
 California and myself and so many other
 Members that the United Nations does
 have an inspiring role to play in world
 peace if only we will do our part in put-
 ting iton its feet again.
 Mr. COHELAN.  I thank the gentle-
 man for amplifying this point, and again
 I want to express my complete agreement
 with what he has had to say.
 I shall have further questions of the
 gentleman as the gentleman proceeds.
 Mr. REUSS.  Mr. Speaker, because of
 the lateness of the hour I am going to
 exercise my permission to insert mate-
 rials in the RECORD  and conclude my
 formal remarks by expressing the deep
 hope that the State Department will
 shortly act on the question of the U.N.
 impasse, that it will give a favorable
 report on the resolution which I intro-
 duced last April to give our representa-
 tive, Ambassador Goldberg, more flexibil-
 ity on the article 19 question or perhaps
 come up with some similar resolution, so
 that the United Nations may be revivified
 and thus able to play a meaningful role
 in bringing peace to Vietnam.
 Mr. FRASER.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. REUSS.  I yield to my colleague
 from Minnesota.              -
 Mr. FRASER.  Mr. Speaker, I want to
 commend the gentleman from Wisconsin
 for his timely discussion of a most urgent
 question, a question which is of vital con-
 cern to the security of our Nation as well
 as to the future of the world.
 Particularly, Mr. Speaker, I feel it is
 worth noting the point which the gentle-
 man has developed, which is that before
 we can return to the United Nations for
 assistance in settling the Vietnam prob-
 lem, we must first work out the problems
 that have kept the General Assembly
 from functioning over the past year.
 Because most of the small nations do not
 want to see in the General Assembly a
 confrontation between the United States,
 the Soviet Union, and France on the
 question of paying these assessments for
 the peacekeeping costs, we are going to
 have to recognize this as a reality and
 proceed to find other ways to move ahead
 so that the General Assembly can con-
 tinue to act and function in dealing with
 problems around the world.

 August 3, 1965           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 I might say, if the gentleman will yield
 further for a moment, that there is one
 point  that I believe the gentleman
 touched upon with which I surely concur.
 That is. the. argument that by taking the
 issue of Vietnam,. to the Security Council,
 we would. force the Soviet Union into a
 position of representing North Vietnam
 thereby committing the Soviet Union to
 a firmer and harder line than that to
 which it is presently committed.
 It seems to me that while this ques-
 tion or consideration once had validity,
 today we find the Soviet Union furnish-
 ing not only economic aid but substan-
 tial military assistance, including sur-
 face-to-air missiles for North Vietnam,
 and warning our Government about the
 grave risks that we face in our course of
 conduct over there and demanding the
 withdrawal of ,American forces from
 South Vietnam.
 It would seem to me that it would be
 hard to get the Soviet Union more deeply
 committed to a defensive posture on be-
 half of North Vietnam than that to which
 it is already committed as a result of its
 common Interest with North Vietnam as
 a member of ' the Communist group of
 nations.
 I. do not know if the gentleman from
 Wisconsin has. pursued that point to the
 degree that we have discussed earlier,
 but I do believe that this consideration
 which, as I say, once had validity, no
 longer does have the validity that it may
 have had in the earlier months.
 9.  I agree with the gentle-
 Mr. REUSE
 man_ from Minnesota that while the
 question of the involvement of the Soviet
 Union in the question of a U.N. presence
 in South Vietnam is a serious one, it
 deserves a fair discussion..
 I believe, on balance, that the case is
 overwhelmingly In favor of going to the
 U.N., and letting. the chips fall where
 they may.  The Soviet Union has al-
 ready found it necessary, because of its
 position in the Communist world, to take
 very considerable steps to align itself
 with North Vietnam.
 I do not see how that alinement is go-
 inng to become any worse by reason or our
 conceived and stated American case can
 attract the majority of votes.
 Mr. FRASER.  There is another con-
 sideration which might be worth de-
 veloping. In the earlier years many peo-
 ple had in mind asking the United
 Nations to declare the actions on the
 part of North Vietnam to be acts of
 aggression and calling upon the United
 Nations for support in meeting that ag-
 gression.  It is true we could go to the
 United Nations today and ask the Se-
 curity Council or the General Assembly
 to declare that aggression is being waged
 by North Vietnam and call on them for
 help. That is one course of action that
 is open, but it seems to me in light of
 recent developments and in the changing
 complexities of the situation we are more
 likely to urge the United Nations to take
 a peace-seeking role.
 Mr. REUSS. Rather than in a police
 force role?
 Mr. FRASER. Yes. Leaving aside the
 question of aggression, you could go to
 the Security Council or to the General
 Assembly and seek through their offices
 to find a resolution to this conflict.  In
 such a case the Soviet Union would not
 find itself pressed to defend North Viet-
 nam and thereby become more deeply
 committed as some fear. What has been
 established since the United Nations has
 been in business is that they will recog-
 nize overt aggression and will act to meet
 such aggression. That was demonstrated
 In the case of Korea, although it is true
 Russia was not in the Security Council
 at that time; nevertheless, the other
 nations all recognized North Korea was
 invading South Korea, and they did au-
 thorize a United Nations force to take
 action in support of South Korea.
 But here we have a war in which there
 are arguments about the nature of the
 war.  Some call it a civil war just as we
 had a civil war between the North and
 South here in the United States.  Others
 say the moral issues are obscured be-
 cause the United States did not support
 the elections provided under the Geneva
 agreement.  There are moral questions

 box with a referendum or by an election
 of some kind, this would be consistent
 with the highest purposes of the United
 Nations.  It would be consistent with
 the spirit of the small now nations for
 which self-determination stands as per-
 haps the highest political principle of any
 that are abroad in the world today.
 Before I ask the gentleman to com-
 ment on this, I might mention a proposal
 that the President could make.  This is
 only  for  illustrative  purposes.  He
 might say, for example, to the United
 Nations that we are prepared to support
 a United Nations sponsored referendum
 in South Vietnam on the question of the
 political leadership that the people de-
 sire-with the questions to be framed
 under United Nations jurisdiction.
 Further, he could suggest that a. cease-
 fire take place in South Vietnam so that
 the United Nations representatives would
 have access to all of South Vietnam in
 carrying out such an election.
 Third, he could say that if these steps
 are agreed upon, and this would involve,
 I. think, a direct contact by the United
 Nations with the Vietcong or with the
 national liberation front, if those steps
 could be agreed upon, then of course we
 would suspend bombing in the North
 and agree to abide by the outcome of
 the election, as we would expect all other
 nations to do.
 Now I recognize the many problems
 that exist in this proposal.  I recognize
 that the United Nations really has not
 done this before.  But necessity is the
 mother of invention and if there should
 be some willingness to proceed to allow
 the people of South Vietnam, who are the
 people whose interests are ultimately at
 stake, to make a decision by going to the
 ballot box-if we could move in that
 direction through the United Nations, it
 seems to me this would clearly put us
 square with the world and our own con-
 science and the highest principles of
 American democracy.
 Mr. REUSS.  The gentleman, as he
 always does, 'has made good sense. I
 think his proposal is a sound one.
 I would add that. it is in no way in-
 consistent with the observations of Presi-
 dent Johnson at his press conference last
 week. Indeed, it simply carries out and
 makes a little more definite what was
 said there by the President.
 The gentleman has well said that,
 while these things have not been done
 in exactly this way by the United Nations
 before, the fact is the United Nations
 Charter, like the great Constitution of
 this country and like the British Com-
 mon-Law Constitution, is capable of in-
 finite adjustment, within its four corners,
 to the turn of events.
 Specifically, I think a combination of a
 United Nations directed cease-fire which
 of course, would operate on our bombers
 and would operate on the Vietcong and
 on North Vietnam and on the Saigon
 ns sponsored-negotiations for United
 Natio                         arid`the
 suggestion, which I think is perhaps the
 most important of all, for United Na-

 nam-this is the essence of a proposal

 our Government, and I think we are

 reaching in that direction now, will ap-
 peal to the sense of justice of people the
 world over.  After all, that is our only
 refuge and strength.  I think the gen-
 tleman has made a real contribution.
 Mr. COHELAN. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. REUSS. I yield to the gentleman
 from California.
 Mr. COHELAN.  The gentleman has
 cataloged the points that are important
 in any kind of United Nations proposal
 which would lead to free election ma-
 chinery to determine the future of Viet-
 nam and/or of South Vietnam.
 My question at this point relates to
 the machinery. While it is true that we
 could organize elections, I think it is
 pretty clear one of the reasons we failed
 to sign the Geneva accords in 1954 was
 because we could not get U.N. guaran-
 teed and supervised elections.
 My question to the gentleman is:
 What do we propose?  What can we pro-
 pose?  What techniques and methods
 will be suggested or can be suggested to
 arrange for the  peacekeeping costs?
 Obviously, if there is a cease fire it is
 highly desirable to have an enforcible
 ceasefire under U.N. supervision. Given
 some of the difficulties of which we are
 all aware, what does the gentleman en-
 vision as the means for sorting this one
 out?
 Mr. REUSS. Of course, the costs of a
 United Nations-supervised election would
 be negligible and could be borne out of
 regular United 'Nations dues, and there
 would be no problem, because there has
 been no disposition on the part of mem-
 bers generally to refuse to pay their dues.
 If, however, a United Nations peace-
 keeping presence of. some sort may be
 necessary,  a  United  Nations  police
 force-bear in.mind that in my colloquy
 with the gentleman from Minnesota just
 a moment ago I agreed that there were
 other U.N. functions and operations
 which seemed to be more significant right
 now-in Vietnam or anywhere else in the
 world, I should think in the future, to
 the extent that the General Assembly of
 the United Nations set up a police force,
 the financing should be done on a volun-
 tary basis, just as a world organization
 like the International Development As-
 sociation, before it makes up a consor-
 tium, goes to the various members and
 says, "How much can we put you down
 for?"  If the member says, "Nothing on
 this one," the IDA secretary says, "Fine,
 we will put you down for nothing."
 So, with respect to future General As-
 sembly peacekeeping forces, because of
 their exacerbating nature on some of the
 members, it would not hurt to make their
 financing voluntary.
 If it be said that then the United States
 may in a given case bear the lion's share
 of the burden, I would answer by saying,
 first, only if the United States agreed,
 and, second, how much better it would be
 if we were today bearing the lion's share
 and more than the lion's share of the
 burden in South Vietnam under the ban-
 ner of the United Nations, and with the
 help of numerous other members of the
 United Nations. How much ahead, both
 financially and morally, we would be.
 I believe, in answer to the question of
 the gentleman from California, there are
 ways of working out even expensive
 peacekeeping forces without wrenching
 the United Nations apart.
 Mr. COHELAN.  I thank the gentle-
 man.
 Mr. FRASER.   Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. REUSS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Minnesota.
 Mr. FRASER. I was interested in the
 question of the gentleman from Cali-
 fornia and the response by the gentle-
 man from Wisconsin.
 There is an additional procedure which
 could be followed by the United Nations
 which would also, I believe, provide addi-
 tional flexibility.  I refer to creating a
 peacekeeping fund in advance, in a pre-
 determined amount-it might be $500
 million  or  some other  figure-which
 would have the value of insulating a par-
 ticular peacekeeping operation from the
 request for support of that fund. One
 cannot insulate it entirely, and it may
 depend on the magnitude of the peace-
 keeping operation.
 I might say that one of the objections
 raised to the idea of having a peace-
 keeping fund established in advance is
 the possibility that the smaller nations,
 who control the General Assembly, might
 undertake to go off on their own and
 initiate some kind of action which we
 would not feel was in the interest of the
 United States.  I mention this because
 it is a common objection. On that point,
 it seems to me we have so many other
 things to fear which are more real and
 more immediate that such a remote con-
 tingency could not seriously impair our
 national security.  I believe we should
 look at the possibility of establishing
 such a fund as one of the possible ways
 to provide the United Nations with the
 flexibility which I very strongly feel it
 needs.
 Mr. REUSS.  I would certainly agree
 that this is an idea worth exploring. If
 it ever could be achieved, it would be a
 most helpful addition to the United Na-
 tions arsenal of peaceful weapons.
 I return, however, to my theme, which
 is that immediately we are confronted
 with the stubborn fact that the U.N. has
 fallen apart and that our most imme-
 diate urgent task is to move heaven and
 earth to put it back together again.
 There is no reason under the sun why
 in about 5 weeks from now the United
 Nations cannot be on its feet, financially
 sound once again, with hope for the fu-
 ture and, I would think, with the grati-
 tude ringing in our ears of about 80 small
 nations for the initiative of the United
 States in trying to put the United Na-
 tions back on its feet, if we will but do
 what has to be done in the Halls of Con-
 gress, and in the executive branch in the
 3 or 4 vital weeks to come.
 Mr.  EDWARDS of California.   Mr.
 speaker, I always listen carefully to our
 distinguished colleague from Wisconsin
 [Mr. Rsuss]. He is truly one of the out-
 standing scholars in the Congress and
 a thoughtful and knowledgable interna-
 tionalist.  I read with appreciation his
 recent article on the U.N. in Common-
 weal magazine.  I compliment the gen-
 tleman from Wisconsin on his continu-
 ing efforts in support of the U.N. and
 thank him for taking this time today to
 discuss the U.N. and its vital place in
 this modern world.
 Mr. Speaker, I emphatically deny that
 fate decrees that wars are inevitable.  As
 Schopenhauer said, what people com-
 monly call fate is, as a general rule, noth-
 ing but their own stupid and foolish con-
 duct, and if wickedness is atoned for in
 another world, stupidity gets its reward
 here.
 I am convinced that there is a proper
 and well defined path we can and must
 take in our foreign policy. I say that the
 ground rules are existing and have been
 enumerated by wise leaders, living and
 dead. Sir Isaac Newton said:
 If I have seen farther than other men it
 is because I have stood on the shoulders of
 giants.
 I ask only that we stand open eyed, on
 the shoulders of our giants.
 I suppose that I realized that the day
 of world wars was over and done with
 on August 6, 1945, when our aircraft
 dropped the first atomic bomb and in a
 few seconds leveled a great city and
 killed 77,000 people.
 You will recall that this was a few
 months after the Germans had started
 using the V-2 rocket, which was fired
 from hidden sites, which flew so fast
 that the sound of the missile did not
 catch up until after the explosion.
 It seemed apparent on that day that
 substitutes would have to be found for
 warfare, that it would not be too many
 years before any reasonably modern na-
 tion could construct both the missiles and
 the nuclear warheads capable of destroy-
 ing any other country or combination of
 countries. Any new Tojo, Hitler, Kaiser,
 Napoleon, or Genghis Khan now had the
 means of pulling down the rest of the
 world, whether in revenge or in a frenzy
 of paranoia.
 Today we have enough atomic bombs
 to kill every Russian over 1,000 times,
 and they in turn can do the same to
 us.
 It does not matter who strikes first.
 The bombs and the means of transmit-
 tal are hidden in hardened sites or on
 submarines which cannot be found, and
 the nation first attacked will always have
 sufficient missiles left to destroy the
 enemy.
 For, a few short years only ourselves
 and the Russians were atomic nations.
 It was our hope that there would be
 no further proliferation.  We resembled
 the trustees of the church in southern
 California upon whose property oil was
 discovered.  The next day the trustees
 announced that no more new members
 would be accepted.
 But today we find 10, perhaps 15, oth-
 er nations with actual or potential nu-
 clear arsenals.  France, whose force de
 frappe military experts sniffed at not
 many months ago, has an operational
 force of 36 Mirage supersonic bombers
 armed with atomic bombs each with an
 explosive force of 60 kilotons, or 4 times
 the Hiroshima bomb. The French force
 will soon be double this size, and mili-
 tary experts say that more than 50 per-
 cent would reach their targets.
 China has now exploded two atom
 bombs.  Those who assume that China
 will have no missile delivery system
 would do well to remember that the Chi-

 nations such as West Germany and          war is not inevitable-that mankind is
 Japan could join the atomic club in 2
 years.  Other nations that have the in-
 dustrial and scientific capabilities in-
 clude Italy, Israel, India, Pakistan, the
 United Arab Republic, and Indonesia.
 We would consider it Imbecilic for a
 city to attempt to exist without govern-
 ment-as' an anarchy-without commu-
 nity rules. restricting the violent be-
 havior of its citizens.  But the nations
 in the world today have no effective gov-
 ernment or rules of law limiting their
 sovereignty.  The sovereign state as-
 sumes the right to take any action to
 serve what it considers its vital interests
 and to judge the appropriateness of its
 acts, no matter how serious the con-
 sequences to others.
 This system never has worked-it can-
 not work.  "'T'here is' no greater fiend
 than. anarchy," said Sophocles.  "She
 ruins states, turns houses out of doors."
 In my lifetime alone, international an-
 archy has resulted in two world wars,
 in the violent deaths of a hundred mil-
 lion people, in hunger and poverty for
 two-thirds of the world's population,
 and in a breakdown of governments per-
 rititting Communist rule over half the
 world's population.
 Even in the brief periods between wars,
 the preparations for the next conflict so
 Impoverish the world community eco-
 nomically .and spiritually, that long-
 rangesuCe`essin the development of the
 underdeveloped nations is impossible.
 World expenditures for armaments per
 year total over $120 billions, of which the
 United States spends 42 percent. In late
 May it was announced that our Nation
 .has the doubtful honor of being the big-
 gest arms merchant in the world, with
 sales of $1.5 billion this year and a spe-
 cial arms sales promotion program in
 Western Europe costing $500,000 a year.
 With the nnations of the world spending
 $120 billion per year on arms, it is clear
 that there is not enough money left over
 for aid to the underdeveloped countries:
 As Grenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn
 have pointed out, there must be an an-
 nuaI flow of capital from the industrial-
 ized nations to the low-income countries
 of not less than $50 billion per year-or
 $25 per capita. The current. flow of $8.55
 billion is only one-sixth of what is re-
 ,quired to make a ny real impression on
 the problem.
 Unless the developed nations allocate
 this larger sum of capital to the low-
 income nations, we should not be sur-
 prised if they develop monolithic eco-
 nomic and political systems. Communist
 revolutions are not caused by the Com-
 munist. ,doctrine, 'they are caused by
 disease and the lack of the decencies of
 life.  These revolutions will continue
 even if communism evaporates.
 It was 2 years and 2 months ago that
 President Kennedy made his immortal
 speeclz,on"world peace at American Uni-
 varsity here in'Washington.  It seemed
 .to mat that time, and I have not since
 changed my mind, that his words sig-
 nified-a,-now direction in American for-
 not doomed-that we are not gripped by
 forces we cannot control.
 He said:
 Our problems are man made---therefore,
 they can be solved by man.  And man can
 be as big as he wants.
 That:
 World peace, like community peace, does
 not require that each man love his neigh-
 bor-it requires only that they live together
 in mutual tolerance, submitting their dis-
 putes to a just and peaceful settlement.
 President Kennedy said:
 We seek to strengthen the United Nations
 * * * to develop it into a genuine world se-
 curity system-a system capable of resolving
 disputes on the basis of law * * * and of
 creating conditions under which arms can be
 finally abolished.
 You will recall that within a few short
 weeks the Soviet Union and our country
 had signed the test ban treaty, outlawing
 atmospheric atomic testing.  At the time
 of his death we appeared to be close to
 an extension of the treaty to include
 underground explosions. President Ken-
 nedy had traveled to England, Ireland,
 and to Europe.  He was looked upon as
 the leader who might fulfill Tennyson's
 dream of a time "when all men's good be
 each man's .rule, and universal peace lie
 like a shaft of light across the land."
 It' seems to me that our commitment
 to build world law and order is being
 weakened by our actions.  We appear to
 be. disassociating ourselves from a for-
 eign policy who se matrix is` the U.N. and
 instead giving increasing importance to
 unilateral power politics.
 I say that this course can only lead to
 disaster-that man's only hope for world
 peace is through constant honest efforts
 toward  world  organization-that  we
 cannot say it won't work until we have
 tried-and that our `attempts to date
 have been timid and "unenthusiastic.
 It is my position that support of the
 U.N. must be the core of our foreign
 policy.  I believe that the United States
 can lead its sister states on the road to
 a world community where disputes are
 settled not by war but by conciliation and
 arbitration.
 Where the United Nations has been al-
 lowed by its members to operate, its suc-
 cesses have been solid and satisfying.
 International cooperation has been the
 rule in the World Health Organization,
 UNICEF, UNESCO, the Food and Agri-
 cultural  Organization,  the  Monetary
 Fund, the World Bank, GATT, the ex-
 panded program of technical assist-
 ance, and many more.
 The first and primary purpose, how-
 ever, of the United Nations is to main-
 tain international peace and security.
 The charter specifically requires that
 member States shall use no force except
 in self-defense-that the use of self-de-
 fense must be reported to the Security
 Council, and that members must settle
 their disputes peacefully.
 The charter contemplates that na-
 tions in dispute shall first seek a solution
 through peaceful means of their own
 choosing.  Then, if a solution is not
 eign policy.
 18577
 found, the dispute must be referred to
 the U.N. before it erupts into war.
 In its first few years considerable re-
 spect was paid to this commitment. Rus-
 sia withdrew its troops from Iran and
 France hers from Syria to avoid charges
 of charter violation.  The U.N. helped
 restore peace in Greece, Kashmir, and
 Korea. In Israel peace was maintained
 when the state was first established and
 again during the Suez crisis.
 But this pattern of generally respon-
 sible conduct has degenerated during the
 past decade into the practice of nations
 taking the law into their own hands and
 using force without first submitting the
 case to the U.N. There was Britain and
 France in Suez, India in Goa, Russia in
 Hungary, the United States in Vietnam.
 It might possibly be argued that the
 use of force would be legitimate where a
 member in good faith first seeks assist-
 ance through the U.N. and fails to re-
 ceive it. There is no excuse for by-pass-
 ing the U.N.
 More and more we have been reversing
 the proper order of conduct in interna-
 tional affairs.  Our charter obligation is
 to first submit the dispute to the interna-
 tional governmental authority and only
 thereafter back up its decision with force.
 There is no authority to move militarily
 first, seeking conciliation later.
 In recent years it is said more and
 more that the charter does not forbid
 one nation from helping another quell a
 rebellion.  This is certainly an imagina-
 tive  but                                                                                                     unsupportable  conclusion.
 There is no authority in the charter for
 one nation to intervene militarily in an-
 other country whether there exists a
 civil war, a war of liberation, or a war
 in the defense of freedom.
 No state has the right to intervene in
 another state's civil war.  If the civil
 war constitutes a threat to international
 peace, then the U.N. may intervene to
 deal with this threat.
 There is nothing in the charter to
 justify the great powers or the small
 powers rejecting or ignoring conciliation,
 mediation  or  the  other  peacekeeping
 processes of the U.N.  The law of the
 charter, its very heart, outlaws force as
 a method for settling disputes.
 Nor are military alliances a substitute
 for the treaty obligations of the U.N.
 Charter.  NATO provides no machinery
 or means for settling disputes, except
 the use of force, or the threat of force.
 We have seen from NATO no arms con-
 trol proposals.  Indeed, NATO histori-
 cally has looked with a jaundiced eye
 on any plans for disengagement, dis-
 armament or the establishment of arms-
 free areas in Europe.
 I am not saying that there is a single
 path to peace and that it consists of a
 more faithful adhereance to the rules of
 the charter,  There still would remain
 many intractable problems requiring ad-
 ditional remedies.  The U.N. must, of
 course, be open to every nation inclUd-
 ing China.                                                                                                     There must be giant steps
 toward disarmament and the formation
 of an international police force.  The
 World Court's jurisdiction must be en-
 larged and strengthened.  There must
 be in the General Assembly a more realis-
 tic distribution of voting power.

 But these are difficult, perhaps im-
 possible achievements in the hostile at-
 mosphere of the cold war.  What I sug-
 gest is that one step is possible--one is
 immediately achievable-and that is for
 the member nations to cease forthwith
 their neglect of the U.N. and their
 solemn, written obligations under its
 charter.  Regardless of whether or not
 there are defects in the charter, it is up
 to its signatories to make faithful and
 diligent efforts to comply with its pro-
 visions.
 A constitution, any set of rules or laws,
 any charter, is only as effective as the
 good faith of its members.  There are
 a number of totalitarian nations whose
 constitutions read much like our own.
 There Is England which has no written
 constitution, but the long tradition of ob-
 servance of the law by its citizens creates
 a law abiding community.
 Where law is treated with contempt by
 powerful and influential segments of the
 society, the rule of law itself is en-
 dangered.
 For the past 100 years in certain areas
 of our South, white men in the position
 of leadership have said that continuation
 of the creed of racism is more important
 than the law.  And to this day it is vir-
 tually impossible to enforce ordinary
 criminal statutes against white men who
 assault or murder Negroes.
 A respectable and powerful political
 leader such as the senior Senator from
 Virginia will declare that the preserva-
 tion of segregated schools is more im-
 portant than respect for Federal law as
 enunciated in the 1954 school desegrega-
 tion decisions.
 In the community of nations we see
 the destruction of the international law
 of the U.N. Charter by the members who,
 like white Mississippians viewing race,
 find that the particular conflicts between
 nations are more important than the
 preservation of the international ma-
 chinery for dealing with the conflict.
 Russia declares its interest in Hungary
 is more important than Its contract to
 submit the dispute to the U.N.  The
 United States finds its stake in Vietnam
 more important than its treaty obliga-
 tions under the U.N. Charter.
 During the past few months we have
 witnessed a buddingrespect for law and
 order in our South and- an increasing
 compliance with the law.  Amongst the
 causes are the three civil rights bills and
 the various economic pressures exerted
 by the Federal Government.  But im-
 portant amongst the causes is the emer-
 gence          of  business  and         Government
 leaders who say that the quality of civili-
 zation that results from compliance with
 the law is now more important to them
 than illegal apartheid.
 I would suggest that the United States
 as the world's most powerful and in-
 fluential nation declare to the world its
 resolution to comply hereafter with its
 written contracts-most importantly its
 obligations under the Charter of the
 United Nation.
 Paragraphs  3  and 4  of article  2
 provide:
 All members shall settle their international
 disputes by peaceful means in such a manner
 that international peace and security, and
 justice, are not endangered.
 All members shall refrain in their inter-
 national relations from the threat or use of
 force against the territorial integrity or polit-
 ical independence of any state, or in any
 other manner inconsistent with the pur-
 poses of the United Nations.
 And further in article 33:
 The parties to any dispute, the continu-
 ance of which is likely to endanger the main-
 tenance of international peace and security,
 shall, first of all, seek a solution by negoti-
 ation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbi-
 tration, judicial settlement, resort to regional
 agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful
 means of their own choice.
 And article 37 continues:
 Should the parties to a dispute of the
 nature referred to in Article 33 fail to settle
 It by the means indicated in that Article,
 they shall refer It to the Security Council.
 If the Security Council deems that the con-
 tinuance of the dispute is in fact likely to
 endanger the maintenance of international
 peace and security, it shall decide whether
 to take action under Article 36 or to recom-
 mend such terms of settlement as it may
 consider appropriate.
 And even then if the Soviet Union
 should exercise its veto, there is then the
 General Assembly to which the - matter
 can be presented under the Uniting for
 Peace Resolution, which provides:
 That if the Security Council, because of
 lack of unanimity of the permanent mem-
 bers, fails to exercise its primary responsi-
 bility for the maintenance of international
 peace and security In any case where there
 appears to be a threat to the peace, breach
 of the peace, or act of aggression, the General
 Assembly shall consider the matter immedi-
 ately with a view to making appropriate rec-
 ommendations  to  Members for  collective
 measures, including in the case of a breach of
 the peace or act of aggression, the use of
 armed force when necessary, to maintain
 or restore international peace and security.
 I am not impressed with objections
 that the Uniting for Peace Resolution
 has been emasculated by Ffance's and
 Russia's refusal to pay certain peace-
 keeping assessments or that action by the
 Security Council will be frustrated by a
 Soviet veto.  In Selma last winter I
 talked to Sheriff Jim Clark who wore a
 big badge on his chest that said "Never",
 and I think it clear now that the in-
 tegration referred to on Clark's badge
 will arrive sooner than he thinks.
 To follow this course of compliance
 with what we have contracted to do by
 signing the U.N. Charter will not be easy.
 The right-wing will shout appeasement
 and treason unless every dispute is de-
 cided in our favor.  Our elected officials
 must discover new reservoirs of courage
 and serenity that will subdue the terrors
 of the timid.  We will have to learn to
 permit our President to truly negotiate
 in foreign affairs and not force him to be
 the victor in every skirmish.
 And we citizens must find new charac-
 ter traits of sophistication and confidence
 in the power of our free society to per-
 suade imitation and respect.  We will
 have to be good natured and understand-
 ing in our relations with the nations
 emerging from Colonialism. Some will
 be headed by leftists and non-conformers
 who will look with distrust upon our
 conservatism.  They will not always be-
 have as we might want them to, and we
 will have to learn tolerance as well as
 patience.
 I am afraid that America will find this
 path difficult and calling for new reser-
 voirs of maturity because of what Toyn-
 bee describes as our medieval religious
 belief that our adversaries have a super-
 human wickedness and potency and that
 it is the manifest destiny of the United
 States to unilaterally save the world.
 We must be more interested in solving
 problems than,in proving theories.  All
 the great powers must learn that their
 ideologies are as great a source of danger
 as they are of strength.
 I don't pretend to have proposed to..
 day any radical steps that, if imple-
 mented, will magically produce a world
 of independent states with adequate in-
 ternational machinery for the peaceful
 settling of disputes.  I suggest, however,
 that what I have proposed is a logical
 first move.
 As  Benjamin  V.  Cohen  recently
 pointed out, at least the referral of dis-
 putes to the U.N. would cause delay so
 that time would have a chance to oper-
 ate.                                                                                              Our  generation must be  wise
 enough to find ways of leaving to the
 solvent of time and the wisdom of sue-
 ceeding generations problems which we
 of our generation are unable to solve.
 Let us not forget that the most agres-
 sive ideologies undergo changes over the
 years. Even the most fanatical faiths
 balk at self-destruction and mellow with,
 time. As Justice Holmes summed It up,
 "time has upset many fighting faiths."
 A few weeks ago I was In Los Angeles.
 Automobile  after automobile  carried
 bumper stickers.  Some read "Impeach
 Earl  Warren."    Two  read "Register
 Communists-Not Firearms." Another
 read  "The War on Poverty Means
 Poverty for All" and still another read
 "Get the U.S. Out of the U.N."  I saw
 no cars with bumper stickers urging
 support of the U.N. or of world law.
 This brought home to me what, I think,
 Gladstone said, that "Good ends can
 rarely be attained in politics without
 passion."  In the battle to support and
 strengthen the United Nations, our op-
 ponents seem to have all the passion and
 it is up to us to counter this with pas-
 sion of our own.
 Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that our
 President at his news conference last
 Wednesday reiterated his faith in the
 peacekeeping machinery of the U.N.  I
 know that our President is devoted to
 the cause of peace and is seeking with
 every skill at his command a formula
 that can result in an honorable peace in
 Vietnam.  I hail the mission he has as-
 signed to Ambassador Goldberg.  I have
 faith that the solution will eventually be
 found through the U.N.
 Mr. ROSENTHAL.  Mr. Speaker, for
 the past several weeks, many of us here
 in Congress have urged a greater United
 Nations role in searching for a peaceful
 solution to the war in Vietnam.  We were
 all, therefore, deeply gratified by Presi-
 dent Johnson's remarks last week affirm-
 ing this country's decision to involve the
 United Nations in new diplomatic initia-
 tives.  Ambassador Goldberg's appoint-
 ment signaled such a renewed dedica-
 tion to international peacekeeping.  His
 efforts in communicating with Secretary
 General U Thant represent new cause
 for hope.

 It seems to me crucial that the United
 Nations be the auspices under which
 peace initiatives are to be taken. Initi-
 ally, U.N.-sponsored gestures have a
 greater chance of attracting support
 from the nonalined countries whose
 good will should be a major goal of his
 country's foreign policy.  And, since any
 eventual settlement should,. include a
 guarantor role for the United Nations, it
 is important that the organization be
 involved in the quest for peace as early
 as possible.
 Much of the failure of the Geneva
 settlement in 1954 can. be attributed to
 the inadequacy of strong institutional
 support and enforcement. The Interna-
 tional Control Commission had neither
 the resources nor the authority with
 which to implement the difficult peace-
 keeping role assigned to it.  We might
 now attempt to strengthen the Commis-
 sion by establishing a United Nations
 presence at ICC missions. Renovating
 the diplomatic machinery of the Com-
 mission by giving it the support of the
 United-Nations might prove a useful step
 toward the establishment of an author-
 ity equipped to handle the difficult job
 of supervising peace in Vietnam.  The
 United  Nations -might  also  be  the
 mechanism for a gradual disengagement
 of American and North ? Vietnamese
 forces following a ceasefire. And, even-
 'tually, full U.N. sponsorship might be
 given to a new Geneva Convention, with
 the participation of all. relevant parties,
 ? whether or not they are members of the
 United Nations.
 I think we should be equally aware of
 the importance Vietnam can have on the
 United Nations.  Peacekeeping activi-
 ties `by an international body are now
 generally looked upon with disfavor and
 skepticism. There is nothing the United
 Nations needs more. than a success. This
 country can help bring that about, with
 subtlety and prudence, by seeking to in-
 volve,the. United Nations in every diplo-
 matic initiative and policy which has any
 chance, of succeeding.  There is no rea-
 son why we cannot be generous in peace.
 This,, of course, is a matter of some
 delicacy, which is why we are so fortu-
 nate to be represented in the United Na-
 tions by Ambassador Goldberg.
 Finally, let me take this moment to
 compliment the gentleman from Wis-
 consin [Mr. REUssl, for taking this time
 to deal with the role of the United Na-
 tions in Vietnam,' He ,has been an im-
 portant participant in a debate which
 for too long has been private and re-
 pressed.  His thoughtful article in the
 Commonweal inagazine last month has
 helped many of us develop our own views
 on the necessity for United Nations activ-
 ity.                We all are grateful for his efforts
 and diligence.

 NEW  YORK  CITY   IN  CkIsis--CITY  GRANTED
 $9.1 MILLION ANTIPOVERTY FUNDS
 (By Barry Gottehrer and Alfonson Narvaez)
 WASHINGTON.-NSW   York  City's        long.
 delayed antipoverty program took a large
 step forward yesterday when the Office of
 Economic Opportunity approved a $9.1-mil-
 lion request in community action funds.
 These funds-part of a package first re-
 quested by city officials early in March and
 delayed by the battle over who was to con-
 trol the program-is the largest single grant
 so far in the Federal war on poverty.
 These  funds,  awarded  for  an  8-month
 period, were accompanied by Sargent Shri-
 ver's approval for the formula the city ad-
 ministration has finally worked out to ad-
 minister the programs.
 Mr. Shriver said he is convinced that the
 newly  designed  New  York  City  Council
 Against Poverty, which would give the poor
 32 seats out of 100, does meet the Federal
 law's call for "maximum feasible representa-
 tion", of the poor.
 "I think the,New York program now has a
 generally  satisfactory  structure,"  he  said.
 "There is nothing in the law that says fiscal
 control has to be surrendered by public offi-
 cials and turned over to the poor.                                                                            It's up to
 each  community      to  work  out    the best
 formula."
 News of the OEO announcement reached
 Mayor Wagner at Portland, Maine, where he
 is spending the weekend.
 "As soon as the Governor approves the
 'proposal, we will be able to move ahead with
 action, rather than words," he said.
 "We  have  had  some  difficulty  in  our
 groundbreaking for this effort. A certain
 amount of controversy developed which was
 doubtless a healthy thing."
 The grant of $9.1 million in community
 action funds brings the city's share of Fed-
 eral  antipoverty funds  to more than  $20
 million.
 When informed of the OEO announcement,
 Paul Screvane, head of the city's Economic
 Opportunity Corp,-the operational arm of
 the city's antipoverty program-which will
 receive the funds, said that the city could
 at last begin to operate its programs.
 `The official logjam is over," he said.  "Now
 we will be able shortly to begin to operate
 our many community action programs.        It
 should be understood that the community
 action program is, not a single monolithic
 program, but a series of programs, all based
 on the principle that the local community
 knows best what It needs, but that a central
 theme-or umbrella -is necessary to assure
 all the people in all of the distressed areas
 that they have equal access to the benefits
 of the war on poverty, and an equal oppor-
 tunity to enlist in the war against poverty."
 The city's original request for $10.5 million
 for the community action phase of the war
 on poverty was sent to the OEO on March 11.
 The Federal grant now goes to Governor
 Rockefeller who has 30 days in which to
 approve or reject it. 'If he takes not action
 at all at the end of 30 days, the grant will be
 considered approved.
 But May 1 passed without the necessary
 approval` and  fie city was again forced to
 modify its proposal.
 Then, on May 9, Senator JACOB JAVITS re-
 leased a report by the Senate Labor and Wel-
 fare Committee which attacked the city's
 proposal.
 However, Sargent Shriver balked at this
 proposal and asked for a revision of the plan.
 He wanted members of community organiza-
 tions represented on the board.
 On April 7, city officials met with the OEO
 staff and agreed to modify their proposal.
 They suggested instead an Economic Oppor-
 tunity Corporation composed of 11 city offi-
 cials and 4 community representatives,  The
 OEO called this unacceptable.
 When the city's proposal went before ADAM
 CLAYTON  POWELL's  House  Education and
 Labor subcommittee on April 15, it called for
 a corporation composed of 11 city officials
 and five or six community representatives.
 Even then, Representative    POWELL chal-
 lenged the city's position and said that the
 proposed corporation was "monopolistic" and
 in violation of the Economic Opportunity
 Act, which called for "the maximum feasible
 participation of residents of the areas and
 members of the groups served."
 Congressman   POWELL   then  asked  the
 Comptroller General to cut off funds for the
 city's poverty programs.  Meanwhile  pres-
 sure from community groups, social welfare
 agencies  and  from  several    Congressmen
 representing  the  city, began  to mobilize
 against the proposed corporation.
 On May 11; Mayor Wagner released plans
 for a completely new arrangement for the
 city's anti-poverty program.    He would cre-
 ate two corporations-an Economic Oppor-
 tunity Corporation and a Council Against
 Poverty.
 The  Economic  Opportunity      Corporation
 would still consist of the 11 city officials and
 six representatives of the community, but
 the new Council Against Poverty would have
 a 62-man board of directors, composed of 16
 city officials, 40 representatives of community
 groups and agencies, and six members of the
 poor.
 Even while the Mayor was releasing his
 new proposal, the OEO said that the inclu-
 sion of only six members of the indigenous
 poor-the  target  population-was  insuffi-
 cient and that approval would not be forth-
 coming.  It called for a new formula which
 would have greater representation by the
 poor.
 Reaction in the community also spelled
 doom    for the city's plan.  Mass meetings
 were held in which the poor and members of
 the already existing community action agen-
 cies challenged the city's move.  They called
 for a greater voice in the anti-poverty move-
 ment.
 Finally on May 24 Mayor Wagner issued an
 executive order which called for the creation
 of a Council Against Poverty composed of
 not more than 100 members.  The proposal
 called for inclusion of 32 members of the
 poor-two from each of the 16 designated
 pockets of poverty in the city-and 10 mem-
 bers                                                                                                                                     of  community  action       organizations.
 The city would have only 16 officials on the
 Council. The rest would come from social
 welfare agencies and community leaders.
 This new formula was acceptable to the
 OEO only when the Mayor included a prom-
 issory letter pledging that. the Council would
 include the 32 representatives of the poor
 and 10, representatives of community action
 groups "within a month-surely no, longer
 than 60 days."

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           August 3, 1965
 (By Marshall Peck)
 There were some 200 persons In the audi-
 torium at PS 11 on 21st Street, Thursday
 night, well-dressed and attentive, men and
 women, young adults, churchmen, a few
 nuns in a row, gathered for a community
 meeting.  They were told that this was
 where a der ocratic program starts.
 "What we are doingtonight is the anti-
 poverty program Itself," said the "Reverend
 John H. Wilson, chairman of the evening.
 "This meeting makes up and actually
 constitutes the program.  For this program
 involves getting the people together and
 hearing their thoughts and suggestions, and
 planning things out."
 As Father Wilson finished, a woman trans-
 lated his remarks into Spanish.
 Discussion
 Then Father Wilson moved the microphone
 down to the auditorium floor and opened
 the discussion on proposals presented in
 mimeographed leaflets.  They were how the
 directors of the local  antipoverty board
 would be chosen, and what would be its
 composition.
 The meeting started at 8 p.m.  What fol-
 lowed in the next 3 hours--calculated de-
 bate, heated exchanges, charges of divisive
 language, pleas for unity action-may well
 typify the hundreds of meetings that will
 be held across this city.
 For here, in Chelsea, at the grassroots,
 people-with considered judgment by some,
 snap viewpoints by others, with poise, bra-
 vado, shyness-were articulating the views
 and demands of the poor.
 Objective
 The objective of the meeting in Public
 School 11 was the formulation at community
 level of a structure representative of the
 poor, Which would help coordinate anti-
 poverty programs, and help select representa-
 tives to sit on the City's Council Against
 Poverty.  Dozens of similar groups are gear-
 ing up the same way.  The Chelsea meeting
 conveyed some of the impact of the pro-
 gram so far on the people it is intended to
 serve.                                     -
 First, despite distribution of 15,000 leaflets
 (some allegedly delivered the day of the
 meeting), it was a sparse audience, with par-
 tictilarly little representation from middle or
 higher income families.  Two hundred people
 were deciding on matters that would have
 some bearing on 60,000 neighbors.  (When
 this was noted there were cheers, "That's
 fine, fine.")
 Second, it quickly became apparent that
 the voice of the poor intends to be heard,
 loudly, in pursuit of just demands as laid
 down in the Economic Opportunity Act.
 Longtime  Chelsea  residents  who  argued
 that they were entitled to share direction
 because they had once felt    poverty were
 waved aside.  A few suggestions of modera-
 tion, presented by some who had in fact
 arranged for this public discussion, were
 quickly talked down.
 Third, out of all came the evidence that,
 with  responsible  assistance,  a  community
 can organize such a meeting get lower income
 people to attend, and the poor can, indeed,
 speak effectively for themselves.
 There are still uncertainties about the
 Chelsea program, but the result of this meet-
 ing Thursday night, were decisions to allow
 the entire community to vote for two slates,
 one of the poor and the other a general list,
 and that two-thirds of the 10-man board
 membership should be "of the Door."
 A rough rule of thumb was laid down
 that the limits for qualifying as poor are
 $3,000 annual income for a single person,
 $4,000 for a couple, with $500 for each de-
 pendent.  A man got up and said that
 "everyone is poor today," and asked if any-
 one present considered himself otherwise.
 One, a lawyer and member of the planning
 committee, raised his hand:
 The Chelsea meeting showed a long road
 ahead as the city attempts to broaden its
 base of "representation of the poor" on the
 New York City Council Against Poverty."
 For instance, Chelsea is only one of four
 neighborhoods in the West Side poverty tar-
 get                                                                     area  (along  with  Greenwich  Village,
 Clinton, Lincoln Square).  But somehow
 this entire West Side must elect two repre-
 sentatives to the council against poverty.
 Throughout the other 15 target areas there
 are  similar problems, and in  some cases
 tougher ones of rivalries between "umbrella"
 councils and smaller action teams, between
 older social  agencies and upstart activist
 programs.
 There is antagonism by some at the use
 of Spanish ("You're in America now, speak
 English," said a woman.  "I admire Puerto
 Ricans who try to speak English.  I don't
 care  about  your   grammar * * ?") .  And
 there is uneasiness among Puerto Ricans
 that, as  Miss Antonio  Pantoja, executive
 director of Aspira, said, they "won't even
 come out second best, because the Puerto
 Ricans are citywide in scope, with no major-
 ity in any one community."  She added:
 "The Negro is always in the majority."
 Centers
 There are factions within factions, and the
 court had to step in to decide who was the
 legitimate  leadership    of  QUEST  (Queens
 United Educational and Social Teams, Inc.).
 There is much uncertainty at the grassroots.
 Said the Reverend George Hardy, president of
 SEBU (Southeast Bronx United).  "The city
 doesn't want to tell us how to do it [elect
 two representatives], and the community
 doesn't know how to do it.  This is a gi-
 gantic-task.  It won't get off the ground by
 September."
 The city has planned to administer to
 some areas through so-called community
 progress centers, which are to be set up in
 the South Bronx, Williamsburg, Brownsville,
 West Side, East Harlem, and South Jamaica,
 but these are viewed with disfavor by some.
 A professional social worker, George Silcott,
 executive  director of Forest Neighborhood
 House in the Bronx, said: "A CPC will be
 superimposed on the community, and the
 community should be doing the job."
 The Office of Economic opportunity has
 accepted the New York Council's finding ap-
 plication on condition that the council ful-
 fill its pledge to enlarge its body with 32
 representatives of the poor and 10 persons
 from community action programs.     That
 means  one  each  from  Southeast  Bronx
 United, Queens Unlimited Educational and
 Social Teams, Lower West Side Anti-Poverty
 Board, Bedford Stuyvesant Youth-in-Action,
 Puerto Rican Forum, Puerto Rican Commu-
 nity  Development  Project,                                                                          South  Bronx
 Neighborhood Orientation Project, Massive
 Economic    Neighborhood     Development
 (MEND), Mobilization for Youth, and Har-

 Teams (Haryou-ACT).
 Dr. Arthur C. Logan, chairman of the Coun-
 cil Against Poverty, said that he hoped to
 have the 10 new members  "within a few
 weeks," and the 32 additional representatives
 "within a very few months."
 The   Office   of   Economic   Opportunity
 pointedly hoped that the council, as the chief
 structure that will administer New York's
 antipoverty program, could comply with the
 law "within a month-surely no longer than
 60 days."  There have been two recent public
 rallies by community groups, full of hard
 talk against city hall's recalcitrance, and
 an OEO spokesman noted that action was
 needed to head off possible "long, hot sum-
 mer" demonstrations.
 The city has laid down guidelines for the
 elections of "representatives of the poor" in
 a procedures manual put out by the Anti
 Poverty  Operations  Board.   But  the  city
 wishes, quite properly, to give full rein to
 the communities In the final choice of its
 delegates.
 So confusion, lack of information, antag-
 onism, have seriously hamstrung the seat-
 ing of "the poor" on the council.  In effect,
 the program is going on, and the people
 who are supposed to be having a say, aren't.
 They know it, and they're mad.
 FULL DISCLOSURE Or BOOKS DEMANDED
 (By Barry Gottehrer and Alfonzo Narvaez)
 WASHINGTON :--Sargent Shriver, head of the
 Office of Economic Opportunity, announced
 yesterday that all agencies, both public and
 private, receiving Federal antipoverty funds
 must respond fully to all reasonable requests
 for information concerning programs and fi-
 nances.
 If these agencies, after being funded by
 OEO antipoverty grants, it was learned that
 Mr. Shriver said his office would make this
 information available under his agency's full-
 disclosure policy.
 Though a spokesman maintained that the
 full-disclosure clause was standard  in all
 OEO antipoverty grants, it was learned that
 this statement of policy was attached-along
 with other special conditions-to New York's
 $9.1 million grant because of the continuing
 refusal of Livingston Wingate, executive di-
 rector of Haryou ACT, the controversial Har-
 lem antipoverty program, to open his books.
 During the last 3 months, Mr. Wingate, a
 former aidto Representative ADAM CLAYTON
 PowELL, has been under attack both from
 within and without his organization for his
 administration  of  the  multimillion-dollar
 project.
 Charges--coming from some staff members
 and directors, former employees and residents
 of the troubled area the program has been
 created to help'-have included political con-
 trol, padded payrolls, slipshod recordkeep-
 ing, shortages in inventory, little progress
 and mismanagement.
 Mr. Wingate has denied these charges orally
 but, despite pressure from both city and
 Federal officials, has refused to provide fi-
 nancial records sufficient to refute them.
 In announcing  the grant,  OEO officials
 made it clear yesterday that approval of the
 request,  which  included  $1.2  million  for
 Haryou-ACT, was not to be taken either as
 refuting or substantiating these charges. I
 Mr. Shriver maintained that a series of
 conditions-established  to  fit  local situa-
 tions-must be met before Haryou-ACT and
 any of the other New York projects would
 receive these funds.
 Included in these conditions-which must
 be met within 60 days--are full reports on
 personnel and accounting methods and, for
 the first time, a provision that would bar
 members of a project's nonsalaried board of
 directors from receiving consulting fees for
 services related to the projects' programs.
 On May 10. In its first report of trouble
 at Haryou-ACT, the Herald Tribune's New
 York City in Crisis series pointed out that
 several members of the Haryou-ACT board
 were receiving consulting fees from Haryou-
 ACT.and ACT, its sister project.
 OEO, which with two other Federal agen-
 cies conducted a survey audit of Haryou-
 ACT's books last month, said it was waiting
 for the results of a depth audit of the pro-
 gram by Price Waterhouse, a major account-
 ing firm  brought in by the Haryou-ACT
 board.
 The results of this audit are expected by
 the end of the month at which time OEO
 will give Haryou-ACT 60 to 90 days to put the
 firm's recommendations into effect.
 "We're pretty hard nosed about this," said
 William Kelly, OED's assistant director for
 management.  "If there's something wrong-
 and Its not taken care of-and I don't care
 if It's Haryou-ACT or Boeing Aircraft, we'll
 do something about it."
 Many of the charges began in June 1964,
 when Dr. Kenneth Clark, the "father" of the

 A4271
 bombast-for one of his most important pro-
 nouncements on Vietnam.  It was a good
 choice, for what the President had to say was
 serious and calmly purposeful.
 The situation has made it necessary, he
 said, to more than double draft calls from
 17,000 to 35,000 a month.
 It has become necessary to immediately
 increase U.S. military strength in Vietnam
 from 75,000 to 125,000 with more forces to
 be sent later.
 It  has  become  necessary  to  seek  more
 money, amount unspecified, but in the long
 run undoubtedly a lot.
 It has become necessary to gird for what
 may be a long war-and the President did
 not hesitate to call it a war even though there
 are no battle lines, no clash of armies.
 Why are we sending our young men to
 this lush edge of a peninsula thousands of
 miles away?
 Because we cannot dishonor a pledge to
 protect freedom that three Presidents have
 underwritten.  Because  "if  we  are  driven
 from . Vietnam, no nation can    ever again
 have confidence in our promise or protec-
 tion."  Because                                                                                                                                           "an      Asia threatened   by
 Communist domination would imperil the
 security of the United States Itself."
 But, the President said, our purpose to
 stay is no stronger than our purpose to seek
 an honorable peace.     He listed 15 efforts to
 bring about discussions, all  of which the
 Communists  ignored.    We   are  willing  to
 listen to Hanoi's terms provided Hanoi will
 listen to ours.  We are willing that Vietcong
 guerrillas be represented by Hanoi at a bar-
 gaining table.
 Finally-and this could be his ace card-
 the President directed our new U.N. Am-
 bassador Arthur J. Goldberg, as his first act,
 to present to Secretary General Thant a Pres-
 idential letter requesting "all the resources"
 energy, and immense prestige of the United
 Nations be employed to bring peace."
 So there it Is, for all the world to study and
 for the Communists to ponder.

 first pouring of concrete in the Amistad
 Dam.  The primary function of the
 Amistad Dam will be flood control and
 the United States share of the costs-

 $78 million.  Construction will require
 the acquisition of nearly 61,000 acres of
 lands in the United States, the relocation
 of 14.3 miles of Southern Pacific rail-
 road track, 19 miles of U.S. Highways
 90 and 277, two electric transmission sys-

 acquisitions and relocations are now
 almost complete.  The construction of
 the dam itself is, today, 19 percent
