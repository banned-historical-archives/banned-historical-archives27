CHINA 
EVIDENCE INDICATES PURGE OF LIN, OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS 
Most of the PRC's active top military leaders have been out of 
public view for two months, and there is mounting evidence of 
a major purge in the armed forces extending up to Lin Piao, 
the defense minister and "deputy supreme commander." Lin's name 
has not been mentioued in monitored PRC media for over a month. 
Though the apparent purge may have been precipitated by Lin's 
failing health, recent politically charged comment which may 
be interpreted as aimed at Lin suggests that Mao's heir-designate 
is politically moribund. 
IDEOLOGICAL Lin Piao appears to be the primary target of a 
CAMPAIGN recently launched ideological campaign condemning 
the "idealist conception of history" for empha-
sizing the role of "heroes" and "theorists of genius." The 
current drive has been most notably reflected in an article in 
RED FLAG No. 11, first broadcast by the Shanghai radio on 
23 October, which added a significant new thrust to the continuing 
campaign to deepen the study of Mao's philosophical works in 
order to eradicate the influence of "sham Marxists" and "political 
swindlers." Directing the new thrust at those who "rezard them-
selves as theorists of genius," the RED FLAG article seems to be 
developing a case against Lin based on his "excessive" praise of 
Mao, an error deriving from his major role in the cultural revolu-
tion as the most outstanding student and propagator of Mao's 
thought. "Excessive" adulation of Mao had previously figured in 
charges against Yang Cheng-wu, the PLA acting chief of staff 
purged in 1968, and Politburo member Chen Po-ta, the leading 
Maoist ideologue who has been missing since the party plenum 
last August and September. 
The RED FLAG article denied the existence of innate knowledge and 
stressed that truth can be determined only by "objective results 
in social practice." Striking at the idea that "people can 
cultivate themselves into supermen with foresight and vision," 
the article pointedly cited a line from the "Internationale"--
"never there is a savior, nor will we rely on gods or emperors"--
to buttress its argument that "there is no man with congenital 
foresight and vision." In the past few weeks a campaign has 
been unfolding to promote the "Internationale" and another song, 
the military-orientated "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and

the Eight Points for Attention." A joint article by PEOPLE'S 
DAILY and LIBERATION ARMY DAILY, released by NCNA on 27 October, 
urged that the masses "be repeatedly taught to sing the songs 
in close connection with the current situation, and tasks." 
Lin's vulnerable position on the question of innate wisdom and 
genius, a quality he attributed to Mao, was expressed in a 
speech he gave at an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee 
Politburo in May 1966. In that speech, according to Red Guard 
publications, Lin claimed that Mao had "inherited, defended, and 
developed Marxism-Leninism with genius." Praising Mao for "his 
great proletarian natural talent" and declaring that "we should 
recognize natural talent," Lin reportedly declared that "Chair-
man Mao is a natural leader" whose Thought "will remain brilliant 
forever" and obsequiously claimed that what Mao "says in one 
sentence is better than what we say in 10,000 sentences." 
One of the first indications in the media of the nature of the at-
tack on Lin came in aNingsia broadcast on 5 November which 
recalled that since the death of Marx and Engels, "opportunists 
of various kinds have launched rabid attacks against Marxism." 
Specifically, the broadcast noted that Mikhail Bakunia, the 
19th Century Russian anarchist and writer, once wrote to Marx 
saying, "I am your student, and I am proud of this" and later 
led a "conspiracy to usurp the leadership of the First Interna-
tional." In tracing the antecedents of unnamed elements in 
the CCP who have "inherited the style of the ancestors of 
revisionism," the broadcast mentioned that Khrushchev, who 
"slandered" Stalin after his death, had previously praised him 
as "greatest genius, teacher, and leader of mankind, a great 
invincible supreme commander"--terms Lin has used with reference 
to Mao. While Chen Po-ta also fits the image of a fawning 
political swindler plotting crimes after Mao's death, references 
in the broadcast to seizing military power make Lin the more 
likely target. The broadcast stated that the faction "in power 
within the party" taking the capitalist road "will always try to 
seize power over the army," and it observed that in CCP history 
Chang Kuo-tao had previously tried to "split the red army and 
establish a separate party central committee." 
Lin's apparent removal from active control of the PLA was 
suggested in the Fingsia broadcast's reference to the PLA 
as "a powerful proletarian army personally founded and led 
by Chairman Mao," with no mention of Lin's leadership role 
in the army. A diminution of Lin's status as the leader in 
control of the PLA had first been reflected in another varia-
tion of this formula, appearing in the joint Peking press

editorial marking Army Day on 1 August. At a time of apparent 
moves to depersonalize control of the army, the joint editorial 
referred to the PLA as a force "founded and led" by Mao and 
"commanded" by Lin--a step back from the usual formula since 
1967, which had described the army as "personally founded and 
led" by Mao and "directly commanded" by Lin. 
An attempt is also being made to bolster the image oi Mao him-
self as an active military leader. An unusual Lanchow broad-
cast on 28 October, for example, recalled Mao's leadership 
role "on the old battlefields in northern Shensi" where he 
"personally commanded the battles." The broadcast noted that 
during the Yenan period Mao "not only took command of the 
liberation work throughout the country, but also directly 
commanded the fighting in the northwest war theater winning 
a great victory there." 
While the applicability of many recent attacks to more than 
one missing leader makes it difficult to identify the players 
without the scorecards which may be available to Chinese 
cadres, a 20 October PEOPLE'S DAILY article broadcast by 
Radio Peking also seemed pointed particularly against Lin. 
The broadcast quoted Lu Hewn, literary figure of the 1920's 
and 1930's, as having said that what had hurt him most "was 
the sinister arrow fired by my ally and his smiling face 
after I was wounded." In an appnrent allusion to betrayal 
by close comrades, the article said that in order to "pre-
vent himself from being attacked from behind," Lu was forced 
"to sidestep and was unable to launch a frontal attack on 
his enemies"--a course which seems akin to Mao's zigzags. 
Lu was also said to have constantly reminded the masses to 
pay attention not only to the obvious enemy but also to 
"secret agents in one's own camp." Perhaps to imply that 
there was military support for "sham Marxists," t)e article 
stated that "if the struggle against sham Marxism is tanta-
mount to a civil war among warlords, then it is more impor-
tant than ever for leftwing theorists to fight a civil war . ? . 
and withdraw the poisonous arrows fired from behind." 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS Characteristically, Peking media have 
AS AN ISSUE carefully avoicied suggesting discord 
over issues that could have produced 
a major purge of the military leadership. There were, how-
ever, a few possible allusions to dissension over resource

allocation priorities in the media during the summer,* and 
such differences may have been exacerbated by the major new 
development in Chinese foreign affairs in the recent period, 
the invitation to President Nixon. Movement toward Sino-
U.S. detente could have served the arguments of elements who 
played down a need for weapons expenditures to defend the 
country against external threats. There is evidence at 
least that the developments in Sino-U.S. relations are involved 
in the current maneuvering: A 5 November article broadcast by 
the Kiangsu radio stated that 
the class struggle in international circles and the 
class struggle at home are linking with each other. 
Any slight happening in international circles can 
incite the desire of a handful of class enemies at 
home to evil. 
The article went on to note that ideological changes hinge on 
changes on the international as well as the domestic scene 
and to observe that "the more drastically and rapidly the 
situation develops and changes, the stronger will be the 
reactions of various classes and strata to the situation." 
There had been a few earlier indications that Mao's "revolu-
tionary diplomatic line" was not immediately accepted by all 
elements in the leadership. Most notably, there were efforts 
in the media to explain the benefits of the new line to local 
units, especially military units. Typically, a Sinkiang broad-
cast on 24 October described how a PLA unit had strengthened 
its understanding of the new line: "Previously" some members 
of the unit's party committee had lacked understanding of the 
"sharp and complicated international class struggle," but 
after reading from Marx and Mao they realized that while the 
reactionary class will struggle ever more frantically, it is 
doomed so long as the revolutionary army stays alert and 
follows Mao. 
PARTY CONTROL Since the 1 August celebration of Army Day, 
the first public occasion at which Lin's 
status was noticeably diminished, signs of army-party discord 
have been manifest in increasingly frequent articles on the 
need for PLA units to follow the orders of party committees.

A complementary theme has been that militia units must be 
firmly under party control, with emphasis on the need for 
county and lower-level armed forces departments, which handle 
militia affairs, to obey the "unified leadership" of the 
local party committees. PLA dominance has also been quali-
fied by the campaign to promote collective leadership, a 
campaign which has included frequent reminders that the military 
figures who occupy most party posts on local levels are not in-
fallible and that the exemplary ones do not act without prior 
approval by the full CCP committee. A 21 October Tsinan broad-
cast encompassed all these points in describing how the PLA 
head of a commune armed forces department, who was also deputy 
secretary of the commune party committee, had reformed his 
thought: He had been making decisions affecting the militia 
without consultations, and as a result "militia work was not 
carried out smoothly"; after study, he came to regard "the 
people's armed forces department as a branch of the party 
committee," subject to all committee orders. 
A Hopei broadcast article on 31 October stated that since the 
end of the second plenary session of the Central Committee 
in the fall of 1970, and in particular since the beginning 
of the year "in the light of the new trends of the current 
class struggles at home and abroad, as well as the reality 
of the thinking of the troops and militia," the party 
committee of the military district had led the troops in mass 
study so that they could distinguish between "genuine and sham 
Marxism." As part of their study, the PLA cadres were said 
to have examined the party's historical record for instances 
in which leaders from Chen Tu-hsiu to Liu Shao-chi had tried 
"splitting the party and the army." 
A Chengtu radio report on 30 October called for the PLA to 
"march in step from top to bottom" and "obey the orders of 
Chairman Mao, the party Central Committee headed by Chairman 
Mao, and Mao Tse-tung Thought in everything." Struggle must 
be carried out "against all flaws hindering marching in step" 
so that the army's "glorious tradition of obeying orders in 
everything" can be carried forward. The broadcast warned against 
"everyone going his own way and taking arbitrary action." Re-
flecting the intensity of current disciplinary problems within 
the PLA, the broadcast cautioned that "we must oppose doing 
one thing to people's faces but doing something else behind 
their backs, and pursuing murky things."

ASCENDANCY OF The only clear gainer so far in the leader-
YEH CHIEN-YING ship crisis is Yeh Chien-ying, one of the 
10 "old marshals" and a military leader known 
to have close past associations with Chou En-lai. Yeh was a 
statf general during most of the civil-war and held important 
posts under Lin in the central-south region during the post-1949 
period. Although he was the target of some public criticism dur-
ing the cultural revolution, he did not appear to be in serious 
trouble; at the same time, he did not appear to be exercising 
very much power. During the past two months, however, he has 
made numerous publicized appearances as senior military officer 
present; and beginning with the celebrations of the Albanian 
party's 30th anniversary on 8 November, he has moved up in the 
leadership rankings ahead of civilian leaders Chang Chun-chiao 
and Yao Wen-yuan into the missing Chief of Staff Huang Yung-
sheng's old position behind Chiang Ching. 
While some other leaders have also been notably more active 
than before in the recent period, they have for the most part 
been appearing as stand-ins for Huang Yung-sheng and the other 
missing PLA service chiefs. 
One missing prcvincial leader has resurfaced in Peking: Rua 
Kuo-feng, Hunan first secretary, unmentioned at some recent 
provincial functions he would have been expected to attend, 
was reported among those seeing off the PRC's UN delegation 
on 9 November and was grouped with leading members of the 
central party and government apparatus. 
ALL PROVINCIAL STATIONS NOW ORIGINATING POLITICAL MATERIAL 
On 5 November the Kweichow provincial radio resumed locally 
originated programming after a month-long solid relay of 
Radio Peking. Kweichow, with a long history of factional pro-
blems, had previously ended a 20-month solid relay of Peking 
Radio on 18 May, the same day its new provincial CCP committee 
was announced; it reverted torelayingPeking broadcasts on 
8 October. With Kweichow's resumption of original programming, 
all 29 provincial-level radio stations are now originating 
political material for the first time since January 1967.

OCTOBER REVOLPTION ADDRESS 
GRISHIN OPTIMISTIC IN REVIEW OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY 
In the 6 November keynote address fin the eve of the 54th 
anniversary celebration of the October Revolution, Politburo 
member Grishin exuded confidence on the state of the world, 
pointing to a "considerable weakening" of imperialism in the 
face of an "effective rebuff" from peaceioving forces headed 
by the international communist movement. Among other 
problem areas, he cited the "financial crisis" in the United 
States which has "aggravated the contradictions among the 
imperialists." Reaffirming Soviet adherence to the "Leninist 
policy of peaceful coexistence and support for the liberation 
forces," Grishin emphasized the latter point in noting the 
CPSU's support for "the trend toward consolidation of all 
revolutionary movements" and asserted the party's conviction 
that cooperation between the revolutionary and aemocratic 
parties and communists is "the guarantee of the final victory 
of the national liberation revolutions, the guarantee of 
independent and progressive development of the liberated 
states." 
Grishin characterized the Soviet "peace program"--outlined by 
Brezhnev in the 30 March Central Committee report to the 
24th CPS! Congress--as "a realistic and constructive approach 
to international problems ripe for resolution by methods of 
negotiations and cooperation." At the same time, describing 
the spirit of the program as "militantly anti-imperialist," 
he sought to underscore the point that the peace offensive 
implies no breach in continuity or erosion of ideological 
principle. In what may have been inteaded as an invidious 
comparison with the Chinese, he declared that Soviet actions 
in the international arena are founded not on "transitory 
considerations of a speculative" nature, but on "a principled, 
strategic course based on a scientific analysis of the lam, 
of world development." At a later point, he asserted that 
in the interests of world peace and as a counter to the 
"dangerous military adventures" of world Paperialism, the 
CPSU is raising the defensive might of the USSR, a theme 
repeated by Defense Minister Grechko in his Red Square 
address on the 7th.

In his rundown of outstanding foreign policy issues, Grishin 
perfunctorily criticized the United States for its actions in 
Indochina and for its support of Israel in the Middle East and 
complained of the "splitting, anti-Soviet line" pursued by the 
Chinese leadership.* He touched only briefly on disarmament 
issues, noting that "positive results" have been achieved at 
the Soviet-American talks on strategic arms limitation and 
observing that "the world progressive public has welcomed with 
satisfaction" the Soviet proposals for convening a conference 
of the five nuclear powers and a world disarmament conference, 
as well as the Soviet proposals for the reduction of armed 
forces and armaments in central Europe, for banning bacterio-
logical weapons, for ending underground nuclear tests, 
"and others." Suslov's keynote address last year had not 
mentioned disarmament. 
Grishin reviewed the recent flurry of trips abroad by the 
Soviet leadership, remarking that exchanges, visits, consulta-
tions, and talks between national political figures serve the 
intelests of strengthening peace and cooperation. He did not, 
however, treat the question of U.S.-Soviet relations or 
mention President Nixon's forthcoming trip to the USSR. He 
dealt at some length with Brezhnev's October visit to France, 
which had been heavily played up in Soviet media, observing 
that it has served to ease international tension and to 
strengthen world peace and European security. He said the 
improvemert in Soviet-West German relations similarly improves 
the prospects for world peace and security in Europe. 
Grishin lauded the four-power agreement on Berlin of 3 September 
but did not mention the FRG's 1970 treaties with the USSR and 
Poland, which remain unratified. Repeating the call for a 
European security conference, he noted that conditions have 
now been created for its convening "as early as 1972." The 
30 October Soviet-French declaration following Brezhnev's 
visit to France had registered both sides' hope that prepara-
tions will be made to enable a conference to meet in 1972. 
* Grishin's remarks on Indochina are discussed at greater 
length in the Indochina section of this TRENDS. See the

On the Middle East, Grishin routinely pledged Soviet support 
for the Arabs in their struggle against "Israeli aggression 
backed by American imperialism." While recalling that this 
position was again confirmed during Egyptian President as-Sadat's 
talks in Moscow last month, Grishin did not take the occasion 
to repeat the pledge in the Soviet-Egyptian communique on 
measures to strengthen Cairo'r "military might." But routine 
comment has reiterated Podgornyy's statement, at a dinner 
for as-Sadat, that the USSR will combine efforts to achieve 
a political settlement with measures to help the ARE and 
other friendly Arab countries in strengthening their "defense 
capability." Grishin did charge Isroel with thwarting a 
political settlement, claiming that the "predatory" Israeli 
plans fail to take into account the Arabs' "firm will" to 
defend their interests as well as the increasingly strong 
friendship and cooperation between the Arab and Soviet peoples.

S I NO-SOV I ET RELATIONS 
MOSCCW WARNS OF MOTIVES BEHIND CHINESE DIPLOMATIC MOVES 
Moscow has renewed it attack on the Chinese leanership after 
a lull of almost a month in anti-China polemics, roughly 
spanning the period since the 12 October announcemsnt of the 
Soviet invitation to President Nixon. In the October 
Revolution anniversary address on 6 November Grishin made 
the standard call for normalization of Sino-Soviet state 
relations, but in contrast to Suslov last year he coupled 
this call with the charge that the Chinese leaders -re 
engaging in anti-Sovietism--the allegation that prompted the 
walkout of two Chinese diplomats and several journalists.* 
On the eve of the anniversary TASS publicized a lengthy, 
vitriolic article in INTERNATIONAL LIFE accusing the Chinese 
leadership of trying to form an anti-Soviet bloc and of 
reaching new heights in "fanatical" efforts to split the 
communist movement. 
The attack on Peking led off Grishin's remarks on relations 
with the socialist countries. While reaffirming Moscow's 
desire for normalized relations and claiming that Soviet 
initiative in this regard has borne "some fruit," Grishin 
observed that "serious progress" requires a desire for 
cooperation from both sides and that "unfortunately the 
Chinese leadership is continuing its splitting, anti-Soviet 
line." Consistent with Soviet practice in recent months, 
he did not mention the Sino-Soviet border talks, which Suslov 
last year had said "could nor be described as easy." Under-
scoring the unaltered CPSU position toward the PRC as defined 
at the 24th congress, Grishin reaffirmed as its basis "a 
principled struggle against the ideological and political 
platform of the CCP leadership--which is incompatible with 
Leninism." He added that the struggle includes "resolute 
exposure of Peking's hostile propaganda and defense of the 
Soviet Union's national interests." 
APALIN ARTICLE Entitled "The Antisocialist Essence of 
Peking's Foreign Policy," the lengthy 
article by Apalin in the November issue of the monthly

publicized by TASS on 4 November--represents the latest Soviet 
propaganda broadside designed to discredit the Chinese leadership 
and to dissuade communist and other countries from receptivity 
to Peking's flexible diplf,matic moves. Apalin's message to 
those who would consort aith Peking is that although its methods 
and tactics have changed, "sometimes fundamentally," PRC foreign 
policy "in essence remains the same--antisocialist, insidious, 
and dangerous to the revolutionary movement." In this context 
Apalin revives the recurrent theme--present, for example, in 
the 25 July I. Aleksandrov article in PRAVDA--that Peking "would 
like to provoke a military conflict between socialism and 
capitalism and then become the hegemonic force in a world 
destroyed by war." He also cites Peking's rejection of the 
Soviet proposal for a conference of the five nuclear powers 
as further evidence of the PRG's "adventurist course aimed 
at intensifying international tensions." 
Although Peking is trying to disguise the real import of its 
current diplomatic maneuvers, Apalin declares, the PRC's chief 
foreign policy goal is "to form a bloc aimed primarily against 
the Soviet Union and world socialism." This bloc, he adds, 
would be composed of "individual socialist countries, developing 
countries, and even some imperialist states." Concern on this 
score had been expressed in less pointed terms at the leadership 
level and in authoritative Soviet press comment in the wake of 
the announcement of President Nixon's projected visit to Peking. 
Gromyko had raised the specter of "combinations" of states 
directed against other states in the course of an explicit 
discussion of Sino-U.S. relations in his 28 September UN 
General Assembly speech. And Brezhnev, at a dinner for 
President Pompidou in Paris on 27 October, made a thinly 
veiled allusion to possible Sino-U.S. collusion on Indochina 
when he warned that the problem cannot be solved "either by 
attempts to impose an alien will on Vietnam by means of 
force or by way of secret combinations behind the backs of 
the Vietnamese people." 
In Moscow's first authoritative press reaction to President 
Nixon's Peking trip, the 25 July I. Aleksandrov article had 
cautioned against the formation of "political combinations 
aimed against other states." More pointedly, an article by 
D. Volskiy in NEW TIMES No. 35 in September interpreted a 
RED FLAG article disseminated widely by Peking in August as 
an attempt to justify the invitation to President Nixon on 
the grounds of the need for maximum flexibility in order to

differentiate the "main enemy" from the "secondary enemy." 
Recalling that the Japanese had been specified as the rain 
enemy during World War II, Volskiy clearly implied--but 
stopped short of saying in so many words--that Peking regards 
the Soviet Union as the main enemy today: After maintaining 
that the President's planned visit to Peking was behind the 
publication of the RED FLAG article, he concluded that it 
was "obvious" why Peking was advocating alliances with "the 
intermediate forces" and a temporary, tactical truce with "the 
secondary enemies" in order to concentrate its efforts against 
"the main enemy." 
Apalin in INTERNATIONAL LIFE now charges that in order to 
facilitate their anti-Soviet goals the Chinese leaders are 
willing to abandon their previously proclaimed principles 
and to "neglect the common tasks of the anti-imperialist 
struggle and perform sharp volte-faces in policy when they 
see a possibility of reaching some agreement with the 
imperialists which benefits solely China's national interests." 
Stating that the anti-Soviet orientation of China's foreign 
policy "invariably meets with understanding" in the capitalist 
world, Apalin adds the allegation that "the diplomatic 
recognition of the PRC by Western countries is a form of 
payment for the policy of splitting and undermining the 
united front of the anti-imperialist forces--a payment for 
anti-Sovietism." 
Turning specifically to Peking's divisive efforts in the world 
communist movement, Apalin says that "the Chinese leaders are 
now more fanatical than any time in the past in trying by 
every means to raise obstacles to the development of 
socialist unity." He alludes to Romania's and Yugoslavia's 
cordial relations with Peking in observing that the Chinese 
are pursuing a "differentiated" approach to the socialist 
countries and are playing on "natimalism" and anti-Sovietism 
to encourage "neutralism" among Moscow's allies. Noting that 
Peking is using a variety of means to achieve its ends--
ranging from "the restoration of party links with countries 
which until recently were among the 'revisionist parties" to 
the advancement of "material incentives"--he caps his lecture 
with the statement: "Marxist-Leninist parties believe that it 
is impossible to reconcile the Peking leaders' splittist policy 
and that a position of neutrality and of compromise runs 
counter to the fundamental principles of proletarian inter-
nationalism and makes the struggle against imperialism more 
difficult."

BUDAPEST PAPER EVINCES CONCERN OVER SINO-U1S1 "RAPPROCHEMENT" 
In keeping with Budapest's role as leading proxy spokesman for 
Moscow in the Sino-Soviet polemic, an article in the Hungarian 
party organ NEPSZABADSAG by Vernal on 7 November represents the 
bluntest attack on President Nixon's projected visit to Peking 
yet to appear in Soviet bloc media and notably registers 
concern over "the possibilities of an American-Chinese 
rapprochement." 
Pointing to the past history of Sino-U.S. relations, Vernal 
comments that "it is no exaggeration to say that the U.S. 
President will be forced to undertake a humilitating pilgrimage 
to Canossa in visiting the Chinese capital." He adds that 
"Nixon's visit to Peking is tantamount to a fiasco for U.S. 
policy based on the nonrecognition of People's China and aimed 
at isolating this vast country." Analyzing the President's 
motives for visiting Peking, Vernal. says "the U.S. imperialists" 
would like to extricate themselves from the Vietnam dilemma in 
Peking "under conditions satisfying for the U.S. capitalists, 
with the Chinese leaders' aid." He defines as an additional 
moti-Yation of "U.S. strategists" the objective of shifting 
the balance of power against the Soviets by entertaining the 
possibility "that despite the existing disparity of interests, 
Peking's nationalist and world-power aspirations coincide with 
U.S. notions." 
After noting that the Chinese leaders "are willing to receive 
the U.S. President," Varnai goes on to claim that "they have 
rejected high-level talks with the Soviet leaders"--an 
allegation Moscow itself has not made. He adds that the 
Sino-Soviet border talks "have been marking time for two 
years because various Soviet proposals aimed at a settlement 
remain unanswered." Moscow has been leaving it to its East 
European proxy spokesmen to bring up the matter of the talks. 
Seeking to fan suspicions in the international movement over 
Sino-American "collusion," Varnai says that "a flirtation 
between Peking and Washington would rightly elicit the mis-
givings and disapproval of the Indochinese, the DPRK, and 
many other Asian countries--countries in direct conflict with 
U.S. imperialism, whose vital interests are attached to the 
unity of the anti-imperialist forces."

Linking the Peking visit to the President's projected visit to 
Moscow, Varnai concludes with the pointed reminder that "what 
the President takes with him first to Peking and then to Moscow 
will determine in many respects the impression and answers he 
will take home with him from both capitals, and particularly 
from Moscow, which is doubtless more important for the United 
States in the final analysis." 
PEKING EXPRESSES HOPE FOR FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH SOVIETS 
Peking has used the occasion of the October Revolution anniversary 
to indicate that Sino-Soviet relations are not excluded from 
Its moves to normalize the PRC's relationships within the inter-
national community. In a message a shade more conciliatory than 
last year's, the Chinese said they are "deeply convinced" that 
"the friendly and good-neighborly relations" between the two 
countries "will eventually be restored and developed." Last 
year's message posited the same goal but without the expresaion 
of confident hope. An offensive reference to Stalin's tutelage 
appearing in the 1970 message, and deleted in PRAVDA's version 
of the message, was not present this year. 
As in 1970, the Chinese message--again addressed from the NPC 
Standing Committee and the State Council to their Soviet 
counterparts--urged that "important questions" involving 
state relations between the two countries be settled on the 
basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. Also like 
last year, the message affirmed that "controversies of 
principle" should not affect the two countries' state relations. 
Soviet Ambassador Tolstikov's reception marking the anniversary

As if to underscore the triangular setting of Peking's diplomatic 
moves, NCNA's report on the 9 November departure of Chiao 
Kuan-hua for the United Nations noted the presence of Ilichev. 
A powerful group of Chinese leaders present at the airport 
was headed by Chou En-lai.

While calling for improved state relations with the Soviets, 
Peking has alao reminded the communist movement of the 
"controversies of principle" mentioned in the message. On 
the same day as the October Revolution anniversary, the 
CCP sent a message to the Albanian party on its anniversary 
reaffirming a common interest in opposing "Soviet revisioniam." 
In a special gesture to the Albanians, on 8 November the 
Chinese took the opportunity of a rally celebrating the 
Albanian anniversary to put on view the top leaders currently 
making appearances: Chou, Chiang Ching, Yeh Chien-ying, 
Chang Chun-chiao, Yao Wen-yuan, and Li Haien-nien. In his 
speech at the rally Chang praised the Albanians for waging 
an uncompromising struggle against "modern revisionism with 
the Soviet revisionist leading clique as its center." The 
same point was made in an 8 November PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial 
on the anniversary.

INDOCHINA 
The U.S. air strikes on 7 and 8 November against North Vietnam--
described by IT.S, spokesmen as the heaviest since those of 
21 September--prompted only a routine DRV Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's statement, which does, however, assail them "as 
particularly serious." Followup comment on the 9th claims that 
bombing '..hroughout Indochina had been intensified oh, the eve 
of Defense Secretary Laird's trip to Saigon. 
Authoritative criticism was leveled at the Administration and 
the Nixon Doctrine in a 2 November NHAN DAN article by Nguyen 
Huu Chinh--a frequent commentator on U.S. affairs?pegged to 
the Senate rejection of the foreign aid bill. Chinh revived a 
line used during the July-August anti-China polemic when he 
claimed that the Nixon 'Doctrine is aimed "at sowing dissension 
in the socialist camp." At the same time, Hanoi, which has never 
mentioned the President's planned trips to Peking and Moscow, 
continues to demonstrate its even-handed treatment of its two 
big allies. Thus, propaganda on the October Revolution 
Anniversary, in a departure from the practice of previous years, 
refers to Chinese as well as Soviet aid to the DRV. On the 
1 October Chinese National Day Hanoi had also atypically 
referred to Soviet as well as Chinese aid. 
Soviet restraint toward the United States, particularly in the 
wake of the announcement of the President's plan to visit Moscow, 
seemed reflected in Soviet Politburo member Grishin's remarks on 
Vietnam in his keynote address on the October Revolution 
anniversary. Criticizing American "aggression" in cryptic and 
general terms, Grishin said nothing about the Vietnamization 
policy, although he did assail continued U.S. air strikes against 
the DRV. 
Communist media marked the 18th anniversary of Cambodinn independ-
ence much as they did last year, with publicity for a reception 
in Peking at which Chou En-lai and Sihanouk spoke. But unlike last 
year, neither the Chinese leaders' message nor the PEOPLE'S DAILY 
edito'7ial repeated the call to "persevere in a protracted people's 
war" in Indochina. Such calls dropped out of the propaganda after 
Peking, in the wake of Operation Lam Son 719 in Laos, exuded 
confidence over the military situation.

the deepest this year and the heaviest since 21 September--are 
protested in a routine statement by the DRV Foreign Ministry 
spokesman on the 8th. However, it differs from the recent 
spokesman's statements when it recalls the "savage bombings" 
on 21 September and refers to "repeated" raids in Vinh Linh 
and Quang Binh Province as well as to strikes in Lai Chau 
and Ha Tinh provinces. 
The 21 September raids were denounced at the higher level of 
a DRV Foreign Ministry statement on the 22d and they prompted 
the communist delegates at the Paris talks to boycott the 
session on the 23d.* The alleged strikes in Ha Tinh ane Lai 
Chau were protested in ministry spokesman's statements on 
16 October and 3 November, respectively. (Other routine 
spokesman's statements since 21 September were issued on 
27 September and 5, 9, and 22 October.) 
The latest protest calls the strikes on 7 and 8 November 
"particularly serious," saying they were against "populated 
areas" around Dong Hol, capital of Quang Binh, and "a number 
of localities" in Nghe An Province, and "caused damage in 
lives and property to the local population." Casualties were 
also mentioned in the 22 September DRV Foreign Ministry 
statement and the spokesman's protest on 3 November. The 
spokesman now says that these "grave acts of war proved that 
the obdurate and war-seeking U.S. imperialists still are 
hatching their schemes of military adventure against the DRV." 
And in standard fashion the protest says the United States 
"must bear full responsibility for the consequences of its 
acts of war against the DRV." 
The p-o*est also notes the alleged downing of two U.S. planes 
in Nghe An on the 8th, which had been reported earlier that 
day 'y Hanoi radio. The earlier broadcasts said that several 
other U.S. planes were damaged, and called the downings a 
"stern warning" by the DRV armed forces and people who would 
punish all U.S. "reckless acts of war" against the DRV. These 
latest claims bring Hanoi's total downed planes to 3,401.** 
* For a discussion of propaganda following those strikes see the 
TRENDS of 22 September, pages 4-6, and 29 September, pages 6-7. 
** At the time of the bombings on 21 September, DRV propaganda 
similarly claimed two planes, bringing the total at that time to 
3,399. That total was incorrectly put at 3,999 on page four of 
the 22 September TRENDS.

The DRV army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the 9th and the party 
organ NHAN DAN on the 10th echo the foreign ministry spokesman's 
claim that the latest air strikes caused "losses in lives and 
property." QUAN DOI NHAN DAN calls the strikes "acts that 
encroached in a very brazen and gross manner" on DRV sovereignty 
and security and says the Nixon Administration had repeatedly 
committed "many war crimes" against the North Vietnamese. Both 
papers round up alleged U.S. action against the North during 
October; they claim, among other things, that strikes were 
carried out on 72 occasions while "B-52's on 33 occasions 
dropped more than 4,000 tons of bombs on Quang Binh and Vinh

30 October in Dien Bien district, Lai Chau Province. 
NHAN DAN says these U.S. "serious acts of war" prove that the 
United States is "planning new military adventures" against 
the DRV, and it cites a Cornell University study as saying that 
"during Nixon's Administration more bombs have been dropped in 
Vietnam than during Johnson's." NHAN DAN, like a Hanoi radio 
comment on the 9th, says that the "new crimes . . . are closely 
connected" with Secretary Laird's re--nt visit to Saigon. And 
both item score Laird' e "arrogant threat that the Unitnd 
States will contivue the bombing as long as it deems necessary." 
MAN DO 1 NHAN DAN claims to see signs of new U.S. "military 
adventures" in the presence of the aircraft carrier 
Constfalation in Indochinese waters as will as the intensification 
of te bombing throughout Indochina during Laird's visit. The 
pape: routinely asserts that no activity will save the U.S. 
position, that the United States was "properly punished" by the 
downing of the two planes and that the northern armed forces 
and people, "constantly vigilant and combat ready, are determined 
to appropriately punish all U.S. acts of war." Similarly, NHAN 
DAN calls the downings "a serious warning" and an "encouragement 
to us to resolutely smash all military adventures" of the United 
States. It says that the armed forces, especially those in the 
military area just north of the demilitarized zone, "will 'lways 
heighten their vigilance and step up their technical and tactical 
training and combat readiness along with other air defense 
activities so that they may win resounding victories under all 
circumstances." 
A Liberation Radio commentary on the 9th condemns the strikes 
and says that for each "aggression" against the North, the South 
Vietnamese "will punish them five or 10 times harder." It adds 
that this warning "has been carried out for many years."

LAIRD TRIP SEEN AS PREPARATION FOR "NEW MILITARY ADVENTURES" 
Vietnamese communist propaganda on Defense Secretary Laird's 
3-6 November visit in Saigon claims that the purpose of his 
stay waE, to prepare for "new military adventures" to expand 
and intensify the war. Laird is also said to have been 
concerned to paint a "rosy picture" of Vietnamization in 
preparation for the President's imminent speech on further 
U.S. troop withdrawals, and to assure President Thieu that 
U.S. aid will not be cut off. In addition to Hanoi and 
Front radio comment on the -Secretary's visit, according to VNA 
press reviews there was comment in the Hanoi papers on 6 and 
8 November. Hanoi radio on the 10th broadcast a QUAN DOI NHAN 
DAN commentary, but it is not yet available in translation, 
Castigating Secretary Laird's trip--and Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff Moorer's visits to Saigon, Phnom Penh, and 
Bangkok--propaganda observes that Laird's previous fact-finding 
trips to Saigon in early 1970 and 1971 were followed by "new 
U.S. acts to step up and expand the war"--the Cambodian 
incursion in 1970 and the Laos campaign early this year. 
Evidence that allied military activities intensified prior to 
Laird's arrival in Saigon was detailed in a 29 October 
Liberation Radio commentary which scored U.S. naval reinforcements, 
ARVN operations with U.S. support, plans to strengthen the 
Cambodian army five-fold, increased aid to Laos, and attacks m 
the DRV. The commentary went on typically to charge that the 
Secretary's visit was aimed at "concocting adventurous and 
reckless schemes to intensify the war and commit more crimes." 
TROOP WITHDRAWAL Linking Laird's trip to the President's 
upcoming announcement on further U.S. 
troop withdrawals, a 9 November LPA commentary typically said 
that "as everyone knows, Laird's trip . . . was aimed at 
creating an optimistic picture to be used by Nixon in a 
forthcoming speech." Declaring that Laird "pretended to be 
deaf and blind to the actual situation," the commentary, also 
carried by Hanoi radio, said that the "colorful picture" the 
Secretary will return with, "as well as Nixon's deceitful 
tricks in his coming sp.:tech, by no means help demonstrate 'good 
will for peace,' 'successful Vietnamization,' or the 'end of 
the U.S. involvement in South Vietnam." 
Comment scored Laird's statement at his press conference on the 
6th about the continued presence of U.S. troops in South Vietnam

for the protection of American forces stationed there. A 
Liberation Radio broadcast on the 7th, for example, asserted 
that this statement "clearly shows to everyone that Nixon's 
boast that all U.S. combat troops will be witharawn from 
South Vietnam is only designed to fool public opinion." 
NHAN DAN CALLS REJECTION OF AID BILL BLOW TO NIXON DOCTRINE 
The 29 October Senate vote against the Administration'd foreign 
aid authorization bill was used as a peg for a genera] attack 
on Nixon's policy in the 2 November NHAN DAN. The article 
written by Nguyen Huu Chinh--an author who frequently comments 
or U.S. affairs*--was reviewed by VNA on the 2d and broadcast 
by Hanoi radio on the 3d. Chinh said that while the President 
has described the vote as resulting from a temporary alliance 
of dovish senators who oppose the Vietnam war and conservatives 
who resented the anti-U.S. vote in the United Nations on the 
China issue, in fact the vote "has brought into bold relief 
the thoughts, doubts, and worries which are torturing millions 
of Americans in the face of the Nixon Administration's foreign 
and domestic policies." The author added that the senators 
are using their rights with respect to the budget as a tool to 
oppose a foreign policy "which is not in accordance with the 
actual and lasting interests of the United States. In reality, 
the question of whether or not the foreign aid program should 
be continued has become a sharp conflict." 
The NHAN DAN commentator declared that the "lackeys" whose 
survival depends on U.S. aid become a "support for U.S. 
imperialism to carry out its expansionist policy and that the 
foreign aid program has become more important since the 
appearance of the Nixon Doctrine." He went on to comment that 
* Most recently, Nguyen Huu Chinh discussed the President's 
15 August, 9 September, and 7 October remarks on his new 
economic policies in NHAN DOT articles on 13 September and 
13 Octo5er. In a 4 June NHAN DAN article, pegged to the 
President's 1 June press conference, Chinh also discussed the 
U.S. ec,nomy and claimeA that "the American people's crisis of 
confidence has become a major threat to Nixon's political life." 
Chinh also had articles on the congressional elections in 1970 
as well as the Presidential campaign in 1968.

the Aiministration has not tried to cover up the purpose of the 
Nixon Doctrine, which he said is aimed among other things "at 
sowing dissension in the socialist camp." (During the height 
of the July-August anti-Chinese polemic, the Nixon Doctrine was 
repeatedly described as aimed at splitting the socialist 
countries, but this claim has appeared only infrequently since 
then.) 
Chinh called the oenate vote "a quite devastating blow" to the 
Nixon Doctrine. And he said that while it is evident that not 
all senators shared Fulbright's opinion that the Administration 
is using it "as a main weapon in the cold war," it is "obvious" 
that U.S. flexibility is now limited. The author observed 
that the defeated bill dealt only with a small part of the total 
U.S. foreign aid: A large number of programs are camouflaged 
under different names and are beyond the control of Congress and 
large sums of military aid remain intact, "especially U.S. 
military aid funds for the U.S. puppet administrations in 
Saigon, Phnom Penh, and Vientiane." He said that the 
Administration will use every means to restore the rejected 
expenditures, but concluded that the vote on 29 October 
"reminds Nixon that he is facing strong opposition from Congress." 
OCTOBER REVOLUTION KEYNOTE SPEECH REAFFIRMS SOVIET SUPPORT 
Soviet determination to continue assistance to the Vietnamese 
was routinely reiterated in propaganda on the October Revolution 
anniversary. Politburo member Grishin declared in his keynote 
address that the Soviet Union has given Vietnam economic and 
military aid and will continue to do so. .:he new aid agreements 
signed with the DRV during Podgornyy's visit to Hanoi last 
month, he said, w.:re "a clear testimony to the consistent 
implementation of the great principles of socialist internationalism 
by our party and the Soviet people." And in reviewing Soviet 
leaders' recent foreign travels as an implementation of the USSR's 
"peace program," he called Podgornyy's DRV visit a "new striking 
confirmation of our unbreakable friendship and fraternal 
cooperation with that heroic country." 
Grishin delivered a mild, pro forma attack on U.S. Indochina policy. 
Observing that the Soviet Union supports the "heroic" people of 
Vietnam and othet Indochina countries in iheir struggle against the 
"American aggressors" and backs the PRG's seven-point peace proposal, 
he said "facts show that the American ruling circles" do not want 
to seek a political solution: "The United States is torpedoing the 
Paris talks and is not stopping the barbaric bombing raids over the 
DRV."

Grishin avoided the usual attack on the U.S. Vietnamization 
policy, where in last year's October Revolution anniversary 
speech Suslov had scored the Vietnamization policy and 
American "aggression" in Laos and Cambodia. Grishin's 
language also contrasts with Suslov's specific attack on the 
U.S. "Government" for "resorting to all sorts of devices" in 
trying to Vietnamize the conflict or Americanize the settle-
ment. As might have been expected during his Hanoi visit, 
Podgornyy in several speeches denounced U.S. operations in 
South Vietnam, the bombings of the DRV, and aggression in Laos 
and Cambodia as well as the "Guam doctrine" and the pacification 
policy, and asserted that the peoples of Indochina will make 
Vietnamization a failure. 
CAMBODIAN NATIONAL DAY: CHOU, SIHANOUK SPEAK IN PEKING 
PEKING CELEBRATIONS As in 1970, Peking marked the anniversary 
of Cambodian independence (9 November) 
with a message from Tung Pi-wu and Chou En-lai to Sihanouk and 
Penn Nouth, a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, and speeches by Chou 
and Sihanouk. The latter two spoke at a Peking rally last year; 
this time they spoke at a reception hosted by Sihanouk. A 
Pekiig "report meeting" attended by Li Hsien-nien was held this 
year, with Ieng Sary, "special envoy" of the "interior part" of 
the RGNU, reporting on the military and political successes of 
Sihanouk's front and government. 
Consistent with Peking's current political and diplomatic posture, 
Chinese statements on the Cambodian anniversary omit former 
formulations prescribing protracted war in Indochina and 
denouncing U.S. "counterrevolutionary dual tactics." Thus the 
PRC leaders' message to the Cambodians, as well as similar 
messages on DRV National Day (2 September) and Laotian 
Independence Day (12 October), omitted the call for perseverance 
in protracted people's war that figured in all three messages 
last year. The formula on protracted war disappeared from 
Chinese comment in the wake of the Lam Son 719 operation in 
southern Laos and the emergence of a notably confident portrayal 
of the Indochinese situation as "unprecedentedly fine." 
Similarly, Peking in recent months has been accenting the positive 
regarding an Indochinese peace settlement, with endorsements of 
the peace proposals of its allies and clients replacing its former 
attacks on U.S. proposals. Where Chou last year took the occasion 
of the Cambodian anniversary to deprecate President Nixon's

proposals, this year he expressed support for Sihanouk's 
five-point declaration, the PRG's seven-point peace proposal, 
and the five-point program of the NLHS. 
Chou avoided any direct attack on the Nixon Administration, 
but he took the opportunity to voice Peking's line on a growing 
unity among "medium and small countries" in opposition to the 
superpowers. Observing that the world is in the midst of "a 
violent upheaval" and taking note of the UN vote for seating the 
PRC, Chou intoned that "the superpowers are finding it more 
and more difficult to practice power politics and hegemony 
and engage in their truculent acts of bullying and butchering 
weak and small nations will." 
In his reception speech Sihanouk typically expressed concern 
over a possible accommodation on Cambodia, rebuking "foreign 
governments and circles" for recommending a "so---illed 'political' 
solution." He once again rejected the idea of "a 'new Geneva 
conference' or a political solution," claiming that President 
Nixon alone holds the key to a settlement and must stop his 
interference in Cambodian internal affairs. Unlike last year, 
Chci! did not echo Sihanouk's denunciation of a conference. 
Last year Chou accused the United States and its "collaborator" 
of "scheming to carve up Cambodia." 
Ieng Sary's report to the Peking meeting contained an allusion 
to President Nixon's projected visit to the PRC in the course 
of an attack on alleged U.S. schemes for new aggression. 
He warned that "though U.S. imperialism is compelled to come 
to China with a white flag," it continues its "vicious 
intrigues" of denying the rights of weak and small countries 
and is resorting to "new trickery" to deceive world public 
opinion. This rather surprising passage, which might be read 
as an expression of concern--shared by the Vietnamese 
communists*--over the effect of the Nixon visit, was included 
in NCNA's account of the spee:h. This represents the first 
public reference to the President's visit--albeit without 
mentioning the President directly--to have been made in Peking. 
Sihanouk's remarks on the visit last summer were in a message 
released while he was in North Korea. Apart from reports on 
the Kissinger missions, the only references to the President's 
visit which have appeared in PRC media have been attributed to 
foreign sources. 
* Peking and Hanoi media have reported that Ieng Sary arrived 
in Hanoi on 10 November at the head of a FUNK/RGNU delegation 
for a "friendship visit."

MOSCOW Attention to the Cambodian anniveraary in Soviet media 
was confined last year to routine-level radio 
commentaries broadcast in Cambodian and in Mandarin to South Asia. 
This year Moscow publicized a "day of solidarity," and TASS 
reported that a meeting of the "Moscow public" was held on the 
9th but failed to mention the sponsors or name any speakers. 
TASS said that the Moscow meeting approved a telegram to the 
FUNK Central Committee condemning the aggrcssion of "the U.S. 
imperialists and their flunkeys" and pledging that the Soviet 
people will always "be on the side of peoples fighting for their 
freedom and independence, for peace, democracy, and social 
progress." A TASS commentary on the 8th also mentioned the FUNK, 
saying that it is leading and directing "this truly people's war." 
The commentary also said the FUNK has united "the patriots of the 
country" aad praised its political program for a "fair and 
peaceful settlement" of the Cambodian problem. Moscow's anniversary 
propaganda last year did not mention the FUNK, merely noting that 
the "Cambodian People's Liberation Armed Forces" were fighting 
imperialism. Soviet media, of course, mention neither Sihanouk 
nor his government. 
In his speech in Peking Sihanouk made one of his recurrent 
pointed alluskions to Soviet refusal to recognize the RGNU, noting 
that 28 (ountries have recognized his government and calling on 
"other countries and governments who are sincerely friendly to 
our people and sincerely love justice, democracy, freedom, and peace 
to kindly give their official recognition to the RGNU." 
VIETNAMESE Greetings messages were sent to Sihanouk and Penn 
COMMUNISTS Nouth by DRV President Ton Due Thang and Premier 
Pham Van Dong and by PRG leaders Nguyen Huu Tho 
and Huynh Tan Phat. This year ai last, a NHAN DAN article praised 
the Cambodian people's accomplishments in the struggle against the 
"U.S. imperialist aggressors" and their "lackeys" and pledged 
continued Vietnamese support in accordance with Ho Chi Minh's 
testament and the joint statement of the Indochinese People's 
Summit Conference. 
Hanoi again marked the anniversary with a "solidarity week," but 
there was apparently no Hanoi meeting. Last year a meeting was 
sponsored by the DRV Fatherland Front and Afro-Asian Solidarity 
Committee. A statement by an official of the two organizations 
was broadcast this year, praising the victories of the Cambodian 
people and pledging Vietnamese solidarity. The NFLSV Central 
Committee and the South Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of 
World Peace held a meeting similar to one held last year.

CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT TROOPS SAID TO SUFFER HEAVY LOSSES 
Communist comment on the war in Indochina focuses on the 
fighting along Cambodian Highway 6, where communist forces urn 
credited with inflicting heavy casualties on Phnom Penh troops 
taking part in the Chenla It operation. An 8 November report by 
Sihanouk's news agency, AKI, on the most recent fighting claims 
that in the 10 days from 26 October to 4 November the Cambodian 
National People's Liberation Armed Forces (CNPLAF) on Highway 6 
killed or wounded 3,100 troops and captured 210. The r?port says 
7,800 government troops have been killed since the launching of 
Chenla II on 21 August. 
The CNPLAF's "frustration" of the Chenla II operation was hailed 
in the Hanoi press on 5 November. An editorial in NHAN DAN on 
the 5th noted that the announced purpose of Chenla II was to 
ease communist pressure on Kompong Thom city,* but it went on to 
claim that the operation was in fact aimed "at cutting off the 
transportation route of the CNPLAF and at attacking and occupying 
the liberated areas." 
NHAN DAN's editorial underscored the.massive nature of the 
operation--involving, it said, 70 battalions and about 20,000 
men, supported by U.S. aircraft. Citing Western news reports 
to document its failure, the editorial said AFP reported that 
U.S. commanders were "panic-stricken" in the face of government 
defeats and not only continued their air support but also sent 
officers to the area to study the situation. Other communist 
comment, including the LPA commentary on the 5th, has charged 
directly that U.S. officers are in command of the operation. 
PARIS: COMMUNISTS IGNORE U.S. REMARKS ON DANDLING POW MAIL 
Vietnamese communist media have not acknowledged Ambassador 
Porter's remarks in a preliminary statement at the 4 November 
session of the Paris talks on the sharp decrease in the volume 
of mail received from American prisoners of war held by the DRV. 
* Phnom Penh's announcement in mid-October that Highway 6 had 
been opened to Kompong Thom was ridiculed in a 16 October AKI 
commentary which maintained that, on the contrary, the road 
"has been cut in several places and the CNPLAF have relentlessly 
trounoed-the enemy there."

PRC - PAKISTAN 
BHUTTO VISIT NETS PAKISrAN LIMITED PEKING COMMITMENT 
Ali Bhutto's apparently hastily arranged 5-8 November "friendly 
visit" to Peking "at the invitation of the Chineee Government" 
yielded a limited and ,:arefully measured commitment et Chinese 
support for Pakistan in its confrontation with India over the 
East Bengal problem. The trip by Bhutto, leader of the West 
Pakistan-based People's Party, was likely intended as a 
counterweight to the recent show of Soviet support for India 
and to Indira Gandhi's "information trip" to a number of Western 
capitals, including Washington. But while gaining a reaffirma-
tion of Chinese support after a period of silence, the Pakistanis 
did not receive pledges going beyond Peking's previous stand. 
During the visit the Chinese refrained from abusive anti-
Indian comment beyond pro forma charge.. of interference in 
internal Pakistani affairs, glossed over the contentious 
issues in East Pakistan, and pledged their support in vague 
terms contingent on "foreign aggression" against Pakistan. 
Most notably, the Chinese called for a peaceful settlement of 
the Indian-Pakistani conflict. 
Since the onset of the crisis last March Peking has taken a 
notably low posture ou the tense Indian-Pakistani silmation 
stemming from the civil war in East Bengal and the resulting 
flow of refugees into India. Peking has not discussed the 
details of the crisis in East Bengal; it did not publicly 
acknowledge messages of support to Pakistani President Yahya 
Khan reported by Pakistani and Indian sources to have been 
sent by Mao and Chou En-lai in mid-April; it has not 
mentioned the flow of refugees to India; and it has not 
reported the Soviet-Indian treaty. Moreover, while Chinese. 
media earlier had periodically reported Pakistani protests 
to India charging hostile military activities, they have not 
done so since 20 August. 
Peking has been careful to avoid taking an inflammatory line 
during a period in which it has continued to make gestures 
toward India as part of its broadening diplomatic moves. 
Recently, for example, an Indian table tennis team arrived 
in the PRC to take part in an Afro-Asian tournament, and 
NCNA carried Indira Gandhi's message of congratulations on 
the UN vote for seating the PRC.

The Pakistan delegation, which was heavily militaTy in composition, 
held talks with Chou and Acting Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei in 
what NCNA termed "a friendly atmosphere." According to an NCNA 
account of a banquet given by Bhutto on the 7th, Chou said in a 
toast that the talks "on questions of common interest have 
achieved satisfactory results"; and Bhutto was quoted as 
expressing "satisfaction with the current visit," adding that 
"we had extremely fruitful discussions and are returning to 
Pakistan with complete satisfaction." However, no communique 
was issued, no military or economic agreement was announced, 
and there was no across-the-board Chinese endorsement of the 
Pakistani position. Peking carried no editorial comment on the 
visit. 
INDIAN ROLE Peking's carefully measured commitment to 
Pakistan was reflected in the relatively 
temperate remarks by Chi Peng-fei. According to NCNA's 
account of a banquet he hosted on the 7th for the Pakistani 
delegation, Chi dwelt only briefly on India, observing that 
the Indian Government "has crudely interfered in Pakistan's 
internal affairs" and has "carried out subversive activities 
and military threats against Pakistan by continuing to exploit 
the East Pakistan question." 
This contrasted with Bhutto's anti-Indian tirade when, in his 
speech, he condemned the Indian Government's "activities to 
disintegrate and subvert Pakistan"--specifying that it was 
persisting in "training, arming, and launching infiltrators 
and saboteurs" against Pakistan--and charged that India "has 
encouraged, incited, and financed a secessionist movement to 
strike at the roots of our country." Describing "feverish" 
Indian military activities, such as the deployment of its armed 
forces "including heavy armor and artillery and aircraft" 
along both borders with Pakistan in an effort "to intimidate 
us," BhuLto concluded that "India is planning to achieve its 
objective against Pakistan through armed conflict." 
EAST PAKISTAN Chi maintained that "the East Pakistan question" 
QUESTION is the "internal affair" of Pakistan and called 
for a "reasonable settlement" by "the Pakistani 
people themselves." In a platitudinous tone, he asserted that 
"the broad masses of the Pakistani people are patriotic and 
they want to safeguard national unity and unification of the 
country, and they oppose internal split and outside interference."

During the course of developing tensions Peking has largely 
avoided addressing the East Pakistan problem as such, referring 
only occasionally to "secessionist Elements" while focusing on 
alleged Indian and great-powar inter2erence in Pakistan's 
internal affairs. Regarding the lat:er, Chi declared that "it 
is absolutely impermissible for any foreign country to carry 
out interference and subversioa under any pretext," adding--
in an apparent allusion to the Soviets--that "certain persons 
are truculently exerting pressure on Pakistan by exploiting 
tension in the subcontinent in a wild attempt to realize 
their ulterior motives." Similarly, Bhutto expressed regret 
that "some countries" have "succumbed to Indian propaganda 
and pressure" and noted that India "openly asserts that she 
has acquired massive arms and boasts that she would not be 
alone in conflict against Pakistan." Neither speaker 
specifically mentioned the Soviet Union and neither referred 
to the Soviet-Indian treaty. 
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT While maintaining that the East 
Pakistan problem is an internal 
Pakistani matter, Chi expressed Peking's concern over the 
possibility of major hostilities erupting. The Chinese 
government and people "are greatly concerned over the present 
tension in the subcontinent," according to Chi, wt) said the 
Chinese position is that "disputes between states should be 
settled by the two sides concerned through consultations and 
not by resorting to force." The reference to "consultations"--
rather than to negotiations--suggests Chinese care to avoid 
overstepping the line that it is up to the Pakistanis 
themselves to settle the basic question. Offering further 
support to Pakistan, Chi urged compliance with "the reasonable 
proposal" by President Yahya Khan for mutual Indian-Pakistani 
troop withdrawal from the border as a means of "easing tension 
in the subcontinent." 
Regarding possible hostilities, the Chinese were careful in 
pledging continued support for Pakistan. Chi assured his 
guests that "should Pakistan be subjected to foteign aggression, 
the Chinese Government and people will, as always, resolutely 
support the Pakistani Government and people in their just 
struggle to defend their state sovereignty and national 
independence." This reflected no movement on Peking's side 
from the position stated in the 11 April PEOPLE'S DAILY 
Commentator article that the Chinese Government and people 
"will, as always, resolutely support the Pakistan Government 
and people in their just struggle for safeguarding national 
independence and state sovereignty and against foreign 
aggression and interference."

The absence of stronger Chinese pledges of support seemed 
reflected in Bhutto's remarks that Pakistan was prepared to 
defend itself. Declaring that if Pakistan is attacked "we 
shall not be found wanting in defending our honor and our 
homes," Bhutto simply expressed "appreciation and gratitude 
for the understanding and support which the government and 
people of China have shown" and noted that Chinese "friendship 
and support will continue to be a source of inspiration and 
strength to all of us." Bhutto did not echo his host's 
appeal for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.

USSR-CZECHOSLOVAKI Pi 
SOVIET AMBASSADOR CALLS FOR STEPPED-UP ATTACK ON "RIGHTISTS" 
Addressing a rally held in Prague on 4 November to mark the October 
Revolution anniversary, Soviet Ambassador Chervonenko seemed to go 
out of his way to. suggest that the Czechoslovak communists were not 
moving with sufficient vigor to quell persisting "rightist" 
opposition. In his speech on the same occasion a year ago, 
Chervonenko had been more sanguine on the CPCZ's prospects for 
successfully overcoming the influence of the ousted liberal 
forces. 
The ascendant position of the conservatives in the CSSR is 
underscored by the fact that the October Revolution keynote 
address has been delivered for two successive years by a major 
conservative figure in the party leadership--Vasil Bilak in 
1970 and Alois Indra this time. Indra, elevated to full membership 
in the Politburo in February, heads the Central Election Commission 
which is in charge of the long-delayed elections to the country's 
governmental bodies, to be held this month. Faced with public 
apathy and hostility, the regima has emphasized in its propaganda 
a need to combat the still not fully vanquished right wing. The 
propaganda has for the most part been couched in general terms, 
with the inimical forces unspecified, although the party organ 
RUDE PRAVO reacted directly on 25 September to the publication of 
an antiregime interview by the liberal Josef Smrkovsky--still 
living in Czechoslovakia--in the Milan weekly GIORNI-VIE NUOVE 
on the 16th. 
At the 4 November rally, broadcast live in the Prague domestic 
service, Chervonenko registered a pro forma observation that the 
Czechoslovak communists "have withstood the tests" and "foiled 
the counterrevolutionary plots," then procceded to discourse at 
length on the urgency of a more intensive ideological struggle. 
He reminded his hosts of the stand taken by the 14th CPCZ Congress 
in May to the effect that "there remain not a few problems and 
difficulties which must be overcome in order to completely 
eliminate the consequences of the activity of rightwing revisionists 
and antisocialist elements in Czechoslovakia in various spheres of 
party, state, and economic construction, as well as in the sphere 
of ideology." In his speech a year ago, the ambassador had merely 
expressed "understanding" of the difficulties facing the 
Czechoslovaks in the antirightist struggle and a "conviction" that 
they would succeed.

Chervonenko went on to lecture this time that the "lessons" 
drawn by the Czechoslovak communists "make it imperative to 
understand that Lenin's warning--that the struggle against 
opportunism requires utmost revolutionary firmness and that 
no compromise is admissible--has enormous fundamental 
significance today even more than ever before." Pressing the 
point, he recalled Lenin's warning to a Czechoslovak communist, 
Smeral, that "nobody should be forgiven anything," that 
"I . . . cannot forgive your moderation, consideration for 
your political opponents. Change your attitude, fight, and 
reject?ruthlessly reject--any policy of compromise," which 
"undermines the workers' movement and leads it toward social 
democracy." 
Underscoring the CSSR's reintegration into the Soviet bloc, 
Chervonenko noted "the consistent consolidation and constantly 
growing friendship between Czechoslovakia and its socialist 
allies, Czechoslovakia's loyalty to the Warsaw Pact--all this 
is a worthy response to the enemies of socialism." Protection 
of the CSSR against its "opponents," he added, is also provided 
by the Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship treaty of May 1970. He 
recalled, in this connection, that "at a time of trials and a 
crisis-ridden development of Czechoslovakia, the aktivists of 
Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship were in the front ranks of the 
struggle against rightist revisionism, anti-Soviet elements, and 
the counterrevolution." 
Neither Chervonenko nor Indra explicitly recalled the "fraternal 
assistance" provided Czechoslovakia in August 1968; both 
Chervonenko and Bilak had used the term at last year's October 
Revolution meeting in Prague.* Chervonenko this year cited the 
"truly acute political crisis in 1968 and 1969," and Indra 
employed a generalized formulation to the effect that revisionist 
reformers of 1968 had "failed precisely because the Soviet Union 
and the other fraternal socialist countries and the loyal 
Czechoslovak communists and other patriots are guided by the 
behest of the Great October and with honor and in practice 
implement the principles of Leninist teachings." In the same 
vein, Indra added that "the more time separates us from August 
* The October Revolution anniversary message from the 
Czechoslovak leaders to their Soviet counterparts this year, as 
last year, recalls the CzechoEdovak "crisis" but does not 
directly mention the August 1968 intervention.

In Hungary in 1956 or three yea ago here in Czechoslovakia." 
He thanked "Comrade Brezhnev personally for the enormous work 
carried out in the interest of all mankind" in the current 
Soviet peace offeneive. 
Indra and Chervonenko both regiatered correct tributes to the 
stewardship of Gustav Husak ea CPCZ First Secretary since 
April 1969, and both pointedly quoted the CPCZ leader on the 
score of relations with the USSR. Indra said "we agreed from 
the bottom of our hearts with Comrade Husak, who stated on 
returning from the 24th CPSU Congress: 'Whoever does not have 
good relations with the Soviet Union does not have good relations 
with our socialist syetem or with his own people." The Soviet 
ambassador prefaced his call for a stepped-up CPCZ ideological 
struggle with the remark that "rightw.ing opporLuniam and 
reisionism, as our recent ellperience has convincingly confirmed, 
said Comrade Gustav Husak at rhe 14th CPCZ Congress, inevitably 
culminates in overt betrayal of socialism and the revolutionary 
workers movement and in overt adoption of anticommunist, anti-Soviet 
positions."

TOPIC IN BRIEF 
AMCHITKA NUCLEAR TEST 
TASS predictably highlighted continuing worldwide protests, 
notably from Jnpnn and Canada, in reporting the 6 November 
detonation of a U.S. nuclear device on Amchitka istend in the 
Aleutians. In its first ....eport on the detonation, noting U.S. 
Government efforts to "play down" the dangers, TAS 'd citcd the 
New York TIMES to point to "the great risk not only for the 
environment but also for world peace"; on the 9th it pointed 
to "confirmation" of U.S. scientists' apprehensions about 
damage to the environment. Soviet reportage in the preceding 
weeks had been featuring Japanese and Canadian protests as well 
as efforts in Congress and the U.S. scientific community to 
get the test called off. But Soviet comment anticipating the 
teal was negligible and routine. The official Soviet attitude 
was publicized in a TASS report of UN delegate Malik's remarks 
In the UNGA's First Committee on 28 October reiterating the 
call for an underground nuclear test ban and stating that the 
Soviet Government "fully shared the concern and alarm" of the 
Canadian Government. 
There has been no Moscow comment on the subject since 6 November. 
By contrast, the last U.S. nuclear test in the Aleutians, on 
2 October 1969, occasioned an IZVESTIYA article the same day 
charging that the test was linked to the development of warheads 
for ABM's and MIRV's and was another step toward accelerating 
the arms race.
