 Egypt is taking a hopeful but cautious approach to
 recent contacts with the USSR. The Egyptians seem anxious that
 the new US administration take note of these contacts but not
 interpret them as indicating a radical swing back to close ties
 The Egyptians are seeking a resumption of arms
 deliveries, or at least a regular flow of spare parts,  from
 the USSR, and they also want the US to know that they are.
 At the same time, Egyptian leaders are anxious to
 avoid overplaying their hand and thus giving the US the im-
 pression that they have written off the US as a useful ally
 under president-elect Carter's administration. Fahmi,  for
 instance, has attempted in conversations with Ambassador Eilts
 to downplay the significance of Egyptian-Soviet contacts.
 The Egyptians actually do want more amicable ties
 with the USSR, but with minimal political strings. President
 Sadat told the new Egyptian cabinet on Wednesday that he welcomes
 improved relations with the Soviets, but that "he who wants to
 deal with us must deal with us as we are and not as he wants
 us to be."
 Italian Prime Minister Andreotti survived a parlia-
 mentary confidence vote on his latest austerity proposals yes-
 terday, mainly because he declined to make a specific proposal
 on the controversial problem of how to limit soaring labor costs.
 Andreotti instead called for industry and for organized labor--
 in which the Communist Party plays a leading role--to come up
 with a negotiated solution within a month.
 The measures that were approved, such as a requirement  25X1
 that companies and the self-employed prepay a substantial por-
 tion of their taxes each year,  are designed to raise to about
 $6 billion the amount that the government plans to take in
 through the austerity program. Earlier measures consisted mainly
 of price hikes on a wide variety of public services and govern-
 ment-controlled commodities.

 These steps, aimed at curbing the government's deficit,
 will not by themselves solve Italy's economic problems. A way
 must also be found to diminish the inflationary impact of the
 wage indexation system, under which the wages of most workers
 rise automatically in response to any increase registered by the
 cost-of-living index. Most observers,  including Italy's potential
 foreign creditors such as the EC, maintain that modification of
 this system is essential to the success of the stabilization
 effort.
 Andreotti's reluctance to submit to Parliament his wage
 proposa s--one of which calls for freezing or reducing automatic
 increases for the upper 20 percent of wage earners--stems from
 the stiff resistance from the trade unions. Many labor leaders
 were at first inclined toward some flexibility on the wage es-
 calator but, in response to growing opposition from the workers,
 union leaders now reject any change in the system. Thus, had
 Andreotti insisted that Parliament consider the wage issue this
 week, he would have forced the Communists to choose between
 offending their rank and file in the labor movement or bringing
 down the government, which the Communists do not want to do in
 present circumstances.
 By calling on industry and labor to negotiate a solu-
 tion to the wage issue, Andreotti has placed on the Communists
 much of the burden for working out a policy in this key area. As
 the most influential party in the labor movement,  the Communists
 will play a major role in these negotiations.
 While labor leaders appear united in their opposition
 to changes in the wage indexation system itself, they are di-
 vided over how far to go in limiting wage costs through other
 means. Communist union leaders, along with moderate elements in
 the Christian Democratic and other unions,  are advocating a co-
 operative posture, while another group,  led chiefly by Socialist
 union officials,  is taking a tough line.
 This situation holds both opportunities and risks for
 the Communists. If, for example, the party can deliver labor
 cooperation in reducing wage costs, it will be able to claim
 substantial credit for any success the austerity program achieves.
 On the other hand, their advocacy of significant wage restraints

 would probably subject the Communists to more internal dissent--
 a problem that has become increasingly bothersome for the party
 as its cooperation with the government has grown. In that case,
 the Communist leaders would be looking for opportunities to ob-
 tain further concessions from the government to blunt criticism
 from their followers.
 SPAIN:  Opposition,  Reform Program
 The Spanish government appears increasingly confi-
 dent that its constitutional reforms will be approved by par-
 liament without major revision.
 There are signs that the government has been
 busy   e in     e scenes applying pressure to the 300-odd fence-
 sitters in parliament.  //Deputy Prime Minister Osorio recently
 confided to a US official that the legislation has been indi-
 vidually discussed and "negotiated" with almost every member
 of parliament.//
 The parliamentary subcommittee, which has been con-
 sidering the bill, rejected ultra-rightist amendments and, in
 its report yesterday, made only a few minor changes to the gov-
 ernment's bill. The full legislature will begin debating the
 bill on Tuesday,  and president of parliament Fernandez Miranda
 said the debate might continue past November 20, the first an-
 niversary of Generalissimo Franco's death.  Rightists are plan-
 ning massive demonstrations for November 20, but there have
 been reports that Fernandez Miranda might call for an early
 vote to avoid the possibility that police action against the
 right might influence parliament's decision.
 The opposition continues to be divided over how to
 respond to the reform program.  Some leftists are threatening
 to boycott the government's next step--the referendum on the
 reforms approved by parliament--unless various conditions are
 met. The demands include legalization of the Communist Party.
 The more moderate leftists apparently will not sup-
 port a campaign for abstention from the referendum unless the
 rightist parliament significantly waters down the reforms. Al-

 Approved For Release 2008/07/01: CIA-RDP79T00975A029500010024-8
 though abstention by other leftist groups probably would not
 jeopardize approval of the referendum measures, it could under-
 mine the government's effort to obtain a large popular vote
 for its reform program.
 The threat to abstain was first issued late last
 week by the recently formed Platform of Democratic Organiza-
 tions, a loose alliance of six leftist coalitions that in-
 cludes Socialists but is apparently dominated by Communists
 and far-left splinter groups.
 Divisions within the opposition also apparently hin-
 dered the effectiveness of the "Day of Stoppages" held yester-
 day by the illegal labor unions. Although Workers Commission
 leader Camacho said that he expected 2 million workers to re-
 spond to the call,  less than half a million were idled--some
 for only a brief time.
 LEBANON:  Situation Report
 Syrian peacekeeping units have delayed their entry
 into Beirut for at least a day.
 The Syrians may be waiting for contingents from
 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,  apparently due to
 arrive shortly; their presence would give the operation a more
 truly pan-Arab character, and could reduce the danger of inci-
 dents. The delay may also have been ordered at the insistence
 of the Christians, who evidently are pressing the Syrians to
 move into Sidon and Tripoli before they take up their positions
 along Beirut's confrontation line.

 Damascus radio has announced that the locations in
 Beirut where security forces will be stationed include the
 commercial area, the port road, the hotel area, and the suburbs
 of Shiyah and Ayn Rummanah. They probably will take over public
 installations, including radio and television stations.
 Security force commander al-Hajj met with Palestinian
 military leaders on Thursday and asked them to collect all their
 heavy weapons in order to minimize incidents with the advancing
 security troops; he apparently did not ask them to turn the
 weapons in. The fedayeen have been caching their heavy weapons
 in underground depots at the refugee camps south of Beirut
 in an effort to avoid confiscation.
 Fierce fighting and shelling broke out at the museum
 crossing point between the two sides of Beirut late Thursday
 afternoon and early yesterday. Indiscriminate shelling con-
 tinued yesterday on both sides of the city,  as well as its
 southern suburbs. In the south, the Palestinians are saying
 that Israeli artillery and machine gun fire have supported
 Christian attacks near Bint Jubayl for the past three days.
 Heavy shelling also was reported in the north around Majdalaya.
 BANGLADESH:  Regime Marks Anniversary
 The first anniversary of the coup that brought the
 present martial law administration to power in Bangladesh passed
 quietly this week with the government apparently still in firm
 control. The regime showed its increasing self-confidence by
 releasing some 2,500 political prisoners.
 The present stability, which is largely due to good
 harvests and an improved economic situation, could deteriorate
 when full-scale political activity begins for the national elec-
 tion that figurehead President Sayem has promised will be held
 by February. The government has already sanctioned 17 parties,
 representing nearly every major political and religious group,
 to participate in the election. The party of assassinated former
 president Mujib was finally sanctioned last week.

 Political violence among these parties was common be-
 fore last November and may now be re-emerging. Last week, police
 were called in to quell student unrest at Dacca University.
 //Some politicians and many senior military offi-
 cers--possibly including Bangladesh's de facto leader, General
 Zia ur-Rahman--would prefer to defer the election.
 25X1
 25X1
 There probably would be considerable popular sup-
 port for such a move.  Some political groups, however, would un-
 doubtedly oppose a postponement of the national election, and
 they might gain the backing of politically ambitious military
 officers.  Zia probably would attempt to neutralize suspected
 enemies within the military before deferring the election.//
 The Zia regime's main foreign policy concern continues
 to be its troubled relations with India. Border incursions by
 Indian-supported groups and the dispute over India's diversion
 of water from the Ganges River at the Farakka dam site 20 kilo-
 meters  (11 miles)  up river from the border are still the main
 irritants between the two countries.
 Attacks on India in the Dacca press reappeared this
 week after a temporary lull. The resumption is probably designed
 to muster public opinion prior to the discussion of the Farakka
 issue at the UN on Monday.
 I//Greeks and Turks as well as their kinsmen
 in Cyprus look upon the recent US election as a new and impor-
 tant factor in their disputes over Cyprus and the Aegean.//

 Greeks and Greek Cypriots have been buoyed by the
 election results. Nearly all the media, except for the Commu-
 nist newspapers in Greece and Cyprus, have suggested that the
 new administration in Washington will be more sympathetic to
 the Greek side in both the Cyprus and the Aegean disputes.
 Greek and Cypriot officials have been more guarded, but they
 also seem to believe that there will be a noticeable change in
 US policy.
 The Turkish and Turkish Cypriot press, mean-
 while, is asserting that the US would not risk alienating Tur-
 key, an important cornerstone of the Western defense system.
 Interspersed with this line, however, have been expressions of
 concern that the new administration might in some way favor
 the Greeks.   //This concern appears to be shared by Turkish
 and Turkish Cypriot officials.//
 //These attitudes are likely to influence
 the current negotiations on the Aegean and any talks on Cyprus
 in the coming months. The apparent Greek willingness earlier
 this fall to consider making some concessions in the Aegean was
 due partly to heavy Turkish pressure, and partly to what the
 Greeks saw as the lukewarm international response to their ini-
 tiatives in international forums. Although there has been some
 narrowing of differences in the talks on Aegean issues under
 way in Paris and Bern, the Greeks will probably refrain from
 making any major concessions now in the hope that the new US
 administration will be more sympathetic to their position.//
 //The Greek Cypriot leadership also appears
 to expect more US support in the future. Whereas Cypriot
 Foreign Ministry officials had earlier indicated they would
 welcome a US or a joint US - European Community effort to get
 the stalled intercommunal negotiations under way, President
 Makarios has now declared publicly that any such initiatives
 at this time would be inappropriate.//
 //For its part, the weak coalition govern-
 ment in Turkey will find it hard to modify its tough negotiat-
 ing stance on the Aegean or Cyprus, especially in light of the
 approaching campaign for the October 1977 parliamentary elec-
 tion. The Turks,  like Makarios, have reacted coolly to the
 prospect of any US or EC initiative on Cyprus.//

 //In the coming months, however, the Turks
 might mix the prospects of concessions on Cyprus with hints of
 a closer congressional passage of the US-Turkish Defense Cooper-
 ation Agreement. Turkish leaders are undoubtedly aware of the
 risks in overplaying either of these alternatives.//
 //Significant concessions on Cyprus could
 create domestic political setbacks for Turkey's current leaders,
 and despite Foreign Minister Caglayangil's announcement yester-
 day that the USSR has presented a declaration of goodwill and
 friendship for Turkey's signature, no member of the government
 favors a drastic alteration of Turkey's foreign policy orienta-
 tion.//
 CHINA:  Shanghai Radicals
 One of Hua Kuo-feng's earliest victories as China's
 new leader was to bring Shanghai--leftist stronghold and home
 of the "gang of four"--under his control quickly and without
 bloodshed. The general outlines of how Hua fashioned this vic-
 tory can be pieced together from a variety of sources, includ-
 ing wall posters, clandestine reporting, and official radio
 broadcasts.
 On October 7, the day after the arrest of the four
 Shanghai-based leftist Politburo members, Hua hurriedly assem-
 bled his Politburo for an informal meeting to discuss the im-
 mediate action to be taken in leftist power bases--Liaoning
 Province and the city of Shanghai. Hua is said to have argued
 that Shanghai was  "in a quagmire" and must be handled "without
 delay."
 Hua's plan involved the dispatch of a "central work
 team" to Shanghai to secure the loyalty of Shanghai garrison
 troops and pre-empt any leftist attempt to use Shanghai's urban
 militia.  In addition, Shanghai's four senior party secretaries
 were to be summoned to Peking. The moderates in Shanghai, Chou
 Chun-lin, the city's garrison .commander and enemy of Shanghai's
 leftists, and Ma Tien-shui, purged during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, were to go first, followed by the leftists, Hsu Ching-
 hsien and Wang Hsiu-chen. This would give the moderates a chance
 to side with Hua without leftist pressure.

 The moderates went to Peking and were briefed by Hua
 on October 7.  In Shanghai, the two leftists, unaware of the ar-
 rest of the "gang of four," were nevertheless suspicious enough
 to begin drawing up contingency plans for arming the urban mi-
 litia.
 Hua's  "central work team," headed by Su Chen-hua, an       25X1
 alternate Politburo member and deputy commander of the navy,
 and Ni Chih-fu, an alternate Politburo member and Peking party
 secretary, apparently arrived secretly in Shanghai as early as
 October 7 or 8. They probably established a headquarters in the
 Shanghai garrison and began to neutralize the urban militia
 through strategic positioning of regular troops and persuasion
 of militia leaders.
 Once Hua learned from Su and Ni in Shanghai that
 there was no danger of an armed uprising in the city he called
 the two leftists to Peking on October 10. The two moderates,
 meanwhile, had told Hua of the leftists' plan to mobilize the
 militia.// The leftists, however, never mentioned their con-
 tingency plans.
 //By October 14, Hsu and Wang were being denounced
 in wall posters put up throughout Shanghai on a scale not seen
 since the Cultural Revolution. In addition, the largest mass
 rallies in the city since that period began on the same day.
 On October 16, the Shanghai garrison, the city's 16 institu-
 tions of higher learning, and two daily newspapers publicly
 announced their support for Hua.//

 Ma and Chou led a mammoth rally on October 24; Hsu
 and Wang, who had not appeared in public since October 16, did
 not participate. Finally, on October 27, the two moderates were
 joined by the leaders of the central work team at another mam-
 moth rally, which served to put the finishing touches on the
 legitimacy of Shanghai's new leadership.
 Some three weeks after the arrest of the Shanghai-
 based "gang of four," the Central Committee was able to an-
 nounce that three of them--Chang Chun-chiao, Yao Wen-yuan, and
 Wang Hung-wen--had been dismissed from all of their posts in
 Shanghai. They were replaced by members of the central work
 team who had so successfully neutralized the contingency plans
 of the radicals.
 Su was named Shanghai party and government boss,
 while Ni. was appointed second in command of Shanghai's party
 and government. Peng Chung, alternate Central Committee member
 and Kiangsu Province party chief, took over as the city's third-
 ranking party and government leader.
 This new leadership will definitely chart a moderate
 course. While it is not known whether Su and Ni will retain
 their posts at the center, or whether Peng Chung will keep his
 Kiangsu party boss job, it is safe to say that these three will
 share their leadership roles with the two local veterans, Ma
 and Chou, who played such a crucial role in filling in the
 "Shanghai quagmire."
