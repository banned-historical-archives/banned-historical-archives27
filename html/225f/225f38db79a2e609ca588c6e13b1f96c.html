 CHINA: Party Congress Wrap-up
 The 11th congress of the Chinese Communist party,
 held in Peking from August 12-18,  reaffirmed the new leader-
 ship's commitment to order and stability,  rational economic
 growth,   and the primary role in the  leadership for veteran of-
 ficials who had suffered in the past at the hands of the now-
 discredited leftists,
 I      I The new members of the party's ruling Politburo are
 almost exclusively veteran party officials and experienced gov-
 ernment administrators.  Their selection raises the average age
 of the Politburo and reflects the relative shortage of experi-
 enced middle-aged and young officials. Three "new" members
 have been restored to the Politburo status they had held in
 the past but lost to leftists. Others bring to the Politburo
 expertise in science, economic planning, and political problem
 solving.  The new commander of the air force has also been added,
 but the military's representation on this body, as on the newly
 elected central committee,  is not overly conspicuous.
 Chairman Hua Kuo-feng was confirmed as the party's
 leader and delivered the major political address to the con-
 gress. He is joined in the upper reaches of the Politburo by
 four vice-chairmen--Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, rehabili-
 tated Teng Hsiao-ping, vice-premier Li Hsien-nien, and Wang
 Tung-hsing, head of the security forces.  The five make up the
 Politburo Standing Committee.
 I Wang's elevation brings some balance to this group.
 He is undoubtedly being rewarded for the leading role he played
 in the arrest of the leftists, but he seems also to have culti-
 vated by Hua as a counter to Teng Hsiao-ping.  He may also be
 acting as party secretary-general, a position once held by Teng.
 Nevertheless, Teng and his two strong supporters on the Standing
 Committee, Yeh and Li, outrank Wang.  Teng delivered the closing
 address at the congress and was identified as the congress'
 "executive chairman," suggesting he was impresario of the meet-
 ing.
 A major theme of the congress was order and stability.
 In his speech, Hua Kuo-feng redefined "class struggle" in such
 a way as to divorce it from the context of party factionalism,
 Approved For R+Iease 2007/03/06 : CIA-RDP79T00975AOP0300010020-2
 Approved For
 as it had been used in the past decade, and to link it instead
 to the idea of stability bringing "great order" to China. Hua
 specifically stated that "popular feeling favors order" and
 claimed that order and stability were a behest of Mao himself.
 Yeh Chien-ying redefined another favorite leftist phrase--"going
 against the tide"--to mean opposing those things that jeopardize
 party discipline and stability.
 I           IHua Kuo-feng stated that the purge of the leftists
 marked the end of the Cultural Revolution, officially closing
 out that, segment of party history for the first time. Thus, the
 official version of the Cultural Revolution includes not only
 the rise of the leftists and their destruction of the political
 careers of party veterans but the fall of the leftists and the
 subsequent return to order and stability.  The new leadership
 may now praise the Cultural Revolution without seeming to en-
 dorse the disruptive activities usually associated with it.
 I     I The new definition of the Cultural Revolution, espe-
 cia  y terming it the "first" Cultural Revolution, protects the
 leadership from any later charge that it has rejected either
 the Cultural Revolution or Mao Tse-tung's thinking that more
 such revolutions will occur in the future.  The congress,  in
 fact, dealt rather deftly with the Maoist 'Legacy, putting his
 contributions on a par with those of many other communist theo-
 reticians and thus not giving him undue prominence, but also
 using his mantle to justify both the current leadership and
 current policies. Mao's role in unmasking and struggling against
 the leftists was stressed, as was his selection of Hua Kuo-feng
 as his successor.
 The four leftists were the villains of the congress.
 Hua specifically called for a continuing investigation of in-
 dividuals and incidents connected with the four, and the call
 for carrying the struggle against them and their influence "to
 the end" suggests that the purge of leftists is not yet com-
 pleted.  In keeping with the congress'  interest in vindicating
 veteran officials, Hua refuted leftist charges that such offi-
 cials were "bourgeois."
 Most of the documents of the congress emphasized the
 goal of modernizing China's economy by the end of the century.
 This goal was specifically included in the new party constitu-
 tion and was stressed by the speakers at the congress.  Hua

 listed as one of the party's main tasks a further revolution
 in science and technology, education, art, literature, and
 health work, suggesting major departures from the policies of
 the past decade are in the offing.
 I            As expected, the chief revision in the party's con-
 appears to be a provision that tightens up on party
 discipline by making it more difficult to become a party mem-
 ber. A one-year probationary period has been reinstituted and
 special commissions have been set up to "inspect discipline."
 These steps are designed to undo the work of the leftists, who
 have been accused of relaxing membership rules in order to pack
 the party with their supporters. Despite the stricter rules for
 membership, the total membership of the party has risen from 30
 to 35 million.
 Further efforts to right the wrongs perpetrated by
 the leftists were evident in the composition of the new party
 central committee, which, with 333 members,  is the largest ever.
 More than a third of the former members were dropped, most having
 been associated with the leftists. Nearly half of the new com-
 mittee are serving for the first time. Most of these are experi-
 enced party, government, and military officials. Very few are
 representatives of the masses, a ploy popular with the leftists
 to get large numbers of their supporters on that body.
 I           Military representation on the central committee has
 dropped slightly to under 30 percent; this drop is somewhat sur-
 prising given the military's important role in the roundup of
 the leftists. The national military bureaucracy is somewhat
 better represented on this central committee; most of the mili-
 tary cuts came from the provinces, where leftist strength was
 greatest. As before, provincial representatives make up about
 two thirds of the total membership. Four members of the eighth
 central committee, the last before the rise of the leftists,
 were restored to membership on the new committee.
 Foreign policy appears to have been treated only
 briefly at the congress, and then only in Hua Kuo-feng's speech.
 Hua stated that both superpowers are "enemies" but reaffirmed
 that the greater danger comes from the USSR. He endorsed Mao's
 "revolutionary line in foreign policy," a codeword for the open-
 ing to the US. He also endorsed the notion that "factors for
 war" are growing, linking this specifically with the threat
 from the USSR. He suggested that China's foreign policy should
 Approved For
 Approved For
 stress the importance of forming the broadest possible front
 against the superpowers, adding that relations with other coun-
 tries should be based on the five principles of peaceful coex-
 istence.
 I            Hua also specifically reaffirmed the theory of the
 I ,three worlds"--revolutionary, middle, and enemies-thus throwing
 down the ideological gauntlet to the Albanians, who oppose the
 theory and have been particularly upset with China's opening to
 the US. The summary of Hua's speech contained no specifin  osi-
 tive references to the US.

 EGYPT-LIBYA:   Negotiations
 //Egyptian President Sadat told the US ambas-
 sador on Saturday that high-level negotiations may be easing
 Egyptian-Libyan tensions. Libyan President Qadhafi sent a sen-
 ior military officer to Egypt about 10 days ago to work out
 with Egyptian War Minister Gamasy an agreement involving the
 mutual pull-back of troops from the border. Sadat said that
 if Qadhafi accepts the agreement, he will also.//

 //Under the agreement, Libyan troops now in
 t e border area would be withdrawn to Tobruk.  The only Libyan
 military forces between Tobruk and the border would be small
 frontier police units and a small military unit at Musaid.
 Egyptian forces would be pulled back to Sidi Barrani, except
 for a small force that would remain at Solluim.//
 //A timetable for implementin
 th
 g
 e agreement
 will be worked out if both presidents accept it. Sadat told
 Ambassador Eilts that he would accept it, and he thought Qad-
 hafi would as well.//
 //This is the first indication we have had
 f
 o
 negotiations between the two countries at such a high level.
 Kuwaiti and Palestinian mediation efforts have been going on
 for some time, but the only significant results have been a
 stand-down, in propaganda exchanges and the creation of a nar-
 row demilitarized zone along the border.//
 //Sadat's willingness to involve an official
 or   amasy s stature in these negotiations is in line with other
 indications that at least for now he may have given up the idea
 of new hostilities against Libya.
 reover, Ambassador Eilts reports that Sadat seemed
 please   that Egyptian-Libyan tensions appeared to be lessening,
 although Sadat's antipathy toward Qadhafi had not dissipated.//
 Sadat has been under heavy domestic criticism and
 has recently withdrawn from public life for about a month. He
 is almost certainly aware of mounting public concern that Egypt
 has allowed itself to be distracted from its conflict with
 Israel by his preoccupation with ousting Qadh.afi. The agree-
 ment negotiated by Gamasy may indicate that Sadat has taken ac-
 count of these criticisms.

 OPEC:    Current-Account Surplus
 //The OPEC current-account surplus reached $25
 i    ion  i-n  the first half of 1977,  substantially above the $19
 billion of the first half of 1976. A sharp upturn in oil sales,
 especiaZZy to the US, accounted for the lion's share o
 th
 f
 e
 increase.                With oil Ziftings expected to fall off in second
 half of 1977,  the surplus will decline to as little as one
 half the January to June level.//
 //OPEC oil earnings in first half of 1977 climbed
 to a record    67 billion, more than 15 percent above the same
 period last year. About half of the rise reflected higher oil
 prices and the remainder higher crude oil liftings. OPEC oil
 prices in the first half averaged 8 percent more than the 1976
 yearend level.//
 //OPEC oil exports--30 million barrels per day--
 were abnormally high in the first half. Exports usually fall
 after a price increase, as stocks built up in anticipation of
 higher prices are drawn down. After the January price increases,
 however, colder than normal weather kept winter demand high and
 oil companies were still replenishing stocks in the spring.//
 //Imports by OPEC members were $34 billion in the
 first half--up 15 percent from the first half of 1976. The vol-
 ume of goods purchased rose 7 percent, continuing the slackened
 pace evident since spring 1975.  Indeed, the slower intake has
 allowed the mammoth backlogs at OPEC ports to be sharply reduced.
 OPEC import prices were 6 percent above those of the first half
 of 1976, partly reflecting the appreciation of the yen, the
 mark, and other currencies against the dollar.//

 piuses in the first half of 1977.  Saudi Arabia once again led

 Consumers are expected to draw down their unusually high oil
 stocks in the third quarter, and non-OPEC supplies--Alaskan
 North Slope and North Sea--will be rising throughout the six-
 month period. OPEC imports are assumed to continue to climb at
 the moderate pace of recent months. This would yield a second
 half surplus of $12 billion to $15 billion, depending on how
 oil demand is affected by winter weather and by how much com-
 panies build stocks in the last quarter in anticipation of a
 possible price rise after January 1, 1978.//
 //Indonesia, Nigeria, and Venezuela probably will
 move into   e red in the second half. Although Saudi Arabia is
 expected to absorb by far the largest share of the export cut,
 its oil revenues will remain at first-half levels because Riyadh
 hiked prices by 5 percent on July 1.//
 /For the year as a whole, the current-account
 surplus is li ely to run from $37 billion to $40 billion, ap-
 proximately the same as in 1976. With OPEC oil export volume
 remaining at the same level in both years, the higher oil prices

 EAST GERMANY - WEST GERMANY:   Talks
 //The initial "soundings" that took place between
 East and West German negotiators in Bonn Last week are slated
 to resume on August 25.  According to West German negotiator
 Hans-Juergen Wischnewski, he and his East German counterpart,
 Michael Kohl, conducted the talks in a "businesslike" manner
 and made clear their mutual desire to play down their most
 obvious differences.  The West Germans still believe more than
 two exploratory sessions may be necessary before substantive
 talks on the many issues can begin.//

 //Parallel talks in Berlin on. Monday between rep-
 resentatives of the divided city also succeeded in identifying
 various projects of mutual concern, but the East Germans ducked
 attempts to include humanitarian issues on the agenda. If suc-
 cessful, the initial talks in Bonn and Berlin will produce a
 list or lists of projects and issues for negotiations that may
 drag on for years.//
 //Most of the projects are aimed at improving com-
 ns between the two Germanies and in the, Greater Ber-
 lin area. For example, the East and West German talks will cover
 plans for a new Autobahn linking Hamburg and Berlin, the expan-
 sion of utilities, and environmental issues. The Berlin talks
 involve a new crossing point, canal problems, and construction
 of a new railroad station.//
 //These technical issues, however
 may not be dis-
 ,
 cussed until "matters of principle" have been resolved. These
 issues include the legal position of the East German represen-
 tation in Bonn and the recognition of a separate East German
 nationality. While Bonn may extend some form of diplomatic pri-
 vileges to the East German representatives, the West German
 government is not flexible on the nationality issue.//
 /Numerous humanitarian issues,  involving such
 cases as West Berliners who have been denied entry to East Ber-
 lin, could also stall progress on the technical questions un-
 less they are handled in a separate forum outside the main East-
 West exchange.//
 //Earlier reports indicated Bonn hoped to channel
 humanitarian issues into a separate category for consideration
 at a lower level. Such an arrangement might: relieve some of the
 pressure in the main negotiations and allow more progress on
 the technical issues.//
 //The East Germans,  for their part, have hinted
 recently that political problems should not stand in the way
 of improved economic relations,  suggesting they might be will-
 ing to make some concessions on the humanitarian issues if Bonn
 is willing to pay. Any payments, however, would have to be un-
 publicized or otherwise concealed because the East Germans would
 reject any attem t b   Bonn to link           t.tlements and human-
 itarian .issues.

 JAPAN: Fukuda's ASEAN Trip
 I             Japanese officials are clearly pleased with the re-
 su   s of Prime Minister Fukuda's consultations with the five
 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at their
 summit conference in Kuala Lumpur this month and with the fa-
 vorable reception accorded Fukuda during his subsequent swing
 through their capitals.
 Fukuda's trip to Southeast Asia, the first by a Ja-
 panese prime minister since 1974, was largely designed as a
 renewed sign of Tokyo's interest in the region, where Japan
 plays a major role in the economic life of every country out-
 side Indochina. The discussions with Fukuda were in step with
 ASEAN's steady--if slow--movement toward building a common po-
 sition in trade and aid negotiations with its economic part-
 ners.
 The Prime Minister's trip does not presage any major
 change in Japan's relations with the region. Although Fukuda
 unveiled a variety of aid and investment initiatives during
 his visits to Burma and the ASEAN member states--Malaysia,
 Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines--he gen-
 erally sidestepped ASEAN's pressures for broader gauged eco-
 nomic concessions.
 Fukuda, for instance, raised the possibility of as-
 sisting ASEAN's exports to Japan by expanding Tokyo's general
 system of preferences, but only expressed a willingness to
 "study" ASEAN's proposal for an export stabilization plan.
 ASEAN is asking for a $400-500-million Japanese contribution
 to this plan. Both the powerful finance and agriculture minis-
 tries in Tokyo are opposed, however, and the prospects for
 agreement will be slim when the two sides disctss the plan in
 detail this fall.
 Even so, Japan is willing to pay a price to maintain
 some momentum in its gradually expanding relationship with
 ASEAN. Fukuda, for example, announced Japanese agreement in
 principle to provide up to $1 billion in financing for five
 ASEAN-sponsored industrial development projects. Over the last
 year, the two sides have also broadened their contacts by es-
 tablishing the Japan-ASEAN forum--a permanent venue for eco-
 nomic talks.

 However Tokyo's contribution to ASEAN's development
 plans proceeds, ASEAN's effort to establish a common stand on
 trade and aid negotiations will compel Tokyo to maintain its
 institutional links, if only to monitor the direction of ASEAN's
 deliberations.
 Beyond that, the Japanese probably hope that their
 cooperation with ASEAN will induce other countries to follow
 suit. Given their high economic visibility in Southeast Asia,
 Tokyo would almost certainly be willing to cooperate with the
 US and other developed nations in ASEAN-sponsored projects as
 a means of lowering its profile and sharing costs.
 The Japanese, moreover, have also been pleased with
 ASEAN's conscious effort to avoid creating the impression that
 the organization is--or could become--a new military alignment
 against Hanoi. Concern that too close an identification with
 ASEAN might cast Japan in the role of the successor to the US
 in Southeast Asia in part inhibited Japanese initiatives toward
 the organization two years ago.  Tokyo now comfortably accepts
 ASEAN's own definition of cooperation--as a means to advance
 stability in the region by solving social and economic problems.
 Given the success of Fukuda's trip, Tokyo may also
 reconsider the prospects for an attempt at improving its rela-
 tions with Hanoi. Although relations with ASEAN.are certain to
 remain Japan's primary focus in Southeast Asia,, Foreign Minis-
 try officials are hopeful that they can make gradual progress
 in improving trade relations with Indochina. Hanoi's unwilling-
 ness to assume responsibility for some $50 million in South
 Vietnamese debts to Japan has so far impeded negotiations on a
 bilateral aid and trade package.                                                   25X1
