 Vietnam:
 South Vietnams   No significant ground actions
 were reported on-7-4 November.
 President Thieu is generally discouraging street
 demonstrations; he believes that the government does
 not need to whip up additional popular support now
 for its position opposing talks with National Lib-
 eration Front representatives.   The Catholic Greater
 Solidarity Force nevertheless was given permis-
 sion to hold a large meeting on 5 November and an es-
 .timated 3,000 paraded past the US Embassy en route
 to the gathering.   Permission was also given for a
 delegation to go to Independence Palace with a state-
 ment of support for the government.   The Saigon gov-
 ernment built a barricade in front of the US Embassy,
 probably in order to provide an atmosphere of tension
 for the march.
 The Viet Cong probably will exploit South Viet-
 namese concerns about the bombing halt and the Paris
 negotiations by further accelerating political action
 in the countryside.   The Viet Cong have been exert-
 ing new efforts for some months to strengthen their
 local organizations, to terrorize local officials,
 and to persuade civilian and military personnel to
 defect.   More recently, the Viet Cong have begun to
 take the line that peace is not far off and that now
 is the time to join the victorious side in order to
 avoid punishment for working against the revolution.
 Some officials in the provinces have suggested that
 a bombing halt would probably precede an accommoda-
 tion with the Viet Cong and an eventual Communist
 take-over, and they may now be more vulnerable to
 the new Communist line.

 [There are also some indications that the Com-
 munists are trying to give a number of cadre legal
 status with a view to operations after a cease-fire.
 Some of the large number of Communists defecting in
 IV Corps are reportedly coming over in order to be in
 position for future political activity in government-
 controlled areas.
 the Viet Cong are stepping up
 efforts to pene            government agencies, including
 the National Police.
 North Vietnam:    The Vietnamese Communists are
 pressing the propaganda advantage resulting from Sai-
 gon's refusal to join the Paris talks.
 Madame Binh, the head of the newly arrived Lib-
 eration Front delegation in Paris, says that she is
 ready to attend Wednesday's meeting although Saigon
 is not.  The Hanoi party daily claimed on 4 November
 that the Front is fully competent to settle all the
 problems of South Vietnam, and it predicted that the
 "Thieu-K -Huon " clique would soon be overthrown.

 Jordan:   The security situation in Amman is in-
 creasingly fragile as authorities struggle to curtail
 terrorist activities in the capital.
 The King has moved cautiously in his relations
 with the terrorists.  Most of the major groups have
 been relatively cooperative with the government--at
 least while in Amman--but on 2 November a splinter
 terrorist organization marched on the US Embassy.
 This provoked a major disturbance throughout the city,
 where rumors had apparently been spreading that the
 government was cracking down on all terrorist organi-
 zations.
 The security authorities managed on 3 November
 to arrest the larger part of the organization which
 had started the trouble.   Some members. resisted,
 however, and shooting incidents between terrorists
 and the authorities occurred in widespread areas of
 Amman.   At least seven persons were killed and ap-
 proximately 100 wounded.
 King Husayn made a radiobroadcast yesterday to
 describe the government's attitude toward the terror-
 ist organizations.   He stressed that his government's
 move had been against only the one offending terror-
 ist gang, but the other organizations are doubtless
 apprehensive that his next moves may be directed
 against them.  Major organizations such as Fatah are
 apparently still cooperating with the authorities.,
 Fatah members have been instructed by their organi-
 zation to maintain calm and not to carry arms while
 in Amman.
 Further conflict, however, is inevitable.  Al-
 though the King would appear to have won for the
 moment,  the terrorists are well aware that public
 sympathy for their cause is increasing and they
 almost certainly will challenge him if he tries to
 crack down on major groups.

 Korea:   South Korean forces have reacted sharply
 to two separate North Korean sea infiltrations over
 the weekend.
 After landing on South Korea's central east
 coast, an unknown number of armed intruders, instead
 of trying to avoid detection, moved into a village
 and detained over 45 civilians for a period before
 leaving.  No contact has been reported yet between
 the intruders and security forces, but South Korean
 military authorities estimate a maximum of 60 infil-
 trators may be in the area, possibly divided into
 several operational and support teams.   The govern-
 ment has declared military operational control of
 the area, mobilized several thousand homeland reserve
 personnel, and moved in a marine battalion and a
 special forces unit.
 A North Korean landing also occurred on the
 west coast near Sosan on 1 November.   Two infiltra-
 tors were killed in a fire fight and a cache of
 equipment was uncovered during a sweep of the area.
 South Korean reaction forces are greatly im-
 proved over last year.  Although further incidents
 may occur, prospects are good that these forces can
 apprehend and neutralize the infiltrated teams.
 This year only three other sea infiltration at-
 tempts have been confirmed.  All apparently involved
 small-scale espionage operations.  The new landings
 occurred at a time of increased tension along the
 Demilitarized Zone.   In the last two weeks there
 has been a rash of ambushes and minings by North
 Koreans, and on 3 November a North Korean platoon-
 sized force was supported by mortar attacks as it
 exchanged fire with South Korean personnel across
 the zone.

 Communist China:   A significant step toward
 closing out the Cu tural Revolution was taken at the
 recent plenum of the party central committee.
 A communique issued after the plenum--the first
 to be convened in more than two years--announced that
 the long overdue ninth party congress will be held
 at an unspecified date. The congress presumably will
 ratify the new provincial government machinery--
 staffed mainly by military men and old party cadres--
 which has been formed slowly and with much argument
 over the past year and a half.
 The latest plenum, which lasted from 13 to 31
 October, may have been stormy.  The communique ap-
 pears to be a compromise document with something for
 everyone.   The document endorsed the current Maoist
 economic and administrative policies, which have a
 strongly radical thrust.  Any congress held in the
 near future, however, would probably have a conserv-
 ative cast.
 The focus of editorial comment in the past month
 suggests that a key question is who should be given
 power in the reconstructed party apparatus.  While
 the plenum was going on, treatment of this issue in
 Shanghai media--used in the past by Mao Tse-tung and
 the Cultural Revolution Group in Peking to air their
 views--placed greater emphasis than did Peking news-
 papers on the dangers of allowing veteran party
 cadres to dominate new governing bodies.
 It seems likely that continued arguments over
 positions in the power structure will result in pro-
 longed delay in convening the party congress, al-
 though the plenum communique asserted that conditions
 or the meeting have been prepared.

 Panama:  Recent junta decisions leave little
 doubt that the real power rests with two national
 guard colonels rather than the provisional adminis-
 tration.
 The machinations surrounding the decision last
 week to reopen newspapers owned by relatives of de-
 posed president Arias reflect the dominance of coup
 leaders Colonels Torrijos and Martinez.   An earlier
 decree allowing pro-Arias newspapers to open was
 countermanded by Torrijos and Martinez; their per-
 sonal choices have now been installed to run the
 papers.
 Two of the key editorial appointees have Commu-
 nist backgrounds.  According to available informa-
 tion, both are members of the International Organiza-
 tion of Journalists, a Communist-front organization.
 These appointments probably reflect the influence of
 Colonel Torrijos'.younger brother, who is an extreme
 leftist.
 The junta meanwhile continues to meet little
 serious resistance to its rule.  An illegal march
 by several hundred students in Panama City on 3 No-
 vember was quickly broken up by the guard.   No seri-
 ous disorders are expected during the remainder of
 the Independence celebrations which end toda .

 USSR:   New Soviet data suggest that price in-
 creases, resulting from the wholesale price reform
 of mid-1967, probably account for about a third of
 the large rise in the defense and science budgets
 that Moscow announced for 1968.
 The defense category of the Soviet budget was
 scheduled to grow by 15 percent this year, a rate
 about twice that experienced during 1966 and 1967.
 The allocation for science, largely funds for mili-
 tary research and development and for space programs,
 was to increase by 11 percent.
 When the Soviet defense and science budgets
 were announced a year ago, Western analysts believed
 that the increase of 2.9 billion rubles--the total
 for the two budget categories--might reflect price
 increases or changes in budget accounting practices
 in addition to actual increases in military pro-
 grams.  No evidence of a change in accounting prac-
 tices has been uncovered, but a more precise esti-
 mate of the magnitude of the price inflation is now
 possible.
 The new, higher prices for basic materials and
 military hardware purchased by the defense establish-
 ment this year are estimated to have boosted expend-
 itures by between 700 million and 1.2 billion rubles
 over what they would have been in the absence of the
 price reform.

 UN-Disarmament:   Pressure is developing to have
 the General Assembly establish machinery to perpetuate
 the Conference of Nonnuclear Countries despite US and
 Soviet opposition.
 The conference, which was held last September
 in Geneva, approved a resolution asking the assembly
 to look into the need for convoking similar conferences
 in the future.   Pakistan is preparing a draft resolu-
 tion calling for a permanent committee to carry on
 the work of the conference, with emphasis on continuing
 the discussion of security problems facing nonnuclear
 countries.   The Italians and Brazilians are pushing
 similar proposals.
 A Soviet diplomat at the UN has suggested that
 the US and USSR combine efforts to block the non-
 nuclears' bid.   The Soviets intend to move quickly
 to impress Moscow's vigorous objection on several
 delegations that are consulting on the Pakistani
 resolution. Moscow has repeatedly expressed its fear
 that critics of the nonproliferation treaty want an
 organization that could be used to weaken the treaty,
 to delay its coming into force, and to try to extract
 concessions from its sponsors.   The Soviets also op-
 pose any rival body to the Eighteen-Nation Disarma-
 ment Committee (ENDC) which would undermine the dom-
 inant role of the US and USSR in disarmament matters.
 Pressures to perpetuate the conference are re-
 lated to the interest of several nonnuclear states
 in expanding the membership of the ENDC.   If the
 current Nonnuclear Conference initiative is thwarted,
 there will be greater insistence on the latter.

 India:   Tribal insurgency in the remote Mizo hills
 of eastern India shows no sign of abating and may even
 intensify.
 The Indian Army, with some 20,000 troops and
 paramilitary units in the area, appears to be making
 little progress with its pacification program.   The
 rebels reportedly control most of the Mizo hills dis-
 trict except for the major town of Aijal and the re-
 settled "progressive protected villages" strung out
 along the Silchar-Aijal-Lungleh road.   Even within
 the heavily guarded villages, however,  there are re-
 ports of at least tacit support for the insurgents
 and,                                                              only
 Aija   is tully under the control of the security
 forces.
 The Mizo situation could deteriorate further.
 The inspector general of the border security forces,
 after a recent tour of the district, concluded that
 the situation was  "very bad" and expects serious
 difficulties in the near future.   The Mizo insurgents
 reportedly are seeking aid from the Chinese Communists,
 who have provided assistance to the Naga rebels far-
 ther to the northeast.   Unlike the Naga situation,
 however,  there is no hard evidence of Mizo contact
 with the Chinese, although they do receive propaganda
 support.   Sporadic reports of a Mizo linkup with the
 Nagas are also unconfirmed, although the Mizos re-
 portedly have been joined by Kuki tribesmen from
 neighboring Manipur.
 The Indian security forces are able to protect
 the major administrative centers in the area against
 Mizo-Kuki attacks, but would be able to do very lit-
 tle about a sharp increase in harassment raids.   The
 insurgents move at will through most of the difficult
 terrain, apparently with the support of the tribal
 population.  F7                     I

 USSR:   The helicopter carrier Moskva and two
 SAM-equipped frigates returned to t He Black Sea yes-
 terday.   The carrier conducted six weeks of antisub-
 marine training in the Mediterranean.   The Soviets'
 other helicopter carrier is expected to leave the
 shipyard soon but probably will not be ready for sea
 until next fall.
 EGuyana:   Prime Minister Burnham announced to par-
 liament yesterday that national elections will be held
 on 16 December.   The opposition parties--pro-Communist
 Cheddi Jagan's People's Progressive Party and conserv-
 ative Peter D'Aguiar's United Force--walked out of par-
 liament last week in protest against new electoral reg-
 ulations, which Burnham's party voted through regard-
 less.   Burnham now faces six weeks of increasingly
 bitter political attack and possible violence.   Burn-
 ham and his followers can be elected legally even if
 the opposition boycotts the election, but if the op-
 position does so Burnham's victory would not look
 "democratic." F7               I

 Chile-UN:   Several Chilean Marxists and other
 leftists on the staff of the UN Economic Commission
 for Latin America (ECLA) and its affiliated planning
 institute in Santiago are promoting economic doctrines
 and other interests of the Communist-Socialist Pop-
 ular Action Front.   ECLA's executive secretary, Carlos
 Quintana of Mexico, is indifferent to what US Ambas-
 sador Korry describes as the pronounced "leftist drift"
 of these organizations.   Since its founding in 1948,
 ECLA has been a major forum for the dissemination of
 materials and attacking private enterprise as well as
 for nationalistic Latin American views on international
 trade.   ECLA's officials have not previously been known
 to have exploited the organization to further the in-
 terests of any political party.
