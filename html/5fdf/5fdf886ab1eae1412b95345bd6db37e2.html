 *EGYPT:   In a speech intended to justify to his
 Arab allies his postwar turn away from Moscow to a
 more balanced Soviet-Egyptian relationship, Presi-
 dent Sadat last night harshly criticized the Soviets
 for having consistently opposed Egypt's resort to
 war.
 Sadat delivered his remarks in a long address
 to the nation designed chiefly to promote a new
 national action plan that will outline Egypt's do-
 mestic and foreign policy for the next quarter cen-
 tury.   Devoting a major portion of the speech to the
 Soviets, Sadat rehashed a long history of unfulfilled
 Soviet promises of military aid and concerted Soviet
 efforts to turn Egypt's attentions away from war.
 Sadat was careful not to make invidious compar-
 isons between his attitude toward Moscow and his
 new closer ties with the US, and he frequently blamed
 the US equally with the Soviets for a failure to
 move toward a Middle East settlement before the war.
 He seemed, however, almost to imply that the respon-
 sibility for previous US inaction was primarily Mos-
 cow's.   Charging that the Soviets had deliberately
 sought to ensure that the Arabs remain militarily
 weak while Israel was strengthened, he said that the
 US had come to believe that Egypt and the Arabs were
 "motionless corpses."  He asked why the US should
 have been expected to put forth any solution if it
 believed the Arabs were too weak to bargain.
 Sadat said in effect that Moscow had forced
 Egypt to take matters into its own hands.   By em-
 phasizing that the decision to initiate the war was
 entirely an Egyptian one,  taken despite Soviet ob-
 struction,  Sadat seemed to be telling other Arabs,
 particularly Syria, that dependence on Moscow as a
 protector of Arab interests is essentially meaning-
 less.   Cairo has recently been showing some concern
 that Soviet sniping at Egypt's postwar policies,
 particularly its relations with the US, will affect
 Syrian willingness to continue disengagement talks
 with the US and Israel.

 Sadat's strong speech against the Soviets may
 herald still more direct attacks in the future on
 Moscow's interests in Egypt.   The speech was pre-
 ceded yesterday by an Al Ahram editorial questioning
 the continued value of the Soviet-Egyptian friend-
 ship treaty and,  although Sadat himself did not men-
 tion it, he laid the groundwork for a later call for
 modification if he comes to feel that it symbolizes
 too close a relationship with Moscow.
 Such a move would risk Egypt's major source of
 military aid, however,  and Sadat will approach the
 issue cautiously.   Although he has shown an increased
 willingness recently to gamble on the military re-
 lationship with Moscow in order to move away from
 the political relationship, he will seek to avoid
 antagonizing the Soviets to the point that they
 might begin active meddling in internal Egyptian
 affairs.   The Egyptians have indicated some concern
 already at this prospect,  and Sadat's explanation
 of his domestic policies last night took on a de-
 fensive tone that indicates an attempt to fend off

 SOUTH KOREA:   The Pak government announced a new,
 harsh emergency measure on April 3 as part of a deter-
 mined effort to halt renewed student protest.   The
 government is now defining all antigovernment activity
 as Communist-affiliated as well as subversive and has
 made clear its resolve to suppress any organized
 student political activity.
 Emergency measure number four--the first was
 issued in January--identifies a so-called "National
 Democratic Young Students League" as the organization
 behind the small-scale student protests that started
 up again last week.   There had been no open political
 activity on campus during the first few weeks of the
 current school term
 The new decree allows members of the student
 league five days in which to turn themselves in to
 the government. After this period, those charged
 with membership will be subject to court-martial if
 apprehended; punishments will range from a five-year
 prison term to life imprisonment or death.   The decree
 prohibits political demonstrations or related activi-
 ties on any campus.   The government also threatens to
 close any school where such activities occur.   The
 army will aid local authorities or the education min-
 ister in restoring order on campuses, if necessary.

 April 19 is the anniversary of the student up-

 LAOS:   After more than 13 months of protracted

 WEST GERMANY:   Chancellor Brandt has reaffirmed
 his determination to steer the Social Democrats on a
 middle-of-the-road course despite some pressures from
 within the party to adopt a more radical program.   At
 a press conference on April. 2, Brandt served notice
 on the radical leftist element in the party's youth
 affiliate  (Jusos) to toe the line or leave.
 The Chancellor's press conference clearly indi-
 cates he holds Jusos extremists partly responsible for
 the Social Democrats' recent setbacks in state and
 local elections.   According to Brandt,  "There is no
 majority in democracy without a middle line.   He who
 abandons the middle line sacrifices his ability to
 govern."   Brandt did not spell out what lies in store
 for those who do not accept the party line, but he
 is prepared to accept a variety of views in the party
 as long as discipline is maintained.   Brandt, in fact,
 "demanded" that the party remain intact in order to
 play its  "role in state and society."
 Since the electoral setback in Hamburg on March 3,
 Brandt has been under pressure to move against the
 radical wing of Jusos.   His speech, however, appears
 to be a restatement of his earlier position in which
 he stopped short of calling for a purge but left the
 door open for local party organizations to oust the
 recalcitrants.
 Looking ahead to the next state elections--in
 Lower Saxony on June 9--Brandt urged the party to
 unite in a common cause.   He announced that he and
 other top party officials,  in a new show of unity,
 will attend campaign rallies in Lower Saxony.   Brandt
 also announced he will meet with 15 local party chair-
 men during the summer.
 The Chancellor may have been buoyed by new ex-
 pressions of support for his government by leaders of
 the minority party in the ruling coalition.   Hans-
 Dietrich Genscher, who is slated to take over the

 helm of the Free Democrats  (FDP)  in mid-May, joined

 confidence in and loyalty to the coalition.   Accord-
 ing to Genscher,  "The FDP-SPD government in Bonn has
 performed excellently, whereas the Christian Demo-
 crat/Christian Social Union has no substantive al-
 ternative."
 The FDP's reaffirmation of support for the coa-
 lition throws cold water on recent rumors that it
 would leave the government before the federal elec.
 tions in 1976.

 Chou En-la.:   Pressed on Foreign Policy
 The Chinese ambassador to London believes that
 Premier Chou En-lai is under pressure from opponents
 within the Chinese leadership to show progress on the
 Taiwan issue.   In the ambassador's opinion, failure
 to act quickly on the issue might leave Chou vulner-
 able to his opponents---the envoy specifically men-
 tioned Chiang Ching, Mao's wife and leader of the
 so-called radical camp in the Chinese leadership--
 who have been seeking ways to introduce criticism
 of Chou into the anti-Confucius campaign.
 Tough T4lk
 With this in mind, the ambassador claimed, Chou
 directed Liao Cheng-chih, a close associate, to give
 a tough keynote speech at the annual meeting on Feb-
 ruary 28 commemorating the Taiwanese uprising in 1947
 against the Nationalist government.   This move, the
 ambassador said, was meant to signal new Chinese in-
 terest in the Taiwan issue.
 Speeches at the meeting, including Liao's, were
 in fact more strongly worded than those delivered at
 the meeting in February 1973, which took place in the
 wake of the announcement that liaison offices were
 being established in Peking and Washington.   The
 speeches this year were not menacing, nor did they
 display a keen sense of urgency.
 Nevertheless,  the statements have been handled
 by Chinese propaganda outlets in a way that indicates
 treatment of the Taiwan issue is a subject of high-
 level wrangling in China.   Outlets in Hong Kong did
 not release the text of a speech by Fu Tso-i, an-
 other important speaker at the meeting,  for 24 hours;
 when they did, Fu was quoted calling for the "liber-
 ation" of Taiwan.
 This version was superseded by another which
 spoke of "peaceful liberation" of the island; it in

 turn was canceled, and a final version restored the
 original formulation, omitting the word "peaceful."
 This unusual pulling and hauling almost certainly
 involved high-level decisions in Peking.
 25X1
 25X1
 The communique issued on the occasion of Secre-
 tary Kissinger's most recent visit to China last No-
 vember showed no sense of urgency on the Taiwan ques-
 tion, and since then Chinese officials have not pressed
 for early resolution of the problem.   Some officials
 have expressed concern, however, at the appointment
 of so senior a diplomat as Ambassador Unger to head
 the US mission in Taipei.
 The Chinese may anticipate that
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and Vice Foreign Minister
 Chiao Kuan-hua will have an opportunity to discuss
 Taiwan, as well as other issues, with US officials
 when they visit the US for the special session of the
 UN General Assembly next week.
 Against Confucius
 Discussion of foreign policy issues has been an
 important component of the anti-Confucian campaign in
 recent months.   Thus far both Chou and Mao have seemed
 determined to preserve the foreign policy followed by
 Peking over the past several years.   Aspects of that
 policy undoubtedly have been under fire, perhaps from
 several quarters, for much of the past year.   The crit-
 icism may have grown more intense since Chiang Ching
 late last month became more active politically, after
 a period of relative eclipse.

 Her political vigor may be related to an appar-
 ent attempt to identify with regional military lead-
 ers, who themselves may have come under criticism. in
 the course of the anti-Confucius campaign.   This mar-
 riage of convenience may have brought Chou, and Per-
 haps Mao as well, under some pressure, as did a simi-
 lar attempt in the period immediately preceding the
 Tenth Party Congress last summer.
 Last week,  for example, Chou remarked in a ban-
 quet speech that China, as a socialist country, would
 of course continue to support revolutionary causes.
 The Premier has made such public remarks before, but
 in this and other similar statements recently he
 seemed to be replying to unnamed critics.
 A need on the part of Chou and his supporters
 to indicate that China is not a patsy of the devel-
 oped nations may also have been responsible for re-
 cent references at widely scattered rallies to US
 and Japanese "atrocities."   The point of these rallies
 was to demonstrate that any accommodation with the
 Soviet Union would leave China vulnerable to similar
 humiliations, but the reference to alleged events of
 30 or more years ago seems gratuitous.

 On another issue bearing on China's relations
 with the West, Chou seems to be holding the line.
 A recent article in People's Dail reiterated the
 importance China attaches to continued imports of
 advanced technology from the West, noting the neces-
 sity of such imports to China's plans for more rapid
 development.   Representatives of Western firms have
 in fact encountered few delays or difficulties in
 conducting business with the Chinese recently, and
 the volume of Chinese imports of Western goods has
 shown no signs of diminishing.
 The tone of the People's Daily article was dis-
 tinctly defensive, and was apparently occasioned by
 earlier material appearing in the Chinese media that
 criticized a tendency toward "over-reliance" on such
 imports.   The basic disagreement in this area seems
 to be over what the proper level of such imports
 should be, and not whether China should continue to
 purchase machinery and technology from the West.
 The argument has been fueled not only by crit-
 icism in the press but also by wall posters.  At
 least one of these is reported to have criticized
 Chou by name.
 Basically Intact
 On the basic tenets of Chinese foreign policy,
 however, the media have continued to carry themes that
 have been dominant for the past several years.   In
 particular, the press has continued to emphasize the
 idea of an international balance of power, which Peking
 has considered essential for the protection of Chinese
 national interests.   Peking, for example, has recently

 found comfort in a spate of items underlining con-
 tinuing "contention" between the US and the Soviet
 Union in all parts of the world, and Chou himself
 pointedly hammered on this thesis on the eve of
 Secretary Kissinger's visit to Moscow.
 The Chinese ambassador in London is almost cer-
 tainly right in claiming that Chou is now under pres-
 sure--on Taiwan as well as other issues.   The substance
 of Chinese foreign policy still appears to be intact,
 however, even though the rhetoric in which that policy
 is conducted undoubtedly has undergone a change in
 recent weeks.

 China-Tanzania:   President Nyerere's visit to
 China last week has resulted in a new $75-million
 interest-free credit to Dar es Salaam.   Tanzania will
 use the aid for developing coal and iron ore mines in
 the southern part of the country.   The coal and iron
 ore will eventually be exported by way of a new rail
 link to the Tan-Zam railroad.   The new credit, intended
 to expand Tanzania's industrial base, increases China's
 total economic aid commitment to mainland Tanzania to
 $315 million.   Almost all of China's previous commit-
 ments had been used by the end of 1973, when the Tan-
 zanian portion of the Tan-Zam was completed.   China
 still has an estimated 600 technicians working on
 various other economic projects in the country.F

 USSR-US:   Moscow is relying increasingly on US
 technology to tap Siberian oil reserves.   US exports
 of oil-field equipment to the USSR exceeded $100
 million last year.   The backlog of Soviet orders al-
 ready on the books of US firms is probably double
 that amount.   Most of the imports can be used in
 Arctic or permafrost regions;  the US has a near
 monopoly on this type of equipment.
