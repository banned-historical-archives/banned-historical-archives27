MEMORANDUM , 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
WASHINGTON 
TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE INFORMATION  
EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY October 13, 1971 
MEMORANDUM FOR: DR. KISSINGER 
FROM: PETER RODMAN t\IX 
SUBJECT: Who Invited Whom? 
The attached chronology gives the full record of public and private 
statements relevant to the question of which side took the initiative 
to, propose a Presidential visit to China. The record suggests that 
the invitation evolved out of initiatives on both sides: 
-- The U.S. took the initiative and pressed for the idea 
of sending a U.S. special representative to Peking 
or receiving a Chinese special envoy in Washington. 
(This began in the Warsaw talks in January 1970, and 
we later raised it in special channels. The Chinese 
responded positively on December 9, 1970.) 
? Aside from a casual comment by the President in an 
October 1970 TIME in;erview, the first mention of 
a Presidential visit  came from the Chinese on January 11, 
1971. (They repeated it on April 21, 1971, following the 
? President's public remark about his daughter's honeymoon.) 
-- Chou En-lai's message of May 29, 1971, treats the idea. of 
a Presidential visit as Mao's "suggestion" which the President 
"accepts. 
-- Chinese ploymanship about our seeking the invitation seems 
to have begun in Chou's talks with you in Peking. (Chou told 
you the President's honeymoon remark in April prompted the 
invitation.) He has been getting the sequence wrong, too: 
Last week he told a group of Americans that the special-envoy 
idea was agreed to after the Presidential-visit idea was broached.

1 Amb. Stoessel at Warsaw meeting tells PRC 
Charge' that U.S. "would be prepared to consider 
sending a representative to Peking for direct 
discussions ? ? ? or receiving a representative 
from your Government in Washington." PRC 
Charge' expresses interest. (Tab 1) 
At next Warsaw meeting, PRC Charge' states that 
"if the USG wishes to send a representative of 
ministerial rank or a special envoy of the U.S. 
President to Peking for further exploration of 
questions of fundamental principle between China 
and the United States, the Chinese Government. 
will be willing to receive him." (Tab 2) 
U.S. assures Chinese following Cambodia operation 
(thru Winter and Walters in Paris) that U.S. has 
? 
Ino aggressive intentions, and that "Dr. Kissinger 
is prepared to talk to a person of stature on the 
Covmunist Chinese side if this can be:done secretly. 
(Tab 3) 1 7 
U.S. (thru Walters) suggests creation of a regular 
channel thru Walters, and states our readiness "to 
send a high-level personal representative of the 
President to Paris, or some other mutually con-
venient location, for direct talks on U.S. -Chinese 
relations." (Tab 4) 
1 President, in TIME interview followin Jordanian 
crisis, says: "If there is anything I want to do 
% before I die, it is.k__,) go to China. If I don't, I 
want my children to." (Tab 5)

President asks Yahya in Washington to tell Chinese 
in Peking that U.S. is willing to send high-level 
personal representative (e.g., Murphy, Dewey, or 
HAK) to Peking or other convenient capital to open

Ceausescu tells President he believes PRC wants 
to improve relations with U.S. President declares 
U.S. readiness for talks with PRC and exchange 
of high-level special representatives. (Tab 7) 
PRC replies to oral message delivered by Yahya: 
Chou En-lai, after coordinating with Mao and Lin 
Piao, states that "in order to discuss this subject 
[U.S. vacating Taiwan], a special envoy of Presi-
dent Nixon's will be most welcome in Peking." 
Chou notes that this was first U.S. message sent 
"from a Head thru a Head to a Head," and Chinese 
attach importance to it because Pakistan is a great 
friend of China. (Tab 8) 
U.S. replies thru Pakistani channel welcoming 
Chinese willingness (as expressed at Feb. 20, 1970 
Warsaw meeting) to receive U.S. representative 
to discuss outstanding issues. U.S. therefore 
"believes it would be useful" to begin discussions 
at an early convenient moment on bringing about a 
higher-level meeting in Peking. (Tab 9) 
? 
HAK, in end-of-year backgrounder, says: "We 
remain piepared, at Warsaw, 9r elsewhere, to 
talk to the Communist Chinese about differences 
that divide us." (Tab 10) 
Amb. Bogdan delivers message from Chou En-lai 
declaring that "if the U.S. has a desire to settle 
the [Taiwan] issue and a proposal for its solution, 
the PRC will be prepared to receive a U.S. special 
envoy in Peking." ..Chou added the comment that 
since President Nixon had visited Bucharest ex' 
5 1 
Belgrade, he would also be welcome in Peking.

President tells American Society of Newspaper 
Editors of a recent conversation he had had with 
his daughters on the possibility of their going to 
China someday. "I hope they do. As a matter of 
fact, I hope sometime I do." (Tab 13) 
Message from Chou En-lai delivered April 27 
"reaffirms [PRC} willingness to receive publicly 
in Peking a special envoy of the President of the 
U.S. (for instance, Mr. Kissinger) or the U.S. 
Secretary of State  or even the President of the 
U.S. himself for direct meeting-M discussroniis." 
(Tab 14) 
U.S. message dispatched via Walters proposes set-
ting up reliable channel and says that HAK would be 
prepared to come to Paris for direct talks on U.S. - 
Chinese relations." (This message dispatched 
before receipt of above; received by Chinese April 
29.) (Tab 15) 
President in news conference says: "I hope, and, 
as a matter of fact, I expect to visit Mainland China 
sometime in some capacity -- I don't know what 
capacity'. But that indicates what I hope for the 
long term." (Tab 11)) 
LIFE publishes Edgar Snow report of Dec. 18, 1970, 
interview with Mao. The PRC foreign ministry, 
Mao had said, was considering the matter of ad-
mitting Americans, including the President, to 
China. "He should be welcomed because, Mao 
explained, at present the problems between China 
and the U.S.A. would have to be solved with Nixon. 
Mao would be happy to talk with Mm, either as a 
tourist or as President." (Tab 17) 
President, replying thru Pakistani channel to Chou's 
% message of April 21, says he "is prepared to accept 
the suggestion of Premier Chou En-lai that he visit 
Pekilig for direct conversations with the leaders of 
the People's Republic of China." President proposes 
preliminary secret meeting between HAK and Chou 
to exchange views and explore possibility of Presi-
dential visit. (Received by Chinese May 17) (Tab 18)

to China as the U.S. representative who will come 
in advance for a preliminary secret meeting with 
high-level Chinese officials to prepare and make

ing and'discussions with the leaders of the People's 
Republic of China," and he "appreciates the warm 
wel?come'extended by.Preniier Chou En-lai to his 
personal representalive, Dr. Kissinger." (Tab 21) 
Chou En-lai tells HAK in Peking that "from the very 
beginning, tthe President] took the attitude that he 
was willing to come to Peking." He says President's 
remark about daughter's honeymoon prompted

accept." (Excerpts from Peking MemCons, Tab 22)

HAK,asked at San Clemente backgrounder if he 
knew before his trip that President would be in-
vited, replies: "Essentially, yes. I knew, and of 
course the President knew that there was an interest, 
a mutual interest in a visit." (Tab 24) 
Chou En-lai, in interview with delegation from 
Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, explains 
Nixon visit by saying that "at the present date, in 
contacting your government to normalize relations 
we must contact those who are in authority in your 
country. But in your country, your system is that 
you have a president, and your president said that 
he wishes to move towards friendship and he also has 
said that he hopes to visit China. And of course, 
naturally we can invite him. . . "(Tab 25) 
Chou En-lai tells James Reston, in interview 
published August 10: "He [the President] expressed 
a desire to come and we have invited him to come," 
(Tab 26) 
Julian Schu.xnan, in UPI dispatch from Peking, quotes 
Chou En-Jai as saying: "He [the President] publicly 
expressed his willingness to come to China and 
negotiate. We had made no response. It would not 
have been proper for a state so antagonistic. 
Therefore we agreed to Kissinger's coming." (Tab 27

to restate once again my Government's hope that regular contacts 
between us can take place at frecuent intervals and that these talks' 
will enable us to .move toward a new phase in Sino7Lnerican relations 
'based on mutual respect.. 
This concluder my statement. 
it le 4' 
Ur. Ambassador, the talks between China and the U.S. have gone 
on for over tea years. In the course of these talks, the U. S. 
Government has invariably advanced an evasive attitude toward the 
questions of fundallental principles between the two countries and 
has confined itself to side issues, thus preventing the talks achiev-
ing results on flindamental issues between the two countries. Now 
that the U.S..Governmont wishes to increase the dialogue with our 
country and improve Sino-US relations, presumably the nunstion of , 
how to deal with the fundamental principles of the relations of 017 
two Countries is already under your consideration. The Chinese 
Government has always stood for the peaceful settlement of disputes 
between China, and the U.S. through negotiations; it has done so in 
the past and is prepared to do likewise in the future. We would 
velcoine studies vnd explorations on the fundamental question of how 
to settle relations between the two countries. We are willing to 
consider and discuss whatever ideas and suggestions the U.S. Govern-
ment might put forInard in accordance with the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, therefore really helping to reduce tensions 
between China and the U.S. and fundamentally improve relations 
between China and the U.S. These talks may either continue to be . 
conducted at the ambassadorial level or may be conducted at a higher 
level or through other channels acceptable to both sides. I have 
carefully listened to the staterAent the Ambassador just made.- We 
will study it and sot forth our views at the next meeting.

Lei said: 
Mr. AmbaSsador, I would only like to :add a few points. With 
regard to Mr. AMbassadoris proposal regarding sending a representative 
ma the-7Tro,)osal to 
ru2vernment. A point.e.a ou p o my overn-
ment on the question of Taiwan is very c3ear and known to everybody. 
The so-called treaty concluded by the U.S. and the Chiang shek 
clique is not recognized by the whole Chinese peoole% And I must 
point out that Taiwan is not a state; it is part of the People's 
Republic of China. Mr. AmbasJador must be aware that there is only 
one China: this is the People's Republic of China. If Mr. Aqlbassador 
has nothing more to say, may I make a proposal for the date of our 
next meeting? 
-I have heard with attention what you have said. I understand 
your views concerning Taiwan, and I hope that you have understood 
the point of view that I have presented in my statenent. I will 
0keport to my Government everything you have said today, including 
hat you mentioned regarding meetings at a higher level. I believe 
.he Charg also mentioned that the meetings might be in anotTler channel, 
and I would like to ineuire what might be involved. Any explanafton 
from the Charge would be useful.

Lei said: 
Concerning tae question of the Chinese territory of Tai n, 
which L:abassadol' has mentioned, I have already e:cplained in clear 
terms the position of my Government. Therefore I would not like to 
repeat them. Mr. Ambassador also mentioned the question of talks 
at a higher level or throug:1 other channels. If the U. S. Govern-
ment is interested in talks at a higher level or through other 
channels, you may Int forward your draft proposal, or a draft 
proposal may be worked out through consultation of the two sides at 
these neabassadorial talks. If Mr. Ambassador has nothing more to 
say, may I make a proposal for the date of the meeting? I 
Propose that the date of the next meeting be decided on later 
through consultation via the liaison personnel of our two sides. 
Mr; Chlien will be liaison officer of our side.

TOP SECRET /NODIVEYES ONLY  
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT 
Henry A: Kissinger 
Communication with the Communist Chinese 
As I mentioned to you at the time on the phone, Professor Ernst Winters, 
a naturalized. American working with UNESCO in Paris, and an old ac-
quaintance, called me on May 3 to relay the reaction of personnel in the 
Communist Chinese Embassy in Paris to your decision on the Cambodian 
? sanctuaries. This reaction was obtained on April 30, i. e., before your 
speech. Thus, the Chinese were aware of only South Vietnamese ground 
operations in Cambodia, not our own. 
? On hearing the gist of his information, I asked Professor Winters to come 
to my office right away. We met at 2:00 p.m. that afternoon for ale,L 
fifteen minutes. 
- I asked Professor Winters what had transpired in Paris. He said that on 
Thursday, April 30, at 11:30 a. m. (i.e., before your speech) one of his con-
tact people with the Chinese, a Frenchman who arranges exchanges between 
Chinese and French students, called to say that the Chinese wanted to see 
Professor Winters. He went to the Embassy for a two-hour lunch. 
He met with several young low-echelon personnel, such as the chauffeur and 
a switchboard operator, who are imbued with the cultural revolution and in a 
sons.,p run the Embassy. The Ambassador and a young man from.the Foreign 
Service were also there but, as usual, were not very articulate.. The Chinese 
immediately asked Professor Winters what he thought of the President's 
decisions on Cambodia. 
Professor Winters replied that he supposed that the United States thought that 
its national interest was at stake and was acting accordingly. The Chinese 
immediately began to harangue him with invective, a marked depaure from 
their previous polite dealings, and lumped him together with ell other 
Americans. They claimed that the U.S. wished to conquer Chipa , that 
were considering preventive war, that we were in collusion with the Soviets 
in a pincer movement on China, and that our Vic.tnam withdrawan Were a ruse,

Professor Winters was struck by the enormous, un-Chinese intensity of their 
reaction. Clearly, a nerve had been touched. He took the Chinese reaction 
in stride and asked how the United Statbs was to know how the Chinese felt 
without any contact. The Chinese did not allow American visitors and the 
Warsaw meetings were not really productive. 
The Chinese asked Pfofessor Winters who in America they could talk to and 
trust, the significant.groups. In his only intervention, the Foreign Service 
officer said, "Don't say the student movement." Professor Winters replied 
that the President and his Cabinet were the policy makers and the ones to talk tc 
He left the Chinese Embassy very depressed, with a feeling of hopelessness 
..,After seven years of cultivating the Chinese. Since he was going to New York 
That afternoon anyway for a meeting, he thought it would be useful to go to 
--Washington and give me his information in case it fit into our overall strategic 
moiale. 
Iasked Professor Winters whether they would see him, and he replied that 
. they never refused to do so. They did not know that he had been in New York 
0 _ * .or that he knew me. i? ? 
-

I then asked Professor Winters to see the Chinese the next day on May 4 and 
tell them that he.had.seen me, and had put their questions to me. - I asked - 
I 
Professor Winters to pass a message to the Chinese along the-lines of the 
. -- --attachment  at Tab-A.-rum him to contact General -Walters as soon as he

. - . 
Professor Winters added that he had observed during the past few weeks that 
the Soviets in UNESCO circles were moving away from the U.S. and that there 
was a growing Soviet-U.S. tension. ' 
Mr meeting closed with Professor Winters assuring me that he would act on 
this'the next day and my observing that if the Chinese refused to receive him, 
this would be an interesting development also. 
We have not heard back from Winters or Walters on this subject.

? MESSAGE TO BE DELIVERED BY 
MAJOR GENERAL VERNON A. WALTERS 
TO THE CHINESE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT 
The United States Government wishes to continue the exchanges that 
are taking place through the Ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. However, it 
is difficult to maintain complete secrecy in these talks due to their formal 
nature, the large number of officials involved and the great public interest 
that they have generated. 
Republic of China desires talks that 
are strictly confidential and not known by other countries, the President 
is ready to establish an alternative channel directly to him for matters of 
the most extreme sensitivity. Its purpose would be to bring about an im-
provement in US-Chinese relations fully recognizing differences" in 
ideology. 
We are prepared to activate such a channel through the bearer of 
this communication Major General Vernon A. Walters, the U. g. Defense 
Attache accredited to the French Governn-ent in Paris. We are also 
rea.dy to send a high-level personal representative of the President to Paris, 
or some other mutually convenient location, for direct talks on U.S. -Chinese 
relations. 
Knowledge of these talks would be confined to the President, his 
personal advisors and his personal representative unless otherwise agreed.

S of Tv" 
And Other Presidential Reflections in a Crisis Week 
RICHARD NIXON did not watch televi.; 
sion once during the Middle East 
crisis. He scanned the morning newspa-
pers, hut he did not dwell on them. Lin-
gering too long in the headlines, he 
feared, would raise his blood pressure. 
"There is an old Quaker saying: he said: 
" 'The most important quality in a crisis 
is peace at the center.'" - 
,For those eight clays the center was 
the White House warren? where he 
roamed in the cool and very calm cor-
ridors from his hideaway in the Exec-
utive Office Building to his small study, 
to the Oval Office, into the Rose Gar-
den, to the staff quartPrs. on over to 
the mansion. But the outskle world was 
Jet in only in controlled doses. He had 
the reports and memos of his men on 
the crisis itself. He relied on his own 
Special news summary, "I did not want 
the hot words of television. - Anyone 
watching television would have thought 
that war was declared eight times. Just 
so the Man here doesn't think that" 
In 20 months of stewardship, the Pres-
ident has grown some deeper; crevices 
around his eyes and his hair is a shade 
more Silver. Those who watched Nixon 
during this time found him calm and 
onfident, still with that element of con-
ing that has always been part of him. 
Nixon ordered that neither his time 
nor his mind was to be cluttered with 
the details of how many ships should 
go where. "It is very important to take 
the long 'view." he cautioned. "That 
has to be conveyed to everyhody. I am 
not going to get bogged doWn in de-
tails. Look clown the road. I want to 
pound that into the whole bureaucracy." 
? 
In the aftermath he credited his strat-
egy with cautious success. It was a cri-
sis, but not, perhaps, as great as reck-
oned earlier. It was like others before 
it. It will not be the last of its kind. "Rus-
sia is going to continue to probe." ' 
Nixon stands face-to-face with his 
old adversary, again. In a way, it is some-
what of a comfort to grapple with naked 
power, to hear the namevof men he 
has known for more than a decade. He 
has laid all the pieces of this crisis out 
around him for deeper study. The So-
viet cooperation in the later stages Itk-
rated better than their actions in pre-
vious times of tension. But their initial vi-
olations of the cease-fire is another mat-
ter. The issue will come: up again, the 
President believes. "It will not be over-
ked," he told one of his visitors. 
.S. foreign policy, the President re-
led, has long been "provincial rath-
er than global. They talk about two. 
isolationism. That's not new. We've al-
ways been isolationist. The role we have 
is not a role we would have preferred. 
The .Marshall Plan and other acts of 
help were. ?reactions to problems rather 
than calculated move in .a master plan 
of world .dominance like those devised 
in other..generations??by ? Germany ? and 
France.. The Peace Corps touched the 
heartstrings of America." But more than 
?idealism is. needed. The U.S.. ?must ? make 
certain that other nations have the 
chance to develop as they wish, "wheth-

'When .dealing with Russia, "it doesn't 
serve the cause to say ?that if only we 
get to .know each other better our dif-
ferences will ? disappear.. Great nations 
are going to have. different ? views." The 
President is keenly conscious of dif-
fering political and economic ? systems, 
but the fundamental difference he sees. 
is that while the U.S. seeks peace, the ? 
U.S.S.R. seeks dominion. 
? When .Nixon talked of these gigantic. 
gulfs between the two powers, he did not 
grow excited and angry as he did years 
ago: It is a fact of his life now. His job, as ? 
he sees it, is to convince the Soviet

SUBJECT: Meeting Between the President and Pakistan President 
Yahya 
President Yahya was in the United States on the occasion of the 25th 
anniversary of the United Nations. Yahya is tough, direct, and with 
&good sense of humor. He talks in a very clipped way, is a splendid 
product of Sandhurst and affects a sort of social naivete but is P:ILLE-G-IB 
much more complicated tkan this. 
The President said, "I understand you are going to Peking. '1 ?Yahya 
explained how it came about. He said Chou En-lai bad originally been 
slated to go to Pakistan and had said he would make .no other foreign 
visit until he had visited Pakistan. However, he had had to go to North 
Korea for a ceremonial visit and had communicated with Yahya before 
leaving, telling him. that he was aware of his promise and apologizing 
for not keeping it. He had, however, hoped that Yahya would pay him 
4 
a visit and therefore het-As going to Peking. The President said 3t is 
? essential that we open negotiations with China. Whatever our relations 
? with the USSR or what announcements are made I want you to know the 
following: (3.) we will make no condominium against China and we want 
them to know it whatever may be put out; (2)  we will be glad to send 
Murphy or Dewey to Peking and to establish links secretly." 
Yahya said be had once been told to establish seeret links and had 
communicated j.t to the Chinese who. had replied whether this meant 
that the United States Was thinking of a hot line to Peking similar to the 
one that existed to Mbscow. The President said, no that Wasn't what

previous visit to Peking of permanent revolution; he had said 'Americans 
hope we will die out, but no, I will teach every child from the day he is 
born to be a revolutionary. ' And I must say he kept his word in the 
cultural revolution." Yahya,said he had been fascinated when he was in 
China, but when he left Canton he said, "Thank God. " It was an 
oppressive experience.

WASHINGTON 
MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION 
TIME: 12:30 1:00 p.m., October 27, 1970 
PLACE: Blair House 
PRESENT: 
Nicolae Ceausescu, President of the Council of State 
of the Socialist Republic of Romania 
Henry A. Kissinger, Assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs 
Sergin Celac, Interpreter 
David R. Young, Notetaker. 
Dr. Kissinger: President Nixon was very pleased with the discussions 
yesterday. He has asked me to come over and to clarify three specific 
points to be sure that there is no misunderstanding. 
My third point relates to your conversation with President Nixon on 
the Peoples' Republic of China. The President wanted me to reiterate that 
we have great interest in establishing political and diplomatic communications 
with the Peoples' Republic of China. We do not believe that we have any 
long-term clashing interests. We are prepared to set up channels to the 
Peoples' Republic of China which are free from any outside pressures and 
free from any questions of prestige. 
If the leaders of the Peoples' Republic of China want to tell us something 
through you and your Ambassador brings the communication to me, I can 
assure you that such communication will be confined to the White House. 
(Or if you wish to communicate with us through any other emissary, that is 
also acceptable.) 
President Ceausescu On the subject of Vietnam, I must regretfully add that 
the last part of your communication is not very helpful. It adds a threat 
while proposing negotiations and this does not leave much room for an 
acceptable solution from the other side's point of view. 
With regard to China we will inform the Chinese leaders of our 
conversation and if there is any communication we will pass that to you 
as we have in the past.

Ambassador 'Maly dictated the following in Mr. Kissinger's office at 
6:05 pm, December 9: 
The message was duly conveyed and Prime Minister Chou En 
reply given after throe days of deliberations was as follows: 
"This (meaning the reply) ie not from me alone but from Chairman Mao 
and Vice Chairman Lin Piao as well. We thank the President of Pakistan 
for conveying to us Orally a message from President Nixon. China has 
always been willing and has always tried to negotiate by peaceful means. 
Taiwan and the Straits of Taiwan are an inalienable part of China which 
- have now been occupied by foreign troops of the United States for the 
last fifteen years. Negotiations and talks have been going on with no 
results whatsoever. In order to discuss this subject of the vacation of 
I  
Chinese territories called Taiwan, a envoy of  Tijii7S 
will be most welcome in Peking." 
---...  
Lai's 
fp 
? Chou Fax-Lai said in the course of the conversations 
"We have had messages from. the United States from different sources in 
the past but this is the first time that the proposal has come from a Head, 
through a Head, to a Head. The United States knows that Pakistan is a

The U.S. representative at the meeting between the two sides 
,in Warsaw on January 20 1970 suggested that direct discussions be 
held either in Peking or Washington on the broad range of issues which 
lie between the People's Republic of China and the U.S., including the 
ue of Taiwan. This proposal was an outgrowth of the consistent 
policy of .the United States Government to seek opportunities for 
negotiating the settlement of outstanding issues between the two 
governments. The United States. therefore welcomed the remarks of the 
representative of the People's Republic of China at the Warsaw 
meeting of February 20, 1970; in expressing the willingness of the 
Government of the People's Republic of China to receive in Peking a 
U.S. representative of Ministerial rank or a special Presidential 
envoy. 
In the light of the remarks of Premier Chou En Lai to 
President Yabya, as well as the continuing United States interest in 
-China discussions at a higher level, the 'United States Government 
believes,tt would be useful to begin discussions with a view of bringing 
about a higher-level meeting in Peking. The meeting in Peking would 
not be limited only to the Taiwan que6tion but would encompass other 
d to improve relations and reduce tensions. With 
respect to the U.S. military presence on Taiwan, however, the policy 
of the United States,Govermnent is to reduce its 
lilitary presence

NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS 
AT 10:25 A.M. EST 
DECEMBER 24, 1970 
THURSDAY 
With respect to Communist China, and other of the 
major Communist countries, our position has been quite 
similar to the one that I have just described towards 
the Soviet Union. 
Early in the Administration, the President ordered 
an examination of the possibilities of easing some of the 
irritations in the relationship, especially in the field 
of trade and travel. And we, therefore, took a number of 
steps which removed some of these restrictions and which 
beyond that made clear to the Communist Chinese that the 
United States was prepared to talk seriously and to enable 
them to re-enter the international community. 
We are in the process now of again reviewing the 
still existing restrictions. We remain prepared, at Warsaw, 
or  _elsewhere to talk to the Communist Chinese about differences 
that divide us. There were some talks n Warsaw last year 
that were interrupted, but we stand prepared to resume them, 
applying the same principles that I have indicated govern 
our relationship to the Communist world, which is to seek, 
on the basis of equality, to remove the causes that have 
produced the tensions.

ZEE) PRESIDENT HAS SEEN.. 
THE PRESIDENT 
HENRY A. KISSINGER 
Conversation with Ambassador? Bogdan, 
Map Room, January 11, 1971 
Ambassador Bogdan told me that after the conversation with the President, 
Ceausescu sent his Vice Premier to Peking and Hanoi. In Peking he had 
extensive talks with Chou En-Lai. Chou En-Lai handed him the following 
message: 
"The communication from the U.S. President is 
not new. There is only one outstanding issue between 
us -- the U.S. occupation of Taiwan. The PRC has 
attempted to negotiate on this issue in good faith for 
15 years. If the U.S. has a desire to settle the issue 
and .a proposa or its so u ion, ii- .. Vsll ?e 
FeTs-Mno receive a U.S. special envoy ifi7raing. 
This message has been reviewed by Chairman Mao and 
by Lin Piao. " 
Chou En-Lai added the comment that since President Nixon had visited 
Bucharest and Belgrade, he would also be welcome in Peking. 
The Vice Premier found nothing new in Hanoi.

Comment: (a) The Chinese note indirectly refers to the Yahyra cornmu-
nication. It also validates it because it is almost the same. 
.,(b) It is free of invective. 
(c) It strongly implies that the war

Ambassador Hilaly dictated the following in Mr. Kissinger's office at ? 
6:05 pm, December 9: 
The message was duly conveyed and Prime Minister Chou rn-Lai's 
reply given after three days of deliberations was as follows: 
"This (meaning the reply) *a not from me alone but from Chairman Mao 
and Vice Chairman Lin Piao as well. We thank the President of Pakistan 
? for conveying to us orally a message from President Nixon. China has 
always been. willing and has always tried to negotiate by peaceful moans. 
? Taiwan and .the Straits of Taiwan are an inalienable part of China which 
?- have now been occupied by foreign troops of the United States for the 
last fifteen years. Negotiations and talks have been going on with no 
? results whatsoever. In order to discuss this subject of the vacation of 
Chinese territories called Taiwan, a special envoy of President Nixon's 
will be most welcome in Peking." 
Chou En-Lai said, in the course of the conversation: 
."We have had messages from the United States from different sources in 
the past but this is the first time that the proposal has come from a Head, 
through a Head, to a Head. The United States knows that Pakistan is a 
great friend. of Chiaa and therefore we attach importance to the message." 
? President Yahya s comments: 
"I think it is significant that Chou En-Lai did not accept or reject the 
proposal as soon as it was made and that he consulted Mao and Lin Pia.o 
before giving the answer. This in itself reflects a trend which holcls 
out some possibility. Further, at no stage during the discussion with 
the Chinese leaders did they indulge in vehement criticism of the United 
States. The banquet speech of Vice Chairman Tung Pi-Wu alce made no 
reference to the United States by name. These are additional indications 
of modification of the Chinese approach in their relations with the United 
States."

THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Dedmon, since you have been so 
kind to me, I will be kind to you. 
Let the record show?and some of you will remember 
that time I was here in 1968?that Mr. Dedmon was the 
one that asked me the question about the People's Re-
public of China or Mainland China, if you want to call 
it that, and also let the record show, as you may recall, that 
at an editorial conference at the Chicago Sun-Timm last 
year you asked me the question again. 
The first two times I struck out. The third time we got 
a hit. That is all we can say. 
Let me put it all in perspective, however. 
What we have here is the result of a long process that 
began in my own thoughts even before 1968, the spring 
of 1968, when I answered that question at this conven-
tion. I wrote an article for Foreign Affairs?as a matter 
of fact, I think your question played off of that article at 
that time?in which I pointed out that we could not have 
what will be by the end of the century a billion of the 
most creative and able people in the world isolated from 
the world and that whoever was President of the United 
States had to develop a policy which would bring the 
isolation of a billion Chinese from the rest of the world to

The President's Remarks at a Question and Answer 
Session With a Panel of Six Editors and Reporters at the 
Society's Annual Convention. Ap7i116, 1971 
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CIIINA 
MR. DEDMON. Mr. President, when you last appeared 
before this convention prior to becoming President, you 
mentioned that laying the groundwork for future rela-
tions with the People's Republic of China would be one 
of the primary goals of your administration. 
In light of recent events, as well as the trade review 
which you have ordered, it looks like this is one area 
here you are considerably ahead of schedule. 
Do you think that we can anticipate an establishment 
of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of 
an end. 
I also pointed out that that was a long-range goal. T:h.s 
long-range goal of this administration and of the next one. 
whatever it  may be, must be two things: one, a_norrnal-, 
ization of the relations betu r."'" t"/::  overnment of  the 
United States and the Government of the  People's Re-
public of China, and two, the ending of the isolation or 
Mainland China from the  world community. 
Those are long-range goals. 
Let's begin with what we have done then. We can't go 
that far that fast in one jump. We cannot do it now. I 
will not speculate on it now, because it is premature to 
talk about either of those subjects, either recognition or 
admission to the United Nations. 
But I can point to the goal and what we have done to 
get toward that goal and what it can mean to the future. 
Over a year ago we relaxed, as you know, our travel 
conditions with regard to going to China, and also we 
made some relaxation with regard to trade. 
Finally, we had a response from the Chinese, as you 
know, last week. Then, on Wednesday of this week, I 
announced an additional relaxation with regard to trade 
restrictions and a relaxation with regard to Chinese who 
wanted to come to the United States. 
Now it's up to them. If they want to have trade in 
these many areas that we have opened up, we are ready. 
If they want to have Chinese come to the United States, 
we are ready. We are also ready for Americans to go 
there, Americans in all walks of life. 
But it takes two,of course. We have taken several 
,steps. They have taken one._We_are _prepared to take

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/07/29: LOC-HAK-464-10-1-4 
other steps in the, trade field and also with regard to the 
cxehanige field, but each step must be taken one at a time. 
I know that as editors and as reporters, looking for 
that, you know, that hot lead or headline for the morn-
? ing, this is not a satisfying answer. But from the stand-
? point of policy, it is the right answer. Because to try to 
make a headline by saying that tomorrow we are going 
to do this or that or the other thing would be misunder-
stood among many countries of the world where this 
matter has to be discussed and also might have exactly 
the reverse reaction with the Chinese. 
think the steady ordered process that we have engaged 
on now begins to bear fruit. I will just conclude with this 
one thought: 
The other day was Easter Sunday. Both of my daugh-
ters, Tricia and Julie, were there?and Tricia with Eddie 
Cox?I understand they are getting married this June?
and Julie and David Eisenhower. 
? And the conversation got around to travel and also, 
of course, with regard to honeymoon travel and the rest. 
They were asking me where would you like to go? Where 
do you think we ought to go? 
So, I sat back and thought a bit and said, "Well, the 
place to go is to Asia." I said, "I hope that some time in 
your life, sooner rather than later, you will be able to 
go to China to see the great cities, and the people, and 
all of that, there." 
I hope they do. As a matter of fact, I hope sometime 
I do. I am not sure that it is going to happen while I am 
in office. I will not speculate with regard to either of the 
diplomatic points.  It is preinature to talk about recog-
nition. It is premature also to talk about a change of our 
_policy with regard to the United Nations. 
However, we are going to proceed in these very sub-
stantive fields of exchange of persons and also in the 
field of trade. That will open the way to other moves which 
will be made at an appropriate time. 
Mr. Risher. 
MR. RISHER. I just want to follow up on that if I 
cc2uld. Do you think that this might lead to a resumption 
of the meetings in Warsaw that were broken up about a 
year ago, I think? 
THE PRESIDENT. Well, Mr. Risher, as you recall those 
meetings were resumed after we came into office. That, 
again, was a result of an initiative that we took. And 
then they were broken off again. We are ready to meet 
any time they are ready to meet. 
I cannot?I don't have any information indicating that 
they want to resume them at this time, but we certainly 
have the door open. We are not pressing them, although 
we would welcome them opening them.

Message from Premier Chou En Lai dated April 21, 1971 (Delivered 
to Mr. Kissinger - 6:15 P.M., April 27, 1971). 
Message from Premier Chou En Lai  
Premier Chou En Lai thanked President Yahya for conveying 
the message of President Nixon on 5 January 1971. Premier Chou En Lai 
is very grateful to President Yahya and he will be grateful if President 
Yahya conveys the following verbatim to President Nixon: 
"Owing to the situation of the time it has not been possible to 
reply earlier to the message from the President of the U.S.A. to the 
Premier of Peoples Republic of China. 
"At present contacts between the peoples of China and the United 
States are being renewed. However, as the relations between China and 
the U.S.A. are to be restored fundamentally, the U.S. must withdraw 
all its Armed Forces from China's Taiwan and Taiwan Strait area. A 
solution to this crucial question can be found only through direct discussions 
between high-level responsible persons of the two countries. Therefore, 
the Chinese Government reaffirms its willingness to receive publicly 
in Peking a special envoy of the President of the U.S. (for instance, 
Mr. Kissinger)or the U.S. Secretary of State or even the President of 
the U.S. himself for direct meeting and discussions. Of course, 
if the 
U.S. President considers that the time is not yet right the matter may
