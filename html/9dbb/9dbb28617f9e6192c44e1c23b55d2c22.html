 tary study of the Communist strategy of
 peaceful coexistence.  In his examination of
 this  area,  Mr.  Allen analyzed  over  500
 articles, documents, and speeches of Com-
 munist  origin                           representing  some 11,000
 pages.
 The Center for Strategic Studies, George-
 town                       University,  whose  director is  Adm.
 Arleigh Burke, U.S.  Navy, retired,  former
 Chief of Naval Operations and member of
 the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of the Na-
 tion's outstanding graduate research centers
 engaged in the study of the multifaceted
 threat posed by the international Commu-
 nist movement.   This committee Is privi-
 leged to be able to turn to such knowledge-
 able and responsible scholars in the field as
 represented by Mr. Allen and other members
 of the center for strategic studies.
 The committee wishes to express its sin-
 cere appreciation to the West Publishing Co.,
 of St. Paul, Minn., which has freely provided
 the printing and publishing services neces-
 sary to produce this study.
 Obviously, no single pamphlet-or publica-
 tion will in Itself constitute an adequate an-
 swer to communism.  For this reason, the
 committee will continue to sponsor quality
 materials from responsible sources in this
 complex field.
 This study is informational and is not in-
 tended as a policy statement of the American
 Bar Association.  We urge leaders of the or-
 ganized bar, teachers, and civic leaders to ac-
 quaint themselves with the facts contained
 herein.  It is the hope of this committee that
 greater knowledge of the Communist threat
 will be gained by all citizens, and that the
 real dimensions of Communist objectives will
 be more clearly undertsood in the light of
 principal strategic pronouncements.
 The members of this committee, and its
 staff which so capably assist in this work, is
 in accord with our national desire to lead a
 peaceful existence in conjunction with all
 nations.  But we want to coexist without
 surrendering for ourselves or for others the
 concepts of. human dignity and the protec-
 tion of individual rights under a system of
 due process and the rule of law.  Genuine
 peace is one thing; the charade of Commu-
 nist peaceful coexistence as a game of. quite
 different intent.

 PREFACE
 On both sides of the Atlantic, it is now
 rumored that the cold war Is obsolete, ex-
 cept for the hostility of Mao Tse-tung and
 his followers.  Khrushchev Is pictured as a
 "reformed" Bolshevik, dreading nuclear war
 and seeking to lead Soviet communism away
 from world revolution toward the rule of law
 and middle-class affluence.  From this pre-
 mise, some contend that the West need not
 strengthen military, economic, and psycho-
 logical barriers to types of Soviet aggression
 that may shortly cease to exist.  It is urged,
 rather, that the next order of business is to
 encourage  Khrushchev's  "moderation"  by
 pressing for detente and relaxation of trade
 restrictions with Russia and her satellites.
 Some statesmen even argue that we should
 prepare for the neutralization of central
 Europe and the eventual disengagement of
 American forces from the Continent.   In
 short, on the hypothesis of a "peaceful evolv-
 ing Soviet Union," one new objective for
 NATO may be to preside over its self-liquida-
 tion.
 Obviously, few in the West would object
 to reducing defense budgets if genuine peace
 were in prospect.  But is it?'  Or is Khru-
 shchev using Pavlov and the hidden persuad-
 ers to advance Lenin's unchanging goals?
 Suppose that the massive "peaceful coexist-
 ence" propaganda of the U.S.S.R. and its
 oversea agents conceal an ambush?  Suppose
 that current interoffice memos of the Com-
 munist chiefs and ideologs call not for a
 reduction in tension but for an increase in
 class  warfare,  subversion,  and ideological
 combat?  Suppose Communist communiques
 promise more guerrilla thrusts into the vitals
 of Afro-Asia and Latin America?    Suppose
 that   very recent      Communist documents
 (published after the 1963 Treaty of Moscow)
 openly reveal how Moscow is again using
 "peaceful coexistence" as a charade to feint
 the democracies off, guard?   Assuming shy
 motives in the Kremlin (a not unreasonable
 supposition after 44 years of broken treaties
 and deceptions), who stands to benefit from
 another relaxation of vigilance?
 Is today's emphasis on peaceful coexistence
 a new departure for the Kremlin, or is it the
 repetition of a time-tested gambit for .re-
 tooling world revolution from temporary po-
 sitions of weakness?  It is useful to appraise
 Khrushchev's current tactic in the context
 of history; for, seen in this framework peace
 to the Communists is simply the continua-
 tion of war by other means.
 Marx himself believed that Communist and
 capitalist states were wholly incompatible.
 Marxism as official dogma still influences the
 behavior of Communist elites despite the
 flaws in his prophecy; and Marx taught the
 inevitability of Communist triumph in the
 highly developed nations of the West.  In
 a sense, communism deprived of its faith in
 the necessary obliteration of capitalism would
 be religion without belief in the certainty
 of judgment and life everlasting. Marxism
 must reject any genuine form of peaceful
 coexistence (on anything more than the tem-
 porary basis of expediency)  or cease to be.
 Lenin, the arch pragmatist of world revo-
 lution,  taught his cadres how to survive.
 through concession.  Confronted by hostile
 bourgeois states which did not succumb to
 worker uprisings in the wake of the Russian
 revolution, Lenin devised the technique of
 temporary and tactical "'peaceful coexist-
 ence."  At Brest-Litovsk, he signed a formal
 treaty with Germany which allowed Mother
 Russia to be dismembered.  Still hoping for
 a chain reaction of revolution now that the
 "weakest link" had been broken, Lenin made
 temporary peace with capitalism inside Rus-
 sia in order to build the economic sinews of
 his base.
 After Lenin's death in 1924, Trotsky con-
 tended that "socialism in one country"-a
 thesis advanced by Stalin-violated the basic
 principles of Marx and Lenin and betrayed
 the world revolution.
 The savage polemics that preceded Trot-
 sky's exile and assassination in Mexico by
 the victorious Stalin has obscured the fact
 that the disputing heirs of Lenin were not
 nearly so far apart as they seemed.  True,
 Stalin wanted to consolidate power in Russia
 before risking everything on revolution else-
 where; but Stalin never believed that Soviet.
 "socialism" was an end in itself.  More cau-
 tious than the theoretical Trotsky, Stalin
 wanted secure possession of the sturdiest
 lever and most powerful fulcrum for the
 eventual  upheaval  of  capitalist  citadels.
 Therefore,  he  became  the  manager       of
 "planned periods of peaceful coexistence"
 which enabled not only communism, but
 also Stalin, to survive.
 It is clear, therefore, that even for the
 patient Stalin, peace was a tactic and not a
 goal.  It gave him time to purge his rivals
 in the party.  It gave him time to collectivize
 the peasants.  It gave him time to industri-
 alize Russia.                                                                                                                                       But even as Stalin led the
 Soviet Union into the League of Nations, he
 financed plots, subversion, and popular fronts
 all over the world.  The Communist "peace
 movements" of the 1930's were designed pri-
 marily to ensure that a weak (but develop-
 ing) Soviet Union would not be crushed from
 the encircling capitalist powers; they in no
 way inhibited Moscow's agents from covert
 operations, industrial espionage, or building
 international fifth columns.
 When Stalin's game with Nazi Germany
 exploded in his face, he was quick to form
 alliances with those hated centers of capi-
 talism-England and America-whose arsen-
 als could furnish him with tools of defense.
 At war's end, he was prepared to exchange
 token gestures of cooperation with London
 and Washington for freedom to seize East-
 ern Europe.
 He even dissolved the Comintern in 1943
 to underscore the end of Communist sub-
 version abroad, an event hailed in Western
 circles as the formal termination of Bolshe-
 vik ambitions and a sure sign of evolution.
 Somehow, the imagemakers have made the
 buoyant Khrushchev seem less threatening
 than the cruel Stalin.  Thus, we forget how
 often  Western  experts  on  Russia  proved
 Stalin's devotion to peace by citing his re-
 luctance to risk major war and the cynical
 sacrifice of foreign Communists to the in-
 terests of Russian foreign policy.  In retro-
 spect, evaluations of Stalin's foreign policy
 as peace oriented seem naive. Yet, iron-
 ically, the dread hand of Stalinism was more
 constrained to avoid world war than the
 flexible fingers of Khrushchev, who sought
 recklessly to engineer a nuclear ambush from
 Cuba.   (For that matter, despite the in-
 flammatory words, Red China's relative re-
 straint.with respect to invading the offshore
 islands, Taiwan, India, and southeast Asia
 shows Peiping is not much more adventur-
 istic than was Moscow with its wall in Berlin.
 its rocket threats over Suez, and its hidden
 missiles in Cuba.)   That Khrushchev, like
 Stalin,  often  tempers an  activist  foreign
 policy with prudent regard for the future
 of Russia only underlines the essential con-
 tinuity of Soviet strategy from Lenin to the
 present.
 Communist philosophy, consistent Soviet
 behavior over four decades, and recent party
 directives combine to show that peaceful co-
 existence is a carefully formulated strategic
 course of action designed to attain revolu-
 tionary goals at minimum cost and with
 minimum risk to the headquarters of the
 conflict elite.
 It behooves the American people, there-
 fore, to.ask the question, "Cui bono?"  Who
 benefits, and how, from the illusion that
 Khrushchev is different not only in degree
 but in kind from Stalin or Mao?  Or per-
 haps we should ask Lenin's question, "Who
 is doing what to whom?"-relevant to the
 cooperation of Communists with their an-
 tagonists.
 CONCLUSION
 Communist actions and Communist words
 prove that Communist goals are unchanged.
 The danger may well be greater now, in our
 moment of one-sided relaxation, than in the
 tense days of naked Stalinism.  The "split"
 between China and the U.S.S.R. may be of
 benefit to freedom in the long run.  In the
 short run, polycentrism in the Communist
 world means we are menaced by two com-
 peting strategies: (1) the revolutionary vio-
 lence of Chinese-oriented                                                                                                                                         Communists  in,

 sophisticated Popular Front subversion of
 Russian-alined Communist factions.  Mos-
 cow and Peiping agree that capitalism and

 human liberty are still the primary targets.
 Both subsidize class war, ideological war,
 and guerrilla war. while debating with each
 other as to whether vie-are a paper tiger
 or a nuclear lamb.  There is no evidence,
 in Communist documents or actions, that
 U .S. policy can be safely based on hopes for
 genuine   accommodation   or   convergence.
 Quite to the contrary, Moscow and Peiping
 both assert that capitalism must be forced
 to disappear from the earth.   Their debate
 is, "How and When?"
 Nevertheless,  the  Communist  bloc     has
 weaknesses: industrial, agricultural. ideolog-
 Ical, and                political. It  is vulnerable  to
 economic sanctions  and political  warfare.
 Its disregard for human dignity saps its
 vitality.  Communist Parties all over the
 world can be embarrassed, isolated, rendered
 impotent.  Until there is genuine change in
 the  goals and  techniques  of Communist:
 dictatorship, the United States must main-
 tain a shield of invincible military deter-
 rence.  From behind that shield, we should;
 use our own propaganda sword to quarantine,
 divide, and undermine aggressive Communist
 power. That no genuine change in Com-
 munist alms has as yet been effected is
 abundantly clear from the analysis of cur-
 rent Communist documents which follows:
 "As soon as we are strong enough to defeat
 capitalism as a whole, we shall immediately
 take it by the scruff of the neck."-Vladimir
 Lenin, 1920.
 "A fight is In progress between these two
 systems, a life and deith combat.  But 'we :
 Communists want to win this struggle with
 the-least losses and there is no doubt what-
 soever    that    we    shall    win."-Nikita
 Khrushchev, 1963.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 on
 HON. WALT HORAN
 OF WASHINGTON
 IN THE HOUSE OF t'_EPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, Septfmber 22, 1964
 Mr, HORAN.           M:'.  Speaker,  under
 leave to extend my own remarks in the
 Appendix of the RECORD, I have been im-
 mensely impressed with the observations
 of a native South Carolinian as reported
 by Marguerite Higgins In the "Point of
 View" column of the September 21 Wash-
 ington Evening Star.
 Without entering into the difficulties
 that may exist in Sc?uth Carolina polit-
 ically, I feel that these expressions are
 consonant with the feeling of a great
 many people in our Nation.  We cannot
 proceed on any progl am of progress, any
 program of constructive education, any
 program of prosperity-which I suppose
 means the elimination of poverty-with
 justice coming from the streets.  Riot-
 ing and looting are too often the hand-
 maidens of protest that graduates to
 violence.  We must :lave law and order:
 that is commensurate with the dignity
 of this great Nation that espouses free-
 dom of the individual, his right to prog-
 ress, his right to education and his free-
 dom to achieve that of which he Is ca-
 pable.  Any diversio:i from this format
 is, In my opinion, not In agreement with
 our destiny.

 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 GRzEiivn.Lz, 8.C. In all. fairness, Senator
 GQLDWA'('ZR'S tour of the Southadded up to
 nothing less than a smashing personal tri-
 umph.
 But riost fascinating now that It is all
 over is to investigate the reasons and the
 light they shed on some deep new stirrings
 in this part of America.
 Watcling the GOP nominee in action Im-
 mediately brought to mind the great contrast
 in campaign styles between President John-
 son and Senator GOLDWATER.
 President Johnson cries hallelujah-Sen-
 ator Gol DWATER cries havoc.  With the Presi-
 dent, it is good tidings all the way and, glory
 be, a great society just around the corner.
 With Senator GOLDWATER, there are intima-
 tions of doom-a nuclear gap, a morality gap,
 a legality gap, a victory gap-and prediction;
 that socialism is going "to git you If you
 don't wi.tch out." all delivered In the matter-
 of-fact tones that might be used by a teacher
 describi ig how to put together and operate
 a ham radio set.
 FRIENDLY AUDIENCES
 With Evangelist Johnson, the audiences
 have been friendly, often enthuelatic, al-
 though                                                         in                                     Individual  conversation  they
 sometimes give the impression of being more
 against Senator GOLDWATER than for Presi-
 dent Johnson.
 But here In the Southland, in the case of
 the matter-of-fact Mr. GOLDWATTER. there was
 evangelism all right-not in the candidate's
 manner  certainly, but in  the audiences
 whose fervor had to be witnessed to be be-
 lieved. And it is not just a speech-day thing
 either.
 Here in the lovely green foothills of the
 Carolinas, the Republicans have been work-
 ing steafily and doggedly. In the Greenville-
 Spartanburg area alone, they have quad-
 rupled she number of volunteer Republican
 campaign  workers.   Crossovers  from  the
 Democrats to the Republicans have Increased
 25 percent over 1960.
 VICTORY ANTICIPATED
 The test of the State claims roughly the
 same percentage of gain.   Republican lead-
 ers here point out that in 1960. Richard
 Nixon, with only a-skeleton GOP organiza-
 tion, loiit to John Kennedy by barely 10,OOC
 votes.  So the Goldwaterites think they BPI
 a Repu3tiean victory in November because
 they expect more Democrats to join theft
 ranks, checkmating a probable Increase in
 the Negro vote against Senator GOLDWATER
 Who are these Carolina Goldwaterites?
 They  are  the  newly  minted  middle
 classes---lower, middle and Upper?who arc
 the South's new breed.
 It is a new breed of self-made men ant
 women who have turned their back on thi
 mores of the decayed southern aristocracy
 where charm was sometimes held to be more
 Important than accomplishment and whert
 an aristocratic heritage was a frequent ex-
 cuse for Indolence.
 - This new breed of self-made southerner
 has come Into dominance because of tht
 swift Industrialization of the South sine(
 1945--an industrialization so new that it bat
 been free of the alum-making accompani-
 ment of the past.
 PROGRESS IS  SEEN
 Integ.,ation, for example, has progressed
 sufficiently in the schools so that there is e
 ring of sincerity about it when a Carolintar
 says: "We are not against Negro rights.  We
 are against the Federal Government's en-
 croachment, not just in the civil rights field
 but all fields."
 What does this now breed want?
 By and large, it in not to turn the clock
 back though there are a few Federal func-
 tions that the people would like to see turned
 back to the individual State.  In the main
 the South's new middle class wants to put a
 brake on the Federal Government's power.
 It is a "this far and no farther" attitude.
 Social security as presently organized is fine
 but any drastic increase or change would be
 opposed.
 A  SOUTHERNER  SPEAKS
 But where Mr. COLDWATER touches these
 people most deeply is In his philosophy of
 what America and Americans ought to be.
 It is not easy to discover a southerner's real
 feelings because he rarely puts them into
 words and often is embarrassed to try and do
 so with newspaper reporters who are regarded
 automatically as members of the "liberal
 establishment"-an   establishment   whose
 values are viewed as at least partly respon-
 sible for what's wrong with America.
 As one Republican precinct worker put it:
 "This country is suffering from a bad case of
 double standard.
 "If there Is a riot. these slick liberal wrlt-
 era ooze sympathy for the 'poor rioters.'
 It's not really the fault of the guy that
 bashed the cop's heed in and broke the store
 window and stole six television sets, or so we
 are told.  This poor guy just got riot happy
 because he Is living In poverty, the neigh-
 borhood is a slum, there is garbage in the
 alley, or his mother didn't love him enough.
 "None of these liberals ever say this rioter
 is a bum, a criminal and lazy and no good.
 "So long as the rioter is treated as a hero
 and the cop is treated as a beast, the decline
 of law and order is Inevitable.  Nobody ever
 says that tenants can be just as responsible
 for creating alum conditions as the land-
 lord.                           -
 "Why don't they have a clean up and paint
 up Harlem week?  If they don't like garbage
 in their alleys, why do they dump it there in
 the first place?  My family was so poor that
 as a teenager I had to be up at dawn milk-
 ing cows, delivering groceries, and the like.
 "I could hardly watt for each day to begin.
 It was a happy life and It never occurred to
 me to go and start a riot because I only had
 one pair of shoes every 2 years and didn't
 taste Ice cream until. I was 15.
 "Some 'of America's finest hours were in
 the days when most of the population was
 living in what the sociologists would pit-
 ingly label as poverty.  In those days pov-
 erty was not something you started gang
 warfare over or stole or rioted or killed.  It
 was something thzt you used grit, self-
 reliance, and pride to overcome.
 "Those qualities were not sneered at then.
 Now they are sneered at.  Pride in country
 Is considered naive.
 "It Is even considered naive to think that
 a great power like .he United States should
 have Insisted that  he Soviet Union live up
 to  its  International  treaties  Instead  of
 knuckling under as we so shamefully did
 when the Berlin wall was built.  The more
 Central Government takes over control of the
 human being's destiny, the weaker he be-
 comes, along with his moral fiber and his
 country's moral fiber.
 "People like GOLDWATER believe in such
 things as moral fiber and you Easterners can
 sneer all you want.  He is trying to stop the
 process of decay and that is why we are for
 him because we think our lives, our pride,
 and our human dignity are at stake."

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -APPENDIX
 increasing evidence of anti-Semitic ac-
 tivity on the part of the Government of
 the Soviet Union.  Once prominent and
 among the leaders of the professions,
 sciences, and administrators of the Gov-
 ernment and the Communist Party with-
 in the U.S.S.R., since 1948 Soviet Jewry
 has been increasingly subject to religious,
 social, economic, and employment dis-
 crimination.
 There are estimated to be some 3 mil-
 lion Jews in the Soviet Union, although
 the number cannot be exactly figured be-
 cause of many hundreds of leading Jew-
 ish intellectuals who were imprisoned in
 1948, and of whom many perished.  In
 fact, some two dozen of their leaders
 were executed in 1952.
 Although Soviet practice and, in fact,
 the Soviet Constitution recognizes the
 right of cultural and national groups
 within the U.S.S.R. to maintain and per-
 petuate their own identities, this right is
 not accorded to the Jewish community-
 the only minority group to which it is
 denied.
 Jews are forbidden schools of their
 own, are not permitted classes in Yiddish
 or Hebrew in the other schools, and are
 denied classes in the Russian language on
 Jewish culture and history. The effect,
 of course, is to deny Soviet Jews any
 real opportunity to perpetuate their iden-
 tity and cultural values. In addition, the
 Jewish religion is subjected to particular
 discrimination by forbidding them to
 maintain national religious organiza-
 tions, by the forcible closing of syna-
 gogues in many areas, and by vicious
 press attacks against Jewish groups and
 the few synagogues which do remain.
 Because the Government controls the
 press in the Soviet Union, the respon-
 sibility for these attacks must be borne
 by the Soviet Government. In addition,
 leading officials of synagogues in Mos-
 cow and Leningrad have been arrested
 and imprisoned an charges of espionage.
 The Soviet authorities usually claim that
 these men are spying for the State of
 Israel.
 The severe hampering of religious ac-
 tivities, and the antipathy of the author-
 ities toward religious observances is, of
 course, an official program of the Com-
 munists and is directed against all activ-
 ities which seek to worship a Supreme
 Being. However, their activities against
 the Jewish religion in the Soviet Union
 have been much stronger and show a par-
 ticular strain of hate and repression.
 The proportion of Jews in universities
 has declined from more than 13 percent,
 30 years ago, to about 3 percent today.
 Official observers believe this has been
 brought about through a planned policy
 of discrimination and quotas.
 Thousands of Jewish families were
 broken and spread over other parts of
 the world as the result of the Nazi In-
 vasion.  Many of the refugees now live
 in Israel or West "European countries
 Yet the Soviet authorities have denied
 permission to Jewish family members
 remaining in the Soviet Union to leave
 the U.S.S.R. in order to be reunited with
 their families elsewhere.
 Despite the full recognition of these,
 and many more effects of obvious Jew-
 ish repression within the U.S.S.R., the
 official policy of our Department of State
 has been, and continues to be, that no
 official protests should be made to the
 Soviet authorities.  The reason given is
 that such official recognition and pres-
 sure on the Soviet Government by our
 Government might bring about certain
 repercussions and retaliation on Soviet
 Jewry.  Obviously, no one can predict
 what reaction would take place within
 the Soviet Government to an official pro-
 test by our Department of State, but I do
 feel that the Department's policy, while
 taking cognizance of this problem, has
 the effect of sweeping it under the rug.
 I believe that more official recognition
 should be taken of Jewish repressions in
 the Soviet Union, and that more pub-
 licity should be given throughout our
 Nation and the world to the undeniable
 facts of Jewish persecution by Commu-
 nist authorities.  I c,all upon the De-
 partment of State and all other appro-
 priate agencies of our Government, such
 as the U.S. Information Agency, to in-
 crease their activities in this regard, and
 I strongly hope that the President will
 direct them to do so.

 Mr. CELLER.                                                  Mr. Speaker, it was
 with a sense of loss that I learned of
 the death of Frank L. Auerbach, Deputy
 Director of the Visa Office of the De-

 and respect greatly Mr. Auerbach.  His
 career bespeaks his unique talents. He
 was Immigration Counsel to social agen-
 cies in Germany and assistant case con-
 sultant to social agencies in the United
 States.  He worked with the War Relo-
 cation Authority of the Department of
 Interior and was a lecturer of - both
 Hunter College and Columbia Univer-
 sity in New York City.  He began his
 work with the Department of State in
 1948 as a consultant to the Chief of the
 Visa Division and became Assistant Di-
 rector of the Visa Office in 1955 and
 Deputy Director in 1962.
 Mr. Auerbach is the author of "Imni-
 gration Laws of the United States,
 "Nationality  Problems  of  Children,"
 "Principles Which Should Underlie our
 Nationality Laws," "The Admission and
 Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the
 United States," and "The Immigration
 and Nationality Act, a Summary of Its
 Principal Provisions."
 Mr. Auerbach's matchless knowledge
 of the immigration laws, his compassion,
 his dedication to his work, his unfailing
 courtesies to all who sought of his time
 and his talent, made him the public serv-
 ant beyond reproach.  His death leaves
 a void in an area where there are too
 few experts.  He served us well and he
 will not be forgotten.
 I extend my deepest sympathy to his
 wife and children, and to all of the mem-
 bers of his family.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EDWARD HUTCHINSON
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 23, 1964
 Mr, HUTCHINSON.  Mr. Speaker, if
 in these times of economic prosperity
 our Government  cannot balance its
 budget and limit its spending within the
 revenues it receives, can it ever do so?
 In time of economic adversity and in
 time of war, expenditures in excess of
 revenues are frequently necessary.  In
 time of general prosperity, sound fiscal
 policy requires a balanced budget with
 provision for the reduction of public
 debt.
 At the beginning of the present Con-
 gress, the Kennedy administration pre-
 sented for our consideration a budget
 intentionally unbalanced. On February
 28, 1963, I reported to the people of the
 Fourth Congressional District of Michi-
 gan my concern about the new econo-
 ics in the following words:
 "Economic theorists close to the Pres-
 ident are trying to convince the Ameri-
 can people-as they have already con-
 vinced the President-that the way to
 an ever-expanding prosperity is to cut
 the revenues, increase the spending, and
 go further into debt.
 "It is tragic that the power of govern-
 ment has fallen into the control of those
 espousing so unsound a doctrine.   A
 prosperity based upon debt is indeed a
 house built upon sand. Debt is borrow-
 ing from the future.  In the future, the
 debt must either be paid or repudiated.
 There is no third alternative.
 "In the experience of us all, debt is a
 burden and a reduction of net worth.
 Still, the New Frontier speaks of in-
 creasing the national debt as though it
 were an asset.  The President refers to
 `increasing the debt in ways that serve
 to strengthen the debtor.'
 "Such strange doctrine is a complete
 reversal from   the  sound  beliefs  of
 George Washington, who said: `Avoid
 the accumulation of debt, not merely by
 shunning occasions of expense, but by
 vigorous exertions in time of peace dis-
 charge the debts which unavoidable
 wars may have occasioned, not ungen-
 erously throwing upon posterity the bur-
 dens which we ourselves ought to bear,'
 "Washington's admonition was fol-
 lowed in every generation until our own.
 In these times of relative prosperity, we
 should be reducing the national debt.
 The President urges us to increase it.
 He tells us that the size of the debt may
 be disregarded. Let it increase, he says,
 and reduce the income tax to spur what
 he calls a sluggish economy.
 "Now a tax cut is appealing.  If we
 could take home a greater portion of the
 paycheck, we could purchase. more, save
 more and invest more.  But consider
 what will be the situation if the Govern-
 ment goes on spending without stint:
 By reason of the tax cut, the tax reve-
 nues will be reduced, so, in order to pay
 for its spending, the Government will

 have to borrow more to fill the gap be-
 tween revenue coming in and spending
 going out,
 "If the Governmer.t borrows from the
 people, it will take from them all the
 increase' they thought they would have
 for use in the free economy. If the Gov-
 ernment borrows from the banking sys-
 tem, more dollars will be issued to pay;
 the Government's bills, resulting in infla-
 tion. In that case, the expected increase
 in take-home pay will evaporate in in-
 creased prices.  If taxes are reduced,
 there must be a reduction in Government
 spending; otherwise, there can be no
 spur in the free economy.
 "If our economy is sluggish, as the.
 President says is the case, it is because of
 the deficit-debt policy of the Govern-
 ment.  A government which actually
 lived within its.tax Income and system
 atically reduced its debt would so stimu-
 late the economy that the economy would
 move forward with confidence and en-
 thusiasm. Then we would experience a'
 sound economic expansion, producing
 revenues sufficient perhaps to permit a;
 tax reduction,"
 Now, in 1964, as this Congress comes to
 a close. it must be recorded that our na-
 tional debt limit has been increased from.
 $308 billion to $315 billion to $324 bil-
 lion-in a 2-year period of general pros-
 perity.
 We are living off the future when we
 ought to be living within our means;
 when we ought to be reducing, not In-
 creasing, the national debt.

 the disregard for law and order that is

 merits our attention:
 COMPLEXITIES OF POLI-cE PaoTzc ioN AMAs.EQ
 REPORTER ON PATROL DUTY
 (By Lyn ;3aunoras)
 It was Saturday. August 29, and I had been
 given approval by Police Chief Edward Bar-
 cal to accompany a sq.iad car from 9 to mid-
 night on Its routine patrol of the village.  `
 I sat in the back sect alone with Sgt. Tony
 Azzarrello at the wheel and Police Com-
 missioner Joe Wazny nt his side. Along with
 many other residents, no doubt, I had always
 assumed that police protection meant merely
 answering and checking out complaints regs
 istered by citizens.                          `
 That was a very wrong assumption. Police
 protection is all-embracing and fantastic In
 Its thoroughness. All residents would find It
 fascinating to tour with the men in blue at
 they patrol and protect the village during a
 shift icoking for trouble, covering bad traf-
 fio  intsrsectlone,  checking  out  business
 houses, alleys, schools, parking lots, homes
 questioning loiterers, stopping violators the'
 note wi.h a quick. observing eye, all between
 investigations of complaints.
 In 3 hours, there were only two calls from
 the police desk to check out.  The rest of the
 time wea just touring, touring and checking
 checking,  checking.   Nothing  went  un-
 noticed                                                          A young couple sitting to a door-
 way holding hands was questioned by Azzar-
 reilo and when he found neither one lived it
 the apartment house whose doorway the)
 were utilizing, he asked them nicely to mov<
 along.
 Asked why, since it seemed almost a shame
 to disturb them, be responded that apart-
 ment tenants and landlords complain about
 persons who do not live In the building+-
 taking up the doorway.  Sometimes, wher
 tenants want to enter or leave the bulldini_
 and they find couples or gangs sitting on the
 doorste,, they get abusive language in re-
 sponse to their request to move aside. There-
 fore. complaints are lessened by gettinf
 right tc the source.
 Groups of teenagers are watched carefully
 and the grouping is discouraged wherever
 possible.  Reason for this is that another
 gang, cruising In a car may stop before i,
 group standing arofmd a corner and sud-
 denly a "rumble" erupts. On this night four'
 boys crossing Prairie Avenue joined threw
 others in front of the Purple Plum and the;
 proceeded down Grand Boulevard.
 At the same moment the first message from
 the  desk  came  through:  someone  had
 broken the drinking fountain at Kiwaniti
 Park at the base and the water was gushing
 out hee.vtly_  It was possible the four cross
 lag Prt,irie had come from the park amen
 they ware coming from that direction. "I'
 they're responsible for the destruction, they'll
 be wet." Aznarrello said and drove off lit
 pursuit of the group which he Intercepted
 at Washington.
 He stopped, talked to all of them, viewed
 their itentifieatton and checked for any wet.
 ness.  There was none.  None of the boy t
 were Irons Brookfield; they were all pouts
 and ccoperative.  One 15-year-old had no
 L.D. and Azzarrello asked him why.  No rea-
 son, just didn't have any, he was told.
 Back in the squad. Azzarrello questioned
 the wisdom of parents who allow their chil-
 dren out without any type of identification.
 He pointed out that a boy or girl walking
 alone could be hit by a car and taken to =t
 hospital where he might need an emergenc 7
 operation in order to save his life. A doctor
 cannot operate or even treat-a minor with-
 out consent of the parents. How would the!
 locate the parents of an unconscious youth
 with no identification?
 Around the swimming pool we went, check-
 ing from every vantage point with flashligh+-.
 The spotlight Is- not used because it tends
 to scare off persons a block away who might
 be up to malicious mischief and are thus
 warner: of an approaching squad.  The po -l
 was deserted, as was its immediate vicinit'..
 Going down Shields, Azzarrello suddenly
 flashed his light on the car in front, bring-
 ing that driver to a halt.  As he talked to
 the driver. I looked the car over carefull,,,
 trying to find why he had stopped hint.
 Nothing appeared out of order.  So when
 he said. "O$. be sure you take care of ft
 now" .o the teenaged driver and got back
 Into the squad car, it was our first question.
 There was no light over the back licence
 plate.  Again he flashed his light at the dt -
 parting car.  "See 'that?" be asked.  Then
 I did, "In case of a burglary. bow could wii-
 nesses take the license number?  Such a
 car becomes a suspicious object.  I just
 warned him to get a light on there." Mean-
 while, he had taken the youth's name, ad-
 dress and license plate number and will be
 checking it out to be sure the light is there
 next time.  Just it precaution that could
 be a lifesaver at a later date.
 Then the second message came through.
 Resident at 4307 Eberly Avenue reported
 someone peering Into a window. Young. thin
 man who ran north through the alley.  In a
 whisk, we tore off to Eberly Avenue from
 Washington and k4cCormick. In minutes flat
 we were there, going up and down the streets,
 side streets and alleys, checking and flashing.
 There was no one in sight.  But Azzarrello
 made a wide sweep around the area, taking
 no chances of missing anyone afoot getting
 away.
 And then we went on a round ofveritable
 death traps for police.  There were narrow,
 dark passageways where a squad car would
 be at a handicap, bidden stairways, high,
 flat roofs made easily accessible for those
 hiding out.  Azzarrello flashed his light down
 one passageway leading from the alley to the
 street. "See anything?" he asked. We didn't.
 Then he lowered the flashlight and the side-
 walk bellied in the .enter, making it an ideal
 place for a person to lie flat.
 A policeman unfamiliar with the gully,
 would flash his light straight through, as
 he had the first time, and see nothing. "Far
 100-percent protection, At is absolutely essen-
 tial for a policeman to be completely familiar
 with every place in the village," " he said.
 This, we made it mental note, was another
 good argument against a metropolitan police
 force.  How would a policeman from Oak
 Lawn or Chicago know about a gully in a cer-
 tain sidewalk In -Br aokfield?
 The dangers lurking in the shadows of bus-
 iness houses bothered me, and I asked if
 business operators were aware of the pitfalls
 they presented police In the performance of
 their duties.  But Azzarrello wasn't com-
 plaining.  "I consider it a personal chal-
 lenge," he smiled.  "I know these trouble
 spots so well by now that I feel if anything
 happens to me, I deserve It for letting It
 happen."
 But what of the new men?  There are too
 many places where they'd be sitting ducks.
 It's something residents should know about
 because the protection at every angle given
 by their police department borders on the
 unbelievable.  Even cobwebs on doorways
 are examined because they indicate no one
 has opened the door 1n, 4 hours.  Periodically
 the department or village hall will receive a
 note of gratitude from a resident who has
 had first-hand experience In utilizing the
 services of the department in an emergency.
 But emergencies are just a small part of
 the facets of police work they do not know
 about and probably will never know about.
 They can only be assured that Brookfield Is
 one of the best protected suburbs In the
 county.  The fact that only four messages
 came through In 3 hours on a Saturday night
 (the other two we're handled by the other
 squad car under Officer Rick Gallas) proves
 the point.
 Of course, this was an unusually quiet
 evening.  The police department averages
 about 7,000 complaints per year and as of
 September 1, had already passed the 4,000
 mark.
 It was obvious that residents do nothing
 to make their Jobe. easier.  There were open
 overhead doors on garages, just begging
 burglars or delinquents to help themselves,
 cars  standing  unattended  with  motors
 running.
 The fact that 60 miles had been put on by
 Azzarrello during tits shift from 4 to 12 p.m.
 and that upward to 100 miles per shift have
 been put on by squad cars, just within the
 limits of Brookfield. certainly proves without
 doubt the vigilant, careful, thorough pro-

 Religious Pe}ecution in the Soviet Union
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM G. BRAY
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 23, 1964
 Mr. BRAY.                  Mr. Speaker, the follow-
 ing letter describing religious persecu-
 tion in the Soviet Union was sent by way
 of Poland to the editor of Novoye Russ-
 koye Slovo, a Russian-language news-
 paper published in New York City.  It
 was brought to my attention by Mr. Paul
 Voronaeff, of Indianapolis, Ind., and its
 graphic description of intimidation and
 terror lends little support to the theory
 that the Soviet Union is mellowing:
 To all children of God who compose the
 church of Jesus Christ-to all evangelical
 Christian Baptists living in our land, from
 east  to  west  and  from  north  to  south,
 "Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him
 which is, and which was, and which is to
 come" (Revelation 1: 4).
 Beloved brothers and sisters in the Lord.
 We decided to inform you about a sad
 event of which we were the witnesses.  The
 grief which we wish to share with you is our
 common sadness, because we all are one
 church which is the body of Christ (1 Corin-
 thians 12: 26) : "And whether one member
 suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one
 member be honored, all the members rejoice
 with it."
 January 11, 1964, Sister Maria Ivanovna
 Chmara, living in Village Kulunda, Altai Re-
 gion, received information from the prison
 in the City of Barnaul that her husband
 passed away.  It was confirmed by a tele-
 gram  communication  that  she  is now  a
 widow, with her four children between the
 ages of 13 years to 1 month.  Her husband,
 Brother.Nicolaj Kuzmich Chmara, born 1916,
 together with his wife, joined the church in
 1963. This short life in Christ was a vivid
 example of a new life to all with whom he
 led his former life of drunkenness.
 The church at Kulunda, of which he was
 a member, testifies of him that he sincerely
 loved the Lord and served Him with all his
 house.  He loved to sing the hymn:
 "I was called to work on this earth,
 To fight with every idol,                 -
 Not looking on the fearful friends,
 To be a witness before the world.
 And not afraid of the judgment of the men."
 It was December 24-27, 1963, that he, with
 Brother F. I. Subbotin and his brother and
 sister, B. K. Chmara and L. M. Chmara, ap-
 peared before the court and together with
 others was sentenced for the name of Christ
 for good and conscientious behavior.  After
 the sentence of the court he spent just 2
 weeks in prison, and then the communica-
 tion came that he is dead.
 January 13, 1964, the widow and relatives
 of the dead, together with us, got from the
 prison the body of Nicolaj Kuzmich.  Dur-
 ing the trial by the court, the relatives and
 friends had seen him in perfect health and
 cheerful.  But what did we see when we got
 him dead?  On his hands are seen marks of
 chains. The palms of the hands are burned;
 the fingers and bottoms of both feet are
 burned.    The lower part of the abdomen
 has marks of wounds made by piercing with
 a sharp and red-hot object, right leg is swol-
 len, both feet have pierced wounds, and the
 body with signs and bruises. When we saw
 all this we had mixed feelings-of deep grief
 and joy.  Our grief is because our dear
 brother Nicolaj Kuzmich had to pass through
 such brutal trials and accept death in the
 prison walls.  We grieve for the unhealed
 wounds made by godless hands upon the
 innocent hearts of children.   Not for evil
 deeds, but for good, for love to the people,
 to the Lord, and for His name, he bore it
 all as a good soldier of Jesus Christ and was
 faithful to Him unto death.    We are filled
 with a deep sorrow at seeing the widow and
 her children crying at the casket, with diffi-
 culty recognizing the face of their father.
 We tried to comfort them and ourselves with
 the fact that we all have the Father of or-
 phans and widows-and there is a righteous
 Judge, the Christ.
 During 4 days and nights at the casket
 were many brothers and sisters from afar
 and from the local area who solemnly con-
 ducted services.   The funeral service took
 place in the afternoon of January 16, 1964,
 with a procession through the town singing
 hymns and carrying placards which read:
 "For to me to live is Christ and to die is
 gain."
 "Fear not them which kill the body, but
 are not able to kill the soul."
 "I saw under the altar the souls of them
 that were slain for the word of God."
 After the burial of the body of the de-
 ceased brother we returned to our respective
 places with thanksgiving and with greater
 zeal to serve the Lord and to be faithful to
 Him unto death as our brother was.
 Beloved brothers and sisters, we know that
 the first question that will arise in your
 mind is-What for?  What official charges
 were presented against him by the court of
 prosecutors and for what reason was he
 sentenced to death?
 For the answer we present some  tran-
 scripts from the sentence of Altai Regional
 Court, Act No. 142, where it said that a
 group of Baptists conducted illegal meet-
 ings under unsanitary conditions, drawing
 the youth and teenagers into the sect group.
 Under cover of "cleaning up," they propa-
 gated against CUECB (Council of Union of
 Evangelical Christian-Baptists in Moscow)
 and its position and kept contact with other
 likewise illegal groups and other like charges.
 This is the definition of the court, accord-
 ing to which Brother F. I. Subbotin was sen-
 tenced to 5 years of strict imprisonment;
 two brothers, Wasilij and Nicoalj Chmara, to
 3 years of jail; and their sister, L. M. Chmara,
 to 2 years with suspension.
 Yes, in our days "unusual" things hap-
 pen.  We call your attention: Discuss and
 tell this to all people who love the Lord.
 Tell about this to large and small.  To all
 who still fear God and who desire to meet
 with Christ.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. AUGUSTUS F. HAWKINS
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 23, 1964
 Mr. HAWKINS.  Mr. Speaker, in the
 recent appointment of Loren Miller to
 the municipal court of Los Angeles as a
 judge,  well-deserved  recognition  has
 been given to one who has assiduously
 and without personal aggrandizement
 given of his time and talent to the cause
 of human justice.
 The following article by Paul Weeks,
 staff writer for the Los Angeles Times,
 highlights some of his major accom-
 plishments in the field of civil rights, and
 I am pleased to insert it in the RECORD :
 [From the Los Angeles Times, May 17, 19841
 NEW JUDGE RELUCTANT MEMBER OF PROFES-
 SION:  DRAGGED  INTO  LAW  "KICKING  AND
 SCREAMING," SAYS NEGRO NAMED TO BENCH
 BY GOVERNOR BROWN
 (By Paul Weeks)
 Los Angeles' newest municipal court judge
 is a spindly, bespectacled man of 61 who ad-
 mits he never wanted to be a lawyer.
 "I was dragged kicking and screaming into
 the practice of law because, you know, in
 those days a Negro could be a-doctor, lawyer
 or schoolteacher-and that's about all," said
 Loren Miller as he relaxed in his Silver Lake
 district home late last week.
 A few days- earlier, Tuesday to be exact, he
 had been appointed by Governor Brown to
 fill the unexpired term of the late Judge
 Ernestine Stahlhut.
 BEGAN ON FARM
 Miller views his rise from Nebraska farm
 boy to the bench with easygoing, low-key
 humor.  But it's been a long time since
 Loren Miller was a farm boy setting out to
 practice law.
 Today he is regarded as one of the Nation's
 great living civil rights attorneys, with a
 trailblazing  history  of  triumphs,  particu-
 larly in the field of housing discrimination,
 behind him.            -
 The most celebrated, Shelley v. Kramer,
 came in 1948 when the U.S. Supreme Court
 delivered the epochal decision that racial
 covenants on property cannot be enforced by
 the courts.
 HIGH COURT VICTORY
 "That was for a Detroit man who bought
 a piece of property, and was denied the right
 to occupy it when it was found he was a
 Negro," Miller recalled.  "We lost that one all
 the way up-until the Supreme Court re-
 versed it."
 Miller said he "guessed" he had tried about
 100 racial covenant cases, beginning in about
 1939, "before we got that Supreme Court de-
 cision."
 That was followed by a series of precedent
 setting legal victories by Miller against hous-
 ing discrimination.  They included: A Cali-
 fornia ruling that a white property owner
 could  not  collect damages  from  another
 Caucasian because the latter sold racially re-
 stricted property to a Negro.
 A 1954 State supreme court decision which
 forbade the city of San Francisco from fol-
 lowing neighborhood racial patterns in rent-
 ing public housing.
 A 1962 appellate court ruling that a land-
 lord cannot evict a tenant because of his
 race.  Miller fought the case for an engineer
 who had rented a Pasadena apartment only
 to be evicted when the landlord discovered
 his new tenant to be a Negro.
 In virtually all his civil rights cases- Miller
 has acted as counsel for the NAACP, of which
 he is national vice president, as well as re-
 gional counsel.
 In the latter role, he has played a major
 part in striking down school desegregation -
 barriers, including the case which led to the
 historic U.S. Supreme Court decision of 1954
 which discarded the old "separate but equal"
 theory.
 Born in Pender,  Nebr.,  on  January  20,
 1903, the second of seven children, Miller was
 graduated from high school in Highland,
 Kans.  He attended the University of Kan-
 sas at Lawrence, Howard University in Wash-
 ington, D.C., and finally received- his law de-
 gree in 1928 from Washburn University in
 Topeka.
 MOVED HERE IN 1929
 He moved to Los Angeles in 1929, where his
 mother was then.living, upon learning of the

 death of a sister.  For 4 years he was a re-,
 porter, first on the California News and then
 the California Eagle-weeklies circulated in
 the Negro community.
 In 1933. after his marriage, his wife per-
 suaded him to take the bar examination and
 return to law.  Mrs. Juanita Miller is a USC,
 graduate in social work, and is today still
 carrying on a career ci her own as a social
 worker In the State department of welfare's
 Los Angeles office.
 The Millers have two children, Loren, Jr.,
 27, also an attorney, of 1319 South Highland
 Avenue, and Edward, 18, a student at Valley
 Junior  College.  Lore 3,  Jr.  and  his  wife,
 Anne-Marye have two children. Michael, 5,
 and Robin, 4.
 OWNS NI WSPAPER
 Miller I. one of the few newspapermen to
 achieve the goal of owning a newspaper, for
 which he once worked.  In 1951, he bought
 the California Eagle, in which he has regu-
 larly written a militant, goading column
 with a "freedom now t ' message.
 A Democrat since he voted for Al Smith In
 1928.  Miller has espoused often unpopular,
 causes (he defended Black Muslims after A
 violent clash with Los Angeles police) In law
 and in politics.
 ONE OF REGRETS
 But one of his regrets as he leaves Is*,
 practice for the bench is having to withdraw
 from participation in a case which he feels
 ultimately will result in Invalidation of an
 Initiative measure on .he November ballot.
 It would amend the State constitution,
 nullifying  all  antidscrimination  legisla-
 tion In housing and blocking future legisla-
 tion.
 Miller is convinced the initiative is uncbn=
 stitutional-but he and his allies lost pre-
 liminary skirmishes to keep It off the ballot.'

 EXTENSION OF REMAR
 HON. ALVIN E. O'KONSKI
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, September 24, 1964
 Mr. OMONSKI.  Mr. Speaker, fre-
 quently issues that are not widely dis-
 cussed by the American people because
 they do not know enough about them
 are the very issues tat are the most im-
 portant.
 Such an issue is one that a crusading
 Texas Congressman by the name of
 WRIGHT PATMAN ha: been calling to the
 attention of the Cotguess and the people
 for the past several :years. It is the issue
 of tax-free foundations.  Congressman
 PATMAN, although not of my political
 party, has been doing a job for the bene-
 fit of the country.  There is no politics
 in his operation. I endorse his effort
 sincerely and heartily.
 If there are massive abuses of tax-fret,
 foundations and tax evasion on the part
 of those best able to pay taxes, business
 manipulations done under the cover of
 educational or che,ritable foundations;
 then. it is time for the Congress-Re-
 publicans as well as Democrats-to sup-
 port Representative PATMAN in legislat=
 ing corrective measures.
 An article appearing in Saga maga-
 zine, October issue, discusses PATMAN'&
 effort at length, it was written by Fret.
 J. Cool:, a first-rate writer who has writ-
 ten hooks about unsung Revolutionary
 heroes crime in New York, Pentagon ex-,
 travag ances, and many other interestini
 matters. He has never written about i.
 more intriguing subject and he has donte
 it well  Cheers to Saga magazine, Free.
 Cook, and above all, to my good friend.
 and hard-working colleague,  WRIGH''
 PATMAlf, of Texas.
 The article follows:
 UNDER AN UMBRELLA of Pious OHAarre Luaxu
 THE BIr.GEST, JUICIEST TAx  DODGE OF Ai.a,
 TIME
 In his long career In the House, he ha:a
 been one of that body's gutsiest fighters fo.'
 the common man-and against the powe
 comple tee of our time: the millionaire in
 dustrialists,  the  huge  corporations,  that
 powerful banking trusts.  The bigger the?
 are, the harder WRIGHT PATMAN fights them.
 Right; now, PATMAN is waging the batty,
 of his life on behalf of the little man, which
 means nine-tenths of all Americans.  He i3
 out to apply the coup de grace to what h.s
 calls "giants with tax umbrellas," and hit
 opponents are only people like the Rockefel-
 lers and the Du Ponta, who consider  as
 million dollars mere pin money.  The par.
 titular "giants with tax umbrellas" whom
 PATMAN Is fighting are the huge, tax-exempt
 foundations set up by such great industrial
 dynasties.
 Thes.3 foundations represent a tax escap3
 hatch .hat, to PATMAN, Is the most vicious
 and ur.just In the whole income tax strut-
 ture.  'through this escape hatch. he says.
 the extremely wealthy avoid paying anythln:f
 like th?'ir proper share of the tax burden--
 and the rest of us have to make It up.  Just
 how far down in our jeans do we have to d1.1
 to keel the elite in the tax-exempt status t.3
 which they have become accustomed? The
 figures. as PATMAN cites them, are fantastic.
 He 1-as uncovered deals in which, by us,
 of the foundation device, Individuals hav3
 escaped paying taxes on literally millions of
 dollars in profits.
 The total annual loss from such Brob-
 dingnagian tax dodgers runs Into the bi-
 Iions. And this means that the average ma:i
 gets snaked-and soaked hard-to make u 3
 the deficit.  "Thie year's tax cut would b3
 peanuts compared to what would be possible
 if fourdation frauds were eliminated," PAT-
 MAN d.clares.
 PATMAN  would like to see the Treasur f
 Department figure out exactly how mucil
 better off Joe Doakes would be if he were
 not helping to pay the taxes of the Rocke-
 fellers, etc., but Treasury has exhibited n~
 wild enthusiasm for dredging up the fact,:.
 In the absence of such explicit knowledge,
 the beat that can be offered is an educates
 guess.  That guess goes this way: Assume
 that foundations were required to pay taxes
 on their gross Income like other businesae;.,
 then If the much-ballyhooed 1904 tax cut
 saved you $100, closing the foundation tax
 loophole could probably save you double
 that amount-another $200. So you are IoE-
 ing, out of pocket, $200 a year.
 The gimmicks PATMAN has exposed sho-v
 the extent of the abuses. Foundations com-
 pete w'th banks, making multi-million-dolls r
 loans with their tax-free money and ofte2
 giving highly preferential rates of interest to
 the donor-or his friends, or his businesse t.
 They run restaurants, invest In real estate,
 build and lease gas stations-enterprises in
 which, naturally, they hold an enormot s
 competitive edge over businessmen who have
 to pal' taxes.  In one startling case, PA7-
 MAN's researchers found a broker, a member
 of the New York and American Stock E>-
 changes,  using three  family  foundatior s
 (assett;: $28 million) torun an unregulated,
 tax-free security enterprise for himself and
 his fellow magnates.
 "There's one wea'_thy, residential area out-
 side of Philadelphia where virtually every
 other house has a foundation set up to send
 its kids to college at the taxpayers' expense,"
 PATMAN declares.
 He explained the deal as follows:
 Randolph Enterprise Jones is a wealthy
 industrialist with an income that places him
 comfortably in the upper brackets.  He has
 a couple of sons who will soon be going to
 college.  So what does Enterprise do?  He
 creates the Randolph Enterprise Jones Foun-
 dation to provide scholarships for worthy
 college students.  In anticipation of future
 need, he takes a nice, round Sum, say $25,000,
 and donates it to the foundation.  For this
 generosity Uncle Sam rewards him in two
 ways.  Since this presumably qualifies as
 charity, he pays no income tax on the $25,-
 000, and in addition, If this burst of benevol-
 ence has dropped him into a lower income
 tax bracket, he saves a further tidy hunk
 of pocket money on the taxes he pays on
 his remaining income.  Enterprise, as can be
 seen, is making hay with this deal, and if
 he can just arrange: to recapture the $25,000,
 he'll be home scot free. This last step is not
 too difficult.  Enterprise scouts around and
 finds an obliging college that is positively
 overawed by the scholastic attainments of
 Randolph Enterprise Jones, Jr. Then Junior
 gets the scholarship from his father's foun-
 dation-and all his college expenses are paid
 with tax-free money.  The same deal is later
 worked with son number two, the foundation
 being kept alive by carefully gaged bequests
 until there are no more deserving Enterprise
 Joneses to be rewarded.
 "All of this Is a kind of city slicker deal,"
 says  PATMAN,  who comes from the north
 Texas  farmlands.  "There  are  more  city
 slickers in the United States today than ever
 before, and their deals mount up to a lot
 more in money.  It used to be that the city
 slicker was working to euchre you out of $5
 to $100; today, It's millions.
 "To the very rich, our tax system is just
 like passing around the hat.  If they want
 to put in, they can.  If they don't, they don't
 have to.
 "Suppose everybody took advantage of
 this.  Suppose every American had his own
 foundation?  You know what would hap-
 pen?                                                                                                                 We wouldn't collect enough money to
 pay the Capitol's police force.  We couldn't
 keep Congress in session.  The whole thing
 would collapse."
 Most of us have probably been brain-
 washed into considering foundations as es-
 sentially noble enterprises.                                                                                                                      Some of them
 are, of course.  At their best, foundations
 finance important medical research, help care
 for orphans and the aged, support the arts
 and education.   But there Is a huge-and
 constantly growing-number of foundations
 whose principal function is to pile up huge
 fortunes, giving only a pittance to charity as
 a tax-escape cloak.  Such foundations, ex-
 empt from all taxation, act In reality as
 holding companies, dominating huge indus-
 trial  empires,  making  the  wealthy  ever
 wealthier and more powerful at the expense
 of the average man.
 After a dogged, 3-year probe of what he
 calls "the foundation mess," PATMAN cites
 some specific examples:
 The Rockefeller foundationsAt the close
 of 1960. seven Rockefeller family foundations
 held 7,891,567 shares of the common. stock
 of Standard 011 of New Jersey.  (In mid-
 May 1964, Jersey Standard was selling at $88
 a share and paying $2.80 annually.  This
 would make such a holding worth $694,457,-
 896-and would result in $22,096,387 of tax-
 free Income.)  But Jersey Standard was not
 by any means the only major oil stock in the
 portfolios of the Rockefeller foundations.
 They also owned hundreds of thousands of
