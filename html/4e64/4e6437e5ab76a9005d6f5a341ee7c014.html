Key Findings 
Anticipating strategic-level surprises�the sudden outbreaks of wars, 
revolutions, genocides, or economic calamities that affect core US interests�remains 
the hardest task for Intelligence Community (IC) analysts. Such surprises can include 
sudden hostile actions targeted at the United States or its allies, as well as unexpected 
developments�such as the sudden fall of a government�that are not aimed at the 
United States but that directly or indirectly affect US interests, for good or ill. A review 
of the many strategic-level surprises that have befallen all the major powers since 
the onset of World War II indicates recurring patterns of surprise, including in the 
following areas: 
The three types of events that tend to surprise us. 
The barriers to early perception and warning of these various types 
of surprise. 
The approaches and tools that can assist early recognition and warning of 
looming surprises (see figure 1). 
Type I. Sudden Hostile Action. This type of surprise involves abrupt, 
deliberate action by a unified actor�an armed force, a state, a terrorist cell, or a radical 
group�intended to disorient, defeat, or destroy an unprepared opponent. Typically 
concentrated in space and time, subtypes of such actions include surprise attacks, 
coups, diplomatic surprises, strategic power plays, military-technological surprises, or 
the initiation or escalation of major human rights abuses. 
Type II. System Shock. This type of surprise involves the abrupt failure 
or transformation of a complex system or set of systems, such as a state, an empire, 
an economy, or an international organization or alliance. The action in system shock 
can occur in weeks, months, or years, but it still represents a dramatic acceleration 
in the rate of change from the previous status quo. Type II surprises are the result of 
human actions but not the result of a master plan executed by any one controlling actor. 
Subtypes of such shocks include the popular overthrow of a ruler, the failure of a state, 
the onset of a genuine revolution, a deep recession or hyperinflation, the breakdown of 
an alliance or international body, or the outbreak of widespread communal violence. 
Type III. Tectonic Transformation. This type of surprise often includes 
sweeping nonlinear changes to an entire domain or region, such as a continental 
economy or a regional military balance. Unlike the first two types of surprise, it does 
not involve sudden, obvious change but rather large-scale, cumulative evolutionary 
changes that transform with gathering momentum the entire domain over a period of 
years or decades�along with the strategic, political, and economic systems therein. 
Subtypes include industrial and technological revolutions, the rise of new powers; the 
birth of new ideological and social movements or the transformation of existing ones, or 
revolutions in military affairs. 
These transformations disrupt the status quo, force leaders and institutions 
to respond, punish maladaptive systems, and often lead to further discontinuities of 
all types.

ome barriers to early recognition of looming dangers are internal to 
intelligence agencies. These barriers include: 
IC organizational barriers to information sharing and learning; pressures for 
group consensus and "clean story lines," which tend to limit discussion of nonlinear 
or unlikely outcomes; analysts' mind-sets, biases, and cognitive limits, which weaken 
their ability to anticipate discontinuous changes; and a reluctance to warn for fear of 
crying wolf, of being wrong, of upsetting the group consensus, or of riling superiors. 
The following approaches, tools, and concepts may help analysts to surmount 
the barriers to early recognition and warning of looming discontinuities, even in cases 
where actionable intelligence reporting is wanting. 
These methods are intended to supplement�not replace�substantive 
expertise and sound tradecraft. Indeed, they will work most effectively when 
employed by teams of analytic experts. 
Sudden Hostile Action. Analysts can better anticipate sudden hostile action 
by familiarizing themselves with the strategic patterns that tend to be more conducive to 
surprise and by rigorously examining the incentives and motivations for would-be hostile 
actors, including by: 
dentifying historical patterns of sudden hostile action drawn from case 
studies of precedents that may be analogous to current strategic circumstances in 
some significant aspects. 
Evaluating how closely current situations align with the preconditions for 
surprise identified in scholarly literature on intelligence and strategic surprise. 
Getting into the heads of would-be hostile actors to assess their calculus 
for considering surprise in analytically sophisticated ways that avoid mirror imaging, 
rational actor assumptions, or caricatures. 
Conducting simulations, war games, and exercises to identify possible 
situational incentives and,pressures on adversaries to strike suddenly. 
Monitoring the rhetoric and vocabulary of foreign actors for signs that they 
are losing patience with the status quo, heralding their readiness for drastic remedies, 
or mobilizing followers to prepare them for sacrifice and violence. 
 ) Brainstorming the vulnerabilities of would-be victims of sudden hostile 
action, via such methods as intelligence prennortems and defensive casing�critically 
surveying one's own defenses to assess blue force weak points, critical targets, 
and readiness. 
System Shock. IC analysts can supplement intelligence reporting on the 
systems and networks that they are responsible for�states, alliances, insurgencies, or 
economies�with concepts and approaches that bolster anticipation of the possibilities 
for rapid, discontinuous change, including by: 
Assessing the strengths and vulnerabilities of an entire system to better 
anticipate system shifts and tipping points; applying some basic concepts from the 
study of complex adaptive systems�including feedback loops, emergence, herd 
behavior, nonlinearity, or butterfly effects�can help. 
Employing far-domain analogies from the realms of science, medicine, and 
engineering�phase transitions, critical mass, contagion, perfect storm, brittleness, 
or "normal accidents"�to help conceptualize sudden, dramatic departures from a 
seemingly stable equilibrium in the domains of national security and economic affairs. 
Widening the range of imaginable outcomes via well-crafted scenarios, 
alternative futures, or simulations can help analysts avoid single-point predictions�
the bane of sound strategic foresight.

Tectonic Transformation. Tectonic transformation involves such long-term, 
large-scale changes that traditional intelligence sources are of even less use than they 
are in anticipating system shocks. Instead, the following techniques can help analysts 
dispel the "poverty of imagination": 
Adopting multiframe perspectives via outside opinions, nonmainstream 
thinking, or new sources of data and information can provide insights besides those 
circulating in the usual intelligence channels, challenge the conventional wisdom, and 
test mainstream hypotheses. 
Brainstorming the core drivers or signature technologies of national, 
regional, or global systems and their variegated effects on other domains with a 
diverse group of experts across disciplines can help analysts expand the range of 
imaginable scenarios and boost their anticipation of transformational changes on a 
large-scale. 
Aids To Anticipating All Types of Discontinuities. For all types of looming 
surprise, FC analysts should scrutinize anomalous events, outlier data, and incongruous 
information. The initial clues of impending discontinuities�analogous to the preshocks 
of an earthquake�are often isolated, irregular, and ragged, but they deserve extra 
attention. Hunches prompted by anomalous data can be valuable prods for reexamining 
baseline assessments. 
If done on a regular basis, stability audits�analytic surveys designed 
to spur respondents' thinking about evolving system dynamics, possible surprises, 
existing assumptions, and key information gaps�can expose the weaknesses of 
once-stable systems and the breakdown of old analytic paradigms over time. 
Intelligence premortems�which postulate that an existing analytic line 
is wrong�can also help the IC prevent premature closure, go beyond straight 
line extrapolations, and brainstorm hypotheses that could better explain new or 
discrepant data. 
Integrating analysis of possible discontinuities into mainline analysis can 
help IC products to address a wider range of possible outcomes.

Scope Note 
The purpose of this training aid is to help IC analysts better anticipate 
major discontinuities, including surprise attacks, political upheavals, major economic 
dislocations, and mass human rights abuses. It assumes that clear, timely and 
actionable intelligence reporting before future discontinuities will�as in historical 
cases�remain the exception, rather than the rule, and that IC analytic teams will 
therefore need to supplement empirically based intelligence analysis with a variety of 
techniques to boost analytic anticipation of looming dangers. 
This training aid seeks to help analysts understand: 
The nature and properties of real-world discontinuities. 
The many cognitive and organizational barriers to strategic foresight and 
warning of looming discontinuities. 
Methods to enhance early recognition of looming discontinuities. 
 The concepts offered in this training aid were drawn from a sabbatical on 
intelligence surprise undertaken in 2010 by a senior analyst in the Regional Dynamics 
Program, the tradecraft cell of the Office of Russia and Eurasian Analysis in CIA's 
Directorate of Intelligence. The analyst conducted an in-depth study of more than two 
dozen cases of intelligence surprise affecting all the great powers since the onset 
of World War II across all domains�strategic, diplomatic, political, economic and 
technological. The author also reviewed many of the keystone academic studies of 
intelligence surprise published since the appearance in 1962 of Roberta Wohlstetter's 
classic work, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision, which ushered in the modern field of 
intelligence studies. 
This training aid focuses on practical applications and tools that analysts, 
working alone or in small teams, can employ to better anticipate discontinuities, 
particularly in cases where accurate, timely reporting on warning indicators is scarce. 
It does not address quantitative models that Can help predict the likelihood of outlier 
outcomes. It is unclassified to broaden its availability.

Anticipating Strategic-Level 
Surprise: Analytic Frameworks 
for Practical Use 
Anticipating major discontinuities�sudden 
outbreaks of wars, surprise attacks, revolutions, 
genocides, diplomatic reversals, or economic 
calamities�remains the hardest job for Intelligence 
Community (IC) analysts. Historically, the inability of 
collectors and analysts to persuasively warn of looming 
dangers has been the precondition for most cases of 
intelligence surprise. 
The purpose of this training aid is to help 
IC analysts in the trenches to anticipate discontinuities 
and thereby reduce the risks of future surprises and 
intelligence failures. 
The paper begins with a discussion of the 
numerous barriers to analytic perception and warning 
of major discontinuities. 
It then offers a typology of intelligence 
surprise, discusses three key classes of surprise 
in depth, and suggests ways for IC analysts and 
managers to anticipate surprise. 
Introduction: Anticipating 
Discontinuities�Why It Is Hard 
Major discontinuities in any one domain 
or geographic region are rare events. Even dynamic 
open systems�the global balance of power, a regional 
economy, or a political order�will usually exhibit 
considerable continuity, inertia, and only incremental 
changes over the short and medium terms. As a result, 
most analytic accounts on a day-to-day basis will 
exhibit a fair amount of orderliness, predictability, and 
only modest, incremental change. Analysts seeking a 
baseline understanding of their account will often treat 
these "typical" periods as ones of "normalcy." 
These periods of normalcy, which may have 
begun long before an analyst started following an 
account, will often habituate analysts to see what they 
expettla-�ee�continued normalcy, defined as gradual 
incremental changes in their areas of responsibility. 
This tendency to expect the status quo in the near and 
medium terms is compounded by cognitive habits. 
Experiments from cognitive psychologists suggest that 
most people have a deep-seated need to perceive the 
world as orderly, comprehensible, and predictable. 
� Moreover, evidence of impending 
discontinuities is usually sparse and in some, cases 
never appears at all. Even if such evidence is received, 
it usually appears noteworthy only in hindsight. 
Before the event, such clues�if they are observed 
at all�tend to be obscure, irregularly timed, and 
inconsistent with or even contradictory to most of the 
other incoming data. Such clues often come as "weak 
signals" and are hard to discern from the other "noise" 
that overwhelms most analytic systems. 
�   As a result of these tendencies, analysts 
may not be in the appropriate analytic posture for 
recognizing or reacting when their account or issue 
is at increasing risk of a "phase transition"�a rapid 
shift from peace to war, stability to instability, order to 
disorder, popular apathy to public engagement�that 
is, from predictability to unpredictability. 
A Typology of Surprise�An Aid to 
Early Recognition 
 The typology of intelligence surprise discussed 
in this paper is designed to help intelligence analysts 
identify looming discontinuities early on. Based on

 Discontinuity, Surprise, 
and Warning Definitions 
The discussion in this paper refers to a series of related terms. 
A discontinuity is a rapid increase in the rate, scale, or scope of change�or a sudden shift 
in its direction�in any country or region or in any field relevant to US national interests. It can include 
events targeted at US interests as well as events not aimed at the United States but that significantly affect 
it, such as the sudden onset of instability in the Arab world in 2011 or the collapse of the Soviet bloc 
beginning in 1989. Examples of discontinuities include the following: 
� A surprise attack on the US Homeland or on US forces or targets at home or abroad. 
� The sudden departure from power of a key national leader or collapse of a government for 
any reason. 
�r�rhe outbreak or sudden escalation of widespread human rights abuses or a genocide campaign. 
Surprise is the jolt that an analyst, an intelligence service, or an unprepared government 
experiences in the face of unexpected, often dangerous, new developments that confound one's 
assumptions, expectations, and strategy. Examples of the jarring disorientation that can ensue as a result 
of a discontinuity include the following: 
 The surprise attacks on France, the Soviet Union, and the United States early in World War II and 
al-Qacida's attacks on US targets, starting in 1998. 
The fall of the Shah of Iran in 1978-79 and the swift ousters in 2011 of President Ben Ali from 
Tunisia and President Hosni Mubarak from Egypt. 
The onset of the global financial crisis�with all its attendant effects on politics, society, and 
strategic events worldwide�starting in 2008. 
Surprise can be positive if the discontinuity is beneficial to US interests, as was the collapse 
of communist rule in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. However, even if the event is favorable 
to US interests, lack of advanced notification from the IC is still a bad outcome because it leaves US 
policymakers less prepared to take advantage of opportunities than they would have been if they had 
been expecting it. 
Warning�a core IC mission�is the clear, convincing, accurate, and timely notification 
of policymakers of a threatening or potentially dangerous development. Persuasive strategic warning 
convinces policymakers of the existence and gravity of the looming event. Timely warning gives 
policymakers the opportunity to deliberate on the issue, decide on a course of action, and implement it 
in time to avert the danger or�should it occur anyway�to mitigate the damage to US interests. 
An intelligence failure is the label often given to episodes in which the IC did not provide 
policymakers with adequaie warning of events�often discontinuities�that gravely damaged US 
interests. Examples include the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941; the USSR's detonation of an atomic bomb 
in 1949, five years before CIA weapons analysts estimated that it was possible; North Korea's invasion of 
South Korea and communist China's intervention in the Korean war in 1950; the outbreaks of the Arab-
Israeli wars; the fall of friendly governments in Iraq (1958) and Iran (1978-79); the Warsaw Pact invasion 
of Czechoslovakia in 1968; the Rwandan genocide in 1994; and the attacks of 11 September 2001. 
In some of these cases, policymakers had, in fact, not received warnings from the IC; in 
others, policymakers judged that they had not been adequately warned�as then Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger publicly claimed after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war�because the warnings that they 
received were poorly sourced, ambiguous, or not emphasized repeatedly.

writings, it breaks intelligence surprise into three types, 
based on the essence and origins of that type of 
surprise: sudden hostile action, system shock, and the 
effects of tectonic transformation. 
The goal is to improve analysts' foresight 
of discontinuities by bolstering understanding of the 
types, patterns, and diversity of discontinuous change, 
based on previous historical examples.

This typology does not imply that there is 
always a clear division between the various categories 
of surprise or that they only occur in isolation. In major 
upheavals, multiple types of surprise are typically in play, 
making the task of analysis even harder. 
Foresight Based on Early Pattern 
Recognition 
Educating analysts about past patterns 
of surprise can help them anticipate future 
discontinuities. The Recognition-Primed Model 
(RPM) of rapid decisionmaking�first described 
in the 1980s by behavioral scientist Gary Klein�
suggests that humans by default react to new 
situations by trying to put them in a more familiar 
context. They do this by recognizing�based on 
prior experiences and expertise�the similarities 
between the current situation and past ones 
with which they are familiar. Critical to this effort 
is acquiring rapid situational awareness, which 
can only be based on an expert's sensitivity to 
relevant cues and expectations about how the 
situation might evolve, derived from extensive 
prior experiences with roughly similar but rarely 
identical problem types. The RPM model suggests 
that familiarizing analysts with past categories and 
patterns of surprise can increase the speed with 
which they recognize emerging crises that could 
lead to future discontinuities, thereby increasing 
the odds of early assessment and warning.

The Overlapping Nature Of Surprise: 
The Case Of Cuba 
The events leading up to the Cuban 
Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962 demonstrate the 
multiple, overlapping dimensions of surprise 
that frequently precipitate major crises and 
geopolitical upheavals. 
The long-term changes that created 
the preconditions for the crisis are all examples 
of Type III surprises, Tectonic Transformations. 
They include the rise of the Marxist-Leninist 
ideology that inspired Nikita Khrushchev 
and Fidel Castro; the growth of Soviet power 
in the middle of the 20th century; the onset 
of the Cold War; the revolutions in physics, 
engineering, and weaponry that led to the 
development of ballistic missiles armed with 
nuclear warheads; and the spread of radical, 
anti-US nationalism in Cuba and Latin America 
in the 1950s and early 1960s. 
The rapid crumbling of Fulgencio 
Batista's dictatorship to a radical insurgent 
movement under Castro's control in late 
1958 was a Type II surprise, System Shock, 
that reverberated throughout Latin America 
for decades. 
The Soviet effort to covertly emplace 
nuclear weapons in Cuba, which escalated 
into the most dangerous crisis of the Cold 
War, was a Type I surprise, Sudden Hostile 
Action�a strategic power play that Soviet 
leader Khrushchev intended as a fait accompli 
to spring on the United States and the world as 
soon as the missiles were operational. 
Agency 
T Hughes of the Defense Intelligence 
gency briefs Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara and reporters in February 1963 on 
US intelligence on the Soviet deployment of nuclear 
weapons to Cuba and their subsequent withdrawal 
in the fall of 1962.

Type I Surprise: 
Sudden Hostile Action 
(b)(3) 
Sudden hostile action involves abrupt, 
deliberate action by an actor aimed at disorienting, 
defeating, or destroying an unprepared opponent. The 
actor can be a state, an armed force, a terrorist cell, or a 
revolutionary party (see figure 2). 
� The action in Type I surprise takes place by 
human design and agency, often in a concentrated 
geographic place (a capital city or a military base, for 
example) in a concentrated time span that can usually 
be measured in days, hours, or even minutes. 
Subtypes and Examples of Sudden 
Hostile Action 
Surprise Attack. Surprise attack includes 
any initiation or escalation of military violence using 
conventional or unconventional weapons against an 
unprepared target-adversary.a It includes surprise 
attacks by states and nonstate actors, such as 
terrorist organizations. 
Strategic surprise attacks may initiate war, as was 
e case in Japan's raid on Pearl Harbor and Nazi 
Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. 
� Alternatively, surprise attacks can also occur in 
ongoing wars in which the element of surprise involves 
the attack's location, timing, or novel methods and 
capabilities (see figure 3). 
ri Examples of surprise attack include the following: 
a 
The North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950. 
 The Soviet invasions of Hungary (1956), 
Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1979). 
Iraq's invasions of Iran (1980) and Kuwait (1990). 
he start of all the major conventional wars of the 
Middle East (1956, 1967, and 1973). 
This training aid focuses mostly on strategic-level 
surprise attacks that initiate, escalate, or widen wars and conflicts. 
It does not focus on the use of surprise at the operational or tactical 
levels of conflict. 
Argentina's seizure of the British Falkland Islands 
in 1982. 
� he al-Qa'ida attacks of 11 September 2001. 
Military-Technological Surprise. This type of 
surprise involves the rapid development and deployment (b)(3) 
of new weapons systems or the novel adaption and 
employment of existing ones that an enemy or potential 
foe lacks the ability to counter. 
 Examples of military-technological surprise include 
the following: 
 Nazi Germany's wartime development and use of 
early-generation cruise and ballistic missiles (the V-1 
and V-2, respectively). 
 The Soviet Union's development and test of an 
atomic bomb in 1949�at least five years earlier than 
US intelligence analysts had estimated. 
�F�The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, 
which stunned the US Congress and public. 
 India's surprise nuclear tests in 1974 and, again, . 
in 1998. 
Abrupt Strategic Power Play. This subtype of 
sudden hostile action includes any move by an adversary 
to seize strategic advantages on the ground short of 
overt war. 
 Examples of strategic power plays include 
the following: 
 Nazi Germany's remilitarization of the Rhineland in 
1936 and its annexation of Austria in 1938. 
� Jrhe Soviet blockade of Berlin from all land 
communications in 1948-49. 
� 
East Germany's construction of the Berlin Wall 
in 1961. 
oviet emplacement of strategic weapons in 
Cuba in 1962.

Varieties of 
Military-Technological Surprise 
Numerous situations can give rise 
to the kind of surprise involving an adversary's 
capacity to inflict military damage that the victim 
has failed to anticipate, including the following: 
.F�NIew weapons technologies, such as 
US development and use of the atomic bomb 
and Germany's development of cruise and 
ballistic missiles in World War II, and Britain's 
introduction of tanks to the Western front in 
1917 in World War I. 
�
 Significant improvements to or 
adaptations of existing technologies, such as 
the Japanese development of shallow-running 
aerial torpedoes to attack Pearl Harbor in 
1941; the USSR's mass production of the T-34 
medium tank, with its sloped armor, reliable 
engine, and turreted gun early in World War 
II; and the Iraqi insurgents' effective use of and 
adaptations to improvised explosive devices. 
IIJThe effective integration of two or " 
more existing weapons or systems, such as 
the Germany's use of radios, tanks, close air 
support aircraft, and airborne troops in the 
blitzkrieg invasions of the 1939-41 era or the 
rapid development by the US Navy and Marines 
of amphibious landing ships and craft, naval 
gunfire support, and close air support before 
and during World War II. 
Tactical or doctrinal innovations that 
make one or more existing military systems 
more effective, such as the US development of 
amphibious warfare doctrine in the 1930s or 
the use of B-29s�originally designed as a 
high-level daylight "precision" bomber�in 
low-level incendiary bombing missions against 
Japanese urban areas. 
In most cases, military-technological 
surprise usually involves one or more new or 
adapted technologies coupled with tactical or 
doctrinal innovations and improved command 
and control to maximize their effectiveness. 
JA radar operator of the UK Women's Auxiliary 
Air Force watches her cathode ray tube monitor for 
signals of incoming enemy aircraft during World 
War II. The Royal Air Force's (RAF) development of 
an integrated air defense network, centered around 
early warning radar facilities, allowed the RAF to 
detect inbound German bomber formations early in 
their missions and to vector RAF Fighter Command 
planes to intercept them in a timely and efficient 
manner. Britain's superior early warning system 
and air battle management capability surprised 
German commanders and played vital roles in the 
United Kingdom's victory in the Battle of Britain 
in 1940-41.

Effective use of military surprise maximizes the likelihood of operational success and 
reduces the costs of an operation�in time, resources, and blood�to the attacker. Surprise attacks 
that succeed typically exploit multiple dimensions of surprise: To achieve surprise, would-be 
attackers often conduct extensive denial and deception operations to keep their intentions, plans, 
and capabilities secret from the target-actor and the international community.

nhe Strategic Effects of a Successful 
Surprise Attack 
Gen. Charles de Gaulle in his postwar 
memoirs described how French leaders crumbled 
under the weight of the German panzer thrust 
across France in the campaign from May to June 
1940 that precipitated his country's surrender. His 
account stresses the role of shock�intellectual, 
psychological, emotional, and moral�in a 
successful surprise attack. The devastating shock 
that de Gaulle describes, which leads to the 
cascading failure of the target's entire defensive 
system, remains the holy grail of planners of 
surprise attacks. 
The crumbling of [France's] whole 
system of doctrines and organizations, to 
which our leaders had attached themselves, 
deprived them of their motive force. A sort of 
moral inhibition made them suddenly doubtful of 
everything, and especially of themselves. From 
then on, the forces of disintegration were to show 
themselves rapidly.), 
Gen. Charles de Gaulle, in his postwar 
memoirs, The Call to Honor 
 Coup d'Etats. This subtype of surprise, sometimes 
referred to as a putsch, is the sudden, illegal ouster of 
an incumbent state leadership by elements of the armed 
forces or security services�often by force or the threat 
of force�in order to replace it with another group, either 
civil or military.b Coups were especially prevalent in 
Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Turkey during 
and after the Cold War era. 
 Examples of coups include the following: 
Jr he overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq 
by a nationalist army general and his followers in the 
14 July Revolution" in 1958. 
� he toppling of the Greek Government by a group 
of rig htwing army colonels in 1967. 
Massive Police Crackdown or Martial Law.c 
Authoritarian states pressed by demands for democracy 
or threatened by lawlessness or insurgencies will 
sometimes resort to a show of overwhelming force or 
to a massive crackdown on opposition to maintain their 
grip on power. Typically such events are preceded by 
secret planning for "emergency rule," the preparation 
of propaganda justifying the repression, and the quiet 
 US battleships at Pearl Harbor under attack by Japan on 
7 December 1941. The telltale wakes of Japan's new shallow-
running aerial torpedoes can be seen. US planes caught on 
the ground at Hickam air base burn in the distance. 
..-zenamarn.. 
dispersion of police and security forces to key sectors 
in the capital and other cities. Government security 
forces will then move rapidly to seal the borders, arrest 
dissidents and opposition journalists, and occupy 
opposition strongholds, such as universities or public 
squares. Coups are often followed quickly by crackdowns 
or the imposition of emergency rule or martial law. 
Examples include the following: 
� LlJrhe bloody quashing of the Tiananmen Square 
prodemocracy movement by the Chinese army and 
police in 1989. 
� he Polish army's imposition of martial law in 
December 1981 in response to the rise of the Solidarity 
labor opposition movement and to intense Soviet 
pressure to quell unrest. 
Diplomatic Surprise. This includes any 
unexpected diplomatic move that has a major impact on 
the regional or global balance of power. 
b Political scientist Samuel P. Huntington in his 1968 book, 
Political Order in Changing Societies, identified three classes of 
coup d'etat: 
1. A breakthrough coup, in which revolutionary elements of 
the armed forces�often led by junior officers�overthrow the 
traditional government and creates a new ruling elite, such as 
occurred in Egypt in 1952. 
2. A guardian coup, in which the avowed goal of the coup 
plotters�typically more senior army commanders�is to "save" 
the state from disorder, party strife, violent opposition, or 
foreign foes. 
3. A veto coup, in which the army blocks democratic 
participation in the affairs of state. Usually led by senior 
commanders, this last type of coup often result in violent 
confrontations and suppression of civil opposition, such as 
occurred in Chile in 1973 and in Argentina multiple times during 
the 20th century. 
a The temporary use of martial law can be a legitimate tool of 
civil government in bona fide cases of civil or natural disasters, 
when civil authorities alone are unable to maintain order, or provide 
basic services.

nExamples of diplomatic surprise include the following: 
�Lllilhe Nazi-Soviet "nonaggression" pact in 
August 1939, which led to Germany's surprise attack 
on Poland one week later and the USSR's forcible 
annexation of eastern Poland by late September of that 
year and the Baltic states in 1940. 
� F-1-he US rapprochement with Chairman Mao 
Zedong's China in the early 19705 after three years 
of secret diplomacy, which blindsided the Taiwan 
Government and rattled Soviet leaders. 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's "electric shock 
diplomacy," including his sudden expulsion of Soviet 
military advisers in 1972 and his peace offer to Israel 
in 1977. 
Political Assassination. This type of sudden 
hostile action involves the premeditated killing of any 
influential political actor in or out of power by a person 
or group motivated by a political grievance. It excludes 
assassins motivated by psychotic impulses. Assassins 
can be "lone wolves" or members of a conspiracy. 
 Examples of political assassination include the 
slayings of the following: 
Egypt's President Sadat in 1981. 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. 
Pakistani presidential candidate Benazir Bhutto 
in 2007. 
Violent Escalations by Revolutionary or Terrorist 
Movements. Such movements tend to start as small, 
cell-like clandestine organizations and gradually build 
their strength through clandestine measures. However, 
once they reach a critical mass of personnel, resources, 
weapons, and training, such groups will typically 
initiate political, guerilla, and/or terrorist campaigns to 
destabilize the state. 
� xamples include the Bolshevik party in czarist 
Russia, the Viet Minh and Viet Cong in Vietnam, the 
FARC in Colombia, and al-Qa`ida in the Middle East 
and North Africa. 
 Even after these groups launch their initial wave 
of attacks and declare war on the state, they will 
continue to exploit the tactical advantages of surprise 
in follow-on hostile actions, such as raids, robberies, 
kidnappings, assassinations, and bombings. 
Initiation or Escalation of Major Human Rights

 Decisive unilateral acts that create new facts 
on the ground and catch foreign actors�including 
intelligence services�unprepared are a favorite 
tool of action-oriented actors seeking to upend the 
status quo. Intelligence scholar Michael Handel 
notes, for example, that Adolf Hitler made repeated 
use of faits accomplis to catch opponents off 
guard and hinder opposition actors from mobilizing 
against him. Handel notes that Hitler established 
early on the pattern behind his frequent use 
of surprise. 
The preparatory stage of deception was 
intended to divert attention from his actual goal and 
reassure potential opponents that he did not intend 
to do what they feared he might. The fait accompli 
was then followed by a flood of new assurances 
that since Germany desired peace, this was the 
last such act of its kind; in this manner, he allayed 
fears and set the stage for his next move.))

Barriers to Early Perception of 
Type I Surprise 
(U//FOU0) There are several barriers to early perception 
and timely warning of Type I surprise. Secrecy on the 
part of the aggressor-actor planning to surprise an 
unprepared foe is foremost. 
Denial and Deception by Smart, Adaptive Actors. 
e goal of would-be attackers is to conceal hostile 
plans and preparations from onlookers and prevent the 
intended victim or the third parties from taking effective 
counteraction. The ability of US enemies�from Imperial 
Japan and Mao's China to North Korea and al-Qa`ida�
to conceal preattack plans and preparations has been 
amply demonstrated. 
F�Scholars of surprise observe that even rudimentary 
denial and deception efforts often work in thwarting 
timely warning and response by the target actor. These 
efforts can include the following: 
� 
Publicly denying aggressive intent. 
Lying about the purpose of prestrike activities. 
Announcing "routine" military training maneuvers to 
mask preattack staging. 
Publicly demobilizing token numbers of reservists. 
Feinting in another direction. 
Intimating that the prestrike activities are merely 
a bluff. 
Heralding bogus eleventh-hour peace initiatives or 
offering to enter into negotiations. 
Sound operational security and standard 
military cover, camouflage, and concealment of hostile 
forces can go a long way to countering even the 
most sophisticated intelligence collection systems, 
judging from unclassified assessments of surprise and 
intelligence failure. 
 Bold, Resourceful Enemies. The sheer 
audacity of a surprise attack can catch an adversary 
unprepared. Roberta Wohlstetter�the doyenne of 
intelligence surprise studies�discussed in her 1962 
book, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision, the inability 
of US officials to conceive of a radical Japanese 
response to its military quagmire in China and escalating 
tensions with the United States. Wohlstetter identified 
the US officials' "poverty of imagination" as the root 
cause of US vulnerability to a surprise attack at Pearl 
Harbor. Racist stereotypes also played a part: many 
US Navy commanders could not believe that the Imperial 
Japanese Navy could pull off such an ambitious and 
complex strike operation so far from Japan. 
6thCIA1eadthIip 
in an essay on profihn 
This pattern�disbelief that an actor would 
embark on a course of action that was potentially 
catastrophic�was repeated before the Cuban Missile 
Crisis in 1962: US officials knew that the Kremlin was 
increasingly anxious about the strategic balance and 
about US pressure on Cuba, but few in the ICd believed 
that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev would risk a 
nuclear war by secretly emplacing nuclear weapons 90 
miles off Florida. 
The 9/11 Commission Report makes 
clear that the key organizations involved in US air 
safety�the Federal Aviation Administration, the North 
American Aerospace Defense Command, and the 
airlines�were utterly unprepared for foreign terrorists 
to take over US civilian passenger jets and use them 
as weapons. 
hen Director of CIA John McCone was an exception. He 
r.easoned that the Soviets were building surface-to-air missile sites 
in western Cuba�which US intelligence had confirmed�in order 
to protect covertly deployed Soviet nuclear forces rather than to 
defend Cuba from US invasion, an assessment that turned out to 
be accurate. Proceeding from rational unitary actor assumptions, 
Sherman Kent�then the head of the CIA's Office of National 
Estimates�and much of the rest of the IC judged such a course of 
action too risky and out of character for the Soviet leadership.

 Oenial And Deception In 
Cases Of Mass Atrocities 
 Anticipating the initiation of mass 
human rights abuses and comprehending their 
scale and intensity as they occur are difficult 
analytic challenges. Past cases of mass atrocities 
demonstrate the ability of hostile actors to 
conceal their intentions and plans and deceive 
outside observers until it is too late to thwart or 
mitigate their violence against the victims. A 
policy planning handbook on responding to the 
dangers of mass atrocities recently published by 
the US Army notes, for example, that: 
 II Perpetrators decide to conduct mass 
atrocities, mobilize their resources, draw up 
"death lists" or otherwise identify intended 
targets, and possibly segregate victims into 
ghettos or camps. A pretext for such actions may 
be arranged, or an unforeseen event may spark 
these measures. Additional preparations may 
include transportation of victims, identifying 
locations for mass killing, and determining 
means of disposing of bodies. Perpetrators will 
also take measures to disguise their actions or 
deceive both victims and outsiders as to what will 
occur (e.g., victims may be relocated and collected 
together in order to "protect" them). The many 
individuals involved in the actual conduct of the 
mass atrocities may need to be convinced of the 
legitimacy of the actions as well as the need for 
secrecy ... Perpetrators will attempt to obfuscate 
mass atrocity situations, blame the incidents on 
the victims or deny their occurrence. They will 
impede external efforts to determine the truth of 
events. Strong denial may presage future waves of 
mass atrocities. . . Fr

Adm. Yamamoto's Bias for Action 
nalysts can evaluate the risk 
tolerance and bias for action of key actors. A 
leading US scholar of the attack on Pearl Harbor 
in 1941 provides a glimpse into the mentality of 
one particularly bold actor. Gordon W. Prang�
author of the 1991 book, At Dawn We Slept: 
The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor�wrote of 
Adm. Yamamoto Isoroku, Commander in Chief 
of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet 
at the time of the attack: 
nil Yamamoto's temperament also had much to 
do with the strategy he eventually conceived [for 
attacking Pearl Harbor]. Some of his maxims . . . 
reveal his turn of mind: 'An efficient hawk hides 
its claws'; 'A cornered rat will bite': 'If you want 
the tiger's cubs, you must go into the tiger's lair' 
. . . An inveterate gambler, he enjoyed nothing 
more than a competitive round of chess, poker, or 
bridge . . . 'In all games Yamamoto loved to take 
chances just as he did in naval strategy,' explained 
[one of his favorite staff officers] Capt. Yasuji 
Watanabe. 'He had a gambler's heart'',

The Soviet 
Union successfully tested 
an atomic bomb in August 
1949�five years before the 
IC judged it to be likely. 
Soviet leader Josef Stalin's 
implacable determination 
to acquire the bomb and 
the resourcefulness of Soviet 
research and development 
efforts�abetted by Soviet 
espionage penetration of 
the Manhattan Project 
during World War II�
enabled the USSR to greatly 
accelerate its program to 
build, test, and deploy 
atomic weapons. 
Mirror-Imaging a "Rational" Actor. In the history 
of surprise, zealous alpha actors with outsized appetites 
for power, tolerance for risk, and biases for action�Adolf 
Hitler, Gamal Nasser, Khrushchev, Sadat, Saddam 
Husayn, Kim II-Sung, and Kim Jong-II�have sought to 
seize the initiative against their presumed foes. Often, 
such actors tend to pit their own audacity against the 
normal human tendency to assume that "tomorrow will 
look like today," that "the other guy" thinks the way "we" 
do, and that dramatic departures from the status quo 
are impossible. Assumptions about the permanence of 
the status quo and the presumed "rationality"�often 
narrowly defined or confused with reasonableness�of 
hostile actors increase the victim's vulnerability to denial 
and deception efforts by crafty, adaptive enemies. 
The difficulty of comprehending the full psychological, 
cultural, political, and organizational context in which 
would-be hostile actors operate compounds the problem. 
� The head of Israeli military intelligence in 1973 
could not conceive that Sadat would initiate a war 
that Egypt could not win militarily. The intelligence 
chief assumed that the Egyptian armed forces would 
wage war the way that Israel would�by first seizing 
air superiority over the region�which the Egyptian air 
force clearly lacked the capability to achieve. ' 
�r�lks then chief of the CIA's Office of National 
Estimates, Sherman Kent wrote after the Cuban 
Missile Crisis to explain the IC's failure to anticipate 
Soviet deployment of nuclear weapons to Cuba, "no 
estimating process can be expected to divine when 
exactly the enemy is about to make a dramatically 
wrong decision. We [in the IC] were not brought up 
to underestimate our adversary [in this case, Soviet 
leader Khrushchev]." 
Aids To Anticipating Type I Surprise 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
Timely, accurate intelligence reporting on the (b)(3) 
hostile intentions, strike capabilities, and secret plans of 
would-be hostile actors remains the surest aid to analysts 
trying to avert Type I surprises. However, if the history 
of intelligence failures experienced by all major powers 
since the onset of World War II is any guide, conclusive 
intelligence reporting on an adversary's plans and 
decision to attack will remain the exception, rather than 
the rule. Therefore, while developing and maintaining 
close ties to intelligence collectors remain essential, 
analysts should assume that critical intelligence 
collection gaps will persist and that analysts will need 
other means to bolster their ability to anticipate possible 
hostile action. 
These supplemental approaches and tools attempt to: (b)(3) 
 Identify patterns of sudden hostile action 
based on historical case studies and help analysts 
to determine how similar current situations may be to 
historical analogues. 
Get into the heads of would-be hostile 
actors in realistic, sophisticated ways and anticipate 
their possible moves using methods that reduce the 
dangers of mirror-imaging. 
Assess the vulnerabilities of would-be 
victims of sudden hostile action in analysts' areas 
of responsibility. 
 Assess an Actor's Commitment and Hostility, 
Not Just "Rationality." This approach requires a deeper 
focus on actors' motives and intentions in analytically 
sophisticated ways. It seeks to fix analysts' attention on 
would-be hostile actors who may be motivated by pride, 
fury, revenge, aggrandizement, and ideology. Such 
actors are subject to opaque psychological, political, 
and organizational pressures to act. They often receive 
flawed, politicized intelligence. These actors will often 
seek to change the rules of the game or to destroy the 
old game completely and replace it with one of their 
making via sudden hostile action (see figure 4). 
 For examples, Adolf Hitler sought to overturn the 
post�World War I Versailles Treaty order in Europe 
as a prelude to his campaign of genocidal expansion; 
Josef Stalin to project Soviet power into and 
communize the states of Central Europe and to subvert 
liberal democracies in Western Europe; Fidel Castro 
to check US "neocolonialism" and promote radicalism 
in the Western Hemisphere; and Usama Bin Ladin to 
oust the United States from the Arab-Islamic world and 
depose "apostate" regimes in the region.

 A US expert on strategic warning during the Cold 
War era, Cynthia Grabo, noted that would-be hostile 
actors miscalculate for various reasons: misjudgments 
of an adversary's strength, ideological fixation, hubris, 
domestic pressures, nationalist hysteria, pique, or just 
plain desperation. Under the spell of such pressures, an 
actor may embark on an imprudent or even disastrous 
course of action. 
Scrutinizing assumptionse about the 
full range of factors that can influence an actor's 
behavior�including personal, professional, 
organizational, and social Pressures�and tracking 
them over time can help analysts account for zeal, 
folly, honor, revenge, and malice in forecasting leaders' 
actions and determine the trend in an actor's extremist 
rhetoric and actions. 
Using well-crafted red teams to consider 
alterative explanations for adversaries' behavior 
and to simulate would-be hostile actors' calculus for 
employing surprise can help analysts draw on deep 
expert insights in ways that avoid mirror-imaging, 
rational actor assumptions, or caricatures. 
APPLICATION 
�PatwArdmievaal 
Analysts�working individually or in analytic 
teams�can identify who the possible alpha actors are in 
their, areas of responsibility, study the political pressures 
acting on them, assess their timeline for action, track 
their rhetoric and behavior over time, and anticipate 
their possible recourse to various options for sudden 
hostile action. 
Recognize Historic Patterns of Surprise. Sudden 
hostile actions sometimes resemble historical precedents 
for surprise action or follow discernible patterns. Such 
actions are rarely what leading intelligence scholar 
Richard K. Betts in his 1982 book, Surprise Attack, calls 
"bolts from the blue." 
 The author noted that "... there are no significant 
cases of bolts from the blue [that is, a major surprise 
attack not preceded by an earlier political crisis] in 
the 20 century. All major sudden attacks occurred 
in situations of prolonged tension, during which the 
victim state's leaders recognized that war might be on 
the horizon." 
 Instead, sudden attacks tend to occur during or 
after an escalation in tensions that is often observable 
to intelligence organizations. 
Analysts should be aware of the relevant 
historical precedents for surprise action under various 
circumstances in their areas of responsibility. Studying 
such precedents can help analysts expand their 
intellectual inventory of relevant historical analogies and 
aid in early pattern detection and recognition. 
 A senior Japanese naval aviator who helped plan 
the attack on Pearl Harbor told US interrogators after 
the war that he was dumbfounded that the United 
States had not studied Japan's use of strategic surprise 
to initiate its 1904-05 war against Russia. 
Political and military analysts would benefit 
from being proactive in assessing the risks of surprise 
attacks as tensions escalate, even if reporting on force 
postures and deployments is scarce or recourse to a 
military "solution" seems unfeasible or reckless. 
Another critical development for analysts to 
watch for is mobilization in all its forms. Large-scale 
national mobilization of military power that imposes a 
high opportunity cost on the civilian economy remains 
the best'predictor that a state is preparing to undertake 
major military operations, according to a leading scholar 
of surprise. 
 Political analysts will usually have the lead 
responsibility for recognizing the rise of radical factions 
and leaders, analyzing escalating tensions, identifying 
the breaching of possible strategic "red lines," and 
warning of the rising urgency and extremism of the 
political or diplomatic dialogue. 
Military analysts, by contrast, will have the 
lead in closely monitoring shifts�real or perceived�in 
the interstate balance of power and balance of threats 
as well as indicators of preparations for sudden action 
by the military and/or security forces. 
In similar fashion, terrorism analysts can gain 
insight by closely tracking the substance and tone of 
extremist groups' public communications. Increasingly 
aggressive rhetoric that employs violent imagery, blunt 
threats, and apocalyptic visions to spur psychological 
mobilization, demonize enemies, and legitimize mass 
killings are often indicators of a looming escalation 
of violence. 
APPLICATION 
 ) Analytic teams can study the academic and 
intelligence literature on a potential adversary's past 
uses of strategic surprise and assess its current doctrine 
arious models and premises have been used to describe 
and justify models that attribute rationality to actors. The basic idea 
is that actors try to maximize benefits, minimize costs and risks, 
and weigh options for action via some form of cost-benefit-risk 
analysis�however crude, intuitive, or informal. In shorthand usage, 
rationality has often been confused with "common sense" 
or reasonableness.

Apply Theories of Surprise Action. Awareness of 
the academic theories of surprise, which are principally 
based on historical case studies, can also help IC 
analysts assess increasing risks of Type I surprise. 
These theories tend to focus on two key conditions as 
particularly salient risk factors for surprise attack! 
 The first is an actor's acute sense of strategic 
vulnerability, particularly if communicated by warnings 
of encirclement or fears of extinction. 
� Jhe second condition is an actor's heightened 
sense of its own offensive capacities via the 
possession of elite strike arm�such as Imperial 
Japan's carrier battle group, Nazi Germany's 
armored forces, Israel's air force, or al-Qa`ida's 
suicide bombers. 
''-k--ziaredavasas, 
nAPPLICATION 
Analysts can assess whether these 
preconditions for sudden hostile action�the presumed 
advantages of near-term offensive action or the 
perception of adverse long-term strategic trends�apply, 
as seen from the optic of an increasingly desperate or 
zealous actor or actors. If so, these conditions would 
suggest higher risks of sudden hostile action than would 
otherwise be the case. Military journals and doctrine, 
formal strategy pronouncements, warnings via diplomatic 
channels, and political rhetoric can all shed light on 
aspects of foreign thinking on these strategic matters. 
Conduct "Forensic" Analysis of Possible Hostile 
Actors. Analysts can examine which actors possess the 
motives, means, constraints, and opportunities to engage 
in various options for hostile action against foreign or 
domestic actors. 
Motive refers to the intentions, ideology, and 
animating beliefs of a potentially hostile actor, particularly 
as they define his threat perceptions and enemy images. 
It also covers incentives to act suddenly, such as the 
desire to seize a neighbor's resource-rich territory or 
"redress" specific grievances, such as the loss of territory 
to a neighboring state in a previous-war or concern 
about a rival's threats or military capabilities, as he 
perceives them. 
Means refers to the totality of capabilities for 
a major hostile action, including preventive war, surprise 
attack, a coup, or genocide. These means can be at 
hand or in development. Development of costly means of 
attack remains a key guide to an actor's possibly hostile 
intentions. The trend line�whether these capabilities 
for surprise action are increasing or decreasing�are as 
important as their level at any given point in time. 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
 Opportunity refers to the feasibility and (b)(3) 
practicality of sudden hostile action in obtaining the goals 
sought by the actor, such as the ouster of a hated or 
inept leader, the elimination of a despised minority group, 
or the neutralization of a rival state's deterrent forces. 
The focus is on the opportunities that the would-be 
actor perceives as he surveys the relevant operating 
environment. Opportunities cover environmental 
factors that may create a more permissive environment 
for sudden hostile action. Factors leading to a more 
permissive environment might include the following: 
LIIiA rival actor's focus on domestic upheavals, 
events in another theater of war, or an ongoing 
military campaign. For example, Fascist dictator 
Benito Mussolini of Italy and Imperial Japan both took 
advantage of Germany's crushing defeat of France in 
1940 to seize French territories; Husayn's Iraq sought 
to exploit Iran's postrevolution instability to seize 
contested territory in 1980. 
� he international community's preoccupation with 
grave economic conditions or with another crisis. 
Examples include the Suez Crisis in 1956, which 
distracted Western powers from the Soviet Union's 
preparations to suppress the Hungarian uprising 
against communist rule; and Iraq's seizure of Kuwait 
in August 1990, when Western states were trying 
f Offense-defense theory and offensive realism are hypotheses 
from international relations and strategic theory that seek to explain 
the outbreaks of war. Offense-defense theory posits that war 
becomes more likely when great powers judge that: 
1. Conquest is relatively more feasible than in other periods. 
2. Their own strategic offensive capacities are greater�or are 
deemed greater�than those of a rival power or powers. 
3. They are vulnerable�or fear that they are�to strategic 
attack from one or more foreign powers. It also holds that 
false evaluations of points 1, 2, and 3 are relatively common 
on the part of great powers because of ideological distortions, 
poor intelligence, faulty net assessments, and the influence of 
expansionist interest groups. 
Offensive realism posits that great powers will seek to maximize 
their absolute and relative power vis-a-vis other states and will seek 
to do so by expanding their military capacities and by seeking to 
expand and achieve dominance when the opportunity avails itself.

Academic Theories of Surprise Attack 
 One scholar of intelligence affairs, Professor 
James J. Wirtz, summarizes the theory of surprise 
in three propositions. 
� 
� 
� 
  Surprise temporarily suspends the 
reciprocally antagonistic nature of the 
battlefield by catching the enemy when he is 
unprepared to resist effectively. A military 
organization in a state of unreadiness is more 
akin to a large peacetime bureaucracy in 
custody of scarce commodities (weapons and 
ammunition) than it is to a combat force that is 
ready to fight. 
 Strategic surprise will be an especially 
enticing option to the militarily or economically 
weaker party in a strategic rivalry. The 
advantages of surprise offer the weaker side the 
prospect of achieving decisive results against 
a stronger opponent that would probably be 
unobtainable in a war of attrition. The party 
that is clearly stronger, by contrast, often hopes 
displays of might can deter a foe or intimidate 
him into making concessions without having to 
resort to war. 
 Strategies based on strategic surprise 
appear to all concerned parties as extremely 
risky before the attack and often turn out to be 
reckless and ill advised. The very "unthinkable" 
nature of an audacious plan of attack makes 
it more likely both to achieve success�
surprise�in the short run and to infuriate and 
unify the victim of surprise in the long run, if 
he can absorb the initial blow. 
Other scholars note that the risks of surprise 
attack are particularly high in two cases. 
When one side judges that long-term trends 
in t e strategic balance are unfavorable because 
of inferior geographic position (often perceived 
as "enemy encirclement"), economic decline, 
or slower population growth; in such cases, an 
actor�such as a Adolf Hitler or the leadership 
of prewar Japan�is strongly tempted to seize 
the initiative via decisive action to head off 
what he fears will otherwise be a protracted 
deterioration in his strategic position. 
LIIIWhen military planners judge that the 
attacking side holds a decisive advantage 
because offensive action would allow the 
attacker to seize the initiative, maximize the 
presumed superior elan on the part of the 
attacking force, and exploit the advantages that 
current weapons, doctrine, and tactics may hold 
for the attacker.

APPLICATION 
Examining these forensic factors enables 
analysts to do a quality of information check regarding 
the reporting available on each of these criteria (motives, 
means, and opportunities) and to develop signposts 
to help warn of new developments�such as a hostile 
actor's decision to heavily invest in strike weapons, 
evidence of a more permissive strategic environment, or 
increased incentives to act against a historical foe. 
To conduct this type of forensic analysis, 
terrorism analysts should stay particularly close to 
collectors�including domestic law enforcement�and do 
various types of link and network analysis to gain a fuller 
appreciation of the structures, plans, and operations of 
extremist organizations.

Vulnerability Assessments. Vulnerability 
assessments, sometimes called defensive casing, 
can improve analysts' understanding of hostile 
actors' priorities among various potential targets for 
surprise attack. 
 This technique focuses on the would-be 
target's vulnerabilities. It involves a structured effort 
by a diverse team of experts.to brainstorm various 
categories of potential targets�a state, military 
force, security force, specific leader, or critical 
infrastructure�and assessing the relative merits, 
drawbacks, and risks of each potential target from the 
perspective of a would-be attacker. 
APPLICATION 
Prospective targets of possible hostile action�
particularly in cases of strategic military surprise and 
terrorism�can be assessed, categorized, and ranked 
from multiple perspectives. One perspective is that of 
the potential victim: how might he "objectively" rank his 
own strategic centers of gravity, essential infrastructure, 
economic core, and renowned religious or historic sites 
in terms of importance, vulnerability, and symbolic value. 
This exercise could be repeated from the perspective of 
prospective attackers: how might they assess a would-be 
victim's possible targets in accord with these criteria. 
How might they rate a would-be victim's readiness and 
resilience in the event that surprise action is successful?

Red Teaming. This technique relies on a 
rigorous, systematic effort to zero in on the strategic and 
tactical calculus of would-be hostile actors. Ideally, red 
teams include participants who can accurately represent 
the ethos, intentions, structures, and capabilities of a 
hostile actor or organization. 
For example, red teams could help estimate 
terrorist group's relative priorities for target selection. 
Red teams cannot be expected to divine plans for 
a specific attack, which still requires timely and 
accurate intelligence. 
Empathy as an Analytic Tool. One intelligence 
commentator, psychology professor Ralph White, 
recommends that analysts cultivate empathy to hone 
their understanding of foreign actors "from the inside 
looking out, not merely from the outside looking in." To 
foster empathy, White advises analysts to continually 
pose such questions as the following:g 
� How would I feel if I were facing the situation 
they pre facing now? 
� How would I feel if I had been through the 
experience I know they have been through? 
� How should I correct my first answers to 
those questions on the basis of what I know about the 
differences between their political culture and mine? 
g Psychology professor Ralph White draws a sharp contrast 
between empathy as a tool for understanding an opponent and 
sympathy, which he characterizes as "sharing (or agreeing with) 
the thoughts and feelings of others."

Such efforts to game out the possible outcomes of 
force-on-force encounters often come with high startup 
costs in resources, planning hours, and personnel�
but they can also help simulate the conditions and 
pressures conducive to sudden hostile action. Military 
exercises have multiple purposes, including measuring 
the temptation for the "red" team�the postulated hostile 
actor�to undertake a surprise attack and revealing 
weaknesses in the "blue" team's defenses and 
force posture. 
 In 1932, nearly 10 years before the Japanese 
strike on Pearl Harbor, for example, approximately 
150 US Navy carrier-launched planes successfully 
"attacked" the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl 
Harbor on a Sunday shortly before dawn in a war 
game exercise. 
Navy umpires initially declared the attack 
a total success, news of which was reported in The 
New York Times days later. However, according 
to one academic assessment, Navy commanders 
failed to absorb and disseminate the lessons of the 
widely publicized 1932 exercise, whereas Japanese 
intelligence personnel and military planners appear to(b)(3) 
have closely studied the exercise. 
(b)(3) 
APPLICATION 
(b)(3) 
Military Indications and Warning. The collection (b)(3) 
and assessment of data about the intentions and 
capabilities of foreign military forces has been the basis 
for warning of war in the modern era and can also 
enhance the effectiveness of war games. Since World 
War II, the major powers have spent enormous sums�
the majority of their intelligence budgets�to augment 
their ability to collect data on the military strength, 
weaknesses, operations, training, and weapons of hostile
(b)(3) 
and potentially hostile states. The collection of military 
indicators will remain one of the linchpins of strategic 
warning for three reasons: 
(b)(3) 
 Military preparations are a necessity for war. (b)(3) 
 Many of these military preparations are discernable (b)(3) 
or at least potentially discernable to outside states 
seeking the information. 
(b)(3) 
any,of these preparations are costly and (b)(3) 
disruptive to the civilian economy, so states do 
not undertake them lightly, purely for purposes of 
political theater, or bluff. For that reason, they tend 
to be reliable indicators of seriousness of intent and (b)(3) 
readiness to act. 
Checking for Vulnerability to Coups. Anticipating (b)(3) 
military coups based on intelligence reporting alone 
is rare because the coup plotters�unless they are 
seeking the approval of outside powers�have a powerful 
incentive to maintain secrecy to achieve their aims. 
However, examining five preconditions that correlate 
closely with increased odds of military coups may help 
analysts to anticipate their risks, if not their actual timing. 
Class privilege. To what degree does the military� (b)(3) 
particularly its officer corps�draw from a privileged 
element of society? Is the officer corps perceived as 
a societal elite�such as the Prussian Junkers, who 
controlled the German army before World War I�at 
odds with other elements of society, such as the 
middle class or workers? 
 Historical role. Does the military have a special 
or historical role in upholding the constitution or 
preserving the domestic order, such as the Turkish 
army has had since at least 1960? Does it view 
itself as the custodian of the state or as a state 
within a state, as the Japanese army did in 
pre�World War II Japan?

ecurity crisis. Does the country face a difficult 
national security challenge, such as a serious domestic 
insurgency, revolutionary activism, or a menacing 
strategic rival? Are the commanders of armed forces 
preoccupied with domestic "enemies," such as Chile's 
were before the 1973 coup led by General Aug usto 
Pinochet against President Salvador Allende? 
�nCivil-military strife. Is the military at odds with the 
civilian leadership, such as the Chilean army was 
during Allende's presidency in the early 1970s? 
Does the military tend to distrust democratic or 
civilian elements of the government? Is there a 
sizable civilian element�landowners or privileged 
classes�that support the military's vision against 
that of the government? 
^ olitically ambitious officers. Is the military led 
by "alpha actors" contemptuous of civil authority 
or threatened by militant junior officers who are 
antagonistic to existing political conditions, such as 
those in Japan in the mid-1930s? Is there a cohort 
of junior officers who equally disdain their senior 
commanders or political leaders? 
nAPPLICATION 
Evaluating civil-military relations by these 
criteria�and comparing them with the available 
reporting�can help analysts identify situations that are 
relatively more likely to lead to ruptures in civil-military 
relations, including Coups. Such evaluations should also 
cover the national police and domestic security and 
intelligence forces�particularly if they are uniformed 
or politically influential. Assessments should be tracked 
over time to monitor the trends in civil-military ties 
and determine if the factors conducive to coups are 
worsening or abating. 
(1211 
Stealthy Surprise? Sudden Hostile 
Actions Using Novel Methods 
(UHFOU0) Surprise attacks have traditionally had one 
positive consequence for the decisionmakers of the 
targeted actor: they afford the benefit of strategic clarity. 
Once the attack occurs, the victim state in most cases 
has a general idea of what has happened, who the 
enemy is, what his intentions are, and how the enemy is 
going to pursue them. Future cyber and biological attacks 
might not afford such clarity. 
� The vast majority of such attacks will almost 
certainly employ surprise to maximize effectiveness. 
However their nature and goals will probably not be 
immediately obvious, even after the attack has been 
launched and it is harming the victim state's population, 
economy, or IT infrastructure. 
� Biological warfare attacks, for example, may 
be masked, at least initially, as the onset of natural 
epidemics. Targeted cyber attacks may be impossible 
to distinguish from the work of hackers or of individual 
lone wolves or spontaneous networks.

"A Fatal Lethargy of Mind": A Wartime 
Commander's Take on Preparedness and Surprise 
n the first major naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign�just eight months 
after the Pearl Harbor attack�the Imperial Japanese Navy surprised and routed US and 
Allied surface combatants guarding the Marine beachhead on Guadalcanal. The Battle of 
Savo Island, which took place on 8-9 August 1942, resulted in the sinking of one Australian 
and three US Navy cruisers, with the Japanese sustaining only light damage in return. In 
his after-action report, Adm. Richmond Kelly Turner, commander of US Naval amphibious 
forces in the Pacific, observed the following: 
. . . The [US] Navy was still obsessed with a strong feeling of technical and mental 
superiority over the enemy. In spite of ample evidence of enemy capabilities, most of our 
officers and men despised the Japanese and felt themselves sure victors in all encounters 
under any circumstances. The net result of all this was a fatal lethargy of mind, which 
induced a confidence without readiness and a routine acceptance of outworn peacetime 
standards of conduct. I believe that this psychological factor, as a cause of our defeat, was 
even more important than the element of surprise.rf

Type II Surprise: 
System Shock 
(b)(3) 
System shock involves the abrupt failure or 
rapid transformation of one or more complex systems. 
It includes sudden transitions from stability to instability, 
from order to disorder, from boom to bust. In Type II 
surprise, the focus is not on any unified actor but on a 
system or set of systems (see figure 5). 
�nA system can be a nation, a political 
arrangement, a country or regional economy, 
or a multi-ethnic community. 
sn It can also be a multilateral organization, alliance, 
or empire, such as communist Yugoslavia or the Soviet 
bloc during the Cold War. 
he action in Type II surprise is the result of manifold 
human actions and reactions, but the outcomes are not 
the result of design by any one actor. 
 In contrast to the action in Type I surprise, system 
shocks usually take place in a more geographically 
diffused place (a country or a region) in a somewhat 
longer period of time�weeks, months, or even 
years�but the rate of change is much faster than in 
"normal times." 
In Type II surprise, once-stable regimes and 
systems can quickly unravel after a long period of 
apparent solidity. 
Subtypes and Examples of 
System Shock 
Theilverthrow of a Government. Such shocks result 
in to the ouster of a political leader, rather than the 
he term "butterfly effect" is one of the terms used to 
describe sensitive dependence on initial conditions in chaos 
theory. The term gained popularity after its use in the early 1960s 
by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz, who used 
it to explain the drastic, nonlinear changes in weather forecasts 
generated by his computer model of weather patterns. Lorenz 
attributed these large differences in forecasts to slight variations in 
his initial model settings, which he surmised could be caused in the 
real world by the flapping of a butterfly's wings. 
.(b)(3) 
Defining a Complex System (b)(3) 
A complex system can be defined as any whole (b)(3) 
or entity consisting of diverse, interdependent, 
interacting components that exhibit properties 
not evident in the behavior of the individual (b)(3) 
members�a trait known as emergence. 
Relationships among the parts contain both 
negative (dampening) and positive (amplifying) 
feedback loops. They are nonlinear, which 
means a small disturbance of the system may 
result in big changes (the so-called butterfly 
effect),h a proportional change, or no change at 
all, depending on particular conditions, which 
makes prediction even more difficult. Examples of 
complex systems include ecological communities, 
economies and social structures, global climate, � (b)(3) 
living organisms, regional and global strategic ' 
relationships, and modern infrastructures, such as 
telecommunications or energy. 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
transformation of the social, political, or economic order. (b)(3) 
Examples include the ouster of President Ferdinand 
Marcos in the Philippines in 1986, the fall of President 
Mobutu Sese Seko in then Zaire in 1997, and the 
toppling of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan (b)(3) 
in April 2010. (b)(3) 
 The Failure of a State. Such failures are caused by the (b)(3) 
state's weakness and inability to adapt after one or more 
shocks, such as acute sectarian or ethnic strife. Such 
state failures are often associated with widespread social(b)(3) 
dislocation and hardship as well as with other types of 
system shock, including revolutions and civil wars. 
 Examples include Afghanistan during 1992-96 and(b)(3) 
2001-02, Somalia during 1991-2004, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in 1997-2002, Bosnia in 
1992-95, and Lebanon in 1975-90.

 US Embassy personnel in Tehran--taken hostage by 
Iranian militants shortly after the fall of the Shah of Iran�
are paraded in front of photographers. The collapse of the 
Shah's regime in 1979 demonstrates the rapidity with which 
system shocks can occur, as well as the lasting effects that 
such shocks can inflict on a wider region for years and 
decades to come. 
 The Onset of a Revolution. Revolutions that sweep 
away an entire sociopolitical order and replace it with 
something different are rare. They include the revolutions 
in Russia, China, and Cuba; the uprising against the 
Shah of Iran and the emergence of an Islamic state in 
1978-79; the breakup of the Soviet empire in 1989-91; 
and the dismantlement of the apartheid system in South 
Africa in the early 1990s. 
 A Severe Recession or Grave Economic Calamity. In 
the economy, a system shock can originate in a specific 
market�the stock market, real estate, the financial 
sector, a fast-growing industry�and spread to an entire 
national or regional economy. The initial shock can be 
induced by an asset bubble that bursts or by a physical 
disruption of critical supplies because of war, embargoes, 
or labor trouble. 
 Examples include the Great Depression and, on 
a lesser scale, the global financial crisis. The twin oil 
shocks of the 1970s�caused by pricing policy of the 
OPEC oil cartel after the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 and 
the Iranian revolution of 1978-79, respectively�are 
examples of supply-origin shocks. 
Environmental catastrophes�such as the accident 
at the nuclear plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in the USSR 
Famines caused by state actions that are motivated by 
ideological ambition, such as the large-scale Ukrainian famine 
of 1932-33 (early in Josef Stalin's rule) or Mao Zedong's Great 
Leap Forward in 1958-61, are more akin to Type I surprise�
sudden hostile action�in their origins and in their effects on the 
victim population. 
Communal violence includes ethnic, tribal, linguistic, or 
religious disturbances that involve violence or the threat of violence 
and damage to property. 
in 1986�or famines' because of natural disasters, 
poor land use, or inept state policies can also trigger 
system shocks. 
 Poor central bank management of the money (b)(3) 
supply can lead to hyperinflations, such as the one that 
plagued Weimar, Germany, during the early 1920s or 
Zimbabwe in the 2003-08 period. 
 The Outbreak of Communal Violence. The outbreak (b)(3) 
of communal violence may illustrate system shock 
if it is primarily because of an unplanned flareup of 
longstanding social or ethnic tensions sparked by a 
random clash or incident, rather than to premeditated 
action by states or armed groups, which may choose to 
exploit the outbreak of communal violence as a pretext to 
further their goals. 
 Examples of communal violencei include 
intermittent Hindu-Muslim violence in India, the 
Uighur-Han Chinese violence in mid-2009, the 
anti-Uzbek riots in Kyrgyzstan in 1990, and the 
anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia in 1969. Such 
riots are usually localized and rarely lead to 
state-backed genocide. 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
 The Collapse of an International Organization or (b)(3) 
Alliance. The breakdown of an international organization 
or alliance under mounting duress�unless it is the direct 
result of hostile military action�is also an example of 
system shock. 
Some military alliances�the World War ll "Grand 
Alliance" that defeated Nazi Germany, for example�
break up because they achieve their immediate 
objective and then the member-states fall out over 
postwar security arrangements. 
 Others, such as the Soviet-dominated Warsaw 
Pact, crumble to the result of dramatic changes in 
regime type or collapse of the dominant member. 
 Still others fall victim to irrelevance and poor 
leadership, such as the Southeast Asia Treaty 
Organization in the 1970s.

 Patterns of Financial Bubbles: 
One Economist's View 
  The features of. . . manias and financial crises are never identical, and yet there is a 
similar pattern. The increase in prices in commodities or real estate or stocks is associated 
with euphoria; household wealth increases and so does spending. There is a sense of 'We 
never had it so good'. . . 
 . . Rational exuberance begins to morph into irrational exuberance, economic euphoria 
develops and investment and consumption spending increase. There is a pervasive sense 
that it is 'time to get on the train' . . . Asset prices increase further. The seers in the 
economy forecast perpetual economic growth and some venturesome ones proclaim no 
more recessions�the traditional business cycle .. . is obsolete. 
  . . . An increasingly large share of the purchases of these assets is undertaken in 
anticipation of short-term capital gains and an exceptionally large share of these purchases 
is financed with credit . . . Then the asset prices peak, and then begin to decline . . . 
. . The decline in the prices of some assets leads to the concern that asset prices will 
decline further and that the financial system will experience 'distress.' The rush to sell 
these assets before prices decline further become self-fulfilling and so precipitous that it 
resembles a panic .. . The implosion of a bubble has been associated with declines in the 
prices of commodities, stocks, and real estate, and often these declines have been associated 
with a rash or a financial crisis. Some financial crises were preceded by a rapid increase in 
the indebtedness of one or several groups of borrowers rather than by a rapid increase in the 
price of an asset or security. Yr

Crises, 2005�three years before the 2008 financial crisis. 
Economic analysts can assess the resiliency of an economic system's financial 
sector, monitor early indicators of rapid inflation in assets prices, and brainstorm the broad 
economic, political, and social consequences if an asset bubble were to burst.

Anticipating Irrationality? 
 An economic expert on financial crises, Charles 
P. Kindleberger, once listed some phraseology 
historically applied to speculative bubbles: 
  Ct.. . Manias.. . insane speculation. 
blind passion . .. financial orgies. . . frenzies 
... feverish speculation . . wishful thinking 
. .. intoxicated investors. .. turning a blind 
eye.. . a fool's paradise ... overconfidence. . 
. overspeculation . overtrading . . . a raging 
appetite .. . a craze. .. a mad rush to expand.il 
Economic analysts have to be alert to 
occasions when the strongly positive feedback 
loops associated with the early stages of a bubble 
develop, resulting in "herd behavior" that belies 
assumptions about rational economic actors.

actors and factors at play, the harder it is for observers to 
disentangle causal relationships or distinguish between 
clues that are relevant ("signals") and those that are 
not ("noise"). 
� Frequently, the causes and effects of accelerating 
instability blur when one variable�such as economic 
performance�is so tightly linked to other variables, 
including labor peace, tax revenues, welfare state 
outlays, and political stability. 
.n Natural disasters, accidents, blunders, weather, and 
chance further complicate strategic foresight by adding 
a bewildering element of randomness. 
Straight Line Extrapolations. Historical studies 
of intelligence failures and recent research into cognitive 
science both suggest that expectations that "tomorrow 
will look like today" are deeply rooted. Most human 
beings�including the foreign leaders and institutions 
that analysts monitor�have an ingrained need for order 
and predictability. On a day-to-day basis, analysts' 
expectations that any change in the short term will be 
modest and incremental will usually be borne out. 
� Most organizations�state bureaucracies, 
militaries, political parties�generally try to maintain 
an orderly state of affairs and adhere to standard 
operating procedures. The customs and protocols of 
diplomatic relations and international organizations 
channel and contain quarrels via orderly procedures 
and established patterns of interaction. 
� 
The Search for Universal 
Indicators of Political Instability 
Intelligence organizations and political 
scientists have long sought reliable indicators of 
looming political instability that are valid across 
systems and regions�so far with only modest 
success (see figure 6). Many experts deny such 
universal indicators even exist because of the 
importance of national and local idiosyncrasies 
and the sheer indecipherability of foreign actors. 
However, a contributor to the CIA journal Studies in 
Intelligence in the 1980s noted that, although the 
existence of reliable, truly universal indicators is 
doubtful, the presence of a youth bulge is often a 
common denominator of political instability. 
�  The author observes that young 
people are generally more volatile than older 
people, have less in the way of vested interests 
to lose, and are more willing to protest. Thus, 
"if in the relevant population [nation, city, or 
ethnic group], the youth bulge hits a certain 
[undetermined] high percentage, a major 
change becomes more likely." A youth bulge 
skewed toward young males, especially in poor 
countries, may be a particularly acute early 
indicator of sociopolitical instability. 
The same author notes the importance 
of monitoring possible breaches of "implicit 
promises and bargains"�expectations shared 
by the leaders and the led regarding minimally 
acceptable standards for national security and 
honor, domestic order, economic well-being, 
and state accountability. Breaches of such 
understandings can, under the right conditions, 
lead to a powerful backlash among hitherto 
acquiescent populations.

Triggers of Instability: The Importance of Precipitating Events 
A trigger of political instability can be any catalyzing event that prompts significant numbers of once apathetic 
or intimidated citizens to take action against a government. Such triggers can take a wide variety of forms, depending 
on regime type, culture, popular grievances, and the state of civil society. Such triggers are usually unpredictable, driven 
by tactical conditions, and not always unobservable to outsiders�especially foreigners. Most governments can usually 
ride out one or two such triggers, unless they happen in rapid succession or the regime botches its follow-up response, 
resulting in a radicalization of once apathetic citizens.

Aids To Anticipating Type II Surprise 
Traditional intelligence sources are often of 
limited use in anticipating Type ll surprise, because 
system shocks often result from cascades or "tipping 
points"�when a system transitions rapidly from apparent 
stability to instability�that not even the actors within the 
system can accurately forecast. 
Herd effects and reinforcing feedback 
loops can rapidly destabilize or shatter a once-stable 
system more quickly than the typical reaction times of 
traditional intelligence reporting and analysis cycles. 
Intelligence reporting that comes into the 
analyst's work station is "old" news. Whether it was , 
collected only minutes, hours, months, or years ago, it 
provides a picture of what once was�not necessarily 
what will be. 
 Analysts' long-established mental models 
and paradigms will no longer reflect the fast-changing 
situation on the ground, as a tipping point looms. 
 IC analysts could therefore benefit from 
supplementing scrutiny of intelligence reporting with other 
means to enhance strategic warning of system shocks. 
These approaches and concepts focus on improving 
analytic anticipation of system shocks by: 
 Assessing the potential brittleness and 
fragility of apparently stable systems. 
  Enhancing awareness of the signs of rapid 
change in complex systems. 
 Applying far-domain analogies from other 
fields, particularly the sciences, to anticipate phase 
transitions in intelligence targets. 
� Widening the range of imaginable outcomes. 
nticipate System Shifts and Tipping Points. 
ere is a growing body of scholarly and popular literature 
on the dynamics of nonlinear change in various domains. 
In journalism, academia, and intelligence, the use of such 
terms as "tipping points," "phase transitions," and "black 
swans" have become widespread. Awareness of even 
the basics of complex adaptive systems�reinforcing 
feedback loops, snowball effects, herd behavior, 
nonlinearity�can help analysts get ahead of the curve, 
without waiting for hard intelligence to come in after the 
system shock has already occurred. 
Although sophisticated mathematical 
modeling is required to fully exploit the potential 
of complex systems analysis, even a qualitative, 
graphics-based approach to the actors and the 
feedback channels can help analysts map a 
system's interactions and assess its vulnerability to 
system shock.

On Black Swans 
Black swan" events�a term popularized by 
author and philosopher Nassim Nicholas Taleb in 
2007�are extreme events outside the realm of 
popular expectations. They are difficult to model 
and carry heavy impacts, such as the rise of the 
Internet or the global financial crisis. 
  Complex systems that have artificially 
suppressed volatility tend to become extremely 
fragile, while at the same time exhibiting no 
visible risks. In fact, they tend to be too calm 
and exhibit minimal variability as silent risks 
accumulate beneath the surface . .. These 
artificially constrained systems become prone to 
black swans�that is, they become vulnerable to 
large-scale events that lie far from statistical norms 
and were largely unpredictable to a given set of 
observers.. . catching everyone off guard/3

Analysts can pursue a complex systems

or bolstering security for a small country�and the 
system's most important and volatile networks. (b)(3) 
 This assessi-nent makes linkages explicit

Employ Far-Domain Analogies. Analogies from 
the realms of engineering, medicine, and the sciences (b)(3) 
can help IC analysts conceptualize sudden dramatic 
departures from a seemingly stable equilibrium in the 
regions or issues they follow. Such analogies should not 
be transferred automatically across domains, but they 
can spur creative thinking about possible discontinuities 
in many analytic disciplines (see figure 7). 
� For example, concepts such as the "butterfly 
effect"�originally derived from meteorological 
modeling�can illustrate the idea that small initial 
changes may produce nonlinear results (or sensitive 
dependence on initial conditions), such as was the 
case in Tunisia when a minor altercation between a 
fruit vendor and a low-level civil servant triggered the 
unrest that deposed strongman Ben Ali in 2011 after 
28 years in power.

Far-Domain Analogies: Aids To Anticipating Discontinuities

Concepts for rapid change from other disciplines or domains can help spur analysts thinking about the ways 
that discontinuities might crop up in the systems that they monitor. Simply brainstorming the types of "seismic forces" 
that may build up under an autocratic government, for example, can help analysts think creatively about the forms that 
a "phase transition"�a rapid transition from one state to another, from predictability to unpredictability�may take in 
their areas of analytic responsibility. Similarly, employing the analogy of "brittleness" from materials science to diagnose 
a maladaptive system�an alliance, an international organization, or an armed force under severe strain�may help 
analysts to think about system vulnerabilities in a new way.

UNCLASSIFIED CIAL USE ONLY 
 The term "contagion," originally from epidemiology, 
is often used to describe the spread of financial or 
political instability from one country or region to areas 
previous thought stable (immune) from such volatility. 
"Brittleness"�a concept borrowed from 
materials science�can be applied to political systems 
that have endured over time but that may yet be 
vulnerable to unforeseen shocks. This far-domain 
analogy is particularly applicable to personalist 
authoritarian states that have not adapted to social or 
technological changes and that may be vulnerable to 
swift overthrow if a political challenge arises suddenly or 
from an unseen direction. Analytic teams can brainstorm 
the pillars of traditional authority in the countries or 
institutions that they follow and examine the relative 
degree of brittleness of each pillar, over time. 
nAPPLICATION 
Analysts can list or brainstorm in small 
groups the possible discontinuities that may loom in 
their areas of analytic responsibility. Using a handful 
of far-domain analogies for massive discontinuous 
change�earthquakes, perfect storms, "black swans," 
phase transitions�can spur creativity. Such metaphors 
for big change can help analysts get past status quo 
assumptions and dispel entrenched mind-sets 
regarding the permanence of only linear or evolutionary 
change. For example, analysts might regularly ask the 
following questions: 
What sorts of fault lines exist in my area 
of analytic responsibility�such as the aspirations of 
a rising social class versus the power and privileges 
of an entrenched autocratic ruler, the enduring 
enmity between two ethnic or religious groups, or 
the irreconcilable goals of two parties locked in an 
enduring strategic rivalry? 
With these fault lines in mind, what keeps 
the lid on? How strong are those forces for restraint? 
Might these inhibitors be weakening? 
 What factors might bring those latent 
antagonisms into open conflict? What might make 
an "earthquake" more likely? What might trigger a 
catastrophic event? 
What might happen after such a catastrophe 
occurs? The discussion should include the 
nonobvious, indirect, and long-term effects, as well as 
the more immediate, likely, or obvious ones. 
(b)(3) 
Conduct War Games or Crisis Simulations. Apart (b)(3) 
from their utility in assessing the risks of sudden hostile 
action, these exercises can also help analysts game out 
a complex sequence of events. A war game or simulation 
is a technique designed to model�either rigorously or 
creatively�the operations and responses of a real-world 
process, organization, or system over time. No other tool 
is as helpful in scoping the dynamics and in bounding 
the imaginable outcomes of multiple interactions among 
many interdependent actors, such as those precipitated 
by the launch of a separatist movement or the escalating 
tensions caused by a radical state on the brink of 
acquiring nuclear weapons. 
 Academic studies�amply supported by centuries 
of military experience with simulations�demonstrate 
that no other method consistently provides players with 
a more realistic sense of the volatility, time pressures, 
perceptions, and risks of unexpected moves by actors 
in a strategic game environment. 
Simulations can also provide players with a 
laboratory to challenge assumptions, test the readiness 
of actors for escalation and discontinuities, and explore 
the effects of randomness, friction, and wild cards on 
crisis scenarios. 
APPLICATION 
As a historian of technological failures, Charles 
Perrow in the 1980s examined "normal accidents"�
his term for the "inevitable" failures of tightly coupled 
technological systems, such as nuclear power 
plants, space vehicles, and oil rigs. Other analysts of 
technological systems speak of "cascading failure." 
Perrow's concepts can be applied to 
complex political and economic systems, such as 
the EU, the Chinese Communist Party, or the global 
financial system. 
Analysts planning a simulation can ask, 
"What are the 'normal accidents' waiting to happen?" 
in their areas of analytic responsibility�such as the 
inability of a stagnant authoritarian system to manage 
a serious economic downturn. They can then examine 
what other systems�economic, security, or military�
may be at risk of spillover effects should the political 
system fail.

Identify and Monitor Breached Social Contracts. 
Just as deep understanding of a potential foe's strategic 
red lines is critical to assessing the risks of a surprise 
attack, so is awareness of informal social contracts�the 
unwritten expectations of accountability and obedience 
between the rulers and the ruled�critical to the 
assessment of political stability. 
Implicit promises and bargains are key 
elements of political stability. Such understandings 
limit uncertainty and set ground rules, according to one 
intelligence officer involved in instability analysis. When 
a social contract is breached, it creates preconditions 
for political instability. 
Examples of such breaches might include 
blatant electoral fraud, a policy blunder, flagrant 
corruption, scandalous conduct by an unpopular 
member of an autocrat's inner circle or family, or 
unprovoked violence against unarmed protestors, 
especially if such breaches are captured in visual 
media that can be disseminated widely. 
 APPLICATION 
Periodic reviews of the terms of various 
country-specific social contracts and of possible signs of 
a violation may tip off political analysts to an erosion of 
legitimacy that often precedes a political system shock. 
Analysts can ask, "Is country X now breaking 
an implicit social contract, or is it likely to do so in the 
near-term future?" 
Seasoned substantive experts are the best 
sources for identifying the terms of implicit promises 
between the leaders and the led and for assessing the 
indicators of a possible breach. 
t  ,=r.vmm.xuaaea, 
Conduct "What If" and High-Impact Scenario 
Analyses. Well-crafted scenarios and alternative futures 
can also help analysts move beyond near-term tactical 
assessment and straight line extrapolation. Academic 
postmortems of various intelligence failures often point 
to the penchant for single-point predictions�often (b)(3) 
anchored around the yesteryear's status quo�as 
the bane of sound strategic foresight. Well-depicted 
scenarios that are based on valid key drivers and fleshed 
out by multidisciplinary experts can widen readers' range 
of imaginable outcomes. 
APPLICATION 
IMO 
(b)(3) 
(10)(j) 
"What If" analysis involves postulating that (b)(3) 
a possible discontinuity has already occurred. This 
allows analysts to sidestep irresolvable debates over the 
likelihood of the event and focus on the possible drivers, 
proximate causes, and signposts of the postulated (b)(3) 
event. Analysts can work backwards to, envision one or 
more plausible paths to the event and reason forward to 
assess its direct and indirect implications. 
High-impact scenario analysis is similar. It (b)(3) 
allows analysts to move beyond status quo assumptions 
and expectations of small-scale change and focus on the 
more worrisome discontinuities that could be looming., 
the probabilities of which are generally thought to be low 
but are actually uncertain or variable. (b)(3) 
�(b)(3) 
Unlike in the physical world, a shock in the 
realm of human affairs does not typically result in a 
swift return to a stable, if drastically altered, new status 
quo. Instead, system shocks often lead to relatively long 
stretches of grinding instability and unpredictability, as 
various actors try to comprehend and cope with new 
conditions, exploit or resist opportunities for further 
change, and pick their way amongst the ruins of the old 
order. Major wars, widespread regional unrest, and the 
falls of empires are notorious for ushering in years and 
decades of heightened instability in their turbulent wake. (b)(3) 
Analysts working such intractable circumstances should 
have little expectations of a rapid return to preshock 
normalcy or stability.

Type III Surprise: 
Tectonic Transformation 
(b)(3) 
Tectonic transformation involves the alteration 
of an entire domain or region, such as a continental 
economy, a regional military balance, a belief system, or 
technological network. Unlike sudden hostile actions or 
system shocks, tectonic transformations are not discrete 
events but extended historical processes, often lasting 
years or decades (see figure 8). 
 They do not involve sudden or immediately 
obvious change, but rather large-scale, cumulative 
evolutionary changes that transform with gathering 
momentum entire domains, along with the strategic, 
political, and economic systems therein. 
In Type III surprise, the main actor is a 
national, regional, or global system�such as the 
industrialized Western economies or the global security 
system�made up of a huge number of interdependent 
actors that include people, societies, states, and 
institutions, none of whom control the domain. The 
engine of change�for example, the emergence of 
a revolutionary new technology, a compelling new 
ideology, or a new global power�drives the gradual but 
deep-rooted transformation of politics, society, economic 
life, and military affairs. 
� 
 In Type III surprise, the surprise is usually 
not the main driver of change itselfbut rather the 
social, political, economic, and military consequences 
of that driver. 
The widely distributed, cumulative nature 
of tectonic change often eludes observers, including 
intelligence organizations. The changes associated 
with Type III surprise are usually imperceptible at first 
and then deceptively inconspicuous�"hidden in plain 
sight"�compared with the day-to-day "crises" featured 
in much of the global media.

techniques vastly increase long-term labor productivity 
and overall productive capacity. These gains, in turn, 
permit large jumps in living standards, food production, 
public health, state capacity, and military potential. 
These transformations are invariably linked to dramatic 
changes in business organization, working conditions, 
and producer-consumer relations. Over time they also 
transform politics, societies, and education. � 
�Lilirhe Industrial Revolution that began in Great 
Britain in the middle of the 18th century and that 
made the United Kingdom the world's most powerful 
state by the middle of the next century remains the 
leading example. 
 Other examples include a unified Germany's 
explosive industrial growth between 1870 and 1914, 
the expansion of the aerospace industry in the 
United States between 1930s and early 1970s, the 
global revolution in information technologies since 
World War II, and China's meteoric economic ascent 
since 1979.
