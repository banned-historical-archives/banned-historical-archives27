 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 June 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST NEGOTIATIONS
 FV
 Foreign Minister Gromyko ap-
 pears to be playing for time at
 Geneva on the assumption that the
 Western powers will eventually
 take the initiative in working
 out a compromise  formula  on
 Berlin  at  a minimum  cost to
 the  USSR,--a,. formula'which will
 open the    way to a summit;meet-
 ing.
 . Khrushchev and Gromyko have
 maintained their unyielding pos-
 ture on Berlin and a German
 peace treaty in public state-
 ments and have categorically
 rejected the Western proposals
 for an all-Berlin solution.   In
 his speech on 30 May in Tirana,
 Xhrushchev declared,  "We do not
 have to make any concessions
 because our proposals have not
 beef made for bartering."  The
 Soviet leaders apparently are
 counting heavily on their abil-
 ity to exploit any divergences
 among the Western powers regard-
 ing terms for an interim Berlin
 arrangement.
 Soviet propaganda is stress-
 ing that alleged Western in-
 transigence is imposed by West
 German "revanchists and mili-
 tarists," abetted by French
 "ruling circles."   In his Tirana
 speech,on 30  May,   Khrushchev
 made  a  thinly  veiled  attack
 on  President de Gaulle,   remark-
 ing  that certain                French states-
 men,   who  not               so   long  ago
 "fled from  the German   troops
 to  Britain and other countries,"
 have  failed to  "draw the rele-
 vant                lessons from the  two
 wars  started by   German mili-
 tarism."
 In the plenary session on
 30 May, Gromyko defined the task
 of the foreign ministers' con-
 ference regarding Berlin as re-
 placing the wartime four-power
 agreement on Berlin by a new
 agreement which adjusts the Ber-
 lin situation to present condi-
 tions in Germany.   He defended
 the Soviet free-city plan for
 West Berlin and called for a
 four-power pledge of noninter-
 ference in the internal affairs
 of the free city and a guarantee
 of its "free relations" with
 the outside world.
 Gromyko also introduced a
 proposal for a permanent com-
 mission composed of the four
 powers and East Germany to en-
 sure that the free-city status
 is observed.   The counselor
 of the Soviet Embassy in Paris
 had suggested to an American of-
 ficial in Geneva on 29 May that
 free access and political free-
 dom of West Berlin should be
 guaranteed by a "Joint commission"
 composed of the four powers only.
 It is likely that Gromyko will
 declare himself willing to bar-
 gain on the composition  of
 such a commission to demonstrate
 the USSR's desire for productive
 negotiations.
 Pressure on Bonn
 Soviet propaganda attacking
 the allegedly negative.attitude
 of the West German delegation
 at Geneva has been accompanied
 by private efforts to induce the
 opposition West German Social
 Democrats (SPD) to push their

 plan for reunification and dis-

 accord with Adenauer's  poli-
 cy."  The  article  conclud-
 ed,   "Thus  the  SPD's road
 must, lead to  Geneva."
 East Germany
 The SPD proposal provides
 among other things for an all-
 German committee with equal rep-
 resentation., a ban on nuclear
 weapons, withdrawal of foreign
 troops from a Central European
 zone including Germany, Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, and Hungary,
 and the withdrawal of these
 countries from NATO and the
 Warsaw Pact.   The Russians prob-
 ably believe that these aspects
 of the plan can be exploited
 to embarrass the Bonn govern-
 ment and bring further.pressure
 on the Western position.
 Evidencing close coordina-
 tion on this question with Mos-
 cow, East German party First
 Secretary Walter Ulbricht on 24
 May declared that members of
 the Bonn parliament who are "ad-
 vocates of a peaceful solution
 of the German question" should
 explain their viewpoint to the
 various  delegations  at  Ge-
 neva.
 In line with this, the
 party organ Neues Deutschland
 on 27 May appealed  o   e
 to propagandize its plan and
 introduce it at Geneva as "the
 plan of a great part of the West
 German people who are not in
 In a press interview on
 27 May, Ulbricht reiterated the
 standard East German line on
 Berlin.   He attacked the Western
 proposals on Berlin, called for
 a peace treaty with both German
 states if possible or, failing
 this, with East Germany alone,
 and reaffirmed the bloc position
 that a separate treaty would
 end Western rights to remain in
 West Berlin.   On the question
 of East Germany acting as the
 agent of the USSR in exercising
 Berlin access controls, Ulbricht
 resorted to an ambiguous reply
 whi ;h might possibly imply that
 his regime would agree to accept
 this role.
 Ulbricht also stated that
 in the event West Berlin is con-
 verted into a free city, com-
 munications between East Ber-
 lin and the Western sector
 would continue.   He asserted
 that East Germany would have
 "no objections in principle"
 to United Nations participation
 in guaranteeing West Berlin's
 status as a free city, although
 "certain practical questions"
 would have to be worked out
 with the East Germans.
 The East Germans stepped
 up their attacks on Bonn's al-
 leged "militarism" and "fascism"
 with a press conference in Ge-
 neva conducted by Defense Minis-
 ter Lt. Gen. Heinz Hoffman. The
 Swiss-manned secretariat of the
 International Press Center sub-
 sequently issued a sharp warning

 to the East German delegation
 that further abuses of the cen-
 ter's facilities would lead to
 the withdrawal of privileges.
 West German Opinion
 The majority of West German
 and West Berlin editorial opinion
 expects two results from the
 current foreign ministers' nego-
 tiations: a communique agreeing
 to maintain the status quo in
 Berlin, with no definite time
 limit; and an agreement on a
 summit conference.  Bonn's state-
 ment  in Geneva ruling out an
 interim, status quo agreement
 lasting only until the summit
 meeting was interpreted as a
 move to forestall British con-
 sideration of such a solution,
 Most papers saw the conference
 as entering a crucial stage in
 which the alternatives were a
 limited Berlin agreement lead-
 ing to a summit meeting or a
 new "crisis."
 Iraq
 Non-Communists in Iraq are
 hopeful  that  Prime  Minister
 Qasim intends to further limit
 the influence of the Communists,
 although  Qasim  has  still
 made no positive move in that
 direction. Encouragement comes
 in part from a new tone in Bagh-
 dad  radio  during  the             past
 two weeks but this may have been
 due to the absence of the radio
 boss,   Salim  Fakhri, in  Mos-
 cow.   On 1 June the radio re-
 turned     to  a  more  familiar
 line,   warning  that erroneous
 interpretations of Qasim's view
 of  political party   activi-
 ties   had  left an   opening
 for the "imperalists" and "re-
 actionaries" to exploit.
 The radio also hailed the
 departure from Baghdad on 1 June
 of an Iraqi delegation, headed
 by a Communist leader and made
 up largely of fellow travelers,
 which is to explain Iraq's "re-
 publican" policy to other Arab
 and North African states.  The
 delegation's first stop is Mo-
 rocco, and it hopes to visit
 Tunisia,   Libya, the  Sudan,
 Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon as
 well.
 Widespread rumors in Iraq
 of an impending anti-Communist
 coup  attempt  appear  to  be
 a by-product of the apparent
 coolness between Qasim and
 the. Communists.  Several
 of  the  rumors  have  put
 the coup date in early June.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 There are even more persistent
 rumors that Qasim's pro-Commu-
 nist aide-de-camp,   Col. Wasfi
 Tahir, and the pro-Communist
 army chief of plans, Brigadier
 Taha Ahmad, are to be given am-
 bassadorial appointments. So
 far there is no substantiation
 of any of these rumors, although
 there may have been some in-
 cidents, as reported in the Bagh-
 dad Communist press, of anti-
 Communist activity in outlying
 districts.
 Qasim's own attitudes re-
 main as ambivalent as ever.
 He has explained that the can-
 cellation last week of the
 Iraqi-American military assist-
 ance agreement, and of the spe-
 cial assistance agreement which
 followed Iraq's adherence to
 the Eisenhower Doctrine, was to
 remove "factors of animosity"
 between the Iraqi and American
 peoples.   He also asserted that
 he knows the Iraqi Communists
 as "sincere, patriotic" people,
 and he said he was certain that
 "sincere" people would not be-
 come "plotters,"
 General Abboud, after an
 initial period of indecision,
 this week ordered the arrest of
 the two top leaders of the abor-
 tive military coup attempt of
 22 May. The Sudanese Government
 has announced that Brigadiers
 Shannan and Abdullah, along with
 a number of junior officers,
 will be tried for treason by a
 court martial.  Abboud's move
 followed the conclusion of an
 army investigation into the coup
 attempt.  A meeting of army com-
 manders was held in Khartoum at
 the end of last week to hear the
 evidence, and it apparently de-
 cided to back Abboud in restor-
 ing discipline and curbing the
 junior officers' movement.
 The Abboud regime moved at
 the same time against Sudanese
 leftists.  A number of civilian
 leaders of the Communist party
 and other left-wing organizations
 have been arrested as well as
 some leaders of the pro-Egyptian
 National Unionist party,   There
 appears to be no real relation-
 ship between the arrests and the
 conspiracy in the army, although
 the Communists may have utilized
 the recent period of uncertainty
 to increase their activity.
 While General Abboud and
 the relatively conservative
 senior officers seem to have
 successfully asserted themselves,
 the basic problems which pro-
 duced dissatisfaction among the
 junior officers have not been
 solved, and a new movement may
 develop.   Its development would
 be hastened if Abboud gave new
 signs of appeasement; according
 to some reports, he has relieved
 Brigadier Hasan Bashir Nasir,
 who was one of the Shannan
 group's most determined oppo-
 nents, as deputy army commander.
 UAR President Nasir seems
 to be in one of his more relaxed
 and moderate moods.  Although
 Cairo's propaganda machine is
 replying as usual to attacks it
 feels have been made on the UAR,
 no special campaigns seem to be
 under way, and in this atmosphere
 the UAR has been considering and
 pursuing further negotiations
 with its old enemies, Britain

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 While Nasir is willing, for
 both diplomatic and more press-
 ing economic reasons, to accel-
 erate           a                rapprochement  with
 France, he still clearly fears
 that such a development would
 be used against him by Moscow,
 Baghdad, and other enemies. Na
 Sir also believes that the time
 has come for a "re-*exarnination"
 of the UAR's relations with
 Britain.   Real progress toward
 a final settlement of the after-
 math of the Suez war has been
 stymied by Cairo's-unwilling-
 ness to accord diplomatic priv-
 ileges to the British financial
 mission in Cairo.
 The Jordanian monarchy's
 sense of security does not ap-
 pear to have been materially
 enhanced by the arrest of former
 chief of staff Sadiq Shara on
 charges of plotting a coup dur-
 ing King Husayn's recent world
 tour.  Amman remains full of
 rumors of further retirements
 of army officers who are not ac-
 ceptable to the Bedouin officer
 clique, although there are a few
 .signs that the government may
 be trying to avoid complete domi-
 nation by a Bedouin-controlled
 army.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Khrushchev arrived in
 Tirana on 25 May for a scheduled
 12-day visit, accompanied by
 Defense Minister Malinovsky,
 presidium member Mukhitdinov,
 Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin,
 and six other officials.   The
 ostensible-purpose for the visit
 was to strengthen the appearance
 of bloc solidarity and to dem-
 onstrate Soviet concern and in-
 terest in Albania.   At the same
 time,  Khrushchev used the oc-
 casion to make pronouncements
 on "the German question," the
 foreign ministers' and summit
 conferences,  and to sharpen the
 Soviet attack on projected US
 missile bases in Italy and Greece.
 In his most explicit
 statement on missile bases while
 in Albania, Khrushchev also
 warned that if Greece "embarks
 on the same dangerous road as
 Italy" in yielding to US pres-
 sure, the USSR and Albania would
 be forced to "agree to the
 establishment on Albanian soil
 of rocket bases aimed at Italy
 and Greece."
 Khrushchev recalled a
 proposal first made by Rumanian
 Premier Stoica in September 1957
 for a Balkan conference of heads
 of government to discuss "con-
 solidation of peace in the area.
 He also renewed a proposal first
 made by Bulgarian Premier Yugov
 in January 1958 for a Balkan
 zone in which nuclear weapons
 and rockets would be prohibited.
 Subsequent propaganda by Moscow
 suggests that the bloc may fol-
 low this up with~a call for a
 regional "summit conference"--
 to include Yugoslavia, Greece,
 Turkey, and Italy--in order to
 discuss the creation of a nu-

 POLISH COMMUNIST PARTY EXTENDING ITS CONTROL
 Developments in Poland so
 far this year suggest a tight-
 ening of party and government
 control over domestic affairs.
 The effort has become more pro-
 nounced since Gomulka emerged
 from the third party congress
 in March as undisputed master
 of the Polish party.   While the
 Polish regime still retains
 characteristics which set it
 off from its orthodox Communist
 neighbors, Gomulka has been mov-
 ing to restrict practices which
 are inconsistent with Communist
 philosophy.
 Gomulka has long wanted to
 strengthen the party's hold over
 the population at the expense
 of the Catholic Church, and at
 the party congress he warned
 the church to stay out of poli-
 tics.           The state has recently
 reinterpreted the law exempting
 church funds used for religious
 purposes from taxation.   If ap-
 plied extensively, the new taxa-
 tion would tend in the long run
 to make the population more de-
 pendent upon the regime for so-
 cial and charitable services.
 Gomulka, can be expected to move
 cautiously so as not to jeopard-
 ize the internal stability he
 has achieved.
 In the countryside, the re-
 gime's policy has been to use
 persuasion father than coercion
 to extend party influence.   The
 state continues its support for
 private farmers--a sharp departure
 from bloc practice.   Since the
 party congress, the regime has
 encouraged the development of a
 countrywide network of agricul-
 tural "circles"--loose cooperative
 associations.   Local party or-
 ganizations will give economic
 aid to the "circles,"  a move
 Which will. increase present de-
 -pendence on the party.
 Problems with dissident in-
 tellectuals and recalcitrant
 youths still plague the regime.
 Gomulka's remarks on writers at
 the party congress indicated that
 the regime would continue:to
 force conformity with its policies
 and would not permit revisionist
 literature to be published.   Eco-
 nomic sanctions, such as refusal
 to publish an author's work, may
 in time force many writers to
 be more cooperative.   The re-
 gime is approaching the subject
 cautiously, however, apparently
 to avoid accusations of having
 returned to the abuses of the
 pre-Gomulka era.
 In the universities, the re-
 gime is demanding political in-
 doctrination courses and impos-
 ing greater discipline.   Incoming
 students and instructors will be
 screened for proper political
 orientation, and those students

 Compulsory courses in Marxism-

 next fall, to combat the strong

 While Polish police and
 judicial practices continue in
 sharp contrast to those in other
 satellites, the regime claims that
 the prospecution':organs have been
 compelled to return to summary
 procedures to deal with the
 "dangerous situation" resulting
 from the widespread economic
 crimes.  This is a definite
 step backward in the legaliza-

 effected since 1956.
 A crop failure is likely
 in the southern European satel-

 drought which began last sum-

 May, the situation had become
 critical in Bulgaria and Ruma-

 and was only slightly
 less serious in Al-

 of the situation in
 Hungary has been at
 least temporarily
 alleviated by rains
 since mid-May.
 The development of winter
 grains--wheat and rye--and of

 small-grain production for the
 second consecutive year but
 will have a disastrous effect
 on over-all agricultural produc-
 tion.
 In addition to drought,
 other developments which normal-
 ly have adverse effects on agri-
 cultural production have been
 taking place in these satellites.
 Rapid collectivization drives
 or vast organizational changes
 have occurred throughout the
 area since the 1958 harvest.
 Bulgaria has followed extensive
 merging of collective farms with
 initial reorganization  of
 machine-tractor stations, labor
 and payment innovations, and
 introduction of an agricultural
 procurement system  similar to
 that in the USSR.  Hungary al-
 most doubled the socialist sec-
 tor  of agriculture by tripling
 the area.in collectives between
 mid-December and the end of
 March.   Albania and Rumania
 have combined less dramatic col-
 lectivization with substantial
 organizational changes.
 Below average grain produc-
 tion coming after these drives
 and organizational changes could
 increase unrest among peasants
 and retard collectivization.   If
 the drought goes unbroken, ex-
 port obligations of agricultural
 commodities to other bloc coun-
 tries cannot be fulfilled and
 the USSR will once again have
 to supply urban populations of
 the southern satellites with
 large quantities of grain.
 Crop prospects in the north-
 ern satellites--Czechoslovakia,
 East Germany, and Poland--where
 distribution and amounts of pre-
 cipitation have been more nearly
 normal, are relatively much bet-

 party's heady expectations.
 These were based on a claimed
 doubling of food-grain produc-
 tion last year--a claim which
 grossly overstated the results
 of a good crop year.
 There may be some basis
 to Liao's fears of a short-
 fall as a result of acreage re-
 ductions.   It is possible that
 the regime's brave talk about
 the practicability of reducing
 sown acreage while farming lim-
 ited areas with the intensive
 cultivation methods introduced
 last summer did lead to actual
 reductions.
 Peiping is also concerned
 about the effect this spring of
 other "leap forward" farm poli-
 cies.   Indiscriminate applica-
 tion of intensive cultivation
 methods has led to the threat
 of widespread lodging--the ina-
 bility  of grain to stand up
 during the ripening period. Usu-
 ally caused by heavy rain and
 wind,  lodging can also result
 from the close planting and
 heavy manuring practices advo-
 cated by Peiping.   A more ration-
 al application of these tech-
 niques is being urged.
 Anxiety over peasant reac-
 tion to extravagant farm goals
 may lie behind the strictures
 in a recent edition of the
 theoretical journal Red Flag
 against targets whic1rdev ate
 from reality."  The journal
 cautions that farm goals cannot
 be set by a "handful of men be-
 hind closed doors" but must be
 openly discussed with the farmers
 themselves.   It went on to argue
 the case for setting actual
 targets some 10 to 20 percent
 below feasible levels in order
 to give the peasants a chance
 to "achieve awards and gain sat-
 isfaction."  In addition,  local
 cadres have once again been
 warmed against padding produc-
 tion forecasts "level by level"
 as they are passed upward  to
 Peiping.
 . Peiping continues to give
 broader application to.measures
 designed to increase peasant in-
 centives.   It has recently at-
 tempted to encourage individual
 peasants to raise hogs by pro-
 viding that they can raise hog
 feed on individual plots set aside
 for the purpose and that they be
 ensured of a profit plus a share
 of the pork.   For the past month
 or more, the Chinese press has
 abounded with articles designed
 to "motivate the masses" to a
 speedy and careful harvest of
 early crops, in an effort to
 avoid last fall's losses.   These
 articles have also emphasized the
 need to transfer the state's in-
 creasing share off the commune
 as quickly as possible.
 Peiping's anxiety is heightened
 by a very tight food situation
 in both city and countryside.
 Shortages in large cities have
 been described as "grim," with
 evidence of malnutrition noted.
 A growing black market in food
 is reported from Shanghai, and
 retail prices of food are said
 to be on the rise in Peiping.
 As to rural areas, rations have
 been reduced on some communes
 in  Central  China,   and  the
 inadequacy  of  the   diet  in
 ,convmunal  mess     halls  in
 South  China  has    been widely
 reported.   The  situation
 has  not    gotten  out    of

 insisting   that   strict con-
 servation                                                                    of  food  must  con-

 CHINESE COMMUNISTS ATTEMPTING TO STEM REFUGEE FLOW
 The continuing flight of
 refugees from the mainland is
 leading to greater Chinese Com-
 munist efforts to intercept them
 and has already resulted in
 minor incursions into the ter-
 ritory of neighboring countries.
 There have been no clashes with
 non-Communist troops, however.
 Peiping probably is motivated
 by a desire to put an end to
 refugees' stories of dissatis-
 faction with communes and other
 difficult conditions, including
 food shortages.
 Two reported border cross-
 ings into Burma last week by
 Chinese patrols were probably
 in pursuit of refugees from
 Yunnan Province.   The movement
 of people from China into Burma
 increased sharply last fall
 with the attempted establish-
 ment of communes among border
 peoples--a program which re-
 portedly has been postponed in-
 definitely in western Yunnan.
 Agreements were made with Bur-
 mese border authorities at that
 time to allow only those hold-
 ing permits to cross the border.
 For the past seven years the
 Chinese had permitted the migra-
 tion of border peoples, and in
 some cases even provided emigres
 with forged Burmese documents
 to prevent their arrest in Burma.
 Chinese Communists patrols
 also entered Laotian territory
 on several occasions in April
 in search of refugees and Chi-

 fishing junks.   The Portuguese
 authorities, aware that the en-
 clave continues to exist only
 on Communist sufferance, have
 not protested such Communist
 activity.
 The Chinese Communists had
 previously not hindered the flow
 of refugees into Hong Kong and
 had rejected or ignored British
 requests that border crossings
 be controlled.   Last month, how-
 ever, a Chinese Communist tug-
 boat intruded nine miles into
 British waters around Hong Kong
 and seized two fishing junks
 which had sought refuge from
 the, mainland.  The occupants of
 the junks swam ashore at the ap-
 proach of the Chinese vessel.
 The British have not yet pro-
 tested the incident, stating
 they want first to ascertain
 all legal points.   Their hesi-
 tancy probably arises from a
 continuing desire to avoid a
 showdown  over  enforcement Of
 China's: :unilaterally  declared
 12-mile  territorial-waters
 limit  in  the  Hong. Kong
 area.
 Talks at Geneva between
 representatives of the Japanese
 and North Korean Red Cross So-
 cieties on repatriation of Ko-
 rean residents of Japan to North
 Korea are drawing to a close
 and are likely to end in com-
 promise, according to the chief
 of the International Committee
 for the Red Cross (ICRC)e   For-
 mal agreement has not been
 reached and depends on further
 negotiations.
 The talks began on 13 April
 and dragged on for several weeks,
 largely because of Pyongyang's
 opposition to Japanese proposals
 for participation of the ICRC
 in the repatriation process.
 Failure of the two sides to
 reach common ground resulted in
 a recess of nearly two weeks
 beginning 8 May.   When the North
 Koreans rejected a so-called
 "final" Japanese plan on 20 May,
 it appeared that the negotia-
 tions might be broken off.
 After private discussions
 between leaders of the Japanese
 and North Korean delegations,
 the Japanese Government decided
 on a modified proposal in which
 Tokyo retreated from its earlier
 insistence that the ICRC partic-
 ipate'directly.  The new pro-
 posal, presented on 1 June, per-
 mits the ICRC to advise on the
 organization and operation of
 a repatriation system and ensure
 that the system operates "Just-
 ly, properly, and impartially."
 One reason for North Korea's
 intransigence in the talks may
 have been a desire to exploit
 the Japanese political situation
 to gain concessions from Tokyo.
 The Japanese Government has been
 under considerable domestic
 pressure to make arrangements
 to repatriate those of Japan's
 600?000 Korean residents who
 wish to return home, and Prime
 Minister Kishi's Liberal Demo-4
 cratic party would have profited
 from any progress shown at Ge-
 nevao   Indications of a less
 negative response to Tokyo's
 latest plan by the North Korean
 delegation came as elections to
 the upper house of Japan's Diet
 were already under way.

 Tokyo.     Such action by Seoul
 probably would be accompanied
 by a renewal of threats to use
 force if necessary to block any
 attempt to repatriate  Koreans
 to North Korea.   Ambassador
 Dowling in Seoul has commented
 that, should actual repatria-
 tion begin, the Rhee government
 might resort to drastic action
 no matter how ill-advised such
 action might be.
 An agreement to repatriate
 Koreans from Japan to North Ko-
 rea would enhance Pyongyang's
 international status.   Such
 an agreement would further ad-
 vance North Korean interests
 by complicating the already
 badly strained  relations be-

 and Eby diminishing Seoul's

 to balance  these  factors
 against  its  desire  to  get

 COMMUNIST PROSPECTS UNDER THE LEFTIST SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT
 Pro-Communists can be ex-
 pected to take full advantage
 of the greatly improved climate
 for subversive activities in
 Singapore following the land-
 slide victory of the left-wing
 :People's Action party (PAP) in
 the 30 May general elections.
 The Communist-infiltrated PAP
 will dominate the legislative
 assembly, where it holds 43 of
 51 seats.   The constitution
 which created the new partially
 self-governing State of Singa-
 pore was promulgated on 2 June.
 The British retain control of
 external affairs and defense and
 a voice in internal security.
 The new governing party al-
 most certainly will not invoke
 Singapore's antisubversion laws
 in the stringent manner of the
 former government.   As a result,
 there is likely to be a marked
 increase in Communist influence
 on the island, especially in such
 highly susceptible groups as labor
 unions ' and in the Chinese- schools.
 Communist prospects may
 also be enhanced by a decline
 in British prestige and ability
 to control subversion.   The
 successful PAP demand that the
 British release from jail eight
 pro-Communist PAP leaders on
 threat of refusing to form a
 gove=rnment has already cast
 doubts on British ability to
 counter future PAP moves.
 Release of the extremist
 PAP leaders, several of whom
 enjoy great personal popularity,
 will improve Communist chances
 for a dominant position in the
 party and, through it, the gov-
 ernment.   Meanwhile,  it is doubt-
 ful if the PAP "moderates" can
 successfully prevent infiltra-
 tion of all levels of government
 by the estimated 50 percent of
 the active workers in the party
 who are are pro-Communist.
 The British have built a
 number of antisubversion safe-
 guards into the new constitution.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 past two weeks, he has also
 sent formal letters to the USSR,
 Britain, India, Communist China,
 and France, protesting the ar-
 rest of NLHZ leaders and the
 action taken against the rebel-
 lious battalion,  All of Dong's
 notes have'characterized Vien-
 tiane's moves as violations of
 the 1954 Geneva agreements con-
 stituting a serious menace to
 peace in Indochina, and they
 demand the immediate recall of
 the Laotian International Con-
 trol Commission (ace).
 The Communist bloc consid-
 ers that the return of the ICC
 would serve to limit US efforts
 to strengthen Laos' internal
 security capability while pro-
 viding the domestic Communists
 with a degree of protection from
 possible government repression.
 The recently achieved US-French
 agreement on joint training of
 the Laotian Army would probably
 have to  be reviewed if the ICC
 were to return.
 Peiping has followed up
 Chinese Communist Foreign Min-
 ister Chen Yi's 25 May letter
 to the cochairmen with a spate
 of ;propaganda.   The People's
 Daily on 3 June warned tffat any
 acT on in violation of the Geneva
 agreements would "threaten the
 security of China."
 Neither  Peiping  nor Hanoi
 has   threatened  military  ac-
 tion  to aid the  dissident
 battalion,   but  may now  find
 it advantageous to  imply  that
 such action might be  taken.
 Hanoi  has announced that its
 border  units  have  been  warned
 to  be  on   the  alert against
 any  "provocations,"
 The refusal of the Constit-
 uent Assembly in three separate
 votes to approve President Su-
 karno's demand for a return to
 the 1945 constitution  has
 created a political stalemate
 in Indonesia.   The 1945 consti-
 tution, which would increase
 executive authority at the ex-
 pense of Parliament and politi-
 cal parties, is a facet of Su-
 karno's concept of "guided demo-
 cracy" in which the army would
 also gain increased political
 power.
 Rejection of the constitu-
 tion resulted from the stand of
 the Moslem parties that the 1945
 document does not provide suf-
 ficilent guarantees to the Is-
 lamic religion.   By demanding
 an amendment to this effect,
 which Sukarno is unwilling to
 -rant, they succeeded in pre-
 venting the necessary two-thirds
 vote to adopt the constitution.
 Wholehearted support for Su-
 karrio's position came, paradoxi-
 cally, only from the Communist
 party, which apparently is de-
 termined to avoid alienating
 the President.
 The initiative for breaking
 the present deadlock now rests
 with the army and Sukarno

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Furthermore, in
 addressing the Constituent As-
 sembly on 27 May prior to the
 voting, Premier Djuanda warned
 that failure to approve the
 constitution might precipitate
 "undesirable events" similar
 to those in neighboring coun-
 tries--apparently referring to
 a possible army coup.
 Following the assembly's re-
 jection of the constitution and
 its decision to recess indefinite-
 ly as of 3 June,  Army Chief Na-
 sution on 2 June banned all po-
 litical activity throughout In-
 donesia, in what could be a pre-
 liminary step to an army take-
 over.   Nasution, however, may
 have imposed the ban to avoid
 political disruptions during a
 period of critical decisions.
 Since he is believed unlikely to
 act without approval of Sukarno
 and Djuanda, a solution within a
 legal framework will probably
 be sought.  Attempts  by Pre-
 mier Dj uanda to reach a compro-
 mise with the Moslem parties may
 also continue.
 Prime Minister Koirala's
 new government, which took of-
 fice in Katmandu on 27 May,
 controls an absolute majority
 in parliament and may, for the
 time being at least, create a
 relatively stable situation in
 Nepal.   Koirala has stated his

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 in late June.       In the immediate
 future, parliament is expected
 to support his policies.   How-
 ever, dissension within Koirala's
 own party and machinations by
 King Mahendra or by opposition
 leaders may eventually reduce
 the government's effectiveness.
 The King
 may seex to un er-
 m ne- him i                   Koirala's domination
 of parliament appears to threaten
 the royal paramountcy.
 Koirala has welcomed the
 agreement--signed by the pre-
 vious government--for establish-
 ment of a Soviet Embassy in
 Katmandu and has indicated that
 the United States is also wel-
 come.
 The USSR has promised to
 construct a hydroelectric plant,
 a hospital, and two factories.
 and.. to survey 'for a road.
 There is also US aid for
 projects in agriculture, mining,
 health, education, and village
 development and a new agreement
 on aviation.   In addition to
 supplying five planes to Nepal,
 the United States will provide
 equipment for nine airfields,
 including one at Mustang on the
 Tibetan border.   This last may
 become a target for Chinese
 Communist propaganda regarding
 "American air bases" in the
 Himalayan area.
 Koirala has remarked that
 Nepal's friendship with India
 has become closer and that re-
 lations with Communist China
 will be unimpaired.   Peiping
 has the treaty  right to open
 a consulate general in Katmandu,
 and the Chinese ambassador, who
 resides in New Delhi, may have
 broached the subject of opening
 a resident mission when he had
 an audience with the King in
 Katmandu on 1 June.   Katmandu
 says  it has no  Tibetan refugee
 or border problems and probably
 would comply with any Chinese
 request to establish such a
 mission.
 Koirala, however, has been
 supported by India in his polit-
 ical.                                                             campaigning, and he might
 try to balance any increased
 Chinese influence by expanding
 Katmandu's ties with New Delhi.
 Nehru is to visit Katmandu from
 11 to 15 June and probably will
 caution the Nepalese not to
 expand their international re-.
 lations too rapidly.
 ISRAELI SHIPPING THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL
 Since the 1956 Sinai cam-
 paign,  Israel has partially cir-
 cumvented Cairo's restrictions
 on Israeli shipping through the
 Suez Canal by chartering 39
 foreign-flag ships to carry its
 cargoes.   No Israeli-flag ship
 has attempted to transit the
 canal since 1954 when the Bat
 Galim was seized and confis-
 cated and its captain and crew
 imprisoned for three months.
 Earlier this year, however,
 cargoes from two Israeli-chartered
 ships were seized,  and the
 Danish Inge Toft now is being
 detained, preparatory to possible
 confiscation of its cargo.
 This latest incident oc-
 -curred despite UAR assurances
 to UN officials in the last two
 months that Israeli.ships'should  be
 permitted to transit the canal
 if their cargoes did not "en-
 danger the canal's security"
 and if the shipping manifests
 showed the cargoes were not
 Israeli owned.   Israeli advance

 LIBERIA INCREASING ROLE IN AFRICAN NATIONALISM
 Liberia's President Tub-
 man appears determined to as-
 sociate his country more close-
 ly with the militant African
 nationalism of Prime Minister
 Nkrumah of Ghana and President
 Tourd of Guinea.   Although
 Tubman was recently re-elected
 over only token opposition to
 another four-year term, he now
 apparently feels he must make
 a major effort to remove the
 stigma of "black agents of the
 imperialists" which other
 Africans widely apply to the
 ruling Americo-Liberian  Oli-
 garchy.
 Tubman is also aware of
 the growing strength of the
 younger elements within the
 ruling party who demand Libe-
 ria's closer identification with
 Africa and a more dynamic gov-
 ernmental policy to counteract
 Ghana's increasing prestige.
 Furthermore, officials in Mon-
 rovia may be concerned about
 the danger of ' antiregime activities
 in the tribal hinterland organ-
 ized-by Guinean elements across
 the poorly policed frontier.
 The new policy line has re-
 cently  been reflected most strik-
 ingly in Tubman's agreement to
 permit nine independent African
 states to hold a conference on
 Algeria in Monrovia  in August.
 At this gathering, which is cer-
 tain to annoy France, Liberia
 may go along with a forthright
 statement of support for the
 Algerian rebels.   It will

 extremist nationalist leaders
 from Cameroun have recently
 been accorded warm receptions
 in Monrovia.   Tubman is re-
 portedly planning an early
 public statement, similar to
 that by Nkrumah and Toure,
 endorsing the Cameroun extrem-
 ists' demand for UN-supervised
 legislative elections before
 their country receives its in-
 dependence, now scheduled for
 1 January 1960.
 Plans appear well advanced
 for Tubman, Nkrumah, and Tourg'
 to meet in Liberia in July, pre-
 sumably in an attempt to recon-
 cile conflicting proposals for
 associating the independent
 African states more closely.
 Tubman had earlier proposed an
 "Associated States of Africa"
 which would involve a coordina-
 tion of nonpolitical activities
 among the independent countries.
 Ghana and Guinea in their rather
 vague declaration of 1 May en-
 visaged a "Union of Independent
 African States" with stronger
 government ties including a union
 bank,, common flag and defense
 policy, and single citizenship.
 Tubman apparently hopes
 this meeting will result in a
 general  policy agreement among
 the three leaders and pave

 AFTERMATH OF ALGERIAN ELECTIONS
 Victories by leading mod-
 erates in Algeria's 31 May elec-
 tions for the French Senate
 threaten the political dominance
 of Algeria's European extrem-
 ists for the first time since
 De Gaulle's assumption of pow-
 er.   Only in the city of Al-
 giers, long a stronghold of
 sentiment for integration with
 France, did extremist senti-
 ment dominate the balloting.
 The elections appear to
 be a victory for De Gaulle, who
 has long sought the emergence
 of valid spokesmen for Algerian
 Moslems as a counterpoise to
 the rebel National Liberation
 Front (FLN) and the extremists.
 Although the elections were in-
 direct, with 6,067 "grand elec-
 tors" choosing 32 senators,
 Moslem participation was  as-
 sured by stipulations that two
 thirds of the electors and 20
 of the senators were to be Mos-
 lems.   The elections were nota-
 ble for the extent to which
 Moslems were willing to partici-
 pate in French-sponsored elec-
 tions in the face of possible
 rebel terrorism.

 CURRENT,-INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The emergence of any Mos-
 lem "third force" in Algeria
 would be a threat to both the
 rebels and the European extrem-
 ists.                   A recent increase in in-
 stances of rebel terrorism may
 in part reflect concern among
 the rebels over the possibility
 that they are losing the sup-
 port of uncommitted Moslems.
 Among the European settlers,
 the elections may presage the
 further isolation of those ex-
 tremists who seek to perpetuate
 their privileged economic and
 political position in Algeria.
 The alliance between the extrem-
 ists and the French Army, which
 in 1958 brought about the down-
 fall of the Fourth Republic,
 has degenerated, and there now
 is little coordination between
 the army and the faction-ridden
 "committees of public safety."
 The settlers remain a political-
 ly powerful force, but they suf-
 fered in the senatorial elections
 from having boycotted previous
 balloting for the "grand electors."!
 With the election results
 in mind, the Algerian bloc in
 the French National Assembly may
 further modify its program.
 Following De Gaulle's public re-
 fusal to be pushed into espous-
 ing "integration," it has changed
 its demands for the "integration"
 of Algeria with France to "unifi-
 cation."
 De Gaulle's willingness to
 move ahead with politico-economic
 measures for Algeria was reflect-
 ed in the introduction in the
 assembly of a bill which provides
 the inclusion in the French
 budget of the heretofore separate
 Algerian budget and the exten-
 sion of French currency to Al-
 geria.   Such moves toward "eco-
 nomic  integration"  may be
 designed  in  part  to reassure
 Algeria's European settlers
 and  the  army  that  a  nego-     25X1
 tiated settlement   of   the
 war  would  not  mean  Fr nce's
 abandonment  of  Algeria,

 THE US VISIT OF THE.THREE "EUROPEAN .PRESIDENTS"
 The official visit to Wash-
 ington from 9 to 11 June of the
 presidents of the European Eco-
 nomic Community (EEC), the Coal-
 Steel Community (CSC), and EUR-
 ATOM comes at a time of growing
 concern over the future institu-
 tional development of the Euro-
 pean Community movement.
 Stronger by treaty than
 either the EURATOM or Common
 Market (EEC) commissions, the
 CSC High Authority is in an es-
 pecially difficult position.
 President Finet and his  col-
 leagues have been in a caretaker
 status since their appointments
 expired last February, and de-
 spite pleas for action, the mem-
 ber governments have declined
 thus far either to reappoint the
 present incumbents or to agree
 on replacements.   Coinciding
 with the sharp rebuff given by
 representatives of member coun-
 tries to the High Authority last
 month on its handling of the
 coal crisis, this delay has con-
 vinced some observers that anti-
 European elements, particularly
 in France and West Germany, want
 permanently to impair the High
 Authority's influences
 The EURATOM and  Common
 Market commissions.  are in  a
 somewhat better position, but
 their relations with the national
 governments--represented by the
 two Councils of Ministers--have
 been delicate.  The councils,
 for example, have rapidly expanded
 the staffs of permanent national
 representatives in Brussels--
 staffs which potentially compete
 with the commissions in the con-
 duct of Community affairs.
 This  reluctance to see
 supranational institutions mature
 rapidly is probably also a factor
 in the long deadlock over the
 site of the "European capital."
 The EURATOM and Common Market
 commissions are de facto in
 Brussels, the CSC High Authority
 remains in Luxembourg, and all
 of them are physically separated
 from their potentially strongest
 source of support--the European
 Parliamentary  Assembly  in
 S3trasbourg
 The three presidents prob-
 ably hope that their Washington
 visit will not only assist them
 in coping with opposition from
 European government representa-
 tives, but also increase Ameri-
 can interest in the European Com-
 raunity's potential as a free-
 world "partner."  President

 STATE OF SIEGE REIMPOSED :[N PARAGUAY
 Paraguayan President
 Stroessner's political posi-
 t{on is increasingly delicate.
 His anxiety is reflected in
 his ordering the arrest of some
 40 leaders of the ruling Colo-
 rado party and in his dissolu-
 tion of Congress, which con-
 sists exclusively of Colorado
 members.   Along with the state
 of siege, reimposed for 60 days
 on 30 May after several student
 disturbances, these moves seem
 a panicky reaction to increas-
 ing antidictator pressures both
 within Paraguay and in Latin
 America generally.
 The strongest pressure on
 Stroessner has been recent criti-
 cism by dissident Colorado lead-
 ers, including those arrested,
 who urge speedier and fuller
 political reform.   Affirming
 that the country was facing one
 of its worst crises, these lead-
 ers in mid-March had recommended
 various measures, including a
 full amnesty and consultation
 with opposition leaders on the
 best way to attain "institutional
 normalcy" most rapidly.   Since
 they wanted the Colorado party
 and their own group to get the
 credit for such steps, these
 leaders resented Stroessner's
 lifting on 28 April of the 12-
 year state of siege by presi-
 dential decree, rather than
 through Congress.
 Other Colorado circles,
 including part of the military,
 have favored more caution in
 altering Paraguay's traditional
 one-party rule, seeing a threat
 to their special privileges as

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 INFLUENCE ON DE GAULLE'S DECISIONS
 Concentration of the de-
 cision-making power in France
 in the hands of the president
 has created opportunities for
 individuals on De Gaulle's per-
 sonal staff and the staffs. of
 some cabinet members to distort
 information on which he bases
 major policy decisions and to
 misrepresent decisions he has
 made.   Most of these individuals
 seem to be aggressive, ambitious
 men identified with the French
 Resistance in World War II. Per-
 sonal rivalries and De Gaulle's
 habit of ranging far afield for
 information somewhat limit their
 power, but their influence ap-
 pears to be growing and at criti-
 cal moments could seriously
 circumvent the President's con-
 trol over major policies--particu-
 larly in foreign affairs.
 Policy decisions in the
 Fourth Republic were primarily
 the product of political com-
 promises in the National Assem-
 bly, which determined what ma-
 jor decisions a government could
 take without the risk of over-
 throw.   Under 'the Fifth Republic,
 parliament's role has been min-
 imal, and decisions of profound
 significance have been made by
 De Gaulle personally.   Shifting
 decision-making from the 500-
 plus deputies to one man has not
 only changed the process, but
 has also sharply focused the
 target for those who would manip-
 ulate policy.
 This situation has opened
 quasilegal portals of power to
 the personal staffs of the Presi-
 dent, the premier, and the other
 cabinet ministers.   These staffs
 prepare basic policy reports,
 collect and present dossiers on
 current matters, and transmit
 instructions from the President
 and government to the adminis-
 trative machinery of the state,
 which executes the decisions as
 transmitted,   This layer of the
 bureaucracy was important under
 the Fourth Republic also, but
 then had to share its influence
 on policy decisions with parlia-
 ment, the army, and the labor
 unions.
 De Gaulle's Aloofness
 Confusion in procedures for
 taking decisions was to be expect-
 ed in the early stages of the
 new regime, and particularly un-
 der the ambiguous provisions of
 the new constitution, which di-
 vides the executive power. This
 confusion is compounded, however,
 by De Gaulle's deliberate self-
 restraint--in accordance with
 his view of himself as primarily
 an arbiter--in trying to avoid
 imposing his personal views to
 settle intramural disputes ex-
 cept where broad'policy princi-
 ples are involved.
 An example concerned Finance
 Minister Pinay's threat to resign
 unless he received exclusive
 jurisdiction over all financial
 matters and the counterclaims of
 Minister of State Lecourt and
 Community Secretary General Janot
 to control. of financial affairs
 of the new French Community. This
 dispute was never decisively  ,set-
 tled" by De Gaulle, and Pinay was
 induced to remain only after a
 loose modus vivendi gradually
 came about.   Moreover, De Gaulle
 has also avoided--from personal
 preference as well as because
 he recognizes expert competence--
 interference in ministries or
 other government agencies pri-
 marily concerned with technical
 matters.
 De Gaulle's aloofness and
 refusal to become embroiled in
 what he regards as "petty de-
 tails" of policy give conscientious
 staff personnel the opportunity
 to expedite important matters,
 but other actions of less scrupu-
 lous "staff men" have come to

 set up at the same time, may
 also have a role in formulat-
 ing solutions for these problems.
 The USSR can, over the next
 seven years, make impressive im-
 provements in the average level
 of its industrial technology by
 the broadened exploitation of
 many generally known techniques
 as well as by pioneering advances.
 The extent of the opportunity
 to advance is indicated by the
 fact that the capital investment
 plan for 1959-65 envisages total
 "productive investment" about
 twice that of the preceding
 seven years.
 Status of Industrial Technology
 Soviet industry has demon-
 strated a capability to incor-
 porate advanced techniques into
 the rapidly expanding industrial
 base of the USSR.  In many areas
 of heavy industry, which histor-
 ically has been accorded the
 highest priority, technological
 practices have been introduced
 which are on a par with the best
 in the West. In some cases, as
 in blast furnaces, petroleum ex-
 traction, machine building, and
 prestressed concrete, the Soviet
 Union has made notable pioneering
 adaptations and developments.
 On the other hand, the food-
 processing, textile, and other
 light industries are far behind.
 Certain types of transport, civ-
 il telecommunications, and some
 aspects of construction have
 been accorded only grudging at-
 tention, and many technological
 practices in these areas are
 similar to those used in the
 West some 25 years ago.
 The unevenness which occurs
 within as well as between indus-
 tries is primarily the product
 of political and economic deci-
 sions  and of historical circum-
 stance in the USSR, rather than
 of significant technological
 failure.   Soviet technological
 development started from a small
 base compared with the West. It
 has been and is conditioned by
 different scarcity relationships
 and industrial requirements, it
 is directed toward different
 political objectives, and its
 progress is gauged in accordance
 with a different rationale and
 a different scale of values.
 Central directives emphasize
 increased physical output rather
 than increased quality. For ex-
 ample, technological advances
 in the iron and steel industry
 have been concentrated largely
 in the blast furnace and the
 open hearth because of the com-
 manding demand to maximize steel
 output rather than to improve
 the quality or diversity of prod-
 ucts.   As a result the Soviet
 Union has established a new
 world standard for efficient
 blast-furnace operation; however,
 certain problems in mining, ore
 preparation and rolling-mill
 and finishing technologies have
 not been accorded equivalent
 priority.
 These directives tend to
 discourage the introduction of
 new technology because of the
 likelihood of distuptions, which
 would jeopardize output goals.
 Furthermore, they inspire a con-
 servatism in plant management
 which results in a considerable
 lag between development and
 practical application.   For ex-
 ample, an automatic line for
 producing wheel rims had not
 been installed in one automotive
 plant in 1958, although it had
 been in storage at the plant for
 a year.  At the same plant an
 automatic line for stamping
 wheel discs had been left un-
 touched for two years.
 Another important factor
 affecting industrial technology
 is the Soviet policy with respect
 to obsolescence.   The great
 emphasis on expanding current
 output has tended to foster re-
 tention of existing capacity and
 has kept older, technologically
 less advanced plants in opera-
 tion much longer than is the case
 in the West.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 June 1959
 Both in the West and in the
 USSR, no clear distinction can
 be made between the terms "mech-
 anization" and "automation."
 Generally speaking, however,
 mechanization refers to replac-
 ing human labor with machinery,
 and automation to replacing
 human control with mechanical
 or electronic devices.
 Soviet progress in develop-
 ing automatic control systems
 is more readily discernible in
 military than in industrial ap-
 plications.   The USSR lags be-
 hind the United States in the
 range and extent to which de-
 velopments in automation are
 applied to industrial practice,
 but when applied, Soviet tech-
 nology is not inferior to that
 in the United States.
 Substantial advances have
 been made in research and de-
 velopment involving servomech-
 anisms and electronic and com-
 munication instruments, as well
 as devices capable of perform-
 ing a sequence of logical, self-
 correcting operations.   In his
 theses on the Seven-Year Plan,
 however, Khrushchev criticized
 the lag in industrial applica-
 tion of Soviet research achieve-
 ments in automation.   He also
 admitted that a lag exists in
 implementing mechanization when
 he derided the low level of So-
 viet industrial mechanization
 and pointed to the fact that
 manual labor represents up to
 50 percent of the entire working
 time of the Soviet machine-build-
 ing industry.
 The most highly automated
 sectors of the Soviet industrial
 economy are the electric-power
 and ferrous-metallurgical indus-
 tries.           Even in these industries,
 applications of automation have
 been more widely applied to some
 processes  than to others.   For
 example, automation in steel
 manufacturing has made a signif-
 icant    contribution to the
 iron-and-steel-making process,
 in contrast to the rolling and
 other finishing processes.
 In other industrial sectors,
 such as the chemical and petroleum
 refining industries, the USSR
 has made only relatively minor
 advances in applying modern tech-
 niques of automation and mech-
 anization.   While these Soviet
 industries have been making ef-
 fective use of simple automatic.
 control instruments, in the
 United States several chemical
 and petroleum companies have an-
 nounced that in 1959 they will
 achieve truly automated plants,
 i.e., the entire manufacturing
 process will be fully controlled
 by a computer-based, closed-loop
 scheme of automation.
 In the machine-building
 sector, the USSR lags far behind
 the United States in the range
 and extent of industrial applica-
 tion of automation and mechaniza-
 tion.                                                       The greatest number of
 such Soviet automatic and semi-
 automatic lines are installed in
 the plants of the  automotive
 and associated industries such
 as piston, engine-block, and
 bearing factories.   The USSR
 has pioneered in three areas:
 an automatic piston factory,
 an automatic bearing line, and
 an automatic gear-making line.
 The significance of each
 of these automated endeavors is
 not only that they produce prod-
 ucts automatically, but also
 they serve as laboratories in
 which the USSR is developing
 the fundamentals necessary for
 a systematic approach to build-
 ing future automatic lines. Dur-
 ing the period of the Seven-Year
 Plan. (1959-65), a total of 50
 additional experimental plants
 are to be build to cover every
 sector of the Soviet industrial
 economy.
 Electronic Computers

 successful in developing the
 production of analogue computers
 than digital computers. At least

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ten different types of analogue
 computers were reported to be
 in serial production in early
 1958.
 The USSR has encountered
 serious difficulties in produc-
 ing electronic digital computers
 in quantity, particularly in the
 case of the high-speed and very-
 high-speed types.  Their use in
 the USSR has been confined main-
 ly to large scientific and de-
 sign establishments.   Produc-
 tion has not been adequate to
 permit their application to prob-
 lems of industrial automation
 and business data handling.
 Responsibility for the cur-
 rent lag in production of digital
 computers and other instrumenta-
 tion for automatic control of
 production processes has been
 placed squarely on the elec-
 tronics industry.  According to
 1958 Soviet reports, automa-
 mation in the USSR is being
 "greatly impeded" by failure of
 the electronics industry to
 achieve "mass production of
 standarized miniaturized compon-
 ents, standardized elements and
 subassemblies, and especially
 semiconductor devices."
 In one report a specific
 example was cited in the devel-
 opment of the small M-3 digi-
 tal computer.  This machine, de-
 signed in 1954, was not yet in
 commercial-scale production by
 the middle of 1958.  Also Aca-
 demician Blagonravov, a promi-
 nent scientist, has charged that
 the length of time between de-
 sign  and industrial production
 of instrumentation in the USSR
 is "inadmissibly long--four to
 seven years, as against one
 to  two  Years  in  the  United
 States."                   (Pre-         25X1

 by OSI)
 AFGHANISTAN'S USE OF THE $100,000,000 SOVIET CREDIT
 Several large Afghan de-
 velopment projects under the
 Soviet    $100,000,000 line of
 credit granted in early 1956
 have entered the construction
 stage, resulting in an increase
 in obligated  funds from about
 $12,000,000 in 1957 to possibly
 $71,000,000.  Several of the
 projects originally planned un-
 der this credit, however, re-
 main indefinitely suspended.
 Emphasis on transportation de-
 velopment continues, but more
 attention is being given hydro-
 electric and irrigation dam
 projects.  The projects under
 construction are located in
 northeast Afghanistan, along
 the main transportation artery
 connecting the Soviet border
 with the Khyber Pass.
 Soviet bloc credits out-
 side the $100,000,000 loan, in-
 cluding $32,391,000 for arms
 aid and $15,000,000 for oil ex-
 ploration,   probably                                                                  totaled
 about $59,000,000 by the early
 spring of 1959.   In May, how-
 ever,   Afghanistan                                                                   and  the
 USSR concluded a new economic
 cooperation  agreement  which
 provides  for  the  construc-
 tion  of                                                             a  470-mile  road
 from the  Soviet  border   to
 Kandahar.
 Progress Since 1957
 Construction was completed
 in 1.958 on three relatively
 small Soviet projects under the
 $100,000,000  credit.  These
 were the oil storage depots at
 Qizil Qala, Pul-i-Khumri, and
 Pul-i-Matek, which were already
 under construction at the be-
 ginning of the 1957 summer build-
 ing season.

 struction of improvement of the
 Herat-Kandahar road, the west-
 ern artery leading from the So-
 viet border to Pakistan.   This
 project may be financed by a
 new credit rather than under
 the $100,000,000 loan.
 Dam Projects Started
 The Afghans are using part
 of the $100,000,000 credit for
 dam projects to expand their hy-
 droelectric power capacity and
 to provide additional irrigation
 waters to increase agricultural
 production.
 On 30 December 1957, Kabul
 approved a construction agree-
 ment for a dam near Jalalabad.
 This dam is part of an irriga-
 tion project which may use as
 much as $23;000,000 of the cred-
 it.   The Afghan Government may
 feel such an expensive project
 in this region is desirable for
 prestige reasons.   Jalalabad
 lies near troublesome Pushtu
 tribal areas, and the Pakistani
 Government, which competes for
 prestige among these tribes,is
 building an even more ambitious
 dam at Warsak, across the border.
 Kabul also approved agree-,
 ments in 1958 for construction
 of the hydroelectric projects
 at Naghlu and Pul-i-Khumri.
 The Naghlu project, however,may
 be subject to further price ne-
 otiations, since the USSR has
 apparently raised its cost esti-
 mates and now anticipates that
 over $12,000,000 in scarce Afghan
 domestic currency will be required.
 Increased construction ac-
 tivity on projects under the
 $100,000,000 credit has led to
 an influx of Soviet nationals:.
 An estimated 800 bloc technicians
 may be working on development
 projects in Afghanistan, prob-
 ably mainly in Kabul, Bagram,
 the Salang Pass region, and in
 the oil exploration area west
 of Nazar-i-Sharif, where work
 is being carried out under the
 separate $15,000,000 oil ex-
 ploration agreement.
 The Afghan Government, how-
 ever, is sensitive about politi-
 cal activity by foreign techni-
 cians and limits Afghan con-
 tacts with foreigners.   Bloc
 technicians apparently observe
 Kabul's strictures  in this
 matter.
 Utilization of Funds
 Afghan Foreign Minister
 Nairn indicated in December 1957
 that his country would use all
 of the Soviet $100,000,000 cred-
 it.                                                             It seems likely that the
 entire amount will be obligated
 by 1964, when the Afghan Govern-
 ment must begin repayment over
 a period of 22 years.   The re-
 maining funds available under
 this credit, however, may be
 spent on new projects rather
 on those which now appear to be
 indefinitely suspended.
 The Afghans will probably
 continue to proceed cautiously
 because of shortages of Afghan
 domestic funds required by for-
 eign-assisted projects'and be-
 cause of shortages of Afghan
 technical and administrative per-
 sonnel, The USSR--presumably'to,
 overcome this caution--has  of-
 f ered free surveys for projects and
 free consumer goods to sell on the Af-
 ghan market to generate needed local
 fundLs'. For. the. same purpose,. it has
 made a gift of 40,000 tons of

 MAO TSE-TUNG'S ARRANGEMENTS FOR A SUCCESSOR
 Mao Tse-tung has taken a
 number of steps since 1956 to
 prepare the Chinese Communist
 party and the Chinese people
 for his eventual replacement
 as party chairman--perhaps in
 1961--by his favorite lieuten-
 ant,  Liu Shao-chi.   Liu's ap-
 pointment as chairman of the
 government appears to have been
 the latest of these.   Mao's ar-
 rangements seem well calculated
 to provide a smooth transition
 and to encourage the continued
 solidarity of the party leader-
 ship.   There are,  however,  sev-
 eral possible threats to  an
 orderly succession.
 Liu knew Mao when both were
 students in Hunan, but they were
 not close.   After two years in
 the USSR, Liu joined the Chi-
 nese Communist party in 1921
 and thereafter became  known
 chiefly as a labor organizer.
 He was named to the Chinese Com-
 munist party politburo in 1931
 ?--a year earlier than Mao--when
 it was dominated by Comintern-
 sponsored youths.
 In 1932 Liu followed other
 party leaders from Shanghai to
 Mao's "soviet"--a rural base--
 in Kiangsi in South China.   There
 he reportedly stood with Mao
 in opposing the Comintern-spon-
 sored group which, with Chou
 En-lai, continued to dominate
 the party.
 When the Chinese Communists
 were dislodged from their Kiangsi
 base in 1934, Liu joined the
 Long March to the north as a
 political officer.   In January
 1935, at a party conference in
 Tsunyi during the march, Liu
 supported Mao in a winning show-
 down with the Comintern's favor-
 ites--whom Mao accused of bun-
 gling.
 Liu and Chou both supported
 Mao) in another intraparty dis-
 pute in 1935--the question of
 the destination of the Communist
 forces.  After arriving in
 Shensi (Mao's choice),  Liu be-
 came an underground leader against
 the:) Japanese forces then in China.
 He returned to Yenan in Shensi
 in 1937 and, shortly thereafter,
 supported Mao in another winning
 fight--as to what kind of "united
 front" to establish.   He ap-
 parently began at that time to
 specialize in party organiza-
 tional work.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 in 1939,  in writing on the train-
 ing of a party member.   In the
 next four years, while engaged
 in party work in various parts
 of China, Liu published several
 other articles of this kind.
 One of these set forth princi-
 ples for the party's first "rec
 tification" campaign.
 Mao became chairman of
 the central committee in 1943,
 and changes in the politburo
 and secretariat left those
 bodies completely responsive
 to him.   His politburo included
 himself, Liu, Chou, Chu- Te, and
 Chen Yun, of the party's current
 officers.   The secretariat was
 built around Mao, Liu,and Chou.
 Liu's Emergence as Favorite
 Liu emerged as Mao's first
 lieutenant in 1945.   His re-
 port to the party's seventh
 congress was second in impor-
 tance only to Mao's,                   and the
 congress adopted a revised
 party constitution which Liu
 had apparently drafted.   Mao
 was elected chairman of the
 central committee, politburo,
 and secretariat, and Liu was
 re-elected to those bodies be-
 low him.   Chou En-lai and
 others were named below Liu in
 the hierarchy.   Later in the
 year, Liu was acting chairman
 of the party in Mao's absence.
 When the Peiping regime
 was proclaimed in 1949, Mao
 became chairman of the Central
 People's Government, while Chou
 was given the key government
 post of premier.   Liu retained
 the more important role of Mao's
 first lieutenant for party work
 and continued to build his base
 of power in the party machine.
 When the Peiping regime was
 reorganized in 1954, Mao became
 chairman of the People's Repub-
 lie of China and Liu became
 chairman of the body which the-
 oretically supervised the cabi-
 nei..   Chou En-lai was again
 named premier.
 Also in 1954, Liu, presid-
 ing over a central committee

 plenum in Mao's absence, de-
 nounced unnamed party leaders
 for factional activity.   Shortly
 thereafter, Teng Hsiao-ping be-
 came the party's secretary gen-
 eral, working under Mao and Liu
 in supervising the party machine,
 and in 1955 he announced the
 purge of two top party leaders
 --which Liu's denunciation had
 foreshadowed.   From that time
 Teng seemed to be Liu's chief
 aide for party affairs, just as
 Liu was Mao's.
 At the party's eighth con-
 gress in September 1956, Mao
 revealed some preparations for
 his eventual replacement as
 party chairman.   One of these
 was the provision in the revised
 party constitution for the cen-
 tral committee to establish the
 post of "honorary chairman"--
 which would permit Mao to step
 aside during his lifetime.
 Mao in effect designated
 a group to carry on in the event
 of his retirement or death.   The
 congress, re-electing Mao chair-
 man of the central committee
 and politburo, named four of his
 "close comrades" as vice chair-
 men and confirmed the post of
 secretary general.   Mao and
 these five became the politburo
 standing committee--a.small'
 superpolitburo,now numbering
 seven in all, which was to re-
 place the outgoing secretariat
 but would have no chairman.
 At the same time, Mao once
 again made it clear that he fa-
 vored Liu Shao-chi to succeed
 hizu as the party's principal
 figure.   Liu was named first
 among the vice chairmen of the
 central committee and politburo
 and placed immediately below
 Mao on the politburo standing
 committee; Chou En-lai was named
 below Liu.   Even more strikingly,
 Litt was chosen to deliver the
 four-hour "political report" to
 the congress--the equivalent of
 the report Mao had made to the
 1945 congress.
 Liu's close associate Teng
 Hsiao-ping was re-elected secre-
 tary general and named to head
 the) new secretariat, which was
 to administer and coordinate
 the party machine at all levels.
 Teng thus became--and remains--
 the only party leader concurrent-
 ly a member of the politburo,
 standing committee, and secre-
 tariat.   Teng gave the report
 on the party's revised constitu-
 tion--a subject Liu was assigned
 in 1945.
 Liberalization ": and Reversal
 In the period from the
 eighth congress in 1956 to the
 summer of 1957 there were indica-
 tions of possible disagreement
 between Mao and Liu--relating
 chiefly to Mao's experiment with
 "liberalization."  For much of
 this period, Mao was contributing
 to the Soviet Union's troubles
 by encouraging dissident forces
 in Eastern Europe. He was also
 insisting on his "hundred-flowers"
 program at home, coinciding with
 the "ebb tide" in China's eco--
 nomic growth. Liu Shao-chi and
 Teng Hsiao-ping played very
 small public roles in late 1956
 and early 1957; they may have
 believed that some of Mao's
 policies were ill conceived.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The question arose
 as to whether other party lead-
 ers would attempt  to  exploit
 his ill health and his mistakes.
 Liu seemed to  remain  a
 faithful servant, however--one
 content to let Mao step aside
 at a time of his own choosing.
 In June 1957 Mao himself sig-
 naled the change to a very hard
 line in both intrabloc and do-
 mestic affairs.   He  strongly
 reaffirmed orthodox positions,
 justified the  "antirightist
 struggle," and linked the par-
 ty's "rectification" campaign
 with the task of a speedier ad-
 vance in "socialist construc-
 tion."   In July, Mao set forth
 "clear-cut principles" for a na-
 tionwide rectification campaign.
 Thereafter, Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping played the
 major roles in helping Mao re-
 pair the damage,   regain both
 political and economic momen-
 tum, and restore his personal
 prestige.   Teng was chosen to
 state publicly, in September
 1957, the leadership's plans
 for indoctrinating the entire
 populace in basic dogmas. "Par--
 ty-machine" figures--principal-
 ly Liu, Teng, and Teng's deputy
 Tan Chen-lin--took the lead in
 exhorting an "upsurge" in eco-
 nomic growth, which became the
 "great leap forward" of 1958.
 Mao and Teng went to Moscow in
 late 1957 to state the party's
 hard line on intrabloc relations,
 announced simultaneously by Liu
 in Peiping.
 Throughout the winter of
 1957-58 the Chinese press gave
 further touches to the image of
 Liu as Mao's successor.   There
 was much personal publicity for
 Liu which stressed his close as-
 sociation with Mao from the ear-
 liest days of the party, gave
 him some of the credit for the
 party's unswervingly correct
 course under Mao, and made an
 effort to brighten his gray
 and solemn personality.

 19513 provided further evidence

 decided to establish the huge
 "people's communes" as the "basic
 unit" of Chinese society.   Liu
 was firmly identified with this
 program.   In July he told some
 students that Communism in China
 could be realized "very soon"
 --the most extreme claim attrib-
 uted to any Chinese party leader.
 Late in 1958, Mao took an-
 other step toward retirement,
 asking that he not be renominated
 for the largely ceremonial post
 of chairman of the government.
 He said he wanted to conserve
 his time and energy to deal with
 questions of theory and national
 policy.   This was plausible,
 especially in the light of the
 need for further study--and
 theoretical justification--of
 the audacious commune program.
 The central committee ple-
 num which approved Mao's resig-
 nation also retreated some dis-
 tance in the commune campaign--
 modifying both Peiping's claims
 for the program and the practi-
 cal program itself.   This action,
 following the regime's with-
 drawal from the Taiwan Strait
 venture, provoked much specula-
 tion that Mao was being forced
 to step down.   However, the only
 party leaders strong enough to
 press Mao--the "party-machine"
 group--were the very ones most
 closely associated with Mao's
 major policies since mid-1957.
 Mao retained all of his party
 posts, and the December plenum
 emphasized that Mao himself had
 ordered the modification of the
 commune program and that his
 "guidance" would continue.
 The central committee met
 again in April 1959, with Mao
 presiding.   Of several changes
 in the government posts announced
 thereafter, the naming of Liu
 to the government chairmanship
 was the only significant one.
 Chou En-lai was named to another
 .our-year term as premier, and
 Uhou's entire cabinet was re-
 appointed.
 Mao's decision to give the
 rather empty and wearisome gov-
 ernment chairmanship to the al-
 ready burdened Liu surprised
 many observers.   There has been
 speculation that Liu is being
 retired into the job.
 Assuming, however, that
 Liu is not seriously ill, the
 most plausible explanation of
 his appointment is that Mao saw
 it as a necessary step in pre-
 paring the Chinese people--as he
 has been preparing the party
 since 1956--to accept Liu's
 eventual primacy.   That is, in
 becoming accustomed to "Chair-
 man Liu" of the government suc-
 ceeding Mao, the populace will
 be better prepared for "Chair-
 man Liu" of the party succeeding
 Mao.   The Chinese press, by
 distinguishing between Chairman
 Mao "the great leader of the
 Chinese people" on the one hand
 and Chairman Liu and other lead-
 ers of the government on the
 other, continues to underline the
 greater importance of the party
 post and to discourage speculation
 that Liu has already displaced
 Mao.
 Prospects for the Succession
 Any plenum of the central
 committee can establish the post
 of "honorary chairman" and elect
 new officers, but a further sub-
 stantial period of build-up for
 Liu would seem desirable.   Thus,
 assuming that Mao's health re-
 mains passably good, it seems
 likely that Mao will keep the
 party chairmanship at least until
 the party's ninth congress in
 1961, which will coincide with
 the 40th anniversary of the Chi-
 nese Communist party.
 Mao's arrangements seem
 calculated to provide a smooth
 transition in the party leader-
 ship :and'  to  encourage  a

 continuation of the remarkable
 solidarity of that leadership.
 There are, however, several pos-
 sible developments which could
 alter the entire picture.
 One such possibility is
 that Mao will give further thought
 to the "King Lear problem"--the
 problem of securing obedience
 after one has relinquished the
 instruments of power.   Mao may
 recognize that once he has given
 up his party posts and the com-
 position of key party organs
 has changed, he will have no as-
 surance that his wishes will be
 carried out.   Contemplating this
 prospect, he might choose not
 to step aside for anyone.
 Should Mao attempt to re-
 tain the party chairmanship in-
 definitely, Liu, who is already
 61, might gather his "party-
 machine" group and make a fight
 for it.   This possibility would
 increase sharply if an ill and
 arbitrary Mao were to find him-
 self a new favorite whom he re-
 garded as more responsive to
 his will.
 Another disruptive possi-
 bility is that Mao will die be-
 fore the transition is effected.
 In such an event, Liu might be
 challenged by a coalition of
 key figures who have been impor-
 tant not primarily in party work,
 but as senior administrators,
 economic specialists, and mili-
 tary men.   Some of these latter
 figurres seem to have resented
 the :role of the "party-machine"
 group in leading the party's ma-
 jor campaigns of the past two
 years and to have disapproved
 of important features of these
 campaigns.
 Perhaps the most serious
 concern for Liu is the possibil-
 ity that his "party-machine"
 group will prove unstable.   With
 Mao gone, Liu's position would
 seem to depend in particular on
 the supportct.Teng Hsiao-ping,
 whose strength in the party
 machine is already formidable
 and can be expected to grow.
 If an ambitious Teng were to
 join the opposition to Liu, Liu
 might well succumb to such a
 combination.
 In sum, the question of
 Mao's successor is not closed.
 Liu remains, as he has  for
 14 years, the leading candidate
 for the post of party chairman.
 He may have to fight for the job,
 however, and he might not win.
