 SITUATION IN INDONESIA
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The pace of Indonesia's
 18-day anti-Dutch campaign has
 slowed noticeably as practical-
 ly all Dutch-owned interests
 on Java are now in Indonesian
 hands.  The army and moderate
 government elements appear to
 be concerned over the continu-
 ing drift toward economic and
 political chaos, and to be
 groping for ways to redress the
 situation.  Thus far, however,
 no effective leadership, has-
 emerged to coordinate 'these
 groups and direct their activi-
 ties.  For instance, an army
 order to end the seizures of
 Dutch property has been ignored.
 Labor unions have continued
 their seizures--probably to
 test the army--and have not been
 punished as threatened.

 to date are the Communists, who

 CURRENT' INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 President Sukarno is to
 depart for India early in Janu-
 ary; Premier Nehru has stated
 he will be welcome to stay as
 long as he likes.   Sukarno's
 absence from Indonesia, whether
 for medical or political reaT-
 sonp, will provide the army and
 moderate politicians with per-
 haps their last opportunity to
 establish an effective non-Com-
 munist government in Djakarta.
 Civil elements are also
 continuing to maneuver for the
 setting up of a new  regime.
 The Masjumi and National party
 (PNI) are said to be cooperat-
 ing toward this end, and a spe-
 cial parliamentary committee
 which has been working for the
 restoration of the Sukarno-
 Ratta partnership has been or-
 dered to submit a report some-
 time between 15 January and 31
 March, a period which coincides
 with Sukarno's absence.  Hatta
 has made it clear he will not
 return to high public office
 unless he is given commensurate
 authority.   The chief weakness
 in these moves is the fact that
 the military and the politicians
 appear to be competing with
 each other.
 Meanwhile, the confusion
 in Java appears to have stimu-
 lated intensified rebel activi-
 ty in South Celebes.   Mili-
 tary leaders in Central Sumatra
 plan to observe the first anni-
 versary of their declaration of
 autonomy on 20 December.
 ROLE OF SOVIET PARTY SECRETARIAT ENHANCED
 The Soviet party central
 committee plenum held on 16 and
 17 December approved personnel
 changes in the top echelons of
 the party which will probably
 have the effect  of further
 strengthening Khrushchev's posi-
 tion of pre-eminence.   Three
 party presidium members were
 added to the party secretariat
 --the executive organ of the
 party under First Secretary
 Khrushchev.   The officials in-
 volved--Nuritdin Mukhitdinov
 and Aleksey Kirichenko, hereto-
 fore party bosses of Uzbekistan
 and the Ukraine, respectively,
 and Nikolay Ignatov, party
 first secretary of the Gorkiy
 Oblast--will presumably relin-
 quish their provincial posts
 for full-time work in Moscow.
 Mukhitdinov wasnnalso promoted
 from candidate to full member
 of the presidium, apparently
 in order to fill the vacancy
 left by Zhukov's ouster  in
 October.
 As a result of the plenum's
 decision, 10 of the 15 full
 members of the presidium now
 are members of the secretariat,
 which now may replace the pre-
 sidium as the locus of politi-
 cal power in the USSR.   The ef-
 fect of the addition of three
 more presidium members to the
 secretariat will be to break
 down the distinction between
 policy-making, formally a func-
 tion of the presidium, and the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 implementation function, which
 resides in the secretariat.
 Since the secretariat is under
 the acknowledged command of its
 first secretary, Khrushchev,
 the principle of "collective
 leadership" would appear to
 have been further weakened.
 In view of persistent hints
 of stresses and strains within
 the hierarchy, it is possible
 that the changes reflect an un-
 even compromise stemming from
 pressure for a transfusion of
 new blood into the secretariat
 to block Khrushchev from achiev-
 ing one-man control.   If so,
 the effort apparently failed
 since at least two of the three
 new secretaries, Kirichenko
 and Mukhitdinov, are clearly
 Khrushchev proteges. What seems
 more likely is that Khrushchev
 sold the move to the central
 committee on the grounds that
 day-to-day party control from
 the  center  needed  to  be
 strengthened, particularly as
 a follow-up to the decision to
 decentralize economic manage-
 ment.
 Whatever the background,
 the net result would seem to
 be that Khrushchev has profited.
 A situation now might arise in
 which the full members of the
 presidium who are not in the
 secretariat--Bulganin, Mikoyan,
 Shvernik, Kozlov, and Voroshi-
 lov--are gradually excluded
 from participation in the mak-
 ing of major policy.  Khru-
 shchev, for instance, might use
 this tactic against Bulganin
 and Voroshilov, who are said to
 have wavered in their support
 of him during the crisis in
 June.
 At the same time, the dif-
 fusion of responsibility among
 a greater number of secretaries
 decreases the likelihood of
 any one of them obtaining suf-
 ficient power to become a seri-
 ous  rival to Khrushchev.   Party
 secretary and presidium member
 Mikhail Suslov, for example,
 may find his horizons more
 limited as a result  of  the
 change.   Suslov, of all the So-
 viet leaders, is most often
 identified as a rival of Khru-
 shchev.                                                                   Recent reports from
 the Eastern European satellites
 and Yugoslavia have linked Sus-
 lov with a militant and ortho-
 dox wing of the party which al-
 legedly has been maneuvering
 to remove Khrushchev from his
 pre-eminent position.  The
 chances that such a development
 would materialize have probably
 decreased considerably as a re-
 sult of the plenum's actions.
 In Syria, internal politi-
 cal maneuvering continued this
 week against the background of
 growing hostility between out-
 right pro-Soviet elements, in-
 cluding local Communists, and
 the radical nationalists, typi-
 fied by the Baath party, which
 favors close ties with Egypt be-
 cause it sees in the Nasir re-
 gime an object of emulation and
 a protection against the further
 extension of Soviet influence.
 A campaign to diminish Communist
 influence, and possibly to re-
 move or clip the wings of Chief
 of Staff Bizri, still seems some
 time away, however.  A more

 serious collision between the
 two factions may occur when De-
 fense Minister Azm returns from
 Moscow, where he is still ne-
 gotiating more detailed agree-
 ments to follow up the Syrian-
 Soviet economic agreement.
 An internal political con-
 troversy arose in Egypt-last
 week with an attemp~y" Nasir's
 minister of education to re-
 sign his post following a vote
 by the National Assembly urging
 the government to admit more
 students to Egyptian universi-
 ties, a move the minister has
 stated is impossible.  The is-
 sue is insignificant in itself,
 but the assembly's reaction in
 ignoring government policy is
 another demonstration of the
 potential which the assembly
 may develop for irritating the
 regime and bringing hitherto
 private disagreements into the
 open.
 Iraq's long-awaited cabi-
 net cage occurred last week
 when Ali Jawdat al-Ayyubi, who
 favored a mild policy toward
 Egypt and Syria, was replaced
 by Abd al-Wahhab Mirjan, a
 relatively obscure figure who
 has long been associated with
 Iraq's "strong man," former
 Prime Minister Nuri Said.   The
 change came as Nuri himself re-
 turned from a trip to the West
 where he urged the need for
 further moves to settle the
 Palestine problem--on  Arab
 terms.  A similar theme was be-
 hind the recent meeting in An-
 kara of representatives of the
 Moslem members of the Baghdad
 pact.
 To forestall any possible
 success for such moves, the
 Israeli government has for some
 time been putting out feelers
 toward some kind of association
 with NATO.   Israeli emissaries
 have visited several Western
 European capitals to talk about
 this subject.
 Possibly as one preliminary
 step,  Israeli Prime Minister
 Ben-Gurion apparently has been
 plugging the idea that Israel
 should encourage the establish-
 ment of closer relations with
 West Germany.  Last week, the
 prime minister ran into heavy
 opposition from left-wing ele-
 ments in his coalition cabinet.
 The opposition played on still
 warm Jewish feeling against the
 Germans, but behind its stand
 also lies a continuing reluc-
 tance on the part of Israel's
 socialist intellectuals to as-
 sociate the state with what
 they think of as capitalist
 militarism.
 Many Zionists also  fear
 thata.full-blown policy of clos-
 er association with the Western
 alliance system would permanent-
 ly block the possibliity that
 the USSR might eventually per-
 mit its substantial numbers of
 Jews to emigrate.  Ben-Gurion,
 on the other hand, appears con-
 vinced that Soviet hostility to-
 ward Israel will not evaporate
 in the foreseeable future and
 that it behooves his government
 now to gain as many and as close
 security ties with the West as
 it can.   The temporary setback
 Ben-Gurion suffered this week
 will not make him deviate  from
 this objective, and he may take
 the occasion to force his op-
 onents from   e cabinet.

 CO1AZA AL
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In follow-up moves to the
 messages sent to major NATO pow-
 ers and India just before the
 NATO conference opened, Soviet
 Premier Bulganin addressed ad-
 ditional letters to the smaller
 NATO states and all UN members
 plus Switzerland.   These letters
 are a continuation of Moscow's
 efforts to achieve a "world-wide
 detente" and to promote opposi-
 tion to American                  plans' for
 strengthening NATO militarily.
 The proposals made in the
 letters to NATO countries are
 reiterated in the letters to
 UN members.   UN recipients are
 told that the present state of
 tension in the world can be at-
 tributed to aggressive plans of
 NATO under American leadership.
 The notes end with an appeal to
 individual UN members to support
 the Soviet proposals and coop-
 erate to prevent war.
 The notes dispatched to
 the NATO governments'. outlined
 the same general Soviet propos-
 als for various declarations
 and agreements to reduce inter-
 national tension.   Each note,
 however, was tailored to achieve
 the optimum impact on the re-
 cipient and was particularly
 designed t.o_stimulate opposition
 to American -Mans for the es-
 tablishment of atomic and mis-
 sile bases in West European
 countries.
 Bulganin played on French
 pride in attempting to arouse
 suspicion of Anglo-American in-
 tentions. at France's expense,
 and suggested that France, at
 the Paris conference, propose
 measures leading to a detente.
 Italy was encouraged to believe
 that its "peaceable" Middle East
 interests as a Mediterranean
 power would be jeopardized by
 the "aggressive" Eisenhower-
 Macmillan policy.
 The letters to smaller
 NATO countries were designed
 largely to foster and encourage
 neutralist sentiment by dwelling
 on the dangers of retaliation
 in the event of war if American
 atomic and missile bases were
 permitted on their territories.
 The danger in rearming West
 Germany was a major theme; all
 the letters to NATO states ex-
 cept those to Italy and Turkey
 warned of the dangers inherent
 in permitting 'Vest Germany to
 acquire or manufacture nuclear
 weapons.  Greece and Turkey
 were told of American desires
 to link NATO with SEATO and the
 Baghdad pact and were warned
 that such a development would
 involve those countries in mili-
 tary conflicts at  great ?dis--
 tances from their own boundaries.
 The note to Canada suggested
 that, as one of the major pro-
 ducers of missiles materials,
 Canada could play an important
 role in-'-the settlement of the
 atomic problem.
 Communist propaganda ex-
 ploitation of the letters has
 been extensive, primarily fol-
 lowing the lines set by the
 letters themselves.   Texts or
 summaries of all the notes have
 been broadcast, accompanied by
 commentaries to the individual
 countries largely conforming
 to the slant used in the formal
 note.
 Considerable comment has
 been devoted to refuting West-
 ern statements that the messages
 were intended to influence the
 NATO conference.   At the same
 time, however,   Soviet propa-
 gandists  'contend  that   the

 notes have had a definite ef-
 fect on NATO.
 Soviet domestic propaganda
 stressed the "decline" in Ameri-
 can prestige in light of Soviet
 "scientific and technological
 advances" and predicted  that
 the Paris meeting would accom-
 plish little.
 The recurrent theme of So-
 viet propaganda as the                 Paris
 conference concluded its ses-
 sions was the "growing desire"
 among NATO countries to hold a
 serious discussion of Bulganin's
 proposals.  Particularly empha-
 sized was the speech of Norwe-
 gian Premier Gerhardsen reject-
 ing missiles  bases  and  the
 stockpiling of'nuclear weapons.
 Soviet commentators cited West-
 ern news reports as evidence
 that a ground swell of "back-
 stage" support, including that
 of West German Chancellor Ade-
 nauer, was developing for Ger-
 hardsen's position.
 Public pressure in the NATO
 countries is claimed to have been
 the cause for a change in the
 original plans for the meeting.
 The chief objective of the United
 States was said to have been to
 induce its NATO partners to ac-
 cept the American plan for de-
 ployment of missile bases and
 for a demonstration of unity of
 views.   Because of the "popular"
 disapproval in Western Europe,
 Moscow asserted, Washington's
 plan for a "parade of Atlantic
 solidarity" did not come off.
 According to Moscow, the
 United States obtained an agree-
 ment in principle for deploy-
 ment of IRBM missiles in West-
 ern Europe only in return for
 a "solemn pledge" to renew nego-
 tiations with the USSR to end
 the cold war and solve the dis-
 armament problem.   A Soviet com-
 mentary labeled this agreement
 a hypocritical attempt to recon-
 cile irreconcilables--"the poli-
 cy of strength with the idea of
 negotiation."
 The transformation of four
 Soviet defense production minis-
 tries into committees on 14 De-
 cember has carried the general
 reorganization of Soviet indus-
 try further along lines initial-
 ly proposed by Khrushchev, while
 still assuring uninterrupted de-
 velopment.of new military items.
 Khrushchev's original plans
 for the abolition of industrial
 ministries did not exclude the
 defense production ministries,
 but, at the time of the estab-
 lishment of the new regional
 economic system last May, he
 called for retention of the de-
 fense-oriented-ministries.  How-
 ever, provision was made for at
 least some plants of these minis-
 tries to be transferred to op-
 erational control of the coun-
 cils of national economy (sov-
 narkhozy), and apparently this
 was done.
 Since May, Malenkov, Molo-
 tov, Kaganovich, and Zhukov,
 who might have opposed the abo-
 lition of defense production
 ministries, have been removed
 from high office.
 Also the industrial econo-
 my has come through the first

 six months under the new system
 satisfactorily, according to
 Soviet claims,  Perhaps for
 these and other reasons, the
 time was deemed ripe for a fur-
 ther step in the reorganization.
 Reported recent conflicts
 between the defense production
 ministries and the sovnarkhozy
 may have influenced the timing
 of  the  present action.  The
 manager of the Gorkiy automobile
 plant, one of the most important
 industrial plants in the coun-
 try, reportedly stated early
 this winter that much strife of
 this nature existed.
 By creating defense tech-
 nology committees, the USSR has
 retained a team in Moscow which
 would presumably maintain cen-
 tral control and coordination--
 particularly in developmental
 work.   Such a team could, for
 example, coordinate development
 of complex weapons systems,
 which would be an impossible
 task for the sovnarkhozy.
 Planning the production of
 such systems and their necessary
 components and facilities will
 also undoubtedly be carried out
 at high governmental  levels.
 Heading the team in the Presid-
 ium of the Council of Ministers
 is Dmitry Ustinov, former head
 of the Ministry of Defense In-
 dustry and now deputy premier.
 His former deputy and now chair-
 man of the Defense Technology

 of the principles of Bandung
 charges of
 Communist domination over the
 meeting have somewhat lessened
 Nasir's enthusiasm for the proj-
 ect,, although there has been
 no noticeable letup in Egyptian
 organizational activities.
 Between 300 and 400 dele-
 gates from more than 40 coun-
 tries and territories  are ex-
 pected by the sponsors, who
 have taken full advantage of
 the nongovernmental nature of
 the meeting to secure the broad-
 est possible representation of
 colonies and nationalist. oppo-
 sition groups.
 The committee has approved
 attendance from Oman, Senegal,
 Somalia, and Eritrea and has
 accepted Jordanian refugees and
 Cameroonian "Freedom Fighters."
 The Sino-Soviet bloc in-
 terest in the conference will
 probably be to register its
 own concurrence of interest
 with issues such as anticolo-
 nialism, and to encourage a.
 trend anti-Western attacks.
 The Chinese will play the
 major role in advancing Sino-
 Soviet bloc interests.   Pei
 ping's delegation will be led
 by Kuo Mo-jo, the Chinese Com-
 munist specialist in Afro-Asian
 issues and the regime's chief
 spokesman on cultural and scien-
 tific matters.  The USSR ap-
 parently is primarily interest-
 ed in consolidating its identity
 as an Asian state.   Pravda's
 discussion of the conference on
 1 December included a rarely
 made assertion that the USSR is
 "equally a European and an
 Asian state."
 African and Asian govern-
 ments have for the most  part
 recognized the Communist in-
 fluence in the conference but
 in general have not made stren-
 uous efforts to inhibit attend-
 ance by any individual nationals
 in a "private" capacity.   Con-
 siderable local dispute has
 been generated over selection
 of delegations.   The conference
 itself has not been subjected
 to much direct public attack,
 probably because of the powerful
 popular appeal to African-Asian
 sentiment of "solidarity," and
 "Bandung," and the desire not
 to be left out of any meeting
 concerning itself with regional
 problems.
 The conference may also
 inspire the formation of new
 Afro-Asian front organizations.
 Both Japan and Egypt have in-
 dicated their intention of pro-
 posing an Afro-Asian Economic
 Conference for 1958.  A new at-
 tempt to organize Afro-Asian
 Trade Unions might also be made.
 The Moroccan attacks on
 Spain's West African possessions
 present the Franco regime with
 the choice of pursuing military
 operations the Spanish economy
 can ill afford or losing Spanish
 territory and prestige.   Spain's
 actions probably will be af-
 fected by French prospects in
 Algeria.
 On 9 December, Spain be-
 gan a withdrawal to five coast-
 al perimeters, abandoning the
 hinterland of all its  West
 African possessions.   Spanish
 forces are superior in numbers
 and equipment to the attacking
 irregulars of the Moroccan Army

 Army, should be able to hold
 these perimeters.
 Spain is willing to relin-
 quish its protectorate over
 Southern Morocco, but it wants
 Rabat to forego further terri-
 torial claims.  King Mohamed V,
 however, is not likely to per-
 petuate Spain's rights to the
 north coast enclaves of Ceuta
 and Melilla or to Ifni, Saguia
 El Hamra, and Rio de Oro on the
 west coast, where Spain hopes
 to exploit possible oil and
 mineral resources.  Neither
 Spain nor Morocco wants open
 hostilities, but the success of
 the Moroccan irregulars in forc-
 ing the Spanish withdrawal will
 probably encourage the King to
 hold  to demands unacceptable
 to Franco.
 Spain will probably rely
 heavily on French backing in
 West Africa.  A meeting of the
 French and Spanish foreign min-
 isters at San Sebas-
 tian in August seems
 to have laid the base
 for closer coopera-
 tion; the French seem
 concerned with shor-
 ing up Spanish power
 in the area.   If
 French aid is insuf-
 ficient, however, or
 if France's position
 in North Africa con-
 tinues to weaken, the
 Spanish position in
 West Africa would be-
 come untenable.
 Even with  as-
 sistance from France,
 the Spanish economy
 can ill afford mili-
 tary operations in
 West Africa.   Spain
 has been hit by seri-
 ous inflation, and
 living costs   have

 ous balance-of-payments deficit.
 Expanded military expenditures
 would be a severe blow to the
 1958 budget, which already con-
 tains a sizable deficit.
 Although a serious econom-
 ic crisis would threaten the
 stability of the regime, the
 political consequences of an
 abandonment of Spanish West Af-
 rica would probably be greater
 and more immediate.   Many army
 officers were discontented
 over Spain's withdrawal from
 the Northern Moroccan Protecto-
 rate in April 1956, and the
 psychological effect of aban-
 doning Spain's remaining Afri-
 can holdings might cause .im-
 portant army elements to shift
 their support from the Franco
 regime to a military junta or
 to those favoring restoration
 of the monarchy.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 December 1957
 HAMMARSKJOLD'S
 TACTICS ON MIDDLE EAST ISSUES
 Syria, Jordan, and Israel rein-
 forced his earlier belief that
 an improvement in relations be-
 tween Egypt and the West would
 have a reassuring effect on the
 Middle East.   In addition to
 discussing implementation of
 the 3-percent surcharge on Suez
 Canal shipping, Hammarskjold
 will probably touch on other
 problems such as the Palestine
 refugees.
 To aid these endeavors,
 Hammarskhold was eager to keep
 controversy over Middle East-
 ern issues to a minimum at the
 recent session of the General
 Assembly.   Initially his ef-
 forts were seriously threatened
 by discussion of Syria's com-
 plaint of Turkish aggressive
 intentions.   Shelving of this
 issue avoided a serious show-
 down both within the Arab-Asian
 bloc and the assembly itself.
 Three other troublesome Middle
 Eastern issues were disposed of
 by this assembly with relative-
 ly little rancor.   On 22 Novem-
 ber it decided that UNEF ex-
 penses should be borne by all
 members under the regular scale
 of assessments; on 12 December
 it called on all members to in-
 crease aid to the Palestine
 refugees; and on 14 December it
 authorized the 3-percent sur-
 charge on Suez Canal shipping
 to defray the costs of the canal
 clearance.
 Following his successful
 mission to Jordan concerning
 Israel's Mt. Scopus convoys,
 Hammarskjold visited Syria in
 order "to tie their hands vis-
 a-vis other Arabs."  Israel, he
 believes, realizes that it is
 much more secure than it has
 ever been, except for the threat
 of Soviet intervention in the
 area.   The secretary general
 was pleased over the amount of
 pro-UN public sentiment in the
 area.   Much of this he attrib-
 utes  to the excellent job done
 by the UN Emergency Force.
 Hammarskjold will probably
 continue to attempt to put out
 brush fires and keep the situa-
 tion as conducive as possible
 for negotiations toward some
 type of settlement.  He be-
 lieves there is much less risk
 of an outbreak in the area now
 than there has been for a long
 time,  but that the "patient is
 still very, very weak:'
 NEW GOVERNMENT IN PAKISTAN
 Pakistan's third govern-
 ment in three months, which took
 office on 16 December under Re-
 publican leader Firoz Khan Noon,
 offers little prospect for capa-
 ble leadership or for long ten-
 ure.   The new government,  re-
 placing the one led by I. I.
 Chundrigar, may merely pave the
 way for a return to power of
 former Prime Minister Suhrawardy,
 on whose support Noon's coali-
 tion is dependent.
 President Mirza called on
 Noon, 64-year-old foreign min-
 ister in the outgoing Republican-
 Moslem League government, after
 Chundrigar failed on 13 Decem-
 ber to form another cabinet. A

 ment.   Its support of the Bagh-
 dad pact and SEATO will  be
 strongly maintained by Noon,
 who has served as foreign min-
 ister in the last two cabinets.
 Suhrawardy, ousted as prime
 minister in October,   is likely
 to  play  a key  role  in  fu-
 ture developments.                                                              While pro-

 for Noon's  government in the
 National Assembly,  he has re-
 fused to allow his Awami League
 colleagues to  join the cabi-
 net.   Suhrawardy  apparently
 agreed  to stand aside as po-
 tential leader of the  new
 government in order to expedite
 the defeat  of  the Moslem
 League.   He  probably intends,
 however,   to exploit his con-
 trolling position                                                                   to promote
 his own   return to power
 relieved of any responsibility
 for the present government's
 shortcomings.
 Noon is not likely to pro-
 vide effective leadership. De-
 spite his wide experience, he
 is not considered a capable
 leader nor does he wield much
 political influence.   He was
 able to form a cabinet only
 after considerable difficulty,
 and then only by including a
 disproportionate number of Re-
 publicans from the last cabinet.
 There are no effective repre-
 sentatives of East Pakistan in
 the new cabinet.
 Pakistan's pro-Western
 orientation should not be af -
 The appointment of Noon
 to head a coalition opposing
 the separate electorate policy
 constitutes  a significant re-
 treat by President Mirza. Mirza
 had strongly backed Chundrigar's
 attempt to form another govern-
 ment, and its failure left Mirza
 with the alternatives of sanc-
 tioning a government led by the
 Republicans, who had repudiated
 his leadership, or of resorting
 to authoritarian rule.   The de-
 cline in his prestige and polit-
 ical capability will make the     25X1
 latter course of action increas-
 ingly difficult.
 Marshal Sarit and the rul-
 ing Thai military group should
 be convinced by the results of
 the 15 December parliamentary
 elections that continuation of
 Thailand's pro-Western foreign
 policy poses no threat to their
 political interests.   Leftist
 candidates, who had campaigned
 on an anti-SEATO, neutralist
 platform, fared very badly, and
 may wind up with even less seats
 than the 22 they held in the na-
 tional assembly which was dis-
 solved shortly after the 16 Sep-
 tember army coup d'etat.
 The lack of voter appeal
 of the leftists' neutralist
 platform was especially apparent
 in the Bangkok,~;a6tropolitan

 pro-Western Democratic party
 swept 11 out of 12 seats, de-
 spite the strong support given
 leftist candidates by Bangkok's
 predominately leftist press.
 Aside from the poor show-
 ing of the leftists, the most
 significant aspect of the elec-
 tion results  was the large
 number of independents who were
 winners.   With  returns for 143
 out of 160 contested seats re-
 ported, independents won 55,
 compared to 40 for the Sarit-
 sponsored Unionists, 36 for the
 Democrats, 6 for the leftist
 Economists, and 6 for minor
 parties, mostly leftist-orient-
 ed.   Of the victorious inde-
 pendents, 37 were former mem-
 bers of the now moribund Seri
 Manangkhasila party (SMP),  the
 government party during Marshal
 Phibun's regime.
 Sarit and his military
 group are undoubtedly satisfied
 with the election results. They
 have already announced forma-
 tion of a new government party
 composed of the 123 appointed
 members of the assembly,  the
 Unionists, and former SMP mem-
 bers who were elected as inde-
 pendents.
 The Laotian government has
 installed its own governor in
 Sam Neua Province, formerly
 held by the Pathet Lao, and
 Pathet battalions are arriving
 at assembly points for demo-
 bilization or integration into
 the national army.   These troops
 are surrendering only antiquated
 arms, presumably having shipped
 all modern arms to North Viet-
 nam or stored them in clandes-
 tine depots.
 Although Democratic party
 leader Khuang Aphaiwong would
 have added luster to the new
 government, his inflexible at-
 titude toward corruption prob-
 ably could have made his pres-
 ence in the government embar-
 rassing to the military.   It is
 thus probable that by mutual
 agreement Khuang and his party
 will function ostensibly as an
 opposition party.
 The new legislature will
 meet on 26 December, and a new
 government is expected to be
 formed shortly thereafter. The
 chief difficulty facing Sarit
 in forming a new government will
 be that of finding a prime min-
 ister who is reputable, well-
 known abroad, and acceptable to
 the military.   If he fails to
 induce outgoing Provisional
 Prime Minister Pote to stay on,
 Sarit may turn to Defense Min-
 ister General Thanom or even
 take over the position himself.
 He would probably prefer to re-
 main in his capacity as armed
 forces  commander, however.
 Western observers have been
 impressed by the discipline and
 alertness of the Pathet troops
 and officials.   The British am-
 bassador to Laos believes the
 dispersal of such determined
 activists throughout Laos con-
 stitutes a grave danger to the
 regime.   The population in the
 province had been organized
 along Communist lines, but it
 is difficult to assess their
 fundamental attitude toward the

 reports, many people appeared
 favorably disposed toward the
 government delegation and com-
 plained of spending at least
 one or two weeks each month do-
 ing forced labor for the Pathet
 regime.
 It is widely agreed that
 economic  conditions in the
 province are dismal,  with few
 consumer goods in the shops and
 rumors of a rice crop failure
 and possible famine. A severe
 food shortage would offer the
 government an opportunity to

 Vientiane and reportedly has
 formed an alliance with the
 left-wing National Union party,
 both parties agreeing to nom-
 inate joint candidates in all
 provinces for the supplementary
 elections scheduled for 4 May
 1958.   National Union leader
 Bong Souvannavong reportedly is
 predicting that the alliance
 will win 15 of the 20 contested
 seats and will then demand four
 cabinet portfolios. Both parties
 have received a boost as a re-
 sult of the government's 29 No-
 vember order releasing all polit-
 ical prisoners held as Pathet
 Lao collaborators.
 Prime Minister Souvanna
 Phouma and other conservative
 leaders of the leading Nation-
 alist and Independent parties
 recognize the critical impor-
 tance of holding pro-Communist
 electoral gains to a minimum
 and are therefore planning some
 form of  campaign  cooperation.
 Souvanna, however, is pressing
 for a merger of the two parties
 and possibly the small Democratic
 party into a single conservative
 bloc that would remain united
 after the campaign had concluded.
 He may be motivated, in part, by
 a desire to consolidate  his
 ascendency within the National-
 ist party over his long-time
 rival,  Interior Minister Katay,
 by forming a bloc from which
 the latter's supporters might
 be excluded.
 SOVIET WRITER DUDINTSEV ADMITS "ERRORS"
 Vladimir Dudintsev, author
 of the controversial  Soviet
 novel "Not By Bread Alone," at
 a recent meeting of the Moscow
 Writers'  Union  admitted the
 correctness  and Justice  of
 criticism of his book by the
 Soviet Writers' Union and prom-
 ised to write a new work about
 the Soviet intelligentsia which
 will portray "positive heroes."
 Although Dudintsev   has been
 under heavy attack   as a "re-
 visionist" for almost a year,
 he had until now  refused to
 accept publicly official criti-
 cism of his novel.                  That he
 has done so will probably  be
 interpreted in the Soviet Union
 as a triumph for Khrushchev's
 policy of "comradely persuasion."
 "Not  By Bread  Alone,"
 serialized in the literary
 monthly Novy Mir last autumn,
 was at first praised but was
 later officially         criticized
 for         spotlighting  "negative"
 aspects of Soviet society when
 it  became evident it had be-
 come  a rallying point  for
 "dissident"  Soviet intellec-
 tuals and students as well as
 a source for foreign criticism
 of the Soviet regime.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY .SUMMARY
 19 December 1957
 Dudintsev vigorously defended
 his novel against .charges :t.hat
 it distorted Soviet life. How-
 ever, two months later he wrote
 in a preface to the English
 edition that he was "horror-
 stricken",at the interpretation
 of his book by unfriendly West-
 ern critics, who paid attention
 only to the negative aspects of
 a novel which he intended chief-
 ly for "internal consumption."
 Khrushchev apparently made
 a special effort to bring Du-
 dintsev into line.   In his
 speeches on literature and art
 published on 26 August, Khru-
 shchev predicted that Dudintsev,
 "with the assistance of the
 party," would be convinced of
 his errors and return to party-
 inspired creative activity. An
 interviewer quoted Khrushchev
 as saying on 14 November that
 he expected to see Dudintsev
 personally soon.
 The newspaper Evening
 Moscow recently disclosed, in
 Fie same article which reported
 Dudintsev's admission of "er-
 rors," that a collection of his
 earlier short stories is being
 prepared for publication in
 book form.   This probably is
 both a reward to Dudintsev for
 his "reasonableness" and an at-
 tempt to "prove" to Soviet and
 foreign readers that the regime
 does not black-list.wr.iters who
 have repented their mistakes.
 Control of all publishing
 facilities and of the Soviet
 Writers' Union--which manages
 pension and loan funds as well
 as housing, medical, and vaca-
 tion facilities for writers--
 gives the regime a considerable
 advantage in dealing  with a
 recalcitrant writer such as
 Dudintsev.  A more subtle but
 effective control measure is
 the professional isolation of
 the intellectual who deviates
 from the party line.   The col-
 leagues of an artist or writer
 officially accused as a "devi-
 ator" are expected to avoid as-
 sociating with him and to add
 their voices to the regime's
 criticism of him.
 When the de-Stalinization
 campaign resulted in an unan-
 ticipated degree of criticism
 of the Soviet system during
 1956, Khrushchev countered with
 a policy of "comradely persua-
 sion" designed to restore the
 proper perspective to erring
 artists and intellectuals.   The
 bolder "dissident" writers re-
 acted with a "conspiracy of
 silence," refusing either to
 defend their positions or to
 produce new works.  However,
 during the past few months
 several leaders of the "con-
 spiracy" have recanted and
 promised to produce literature
 "for the people."
 The success of this policy
 has probably convinced Khru-
 shchev that Stalinist terror
 will not be necessary in the
 near future.   It seems only a
 matter of time before the few
 writers still remaining silent
 will admit their "errors."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 December 1957
 NEW LAW MAKES ESCAPE FROM EAST GERMANY A CRIME
 The passage of legisla-
 tion on 12 December making
 flight, or aiding and abetting
 flight, from East Germany a
 criminal act is a logical step
 for the regime in implementing
 its tougher domestic policy
 including norm increases, wage
 cuts, and greater pressures
 for stepped-up collectiviza-
 tion and socialization.   The
 law is intended primarily to
 curb the serious loss of man-
 power and to reduce the trans-
 fer of the new East German
 currency to the West.   The
 East German Communists,  rely-
 ing on the presence of 350,000
 Soviet troops, seem willing to
 risk possible popular protests
 against the harsher policies.
 Despite tighter controls
 on the Berlin sector borders
 since the 13 October currency
 pressures on the churches in
 East Germany are partly respon-
 sible for the abnormal in-
 crease.   In the main, however,
 the stepped-up rate of flight
 reflects the widespread fear
 of harsher domestic policies
 and tighter border controls
 which will make future flight
 more difficult and far riskier.
 The new law is so general
 as to be subject to various
 interpretations.   Its full ef-
 fect, therefore, cannot be de-
 termined until steps are taken
 to enforce it.   In addition to
 having as its aim the curbing
 of the refugee flow, the law
 was obviously intended to cur-
 tail contacts between East and
 West Germans and, through
 tighter passport control pro-
 visions,  insulate the East
 German people from the atmos-
 phere of political
 and economic freedom
 and the high standard
 of living prevailing
 in West Germany.

 conversion,  the flow of refugees
 to West Berlin has increased--

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SU1URY
 HUNGARY STEPS UP REPRESSIVE?MEASURES AGAINST INTELLIGENTSIA
 The Kadar regime in Hunga-
 ry--possibly under strong pres-
 sure from local Stalinists--
 may be abandoning its truce
 with Hungarian writers and re-
 turning to a "hard" repressive
 policy against the intelligent-
 sia.
 During September it ap-
 peared that Kadar might have
 reached some understanding with
 certain Hungarian writers who
 were becoming increasingly des-
 titute as a result of their
 continued refusal to write.
 Some writers announced limited
 cooperation with a new periodi-
 cal, although they made clear
 that they would not write  on
 controversial subjects.   In re-
 turn, the regime appears to
 have meted out comparatively
 moderate sentences to writers
 implicated in the national up-
 rising and to have tolerated
 circulation of Western literary
 works.
 In November a number of
 prominent cultural figures were
 arrested and,  on  13 December,
 Kadar, referring to them, de-
 clared, "Those who launched an
 attack on the people must be
 punished, and if the attack was
 very ugly,  then they must be
 punished very severely."
 Kadar's policies had been
 arousing serious concern in the
 powerful Stalinist wing of the
 Hungarian party, which is in-
 tensifying its demands for a
 return to full-scale party con-
 trol of literature.   In his
 first article in the official
 party newspaper since March,
 central committee member Jozsef
 Revai, long-time ideological
 czar under Rakosi, on 7 Novem-
 ber sharply criticized the re-
 gime's policy of permitting
 writers to treat "popular" sub-
 jects and demanded unrelenting
 application of "socialist real-
 ism" of the Khrushchev stamp.
 In a second article on 24 Novem-
 ber, Revai bitterly attacked
 the "popular" writers.  Revai
 is reportedly on good terms
 with Soviet presidium member
 Suslov, and his reappearance
 in print may reflect guidance
 from Moscow.
 Echoing Revai's "hard-line"
 demands, Minister of  State
 Gyorgy Marosan on 6 December
 demanded that writers "step up
 to face the people and admit
 that they made mistakes and
 committed crimes."  He further
 declared that "a writer or poet
 who is silent now is alien to
 the people."
 The Chinese Communists are
 also being invoked as an author-
 ity to justify harsh procedures
 against intellectuals.  The Pei-
 ping correspondent of a Hun-
 garian literary weekly on 29
 November reiterated Mao's in-
 terpretation of the "hundred
 flowers" doctrine to cover
 "weeds"--"if it turns out that
 the flowers are weeds, we will
 root them out....   The same
 method should be used in Hun-
 gary."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PEIPING DEMANDS TIGHTER TRADE UNION DISCIPLINE
 Speeches and resolutions
 at the eighth congress of the
 All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions (ACFTU), which ended on
 12 December, reflect Chinese
 Communist concern over any un-
 rest which might develop as a
 result of renewed austerity for
 urban workers.  The emphasis
 on the role of trade unions as
 a "school for Communism" and
 warnings against paying too
 much attention to questions of
 welfare and union-management
 conflict reveal the regime's
 determination to tighten up
 labor discipline and to ensure
 party control over workers.
 This is the first ACFTU
 congress since 1953, and the
 regime treated it as an event
 of great importance.  Five of
 the six members of the standing
 committee of the party politburo
 --including Mao Tse-tung and
 Liu Shao-chi, the two leading
 figures in the regime--turned
 out for the opening meeting.
 More than a thousand delegates
 attended, representing 16,300,000
 trade union members from 23
 industrial unions.
 Speakers hailed the 63-
 percent increase in union mem-
 bership during the past four
 years and proclaimed ambitious
 future goals.   Liu Shao-chi,
 Vice Premier Li Fu-chun, and
 ACFTU Chairman Lai Jo-yu called
 for increased efforts in pro-
 duction so that Communist China
 can surpass British industrial
 output in 15 years.
 A principal amendment to
 the ACFTU constitution made
 during the congress formally
 established a "workers' con-
 gress" organization.   Lai Jo-yu
 noted that formation of these
 groups had been discussed at
 the eighth congress of the
 Chinese Communist party in
 1956--at a time when the 'Yugo-
 slavs were stressing their
 workers' councils as a dis-
 tinctive contribution to Com-
 munist practice.  Moscow has
 indicated its disapproval of
 Belgrade's concept, however,
 and the Chinese Communist
 workers' congresses, approved
 by the party central committee
 last September,have only a sur-
 face resemblance to the Yugo-
 slav organizations.
 A workers' congress, Lai
 said,  is entitled to hear work
 reports, to inspect production
 and welfare expenditures, and
 to "make all kinds of sugges-
 tions"--so long as these do
 not contradict directives from
 higher authority or "infringe
 on the rights of management."
 This is in contrast with the
 Yugoslav councils, which play
 an actual role in factory man-
 agement.
 The new organizations will
 be little more than an addi-
 tional instrument to help the
 unions act as a "link between
 the party and the masses."  Liu
 Shao-chi underlined the impor-
 tance of worker indoctrination,
 declaring that all new workers
 must undergo "ideological trans-
 formation" to offset "bourgeois"
 ideology seeping into the ranks
 of the workers through "non-
 proletarian elements."
 Statements by Lai Jo-yu
 and other spokesmen indicate
 that the regime plans to im-
 pose harsher austerity on the
 workers, until now a favored
 group, in order to bring their
 living standards into line with
 those of the peasants.   Lai
 stated that increases in wages
 and welfare benefits should be
 "somewhat smaller" than in-
 creases in production, and de-
 clared that the regime had
 promoted some workers too fast,
 set the rates too high for
 certain jobs,a.nd made the terms
 of welfare benefits too liberal.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER FACES DOMESTIC POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES
 Renewed factionalism in
 Japan's ruling Liberal-Democrat-
 ic                party will probably be in-
 tensified at the regular session
 of the Diet beginning on 20 De-
 cember and is expected to be
 the major consideration in Prime
 Minister Kishi's timing of the
 general elections.   Party dis-
 cord could threaten the stabil-
 ity of Kishi's government,
 strengthen the Socialist opposi-
 tion, and delay passage of any
 legislation, including the budg-
 et for the fiscal year beginning
 1 April 1958.
 Former Prime Minister
 Shigeru Yoshida and other con-
 servative party leaders who
 resent continued exclusion from
 key positions are threatening
 to form a third party and topple
 the government.   Their opposi-
 tion has centered on Kishi's
 retention in the cabinet of
 Economic Planning Board Minister
 Ichiro Kono,  who they believe
 is too ambitious in expanding
 his power.   The Yoshida group
 may attempt to gain popular sup-
 port by claiming an ability to
 obtain greater concessions from
 the United States than can the
 Kishi government.
 The Yoshida and Kono groups
 are irreconcilable and both are
 confident of winning Kishi's
 approval in the showdown they
 are demanding.   Kono believes
 his support of Kishi's rise to
 power, which initially was op-
 posed by the Yoshida forces,
 gives him a strong advantage.
 He believes also that he holds
 the balance of power in the
 present cabinet and that he
 would probably be able to force
 the government's resignation if
 the prime minister should show
 any lack of support for him.
 Yoshida, who has been de-
 manding elections in January
 or February 1958 before Kono
 increases his power further,
 told Ambassador MacArthur that
 a long discussion with Kishi
 on 10 December had convinced
 him that elections would not be
 held before April.  He said
 Kishi must ease Kono out,
 but recognized that this would
 be difficult and would take
 time.
 Kishi has said only that
 elections will not be held be-
 fore the Diet approves the
 1958 budget, and apparently
 has not decided definitely on
 when the elections will be held.
 In any event, elections must be
 held by February 1959.
 Continued open factional-
 ism in Japan's conservative
 ranks would favor the trend to-
 ward the left and neutralism
 that has been evident in Japan
 over the past several years.
 It is possible that a successor
 to Kishi, particularly if he is
 Kono, not only might loosen ties
 with the United States but might
 seek closer relations with the
 Communist bloc, especially Com-
 munist China.   Such a policy
 would have the support of many
 conservatives as well as that
 of the Socialists.
 Ambassador MacArthur re-
 gards the forthcoming elections
 as equal in importance to the
 recent German elections and be-
 lieves the outcome will have
 an important influence on the
 American position in Japan and
 on Japan's role in Asia.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC INTERFERENCE IN THE CARIBBEAN AREA
 Unsettled political condi-
 tions in several countries of
 the Caribbean area have opened
 the way for renewed plotting by
 Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo
 of the Dominican Republic, who
 has frequently manifested a de-
 sire to establish personal he-
 gemony over the area.   His major
 effort now is being directed
 against Guatemala, where he is
 intriguing to install a right-
 ist regime friendly to his dic-
 tatorship.
 Dominican subversion in
 Guatemala, reported as early as
 May 1957, increased considerably
 following the assassination of
 President Carlos Castillo Armas
 in July.   Trujillo attempted,
 through support of extreme
 rightist elements, to influence
 the outcome of the 20 October
 presidential election.   Confu-
 sion arising from mob action
 fomented by the defeated right-
 ist candidate, Miguel Ydigoras
 Fuentes, the subsequent annul-
 lingct the election, and the
 rise of the leftist Revolution-
 ary party  inspired even greater
 Dominican efforts.  The Do=
 minicans apparently  resorted
 to  at  least  one  murder--
 a                method they are widely
 accused  Of  using--in  an
 attempt to achieve their ends
 in Guatemala.
 Guatemalan press stories
 of Dominican activities, includ-
 ing an unsubstantiated allega-
 tion that Trujillo was involved
 in Castillo's assassination,
 coincided with a lurid Dominican
 radio propagandai  campaign
 against Guatemala and almost
 resulted in the severing of
 Guatemalan-Dominican relations.
 Trujillo continues to support
 Ydigoras Fuentes financially,
 adding to the already serious
 SECRET
 division among anti-
 Communist political
 parties.
 In Honduras,
 Dominican interference
 is directed against
 President-elect Ramon
 Villeda Morales, whose
 stand against dictator-
 ships and friendship
 with Costa. Rican
 President Jose Figueres
 are anathema to Tru-
 jillo.   Dominican-
 Honduran relations

 that Trujillo was supplying arms
 to Nicaragua in the then explo-
 sive Honduran-Nicaraguan border
 dispute.
 With respect to Colombia,
 the arrival of ousted Colombian
 dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla
 in the Dominican Republic late
 in August was accompanied by in-
 dications that Trujillo was sup-
 porting Rojas' plan to reinstate
 his authoritarian regime.  Rojas'
 second visit in December pro-
 voked similar rumors, but evi-
 dence of Dominican conniving
 was much less tangible.
 The recent exchange of hon-
 onary decorations between Tru-
 jillo and Haitian army chief
 Kebreau indicates Dominican in-
 terest in the growth of strong
 military control over Haiti's
 newly inaugurated government.
 Although previous rumors that
 Trujillo might offer economic
 aid to Haiti as a means of ex-
 erting political influence were
 never substantiated, the Tru-
 jillo-Kebreau rapprochement
 leaves open such a possibility.
 Governor Foot's imaginative
 gestures of good will have been
 favorably received both in Athens
 and in Cyprus.  When he returns
 to London, probably in January,
 the British cabinet may adopt
 his expected recoa  e. dat  ?ns for
 rapidly advancing Cypriot self-
 government.
 The governor's surprise
 visit on 11 December to the
 strongly nationalist mayor of
 Nicosia and his stroll down the
 streets of Nicosia following
 serious rioting--the first time
 a governor has done so for years
 --indicate his willingness to
 break with precedent and drar-
 atime  his aim of ending what
 he terms "the present drs dful
 mess." At least for the pres-
 ent, most Greek Cypriots, in-
 cluding the leaders of EOKA,
 appear willing to grant the
 governor the few weeks' grace
 he has requested to conduct his
 appraisal.   For his part,  the
 governor has said he would mini-
 mize the use of security forces
 during provocative incidents.
 Foot's planned solution is
 evidently a considerable depar-
 ture from present British policy,
 but he professes confidence that
 he can sell it both to the
 Cypriots and to the Colonial
 Office.  Although Foot refuses
 to divulge any details yet, his
 plan is likely to include the
 uncondition :1  return of Makarios
 and the drafting of a new con-
 stitution in which Makarios and
 other Cypriots would participate.
 Otherwise, Foot may suggest
 that Britain proceed immediately
 to grant wide powers of self-
 government unilaterally and call
 for elections to implement them.
 He will probably also recommend
 some positive statement promis-
 ing self-determination after a
 specified period.   In his last
 post, Jamaica, Foot was noted
 for promoting timely concessions
 in order to forestall more ex-
 tensive demands.
 Pressure from both the
 Labor party and the press to do
 something about Cyprus is likely

 to make the cabinet receptive to
 Foot's ideas.         Anxious not to
 prejudice the possible imple-
 mentation of his proposals,
 British officials will await
 Foot's suggestions before taking
 any further action.   The govern-
 ment.apparently places consider-
 able reliance on his judgment
 as an experienced and liberal
 colonial administrator.
 Adoption of his recommenda-
 tions might require abandonment
 of Britain's long-standing aim
 of negotiating for agreement
 on the island's status with
 Greece and Turkey.
 Turkey would probably op-
 pose strongly such a change in
 British policy.   Ankara continues
 to insist that any scheme of
 self-government is a step toward
 enosis--union of  Cyprus with
 Greece.   The Turks insist that
 partition is the only solution
 to the Cyprus problem and are
 following a policy of "watchful
 waiting" pending a declaration
 of  intention by Governor Foot.
 The wave of strikes recent-
 ly instigated in Ceylon by unions
 affiliated with the Trotskyite
 Nava Lanka Sama Samaja party ap-
 pears to have quieted down, but
 it has left confusion in its
 wake.   The government, which
 temporarily settled most strikes
 by granting interim wage raises,
 now faces the problem of find-
 ing funds with which to pay its
 workers, while private industry
 anticipates a series of demands
 from workers comparable to those
 recently made on the government.
 The major strikes of mu-
 nicipal, port, transportation,
 communications, and other labor
 organizations which paralyzed
 Colombo from 20 November were
 for the most part settled by
 6 December.   However, Colombo
 port was still in a chaotic
 condition a   week  after  the
 settlement, with labor continu-
 ing an unofficial slowdown,
 warehouses bulging, the harbor
 congested, and ships bypassing
 or leaving the port without
 loading.  Tea and rubber sales
 were suspended and some small
 plantations were in financial
 difficulties.
 Prime Minister Bandaranaike,
 who expressed sympathy for the
 workers  and granted  pay  in-
 creases to most striking unions,
 will now have to find over $10,-
 000,000 with which to make the
 promised payments.   At the mo-
 ment,  there is no   clear indica-
 tion of how this will be done.
 If Bandaranaike temporizes, he
 may find himself faced with an-
 other series of strikes more
 difficult to end.
 A one-day strike on 9 De-

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE WEST GERMAN NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM
 West Germany's recently an-
 nounced atomic energy program
 provides for the building over
 the next five years of nuclear
 power stations with a combined
 initial capacity of 500 mega-
 watts at an estimated cost of
 at least $200,000,000.   Several
 research reactors are already
 under construction.   The  nu-
 clear build-up will serve basic
 research as well as provide the
 beginning of a power and pro-
 pulsion program and could                     be
 adapted for military research
 purposes.
 Atomic affairs Minister
 Siegfried Balke has indicated
 that the projected power re-
 actors will be  supplied  by
 firms from various countries,
 including Britain, the United
 States, and Germany itself.
 the Federal Republic cannot
 stand aside while other coun-
 tries plan the exploitation of
 nuclear energy.   Other German
 officials also feel that Ger-
 many must lead the way in scien-
 tific and engineering develop-
 ment.  Balke has pointed to the
 importance of nuclear energy in
 view of the enormously increas-
 ing demands of German industry
 on other sources of energy.
 He recently wrote that "the
 time is not far off when the
 Federal Republic will be able
 to bridge a gap in the energy
 field only by providing nuclear
 sources of energy."  Undoubt-
 edly, the Federal Republic will
 eventually want to undertake
 the production of nuclear weap-
 ons.
 The inception of a German
 nuclear energy  program  has
 caused intense competition--
 as well as cooperation--among
 firms of several nations anx-
 ious                                                               to supply, reactors and
 undertake construction.  Various
 projects are afoot.  The Rhine-
 Westphalian Electricity Works
 (RWE). has plans for a nuclear
 power reactor.  Following can-
 cellation of its contract with
 a US-British group  for  con-
 struction of a 15-megawatt boil-
 ing water reactor, RWE has re-
 quested new tenders for a 100-
 megawatt power plant.  A Calder
 Hall type will probably be se-
 lected if suitable guarantees
 can be agreed on.
 Different kinds will be used in
 order to choose the most effec-
 tive type for the future.  The
 combined capacity of the pro-
 posed plants will be 500 mega-
 watts, with the possibility for
 an expansion to 1,500 megawatts.
 Objectives
 In a public statement on
 7 November, Balke declared that
 Brown-Boveri and Krupp seem
 likely to build a power reactor
 for the Duesseldorf city power
 company.  Three utility com-
 panies in North Germany are
 jointly planning an atomic pow-
 er plant of 100 megawatts.  For
 other locations, Babcock and
 Wilcox of Germany has offered
 to build a 50-megawatt Calder
 Hall -. type  reactor,   and' the

 Frankfurt General Electric Com-
 pany is interested in construct-
 ing a power reactor of 100 mega-
 watts capacity.   These firms
 will reportedly maintain con-
 tact with each other and syn-
 chronize their projects.
 Because of the enormous
 costs, German industry has
 shown little interest in de-
 veloping nuclear energy on its
 own.   Consequently, the federal
 and state governments have been
 investing in the projects along
 with private  citizens  and
 firms.   This type of financing
 was arranged for the Karlsruhe
 research reactor, scheduled for
 completion in 1959 under the
 direction of Prof. Karl Wirtz.
 The universities are the
 center of operations for Ger-
 many's top nuclear physicists,
 among whom are Prof. Rudolf
 Fleischmann of Erlangen and

 tions are under way to purchase
 a prototype for a      ship propul-
 sion reactor.
 Uranium and Legislation
 West Germany  has only  a
 meager supply of uranium at pres-
 ent.           The only actively mined
 uranium deposit  was closed in
 November, but  other areas, es-
 pecially in the Palatinate, give
 promise  of  future  output.
 Through its membership  in
 EURATOM, however, the  Federal
 Republic is assured of adequate
 supplies  of uranium and other
 fissionable materials.  In  ad-
 dition, it has concluded several
 bilateral agreements to obtain
 supplies for peaceful purposes.
 It can obtain 2,500 kilograms
 of contained U-235 from the
 United States; nuclear  fuels
 from Britain; and  500 tons of
 uranium over the next five years
 from Canada.
 At the current session of
 the Bundestag, an effort will
 be made to adopt the two atomic
 energy laws which failed to pass
 last summer when the government
 refused to accept Social Demo-
 cratic amendments prohibiting
 the use of nuclear materials
 for military purposes.  One, an
 amendment to the constitution,
 gives the federal government
 concurrent jurisdiction with the
 states over atomic energy; the
 other governs the utilization
 of nuclear energy by regulating
 the handling of fissionable ma-
 terials, providing penalties for
 misuse, guaranteeing fulfillment
 of international obligations,
 and providing licensing proce-
 dures.  By treaty, all special
 fissionable materials produced
 or imported will be the property
 of EURATOM when the treaty be-
 comes effective.
 Military Applications
 The Paris treaties of 1954
 prohibit the Federal Republic
 from manufacturing nuclear weap-
 ons.  The Bonn government's in-
 terest in the general field of
 nuclear weapons has been grow-
 ing, however, and, in the spring
 of 1957, provoked a reaction
 from 18 leading German nuclear
 scientists who said in the
 "Goettingen Manifesto" that they
 would have nothing to do with
 the production  of nuclear weap-
 ons.  Among the 18 were Nobel
 prize winner Dr. Otto Hahn and
 Dr. Werner Heisenberg, also a
 Nobel prize winner and director
 of the Max Planck Institute for
 Physics, which is building a
 research reactor.   Minister
 Balke is also among the oppo-
 nents of military uses                                                               and
 supported the 18 scientists.
 Bonn may, however, at some time
 ask for a repeal of the treaty
 restrictions and, until then, is
 free to carry on civilian nu-
 clear activities.
 The nuclear program out-
 lined by Minister Balke can
 serve a variety of purposes--
 for pure research, provide the
 beginning of a power and propul-
 sion program, and could be
 adapted for research for mili-
 tary uses.  The Germans are
 very interested in obtaining
 plutonium from their program.
 In addition to use in weapons,
 plutonium may also be used as
 fuel in advanced types of power
 reactors.
 While the West German nu-
 clear energy program is in the
 early development stage and is
 modest in size compared with the
 programs of Britain and France,
 Germany, through its membership
 in EURATOM, may participate in
 a much larger nuclear power pro-
 gram that Balke has announced.
 The release from present treaty
 obligations and unrestricted ac-
 cess to source materials will       25X1
 permit Germany to develop a nu-
 clear program at least comparable
 to that in France.

 19 December 1957
 FRENCH CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION
 Many Frenchmen are begin-
 ning to stress early reforms
 of the French constitution and
 electoral system as the only
 alternative to dictatorship. A
 special parliamentary committee
 to draft revisions began delibera-
 tions early in December, and Pre-
 mier Gaillard has called for con-
 sideration ofconstitutional re-
 form.by3parliament immediately
 after the Christmas recess. De-
 spite growing recognition of
 the need for reforms, differ-
 ences in party objectives limit
 the prospects for an early posi-
 tive step.
 The 1946 Constitution
 The continuing drain of
 the Algerian war on French re-
 sources and renewed speculation
 that a "strong man" may be the
 only alternative have spurred the
 drive for fundamental changes
 in the present constitution.
 Public approval of a change is
 indicated in the results of a
 recent press poll which showed
 that nine out of ten Frenchmen
 believe modification of the con-
 stitution:could'.improve govern-
 ment stability; four out of nine
 are convinced that the 1946 con-
 stitution is the chief cause of
 chronic cabinet crises in Francea
 Political leaders have contrib-
 uted to the present mood by cit-
 ing the inadequacies of the con-
 stitution as an excuse for their
 parties' behavior in repeatedly
 overturning cabinets.
 The French constitution of
 1946 was endorsed by little more
 than one third of the voters,
 opposed by only slightly less,
 and ignored by the rest.   Con-
 trived by the overwhelmingly
 leftist postwar assembly, which
 was determined to assure the
 dominance of the legislature,
 the constitution compromised or
 complicated most legislative
 processes and perpetuated the
 ineffectiveness of the cabinet.
 Every premier under the Fourth
 Republic has paid lip service
 to the need for constitutional
 reform, but many either pri-
 vately opposed it or were so
 overwhelmed by day-to-day busi-
 ness that their proposals soon
 became dead letters.   In any
 event, the complexity of the
 amending process--the last amend-
 ment took four years--has mili-
 tated against any fundamental
 revision.
 Status of Reform Proposals
 Parliament in 1955 took
 the first step required for
 presently envisaged reforms by
 specifying the articles in need
 of amendment.  Despite the in-
 terest in action to complete
 revision now,  however,  the
 chances are against immediate
 improvement.   Wide divergences
 of opinion on the shape reforms
 should take have discouraged
 any strong drive for a change.
 Gaillard's plans call for
 the special unofficial parlia-
 mentary committee formed early
 in December to prepare a draft
 of recommended changes.   The
 committee represents only those
 parties which make up  his ma-
 jority, excluding from prelimi-
 nary stages the Communists and
 Poujadists,  who reject any idea
 of strengthening a democratic
 regime.  Gaillard has threatened
 to present his own reform bill,
 embodying measures for reinforce-
 ment of the executive power and
 redefining France's relations
 with the overseas holdings, if
 the committee fails to arrive
 at a decision.by 15 January.
 His proposals to strengthen
 the executive call for widening
 the power of the president of
 the republic to dissolve the as-
 sembly under certain conditions,
 modifying vote-of-confidence
 procedures, and ending legisla-
 tive initiation of expenditures.

 reduce government instability.
 Nearly every political party has
 at least one pet project, how-
 ever, and no one of the numerous
 reform proposals has majority
 support.   A group of deputies,
 allegedly supported by most non-
 extremist parties except the
 Socialists, favors a proviso sim-
 ilar to one in the West German
 constitution, requiring the ap-
 proval of a successor before a
 government can be overthrown.
 To counter negativism in
 the assembly,  the Socialists
 propose that the assembly have
 its own bills prepared before
 it can reject government pro-
 posals.   The Socialists have
 wanted to avoid appearing less
 leftist than the Communists in
 maintaining the supremacy of
 the assembly as the repository
 of political power, but an evo-
 lution in Socialist thinking
 may be under way as a result
 of Guy Mollet's experience as
 premier.   Shortly after his
 investiture in 1956,  he called
 on "the republican parties" to
 strengthen the executive with-
 out encroaching on parliament's
 power.
 Many conservatives agree
 with former Premier Paul Rey-
 naud's plan that reform must
 begin at the beginning by sim-
 plifying the method of amend-
 ment.   They would cut the re-
 quirement for a two-thirds or
 three-fifths majority on con-
 stitutional legislation.   Right-
 ist emphasis on the right of
 dissolution as the key to ade-
 quate reform has been somewhat
 reduced by Edgar Faure's unex-
 pected use of the power in 1955.
 The extremely fragmented assem-
 bly which resulted failed to
 show the gains expected by the
 rightists.
 Gaullist demands for a com-
 plete overhaul of the constitu-
 tion were intensified by the
 recent crisis, which occasioned
 an unusually strong flurry of
 rumors about the general's re-
 turn to power.   The official
 Poujadist position favors a
 strong executive under General
 de Gaulle.   The general himself
 is understood to favor putting
 deputies "on paid vacation" un-
 til'a new constitution is sub-
 mitted to public referendum.
 President Coty has stepped
 out of his neutral role to call
 for major constitutional reforms.
 His concern over the frequency
 of crises was dramatized by re-
 ports that he was seriously con-
 sidering summoning De Gaulle
 for consultations   and by his
 reported threat to resign if
 another crisis as grave as those
 of 1957 occurred soon.
 Electoral Reform
 The frustration of demo-
 cratic procedures by the con-
 sistently negative votes of
 200 Communist and Poujadist
 deputies has also quickened in-
 terest in electoral reform, but
 profound disagreement among the
 republican parties makes a reso-
 lution unlikely soon.   The sin-
 gle-district system, which con-
 servatives and Radicals favor,
 is opposed by the Popular Re-
 publicans, the Socialists, and
 the Communists, who prefer the
 existing system of modified
 proportional representation.
 The party-alliance subter-
 fuge adopted in 1951 to reduce
 Communist and Gaullist repre-
 sentation in the assembly broke
 down in the 1955-56 electoral
 campaign.   Some modification of
 the electoral law is in pros-
 pect, but Gaillard appears to
 have discouraged any hope for
 major changes by appointing a
 Popular Republican to handle
 the government's constitutional
 and electoral reform policies.
 There is little prospect of
 early results from a reported
 agreement last summer between
 Mollet and a prominent Independ-
 ent leader,  Senator Duchet,  to
 work for a two-party system.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 December 1957
 France's need for a decisive
 government and a redefinition
 of its "union" with its depend-
 ent areas.   Some of the fore-
 most advocates of constitutional
 reform part company over the
 future of Algeria.   The Social
 Republicans, who want a strong
 executive, are also adamantly
 opposed to relinquishing sover-
 eignty over Algeria.   One of
 the chief arguments cited by
 opponents of the basic statute
 recently adopted for Algeria
 was that it opened the gates to
 dissolution of the French Un-
 ion, and this position will be
 even more pronounced when the
 Council of the Republic debates
 the statute.
 Nevertheless, the original
 concept of a centralized French
 Union has already been over-
 taken by events, and the idea
 of some form of "federal union"
 between France, Algeria, and
 other French-controlled areas
 preoccupies all political ele-
 ments from the Socialists to
 De Gaulle.  One prominent poli-
 tician has pointed out that if
 the cumbersome provisions for
 amending the constitution had
 been followed to the letter,
 French Black Africa. might al-
 ready be in revolt.   The admin-
 istrative reforms railroaded
 through the assembly last year
 as "basic statutes" are suffi-
 ciently flexible to permit the
 complete political evolution
 of France's possessions south
 of the Sahara.  They may yet
 serve as a model for an under-
 standing with the ethnic Alge-
 rians.
 The "rectification" cam-
 paign in the Chinese Communist
 party--which is entering its
 final stage--has thus far re-
 sulted in the reassignment of
 perhaps half a million low-
 level party officials to menial
 jobs and, apparently in the
 downgrading of a few of the par-
 ty's leaders.   The campaign is
 expected to entail the expul-
 sion of thousands of party mem-
 bers, and may culminate in the
 arrest and punishment of two
 or three members of the party
 central committee.
 First Warnings
 A cleansing of the party
 was foreshadowed at the eighth
 national congress in September
 1956, when both Mao Tse-tung
 and Liu Shao-chi, number-two
 man in the  Peiping  regime,
 called for strengthening of or-
 ganizational work and "educa-
 tion" in the Communist ranks.
 In his report to the congress,
 Party Secretary General Teng
 Hsiao-ping noted that the party
 had grown eightfold since 1945,
 and that more than half its mem-
 bers had joined after "libera-
 tion" in 1949.   Teng declared
 that some party members, new to
 power, had become arrogant and
 independent--the error of "sub-
 jectivism."  Unfamilar admin'
 istrative responsibilities had
 made others prone to "bureaucrat-
 ism" and "sectarianism"--the
 latter a tendency toward unneces-
 sarily authoritarian methods.
 Efforts at party reform be-
 gan soon after the close of the
 congress and gained new force
 in early 1957, probably as a
 result of further reflection by

 Communist leaders on the dis-
 orders in Poland and the Hun-
 garian rebellion.   In February,
 Mao dwelt at length on the sub-
 ject of "contradictions" between
 the people and their leaders in
 a "secret" speech to the Supreme
 State Council.
 In March, party propaganda
 chief Lu Ting-i stated that a
 party "rectification" campaign,
 patterned on the 1942-44 Cheng
 Feng movement--a contraction of
 the Chinese phrase "cheng tun
 tso feng' meaning to correct
 the style or spirit of work--
 would begin "soon."  This was
 followed by a spate of edito-
 rials and official  statements
 on the question of solving con-
 tradictions through rectifica-
 tion, climaxed by a central com-
 mittee directive on 27 April
 formally launching a new cam-
 paign.
 The movement was slow in
 getting off the ground.   "Bloom-
 ing and contending"--the tech-
 nique of large group discussions
 and criticism prescribed as the
 main tool for rectification--
 was carried on in a "perfunc-
 tory" manner.  The rank and file
 responded without enthusiasm to
 a party directive issued in May
 calling on cadres to get close
 to the "masses" by performing
 manual labor.
 Peiping made a new call
 for "criticism" in May and re-
 newed requests that nonparty
 people help in correcting Com-
 munist errors.   The result was
 an outburst of criticism late
 in the spring attacking Commu-
 nism itself--both the party's
 monopoly of power and its basic
 program.   The attack seemed to
 take the regime  by  surprise,
 particularly when some members
 of the party became involved.
 Intensification of Campaign
 Peiping reacted by speedily
 redefining the limits of "criti-
 cism" in  terms  that left  no
 doubt that "liberalization" was
 finished, and by launching a
 massive counterattack against
 "rightists" inside And outside
 the party.   These measures
 brought expression of dissident
 opinion to an abrupt halt, and
 Peiping took a second look at
 the whole question of "recti-
 fication."                                                                   The result was a
 decision to broaden the Cheng
 Feng into a nationwide campaign,
 including non-Communists, and
 to adopt a tougher line on the
 question of party purity.
 Teng Hsiao-ping formalized
 the shift in September in a long
 report before an enlarged plenum
 of the central committee.    He
 spoke of the "extreme necessity
 of conducting a large-scale
 Cheng Feng movement within the
 fundamental column" of the Com-
 munist party.  While asserting
 that the party was basically
 healthy, Teng declared that par-
 ty members were committing dan-
 gerous errors.  Some Communists,
 he said, had been infected with
 "bourgeois individualism" and a
 few were "degenerate and cor-
 rupt."  Liu Shao-chi, Teng's
 boss in party matters, took a
 similar line in a major policy
 speech delivered on 6 November,
 ,in which he pointed to revision-
 ism as the "main danger" at
 present.
 Both Liu and Teng were care-
 ful to stress that mass debate--
 a technique closely linked to
 Mao himself--would be the chief
 method used in restoring the
 party to full health.   Their
 statements make it clear, how-
 ever, that the the old formula
 of "blooming and contending" had
 acquired a new interpretation.
 Teng compared public discussion
 during the rectification cam-
 paign to a purifying "fire."
 Liu used the same imagery, as-
 serting that "the flames of
 full and frank criticism will
 not only burn out the enemy, but
 our own shortcomings and mistakes
 as well."  Cadres who are loyal
 to the "socialist cause," Liu
 added, need not fear "being
 licked by the fire."

 the central committee.            The Com-
 munist press has boasted of the
 number of "opinions" brought out
 in mass debate, although the re-
 gime has complained that cadres
 are still afraid to encourage
 "basic" criticism.  Officials
 now are said to be responding
 with enthusiasm to the program
 for manual labor and  making
 progress in "improving their re-
 lations" ^vith the workers. A re-
 cent Peiping broadcast asserted
 that "many of the cadres who
 used to cover their noses with
 handkerchiefs when they came
 across a dunghill now scramble to
 -carry baskets loaded with dung."
 Peiping announced in early
 December that more than 810,000
 party and government cadres had
 been relieved of  their  posts
 and sent to  "production" jobs
 on farms     or in factories, and
 promised that the number still
 to be  transferred  would "far
 exceed" this figure.  Fragmen-
 tary information indicates that
 about half those demoted in this
 fashion have been party members.
 The campaign appears to be
 picking up speed in the middle
 reaches of party membership--
 the               300,000  cadres who hold
 posts higher than  country com-
 mittee members and whose achieve-
 ments Teng Hsiao-ping has called
 of "decisive significance" to
 the work of the party.
 On 5 December, Peiping re-
 vealed that Wang Han,a vice min-
 ister of supervision, an alter-
 nate member of the party con-
 trol commission,. and a party mem-
 ber for 25 years, is under at-
 tack for casting aspersions on
 Mao  and  opposing    Communism.
 People's Daily reported on 12
 December th-a-F-four senior offi-
 cials of the Supreme People's
 Court, of whom three are party
 members, have been denounced
 for opposing party leadership
 in legal matters.
 None of the top party lead-
 ers--that is, members of the cen-
 tral committee--has yet been ac-
 cused under the "rectification"
 campaign.   However, at least
 three seem to have been demoted
 this year, and one of them may
 have been dropped from the com-
 mittee.   In April, Tseng Shan,
 a deputy director of the govern-
 ment's important Fifth Staff
 Office--coordinating  work  in
 finance, currency, and trade--
 was apparently relieved of that
 post, and has been out of the
 news ever since.
 In June, Chen  Man-yuan,
 party first secretary in Kwangsi
 Province, was removed from his
 post for failure to distribute
 food properly, and may have lost
 his central committee post as
 well.   In August, Chen Yu, min-
 ister of coal industry, whose
 ministry had been under fire for
 insufficient production, was
 named to a largely ceremonial
 position as governor of Kwang-
 tung Province.
 Scope of the Purge
 The purge of the party--
 that is, the expulsion of thou-
 sands of its members, and the
 arrest of many of them--is not
 expected to claim as many casu-
 alties as the "reorganization"
 of 1951-54.   Teng  Hsiao-ping,
 who  will apparently  preside
 over the final phase of the
 purge, has himself acknowledged
 the importance of avoiding de-
 structive terror in the party
 ranks.   The operation appears
 to resemble painstaking and no
 doubt painful dentistry--the
 removal of decayed matter to
 save a tooth--rather than a
 dramatic extraction.  Whereas
 the 1951-1954 campaign resulted
 in the expulsion or forced res-
 ignation  from the party of
 about 10 percent of its members,
 no more than 5 percent are ex-
 pected to be dropped in the
 present campaign.
 The largest category of
 purgees will probably be those
 branded as "rightists"--a catch

 all charge covering all forms
 of revision of Marxist dogma in
 the direction of Western-style
 liberalism.   Most of those in
 this category will probably be
 intellectuals.  Teng Hsiao-ping
 last September observed that the
 party has absorbed "too many
 young intellectuals," and said
 that of the 1,880,000 party mem-
 bers with intellectual back-
 grounds, the great majority had
 not been "steeled in production"
 or put to the test of serious
 class struggle.   Other party
 members will be attacked and
 punished on general charges of
 sloth and incompetence in carry-
 ing out party policies, for
 specific failures, or for per-
 sonal shortcomings--corruption,
 abuse of authority, and the like.
 Two specific issues have
 been indicated by top party
 spokesmen as possible grounds
 for charges which may be made
 against more highly placed mem-
 bers of the hierarchy.   The
 first, put forward by Liu Shao-
 chi, concerns the attitude of
 party members toward rapid
 socialization.   Liu noted in No-
 vember that "vague doubts and
 rejection" of this policy by
 "some people" hinder the advance
 of the Communist cause.
 The second issue, indicated
 by Teng Hsiao-ping in his Sep-
 tember report to the central
 committee, is the formation of
 cliques and factions having
 personal loyalty toward a. spe-
 cific individual.   The Chinese
 Communists have been keenly
 alive to this problem since
 1954.   In his report, Teng de-
 clared that to have a "flush
 hand" of cadres--a term previ-
 ously used with reference to
 "kingdoms" within the party--
 was unwholesome at the country
 level, "not to mention this
 situation on any other level
 higher than the county.."
 Purge of Top Leaders
 Some high-level Chinese
 Communist party leaders, in
 addition to the three previously
 noted, are expected to be casu-
 alties of the "rectification"
 campaign.  Most of them will
 probably be demoted to less
 responsible posts--like the
 majority of lower-level members
 caught in the campaign--with-
 out losing their membership on
 the central committee, but a
 few will probably be dropped.
 Peiping may even choose
 to climax the campaign with the
 expulsion and arrest of two or
 three party leaders, just as
 the party "reorganization" of
 1951-1954 concluded spectacular-
 ly with the discovery of the
 "antiparty.  conspiracy" of
 politburo member Kao Kang--an
 alleged suicide--and party or-
 ganization director Jao Shu-
 shih--reportedly still in jail.
 Several central committee
 members have been out of the
 news for an unusually long pe-
 riod or have appeared in a
 curious fashion.   These in-
 clude:                                                         a member of the party
 secretariat; two deputy directors
 of major party departments, the
 organization, and the industrial
 work departments; the directors
 of two important government
 staff offices coordinating the
 work of various economic and
 political ministries; the chair-
 men of two important planning
 commissions; a few directors of
 major ministries; some secre-
 taries of provincial party com-
 mittees; and some military fig-
 ures, in Peiping and in major
 military headquarters elsewhere.
 While most of these persons are
 expected to appear sooner or
 later in good health and stand-
 ing, as has been the case in the
 past, their party and govern-
 ment posts are such that some
 of them could plausibly be ac-
 cused of the kind of errors that
 "rectification" seeks to expose.

 inner core of party leadership--

 is in doubt at this time is Chen

 COMMUNIST MILITARY POWER IN THE FAR EAST
 The Communist armed forces
 in the Far East, besides the
 Soviet forces in the area, con-
 stitute the three largest bod-
 ies of troops in the Sino-So-
 viet bloc:   the armies of Com-
 munist China,  North Korea, and
 North Vietnam. The Asian Com-
 munist forces have all been
 built up in recent years through
 large amounts of .direct and in-
 direct Soviet aid.  Following
 the recent talks between 12
 top-ranking Chinese Communist
 military officials and their
 Soviet counterparts, the USSR
 probably agreed to provide new
 military aid to Peiping.   So-
 viet Defense Minister Malinov-
 sky's statement that Moscow is
 willing "to transmit our ex-
 perience in the building up of
 armed forces to our Chinese
 friends" may also affect the
 development of the other Asian
 Communist armed forces.
 Ground Forces
 Total Communist ground
 force strength in the Far East
 is estimated at about 3,600,-
 000, or about twice the strength
 of the free world armies in the
 area.   These Communist armies
 are making significant efforts
 to improve their already superi-
 or military capabilities.

 gime's ambitious economic ven-

 most no chance that he will be
 purged or even formally de-
 moted at this time, it is con-
 ceivable that he is being slowly
 squeezed out of th  handful of
 top policy--makers.
 The USSR has built up a
 445,000-man force in the Soviet
 Far East despite the area's
 lack of economic or military
 self-sufficiency.   Concentrated
 in the Southern Maritime Dis-
 trict and the Lake Baikal area,
 they have the best of World
 War II-type equipment, presumably
 are being supplied with new
 weapons and equipment, and are
 believed to have a nuclear
 capability.
 Chinese Communist ground
 forces, which total about 2,600,-
 000, are deployed in strength
 along the coastal areas, with
 the greatest concentrations in
 Northeast, North, and East China
 opposite Taiwan.  Chinese mili-
 tary leaders have indicated
 they favor reducing the size
 of these forces while reinforc-
 ing them through modernization
 and re-equipment.

 Moscow for heavy and complex
 equipment,

 North Korea's army of about
 338,OUT_froops, the third larg-
 est in the Sino-Soviet bloc, has
 improved significantly in com-
 bat capability, largely as a
 result of extensive Soviet aid.
 Artillery firepower of the So-
 viet-equipped North Korean army
 is at least twice that of South
 Korea's.  Training continues to
 improve and includes simulated
 nuclear exerdises.   A large-
 scale corps-level maneuver was
 held in December  1956,   and
 large-scale winter field exer-
 cises may be                                                 a regular feature
 of the annual training program.

 The most significant weak-
 nesses of North Korea's armed
 forces are heavy reliance on
 the Soviet Union for virtually
 all major equipment and an acute
 manpower shortage which prevents
 any  substantial increase in
 the number of troops. Although
 North Korea  continues to in-
 crease its military capability
 through improved training and
 logistics, it will remain de-
 pendent on supplemental Chinese
 Communist manpower and Soviet
 equipment.
 Numerically inferior to
 South Korea's army, North Ko-
 rea's ground forces are sup-
 plemented by five armies of
 Chinese Communist troops num-
 bering about 300,000.   As many
 as six additional Chinese Com-
 munist armies could be deployed
 to North Korea on short notice.
 The army of  North Viet-
 nam, numbering about 300,000
 including 35,000 regional troops,
 is the weakest of the Asian Com-
 munist forces.   It is, however,
 pursuing a fairly rapid program
 of development.  With the fourth
 largest  ground  force in the
 Sino-Soviet bloc, Hanoi recent-
 ly began military conscription
 on a trial  basis in a manner
 reminiscent of Communist China's
 program in 1954.

 of total Soviet air strength--
 some 3,450 a rcraft representing
 all major components of Soviet
 military aviation--is based in
 the Far East, concentrated large
 ly in the Maritime territory,
 the Lake Baikal region, Sakhalin
 Island, and the lower Kurils.
 Soviet offensive and de-
 fensive capabilities have been
 improved during the past year
 by the introduction of BADGER
 (TU-16)jet medium bombers and
 BISON (MYA-4)jet heavy bombers.
 New aircraft also have appeared
 in fighter units.
 There has been no firm
 evidence of a deployment  of
 missiles to the Soviet Far East.
 The Chinese Communist air
 force has made remarkable strides
 since the Nationalist withdrawal
 and now ranks fourth, behind
 Britain, in the world in terms
 of aircraft in operational units.
 Since June 1950, its air strength
 has expanded from approximately
 350 obsolete planes to some 2,-
 500 modern aircraft.   Developed
 with Soviet material aid and
 policy guidance, the air force
 has attained ssi_gnifican:t mili-
 tary stature in its own right
 and has increased the Communist
 air threat in the Far East.
 Most Chinese air units are
 concentrated in Manchuria and
 a formidable offensive capabil-
 ity,   China's is the only non-
 Soviet Communist air force with
 a long-range bombing capability,
 although at present this'is
 limited by the possession of
 only 20 piston medium bombers.
 There have been numerous
 reports indicating a :substan-
 tial increase in the number of
 FRESCO (MIG-17) fighters.
 In the strategic Taiwan
 Strait area, the Chinese Com-
 munist air force has the capa-
 bility, barring American inter-
 vention, to establish and main-
 tain air superiority.   Although
 possessing adequate aircraft
 strength and air facilities for
 offensive purposes, the Chi-
 nese continue to maintain a de-
 fensive posture in the area,
 avoiding air operations which
 could be interpreted as warlike.
 There are no known air force
 tactical units based  on the
 China coast directly opposite
 Taiwan.   In the event of hos-
 tilities, however, the Chinese
 could rapidly deploy fighters
 and bombers to the area.
 North Korea has succeeded
 in building up--in violation of
 the armistice agreements--a
 modern jet-equipped air force
 overwhelmingly superior to that
 of South Korea.   The North Ko-
 rean air force  consists 'of

 three fighter divisions, one
 ground-attack and one light
 bomber division, and numerous
 technical and support units.
 It is equipped with an esti-
 mated 590 aircraft, of which
 over 400 are jet fighters.
 Some of North Korea's jet fight-
 ers are believed to be MIG-17's.
 North Korea's bomber divi-
 sion, estimated  to have  75
 BEAGLE (IL-28) jet and 30 BAT
 (TU-2) piston light bombers,
 has been based in Manchuria.
 Gradual transfer of the entire
 bomber force to North Korean
 bases is expected.
 Pyongyang has apparently
 placed emphasis on increasing
 its air defense capability, es-
 pecially near the demilitarized
 zone and along the east coast.
 North Vietnam operates
 a few   g-ht   aison and trans-
 port aircraft but has no air
 force.
 The USSR has considerably
 strengthened-its naval forces
 in the Far East during recent
 years by transferring warships
 from the European USSR and by
 building new vessels in the
 Pacific area, primarily in
 Komsomolsk.
 The main naval forces op-
 erate out of the major naval
 bases at Vladivostok, Sovet-
 skaya Gavan, and Petropavlovsk,
 while the remaining units are
 located in other ports in the
 Soviet Far East.  The princi-
 pal operating areas of this
 fleet are the Sea of Japan, and
 more recently the Sea of Okhotsk.
 . Long-range submarines of
 postwar design now constitute
 almost half of the USSR's Pacif-
 ic submarine strength.  A sub-
 marine possibly equipped  to
 carry and launch guided  mis-
 siles was sighted in the Sea
 of Japan in November  1956.
 This sighting was made only a
 few months after a similar one
 in the Baltic.
 Future Soviet naval expan-
 sion in the Far East is expected
 to feature submarines as the
 principal naval weapon.
 Communist China is making
 rapid strides lin-b-ulrding up
 its naval forces.   It has the
 most effective naval force of
 any Far Eastern power except
 the Soviet Union.   While the
 Chinese navy is at present prin-
 cipally a coastal defense force,
 its capabilities will show con-
 tinued improvement  as ship-
 building programs progress.   So-
 viet Riga-class destroyer es-
 corts have been under construc-
 tion at Shanghai's Hutung ship-
 yard.  Possibly four of these
 vessels have been launched.
 Also under construction are
 Kronstadt-class patrol craft
 and motor torpedo boats.
