 One year after the establishment of diplomatic
 ties, some of the bloom is off the rose in Sino-
 Malaysian relations.
 In addition to the well-known Malaysian unhap-
 piness with Peking's recent expression of support
 to the Malayan communists, there are signs that other
 relatively minor bilateral problems may be on the
 horizon.   Neither side has yet suggested, however,
 that it considers these problems sufficiently im-
 portant to jeopardize overall relations with the
 other country.
 Malaysian leaders almost certainly recognized
 at the time diplomatic relations were opened last
 summer that Peking would not soon abandon propa-
 ganda support of the Malaysian communists.   Prime
 Minister Razak, however, had enthusiastically re-
 ferred to Peking's commitment--made in the communi-
 que announcing relations--not to attempt to impose
 its social system on any other country.  Razak knew
 that fear of possible Chinese subversion was the
 major obstacle to opening ties, and he was anxious
 to show that progress had been'made on that score.
 As a result, he implied after his return from Pe-
 king that the trip signaled the end of Chinese sup-
 port to the communist rebels.
 The Chinese Communist Party's late April mes-
 sage of greetings to the Malayan communists--and
 especially its expression of support for "armed
 revolution"--hit a raw nerve in Kuala Lumpur.   The
 Chinese had been silent on the issue for more than
 a year, but Malaysian leaders almost certainly
 were concerned that the Chinese message would sug-
 gest to some that nothing had changed, despite rec-
 ognition.   This concern was probably compounded by

 the recent overthrow of non-communist governments
 in South Vietnam and Cambodia, and the slight in-
 crease in terrorist activities in Malaysia itself.
 Kuala Lumpur's strong protest and demands for
 an explanation from the Chinese have not got them
 far.   Although the Chinese ambassador in Kuala
 Lumpur was apparently personally distressed at the
 strength of the April message, his formal response
 to Malaysian protests was merely to express his
 government's opinion that the affair did not con-
 stitute a violation of Malaysia's sovereignty.  No
 formal apology has been extended.
 This incident together with increased contact
 between China's diplomats in Kuala Lumpur and the
 local Chinese communique have apparently convinced
 the Malaysians that a slap on the wrist is in order.
 Malaysia has decided to cancel the tour of a Chinese
 acrobatic troupe and postpone the visit of a trade
 delegation which was under discussion.   There is no
 evidence that the Malaysians expect any significant
 increase in Chinese support to the rebels, a develop-
 ment that would, of course, cause a much stronger
 Malaysian reaction.
 The Chinese seem to be persuaded that their
 interests would not be served by stepping up their
 involvement with the Malaysian communists.   In
 fact,

 arms or ammunition, despite his view that the sit-

 suggested that Peking was
 unhappy wi   Kuala  umpur's "Malayanization" program
 by claiming that Malaysia's leaders had broken an
 agreement, made at the time of independence, that
 allowed ethnic Chinese to "run the economy."

 added that this was a long-term problem
 an   that Peking must for the time being recognize
 the government and cooperate with it.
 In their bilateral trade relations, both sides
 appear to be less than completely satisfied with
 developments since recognition.   The Malaysian rub-
 ber delegation that recently visited Peking got less
 than an enthusiastic response to its request for in-
 creased Chinese rubber imports.                              Moreover, the out-
 look for increased Chinese imports is dim because of
 increased domestic production and the possibility of
 imports from other countries.   There also appears to
 be some Chinese resistance to Kuala Lumpur's at-
 tempts to cut out Singapore middlemen from the Sino-
 Malaysian trade.
 Despite these problems, both sides seem genu-
 inely interested in limiting the damage that these
 relatively minor conflicts might have on their de-
 veloping relationship.   The Malaysians recognize
 that their patience will probably be rewarded in the
 long run with gradually increased Sino-Malaysian
 trade, and the Chinese seem to be anxious to play
 down activities that might jeopardize their improving
 position in Malaysia.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/NO

 Peking has sharply criticized Prime Minister
 Gandhi's recent actions, leveling the harshest
 personal attack against her in some time and link-
 ing her moves to Soviet machinations in Delhi.
 In a signed article in People's Daily on June
 29, prominent foreign policy commentator Jen Ku-ping
 charged that:
 --The "sanctimonious" Gandhi govern-
 ment abandoned the pretenses of democ-
 racy and adopted repressive measures
 to enable the Prime Minister to remain
 in office against the popular will.
 --The Gandhi government has protected
 the interests of the Indian landed
 and capitalist classes and pursued
 reactionary domestic and foreign
 policies.
 --Mrs. Gandhi has guided India to eco-
 nomic ruin and famine despite her
 claim of Indian well-being.
 NCNA carried on June 27 a relatively straight-
 forward news account of developments leading up to
 a declaration of a state of emergency that made many
 of the same points although in less biting and sar-
 castic fashion and without much of the anti-Gandhi
 invective of Jen's commentary.
 The communist-owned press in Hong Kong went
 further than Jen by equating the emergency decrees
 to Hitler's burning of the Reichstag and lumping
 the Gandhi government with "cliques" in South
 Korea and Taiwan.

 The Chinese have paid special attention to
 Soviet backing for Mrs. Gandhi's actions.  NCNA
 on June 28 catalogued public expressions of Soviet
 support following Mrs. Gandhi's conviction for
 electioneering malpractices and her declaration of
 a state of emergency.   Jen was unsparing in his
 criticism of the Moscow-Gandhi linkage.  He charged
 that Mrs. Gandhi, "who has always received the sup-
 port of the overlords in the Kremlin," is attempt-
 ing to act as Moscow's "sub-regent" in South Asia
 so that the USSR can maintain its control of India
 and "contend" with the US for hegemony in the
 region.
 This Chinese treatment has highlighted the two
 greatest obstacles in Peking's eyes to a significant
 improvement in Sino-Indian relations:  Moscow's
 close ties in Delhi, particularly with the incum-
 bent regime, and Mrs. Gandhi's continued tenure
 in office.
 On this score,  the Chinese handled with discre-
 tion Mrs. Gandhi's conviction on June 12, issuing
 only two low-key NCNA reports which largely sum-
 marized foreign news reports.   Peking may have cal-
 culated that a heavy Chinese propaganda hand could
 only help her cause.   The Chinese may now believe
 that her tactics and open Soviet support will speed
 her departure from office and that propaganda on
 these developments is in Peking's interest.
 Peking has exercised some restraint, however.
 Treatment in China's media has not been profuse.
 The Chinese have not replayed any of Pakistan's
 sparse commentary on Mrs. Gandhi's actions and have
 not even hinted at the possibility of the Gandhi
 government using China to divert Indian attention
 from the emergency decree.   Peking obviously does
 not want to provide the Indians a pretext for attri-
 buting Mrs. Gandhi's actions to a threat from China
 or turning to Moscow for additional military assist-
 ance.

 The Chinese also want to avoid foreclosing
 completely the possibility of eventually improving
 relations.  Following the Sikkim crisis this spring
 --which brought to an abrupt end another promising
 move toward warmer ties--Foreign Minister Chiao
 Kuan-hua indicated that China and India were tradi-
 tional friends and that improved relations were
 "inevitable."   (CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DISSEM/BACK-

 Promoting Pyongyang
 While continuing to stress a moderate, non-
 military approach to the Korean problem, Peking is
 showing signs that it will provide strong support
 for North Korea's increasing diplomatic efforts
 to improve its own international position at Seoul's
 expense.   The immediate objective appears to be to
 gain the best possible showing for Pyongyang at
 the nonaligned conference in Lima later this sum-
 mer and in the UN this fall.
 Since President Kim I1-song's visit to Peking
 last April,  the Chinese have tried to portray
 Pyongyang as the more moderate and sensible of the
 two Korean regimes.  At the same time, the Chinese
 appear to have adopted a somewhat firmer position
 on Kim's claim to represent all of Korea.   Both
 stands are clearly intended to show Pyongyang that
 it has a friend in Peking and to contrast firm
 Chinese support with Moscow's less committed stand
 on these issues.
 Peking pointed up this approach in a June 24
 People's Daily editorial marking the 25th anniver-
 sary of the beginning of the Korean war.   The
 editorial refers to Kim's travels to Europe and
 Africa earlier this year,  and declares that "unity,
 friendship and cooperation" between North Korea
 and other countries has been strengthened as a
 result.   As it did last year,  the editorial also
 claims that Pyongyang's international prestige
 continues to grow daily.   Seoul, on the other
 hand, is depicted as responsible--at US instigation
 --for "constantly aggravating tension" on the
 Korean Peninsula.   The point clearly is that a
 moderate, peace-loving Pyongyang is winning friends--
 and votes--all over the world.

 Chinese officials have privately emphasized
 the same points in recent weeks as well as their
 desire for stability on the Korean Peninsula.
 The remarks were almost certainly made to counter
 the speculation about Pyongyang's intentions that
 arose in some Asian countries after Kim's visit
 to Peking.  The Chinese have been especially
 insistent that Pyongyang was not planning military
 moves against the South.  The other main emphasis
 of their remarks has been that Korea is a single
 country whose unification is inevitable and that
 Koreans must decide for themselves how to achieve
 reunification, without foreign interference.
 Peking continues to support Pyongyang's
 demands that US troops withdraw from South Korea,
 as a step toward eventual reunification.  The
 Chinese reiterated this stand in the June 24
 editorial, stating that US troops must be com-
 pletely withdrawn.  As in previous statements on
 this issue, however, no mention was made of a time-
 table for the withdrawal.
 The absence of any sense of urgency on this
 question was also reflected in the fact that this
 year's editorial did not call for an end to US
 military aid to Seoul, as the 1974 editorial had
 done.  This omission is especially remarkable in
 view of Defense Secretary Schlesinger's recent
 comments on the possible use of nuclear weapons
 in Korea, remarks that drew a strong North Korean
 reaction but have gone unmentioned in the
 Chinese press.
 It is not yet clear exactly how Peking's
 stronger support of Pyongyang's diplomatic
 objectives will affect Chinese tactics at Lima and
 in the UN.   In fact, the Chinese themselves may
 not yet have settled on a specific course of
 action.  As they have during the past two UN
 General Assembly sessions,  the Chinese will be

 walking a narrow path between their support for
 Pyongyang and their desire for stability on the
 Korean Peninsula.   The fact that the Chinese have
 not yet commented on the US proposal to dissolve
 the UN Command--made public nearly two weeks
 ago--suggests that Peking may not wish to place
 itself in public opposition to this US initiative.

 This is International Women's Year,  and the
 Chinese seem to be marking the occasion by bringing
 more women into the limelight and giving them
 positions of some responsibility.   At the same time,
 Chiang Ching, who for several years  as virtually
 the only woman of any real importance, remains
 well in the background.
 No current discussion of Chinese women on the
 political scene can ignore the sudden prominence
 of Li Su-wen, a 42 year old woman from Liaoning
 Province who has apparently moved her base of
 operations to the capital.   At the National People's
 Congress  (NPC)  in January, Li was elected a vice
 chairman, a relatively unimportant position in
 itself but one that has kept her in the limelight
 ever since.   She has frequently been involved in
 meetings with foreign visitors,  and most recently
 led the Chinese delegation to the International
 Women's Conference in Mexico.
 Li will very likely be awarded an important
 position in the Women's Federation, when that
 organization is re-established at the national level.
 A slightly ironic twist is that Li's sudden impor-
 tance apparently derives from her position as NPC
 vice chairman,  a job for which Chiang Ching re-
 portedly was nominated; Mao subsequently vetoed
 the appointment.
 Another woman who has received considerable
 publicity of late is Kang Ko-ching,  the wife of
 Chu Te.   Kang, along with the wives of Chou En-lai
 and Teng Hsiao-ping, has welcomed foreign visitors
 at Peking's guest house and was the woman selected
 by NCNA for an interview to mark International

 Women's Year.   The NCNA release lauded Kang's
 contributions to the revolution, including her
 participation in the Long March, and noted that
 she has worked ceaselessly to improve the lot of
 Chinese women ever since.        No such claims have
 ever been made about Chiang Ching, who has never
 been associated with women's causes and was a
 relative  latecomer  to the revolution.
 Although Chu Te is 89, Kang is only 65,  roughly
 the same age as Chiang Ching.   She seems to stand
 a good chance of outlasting Madame Mao on the
 political scene.   Kang was a vice chairman of the
 Women's Federation and will probably be re-elected
 to that post.   Chiang Ching was not a member of
 that organization and is not likely to become one.
 Because Kang's husband is Chairman of the NPC,
 which approximates the position of head of state,
 Kang is in essence China's first lady.   It is in
 this capacity that she greets foreign visitors at
 the guest house even as her husband,  in the absence
 of a head of state, accepts the credentials of
 foreign ambassadors.   As de facto first lady, Kang,
 of course, rivals Chiang Ching in much the same
 way as did Wang Kuang-mei,  the wife of former head
 of state Liu Shao-chi,  a woman whom Madame Mao
 openly despised.
 A third prominent woman is Wu Kuei-hsien, at
 one time merely a model worker.   She has risen
 above that status to become the only woman among
 China's 12 vice premiers and the only other woman
 on the Politburo besides Chiang Ching.   Wu has met
 with women's delegations, suggesting that she, too,
 will play a role in the Women's Federation.   In
 addition, she has assumed some foreign policy
 functions, most recently as co-host, along with
 Chang Chun-chiao, of President Bongo of Gabon.
 Wu is in her forties and could well be on the
 Chinese political scene for some time.

 Although none of these women have the clout
 that Chiang Ching enjoyed in her        heyday during
 the Cultural Revolution, nor do they equal her in
 official party status, they all seem to hold a
 variety of positions and appear to be in better
 political health today than she is.   (SECRET NO
