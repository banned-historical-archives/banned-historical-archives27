SECTION I (SOVIET) 
"B" USSR. HICOG Study Concludes that the USSR Will Not Risk War During Next  
Few !ears. A study by the Peripheral Reporting Unit in Frankfurt reviews 
those general factors which restrain and those which encourage the USSR 
in a policy of aggression sufficient to risk instigating a general war. 
Several factors are numbered on the restraining side: (1) The low morale 
of the Soviet citizenry resulting from (a) post-war disillusionment over 
continued police-state controls; (b) the unfavorable comparison of Soviet 
and European life which many soldiers made first-hand during the war; 
(c) hostility of the population +o the regime, manifested by an apathetic 
attitude of passive indifference and caused by agricultural collectivi-
zation, low standard of living, stringent labor restrictions, and the 
policy of thought-control,particularly among the intelligentsia (d) the 
official anti-religious policy; (3) the gulf between the Party leaders 
and the masses; (f) a general prevalence of war-fear engendered by the 
privations and hardships of World War II; (g) a certain degree of discrimd-
nation against the non-Great Russians. Dissatisfaction in the services is 
engendered among the enlisted men by his law material standard in com-
parison with the officers, among the latter by the surveillance of the 
ubiquitous MGB and political officers, and among both by the tight con-
trols maintained over life in the occupation armies. (2) The cam. 
paratively low industrial potential of the USSR?lamong which outstanding 
weaknesses are a low rate of steel production, an inadequate network of 
rail and road communications, serious deficiencies in machine-tool con-
struction and a lack of adequate reserves' of skilled workers. (3) Soviet 
population trends which in the future will more and more favor the mil-
itary age potential of the USSR over the US. CO The conservatism of 
Soviet society resulting from the solidification of a social? structure 
which favors and is completely controlled by the bureaucracy. (5) The 
continuing undereurrent of Western popularity, despite the propaganda 
campaigns. (6) The non-aggressive, peaceful character of the Russian 
people, whose greatest military exploits have traditionally been in 
defense of their own soil and who seem to have little native predi-
lection toward militarism and regimentation. 
Among those factors which militate for aggressive policy the 
report notes: (1) The need for certain raw materials, notably oil and 
uranium; (2) Anticipation of increasing hostility towards the regime 
resulting from the inability of the government toloth increase the 
standard of living and the rate of war production; and (3) The sheer 
lust for power on the part of the leaders. 
The influence of the officer caste, Russian imperialist tram. 
dition, and the desire to maintain internal unity by fomenting foreign 
wars are all rejected as serious stimulants to aggression. The

implacable hostility for the non?Soviet world postulated by the doctrine 
of Cammunism may over a long period shape a policy different from one 
based on a drive for political power alone, However, Moscow's current 
interpretation of Communism, which favors the position of the USSR above 
all, is pragmatic, flexible and opportunistic to the point that it is 
presently indistinguishable from a plan of action followed by any nation 
bent on a patient, reasoned policy Of world conquest. In this senses 
the decision to begin general hostilities in anticipation of an eventual 
attack by the West must from the viewpoint of self?preservation appear 
unwise. 
oen, the Soviet leaders in anticipation of an eventual Western 
attack -oepA79 rather thaa immediately begin general hostilities, con?
tinue to concentrate on their own defenses and simultaneously weaken 
the strength of the West. It is just such a policy which the USSR has 
followed, the Korean war being no exception. The study concludes that 
deterrents !outweigh stItgr)i, and that overt Soviet aggression involving 
a risk of all?out war is not likely for several years at least. 
EASTERN EUROPE. CZECHOSLOVAKIA. Hi h Level Meet? in Praha Discounted. 
Despite reports from Berlin that a high level Soviet?Satellite meeting 
to discuss West German rearmament had been held concurrently with the 
recent liberation ce)_ebratione in Praha, the US Ambassadors in Praha, 
London, and Warsaw report that there is no evidence available to them 
to support this information. C Praha 7019 25X1 
8 May 51; C London 5857, 10 May 51D R Warsaw 8759 9 May 51). COMMENT: 
Rumors of high?level Soviet orbit policy meetings have circulated when?
ever sit Elite dignitaries have gathered to celebrate Communist hol?
idays? A notable decrease in Communist propaganda on the subject of West 
German rearmament during the past fortnight tends to detract from the 
possibility that such a meeting was held. However, unpublicized policy 
meetings of satellite leaders presumably have occurred from time to time. 
CZECHOSLOVAKIA?HUEGARX. Iadastrial Ceoperation cement Si ed. On 
27 April representatives of the Bnngarian and Czechoslovak Planning 
Offices signed a long term industrial cooperation agreement. The US 
Legation Budapest believes that the move may be a major step toward 
integration of the Bnmgarian?Czeohoelovak economies, apparently on a 
bilateral basis. No direct reference was made to a permanent committee 
of economic collaboration; but something of this nature is presumably 
envisaged. (S MA 2514 B'pet, 4 M),, COMMENT: During the first few 
years after the war the USSR emphasized the integration of the various 
Eastern European economies with its own. This agreement, which appears 
to be of the same type as that already in effect between Poland and 
Czechoslovakia, is apparently an indication of a trend toward extend?
ing intra?orbit cooperation between the Satellites themselves.

"B" RUMANIA  Labor Unrest WiC.8B-P73 . Evidence of the continuing difficulties 
confronting the Rumanian Goverment in its drive to whip labor into line 
is contained in repo rts of reeaht manifestations of 'ret furnished to 
the US Legation. The at epeatacala was a "symbolic" strike of railway 
workers in Bueharest in March uhieh affeeted a small section of local 
rail services and"lasted only a few hours. The immediate cause was said 
to have been the removal of ration privileges formerly granted to railway 
workers. As a result of this denenstration, Gheorghiu-Dej, Vice Premisti 25X1 
and Seeretary General of the Weekeaesv Party, addressed a mass meeting of 
rail worksrs in ah attempt to bolster morale. Reports 
state that this formerly palmier leader of the 1933 rail strike was booed 
and heckled. Order was restored 'ey the Militia and mumeroas arrests were 
made. The Legation farther states that the mass firing of white-collar 
workers (001 Daily Digest, 27 Apr 51) has added considerably to the 
ral worker diseentent. The Legation believes that such manifes-
tations of dissatisfaotion will resalt only in stronger repressive mea-
uuree accompanied by a heightened propaganda campaign urging workers to 
redouble their effects in the stauggle for "peace". (C Bucharest D-362? 
10 Apr 5l). COMMENTs Intelligence frem the East European satellites 
poists-to widespread belt apathetic labor discontent in the fa coi of 
increasing Communist p-esduetien quota l; which are not accompanied by any 
improvement in the etandard ef living. This discontent, however, lacks 
any effe-)tive meane of expression ad has thus far been effectively coped 
with by Communist measures largely of a repressive nature, but on occasion 
involving minor concessions. 
YUGOSLAVIA? Unidentifipd Satfmari.E2=2102WialagolajkLAILL... Yugoslav 
Deputy Cbief of Staff Admiral Malicia has informed the US Naval Attache 
in Belgrade that twe sightings of ones, possibly two, unidentified sub-
marines were made on 6 May near the islands of Lastovo and Vis in the 
Adriatin within the Yugoslav six mile limit. The US Attache reports 
that, when Admiral Manela was infunred that the submarine was not 
American, he was visibly upset and stated that he had hoped that it would 
have been a US sabnariLe. Manola morimeatwailttethere was no reason why

SECTION 2 (EASTERN) 
GREECE. GimtlIpiattptii2ld Combined Maneuvers with US and UK Navies. 
According to press reports, US, UK and Greek naval units will.hold., 
combined maneuvers in Greek waters during the summer. The first phase 
of the exercises will take place in June, the second in August. (U New 
York Times, 11 May 51). COMMENTa The Free Greek Radio, broadcasting 
from Bucharest, has already seized on this topic as another indication 
of US and UK plans for the Balkans. The Communist Radio reiterates 
that all this warlike activity of the monarohofascist proves that the 
Americans are-in a hur/y to start the war in the Balkans". This con-
tinuing theme is indicative of the Soviet concern over any strengthen-
ing of the Greek or Turkish defensive potential? 
Ar IRAN. EaaAlleedlOrfersIranAssitceiran-i0i1loitation. 
According to a French broadcast, higb--placed British sources report 
that the USSR offered technical assistance to Iran in the exploitation 
of its nationalized oil fields. Soviet Ambassador Sadchikov reportedly 
made the offer to Prime Minister Mossadeq during his visit last week. 
The report does not speotfy whether Mossadeq accepted. (R FBID, 11 
May 51). A US Navy message states that  claims 25X1 
confirmation from several low grade sources of press reports that 
Sadchikov proposed to the Iranian Prime Minister the formation of a 
new Iranian oil compary in the North. The refinery would be built with 
Soviet aid and the products sold exclusively to the USSR. (R FBIS 
Ticker 11 May 5l S CINCNELM 081431Z May 51). COMMENTa Neither of 
these reports is confirmed, and they are probably just rumors. While 
the USSR undoubtedly wishes to profit from the current friction be-
tween the UK and Iran, Prime Minister Mossadeq has shown absolutely no 
sign of wishing to make a dealwith the USSR. While affirming the 
necessity of obtaining the aid of foreign oil experts, the Prime 
Minister would undoubtedly prefer to employ non-Soviet technicians. 
It is accordingly unlikely that any offer of Soviet help mould be 
given serious consideration until other possibilities had been ex-
hausted. 
Tudeh Demons esAirst US. According to the US Ambassador 
in Tehran, several thousand persons held an "orderly and well disci-
plined" demonstration in front of the Edbassy on 11 May demanding 
"peace" and calling upon the US to "stop aggression in Korea". The 
demonstrators proceeded to Parliament Square wherea, according to press 
reports, these "Partisans of Peace", who were actumlly members of the 
pro-Soviet Tudeh party, hailed Stalin, denounced "Anglo-American 
Warmongers", and demanded the immediate expulsion of the US military

mission to the Iranian Army. (U Tehran 2759, 11 May 1951; U New 
York Times, Washington Post, 12 May 1951). COMMENT: While the 
press has given figures of 10.2000 and 60,000 demonstrators, past 
experience indicates that the press tends to exaggerate such oc-
currences. Demonstrations and press campaigns may be expected as 
the Communists take ad7antage of Prime Minister Mossadeq's stand 
on freedom of expression and assemblage. If he clamps down on 
these activities, or if the situation further deteriorates, the 
Tudeh may resort to more extreme measures. The emphasis by the 
Tudeh on the expulsion of the US military mission (See OCT Daily 
Digest, 9 May Si).may have unfortunate repercussions for Iranian-
US relations. 
INDIA.. India Barters for Soviet Wheat. Or 11 May, according to the 
New Delhi press, an official spokesman of the Goveruilent of India 
announced that the GOI would pay in barter - not cash as previously 
announced - for the 50,000 tons of wheat recently obtained from the 
USSR. (See OCI Daily Digest 10 May 51). The terms of the agreement 
are still being negotiated but, nevertheless,, the USSR has dispatched 
the first cargoes. (R FBIS News Ticker, 11 May Si). COMMENT: In

early April, the Indian press reported that the USSR was willing to 
barter wheat to India in exchange for atomic materials, tea, rubber 
and jute. Prime Minister Nehru, in a speech to Parliament on 10 
May, announced that a fundamental part of India's foreign policy was 
not to supply atomic materials to foreign Countries. Since tea, 
rubber and jute are in short supply, it is uncertain as to what 
commodities India is prepared to supply to the USSR in exchange for 
wheat. 
"13" INDOCHINA. LAgionsairee Assault Vietnamese in Hanoi. The throwing 
of a grenade in Hanoi precipitated a brutal assault by French 
Foreign Legionnaires on Vietnamese passersby. The explosion caused 
a slight leg wound to one Legionnaire and in retaliation others 
rushed from several quarters and assaulted all operators of pedi-
cabs (a sort of rickshaw). One operator was beaten to death on the 
spot, others Injured. A dozen or more pedicabs were maliciously 
daMaged. Questioning of a French MP sergeant elicited the informa-
tion that the grenade had actually been thrown by a drunken 
Legionnaire. The story of the incident is spreading rapidly 
through Hanoi. (0 Hanoi 653, /1 May 51). COMMENT? The Foreign 
Legion has had a highly unsavory reputation in Indochina for 
more than two deoades. This ineident can only serve to inflame 
anti-French feeling among the native population. 
"A" CHINA. Reduced Role of MAO Tse-tunganizItol. Publisher of a 
major pro-Communist newspaper in Hong Kong has informed a US 
consular officer that MAO Tse-tung "retired from active administra-
tive work" over two months ago in order to resume "Writing on 
theory." Source states that Premier CHOU En-lai is directing 
the government while Viee-Chairman LIU Shao-chei and Central 
Committeeman CH?EN Po-ta are handling Party affairs* ConGen 
surmises that MAO would be unlikely to withdraw from active 
participation in the regime unless compelled by illness or 
"displacement," and that source's account may be for consump-
tion by the Party rank-and-file. (C Hong Kong 3351, 11 May 51). 
COMMENT? Although MAOgs appearance at the May Day festivities 
in Peiping dispelled rumors of his death or critical illness, 
there have been persistent reports of his poor health, as well 
as rumors of his displacement by other Party leaders. There is 
no evidence that MAO is out of favor with the USSR or with his 
Party comrades; ha ,;:'cnttnaes, to be praised in extravagant terms 
by both. However, reposts of his failing health appear to be 
supported, to some degree, by his non-appearance in public 
through all of February, March and April, and by indications of 
his inability to accept certain prisate engagements. It is possible 
that illness has inded or compelled MAO to reduce his role in 
the regime's affairs* In each an event, major changes in Peiping's

Hong Kong, it is becoming apparent that the chief Communist 
purchasing agents are transferring their activities to other 
areae, particularly India. Ae a result of the increased number of 
Hong Kong export contrcis, many items (military trucks, tires, 
metals, and others) are no longer readily available in the 
Colony. (S Hong Kong 3354, 11 May 3951). CONT s Hong Kong's 
impounding several days ago of 51 Dodge trucks destined for 
China gave further evidence to the Communists of the declining 
usefulness. of Hong Kong as a source of supply fer strategic 
items. 1 Ihave reported that the Communists have 
been anticipating that Hong Kengge export controls would get 
progressively stricter and have, therefore, stipulated early 
delivery in their recent contraete. It has also been reported 
that recent Commanie, procaremetl activities in India ere moti-

COMMENTs The DOI Daily Digest of 8 May reported large-scale 
arrests in Shanghai on 27-28 April. The public security 
officialus statement connects the two arrested Americans. with a 
specific office of US intelligence in China. The Communists have 
imposed severe punishment including death sentences upon 
non-Americen personnel who they haw aaeueed of working for 
that office, and they may now be prepared to execute US nationals

"9" KOREA. Smoke Sereen:Shieldo Communist Movement. The 12 May 
intelligence telecon from the US Far at Command reports a 
28-mile smoke sereen running east-west north of the North Korean 
town of Hwaehon. Considerable enemy troop movement was detected 
in this area on 11 May. An additional smoke screen of unreported 
size is also reported meeethwest of Seoul in the Munsan area. 
(S DA CINCFE Telecon 4704 12 May 1951). COMMENTs Utilization 
.of smoke screen by the enemy in Korea denotes the urgency of 
whatever troop mevement is being concealed. The general 
Communist practice has been to M076 troops only at night. A 
similar smokstreen in mid-April covered the entry of the 
Chinese Communist 34 and 9th Army Group into the battle zone 
prior to the 22 April ofteneive.

chon river) and t) another airfield under construction at 
Sunchoa (northeast of P.eengyaeg). (S DA CINCFE Telecon 4704p

SECTION 3 (WESTERN) 
WESTERN EUROPE. Schuman Plan Ratification Is Delayed by French  
. Political Situation. Although the bill for French ratification of 
TETTEhuman Plan was submitted to the Cabinet 9 Mays prior to. 
presentation to the National Assembly the end of this weeks par-
liamentary action will be postponed until sometime after the June 
elections and the organization of the new Parliament--at least 
until mid-August. Government mishandling may cause additional 
postponements, although Monnet intends to press for immediate 
action when the new Assembly meets. Delegates of the six participating 
countries have informally exchanged ratification documents. 
The Netherlands 
plans ratification before the end of Parliaments session on 20 July, 
and the other Benelux countries ratifications are being held up 
by technical difficulties. As yet, there is no indication of 
proposed Italian action. (C Paris 6808, 9 May 5l)., COMMENT: The 
opposition in France can be expected to pose a serious threat 
regardless of the composition of the next Assembly. 
Proaallalcultural Pool Not To Be an  Extension  
of the Schuman Plan. The French architects of the proposed European 
lagricultural pool'--a long-term plan to improve European food 
supplies?have told US officials that it is not consistent with two 
basic principles of the Schuman Plan. The "green pool" would be 
regulated not by governing organs exercising authority above the 
national governments but by a central body wielding limited powers 
under the supervision of member governments. Secondlys the proposed 
pool would make no attempt to apply rules to all concerned on an 
equal basis. Present plans therefore do not suggest a "logical 
extension of the Schuman Plan"9 and US Embassy Paris regards it as 
entirely possible that the "pool" will develop into a comprehensive 
organization which will be quite compatible with US interests. 
(C Paris 68359 10 May 51). COMNENTg US concern over the possible 
effects of the proposed "pool" on US agricultural markets has been 
based largely on the assumption that the French expected to follow 
closely the organization of the Schuman Plan. French Minister of 
Agriculture Pflimlin anticipates that after the French June elections 
each country participating in the pool conference will present its 
own detailed plans for the type of organization to be developed.

ITALY. Communists Maneuver for General Strike. Following the 8 May 
strike of Government workers the most nearly complete such strike 
ever attempted), Di Vittorio, Secretary General of the Communist 
General Confederation of Labor, reportedly warned that if the right 
of civil servants to strike is suppressed by pending parliamentary 
legislation, all Italian workers will be called upon to support 
the fight of these workers. For the moment, however, the majority 
of workers in the Communist and non-Communist unions appear to favor 
the resumption of negotiations with the Government. Press reports 
indicate that the Government will not apply sanctions against the 
strikers as previously threatened. (U. Rome 5063, 10 May 51). COMMENT: 
Di Vittorio has maneuvered so adroitly that, if the Government mis-
handles the situation, the stage will be prepared for a Communist-led 
general strike. Also, in view of the impending municipal elections, 
the Government will probably be forced to some compromise measure 
instead of the bill restricting the right of civil servants to strike. 
This Communist opportunity, like others in the past, derives basically 
from the absence of a strong non-Communist labor movement, independent 
of political alignments, and-thereby free to work for purely economic 
objectives. 
Break between Nenni,Socialists and Communists Unlikely 'A. 
25X1C ethis'Tite.el pietto Nenni, 
leader of the philo-Communist Socialists (PSI), has discussed with 
Togliatti the increasingly delicate position of his party as a 
result of its subservience to the Italian Communists ?(PCI) and their 
Cominformist activities. Nenni stated that he might have to re-
examine his own political orientation and that he mIghtmove toward 
the position' of the non-Communist Unitary Socialist leaders Romita 
and Silone. He objected to the PCI control of the "peaediorganizations 
on the grounds that it has alienated the sympathies of the middle 
class and many Socialists. - Togliatt12s reaction included a threat 
to discontinue PCI support of the FSI. Relations between  the two ? 
25X1A' ? leaders are strained. . COMMENT: 
There has been no previous indication of friction between Nenni and 
Togliatti or of any disagreement on Nenni2s part with PCI policy. 
At the National Congress of the PSI in. January 19519 Nenni succeeded 
inputting through a program of complete subservience to PCI policies 
and in silencing a few voices raised in protest.

an organ of the MSI only this week accused the Pope and Catholic 
Action of having "betrayed" Italy during and before the waro

"anti-Catholic sectarianism" and that the Social Movement should

about establishment of correct relations with the Catholics. CU 
NY Times, Rome, 12 May 51). COMMENT: The comments of Osservatore

elections. (See 001 Daily Digest, 7 May 510)

DENMARK. Government Disturbed by Publicity about US Request on 
Conscription. The Government is "profoundly disturbed" 
extensive'publicity resulting from a "leak" to the press of the 
US request for lengthening of the Danish conscription period. 
The request was generally presented in the press as a US ultimatum 
upon which arms aid is contingent. (S Copenhagen 960, 10 May 51; 
and P Copenhagen 959., 10 May 51). COMMENT: Public and parliamentary 
discussion of the US request will undoubtedly delay the passage of 
the defense bill and-the-ratification'of the Greenland defense treaty, 
but Parliament will eventually pass both measures. (See OCI Daily 
Digest, 11 May 51). The Government, in addition to its usual fears 
of counter moves by the USSR, also apparently fears that the alleged 
US "ultimatum" will stimulate public antipathy to further US-Danish 
cooperation. 
ARGENTINA. Government Controls Tungsten, Beryl., and Mica Trade. 
An 8 May 51 decree has placed trade in tungsten, bery ? and mica 
under government control, for two years. All stocks and future 
production must be sold to the government at stipulated minimum 
prices, and the official Trade Promotion Institute (IAPI) will be 
the exclusive exporter of any exportable surplus. (U Buenos Aires 
987, 9 May 51). COMMENT: Tightening controls over these strategic 
minerals is an attempt to maximize quid pro quo benefits from their 
exportation. Argentina will use these minerals to bargain for imports 
of scarce machinery and materials.

DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTERS, CONFERENCE 
USSR Offers Another C,ounte:71.E12222?11_12E_Zatigallinistersi Conference  
In the 10 May session Soviet delegate Gromyko proposed an agenda for a 
Foreign Ministers, meeting based on a Western alternative proposal sub-
ject to three qualifications: that German demilitarization be listed 
first as an agreed sub-iten, that a Soviet proposal on North Atlantic 
Treaty bases be added as another unagreed point, and that the order of 
items be examined, In a typical long propaganda harangue Gromyko re-
emphasized the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union as contrasted with 
aggressive Western policies, such as the North Atlantic Treaty and con-
tinuation of Western defense measures while the deputin were meeting. 
COMMENT: Or 2 May the Western Powers introduced three separate alterna-
tive proposals as their maximum effort to mike possible a Foreign Minis-
ters meeting, Gromyko's latest tactic represents an attempt to capital-
ize on Western concessions in two of the proposals and thus to approach 
the original Soviet agenda demands, On 4 May Gromyko "accepted" the first 
Western proposal provided that the Soviet position on reductions of arma-
ments, limited to those of the four powers, be accepted,(C, S/S Paris 6856, 
11 May 51).

GREECE. Greek Request for US Intercession with UK on C us Re'ected. 
The Department of State has instructed the US Etbassy in Athens to inform 
Prime Minister Venizelos that in view of US conviction that the Enosis 
.(Union o Cyprw with Greece) question should not be raised at this time, 
the US considers it inappropriate to approach, the UK on this subject. 
(See DCI Daily Digest, S/S Supplement 4 and 8 May 51). Cyprus has been 
proposed for the agenda of the colonial talks which the US and UK hope 
to hold in the near future, Britain, according to the Department of 
State, may be prepared during these talks to consider the renewal of the 
offer of self-government and dual nationality, The Embassy is advised to 
give no encouragement whatsoever to the Greek Government concerning a 
quick soluticm, pending indications that the UK is willing to make a con-
cession on thie matter. (S, S/S, State 4224, 9 May 51). COMMENT: While 
the Greeks may be disappointed over the US reply, they will not be sur-
prised at it. Moreover, their failure to obtain US support at this time,

will undoubtedly not discourage them from trying again. It is unlikely 
that a British offer of self-government for Cyprus would quiet Cypriot 
pressure for Enosis. Th a British attempts in 1547-48 to interest 
Cypriots in self-government failed because of Cypriot refusal to accept 
anything short of Enosis. 
SAUDI  ARABIA. US Interest in Dhahran Air Fie/d Agreement. The State 
Department has infermed US Ambassadorare in Jidda that General Day, 
who has been in Washiagton on consultation, will soon rejoin Hare in 
the resumption of the US-Saudi Arabian military negotiations, which have 
reached a delicate and, the Department hopes, a final stage. Since the 
Dhahran Air Field is increasingly important in US strategic thinking, the 
Department is interested in an early agreement. Because Saudi Arabian re-
action to current Angle)-Egyptian differences (on the Suez and Sudan issues) 
has largely been responsible for eliminating the possibility of a long-
term arrangement, the US is ready to accept a much shorter agreement. The 
Department adds that the UK has been informed concerning the general nature 
of the approximately V0,000,000 military grant aid program for the Near 
East and concerning the fact that Saudi Arabia will receive the largest 
portion of that aid as a result of US special interest in that country. 
(TS, S/S, State to Jidda, 380, 10 May 51). COMMENTg The conclusion of an 
early agreement to extend US military rights at the Dhahran Air Field has 
become more important as the result of ae.'f:^m"tlriation of Near East problems 
which have all come to a head in the last few months. The position of the 
US and UK in the Near East is more complicated now than in 1550, not only 
ae the result of the Anglo- Egyptian impasse, but also as result of recent 
events in Iran and the development of the bitter border dispute between, 
Syria and Israel.
