 VIETNAM WEEKLY REVIEW
 FBIS TRENDS
 14 JANUARY 1970
 INTRODUCTION
 At the 49th session of the Paris talks on 8 January PRG deputy delegation
 head Dinh Ba Thi devoted the bulk of his prepared statement to the
 Vietnamization policy; the VNA account observes that Thi rejected the
 Nixon Administration's contention that this policy is the "correct"
 way for the United States to get out of the war "regardless of what
 happens on the negotiation front."  DRV deputy delegation head
 Ha Van Lau, according to VNA, said that since the Nixon Administration
 had been unable to reach its goal of negotiating from strength, it has
 emphasized Vietnamization and regarded the search for a negotiated
 settlement as secondary.  Vietnamese communist media have not acknowledged
 that Ambassador Habib revived the proposal for restricted sessions--first
 advanced by Ambassador Lodge at the 40th session on 30 October--and
 that the communist delegates denounced the proposal in their rebuttal
 statements.
 Moscow continues its criticism of the Vietnamization policy and alleged
 U.S. stalling at the Paris talks.  Unlike Hanoi and Front media, TASS
 reports that the U.S. delegation at Paris again proposed "restricted
 talks" and that the DRV spokesman at the post-session press briefing
 denounced the proposal.  On 12 January a domestic service broadcast
 briefly notes the announcement that the Army 1st Infantry Division is
 to be withdrawn from South Vietnam, calling the move a "meaningless
 symbol."
 Peking's NCNA on 7 January summarizes the 31 December "special" PLAF
 command communique rounding up 1969 communist "victories."  The summary
 includes the statistics on alleged allied casualties and notes the
 criticism of Vietnamization and the call for continued fighting until
 v?L'tory.  Peking's only other current substantive attention to Vietnam
 comes in a 13 January NCNA summary of a PEOPLE'S DAILY article,
 atl,ribute.d to Fan Ti, which discusses the advice given President Nixon
 by "the British nonentity, Robert Thompson."  The article says the President
 in his 15 December TV address had quoted from Thompson's report to the
 White House the statement that the United States is now in a "winning
 position," but it claims that Thompson had merely rehashed "old
 strategies"developed under Kennedy and Johnson.
 Vietnam propaganda on military action in the South focuses particularly
 on the northern provinces, with VNA on the 13th summarizing a NHAN DAN
 article which hails a "new victory" on 5 January in Quang Nam Province.
 The PLAF reportedly "annihilated" 400 U,S. Marines in this -ction at
 Cam Doi.  The article also cites a series of attacks from 3 to 6 January

 in the highlands and central Trung Bo region.  The state of reviews
 of communist "victories" during 1969 continues with additional
 ;!rticles in the DRV army organ QUAN DOI NHAN DAN attributed to "True
 Caien" (hand-to-hand combat).  Liberation Radio from 11 through
 13 January broadcasts a three-installment article on Vietnamization
 by "Cuu Long" (Mekong).
 Hanoi propaganda on DRV internal affairs Includes reports of various
 recent meetings which heard speeches by Politburo members:  Truong
 Chinh spoke at a meeting of correspondents of the weekly THIEU NIEN
 TIEN PHONG (YOUNG PIONEERS) on the occasion of its 15th anniversary;
 Pham Van Dong addressed a meeting of the 4th Congress of Representatives
 of the Vietnam National Union of Students; and Le Thanh Nghi spoke on
 food and consumer goods production at a meeting of the Haiphong
 People's Municipal Council and City Administrative Committee.
 PARIS TALKS:  RESTRICTED SESSIONS, "VIETNAMIZATI0N" POLICY
 SILENCE ON         The Vietnamese communist accounts of the 49th session
 U.S, PROPOSAL      of the Paris talks on 8 January fail to acknowledge
 that Ambassador Habib, in a supplementary statement
 after his formal presentation, repeated the proposal for restricted
 sessions originally made by Ambassador Lodge in his formal statement at
 the 30 October session.*  Suggesting that the next session on
 15 January be a restricted one, Ambassador Habib proposed that the
 number of advisers be limited--he suggested that there be three, that
 each spokesman could raise any subject, and that an agreed statement
 be issued to the press.
 In noting that both Ha Van Lau and Din Ba Thi spoke in rebuttal, the
 VNA account says simply that they "severely criticized and refuted
 the absurd demands of the U.S. and puppets' representatives.  They
 stressed that the United States must bear full responsibility for the
 prolongation of the war in South Vietnam and the deadlock of the
 Paris conference."  There is thus no acknowledgment that they denounced
 the restricted-session proposal.
 ALLIED       The VNA account of the session acknowledges some of the broad
 SPEECHES     themes of GVN delegate Nguyen Xuan Phong's formal statement
 when i'; says he "repeated the slanderous charge that the
 North committed aggresoion against the South and that North Vietnam is
 unwilling to stop the war and unwilling to .ego;iate.  He claimed that
 *  The VNA account of 6he 30 October session took note of the Lodge
 proposal in reporting the communist side's rejection of it.  See the
 TRENDS of 5 November 1969, pages 6-7.

 the Thieu-Ky-Khiem puppet administration is a legal representative and
 that in the past year it had shown goodwill and a serious attitude at
 the Paris conference."  VNA, of course, ignores such details of these
 broad charges as Phong's assertion. that 80 percent of the communists
 operating in South Vietnam are sent by Hanoi and his statement that
 'the communists' scheme to take advantage of the Paris meetings to
 embark on so-called diplomatic offensive" is shown in Resolution 9.*
 VNA also ignores Phong's appeal for a discussion of secondary matters
 in order to "create a relaxed atmosphere and to generate mutual
 confidence."
 The VNA.account of Ambassador Habib's statement is characteristic of
 the standard cursory treatment when it notes that "the acting head of
 the U.S. delegation again tried. to justify the U.S. crime of
 aggression and cover its maneuver to prolong thp. war and downgrade the
 Paris conference."  VNA adds that "at the same time, he deliberately
 eluded the two basic questions in the 10-point overall solution of the
 NFL and PRG, namely the total and unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops
 and troops of the other foreign countries in the U.S. camp from South
 Vietnam, and the setting up of a provisional coalition government in
 South Vietnam."  VNA thus ignores Habib's reference to specific allied
 proposals and his discussion of his attempts to obtain clarification
 from the communist side on such things as the relationship of points
 two and three in the NFLSV 10-point proposal. on the withdrawal of
 U.S. and North Vietnamese troops.
 DINH BA THI ON     PRG delegate Dinh Ba Thi, again substituting for the
 1IETNAMIZATION    reportedly ailing Mme, Nguyen Thi Binh,** devoted the
 bulk of his formal statement to attacking military,
 political, and economic aspects of Vietnamization.  He repeated the
 contention that the ARVN is not capable of taking over from U.S. Forces,
 and he claimed in this regard that during 1969 400,000 South Vietnamese
 government personnel were put out of action and that, "according to
 *   This was the third successive session at which the GVN delegate referred
 to COSVN Resolution 9, the document captured in July which presents a
 general assessment of the situation in the South and sets out broad
 guidelines.
 ** When a U.S. reporter at the PRG press briefing after the session
 asked whether Mme. Binh was better since she was known to have made a
 public appearance, the PRG spokesman merely repeated that she had the
 flu.   As usual, neither DRV nor Liberation Front media carry the accounts
 of any of the post session: press briefings by the four delegations.

 -4-
 reports from Saigon," 180,000 deserted.  He alleged that in areas where
 ARVN units have assumed combat responsibility, they were so heavily
 attacked--at Bu Prang, for example--that the Americans had to come to
 their assistance.  As a result, he said, U.S. forces continued to e.,gage
 in combat and their casualties increased.  Thi cited and took issue
 with official U.S. figures on casualties--78,292, a decrease of
 35 percent as compared to 1968--and repeated without attribution the
 claims in the "special" PLAF command communique that, 235,000 Americans
 were put out of action during 1969, a 5,000-man increase over 1968.
 Much of the detail of Thi's statement, including the figures on
 American casualties, do not appear in the VNA account.*
 Concerning the political aspect of Vietnamization, Thi routinely described
 the United States as attempting to "prettify" the "Thieu-Ky-Khiem
 'administration."'  In quoting Saigon press characterizations of the
 government as "corrupt," Thi recalled--though this is not reported by
 VNA--that President Nixon on the other hand had "extolled" Thieu as
 one of the four or five "eminent statesmen in Asia."  VNA notes Thi's
 standard description of the accelerated pacification operations as
 "terrorizing, massacring" and committing other "crimes."  But VNA does
 not report his statement that they "strike directly, forcibly concentrate
 and tightly control the population, allegedly to destroy the Viet Cong
 infrastructure," and that they then "produce phoney statistics about the
 so-called control of the Saigon administration over South Vietnam."
 11hi called the strong economy which the Vietnamization plan seeks to
 ouild a "sheer illusion" and similarly questioned how this "beggar"
 economy, based entirely on the war and American aid, can become strong.
 He saw the GVN's economy at present as stagnating and experiencing
 serious inflation that has caused a difficult life for the people
 living under its "temporary" control.  VNA reports his concluding
 appeal to the United States to "respond seriously to our logical and
 reasonable proposal and engage in genuine negotiations so as to settle
 the Sou?.; Vietnam problem promptly instead of pursuing the illusion of
 winning a military victory and a position of strength through the
 erroneous way of VietnFunizing the war."
 HA VAN LAU ON     The VNA account of DRV Ambassador Ha Van Lau's state-
 U,S~ POLICY                               ment notes his denunciation of the U.S. policy of
 "negotiating from strength" and says he recalled
 previous statements made by President Nixon and Secretary Laird in
 this regard.  VNA reports Lau's reference to President Nixon's order
 *  Liberation Radio departed from what has been its standard practice
 and did not broadcast a full text of the PRG delegate's formal state-
 ment at the session.  The account is generally identical with that of
 VNA, although with some more detail on Vietnamization.

 on "maximum military pressure" against the "liberated" areas of South
 Vietnam.  It also notes his recitation of other stock war escalation
 charges--that the number of battalion-size or larger-size sweeps had
 increased as compared to the number under the Johnson Administration,
 and that there had been increases in the number of air attacks sorties
 and the use of toxic chemical spraying.
 VNA reports Lau's denunciation of the Nixon Administration's opposition
 to the proposals made by the DRV and PRG delegation at the talks and of
 Washington's "clinging" to its positions on mutual troop withdrawal and
 maintenance of the GVN.  VNdA's account does not, however, give the full
 flavor of Lau's remarks dealing with the U.S. attitude and position.
 It does not report his characterization of "all" proposals of the Nixon
 Administration on the Vietnam problem--whether in the President's
 14 May eight-point program or in proposals made by the Saigon government
 as an embodiment of'the United States' "obdurate and impudent position"
 regarding the "two crucial questions of a political settlement,"
 the issues of a U.S. troop withdrawal and the South Vietn.  se people's
 right to self-determination.
 VNA does not acknowledge Lau's reference to early U.S. proposals on
 such specific questions as the restoration of the DMZ and the
 prisoners-of-war issue.  And it similarly fails to report Lau's
 comment that Habib at the previous session put forward "nothing but
 the so-called question of prisoners of war."  Consistent with Hanoi's
 silence on the issue, Lau did not mention that the United States at
 that time released a list of missing U.S. military personnel in
 Southeast Asia and again asked Hanoi for a list of U.S. prisoners
 in the DRV.
 VNA notes that Lau concluded his remarks by pledging to "continue to
 denounce the dark schemes of the Nixon Administration" and to continue
 the "Just struggle of the Vietnamese" if the United States refuses to
 engage in serious negotiations.
 MOSCOW ON PARIS TALKS, TROOP WITHDRAWAL. MCCARTHY TOUR

 delegation proposed holding "restricted" sessions and
 that DRV press spokesman Nguyen Thanh Le denounced the proposal as

 "sabotage" the talks.  On the 12th the Moscow domestic service
 briefly attributes to the New York TIMES a report on American efforts
 to "pressure" the 1)RV and PRG delegation at Paris by,insisting on
 "limited" talks and the abolition of post-session press conferences.

 When. Ambassador Lodge first proposed "restricted talks" at the 30 October
 Paris session, TASS duly reported the remarks at the session and the
 post-session briefing, and a 1 November IZVESTIYA article scored the
 proposal, as a "maneuver" to conceal aggression and to prevent any
 progress at the Paris talks,
 TROOP WITHDRAWAL    A 12 January TASS report of Secretary Laird's TV
 interview the previous day ignored his comments on
 troop withdrawal, stressing instead that he tried to "hush up" ROK
 "atrocities" in South Vietnam.  On the Lame day, however, a domestic
 service broadcedt does report the announcement by the U.S. Command that
 the Army's 1st Infantry Division is to be ~rithdrawn.  The report calls
 the move a "rleaningless symbol" consilering the "snail's pace" at which
 troops are being withdrawn.

 said he discussed "Soviet-American relations, including economic

 informed about reconstruction in Moscow during a visit to the Executive

 saw Mme. Binh in Paris for talks on "ways toward a political solution"
 of the Vietnam problem; and on the 14th TASS reports the communique on

 Vietnamization policy, expressed support for the NFLSV's 10-point program,
 and highly assessed the effort of the antiwar forces in the United
 States which demand a speedy and complete withdrawal of U.S. troops.
 CONTINUING COMMENT ON VICE PRESIDENT AGNEW'S ASIAN Th,UR
 HANOI AND     Vietnamese propaganda continues to criticize Vice President
 THE FRONT     Agnew's Asian trip, highlighting anti-U.S. demonstrations

 10th mention the demonstrations in the Philippines, Nepal, and
 Afghanistan, also citing protests made by Americans stationed in
 several countries he visited.

 Quoting the Vice President as saying in Saigon on 1 January that the
 Vietnamization policy "is correct and being successfully implemented,"
 Hanoi radio on the 10th claims that the communists' 1969 "victories"
 have shown that Vietnamization has "failed."  The broadcast further
 claims that while Agnew praised the GIs, in fact they are "getting
 more and more fed up" with the war and the antiwar movement is
 spreading among them, causing "worry to the Washington rulers."
 Agnew's trip to Saigon, Hanoi says, "reaffirmed the U.S. commitment
 to Asia in order to tranquilize the puppets" who were afraid the
 Americans would abandon them under the new Asian policy.  Liberation
 Radio echoes this line; the broadcast further says that Asians cannot
 be fooled into fighting Asians and that President Marcos of the
 Philippines was finally "forced" by the people to withdraw the Filipino
 troops from Vietnam.  It concludes that the "failure" of Agnew's trip
 is a "result of the great and comprehensive failure of the Americans
 in South Vietnam."
 MOSCOW     Moscow continues to assert that Vice President Agnew is
 trying, during his Asian tour.. to "sell" the President's
 "Guam doctrine" to reluctant Asian states.  A 7 January IZVESTIYA
 article by Kudryavtsev* says Agnew has been saying what President Nixon
 could not say--that the Guam doctrine does not essentially change the
 aggressive intentions of President Johnson's "Asian doctrine" which
 proclaimed a U.S. intention of establishing dominance in Asia through
 Asian regional groupings.  Kudryavtsev notes that Agnew assured
 Philippine President Marcos that the United States intends to "maintain
 its positions" in the Pacific, emphasized in Thailand that there would
 be no changes in U.S. obligations to Thailand and Southeast Asia, and
 assured Chiang Kai-shek that the United States would fulfill its
 obligations to its allies.  Kudryavtsev cites the Washington EVENING STAR
 for the conclusion that the United States seems to be trying to apply a
 policy of "Vietnamization on a global scale."  Thus, says Kudryavtsev,
 the United States is trying to quiet U.S. public opinion with talk of
 Vietnamization and troop withdrawal while seeking to use Asian reactionary
 regimes to counter the Asian national liberation movement.
 NFISV/PRG TOURING DELEGATIONS IN INDIA, AFRICA

 "cordial talks" with Prime Minsiter Gandhi, External Affairs Minister
 Dinesh Singh, and Foreign Secretary Kaul.  India has not recognized
 the PRG and the only mention of the subject in available communist
 propaganda is in a 10 January IZVESTIYA article on the visit;
 IZVESTIYA says that during the delegation's stay the Indian press
 "frequently" put forward demands for the recognition of the PRG and
 the establishment of diplomatic relations with the DRV.
 LPA on 8 January reports that an NFLSV/PRG delegation led by Le Quang
 Chanh visited Zambia--which also has not recognized the PRG--from
 27 December to 5 January.  Chanh's group had previously visited
 Tanzania after touring Iraq, South Yemen, and the Sudan.
 DRV DIRECTIVE ON TET CELEBRATIONS
 Hanoi radio on 9 January reports that the DRV Premier "recently" issued
 a directive on the celebrations of the "Canh Thant" Lunar New Year
 Festival, Tet.  The directive calls for "Joyful" celebrations but also
 says that it must be a Tet "of resistance for national salvation and
 socialist construction."  As in previous years, the instructions
 call on the population "to practice thrift, maintain vigilance, and
 be ready to plunge into work and production with a new, stirring
 revolutionary spirit."
 The broadcast notes `hat the Standing Committee, of the Council of Ministers
 has granted one-and-a-half days' leave to cadres, workers, and civil
 servants--the afternoon of New Year's Eve, 5 February, and the first day
 of the first lunar month, 6 February.  It adds that workers will also
 be off Saturday, 7 February, but will work in compensation on Sunday,
 8 February.   (In 1969, after the bombing halt of the DRV, Tet was
 celebrated in the North for two days; in 1968, the year of the Tet
 offensive, available propaganda gives no indication of time off for
 celebrations; and in 1967, comment notes that in "some areas where
 work was unfinished," only half a day was given for celebrations.)

 young people "to correctly comply with the five teachings"* of President
 Ho.  Noting that a small number of students have been slow and
 undisciplined learners, Chinh blames such "responsible organs" as
 families, schools, and society in general for not coordinating closely
 to edr;cate them.
 Saying that THIEU NIEN TIEN PHONG must be a "propagandist, an educator,
 and an organizer" of teenagers and children, he explains that currently
 the core of the paper's tasks consists of educating youths about ethics.
 Among other things, he says, the paper must advise them "to help the
 organs responsible for maintaining security and order in struggling
 against these bad elements, and to be vigilant against the hooligans
 and counterrevolutionaries, . .          "
 PRAM VAN DONG     On 10 January, VNA reports that Politburo member
 Premier Pham Van Dong recently visited the 4th Congress
 of Representatives of the Vietnam National Union of Students and "had
 cordial conversations with the participants."  Hanoi radio on the 9th
 broadcasts Dong's remarks at the meeting, which it says was held on
 6 and 7 January. Dong recommends to the students that they "endeavor
 in study and training to become men and women both Red and expert as
 President Ho Chi Minh wanted."  He goes on to urge the students to
 seek the best methods to further their study, since building socialiom
 requires "many able and skilled workers" and since a contingent of
 scientists and technical cadres must be trained and fostered.
 LE THANH NGHI      Hanoi radio on 10 January reports that on the 5th
 the Haiphong People's Municipal Council and City
 Administrative Committee held a conference at which Politburo member

 the trends and tasks of the 1970 State Plan," Nghi discoursed on
 Haiphong's responsibility in food and consumer goods production for
 1970.  He reportedly also dealt with the production emulation drive to
 overfulfill the 1970 State Plan which was launched on 31 December in
 Hanoi.

 SINO-SOVIET  RELATIONS
 F,BIS TRENDS
 14 JANUARY 1970
 MOSCOW SHARPENS ATTACK ON CHINESE; PEKING ISSUES PROTEST
 Stung by recent Chinese propaganda and resentful toward renewed Sino-
 U.S., contacts, Moscow has lifted its restraints on polemics to
 deliver a sharp attack centered on the Chinese war preparations
 c8mpoign.  In a widely disseminates. TABS report dated 9 January and
 In other comment, Moscow has charged that the Maoist regime is
 fostering a "military psychosis" in an effort to overcome internal
 strife and to purge elements conciliatory toward the Soviets.  At
 the same time, Moscow has conveyed its displeasure over recent
 contacts between the CPR and the United States leading to the agree-
 ment to renew the ambassadorial talks in Warsaw this month.  The
 triangular relationship also figures in a CPR protest charging
 that the Soviets have coordinated with the United States in
 promoting a two-Chinas plot.
 On the same day as the TASS report, Peking unofficially gave its
 version of the deadlocked Sino-Soviet talks in response to Western
 news reports from Moscow portraying the Chinese as taking a hostile
 stance at the talks.  Again using the Hong Kong paper TA KUNG PAO
 as a channel for leaking their views on the talks, the Chinese
 claim that the deadlock is the result of the Soviet side's refusal
 to honor an agreement allegedly reached by Premiers Kosygin and
 Chou En-lai in September calling for military disengagement along
 the border.  The TA KUNG PAO report, citing "well-informed circles,"
 complains that the Soviets have not "put any restraint" on their
 armed forces, but it does not charge that there have been incidents
 along the border.  The report seems designed to shift the burden of
 blame from the Chinese for the evident lack of progress in the talks
 and to reassert the priority Peking has placed on the need for
 military disengagement.  Appearing in an "extra" edition one day
 after the CPR-U.S. agreement to resume the Warsaw talks, the report
 may also have been timed to put added pressure on the Soviets.*
 Moscow has used a favorite device of its own--remarks to correspondents
 by Foreign Ministry spokesman Zamyatin--to announce that the Peking
 talks are continuing and to indicate Moscow's interest in keeping them
 *  Previously Peking implied a link between the Sino-Soviet and the
 Warsaw talks.  in NCNA's international service in English on 14 December,
 a report on the departure from Peking that day of chief Soviet negotiator
 Kuznetsov was immediately followed by a belated report on the
 11 December Warsaw meeting of the CPR charge d'affaires and the U.S.
 ambassador.

 alive.  TASS on 13 January quoted Zamyatin as saying the talks "are
 continuing and it is yet early to sum up their results."  Soviet
 comment on Chinese war preparations and anti-Soviet propaganda has
 not spelled out any implications for the talks, though the 9 January
 TABS report took note of an NCNA report describing propagandists
 operating "close to the Soviet borders" who have been explaining
 Mao's directives on war preparedness.
 MOSCOW ON CPR      The 9 January TABS report on Chinese war
 MILITARISM         preparations--carried in the central press and
 widely broadcast--represents the sharpest Soviet
 polemical attack since the moratorium on criticism of China was
 imposed in the wake of _ Kosy_gin's meeting._with.. Chou in_ September.
 It also contains the first direct attack on Mao during this period.
 Denouncing the Chinese war preparedness campaign an an effort to
 promote "chauvinist sentiments and military psychosis," TASS says
 Peking's purpose is to overcome disunity in China and to consolidate
 the ranks of the "Maoists."  The report reacts sharply to recent
 Chinese propaganda attacks, assailing Peking's New Year's Day
 joint editorial--which denounced Brezhnev directly--.as containing
 "particularly vicious anti-Soviet attacks."  Evincing growing Soviet
 iripatiencc', TABS charges that Chinese propaganda portraying a Soviet
 threat ("absurd concoctions" that have been rehashed "for several
 years already") has recently been presented "morejns stently than
 ever."
 In referring to the "Maoists"--while avoiding the once-standard formula
 "Mao and his group," a code-term implying a faction without
 legitimate authority--the PASS report probes possible dissension in
 Peking's higher councils.  TASS goes so far as to revive mentioJL
 Chinese communists who allegedly favor good relatims- r th_the_,Soy~,gt
 Union bu?  L$~  hn.ye snfferP   rP=riagla  for-their attitude.  According
 to the report, the Maoists have {.yoked the specter of a Soviet
 threat as a pretext for refusing to reinstate these communists in the
 CCP.  TASS singles out a Chinese commentary on two opposed views on
 war, carried in the domestic service and PEOPLE'S DAILY on 24 December,
 as part of the campaign "glorifying militarism and chauvinism in the
 spirit of Mao's ideas."  That commentary had assailed what it
 described as the revisionist view that there is a reasonable group
 within the enemy camp.   As TASS notes, the commentary approvingly cited
 Chiang Ching, a figure generally associated with radical elements
 that might be expected to insist on an intransigent line toward the
 Soviets.
 The TABS attack is followed up on successive days by articles in
 IZVESTIYA and PRAVDA charging that Peking's behavior has harmed the
 communist cause.  A Yakovlev article in the 10 January IZVESTIYA

 morning edition, citing Peking as an example of the damage caused by
 "the rupture of proletarian internatiunaliom," charges that "the
 aLmosphere of war hysteria" being created in China plays into the
 hands of anticommun},ot propaganda.  A similar theme is developed in
 PIZAVI)A'o 11 January ?,nternational review by Kolonnichonko, who
 denounces "the great-power, advonturistic, anti-Soviet course"
 pursued by Peking for inflicting great damage on the communist move-
 ment.  Kolcunichenko describes the Chinese war preparations as being
 "obviously provocative in nature" and refers to "another wave of
 anti-Soviet hysteria" in the CPR.
 While significantly intensifying its polemical pressure, Moscow has
 also sustained its indirect attacks on Maoist doctrine in broadcasts
 beamed to China. In the regular Mandarin program for the PLA, a
 broadcast on 10 January argues in behalf of peaceful coexistence while
 rebuking those who call for a "revolutionary war, which is allegedly
 to eliminate a global thermonuclear war"--an allusion to a principal
 slogan in the Chinese war preparedness campaign.  Dismissing views of
 unnamed theor'ticians concerning "people's war" against a nuclear-armed
 enemy and "defensive warfare" designed to entice the enemy into an
 unfavorable position, the commentary attributes these views to a need
 to cover up the economic and military weaknesses of "those countries
 which advocate such a theory and their lack of a genuine military
 theory."
 Moscow uses its purportedly unofficial Radio Peace and Progress as an
 irritant to Peking by informing the Chinese people of the CPR's
 recent dealings with Yugoslavia.  Citing a report by a TANYUG
 correspondent in Peking, a Mandarin broadcast on the 12th reports that
 a Yugoslav freighter entered the port of Shanghai and was unloaded at
 an "unprecedented" speed.  The broadcast plays up the hospitable
 reception accorded this ship's first visit tc Shanghai.
 SOVIET-CPR-U.S.     Moscow has displayed its resentment and suspicion
 TRIANGLE            toward renewed Sino-U.S. contacts, characterized
 as Washington's "flirting" with Peking in order to
 advance U.S. interests.  According to TASS on 8 January, the weekly
 LIFE ABROAD carried articles on this alleged flirtation from the
 foreign press together with a comment by I. Kravchenko denouncing
 "the perfidious attempts by militant circles" in the United States
 "to complicate relations" between Moscow and Peking.  Soviet comment
 on Vice President Agnew's Asian tour has also played on this theme,
 as in the observation by IZVESTIYA commentator Kudryavtsev (in the
 8 January morning edition) that the U.S. aim is to exploit Chinese
 dissidence in the interest of Washington's new Asian policy.

 them on the name page,  The timing of the TASS report nuggeoto that
 Sino-U.S. developments are a factor in Moscow's intensified polemics.
 Poking has also given vent to its suspicions in the triangular
 relationship, charging that Soviet media's coverage of Vice
 President Agriew's visit to Taiwan provided support for an alleged
 U.S. plot to create two Chinas.  A CPR protest to the Soviet Union,
 dated 9 January and released on the 11th, strains to cite evidence
 from Soviet coverage of the visit indicating that Moscow regards
 Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan as a country.  Taking the occasion to
 denounce the "Soviet revisionist social imperialists" for being
 hostile to the Chinese people, the protest claims that Moscow is
 mounting a "new anti-China campaign."  This protest may have been
 provoked by snide observations in Soviet media that Peking had not
 reacted to the Vise President's affirmations of support for Chiang.
 ULAN BATOR:  MPR NOT A PAWN IN SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT
 An article in the Mongolian paper UNEN, carried on 9 January by TASS
 and PRAVDA, betrays sensitivity to the MPR's delicate position in
 the Sino-Soviet confrontation.  Setting out to "expose the slanderous
 ftabrl%;at ions" c,.ntaired in a UPI report which aimed at "undermining
 %ngolia's international authority," the LINEN article declares that
 even though "fraternal international assistance was rendered by Soviet
 Russia" the Mongolian people themselves, under the leadership of the
 party, gained their freedom and independence in 1921.  UNEN insists
 that "no outside farce proclaimed our country's independence" as
 alleged by UPI.  Denying a statement in the UPI report that the
 existing treaty with the Soviet Union is "a treaty for rendering
 military aid," the paper says that on the contrary "it represents
 an historic document which is strengthening and deepening the ties
 of fraternal friendship between our countries and is promoting close
 cooperation in all ;;,.41Qres of the economy and culture."
 With respect to alleged UPI statements that "when Mao Tse-tung and
 his communist supporters came to power in China many considered that
 Mongolia would again become a part of China" and that "Mongolia's
 location predetermined its fate to be a pawn in the struggle between
 Russia and Red China," UNEN charges that the UPI correspondent "failed
 to conceal the fact that he was one of those 'many people' who hoped
 Mongolia would again become part of China."  Noting that Mongolia
 does border "on two great countries," the LINEN article states

 MIDDLE EAST
 USSR CONTINUES TO CRITICIZE U.S, MIDEAST PROPOSALS
 Soviet propagandists continue to assail the U.S. proposals for a
 Middle East settlement as Israel-orientod and as diverging fram tho
 November 1967 Security Council resolution, which is preosed as the
 "only acceptable, basin" for resolving the conflict.  At the same
 time, Moscow displays some sensitivity to Western press assessments
 that it is to the Soviet Union's advantage to prolong the conflict,
 as well as to speculation that there had been some measure of Soviet
 approval of the U.S. proposals and that Moscow has now changed its
 position with regard to the "Rhodes formula" on indirect Arab-Israeli
 negotiations.  Moscow argues that "procedural questions" such as the
 form of any negotiations should be set aside in favor of working out
 the "assence of concrete principles" for implementing the Security
 Council resolution.
 Comment tends to sidestep the question of official French involvement
 in the affair of the Israeli gunboats taken from Cherbourg despite
 the French embargo on arms to participants in the 1967 war; nor does
 Moscow  address itself to Paris' intentions in connection with French
 arms deliveries to the Arab countries.  Moscow pictures France as
 under heavy pressure from the United States and Israel to give up
 the Mirage talks with Libya, and Israel is said to seek "confrontations"
 between France and the other three powers in order to "cause disarray
 among the countries which want to see a settlement."
 U.S. PROPOSALS     A critique of the U.S. proposals by Primakov in the
 14 January PRAVDA, as reported by TASS, seem3 to
 follow the lines of the 23 December Soviet response to the United
 States as described in the U.S. press on 13 January.  Primakov charges
 the American press with trying to prove that "there had supposedly
 been some changes" in the U.S. position on the Middle East question
 and with trying to find additional means of pressure against the Arabs.
 Complaining of "impudent falsifications" by American "propaganda,"
 Primakov cites an article by Joseph Alsop who "alleged in the Washington
 POST that the American proposals on the Middle East conflict had been
 tentatively approved" by the Soviet Union.  Avoiding an outright
 denial, Primakov says that the "latest strategem of U.S. diplomacy"
 was prompted by increasing dissatisfaction with American policy in
 all Arab countries.  He assesses the American plan as shifting from
 attempts to arrive at a "concerted formula" among the four powers for
 implementation of the November resolution, designed to facilitate the
 mission of U Thant's envoy, Jarring, to "a purely formal resumption
 of this mission."

 cunuultn+,ions,PASS notes that Primakov in conclusion referred to
 bosh the Big Four and bJlutaral discussions and urged "continuation
 of the efforts of the Big Four powers" to find the best ways of
 praw:tical implementation of all the resolution's provisions.
 I car.t,ing defonuively to the idea that Soviet interests would be
 better nerved by prolonging the Middle East conflict, Kudryavtsev
 declares in the 11 January IZVESTIYA that behind Washinkton's
 propusals lay a desire to spread the notion that "prolonction
 of the war wa;; supposedly in the interests of the Soviet Union,
 which allegA-tly is using it to 'advance its influence' in the Near
 East," as well as a desire "to accuse the Soviet Union of everything
 and thereby attempt to weaken its growing authority among the Arab
 countries and peoples."
 Kudrynvtsev accuses the United States of "patently deviating" from
 the Security Council resolution, whose "prime condition" is
 unconditional Israeli withdrawal.  He ticks off complaints about
 the proposals regarding the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza, Sharm ash-Shaykh,
 and Jerusalem, concluding that if one follows Secretary Rogers, "only
 bits and pieces" of the resolution remain.  He derides the legality
 of Israel's territorial claims, pointing ouL that Israel'-, borders
 prior to 5 June 1967 "do not correspond with those defined by the
 UN decisions of 1947," when the state of Israel was created; "the
 Arab countries could have claims against Israel, if they were guided
 by the justice which Israel and Washington are hypocritically shouting
 about."  (The 1947 partition boundaries were described by PRAVDA's
 Belyarev, in a May 1969 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS artic..   as the only
 Israeli boundaries that could be "legally recognized.")
 Noting that the American proposals are addressed to the UAR and
 Jordan separately, "generally excluding Syria," Kudryavtsev maintains
 that the proposals aim, as does Israel, at achieving direct
 negotiations with each Arab country separately to compel them to
 caritulate.  Some Soviet comment in late December had described the
 '~.S. plan as consisting of three separate proposals--far the UAR,
 JorcI i, and Syria.

 RHODES      A remark by Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Zamyatin, at
 FORMULA     his press conference reported by PASS on 13 January, rejects
 Israeli interpretations of the Rhodes formula on Israeli-Arab
 negotiations as being "direct talks," but--like the few prior propaganda
 references to the formula--is careful not to rule out such negotiations
 altogether.  Zamyatin, TASS says, denied that the Soviet Union had
 changed its position on the Middle East and accused Alsop of misinter-
 preting the Soviet position regarding the "so-called Rhodes formula."
 TASS explains that this formula appeared in 1949 "during the conclusion
 of the Egyptian-Israeli cease-fire agreement," the text of which "was
 agreed on with the mediation of UN representatives."  But the "actual
 meaning now read into this formula," TASS says, is shown by Israeli
 contentions that the Rhodes talks "had allegedly been 'direct' talks."
 Zamyatin declared that the Soviet Union had never recognized such an
 interpretation.  TASS adds that "after the 'Israeli explanations,' the
 United States-is again bringing forth as one of the main questions the
 so-called 'Rhodes formula''; by talking about the form of negotiations,
 the United States and Israel want to supplant the "main issue--the need
 to agree on the main principles" of a Middle East settlement on the
 basis of the November resolution.
 PRAVDA's Belyayev rejects the Rhodes formula along the same lines.  In
 the Moscow domestic service commentators' roundtable program on
 11 December, he explains that the formula is unacceptable to the Arabs,
 "particularly since the Israelis have said that direct talks were
 supposed to have taken place" on Rhodes in 1949.  Thus he appears to
 leave open the possibility, much as Zamyatin does, that such talks
 might be considered if the Israeli interpretation were changed.
 Belyayev goes on to repeat the long-standing Soviet contention that
 direct talks under conditions of Israeli occupation would constitute
 Arab capitulation.
 In an ambiguous passage in his 11 January IZVESTIYA article, Kudryavtsev
 seems to object to the Rhodes formula on the same grounds as he 'lid in
 a 17 December article in LIFE ABROAD, charging in both instances that
 the United States is trying in veiled form to force through the Israeli
 idea of direct negotiations with the Arab countries.  In IZVESTIYA, he
 complains of the emphasis in the U.S. plan on "the procedure of the talks
 the United States has proposed" on normalization of the situation.
 Stating that the Rhodes formula was chosen as a "disguise" for Israeli
 demands, he says ?'t   "falseness" of this formula is striking because
 the Jarring   mission "has borne no results primarily owing to the fault
 of American diplomacy."  In ..late October, in  he wake of the commotion
 created by reports--and Cairt., denials--of UAR Foreign Minister Riyad's
 acceptance of the Rhodes formula, Kudryavtsev had been more categorical
 in rejecting the formula.  He had argued in a broadcast in English to

 the Urited Kingdom that "accepting the Rhodes formula, even with Gunnar
 Jarring as mediator, would signify entering into direct negotiations
 with Israel before Israel cleared out of the occupied territories."
 He criticized the British press for "hypocritically calling these
 talks indirect, since the delegations were in different rooms at the
 time and came together in one room only to sign the agreement,"
 MILITARY        The Kudryavtsev article in IZVESTIYA is apparently the
 OPERATIONS      first reflection of concern in Soviet propaganda over
 the recent Israeli military exploits in attacking
 sensitive UAR targets.  Kudryavtsev declares that the Israeli
 militarists' actions are becoming "ever more insolent and dangerous
 in view of their possible consequences."  One can ascertain not only
 the extension of military actions, he says, but also "the preparation
 for spreading them to remote regions" of the Arab countries.
 TASS regularly and briefly reports Arab military operations and
 Israeli "armed provocations," citing Arab military spokesmen's
 statements.  Reporting the Israeli operation on the night of
 26-27 December against what Cairo radio called "warning posts
 north of Ras Gharib and az-Zafaranah," TASS mentioned only the
 latter area; it was from Has Gharib that the Israelis, as they
 acknowledged on 3 January, brought back a Soviet radar installation.
 Citing a UAR armed forces spokesman on the 7 and 13 January attacks
 on UAR military installations near Cairo, TASS in each instance said
 only that the Israeli planes were intercepted by the Egyptian air
 force and were compelled to retreat.

 NIGERIA
 MOSCOW SEEKS TO EXPLOIT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VICTORY
 Moscow reacts to the Biafran surrender with comment underscoring an
 image of the Soviet Union as a champion of African unity, contrasting
 Soviet support of a legitimate government against secessionist rebels
 with Western "znterferenre" represented by aid to Biafra.  Authoritative
 comment comes from Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Zamyatin, who
 remarked at his 13 January press conference, in reply to a question
 about the Soviet position on aid, that genuine humanitarian aid "should
 be rendered through the Federal Government at its request."  Accordingly,
 as quoted by TASS, Zamyatin declared that the USSR "has given and will
 continue to give its support and material aid" to Lagos and that "so-
 called 'aid' tc the rebels through various charity organizations" is
 "nothing but interference in Nigeria's internal affairs."
 An article by Korovikov in PRAVDA on the same day, reviewed by TASS,
 embroiders the theme that the war has taught Nigeria "who are its
 friends and who are its enemies."  Repeating past Soviet charges
 that Western oil monopolies played a role in instigating the conflict,
 the articis seeks to blame the tragic consequences of the war on efforts
 "by the imperialist powers to fan up conflicts and to supply arms and
 give political support to the separatists."  Moscow has on several past
 occasions acknowledged Soviet "material" aid to Lagos, as in Zamyatin's
 current remarks, but has never admitted specifically to being an arms
 supplier.
 Noting that the Western press is "clamoring" for aid missions to be
 sent to Nigeria, the PRAVDA article says this indicates that "the
 Western powers have not abandoned their attempts to interfere in
 Nigeria's internal affairs,"  And an article by Khokhlov in IZVESTIYA
 on the same day says the country's "progressive forces" must now
 "take firmer steps to strengthen unity and to rebuff Western blackmail"
 and "to prevent imperialist forces from interfering in Nigeria's
 internal affairs."  Neither article, to judge from the TASS accounts,
 specifically mentions U.S. offers to aid the war victims; in keeping
 with customary practice, thu, attack is focused broadly on the
 "imperialist" West.
 Just as Khokhlov in IZVESTIYA welcomes the Nigerian Government victory
 with "profound satisfaction" and declares that the USSR has "always
 been in favor of a sovereign and united Nigeria," so Radio Moscow tells
 African listeners that Nigeria's "friends" are happy to see a tragic
 period ending and that the USSR has always stood for Nigerian unity,
 territorial integrity, and peace.

 It was on grounds of support for national unity that Moscow came down
 unequivocally on the side of the Federal Government when the fighting
 started in mid.-1967, using propaganda support of Lagos as part of the
 Soviet effort to establish a political presence in the area.  At the
 same time, as if to keep its options open, Moscow avoided directly
 attacking the Ibos, generally depicting them as pawns victimized by
 the Western "imperialists" and oil monopolies.  As manifestations of
 world sympathy for the plight of the starving Biafrans and censure of
 arms suppliers increased, Soviet propagandists sought to play down
 the Soviet role and to concentrate almost entirely on the Western
 powers' alleged culpability.  The volume of comment and reportage on
 Nigeria declined and has been very sparse even in broadcasts to Africa
 for more than a year.
 Now, in the current Soviet press articles as well as in news coverage
 five times the previous norm in broadcasts to Africa,-?;~;oscow seizes an
 opportunity to make political capital of Soviet support for the winning
 side, reemphasizing its backing of Lagos in a conflict instigated and
 prolonged by the "imperialists and colonialists."  Wide publicity is
 given a report that General Gowon has expressed thanks to Ambassador
 Romanov for Soviet support.

 STRATEGIC ARMS                     LIMITATION
 FBIS TRENDS
 14 JANUARY 1970
 SECRETARY LAIRDIS REMARKS SCORED BY ZAMYATIN, PROPAGANDISTS
 Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Zanyratin touched briefly on the recently
 concluded Helsinki phase of the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT)
 at his 13 January press conference, commenting that their results were
 "positively assessed" in the USSR.  At, the same time, according to the
 TASS report on the press conference, Zamyatin observed that Secretary
 Laird's 7 January statement on expanding the construction of the
 Safeguard ABM system "confirms the existence in the United States of
 forces actively resisting a limitation of the strategic arms race and
 trying to create obstacles for talks on that matter" and that Laird
 "frightens Americans by a Soviet menace he has himsalf invented."  The
 TASS account does not include Zamyatin's observation, reported in the
 Western press, that the Soviet Union is confident that the next round
 of talks opening in Vienna in April "will be in the same spirit that
 marked Helsinki."
 Zamyatin's comments follow a spate of propaganda critical of Laird's
 remarks on the U.S. arms budget and the expanding of the Safeguard
 system.  A RED STAR article on 9 January, reporting on plans to expand
 Safeguard, quoted the New York TIMES for the observation that such a step
 "might prove excessively provocative with respect to the Soviet Union at
 a time when certain results have been achieved at the Soviet-American
 preliminary talks in Helsinki."  RED STAR alluded to "officials" in
 Washington who are expressing fear that the Pentagon's plans "could
 exert a negative influence on the forthcoming Soviet-American talks" in
 Vienna.  The military paper's reference to the possible impact on SALT
 is,no,; echoed in a 13 January IZVESTIYA article criticizing Laird's
 remarks; IZVESTIYA says only that the plans for new weapons systems
 have "caused alarm among the American public, which is legitimately
 worried by the new wave of the Pentagon's military aspirations."
 Over Radio Moscow, a foreign-language camentary by Vavilov on the
 8th said recent remarks by the Secretary on the "alleged Soviet threat"
 have been taken 'Lip by "militarist circles in the United States."  Noting
 that the Helsinki phase of SALT has been met with "satisfaction" through-
 out the world and that the talks will resume in Vienna in April, Vavilov
 stated that circles connected with the "military--industrial complex" in
 the United States "are doing everything they can to prevent anything
 being done to limit the arms race."
 Continuing to report U.S. domestic opposition to development of multiple
 independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRV), TASS on 9 JanuAxy said
 Senator Proxmire indicated in a recent speech that MIRV testing "means
 a further buildup of the U.S. nuclear potential and creates serious
 obstacles for the talks on strategic arms limitation."

 EUROPEAN  SECURITY                                 CONFERENCE
 SOVIET SPOKESMAN VIEWS U.S. PARTICIPATION FAVORABLY
 Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Zanyatin, at a 13 January press
 conference "devoted to questions of preparing and convening u
 conference on problems of European security," states that Moscow has
 informed Washington "of its favorable attitude to the participation of
 the United States in an all-European conference"--an attitude which,
 he adds, is shared by the other socialist countries.  This is Moscow's
 first direct public statement that U.S. participation is acceptable, in
 contrast to long-standing Soviet ambivalence on  the question in the
 past.  In December 1966 and July 1968,,for example, Kosygin had said
 U.S. participation was a matter "to be decided by the conference
 itself."  More recently, the 1 December 1969 Soviet-Danish communique
 and the 22 December Soviet-Luxembourg communique referred to the
 participation of "all interested countries."  Two days prior to
 Zamyatin's declaration, a participant in a domestic service commentators'
 roundtable show had remarked that the United States, "a non-European
 country, claims the right to participate in the European conference."*
 Zannyatin's press conference otherwise broke no new ground on the question
 of a European security conference.  A statement read by him--carried in
 full by TASS four hours ahead of the TASS report of his remarks on U.S.
 participation--stresses the favorable response to the proposal for a
 conference and its timeliness.  The statement endorses the agenda items
 contained in the 31 October Prague declaration of the Warsaw Pact
 foreign ministers--the creation of security in Europe and renunciation
 of force and the widening of commercial and other ties between European
 states--and assails opponents of the conference who would delay it or
 overburden the agenda "with such questions as it would be unable to
 decide."  Wnile the statement cites no example of such questions,
 propaganda at the time of the NATO Council's Brussels meeting in early
 December had complained of efforts to place balanced force reduction
 and the German question on the conference agenda.  Western news sources
 report that Zanyatin, in answer to a question, stated that the European
 security conference should not discuss the Berlin problem, but this
 exchange is not included in the TASS account of the question-and-answer
 session.
 The statement read by Zanyatin at the press conference routinely attacks
 those "people" at the Brussels meeting who would prefer to switch the
 work of the forthcoming conference to talks between NATO and the Warsaw

 Pact.  Such an approach, the statement says, would allow no role for
 European neutrals.
 The timing of the Zanratin press conference may relate in part to the
 reported opening in Moscow the next day of a secret meeting of European
 communist parties to discuss "the anti-imperialist struggle" and
 European security.  AFP reports this development on the 14th, citing
 "well-informed sources" in Moscow.

 USSR AND SPAIN
 SPANISH CP OPPOSES EXPANDED SOVIET-SPANISH RELATIONS
 While Moscow propaganda on Spain continues to dwell routinely on labor
 unrest and opposition to the presence of U.S. bases, ignoring Western
 press speculation about moves toward a thaw in Soviet-Spanish relations,
 Spanish CP Secretary General Santiago Carrillo appeared to lend
 substance to the Western speculation in an interview over the party's
 clandestine Radio Espana Independiente on 5 January.  In the wake of
 a meet ing--reported--br Western sources-between the Spanish foreign
 minister and senior Soviet officials at the Moscow airport,* Carrillo
 expounded on his party's opposition to a rapprochement.  Referring to
 a Madrid newspaper editorial which saw Moscow and its Warsaw Pact
 partners moving toward expanded ties with Spain, he said his party
 had "always" opposed "political,  consular, or diplomatic relations"
 bt:tween Spain and the socialist countries and added--in an evident
 allusion to Poland, Romania, and Hungary, which have established
 consular ties with Spain--that such relations "will not be any
 advantage to those who have established them."  With Franco "nearing
 his end," Carrillo stated, the party would have preferred that the
 socialist countries continue to shun "a regime imposed with the help
 of Hitler and Mussolini" so that "the prestige" of these countries
 might be preserved.
 FRICTIONS BETWEEN     Frictions between Moscow and the Spanish CP
 SPANISH CP S CPSU     appear to have been exacerbated by the Spanish
 party's intransigent stand on the Czechoslovak
 question.  In October the party's executive committee reacted to the
 sanctions imposed on Dubcek and Smrkovsky with a statement charging
 that the actions against the Czechoslovak reformist leaders contravened
 "the conclusions of the 20th CFSU Congress" and marked a return to
 "methods justly condemned by the international communist movement."
 Radio Espana Independiente now suggests that Moscow may be collaborating
 in the splitting efforts of two pro-Soviet dissidents who were dropped
 from Spanish party leadership positions in July.  On 13 December the
 clandestine radio broadcast a purported letter sent to the party
 executive committee by "the Committee of the Spanish Communist Party
 [in exile] in the Soviet Union" protesting the activities of the two
 dissidents, who it alleged were trying to "discredit" the policies of

 the party leadership by disseminating "biaacd propaganda" to party
 militants.  This propaganda, the latter charged, "is reprinted,
 distributed, and recorded on tapes, and signatures are collected
 and attached to letters demanding the measures adopted against
 these two man 'be cancelled."  Indicating that the two dissidents
 enjoyed support from elements of the Spanish party residing in the
 USSR who were receiving and disseminating their propaganda materials,
 the letter alleged that "the dividing and splitting activities" of
 the dissidents were "clearly expressed ir the attitude recently
 adopted by groups of comrades closely connected with these men."
 It complained that this divisive activity "makes it difficult for
 the Committee of the Spanish Communist Party in the Soviet Urion
 to fulfill its tasks."
 In the course of his 5 January interview Carrillo alluded to the
 two dissidents, stating that while all Spanish communists are in
 favor of maintaining "the best relations of friendship with the
 CPSU," they also feel that "Just as pro-China fractions were not
 tolerated, so others which tried to favor any other socialist
 countries could not be tolerated either."
 TIRANA COMMENT     A 13 January Tirana domestic broadcast seizes
 on the reports of a meeting between the Spanish
 foreign ministe'' tend F'uviet officials as exposing the "demagogic"
 nature of "claims" by the "Soviet revisionist clique" that it
 "allegedly defends the cause of socialism."  Moves toward a Moscow-
 Madrid rapprochement stem not from any reversal of the Franco
 regime's policy of "suppression and massacre of the Spanish people,"
 the broadcast says, but rather from an affinity between Franco's
 policy and Moscow's.  The Soviet flirtation with Spain is called
 part and parcel of a policy of cooperation with ",;he most reactionary
 and bloody regimes of the world within the framework of the general
 U.S.-Soviet collaboration to divide their spheres of influence and
 suppress the peoples' liberation movement."

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND POLAND
 WARSAW MEDIA GIVE CERNIK VISIT LAVISH TREATMENT
 I'Ul.iah madlu'u full and enthuci.itic treatment of Czechoslovak
 Premlcr Cernik'u 8-1.0 January "friendship" visit to Warsaw exceeds
 th'  publicity usually accorded a third-ranking guo-it from a bloc
 ,.Quntry and contrarto with Moucow'o treatment of the holdover figure
 from the discredited Dubeck regime when he visited the Soviet Union
 with Husak and Svoboda laot October:  the Soviet press carried
 pictures and biographies of the latter two but not of Cernik, and
 Konygin pointedly refrained from mentioning the Czechoslovak visitors
 by name in his toast at an embassy reception.  Cernik was ngain in the
 Soviet Union on 3-4 December for the meeting of top party and
 government leaders of the socialist states and stayed on for what
 Moscow clad Prague media were to describe, upon his return home on the
 13th, acs a "rest" at Kosygin's Invitation.
 That Cernik has now acquired some renewed acceptability, at least in
 Poland, is suggested by Warsaw media's comment on his January vielt,
 which included a "cordial and friendly" meeting with Gomulka and
 Cyrankiewicz on the first day.  Summing up the talks after Cernik's
 departure, TRYBUNA LUDU on 12 January hails "the full convergence
 of views on all problems discussed" and stresses that "these were
 important and fruitful talks which produced advantageous results
 both for Poland and for the cause of strengthening the unity of the
 socialist community."  The military daily ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI the same
 day, in an article titled "A New Level of Cooperation," says the visit
 served "the most vital national interests of Poland and Czechoslovakia."
 The lengthy 10 January communique on the Cernik-Cyrankiewicz talks
 records full agreement on the whole gamut of bilateral, bloc, and
 international topics, characterizing the atmosphere of the talks as
 one of "frankness and mutual confidence."
 While neither the Polish press comment nor the communique alludes
 directly to Czechoslovakia's past troubles with the Warsaw Five, the
 two principals gave this subject an orthodox airing in their public
 utterances.  At a 9 January meeting at the Zeran Automobile Factory,
 Cyrankiewicz asserted in notably hardline terms that a victory of
 "the autisocialist forces" in Czechoslovakia in 1968 would have
 meant "weakening the solidarity" of the socialist states "at a
 defined sector in the southwest, with all its consequences for the
 future . . ."  Speaking on the same: platform, Cernik was more direct
 than before in recalling at length how the "counterrevolutionary"
 Forces "were shattered in 1968."r_is most explicit praise for Husak's
 leadership came in a Polish radio and television interview, also on

 the 9th, in which he noted that "since April 1969, when the new party
 leadership began its zctivity, the development has been completely
 normal, and favorable internal and external conditions have been
 created."
 Prague television carried a routine interview with Cernik on his
 arrival back home on the 10th, in contrast to the total ignoring of
 the premier by Czechoslovak media in their airport interviews on the
 return of the CSSR party-government delegation from Moscow last
 October.
