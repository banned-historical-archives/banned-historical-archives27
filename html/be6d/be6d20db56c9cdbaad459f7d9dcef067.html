 FAR EAST
 Communist forces staged another wave of mortar
 and rocket attacks against major allied installa-
 tions and urban areas in South Vietnam last week
 but there were only a few ground assaults.  Major
 Communist units remain deployed in the Saigon area
 and near cities in the three northern provinces.
 Political developments in Saigon presented a
 mixed picture.  On the one hand, the government
 initiated action on long-promised administrative
 reforms and replaced the controversial commanders
 of II and IV Corps areas.  Both houses of the Na-
 tional Assembly, on the other hand, rejected Presi-
 dent Thieu's request for emer ency economic powers
 In Laos, the Communist offensive continues
 to appear limited primarily to recovering territory
 seized by the government in recent years.  Com-
 munist forces still threaten positions in the
 Bolovens Plateau area but there were no assaults
 against the provincial capitals of Saravane and
 Attopeu.
 There has been a lull in hostile North Korean
 activity along the Demilitarized Zone and in the
 South since mid-February.  The North Koreans, how-
 ever, apparently remain confident that they can
 prolong the impasse over the Pueblo incident with-
 out incurring serious risks of US military pressure
 to secure the release of the crew.  Pyongyang's
 latest maneuver to extract a formal US apology was

 VIETNAM
 Another wave of coordinated
 anortar and rocket attacks was
 directed this week at major al-
 lied installations and urban
 areas in most of South Vietnam.
 Communist main force troops,
 meanwhile, continue to reposi-
 tion for what may evolve into
 further large-scale battles
 around urban areas, especially
 in the northern provinces.
 The new round of attacks,
 which included only a few ground
 assaults, was considerably less
 intense than the Tet offensive.
 Nevertheless, it served to main-
 tain pressure against populated
 areas, where large numbers of
 allied forces are still tied
 down in defensive positions.
 Starting with the Tet offensive,
 the Communist attack waves have
 been occurring in 15 to 18 day
 cycles.  In the interim periods,
 enemy incidents have reverted to
 nearly normal levels except at
 Khe Sanh, where Communist gunners
 have stepped up tizeir daily shell-
 ings.  A higher number of enemy
 incidents, however, are occurring
 against and around urban centers,
 in contrast to past enemy prac-
 tices.
 There are continuing signs
 of a serious Communist threat
 around Saigon and in South Viet-
 nam's northern provinces.  In I
 Corps, numerous indications of a
 major enemy interest in the cities
 of Hue and Da Nang, as well as
 the other provincial capitals,
 may portend large-scale escala-
 tion of the fighting.
 During January, at least
 19,000 North Vietnamese troops
 were infiltrated into South Viet-
 nam, the highest monthly total
 of the war.  Detailed informa-
 tion on the identity of the units
 involved in not yet available.
 Other forces, such as artillery
 regiments and replacement person-
 nel, are known to have entered
 the northern provinces in January
 and may account for a still higher
 monthly total at a later date.
 Early this week, the largest
 Communist sea infiltration at-
 tempt yet detected in South Viet-
 nam was thwarted when three large,
 steel-hulled trawlers were de-
 stroyed along the coast and a
 fourth was forced to flee into
 international waters.  Each of
 these vessels can transport as
 much as 100 tons of munitions to
 the South in just a few days,
 compared with the lengthy over-
 land route.
 Saigon Political Developments
 The government appears to
 have begun its long-promised ad-
 ministrative reform.  President
 Thieu on 1 March opened a train-
 ing course for prospective new
 province chiefs, and spoke of
 new administrative changes that
 would strengthen the power of
 the central government in the
 corps areas and, hopefully,
 "eliminate" corruption.  Gov-
 ernment sources have claimed
 that the powerful military corps
 commanders will be stripped of
 their civil authority, including
 their primary voice in the ap-
 pointment of province chiefs.
 Almost coincident with these
 administrative moves, the

 controversial commanders of the II
 and IV Corps areas--Generals Vinh
 Loc and Nguyen Van Manh--were re-
 placed.  Both men had been vari-
 ously criticized for corrupt prac-
 tices or for warlord tendencies.
 The new commander of II Corps,
 General Lu Mong Lan, is a ques-
 tionable improvement over Vinh
 Loc, but in IV Corps, General
 Nguyen Duc Thanh may bring some
 of the energy and dedication he
 previously applied to the Rev-
 olutionary Development program.
 Meanwhile, both houses of
 the National Assembly have over-
 whelmingly rejected President
 Thieu's request for emergency
 economic powers.  The negative
 vote was surprisingly heavy--
 40 to 3 in the Upper House and
 85 to 10 in the Lower.  The op-
 position included deputies be-
 longing to a new Lower House
 bloc responsive to Vice Presi-
 dent Ky.
 South Vietnamese
 Economic Picture
 The Tet offensive not only
 inflicted extreme damage on the
 industrial facilities and the
 transportation and communica-
 tions system in South Vietnam,
 it also dealt a serious blow to
 business confidence, according
 to a preliminary assessment by
 the US Embassy in Saigon.  The

 tivity is at a standstill and
 numerous foreign businessmen are

 Trade between urban and
 rural areas in consumer goods
 and agricultural products, which
 increased markedly during the
 past year, dropped off sharply
 in the wake of the Tet offen-

 to step up their harassment of
 commercial traffic some three
 months before the Tet o-ffensive,

 serious risks of US military pres-

 crew.  Pyongyang's most recent
 maneuver to extract a formal US
 apology was to broadcast an open
 letter to President Johnson, pur-
 portedly written by the entire
 Pueblo crew, urging the President
 to take the "necessary measures"
 to obtain their release.
 The main thrust of the letter
 was to emphasize the futility of
 denying that the Pueblo had vi-
 olated North Korean waters because
 Pyongyang has "irrefutable evi-
 dence" from the ship's documents
 and charts.  The letter claimed
 for the first time that the
 Pueblo had operated within North
 Korean waters for ten days, and
 disclosed that the crew had "con-
 fessed everything truthfully"
 and had apologized to the North
 Korean Government.  Finally, the
 letter endorsed Pyongyang's right

 guarantee against further in-

 trusions as the price for re-
 turning the crew.
 The Soviets promptly re-
 ported on the open letter to the
 President,  but  commentary on
 the Pueblo incident is now quite
 sparse, reflecting Moscow's con-
 tinued desire to play the affair
 in  lo~a key.
 In South Korea, tension re-
 sulting from the capture of the
 Pueblo and the North Korean raid
 on the presidential palace is
 gradually easing.  The process
 has been aided by the Vance visit
 and by US offers of increased mili-
 tary assistance.  Seoul last week
 attempted to quiet criticism of
 the government and generally to
 tighten internal security by ap-
 pointing a new defense minister,
 former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff, Choe Yong-hui. President
 Pak had earlier reshuffled top-level
 security officials.  The new de-
 fense minister is likely to have a
 closer working relationship with
 US officials than his predecessor,
 and no change in South Korean pol-
 icy is likely.

 COMMUNISTS MAINTAIN PRESSURE IN SOUTHERN LAOS
 The week-long lull in
 fighting continues, but the
 Communists are still threaten-
 ing government positions in
 the Bolovens Plateau area.
 North Vietnamese troops
 are maintaining pressure on
 the provincial capitals of
 Saravane and Attopeu, although
 there is some question whether
 the Communists intend to oc-
 cupy either town.  In a recent
 interview in Vientiane, the
 local Pathet Lao representa-
 tive disclaimed any intention
 of taking Saravane, because it
 had not been in their hands
 at the time of the 1962 Geneva
 Accords.  Even if no move
 against the town develops, the
 fact that the enemy has been
 moving supplies into the Sedone
 Valley west of Saravane and
 has been digging in near At-
 topeu strongly suggests that
 the Communists intend to hold
 the nearby territory they have
 recently gained.
 Communist objectives in
 the area, however, still appear
 to be limited.  A North Viet-
 namese prisoner, wha was cap-
 tured during the abortive attack
 on 23 February against Lao Ngam,
 asserts that his battalion was
 told that the purpose of the
 current offensive is to re-estab-
 lish Pathet Lao presence in the
 Sedone Valley.  In addition,
 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
 statements have consistently
 portrayed this year's offensive
 as a defensive riposte to Vien-
 tiane's "nibbling tactics."
 Pathet Lao leader Prince
 Souphanouvong took a similar line
 in a Pravda interview on 3 March
 in which he warned that the Com-
 munists will recapture "all ter-
 ritory" seized by Vientiane, pre-
 sumably since the 1962 Geneva
 Accords.
 There have been reports that
 as many as five new North Vietnam-
 ese battalions have been newly
 committed to Laotian operations.
 This buildup underlines
 Hanoi's determination to pro-
 tect the infiltration corridor
 while negating at least some of
 the government's ha  -
 territorial gains.

 Other signs are their continuing
 inability to act firmly to stem
 the spread of "factionalism" in
 the provinces and an intensification
 of propaganda demanding complete
 loyalty to Mao Tse-tung.
 For three weeks, giant posters
 have been prominently displayed in
 Peking attacking officials--mainly
 members of the radical Cultural
 Revolution Group--who allegedly
 tried to bring down Premier Chou
 En-lai last year.  O:n ~ March, Liu
 Ning-i, a senior government offi-
 cial who has specialized in foreign
 affairs, was added to the anti-Chou
 group.  His case is complex, as he
 has not been regarded as a radical,
 and Chou had successfully defended
 him against Red Guard criticism
 early this year.  Possibly Liu com-
 promised himself with C~zou later in
 1967 by trying to make a self-serv-
 ing deal with radical forces.
 Provincial radio s-tations con-
 tinue to broadcast shrill, hysteri-
 cal accounts of "civil wars," which
 are said to be causing considerable
 economic damage.  On 1 March, for
 example, Yunnan radio complained
 that the major factions, by going
 in for violence "in a big way," had
 sabotaged production and communica-
 tions.  The broadcast demanded pun-
 ishment of unnamed people who were
 said to be manipulating warring
 factions behind the scene.
 Inner Mongolia apparently has
 been in turmoil since a Maoist-ap-
 proved Revolutionary Committee was
 formed on 1 November.  Recent broad-
 casts claim that the "revolutionary
 masses," inspired by a speech on
 12 November by Mao's wife, have
 risen in rebellion and have been
 fighting an "earth-shaking" but ap-
 parently inconclusive battle with
 unnamed enemies.  The broadcasts
 say the struggle is intensifying.
 The formation of a Revolu-
 tionary Committee in Kwangtung on
 21 February has not lessened ten-
 sions.  Armed groups continue to
 engage sporadically in clashes in
 Canton and nearby cities.  Middle
 schools and colle es remain closed.
 arge y
 because o  t~ii  ps  o itical unrest,
 many people are trying to escape
 to Hong Kong.  Police in Hong Kong
 apprehended 550 illegal refugees
 in January and more than 650 in
 February.  The monthly average in
 1967 was less than 200.  The Chi-
 nese Communists have strengthened
 land and sea patrols to prevent
 escapes.
 There now appears to be
 greater agreement among Chinese
 leaders over the conduct of foreign
 policy.  The imminent return of
 the Chinese ambassador to Paris
 probably signals resumption of a
 more Normal level of diplomatic
 representation elsewhere abroad.
 Chinese chiefs of mission and other
 senior diplomats have, for the
 most part, remained in Peking since
 their recall during the early stages
 of the Cultural Revolution.  Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai is reported to
 have indicated in a speech last
 month that the majority of ambas-
 sadors were to be sent back to
 their posts, particularly to mis
 sions in Afri   nd Asia  b  the
 end of March.

 the party consultative conference at Budapest,
 despite the furor caused by the Rumanian walkout.
 They pressed successfully for the scheduling of
 a world party conference late this year in Moscow.
 The Russians are concerned over the growing unease

 Moscow`s strong-willed tactics may serve merely to
 spread disunity,
 The Warsaw Pact summit meeting in Sofia this
 week ended without another public Soviet-Rumanian

 According to a TASS announcement, the meeting simply
 adopted "appropriate decisions on the questions
 under discussion."  The discussions probably cen-
 tered on the nonproliferation treaty, European
 security, and solidarity with North Vietnam.
 Because of its defiance of Moscow, Rumania
 has opened itself to possible additional economic
 pressures by some of its nominal allies.  Bucharest
 will probably respond by seeking closer relations
 with the West, Yugoslavia, and the "third world,"
 Uncooperative weather may have played a part,
 but the Soviets did not react to the West German
 parliamentary "work week" in West Berlin with harass-

 USSR SETS WORLD PARTY CONFERENCE FOR LI1TE 1968
 At the Budapest meeting, the
 Russians succeeded in railroading
 through their plan for a world
 Communist conference late this
 year in Moscow.  There are still
 misgivings among various parties,
 however, and the makeup of the
 conference as well as its tasks
 remain to be worked out.
 It became clear at the outset
 of the Budapest conclave that Mos-
 cow was prepared to press hard for
 a consensus on convening a confer-
 ence despite the offense this
 would give to a number of parties.
 Using heavy-handed tactics, the
 Russians managed to gain the ac-
 quiescence of all but the Ru^Za-
 nians.
 The speech by Suslov, head
 of the Soviet delegation, and the
 well-rehearsed chorus of support
 for Moscow's proposals for a for-
 mal world conference made a mock-
 ery of the meeting's "consulta-
 tive" character--a theme that had
 been stressed in advance advertis-
 ing for the Budapest meeting.
 Suslov called for the crea-
 tion of a temporary commission to
 draft documents for a world con-
 ference to take place late this
 year.  The final communique en-
 dorsed this procedure.  It named
 Moscow the conference host and
 Budapest the seat of the prepara-
 tory-committee that is to convene
 on 24 April.
 Soviet behavior seems to be
 symptomatic of the increasingly
 narrow, dogmatic approach Russian
 leaders have recently taken toward
 several internal as well as for-
 eign issues.  Soviet tactics are
 evidence of Moscow's paramount
 desire to strengthen ties with
 those parties that are still sus-
 ceptible to its influence, even
 at the cost of further damage to
 its ties with less malleable ones.
 At present, the Soviet lead-
 ers seem deeply anxious over
 trends toward increasing independ-
 ence among their allies in East-
 ern Europe and the possibility
 of further erosion in the tradi-
 tional, uncompromising stand of
 these regimes against West Ger-
 many.  Increased instability and
 uncertainty in Prague and, to a
 lesser degree, in Warsaw, together
 with outspoken defiance from
 Rumania have injected a note of
 urgency  into P!loscow's  efforts  to
 forestall further fragmentation.
 According to a prominent Soviet
 journalist in Moscow, the USSR
 is trying "to save what can still
 be saved."
 Rumania's walkout at Budapest
 clearly concerned the remaining
 members, who almost instinctively
 drew together to present a facade
 of solidarity.  Nevertheless,
 close study of the positions of
 each Eastern European party re-
 garding the Budapest meeting and
 the international conference next
 fall reveals marked differences
 b-eneath the surface.  Over the
 course of time, the basic conflict
 between the Russians and the Ru-
 manians--unity versus national
 interests--is bound to have sig-
 nificant repercussions in Eastern
 Europe as these states come to
 realize that Rumania's battle is
 also theirs.

 Bucharest had decided that
 .o attend and present its views
 was probably the best way to
 counter Moscow.  Thus, the Ruma-
 nian delegation's leader, in his

 posed the conference's facade of
 equality and gave detailed exam-
 ples of Russian manipulation.  He
 gave the impression, too, that in
 Fzcharest's mind, the US5R was

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA OUTLINES ECONOMIC "ACTION PROGRAM"
 The Dubcek regime has out-   Czech consumer in connection
 lined the economic portion of    with these price increases.  It
 its party "action program."  It   states that retail prices will
 calls for the end of fixed prices  ~ not be changed without considering
 on a large number of items, with
 prices on others being permitted
 to fluctuate within limits. Un-
 less these changes are made with
 a careful view to their impact
 on living standards, however,
 they might reduce public support
 for the new Dubcek administra-
 tion.
 The Novotny regime had rec-
 ognized that major changes in
 the retail pricing system were
 essential to a meaningful eco-
 nomic reform program, but had
 taken little action in this field.
 Under the newly announced pro-
 gram, subsidies to producers
 will be reduced and the turn-
 over tax on retail sales will
 be made more flexible.  These
 measures are not controversial,
 but their result will be an in-
 crease in some retail prices.
 The economic "action pro-
 gram" promises safeguards to the
 incomes of the population, and
 ~ that increases probably will be
 reviewed by a special commission
 on living standards to ensure
 that the general level of retail
 ', prices stays within present guide-
 ' lines.  This suggests that the
 regime is well aware of the po-
 ~ litical danger in a sharp drop
 in living standards.
 Many of the other major rec-
 ommendations of the economic "ac-
 tion program" were drawn directly
 from the economic reform begun
 two years ago.  Plant managers
 will have more freedom both in
 staffing and in production de-
 cisions, and. will have greater
 responsibility for profitable op-
 eration.  The program also con-
 tains a new proposal  that mar-
 ginal agricultural land be leased
 to independent producers as a
 means of stimulating production.

 L^1EST GERMAN TRADE ~JITH COMMUNISTS REACHES RECORD HIGH
 An export drive by West Ger-
 man industry, coupled with the
 Kiesinger government's efforts
 to normalize relations with East-
 ern Europe, has helped boost trade
 with Communist countries to a~rec-
 ord  high,  Increased West German
 exports, largely on credit, ac-
 count for most of the growth,
 which will probably accelerate
 less rapidly this year.
 Last year, Bonn's trade with
 the Communist nations grew at al-
 most double the rate of that with
 non-Communist countries and to-
 taled over $2,5 billion, six per-
 cent of total West German trade.
 Increased exports to Rumania,
 Yugoslavia, and China accounted
 for most of the gain, but exports
 to the USSR and Poland, which have
 been cool to a closer relationship
 with Bonn, also increased,  West
 Germany's imports from the Com-
 munist countries declined as a
 result of the West German reces-
 sion, leaving-an export surplus
 of over $500 million, the largest
 -recorded in its trade with Com-
 munist countries.
 Much of this trade increase
 has resulted from the extension
 of medium-term credit.  West Ger-
 many did not enter the credit race
 until 1964 but has moved rapidly
 since then,  With many East Eu-
 ropean countries now heavily in-
 debted to West Germany, however,
 further substantial growth in its
 trade will depend on Bonn's will-
 ingness to increase its imports.
 Rumania doubled its imports
 from West Germany and was the
 only East European country to
 increase its exports to Bonn last
 year, although it still runs a
 large deficit.  Yugoslavia, a
 target also of Bonn's diplomatic
 offensive, was courted intensively
 by West German  business interests
 and sales to Belgrade, again
 largely on credit, increased by
 almost $100 million.
 Economic advantage plays
 an important role in this bur-
 geoning trade.  Despite the lack
 of diplomatic relations or even
 of any formal trade relations,
 Bonn doubled_s_te exports to China
 last year to some $200 million,
 Some of these exports, however,
 represented deliveries under
 previously concluded contracts.
 China probably will cut back its
 imports from West Germany this
 year in an attempt to bring their
 trade into closer balance.
 Bonn's trade with Czech-
 oslovakia increased-only slightly,
 but the establishment of official
 trade missions should pave the
 way for an expansion in the
 future.

 SbJEDISH FOREIGN POLICY MOVES TO LEFT
 Sweden's Social Democratic
 gove-rnment more and more is adopt-
 ing the foreign policy positions
 of the far left in hopes of win-
 ning support from this quarter for
 the national elections in Sep-
 tembe r .
 This leftward movement is
 most evident on the Vietnam issue.
 Government leaders have begun to
 lend their personal prestige to
 anti-US activities.  North Viet-
 nam's ambassador to Moscow was in-
 vited to Sweden last month, al-
 though Stockholm does not recog-
 nize Hanoi, and was received by
 Prime Minister Erlander and For-
 eign Minister Nilsson.  The ambas-
 sador later helped lead a mass
 demonstration protesting US pol-
 icies in Vietnam.  At the demon-
 stration, Education Minister
 Palme, a leader of the party's
 left wing, delivered another bit-
 ter attack against the US.
 The leftward shift in Sweden's
 foreign policy has also brought
 the Erlander government close to
 a diplomatic break with the Greek
 military junta.  Late last month,
 the junta's opponent, Andreas
 Papandreou, was received by Er-
 lander and Nilsson a~-d was given
 the unprecedented honor of addres-
 sing both houses of parliament.
 Erlander promised financial sup-
 port to Papandreou's resistance

 movement and the use of Sweden for
 its headquarters.
 These foreign policy moves
 are determined in large part by
 domestic political considerations.
 The Social Democrats, who have
 been in power for more than a gen-
 eration, have witnessed the re-
 cent defeats of fraternal parties
 in Norway and Denmark, and fear
 that their own left wing has been
 seduced by Sweden's new-look Com-
 munist Party.  Social Democratic
 leaders have concluded that to
 win this fall, the party must re-
 tain the support of its left
 wing and capture about two percent
 of the Communist vote.  They have
 no majo-r domestic issues with
 which to rally support, inasmuch
 as their welfare state is largely
 complete and successful.
 This gamble, however, may
 not pay off.  The party's chances
 of making inroads into the Com-
 munist vote seem slight, and part
 of its left wing may still vote
 Communist.  At the same time,
 the Social Democratic right wing
 is becoming alienated.  Party
 unity would be further jeopard-
 ized if the aging Erlander con-
 tinues to boost Education Minis-
 ter Palme as his heir presumptive.
 A number of important moderate
 Social Democrats share the cor-
 dial dislike of many Swedes for

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The potential for flare-ups of several of
 the disputes in the area remains strong.
 In Egypt, Nasir is still scouting for scape-
 goats on whom to blame the antiregime demonstra-
 tions of last week.  His speech on 3 March laid the
 trouble at the feet of old "feudal" elements and
 "imperialist lackeys."
 The military regime in Greece is highly an-
 noyed at what it considers foreign "interference"
 in its domestic affairs.  The latest irritant was
 Swedish Prime Minister Erlander's announcement that
 his ruling party would give financial aid to Andreas
 Papandreou's exile opposition group.
 Rhodesia's execution of three Africans whose
 sentences for murder had been commuted by Queen
 Elizabeth has closed the door for some time on
 negotiations between London and Salisbury.  The reac-
 tion in the British Parliament has been one of bi-
 partisan "outrage," but no measures against Rhodesia
 have been seriously considered.  There are reported
 to have been marked differences of opinion within
 the Rhodesian cabinet over whether or not to proceed
 with the executions, but the decision to go ahead
 represents a continued hardening of views against
 compromise with Britain.  The Rhodesians must now
 decide if they are going to execute over 100 other
 Africans who have been sentenced to death, some for
 the lesser, post-"independence" crime of entering
 the country with weapons of war.  Meanwhile, Africans
 are preparing to raise the Rhodesian issue again
 at the UN.
 The federal regime in Nigeria continues to gain
 ground in its war with secessionist Biafra,  London

 MAURITIUS;  ANOTHER UNVIABLE MINISTATE GAINS INDEPENDENCE
 The tiny British colony of
 Mauritius faces grave social, eco-
 nomic, and political problems when
 it becomes independent on l2 March.
 The island's difficulties stem
 from racial divisions, overpopula-
 tion, and a one-crop economy.  Two
 thirds of its 790,0.00 people are
 descended from South Asian laborers
 imported to work the sugar planta-
 tions that provide 95 percent of the
 island's exports.  Hindus constitute
 51 percent of the population and,
 Muslims 16 percent.  A long-estab-
 l_shed middle class is mainly Cre-
 ole--mixed descendants of French
 colonists, Africans, and Asians--
 and about 25,000 persons of Chinese
 descent dominate the small businesses.
 Communal rivalries have erupted
 into violence three times in the
 last 30 months.  Six weeks ago,
 British troops were called in when
 skirmishes between Muslim and Cre-
 ole gangs in the capital city of
 Port Louis flared into full-scale
 riots and spread to other areas. At
 least 26 persons have been killed to
 date, and atrocities have intensi-
 fied hatred.
 The colony's political parties
 have formed along communal lines.
 Prime Minister Ramgoolam's Inde-
 pendence Party is supported by the
 Hindus and many Muslims.  The oppo-
 sition Mauritian Social Democratic
 Party (PMSD), predominately Creole,
 has opposed independence for fear of
 Hindu domination.  The PMSD, which
 plans to boycott all independence
 celebrations, is particularly in-
 censed because the neighboring
 island of Rodrigues--where the
 PMSD received 98 percent of the
 vote last August--will be inte-
 grated with Mauritius, despite
 earlier assurances by London that
 it would be free to choose its own
 destiny.
 The government faces a serious
 financial crisis, despite $10..3
 million in aid from London this
 past year, and is plagued by unem-
 ployment.  To reduce expenditures,
 Ramgoolam has already dropped 11,000
 people from relief roles and has re-
 moved the government's rice subsidy.
 Such austerity measures and
 the rising cost of living may pro-
 voke popular reaction against the
 government.  The 1,700-man police
 force, largely Creole, is well
 trained but will be unable to quell
 any serious disorder without help
 from British troops.
 For several years, both Moscow
 and Peking have been quietly pene-
 trating the island's youth and labor
 organizations.  The Mauritian Young
 Communist League, primarily Mos-
 cow-oriented, claims 8,000 members.
 About a third of the organized Hindu
 laborers belong to a union led by an
 avowed Marxist.  Peking operates
 largely through the local Chinese,
 many of whom retain close familial
 ties with their homeland.  An offer
 to sell 10,000 tons of rice helped
 Peking get an invitation to next
 week's independence ceremonies,
 and Ramgoolam's assertion that he
 will not recognize Peking seems open
 to doubt.

 DOUBTFUL FUTURE FOR VACANT ALGERIAN NAVAL BASE
 The French completed their
 withdrawal from the naval base
 at Mers el Kebir, Algeria, on
 31 January, and the future use
 of this well-situated base for
 military or civil purposes is
 in doubt.  Speculation that the
 USSR might want to use the base
 for support of its Mediterranean
 squadron is so far unfounded.
 The Evian Accords granted
 France use of the naval base
 until 1977, but the French with-
 drew nine years early, primarily
 for financial reasons.  Euacua-
 tion of the naval base is ex-
 pected to save $18.8 million
 this year alone.  The upkeep of
 the base since 1962 has cost
 France $140 million.
 The high cost of the "force
 de dissuasion" has required De
 Gaulle's government to trim funds
 annually from the army and the
 nonnuclear part of the navy.
 The modernization of the French
 Navy continues to lag, with the
 result that the capability of
 the fleet has been reduced.  The
 presence of the US Sixth Fleet
 in the Mediterranean, however,
 reduces the need for a large
 French fleet in that area.  More-
 over, with its emphasis upon
 home-based nuclear striking
 forces, France has little need
 for overseas naval bases.
 The Algerians wanted France
 to delay departure until the un-
 favorable impact on the economy
 of nearby Oran could be cushioned.
 They have requested France to
 convert the facilities to ac-
 commodate oil tankers and thus
 alleviate congestion at Arzew,
 the terminal for Saharan gas
 and oil.  Mers el Kebir also
 provides more sheltered anchor-
 ages than Arzew.  If France does
 not furnish the technicians to
 convert the base, the Algerians
 might ask the USSR to do so.
 Algerian leaders have re-
 cently declared that no foreign
 power will be permitted to take
 over the base.  The French Gov-
 ernment believes the Algerians
 will not allow the Soviet Navy
 to use the base not only because
 of Algeria's close ties with
 France, but also because of
 Algeria's fear of losing more
 of the exports to France that
 are so vital to its economy.
 The intense nationalism that
 rejects the establishment of
 foreign bases on Arab soil also
 militates against the Soviets'
 setting up a base there.
 Since June, 20 to 30 Soviet
 naval units have been operating
 regularly in Mediterranean
 waters.  The maintenance of this
 squadron has been a burden on
 Soviet Navy supply ships, par-
 ticularly tankers, which must
 shuttle between the Mediterranean
 and Black Sea ports.
 Soviet ships frequently
 visit Egyptian ports, where
 Soviet tenders are almost con-
 tinuously present to provide
 routine maintenance and resupply.
 Limited use is made of commer-
 cial port services, but there
 is no evidence that the Soviets

 also called at Algerian ports.
 The USSR might welcome regular
 access to Mers el Kebir, a west-
 ern Mediterranean port where
 naval units could put in for
 routine self--maintenance resup-
 ply, and recreation.
 The USSR probably does not
 want a base arrangement that must

 by its own propaganda, which

 EGYPTIAN DISSENTERS TEMPORARILY QUIET
 Although no demonstrations
 occured in Egypt during the past
 week, the regime may be compelled
 to make further concessions to
 prevent future outbreaks.
 Nasir's speech to a workers'
 rally on 3 March pointed up his
 deep concern over the antigov-
 ernment aspects of the recent dem-
 onstrations.   Nasir_ attempted to
 minimize the seriousness of the
 protests and to lay the blame for
 II
 inciting them on  counterrevolu-
 tionaries," whom he identified as
 old "feudal" elements and "impe-
 rialist lackeys."  He also at-
 tempted to justify some of the
 difficulties the Egyptians have
 had to endure since the June war
 as part of the struggle to elimi-
 nate the "effects of the aggres-
 sion."
 Egypt's universities and
 high schools remain closed.  The
 government reportedly plans to
 reopen them after the Muslim hol-
 idays of Bairam, which begin on 9
 March, apparently in the hope
 that the earlier emotions will
 have subsided.
 The Nasir regime will no
 doubt employ repressive measures,
 if necessary, to prevent a repe-
 tition of the protests.  Although
 such measures probably will pre-
 vent future demonstrations from
 getting completely out of hand,
 further government concessions
 may be required to ease the situ-
 ation.  Some student groups are
 reported to be encouraged but
 not appeased by their success in
 achieving a retrial of the ac-
 cused military officers on the
 grounds that their original sen-
 tences were too light.  The gov-
 ernment may attempt to answer
 the demonstrators' pleas for
 greater freedom by making some
 apparently liberalizing gestures,
 such as new elections for Egypt's
 National Assembly, or cabinet
 shifts with a more civilian flavor.
 Nasir's vow to liberate the
 territory under Israeli occupa-
 tion may also be a sop to popular
 sentiment.  It would, however,
 compel him to be somewhat more
 cautious in his dealings with the
 Jarring UN mission, for fear of
 provoking charges of being soft

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Many countries in Latin America are pre-
 occupied with preparations for coming elections.
 Panamanian elections, scheduled for 12 May,
 are bogged down in impeachment proceedings against
 President Robles, who is accused of interfering
 with the electoral process.
 In Honduras, where municipal elections are
 scheduled for 31 March, an exchange of conciliatory
 gestures between the ruling National Party and the
 Liberal Party has improved the political environ-
 ment.
 The Dominican municipal elections in May are
 threatened with a boycott by the left-of-center Dom-
 inican Revolutionary Party, and the Social Christians
 and conservatives are demanding government guarantees
 that will create a "proper electoral climate."  In
 addition, the rightist party supporting exiled former
 general Wessin has conditioned its parti:cipation.on
 President Balaguer's permitting Wessen to return.
 Despite a month-long teachers' strike and ac-
 companying labor unrest in E1 Salvador, the ruling
 National Conciliation Party appears in no danger
 of losing its majority in the legislative and
 municipal elections set for 10 March.
 Colombia's campaign for the congressional
 elections on 17 March is proceeding without serious
 incident.  The Liberal-Conservative National Front
 will probably maintain its present majority in
 congress.
 Followers of Ecuadorean presidential candidates
 Ponce and Velasco have had minor clashes, and there
 may be further disturbances following Velasco's
 return to Ecuador on 9 March,
 In Venezuela, opposition parties have won con-
 trol of congress, thus supporting opposition claims
 that the governing Democratic Action party is de-
 teriorating.  This can only hurt the party in the
 present maneuvering for coalitions for the December

 PANAMANIAN POLITICAL CRISIS DEEPENS
 The crisis over control of
 Panama's electoral machinery
 still shows no signs of early
 resolution.  The National Guard
 is growing more disposed to seize
 power as government and opposi-
 t~ion forces continue unwilling
 to reach an accord.
 A showdown in the National
 Assembly on the impeachment of
 President Robles for interfer-
 ence in the electoral process
 co-uld come at any time.  Arnulfo
 Arias' National Union {NU), which
 controls the assembly, appears
 to be postponing the next move
 in the hope that some compromise
 can be reached.  The NU refuses,
 however, to withdraw on the im-
 peachment issue unless Robles
 replaces his minister of govern-
 ment and justice immediately
 and promises to appoint an en-
 tirely apolitical cabinet.
 On 5 March, the assembly
 appointed a three-man, pro-Arias
 commission to investigate the
 charges of attempted manipula-
 tion of electoral machinery by
 Robles.  Despite pressures from
 any sectors--including the guard,
 the archbishop, and businessmen--
 Robles has remained intransigent
 and is refusing to answer the as-
 sembly's summons to appear before
 it and respond to the impeach-
 ment charge.
 Both Robles and Arias are
 hesitant to confront the Na-
 tional Guard with orders that
 might trigger a take-over by the
 security forces.  Guard leaders
 under General Vallarino, how-
 ever, foresee a situation in
 which the NU will demand that
 the guard endorse the impeach-
 ment and the assumption of the
 presidency by the first vice
 president, and Robles will
 Quard dissolve the assembly.

 STRIKE IN EL SALVADOR TO CONTINUE THROUGH ELECTIONS
 The month-old Salvadoran
 teachers' strike, which resulted
 in massive demonstrations, hundreds
 of arrests, and at least four
 deaths, is scheduled to continue
 through the legislative and munici-
 pal elections set for 10 March.
 Public support for the strike has
 been waning over the past two weeks,
 but further use of force by the
 government could prompt renewed
 violence.
 Support for the teachers'
 union reached a high point in mid-
 February, when demonstrations at-
 tracted as many as 10,000 partici-
 pants, education officials were
 blocked from the ministry, and Com-
 munist-affiliated unions staged
 sympathy strikes.  When the Na-
 tional Guard moved with force
 against demonstrators on 26-27
 February and made several hundred
 arrests, however, spirit largely
 collapsed.
 sity on 3 March have now triggered
 protests over the violation of
 university autonomy.  Further
 tough measures by the government
 could galvanize the students into
 action.
 The government is determined
 to hold the elections on schedule.
 The teachers' strike and related
 disorders have curtailed election-
 eering, but the over-all effect of
 the dispute will probably not sig-
 nificantly alter the legislative
 makeup.  Additional support for
 the major opposition Christian
 Democrats from sympathetic parents
 and teachers will probably be
 countered by the government's gains
 from its anti-Communist crusade.
 Such an offset would maintain the
 ruling National Conciliation   25X1
 Party's slight majority and allow
 it to claim an endorsement for the
 eight-month-old moderate reformist
 Press reports that National
 Guard agents entered the univer-
 regime of President Sanchez

 COLOMBIAN CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED THIS MONTN
 The National Front government
 headed by President Lleras should
 maintain, and perhaps increase,
 its majority in congress in the
 elections scheduled for 17 March.
 The primary importance of this
 election lies not so much in the
 distribution of congressional
 seats as in the relative strength
 displayed at the polls by the var-
 ious parties and factions.
 The National Front, which was
 formed in 1958 following the ouster
 of dictator General Rojas Pinilla,
 calls for the sharing of power be-
 tween the traditional Liberal and
 Conservative parties.  The presi-
 dency is alternated between the
 Liberals and Conservatives every
 fo-ur years, and seats in both the
 House of Representatives and the
 Senate are evenly divided.  Opposi-
 tion parties participate in the
 elections by entering a slate of
 candidates on either the Liberal
 or Conservative ticket.
 The dismantling of the National
 Front is scheduled to begin in the
 1970s, and the various parties and
 factions are now beginning to jockey
 for position.  The reunification of
 the Liberal Party last August vir-
 tually assures the Liberals of
 political hegemony in the country
 when the National Front is finally
 abolished.
 The Conservatives recognize
 the necessity of reconciling their
 two opposing factions if they are
 to remain an important political
 force, but they have thus far been
 unable to reach any agreement.
 Both the Unionistas, who support
 the National Front, and the op-
 position Lauro-Alzatistas view
 the c-oming elections as a test of
 strength that will improve their
 positions in future negotiations
 on reunification.
 The National Popular Alliance
 (ANAPO), former dictator Rojas'
 party, has in recent years emerged
 as the strongest opposition to the
 National Front.  Early predictions
 were that ANAPO would gain several
 seats in the House of Representa-
 tives, but its campaign has sparked
 little public interest and it will
 probably do little more than main-
 tain its current position.  The
 Communist Party is also participat-
 ing in this election but is not ex-
 pected to have much success.
 The campaign has failed to ig-
 nite public enthusiasm and the vote
 will probably be small, with the
 Liberals making the best showing,
 the Unionista Conservatives out-
 polling the opposition Conserva-
 tives, and ANAPO maintaining or
 perhaps slightly strengthening its
 present position.
