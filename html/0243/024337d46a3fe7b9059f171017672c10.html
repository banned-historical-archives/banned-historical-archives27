 VIETNAM
 There has been no Hanoi follow-up to Foreign Minister
 Trinh's statement of 30 December on the possibility
 of talks with the US.   Viet Cong local forces were
 unusually active this week, particularly in the Sai-
 gon area.   In the northern border areas, Communist
 main force units continued threatening maneuvers.
 Photography reveals the probable presence of cruise
 missiles in North Vietnam.   In Saigon, Vice President
 Ky has reportedly added his voice to the growing
 criticism of President Thieu's lack of positive lead-
 ership.

 FAR EAST
 Hanoi is seeking to exploit the impact of For-
 eign Minister Trinh's statement that North Vietnam
 "will hold talks" with the US after an unconditional
 cessation of bombing and other "acts of war."  The
 North Vietnamese have claimed that this statement
 has been warmly welcomed throughout the world and
 have denounced President Thieu for blocking open-
 ings to peace and for rejecting a coalition govern-
 ment with the Liberation Front.
 These moves have stimulated widespread uneasi-
 ness in South Vietnam regarding the US attitude
 toward talks and a coalition settlement.   Saigon
 leaders have reiterated their opposition to a coa-
 lition and the National Assembly has rejected any
 dealings with the Liberation Front.   The South Viet-
 namese Government reportedly suspended a newspaper
 because it indirectly advocated the idea of a coa-
 lition.
 A series of Viet Cong attacks last week within
 a 30-mile radius of Saigon and in the Hue and Da Nang
 areas probably were aimed in part at aggravating
 political unrest and uncertainty in the South by
 demonstrating the government's inability to protect
 these heavily populated areas.
 Prince Sihanouk's initial public comments on
 the Bowles mission underline his primary objective
 of discouraging South Vietnamese and US forces from
 pursuing Communist forces into Cambodian territory.
 He praised American restraint in dealing with this
 problem, claimed that Ambassador Bowles had stated
 that the US would not invoke the doctrine of "hot
 pursuit," and stressed Cambodia's desire to strengthen
 the International Control Commission's ability to pre-
 vent all foreign infiltration.
 There are no signs that the divided leaders in
 Peking have been able to agree on firm measures to
 deal with spreading conflict and disorder throughout
 China or to check the steady erosion of Peking's au-
 thority in the provinces.   Peking's propaganda con-
 tinues to ignore widespread fighting, blandl    or-
 traying the situation as "excellent-II                                   25X1

 SECRE']I
 VIETNAM
 Foreign Minister Trinh's as-
 sert:-on on 30 December that North
 Vietnam "will" talk with the US
 if all war acts against North.
 Vietnam are stopped uncondition-
 ally has provoked wide specula-
 tion on possible changes in the
 North Vietnamese policy.   So far,
 however, Hanoi has not chosen to
 elaborate on this statement.   The
 Communists have carefully con-
 strued it as a reiteration of a
 long-standing position and not
 as a concession.
 Although the modification in
 Hanoi's official position set
 forth in the Trinh statement seems
 motivated primarily by a desire
 to end the bombing and stall any
 major US escalation, it may also
 have been promoted in part by at
 desire to probe both for US necco-
 tiating terms and for signs of US
 willingness to modify its objec-
 tives in Vietnam.
 The Communists may,  for ex-
 ample, believe they detect mod:L-
 fications in the US position on
 dealing with the National Libera-
 tion. Front.   Hanoi has not com--
 ment.ed explicitly on US state-
 ments about possible representa-
 tion of the Front in future peace
 negotiations,  suggesting that the
 Communists see these statements
 as  EL  sign of greater US flexi-
 bility.
 Meanwhile, rumors generated
 by the North Vietnamese state-
 ment have sparked widespread un-
 easiness in South Vietnamese
 circles that the US might be pre-
 paring to open negotiations with
 Hanoi or to accept a coalition
 government in the South that
 would include the National Libera-
 tion Front.   Both houses of the
 National Assembly have addressed
 themselves to this question dur-
 ing the past week.
 High Saigon off:_cials, more-
 over, have recently reiterated
 their opposition to any coalition
 government with the Front.   Al-
 though the concern will probably
 not reach a level at which it be-
 comes a critical factor in GVN-US
 relations,  it could begin to af-
 fect the Vietnamese :response to
 US initiatives on pacification
 and other nation-building activi-
 ties in South Vietnam.
 The Communists lost little
 time in capitalizing on the po-
 =_itical unrest in South Vietnam.
 On 7 and 8 January,  Hanoi radio
 and the Liberation Front condemned
 South Vietnamese President Thieu's
 opposition to a coalition govern-
 ment and attempted to contrast
 his negative attitude with the
 Front's more positive approach to
 the concept.   While endorsing the
 coalition idea in general terms,
 the Front has not been very forth-
 coming in spelling cut the details
 of an acceptable coalition ar-
 rangement.

 The Front's current political
 program, for example, offers to
 accept into the Front's ranks al-
 most anyone willing to support its
 objectives.    This has been a long-
 standing policy, however, and one
 designed more to broaden popular
 support than to present a precise
 proposal for a "coalition govern-
 ment" with disaffected Saigon of-
 ficials.   The new program recom-
 mends a future government estab-
 lished after general elections,
 but it is deliberately vague about
 the steps to achieve this.   It
 does not commit the Front to ne-
 gotiations with the present Saigon
 leadership for the purpose of
 forming a coalition government.
 Although recently captured
 documents indicate that the idea
 of a coalition has been discussed
 extensively within the Communist
 movement for several months,
 these discussions are also vague
 on details and timing.
 A new problem facing the
 Thieu government is the proffered
 resignation of General Nguyen Duc
 Thang, deputy chief of the Joint
 General Staff in charge of Revo-
 lutionary Development cadres.
 Thang's wish to resign apparently
 stems from what he considers foot-
 dragging on the part of the gov-
 ernment in instituting vital re-
 forms, including a reorganization
 of the armed forces, which would
 strip the corps commanders of
 much of their power base.  Al-
 though Thang's resignation has
 been rejected,  it still could
 prove to be a source of embarrass-
 ment if the press--which has li-
 onized Thang--becomes aware of
 his resignation attempt and the
 reasons behind it.
 Increased Military
 Activity in the South
 Viet Cong guerrilla and lo-
 cal forces were active this week
 throughout South Vietnam.
 A flurry of large-scale,
 enemy-initiated attacks occurred
 within a 30-mile radius of the
 center of Saigon.   During a five-
 day period, four major actions oc-
 curred near the capital city,  in-
 cluding two bold assaults on nearby
 towns.   Most of these actions saw
 extensive enemy use of mortars,
 both preceding   and during ground
 attacks.   For example, some 600
 mortar rounds were fired as part
 of a Communist attempt to overrun
 the capital of Hau Nghia Province.

 Intense enemy mortar and
 rocket barrages were also di-
 rected at strategic US and al-
 lied military installations else-
 where during the week.   A US
 Marine supply base near Da Nang
 was struck by a 122-mm. rocket
 bombardment in a close follow-
 up of last week's heavy rocket
 attack on the Da Nang airfield
 itself.   An attack on the US
 air base at Kontum in mid-week
 inflicted moderate casualties
 and extensive damage to aircraft
 and associated equipment.
 This phase of the Communist
 winter-spring campaign has been
 marked by unprecedented enemy
 losses--a record 2,868 Communists
 were killed last week--as well
 as by an extremely high level of
 enemy aggressiveness throughout
 South Vietnam.   It is possible
 that the enemy is attempting a
 particularly heavy show of force
 to gain the maximum psychologi-
 cal advantage with the populace
 prior to the Tet holiday that
 begins on 30 January.   Communist
 military preparations, however,
 appear to foreshadow a resump-
 tion of major offensive action
 after Tet.
 Communist main force units
 continue to pose a major threat
 in three border areas:   western
 Quang Tri - DMZ, western high-
 lands, and northern III Corps.
 Enemy reconnaissance activities
 and probing attacks against
 many allied outposts in these
 areas have increased.   Such ac-
 tions may signal full-scale as-
 saults on some of these outposts.
 Possible Cruise
 Missiles in DRV
 North Vietnam may have ac-
 quired short-range, surface-to-
 surface missiles intended for
 coastal defense.   Possession of
 such weapons, if confirmed, would
 pose a significant threat to US
 warships conducting shore bom-
 bardment operations along the
 DRV coast.

 Thus far,  leaders in Peking
 seem to have been unable to
 reach agreement on how to deal
 with the spreading violence,
 and as a result their guidance
 has been indecisive and ineffec-
 tual in checking the erosion of
 Peking's authority in the prov-
 inces.
 NEW MODERATION IN PEKING'S FOREIGN POLICY
 25X1
 25X1
 Although Communist China
 continues to be wracked internally
 by Cultural Revolution violence,
 an increasing number of indica-
 tions suggest that advocates of
 moderation in Peking have managed
 to regain their influence over
 foreign policy, which had been
 lost to revolutionary extremists
 last summer.
 The return to a more moder-
 ate and cautious approach has
 been reflected in actions Peking
 has taken to ease tension in
 Hong Kong.  F          -777~

 Peking has clearly been
 concerned with the failure of
 extremist tactics in Hong Kong.
 It probably hopes that a moder-
 ate approach will be more effec-
 tive in attracting the support
 of dissatisfied non-Communist
 groups and thus win over a broader
 section of the population.
 Peking's recognition of the
 futility of premature resort to
 revolutionary violence was also
 evident in NCNA's year-end status
 reports on the Communist movements
 in Laos, Burma,  and Thailand.
 Peking hailed a series of "bril-
 liant victories" allegedly won
 by these groups but laid heavy
 stress on the long-term nature
 of "people's war" and the virtue
 of "self-reliance."   The three
 parties were applauded for their
 efforts in building a popular
 base among the masses, which was
 cited as a necessary prerequisite
 for "people's war."   The Burmese
 party, in particular, was lauded
 for its "20-year revolutionary
 civil war," but probably derived
 little comfort from Peking's ad-
 monition that further "protracted
 struggles" lie ahead.
 None of the statements con-
 tained even a pro forma pledge
 of Chinese support.   The rosy
 picture of "excellent revolu-
 tionary situations" noted by
 Peking seems primarily designed
 to cover China's reluctance to
 involve itself more heavily in
 the armed struggles within the
 three countries.
 Peking's preoccupation with
 domestic affairs and the war
 in Vietnam has encouraged a
 restrained attitude toward armed
 struggle by "fraternal parties."
 This recent tone of pragmatic
 moderation, however, has also co-
 incided with Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi's apparent recovery of
 much of his political importance
 and his control over the Minis-
 try of Foreign Affairs.   Chen Yi,
 who in effect was suspended last
 summer while under heavy attack
 by Red Guard proponents of "rev-
 olutionary" diplomacy, resumed
 a busy schedule in November.   On
 28 December, he received the
 French ambassador, his first
 such session with a Western dip-
 lomat in a year.

 JOHN GORTON:  AUSTRALIA'S NEW PRIME MINISTER
 Australia's   new prime min-
 ister,  John Gorton,  is not ex-
 pected to make any major changes
 in foreign or domestic policies.
 He has reaffirmed Australian de-
 termination to stay in the Viet-
 nam war and to show the Commu-
 nists that "aggression does not
 pay.
 Gorton,  56, has been in-
 creasingly influential on the
 Australian political scene for
 two decades.   His leadership
 qualities will now be put to the
 test in efforts to arrest the
 erosion of popular support for
 the governing Liberal-Country
 coalition.   This decline stems
 in part from former Prime Minis-
 ter Holt's lack of a firm hand
 in maintaining discipline within
 the coalition leadership.   The
 government has also been embar-
 rassed by its inept handling of
 several recent domestic issues.
 John G. Gorton
 Moreover,  the opposition
 Labor Party has greatly improved
 it image since Cough Whitlam re-
 placed old and erratic Arthur
 Calwell as party leader early
 last year.   Labor's increased
 popularity was demonstrated in
 the senatorial elections of No-
 vember 1967, when it received
 45 percent of the popular vote
 compared with the coalition's 42
 percent.   Gorton's priority po-
 litical task,  therefore, will be
 to reverse the trend toward La-
 bor before the next scheduled
 election in November 1969.
 A forceful and likeable
 personality,  Gorton has held
 many executive posts over the
 years.   In addition to serving
 as senator since 1949, he has
 been minister of the navy,  of
 works and mining,  and most re-
 cently of education and science.
 He has acted as the government's
 foreign affairs spokesman in the
 Senate,  and since last October
 has also been the coalition's
 majority leader.   Within the next
 few weeks, Gorton is expected to
 resign from the Senate and seek
 election to Holt's former seat in
 the lower house,  from which prime
 ministers are traditionall   cho-
 sen.                                          25X1

 The outline of plans for a sweeping liberaliza-
 tion of domestic policy and a more independent foreign
 policy has been broached in the Prague press follow-
 ing the election on 5 January of Slovak leader Alex-
 ander Dubcek as the new Czechoslovak party first secre-
 tary.   Dubcek apparently has chosen this means to
 make known his aspirations and intentions.   From War-
 saw, in the meantime, rumors continue to be reported
 of behind-the-scenes political maneuvering and of
 plans for a reorganization of the top Polish party
 leadership.
 In Moscow, there were intimations that the party
 central committee is to meet later in the month.   Pos-
 sible agenda items include the situation in Czecho-
 slovakia, on which the top Soviet leadership may wish
 to present its views, and the plans for the consulta-
 tive meeting of Communist parties now set to open on
 26 February in Budapest.   It is also widely rumored
 that party secretary Demichev is to be demoted at
 the meeting, possibly to the Ministry of Culture.
 The restoration of diplomatic relations between
 Bonn and Belgrade appears to be drawing nearer.   Ac-
 tual negotiations may begin later this month, probably
 at some neutral site since neither side apparently
 wishes to hold talks in the other's capital.
 Top British officials were on the move this week
 spreading the news of London's decision to slash its
 foreign military commitments.   Commonwealth Secretary
 Thomson was touring Southeast Asia, while Foreign Min-
 ister Brown stopped in Tokyo and Washington.   Prime
 Minister Wilson is due in Washington on 8 February
 following a visit to Moscow on 22-24 January.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S NEW LEADER CHARTS BOLD COURSE
 Within a week of replacing
 long-time Czechoslovak party boss
 Novotny,  Slovak leader Dubcek has
 moved boldly to set in motion far-
 reaching changes benefiting
 society and the individual, but
 he has many problems to overcome
 in this endeavor.
 Dubcek has shown a keen
 awareness of the necessity for
 realistic responses to the serious
 problems facing the country,
 particularly on the domestic
 scene.   He has also made clear
 his understanding of the needs
 of the people.
 On 10 January the official
 party daily,  Rude Pravo, pub-
 lished an article that set forth
 in broad outline a series of
 radical proposals.   If imple-
 mented, these proposals would
 constitute a domestic policy
 more liberal than that of Yugo-
 slavia.   This plan presumably
 reflects the consensus of the
 central committee under Dubcek.
 It emphasizes that henceforth
 Czechoslovak democracy must al-
 ways be concerned with the rights
 and liberties of the individual.
 Moreover, the party may no
 longer
 use its power to undermine
 this
 ideal "by the pressure
 of
 au-
 thority in the name of
 the
 com-
 munity's interests."
 As a
 corol-
 lary, the article points out that
 Czechoslovakia must develop forms
 of administration that create
 "more and more room for self-
 administration."
 The article also asserts that
 the party must withdraw from its
 ubiquitous role in society and
 must remove itself from the di-
 rect administration of the gov-
 ernment and the economy.   In or-
 der to accomplish this, Czecho-
 slovak officials, from the high-
 est to the lowest levels, will no
 longer be permitted to hold both
 government and party posts.   It
 appears that virtually all party
 leaders, as well as thousands
 of middle-level functionaries
 will be affected.
 Personnel changes in the
 party and government,  as well as
 structural changes in the lat-
 ter, are in fact being considered.
 The National Assembly convened
 earlier this week, presumably
 to decide upon these shifts.
 Premier Josef Lenart--who,  like
 Dubcek, is a Slovak--is almost
 certain to lose his job because
 it would be impolitic for Slovaks
 to hold both top party and gov-
 ernment posts; he is also said
 to have supported the ousted
 Novotny.   Other officials who
 may be significantly downgraded
 include party secretary and
 ideology chief Jiri Hendrych,
 and Foreign Minister Vaclav
 David, both of whom are of the
 Novotny mold.  Novotny himself
 apparently will be allowed to
 keep the presidency at least for
 the time being.
 In foreign policy, Dubcek
 may take a more nationalistic
 line than his predecessor,  seek-
 ing better relations with the
 West and the US in particular,
 and possibly reopening talks
 with West Germany on the

 establishment of diplomatic re-
 lations.   Indeed, if the Rude
 Pravo   article is any indication,
 Dubcek apparently envisions a
 foreign policy as independent as
 Rumania's.
 Dubcek will need time to
 consolidate his position and
 to form a more stable coalition.
 This will be a complicated
 process because he will have
 to loosen the party's absolute
 grip on political power to make
 his reform programs work and
 to satisfy liberal demands for
 greater cultural and political
 freedom.   He will undoubtedly
 encounter stiff opposition from
 many of the entrenched regional
 and district functionaries, who
 have in the past thwarted ef-
 forts at reform in order to pro-
 tect their positions.   In an-
 ticipation of such a response,
 and as a means of countering it,
 Dubcek has already sent selected
 party presidium members and cer-
 tain of his Slovak party col-
 leagues on speaking tours around
 the country to explain his new
 programs.
 Novotny and his hard-line
 cronies remain for the present
 on the party presidium.   Although
 their tenure seems limited and
 their influence is probably in
 abeyance at this point, Dubcek
 himself may not be able to count
 on the unqualified support of a
 majority of the presidium members.
 His position may have been
 strengthened, nevertheless, by
 the enlargement of the presidium
 by four members experienced in
 some of Czechoslovakia's key
 problem areas.
 Dubcek's election appears
 to have been a last-minute com-
 promise among factions within
 the presidium and central commit-
 tee.   No member of the Slovak
 minority has ever held the top
 party post, and Dubcek's activi-
 ties will be closely scrutinized.
 Czech leaders almost certainly
 resent him, partly because of his
 youthfulness, but primarily be-
 cause the Slovaks over the years
 have been in the vangua d of the
 opposition to Novotny.

 EAST GERMANY TRYING TO FORMULATE NEW VIEWS TOWARD BONN
 Considerable confusion seems
 to have accompanied East German
 (GDR)  efforts in recent weeks to
 formulate a comprehensive response
 to repeated official and unoffi-
 cial West German  (FRG)  overtures
 for closer, but unofficial, rela-
 tions.   In the past six weeks,
 Pankow has issued contradictory
 statements on the status of West
 Berlin and the "two Germanies"
 within the German nation.
 The Soviet Union did not
 support East German leader Walter
 Ulbricht's claim on 1 December
 that West Berlin "legally" be-
 longs to the GDR.   Since then,
 GDR spokesmen, including Ulbricht,
 have reverted to the less-threat-
 ening, standard line that West

 Berlin is an "independent politi-
 cal entity."
 The regime's recent comments
 on certain proposals concerning
 the two Germanies and the German
 nation probably reflect its deep
 need to justify again--particu-
 larly for its Eastern European
 allies--its hard-line policy
 toward Bonn.
 The most significant expres-
 sion of these views appeared on
 28 December in a Neues Deutsch-
 land article ostensibly w-ritten
 by Wolfram Neubert, a lecturer
 in the Communist Party's Institute
 for Social Sciences.   Without
 mentioning it by name, Neubert
 was responding to an unofficial
 study widely publicized in West
 Germany that was designed to show
 the way to reunite the German na-
 tion.   Neubert ostensibly rebutted
 the study's contention that the
 German nation is now composed of
 two "constituent states," but
 his arguments actually paralleled
 some in the study.  He stated,
 for example, that the "German
 nation continues to exist... in
 the form of two different  (sov-
 ereign)  states together with the
 independent political entity of
 West Berlin."
 The "peculiarity" that the
 GDR and FRG are "states of one
 nation," however, does not mean
 to Neubert that normal interstate
 relations should not be pursued.
 Such relations, he rationalized,
 would not mean that the GDR would
 consider West Germany and West
 Berlin as  "foreign" states.
 "They were, are, and will remain
 German."   Neubert thus contra-
 dicted earlier statements by East
 Germany's leading propagandist.
 Neubert also argued that the
 "national needs of all Germans"
 and the true interests of the
 German nation are presently pro-
 tected and fostered by the GDR.
 In so doing, he went further than
 any other East German official in
 advancing the claim that Pankow
 rather than Bonn has the right
 to represent all Germans.   There
 are indications that this aspect
 of Neubert's arguments will serve
 as the basis for East German
 propaganda in the coming months.
 Neubert's formulas, however,
 will be difficult to sustain be-
 cause they seem to give Bonn an
 opportunity to pursue its policy
 of limited rapprochement with East
 Germany, and probably will not be
 effective in dampening Eastern
 European desires to establish
 diplomatic relations with West
 Germany.   In the meantime, the
 East Germans probably will have
 to continue to search for a way
 out of the impasse they have
 largely created fnr themselves.

 USSR CONTINUES COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES CAMPAIGN
 The USSR continues to eye
 the world commercial aircraft
 market with considerable inter-
 est.   Soviet aircraft. promoters
 are busy in Western Europe and
 in Latin America, but so far their
 sales campaign has been unre-?
 warding.
 Moscow is pushing hard to
 break into traditional US and
 British markets  in Latin Amer-
 ica.   Political considerations
 and a general unfamiliarity with
 Soviet aircraft,  together with
 concern over spare parts, main-
 tenance,   and technical assist-
 ance, have thus far prevented
 the Soviets from gaining an en-
 try into the market despite of-
 fers of discount prices and at-
 tractive financial terms.
 Moscow now has come up with
 a new twist designed to attract
 customers.   It is offering to
 lease TU-134 medium--range jets
 at a "reasonable" price to a
 domestic Brazilian airline for
 a two-year period,  after which
 they could be purchased with the
 rental fees applied to the cost.
 This type of arrangement, which
 is to be offered to other Latin
 American countries, could prove
 attractive because it provides
 an opportunity to determine whether
 the Soviet aircraft are economi-
 cally competitive in operation
 before a decision to purchase is
 made.
 Moscow has had no luck in
 Western Europe in pushing sales
 of its transports,  such as the
 AN-24 and the TU-134, which face
 heavy competition from established
 Western manufacturers.   The new
 Soviet IL-62 four-jet 186-pas-
 senger aircraft, comparable to the
 British VC-10, may receive a boost
 when one leased by Air France is
 introduced on the Moscow-Paris run
 this summer.
 Helicopters remain the USSR's
 best seller.   Considerable inter-
 est has been shown in Western
 Europe in the large MI-6 and MI-10
 (Flying Crane)  helicopters, which
 have no counterparts in the West.
 The MI-8 28-passenger helicopter,
 significantly cheaper than the
 comparable Western model, also is
 attracting some buyers.   In an
 effort to capitalize on this in-
 terest, Moscow now is emphasizing
 the commercial adaptations of
 this type of plane for fire fight-
 ing, passenger transport, agri-
 cultural work: and car o carr ing.

 BRITISH GOVERNMENT PONDERS BUDGET CUTS
 The British cabinet has been
 considering proposals for massive
 cuts in government spending af-
 fecting both domestic and foreign
 policy.   An announcement of the
 results of these discussions is
 expected when Parliament returns
 from its Christmas recess in mid-
 January.
 Cuts in defense spending
 will amount to approximately 400
 million pounds of the one billion
 pounds the government wants to
 save by 1.970.   The savings will
 be made at the expense of com-
 mitments to SEATO, Malaysia,  and
 the Persian Gulf states.   The
 F-111 contract with the US prob-
 ably will. also be affected.
 Britain will probably pull
 the last of its forces out of
 the Malaysia/Singapore area by
 the end of 1971,  if not sooner.
 Commonwealth Secretary Thomson--
 dispatched to Commonwealth coun-
 tries in the Far East to inform
 them of the proposed cuts--is
 talking in terms of withdrawing
 by mid-1971.   A similar time-
 table for departure from the
 Persian Gulf also seems probable.
 It is unlikely, however,  that
 troop levels will be cut in Hong
 Kong, Malta,  or Cyprus,  and the
 question of reducing British
 forces in. Germany will be deferred
 pending talks with the US and
 West Germany.
 Defense Minister Healey is
 fighting for retention of the
 F-111 contract, primarily on the
 grounds that US cancellation
 charges would be prohibitive.
 Faced with formidable opposition,
 Healey is hoping for a compromise
 that would reduce the number of
 F-ills purchased from 50 to 35.
 As part of the cut in non-
 defense expenditures, the British
 press has reported that London may
 pull out of the UK-French Concorde
 supersonic transport program, and
 postpone a project to construct a
 tunnel under the English Channel.
 In the case of the Concorde, doubts
 about its long-term economic via-
 bility contribute to London's re-
 luctance to continue.
 Nevertheless,  the government
 still must reduce domestic spend-
 ing in order to channel resources
 into export industries and hold
 price and wage levels in check.
 Among the domestic measures most
 frequently mentioned as vulnerable
 are free medicine under the health
 program, highway construction,
 and the planned rise in the com-
 pulsory education age from 15 to
 16.

 The Wilson government un-

 welfare programs poses a real.

 DANISH ELECTORAL OUTCOME UNCERTAIN
 The special election in Den-
 mark on 23 January will mark the
 second time in just over a year
 that Prime Minister ]Crag and his
 Social Democratic Pa:cty  (SDP)
 have been compelled to seek a
 fresh mandate from the electorate
 for the government's economic

 Because of the ?aroliferation

 Denmark has had coalition or

 odds are once again against the
 emergence of a strong government
 that could push through the com-
 prehensive anti-inflationary
 measures required to allow Den-

 the far left Socialist People's
 Party (SPP)  and the Radical Lib-

 withdrawal from NATO and adoption
 of neutrality.
 Ever since the 1966 elections
 in which the SPP doubled its rep-

 position in parliament, Krag has
 been forced to depend on the SPP
 for support on domestic policies.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Some problems took on an optimistic note
 this week, but given the deep rooted antagonisms
 in the area such optimism is probably ephemeral.
 Egypt's intentions to begin clearing opera-
 tions to release the 15 cargo ships trapped in
 the Suez Canal since the June war may run afoul
 of Israel's insistence that Cairo reach some
 agreement with Tel Aviv before the operations
 begin. Even if Egypt decides to proceed unilat-
 erally, however,  Israel may hesitate to use mili-
 tary force to halt the work.
 The new government in South Yemen has been
 able to function smoothly so far, although eco-
 nomic difficulties may prove insurmountable if
 additional aid is not forthcoming.
 In Athens, recently released Andreas Papandreou
 may soon leave the country.   Interior Minister Pat-
 takos says his request to travel to the US will be
 approved.   Meanwhile, King Constantine remains in
 Rome amid doubts about his early return.
 India's Congress Party leaders, at the party's
 first annual conclave since last February's general
 election, have declared their intention to move
 against failing non-Congress governments in several
 states.   Indo-Pakistani relations suffered at least
 a temporary upset this week when the Pakistanis
 ousted an Indian diplomat for alleged espionage ac-
 tivities and India reciprocated in kind.
 In the Nigerian civil war, Lagos army head-
 quarters reports that Biafran resistance has eased
 both around Enugu and at Bonny on the coast.   Lagos
 now is aware that Biafra has French mercenaries,
 and Gowon is reported to approve a policy of "no
 quarter for mercenaries."
 There are some indications that Congolese Presi-

 CRAB-ISRAELI TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH
 Border clashes continue
 along the Israeli-Jordanian cease-
 iire line, and efforts to clear
 the Suez Canal may be stymied by
 Tsra.el's insistence that Cairo
 reach some agreement with Tel
 Aviv before clearing operations
 begin.
 Israeli and Jordanian forces
 have exchanged fire four times
 this month and tensions remain
 high.   In a fire fight on 8 Janu-
 ary,                      the Israelis used aircraft
 For the first time since 21 No-
 vember to silence Jordanian ar-
 tillery.
 in some cases,  the Israelis
 may be initiating the exchanges
 in retaliation for continued Arab
 terrorist infiltrations from Jor-
 dan.   Israeli Minister of Defense
 Mos.ae Dayan recently said,  "If
 the mine layings continue,   it is
 doubtful if the population along
 the East Bank will be able to con-
 tinue living where they do."   On
 1 January,  firing apparently be-
 gan between Israeli forces and
 terrorists on the occupied West
 Bank and   somewhat later
 t e Israelis fired
 across the river into Jordanian-
 held territory, killing four refu-
 gees.   Border clashes will con-
 :inue as long as Arab terrorists
 cross Jordan to infiLtrate Israel
 and the West Bank.
 On another of Israel's bor-
 ders, Egypt has indicated it is
 now willing to allow the release
 of the 15 cargo ships trapped in
 the Suez Canal since the June war.
 Bgypt appears to be proceeding
 unilaterally toward moving the
 ships despite Israel's insistence
 that some prior agreement be
 .reached with reel Aviv before op-
 erations in the canal actually be-
 gin.   UN officials in the area may
 be able to work out a satisfactory
 arrangement, but even if Egypt
 proceeds without Tel. Aviv's con-
 sent, the Israelis may hesitate
 before using military force to
 halt such a nonmilitary operation.
 Egypt, meanwhile,  is having
 problems convincing other Arab
 states of the need for an early
 summit conference.   In the face
 of Syrian and Saudi Arabian re-
 fusal to attend, the summit pro-
 posed for 17 January in Rabat has
 now been postponed indefinitely.
 Further efforts will likely be
 made to convince the recalcitrants
 to attend, but there is little
 hope the endeavor  will be immedi-
 ately successful.

 SOUTH YEMEN MAY FACE SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 The new government of South
 Yemen has been able to function
 smoothly so far but economic dif-
 ficulties may prove insurmount-
 able if additional aid is not
 forthcoming
 Some of South Yemen's present
 air of stability results from the
 exile or detention of vocal po-
 litical figures.   Opposition ele-
 ments--especially the Front for
 the Liberation of Occupied South
 Yemen  (FLOSY)--are demoralized
 and lack effective channels of
 communication with their exiled
 leaders.   The absence of daily
 newspapers pending a new press
 law has also helped calm the
 situation.
 The new government is prob-
 ably relatively popular upcoun-
 try, but its composition does
 not include influential elements
 in Aden other than the trade
 unionists.   Government policies
 so far have been moderate;  there
 has been no effective propaganda
 in favor of progressive-socialist
 doctrine,  and the President has
 promised to preserve a "free econ-
 omy."   Foreign policy has been
 unadventurous, with pledges of
 friendship for all regardless
 of political orientation.   Some
 of this moderation may result
 from the government's realization
 that British budgetary aid may
 be all that is keeping it from
 economic disaster.   The British
 subsidy--l2 million pounds--
 lapses in May, however,  and its
 renewal is in doubt.
 The army, purged of its most
 traditionalist officers, has
 taken up with apparent serious-
 ness its new role as shield of
 the National Liberation Front
 regime.   Continued army support,
 however, is almost certainly de-
 pendent on the government's
 ability to pay salaries,  and
 this may not be easy without
 British aid.   Meanwhile, jobs
 are scarce, and many members of
 the British and Indian communi-
 ties, which had generated jobs
 and commercial activity, have
 already left.   Those business-
 men who still remain are uneasy.
 The external--and to some
 extent, internal--orientation of
 the new regime will probably de-
 pend largely on the source of
 future financial aid.   So far,
 the government's announcement
 that it will take aid without
 strings from any country, East
 or west, has met with no response,
 although several countries have
 indicated their willingness to
 consider various types of tech-
 nical assistance.   The Saudi at-
 titude toward the new government
 has been cautious, if not actively
 hostile, and Kuwait and Libya
 have been noncommittal.   The
 USSR has not yet given any indi-
 cation of what its role might be
 in the new state; two Soviet
 diplomatic officials from Cairo
 visited Aden briefly last month,
 but returned without any indi-
 cation of their mission.   Cairo
 radio, however, later announced
 that the USSR and South Yemen
 would exchange diplomatic rela-
 tions at the ambassadorial level.

 EGYPTIAN ECONOMY BEARING UP UNDER SEVERE STRAINS
 Egypt suffered a number of
 blows during and after the June
 war that exacerbated its already
 severe economic problems.   The
 country, however, possesses a
 remarkable ability to get by
 under very adverse conditions,
 and with a little luck should
 be able to manage fairly well
 over the next few months.
 Egypt's foreign exchange
 earning ability was severely hit
 by the closure of the Suez Canal
 and the curtailment of tourism
 following the events of last
 June.   Its earning ability was
 further circumscribed by the
 damage inflicted upon Egypt's
 two main oil refineries at Suez
 in October.   Large foreign debt
 obligations will probably remain
 a pressing problem.
 How well the country manages
 in the immediate future depends
 largely on two rather uncertain
 factors.   Egypt was promised
 $250 million of annual aid at
 the Arab summit conference in
 September, and payments of this
 aid have made up for the loss
 of much of its foreign currency
 earning capacity.   Although
 these payments have so far been
 prompt, there is no guarantee
 how long they will continue.
 Egypt is also currently nego-
 tiating for a new agreement with,
 the International Monetary Fund
 which, if concluded, will facil-
 itate debt rescheduling and help
 Egypt obtain new loans from
 Western sources.   The agreement
 .is not yet firm but prospects
 for its conclusion are good.
 If the aid from its fellow
 Arabs continues, Egypt should
 be able to manage well enough
 over the next few months.   Food
 on order appears adequate to
 cover requirements until the
 summer of 1968, and consumer
 necessities remain readily
 available, with rationing in
 effect on only a few items.  A
 severe import curtailment pro-
 gram held Egypt's trade deficit
 in 1967 to the lowest level in
 recent years.   The country's
 liquid foreign assets are cur-
 rently slightly greater than
 comparable holdings in 1966.
 Export prospects for 1968
 also look bright under the
 circumstances.   Oil exports
 will be affected by the loss of
 Sinai oil and the damage to the
 Suez refineries, but these losses
 will be somewhat offset by in-
 creased output from remaining
 oil fields.  Major export crops
 appear to be doing well, and in
 1968 Egypt will enjoy substantial
 benefits from the Aswan Dam in
 increased electrical power out-
 put and acreage under irrigation.

 CHILEAN PRESIDENT INCREASES POLITICAL SUPPORT
 President Eduardo Frei
 won an important tactical vic-
 to:~y at the national conven-
 tion of his Christian Demo-
 cratic Party                (PDC)  last week-
 end.   He obtained party sup-
 po_-t for his controversial
 wage readjustment legislation,
 and installed one of his firm-
 est backers as party presi-
 dent.   He was unable, however,
 to get support for his pro-
 posed one-year ban on strikes
 over economic issues.
 By defeating the left-
 wing group that had controlled
 the party leadership since
 last July, Frei overcame one
 of the obstacles tc a wage
 law he considers vital to his
 stabilization program.   The
 law provides for paying part
 of a pending wage increase
 in government bonds--a form
 of enforced saving that would
 slow inflation and create funds
 for social development projects
 The party's endorsement will
 improve Frei's chances for get-
 ting the law through the Chamber
 of Deputies but it still faces
 major opposition in the opposi-
 tion-controlled Senate and is
 likely to emerge in much modi-
 fied form.   Even if it survives
 as written, tae law"s usefull-
 ness will be greatly curtailed
 by the failure to adopt a strike
 ban.
 Frei's strong personal in-
 tervention was the deciding fac-
 tor at  the PDC convention.   In
 the past, he has been criticized
 for taking an active: interest
 in party affairs only in emer-
 gency situations.   The fact that
 he was forced to make a second
 speech at 4 a.m. indicates that
 this was another emergency, but
 his success may encourage him
 to assume a more active role in
 :party matters.

 COLOMBIAN ARMY TO MOVE AGAINST NEW GUERRILLA FORCE
 The army is planning an
 operation designed to eliminate
 a guerrilla unit believed to be
 forming in northwestern Colombia.
 There have been reports of guer-
 rilla training camps along the
 border between the departments of
 Antioquia and Cordoba for more
 than a year, and on 6 January two
 policemen and a civilian were
 killed in an attack on a police
 outpost in southern Cordoba.
 Police suspect the attack
 was led by Julio Guerra, allegedly
 one of the leaders of a new guer-
 rilla group that reportedly has
 been responsible for many murders
 and kidnapings in southern Cordoba
 Department since last November.
 In the absence of government se-
 curity forces,  the guerrillas are
 reported to have virtually taken
 control of that area,  and many
 residents have been forced to
 flee.
 The increasingly serious re-
 ports coming from the area plus
 the army's recent success in com-
 bating guerrillas in other parts
 of the country prompted the mili-
 tary to plan a large-scale opera-
 tion in the area.   Most of their
 success, however, has come in
 rounding up urban support groups
 and in small-scale rural operations.
 Large sweep-through operations,
 such as the recent one in Commu-
 nist stronghold of Sumapaz  have
 netted them very little.                25X1

 GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT BACKS DOWN ON TAX MEASURES
 Events in Guatemala over the
 past week have pointed up the
 weakness of the Mendez government
 and could spur opposition elements
 into renewed activity.
 On 5 January t: ie government
 backed down on a sales tax meas-
 ure after merchants,  apparently
 in a consolidated effort, had
 raised prices even on items ex-
 cluded from the tax.   The result-
 ing unrest was compounded when at
 the same time bus owners attempted
 to double fares in the capital.
 Opposition political ele-
 ments--especially the Communists--?
 reportedly were planning to ex-
 ploit the unrest, and there were
 also rumors of military discon-
 tent and plans for public demon-
 strations.   During a series of
 emergency meetings on 4 and 5
 January, President Mendez and his
 aides decided that the political
 situation was too fragile to sur-?
 vive such extensive opposition.
 Police officers were placed on
 buses to prevent the fare hike,
 the tax was suspended, and the
 government urged the people to
 consider this a "patriotic act"
 in defense of the public's in-
 terest.
 The tax suspension has re-
 duced political tension, but it
 may complicate any future effort
 to enact or enforce measures that
 are not acceptable to vested in-
 terests or large sections of the
 population.
 Moreover, the impression that
 the government panicked will be
 taken as a sign of weakness and
 will probably stir Mendez' oppo-
 nents to probe for other soft
 spots -A
