 During the past few months the Soviet Union has been
 quietly exploiting economic and other avenues of approach
 as a means of improving its relations with the Japanese
 government.  Moscow probably hopes in the short run to
 establish a de facto relationship--relying in the long
 run on Japan's deteriorating economic situation and the
 general trend of Far Eastern developments to force the
 Japanese into an accommodation with the Orbit.

 A number of leading officials of the Hungarian Communist
 regime, including top-level party leader Erno Gero, have been
 relieved of their posts in order to assume other unnamed
 "important functions" or have been appointed to new "supra-
 ministerial" positions during recent weeks.  This reshuffling
 suggests that an "inner cabinet" has been re-created to handle
 the regime's serious economic and ideological problems arising
 out of new course policies, a task these officials are uniquely
 suited to handle by virtue of their past experience and training.
 Gero, long considered to be Hungary's economic boss, was
 replaced as minister of the interior although he retains his
 post of first deputy premier.  Others who were reassigned
 without explanation include:  Andor Berei, former first de-
 puty minister of foreign affairs and believed to be the real
 power in the ministry; Jozsef Tisza, the former minister of
 produce collection; and Oszkar Betlen, the former editor-in-
 chief of the official party daily.  Another important economic
 leader, Zoltan Vas, is believed to have been appointed to head
 a newly-created "supraministerial" Office of Material Economy,
 while Zoltan Szanto, a long-time Communist theoretician, was
 named chief of a new "supraministerial" Bureau of Information.
 The recent separation of the Hungarian ministries of
 foreign and domestic trade may presage a general expansion of
 Satellite cabinets.  This in turn may mean that "inner cabinets,"
 which disappeared following Stalin's death,will reappear through-
 out Eastern Europe.
 Further evidence that Moscow regards Western military
 planning with the "northern tier" Middle Eastern states as
 a matter of signal concern was the 8 July Soviet aide-memoire,
 asking Iran's intentions toward participation in Western plans.
 Iran was reminded of the provisions in the 1927 Soviet-Iranian
 treaty in which both countries agreed not to participate in
 political agreements or alliances which would be detrimental
 to the security of the other.
 Moscow's decision to intensify pressure on Iran may
 reflect a belief in the Kremlin that time is no longer on
 its side and that it must use its influence with Iran now.
 The timing of the demarche may also have been influenced by
 Moscow's appraisal of the recent Iranian rebuff to the Indian
 ambassador's proposal for an East-West pact guaranteeing Iran's
 sovereignty and Soviet recognition that an oil settlement is
 nearing conclusion.

 Soviet propaganda has long insisted that an oil settle-
 ment on terms presently envisioned would open the way for
 Western--and particularly American--domination of the country.
 It was this point that Pravda emphasized so strongly on 2
 July in an article which thie Soviet embassy, in a highly
 unusual move, reproduced and distributed to Majlis deputies.
 Moscow would prefer to preclude all chances for a period of
 stability in Iran, which would probably lead to a decline of
 Soviet influence.

 PEIPING MAKING NEW BID FOR INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION
 The efforts by the Chinese Communists at the Geneva
 conference to improve relations with Western powers may result
 in wider international recognition of Peiping and in greater
 support for its claim to China's seat in the United Nations.
 At the same time Chou En-lai's personal triumph at Geneva may
 affect thb internal alignment among Peiping's leaders.
 At high-level talks with the heads of delegations at Geneva,
 and. in unofficial meetings with trade groups, the Chinese Commu-
 nists attempted to widen the split between the United States and
 its British and French allies.
 The Peiping regime has arranged to send a charge to London,
 thus normalizing diplomatic relations.  For the past four years,
 the British envoy in Peiping has largely been ignored, and the
 Chinese government has refused to accredit a representative to
 .the United Kingdom, chiefly because of Britain's lack of active
 support for China's UN membership.
 Negotiations between British and Chinese delegates at Geneva
 have led to the release of all British subjects detained in China.
 In talks with British business groups., Chinese trade officials
 arranged for a trade delegation, the first Peiping has ever sent
 to a Western country, to visit England.
 Since the 23 June meeting of Mendes-France and Chou En-lai,
 the American embassy in Paris has gained the impression that
 France may be considering recognition of Peiping.  High Foreign
 Ministry officials are reportedly being sounded out for the
 post of ambassador.
 Peiping exploited direct contacts with other Western
 nations at Geneva,  largely through the issue of foreign nationals
 detained in China,  and through approaches on trade.
 During negotiations for the release of Canadian citizens,
 the Chinese suggested that Peiping would like to establish
 diplomatic relations with Canada.  The St. Laurent government,
 however, still maintains that Peiping should not be recognized
 at this time.
 Chinese officials are also said to have approached repre-
 sentatives of Norway and the Netherlands in an attempt to

 improve China's-relations with those countries.                 While there
 has been no known reaction to these overtures, both countries
 probably would be amenable to closer relations, especially
 since Sino-British relations have improved.
 Other meetings on the status of foreign nationals in China
 were held with representatives of Belgium, Italy, West Germany
 and the United States.  The Chinese Communists are believed to
 have given a favorable response to all requests except that of
 the American delegation.   Peiping apparently wants to prolong
 the talks and secure the right to deal with the American dele-
 gation on behalf of all Chinese nationals in the United States.
 Another approach to Western nations at Geneva was made,
 through trade representatives.  Business groups from Belgium,
 Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and West Germany were invited to
 discuss trade with China, and a Dutch trade delegation arranged
 to visit China this fall.
 Since Peiping is believed uninterested in expanding Western.
 trade under the present restrictions, the overtures at Geneva
 seem designed to encourage recognition of the regime and to
 break down Western trade barriers.
 Most of the countries contacted by Peiping have not sup-
 ported Peiping's efforts for UN membership or have not recognized
 the Communist regime, and many are susceptible to British and
 French influence on foreign policy matters.  Numerous policy
 statements have been made by various foreign ministers of
 nations friendly to the United States calling for a reappraisal
 of Chinese membership in the UN, but it still seems unlikely
 Peiping will be admitted at the forthcoming ninth General
 Assembly session.   Support for American procedural maneuvers
 at this time is sufficient to block the two-thirds vote neces-
 sary to admit Peiping to the General Assembly.
 China's success at Geneva can be largely attributed to the
 cunning and personal charm of Peiping's premier and foreign
 minister, Chou En-lai, who for years has traded on his reputa-
 tion for "sincerity" and on non-Communist hopes of allaying his
 "suspicions."  At a time when a successor to the aging, and
 perhaps ill, Mao Tse-tung has become a real problem, and when
 the Chinese Communist Party "reorganization" has given every
 indication of extending to the top leadership, Chou has
 solidified his position in the Peiping hierarchy.
 He has assured himself of an important part in the colle-
 gium which will probably succeed Mao, and may be able to capi-
 talize on his popularity to emerge eventually as the leader
 of Communist China.

 PROBLEMS FOR THE MENDES-FRANCE GOVERNMENT
 Even if French premier Mendes-France can produce an early
 Indochina truce, he still faces serious difficulties in making
 the rest of his program acceptable to the National Assembly
 and in the necessary broadening of party representation in. his
 cabinet.    Further problems are presented by assembly antagonisms
 toward Mendes-France personally and by the neutralist tendencies
 of some of his immediate advisers.
 The large assembly majorities he has achieved so far do
 not reflect support for his program as'a whole, but rather
 the political magic of his "contract" to achieve an Indochina
 settlement by 20 July or resign.  Actually, the record vote
 attained on confirmation of his cabinet concealed some weaken-
 ing of support from key RadicaliSocialist and Gaullist elements
 which occurred during the week following his investiture.  He
 is unlikely to be held to the 20 July deadline if a cease-fire
 seems close by then; but if he is to continue in office for
 long after a truce, he will probably have, to undertake a major
 cabinet reshuffle to include more left-center elements, and to
 tailor his program accordingly.
 Mendes-France's economic policies, the foundation of his
 over-all program, are expected to consist largely of steps to
 broaden the plan Finance Minister Faure instituted under Laniel.
 This plan has made considerable progress toward the goal of
 increasing purchasing power and the gross national product 10
 percent by the fall of 1955.   The premier believes, however,
 that more drastic tax reforms are necessary to encourage in-
 vestments in production, and such measures would evoke strong
 attack from the small businessmen who form a major element
 of his own Radical Socialist Party.  His conviction that real
 budget retrenchment would include reductions in family allow-
 ances and other social benefits runs counter to the established
 policies of both the Socialists and the Popular Republicans.
 Mendes-France has also promised a clear decision on EDC
 before the summer parliamentary recess.  His investiture plea
 for an effort to find a compromise version acceptable to a
 considerable majority in the assembly, however, has not yet
 been translated into action by the committee representing
 opposing cabinet factions.  Meanwhile, the plan appears already
 nullified by the refusal of the other EDC powers to accept any
 major changes.

 These developments may lead him to conclude that there
 is no feasible alternative to submitting an unaltered EDC to
 the assembly, where the backers of the treaty insist they still
 have a majority.  As a last resort for disposing of the EDC
 issue without an embittered parliamentary debate, however, he
 might move to reverse France's present strong stand against
 restoring German sovereignty independently of the EDC treaty.
 Mendes-France seems personally attached to France's basic
 Western alliance policy, but he may allow his own views to be
 colored by some of his most intimate advisers, who are reported
 to include a high proportion of leftist neutralists.  For the
 first time these elements are in a position to exert direct
 influence on French government policy.  Among these, for ex-
 ample, is Georges Boris, who has in the past emphasized that
 France should concentrate on economic recovery and steer
 clear of East-West rivalries.   The new premier's closest re-
 ported journalistic contacts are with the neutralist weeklies
 L'Observateur and the less blatant L'Express.
 The American embassy reports that in general only "leftish
 and intellectual circles" were enthusiastic over Mendes-France's
 investiture.   The more bitter critics of the new regime lump
 together most of Mendes-France's advisers as a collection of
 "Jews, freemasons, and other anticlerical forces" bent on
 blocking France's participation in a Europe integrated under
 the aegis of the various center Catholic parties, including
 the Popular Republicans in France.
 Another factor affecting Mendes-France's ability to
 remain in power is his personal relationship with fellow
 deputies, who sometimes find him irritatingly condescending.
 Although he is breaking ground in French politics by the
 adroit use of radio "fireside chats" with the French people,
 the embassy reports that the assembly objects to such appeals
 "over its head."  In any case, this device is unlikely to
 consolidate public sentiment in time to help him appreciably
 in resolving the major issues facing him before the assembly
 recesses in August.

 CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF ARAB-AMERICAN RELATIONS
 Despite a few hopeful developments, Arab-American relations
 continue to be disturbed, chiefly by Arab resentment over the
 United States' support of Israel--the yardstick against which co-
 operation with the United States is regularly measured.   The
 Suez dispute with Britain and American efforts to promote Middle
 East defense have roused intra-Arab jealousies and anti-Western
 activity.   The death of King Ibn Saud is bringing new and hostile
 forces against the United States in Saudi Arabia.
 Although Israel was created six years ago, Arab resentment
 over the part played by the United States in its creation has not
 significantly lessened.   Any hope that this emotional issue might
 slowly fade out is thwarted by the recurrent breakdown of the un-
 easy Arab-Israeli truce arrangements.   Likewise, the periodic fi-
 nancial support which flows into Israel from private and public
 American sources keeps the wound raw.
 Pro-Western Arab leaders privately deplore the attitude of
 their people.   They parrot publicly, however, the intemperate pop-
 ular line, or at best remain silent, as they are fully aware that
 Arab bitterness over Israel makes it dangerous for them to voice
 opposing opinions.
 The Arab press and radio periodically issue inflammatory
 calls to arms against Israel, at the same time heaping opprobrium
 on the United States.   As most of the local communications facili-
 ties are government-controlled, this reflects the leaders' unwill-
 ingness to take an independent stand on this emotional issue.
 The Suez dispute involving American and British efforts to
 .promote Middle East defense continues to rouse anti-American
 sentiment among the Arabs.   Egypt. has been increasingly annoyed
 over America's unwillingness to grant it sizable economic aid in
 advance of a Suez settlement.
 There have long been intra-Arab differences as well as
 steady Arab opposition to American efforts to promote Middle East
 defense arrangements.   Egypt and Saudi Arabia are currently wag-
 ing a strong propaganda campaign against Iraq's contemplated ad-.
 herence to the Turkish-Pakistani defense arrangement.

 American relations with Saudi Arabia have been on a sharp
 decline since King Saud came to power in November 1953.   Sur-
 rounded largely by anti-Western advisers, he voices strong
 anti-Israeli sentiments and repeatedly decries alleged American
 support of Britain in his dispute over the Buraimi area on the
 eastern coast.
 Saud has adopted a tough bargaining attitude toward the
 Arabian-American Oil Company and has signed the Onassis oil
 transport agreement, which has evoked strong protests from
 ARAMCO and from the Department of State.   He decided in late
 June not to renew the Point IV program.
 In this basically gloomy picture, there are a few hopeful
 developments and prospects.   Iraq, guided by leaders friendly
 to the West and concerned over the threat of Communism, is
 moving slowly toward co-operation with Western defense planning.
 In recent weeks an Arab technical committee met repeatedly with
 Special Ambassador Cric Johnston and publicly showed a construc-
 tive attitude toward the American proposals for the development
 of the Jordan River valley.  An early Anglo-Egyptian settlement
 of the Suez problem, which now seems possible, might significantly
 improve the American position in the Arab states, where there
 is a general feeling that the present administration is more
 friendly than its predecessor.
 For the long run, however, Arab political and economic im-
 maturity is a serious block to effective co-operation with the
 West.   The Arab states'  lack of unity and direction is exploited
 by various extremists, such as the religious fanatics who call for
 a revival of medieval greatness by evicting the Western infidel.
 Ultranationalists join the chant and demand the end of colonialism.
 Leftists and militant Communists urge the elimination of Western
 influence and the rise of the "people."  These forces strain
 American-Arab relations.

 ADENAUER STILL HOPES FOR EDC AS HE DEMANDS GERMAN SOVEREIGNTY
 West German domestic political developments and the
 accession of Mendes-France as French premier have influenced
 Chancellor Adenauer to demand the restoration of German sover-
 eignty independently of EDC.   Nevertheless the chancellor has
 avoided any renunciation of his pro-Western and integration
 policies, and is presently supporting no alternative plan for
 German rearmament.
 In the past, Adenauer's foreign policy has had two chief
 objectives--German sovereignty and rearmament--to be achieved
 respectively through simultaneous implementation of the Bonn
 and Paris treaties.   When the French National Assembly in-
 vested Premier Mendes-France, whose attitude on EDC had long
 been regarded as equivocal, Adenauer announced on 20 June that
 if France did not soon ratify EDC, he would insist on the
 sovereignty granted in the contractual agreements.  Adenauer
 was then in the midst of the state election campaign in North
 Rhine-Westphalia, where his adherents retained control in the
 27 June vote.   In general, he seems to have wide support for
 his basic policy; influential papers have even criticized him
 for suggesting separation of the two treaties as soon as he did.
 Adenauer apparently remains convinced that the best way
 to organize Western European defense is in accordance with the
 present EDC treaty.   He continues to affirm publicly that the
 French, in the end, will agree with him.   In a press interview,
 on 2 July,he flatly declared that the only alternative to EDC
 was a German national army--which, he went on to say, he did
 not want.   In the same interview, Adenauer rejected the idea of
 negotiating changes in the EDC treaty before it is ratified
 by the National Assembly.
 If it develops that the treaty as it stands is unacceptable
 to France, Adenauer will necessarily have to explore less          25X1
 satisfactory military arrangements, such as a watered-down EDC,
 or some alliance requiring either the expansion of German
 security forces or the creation of a national army.
 Even if West Germany is granted sovereignty in e-
 pen ent y of EDC this year, Bonn will be required to forego
 its right of unilateral rearmament for the time being.

 A joint Anglo-American study group met in London from
 5 to 9 July and recommended a specific program for restoring
 German sovereignty if the French assembly adjourns without
 ratifying EDC.   In such an event the United States, Britain,
 and the Federal Republic would invite France to join in a
 protocol bringing into force the Bonn treaty minus all
 references therein to EDC.    If France refuses, the other
 powers would take the steps available to them to make the
 treaty operative.  The proposed protocol, which now reserves
 the question of German rearmament, also provides that if EDC
 has not entered into force 90 days after the signing of the
 protocol, any of the signatories may review its provisions
 with a view to obtaining an immediate defense contribution from
 West Germany.   In effect, this would give France additional
 time in which to accept EDC after it is clear that the other
 three powers, if necessary, will move ahead without France.
 Because the London study group did not develop specific
 alternatives to EDC, the problems of controls over German
 rearmament and payments by Germany for the support of Allied
 troops in the Federal Republic were not considered.   If
 Germany gets its sovereignty but a military alternative to EDC
 is not found, these two problems must be faced before the Bonn
 and Paris treaties can be successfully separated.
 The impasse in Paris has been a windfall for those West
 Germans who are unenthusiastic about close Western ties, and
 who believe that Germany's first policy objective is not re-
 armament or even sovereignty, but unification.   The past few
 weeks have seen increased discussion of neutrality, co-operation
 with East Germany, rapprochement with Moscow and , contra-
 dictorily, recovery of Germany's eastern territories.
 Nevertheless, by taking the lead in demanding German
 sovereignty, Adenauer seems to have precluded the formation
 of strong parliamentary opposition to himself or his policies.
 Most West Germans are not attracted by neutralism, still
 evidently believe in Adenauer's ability to adjust his pro-
 Western course to current developments, and are even skeptical
 of the wisdom of trying to proceed without France.

 FOREIGN EXCHANGE CRISIS THREATENS PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT
 The prestige of the present Pakistani government is ser-
 iously threatened by a developing foreign exchange crisis.
 Having sought to allay growing political opposition by promis-
 ing to make more imported consumer goods available, Karachi in
 the last month has found that a gap of at least $90,000,000
 will exist between the cost of essential imports during the
 next 12 months and the foreign exchange to pay for them.
 Since late 1952 Pakistan has enforced stringent controls
 on imports of consumer goods in  order to conserve foreign ex-
 change for industrial development.   These controls held 1953
 foreign exchange expenditure to half that of 1952 and enabled
 Karachi to maintain an over-all favorable balance of payments,
 in spite of an 18-percent drop in foreign exchange earnings.
 A large sterling deficit equivalent to $89,000,000 and a mod-
 erate dollar deficit of $21,000,000 nevertheless remained.
 In the absence of elections, Karachi apparently felt it
 could safely ignore grumbling among consumers as stocks dwin-
 dled and prices soared during late 1953 and early 1954.   The
 East Pakistan elections in March, however, jolted the govern-
 ment into awareness of the hostility it had incurred on eco-
 nomic as well as political grounds.   This awareness was re-
 flected in the program of increased consumer imports announced
 after the declaration of "governor's rule" in East Pakistan on
 30 May.
 In early June, Pakistani officials revealed that a decline
 in foreign exchange receipts during recent weeks indicated
 that the exchange available for consumer imports for the period
 July 1954-June 1955  would  be no more than the equivalent of
 $210,000,000.   Minimum essential consumer requirements were
 estimated at $300,000,000 and normal requirements at $450,000,000.
 The resultant future gap between supply and demand for consumer
 goods, coming after the austerity of the previous 18 months and
 the recent promises of relief, was considered most dangerous to
 political and economic stability.
 From the standpoint of United States objectives, the Ameri-
 can embassy in Karachi sees in the crisis three major potential
 dangers:   (1) weakening pro-American sentiment, especially since
 the larger amounts of economic aid scheduled for India may cre-
 ate doubts about the wisdom of Pakistan's alignment with the
 United States;  (2) lessening effectiveness of American military
 aid to Pakistan; and (3) increasing danger of effective Commu-
 nist activity, particularly in East Pakistan.

 The crisis comes at a particularly unpropitious period in
 Pakistan's political and economic development.   The Moslem
 League government is still shaken by its defeat in East Paki-
 stan and faces probable national elections in 1955, and the
 country is still only on the verge of deriving concrete bene-
 fits from its industrial development program.   The threat to
 Pakistan's stability, however, appears to be somewhat longer
 in range than Karachi's alarms have suggested.
 Order can probably be maintained in East Pakistan for at
 least the next few months, and longer if determined use of
 force is continued.   In West Pakistan, groups capable of effec-
 tively organizing the existing dissatisfaction have not yet
 appeared, although alliances among the disaffected are certain
 to materialize as national elections approach.   Furthermore, a
 certain amount of disillusionment regarding Pakistan's ties
 with the United States is inevitable under any conditions, since
 the amount of military aid Pakistan is likely to receive has
 been grossly exaggerated in the popular imagination.
 Moreover, additional economic aid beyond that already pro-
 grammed from American and Colombo Plan sources will not solve
 Pakistan's basic problem of finding a secure economic status in
 world markets.   Although domestic consumer goods production will
 increase, Pakistan will continue to depend almost entirely on
 its jute and cotton crops for foreign exchange earnings, and
 both these commodities are subject to world price fluctuations.
 Thus, while foreign aid in the form of additional supplies of
 consumer goods would provide a short-term boost for Karachi's
 political stock, there will continue to be a substantial gap,
 of which foreign exchange crises are but the reflection, between
 Pakistan's industrial and military ambitions and its economic
 capabilities.

 CHINESE NATIONALISTS DISRUPT ORBIT SHIPPING
 TO MAINLAND CHINA
 Through recent seizures of Soviet Orbit ships, the
 Chinese Nationalists have achieved considerable success in
 their attempt to disrupt shipping to major Chinese mainland
 ports. Their interference, which has denied ships carrying
 strategic cargoes from the European Satellites the use of
 ports north of Formosa, has become a major and costly annoy-
 ance to the Soviet bloc.
 The Chinese Nationalists began interfering with overseas
 shipping in the China trade on 4 October 1953, with the capture
 of the Polish tanker Praca in waters just east of the Bashi
 Channel between Formosa and the Philippines.  Previous Nation-
 alist interceptions had been only in the Formosa Strait,
 which has long been avoided by Orbit shipping.
 The second interception of a China-bound ship from Europe
 occurred on 13 May, when a Chinese Nationalist destroyer escort
 seized the Polish vessel Prezydent Gottwald 415 miles east of
 Formosa.   The third and most recent such incident was the
 capture on 23 June of the Soviet tanker Tuapse, bound for
 Shanghai.  The Tuapse was intercepted about 100 miles south of
 Formosa.
 Since the seizure of the Tuapse, no ship with industrial
 cargo from Communist Europe has attempted to proceed to Chinese
 Communist ports north of Formosa.  The total of such cargoes,
 particularly of bulk petroleum products, had been exceeding
 the amount that can be handled through Whampoa, China's single
 large port south of Formosa, for shipment by rail to the north.
 China's Orbit suppliers are faced with an immediate problem
 in the fact that since 23 June 13 vessels--Russian, Polish, and
 Finnish--with cargoes for China from the Satellites have passed
 the Indian Ocean.   Some have had to await instructions in the
 Singapore area.   Five of the seven Russian vessels in the area
 had left Singapore by 12 July declaring for Far East ports.   It
 is not clear, however, what course these vessels will take to
 lessen the risk of further interceptions.
 The problem with 13 strategic cargoes en route to China is
 that Whampoa can handle probably no more than a few at one
 time--the port has been averaging four overseas arrivals a month.
 Over the long run, some of this shipping would probably require

 an armed escort through Formosan waters, now patrolled by the
 American Seventh Fleet, to ensure prompt sea delivery of
 European Satellite exports to China.
 The Soviet Orbit can avoid the Nationalists entirely
 only by diverting Satellite cargoes, in excess of the amounts
 which Whampoa can take, to the long and more costly trans-
 Siberian rail haul.
 Excluding the two cargoes seized in May and June, the
 Satellites have shipped 180,000 tons of industrial cargoes
 past Formosa directly to North China since the first of the
 year.   In addition, most of the 92,000 tons of industrial
 imports from the Satellites delivered via Whampoa in the
 first six months of 1954 was probably moved overland to in-
 dustrial areas in the north.  These goods are internationally
 regarded as "strategic" and are embargoed for export to Commu-
 nist China by most Western European countries.  Swedish and
 Finnish vessels are the only non-Communist shipping that
 will carry them.

 MOSCOW DEVELOPS CLOSER RELATIONS WITH JAPAN
 During the past few months the Soviet Union has been
 quietly exploiting economic and other avenues of approach
 as a means of improving its relations with the Japanese
 government.  Moscow probably hopes in the short run to
 establish a de facto relationship--relying in the long run
 on Japan's deteriorating economic situation and the general
 trend of Far Eastern developments to force the Japanese into
 an accommodation with the Orbit.
 As long ago as last August, Malenkov referred in a major
 foreign policy speech to "the immediate significance" of nor-
 malizing relations with Japan.  Following this, Moscow pro-
 ceeded to return more than 1,400 Japanese prisoners of World
 War II, thereby removing one of the chief obstacles to the
 normalization of relations,
 25X1
 In January, Soviet skaters participated in a Japanese-sponsored
 international competition--the first time since World War II
 that nondiplomatic Soviet citizens had gone to Japan.   In May,
 a group of Soviet wrestlers took part in an international meet
 in Tokyo and Moscow sent representatives to the ECAFE Waters
 Resources Conference held there.
 In the most recent manifestation of friendship, Moscow
 appears to be laying down the red carpet for a delegation of
 16 Japanese Diet members visiting the Soviet Union on their
 return from the Stockholm Peace Conference.   Press reports
 indicate that besides a conducted three-week tour of the
 Soviet Union, Soviet authorities are offering prospects of
 increased trade, fishing concessions, and the return of Japan-
 ese prisoners still held in the USSR.

 Since it does not have formal relations with the USSR,
 the Japanese government has been reluctant to give official
 approval to Moscow's offers and overtures.  Recently, however,
 it has been responding to the increasing economic pressure to
 relax trade controls and travel restrictions.   In June, for
 the first time since World War II, the Japanese Foreign Min-
 istrv authorized an official delegation of agricultural and
 industrial experts to make an inspection tour of the USSR.
 On 8 July it agreed to issue a passport to a representative
 of the fishing industry to visit Moscow to discuss restoration
 of fishing rights in waters surrounding Soviet territory.  The
 Foreign Ministry has also approved procedures whereby a limited
 number of Soviet trade officials may enter Japan under private
 auspices for barter negotiations.
 Soviet trade with Japan is still negligible, constituting
 less than one percent of Japan's total foreign trade, and
 Moscow will undoubtedly continue its efforts to capitalize
 on the growing Japanese sentiment to improve commercial re-
 lations with-the Orbit.  There will probably be new offers of
 Soviet coal, lumber, oil and other raw materials; and Moscow
 may open Soviet waters to Japanese fishermen.
 Moscow probably feels there is not sufficient advantage
 to be gained in the immediate future to justify meeting Japanese
 conditions for a resumption of normal diplomatic relations,
 which include recognition of the San Francisco Peace Treaty
 and return of the former Japanese islands of Habomai and
 Shikotan.   Moreover, the Kremlin probably estimates that time
 is in its favor and, therefore, major concessions are not nec-
 cessary.

 READJUSTMENTS IN SATELLITE MILITARY POLICY
 A current readjustment of military policy in the Eastern
 European Satellites springs in part from economic considera-
 tions; in part, however, it reflects the achievement of
 critical goals in the build-up of Satellite ground-forces
 and a shift in emphasis to qualitative improvement.  Recent
 developments reflecting this readjustment include reduced
 military expenditures and some reductions in personnel
 strength, but also evidences of more attention to training
 and efficiency.  This readjustment is reflected primarily in
 the ground forces, while Satellite air forces continue their
 quantitative expansion.
 The annual budgets announced in the spring of 1954
 showed a leveling-off of military expenditures following
 several years of rising appropriations.   Published military
 allocations of two of the Satellites remained virtually at
 the 1953 level; three others showed reductions.   Only
 Czechoslovakia raised its military budget--by eight percent.
 (The East German budget does not reveal military appropri-
 ations.)
 The sharpest reduction was in the Rumanian budget, in
 which the military allocation was about 37 percent lower
 than in 1953.  This reduction is partly accounted for by a
 cut of up to 50 percent in officers' pay and allowances
 last February or March which also affected supervisory
 personnel in the civilian economy.
 Personnel strength of the Satellite armies has been
 stabilized at an estimated 1,115,000--a drop of some
 160,000 since mid-1953.   Part of this drop reflects a
 re-evaluation of available information, but there have
 been actual cuts in strength in some countries,  The number
 of identified divisions has increased, however, from 76 a
 year ago to 82 at present.  Although most of these units
 are considerably under strength, the existence of a large
 trained reserve together with a continuing reserve training
 program would make it possible to bring them up to strength
 quickly in an emergency.    Meanwhile, except for an expected
 increase in the size of the East German  army, the Satellites
 will probably maintain their armies at approximately their
 present size.

 Deliveries of Soviet weapons have tapered off since
 1952.  Although certain deficiencies still exist, it is
 believed that the initial re-equipment of most Satellite
 armies has been completed.   However, sightings during the
 past year of new types of Soviet weapons in the hands of
 East German and Czech soldiers indicate continued deliv-
 eries to these countries.
 There is evidence in several Satellite armies of an
 increased emphasis on training.   Particularly noteworthy
 progress has occurred in East Germany and Poland, both of
 which showed deficiencies in training in 1953.   A vigorous
 effort to improve training, morale and discipline in the
 East German army appears to have achieved results, which
 were evident in the level of training reached this spring.
 In Poland observations of a regimental level command-post
 exercise (CPX) in April and of a division level or higher
 CPX early in June suggest that large-scale maneuvers are
 planned for the autumn; they also indicate an effort to
 improve the capabilities of the Polish officer corps,
 which has lacked adequate command experience.
 In the other Satellites, the training schedule appears
 to be normal for this time of year, except in Rumania,
 where the employment of troops to meet emergency needs of
 the civilian economy during the winter and spring caused
 a month's delay in the start of the summer field training
 program.
 A further indication of the current emphasis on
 training of Satellite armies is the replacement since mid-
 1953 of five of the six Soviet military attaches in the
 Eastern European Satellites.   All the new appointees are
 highly qualified professional army officers with extensive
 combat experience; four of them are Heroes of the Soviet
 Union, as is the military attache in Czechoslovakia who
 was appointed in 1950.   They replace officers with less
 distinguished combat records.   Since the Soviet military
 attache in a Satellite capital is mainly responsible for
 the training and supervision of the local armed forces,
 these appointments suggest a stepped-up effort to improve
 Satellite combat capabilities.

 IRRITATIONS IN SWISS-AMERICAN RELATIONS
 COARDENTIAL
 Swiss relations with the United States have recently
 been under strain on a number of issues, thus raising the
 possibility that Switzerland will be less co-operative with
 Washington in such matters as East-West trade  and the
 Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.
 The most important issue to the Swiss is the United States
 Tariff Commission's recommendation for an increase in duties
 on watches,. an action which has aroused widespread appre-
 hension and strong Swiss protests.  The Swiss fear it portends
 a trend which would undermine their country's ability to
 support itself through a high volume of foreign trade.  They
 are further disturbed by the information that the Department
 of Justice is investigating possible violations of anti-trust
 laws growing out of American marketing arrangements of the
 Swiss watch cartel.
 Switzerland's traditional sensitivity about its
 neutrality has been aroused by a number of other recent
 developments.   Criticism has been leveled at the interception
 by the United States in early June of a duly licensed ship-
 ment of Swiss arms to Guatemala.   Washington's recently
 announced proposal to send a loyalty board to investigate a
 few American UN employees in Geneva is resented by Bern as an
 act which could logically provoke a parallel request from
 other countries.
 The Swiss are also somewhat irritated at the American
 attitude toward their continued membership in the Neutral
 Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.  Agreeing that this
 supervisory body is not functioning according to the armistice
 terms and is of benefit only to the Communists, they wish to
 withdraw, but they refuse to do so in'a way that might suggest
 acting in response to American demands.
 Switzerland's growing irritation at the United States is
 unlikely to result in any positive action of an unfriendly
 nature but can easily result in the withholding of co-operation,
 particularly in matters-relating to strategic trade with the
 Orbit.   In this field, the United States has made considerable
 progress in recent years in obtaining Swiss adoption of controls
 parallel to COCOM's.   Early this year, however, Switzerland
 charged that certain COCOM countries were applying more,
 stringent criteria to Swiss shipments to Communist China than
 to their own; and since that time. it has persistently rejected
 American requests to institute controls on the important transit
 trade in strategic goods conducted through Swiss free ports.
