 The Washington Merry-Go-Round
 By Jack Anderson
 President Nixon's pledge in
 Peking to pull American mili-
 tary forces out of Taiwan, pre-
 dictably, has raised howls from
 the Republican right.
 The same hardheads, who
 called for President Truman
 in the 1950s to "unleash" Chi-
 ang Kai-shek, are now railing
 against Mr. Nixon for promis-
 ing to remove the American
 lease. When old Chiang is at
 last unleashed, they warn in
 anguish, his island redoubt
 will be overrun by the Red
 Chinese.
 Long before Mr. Nixon wa
 invited to Peking, our militar
 strategists  fiercely  debate
 whether Chiang could wit
 vd an amphibious assault.

 Soviet Threat
 Since Mao Tse-tung's main
 forces are tied up on the So-
 viet border, where Russia has
 now deployed nearly a million
 men, he would have trouble
 mounting "a major offensive
 against Taiwan."
 In any event, the Pentagon
 strategists  believe  the U.S.
 commitment to defend Taiwan
 in case of attack "should be
 more than adequate to deter
 the CPR."
 The  Central  Intelligence
 Agency, after detailed survey
 of Taiwan's defenses, identi-
 ied "four major and two mi-
 or beach areas suitable for
 mphibious landings."

 should be deployed. This
 should not require that the
 U.S. maintain additional forces
 in the Pacific.
 Footnote: Countering these
 arguments, the U.S. mission
 on Taiwan has warned that
 "the CPR military capabilities
 will improve over the next
 decade with continued empha-
 sis on the improvement of nu-
 clear weapons capabilities."
 As for Chiang's ability to
 throw back an amphibious as-
 sault, the mission contends:
 "The DOD report relies on the
 deployment of forces to ac-
 quire favorable ratios. This
 can  be accomplished  under
 ideal conditions, but rapid lat-
 eral movement is extremely
 difficult due to the communi-
 cations network and terrain."
 Strange Reward
 President Nixon has asked
 the Senate to promote a high-
 ranking diplomat who only 20
 months ago was exposed for
 trying to cover up the Mylai
 massacre of Vietnamese civil-
 ians.
 Secretary of State William
 Rogers put tall, balding James
 May at the head of the De-
 cember 1 promotion list sent
 first to the White House, then
 forwarded to the Senate For-
 eign Relations Committee. It
 calls for May's promotion to
 the second highest level of
 foreign service officer.
 The suave May, who dressed
 like a fashion plate even in
 m gg`' Quantngai province
 where he was top civilian ad-
 viser, figured prominently in
 a House report on the mas-
 sacre.
 A special Armed Services
 Investigating subcommittee, in
 a report released  July  15,
 1970, described May's role in
 the cover-up this way:
 "The Senior Province Ad-
 visor, Mr. James May, was a
 State Department for e 19 n
 service officer free of any re-
 sponsibility to Americal Divi-
 sion or its commander.
 "The testimony clearly es-
 tablished that his headquarters
 was apprised of atrocity alle-
 gations by Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment sources. It further es-
 that members of his
 tablished
 staff had discussed the allega-
 tion and its investigation with i
 representatives ? of  Americal
 Division, and with others . .. '~
 ,,It   further    demonstrated
 that he had personally been

 that his unit had demon-

 admittedly unusual allegations
 and its investigation, Mr. May
 claimed to have no recollec-
 tion                          i'.
 of the incident."
 The House Mylai subcom-
 headed by the Rep. F.
 mittee,
 Edward Hebert (D-La.), said
 failure of May's headquarters
 to report the incident "raised
 the question about where the
 decision was made to suppress
 any reporting of the allega-
 tion."
 ` Pentagon strategists drafted
 an elaborate scenario, citing
 the difficulties of an amphi-
 bious attack from the main-
 land, and concluded: "When
 the reserves are deployed, the
 GRC (Government, Republic
 of China) would outnumber
 the CPR threat in any sector
 by at least two to one. over-
 all, the CRC would outnumber
 the assault force by at least
 five to one."
 Adds the secret Pentagon
 study: "If GRC control of the
 air and sea were to be threat-
 ened, or it appeared that a
 much larger amphibious at-

 Inside the policy councils,.
 no one was more militant over
 the two tiny islands ? than
 Richard Nixon who now, Ironi-
 cally, considers both Quemoy
 and Matsu to be expendable.
 This doesn't mean he will.
 hand over the two Islands to
 Chou En-lai as_poker chips on
 the Peking conference table.
 But the United States no long-
 er will help Chiang, Kai-shek
 defend them.
 The U.S. commitment to de-
 fend Taiwan itself, it should
 be emphasized, is still in. ef-
 fect.  But  the  commitment
 won't.. continue to  include
 Quemoy and Matsu.
 U.S. -military experts believe
 Chiang is quite capable of de-
 fending the islands without
 U.S. help. But they think he
 would be wiser to negotiate
 the reserves are deployed, the
 GRC would outnumber the
 CPR threat In any sector by
 at least two to one. Overall,
 the GRC would outnumber
 the assault force by at least
 five to one.
 "First the GRC amphibious
 capability could be reduced by
 two-thirds. The ability to land
 ,000 marines on the Penghus
 5
 (guarding the approaches to
 Taiwan)  as  reinforcements
 would be more than adequate
 for the defense of that area.
 Such a reduction would free
 at least 2,900 men from the
 Navy, saving the GRO about
 $820,000 annually in manpow-
 er costs, and obviating the
 need for further LST re
 pairs .. .
 "Secondly, GRC ocean con-
 trol and surveillance forces
 could also be reduced, per-
 haps at least one-third, be-
 cause  operations  along  the
 mainland coast and In support
 of offshore island resupply
 would be unnecessary. This
 would save the GRC at least
 $530,000 annually in manpow
 er costs ..."
 The study also provides a
 "As  indicated  previously,
 based on U.S. World War II
 and Korea experience, an. at-
 tack-to-defense ratio of three
 to one is normally required
 to assure the success of an
 amphibious attacking (assum-
 ing  the  attacker  can  gain
 naval and air superiority)."
 On this subject, the military
 experts believe Chiang has
 enough naval power to deter
 the Chinese Communists from
 attempting an amphibious as-
 sault. ?
 U.S. Support
 Declares' the study: "Since
 we seek to avoid a direct U.S -
 CPR confrontation, we have
 assisted the  GRC  through
 MAP (military aid program)
 in developing a navy adequate
 supply the offshore islands}
 (and) Taiwan.
 "The GRC  navy  can a:^
 complish all these miss.,
 .now. It will retain these ctew
 -bilitles through FY73 (fiscal
 year 1973) without major in-
 vestments in new ships or
 craft  largely  because  the
 CPR does not appear to. bo
 developing  naval  offensive
 forces."
 U.S. officials have suggest-n,
 ed in their secret discussions, ?y
 meanwhile, that old Chiang
 Kai-shek  has  enough   cash
 stashed away to pay more of
 his own military bills. He I$-
 holding holding the money to finance
 his dream of reconquerin g
 the Chinese mainland.
 The U.S. mission in Taiwan'.
 has reported in - a "secre.t
 working paper" that "we do,
 know privately that the GRC,
 has  considerable  sums  of<
 money in special funds, most-.
 ly marked for contingency
 use in mainland recovery"
 The  Americans,  however,
 believe Chiang is so obsessed"-
 with his dream of returning""'
 to the mainland that he won't
 spend the invasion funds for
 any other purpose.
 "The possibility that these
 funds would be used for rou-
 tine military expenditures," .'.
 states the report, "is remote,
 and they would be disbursed
 only as a last resort."

 The Washington Merry-Go-Round                             ---- -- Protesters Leak Their Own Secrets
 By Jack Anderson   I nation reserved for the
 I kest of the CIA's secrets:
 The planners in the White
 House basement, who howled
 in pain over our disclosure of
 their India-Pakistan secrets,
 have slipped fragments from
 the same secret documents to
 their friends in the press.
 This  illustrates  how  the
 White House uses official se-
 crecy to control the flow of
 news to the public. Favorable
 1 facts are leaked out; unfavora-
 ble news is suppressed.
 The official leakers are now
 spreading the word that Presi-
 dent Nixon's pro-Pakistan pol-
 icy was not the disaster it ap-
 peared but really saved West
 Pakistan  from  dismember-
 ment.
 As evidence, the boys in the
 'basement leaked a few selec-
 tive secrets to our column-
 ;writing                     colleague, Joseph
 Alsop, who has excellent con-
 taGts at the highest levels of
 government.
 Alsop stated "on positive au-
 thority" that the U.S. govern-
 ment had "conclusive proof"
 Alsop's 'Proof'
 Alsop told us he never read
 the CIA reports himself. He
 had no way of knowing, there-
 fore, that his sources gave him
 only part of the story.
 These  CIA  digests,  true
 enough, raised the possibility
 of an Indian attempt to crush
 West Pakistan. But the same
 disgests also suggested India
 would accept an early cease-
 fire.
 Here is a typical excerpt:
 "There have been reports that
 (Indian Prime Minister) Gan-
 dhi would accept a cease-fire
 ,and international mediation as
 soon as East Bengal 'had been
 liberated  ... On the other
 hand, we have had several re-
 cent reports that India now in-
 Keating that India has no ter-
 ritorial ambitions and wished
 only to end the conflict with
 the least possible bloodshed.
 Dubious `Proof
 It is clear from the secret
 documents in our possession
 that the CIA had no "conclu-
 sive proof" of an Indian plan
 to dismember West Pakistan.
 The CIA had received a num-
 ber of reports that a major In-
 dian offensive might be immi-
 nent on the western front. But
 these were discounted by both
 the State and Defense Depart-
 ments.
 Only Henry Kissinger, the
 President's foreign policy czar,
 seemed eager to believe the
 worst.
 Alsop's sources also told
 him that President Nixon in-
 tervened with the Kremlin,
 threatening "an ugly show-
 down," to stop Mrs. Gandhi's
 army from carving up West
 Pakistan.
 In response, Alsop claims
 that the  Kremlin hurriedly
 viet Union . .  ,"  according to
 the CIA. "Kuznestsov has told
 Indian officials that the Soviet
 Union is not prepared to rec-
 ognize Bangladesh until Dacca
 falls  and   until  the  Indian
 army' successfully    liberates
 Bangladesh  from      Pakistani
 forces."
 The question of an Indian
 offensive against West Paki-
 stan was brought up the next
 day by Soviet Ambassador Ni-
 kolai  Pegov.  Reported  the
 CIA:
 "Pegov  pointed out that
 India has achieved a marvel-
 ous military victory. Pakistan
 is no longer a military force,
 and it is therefore unneces-
 sary for India to launch an of-
 fensive into West Pakistan to
 crush a military machine that
 no longer exists.
 "If India should decide to
 take Kashmir, Pegov added,
 the Soviet Union would not in-
 terfere, but India would have
 to accomplish this objective
 within the shortest possible
 time." .
 Joseph Alsop Is an enter-
 prising and conscientious col-
 umnist. He acknowledged to
 us that "it is possible to be
 lied to on the very highest
 level." But he assured us his
 source  had "never lied be-
 fore."
 The evidence In our posses-
 sion, however, suggests that
 the White House Is playing
 peekaboo with CIA secrets to
 distort the truth.
 Bell-McClure s7ndlcat
 tends not only to liberate East
 Bengal but also to straighten
 its borders in Kashmir and to
 destroy  West Pakistan's air
 and armored forces."'
 The strongest CIA warning
 was sent to the White House
 on December 10. "According
 to a source who has access to
 information on activities in
 Prime Minister Gandhi's of-
 fice," declared the report, "as
 soon as the situation in East
 IPakistan  is settled, Indian
 forces will launch a major of-
 fensive  against  West Paki-
 stan."
 But the CIA also took note
 of repeated Indian assurances
 to American Ambassador Ken
 of India's intention to crush
 the main body of the Pakistan
 army in West Pakistan. This
 positive proof., he wrote, was
 "the centerpiece of every one
 of the CIA's daily reports to
 the White House during the
 crisis period."
 We  have  read the CIA's
 daily reports to the White
 House during the India-Paki-
 stan war. They are stamped
 "Top Secret Umbra," a desig-
 dispatched  Deputy  Foreign
 Minister Vasily Kuznestsov to
 New Delhi on December 12 to
 tell Mrs. Gandhi not to attack
 West Pakistan.
 The secret CIA report on
 his mission, however, doesn't
 mention    any   ultimatum
 against attacking West Paki-
 stan.

 in India on 12 December to

 ALTHOUGH the  precar-

 East still hasn't been broken,
 a. settlement  is likely to
 'prove as rocky and tortuous
 as ever.
 This Is Illustrated in pain-

 United  Nations  delegation
 during` last month's General
 Assembly debate on the Mid-
 east. The secret messages. also
 provide a fascinating insight
 into the UN cloakrooms.
 The U.S.. worked tirelessly.
 behind the scenes to find a
 compromise resolution which
 both the Arabs and Israelis
 "Ambassa 9r    i usn
 sought out Fonm[n-ifid7 in

 discuss Egyptian draft res re

 Egyptian draft res appeared
 from initial reading to be
 generally satisfactory, Bush

 block for USG (U.S. govern-

 "Rlad replied in negative

 The Washington Merry-Go-Round
 THE WASHINGTON POST Friday. Ian. 14, 1972  D 1q
 Rep. Whalley and Public Funds
 By Jack Anderson
 Rep. J. Irving Whalley (R-
 Pa.), a power on the House
 Foreign    Affairs  Committee
 and a former United Nations
 delegate,  has  taken illegal
 kickbacks  from    employees,
 padded his payroll and chis-
 eled House funds to pay for
 his Christmas gifts.
 The Windber, Pa., wheeler-
 dealer has been cheating the
 taxpayers this way quite me-
 thodically behind a respecta-
 ble front as a church elder,
 bank president and legislator-
 diplomat.
 President Nixon named him
 in 1969 to a one-year term at
 the U.N., where he spoke for
 the U.S. on such subjects as
 Red  China, Korea and the
 U.N. budget. But while the
 world weighed his words at
 the U.N. Whalley was gouging
 the taxpayers in his Pennsyl-
 vania district like a back-coun-
 try Bobby Baker.
 We reported last September
 that Whalley had demanded
 kickbacks from a.former aide,
 and we have been investigat-
 ing his activities ever since.
 We can now prove that he
 has put more than a dozen edi-
 tors, politicians and business-
 men on the public payroll.
 Many were required to give
 him kickbacks in the form of
 personal services; others give
 kickbacks in.goods; some were
 compelled to pay their own of-
 fice expenses, and sometimes
 even Whalley's expenses, from
 their House salaries.
 We can also show that Whal-
 ley raided House stationery
 funds, which regulations say
 must be used by members
 solely "for the purpose of sta-
 tionery and other supplies."
 He stretched the regulations
 to Include book ends, scarves
 and pen-and-pencil sets, which
 he then gave out as Christmas
 gifts. The recipients, of course,
 were unaware that as taxpay-
 ers they had helped pay for
 their own gifts.
 Fiscal Finagling
 In one of the many cases we
 investigated, Whalley paid for
 his political literature 'with
 U.S. Treasury funds. Here's
 how he worked it:
 One of Whalley's staunch
 political allies is C. Robert
 Collary, proprietor of Capitol
 Press,  a non-union printing
 shop in Duncanville, Pa. A pil-
 lar of his community, Collary
 is also a powerful GOP com-
 mitteeman  in  Blair County
 and chairman of a Republican
 "zone."
 We discovered that Collary
 has done more than $1,500 in
 free printing for the congress-
 man, much of it political.
 Ordinarily, a congressm
 would pay for the printing o
 of his campaign contributions
 Instead,   halley  used th
 House Disbursing Office a,
 most like it were his persona
 checking account.
 Checks drawn at Whalley's
 order from the House show
 that Whalley put Collary on
 the payroll as a "staff" worker
 in 1967, paying him $997 that
 year. In fiscal 1971, Whalley
 paid him another $5,932.
 Collary has kicked back
 $1,500 to $2,000 to Whalley in
 the form of free, printing.
 In a long talk with my asso-
 ciate Les Whitten, Collary at
 first said his free printing for
 Whalley amounted only, to a
 "little letter press work." He
 later admitted it could have
 amounted to as much as $2,000
 but said this might include
 $300 he spent on his travels
 for Whalley.
 Asked whether he regarded
 the free printing as. a kick-
 back, Collary snapped back:
 "Absolutely  not.  Everything
 was on the up and up."
 Whalley told us that such
 arrangements  were, common
 in  Congress, although   this
 runs counter to our 'experi
 ence. He explained that by hir-
 ing staff members for brief pe-
 riods  at a time in various
 parts of his district, he saves
 taxpayers the cost of opening
 up field offices in a variety of
 towns.
 We will have more reports
 on the 11-year House veteran
 in future columns.

 more aid.
 The report is based ups
 the  confidential  remark
 picked up by the CIA, of
 high Foreign Ministry officil
 named Hoang Muoi. Here ar
 the highlights:
 . "Muoi stated that Chines
 Premier  Chou  En-lal  ha,
 made a secret, trip to Hand
 following the July, 1971, visi
 of Dr. Kissinger . to Peking
 Chou assured the DRV (Norti
 Vietnamese.  government)  d
 continued. Chinese support. .
 "On the subject of aid, Mud
 stated that the Chinese, i;
 order to convince the DRV d,
 their continued . support has
 agreed to give more aid in thl
 1971-72  period.  The Soviets
 were thus forced to increasR
 their aid . in order to balance
 off the Chinese assistance.
 "The Soviet aid agreement
 which   resulted from SovieC
 President Podgorney's visit ii
 October, was bigger than tht
 1970 agreement.
 "Muoi said that during th,
 Podgorny  visit,  the Soviets
 proposed a friendship treat
 with the DRV. Muoi said th4
 DRV refused  the offer be
 cause it would have, certainly
 antaginized China and, in an;
 event, the DRV does not nee
 such a treat to get what
 wants from the Soviets."

 the United States used the
 at of  arge-scale military
 a_ to Pak s an as a per' svcTTg-
 under  heavy pressure from
 Pakistan for arms aid and that
 he, in turn, was putting the
 heat on the United States to
 help furnish it.
 "You should tell King Hus-
 sein we fully appreciate heavy
 pressure  he  feels  himself
 under by virtue of request
 from  Pakistan,"  Irwin  in-
 structed U.S. Ambassador L.
 Dean Brown.
 "We are nevertheless not
 yet in a position to give him
 definite response. Whole sub-
 ject remains under intensive
 review at very high level of
 USG (U.S. Government).
 "We are fully alive to your
 delicate situation in not being
 able to give definite answer to
 King's urgent pleas. But we
 ask you to bear with us and
 put situation to Hussein in
 best light possible."
 cables also show that,
 while direct U.S. arms ship-
 ments to Pakistan were ruled
 out from the start, the United
 States came within an ace of
 providing backdoor weapons
 assistance through several of
 Pakistan's Arab allies.
 The backdoor scheme was
 never adopted, but the cables
 show that the United States
 wanted India to continue to
 think the possibility was immi-
 nent, thus strengthening Paki-
 stan's position.
 The most tevealing of the
 cables was addressed to the
 American Embassies in Saudi
 Arabia and New Delhi:
 "In view of intelligence) re-
 ports spelling out Indian mili-
 tary objectives in West Paki-
 stan, we do not want in any
 way to ease GOI's (Govern-
 ment of India's) concern re
 help Pakistan might receive
 from outside sources.
 "Consequently, embassy
 should give GOI no repeat no
 assurances re third country
 transfers" The secret cable
 was signed by Under Secre-
 tary of State John Irwin.
 Another cable from Irwin to
 the U.S. Embassy in Jordan
 shows that King Hussein was
 Undersea Wealth
 The big world powers have
 been greedily eying the vast
 mineral wealth on the ocean
 bottom. But feckless United
 Nations attempts to settle the
 issue of ownership have all
 but collapsed.
 The confusion has now led
 the Defense Department into
 scheming with Russia to swap
 our rights to the mineral de-
 posits for a shaky guarantee
 of total freedom of the seas. .,
 These are among the alarm-
 ing secret findings of an unu-
 two-man task force as
 sual
 ,
 signed to investigate the prdb-,
 lem by Senate Interior Chair-
 man Henry Jackson, (D-Wash.).
 Senator Jackson feared that
 the State Department might
 surrender  U.S. sea bottom
 rights, so he dispatched two
 trusted Senate experts to the
 U.N. Seabed Committee in Ge-
 neva last summer..
 The  two  aides,  Charles
 Cook, a land and mineral law
 specialist,  and  Merrill  En-
 glund,    the                                                                               conservation
 minded chief aide  to Sen.
 Lee Metcalf, (D-Mont.) have
 now readied their draft report
 on the subject.
 Entitled "The Law and the
 Seas Crisis,"  the  nine-page
 draft agrees with the Nixon
 administration that the United
 States must guard its stake in
 the ocean's fish, minerals, gas,
 oil and other treasures.
 But while the administra-
 tion is challenging the claims
 of Ecuador and Peru to sover-
 ignty 200 miles offshore, the
 Senate observers recommend
 we consider adopting the 200-
 mile limit ourselves. We pres-
 ently claim a 12-mile limit.
 The switch would cause con-
 sternation at the State Depart-
 ment, which is upholding the
 right of American tuna boats
 to fish inside Ecuador's 200-
 mile limit.
 Special criticism is reserved
 for the unusual dealings lle-
 tween  the  Defense  Depart-
 ment and the Soviet Union
 over the ocean wealth. The re-
 port warns that Defense, "Sup-
 ported by the U.S.S.R.," is try-
 ng to get a formal world
 guarantee that warships can
 go anywhere they want.
 "We fear," states the report,
 "that the Defense Department
 might urge the administration
 to abandon its deep-sea bed
 mining  objectives ... as a
 trade off."
 Quickie Auto Titles
 Alabama,  known  for  its
 quickie divorces, has now de-
 veloped a new legal racket:
 quickie auto registrations.
 This is a great convenience
 for car thieves, reckless driv1
 ers and motorists with unsafe
 cars.
 To  test how  the  racket
 works, a car was selected from
 a nationwide stolen-car alert.
 The make,  year and serial
 number, together with $30
 were mailed to Probate Judge
 Leland Enzor of Andalusia,
 Ala.
 Fast as you can jump-wire a
 jeep, Enzor sent back a regis-
 tration and Alabama tags to a
 general delivery box in down-
 town Manhattan.
 We questioned Enzor's chief
 clerk,  T.  Wayne  Daughtry,
 about the quickie tags. He said
 two  other Alabama judges
 also service out-of-state driv-
 ers. He says Enzo chages $9
 a tag and handles a brisk 30 to
 35 out-of-state registrations a
 day.
 To douse the wildfire, Rep.
 Bill Ryan (D-N.Y.) has asked
 the  Justice  Department  to
 help him draft a bill to end
 the registration-by-mail racket.

 MEMORANDUM FOR
 RECORD
 SUBJECT: Washington Spe-
 cial Action Group meeting on
 Indo - Pakistan hostilities; 8
 December, 1971
 1. The N.S.C. Washington
 Special Action Group met in
 the Situation Room, the White
 House, at 1100, Wednesday,
 8 December to consider the
 Indo-Pakistan situation. The
 meeting was chaired by Dr.
 I Kissinger.

 Group 4 downgraded at 3-
 year intervals; declassified
 after 12 years.
 3. Summary. Dr. Kissinger
 suggested that India might be
 attempting, through calculat-
 ed.destruction of Pak armored
 and air forces to render Pak-
 istan impotent. He requested
 that the Jordanian interest in
 assisting Pakistan not be
 turned off, but rather kept in
 a holding pattern. He asked
 that Pak capabilities in Kash-
 mir be assessed.
 4. Mr. Helms opened the
 eeting by briefing the cur-
 ent situation. In the East,
 he Indians have broken the
 me at Comilla. Only major
 var crossings prevent them
 rom investing Dacca. The
 ndians are advancing rapid-
 throughout
 11 major PakL.O.C.'s in the
 ast are now vulnerable. In
 he West, the Paks are now
 laiming Punth, inside the
 ndian border. However, the
 aks are admitting fairly
 eavy casualties in the fight-
 ng. Tank battles are appar-
 ntly taking place in the
 ind/Rajasthan  area.  Mrs.
 andhi has indicated that be-
 ore heeding a U.N. call for
 ease-fire,  she intends to
 traighten out the southern
 border of Azad Kashmir. It is
 reported that prior to termi-
 nating  present  hostilities,
 Mrs. Gandhi intends to at-
 empt to eliminate Pakistan's
 r and air force capabil-
 ties. Thus far only India and
 hutan have recognized Ban-
 ladesh. It is believed that
 he Soviets have held off rec-
 gnition primarily so as not
 o rupture relations with the
 Paks. Soviet action on the
 matter of recognition, how-
 ver, may be forthcomingin
 e near future.
 5. Mr. Sisco inquired how
 long the Paks might be ex-
 petted to hold out in East
 Pakistan, to which Mr. Helms
 replied 48 to 72 hours. the
 time to reach the ultimate
 climax is probably a func-
 tion of the difficulties en-
 countered In river crossings.
 6. Assessing the situation
 in the West; General Ryan
 indicated that he did not see
 the Indians pushing too. hard
 at this time, rather they seem
 content with a holding ac-
 tion.
 7.  Dr.  Kissinger  asked
 how long it would. take, to
 shift Indian forces. from East
 to West. General Ryan said
 it might take a reasonably
 long time to move all the
 forces, but that the airborne
 brigade  could  be  moved
 quickly, probably within a
 matter of five or six days.
 8. Dr. Kissinger inquired
 about refugee aid. After a
 discussion with Mr. Williams
 it was determined that only`'
 a very small number of U.S.
 dollars earmarked for ref-
 ugee  relief  was  actually
 entering the Indian economy.
 Contrary to the sense of the
 last meeting,  the Indians
 have actually lost foreign
 exchange in the process of
 caring for refugees. In any
 event, the entire relief ef-
 fort is currently suspended
 in both. India and Pakistan.
 9. pr.. Kissinger then em-
 phasized that the President
 has made it clear that no
 further  foreign  exchange,
 PL-480 commodities, or de-
 velopment loans could be as-
 signed to India without ap-
 proval of the White House.
 Mr.  Williams  stated there
 was no problem of anything
 sliding through.
 10. Dr. Kissinger inquired
 what the next turn of the
 screw might be. Mr. Williams
 said that the only other pos-
 sible option was taking a po-
 Associated Press
 David Packard
 sition concerning aid material
 currently  under  contract.
 This however would be a
 very messy  problem inas-
 much as we would be dealing
 with irrevocable letters of
 credit. Mr. Williams further
 stated that we would have to
 take possession of material
 that was being consigned to
 the Indians by U.S. contrac-
 tors and thus would be com-
 pelled , to pay U.S. suppliers,
 resulting in claims against
 the U.S.G.
 11. Mr. Packard said that
 all of this could be done, but
 agreed that it would be a
 very laborious and difficult
 problem. He further elaborat-
 ed that all the items involved
 would have to be located, the
 United States would have to
 take ownership, settle with
 suppliers, locate warehousing,
 etc. Nevertheless, if such was
 desired it could be done. Mr.
 Williams said that in a very
 limited way this type of ac-
 tion had been taken against
 some Mid-East countries, but
 that it had taken years to
 settle the claims.
 12.  Dr.  Kissinger asked
 how India was handling next
 year's development loan pro-
 gram, to which Mr. Williams
 responded that nothing was
 under negotiation at  'the
 present time.
 13. Dr. Kissinger inquired
 about next year's  [A.LD.]
 budget. Mr. Williams stated
 that what  goes  into  the
 budget did not represent a
 commitment. Dr.  Kissinger
 stated that current orders
 are not to put anything into
 the  budget for  A.I.D. to
 India.  It was not to   be
 leaked that A.I.D. had put
 money in the budget for
 India, only  to  have  the
 "wicked" White House take
 it out.
 14. Dr. Kissinger suggested
 that the key issue if the
 Indians turn on West Pakis-
 tan is Azad Kashmir. If the
 Indians smash the Pak air
 force and the armored forces
 we would have a deliberate
 Indian attempt to force the
 disintegration  of  Pakistan.
 The elimination of the Pak
 armored  and  air      forces
 would make the Paks de-
 fenseless. It would turn West
 Pakistan into a client state.
 The possibility elicits a num-
 ber of questions. Can we al-
 low a U.S. ally to go down
 completely while we partic-
 ipate in a blockade?. Can we
 allow the Indians to scare
 us off, believing that if U.S.
 supplies are needed they will
 not be provided?
 15. Mr. Sisco stated that
 if  the  situation  were  to
 evolve as Dr. Kissinger had
 indicated then,  of  course,
 there was a serious risk to
 the viability of West Paki-
 stan. Mr. Sisco doubted, how-
 ever, that the Indians had
 this as their objective. He
 indicated that Foreign Min-
 ister Singh told Ambassador
 Keating that India had no
 intention of taking any Pak
 territory. Mr. Sisco said it
 must also be kept in mind
 that Kashmir is really dis-
 puted territory.
 16. Mr. Helms then stated
 that earlier he had omitted
 mentioning  that  Madame
 Gandhi, when referring to
 China, expressed the hope
 that there would be no Chi-
 nese                                                                        intervention  in  the
 West. She said that the So-
 viet had cautioned her that
 the Chinese might rattle the
 sword in Laddakh but that
 he Soviets have promised
 o take appropriate counter-
 ction if this should occur.
 r.  Helms  indicated  that
 here was no Chinese build-
 p at this time but, never-
 heless, even without a build-
 p they could "make mo-
 ions and rattle the sword."
 17. Turning then to the
 question of military support
 of Pakistan, Dr. Kissinger re-
 ferred to an expression of in-
 terest by King Hussein rela-
 tive to the provision of
 F-104's  to  Pakistan,  and
 asked how we could      get
 Jordan into q holding pattern
 to allow the President time
 to consider the issue. Dr.
 Kissinger also asked whether
 we should attempt to convey
 to the Indians and the press
 that.a major attack on West
 Pakistan would be consid-
 ered in a very serious light
 by this country.
 18. Mr. Packard explained
 that we could not authorize
 the Jordanians to do any-
 thing that the U.S.G. could
 not do. If hte U.S.G. could
 not do. If the U.S.G. could
 Stan, we could not allow.
 Jordan to do so. If a third
 country had material that
 the U.S.G. did not have, that
 was one thing, but we could
 not allow Jordan to transfer
 the 104's unless we make a
 finding that the Paks; them-
 selves, were eligible to pur-
 chase them from us directly..
 19. Dr. Kissinger suggested
 that if we had not cut the
 sale of arms to Pakistan, the
 current problem would not
 exist. Mr. Packard agreed.
 20. Dr. Kissinger suggested
 that perhaps we never really
 analyzed what the real dan-
 ger was when we were turning off the arms to Pakistan.
 21. Mr. Packard suggested
 that  another  consideration
 in the Jordan issue is that if
 Jordan delivers this equip-
 ment we would be expected
 to replace it.. Ambassador
 Johnson stated we do not
 have any more M.A.P. left.
 22.  Dr.  Kissinger states
 that what we may be wit-
 nessing is a situation where-
 in a country [India] equipped
 and supported by the Soviets
 may be turning half of Paki-
 stan into an important state
 and $he. other half into a
 vassal.  We  must consider
 what other countries may be
 thinking of our action.
 23.      Mr. Helms  asked
 about our. ,LENTO relation.
 ships    with Pakistan: Am-
 bassador Johnson stated we
 hall     no  legal obligations
 towards  Pakistan in  the .
 CENTO context: Dr. Kissjn-
 'ger agreed but added that
 neither did we have legal ob-
 ligations                                                                                                           toward  India  in
 1962 when we formulated
 the air defense agreement.
 We  must  consider    what
 would be the impact of the
 current  situation  in the
 larger complex of world af-
 fairs.
 24. Dr. Kissinger said that
 we must look at the prob-
 lem                                                                                                  in terms  of Security
 Council guarantees in the
 Mid-East and the impact on
 other areas. We must look
 at the military supply situa-
 tion. One could make a. case,
 he argued, that we have done
 everything two weeks . too
 late in the current situation.
 25. Mr. Packard stated that
 perhaps the only satisfactory
 outcome would be for us to
 stand fast, with the expecta-
 tion  that  the West  Paks
 could hold their own.
 26. Ambassador  Johnson.
 said that we must examine
 the possible effects that ad-
 ditional supplies for Pakistan
 might have. It could be that
 eight F-104's might not make
 any difference once the real
 war in the West starts. They
 could be considered only as a
 token. If, in fact, we were to
 move in West Pakistan we
 would be in a new ball game.
 27. Ambassador  Johnson
 said  that  one possibility
 would be our reply to For-
 eign. Minister Singh,. In which
 we could acknowledge the In-
 dian pledge that they do not
 haveterritorial designs. He
 also stated we must also con-
 sider the fact that the Paks
 may themselves be trying to
 take Kashmir.

 ous possible commitments to

 both Pakistan and India, Mr.
 Packard stated that the over-
 riding consideration is the
 practical problem of either
 doing something effective or
 doing nothing. If you don't
 win, don't get involved. If we
 were to attempt something it
 would have to be with a cer-
 tainty that it would affect
 the outcome. Let's not get in
 if we know we are going to
 lose. Find some way to stay
 out.
 29. Mr. Williams suggested
 that we might now focus ef-
 forts for a cease-fire in West
 Pakistan. Ambassador John-
 son stated this might, how-
 ever; stop the Paks from
 moving into Kashmir.
 30. Dr. Kissinger asked for
 an assessment of the Pak ca-
 pabilities and prospects in
 Kashmir. He asked C.I.A. to
 prepare an assessment of the
 international implications of
 Mrs. Gandhi's current moves.
 He indicated that we should
 develop an initial stand on
 the military supply question.
 He reiterated that he desired
 to keep Hussein in a "holding
 pattern relative to the. Tat-
 ter's expression of support
 for Pakistan and that he
 should not be turned off. The
 U.S.G. sliould indicate to Hus-
 sein that we do not consider
 trivial his feelings in this
 matter.
 31. Turning to the question
 of the blockade, Ambassador
 Johnson said that both India
 and  Pakistan  have  taken
 blockade action, even though
 the Pak blockade is essen-
 tially a paper blockade. Dr.
 Kissinger said that we should
 also protest to the Paks. Am-
 bassador Johnson indicated
 we do not have a legal case
 to protest the blockade. The
 belligerent nations have a
 right to blockade when a
 state of war exists. We may
 think it unwise and we may
 question how it is carried
 out. We have, in fact, nor-
 mally expressed our concern.
 On the other hand we have
 no problem in protesting the
 incident of the S.S. Buckeye
 State.
 32. Dr. Kissinger said that
 we are not trying to be even
 handed. There can be no
 doubt what the President
 wants. The President does
 not want to be even handed.
 The President believes that
 India is the attacker. We are
 trying to get across the idea
 that India has jeopardized re-
 lations  with  the  United
 States. `Dr.  Kissinger said
 that we cannot afford to
 ease India's state of mind.
 "The Lady" is cold blooded
 and tough and will not turn
 into a Soviet satellite merely
 because of pique: We should
 not ease her mind. He in-
 vited anyone who objected
 to this approach to take his
 case to the President. Am-
 bassador Keating,  he sug-
 gested is offering enough re-
 assurance on his own.
 33. Addressing briefly the
 question of communal strife
 'in East Pakistan, _Dr. Kissin-
 ger asked whether anyone
 would` be in a position to
 know that massacres were
 occurring at the time when
 they kook place. Mr. Helms
 indicated that we. might not
 know immediately, but we
 certainly would know after
 a massacre occurred.
 34. The meeting was ad-
 journed at 12:10.

 Classified documents in our

 that ceptio  ins still of-
 _finioi nnlirv in Vietnam
 The raw facts about the
 Vietnam war go through a fil-
 tering and flavoring process,
 which can be ascribed partly
 to a natural desire to make
 American troops look as he-
 roic tis_possible, partly to the
 Pentagon's determination to
 portray the war as the top
 brass want the world to see it.
 A classified memo to all top
 U.S. officials in the Pacifica.
 tion program,  for example,
 bluntly tells them to be mis-
 leading at command briefings.
 These are special briefings for
 vitisinq newsmen and dignitar-
 ies. The memo, therefore, is
 an order to flavor the well of
 truth at its source.
 Small  wonder that Brig.
 Gen. James Herbert, a top
 U.S. deputy in the pacification
 program, ordered that "Over-
 all security classification will
 be SECRET."
 Dated  Sept.  8,  1971,  the
 memo mentions the disaster-
 ridden programs for helping
 war victims and for persuad.
 ing the Vietcong and North Vi-
 etnamese to defect. U.S. offi-
 cials in charge of these pro-
 grams are directed only to
 "submit material which re-
 flects progress" for the brief-

 Our Vietnamese allies are
 even more blatant in faking
 success where none exists. A
 classified U.S. translation of
 an order by the late Lt. Gen.
 Do Cao Tri explains all those
 slogans that visitors to Viet-
 nam are shown, as evidence of
 pro-Saigon sentiment, in ham-
 lets and along the roads.
 Soldiers and civilians In his
 military region were ordered
 by Gen, Tri to "display na-

 Tri added menacingly that
 his army units sould discipline
 people who do not put out the
 flags.
 This attitude of fakery and
 falsehood extends down to
 every  level.  For  example,
 Americans have been repeat-
 edly told about the increasing
 number of hamlets which are
 secure from Communist con-
 trol.
 A high U.S. Pacification offi-

 Cables Show Doubletalk on VC
 By Jack Anderson
 The secret cables from Sai-
 gon show that U.S. officials
 have been talking out of both
 sides of their mouths about
 their campaign to wipe out the
 Vietcong Infrastructure.
 The idea was to kill, capture
 or convert the key people who
 operate the Vietcong under-
 ground inside South Vietnam.
 This grim missionary effort is
 known delicately as Operation
 Phoenix, named after a mythi-
 cal bird which rises from its
 own ashes.
 But the Phoenix program,
 according  to  the  classified
 cable traffic, hasn't gotten off
 the ground. Ellsworth Bunker,
 the American Ambassador in
 Saigon, has reported to Secre-
 tary of State Bill Rogers that
 the operation "has not ap-
 peared to have significantly
 weakened" the Vietcong in-
 frastructure.
 It "has reduced the power of
 the VCI (Vietcong Infrastruc-
 ture), he said, and "is an es-
 sential part of the Govern-
 ment of Vietnam's defense."
 American  support,  he  de
 clared, "is fully warranted."
 The VCI, he said, "operates
 under   considerable limits
 tions" and has been reduce
 in some areas "to skeleton sta
 tus." As statistical evidence,
 he reported that 9,331 VCI
 were "neutralized during the
 first five months of 1971. This
 included   3,650  killed,  he
 said.
 Secret Reports
 300 people. This has 'appar- the  Vietnamese but which
 ently been adequate to keep
 the VCI viable and enable
 them to make their presence
 felt."
 A few weeks before Colby
 bragged to Congress about the
 success of the Phoenix pro-
 gram, his top aide in Gia Dinh
 province, David McKillop, re-
 ported grimly: "We have not
 scratched the surface of the
 Urban VCI network of thei
 Shadow Supply System."
 In  a  confidential  report
 from Binh Duong province, Lt.
 Col. Gerald Chikalla informed
 Colby that operation Phoenix
 -vas killing off the little fish
 but missing the sharks.
 "There has developed the
 tendency to place more im-
 portance  on  volume  rather
 than on quality neutraliza-
 tions,"   reported Chikalla.
 "Much of this can be attrib.
 uted to U.S. guidance and in-
 fluence and Quotas."

 tion in action at any level that
 it gets on paper."
 Similar admissions of fail-
 ure came from Lt. Col. Gerald
 Bartlett in Hau Nghia prov-
 ince.
 Yet Colby suppressed these
 unfavorable reports and gave
 Congress a fabricated, favora-
 ble account of the Phoenix
 r rogram. He was supported by
 the Pentagon's G. Warren Nut.
 ter, who wrote a similarly
 glowing letter about Opera
 tion Phoenix to House Foreign
 Affairs  Chairman  Thomas
 Morgan (D-Pa.) on Aug. 21.
 Once again, we have caught
 government officials in a fla-
 grant deception. They twisted
 the facts, apparently, in order
 to win congressional support.
 Gift from Agnew
 Bunker's  secret  Aug.  30
 cable, however, tells a dismay-
 ingly different story. Although
 the  Phoenix  program "rou-
 tinely exceeds its goals of neu-
 tralizations (deaths and ar-
 rests),"  confided Bunker, it
 "has not appeared to have sig-
 nificantly weakened the VCI."
 Giving the classified statis-
 tics on VCI strength, he re-
 ported:  "June  strength (of)
 61,994  was  down  341 from
 May. The drop in strength for
 the first half of 1971 is about
 10 per cent. Even if this figure
 is reliable, it is not a signifi-
 cant decrease in view of the
 urgent GVN (Government of
 Vietnam)   efforts   directed
 ,against the VCI in 1971.
 Bunker's cable is dated Aug.
 30, 1971. The date is signifi-
 cant. For a few days earlier,
 Ambassador  William  Colby
 and Assistant Defense Secre-
 tary G. Warren Nutter made
 public statements saying ex-
 actly the opposite.

 May  has  adopted  three
 teen-aged black youths and

 U.S. Deception on Role in Cambodia
 By Jack Anderson
 A secret exchange between
 Washington and Phnom Penh
 reveals that officials  aren't
 telling  the truth about the
 U.S. role in Cambodia.
 Because  of    congressional
 hostility, the Nixon adminis-
 tration has pretended to take
 no active part in raising funds
 from other nations to support
 the tottering regime of Cam-
 bodian strongman Lon Nol.
 The secret cables show, how-
 ever, that the U.S. not only is
 bringing political pressure on
 other  governments  to  con-
 tribute to Lon Nol but has ac-
 tually prepared a solicitation
 letter for Lon Nol's signature.
 Apparently, U.S. policymak-
 ers don't trust the Cambodian
 leader to write his own letters
 on such a delicate matter. The
 appeal was supposed to be ad-
 dressed "on a personal basis"
 to other heads of state who
 might have a. little cash to
 spare for Cambodian aid.
 Congressmen have balked at
 financing Lon Nol because of
 I the dismaying similarity be-
 tween his regime and some of
 the corrupt, floundering South
 Vietnamese regimes that have
 cost the American taxpayers a
 fortune.
 In an earlier column, we
 quoted from secret dispatches
 that described Lon Nol as "a
 sick man, both physically and
 mentally" and told of wide-
 spread incompetence and cor-
 ruption throughout his govern-
 ment.
 Compulsive Womanizer
 Even some of the able men
 under him were characterized
 respectively, as "an inveterate
 gambler,"   "a   compulsive
 womanizer" and as a leader
 whose "personal authority is
 diluted by a tendency toward
 financial corruption."
 American Ambassador
 Emory Swank, in one secret
 report, criticized "Lon Nol's
 haphazard, out-of-channel and
 ill-coordinated conduct of mili-
 tary operations." The result is
 that  Communist  hit-and-run
 harassing operations have de-
 veloped-apparently much to
 the Viet Cong's surprise -
 into a serious military treat to
 the Cambodian capital.
 Similar reports about some
 of South Vietnam's earlier po-
 litical corruption and military
 bungling  were  kept  secret
 from the American people. If
 the truth had been known in
 time, the U.S. might have been
 spared some of the lives and
 resources that have gone down
 the drain in Vietnam.
 Because of the Vietnam ex-
 perience, Congress is keeping
 a tight pursestring on Cambo-
 dian aid. The Nixon adminis-
 tration has gone behind con-
 gressional backs, however, to
 sneak  military  supplies into
 Cambodia through South Viet-
 nam and Indonesia.
 Now the administration has
 resorted to deception again to
 raise exchange support funds
 for Cambodia.
 Cambodia "has undertaken
 to do its own representations
 to elicit donors for the ESF," a
 State Department spokesman
 told us blandly.
 Secret Instructions
 But secret instructions were
 cabled to the American Em-
 bassy in Phnom Penh, declar-
 ing: "We believe political ap-
 proach necessary lest finance
 ministries, who are generally
 opposed new aid programs, ar-
 range for an evasive or nega-
 tive reaction to (the Cambo-
 dian) appeal.
 "Department believes high-
 level political appeal needed
 to improve chances for suc-
 cess. Letter from Lon Nol to
 heads  of  prospective donor
 governments could help nail
 down (contributions)."
 The suggested letter begins:
 "Excellency: I am writing this
 note on a p rsonal basis in
 order to bring to your Excel-
 lency's attention directly the l
 economic problem that we are
 now confronted with in the
 Khmer -Eepublic ..."
 It winds up- "I am asking
 that your government make a 1
 contribution of - to the
 fund for 1972 at a meeting to
 be held in Phnom Penh (on
 January 14.)"
 All Lon Nol had to do was
 fill in the blank space with the
 correct amount for each coun-
 try. The sums that will be
 sought are: U.S., $12.5 million;
 Japan, $7.5 million; Australia,
 $3 million; Britain, $500,000;
 New Zealand $300,000; Indo-
 nesia,   $250,000;   Malaysia,
 $250,000; Singapore, $250,000;
 Thailand,  $250,000;  and the
 Philippines, $250,000.
 Despite the State Depart.
 ment's public    pretense  that"
 Lon Nol is running his own
 fund-raising drive, here's what
 the secret in structions add:
 "Once letters sent, we pre-
 pared urge our embassies in
 key countries make high-level
 approaches in support of Lon
 Nol request. We understand
 that Japanese will then move
 out and actively lobby for par-
 ticipation in ESF. We can, on
 selective basis, do some lobby-
 ing here, especially with UK
 and Australia."
 These  secret  instructions,
 like the India-Pakistan revela-.
 tions, demonstrate, sadly, that
 the government of, by and for
 the people cannot always be
 trusted to tell the people the
 truth.

 Bay of Bengal and Tonkin Gulf
 By Jack Anderson
 The   secret White House
 Papers reve              ous
 similarities be w  n the Bay
 of Bengal and the Gulf of
 Tonki .
 The Gulf of Tonkin incident
 on Aug. 4, 1964, led to our
 .deep involvement In the Viet-
 nam war. The'American pub-
 lic was told that North Viet-
 namese  torpedo boats had
 staged an unprovoked attack
 upon a U.S. destroyer, al-
 l though. later evidence indi-
 cated that the attack was ac-
 tually provoked.
 The risk of a similar 'naval
 incident in the Bay of Bengal
 caused grave apprehensions
 inside the State Department
 as a U.S. task force steamed
 toward a Soviet task force at
 ,'the, height of the Indian-Pak'
 staiifighting.
 On Dec. 7, a top secret warn-
 i g was flashed to Washington
 that "three Soviet naval ships,
 a seagoing minesweeper and a
 begun to move
 tanker have
 northeastward Into the Bay of
 Bengal. The units entered the
 Indian Ocean from the Ma-
 lacca Strait on 3 December and
 were  located approximately
 500 nautical miles east of Cey-
 lon on 7 December."
 Urgent huddles in the White
 House led to a decision on
 Dec. 10 to assemble in ' Ma-
 Iacca Strait a U.S. task force,
 'spearheaded by the aircraft
 carrier Enterprise, the Navy's
 most powerful ship. The pri-
 mary purpose was to make a
 "show of force" and to divert
 Indian planes and ships from
 Pakistan.
 As the task force moved
 Into position, Admiral John
 McCain,  our  Pacific  com-
 mander, inquired on Dec. 11
 about "the feasibility of ...
 aerial surveillance of Soviet
 .task  group located approxi-
 mately  180                                               NM  (nautical
 miles) southwest of Ceylon."
 Air Surveillance
 Authorization was flashed
 back the same day "in the
 event Task Force 74 is directed
 to transmit the Strait of Malac-
 ca. At that time, appropriate
 screening-surveilance
 flights are authorized."
 As the American warships
 moved through the strait and
 headed into the Bay of Bengal,
 even  more ominous reports
 reached Washington from the
 Defense Intelligence Agency.
 "Recent  indicators  have
 been received which suggest
 the PRC (Peoples Republic of
 China) may be planning ac-
 tions regarding the Indo-Paki-
 stan  conflict," a top secret
 message reported tersely. "Ac-
 cording to a reliable clandes-
 tine source, (Pakistan's) Presi-
 dent Yahya Khan claimed ...
 today that the Chinese Ambas.
 sador in  Islamabad had  as-
 sured him that within 72 hours
 the Chinese Army will move
 towards the border.
 "President  Yahya's    claim
 cannot be confirmed. How-
 ever, recent Peking propa-
 ganda  statements have be=.
 come more critical of India's`
 involvement in East Pakistan."
 From Katmandu  In  the India Nikolai M. Pegov, how- good will toward men.

 word that both the Soviet and
 Indian military attaches had
 asked Col. Melvin Holst, the
 American attache, what he
 knew   about Chinese troop
 movements  and  U.S.   fleet
 movements.
 "U.S.S.R. Attache Loginov,"
 said   the secret  dispatch,
 "called upon PRC military at-
 tache Chao Kuang Chih in
 Katmandu advising Chao that

 If   presidential adviser
 Henry Kissinger had not lied
 to the press in his December
 background briefing on the
 Asia war, there would have
 been no story for us to write.
 The documents would simply
 have confirmed what the pub-
 lic had already been told.
 Instead, the White House
 chose to mislead the public
 flagrantly. Kissinger said the
 administration was not anti-
 India,  a  misrepresentation
 that must have been obvious
 to both India. Pakistan and
 the allies of both.
 The secret papers prove
 that the administration was
 militantly anti-India. It was
 this contradiction, not the fact
 that the papers were classi-
 fied, that made them news.
 Indeed, it is doubtful that
 the  various  sources  who
 made  the papers available
 would have done so if the ad-
 ministration had not engaged
 in such bald-faced deception.
 Now, unfortunately, the ad-
 ministration seems bent on
 widening its credibility gap.
 It is thundering off in search
 of  our  sources instead of
 making   good  the    solemn
 promise it made during the
 court battle over the Penta-
 gon Papers.
 At that time, the govern.
 ment  admitted  there    was
 "massive over-classification"
 of  official  documents.  It
 promised to reform the clas-
 sification  system, which it
 had undermined by chronic
 overuse of  the     "secret"
 stamp.
 Supreme   Court   Justice
 Potter, Stewart summarized
 the state of affairs in one
 sentence: "When everything
 is  classified,"  he  wrote,
 "nothing Is classified"
 Today,  documents  which
 might genuinely need to be
 kept temporarily from public
 view are lost in a classified
 shuffle of miscellaneous ca-
 bles, correspondence, intelli-
 gence summaries and other
 bric-a-brac.
 Government  officials  al-
 most daily demonstrate their
 contempt for the security la-
 bels by slipping newsmen se-
 lected secret papers which
 make them look good.
 If these labels had any real
 meaning, the government it-
 self would be the nation's
 number one security risk.
 But while high officials
 have debased and cheapened
 the "secret" stamps, they still
 find them useful for one pur-
 pose: to keep their actions
 and particularly, their blun-
 ders  hidcn  from  public
 view.
 But this passion for secrecy
 is far more serious than mere
 bureaucratic     b u n g l i n g
 'Secrecy,  as   the Supreme
 Court has observed, is not
 merely undemocratic, it is
 anti-democratic.
 The proper function of our
 political system depends on
 the ability of the public to be
 informed. This is the crucial
 mission of the First Amend-
 ment - to promote a maxi-
 mum flow of news and com-
 mentary to every citizen.
 There is no way this funda-
 mental concept, d                   squared
 can
 democracy, ,
 with a system of "security"
 classification  which Is, in
 reality, a legalized form of
 censorship.
 The White House papers
 on India and Pakistan con-
 tain not a shred of informa-
 tion that threatens the na
 tion's security. Instead, they
 reveal the inside policy ma-
 neuverings and public decep-
 tions of our top officials.
 They tell the story of for-
 eign policy moves that may
 have   pushed   India-the
 world's second largest nation
 and its largest democracy-
 into the arms of the Soviet
 Union. Meanwhile, we find
 ourselves locked in an em-
 brace with a feeble, beaten
 military dictatorship,.

 Owlish, offish Henry Kissin-
 ger, the foreign policy wizard,
 is* simply over his head in pa-
 perwork.
 He is trying to serve Presi-
 dent Nixon as a one-man State
 Department. But the paper-
 work is too voluminous, the
 problems  too  overwhelming
 even for the brilliant Kissin-
 ger to master.
 Still he tries to manage
 every foreign crisis, to absorb
 every new detail, to advise the
 President on every develop-
 ment. During the three hectic
 weeks before Christmas, the
 secret  White  l:Iouse Papers
 show Kissinger had his fingers
 in the following pies:
 Ambassador  George  Bush
 probed and pressed in the
 backrooms of the United Na.
 tions for a diplomatic solution
 while  Egypt and Syria de-
 ployed their forces for a mili-
 tary showdown. To keep a mil-
 itary balance, Kissinger urged
 the shipment of Phantom jets
 to Israel.
 continued to prepare for the
 presidential pilgrimages to Pe-
 king and Moscow. He not only
 handled the arrangements but
 plotted  the big-power chess
 that the President will play
 with our two chief adver-
 saries.
 ? More than anyone else,
 Kissinger served as ring mas-
 ter for the three-ring Paris
 peace talks, Vienna SALT and
 Brussels  NATO  conference
 that were going on simultane-
 ously behind closed doors. He
 called the signals from the
 White House.
 He also kept close watch
 through horn-rimmed glasses
 upon such far-flung trouble
 spots  as  Cuba,  Chile and
 Korea. He monitored the dip-
 lomatic  cables,                                                                                intelligence

 Calling Kissinger
 ? He  became  deeply  in-
 volved in preparing the new
 international monetary agree-
 ment. President Nixon's uni-
 lateral economic moves last
 August caused a diplomatic
 backfire around the world. He
 did not consult with America's
 trading partners. He offered
 no explanation to the Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund. He ig-
 nored the diplomatic niceties.
 In all this, he was advised
 chiefly by Treasury Secretary
 John Connally. Kissinger was
 called in, finally to unravel
 the international disorder.
 ? He directed the top-level
 strategy sessions on the Indi-
 an-Pakistani conflict. He sub-
 mitted the option papers, for
 example, that persuaded Presi-
 dent Nixon to dispatch a naval
 task force into the Bay of Ben-
 gal

 The State Department, with

 Sato Steering Away From the
 By Jack Anderson
 Japan's staunchly pro-Amer-
 lean Prime Minister Eisaku
 Sato, severely shaken by a se-
 ries of diplomatic shocks from
 the White House, is steering a
 new course away from the
 U.S. and closer to Communist
 China.
 Secret White House docu-
 ments caution that, ultimately,
 Japan may slip out from be-
 hind the American nuclear
 shield and become a nuclear
 power In her own right.
 In the meantime, Sato wants
 to make his own deal with the
 Chinese,  not  let President
 Nixon trade off Japanese de-
 fenselessness for Chinese con-
 cessions  at  the  bargaining
 table in Peking next month.
 The Japanese  fear Mr.
 Nixon may offer to keep
 Japan unarmed. He may try to
 persuade Chou En-lai that the
 Japanese-American security
 treaty deters. Japan from
 "going it alone" and rebuild-
 ing her military might.
 "It would be a mistake,
 "the Japanese have warned,
 "for the President to make
 such an argument. His doing
 so would inevitably become
 known in Japan, thus deepen-

 Undermining Kissinger
 HIGH  POLICY differ-
 ences are widely supposed
 to have prompted the leak
 of secret documents on the
 Indo-Pakistani crisis to Jack
 Anderson. But most of the
 evidence suggests that the
 true cause is a vulgar bu-
 reaucratic row aimed at get-
 ing the President's chief as-
 istant for national security
 ffairs, Henry Kissinger.
 The  most  striking  evi-
 dence is like the evidence of
 the dog that didn't bark in
 the Sherlock Holmes story.
 The fact is that no enduring
 policy issue of high impor-
 tance  is  involved  in  the
 leaks.
 The fight over East Ben-
 gal is largely a one-shot af-
 fair. Hardly anything that
 happens on the subcontinent
 is central to international
 politics. The United States
 had already tipped toward
 Pakistan - and practically
 everybody  knew  it when
 the leaks were sprung. At
 the time, as some of Dr. Kis-
 singer's  comments  make
 plain,  the administration
 was anticipating a return to
 more normal relations with
 back to 90, and the deadly
 you-or-me rivalry between
 rid  prfnidpat` agencies of
 tie foielgn affairs commu-

 :there is the state of rela-
 tions a o    a for officials
 fected policy. The chief con-
 aeque1 a wtx9 to Impugn the
 tegrity of fir. Kissinger.
 A SECOND BIT of evi-
 dence involves Mr. Ander-
 son  himself.  He  is  not
 deeply versed in foreign af-
 fairs. No one who aimed to
 change a line of interna-
 tional policy would single
 out Mr. Anderson as the
 agent for deflecting that re-
 sult through the leak of se-
 cret information.
 Mr. Anderson's specialty-
 and it is an important spec-
 ialty-is  putting the  jour-
 nalistic arm on wrong-doers.
 By no mere accident the
 chief fruit of his disclosures
 was not something that af-
 his, He has a sharp tongue,
 and he has been unnecessar-
 ily  unkind  in  comments
 about some of the senior of-
 ficials  of     the  most pres-
 tigous departments.
 But most of the resentment
 has been'caused by what Dr.
 Kissinger does in the serv-
 ice of the President. The
 present administration has
 expanded the job of special
 assistant for national secu-
 rity affairs way beyond what
 it was under Walt Rostow
 and McGeorge Bundy. Dr.
 Kissinger has virtually elim-
 inated from  the decision-
 making business some of the
 most high-powered men and
 agencies in town
 The office of Secretary of
 Defense Is perhaps the chief
 victim. Secretary of Defense
 Melvin Laird is going to be
 stepping down soon with
 practically  nothing to his
 credit.   Even   his  claim
 (which has at least some
 foundation) to be the author
 of the policy for getting out
 of Vietnam is not widely be-
 lieved.
 He seems hostile to the
 administration's policy  on
 an arms control agreement,
 and he was completely cut
 out of plans for the Presi-
 dent's visit to China. His
 general reputation for trick-
 iness has caused the cognos-
 centi, rightly or wrongly, to
 establish him as the short-
 odds favorite for almost all
 leaks regarding national se-
 curity these days. Indeed,
 some White House officials
 at first believed Mr. Laird
 leaked the Pentagon papers.
 THE UNIFORMED MILI-
 TARY comes a close second
 in the odds. Many of them
 do not like the way the White
 House is winding down the
 war in Vietnam. Almost all
 are opposed to the arms con-
 trol agreement which the
 White House is now negoti-
 ating  with the  Russians.
 Some are hostile to the Oki-
 nawa reversion agreement
 which the White House has
 negotiated with Japan. And
 far, far more than civilians
 in the government, the uni-
 formed military are in the
 habit of leaking classified
 information to serve their
 own interests.

 With suspicions at that
 level, there is every reason
 to figure bureaucractic ri-

 the background of the An-
 derson papers. There is no
 case for lionizing, or even
 protecting the sources of the
 of the leaks.
 On the contrary, for once
 there is a ease for a presi-
 dential crackdown. Mr. Nix-

 the country-is to find the
 source of the leaks and fire
 them fast.

 JAMES J. KILPATRICK
 Leak of Papers to Anderson a Grave Breach
 i
 We are in the midst of an-
 other of those great ruffled
 flaps involving the press, the
 government, and the ethics of
 public and private conduct.
 This one is serious.
 The story goes back to the
 first week in December, when
 the Washington Special Action
 Group met at the White House
 to discuss the suddenly flam-
 ing war launched by India
 against East Pakistan. The
 WSAG, in effect, is the super-
 National Security Council of
 this administration - a top-
 level coordinating body intend
 ed to serve the President with
 the : best advice and intelli-
 gence that can be pulled to-
 gether by skilled and experi-
 enced men.
 The three WSAG meetings of
 Dec. 3, 4 and 6 were held in
 confidence, of course, behind
 locked doors, but written min-
 utes were prepared. These
 minutes were stamped "se-
 cret-sensitive," which is the
 classification level just be-
 low "top secret," and then
 were distributed among an es-
 timated 50 to 75 persons in the
 Pentagon, State Department,
 CIA, and the White House.
 A. person or persons un-
 known made copies of the
 memoranda and gave them to
 columnist Jack Anderson. He
 excerpted them for use in his
 column, and a few days later
 'supplied the texts for use by
 newspapers generally. In one
 view-it is the view of anti-
 Nixon liberals-Anderson per-
 formed a great public service,
 and his anonymous informant
 wa- a man of noble character
 who risked his job in the name
 of truth and honesty in govern-
 ment.
 There is another view. The
 importance of this disquieting
 affair does not lie in the mem-
 oranda themselves. The im-
 portance lies in the leak.
 Make no mistake: This leak
 must be found, and it must be
 stopped. This is a breach of
 trust, and a breach of securi-
 ty, of the most profound im-
 plications.
 The memoranda are embar-
 rassing, no more. For the
 most part, the minutes reflect
 the discussion of men trying to
 find out what is going on, and
 seeking to decide what best to
 do about it. The President,
 they are advised, is angry at
 India for its aggressive ac-
 tion; he wants "a tilt toward
 Pakistan."  There is much
 talk of the futility of the
 United Nations. One detects
 sympathy for the plight of the
 emerging nation of Bangla-
 desh; it promises to become
 "an  international  b a s k e t
 case." The conferees come to
 no particular decisions. They
 agree to prepare certain pa-
 pers for the President. Their
 discussion is candid, sponta-
 neous, unreserved.
 Subsequent to these private
 meetings, the White House
 was publicly to assert its neu-
 trality in the India-Pakistan
 war.  Obviously  the  White
 House was not neutral. This
 was self-evident to every edi-
 tor and critic in the country.
 It is a fair surmise that
 every government in history
 has taken public positions in-
 consistent with its private
 wishes. Diplomats know this.
 What matters, to repeat, is
 the leak itself. This is not to
 on,
 be compared with the act
 of the Washington Post last,
 month in blowing Henry Kis-:
 singer's cover as the source of
 a recent backgrounder; that.
 was no more than an ill-man
 nered breach of professional,
 rules. Neither is it to be com-
 pared with Daniel Ellsberg's
 clandestine distribution last
 spring of the aging "Penta-,
 gon Papers." Ellsberg was,
 then out of the government.
 We must infer, in this in_ .
 stance, that someone still em-
 ployed at the very highest lev-
 els of confidence-some one
 holding top secret clearance,
 with access to other memoran-,
 da of immense importance
 has  wantonly  violated the,
 trust reposed in him. This
 goes beyond disloyalty; it sails
 close to the windward edge.
 of treason. What other docu-.
 ments one must wonder, has
 this person secretly copied?
 Where will he peddle them
 next? This is the alarming as-
 pect. Anderson thinks it "fun-
 ny," but then Anderson would.
 It is not funny at all.

 `Leaks Follow the Course of Greatest Impact
 WASHINGTON-The  choicest bits
 .of the White House's secret strategy
 sessions On the Pakistan-India fuss had
 already been published in Jack An-
 derson's syndicated column-read by
 an, estimated 45 million muck-hungry
 Americans - when Presidential aide
 Henry Kissinger; decided that the best
 way tp fight ? back was to say that
 his statements had suffered distortion
 by being printed out of -context.
 That was a. mistake. Last week Mr.
 Anderson responded to Mr. Kissinger's
 criticism by releasing to the press the'
 full text of the White House minutes,
 and these were printed by The New
 York Times, The Washington Post
 and other. major newspapers across
 the country.
 It was no -great act of largesse. Mr.
 Anderson could spare a few secret
 documents; he says he gets dozens of
 them every week "from officials, of
 integrity who believe Uncle Sam can
 tell the truth and survive." A smaller
 selection, he says, comes "from peo-
 ple who are out to get even with
 their boss or somebody, else." The of-
 ficials who slipped him these White
 House papers might qualify in both
 categories. Mr. Kissinger, having' up-
 staged the entire State Department
 and some of the Defense Department,
 is not without bureaucratic enemies.
 Those who recall Mr. Anderson's
 being caught in 1954 eavesdropping
 on Bernard. Gbldfine in the Sheraton-
 Carlton Hotel, or sending an assistant
 to dig through J. Edgar Hoover's gar-
 bage can last year, would have been
 easily -persuaded that Mr. Anderson
 got the documents by some light-fin-

 gered technique. But Mr. Anderson
 says they came the usual way-"from
 friends in sensitive government posi-
 tions." The friends were "appalled by
 the Administration's siding with the
 akistani dictatorship" and by the
 'misleading information coming out of
 the White House."
 Sensing an opening, Mr. Anderson
 softened them up further by implant-
 ing the fear-which he shared - that
 the presence of the United States
 fleet in the Bay of Bengal might be
 pointing to another Gulf of Tonkin
 incident.
 If the Johnson Administration's se-
 cret plans in 1$64 for covert war
 against North Vietnam--and for sub-
 sequent bombing of. the North-had
 been known in advance of the Tonkin
 episode, the escalation 'of the war
 might have been prevented. Right?
 And ' if the public knew what the
 White House was thinking about India
 and Pakistan, it might even mean pre-
 venting a conflict with Russia. Right?
 "Quite .frankly," says Mr. Anderson,
 ,,this was persuasive with my friends.
 Originally they gave me about a
 dozen documents. They said these
 were the key ones. But I didn't feel
 I. should write without seeing all the
 documents of this period. I told my
 sources, 'I trust you guys, and when
 you say this is a representative sam-
 pling I'm sure you're telling the truth.
 But somebody might argue that you
 had misled me by picking out just
 the 'documents that prove what you
 want to prove. I think I've got to
 see them all.'              }
 "They said, 'You're crazy' I said,
 'No. You've got to decide whether
 you work for the country or for Kis-
 singer.' So they gave me all of them."
 In dealing with people so disposed,
 Mr. Anderson benefits from the first
 law of leak physics: Leaks tend to
 follow the course of greatest impact.
 Officials with a secret tale to tattle
 know that through Mr. Anderson's
 column . they will reach 700 newspa-
 pers, which is' by far the most wide-
 spread  circulation of any  political
 column in American journalism.
 Not that all 700 newspapers always
 use it. Some editors don't appreciate
 what Mr. Anderson does to some of
 their heroes. Others are occasionally
 afraid he may be leading them down
 the libel path. His column aboutthe
 sex problems encountered by cartoon-
 ist Al Capp on college campuses, for
 instance, was carried in only two
 newspapers on the East Coast.
 When Mr. Anderson inherited the
 Merry-Go-Round column from Drew
 Carson in ' 1969 there were some
 oubts about his ability to handle it.
 rue, he had helped produce the col-
 mn since 194. and Mr. Pearson had
 ontributed little during his last years
 the series that ruined the career of
 he late Senator Thomas Dodd, , for
 example, was almost. entirely Mr. An-
 derson's  handiwork).  Nevertheless,
 during most of his career Mr. Ander-
 son-an  unglamorous   teetotalling
 Mormon family man (nine children)
 -was overshadowed by his suave
 boss and partner; who handled the
 big-name -contacts  in . Georgetown
 salons.
 Mr. Anderson, now 49, is not a
 party goer. He, takes his religion very
 seriously and teaches Sunday school.
 Big physically (about six feet, 200
 pounds),  a onetime halfback and
 brash, Mr. Anderson likes to cultivate
 the reputation of a Peck's Bad Boy,
 an' outsider. He has a Middle Ameri-
 can background: an upbringing in
 Utah, no college degree, experience
 on Utah newspapers and the Stars
 and Stripes before reaching Washing-.'
 ton. He has never received an impor-
 tant journalism prize. He likes to take
 jibes at the "Establishment press,"
 though his column, in the sense that
 it is a key conduit to some portions
 'of the Establishment, is also very
 much a part of it.
 If, after all this, there were any
 lingering doubts about Mr. Anderson
 as proprietor of the Merry-Go-Round
 column, they must surely have been
 dispelled by the White House papers
 coup. Now, with a staff of four leg-
 men (Les Whitten, Brit Hume, Joe
 Spear, Ray Cole) operating out of five
 rooms in Howard Hughes's old office
 suite on K Street, Mr. Anderson is bit-
 ing hard enough to be forgiven what
 appears to be an extra layer to his
 customary cockiness. He's even chal-
 lenking the White House to get tough
 about his latest gambit.
 . "I didn't get my information out
 of a Daniel Ellsberg, who belonged
 to another Administration and has
 been out of government two years,"
 he says. "I got my information .f roil
 some of Nixon's own boys."
