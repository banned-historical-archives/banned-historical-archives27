THE FORTHCOMING SUMMIT FOUR POWER CONFERENCE  
This background material in the psychological and communica-
tions fields was assembled for the "Summit Conference" primarily 
to assist U. S. representatives in taking an aggressive stand. 
The estimates of the course of action presented are based on the 
best intelligence available. The proposed U. S. tactics were 
suggested by intelligence and by experience in connection with 
previous conferences. The discussion is arranged in three 
sections. 
A. Soviet tactical themes.or "lines" expected 
to be used before, during and after the 
conference. 
B. Suggested U. S. themes and intelligence support 
available for these themes. 
C. Suggested tactics for the exploitation of U. S. 
themes. 
A. Soviet Tactics  
According to existing intelligence, the tactical "lines" sub-
mitted below are likely to be used by the Soviets. It is not 
possible to indicate which will be used or in what order they will 
be presented. It is important, therefore, to prepare for con-
tingencies.

General  
The present moves of the Communists in Europe, including the 
summit conference, will be designed to conceal or gain their ob-
jectives in Asia, where the advance of the international Communist 
movement is having its greatest success. The neutralization of 
Germany is a strategic objective. Any concessions by the West 
will assist the Soviet's strategic planning which includes the 
neutralization and absorption of Germany and Japan into the 
Soviet orbit. Revolution in Asia is their present tactic; the 
tactic is a stepping stone to "world revolution", which means the 
introduction everywhere of Soviet Communism directed by the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. 
It is believed that long-range Soviet maneuvering at the con-
ference will be aimed at a Four Power Foreign Ministers' conference 
after "summit" to discuss Far Eastern problems. Out of the Foreign 
Ministers' meeting Lll evolve a discussion of Formosa by a Ten 
Power conference, including the United States, Communist China, 
and a group of neutal countries. Nationalist China will undoubtedly 
be excluded. Any concessions by the West on Germany, disarmament, 
East-West trade, and a possible neutral belt will be mere windfalls 
since the Soviets' present objectives are in Asia, Asia as spelled 
out by Quemoy and Matsu, Formosa, South Vietnam, Thailand, Korea 
and Japan. 
The Neutral Belt  
As early as 1951, Pravda stated that the practical value of 
neutral tendencies in Germany, India, and the Arab countries must

not be ignored. Since then, Austria, Yugoslavia, and Scandinavian 
countries and Italy have been added to the list. Also, as early 
as 1951, Pravda predicted that neutralists would join the Soviets 
in demanding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the 
ending of the Korean War, and a Five Power peace pact. Early in 
1954, during the Berlin Conference, the neutralists' "line" took 
on a new slant, that of the Soviet-sponsored All-European Collective 
Security Agreement. The 1955 version is the creation of a neutral 
belt. This neutral belt tactic, however, is directly tied to the 
peaceful coexistence campaign. The Soviets want the European nations 
gradually to limit their commitments to NATO oi maintain a Western 
European alliance outside of NATO. This desire has led to the 
Warsaw Conference and the subsequent U.S.S.R. Satellite Treaty of 
Mutual Assistance as well as the Austrian Treaty. 
Communist China and Formosa  
At the summit conference the Soviet omnibus items, i.e., 
recognition of Communist China, entry of Red China into the UN and 
the need for Five Power Foreign Ministers' talks will be introduced. 
The primary objective, however, will be a future conference on 
QUBMT, Matsu and Formosa which would include the United States, 
Communist China as major participants and a group of neutral countries 
as moderators. The end goal, of course, will be the surrender of 
Quemoy and Matsu, and the neutralization of Formosa. The German 
issue will also be a cover to induce the West to agree to further 
conferences. The initial request for the Five Power Foreign Ministers'

meeting will be watered down to a Four Power meeting, provided 
Germany and Formosa are agenda items. Indochina and Korea will 
be included as diversionary items. 
Germany  
Where Germany is concerned, reunification will be the main 
bait. Much of German opinion is fascinated by the prospect of 
Austria regaining its freedom and by the withdrawal of the Red Army. 
Communist propagandists are now tirelessly expounding the theme of 
the Swiss and Austrians whose example Germany would be wise to fol-
low. Some of the German Social Democrats in West Germany have 
swallowed the bait. Ulbricht, Secretary General of the Social Unity 
Party (SED) of East Germany, stated in Leipzig: 
"The two great power blocs should at least be separated 
by a broad belt of neutral states. The conclusion of the 
Austrian Treaty adds a further link to this belt. Only a 
reunified Germany is still missing". 
There are two glaring exploitable flaws in this Soviet "line"?
one in the realm of theory; ohe in the realm of reality. In the 
realm of theory the Soviet aims are not neutralization of any group 
of countries but a temporary tactical move, fitting present conditions, 
that would lead to the eventual absorption of these countries into 
the Soviet orbit. In the realm of reality, the Germans are being 
asked to come to terms with the Soviet-puppet regime of East Germany. 
A genuinely democratic Germany would be worth nothing to the Soviets. 
4 reunited but contaminated Germany, which could be subverted by pro-
Soviet forces, would be invaluable to the U.S.S.R., especially if

Western Europe were so weakened as to insure ultimate Communist 
domination of the Continent. 
If the Soviets cannot foresee early unification on their 
terms, they will fall back upon their old argument of postponing 
elections until after reunification. This will be the least awkward 
way of rejecting Western proposals on Germany. 
Austria  
The Austrian Treaty was aimed primarily at German public opinion. 
This is readily apparent if the significance of the Russian military 
withdrawal is examined. The U.S.S.R. signed an 11,ustrian Treaty and 
withdrew its occupation troops without substantially reducing its 
military strength in Europe, impairing the security of its satellites 
or reducing the effectiveness of European Communist-front organiza-
tions. The Soviet forces in Austria total 31,000 troops (two 
divisions) and 2,500 security troops in contrast to a force of 
Wo,000 troops (22 line divisions) and 15,000 security troops in 
East Germany. The Soviet air force has 6 jet fighter regiments in 
Austria in contrast to 20 jet fighter and 6 jet light bomber regiments 
in East Germany. The ratification of the Warsaw Agreement setting 
up a unified Eastern European military command will give the Soviets 
a pretext of keeping their troops in the satellite states. The 
Austrian Treaty abrogates the "line of communication" security 
provision by which the Soviets have stationed troops in their 
satellites. The Warsaw Agreement will be used to refuse any request 
to withdraw their troops.

If the Soviets cannot foresee early unification along their 
terms, they will fall back upon their old argument of postponing 
elections until after reunification. This will be the least awk-
ward way of rejecting Western proposals on Germany. 
The U.S. "Threatening" .ttitude  
This is one of the omnibus themes likely- to be used by the 
Soviets to postpone discussion of Germany, to avoid Western chal-
lenges, to split the allies, and to conceal embarrassment. A variety 
of sub-themes can be played: (a) U.S. "neglect" of the problem of 
prohibition and control of atomic weapons, (b) U.S, world-wide 
military bases, (c) alleged U.S, subversive 'activities in Eastern 
Europe, (d) U.S. alliance with "Hitlerite" generals, (e) aggressive 
character of NATO, SEATO and Paris agreements. The slogans currently 
being used to highlight the above are "peaceful coexistence", "the 
U.S. does not want to reduce international tensions", and "SEATO 
is nothing more than military plotting of the colonizers." 
Disarmament 
The latest Soviet disarmament proposals are nothing more than 
a clever tactic to confuse and obstruct any real settlement. All 
proposals would work to the detriment of the Western powers while 
the Soviets would be allowed to continue their aggressive activities. 
Their proposals, if agreed to and carried out to the letter, would 
bring about: the halting of freedom of information on Communist

activities; the dismantling of U.S. overseas bases; the withdrawal 
of U.S. forces from Europe and the Far East; the surrender of 
Formosa; and the elimination of restrictions on East-West trade. 
All the above would be carried out prior to any effective dis-
armament or inspection system. The methods, techniques and pit-
falls of "Inspections ". Communist Style" have been demonstrated in 
Korea and Indochina. 
Korea and Indochina 
The unification of Korea and Vietnam will be the main themes 
of the Soviet "line". Korea will be treated as of passing interests 
since the Communists are not ready to renew hostilities. War, in 
Soviet dialectics, is the final coup when the success of the revolu-
tion is assured. The present strength of South Korea and the U. S. 
and the willingness of the UN to fight if the Communists break the 
truce will preclude any aggressive acts. 
In Vietnam the main theme will be unification and elections. 
Events are now progressing along lines favorable to a Communist 
victory. Unless the situation begins to change sharply in favor of 
the South Vietnam Government, conditions will continue to deteriorate. 
They will claim the success of the Korean and Geneva Agreements and 
back a continuation of the truce inspection commissions. The continua-
tion of the truce will give them a respite in order to strengthen 
their subversive activities which they consider preparation for the 
Itrevoluti on".

D. U. S. Themes 
The themes reviewed hereafter can be used as part of United 
States strategy or in countermoves inspired by Soviet tactics. 
gom_unEl_1?zlAtagand Formosa 
The German issue will be used by the Soviets as a lead 
to a: . discussion on Far Eastern issues. This means that the 
United States must be prepared to counter any developments 
which might weaken the position of the Western allies in the 
area. At the same time they should exploit Far Eastern 
vulnerabilities of the Soviets. Since the main issue will be 
Formosa, the Sino-Soviet Alliance should be aired and reasons given 
for the United States commitment to defend Formosa against 
Comnunist attack, The United States should reaffirm its com-
mitment to defend Formosa and explain the reasons for the program 
of military assistance to the Government of the Republic of 
China. 
"Neutral Belt" 
The purpose of this Soviet theme is to weaken or destroy 
NATO, SEATO and the Paris Agreements. Its main objective is 
the neutralization of Germany and eventually Japan with the 
subsequent withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe and the Far 
East. Since the "neutral belt" is a tactic designed to achieve

strategic concepts, the best defense is an offense, ire should 
strike hard at the theme of neutralization of the satellites. 
The counter-offensive should exploit the Soviet control mechanisms 
over the satellites, including both political and economic,. The 
iron curtain and slave labor in the satellites are secondary themes 
which can be utilized. 
The U. S. should make clear that what the Soviets propose is 
put a neutral position between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.,' but a 
weakening or many countries by destroying their alliances with 
the United States, 
"Threats" 
Soviet "line" on any of the so-called "threats" will be an 
obvious propaganda maneuver designed to conceal their true objec-
tives and will also be part of their over-all "Hate American 
campaign. The countermove on this item should give evidence of 
Soviet subversion and espionage throughout the world and especially 
Soviet subversion and espionage in Germany. An explanation of the 
significance of the term "peaceful coexistence", as used by the 
Soviets, would be effective in clearing up confUsion on that sub-
ject. 
Austria and Germaia 
The Soviets will attempt to propagandize the Austrian Treaty 
and use it as a bait for similar neutralization of Germany. The

appeal will be aimed at the German people. The U.S. countermove 
to the German problem is to explain the fact that Germany differs

On close examination they are all seen to be based on the same

Soviet Communism; to achieve the withdrawal of troops from Europe; 
to secure the dismantling of U.S. overseas bases; to eliminate 
trade restrictions; to neutralize Formosa; to secure recognition 
of Communist China and to win disarmament before inspection.

TIE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAI os A 
The Republic of China on Taiwan (Formosa), aided by military and cconomic 
programs in which we are participating heavily, stands literally and 
figuratively as a rallying point for all Chinese who oppose the Communist 
oligarchy which aims to keep the Chinese people in bondage and use them 
for the further attainment of their evil objectives. The Chinese Government 
and its people on Formosa are redoubtable members of the confraternity of 
free peoples who are ready to take their stand against further Communist 
conquests. 
In view of the limitations imposed by relatively small geographic, 
manpower and economic resources, care must be taken not to overestimate 
14461 that government's material capabilities. The strongest force they can muster 
and support is none too large for the threat they face. In the no less 
important moral and psychological spheres their value to the common cause 
is enormous. The Government of the Republic of China is essentially with us. 
It is a government with which we can negotiate on a rational plane. We are 
dealing with it on a sane basis of give and take. 
We are rendering substantial help to this government without inter-
vening in its domestic affairs or otherwise infringing on its sovereignty. 
We are helping a beleaguered people to help themselves and the common cause. 
It is a program from which we can derive some satisfaction. It is our purpose 
to continue to back this government. 
We believe that it is the only Chinese Government which represents in 
any measure the authentic aspirations and the bona fide national interests of

the Chinese people,

Disillusioned though the mass of the Chinese may have been with it 
in the dark days of 194840, its record on Formosa makes it look better 
and better to the Chinese people on the mainland by contrast with the 
ruthless exploitation which they are suffering at the hands of the regime 
of Mao Tse-tunge There is reason to hope that the government at Taipei 
will continue to grow in strength, in devotion to the cardinal principles 
of democracy, and in international prestige, and that its base of free 
Chinese support will steadily be broadened so that it will be enabled to 
raise ever higher a standard around which all Chinese may rally who wish to 
save from extinction Chinese freedoms and the ancient and distinctive 
Chinese traditions. 
The overwhelming majority of the American people do see this issue in 
proper perspective. But an articulate though small minority in our own 
country, and more in some other countries, sometimes seem to fail to dis-
tinguish friend from foe. Some of our friends in various parts of the world 
confuse Couuriunist imperialism with bona fide nationalism. 
Nonrecognition  of Communist Regime  
?Since recognition doesn't signify approval, why don't we 'accept 
reality, and recognize the Chinese Communist regime which is in full con-
trol of the country?I 
To start with, let us take a look at the four generally accepted 
criteria which a new regime ordinarily must meet before its recognition as 
a legitimate government and its acceptance into the sisterhood of nations. 
These four criteria are (1) effective control over the territory of the 
country; (2) sovereign independence; (3) truly representative character--

something in the nature of a mandate from the people governed, or at least 
their consent without coercion; and CO acceptance of its inherited and 
generally recognized treaty and other international obligations and ad-
herence to a pretty well established minimum standard of decency in its 
treatment of foreign nationals and interests within its borders. 
1 Of these four criteria it would seem that the Peiping regime meets 
only the first and that is perhaps the least essential of the four. 
Repeatedly we have recognized governments in exile which could not meet 
the first criterion. But it would be a serious matter to overlook the other 
three tests. 
The Chinese Communists do not measure up under any of than. They are 
subservient to hoscow and international communism; they impose an alien 
minority rule by force and falsification on an intimidated, isolated and 
misinformed populace; and they openly flout every Chinese treaty obligation, 
every principle of the U.N. charter, and every clause in any reasonable 
formulation of human and property rights for aliens. 
Apart from the horrors wantonly inflicted on millions of Chinese since 
1949, the story of the flagrant abuse of scores of American citizens is one 
which rightfully causes us to burn with wrath. 
The shocking crimes against humanity of recent years have blunted world 
sensitivity to mass sadism so that we no longer seem to express the full 
measure of our moral indignation against these great wrongs. But we cannot 
lightly dismiss the agony of our fellow citizens arrested by Chinese Com-
munists on trumped-up charges; held incommunicado for months or years without 
access to friends or legal counsel and often without knowledge of what offense

if any is charged against them; and in many cases subjected to physical 
or mental tortures aimed at extorting false confessions that can be used 
in the vicious hate-America propaganda campaign, a campaign which unhappily 
may in time turn a new generation of Chinese against America and Americans 
by a systematic poisoning of their minds against this country beginning in 
childhood. 
On grounds of international law, the case against recognition is very 
strong. On practieal grounds, the argument is equally strong. 
Recognition has assumed a political and psychological significance which 
is new. It has become a symbol. Recognition in this case would mean in the 
eyes of millions, especially in Asia, not necessarily approval but acceptance, 
accommodation, and reconcilement. 
Nonrecognition means refusal to accept the Communist triumph as 
definitive. It means to many that the will to resist Communist expansion 
is alive; that communism is not the inevitable "wave of the future" for Asia; 
that communism is not assured of acceptance and legitimation in every country 
where it may gain a beachhead; that our Asian friends who have the courage 
to stand up against communism will not have the ground cut out from under their 
feet if communism should attempt to subvert or take over their native land. 
Some may be unable to see why the recognition issue should signify 
all this; but the fact is that it does to many Asians, including numbers who 
are "on the fence." Many an Asian has told me that American nonrecognition 
of the Communist regime in Peiping has had much to do with checking the 
impetus of the Communist advance in Asia. 
Even Chinese who are not particularly in sympathy with the Chinese 
National Government tell us that recognition of the Communist dictators in

Peiping would be the greatest single nonmilitary triumph for the Communist 
eause and the hardest psychological blow against the will to resist the 
further spread of eommunism that could be devised. 
It would be an unthinkable betrayal of the Chinese Government and its 
people on Formosa and likewise a grave disservice to the mass of Chinese 
people on the mainland suffering under Communist dictatorship. Our friend-
ship for them shall not waver, and it demands that we shall not strengthen 
the hand of their oppressor. 
The Communist side is becoming increasingly aware of the immense 
political and psychological advantages, as well as the parliamentary ad-
vantages in the United Nations, which could be obtained from general world-
wide recognition of the Peiping regine. Hence we are beginning to see a 
series of maneuvers out of Moscow and Peiping designed to force the general 
international acceptance of the Mao Tse-tung regime as the legitimate 
government of China, entitled to occupy China's seat in the United Nations. 
This endeavor must be resisted. 
We see in the arrogant, incorrigible, unyielding position taken by 
Chinese Communist mouthpieces wherever they appear at a conference how 
difficult it is to negotiate even the simplest matter with them. The current 
negotiations in Korea are an example, The patience, the flexibility, the 
open-mindedness, the reasonableness and resourcefulness of even a con-
summately skilled negotiator are largely wasted. 
There is nothing to be gained from diplomatic relations with such a 
regime, which believes in the use of diplomacy as a weapon of propaganda and 
subversion rather than as a means of constructive diplomatic intercourse.

TIE SINO-SOVIET ALLIANCE  
The belief that Chinese Communism is in same mysterious way 
different from that of the U.S.S.R. has persisted among many observers 
despite the fact that Chinese Communist leaders since 1921 have stated 
the closeness of their ties with Moscow. 
Thus, Mao Tse-tung, in the major statement of policy he made on 
July 1, 1949, entitled "On the People's Dictatorship," wrote: 
"Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front, 
headed by the Soviet Union, and we can look for genuine friendly 
aid from that front, and not from the imperialist front." 
Again, on July 16, 1954, at Peiping, the Camander-in-Chief of the 
Chinese Communist Armed Forces, Chu Teh (also a member of the Politburo) 
1%W said: 
"It can be easily seen that the victory of the Chinese 
people's democratic revolution is insenarable from the friendly 
aid of the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union does not exist, 
if there is no victory of the anti-fascist second World Jar 
under the leadership of the Soviet Union, if there is no such 
development as the unprecedented growth since 1944 of the world 
democratic peace front under the leadership of the Soviet Union, 
the rapid and quick victory of the Chinese revolution as it is 
today would have been impossible. Even if we were to succeed, 
it would be impossible to consolidate our gains. Is this not 
clear?" 
Such statements are nothing more than confirmations of a common 
bond, and dedication to common objectives of world conquest, that have 
existed between the Chinese and Soviet Communists since the early Twenties. 
Since the Soviet Union first turned its attention actively to Asia then, 
there has been constant intercourse between China and Russia. The Soviet 
Union has sent agents to China to aid in the long effort that culminated

with the capture of all the mainland in 1949. Hundreds of Chinese 
who now occupy key positions in the Peiping regime were intensively 
trained in the Soviet Union -- always toward the end that they 
would think of themselves as agents of the Communist world program 
first, and Chinese second. For example, in the Twenties, when 
Trotsky blundered in China, it was the present Chinese leadership 
that adhered to Leninist orthodoxy, When, in 1935, the Comintern 
adopted the Popular-Front line, the Chinese Communists followed it. 
When, from 1939 to 1941, Aoscow referred to the war in Europe as 
an imperialist war and adopted an isolationist position, the Chinese 
Communists slackened their efforts against Japan and intensified 
their efforts to build their internal power. When, after June 22) 
1941, Moscow renamed the imperialist war a war for freedom and 
democracy, Yenan echoed the slogan. And when, after Stalingrad, 
the Russians began to set the stage for the creation of the post-
war puppet states in Europe, the Chinese Communists resumed their 
drive for the kind of power in China that could lead to power in 
Asia. 
With this unparalleled history of strict adherence to Soviet 
leadership, the Sine-Soviet alliance has now undertaken a major 
program to build a powerful, modernized military force, backed by 
an industrialized economy as a Aleans of completing the Asian phase 
of the program of world conquest drafted in the Kremlin more than 
three decades ago. Every aspect of governmental effort in China 
is shaped to contribute to this goal. The achievements of the

Soviet Union are taken as the basic guiding pattern, with only 
such modifications as are required by peculiar Chinese conditions. 
In addition to the physical goals of the Sino,Sovi t alliance 
being made clear, Communist doctrine in both Moscow and Peiping 
give evidence regarding the methods whereby these goals will be 
achieved. In order to provide time for their program the Com, 
munists are adopting such tactics as "united front" arrangements 
and "truce" or "armistice" agreements in order to "lessen tensions" 
on their periphery. The Sino,Soviet alliance is based on the 
realization of the tremendous influence the two parties can exert 
on world affairs through close association, and if they can buy 
time through the attraction of a "coexistence" tactic their 
ideology possesses some hope of surviving in a world of "lessening 
tensions".

Communist World-Wide Control Mechanisms 
Soviet Basic Doctrine is aimed at a Socialist (Communist) world 
dominated from Moscow. The Moscow-trained Soviet colonists are a mili-
tant group sent to all countries of the world to subvert the existing 
forms of government and establish piecemeal the Soviet Socialist 
Republics of the world. 
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
contains the Section for Liaison with Foreign Communist Parties. This 
is upually referred to as the Foreign Section of the Central Committee. 
The Foreign Section is the only channel for liaison with foreign 
Communist parties. Its importance is emphasized by the fact that it was 
directed by Mikhail A. Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee. The 
Caminform is under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Section as well as the 
editorial staff of the Cominform newspaper printed in Bucharest. 
Suslovls duties are almost entirely devoted to liaison with foreign 
Communist parties. All Cominform meetings, held always in Satellite 
countries and attended by representatives of Communist parties from the 
non-orbit areas, are conducted by Suslov. 
The Foreign Section of the Central Committee directs, controls and 
supports world-wide Communist movements. It also directs and controls 
Communist-front organizations, VOKS, Anti-Fascist Soviet Youth Committee, 
the Anti-Fascist Soviet Woments Committee and others. 
Control of foreign Communist parties, espionage nets and various 
front units is within the apparat of the Central Committee of the

Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Control of the Satellites is more 
direct and open. The party leaders in the Satellites have in virtually 
all cases been trained in Moscow. For all intents and purposes they are 
Soviet citizens, completely subservient to Moscow. Army and police 
controls are also direct and in most cases overt. 
USSR Control of Foreign Communist Parties  
During the past thirty years the Soviet control mechanisms have 
gone through a series of changes of which the most significant occurred 
during and after World War II. These will, for descriptive purposes, be 
divided into the 1919-1943 (Comintern) period, the 1943-1951 and the 
1951-1954 periods. 
a. 1919-1943. - During this period the foreign section of the 
Central Committee exercised control of foreign Communist parties through 
?the Comintern. The Third (Communist) International was established in 
Moscow in March 1919 and signified Soviet control of the international 
Communist movement. As set forth in the Constitution of the Comintern, 
the Executive Committee was one of the two bodies elected by the World 
Congress of the Communist International. The other was the International 
Control Commission. The Executive Committee, the leading body of the 
Communist International between Congresses, elected from among its members 
the Praesidium, a permanent body carrying out all businesses of the Execu-
tive Committee. The Praesidium in turn elected from its membership the 
Secretariat, which functioned as the executive body for the Praesidium. 
Comintern. - The Comintern was an international organization of 
representatives from all Communist parties. It provided policy guidance

and integration for the various Communist parties and-Was.directed by 
the Soviet Politburo. The headquarters was located in Noscov-and had 
between 2,000 and. 2;500 functionaries. It was a powerful instrument into 
which men from all countries of the world and frail all the existing Com-
munist parties were integrated. It was directed by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of the USSR and served the Soviet State. But, in 
turn; it controlled millions of adherents who received the doctrine of the 
"leading socialist country"; the USSR. 
The Cominternts Executive Committee was composed of representatives 
from all Communist parties of the world, while the Secretariat had rep-
resentatives from only the leading Communist parties. The Comintern's 
control apparatus or headquarters was divided into two parts, overt and 
covert: 
The overt side had a section responsible for the compilation of the 
data furnished by the heads of the Communist movements; an information and 
press (propaganda) section with the mission of keeping current and briefing 
all foreign news throughout the world; a school section; charged with or-
ganizing courses for the political and ideological education of the cadres 
of foreign Communist parties; archives; a library with a secret section which 
contained all books prohibited in the USSR; and a technical section with 
the sole duty of organizing foreign travel to and from the USSR. 
The covert side contained a section which exercised direct 
contra of Communist cadres by NKVD functionaries; a small secret 
Se8tiOn in the informatiOn and Press section which controlled a

over 50 NhVD members. The covert side maintained contact with 
all countries and the Comintern delegates in these countries. The 
functions were to receive or send secret material and directives 
to secret Comintern agents and to transmit funds. 
Members of the Secretariat responsible for the different 
sections in the international Communist movement were as follows: 
Kolarov Balkans;Iledk - Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria; 
Florin - Scandinavia; Togliatti - France and Italy; Andre Marty - 
England and the United States; Dolores Ibarruri - Spain, Latin 
America and India; a Japanese (name unknown) - Asia. Gottwald 
was editor of the Comintern publication titled "The Communist 
International." 
The Comintern was the "General Staff for World Revolution". 
It was headed by Georgi Dimitrov who was controlled by Dmitriy Z. 
Manuilski, hanuilsky was, in turn, controlled by the Central Committee 
Zhadanov. The cadres and secret sections were controlled by NKVD 
members, Shorkin, Bielov and Blagoeva and they, in turn, were con-
trolled by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. 
This alpparatus insured that no.foreign Communist Party could function 
independently either financially or politically. 
b. 1943-1951. - This period was highlighted by the nominal 
dissolution of the Comintern in 1943 and the transfer of its func-
tions into the Foreign Directorate of the Central Committee. 
The Soviet press and radio general directives were no 
longer left to local interpretations. A new entity, the Cominform, 
was created in 1947. It was intended to strengthen the Communist

parties "in their resistance to plane of imperialist expansion and 
aggression along all lines - -state, political, economic and ideological." 
Direction of Communist parties and fronts still rested with the Central 
Committee through the sensitive channel ih the local directorates of the 
NGB and Soviet General Staff in each Soviet foreign mission to the local 
Communist parties. In other words, little change had taken place except 
that the Comintern apparatus was now directly within the Foreign 
Directorate of the Central Committee. 
Dissolution of the Comintern. -- In early 1943, high-level 
Nazi propagandists began a campaign to expose to the Soviet Union's 
World War II allies the nature of International Communism, which had 
been working through the Comintern. Since these facts were detrimental 
to the Soviets, the dissolution of the Comintern was announced as a sop 
to the United States and Great Britain. The Second World War, in which 
the Soviet Union engaged in a life and death struggle with Nazi Germany, 
brought to a temporary halt the Communist plan to Sovietize the world. 
Sorely in need of financial and military assistance from non-Communist 
countries, the Comintern had to pass through all the phases of a 
respectable demise, 
Igor Gouzenko, the cipher clerk attached to the office of 
the Soviet military attache in the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, in a 
statement made on 10 October 1945 to the Royal Commission said: 
"The announcement of the dissolution of the 
Comintern was probably the greatest farce of the Com-
munists in recent years. Only the name was liquidated, 
with the object of reassuring public opinion in the 
democratic countries. Actually the Comintern exists and 
continues its work."

The reasons advanced by the Communists for this hoax 
are: 
(1) The Communist International from the first 
exposed the real meaning of the anti-Comintern 
Pact as a weapon for the preparation of war by the

The Cominform. -- In October 1947 the Soviet Government es-
tablished the Cominform. This act constituted, in effect, a declara-
tion of economic and political war against the United States and 
heralded the beginning of the cold waro 
The Cominform is primarily an association of representatives 
of the Communist parties of the European satellite countries and is covertly 
directed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union, The Cominform's primary function is to provide integrated 
direction to the Communist parties, 
Moscow's major problem of foreign policy began in March 1947, 
when the United States announced policies of military and economic aid 
to Greece and Turkey. In Paris, on July 3, 16 nations proceeded to 
implement Europe's role in the Marshall Plan. The Soviets therefore 
had to create a specialized Information Bureau which they claimed was to: 
(a) Expose and prevent the possibility of new aggression 
on the part of Germany and to create prolonged co-
operation of all sides among the peoples of Europe. 
(b) Expose the United States, which had an agreement with 
England to eliminate competitors in the world market 
in order to establish a dominant position for the two 
countries, 
Thus, the East-West split was formally acknowledged. Communist parties and 
fellow travellers often had difficulty in interpreting and analyzing 
Soviet policy as set forth by the Soviet radio and press. This was cor-
rected by specialized direction and interpretation from the Cominform. 
The difficulties encountered from these general directives were described 
by Louis Budenz, former Managing Editor of the Daily Worker: 
"The Party bureaucrats are so absorbed in watching what 
Pravda says each day, checking the radio for Soviet statements 
and trying to decipher what messages are being conveyed, that 
they frequently lose sight of American technique. This is not 
what Stalin and othel Soviet overlords want or expect, 
but it is almost inevitable in any such puppet-like setup as

the Party leadership. Very conveniently, they do not have 
to do any fundamental thinking?they just let Moscow do it 
for them. But the constant tension of trying to catch every 
hint and order sent from abroad is a man-size job in itself. 
And then they have to make sure that they are doing everything 
according to the specification of the order. 
"...When the line changes, as one shrewd and out-
standing comrade said in an unguarded moment, we have to 
beat our breasts and pretend the last line was carried out 
badly in order to hide the fact that we act on word from 
across the sea."* 
c. 1951-To Date. - Traditionally, the intelligence directorate of 
the Soviet General Staff served as the liaison and communications link 
with foreign Communist parties, even before World War II and the dis-
solution of the Comintern. In 1951, by a decision of the Central Com-
mittee of the Soviet Union, the responsibility for liaison with the foreign 
Communist parties was taken away from the intelligence directorate of the 
Soviet General Staff and turned over to the Foreign Intelligence Directorate 
of the then hGB. The Foreign Directorate of the Central Committee does not 
have any permanent representatives abroad. In special cases a representa-
tive may be sent on a flying visit, but normally liaison with foreign 
Communist parties is effected through the representatives abroad of the 
foreign intelligence directorate of the MVD. 
Correspondence with Moscow on Communist Party matters is given 
special security handling. Even within the foreign intelligence directorate 
representation abroad there is an effort to conceal the existence of any 
liaison with local Communist parties. 
The present specific tactical direction of foreign Communist 
parties is from the Central Committee's Foreign Directorate, through 
MVD channels. The foreign intelligence directorate operates through

its representatives in the Soviet missions abroad. An MUD line also 
extends into the Soviet Satellite missions operating abroad. When the 
Foreign Directorate of the Central Committee sends a representative to 
foreign Communist parties, he is likely to be a par:ty man with MVD train-
ing, since an MTD man can be expected to have greater familiarity with the 
craft of covert contact. 
"Legal" representatives of the foreign intelligence directorate 
as well as Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel abroad are categorically 
forbidden to recruit Communist Party members without special permission from 
Moscow. Both overt and covert elements of foreign Communist parties collect 
information and pass it through MVD channels to the Central Committee, 
which is the primary customer for all important intelligence reports. 
This new streamlining of contacts makes detection of Communist 
agents extreioely difficult. The prime interest in exploitation is no 
longer intelligence to be forwarded to the Army, Navy or Air Force, 
but information to be forwarded to the policy makers, the Central Committee. 
Thus a Communist Party member or sympathizer in a policy control position 
will be contacted only by IND experts and the chances are he will not be 
asked to furnish documents, but only to influence policy in favor of Com-
munist policy. 
Conclusion 
The Soviet press and radio give the general policy line to be 
followed by the foreign Communist parties; specific tactical direction is 
given through MVD liaison channels. In addition, foreign Communist Party 
members are briefed when they visit Moscow. Others are trained in 
special schools, but all control, whatever the channel, emanates from

the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 
International front organizations are envisaged primarily as a 
means of educating the non-Party masses abroad. These organizations 
are rarely exploited as Soviet intelligence organs. Individuals 
belonging to these fronts are rarely recruited because their identifi-
cation with the movements do not give them access to worthwhile targets. 
The MND does not mix into foreign political matters; its job is to 
inform the Soviet Government, not to execute policy. Execution of policy 
is left to the Central Committee. 
II 
USSR Control over the Satellite Countries 
Soviet control of the Satellites is based on the Soviet armed forces 
stationed in Eastern Europe, on the MVD, on Soviet diplomatic, economic 
and military missions in each Satellite and is exercised through the 
Satellite Communist parties and governments. 
The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, through links 
established during training or other prior relationships, controls 
members of the central committees of the Communist parties in the 
Satellite states. Top party leaders in the various Satellites who have 
been trained in Moscow are, for all practical purposes, Soviet men or 
women, and are completely subservient to Moscow. 
Some control over official activities in the Satellite countries 
is exercised through the local embassies of the USSR. The Soviet 
ambassadors are in some cases considered direct representatives of the 
Central Committee and deliver instructions and other guidance to local 
Communist leaders. This channel is used for the transmittal of bulky 
printed materials. Personnel of the Soviet representations abroad carefully

study the local scene in the Satellite country to which they are assigned 
and submit reports to Moscow. 
Soviet military advisors are posted to the general staffs of all 
Satellite countries and therefore are familiar with the nations' war 
plans, report all details to Moscow. 
END representatives are assigned by Moscow to the Satellite countries, 
work closely with the local security and intelligence services, and are 
thus aware of all current trends and popular attitudes within the country. 
MVD personnel submit reports on their activities to the MVD headquarters 
in Moscow. MVD representatives advise the local services in both positive 
intelligence and counter-intelligence matters. Joint activities are 
undertaken against third countries, especially the United States. The 
target of all such activities is ultimately the United States, and the 
USSR enlists the collaboration of Soviet Bloc embassies or legations in 
support of this effort. (See annex on Soviet World-Wide Espionage.) 
In some instances, the latter channel is more effective as a working base 
than the Soviet Embassy itself. 
Not only are all details of military and security matters concerning 
the Satellites known to the USSR, but also all aspects of the political, 
economic, and social life in those states are directly or indirectly under 
the control of the USSR. Although MOSCOW permits and encourages programs 
of cultural, economic and technical collaboration among the Satellites, 
the Soviet control system is designed to bind the Satellites individually 
to the USSR rather than to one another.

EAST-WEST TRADE 5-26-55 
Past and Present 
W-92A9.111-Pl-L.P.1"2 
Before the war the Soviet Union accounted for less than one per 
cent of world trade, and the countries that are now its satellites 
accounted for another six per cent, For Western Europe, however, 
trade with the nations that now make up the Soviet bloc was more 
important that these figures indicate. Over ten per cent of Western 
Europe's total imports came frlm the bloc, and for a few commodities. 
Russia and the East European countries were a very important source 
of supply indeed. This region furnished Western Europe with nearly 
twenty per cent of its imports of grain, some fifteen per cent of 
its coal and over twenty-five per cent of its timber. 
If these supplies were valuable to Western Europe in normal times, 
they were a matter of the utmost urgeney in the hungry, dollar-short 
years that followed the war. When in 1_948, the West Europeans came 
to chart the path to recovery and to calculate how they might, 
in the five years allotted by the Marshall Plan, free themselves 
of dependence on American aid, one of their central assumptions was 
that Russia and Eastern Europe would resume their exports on something 
like the pre-war scale. 
They were completely disappointed. The accompanying table 
shows how feeble has been the performance of the East as a supplier

in the post-war years. By the middle of 1953* and long after wartime 
destruction had been made good, timber exports from the Soviet bloc 
were still a small fraction of what this area shipped to the West 
before the war. Its exports of coal and gain to the West were still 
less than half the prewar rate. Instead of supplying Western Europe 
with nearly twenty per cent of its requirements of grain, the bloc 
now provides barely ten per cent, and shipments of wheat in 
particular have shrunk dismally. A further peculiarity of East-
West trade in grain, moreover, is that Rumania and Hungary, both 
large prewar exporters, have until now virtually disappeared from 
the grain market. It is the Soviet Union which today does the bulk of 
the exporting. Oil is another commodity that until recently had all 
but vanished from Eastern exports agreements, and now that it is 
once more appearing, it tends to show up not in agreements with 
Rumania, the biggest traditional exporter, but in those with the USSR.

countries have discovered in the Eastern bloc other defects as a 
supplier* Without exception, the satellite countries perennially 
fail to supply the quantity of goods promised under trade agreements 
with the result that exports from the West must be interrupted or 
curtailed until the Eastern country makes good its export promises 
or finds other means of payment. 
Price is still another source of trouble. Eastern negotiators 
lack flexibility and in consequence fail to respond quickly to 
changes in price on world markets; long after the sharp decline 
in world coal prices, for example, Polish trade missions were demand-
ing for their coal exports the premium that prevailed at the height 
of the boom, The USSR has often followed a similar course when 
negotiating exports of wheat and barley--a policy that leads either 
to outright refusal to buy on the part of the West or to a prolonged 
period of haggling while trade comes to a standstill* All in all, 
the shortcomings of the East as a supplier have been a major, if not 
the major, limitation on East-uest trade in the postwar years* 
As a market, too, the USSR and its satellites have been a 
disappointment to Western traders since the end of the war. A 
great deal has been heard abut the extent to which Western embargoes 
have narrowed markets in the East, but less is said about the East's 
rejection of the many ceneumer goods that have always been freely 
available in the West. 
At no time have the Western nations imposed restrictions 
that would prevent the East from buying a wide range of consumer

goods in the countries on this side of the Iron Curtain. In fact, 
the Soviet bloc has hitherto shown very little enthusiasm for such 
goods. By 1950, for example, East European purchases of Western 
textiles were little more than a quarter of their 1938 level. 
Before the war the satellites were substantial importers of 
Western consumer goods, but nowadays it is clear that the USSR 
has forced on them its own policy of holding down consumption to 
a bare subsistence level. Even the much heralded new deal for the 
inhabitants of the bloc has so far brought few changes in the general 
pattern of Eastern imports. Apart from sizeable purchases of butter 
Soviet eyes have turned not to Western con?
sumer goods but to the machines with which to make their own goods.

It would be unrealistic in any review of East-West trade to ignore 
the position of Germany which before the war played a dominant role in the 
economies of the Dalkon countries. Of all the goods that Western Europe 
exported to the East in 1938, one-third came from Germany. In the 
Period 1930-,37 Germany sent eight and a half per cent of its total 
exports to the satellite countries, and another six per cent to the

Soviet Union. Union, Germany's most important exports, in value, to the East 
iron and steel manufactures, chemicals and electrical 
products; and in some of these categories the East f'en bought as 
much as twenty per cent of Germany's total exports. 
The war and the policy that the USSR has since pursued have radically 
altered this relationship. Until 1950 West German exports to the 
Eastern bloc were scarcely worth mentioning. In that year they reached 
twenty-five per cent of their prewar volume but in subsequent years 
they again fell. Even the new German-Rumanian trade agreement, one of 
the first fruits of the Kremlin's new enthusiasm for East-West trade, 
aims to restore trade between the two countries to a mere quarter of 
the 1938 level. 
The truth is that so long as Russia dominates the satellite countries, 
the Eastern markets, as Germany knew them before the Isar, have vanished. 
Germany's prewar prominence in these markets was based in part on the 
continuous presence of its commercial representatives and in part on 
the complementary nature of the two economies. In both respects Germany 
has now been displaced by Russia. German commercial hegemony has given 
way to Russian bonds that seem unbreakable; not only in the personnel 
of many of the key industries appointed from Moscow, but also the 
industrial development of each satellite is being shaped to support the 
needs and policies of the Soviet Union. 
Nowhere is this process more striking than in Eastern Germany. 
What was once an integral part of the German ec-momy has become an 
appendage of the Soviet economy, a unit in which heavy industry is

being developed so rapidly that it will shortly act more as a competitor 
than a.'S,_a complement to Western Germany. Even if tomorrow all trade 
barriers between the two halves of Germany were to be abolished, it 
would be found that the old channels and the old bases of exchange had 
been destroyed. At the present time Eastern Germany hardly manages to 
fulfill its side of the very small trade agreement with the West 
Germans; its deliveries are perpetually in arrears which means that 
trade is, in fact, sustained only by what amounts to the extension of 
credits from the 1Testern partners. 
Indeed, the payments problem is the crucial factor in West German 
commereial relations with the East. Traditionally, the Eastern countries 
paid for German goods in food and raw materials, products that are now 
scarce within the Soviet bloc and a glut on the market in the West. 
Already the Federal Republic has more than it can do to absorb the 
wheat and other primary products with which such countries as Turkey 
and Argentina strive to may off their debts to German exporters, 
Slme of Germany's industrialists may look wistfully to the 
East for export markets, but if the bloc cannot pay in commodities, 
then the question of German credits is bound to arise. Even the 
generous grant of credits, however, does not inevitably ensure a 
smooth path for East-West trade, as can be seen by looking at 
experience in the postwar years.

to suspend all further shipments of iron ore until the Czechs made a 
serious effort to settle their bills. 
Poland has shown a similar inability to compete on commercial terms. 
Its procrastination during price discussions has til.e and again forced 
to look elsewhere for coal supplies, with the result that 
imports of Polish coal dropped sharply from 4 million tons 
in 1948 to 1,4 million in 1953. 
II 
The Economy of the Soviet Bloc 
In 1938 Soviet foreign trade amounted to only one per cent of the 
worldls total. However, the countries that the USSR absorbed during and 
after the war, or has since come to dominate (the Baltic states, Eastern 
Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria) were

more active traders and in 1938 accounted for nearly six per cent of 
the world's trade. 
As soon as Stalin had consolidated his position the Russian state 
began to work unceasingly towards the goal of self-sufficiency, and 
from the early !thirties onwards it withdrew further and further 
from participation in world trade. For the Communist planners, foreign 
trade has always been essentially a political instrument, to be used 
only in so far and for so long as it helps the attainment of the prime 
objectives of Soviet policy?to create a completely independent Socialist 
economy, indestructible in war and insulated from capitalist crisis in 
peace. 
In a relatively poor country such as the Soviet Union was before 
the war, rapid and foreed industrialization seemed the most obvious 
route to self-sufficiency. In the eyes of the Kremlin, the develop-
ment of industry, particularly heavy industry, had two further advan-
tages. It served as a basis for an armaments industry as big as any 
in the world; it also conformed with a political conviction that lies at 
the heart of Marxist philosophy: for enduring Success a Communist revolu-
tion must rest on a vast industrial proletariat, 
The inevitable corollaries to this policy are that the urban and 
rural bourgeoisie must be eliminated and the peasant herded into col-
lective farms in the hope that his numbers may be reduced, the fruits 
of his labor harvested more easily by the State and that eventually 
he may be transformed into a kind of rural proletariat. Since the 
end of the war the USSR has progressively thrust these same policies In

the nearby satellite states and is now fast remolding them in the image 
of the Russian economy. 
The consequences of these two policies--the pursuit of self-
sufficiency and the overwhelming emphasis on heavy industry?have been 
calamitous for East-West trade. k'erhaps the most dramatic illustration 
is provided by the way in which Moscow has warped the traditional trad-
ing pattern of the Eastern countries under its domination. 
Before the war countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary 
conducted less than fourteen per cent of their trade with what is now 
the Iron Curtain community. Within the short space of six years at 
least two-thirds of their totaltrade has been forced into Communist 
channels. 
It often happens that while one communist leader speaks glowingly 
of the prospects for East-"est trade, another, indifferent to the contra-
diction, simultaneously boasts of the massive re-direction of satellite 
trade and of the achievements of Comecon?the sn-called Council for 
Mutual. Economic Aid, Comecon is, in fact, a Soviet-created institution 
through which Moscow coordinates the international trade of all the 
European satellites and hence, indirectly, their economic development. 
Its central purpose has always been to encourage trade within the orbit 
at the expense of trade with the outside world. 
During the past years the economies of the satellite nations have 
been reshaped entirely to satisfy Eastern policies and without regard 
for the requirements of trade with the West. Just as in Russia, economic 
planners throughout the Eastern countries aim single-mindedly at creating 
a large industrial proletariat.

-15-
From 1949 onwards all the Eastern plans have placed primary 
emphasis on the development of heavy industry. Each nation's pain-
fully high level of compulsory saving is funnelled chiefly into the 
expansion of heavy industry, while agriculture has been more or less 
starved of new investment funds, On the average a mere three per 
cent of the national product is devoted to capital improvements for 
agriculture as compared with an amount at least three times as great 
that normally goes to industry. 
From time to time changes have been .1tr.odtced in the various 
'plans of the satellite countries, but in the past they have invariably 
been directed at fixing even higher production targets for heavy 
industry always at the expense of both light industry and agriculture. 
Added to this neglect there is the restiveness of the peasant, deprived 
of consumer goods, compelled to deliver set quotas of produce to the 
government and forced against his will into collectives. In the cir-
cumstances it is not surprising that the satellites cannot provide on 
the old scale the export surpluses of food and grain with which they 
used to balance their trading accounts in the West. 
The USSR itself suffers from similar trouble, though perhaps not 
so acutely as the satellites. There is little doubt but that through 
its own excessive concentration on heavy industry, the Soviet Union 
has reduced its export surplus of such traditional products as timber 
and wheat. 
This lopsided distribution of resources within the Soviet bloc is 
reflected in the foreign buying of the orbit as well as in its selling

policy abroad. Only in periods of acute and threatening shortage at 
home or when Western nations make their sales of machinery conditional 
on the purchase of cnnsumer goods, do members of the bloc part with 
foreign exchange for the products of Western consumer industries. For 
the most part their reserves of foreign exchange are spent exclusively 
on those items that will fill the gaps in their own heavy industry or 
will serve to maintain it?machinery, ships, metals and raw materials. 
Still another limitation that Communist policy has imposed on 
East-West trade, and one that is inherent in the Soviet system, is 
the State monopoly of foreign trade which goes hand in hand with State 
planning of the entire economy. This means that responsibility lies 
mainly with state officials who fear to make mistakes, indeed dare not 
make mistakes, and who consequently prefer the safety of rigiditi to the 
uncertainties of expansion and enterprise. Like armchair generals 
they are often preoccupied with the commodities and prices of last 
year rather than with tLose of the present, let alone the future. 
At least one group of British importers is familiar with the 
Russian official who came to this country eager to sell plywood. 
The price he asked was more than doubl.e that ruling on world markets. 
When met with incredulity, he explained that these particular supplies 
had been manufactured during the war and hence, as the British traders 
must know, were very expansive. The price could not be altered without 
upsetting his accounts--and his career.

Consumer Goods  
If the resources of the Soviet bloc are re-directed on any sub-
stantial scale to the production of food and cInsumer goods, then the 
tempo of industrialization and the armaments program must be slowed 
down. If non-Cnmmunist resources are to work the miracle?that is$ 
if Communism is to be saved by capitalism--then the Russians must 
participate in international trade to a degree never contemplated in 
their autarchio plans. This would mean that the Soviet Union would 
have to accept, as it did in the 'twenties, the status of a backward 
area and apply for credits and grants from the 'bankrupt' capitalist 
world. For Russia's own export trades, such as food and timber, are 
also its neglected consumer industries. 
Much of the Russian excitement over raising consumer standards is 
primarily propaganda and only the smallest of marginal improvements 
are intended in standards of living behind the Iron Curtain. The 
likelihood is that Communist leaders will hold grimly to their indus-
trial targets, while giving the domestic consumer no more than the 
minimum increase that will keepltimmderal;ely fit and moderately 
willing. 
It is unfortunate for the Soviet Union that there should at this 
time be demands on its economy from still another quarter, demands that 
if met in full and from the Soviet bloc alone will place an enormous 
strain nn its resources, Communist China, now in the very early stages 
of its own dash to industrialize, has called for fraternal help from

Approved For Release 2006/08/41:_CIA-RDP85S00362R000600140001-9 
the USSR. If help is refused there is the danger that China will 
be compelled to look elsewhere--to Japan, Germany, 3ritain and even to 
the United States. 
Chinese requirements are no doubt immense, but failure on the 
part of the Soviet Union to deliver the goods could have disastrous 
consequences for Russian policy. It would be a mammoth demonstra-
tion to the Asiatic world that more than thirty-five years after 
its own revolution, the Communist pioneer was still unable to pro-
duce industrial goods on a scale sufficient to help its less 
developed allies. In its disappointment China might well drift 
out of the Communist bloc and the Communist movement would lose 
much of its magic for the populations of Southeast Asia. The 
desire to bind China closely to the Soviet bloc must lend urgency 
to Russia's need for Western industrial goods. In so far as the 
West provides them, it helps to sustain the Sino-Soviet partnership. 
III 
22ziptyx2pAgainkl,Perf_orrnamts_  and Aims 
Fundamentally, the attitude of the USSR towards trade with the 
West has not varied one jot in postwar years from the view it took 
in the 'thirties, Its policy is not concerned with the normal 
motives that underlie international trade--that is to say, the 
effort to secure some division of labor, with each country specializing 
in those commodities which it can produce most efficiently. 
Bluntly, Russian interest in East-West trade has only two 
objectives: the first is to secure from the West the materials 
Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP85S00362R000600140001-9 
Approved For Release 2006/0ZOQ : CIA-RDP85S00362R000600140001-9 
It still lacks to maintain and expand the armaments and heavy 
industry of the Soviet orbit; the second aim is to sow dissension 
between the members of the Western alliance. The alleged benefits 
of East-l'est trade are exploited in an endeavor on the one hand 
to create friction between the Western nations, and on the other 
hand, to set Western businessmen against their governments. 
From time to time the marginal interest of the Kremlin in 
East-West trade has shifted in accordance with its own internal 
plans. Roughly four stages can be distinguished in the trading 
behavior of the bloc since the end of the war. 
Throughout the immediate postwar period genuine two-way trade 
was at low ebb because of wartime devastation in all parts of 
Europe. During this interval the USSR, though briefly and grudgingly, 
accepted aid from UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation 
Administratinn) and so, with greater enthusiasm, did the countries 
of Eastern Europe. The latter also held out eager hands for sub-
sequent loans from the US Export-Import Bank. This stage came to an 
abrupt end when, as a result of the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia 
and mounting evidence in other directinns that the Soviet Union 
intended to t!ghten its grip on the whole of Eastern Europe, the 
cold war began in earnest. 
The second stage coincided with the Westts initial ban on 
the export of strategic goods to the Eastern bloc and with unmis-
takable signs that the USSR had put into practice a more severe embargo 
policy of its own. To augment the supplies that they received legally

Approved For Release 2006/08461.: CIA-RDP85S00362R000600140001-9 
through such trade agreements as those with 
the 
Communists at this point set about organizing illicit trade channels 
designed to evade Western export controls. By this means they sought 
to acquire, regardless of cost, the materials they needed for their 
heavy industrial program: copper, machine tools, alloy metals, 
and so on. 
Propaganda was used, though not on a very large scale, to support 
this very renlistic drive* The more dependable incentive employed by 
the Russian and satellite traders was the monetary one?huge profits 
were available for the Western business man, the intermediary, the 
smuggler or the financier who chose to break the laws of his country. 
To obtain strategic materials, the Communists and their Western 
accomplices resorted to such devices as forging documents to mask 
the true destination and nature of goods, shunting cargoes from 
one free port to another until they could be slipped through the 
Iron Curtain, and establishing business concerns in the West--
ostensibly reputable but in fact run by servants of the Communist 
Party* 
These dramatic--even melodramatic?practices have never really 
solved Moscow's problem. They are risky, expensive and increasingly 
ineffective as the West progressively eliminates the loopholes. It 
no doubt grew obvious to the Kremlin that only unfettered, legal 
trade could provide the heavy industry of the bloc with key materials 
in sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices. Moreover, there was 
also the hope that once the initial realmament boom had slackened in

the West, supplies would become easier and markets more competitive 
in the capitalist world. Stirred by these prospects the Communist 
world joined to its underground trade program an energetic pro-
paganda drive. 
The third phase in Moscow's policy towards East-West trade, 
was inaugurated during 1951 with a gigantic propaganda campaign 
that culminated in the Moscow Economic Conference of April, 1952, 
to which business men and academic economists from all over the 
world were invited. To this gathering Communist officials offered 
the traditional carrot held out ever since the great depression 
--the Eastern market is insatiable; there is no limit to the goods 
it can absorb and thus no limit to the relief it affords, both 
for capitalist unemployment and for competition between capitalist 
states. 
To the British business man Communist spokesmen pointed out the 
advantage of having German and Japanese energies sidetracked into 
the development of Eastern markets. For the Germans and the Japanese 
there were tempting reminders of their historic association with 
Eastern markets and their added value now that British and American 
'imperialists' were squeezing them out of colonial markets. 
The underdeveloped areas of the world were not neglected either; 
they were told that not only could the Communist bloc absorb all 
their surplus supplies of raw materials but also it would in return 
provide them with machinery, lunimperialisti technical advise, and 
perhaps even with credits. Threughlut the Conference, the keynote

was that but for American hectoring., Western export controls would 
disappear and East-West trade would automatically bourgeon. 
Before the eyes of the delegates, the Russians dangled the 
famous INesterovt figures. Nesterov was the 
official organizer of the Conference and the man whose task it 
usually is to welcome and woo 7esterners on these occasions. His 
figures gave totals for the volume 
Russians claimed could be achieved

possibilities of EastrUest trade. 
the Soviet bloc amounted to :;;;21400 
of East-West trade which the 
provided the West abolished 
were presented in such a way as 
a dazzling impression of the 
The outside world's trade with 
million (imports plus exports) in 
1951; according to M. Nesterov, this trade could be increased in 
1953 to about 4,700 million. 
It was not quite clear precisely how Moscow intended to 
divide its benefactions as between the various eapitalis countries; 
was singled out as the probable recipient of at 
least 21(') million's worth of orders per annum, while Western 
Europe as a whole was told it might expect orders worth 3,_,I730 
million over a period of three years. The backward areas were even 
more favored--they could expect orders for at least another 
;i2-3,000 million over the same three year period. Representatives 
from Communist China also expressed keen interest in Western goods 
and implied that a fifty per cent increase over the 1951 level of 
trade would be welcome,

There seemed no limit to the goods that the Russians and 
their satellites were ready to order. British visitors, for 
emample, were convinced that the Soviet Union was prepared 
instantly to place enormous orders for British textiles. 
The returning business men were particularly elated by the 
fact that none of these commodities came even remotely within the 
Western embargo lists and orders for such consumer goods auto-
matically earned the approval of Western government officials. 
A number of British delegates hurried hone full of optimistic 
expectations and set to work. Month after month went by and the 
orders still hung fire--with one exception: an order from the 
Chinese fer e8.4 nillionla worth of -,3ritish wool tops. 
Experience among delegates from other countries was almost 
identical. When it came to the point, Communist orders for consumer 
goods melted away leaving a hard core of strategic goods, apparently 
the sole commodities in which the East was genuinely interested. 
Not only did the East fail to expand its trade with the outside 
world, but from April 1952, when the Conference was held, its 
trade actually declined and continued to do so until by the end of 
1953 it had reached ita lowest point since the lean years of 1046-47. 
Meanwhile, Western statisticians and economists busied 
themselves with an examination of the iNesterovt figures. When 
they had fought their way through the mist of inflated ruble 
values, generalizations about percentage increases and duplicate 
offers, the experts found that the Nesterov program, even if the 
orders had been hard, implied a volume of East-West trade smaller

than the prewar level--in some cases as much as fifty per cent less 
than in 1938. So far as increased trade was concerned, therefore, 
the Moscow Economic Conference was a fiasco. The Western business 
men who had rushed off to Moscow wound up with pleasant memories 
of the Russian ballet, and empty order books, while the Russians 
failed to loosen the strategic embargo. 
But from the Kremlin's point of view the Conference was all the 
same a highly satisfactory charade. The average newspaper reader in 
the West, glancing through the headlines, grew accustomed to the 
notion that vast Soviet trade orders were there for the asking. 
Certain business men were so bemused that they blamed their own govern-
ments for depriving them of Eastern orders. Some were even induced 
to join organizations sponsored by the Communist Party with the 
object of agitating for the relaxation of export controls. 
One such organization, whose roots can be traced directly to 
the Conference, is the 3ritish Council for the Promotion of Inter-
national Trade. Mr. rden, the British Pratister4-
described this body as 'A Communist front organization...mainly con-
cerned with the dissemination of Communist propaganda'. 
It is ironic that Moscow now refuses to have any overt dealings 
with this particular group, for once such bodies have accomplished their 
propaganda mission and have been discredited for their pains, the 
Russians wash their hands of theml preferring to act through more 
respectable channels.

The essential essential dishonesty of the Conference became crystal 
clear when it was learned in the autumn of the same year that 
Stalin himself had published almost simultaneously a treatise 
on economics in which he wrote off the future of East-Mest trade 
as it is understood in the West. Stalin pointed out that the 
world is now divided into 'two parallel world markets'?one, tha 
Communist bloc, has been created under the leadership of Russia and 
this leadership has been so effective that Communist countries will 
soon have no need of imports from the capitalist countries. 
'But the fundamental thing, of course, is not the economic 
blockade (the Western embargo), but the fact that since the war 
these countries (the Soviet bloc) have joined together economic-
ally and established economic cooperation and mutual assistance* 
****The result is a fast pace of industrial development in these 
countries* It may be confidently said that, with this pace of 
industrial development, it will seen come to pass that these 
countries will. not only be in no need of imports from capitalist 
countries, but will themselves feel the necessity of finding an 
outside market for their surplus products,' 
The fourth phase of the Soviet Union's postwar concern with East,* 
West trade opened in August of 1953 and coincided with IA, Malerikovts 
admission that the masses behind the Iron Curtain needed greater 
material encouragement in the form of more food and consumer goeds* 
There are, of ceuree, no barriers of Western construction that 
prevent the Communists from buying any consumer goods that they can 
pay for. However, the fact is that they did not rush to boy women's 
hosiery, re-rigeraters and automobiles. Only a feweea very few--con-
sumer goods were acquired from the West. The Russians made twn or three 
spectacular purchases of butter, they bought oranges paper, bottling 
machinery, and some silk piece goods; but fir the most part they 
sought instead the macLines with which to turn out their own con-
sumer goods.

The fifth and latest phase in the development of East-rest 
tra,':e al:pea d with the eclipse of Malenkov in February 1955. With a 
return to major emphasis upon the development of basic industry, 
the Malenkov thesis of an increase in the availability of consumer 
goods has been dropped. With this change the Soviet record in 
East-West trade which was so poor in absolute terms and so far 
from the promise of 1953, shows indications of becoming even poorer. 
Although the banner of increased trade will continue to be waved by the 
USSR, the governing clnsideration will continue to be that of Soviet 
policy, the most recent change in which would seem to preclude any 
great rise in actual East-West trade. 
Undoubtedly there was a greater element of reality in these 
Soviet approaches. They acknowledged their need for Western goods 
more openly and they showed greater zeal in scraping together exports 
that the West might be persuaded to buy. Russia produced some 
surprising shipments of pig iron and substantially increased its 
exports of oil. %mania also came into the market with its first 
sizeable offer of wheat since the war. But it was obvious that there 
existed in the East an acute shortage of exportable goods and thus 
as a last resort the Soviet Union was compelled to sell gold, 
platinum and silver?altogether over 1.40 millions worth in the 
laLlt six months of 1953. 
It can be taken for granted that if the industry and agriculture 
or the Soviet bloc could produce an exportable surplus, then East-
"est trade might have expanded at least in the short in and at

least to its prewar dimensions. But any conceivable expansion 
was bound to fall far short of the grandiose . ropnrtions claimed in 
Moscow's most recent propaganda drive. 
In a series of moves initiated by the USSR towards the end of 
1953, a stream of Western business men--French? British and German--
travelled to Moscow to fill their order books, The British delegation 
were wined and dined and shown the sights. Meanwhile the Moscow Press 
and radio made great play of a Ikabanov figure'--a declaration of the 
Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade that the Soviet Union could place 
orders to the value of 4,120 million in 3ritain over three years. 
Trhen the delegates got down to brass tasks, howevar, they failed 
to find a new Eldorado. More than half the items requested by the 
Russians were clearly of strategic importance, and the prices 
they offered often took no account of the rise in values since early 
1950. Simultaneously it became clear that the Soviet negotiators were 
window-shopping from country to country throughout Western Europe, 
aiming to play off one starry-eyed capitalist against another. The

assuming that the figure of :a,120 million was fact and not oratory, 
claimed for themselves a similar freedom to provide Russia with

Allies in Berlin seriously jeopardized their chances of doing business

The prewar pattern of trade with China will never return. In the 
'thirties, Chinals most important trading partners were first, Hong 
Kong, acting as an entrepot for other Asian powers and second. Japan 
followed closely by the United States. For most of the nations in the 
Nest, China was not a very important market?Britain, for example, sent 
less than one per cent of its total exports to China before the war, 
Germany slightly over two per cent. However, as a source for certain 
specialized products?liquid eggs, soya beans, bristles, raw silk and 
tung oil--China did have considerable importance for Western countries. 
Hong Kong owed its supremacy in the China trade to its role as 
banker and merchant, functions which it still performs but on a greatly 
diminished scale. There can be little doubt but that the long-term aim 
of the Chinese Communists?they have said so quite plainly--is to 
eliminate even the present degree of dependence on the services pro-
vided by Hong Kong. It will be tolerated only so long as it is useful 
to the Communist regime?economically as a channel for Western goods that 
cannot be obtained from the Soviet orbit and politically as a hostage

which, it it is hoped, may secure British forbearance toward the new 
China's foreign policy. 
The traditional trade connect ons between Japan and China 
rested in part on the complementary nature of the two economies; 
China, a vast and primarily agricultural country seamed to provide 
a natural market for a highly industrialized community such as Japan 
with a huge and growing population confined to a few small islands. 
China imported Japanese textiles and similar cheap mass consumer goods 
and in return it furnished Japan with such raw materials as ooal and 
iron ore. At the same time Japan's puppet state Manchukuo in North 
China was being rapidly developed by its new masters and absorbed an 
increasing volume of machinery and transport eauipment. 
When today Japanese business men speak longingly of the Chinese 
market, they have in mind a client whose role in the Japanese economy 
was very similar to that played by the 3alkans in prewar Germany. In 
each area there was a degree of political and commercial penetration 
that converted both the Jalkans and China into something that resembled 
captive markets. Nowadays it is the Soviet Union which occupies this 
commanding position. 
As soon as the Chinese Communists came to power they set in motion 
a series of economic and political policies which have inevitably trans?
formed China's trade relations with the outside world. As rapidly as 
possible they eliminated private business--Westarn business men, in 
particular, were harshly dealt with, and the regime ostentatiously 
broke many of the long?standing ties between China and Western commerce.

INwpi It has plundered Western firms with a ruthlessness matched only by Nazi 
behavior when blackmailing would-be Jewish refugees. 
Those firms which have escaped with confiscation may consider them-
selves fortunate, for others are compelled by threats of all kinds to 
remain, so that the new regime may exploit them still further. Their 
chief value to Communist China is as a source of foreign exchange which they 
are obliged to import and hand over on a variety of pretexts--in the 
form of a premium payment required before a foreign employee is per-
mitted to leave China, or in order to pay the wages of swollen 
staff which they are forced to keep on the payroll long after the State 
has denied the firm the right to engage in any remunerative work. 
The Communists were hardly in the saddle before they set on 
foot plans to expand Chinese industry, particularly heavy industry. 
In part this was done in the interest of self-sufficiency. Of equal 
importance, howe7er, was the goal of creating an industrial proletariat 
on the Soviet model; the new regime was fashioned originally by 
peasants and intellectuals, an improper procedure by the light of 
Marxist forthodnxy, which postulat)s that the industrial proletariat 
shall be the vanguard of Communist revolutions. Still a third character-
istic of post-Communist China has been its preoccupation with building 
and equipping a powerful military apparatus both to support its inter-
vention in Korea an to aid insurgent movements such as the Vietminh 
in Southeast Asia. 
Certain consequences have flowed inexorably from these new policies. 
China turned to the USSR for armaments and then for industrial and

technical personnel; and to most of these transactions the Soviet approach 
has boon strictly commercial, Although China is said to be receiving 
a substantial amount of ruble aid, there is much evidence to show that 
the Soviet Union is a stiff and exacting creditor. Accordi/gy, a 
large part of China's export surplus is today preempted by its ideological 
friends. 
China's ability to buy goods from the outside world is now small. 
It has directed more than three-quarters of its trade towards the 
Soviet bloc; its own growing industry has first call on the coal and 
raw materials formerly exported to Japan; and old customers, discouraged 
by the uncertainties of trade with China, have found alternative supplies 
of the products it used to sell. It is estimated that without a severe 
cut in its exports to Russia and the European satellites, China can spare 
no more than 420 million a year for purchases in the free world. 
The truth is that China is turning itself into an integrated part 
of a Communist economic bloc that stretches from the Elbe to the China 
Sea, How far this process has already gone is illustrated by the fact 
that the central European satellites have become exporters of Chinese 
bristles and soya beans. 
Conversely, China now exports Ceylon rubber to the Soviet Union. 
Symbolic of this trading pattern is the establishment in East Berlin 
of the Chinese Export-Import Corporation, an organization set up by the 
Chinese Communists as the focal point for all trade negotiations between 
West and China, It is undoubtedly the Communist intention that Chinese 
trade commissione-s operating in Europe will ultimately destroy the value 
of Hong King as a point of contact and a channel for Western goods.

At the present time, then, all the basic trends of Chinese policy 
make for a reduction not an expansion of East-West trade. The stra-
tegic controls imposed by the free world on exports to China have 
undeniably had the same effect. They are the consequence of a United 
Nations decision, taken in June, 1951, that China as an aggressor in 
Korea should be denied all outside supplies of war-potential materials. 
But when and if the embargo of the free world is lifted it will in all 
probability be found that the China trade has changed beyond recognition. 
China's demands from the West will be concentrated almost exclusively 
on the products required for the development of heavy industry. It will 
no longer be a market for textiles and other consumer goods; the Chinese 
Communists have said flatly that they are not interested in such 
Nom. frivolities. 
Fundamentally, the position of China as a participant in Fast-
Tiest trade is much the same as that of Russia in the 'twenties. The 
ultimate goal is autarchy. To roach that goal the Chinese will be 
eager for Western capital goods. They will be willing to absorb 
steel, rolling stnck and cInstructinn equipment in large quantities, but 
their appetite will be limited by the inability to provide enough exports 
in return. Only if the West is prepared to grant them large-scale credits

V 
Summary and Conclusions 
Trade with foreign nations is not an end in itself. Its purpose 
and its justification is that it makes possible a higher standard of 
living for all participants. This principle is an axiom that most 
people are ready to accept when they consider only the immediate 
consequences of trade. They are less willing to apply it to some 
of the indirect consequences. 
If, for example, British exports of machinery strengthen the 
military power of a potential ag,!ressor against world peace, and if 
the British Government is therefore compelled to Increase its defense 
expenditure, then these exports are responsible for a fall rather than 
a rise in the British standard of living. In the last resort, the 
economics of East-West trade turn on this simple proposition. 
But for those who are prepared not only to ignore this principle 
but also to run risks with their national security, it is high time to 
re-state the obvious facts involved in East-est trade. 
The first of these facts has to do with the dimensions of the 
potential market in Communist territories, Britain and other nations 
that live by trade must pursue vigorously every possible opportunity. 
But it is one thing to act energetically and quite another to foster 
illusions about the potential scale of the trade in question. The 
Soviet bloc and China are not unlimited markets. And the limitations 
Imposed on trade with these areas by the Communists themselves are far 
more permanent and far more damaging than the controls that the West 
has decreed for strategic reasons, Marxist rulers adhere to policies

\ow' that place self-sufficiency above all else; that, with few exceptions, 
exclude consumer goods from import lists; and that cripple the ability 
of the bloc to pay for Western goods. There will always be a handful 
of ingenious traders who will find some profit in trade with the East, 
but by and large the Communists restrictions leave little scope for 
exporters interested in broadbased, substantial and lasting commerce. 
Second, the possibilities of East-West trade have been greatly 
exaggerated. Communist spokesmen have deliberately done so for propa-
ganda reasons and out of a desire to obtain strategic goods. They 
hare found an enthusiastic echo in the West among fellow travellers 
and also among wishful thinkers who regard East-West trade as a magic 
formula that will solve all their marketing problems. Undoubtedly trade 
with the East can be expanded beyond the depressed levels of the past 
year. There is certainly more trade to be done with the Soviet bloc and 
China, but not a groat deal more unless the West cares to finance it. 
Third, it is the Communist bloc which is in urgent need of East-
West trade--not the West. It is the Communist economies which are 
stretched.: beyond their limits by the weight of inordinate ambitions. 
Over the coming years, the Communist bloc plans simultaneously to 
industrialize China and provide it with a modern and well-equipped army, 
to raise living standards for the masses, and to maintain in Soviet 
Europe the present tempo of industrializatinn and military expansion. 
By themselves the resources of the Communist world are not equal to all 
these tasks.

These three facts point to one conclusion: that Western credits--
or outright grants--ars the key to any sizeable expansion of markets 
in the East. 
Once East-West trade is put in this perspective, it becomes simply 
a matter for the nations of the free world to determine whether and on 
what terms to extend aid to the Communist bloc. Since in the short 
term credits imply for the giver a cut in the standard of living, these 
nations may well conclude that any initial sacrifice should be reserved 
for proven friends, for such peoples as the Asian partners in the 
Colombo Plan and such needy members of the free world as the undeveloped 
countries of Africa and South America. When their wants are met, the 
nations of the West can reasonably be asked to make further sacrifices 
only if credits are granted to the Communist bloc on terms that will bring 
long-term economic benefits to the democratic peoples--that is to says 
credits should be made available on condition that there is a change in 
the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and China which will lessen the 
need for *heavy armaments bill in the 'Test. 
The Communist world must first Ove clear evidence that it has 
abandoned itS efforts to subvert and dominate other nations, in 
particular by promoting so-called 'liberation movements' in Asia. 
To date there has been no such evidence. So long as it is lacking, 
the logical course for the trading nations of the free world, if they 
wish to expand their commerce, is to coneentrate their energies on 
eliminating the difficulties that hamper trade witl their existing best

customers. No one has calculated the growth in trade that would result 
within the democratic world alone from such humdrum efforts as the 
shortening of delivery dates, the production of better and cheaper 
products and above ally the further relaxation of import quotas and 
tariffs. 
In the long run these are the only durable solutions available for 
those business men who are reluctant to cater for anything less than a 
sellers, market and also for those who hope that competitive German 
and Japanese products can be deflected into Communist markets. Sooner or 
later they must all accept the fact that the Communist world has no 
abiding interest in Western products and that through trade within its 
own borders there still remain tremendous opportunities for raising the 
standard of living in the free world. All too often in recent years 
traders and politicians have spent a disproportionate amount of time and 
trouble chasing the remote, unreliable and politically suspect markets of 
the East.

"PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE" - SOVIET STYLE 
inificance of "Peaceful Coexistence" 
The Soviet use of the term "peaceful coexistence capitalizes upon 
man's natural desire for peace. The contrast between Soviet pronounce-
ments and Soviet deeds has created great confusion in the minds of men. 
To clarify this, it is necessary to examine Soviet policy as guided 
by Communist theoretical reasoning. The principle of "peaceful co-
existence" is a smoke screen designed to conceal the true designs of the 
international Communist movement as delineated by Marx and Engels, and 
later by Lenin and Stalin. It is only one of the methods which the 
Communists have been using in a variety of tactics and which reflects a 
temporary shift of emphasis in their over-all strategy of fomenting world 
revolution. 
"Peaceful coexistence" is not new in the program of the Soviet 
Government. Emphasis on this policy is dictated by the current position 
of the Soviet Union in world affairs. It also conforms with the basic 
ideology of Marx as interpreted by Lenin and Stalin. In order to under-
stand the term, a basic distinction must be made between foreign policy 
of the USSR and the organized world international Communist movement. The 
former is only the tool of the latter.

Communist Theory and Practice 
Official pronouncements made by the Communist parties of the world 
and the Soviet Union have, in the past, raised the issue of "peaceful 
coexistence" as a program for world peace. Such announcements invariably 
raise the question among the countries of the free world of whether a 
change of policy is taking place or merely a temporary shift in tactics. 
These questions can easily be answered by examining the basic doctrines 
of the Soviet Communist Party. Pronouncements are propaganda, but Com-
munist ideology is implemented as militant policy. The Soviet Communist 
Party, which sets these policies, regards itself as infallible. To 
follow Party policy is both the right and duty of the regime. 
Communist theory states that the principal task of the Party is to 
follow world events closely, and interpret them correctly, particularly 
crises in various countries, in order to seize the right momeut in which 
to launch a revolution. Theoretical Communism holds that the class struggle 
is inevitable, that Communist principles must be interpreted in a universal 
sense and that it is impossible to develop a completely Communist society 
until the entire world is Communist. 
The Communists regard their ideological heritage as having a more 
dominant influence in the formulation of policy than other factors. The 
dictates of the Party are, therefore, more important than the decisions 
of the policy-making bodies created by the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. 
The enlargement of a policy of "peaceful coexistence" at any time, either

a tactic designed to advance the international Communist movement.

is significant for in October 1947 the Soviet Central 
Soviet Communist Party established the Cominform. This 
in effect, a declaration of economic and political war-
United States, and heralded the beginning of the "cold 
East-West split was formally acknowledged. 
as it may seem, the "Peace" campaign was a direct sequel 
to, and a consequence of, the proclamation of the "cold wee. For seven 
years it has been in practice as an instrument of the ',cold war". 
The proclamation of Andrei Zhdanov at one of the early meetings of 
the Cominform laid down the doctrine of two camps?one headed by the Soviet 
Union and the other by the United States and Great Britain. This was no 
new doctrine, since it had been stated repeatedly by Lenin and Stalin. 
Zhdanov merely made it plain to that body that the universal desire of man 
for peace was to be perverted and exploited in an effort to persuade him 
to support Communist parties and Soviet policy.

Soviet State". Since the Communists continue to reiterate this, develop-
ment of this policy must be considered. 
During the period of March 1917 to July 19210 generally known as 
the development and isolation period", the Bolsheviks seized control 
of the state and established the U.S.S,R. Their goal was the overthow 
of all existing governments and the establishment of a global Communist 
state. In 1919 Moscow became the seat of the world-wide Communist Third 
International. One of the main principles laid down during the period 
was that no tactical move or policy was inconsistent with Communist princi-
ples, so long as it advances the cause of world revolution. As early as 
1919, "peaceful coexistence" was one of the tactics adopted as Soviet 
policy. 
During 1921-1932, the rapprochement period, the Soviet Union sought 
to establish its internal security by treaties and agreements of non-
aggression, non-intervention and neutrality pacts. Moscow subscribed to 
international peace movements, but again the widely subversive activities 
of the Communist International proved governmental actions as mere tactical 
moves made necessary by the weakness of the Soviet State. 
The period 1933-1939 was largely characterized by efforts to establish 
a system of collective security in the face of the expansionism of Germany 
and Japan. The factors regulating Soviet policy were collective security, 
peace, universal disarmament and the United Front. But the Communist 
International continued to work underground to build a world Communist 
society?

The period 1939-1946 was occupied by the Soviet Union's war for sur-
vival against the Nazis. During the 1947-1955 period--that of the Comin-
form--the U.S.S.R. has embarked on a vast propaganda campaign for "peace-
ful coexistence", while at the same time engaging in subversion of Czecho-
slovakia, war in China, aggression in Korea, Malaya and Indochina, and 
continued subversive activities of the international Communist movement 
throughout the world. 
International Communist Movement 
Daring the entire period 1919 to date, the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union covertly directed?as it continues to 
direct and implement?Communist basic doctrine, which never changes or 
vacillates. Militant groups of Soviet colonists, mostly indigenous to 
the country they are to subvert, are trained in Moscow. They are then re-
turned to their native countries and actively engage in activities designed 
to destroy the existing forms of government and to establish piecemeal the 
Soviet Socialist Republics of the world. Control of the satellites is 
more direct and open. Party leaders in the satellites have in virtmlly 
all cases been trained in Moscow and to all intents and purposes they are 
Soviet citizens, completely subservient to Moscow. Army and police con-
trols are also direct and in most cases overt. 
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
contains the Section for Liaison with Foreign Communist Parties. This

is usually referred to as the Foreign Section of the Central Committee. 
It directs, controls and supports world-wide Communist movements. It also 
directs and controls Communist-"front" organizations, the Society for 
Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Anti-Fascist Soviet Youth 
Committee, the Anti-Fascist Soviet Woments Committee and the World Peace 
Council. 
The Communists have used many and varied organizations to throw up 
their smoke screen of "peaceful coexistence." One of the principal and 
most specialized is the World Peace Council. Its campaigns are supported 
by all Communist "Front" organizations. From its headquarters in Vienna, 
the Permanent Executive Bureau, composed of 50 members (24 known Communists 
and 19 closely associated with the Communist Party), issues resolutions 
for approval by "World Peace Congresses." These Congresses adopt resolu-
tions without question. The purpose of all resolutions is to promote the 
political aims of the U.S.S.R. by exploiting the universal desire for peace. 
Whatever the "front" or vehicle used to promote their peace campaign, 
the Soviets keep tightly in their own hands the control and finances of 
what is often represented as a spontaneous popular movement. They assure 
Communist majorities on all committees and "bureaus" which issue instruc-
tions, draft resolutions and organize conferences? 
Communist Party. USA - The Communist Party, USA, in its official 
pronouncements has put forward "peaceful coexistence" as a program for 
world peace. United States Communist Party leaders by their statements

? 7 - 
have shown that "peaceful coexistence" is a policy of the U.S. Communist 
Party and the Soviet Union alike. The duplicity of these statements, on 
the other hand, is revealed by their ideological motivation. U. S. Party 
leaders openly state that "the first great strength of the Communist 
Parties in all countries is their scientific Marxist-Leninist theory" and 
that "flexibility in strategy and tactics and orthodoxy in matters of 
principle are the Communist rule. This theory has may one objective--
that of turning the wheel forward until the world-wide union of Socialist 
Republics shall have been established." 
9PecefuJ. -- The Soviet Unionts oxecutive agent 
for the advancement of Communism in Asia is Communist China. Peiping has 
repeatedly put forward as a basis of "peaceful coexistence" their "Five 
Principles": 
1. Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and 
sovereignty. 
2. Mutual non-aggression. 
3. Mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
4. Equality and mutual benefit. 
5. 
Peaceful coexistence. 
These principles are merely slogans of the official Chinese Comaunist 
propaganda machine. If they are examined closely, they all mean very 
much the same thing and are the principles which govern normal relations 
between most non-Communist states, although they are not set down in

writing. The Chinese Communist Government evidently considered that 
they needed to announce these slogans because their normal conduct of 
international relations is so blatantly abnormal. 
The Chinese Communists, taking their orders from the Central Com-
mittee of the Soviet Communist Party, first issued these slogans after 
their aggressive annexation of Tibet in 1950. But during 1950 they were 
also engaged in open aggression in Korea and Indochina. This is further 
prcof that underlying Communist doctrine and not open pronouncements govern 
their policies and practices. 
The ?Five Principles" were reasserted in a different context after 
the Geneva Agreement when Chou En-lai visited New Delhi and Rangoon. 
Again this was overt propaganda while Communist subversion continued. 
Mao Tze-Tung, the Chinese Communist leader, openly asserted the Communists1 
true principles on the 28th Annivcrsary of the Communist Party of China. 
In his dissertation, "The Dictatorship of the Peoplets Democracy", which 
still governs their policies, he stated: "It is impossible to sit on the 
fence ...no third road exists." 
Mao Tze-Tung further elaborated: 
"There are social sectors, there are countries which have real 
party politics, a democratic life, real civil liberties. In such 
places one adopts the Popular Front, to attract the left-wingers 
and the leftist groups, good or bad, sincere or not. Tempt them, 
each through his particular weakness, as the devil tempts. Help 
them to get what they want; put pressure, firt with offers, 
later with threats: Compromise them if you can, so that they 
can't get away. And this every day, without respite, one after 
the :other with as deep a psychological study of each as possible".

plusion 
"Peaceful coexistence" is a tactic in the strategy of International 
Communism. The actions which Communists must take in terms of strategy 
are basic and never change. Although Communist policy dictates that the 
basis of relations with other countries is the "coexistence" of two 
opposed systems, they openly admit that the purpose of this doctrine is to 
delay war until the Communist revolution reopens in Europe or until 
colonial revoluticns come to a head. Until this happens, the maintenance 
of peaceful relations is an obligatory task. 
In order to bring about these revolutions, Communists operate under 
the theory that it is possible to conquer the most powerful enemy by 
taking thorough and skillful advantage of every "fissure", however small; 
by using every possible means to gain an ally, even though this ally be 
temporary and vacillating; and by proselyting for peace they are covertly 
carrying out the best defense of the U.S.S.R. The Communists themselves 
state that "Those who do not understand this do not understand even a 
grain of Marxism and of scientific modern socialism in general". 
Therefore, it is obvious that while espousing "peace" and "peaceful 
coexistence", the Communists continue a drive toward absolute mastery of 
the world. Their tactics are all to be found within the framework of 
a carefully constructed and all?embracing plan based upon Marx?Engels as 
interpreted by Stalin and Lenin.

In a relatively short period of 30 years, Moscou-directed colonial 
imperialism has met with considerable success. It has fixed an iron grip 
on the millions of non-Russians within the boundaries of the U.S.S.R. 
It has established rigid domination over the Eastern European puppet 
states. It has brought Communist China into its orbit. From China it 
has spread out to Korea, Indochina and Southeast Asia. The long arm of 
Communism has extended from Moscow through Prague to Latin America, 
In all important areas not under Communist rule it has had varying 
degrees of success by a subtle and powerful subversion of free governments. 
As has been demonstrated to the world, Soviet-Communist leaders 
openly preach "peaceful coexistence", while at the same time they expound 
the classics of Marxism which teach that in the sphere of theory there can 
be no concessions. As a result, the people of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, 
Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, 
Communist China, and North Vietnam have now been incorporated into the 
Soviet orbit against a strident, continuous background of "Peaceful 
Coexistence - Soviet Style".

EAST GERMAN MILITARISM - SOVIET INSPIRED 
The illegal remilitarization of East Germany has now proceeded to 
the point that the Garrisoned Peoplefs Police (Kasernierte Volkspolizei, 
or KVP, the East German "Army") has seven combat divisions. There are 
two corps, each containing one mechanized and two rifle divisions, and an 
independent mechanized division which may serve as the nucleus for a third 
corps similar to the two now extant. The KVP is steadily developing into 
a force capable of participating in limited combat operations. Small 
naval and air elements have also been developed. 
In order to give a semblance of credulity to the fiction that East 
Germany has no armed forces, the Minister of Interior, rather than a 
defense minister, has charge of the "police" forces. Under him, a Deputy 
Minister of Interior heads the Main Administration for the Garrisoned 
People's Police (Hauptverwaltung fir die Kasernierte Volkspolizei (HVKVP) 
and performs all the functions of a minister of defense. A Deputy Chief 
and Chief of Staff of the HVKVP supervises planning and staff work, while 
three deputy chiefs of staff directly command the ground, sea, and air 
forces. 
KVP divisions are organized along Soviet lines but are not yet com-
pletely identical with Soviet rifle and mechanized divisions. The KVP 
is supplied with Soviet weapons and equipment, employs Soviet tactical 
doctrine in its training, has Soviet-type uniforms, and is completely 
Soviet-controlled. The role of the KVP in any combat operation will be 
determined, not by Germans, but by the Soviets.

The planning of international Communism visualized a "Free Germany 
INIppi based on Communism" in the early 19201s. The Communists' present policies 
are only an interim implementation of steps toward this ultimate goal. 
B. Anticipated Formation of East German Army by Soviet Utilization of 
German Prisoners of War 
The Soviets' long-range plan for a "Free Germany based on Communism" 
was a part of their over-all strategy looking toward world domination. When 
German soldiers first fell into their hands in 1941, these captives became 
important pawns in the game. They were to be exploited and manipulated to 
further Soviet imperialism. As a result, the prisoners' legal rights under 
the rules of warfare as set forth by the Hague and subsequent Geneva Con-
ventions were largely disregarded by the Soviets. True to their concept 
of war as a total struggle in which no aspect of life is immune, they 
Initiated a practice in which every prisoner was denied the right to remain 
%Ime a neutral, to return to his homeland, or to pursue any policy contrary to 
that of the USSR. 
The above plan embraced not only the German PW's, but also those of 
Japanese and other nationalities captured in World War II. More recently 
it was applied to POWs taken by Communist armies such as the Vietminh in 
Indochina and it can be seen in the North Korean and Chinese Communist 
utilization of prisoners in Korea. The insidious plot is standard, often 
effective, and planned to further the ultimate Communist goal of world 
domination. 
Following their avowed maxim that the end justifies the means, the 
Soviets, in the early stages of World War II, began to lay their plans 
for the domination of Germany. The prisoners were a very important seg-
ment of this well-planned scheme. Early in the game, the Soviets organized

the "antifa" committees in Germany and among the German POWs in their hands. 
These committees were on a low level. The next step was the establishment 
of a National Committee for Free Germany (NKFD) which was composed of 
officers and selected NCOs. Next came the German Officers Association 
(BDO), composed of selected German Generals and officers. This was eventually 
to be used to help firmly establish and support the East German regime and 
East German Police under the authority of such veteran Soviet-German Com-
munists as Walter Ulbricht, Erich Weinert, Otto Grotewohl, Wilhelm Fleck and 
Mrs. Rubiner. Such prominent personalities in this group as Generals von 
Seydlitz, von Daniels, and Graf von Hulsen, still held in Moscow, may one 
day be used as political trumps, depending on the turn of events in East 
Germany. Field Marshal Paulus, captured at Stalingrad, was returned to 
East Germany. Field Marshal Paulus, captured at Stalingrad was returned 
to East Germany j late autumn 1953. 
Soviet tactics of utilizing and exploiting POWs evolved in the early 
stages of World War II. The implementation of this Soviet POW plan helped 
in the establishment and strengthening of the now Communist-dominated 
state subservient to the USSR. This typical Soviet policy was a unilateral 
action, which serves Moscow's purposes and completely disregards agreements 
on post-war Germany made by the USSR with its fighting allies at Yalta 
and elsewhere. 
The POW organizations by which the Soviets sought to consolidate con-
trol of Germany are as follows: 
1. "Antifa". 
Wen Nazi power was waning, the Communists began organizing 
"Antifa" units among prisoners held in the USSR. In the POW camps in the 
USSR, evening courses as well as full-time schools conducted regular training

in order to induce these trainees to return home and cooperate with native 
Communists. Until repatriated, graduates of these "anti-fascist" schools 
frequently held supervisory jobs in the camps. The "Antifa" units were 
also active in Germany. The history of these organizations indicates that 
the Soviets planned an integrated function for them. 
2. The National Committee for Free Germany. 
This Committee was formed in 1943 under the pretext that it was 
to be used only for propaganda purposes. When the Western Allies became 
alarmed that this group might develop into a Communist-dominated German 
Government in exile, the Soviets hastily assured the Allies that it was 
purely a propaganda scheme to weaken the German Army and Nazi State. The 
later assignments of the POW component groups clearly portray the true aim 
of this committee. The membership of the Committee consisted of: 
a. A group of 45 selected German officers, many of whom 
presently hold positions in the East German Police, Government, and military 
establishment. 
b. German civilian Communists in the Soviet Union such as 
Walter Ulbricht and Wilhelm Fleck. Some of these people now hold high posi-
tions in the East German Government. 
c. German Generals whose names were useful for propaganda in 
Germany, such as von Seydlitz and Paulus. The Soviets miscalculated upon 
the importance of names and this group was later dissolved. 
Expert Soviet psychologists were used to influence this organization. 
Daily meetings were held and it was made to appear that this was a group 
of unquestionable patriots working together to save the Reich. The oldtine 
German Communists maintained control throughout the existence of the Free 
Germany Committee.

3. German Officers' Association. 
This was founded shortly after the initiation of the National 
Committee for Free Germany. This was the instrument by means of which a 
closer and more personal contact could be established with internees of 
other camps. From this organization came camp and front line emissaries. 
The latter carried on propaganda among German front line units, and the 
former were assigned to various camps for work in accordance with the or-
ganization's policies. The Soviets hinted to these groups that, as a reward 
for cooperation, they would be given influential positions in the future 
German State. At Lunovo another group of Generals under the supervision 
of Mrs. Rubiner prepared textbooks for German schools. In this way Com-
munist instruction material was produced for utilization in Germany during the 
postwar period - a field in which the Soviets anticipated the Western 
powers, although without much success. 
4. Activists. 
After the cessation of hostilities in 1945, the Soviets dis-
carded their pretense of utilizing and training prisoners for propaganda 
reasons and replaced all the emissaries of the German Officers' Associa-
tion with so-called political activists who were staunch Communists. Germans 
who belonged to the Communist Party prior to 1933 and members of the former 
Communist Youth Movement came to the fore. The camp "Aktivs" completely 
dominated the inmates of the POW camps. At this point, Communist "education" 
or indoctrination became intense. 
With the end of hostilities, the National Committee for Free Germany 
and the German Officers' Association disintegrated, since the political 
elite of Ulbricht, Fleck, etc., had been dispatched to East Germany. In

November 1945 the two organizations were formally dissolved in a ceremony 
in Moscow in which von Seydlitz and Weinert signed the protocol. 
In 1948, forty-one German officers were selected to attend a special 
Antifa school at Krasnogorsk and this group was designated as Section III. 
Sections I and II were training propagandists and journalists. Section III 
was a final training school in which Communist doctrine was re-emphasized 
to a special group of students to be repatriated. From this group 
emerged such men as Lt. Gen. Vincenz Mueller, Major General Hans Wulz, and 
Col. Wilhelm Adam, all of whom now hold high positions in the East 
German military forces (OP). 
When the "Peoplels Police" (Volkspolizei) was founded in the Soviet 
zone of Germany on June let, 1945, it was generally assumed that this was 
to become a force safeguarding law and order after the end-of-the-war 
chaos. Few people suspected at the time that it would become the core 
of a military force shaped after the Soviet army, serving the purposes 
of Bolshevism and ready to spring into action whenever its initiators 
required. 
The KVP-system, which costs the East German taxpayers five thousand 
million marks a year (one-sixth of the Soviet zonal budget) has:approxi-
mately 125,000 to 130,000 troops under its command, in addition to the 
regular and border police. 
The tact that such troops exist and are steadily being_impraved, is 
one reason for giving serious consideration to theproblem of -German 
.roUnification along democratic lihos.

*TREE" GERMAN ELECTIONS -- COMMUNIST STYLE  
Though obligated by the Potsdam Agreement to promote democracy 
in the zone of Germany occupied by them, the Soviets have violated 
the Agreement flagrantly to conceal Communist weakness. Behind a 
smokescreen of confusion the Russians have forced non-Communist 
parties into a "coalition" dominated by Communists. Party leaders 
who opposed the union either fled to the West or stayed to be kid-
napped and murdered. Craven leaders surrendered to Communist 
dictatorship. 
The Om coalition was launched publicly at a convention in 
Berlin, in April 1946, as the "German Socialist Unity Party" (SED). 
From the outset all power was concentrated in Moscow-trained agents. 
Receiving daily instructions from the Russians, the Communist dictat-
ors organized a system on the model of the USSR. Communists were 
placed in control of every strategic office in East Germany. 
To make their puppet government appear "legitimate," the Soviets 
organized an "election" for a new parliament in East Germany on 
October 15, 1950. The Communist Party was ordered to win this 
"election" by whatever means, including force, fraud and deception. 
When the results of the alleged vote were published, the National 
Front (the Communist ticket) claimed to have received 99.7 per cent 
of all votes, with more than 98 per cent of eligible voters participat-
ing. Such numbers are so obviously fabricated that they were con-
sidered ridiculous by everyone.

Public counting of the votes was forbidden because in the 
previous "election" of May 1949 the Communists had been. embarrassed 
by thousands of negative ballots, many of them carrying insulting 
remarks. Party workers were ordered to explain to all voters that 
any voter who was absent from the polls on election day would be 
.considered an enemy of peace and unity and subject to deportation 
to a slave labor camp. Communist leaders rounded up populations of 
whole villages and marched them to the polls, allowing none to escape. 
The lmAot was "secret", according to the Communist meaning of 
the word. Only one list of candidates was printed on the ballots, 
and no mark was necessary to vote the straight ticket. Although 
there were a few booths where a voter could mark his ballot secretly, 
radio announcements made it clear that anyone who went into a booth 
was marking himself an "enemy of peace". Communist spies were present 
at all polling places to take down the names of "enemies", who were 
subsequently thrown into slave labor camps. 
Communist stooges were put on the radio to testify that the 
"election" had been by free and secret ballot. Since the counting 
(if there was any in fact) was conducted in offices of the Central 
Government by Coanunists under direct Russian supervision, no reliable 
information is available as to how many East Germans risked their 
lives to write objections on their ballots. Moscow radio congratulated 
the East Germans for their successful "election", even though every 
principle of an honest ballot had been cynically violated under the 
personal direction of Soviet officials.

SLAVE LABOR IN EAST GERMAN URANIUM MINES  
The Wismuth Aktiengesellschaft (Bismuth Co., Ltd.) is the 
secret Soviet trust that runs the uranium mines in Eastern Germany. 
A state within a state, it has its own laws, supply and transporta-
tion, housing, health and social services--and police. The Western 
world, and even most East Zone Germans, have known almost nothing 
of what goes on behind its barbed-wire boundaries. Last week the 
British Control Commission in Berlin issued a 5,000-word report, 
compiled by British Intelligence, that unwrapped the details of 
Russia's "frantic drive" for the raw material of the atom bomb: 
Some 300,000 Uerman men and women are virtual slave laborers 
in the mines. The women, who are known as "Erzengel" (a punning 
word that means both "arch-angel" and anol of the ore), lay track and 
push ore carts underground. Drillers often work hip-deep in water. 
Many contract silicosis from the dust, or cancer of the lungs from 
the radioactive ore. Few last more than one year underground. Work-
ers lose their regular identity cards and if found outside the mine 
areaare returned in handcuffs. 
The miners' boss is a Major General Malzev, with headquarters at 
Siegmar-Schoenau in Saxony. His organization also includes 15,000 
German administrative workers, 5,000 Soviet soldiers and MVD (secret 
police) agents, and special German police units. 
Mining started at Johanngeorgenstadt near the Czech frontier 
in 1946, but has now spread to more than 230 communities in the Erz 
Bebirge, Vogtland, Goerlitz district, Thuringian Forest, and Harz 
Mountains. Farms and forests are devastated, and whole towns are 
evacuated to make room for workers. As many as 40 girls and women

share a one-room hut. At Meissen, Saxony, a shoe factory is being 
converted into a dormitory for babies whose mothers work in the 
mines. Families are given home leave no oftener than every three 
months. 
Men are taken between the ages of 17 and 50; women from 18 to 
55. Many are recruited by threats of loss of ration cards. 
Factories are often deliberately closed to force unemployed men into 
the mines. Some common criminals are put to work in "penal shafts". 
Trade unions and the Free German Youth organization are forced to 
deliver monthly quotas of "volunteers". Contracts are generally 
for one year, but are often extended without consent. A six-month 
contract has had to be introduced to get new recruits. Workers are 
promised $56. a month--if they can fulfill an almost impossible 
piecework quota. Most earn less than $8. a month. 
Financing is a closely guarded secret, but the best information 
indicates that Eastern Germany has had to supply all the money for 
the project. Preliminary ore grading is done in Germany; the entire 
output is exported. The three top directors of the enterprise live 
in Moscow and report directly to the Soviet Ministry. "The regime 
is, in fact, 
IIa most blatant example of 
colonial exploitation...for the sole benefit of the Russian war 
machine".

REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE 
ON 
FORCED LABOUR 
GENEVA 1953 
APPENDIX III: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF GERMANY 
Existence and Location of Camps and Number 
and Compulsory Workers  
It had been observed that in the Soviet zone 
of Germany, the nazi technique had been taken over 
and improved upon. An inquiry undertaken a year ago 
showed that the population of concentration camps was 
greater at the present time than it had been in 1939. 
There was every reason to believe that 200,000 to 
300,000 prisoners were interned in the six major and 
the six or seven smaller camps.... 
From the evidence of prisoners, it appeared that 
17,000 prisoners at Buchenwald had been sent to 
Siberia in April 1947 and that, on 31 January 1948, 
47,600 prisoners had been deported from the internment 
camp at Feunfeichen for labour in the Kuzbas factories 
in Siberia. 
Some information had been obtained on the camps at 
Bautzen, Jamlitz and tluchenwald as well as on the MVD 
prisons at Pirna, Dresden and Muehlberg.

20, The representative of the American Federation of Labor 
spoke of working conditions in the uranium mines and, referring to 
information supplied by Dr. Fritz Lowenthal, stated- - 
... He himself had seen what was happening in 
Saxony. The work there was mainly the extraction 
of uranium. Theoretically, only persons of from 18 
to 45 years of age could be pressed into service, 
but, in actual fact, children of 14 years and men 
of 65 and over were put to work. The workers were 
obliged, at any cost, to produce the minimum amount 
of work demanded by the occupation authorities. The 
work was extremely dangerous because the miners worked 
underground, inhaling the dangerous products emanating 
from radium. Mr. Lowenthal said that there were no 
safety devices or health safeguards in the mines. 
Accidents had been so frequent that it had been diffi-
cult to replace the male workers. The authorities 
had been obliged to introduce forced labour for 
women. Even pregnant women and mothers of young children 
had been forced to work.

political purpose behind the establishment of these forced labour 
camps, the camps would exist because of the need for cheap and

TREATY AND TRUCE OBSERVANCE - COMMUNIST STYLE  
The Bolshevik Party has had to change its tactics, 
its methods of combat, to shift from legal forms to 
illegal ones, to compromise, to make agreements with 
other parties, other movements, to dodge, to retreat 
in order to advance more successfully later". 
Trud, Moscow, November 4, 1950 
The foregoing statement is basic Communist Party doctrine 
regardless of locale. 
It was inspired by Lenin's philosophy 
that world power politics and diplomacy can be influenced or 
Ao]ded by all sorts of strategems, "maneuvers", "illegal methods", 
"evasions" and "subterfuges". This Leninist philosophy is ac-
cepted to this day as basic guidance by the Communist leaders in 
the Kremlin. In fact, they have no reason to question it, for 
to them it provides the key to survival in encountering world 
problems. No leadership dedicated to an ideology could ask for 
better logic. 
The Soviet Union's record of violating treaties and truce 
agreements as a means of expanding its power and influence is 
unmatched in the history of modern diplomacy, It is a record 
that extends over twenty years of dealings with the United States 
and other powers of Europe and Asia, and it involves broken 
promises involving no less than fifty treaties.

Within a few months after the United States extended 
diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union in 1933 the 
Department of State was reporting evidence tending to show 
violations of this Treaty. Since that time the record is 
replete in instances of active plotting to undermine the 
Government of the United States. On agreements concerning 
other nations the record of the Soviet Union in violating pledges 
to the United States is equally unfavorable. Repeatedly from 
1942 until 1946, the Soviet Union promised to guarantee free-
dom and free elections in Hungary, in Bulgaria in Poland, in 
Czechoslovakia, and in Rumania. Through- subversive tactics 
all. ';hese governments ended up with Communist dictatorships. 
In Asia, the Soviet Union by Treaty in 1945 promised to 
support the Republic of China and to restore Manchuria, Formosa 
and the Pescadores to the Republic of China. In complete dis-
regard to this Treaty the Soviet Union gave unqualified 
political and military assistance to the Chinese Communists 
which resulted in the removal of the Republic of China from 
the mainland of China. Also, contrary to its promise to guarantee 
freedom for Korea, the Soviet Union organized a Communist puppet 
government in northern Korea, and then masterminded the invasion 
of Korea in actual war. 
In addition to the major instances of Treaty violations the 
Communists have committed a series of military truce violations 
extending over a period of a decade and a half achieving great

military gains in China, Korea, and Vietnam. This method of 
tying the hands of a free world military establishment while 
Communist armies do as they please is a relatively unpublicized, 
but nontheless effective device of conducting War By Cease-Fire. 
The Chinese Communists formalized this tactic in 19.8 when they 
issued instructions to their military units in the field to 
disregard the terms of the truce with the Chinese Nationalists, . 
and prepare for the ultimate victory of the Communist military.* 
Years later Chou En-lai defined the objective of War By Cease-
Fire by stating that "Truce is the military counterpart of the 
political tactic of coalition government. It is a means to an 
en, not the ultimate objective". 
Students of past wars have learned to look on the truce as 
a simple matter. Opposing armies roach a situation where both 
sides wish to end the fighting. A brief parley is held, lasting 
a few hours or at most a few days. Either a cease-fire is agreed 
to or the talks are broken off and the fighting continues. If 
there is a cease-fire, a peace settlement follows in due course 
and. the war is over. 
The words of Chou En-lci foreshadowed a total abandonment 
of this idea. Just as coalition government in Communist practice

WAR: BY CEASE-FIRE 
The Truce Violations in China 
The very ability of the Chinese Communist regime to exist 
and grow as a state-within-a-state for twenty years before it 
came to power rested in part on a military posture that was half 
war, half peace. Since its very beginning this regime, in its 
relation to the government it sought to conquer, had followed 
an irregular succession of tactics mixing open attack, retreat, 
diversion, temporary reconciliation, agitation and guerrilla 
warfare.

troops and the relations of the government with its Communist 
rival went from bad to worse. But by this time the purpose of 
the truce stratagem had been largely achieved. The armies of 
the National Government were confronted with a Communist chal-
lenger far stronger than before. 
On January 10, 1946, in an effort to secure Communist co-
operation, and in order to achieve a constructive atmosphere 
for political discussions, which were designed to lead to a 
coalition government and a nationalization of all armed forces, 
fire or truce was agreed to by both sides. The cease-fire order 
stipulated: 
1. A cessation of all hostilities. 
2. Cessation of all movements of troops in China, with 
the exception of a provision permitting certain movements 
of Chinese Nationalist troops--especially their entry into 
Manchuria for the purpose of restoring Chinese sovereignty 
there following the Japanese surrender to Soviet forces. 
3. Cessation of destruction of and interference with 
all lines of communications, and 
4. Establishment of an Executive Headquarters in Peiping 
for the purpose of carrying out the agreement for immediate 
cessation of hostilities. 
The events which followed over the ten months of this pretended 
truce were a nightmare of confusion and unreality. In Chungking and 
Nanking, the wartime and postwar capitals of the Chinese Republic, 
peace talks continued-.in theory at least--from January to November.

On the battlefield there was no peace, and a truce only in name. 
Violations of the truce by the Communists were reported through-
out this period at an average rate of about one every three days. 
When the truce was officially abandoned on November 19 the of-
ficial count of verified Communist violations stood at not less 
than 91. 
In self-defense the Nationalists responded to these viola-
tions by a furious renewal of the war, which spread from Manchuria 
throughout North China during the spring and summer. But the 
military initiative which the Communists gained by their viola-
tions enabled them to move a long way toward the total conquest 
of China. 
The most significant violations were directed at strategic 
Manchuria, where Soviet forces after their 8-day war had accepted 
the Japanese surrender. Over 40 of the Communist truce violations 
are accounted for in this Manchurian operation. Brazenly ignoring 
the truce stipulation on Manchuria, their regiments and battalions 
marched piecemeal over mountain passes from neighboring Jehol 
Province until by April they had occupied most of Manchuria includ-
ing the key cities of Changchun, Szepingchieh, Harbin and Tsitsihar. 
In each case they entered as soon as Soviet troops had left the city, 
conforming perfectly to the Soviet timetable of withdrawal. As an 
additional prize the Soviet forces handed over huge stocks of 
captured Japanese arms and equipment; these the Chinese Reds were 
to use later in organizing and equipping new armies in the final 
struggle for power.

-Li. 
But the assist from the Soviets did not stop there. They 
largely nullified the Nationalists' right of entry into Manchuria, - 
guaranteed by the truce terms, by the simple expedient of closing 
the port of Dairen to Nationalist ships. Thus the National Govern-
ment troops were forced to enter Manchuria by air and by difficult 
overland routes. The whole Communist operation was beautifully 
conceived, smoothly executed, and completely illegal. 
After furious fighting for key Manchurian communications 
Centers, the most the Nationalists could achieve against these odds 
was a military stalemate which -lasted from April to June. In an 
effort to break this stalemate omd get on with the peace talks the 
Nationalist Government on June 7 ordered a I5-day cease-fire for 
its own troops in Manchuria. Later this new cease-fire was ex-
tended to the and of June. But extensive efforts to revive the 
peace talks were fruitless. 
The Communists rejected the Nation-
alist offer to give General Marshall the power of arbitration. 
The sound of guns again drowned out the peace efforts at Nanking. 
By summer .Manchuria was mainly in Communist hands. 
Meanwhile the remainder of the Communists' strategic plan began 
to unfold amid renewed warfare south of the Great Wall, in China 
proper. Here, beginning in the spring, Communist truce violations 
occurred with increasing frequency, aimed for the most part at a 
single objective: breaking Nationalist control of the north-south 
rail lines. Early in Juno these violations blazed into a general 
Communist offensive in North China and the Central Plain area.

The Nationalists, determined to reopen the communications system 
in North China, answered in July and August with a strong counter 
offensive. 
The battle for the railroads continued throughout the summer. 
On August 3 the Communists began a ferocious attack on Tatung, a 
key rail center in northern Shansi* After 45 days the siege of 
Tatung was abandoned; but it was the fuse that set off major 
hostilities ranging over five provinces of North China--Suiyuan, 
Chahar, Jehol, Hopei, and Shantung. 
Thus for ten months the Communists in China waged open war 
under the flag of truce . At last on November 19 that flag was 
lifted by the departure of the Communist delegation from the peace 
table at Nanking. The civil war, which the Communists had never 
stopped fighting, was now officially resumed.* 
Looking back on Communist action in.this period, it is possible 
to see with perfect clarity the military strategy they followed. It 
was to deny the strategic position and resources of Manchuria to 
Nationalist control, and to establish a corridor from west to east 
across North China. by the latter move they cut all Chinals main 
north-south communications routes and split the Nationalist forces 
into isolated commands powerless to launch a coordinated offensive. 
* There was another kind of warfare during this period not waged 
with bullets--a cold war of propaganda. The United States was pictured 
by the Communists as an aggressor in Isia, the imperialist rival and 
successor to Japan. Appeals to Nationalist tr,)ops to desert called on 
them to join in opposing ilmerioa as they opposed Japan. Mass propaganda 
claimed that United States imperialism was more refined and legal than 
that of Japan--but more dangerous and deadly because the United States 
was stronger. The history of Japanese support of Chinese puppet govern-
ments and warlords was now applied to the relation between America and 
the Kuomintang, which was pictured as a puppet of the United States in 
Communist propagandat

At the peace table in Nanking the Communists had found they 
could not gain entry into a coalition government except at the price 
of "nationalizing" their army--thus losing the base from which they 
could later seize full power. So victory by diplomacy was denied 
to them. But?they found another road leading to the same goal. 
Using the cover of truce and peace talks to surprise and demoralize 
their enemies, they carried out vital and illegal military movements 
and reaped a strategic advantage which the Nationalists were never 
to regain. 
It may seem strange that the Communists were able to violate 
their pledged word 91 times in this period without effective 
hindrance from the authorities. Certainly there was no lack of 
efficiency in reporting the violations as they occurred. When a 
truce violation was cempl 
ained of by either side, the Executive 
Headquarters in Peiping sent out a team under U.S. command to in-
vestigate and rectify the violation. After two weeks five such 
teams were in the field. By November there were 36 teams. They 
inspected verified, reported, and protested each violation. But 
they had no means of commanding respect or obedience. The Communists 
showed only contempt for their efforts. One team in Manchuria was 
met with Communist gunfire. Another, sent to stop a Communist attack 
on Pe-ttou-chen in Hopei province, was tricked into leaving the area 
while the Communists resumed their attack and captured the town. 
Thus the prestige of the truce teams dwindled steadily. One rtierican 
official was quoted as saying: ?There have been so many violations 
I could not count them".

The basic difficulty was simple. The only sanction arainst 
truce viol'Itions was the very act which was least desired: openly 
avowed renewal of the war. Tho irony is that precisely this 
sanction was applied in the end-.but not until the Communists had 
taken a decisive step toward final victory.

VIMINIOTAS OF THE KOREAN -ARMISTICE A 
On 8 June 1953 an Armistice Agreement was signed between the 
Commander in Chief, UN Command (CNC), on the one hand, and the 
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA) and the Commander 
of the Chinese People's Volunteore (CPV), on the other hand, concerning 
a military armistice in Korea. They agreed to accept and be bound in?
dividually, collectively and mutually by the conditions and terms as 
set forth in the articles of the Armistice. 
How the Communists abided by these articles can be seen by the UNC 
Charges against the Communists from the period 8 June 1953 to 1 June 
1954. 
1. 3405 UNC and ROK POW's Not Accounted For But Who Nere 
Once Held by Communists. 
After. three amendments, the UN roster of UNC and Republic 
of Korea Army personnel known to have been captured and held by the 0001 
munists amounted to 34051 The list contained only names of persons 
who (1) spoke or were referred to in broadcasts from Communist radio 
stations, (2) were listed by enemy as being captives, (3) wrote 
letters from PW camps, or (4) were seen in PV camps. None of these 
had been reported by the Dcimmnnist3 as having escaped or died, as 
required by paragraph 58a of the Armistice Agreement. They said 
part of the 3405 did notwnr.,t, direct repatriation, but that most had 
never beencaptured at all. In the 43d meeting of the Military Armistice 
Commission (M1C), KPA/CPV called the roster "crudely manufactured" and 
"based on no tenable data at all". The Communists said 519 had been 
repatriated and that 380 had been accounted for on rosters submitted to 
UNC as dead, escaped or released at the front. The Communists presented 
a tabulation of these nameo,

2, yailure of Communists to Report Rotation of Personnel and  
Combat Materiel. 
The UNC implied the Communists were violating the Armistice 
Agreement since they were maintaining a large army yet had not reported 
any incoming material except one AA gun. The Communists interpreted 
this as a charge that they had stockpiled a large amount of material 
before signing the Armistice Agreement. They labeled this as a fabrica-
tion. A Mobile Inspection Team investigation at iliju was unable to 
determine conclusively whether or not the Communists were introducing 
aircraft in crates into Korea in violation of the Armistice Agreement. 
The CNC pointed out its more than 700 transaction reports involving 
more than 5,000 combat aircraft, over 400 armored vehicles, 65,000 
plus weapons and several million rounds of ammunition compared to ?ay 
11 Communist reports dealing with 8 anti-tank guns, 40 rounds of anti-
tank ammunition, 2 anti-aircraft guns, 7 reports on spare parts and none 
on cimbat aircraft. Communists claimed they had strictly observed the 
Armistice Agreement. On 18 March 1q54 UNC again commented on the 
remarkable achievement of maintaining an army without bringing in 
supplies, emphasizing the Communist protestations that they had not had 
bid stocks Of materiel before signing the Armistice Agreement. The 
UNC charged that Neutral Nations Inspection Teams were limited in 
freedom to inspect while the Communists introduced combat material by 
by-passing ports of entry by road and rail. The Communists claimed that 
the Uiju inspection proved the UNC charges false and reiterated their 
strict compliance with the Armistice Agreement.

On 9 February 1954, the UNC sent a letter to the Neutral 
Nations Supervisory Commission requesting that three Mobile Inspection 
Teams be dispatched to investigate charges that the Communists had 
violated paragraph 13d of the Armistice Agreement by introducing rein-
forcing combat material at nine airfields, via two railroad complexes 
and by three rail and road routes. The Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission could not agree to honor the request.

On 19 November 1953, three former Republic of Korea soldiers 
escaped from Communist captivity, taking refuge in an UNC sentry box in 
the Security Area of the MAC Headquarters. The Communists refused a 
joint investigation and insisted these personnel belonged to their side; 
that UNC was forcibly retaining them, and that the three should be 
returned. UNC unilateral investigation disclosed true identity of the 
three escapees. The Communists continued to refuse a joint investiga-
tion. At MAC meeting 30 the UNC proposed a MAC letter to the Neutral 
Nations Supervisory Commission requesting that a Neutral Nations 
Inspection Team conduct an investl.s.ation of both sides, charges. The 
Communists rejected this. Tho 1117C invokod paragraph 28 of the Armistice 
Agreement and submitted a unilatomi request to the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission. Tho Noutral Nations Supervisory Commission 
did not act, since Poles and Czechs held that it could not investigate 
a violation which occurred within the Demilitarized Zone. The Com-
munists again refused a UNC proposal for a joint investigation. On 
18 January 1954 the UNC requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Com-
mission to dispatch a Mobile Inspection Team to investigate Communist

units to determine if PWs were still being forcibly retained. In a letter 
of 19 January 1954, Lee Sang Cho, Senior Member of the Communist side of MAC, 
denounced the UNC charges and advised the Neutral Nations Supervisory Com-
mission that the Communists could not agree to an investigation of the 
charge. This letter clearly influenced the Czechs and Poles, resulting in 
Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission failure to agree to dispatch the 
Team. The UNC was so advised on 22 January 1954. On 26 January 1954 the 
UNC requested another investigation of a different unit in a different 
locality. Again the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was unable to 
agree. In another letter dated 27 January 1954, Lee' Sang Cho stated that 
only the Communists could request investigations, whereas UNC had no grounds 
to do so. The UNC was advised of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Com-
mission's decision on 12 February 1954. 
4. Violation of "Agreement on the MAC Ho. Area. Its Security

During the incident (item 3 above) on 19 November 1953 the

6. Violation of Paragraph 51 of Armistice Agreement by Forcibly 
Retaining Two Former Republic of Korea Army Personnel Who Escaped 
Communist Captivity on 10 December 1953. 
Two former Republic of Korea Army soldiers, dressed in Com-
munist uniforms, escaped from the North and voluntarily surrendered to the 
UNC at a point South of the southern boundary of the Demilitarized Zone. 
These persons had been impressed into the military service of the Com-
munists. Their true identity was confirmed by UNC. UNC proposed a joint 
MAC letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission requesting in-
vestigation. The Communists called the charge "groundless fabrication" and 
"slander" and refused to agree. On 18 December 1953 the UNC made a uni-
lateral request to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate 
the charge of forcible retention and impressment. The Poles and Czechs took 
the view that the violation occurred in the North, but since the escapees 
were at Munsan-ni, an investigation in the South could not reveal what was 
going on in the North. On 22 December 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission informed the UNC that its request was not agreed to. On 18 and 
26 January 1954 the UNC made requests for Mobile Inspection Teams to in-
vestigate Communist units in the North. Both requests were aborted by the 
response of the Czech and Pole members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission to the views of Lee Sang Cho as expresoed in his letters of 
19 and 27 January 1954. (See item 3 summary)

the Communists set up public address systems to harangue the prisoners 
of war in the South Camps. This message was equivalent to "illegal" 
explanations. Also their messages threatened that prisoners of war 
who headed South would be killed by Communist fire from the North. 
The Communists never answered this specific charge.

Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. 
The UNC charged that the Communists did not permit free 
movement of Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in any of the five ports 
of entry in the North; allowed Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to 
inspect only what the Communists report, and did not permit Teams to 
examine manifests or shipping documents or to check train schedules. 
This obstructed and interfered with Neutral Nations Inspection Team 
performance of duty. The Communists narrow interpretation imposed a 
minimum freedom in the North compared to maximum freedom in the South. 
The Communists said they had strictly complied with the Armistice 
Agreement. (See 2 above) (See 9 below). 
9. Illegal Introduction of Combat 4ircraft at Uilu. 
In October 1953, the UNC requested a Mobile Inspection 
Team be dispatched to Uiju to investigate a charge that the Communists were 
illegally introducing combat aircraft in crates. The team was dispatched. 
The initial inspection of the airfield, conducted on the first day after 
arrival, was very limited in scope and was guided by airfield commander*

ways and highways but the Poles and Czechs blocked this motion. On the

uncovered. The airfield commander refused to make a satisfactory accounting 
for the aircraft present at the field. The Communists interpreted the nega-
tive results at Ulju as a positive indication that they adhere to Armistice 
Agreement and that UNC charges were "fabrications". (See 2 and 8 above.) 
10. r_ra_:atioirgAlofAuthoizelntefeencewithOeidNewMedi 
Representatives. 
One of the provisions of the "Understanding of Administrative 
Details" in connection with the Displaced Civilians Program was that news 
media representatives be authorized to cross the military Demarcation Line 
and observe operations in the reception area of the other side. When 
three UN accredited newsmen entered the Communist reception area on 
2 March 1954 and began photographing the unloading of Koreans being 
assisted north by the UNC, the Communists objected and forced the newsmen 
to return tqf their vehicle. 
The UNC protest in the 38 MAC meeting was followed up in 
the 39th meeting by an offer to receive any suggested revision of the 
particular paragraphs of the agreement on the Displaced Civilian Program 
which would permit the Communists to understand the agreement better. 
The Communists replied to the charge made at the 38th 
meeting by charging the UNC with violating the same provisions of the 
agreement by sending the newsmen across the Military Demarcation Line. 
Their reply to the suggestion in the 39th meeting that they might want to 
propose a revision of the agreement was to the effect that if the UNC 
wanted a change, the UNC could submit it, but that the Communists felt 
their concept vas correct.

The Communist charge that the UNC was abducting Kacestn 
civilians was countered by a UNC charge that the Communists were 
merely covering up for their failure to attract returnees and to carry 
out the provisions of paragraph 59 of the Armistice Agreement. Paragraph 
59 related to the transfer of civilians between North and South, The 
UNC challenged the Communist claim that they had "publicized widely" the 
contents of paragraph 59, calling this a relative matter and pointing 
out that as of 18 February 1954 Communists had publicized the article 
for only six days compared to UNCIs 35 days. The UNC quoted Radio Peking's 
report that registration had been completed in the North; explained 
that paragraph 59 does not limit the duration of registration; and 
called on Communists to repudiate Radio Peking. The UNC charged that 
the Communist program had been inadequate giving only "lip service" to 
the publicity required by paragraph 59. The UNC said that no genuine 
registration procedure existed and the above facts indicated a premed:id-
tated plan to deliberately avoid fulfillment of the requirements of 
paragraph 59, and so charged the Communists. The UNC also charged 
Communists with brutality and irhumanity in the long marches and imprison-
ment imposed on civilians. At a Staff Officers meeting on 18 February 
1954. the UNC gave the Communists a roster of 2,831 Republic of Korea 
officials who had been kidnapped from Seoul by the Communists and re-
quested that these 2,831 be informed of their opportunity to return to 
the South. In MAC 38 and 39, the UNC asked Communists for an answer 
to this request, reminding them that no reply had been received, 
The Communists called the UNC charges groundless slanders,

and maintained that they had complied strictly with paragraph 59. 
This Communist attitude continued in MAC meetings 42 and 43, after 
the UNC again reminded them they they had still failed to r eply 
regarding the 2,831 Republic of Korea civilians. 
12. Conspiracy of KPA/CPV. Czechs. and Polp_tio_Rissi_..edit uNg. 
The UNC claimed that the Czechs and Poles were endeavor?
ing to whitewash the KPA/CPV and blacken the reputation of the UNC 
by deliberate unneutral acts, distortions of facts, confusing simple 
reporting procedures, creating disorder, harassing and frustrating 
UNC efforts and picking at minuitia, while condoning and protecting 
the KPA/CPV procedures in the North.

comurisT TRUCE VIOLATIONS - INDOCHINA 
On April 26s 1954, the Geneva Conference met to discuss the 
possibility of restoring peace in Indochina. 
In July 1954, Agreements on Cessation of Hostilities in 
Indochina were issued by the Conference. 
By mid-August 1954 protestations of violations of these Agree-
ments by the Communists began to pour into the International 
Control Commission. 
I. 
Viet Minh Violations of The Agreements on Cessation of Hostilities-- Indochina 
Reasons. - The Viet hinh has given clear evidence that its activities 
are a part of Communist world strategy rather than a local Vietnamese move-
ment. The death of Stalin gave Viet Minh leaders a perfect opportunity to 
reassert openly both their allegiance to international Communism and their 
aim of establishing an integrated Communist regime based on that of the 
Soviet Union and the Peiping regime. 
In an article in "The People's Army", Larch 1953, General Vo Nguyen 
Giap, Defense Minister of the Viet hinh, quoted President Ho Chi Minh's 
oath "always to be strictly bound to the Soviet Union and to follow exactly 
the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin." This was only one of 
many statements made by top party officials. Viewed in the light of such 
utterances, and the experiences in China and Korea, the Viet Minh can be 
expected to comply with the tenets of international Communism of which 
cease-fire violations are a part. 
History. - In Communist doctrine a truce or "cease-fire" is a means 
to an end, not the ultimate objective. Therefore, the Communists have no

compunction about violating a cease fire whenever it appears advantageous 
to do so. As in China during the political negotiations in 1946, the 
cease-fire was (and still is) a means of gaining a respite. The respite 
gives the Communists an opportunity to strengthen their forces while their 
opponent abides by the "cease-fire rules": relaxes his guard, and loses 
whatever advantage he may have pe,sessed. The period of truce Is ac-
companied by a propaganda barrage of "peace" or "coexistence", while a 
gradual build-up of Communist forces takes place. Subversive cadres in-
filtrate non-Communist areas and set up their Communist administrations 
either overtly or covertly. 
The over-all program for Southeast Asia was formalized in Peiping 
six years ago (1949). At that time and in that place the World Federation 
\se of Trade Unions* sponsored what was ter:Led a Trade Union Conference of 
Asian and Australasian countries. Actually, it was a meeting to set up 
the usual program of guerrilla warfare and terrorist activity, subversive 
"united front" arrangements, labor strife and intensive pro-Communist and 
anti-democratic propaganda. 
To maintain a facade of peaceful intentions, the Communists depend 
largely on infiltration and subversion. These prepare the ground for 
"free elections" Communist style and, if the elections fail, the Communists 
are prepared to resort to force. The Geneva Agreements have scheduled

the elections in Vietnam for 1956. In South Vietnam all conditions for 
subversion are favorable, in addition to the fact that the population 
has grown apathetic in the face of constant terror and a powerful mili-
tary threat from the North. 
In such fertile ground the Communists are busy at one of thcir 
favorite tasks, that of absorbing and disrupting by politico-subversive 
methods the functions of a government. Contrary to the provisions and 
spirit of the truce agreement they have been establishing Communist forms 
of government in areas under control of the South Vietnam Government, and 
thus are threatening existence of that government. 
Politico-Subersive Cadres and Guerrilla erations 
Although much publicity has been given to guerrilla operations, the 
main threat is in the politico-subversive cadres which establish the under-
ground governments. In Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam, these cadres 
are guided and controlled by the Lao Dong Labor Party (Communist Party), 
while the guerrillas are under the control of the Defense Ministry. Thus 
the guerrillas receive orders from the political cadres wham they support. 
In South Vietnam the combined politico-guerrilla operations of the 
Viet hinh have three primary missions: 
1. Establishment of Communist local governmental control 
machinery in areas nominally under non-Communist control. 
This technique enables the Communists to establish "base 
areas" in support of military operations long before the 
actual consolidation of the "Revolutionary' government. 
2. Support of military operations. 
3. Intelligence.

The steps in the process of forming Communist underground govern-
ments are: 
Politico-subversive cadres, organized with great care and detail, 
with armed (guerrilla) support are sent into the area to establish 
provincial, county and city governments. Governmental functions are set 
up. On paper these functions (listed below) give an appearance of 
benevolence and efficiency but in practise show up the duplicity and sham 
of the Vietminh, the illusory nature of the benefits they promise ending 
in the final subjugation of the population for the benefit of the state.

the problem of land distribution, the Communists actually start distribution 
(a favorite Communist tactic) in order to secure popular support. The 
peasant who yearns to own land is unaware that upon the completion of the

International Control Commissions and Their Problems 
A control commission can only be effective if both sides act in good 
faith. In Indochina, through its many violations (some of which are men-
tioned in this paper and the annex) the Viet Minh has flaunted the 
authority of the Commissions. It has substantially increased the capa-
bilities of its regular army in North Vietnam and has retained a significant 
capability for political and para-military operations in South Vietnaml

to 
Cambodia and Laos. The Viet Minh has: 
1. augmented the material strength of its armed forces by 
shipments of military equipment from Communist China; 
2. failed to evacuate all military personnel from South Vietnam 
and Cambodia; 
3. consistently sought to consolidate administrative and political 
authority in areas under the de jure .authority of the governments 
of south Vietnam and Laos; 
4. failed to permit the free movement of refugees; 
5. failed to observe the cease-fire in Laos. 
The Commissions are working undcr handicaps which are directly duo to 
the provisions of the accord. This was true in China during the cease-
fire negotiations; it was true in Korea and now in Indochina. The com-
position of the Commissions, which includes Communists, makes unanimous 
agreement almost impossible on certain questions. In China, Korea and 
Indochina, the Commissions have the choice of uncritical acceptance of 
assurances given by the Communists or the almost impossible task of carry-
ing out an effective investigation in an atmosphere of terror and deceit. 
Communist Reaction to Exposure of  Cease-Fire Violations 
????Mfaianly.? 
The Communists will continue to resort to their usual techniaue of 
using a highly-organized propaganda machine to accuse others, especially 
the United States, of the type of violations of which they are gully. 
Tho Communists have intensified their anti-U.S. campaign to such an extent 
that the Viet Minh press is devoting 50 percent of its space to articles 
denouncing American imperialism. This technique has been successful in

the past in propagandizing people under their control as well as in 
nautxal countries. Any confusion works to the benefit of the Communists 
since they violate the "cease-fire" deliberately for strategic reasons. 
Reasons for Communist Violations 
The Communists' aim is a united Indochina (including Laos, Cambodia, 
North and South Vietnam) under a Communist Government. In a public state-
mont on September 2, the ninth anniversary of the Vict Minh independence, 
Ho Chi Minh declared that "victory will be ours." Throughout the speech 
the goal of unity, indopendence and democracy was repeatedly emphasized. 
Ho reiterated anti-United States and anti-colonial sentiments and appealed 
for united opposition. The speech indicates the Viet Minh determination 
to gain control of all Indochina. He implied that this control will be 
achieved by political action, but that the Viet Minh intends to regroup 
their Army and hold it in readiness for any eventuality. 
The Viot Minh efforts will continuo to take the following shape in 
the three Associated States: 
1. Laos. - Expanded Pathet Lao (Communist) forces will continue 
to evade and break the truce agreement and to consolidate their 
control over Northern Laos. Attacks on the Laotian National 
Amy units have been resumed. These will be designed to enlist 
popular support by chalking up Pathet Lao successes. (Two 
Laotian National Army commando posts were attacked by Pathet 
Lao forces on January 12. Tho attacks occurred Just aftor the ICC 
mobilo toam loft the area.) Lo rocontly as April 23, 1,000 Pathet 
Lao troops attacked the 600-man garrison in Sam Neua Province.

2. Vietnam. - The Viet Minh will expand underground in the South 
using their politico-subversive and terror techniques. They 
will be aimed at having do facto control pass to Ho Chi Minh 
without too much overt disturbance. If the Communists fail to 
win the elections in 1956, a swift coup may be attempted. (On 
December 19, 1946, Ho Chi hinh openly broke the then "cease-
fire" agreement with massacres in Hanoi, Tourane and Hue). 
3. Cambodia. - The Viet Minh foothold is the weakest in this area, 
especially since the strong and successful stand by the Cam-
bodians at Geneva against a Viet Minh regrouping area inside 
the state. But once the Communist control all Vietnam and Laos, 
Cambodia may be powerless to resist, 
IV. 
Conclusion 
The International Control Commission has been prevented by Communist 
delaying tactics and by collusion between the Polish delegation and the 
Viet Minh, from investigating and fixing responsibility for major Viet 
Minh violations of the Geneva Agreements. But in spite of any positive 
results the International Control Commission may achieve, violations may be

considerably stronger, the Communists take over all of Indochina by 
politico-subversive methods or there is a resumption of hostilities.

ANNEX 
VIOLATIONS OF  AGREEMENTS (JULY 1954) ON CESSATION OF 
HOSTILITIES IN INDOCHINA 
This Annex on the violations of the agreements on cessation of 
hostilities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia presents evidence of the pre-
meditated pattern of the numerous violations committed by the Communists. 
Pertinent examples were chosen from the compilation of violations in 
order to illustrate how a "cease-fire" is one of the instruments of Com-
munist policy. The main points of this Communist cease-fire policy are: 
1. Strengthening and regrouping of military forces - Articles 15, 
17 and paras. 4, 12, Joint Conference Declaration (Vietnam); 
Articles 4(c), 13(2), 15 and paras. 3, 4, 12, Joint Conference 
Declaration (Laos); paras. 3, 4, 12, Joint Conference Declara-
tion (Cambodia). 
2. Establishment of politico-subversive cadres or underground 
governments - Articles 14(a), 14(b), 15 (Vietnam); 4(c), 13(2) 
(Laos); Art. 4 (Cambodia). 
3. Creating an atmosphere of fear and terror by reprisals and 
impeding refugee travel - Articles 14(c), 14d and para. 8 
(Vietnam). 
4. Failure to exchange all prisoners of war and liberate political 
prisoners - Article 21. 
Art. 4 (Cambodia) deals with the withdrawal of the foreign 
armed forces and foreign military personnel from the 
territory of Cambodia. 
Official estimates at the time of the cease-fire agreement held that 
the number of Viet Minh regular and irregular forces in Cambodia totalled

,000. The Viet Minh, informed the International Control Commission that 
4,050 Viet Minh regulars were to be evacuated from Cambodia by 
October 19, 1954. Only about 2,700 regulars had been withdrawn. These 
evacuees carried a bare minimum of armament far below the actual 
strength of the units. The Viet Minh have intentionally left behind 
substantial cadres and arms depots for subversive purposes and future 
armed dissidence. 
In Battambang province the Viet Minh had announced an anticipated 
450 evacuees; only 250 materialized. 
The Khmer-Viet Minh forces in Cambodia were not disarmed by the Viet 
Minh by August 22, 1954, as specified in the cease-fire agreement. 
Arts. 4(c) and 13(2) (Laos) deal with the routes for with-
drawal of forces of the ...Vietnamese People's Volunteers in 
Laos from Laotian territory which are to be fixed on 
the spot by the Joint Commission. 
The Viet Minh have utilized secret withdrawal routes to avoid 
detection of abducted Laotian personnel. The specific charge against the 
Viet Minh, laid before the plenary session of the International Control 
Commission on September 29, 1954, was the use of secret routes in the 
transport of troops or transport of troops on stipulated routes without 
notification to the Commission of the exact time in order to avoid 
inspection.* 
*The intention of the Pathet Lao Communists in Laos) according to a 
captured Viet Minh document, is ostensibly to conform with the cease-fire 
agreement but actually to leave cells behind them as they withdraw; to 
take with them for training and indoctrination as many young Laotians 
as possible; and to build up the Pathet Lao with the intention of 
ultimately taking over the country.

Arts. 14(a) and (b) (Vietnam) state that the conduct of 
the civil administration in each regrouping zone shall 
be in the hands of the party whose forces are to be 
regrouped, and that after transfer and complete evacua-
tion of troops the other party shall assume responsibility. 
Provisional Assembly Areas. Most of the Viet Minh areas south of 
the 17th Parallel, i.e., the Provisional Assembly Areas of CA Mau, 
Xuyen Moe and Plains des Jones, have been technically evacuated by Viet 
Minh forces. Repeated and consistent reports reveal that Viet Minh 
military-political cadres continue to retain de facto control of the 
local administration and to conduct activities designed to maintain the 
population under Communist control. In the Plaine des Jones area alone, 
only an estimated 14,000 Viet Minh evacuees have been withdrawn from an 
announced quota of 200000. 
Arts. 14(c) (Vietnam), 15 (Laos), 6 (Cambodia), declare that 
each party undertakes to refrain from any reprisals or dis-
crimination against persons or organizations on account of 
their activities during the hostilities and to guarantee 
democratic liberties. 
The Vietnamese Government has formally charged that on July 31, 
1954, the Viet Minh assassinated Le Van Qui, non-commissioned officer 
of the regional militia (Bao Chinh Quan) at Ngo Duong Huyen de An -Duong 
(Kien An province), North Vietnam. Intellectuals and landowners were 
forced to wear military uniforms so their forced evacuation with Viet 
Minh troops will go undetected. 
The Vietnamese Government has charged that on August 21, 1954, three 
members of the Viet Minh, armed with rifles, attacked agents of the Hanoi 
Security Service near the Lang Pagoda. 
Refugees from the Red River delta asserted that some teachers who 
had chosen to stay within the Viet Minh zones and had declared their

loyalty to the Viet Minh had, nevertheless, been arrested and thrown into 
cages for public exhibition. A Viet Minh agent was carrying secret orders 
for the assassination of certain Vietnamese in the Phu Tien area prior to 
the withdrawal of the Viet Minh forces. The marked men were those believed 
to be strongly anti-Viet Minh and possibly aware that the Viet Minh was 
leaving behind cells and arms cadres. 
Art. 14(d) and Para. 8 of the Joint Conference Declaration 
(Vietnam) state that from the date of entry into force of the 
present Agreement until the movement of troops is completed, 
any civilians residing in a district controlled by one party 
who wish to go and live in the zone assigned to the other 
party shall be permitted and helped to do so by the authori-
ties in that district. 
During October, members of three regular infantry divisions and local 
regional forces were blocking, by force, the movement of refugees in the 
south zone of the delta. The Viet Minh has been preventing and continues 
to prevent evacuation of people from this area by: 
1. Intimidation and force. - Refugees encounter roadblocks where 
soldiers refuse them permission to pass, separate children from 
parents and arrest leaders of groups. Armed Viet Minh junks 
patrol the coastal waters to prevent escape by sea, and depart-
ing boats are fired upon. 
2. Barring refugees from transportation. - Almost all travel in 
the Tonkin Delta requires water transportation, but Viet Minh 
officials control passenger boats, ferry boats and bridges-and 
prevent their use by refugees. Trucks, busses, and bicycle 
carts are forbidden to carry refugees. 
3. Economic penalties. - A would-be refugee is not allowed to sell 
his property but must forfeit all except that which he can carry.

Public charges that the Viet hinh was obstructing the free movement 
of refugees from North Vietnam were set forth as early as September 250 
19541 when Premier Ngo Dinh Diem asserted that Viet Minh authorities were 
obstructing the departure of 200,000 Vietnamese from North Vietnam. 
The Vietnamese Government has charged that on August 18, 20, and 22, 
19541 members of the Viet Minh distributed tracts at Hanoi and Haiphong 
maligning the National Government of Vietnam and exhorting the population 
not to evacuate. 
Flagrant infraction of the Geneva Agreement occurred during late 
October and early Novelaber 1954 when, according to some press service 
estimates, from 20,000 to 40,000 Catholic and Buddhist refugees sought to 
flee the provinces of Nam Dinh and Thai Binh, North Vietnam in the face 
of a determined Viet hinh effort to thwart their departure. 
On October 30, 1954, representatives of the National Catholic Welfare 
Conference in Vietnam reported that "thousands" of Vietnamese desirous of 
leaving Viet hinh zones were forcibly being prevented from doing so. Viet 
Minh agents and militia, it was said, struggled physically with the refu-
gees; strangled an elderly Catholic to death; fired on boats of refugees 
as they pulled away from shore; patrolled the roads leading from the 
villages to the beach; forced the inhabitants of non-Christian villages 
to come out and grapple with departing refugees and to snatch babies 
from refugee mothers so as to force the mothers to remain; and attempted 
to prevent refugees from buying food so as 
villages from sheer hunger.

of the actual use of firearms. On the night of October 27, however, the 
Viet Minh machinegunned two sailing boats and wounded several refugees. 
French authorities reported at least four instances in which the Viet Minh 
had fired on refugees. (As evidence, the Haiphong team of the International 
Armistice Commission was reportedly confronted with the wounded refugees 
and two boats--one with bullet marks on its side and on one oar, the other 
with a bullet-pierced mast.) By November 3, 1954, the Viet Minh was said 
to have buttressed its internal efforts to prevent refugee departures 
with armed junks that patrolled the Bui Chu coast. Thus, a double barrier 
was erected before the fleeing refugees. 
On November 9, 1954, Western press services reported that some 4,000 
to 5,000 Catholic refugees had managed to reach on November 8 the sandbar 
island of Tra Ly, a few miles.orthe coast of Thai Binh province, where 
they were stranded and in danger of drowning at high tide. 
French efforts to rescue these refugees by sea were met immediately 
by strong Viet Minh protests. Their memorandum to the French High Command 
on November 10 termed French rescue efforts an "infringement upon the 
territorial sovereignty of the Vietnam Democratic Republic" and the 
French were warned that they would be held fully responsible "for eventual 
incidents if the above-mentioned acts of violation continue." A strong 
protest against the Viet hinhis attitude in this regard was lodged with 
the International Armistice Commission by the head of the French military 
mission in Hanoi on November 10, 1954; and despite Viet Minh and Polish 
attempts to delay an investigation of the situation, three mobile teams 
were dispatched by the Commission into the area of Nam Dinh and Phat Diem.

On November 13, 
reported that the Viet Midi con?
tinued to treat "intended" refugees with such violences that it was becoming 
an "international disgrace." "The Viet Minh have been using physical 
violence ranging from bludgeoning to gunfire." Regarding the activities 
of the International Armistice Commission's investigatory teams, 
reported that a request by the Commission to the Viet Minh for 
permission to allow French ships or trucks to evacuate refugees or at least 
to permit a mobile Commission team to go by French ship or helicopter to 
Tra Ly immediately, was refused. Instead, the Viet Minh is said to have 
offered to allow the Commission to go by road to the coast near Tra Ir 
after a 24?hour delay for "preparations." The Viet Minh threatened to 
fire on any ship or helicopter that approached the area. A Saigon press 
release stated that upon Commission intervention, the Viet Minh had agreed 
to permit French ships to enter its "territorial" waters if the Commission 
was given prior notice each time and if a member of the Commission was 
aboard the ship concerned. However, the existence of such an agreement was 
denied by the head of the French military mission in Vietnam who stated 
that the Viet Minh had thus far refused all such requests. 
The Viet Minh has assured the Commission that it would do nothing to 
prevent refugee departures. Yet, refugees in Haiphong continued to charge 
that they are being hampered by the Viet Minh in their efforts to reach 
areas in which the International Armistice Commission team is operating. 
It may be significant in this regard that the transportation of refugees 
from Phat Diem to the Haiphong permimeter where they were turned over to 
French authority was being carried out almost exclusively by water and in 
Viet Minh craft. Thus, the Viet Minh has the opportunity at least to

It has been ascertained that (1) during the period November 4-11) 
French ships picked up approximately 10,000 refugees from the Tonkin delta 
coast; (2) the International Armistice Commission teams dispatched to 
investigate the Catholic refugee situation have not been given full 
freedom of movement by the Viet Minh; (3) members of these teams were un-
able to ascertain the condition of the refugees stranded on the Tra Ly 
sandbar; and (4) the Viet Minh, with the aid of the Polish members of the 
Commission, have been dilatory and obstructionist to the detriment of the

Art. 17 (Vietnam) declares that the introduction into 
Vietnam of any reinforcements in the form of all types 
of arms, munitions and other war material is prohibited. 
The Joint Sino-Soviet-DRV Supply and Service Command in Nanning, 
China, has moved large quantities of prohibited war material such as 
heavy artillery and Soviet rocket launchers to North Vietnam. Since the 
cease-fire, artillery, including 105 mm. cannon, was sent across the Sino-
Vietnamese border. Material received since the Armistice represents a 
substantial increase in the inventory of Viet Minh artillery pieces, bazookas 
and mortars. New items in Viet Minh hands include tanks and 88 mm. anti-
aircraft weapons. Aside from these, military-type aircraft have boon 
sighted at Hanoi. 
The Viet Minh Regular Forces have been expanded. Reorganization of 
their forces indicates that up to nine new division have been or are now 
being formed, including three artillery divisions and six infantry divisions. 
These increases are the result of transfers from regional and popular forces. 
In addition, support elements of existing units are being augmented to 
include a larger proportion of organic artillery, heavy mortar, and 
recoilless gun components at divisonal and regimental level. The expansion 
and reinforcement of unit firepower was made possible by continuing large 
shipments of Chinese Communist supplies.

Officials in Saigon have estimated that at the end of hostilities, 
55,000 members of the French Union forces were unaccounted for. Of this 
number 25:000 were of Vietnamese nationality. By September 44 1954, 
the Viet Minh claimed to have returned 11,882 prisoners (537 officers 
and 11,345 other military personnel), of whom 8,082 were of European or 
African origin, 5 of U.S. origin and 3,795 of Vietnamese origin. The 
French Union High Command, however, claimed that only 11,706 were released. 
The Viet Minh returned only 3:795 of the Vietnamese Army personnel 
captured by them during the war. Although some of the men not officially 
returned are either still interned as "politically-dangerous" or have been 
clandestinely released after indoctrination, the major portion have been 
removed from the category of prisoners of war and integrated into the Viet 
Minh forces. 
The presence of a camp near Nom Dau holding French Union prisoners 
has been reported. The Viet Minh, however, claimed that these POW's are 
French Expeditionary Corps deserters who have rallied to its side. 
Hundreds of Legionnaires and North Africans have returned to Europe and 
North Africa via Communist China and the Soviet Union. This method of 
releasing European POW's to their home country is a prominent aspect of 
Viet Minh POW policies. 
Another favorite Communist practice is to sentence large numbers of 
prisoners of war as war criminals.

As early as August 27, 1954, the Laotian Government protested to the 
Joint Armistice Commission for Laos that Viet Minh units in Laos were 
forcing young men in the villages to join Viet Minh forces and move to 
northern Laos for military training. 
Official Laos reports on October 17, 1954, asserted that through 
threats, intimidation and false promises, the Viet Minh had forcibly taken 
away between 4,000 and 5,000 persons. 
On January 31, 1955, Viet Minh elements crossed the Lan border into 
Laos to reinforce the Pathet Lao (Communist). 
In addition to the above violations of which only certain examples 
are listed, there have been violations of Articles 10, 11 and 15c (Attacks 
Against Vietnamese Army and Militia Units) violations of Articles 1, 2a, 
4d and 19 (Attacks Against Laos National Army Units); violations of 
Articles 2 and 4(4) (Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia); and violation 
of Article 5 (Demobilization of Khmer Resistance Forces).

COMMUNIST DETENTION AND IMPRISONMENT OF UNITED NATIONS PERSONNEL 
2,215. 
On November 24, 1954, the Chinese Communists announced over the Peiping 
Radio that a Chinese military tribunal had imposed long prison sentences 
on 11 American flyers and two other U.S. citizens who were in the employ 
of the U.S. Army. 
The announcement concerning the 13 Americans had far deeper significance 
than was realized by the Western World. It calls for a reappraisal of Com-
munist motives in detaining and utilizing prisoners of war and a re-
appraisal of Communist law and legal proceedings as interpreted by their 
nadministrators." 
Policy of Detention and Exploitation 
Since the cease-fire in Korea the United Nations Command has asked for 
South 
an accounting of 470 United States and 21410/Korean prisoners of war known 
to have been in Communist hands. In addition, 15 United States fliers are 
held in China; 41 United States civilians are being held by the Communists. 
Information recently available has revealed that U.S. prisoners were taken 
to Siberia in late 1951 and 1952. U.S. prisoners were observed during this 
period at Man Chou Li, which is the transfer point on the border of Manchuria 
and the USSR. Two trainloads of prisoners were transferred from Chinese 
trains to Soviet trains on the Siberian side of the border. Among the 
prisoners were large numbers of Negro troops. 
The calloused and inhuman policy of the Communists, Soviet and Chinese, 
toward prisoners of war in Korea resulted in the disappearance of 65,000 
men of the United Nations Command. Of this number, 11,600 were victims

Approved For Release 2006/08/30: CIA-RDP85S00362R000600140001-9 
of war crimes. During the truce negotiations the UN Command asked the 
Communists for an accounting of 53,000 Republic of Korea soldiers captured 
by the Communists. The Communists claimed they had been "released at the 
front." Since that time thousands of these soldiers have escaped to South 
Korea and have revealed that the term "released at the front" is a cover 
phrase employed by the Communists to hide forcible impressment into their 
armies or in prisoner-of-war slave labor battalions. 
The utilization of these prisoners falls into two chief categories--
one for the soldiers of the Republic of Korea, the other for those of the 
United States and other countries of the United Nations Command. 
1. The Republic of Korea. 
a. Forced impressment into the North Korean Armed Forces. 
b. Impressment into labor battalions in support of the Com-
munist war effort and international goals. 
c. Training for espionage, sabotage or other subversive 
activities. 
d. Purposes of propaganda. 
2. U.S. and other UN countries. 
a. Selected prisoners of war for propaganda work (some of those 
in the Soviet Union will be used as radio announcers of which 
there is a shortage in the USSR). 
b. Converted prisoners of war, screened by the Soviets, will be 
trained to be illegal residents in the U.S. or other countries 
where they can live as Americans. 
c. The identies and biographies of dead or even living prisoners 
of war will be used in preparing legends for Soviet agents.

Those prisoners of war who are found to be unsuitable will rarely be 
released because they will have learned too much about Soviet handling 
techniques and the Soviets would be condemned for withholding UN prisoners 
captured in Korea. 
History 
The exploitation of prisoners of war by the Communists is not new. 
It is an important aspect of their struggle for world domination in which 
they use every illegal and even legal opportunity to further their own 
ends. Enormous economic, military, and propaganda advantages were and are 
drawn by the Soviets in using these men. 
In the Korean War the same policy of exploitation was put into effect 
by the Chinese Communists under the supervision of the Soviets. This time 
it included all countries under United Nations Command, 
The Soviet advisory system which in Korea exerted direct control 
over all important policy-malang departments, extended to matters dealing 
with prisoners of war. This resulted in a control-system in prison-of-war 
camps in North Korea dominated at the top levels by Soviet officers. 
Current Detention - Prison Sentences. 
The events behind the current detention of the 11 U.S. fliers and 
2 U.S. Army civilians, as broadcast by the Peiping Radio, are a matter of 
record. The fliers, officers and crew of a B-29, flying a United Nations 
leaflet dropping mission, were shot down on January 12, 1953 over North 
Korea. It was not the only plane shot down by the Chinese Communists, but 
it happened to carry a sufficient number of high-ranking officers to 
supply propaganda material for the mock trial that had been taking place--
a type of trial with which the world is now, unhappily, only too familiar.

The detention and illegal use of prisoners of war is deliberate Soviet 
policy. Long standard Components of the Communist overall strategy, 
they are insidiously planned to achieve a far-reaching goal. The Soviets 
have successfully instructed the Chinese, North Korean and Viet Minh 
Communists in their own techniques of exploiting prisoners of war for 
political, psychological and subversive reasons. Having learned their 
lessons well, the Chinese Communists then claimed that all United Nations 
prisoners taking part in the "unjust war" were war criminals. The Chinese 
told the captured soldiers that they of the United Nations Command had been 
duped and misled by their reactionary rulers and that therefore certain 
prisoners should not be executed but would be given the opportunity to 
repent for their crimes. 
In light of this policy, the sentencing of the U.S. airmen and 
civilians did not come as a surprise. The move was a premeditated propaganda 
move, planned as far back as July 3, 1952. Neither were the actual sentences 
resulting from the trials in doubt. The question was purely one of proper 
timing for political expediency. 
On July 3, 1952, six months before the plane containing the sentenced 
crew was shot down, another RB -29 photo-reconnaissance aircraft was shot down 
over North Korea. On January 25, 1953, the crew under the command of 
Lt. Theodore R. Harris was taken to Mukden, Manchuria. For more than 
8 months, Lt. Harris and his crew were subjected to every device known to 
the Chinese from moral pressure to extreme physical torture. Following this 
a mock trial was held in Mukden which clearly showed the Communists, disregard 
for all rules and regulations of justice as known to the Western world. To 
quote some of Lt. Harris' own words:

"I remained in this cell Tproximately 6 weeks. During this 
period I was brought almost daily before what was explained to me 
as a 'military court' to sit in judgment of my case. I repeatedly 
asked by what authority I was held by the Chinese People's military, 
and by what authority I had been removed from Korea. I never received 
any answer or reason. On one occasion I asked that if this were a 
court and I was being tried, why was I denied counsel. I did not 
receive a satisfactory reply. 
"Throughout the course of this so-called trial whenever I 
attempted to speak out in my own behalf or to refute any of the 
questions or charges, the officer-in-charge would fly into a rage 
and in most cases would break off the proceedings. During much 
of this mock trial I was forced to stand at rigid attention while 
the questions were asked. Most of the questions asked during this 
trial were irrelevant, but there was emphasis on the bacteriological 
warfare charges, espionage, psychological warfare, and violation 
of the sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China. Con-
siderable emphasis was given the charge that I had repeatedly violated 
the sovereign territory of the Soviet Union. I was told that I had 
to confess and if I confessed, the Chinese People's Republic would 
forgive me and thereafter treat me as a prisoner-of-war instead of 
a war criminal." 
On January 12, 1953, a B-29 carrying Col. John K. Arnold was shot 
captains 
down over North Korea. In the aircraft wore a full colonel, a major, two/ 
and two lieutenants. The Harris crew was returned to Korea and later re-
patriated while the Arnold crew was taken to China. The higher ranking 
officers--and the crew--of the Arnold plane were better fodder for the 
propaganda trials than were the staff of the Harris plane. 
Soviet-Chinese "LeFal" ProstqAma. 
The Soviet textbook on international law, published by the Institute 
of Law of the Academy of Science of the USSR (Moscow 1951), contains a 
section on "Scouts and Spies" which reads: "A serviceman in uniform who 
penetrates into enemy lines and the rear of the enemy cannot be considered 
a spy." This section is international window-dressing, torWilenever it 
suits their purposes) the Soviets disregard their own textbook promulgations.

The Chinese Communists have followed in the footsteps of the 
Soviets. The 11 U.S. fliers and 2 civilians were "convicted" by the 
so-called Military Tribunal of the "Supreme People's Court of the People's 
Republic of China." The chief judge was Chia Chien, a committee member 
of the "Supreme People's Court." The defendants were prosecuted by 
Yao Lun Military Procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of 
the People's Republic of China." 
The above Soviet type of "court" and "procuratorate", sham and 
political in nature, has become standard with the Chinese Communists 
and is used to give sOMB semblance of legality to whatever strategy they 
are about to implement. Most criminal of these facades-of-justice 
operations were those conducted by the Communist regime during 1950-54 
when some 20,000,000 Chinese were slaughtered in 7 gigantic terror cam-
paigns. 
These political courts and the judicial officers concerned with 
carrying out the policies and programs of the Peiping regime, used the 
judiciary as an instrument of oppression. In all civil and criminal 
cases, the judge is guided by the orders and directives of the Communist 
regime and the decisions of earlier Communist trials, unless some policy, 
recently changed, makes it expedient to render a different decision. 
These decisions are handed down by the political and legal committee 
under the State Administration Council which is the policy-making 
organization in the Peiping regime for all judicial matters.

Propaganda Tie-In 
Well timed with the Peiping radio farce was the release of John 
Helmouth Noble and two other U.S. civilians from the Soviet Ilion. Ob-
viously the Communist brethArn were attempting to create an impression of 
magnanimity in order to make the free world believe that they were not in-
transigent in their dealings with prisoners of war. The conclusion, they 
hoped, would be that the 11 fliers were genuine spies. Dy releasing the 
three Americans, the Communists also hoped to further a number of their 
political and propaganda maneuvers: the embarrassment of the United States; 
the Red Chinese claim to Formosa; the justification of the entry of Red 
China into the United Nations; diversion of attention from their subversive 
moves in Southeast Asia. 
To recapitulate?the exploitation of prisoners of war is a regular 
component of Communist policy. Until such a time as the United States and 
the United Nations destroy the usefulness of "prisoners of war" as a Com-
munist weapon, the Comlaunists will continue to utilize them to further 
their far-reaching objective of world domination.
