SUBJECT: Free Information re USSR 
STAT 
e 114 STAT 
Attached is a copy of an article given to me by 
Mr. Douglass, one of the authors. Joe sent me this 
copy after he told me that no one seemed to be 
interested in the subject. That response came to my 
question: What's new and exciting? Joe did say that 
OGI had talked to him about this subject, but that 
contact apparently withered. 
In any case, I am sending this copy to you 
because Joe made the point to me that the Soviets are 
using drugs as a means of influencing people. It 
appears to have some obvious counterintelligence 
ramifications, to whatever degree this is so. I 
leave all of that to you. 
I mentioned this to 
;he other day.

ince 198Z U.S. law enforcement officials have ac-
quired considerable evidence implicating Cuba and 
other communist nations in international drug traf-
ficking. 
Former Cuban intelligence (DCI) agents have 
testified that the DCI runs drugs into the United States and uses its 
agents as drug pushers in the United States. As needed, the DCI is 
assisted in this business by other Cuban officials such as military 
officials and diplomats. DCI officials have directed their agents to 
load up the United States with drugs." 
Former Nicaraguan officials have described how Cuban Gen. 
Raiil Castro, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and 
second secretary of the Cuban politburo, encouraged and assisted 
Nicaragua to join the drug trafficking business. Former diplomats 
and intelligence officials who have fled Nicaragua  to seek asylum in 
the United States have testified that the drug business is an official 
government operation run by Nicaraguan intelligence, which in 
turn is controlled by Cuban and Soviet advisers. 
Drug dealers and operators-turned-informers have provided 
elaborate detail on Cuban and Nicaraguan production, transship-
ment and distribution, mainly directed against the United States and 
increasingly against Europe. Both Cuba and Nicaragua have been 
linked to numerous Latin American terrorist organizations, pre-
dominately pro-Soviet, providing them guns in exchange for drugs 
that are then delivered to the United States, all of which are con-
trolled by the Soviet intelligence services, and organizing "safe 
havens" for drug traffickers en route to the United States. 
Numerous sources have also tied Bulgarian intelligence and 
other East European intelligence services to drug trafficking against 
both US. and NATO forces and against all the NATO nations, begin-
ning with the United States. 
The objectives of these intertwined drug trafficking operations, 
as stated by many independent sources, especially former high-level 
officials, are to use drugs as a political weapon against the United 
States. Money is an important incentive, they explain, but the real 
motivation is political, and the main target is the US. youth 
The most recent statement is that of the former Nicaraguan 
minister-counselor, Antonio Fara& He explainedhow the 
Nicaraguan officials justified their drug business. In the first place, 
drugs did not remain in Nicaragua. The drugs were destined for the 
United States, the youth of our enemy. Therefore, the drugs were 
used as a political weapon because in that way we were delivering a 
blow to our principal enemy." 
Carlos Lehder Rivas, the Cuban-supported Colombian drug 
kingpin, in an interview in 1985 on Colombian television an-
nounced, "He who plants coca denounces imperialism," and 
"Cocaine is the Latin American atomic bomb." 
The Politics of Drugs 
Unfortunately, the political side of drug trafficking?perhaps 
its most important dimension?somehow seems to get lost. Atten-
tion is focused on the domestic side of the problem. Few people ask 
how the problem arose and why it has become so severe in the past 
three decades. Most people simply assume the lure of high profits

operation, the Cubans were to collect information on the corruption 
that accompanies the drug trade. Obtaining such information was 
also one of the main reasons for infiltrating the drug networks. The 
information would be used to covertly coordinate drug operations 
and enable the Soviets ultimately to exercise strategic control over 
presumably independent drug operations. Additionally, the infor-

mation would be used to blackmail and recruit a near-inexhaustible 
supply of both willing and unwitting Soviet agents of influence 
throughout the Americas for strategic operations. The implications 
of this often-overlooked dimension of the drug trafficking business, 
in the long run, may be even more serious than the societal and 
economic disruptions caused by drug pushing itself. 
The operation to infiltrate and collect data on corruption was 
organized in Cuba in 1962 during the Second Havana Conference. 
During the conference, Cuban and Czech intelligence held a secret 
meeting of Soviet and Soviet-trained intelligence agents who were 
members of the various Latin American organizations attending the 
conference. The meeting served to coordinate plans for sabotage 
and other strategic intelligence operations throughout the Western 
Hemisphere, including the infiltration of existing drug and narcotics 
production and distribution networks and the collection of 
incriminating information on corruption. 
Later, in the fall of that year, Khrushchev called the top Warsaw 
Pact leaders to a secret meeting in Moscow. Attending the meeting 
were the first secretaries, premier ministers, ministers of defense 
and their key staff, roughly 15 officials from each country. Jan Sejna 
attended as part of the Czech delegation. The meeting was called to 
discuss negative economic tendencies and corrective measures. 
Midway through the meeting, Khrushchev turned to the subject of 
drugs. Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese were smart, he said, and he 
praised their imagination and operativeness. But, he continued, the 
Warsaw Pact intelligence services were more well developed and 
better organized and should step in and exploit the drug oppor-
tunities as fast as possible. 
Khrushchev carefully explained how the business would crip-
ple the democratic societies while simultaneously generating much-
needed foreign exchange for intelligence operations. It would 
undermine the health and morale of U.S. soldiers and weaken the 
hunian factor in the defense situation, he said. Further, it would crip-
ple the educational system. US. schools were high-priority targets 
because this is where the future leaders of the bourgeois were to be 
found. Another high-priority target Khrushchev identified was the 
US. work ethic, pride and loyalty. Finally, drugs and narcotics 
would lessen the influence of religions and, he added, under certain 
concfitions, could be used to create chaos. 
Sejna's recollection of Khrushchev's remarks remains clear, 
especially his dosing words. "When we discuss this strategy,' 
Khrushchev said, "there were some who were concerned that this 
operation might be immoraL But we must state categorically," he 
then emphasized, "that anything that speeds the destruction of 
capitalism is moral." 
Later in the day at an informal gathering of the Pact officials, 
Khrushchev talked further about the importance of the drug busi-
ness with the Czech delegation. This was when Sejna learned the 
code name of the operation. Khrushchev grinned, nudged Sejna i 
the ribs and told him the name of the operation was Druzba Naroba 
that is, "National Friendship." The name was pure Kluoshchev-
dever deception but with a clear and obvious meaning: the drug 
were friends that would help destroy the enemy. 
Following this meeting, the satellite leaders returned home an 
began to organize the narcotics trafficking, Initially, the most activ 
countries, besides the Soviet Union, were Czechoslovakia, Bulgari 
and Hungary. Within roughly two years, East Germany and Polar 
were also strong participants. 
Tightest Security 
In the case of Czechoslovakia, the operations plan via 
immediately developed under the tightest security. Nir 
individuals who were to put the plan together were sequestered i 
an MOD villa for a week They came from the Administratis 
Organs Department, International (Foreign) Department, Militar 
Health Administration, GRU (strategic intelligence) and Ministry' 
Interior (Second Administration). When completed, the plan Iva 
presented to the Defense Council by the minister of interior, Rudo 
Barak At that meeting, in response to a question on finances froi 
the first secretary, he estimated that the operation would bring i 
enough revenues to pay for the entire Czech military intelligent 
operation. Actually, in 1964, the operation paid for 50 percent of th 
GRU foreign operations expenses (not including salaries c 
operations financed by the Soviets). This grew to .70 percent (c 
about $22 million) in 1966, and at that time, the GRU profit (after a 
expenses were paid) from just the Cuban portion of the operatic 
totaled about $8 million. Further, in 1966, the GRU estimated that b 
1968 the total income from narcotics trafficking would cover a 
foreign GRU expenses. 
Throughout the satellites and the Soviet Union, the drug bus 
ness was accorded the highest secrecy classification, that of "stat 
importance," which is above the level of top secret Documentatio 
was extremely guarded. In Czechoslovakia, there were only thre 
copies of the Defense Council's decision and approved plan. The 
copies were held in the Second Administration of the Ministry c 
Interior (the civilian secret police), the GRU and the Defense Cour 
cil Secretariat All instructions to the heads of participating agenda 
were oral, and most people working on the various facets of th 
operation were given deceptive explanations for what they wei 
doing so that even they were unaware of the basic plan. Aside froi 
the Defense Council itself, very few people, even among the to 
leadership, were aware of operation Dnaba Naroboa.

The instructions from the Soviet Defense Council following i 
approval of Savinkin's plan dealt with a wide variety of matter 
including 1) which banks in different countries were to be used t

European intelligence services in assisting in the infiltration of Lati 
American drug networks and in the collection of corruption data, :

for the West's narcotics problem. Moreover, organizations and 
individuals considered inimical to Soviet policy were to be dis-
credited (for example, by revealing their internal drug-related cor-
ruption). Finally, following special instructions received from First 
Secretary Leonid Brezhnev in 1964, the satellites were to publicize 
the Chinese narcotics operation and, by so doing, distract the 
world's attention away from the Soviet operation. 
During the Vietnam War, the Soviets and Czechs negotiated an 
agreement with the North Vietnamese to produce narcotics in North 
Vietnam. This was part of a practice begun in roughly 1963 to pro-
duce the drugs locally, in the vicinity of the target audience, rather 
than ship them in from Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union. In the 
case of the Vietnam War, the products were shipped through 
Thailand and via the Viet Cong to the U.S. forces in the south. By 
1967, the Soviet intelligence services estimated that the use of drugs 
against the U.S. soldiers had become even more effective than it had 
been in the Korean War. At that time, the KGB estimated that 90 per-
cent of the U.S. servicemen were using drugs of one variety or 
another. Seeking to capitalize on this situation and on the antiwar 
movement of the youth in the United States, which itself was also 
fueled by Soviet propaganda and deception operations, hi the spring 
of 1967, Savinkin stressed to a visiting delegation of high-level 
Czech officials the need to increase the drug trade, specifically 
against U.S. and NATO forces to "corrupt the officers, recruit 
Intelligence agents and impair the functioning of soldiers.' 
In January 1967, the Soviets finished a study that concluded 
that the drugs would be an effective weapon to use against a new ris-
ftig class in the United States. the "technical elite." Drugs and nar-
cotics were to be used to sabotage this important class and to 
faalitate the Soviet theft of high-tech equipment At the end of 1967, 
during a special display of stolen technology, the chief of Czech 
military intelligence explained to visiting Soviet officials that, by his 
estimate, 20.to 25 percent of the technology stolen from the West 
during 1967 was facilitated by the use of drugs. 
In a sense, 1967 was another watershed year in the Soviet 
operation, the first being 1960 and the second, 1962. In 1967, the 
Soviets directed the further intensification of the narcotics 
operations?in Cuba and throughout Latin America, in technology 
theft operations and against the US. and NATO military forces. And, 
in the fall, Moscow again summoned all the satellite intelligence 
chiefs to a meeting to receive instructions to speed the exploitation 
of the many opportunities that had become available. 
By the end of 1967, Cuba had infiltrated 90 percent of all the 
Latin American drug operanons, aria GISCLISSIOTIS WIM maul Castn

Folly to Close Our Eyes 
Over the past 15 years, international narcotics trafficking ha! 
multiplied manyfokL It now has solid roots in all Latin Arnericar 
countries. It has corrupted countless Latin American officials. anc 
one must assume many in the United States as well. It has led to thE 
brutal torture and murder of US. Drug Enforcement Agency agent 
and to the ruthless killing of public officials who have attempted tx 
resist the drug dealers, most notably the 24 ministers of justice ix 
Colombia. It has become married to international terrorism, whose 
links to the Soviet Union the US. government also remains reluctani 
to confront This, on top of the magnitude of the domestic problems 
is why fighting the drug business has become so important 
At the same time, it seems only reasonable not to mislead thc 
public about the prospects for success in this war. That is, it may bc 
quite difficult to combat the drug and narcotics problem effectively i 
the role of the Soviet Union?its strategy, plans, tactics inc 
organization?is not taken into account The combination of West 
ern industrial and financial interests, coupled with an overwheiminf 
desire to reach nuclear arms control agreements with the Soviets 
has generated considerable pressure for the United States to wok 
actions or words that might be considered confrontational or anti 
Soviet 
Evidence relating to Soviet (and Chinese) actions has beer 
ignored, often not collected or actively pursued and, in certain cases 
possibly even suppressed. The problem is not a lack of evidence, a! 
many bureaucrats would have congress and the public believe 
Rather, the problem is a failure to assemble and analyze avabatir( 
evidence. The foregoing material is presented as an example o 
evidence that is available but not pursued. Moreover, this is only thf 
tip of the iceberg. 
The apparent disinclination to collect, assemble and analyzc 
available evidence has resulted in a perception of the drug arid nar 
cotics problem that does not include what may be a critical dimen-
sion of the problem: the Soviet operation that coordinates its mart) 
resources in using drugs and narcotics as a political weapon to alp 
pie Western societies. The drugs are political weapons. In the 1960s 
the communists implemented a plan to coordinate resources inc 
use the weapon to its greatest effectiveness. The main target was thf 
United States. There is no reason to our knowledge to believe this 
no longer the case. 
Until this possibility is recognized and seriously examined 
which is not happening now, the war on drugs is not being take: 
seriously by those responsible for carrying it out, and the prospect 
for success in the war are significantly diminished..
