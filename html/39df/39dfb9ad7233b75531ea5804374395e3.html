 INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 This study is of the Soviet military threat to China a., the Chinese
 see it-in terms of both Soviet capabilities and Sovi'::; intentions.
 The study is concerned with the Chinese view of:
 - the i ,_)ssibility of an escalation of the Sino-Sovi,.k border con-
 flict, a conflict provoked originally by the Chiw';;e themselves;
 and
 - the possibility of a Scat decision to launc1:. A massive con-
 ventional attack or a disarming nuclear strikr: for larger stra-
 tegic reasons, i.e., to dispose of an inrransigendy hostile poten-
 tial superpc wcr.
 Western obscr"ers-in:,ide and outside the intelligence commu-
 nity-have reached very different conclusions about the chances of
 a Soviet military attack on China, whether growing out of the border
 conflict or deriving from Soviet assessments of '1e overall strategic
 situation. We have thought that the statement,: and actions of the
 Chinese themselves, as the most interested parties, might be illumi-
 nating.
 The Chinese have given to various audio' ices at various times
 very different assessments of the prospects , ;' Soviet attack-in a
 range from alarmist to complacent-so that it !' as been necessary to
 evaluate these statements in the context of Chinese actions of the
 time. We have reviewed all available Chinese statements on this
 matter, and we have tried to distinguish between statements that
 seemed to represent genuine assessments-i.e., were consonant with
 Chinese actions-and those that seemed to be made for a variety of
 political purposes.
 Our analysis centers on the former: the Chinese assessment of
 the degree of danger of a Soviet attack at well-marked points in the
 evolution of the Sino-Soviet relationship. We attempt to reach sharper
 conclusions than the well-known and generally-accepted one that the
 Chinese for the past decade have felt threatened by the Soviet Union.

 The effort here is to track the genuine Chinese assessment as it
 has changed at different times to determine:
 -- whether the Chinese have over truly feared that a Soviet
 attack, however originating, might be imminent;
 - if so, what political and m',.litary measures they took at that
 time to reduce the prospect of an attack;
 - whether their assessments of the prospect of attack, however
 originating, have shown a long-term pattern of change, a con-
 sistently rising or declining curve;
 - and what their view of the Soviet military threat is today, and
 what they are doing about it.
 The Chinese view of the threat from the border dispute-which
 is just one p in of a Sino-Sovict conflict across the board-depends
 upon Peking's assessment as to whether it can keep alive Mao Tse-tung's
 claims to Soviet border areas which have never been under Chinese
 Communist jurisdiction, and to establish Chinese presence in these
 areas, without seriously risking a large-scale Soviet military attack.
 The central questions in the Chinese assessment of the prospect of
 a Soviet strategic attack on China as a whole are whether the Chinese
 feel that the Russians are seriously tempted to make such an attack,
 and, if so, whether the Chinese calculate that they can persuade
 Moscow that this could not be done at acceptable political and military
 cost.

 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 In their patrolling of the Sino-Soviet border during the early and
 mid-1960s, Chinese leaders were not frightened by Soviet threats.
 It was not until 1969, following the Chinese ambush of Soviet border
 guards, that the Chinese came to believe that a major Soviet attack on
 China might be imminent.
 The one Chinese fright-in August and September 1969-derived
 partly from localized Soviet military action but mainly from Soviet
 threats of larger actions which were credible to the Chinese, causing
 them to conclude that their policy of the time--of asserting territorial
 claims by aggressive forward patrolling on the border-was more
 dangerous than they had estimated. Mao backed off from a confronta-
 tion; he decided to avoid additional provocation by halting the patrols,
 and he agreed to resume negotiations with the Soviets.
 The hard line taken by the Chinese in the negotiations, however-
 refusing, to make any concessions and insisting on a withdrawal of
 Soviet forces from Chinese-claimed areas before substantive discus-
 sions could begin-showed that fear that a Soviet attack might be
 imminent dropped off sharply once the talks had begun.
 Because the Chinese since 1969 have avoided provoking the
 Soviets at the border, they have not needed to fear an escalation as
 much. The pai tern seems to show a steadily declining curve.
 Neverth6ess, beyond the question of border provocations, the
 Chinese have remained concerned about the continuing strategic
 military threat. Here too the pattern has been one of declining con-
 cern, but in the nature of the case the concern cannot be eliminated.
 The Chinese have taken various raeasures, military and political,
 to reduce the danger of a possible Soviet attack. They have continued
 to improve their defenses against ground attack, and to develop their
 own nuclear forces as a sobering if modest deterrent. Also to serve the
 interest of deterrence, they have at times magnified and at times down-
 played Soviet military capabilities and intentions. This has put the
 Chinese in the somewhat absurd position of arguing, in one period,
 that China was greatly threatened (regi.;iring W'stern pressure on
 Moscow to desist), and, more lately, that China is not so threatened

 but that the West is (Sc) that NATO forces should not be reduced).
 While the arguments adduced for a tough Western military posture
 toward the USSR have changed, the results desired have not.
 The Chinese view today is short of fear, but also short of com-
 placence. They are therefore continuing to develop their military
 strength and to encourage a strong Western strategic disposition
 against the Soviets-a NATO-Warsaw Pact confrontation-which will
 reduce both the short-term and the long-term threat to China.
 After Mao's death, some Chinese leaders will probably actively
 argue that Peking should seek a border settlement on reasonable
 terms (which the Chinese have not done to date), again seeking to
 reduce both the short-term and the long-term threat. In the meantime,
 even the Mao-dominated leadership will probably avoid direct physical
 provocation on the border.
 Peking can be expected to maintain that China will retaliate if
 attacked, while emphasizing that China's military posture is defensive
 (as it is). At the same time, the Chinese will probably try to sustain
 and strengthen the Sino-American rapprochement as a stronger long-
 term deterrent to Soviet attack than China itself can provide. But
 because the Chinese intend to win Tai' :tn, they will seek to persuade
 the US that China does not need such rapprochement at the cost of a
 halt in US disengagement from Taipei. Should it come to a choice,
 the value to Peking of rapprochement, against the Soviet threat, would
 probably prove greater than that of early annexation of Taiwan.
 In sum, the Chinese probably conclude that:
 (1) They can avoid an escalation of the border conflict
 simply by avoiding provocation;
 (2) In the immediate post-Mao situation, the Soviets, rather
 than intervening militarily in China, are likely to wait for the
 post-Mao leadership to make or respond to initiatives for an
 improvement in relations; and
 (3) Even failing an early improvement, the Soviets would be
 unlikely to choose to accept the political and military costs of a
 strategic attack on China, but would probably continue to wait
 (as they could well afford to wait), hoping for better from some
 successor Chinese leadership.

 THE DISCUSSION
 THE SOVIET ALLY BECOMES A MILITARY
 OPPONENT: 196;,-1969
 Chinese pence :tit;n of the Soviets its an enemy
 was an incremental, not it sadden development.
 After the outbreak of the Siuo-Soviet dispute into
 public polemics in if93), it was three years before
 the Oi;incse leaders came to view the Russians
 seriously as - potential military adversary. Chinese.
 stratcg:,: thina?:ng in the early 1900s had envisaged
 possible attacks from US-supported Nationalist
 forces in the cast (across the Taiwan Strait) and
 Indian forces in the southwest, but had given li!tle
 attention to the possib; "ity of Scvict initiated hos-
 tilities on the northern                    until
 mid-1963.               when
 the Chinese began to build a string of border de-
 fense stations in the northeast
 it was primarily for tit(! purpose
 of preventing refugees from crossing into Soviet
 territory and secondarily for the purpose of keeping
 Soviet agents out. Even when, in the spring of 1963,
 the main mission of these troops hccame that of
 disputing  Soviet-controlled  territory  (primarily
 islands in the two border rivers, the Amur and the
 Usstiri), no shooting occurred and the Chinese
 seemed to feel that the only military confrontation
 they had to worry about was pushing-and-shoving
 engagements at the border between border guard
 patrols. However, by the summer of 1963, both
 sides increased the number of troops near the
 border.
 A. First Chinese Perception of a Soviet
 Military Threat: 1963
 Khrushchev, annoyed by Mao's new policy of
 trying to dispute Soviet-held border territory, issued
 at first oblique and thee direct warnings that assert-
 ing claims by aggressive patrolling might trigger
 a major Soviet military res onse.

 10n   August,
 the Peking People's Daily reflected the Chinese
 assessment that it serious threat existed; for the
 first time the Party paper complained of it "US-
 Soviet alliance against China." F_                                                   _1
 However, it is unlikely that the
 Chinese had suddenly come to fear that a major
 Soviet attack, conventional or nuclear, was it ncar-
 term possibility. The, Sino-Soviet agreement to start
 border talks in February 1964 did not result from
 Soviet pressures; it was a development which the
 Chinese had set in motion in 1903 before the
 Soviets had made their threatening statements.
 Khrushchev's position during the negotiations
 was to refuse to withdraw Soviet forces f-om areas
 held by the Soviets well before Mao's regime had
 been established in 1949, but to make an exception
 of certain small islands in the border rivers. Mao
 wanted, by contrast:, - Soviet political capitulation:
 a declaration that the treaties between the tsars
 and Imperial China had been "unequal." Ile also
 wanted the big, river island opiosite Khabarovsk.
 Mao could not be mollified; he broke the secrecy
 of the talks by making a public statement on 10
 July 1964, and he taunted Khrushchev by declaring
 that he would continue the Sino-Soviet dispute
 with impunity-free from the danger of Soviet
 attack.
 Regarding w,:r on paper, there are no dead in such
 n war. We have been waging such a war for several
 years already, and not a single person has died.
 We are prepated to wage this war another 25 years.
 Mao statement of 10 July, printed in Tokyo Shekai
 Slmho on 11 August 1964.)
 Khrushchev was convinced by this Chinese resort
 to public maneuver and by the course of the secret
 talks that it was useless to continue to negotiate
 with Mao. lIe withdrew the Soviet delegation on
 15 August. In the strongest public threat to use
 nuclear weapons against China ever made by

 Khrushchev, lie warned that it would be "dangerous"
 to encroach on Soviet borders "given up-to-date
 weapons of annihilation" ill tlu Soviet arsenal
 (speech of 15 September 1964), His policy was
 thns now to "rattle" nuclear weapons toward China,
 its lie had done in the past to unary other countries.
 However, Mao and his lieutenants were able,
 given this clearly marked pattern of Khrushchev's
 behavior, to distinguish a bluff front it real threat
 of Imminent attack. Chinese perception of the
 credibility of a Soviet threat was highly context-
 dependent, keyed to the positioning of Soviet
 forces. Khrushchev had failed to frighten the Chi-
 ties(, into ceasing their border probes because he
 had not made his threats sufficiently credible,
 either by deploying tactical nuclear weapons or
 by a big conventional buildup of regular forces
 on the frontier.
 By contrast, the post-Khrushchev Soviet leader-
 ship avoided threatening China with a nuclear
 strike (until 1969). The Soviet leaders were willing,
 however, to make moves -.vhich were more costly
 in terms of committing military manpower and
 resources to the border area.
 The Chinese were aware of the Soviet
 buildup, and they seem to have had an increased
 sense that a war with the USSR, including the
 engagement of major ground forces, was a real
 possibility. This view was privately expressed by
 Chou En-lai in early 1966 and by Teng Ilsiao-ping
 (among others) in mid-March. However, they still
 apparently did not perceive 'he threat of a major
 war as immincnt: they spoke only of an "eventual"
 or an "inevitable" war with the USSR. Nevertheless,
 the USSR `in fact had become the PRC's principal
 enemy, although not yet in official statements and
 documents.
 B. First Seri,hus Consideration of Being a
 Possible! Nuclear Target: 1966
 Chou and Tong in early 1966 had been speak-
 ing about Soviet conventional forces, but shortly
 thereafter, the Chinese for the first time seemed
 to lake scrlo((sli/ the possibility that the Soviets
 would use nuclem' weapons against them, whether
 In escalation of the border conflict w? in a massive
 disarming strike. 'ibis new assessment was reflected
 in it public interview given by former Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi, who declared that:
 Suvirt missiles hilly our clay fly from Moscow to
 1'rkIng.  Peking  Is  already  an  atomic  tnrurt.

 The Soviets showed concern-as they had in the
 summer of 1961-about Vladivostok as the city
 most vulnerable to Chinese ground attack. It was
 in Vladivostok that Brezhnev made the remark that
 the Sovie! Far East is a land "whose every foot"
 glorifies the courage of Russian man (speech of
 19 May 1966). Podgorny in Khabarovsk spoke on
 1 June of the need to "guard" and "if necessary,
 defend" the USSR's Far East borders. The Soviets
 continued to build up their regular army units

 C. Chinese Continue to Believe a Soviet
 Attack Not Imminent: 1967-1969
 Chinese actions in this period reflected ,in
 apparent belief that any Soviet attack in the near
 future would be conventional in nature, if it came
 at all, and planning continued to be for the distant
 future. Although construction was begun on some
 new airfields, and several early-warning radar sites
 were established near the border, the Chinese did
 not substantially increase their forces in 1966.
 Moreover, military contact with Soviet troops was
 limit !d to border patrol encounters, and both sides
 adhered to no-shooting policies
 Pushing-and-shoving encounters on the Amur and
 Ussnri river islands, incited by lied Guards and
 Chinese border patrols rejecting  Sov'kot  border
 guard demands to cease patrolling and return to
 the Chinese bank, reportedly were widespread in
 the winter of 1967 during Mao's Cultural lievolu-
 tion.  The 1969 fighting was at points which had
 been tense for at least two years.) I

 It is necessary to reiterate that, (respite this post-
 Czechoslovakia assessment, the Chinese did not
 seem to feel that the danger of a major Soviet
 attack was imminent. Thus, they sustained their
 forward patrolling along the border, disputing
 Soviet control of certain border areas, mainly the
 islands in tho Amur and Ussuri rivers, and cal-
 culating ghat the Soviets would not be provoked
 into striking back with a major attack. When Chou
 En-lai in a speech on 29 September complained
 about overflights and "massive troop concentra-
 tions" on the border, he went on to say that Mos-
 cow's "military threats and war blackmail" would
 have "no effect whatsoever."
 ii, IMMINENT POSSIBILITY OF A MAJOR
 SOVIET ATTACK: 1969
 Mao and his aides clearly believed themselves to
 be expert in assessing the degree of tolerance in
 the policy of a, military superpower confronting
 China. They had been mgagcd in one war (Korea)
 in which they risked the US use of nuclear weapons
 and had gone to the brink of war twice (the two
 Taiwan Strait crises in 1954 and 1958)-and had
 emerged from each confrontation with a convic-
 tion that they had had some leeway for probing to
 gauge US determination to defend friendly coun-
 tries, They seem to have transferred their convic-
 tion-that they were expert in assessing a superior
 adversary's tolerance of probing-to their ccnfi r-
 tation with the Soviets.
 A. Chinese Provocations: March-August 1969
 The Chinese leaders in 1969 tes.cd the degree of
 Soviet tolerance of provocation as they carried out
 a policy of forward patrolling to contest Chinese-
 defined "disputed" areas, keeping the probes down
 to small-scale encounters. Mao and his aides un-
 doubtedly calculated that they had leeway to en-
 gage in such encounters with conventional weapons
 without provoking a major Soviet attack against
 China. They seem to have anticipated retaliation
 by small Soviet conventional-force units only. They
 guessed right about 'be level of Soviet retaliation.
 Between 2 March and mid-August, every Soviet
 riposte to Chinese patrol probes was carried out
 with.suelr conventional ground weapons as artillery,
 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and automatic
 rifles. No aircraft were used, ?nor (lid the Soviets
 expand the conflict from the immediate areas of
 the skirmishes. Soviet conventional weapons, and
 the mobility supplied by their armored personnel
 carriers, were sufficient to defeat each of the Chi-
 nese border units they were used against, However,
 the Chinese policy remained within -he confines of
 rational calculation, and despite Soviet charges of
 Chinese "madness," there was method in it. The level
 of Chinese provocation was also kept down by
 spreading the attacks out in time, by the use of small
 units, and by Chinese probing at a variety of points.
 The Chinese ambush of a Soviet border guard
 unit on Chen Pao Island on 2 March was a definite
 escalation, Mao and his aides appear to have chosen
 that particular Ussuri River island which provided
 them with the strongest case of Chinese ownership:
 Chen Pao was not only on the Chinese side of the
 main navigational channel  in the Ussuri, but also
 was virtually a part of the Chinese bank. The op-
 posing Soviet border guard unit at least twice
 previously (in late January and early February; in
 the latter instance, riflebutts were used by both
 sides in a fight) had conic out across the river ice
 to the Chinese side onto Chen Pao to order Chinese
 forces to withdraw. Mao undoubtedly had been
 angered by this bullying, and apparently was de-
 termined to demonstrate to the Soviet leaders that
 their rnrrt-ar : apability against China would not
 npose passivity on Chiut;.,c forces, border units
 included. The ambush of Soviet forces at Chen
 Pao escalated the dispute to a major shooting inci-
 dent. In subsequent engagements at Chen  Pao
 and other points along the border, the Soviets used
 their superior firepower to effectively defeat Chi-
 nese units entering Soviet-controlled territory.

 fight. A new firefight did occur on 15 March and,
 despite a Chinese defeat by Soviet troops using
 armored p rsonnel carriers, tanks,  and artillery,
 Mao continued to contest the island and other terri-
 there was some evidence of tanks and artillery
 being dispersed and revetted against a possible air
 attack, Mao's actions on the border made it clear
 that he was not intimidated.*
 As they carried out their forward patrolling onto
 disputed territory, and as their border guard units
 were defeated in almost every small-scale firefight,
 the Chinese kept alert for signs that the Soviets
 might be considering a nuclear strike against Chi-
 nese targets. What they seem to have perceived
 were Soviet political signals intended to frighten
 them into desisting on the border.
 Soviet envoys abroad informedi
 governments  (among  others)  privately
 t hat  Moscow would take any steps necessary to
 force the Chinese to stop border probing. 7, hese
 vague warnings conveyed in mid-March were not
 as explicit as the threat to use nuclear weapons if
 necessary, which was made by the less official So-
 viet instrument, Moscow's Radio Peace and Prog-
 ress:
 ... are we afraid of Mao Tse-tung and his pawns,
 who are making a display of might on our bn;-
 der? . . . The whole world knows that the main
 striking force of the Soviet armed forces is its
 rocket units. (Broadcast of 15 March 1969.1
 Peking later (on 2 Jule) complained about this
 threatening language and showed some concern,
 but the Chinese calculated correctly that the So-
 viet leartcrs won?d continue to avoid striking hack
 with a major attack.
 *?)cspitc their defeat in March, the Chinese subsequently
 returned to Chen Pao, dug in their forces, and remain
 entrenched to this day. The Soviets apparently had a similar
 view of Chinese rights to this particular island and did
 not continue to contest it.

 B. Chinese Alarm and Retreat: August-
 September 1969
 The Soviets were confronted with the task of
 convincing the Chinese that the alternative to ne-
 gotiatl:)iis was it major attack on China, conventional
 or nuclear, and that Moscow would not permit the
 Chinese to bleed the Russians endlessly in it series
 of smell-scale skirmishes. The Soviets set about
 raising Chinese concern to it level of anxiety suffi-
 cient to i.npel Mao and his aides finally to desist
 and agree to negotiations.
 If anything further was needed to persuade the 25X1
 Chines" to lesist, it was probably supplied by in-
 formation that Western intelligence services, par-
 ticularly the American intelligence community, had
 become alarmed  about the possibility of it Soviet
 .f n 28 August 1Vasli-
 tng on Post article attributing to American iritelli-
 gence the view that the Soviets might launch an
 air strike against ~ lima's nuclear facilities in the
 northwest. Furthermore, the article noted that "one
 key official" in Washington "who only a month
 earlier had rated the chances of a major Chinese-
 Soviet fight at 'about 10 percent recently said that  25X1
 the chances now are only slightly less than 50-50."
 Also in late ?;u pus
 informec
 officials hiso )c levee that it Soviet air strike could
 no longer he discounted.
 It is likely that Mao and his aides placed con-
 siderable credence in estimates made in the Ameri-
 can intelligence community (as reflected in the
 *Between August and October, Chinese provincial broad-
 casts for the first time referred to the USSR as Chinas
 "principal enemy," officially displacing the US in that role.
 Vasl:ill ,ton.  =ost article) as well as
 Jof Soviet intentions. Mao retreated    5X1
 further from a confrontation in the week after Pe-
 king's rejection of a Soviet offer for  Chou-Kosygin
 meeting in Hanoi at IIo Chi Minh's funeral (4 Sep.
 tember). Peking accepted a renewed Soviet bid,
 resulting in a Choti-Kosygin meeting at the Peking
 airport (11 September). The 11 September meet-
 ing was a reversal by Mao of his policy of refusing
 leader-to-leader contacts with the Russians, the last
 such having been the Teng-Brezhncv meeting in
 Bucharest in June 1965, more than four years before.
 Although Mao and  his aides may have been un-
 certain as to whether the Soviet threats were to
 be taken at face value, the Chinese leaders un-
 doubtedly found it prudent to consider a major
 Soviet attack to be an imminent possibility.
 Nothing short of such a judgment could have
 impelled Mao to desist in mid-August from sending
 out patrols and to agree in early September to a

 III. THE ROAD BACK: DECREASING FEAR OF
 IMMINENT ATTACK: 1969-1970
 The Chinese seemed to have calculated that the
 Chou-Kosygin agreement +-- cease forward patrol-
 ling on both sides and to begin negotiations ill
 Peking drastically reduced the chance of a major
 Soviet attack. They settled down to the task of im-
 posing poli;ieal losses on the Soviets while keeping
 them engaged in the talks. The Chinese publicly
 professed to being under threat from the Soviets
 and, hoping for international condemnation of Alos-
 cow, complained 1Iin1  they could not nrgotlate
 meaningfully so long as the Soviets refused in ad-
 vance to withdraw thei? forces from "disputed"

 IV. PEKING EXAGGERATES CONVENTIONAL,

 1972
 In order to gc?nrrale third-country prc?ssnre to
 keep the Soviets restraiocd and to impose political
 losses nn Moscow for "bullying" China, from mid-
 1970 the vinpliasis of Chinese stateon?nls oil tile

 to nndlcar than convcntic,n:tl attack. but the threat
 of the latter was sorely regarded as more credible

 was More useful for, because more credible to, the
