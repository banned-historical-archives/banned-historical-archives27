 THE INTERNATIONAL LIAISON DEPARTMENT
 OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 MEMORANDUM FOR RECIPIENTS
 This study examines in some depth the International
 Liaison Department (ILD) of the Chinese Communist Party
 (CCP), the only one of the Party's central departments
 on which there is enough evidence to support such an
 examination.  The study finds that the ILD, radically
 reorganized in recent years, has been given new duties --
 particularly in the realm of improving the CCP's relations
 with governing CP's abroad -- and with these new duties
 an enhanced status.  The ILD is no longer obliged to
 implement the revolutionary, counter-productive policy of
 trying to export the Cultural Revolution, but instead is
 now charged with fostering reconciliation with friendly
 governing CP's, and a more relaxed line toward the CP's
 in non-Communist countries.  Among these latter, the ILD
 is reducing its commitments and diversifying its holdings.

 THE INTERNATIONAL LIAISON DEPARTMENT
 OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Sum,
 The International Liaison Department of the
 Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was
 probably formed in the early 1950s, possibly after a
 reallocation of the responsibilities of the United
 Front Department.  Throughout the 1950s and early
 1960s, it remained behind the scenes, responsible for
 contacts, communications, and coordination with other
 Communist Parties around the world.  It began to be
 more active with the development of the Sino-Soviet
 split, when its delegates to foreign Party meetings
 began to be more vociferous in advancing the CCP
 cause.  As the rift deepened and the Chinese began
 searching out independent supporters of their position,
 the ILD's activities became more 'important.
 Organized geographically and working hand-in-
 hand with Chinese embassies in.various countries, the
 ILD performed the task of finding, investigating and
 eventually supporting pro-Chinese splinter groups and
 malcontents, encourlgi.ngthem..to form so-called
 "Marxist-Leninist" parties in opposition to pro-Soviet
 "revisionist" parties.  In thi.s task the ILD pursued
 a patient, soft-sell policy, providing funds to keep
 the promising groups active, and offering political
 and organizational training on Chinese soil where it

 was deemed profitable. The ILD appeared to receive
 high-level supervision from the two ranking members
 of the Party Secretariat, Teng.Hsiao-ping and Peng
 Chen, and on occasion from Liu Shao-chi, then Mao's
 designated successor.
 The purges of the Cultural Revolution had a
 tremendous impact on the ILD, both organizationally
 and operationally.   Its top-level leaders and
 supervisors were wiped. out very early in the Revolu-
 tion, and those who replaced them, under the guidance
 of Kang Sheng and a group of PLA officers, were
 obliged to implement a counter-productive policy of
 ideological militancy and....organizational interference
 until this "revolur.ionary diplomacy" was replaced by
 a new, more flexible-1 . ine.  .In.1968.and much of 1969,
 the ILD remained ideol.ogical.ly.and.organizationally
 incoherent, gradually. retr.ea.ting...from. the policy of
 giving explicit directions to splinter parties, and
 trying instead to improve strained relations with
 ruling Parties in selecte.d.co.untries.  Although the
 department's leadership ...see.me.d... to.,be .generally in the
 hands of the PLA, under the. overall .direction of the
 civilian Kang Sheng..and.his wife, one veteran ILD
 cadre, Shen Chien, continued to make frequent
 appearances.
 It was not until late 1970 that the new ILD
 really began to take shape,._rrith.the,reappearance of
 several veteran mernbe.rs..who..had: been missing during
 the Cultural Revolution....Shen..Chien.had.been

 thereafter left a leadership vacuum.  This was filled
 by Keng Piao, Peking's Ambassador to Albania, who

 returned in January 1971 and was named to head the
 ILD in March.  During this period, the military
 presence which had dominated the ILI) was reduced.
 I'LA officer Kuo Yu-feng ceased to appear with ILD
 personnel and reportedly took up full-time duties
 with the Organization Department.   Another PLA
 figure, Chu Ta-cheng, disappeared.   Yang Yu-heng,
 yet another PLA man once high in the ILD hierarchy,
 went out of sight for a time, and has more recently
 been making low-level ILD appearances.  Jen Yun-chung
 remains the principal visible PLA member of importance
 within the department.  In this regard, the ILD has
 been an exception to the general course of Party-
 rebuilding, which has seen PLA domination of most
 provincial Party committees, of many if not most of
 the central Party departments, and of the Party
 committee of the Foreign Ministry.
 In addition to consolidating Party control
 over the ILD, Keng Piao has been expanding the
 department.  Several new members have been added to
 the small coterie of veteran cadres (who seem to
 occupy the top leadership positions) listed in the
 open press u3 members of the ILD.  Division of labor
 along functional and geographic lines, though not
 specified in the press, seems to be taking place.
 The ILD itself seems to have acquired more
 importance along with its greater visibility.  In
 any kind of public listing of central regime depart-
 ments, it is ordinarily the first one mentioned,
 and its leaders are usually the first ones mentioned
 in group appearance lists.   On such occasions,
 Keng Piao is invariably the first or second person
 mentioned after Politburo members, and ILD deputy
 directors Shen Chien and Jen Yun-chung invariably

 appear before vice-foreign ministers and sometimes
 before even the acting foreign minister, Chi
 Peng-fei.
 In terms of duties performed, the ILD has
 recently become more active in the implementation
 of policy toward China's major allies, particularly
 in the realm of improving government/Party
 relations.  Some observers believe that the ILD,
 and particularly Keng Piao, plays an active role
 in the overall formulation of foreign.policy, and
 has supervisory authority over the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs and all other departments concerned
 with foreign relations.  However, it-seems likely
 that -- as the Chinese themselves have said
 privately -- the most important foreign policies
 are formulated by a small group around Chou En-lai
 (of which Keng is apparently one member).
 With the onset of the Cultural Revolution,
 ILD policy incoherence seemed-to parallel the
 condition of China itself,  The export-of radical
 excesses to foreign countries caused China's Party
 relations to decline along. with its overall
 international prestige.  Ideological militancy, as
 well as obeisance to the thought of Chairman Mao,
 was demanded of China's Party allies, large or
 small.  Those who had the independence and will to
 do so, resisted this type of activity.  The result
 was that China's only allies were the.Albanians,
 who had already burned all other bridges, and a
 smattering of insignificant "Marxist-Leninist"
 splinter groups.  Upon these latter, the ILD made
 further demands, such as the creation of clandestine

 SECRET
 organizations, which added up to requiring a duplica-
 tion of the Chinese experience.  These demands often
 caused serious internal difficulties for the parties
 concerned.
 With the decline in "revolutionary diplomacy"
 after mid-1967 and the perceived military threat
 from the Soviet Union after autumn 1968, ILD policy
 began to reflect the change in the thinking of the
 CCP leadership.  In late 1969, the ILD, although
 still in a state of organizational disorder, began
 to implement a policy of reconciliation with the CCP's
 various potential allies.  This included a gradual
 warming of Party relations with North Vietnam and
 the National Liberation Front of South Vietna^:. North
 Korea, the Laotian Patriotic Front, and Rumania.  As
 the ILD has itself consolidated, is has continued to
 play a major role in maintaining these good relations.
 With a new, less militant ideology in hand,
 the ILD has put into effect a more relaxed policy
 towards smaller Party friends, much to the relief of
 some of them.  Organizational as well as ideological
 requirements have become much more flexible and
 realistic, and the Chinese have admitted that earlier
 policies were sometimes wrong..  On the other hand,
 it appears that some loyal Party allies which offer
 insignificant help to the Chinese have been down-
 graded in order to pursue bigger.game at the government
 level.  Stressing Maoist principles of "pelf-decision
 and self-sufficiency," the ILD has basically terminated
 financial support for some "Marxist-Leninist"
 (pro-Chinese) parties, leaving.them to flounder.
 Consonant with this, Peking has sometimes shown as

 THE INTERNATIONAL LIAISON DEPARTMENT
 OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Functions, Organization and Status
 One organizational feature that appears to be
 common to nearly all Communist Parties of any size is
 a department of the Party set up to deal with relations
 with other Communist Parties and countries.  In the
 Soviet Union, this function is divided between an
 International Department (for non-bloc parties) and
 a Bloc Department (for Communist Parties in power).   In
 the People's Republic of China, these function- are
 united in an International Liaison Department (ILD).
 It is the purpose of the first part of this paper to
 trace the organizational development of the ILD* from
 a relatively obscure and clandestine branch of the
 Party to its present status as an open, active partici-
 pant in the implementation of Chinese foreign policy.
 Prior to 1971, the existence of the ILD was not
 officially acknowledged                                    25X1

 *The translation International Liaison Department

 the department by the 9th Central Committee is Chun  Yang

 "Central Foreign Liaison Department."  However, NCNA and
 FBIS translate the term as International Liaison Depart-
 ment, so this paper will do the same.                           It is important to

 formed in or about 1951-52 when the United Front
 Department was split in two, though this is uncertain.
 Prior to and during the Cultural Revolution
 the functions of the ILD were limited.
 Its primary
 responsibility was to maintain contacts with
 friendly Communist Parties in Communist-ruled
 countries, and to find, nurture and develop pro-
 Chinese sentiment wherever it was found.  In this
 capacity, it often worked hand-in-glove with overseas
 MFA personnel in the embassies.
 At the same time, it is clear from the available
 evidence that the MFA and ILD kept their functions
 carefully se arated.
 (continued  rom page 1) note, however, that this is a
 new name; prior to the 9th Central Committee meeting,
 the official name for the department was Chung Yan
 Kuo Chi Lien Lo Pu, which does translate accurate y as
 "Central International Liaison Department."

 The first head of the liaison department was
 Wang Chia-hsiang.  This was surmised from his frequent
 attendance at foreign Party Congresses and his
 greeting of Party delegations to Peking. and h   more

 nominally the department'head, he did go into eclipse;
 d
 e facto leadership of the ILD passed into the hands
 oTuTt  Hsiu-chuan, with Politburo-level supervision
 apparently provided by Tenp Hsiao-ping and Peng Chen.
 The purges of the Cultural Revolution hit the
 ILD very early.  Among the first to be disposed of
 was Wang Chia-hsiang, and by early 1966, Wu Hsiu-chuan
 and much of the rest of the top leadership were also
 out of power, if perhaps not yet purged.*  Leadership

 duties were taken over in March 1966 (according to
 later Red Guard posters) by Liu Ning-i, former
 head of the ACFTU, assisted by Chao I-min, a veteran
 ILD member with much experience.  These two carried
 on the majority of the visible work of the ILD during
 1966 and early 1967, with Liu himself attending a
 New Zealand party congress in April 1966.  As the
 Cultural Revolution expanded and grew more violent
 and disruptive, the ILD, like nearly all other
 components of the Chinese bureaucracy, ceased to
 function effectively.  Following the standard pattern,
 younger members of the department engaged in vicious
 criticism of the higher cadres, and the department
 became almost completely paralyzed,
 fierce ideological quarrelling had
 broken out between "heaven" and "earth" factions
 within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ILD,
 with the result that work came to a virtual standstill.
 Nobody was willing to take the responsibility for
 writing reports or signing papers, and almost all
 work was passed on to the highest levels of leadership,
 which were also under heavy ideological fire.  Sometime
 during this period, Wang Li, former radical journalist
 and member of the central Cultural Revolution Group,
 was brought into the ILD as a deputy director in
 charge of combatting "revisionism" within the depart-
 ment.  Much of the middle-level leadership was
 apparently brought down during this early 1967 period.
 In late 1967, things went from bad to worse.  In
 September, Wang Li himself came under intense
 criticism from his superiors, who curtailed his duties
 and informed the ILD to do likewise; he was later
 purged.  Chao I-min, although he claimed to be a
 member of the "revolutionary" faction of the depart-
 ment, was reportedly investigated on the basis of early

 1967 Red Guard evidence, and was declared a
 "renegade" in September 1967 and imprisoned.  His
 fate is unknown, but he was dropped from the CCP
 Central Committee in 1969 and was presumably
 purged.  Liu Ning-i also came under heavy attack.
 He was apparently defended by Kang Shengfor a
 time, but the attacks continued and Liu disappeared
 in early 1968.
 In May 1968, a Canton 'Red 'Fla . supplement
 carried a speech made by Kang3Tenngo the "Military
 Control Group" of what was clearly the ILD, indicating
 that as far as..internal organization was concerned,
 things were entirely in the hands of the PLA.
 External functions of the ILD, such as greeting
 foreign Party delegations, holding talks with them,
 and such other publicly reported activities, were
 handled by Kang Sheng and his wife, Tsao I-ou.  The
 PLA figure Kuo Yu-feng was also brought up to Peking
 and elevated by Kang Sheng during this period.
 Little information exists on what happened
 to the ILD during the rest of 1968 and much of 1969.
 Apparently t e
 ILD was still in a state of limbo, in spite. of its
 new name and its official status under the 9th Central

 Committee.  Public appearances were handled mainly
 by Kang Sheng and his wife, along with Kuo.  In
 late 1969, the triumvirate of Shen Chien, Yang
 Yu-heng and Chu Ta-cheng, which was to remain in
 evidence all through 1970, began to appear.      Shen
 was a veteran cadre, Yang a known PLA officer, and
 Chu believed to be a PLA officer.  During late
 1970, other veteran ILD members, such as old Party
 cadres Chang Hsiang-shan and Tang Ming-chao, began
 to make reappearances.
 With the disappearance of Kang Sheng in
 November 1970 and the recall of Ambassador Keng
 Piao from Albania in December, the ILD apparently
 began to move toward stability.  Chu Ta-cheng and
 Kuo Yu-feng made their last appearances in ILD roles
 in January 1971 (Chu reappeared in November), and
 Yang Yu-heng seemingly went into decline.  Keng Piao
 began to make ILD appearances in February, and was
 identified as head of that department in March 1971.
 Since then, several other members of the department
 have been publicly identified, indicating a new
 public status and prestige for a formerly unpubli-
 cized organization.  In addition, the staff of the
 ILD seems to be expanding considerably, with
 several new faces appearing since May 1971.  Keng's
 rising status may eventually lead to  P. Politburo or
 revamped Secretariat position, though this is pure
 conjecture.
 There is now a striking scarcity of PLA men
 within the ILD.  Almost all of its apparent leaders
 and supervisors come from civilian backgrounds.
 Until he was recently purged, Politburo member and
 head of the PLA Air Force Wu Fa-hsien showed up

 Politburo members most frequently seen in connection

 It is presumed that this organizational struc-

 Revolution.  Other events, such as the heightened
 importance of the Vietnam conflict, and increasing
 hostility with the Soviet Union, have probabl  also

 There is some disagreement as to present and
 past responsibilities of the ILD.  Basic policies
 are of course formulated in the Politburo standing
 committee.  Below that level, it is possible to
 argue -- as some observers have -- that the ILD as
 a Part  organ is responsible .for.the next level of
 formulation of foreign. policy, superior in.power to
 the Ministry of Foreign.Affairs, which is subordinate
 to the State Council.  In other words,.it is-
 con-ceivable that the ILD is the focal point of
 supervision of the entire foreign..affairs.apparatus,
 including the MFA, the Chinese People's Association
 for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and other
 departments. *
 There is some information to support this view.
 First, Keng's own Party position is apparently quite
 high; he has been listed on_many.occasions as the
 first Party dignitary after Politburo . members. (although
 he has begun to follow Kuo Mo-jo), and'-'always ahead
 of Chi Peng-fei, acting Foreign Minister of   e P RU.
 Further, Keng was mentioned. by name (along with
 Chou En-lai) in a recent Mao directive on foreign
 policy; no other Party members were mentioned.  Further,
 in contrast to previous custom, ILD personnel are now
 given pride of place in the Chinese media.  Not only
 "There is some speculation that Keng.is.a member
 of a possible-de. facto secretariat under Chou En-lai,

 is the de-artment always li:?ted ahead of the Ministry
 of Foreig,i Affairs, but ILD deputy directors now are
 consistently mentioned ahead of deputy foreign
 ministers, and on occasion ahead of the acting foreign
 minister.  Further, members of the ILD have recently
 been appearing regularly at functions which they
 previously would not have attended, for example,
 greeting economic or government study delegations from
 allied countries, attending various protocol functions
 and receptions at'foreign embassies (from socialist
 countries) and other affairs usually handled exclusively
 by the MFA.  Further, Keng Piao has been giving
 numerous briefings to foreign Communists, at which he
 has spoken with authority on international affairs and
 Chinese relations with non-Communist nations, as well
 as on international Communist relations.  For example,
 shortly after meeting with.Keng and other ILD
 personnel, in July 1971 a sympathetic American,
 William Hinton, wrote an apparently authoritative
 article for a Chinese newspaper concerning the rationale
 for China's recent initiatives toward the United States,
 defending those actions against anticipated leftist
 criticism.
 However, most of the ILD's public appearances
 have been with friendly Communist delegations, and that
 aspect of foreign policy is clearly its main concern.
 It does not seem to have the scope to act as the focal
 point for the shaping of all foreign policy below the
 politburo standing committee level.  On balance, it
 seems likely that MFA personnel have been telling the
 truth in insisting that important foreign-policy
 decisions are made by a small group around Chou En-lai.
 Keng Piao is probably one member of that group.

 The ILD in Action -- 'Implementation of Policy
 Any discussion of policy pursued by the ILD is
 based upon scant information and bound to be speculative.
 Moreover, there would necessarily be a time lapse
 between the actual formulation of policy by the standing
 committee of the Politburo and its correct implementation
 and reiteration by the liaison department -- which makes
 for further imprecision.  For the purposes of clarity
 and convenience, the discussion of policy herein is
 divided into two topics, that of relations between the
 CCP and other Communist state parties (e.g., CPSU,
 Korean Workers Party), and that of relations between the
 CCP and clandestine or opposition parties in countries
 not ruled by Communist governments.  In terms of infor-
 mation available, most of the discussion of the former
 is based upon open source information
 Relations with Communist Government/Parties:   By
 1963, the  ino- oveet sp it and its world-wide reper-
 cussions in the Communist movement had significantly cut
 down the number and frequency of the CCP's party contacts
 and functions with other Bloc countries.  Not that the
 ILD was out of work, but there was probably much less
 overt work for it to do in this field than in earlier
 periods of international Communist amicability.
 With the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966,
 China's Party relations decreased even more.  Like most
 capitalist and neutral nations, China's few Communist

 'allies' generally reacted very coldly to Maoist
 "Red Guard diplomacy," with the result that both
 Party and state relations with other socialist countries
 declined steadily.  If -- as seems likely -- the
 appearance of ILD personnel at various public functions
 is an indication of the state of relations between the
 CCP and other Parties, the only Bloc Party which
 remained on good terms with the CCP by early 1967 was
 the Communist Party of Albania.  Relations with the
 North Korean Workers Party (KWP) and the Vietnamese
 Workers Party (VWP) or Lao Dong Party were outwardly
 correct, but strained.  While delegations from the DRV
 still visited Puking on occasion, receptions were not
 attended by Kang Sheng, Liu Ning-i or Chao I-min, the
 known ILD leaders during this period.  The K11W1P was
 treated even more coolly by the CCP in the press, on
 important anniversaries, and on those few occasions
 when delegations from the DPRK came to Peking during
 the Cultural Revolution.  By February 1967, the strains
 in relations with the KWP were particularly severe,
 as a result of Chinese dissemination of Red Guard
 attacks on Pyongyang.  Relations with the CPSU and with
 the strongly pro-Soviet Parties of East Europe and the
 Mongolian People's Republic 'were totally ruptured, and
 reflected open hostility.  In contrast, Albania basked
 in the warmth of grand Party receptions, often attended
 by the entire CCP Politburo, numerous celebrations and
 receptions at embassies, and lengthy press coverage.
 Enver Hoxha, Albania's Party and government leader,
 became the foreign leader best known in China.  The
 CCP maintained relat.ions._ with. _the Rumanian Party, but
 they were only moderately better than with other East
 European Communists.

 Mao ordered a pullback from "revolutionary
 diplomacy" in August 1967, but it was only gradually
 that this policy began to be reflected in improved
 relations with various Communist regimes.   In the
 wake of the Sino-Soviet border clashes of March 1969,
 and in line with new ideolo`4_cal and policy formulations
 adopted by the new 9th Central Committee in April,
 improvement was marked.  Judging by press coverage,
 length and wording of Party communications, and
 frequency and attendance at receptions, Chinese rela-
 tions with Albania were still the most amicable, but
 relations were clearly better with the DP.V and the
 NLFSV.   The ILD, represented by Kang.Sheng and a few
 others, played an increasing role in these public
 demonstrations of improved relations.   In June 1969,
 China dispatched to the DRV one of the first post-Cul-
 tural Revolution ambassadors, and also gave embassy
 status to the NLFSV, which now became the Provisional
 Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (PRGSV).   In
 the summer of 1969, Chinese overtures for improvement
 of Party relations with the Communist Parties of
 Rumania and North Korea also became evident.  The CCP's
 posture toward Cuba's party, however, appeared to
 remain cool and distant.  The Soviet Union continued,
 of course, to be an object of scorn, while its East
 European allies were only slightly less disparaged.
 The few delegations from these latter countries that
 did visit Peking received quiet, unheralded receptions,
 strictly in accordance with formal protocol, and
 attended only by a few government and military personnel.
 October 1969 was a very active fence-mending
 month for the Chinese Communists, in which the ILD, even
 in its tenuous state of organization, appeared to be an
 active participant.  Two future leaders of the emerging

 2 October soiree given by the Politburo for high-level
 Party/government delegations from the DRV, the PRGSV,
 Albania, DPRK and Rumania, which were attending
 National Day celebrations in Peking.  In December 1969,
 the ILD was also represented at a reception given by
 the central Cultural Revolution Group -- just prior to
 the CRG's disappearance -- for. friendly Communist and
 "Marxist-Leninist" parties from Albania, France, DRV,
 Burma and Australia.
 During the early part.. of 1970, Communist China,
 with the ILD still playing an active if minor role,
 continued to improve Party relations with its chosen
 allies.  In April 1970, Sino-Korean relations took a
 great step forward with the vi.sit.of Premier Chou En-lai
 to Pyongyang.  Thereafter, the.DPRK received much more
 Chinese press coverage, expanded..the 'social' activities
 of its embassy in Peking,. and.gener.ally began to receive
 more high-level treatment by the CCP, including more
 frequent appearances at Sino-Korean functions by ILD
 members.   VWP First Secretary Le Duan's May 1970 visit
 to Peking and Mao Tse-tung.'s 20 May statement, of support
 for the Vietnamese. cause. appeared.. to reach a new high
 point of Sino-Vietnamese amicability.  The warm, high-
 level reception given to. Rumanian Communist Party
 leader Emil Bodnaras on his June 197.0 visit to China
 also gave evidence of improved relations.  Kang Shen

 Parties have become close in all respects.  In spite of

 eyes, and indeed, Keng Piao, as late as June 1971, has
 expressed CCP reservations about the internal workings
 of the KWP.  The Rumanians, too, must appear as ideologi-
 cal fence-straddlers.

 "ultra-Leftist."  Chang Tsang, though identified here
 as an ILD official, has never made a public appearance.

 invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 and the
 bloody Sino-Soviet clashes of early 1969.   China
 needed allies, if only to exert opinion pressure on
 the Soviets to dissuade them from what the Chinese
 may have considered as impending military action.
 In view of this need for political support, ideological
 differences began to be downplayed.  The ILD leadership,
 consisting mainly of civilian cadres, veterans of the
 old .LLD or the diplomatic corps, would seem to be
 particularly well-suited to the performance of this
 type of task.
 After the decline of Kang Sheng, the ILD became
 even more active in its relations with established
 governing Communist Parties.  However, it still seemed
 to take a back seat to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 (MFA) on public o:casions, perhaps mainly due to the
 fact that its leading members at that time, Shen Chien
 and Jon Yun-chung, lacked the Party or government
 status to properly display the growing importance of
 the department.  This lack was eliminated.w ith the
 return to Peking of Keng Piao,.who had been serving
 as ambassador to Albania.  Kong returned in January
 1971, appeared at various foreign affairs functions the
 next month, and was finally publicly identified as
 head of the ILD in early March, when he-accompanied
 Chou En-lai on an important trip to Hanoi.   Since that
 time, the ILD has been significantly more active in the
 maintenance of good Party/government relations with
 selected Communist nations.
 Asia has appeared to be the area of primary
 concern in this regard, and the ILD has apparently
 played a major role in continuing the warming trend of
 relations with North Korea, North Vietnam and other
 Asian Communist Parties (with the notable exception of

 the JCP).  Le Duan, the First- Secretary of the VWP,
 visited China enroute to, and immediately upon his
 return from the 24th Congress of the CPSU in May
 1971.  Keng Piao was a regular participant in the
 talks that ensued, and accompanied Le Duan on his
 tour of China.  Keng and other members of the ILD,
 Shen Chien in particular, have been-conspicuous
 participants in a variety of functions and receptions
 for DRV delegations, at which, previously, ILD members
 were not present.  These have included the greeting of
 government, economic, and youth delegations to Peking,
 as well as attendance at numerous receptions in the
 DRV embassy.
 In the spring and summer of 1971, the JLD has
 become increasingly active in developing and maintain-
 ing relations with the two-other Southeast Asian
 Communist Parties in control of a large part of their
 countries:  The Laotian Patriotic Front (LPF) or Neo
 Lao Hak Xat, and the Cambodian People's Revolutionary
 Party.  The CCP has generally expressed firm support
 for the activities of these embattled Parties, and
 recently their visiting delegations have received
 public, high-level treatment in Peking. LPF leader
 Kaysone Phomivane visited Peking in April 1971, and
 was received by high-ranking offieials of the CCP,
 including Keng Piao.and other members of.the ILD.  Keng
 recently commented also on the.fact.thatthe Chinese
 were highly impressed by the military success and mass
 appeal demonstrated by the Cambodian Communists since
 the 1970 anti-Sihanouk coup, and, perhaps as evidence
 of that growing interest, appeared prominently at an
 August 1971 reception for a Cambodian rebel hero, the
 first time that any ILD personnel had had any public
 association with Cambodian delegations.

 Keng Piao and Shen Chien were particularly
 active, during the summer of 1971, in improving Chinese
 relations with North Korea.   Kong was a member of the
 delegation, headed by Politburo member and Vice-Premier
 Li Hsien-nien, which visited Pyongyang in July to
 commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sinu-Korean
 treaty of friendship and mutual assistance, and was
 one of the main Party members consistently present at
 the departure. and return of various student, journalist
 and worker delegations to the DPRK.  Other ILD members
 were frequent participants in Sino-Korean functions,
 and it would appear that earlier criticisms of Kim
 I1-sung's Korean Workers Party were laid aside.
 Outside of Asia, the Chinese have seemed
 particularly concerned with maintaining good Party re-
 lations with Rumania.  The June 1971 visit of Rumania's
 government and Party leader Nicolae Ceausescu was the
 culmination of a warming trend that had brought ever
 more important Rumanian leaders to China since early
 1970.  The August 1970 stopover in Bucharest of a high-
 level PLA delegation and the extension of a large loan
 provide 'indications of China's interest in consolidating
 this relatively recent friendship.  The ILD has
 seemingly been quite instrumental in pursuing this
 policy.  Keng Piao, for example, was one of Ceausescu's
 escorts on his recent tour of China.  Again, ideological
 issues have been consistently played down, the main
 virtue of the Rumanian Party being its independence of
 and resistance to its Soviet neighbor.  Although the
 Chinese appraisal of the Rumanian ideological position
 is mixed, Rumania's anti-Soviet tendency has provided
 sufficient assurance for the Chinese to develop Party
 relations.

 Relations with Opposition and Splinter Communist
 Parties:  The more important of the  ms's tasks in t =e
 Cultural Revolution period and for a short time there-
 after (as it had been ever since the emergence of Sino-
 Soviet rivalry) was the identification, instruction,
 and support of Communist Party groups favorable to
 Peking in foreign countries.  This function, although
 certainly less important now than is the ILD's partici-
 pation in the maintenance of state/Party relations with
 certain countries, is still actively carried out by the
 ILD today.
 Chinese policy in this matter has gone through
 a number of changes, in response to developments in
 the real world and different official interpretations
 of Mao Tse-tung's "thought."
 Prior to the Cultural Revolution, it was the
 responsibility of ILD personnel in some of the larger
 overseas missions (such as, presumably, the embassies
 in Paris and Bern), or, more often, the head of mission
 in the smaller embassies, to identify, contact, analyze,
 report on, and support pro-Chinese groups -- often
 small and insignificant.

 faction of the "Marxist-Leninist" Party of Belgium,
 openly declared their distaste for the Cultural Revo-
 lution and supported the polices which-they attributed
 to Liu Shao-chi.  This, of course, brought about their
 immediate fall from favor.  Although the ILD had
 always been faced with the problem of discovering the
 "genuine" Marxist-Leninist parties among a host of
 competing pro-Chinese groups, the problem became
 particularly acute in 1966-67, when pro-Maoist groups
 seemed to proliferate.  Additionally, in line with the
 tougher stance of "revolutiopary" Maoist. diplomacy the
 ILD was responsible for making. sure that parties which
 declared themselves to be pro-Chinese were indeed toeing
 the correct ideological line.  These knotty problems,
 added to the fact that the ILD leadership was being
 heavily attacked during the Cultural Revolution, led to
 general incoherence in policy.

 In contrast to the later period, when the
 ILD soft-pedaled ideological differences and used
 persuasion to try to win over visiting delegations
 to their point of view, the Cultural Revolution
 saw not only an increased demand by the ILD for Maoist
 orthodoxy and ideological militancy, but also an
 increase in organizational demands on foreign
 parties.  The idea of creating a clandestine party
 organization  arallel to the overt organization
 (where one existed) began to be proposed-by the
 ILD.  Whether this was done a , part of a blind
 application of Mao's concept of Chinese revolutionary
 experience, or out of a real concern for the welfare
 and safety of Marxist-Leninist parties under possibly
 repressive governments, is uncertain.  But it appears
 that the ILD began. to stress this idea of..parallel
 structures more heavily for a. number of parties
 during the Cultural Revolution.  In. those parties, such
 as soma; in Latin America, where governmental suppression
 was a real problem, such a policy was. natural and
 acceptable.  However, for those parties which were

 Another aspect of ILD policy, held over from
 earlier leadership, also began to receive heavy
 criticism from the CCP's more outspoken allies in
 Latin America.  This concerned China's attitude toward
 factionalism and the official 'blessing' of certain
 parties by the CCP.  Although ILD policy was very
 vague during the Cultural Revolution, it appeared
 that it followed the pre-Cultural Revolution penchant
 of selecting one party or group from among a number
 of competing radical organizations, and declaring it,
 on the basis of their general criteria or sometimes
 on the basis of Mao's personal recognition of the
 leader,* the orthodox "Marxist-Leninist" party within
 a certain country.  This party, then, became the sole
 recipient of aid and encouragement, and often would have
 its articles published in the Chinese press.
 Until recently, the ILD consistently carried
 out a policy of discouraging factionalism within
 these chosen parties, or among groups whose ideologies
 were very similar.  Although personal quarrels and
 factionalizing have seemed to be endemic problems
 among radical groups that seek Chinese support, the
 ILD until 1970 strongly opposed these tendencies, often
 withholding financial and propaganda aid, or threaten-
 ing to do so, until various factions within a certain
 KThiS wourcT seem to be the case with the "Marxist-
 Leninist" parties in Chile, Italy, and to some extent,
 New Zealand.

 party or competing groups of similar ideologies could
 unite and.settle their difficulties.  Such a policy
 was pursued.with.reference to pro-Chinese parties in
 Italy, Belgium,. Sudan, Indonesia, and Latin.America.
 Only when factionalism involved important ideological
 differences would the Chinese condone it.
 By 1970, however, ILD policy on the issue of
 factionalism. seemed. to have changed.  This was perhaps
 due to a combination of factors:
 1.  no amount of ILD pressure seemed to be able
 to quell the problem of factions within small splinter
 parties;
 2.  the. ILD had come under no small amount of
 criticism from a number of sources for choosing one
 faction over another (particularly in Latin America),
 sometimes on the basis of false or unreliable inform-
 tion; and
 3.  there had been a change in the overall foreign
 policy line, shifting away from "revolutionary diplomacy."
 The latter. consideration is, of course, by far the most
 important.  Although an exact date for this shift in
 emphasis of Chinese foreign policy is impossible to fix
 exactly, its results can perhaps. be seen in the
 enunciation and implementation of ILD policy during late
 1969 and 1970.
 In contrast to. the hard-Line militancy and
 relatively stringent organizational "suggestions" made
 by the ILD during the Cultural Revolution period, the
 new line seems more pragmatic, relaxed and realistic.

 As explained to various Party visitors to China in
 mid-1970 by Kang Sheng., Tang. Ming-chao., and Chang
 Hsiang-shan, the latest ILD program contains strong
 elements of pragmatism..  The new. Maoist ideological
 demarche stresses independence and initiative, and
 strict attention to . local. conditions before determinin
 party policy or organizational procedures.
 Kang continued to stress the necessity for ideological
 correctness (apparently still.in the context of Maoist
 orthodoxy), but the advice on careful study of local
 conditions (rather than the Chinese experience) for
 the application of correct organizational principles
 seems to be something of a return to pre-Cultural Revo-
 lution attitudes.-The ILD has.gone yet another step
 in retreating from attempts to exert organizational
 influence on foreign.parties:  it has decided to keep
 the financial aid given to'a~ party to a minimum, and
 instead give moral and propaganda support to a wider
 range of pro-Chinese groups.

 This new policy was reflected in the press,
 particularly with the publication of National Day
 greetings and earlier congratulations.  Most notable
 was the proliferation of these greetings in 1970,
 there being messages from three Italian "Marxist-
 Leninist" groups plus the PCI, two from the Nether-
 lands, two from Belgium, and two from Greece.*  Though
 ree ings were also printed from two "Marxist-

 the beginnings of this policy could be seen to a
 degree in 1969 National Day.greetings, the tendency
 was much more pronounced in 1970.
 In 1970, the rather sensitive issue of party
 finances also seems to have been cleared up some by
 the ILD.  Tang explained in September that although
 giving political, military and financial aid to
 foreign parties could.-sometimes be a good thing,
 too often it had brought bad results such as misuse
 of funds, or a reliance upon the CCP for aid, leading
 to a lack of attention..to local work.*  It was
 admitted that the ILD's policy in this regard had
 been incorrect in the past, allegedly a result of
 Liu Shao-chi's faulty line, and that it had come
 under heavy criticism in the Cultural Revolution.
 xThe new policy was no doubt a reflection of
 Chinese disapproval of notorious fiscal irresponsibility
 and extravagance on the part of several splinter group
 leaders.

 parties had been voicing for some time.*
 The ILD under Keng Piao seems to be carrying
 on these principles in relation to pro-Chinese parties,
 and perhaps it is even broadening them.  Chinese
 non-interference in internal fact~ional:_di-sputes has
 been graphically demonstrated-by the equal treatment
 given to both factions of the-'--feuding Communist Party
 of Belgium.(Marxist-Leninist), which have visited
 China on separate occasions in 1971.  This policy is
 also reflected in the even greater variety of parties
 whose messages.of congratulations on the occasion of
 the CCP's SOth.anniversary were published in the
 Chinese press in July 1971.  This time, messages from
 the two competing factions of the Belgian party were
 printed, four from various Italian groups (including
 two from feuding. factions. of. the formerly recognized
 PCI/ML), two from separate groups in the Netherlands,
 Some South American-Marxist-Leninists went ahead
 with a regional conference anyway, which was held, but
 sparsely attended, on 4 September 1970, in Santiago,
 Chile.  They afterward expressed disappointment that
 the Chinese refused to support the idea, and they in-
 dicated that no further meetings would be held.

 three from Germany, and two from Greece.  As for
 Latin America, only a few messages were published,
 coming entirely from parties which apparently had
 little or no factional difficulties.
 Little new information exists as yet on the
 implementation of ILD policy on financing of splinter
 groups as it was expounded in 1970.1
 It would appear that t e ILD's stingy
 financial policy is still in effect.
 There are good indications that China's
 relations with its Communist party and group allies
 are now subordinate to the process of improving the
 PRC's diplomatic status in the world.  It has been

 from pro-Chinese parties in some countries where
 China is attempting to improve diplomatic relations,
 Peru being a prime example.  Neither was any 50th

 Communist Party of Ceylon, the leader of which,
 N. Shanmugathasan, has always received the warmest
 welcome in Peking visits, and whose role in the

 recent disruptions in Ceylon is highly suspect.*
 China and Ceylon have seemed to be making other
 strides to improve state relations, and the CCP has
 repeatedly disavowed any connection between the
 insurgents and themselves.  Although state relations
 with India have not been greatly improved, relatively
 little has been heard in the Chinese press recently
 about the pro-Maoist Naxalite insurgents, who were
 so warmly applauded during the Cultural Revolution.
 Closer to home are the indicators of dwindling
 support for pro-Chinese Communist insurgent parties
 in Thailand, Burma and Malaysia.  Active Chinese
 support for these insurgencies has been apparent for
 several years, with the Chinese supplying publicity
 and moral support, arms, training, sanctuary, and
 sometimes actual leadership to these fraternal
 parties.  Leaders of these parties, particularly
 the Burma Communist Party/White Flag, have
 occasionally been seen in Peking, and seem to have
 residences there.  Recently, the situation has been
 complicated by evidences of a warmin  trend in state
 relations with Burma and Malaysia.
 "Shanmugathasan was arrested during the recent
 disorders, and there is some reason to believe that
 the CCP is annoyed with him.  It seems likely that the
 Chinese, as a further disavowal of their involvement
 in the affair, have decided to avoid public.displays
 of contact with the pro-Peking party for the time being.

 It has also..been.noted that on the occasion
 of the SOth anniverdary of the CCP, the congratula-
 tory messages to China from some insurgent groups in
 Southeast Asia outside Indochina were somewhat subdued;
 the BCP failed to take note of Chinese support and
 assistance for its struggle, as it had in previous
 years, and the Malayan Communist Party proclaimed only
 that "our enemies will never succeed in their attempt
 to undermine the revolutionary unity between the
 Malayan and Chinese Communist Parties..."  It seems
 likely that the Chinese will apply the principles of
 "self-sufficiency" and "self-decision" a little more
 to some of their Asian allies, although they must be
 sensitive to the contradiction between their strong
 espousal of the concept of armed struggle and any
 notable decrease in support.  But in any case, Chinese
 support for all secondary Party.allies appears to
 be tempered by considerations of national interest,
 such as the attempt to improve overall diplomatic
 relations.

 Personnel of the International Liaison Department
 Director
 KENG PIAO
 Keng Piao, a full member
 of the Central Committee of the
 Chinese Communist Party since
 1969, was first reported to be
 Director of the International
 Liaison Department (ILD) of
 the Central Committee of the
 Chinese Communist Party on 8
 March 1971, when he accompanied
 Premier Chou En-lai on a visit
 to North Vietnam (DRV).  This
 article was also the first
 public admission by the Chinese
 that a Party liaison department
 under the direction of the
 Central Committee had been re-
 constructed.
 Keng was born in 1910 in Hunan, and was reportedly
 involved in underground Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
 activities as early as 1925. He was an officer in the
 Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army by 1930, and
 rose rapidly through the ranks.  In 1934 he was a divi-
 sional chief-of-staff in the 1st Front Army of Chu Te,
 then was transferred to the 4th Corps of the 4th Front Army,
 commanded then by Chang Kuo-tao and Hsu Hsiang-chien,
 with whom he participated in the Long March.  After attend-
 ing the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University

 at Yenan in 1937, he became a brigade commander in the
 115th -Division of the 8th Route Army, commanded by Lin
 Piao. *
 Keng is one of the many present Chinese Communist
 foreign affairs officials who took part in the operations
 of the Marshall Mission to China in 1946.  During the
 civil war period, he was chief-of-staff of the Shansi-
 Hopei-Chahar Military District, and later deputy commander
 of the 2nd Army Group of the North China Field Army under
 Yang Te-chih, later reorganized as the 19th Army Group.
 His distinguished diplomatic career began soon
 after the formal establishment of the People's Republic
 of China.  In June 1950, he was posted as China's first
 ambassador to Sweden, and in November of that year was
 named concurrent ambassador to Finland and Denmark,
 posts from which he was relieved in late 1954 and early
 1955, respectively.  In February 1956, Keng traded posts
 with the present vice-foreign minister Han Nien-lung,
 and became China's ambassador to Pakistan, where he
 participated in numerous events contributing to a warming
 of Sino-Pakistani relations.  He held this post until
 December 1959, when he was recalled to Peking and appointed
 deputy foreign minister in charge of relations with the
 nations of Southeast Asia, Nepal and Pakistan.

 In September 1963, Keng became ambassador to Burma,
 where he represented the PRC ably during the high-point
 of Sino-Burmese amicability. He was recalled in early
 1967, and general)  remained out of sight during the Cul-
 tural Revolution)
 Whatever "tests" Keng may have faced during the
 Cultural Revolution, he apparently passed with flying
 colors, as he was elected to the 9th Central Committee
 in April 1969 (one of only two ambassadors to attain this
 Party recognition), and in May was sent to what was then
 perhaps China's most important diplomatic post, the Cli-
 nese embassy in Albania.  Keng was the first ambassador
 to be dispatched in the immediate post-Cultural Revolution
 period, a reflection of his esteem among the top CCP
 leadership.
 In December 1970, Keng was recalled from Tirana
 to Peking, and until the announcement of his appointment
 to the ILD directorship, he was rumored to be in line
 for the Foreign Minister post apparently vacated by
 Chen Yi.
 Since the March visit to Hanoi, Keng has been a
 busy man.  He has met visiting Party delegations from
 the DRV, North Korea (DPRK), Chile, the Laotian Patriotic
 Front (LPF', the South Vietnamese National Liberation
 Front (!'l.;SV), New Zealand, Belgium, France and Rumania,
 sometimes accompanying the leaders on tours of China.
 He has travelled in high-level Chinese government/Party
 delegations to the DRV and DPRK, and has seen off other

 Chinese delegations to Albania, Rumania, and DPRK.  He
 has also attended numerous Communist embassy functions
 in Peking.*
 Keng P9ao's star seems to be definitely on the
 rise.   Until recently, when he has begun to follow Kuo
 Mo-jo, Keng has been listed consistently as first
 after the Politburo members at various official func-
 tions, and at ILD functions, he is frequently listed
 right after Chou En-lai.  On 12 August 1971, he
 received his own 'headline', being the main Chinese
 Communist personage meeting with a Belgian Marxist-
 Leninist Party delegation.
 Keng Piao has to be considered
 one of China's most important, and most visible leaders
 in the foreign affairs apparent, and success in his new
 position may well lead to a higher Party position,
 perhaps even a seat on the Politburo.
 *In one departure from standard protocol and custom,
 he met with a pro-Communist (if not Communist) American
 writer, William Hinton, on 24 July 1971, shortly after
 which Hinton published an authoritative-sounding article
 on Chinese policy towards the United States.

 Deputy Directors:   (the following designations are
 conjectural, not confirmed any-
 where in the Chinese press)
 JEN YUN-CHUNG
 Jen Yun-chung is one of the more mysterious
 figures in the apparent upper levels of the ILD leader-
 ship.  He was first listed in the press as a Deputy
 Political Officer of the Heilungkiang Military District,
 1965-68.     In February 1968, he was noted as having
 been transferred to an unidentified department of the
 central government (along with PLA leaders Kuo Yu-feng
 [see below in high-level Party personnel associated with
 the ILD] and Wang Liang-en, now an MFA "responsible
 person").  Thereafter, txcept.for a virtual disappearance
 during 1969, Jen began to appear frequently with notable
 visiting Communist Party delegations.  During late 1970,
 he made several appearances, mostly with visiting
 Rumanian delegations.*  During this early period of
 ILD work, Jen was usually listed after Shen Chien (see
 below); recently, however, they have been listed first
 among the ILD functionaries rather alternately, with Jen
 being first more often than Shen, though in no obvious
 pattern.  Jen's appearances have multiplied significantly
 in 1971, and particularly since Keng Piao's accession to
 the ILD directorship (corresponding to the unprecedented
 visibility of the department).**  On 3 September 1971
 ota  appearances - 13; in ILD functions after
 20 November - 11.
 **Through August he had made 65 public appearances,
 all but three dealing directly with ILD functions,
 and all but six after the March trip to Hanoi.

 NCNA listed him first among "leading members and staff
 members of the organizations concerned of the Interna-
 tional Liaison Department."  It is possible that he
 was originally brought in to form a revolutionary com-
 mittee for the ILD, or perhaps as a military overseer
 of ILD affairs during the more chaotic period of the
 Cultural Revolution.   During a May 1968 Kang Sheng
 speech to the Military Control Commission of the ILD,
 Jen was identified by name, and made a comment on re-
 organization work.  Due to his consistent position as
 first or second among ILD functionaries at public ap-
 pearances, it seems likely that he is a deputy director
 of the International Liaison Department, and he may
 be the senior deputy.  He is still an active PLA member,
 appearing always in uniform at ILD functions.
 SHEN CHIEN
 Shen Chien is a long-
 standing veteran of the ILD,
 being one of the few who not
 only survived the Cultural
 Revolution, but made several
 public appearances in ILD                      y

 was on 1 May 1971, and the designation has recurred on
 several occasions since then.
 On 14 September 1970, an official North Vietnamese
 newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan, in describing the reception
 of a DRV Par y    iciai visiting Peking, identified
 Shen as "Director of the Forei n Liaison Department of
 the Party Central Committee."
 No further
 mention of Shen as Director appeared in 1970 or prior
 to Keng Piao's March 1971 appointment to that position.*
 Shen Chien has had a long career in various capa-
 cities within the Chinese Communist foreign affairs ap-
 paratus.  Born in Hopeh Province in 1915, he attended
 Peking Normal University ar,d spent one year at Western
 Reserve University in the United States (probably in
 1947).  In 1949, he was reported to be Director of the
 Gereral Administrative Office Secretariat of the People's
 Revolutionary Military Council.  In October 1950, he was
 appointed to be a counselor to the Chinese Embassy in
 New Delhi, India, a post which he held until 1955. From
 1955 to 1960, he served as Deputy Director of the American
 and Australian Affairs Department of the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs  (MFA).  He was sent in November 1960
 - Some observers tie Shen's fate closely to that of
 Kang Sheng on the basis of :uch reports and feel that
 Shen's failure to be appointed publicly to the ILD post
 may reflect Kang's decline. But Shen has not gone
 into eclipse; he has continued to be a very visible
 and active participant in ILD functions, apparently
 at a very high level.

 name is not mentioned in the reports of early disrup-
 tions within the ILD, during which, in 1965-66, much
 of its top leadership was removed, it is likely that Shen
 was in political trouble during the period of his dis-
 appearance.  However, by the time the foreign affairs
 apparatus began to undergo its most severe shakeups; and
 during which time most of the rest of the ILD leadership
 went down, Shen seems to have re-emerged in good stand-
 ing.              His first public reappearance was to welcome Hsieh
 Fu-chin and his delegation back from their ordeal at
 Wuhan in July 1967, and he has continued to make public
 appearances at ILD functions without interruption ever
 since that time.
 In addition to his ILD responsibilities, Shen is
 also President of the China-Cuba Friendship Association,
 and has been called upon to participate in numerous
 activities in that capacity.  Shen is the most active
 of the known ILD members, and has been for some time.
 He is probably a deputy director; he greets nearly
 every major Communist Party delegation that visits
 China  and often accom anies them on tours of the coun-

 although it would appear that he has been declining in
 importance since Keng's appointment as director.
 Whereas previously he was invariably listed along with
 (but after) Shen Chien in greeting important delega-
 tions, recently he has been absent from functions of
 the type at which he appeared in 1970, such as the June
 1971 visit of Rumania's state and Party leader Nicolae
 Ceausescu.  Instead Yang has been seen with delegations
 of fairly low priority and prestige, such as youth
 groups, along with new and low-ranking members of the
 ILD.  Although he did not appear with other ILD members
 at the 1971 May Day celebrations, he was listed after
 Jen Yun-chung and Shen Chien at the 1971 celebration
 of the anniversary of the PLA on August 1.  His present
 status, therefore, is uncertain.
 Yang also has not seemed to have any geographic
 specialization, although recently he has met few dele-
 gations other than Indochinese and Albanian.  There is
 some speculation that h,' is a member of the security
 apparatus.
 Chang Tsang is one of the most shadowy figures

 Chekiang Province in 1914, Chang became "visible" in
 1950, when he was reported as the Director of the Marx-
 Lenin Institute in Peking.  He attended the British
 Communist Party Congress in 1959, and continued to be
 active in liaison affairs thereafter, particularly in
 front organizations such as the'.Werld Peace Council
 and the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization.  Chang also
 travelled to Japan on several occasions, and was a
 member of Liu Ding-i's 1965 deie;ation to an anti-
 nuclear bomb conference in Japan -- a dele                             ion which
 was denied entry with great publicity.  He i.ad also
 been denied entry to Japan when he travelled there with
 Peng Chen to attend a JCP congress in 1964.  On that
 occasion, he was.:identified as "Chief of the Japanese
 Affairs Section, International Department of the CCP
 Politburo."  Chang is also the director of the Asia-
 Africa Society of China.
 Nothing is known of Chang's status or activities
 during the Cultural Revolution, though it could bess-
 sumed that, due to his close association with Peng Chen,
 Liu Ning-i, and other ILD leaders, he probably came
 under some fire.  However, he survived, reappeared in
 1969, and has been active in ILD functions ever since.
 Though he has met Communist delegations from many coun-
 tries, he seems primarily concerned with Asian nations,
 particularly North Korea and Japan.  Though his status
 as a Deputy Director is open to question, his ILD af-
 filiation is not, and he may be in charge of a (hypo-
 thetical) bureau for Japan/Korea affairs.  Recently,
 he has been seen most often with visiting groups of
 Japanese "friends."

 TANG MING-CHAO
 Tang Ming-chao is another
 of the few persons who has been
 associated with the ?LD in open
 source material.  On 6 May 1971,
 Tang was identified as a "leading
 functionary" of the ILD, accompany-
 ing the Secretary-General of the
 New Zealand Communist Party (CPNZ),
 V.G. Wilcox.
 Tang has had perhaps one
 of the more varied and interesting
 careers of the known ILD members.  Born in Kwangtung
 Province in 1910, he was educated at Tsinghua University,
 then in 1934 moved to the United States.  He spent 16
 years in the US, where he attended the University of
 California, became a citizen, edited a Chinese-language
 newspaper, and even did some work for the US Army (in
 1^44).  He returned to the Mainland in 1950 and became
 active in Chinese "peace" delegation activities and the
 Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations
 with Foreign Countries.  He was also active in the Na-
 tional People's Congress, the Afro-Asian Solidarity
 Committee, and was editor of China Reconstructs in 1962.
 After 1963, he was referred to as a leading mem er of
 an (unidentified) department of the Central Committee.
 He disappeared during the Cultural Revolution, but, un-
 like his longtime friend and suspected ILD associate
 Lin Tang, he survived it.  He re-emerged in April 1970

 and has been making numerous appearances at ILD func-
 tions since that time.
 If it is warranted to assume that the ILD is
 functionally organized similarly to the MFA, Tang could
 probably be considered to be head of the West Europe
 and Australo-American Affairs section of the ILD.  If
 so, it is probably due primarily to his fluency in
 English and his past experience.  He has appeared with
 Communist delegations from Belgium, New Zealand, Great
 Britain, Australia, Italy, France and the United States.
 Recently, he has met with delegations from a US Black
 Workers' Conference and with William Hinton.  In the
 early 1960s, he did a considerable amount of foreign
 travel to World Peace Congress and Afro-Asian Solidarity
 Organization conferences and various Communist Party
 congresses.  He is now with Peking's UN delegation.
 MAO PAO-CHUNG
 Mao Pao-chung first appeared in ILD-type functions
 in October 1968, when he had contacts with DRV -,;id
 Albanian Communists.  He then disappeared from public
 view until March 1971, when he began to make appearances
 with Indochinese Communists from the Laotian Patriotic
 Front, North Vietnamese Workers Party, and NLFSV.  He
 has appeared very frequently since then, with several
 important visiting Communist Party delegations.  He
 seems, however, to be primarily concerned with North
 Vietnamese Communists, and could be placed in the Indo-
 china section, if such exists, of the ILD.  His presence
 at other functions may indicate that he is head of
 that bureau.  He was listed second among "leading mem-
 bers and staff members" of the ILD, who met with a
 French Marxist-Leninist group on 3 September 1971, and
 again with a JCP (L) group one week later.

 CHAO HSUEH-LI
 Chao Hsueh-li, who was formerly in the Chinese
 embassy in Switzerland (1965-1968), has recently met
 visiting Belgian and French Marxist-Leninist Party
 delegations.  On 10 September 1971, he was identified
 in a NCNA release as a "leading functionary" of the
 ILD, accompanying the French delegation on a tour of
 China.  With his previous experience, it is conceiv-
 able that Chao is the head of a West European sub-
 section of Tang Ming-chao's ex-bureau.
 TIEN SHU-CHIEN
 Tien Shu-chien is one of the many new faces in
 the ILD, making his first public appearance in April
 1971, when he greeted a delegation from Japan.  On 11
 May 1971, he was identified as a "responsible working
 person" of the ILD, while accompanying a DPRK Trade
 Union delegation visiting China along with Chang Hsiang-
 shan.  He has since appeared several times, almost
 always in connection with Korean delegations or Chinese
 delegations going to Korea, leading to the conclusion
 that he is perhaps a Korean interpreter for the ILD.
 He may be higher than that, however, since he has more
 recently appeared with a Vietnamese group.
 YANG CHUN-CHENG
 Yang Chun-cheng was also identified as a "respon-
 sible working person" for the ILD during the May 1971
 visit of the Korean trade union delegation.  He has
 since appeared exclusivley with known ILD members,

 solely in connection with DPRK affairs.  He appears to
 be an interpreter, Korean, perhaps in Chang Hsiang-
 shan's department for Japan/Korea Affairs.
 HSIAO HUANG
 Hsiao Huang, another new ILD functionary, began
 to make numerous appearances along with other ILD per-
 sonalities in March 1971.  He has appeared almost ex-
 clusively with VWP, NLFSV, and LPF delegations, indicat-
 ing that he is either a Vietnamese interpreter, or,
 more likely, in the Indochina Bureau of the ILD.  On
 10 September 1971, he was listed after known ILD mem-
 bers Jen Yun-chung and Mao Pao-chung in meeting a
 JCP(L) group.
 YAO SHIH-KEN
 Yao Shih-ken has met delegations from Belgian
 and French Marxist-Leninist parties, KWP, VWP, and NLFSV.
 He is probably a low-level functionary, being last in
 the 3 September 1971 listing of "leading members and
 staff members of the organizations concerned of The
 International Liaison Department of the CCP Central
 Committee."

 Other Possible ILD Members
 TSAO I-OU
 Tsao I-ou is a full member of the Central Com-
 mittee, and is perhaps best known as the wife of Kang
 Sheng, the former Politburo supervisor and probably
 virtual director of the ILD during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.               Tsao began to make public appearances in ILD
 functions soon after her 'coming-out' in 1.966, during
 the early stages of the Cultural Revolution.  Through-
 out the Cultural Revolution, she greeted nearly all the
 important Communist- and Marxist-Leninist delegations
 who visited China, along with Kang and Kuo Yu-fens           25X1
 (see below).  In a 1970
 Tsao was vraised  highly and iden-      25X1

 committee" concerned with -- or one of -- the CCP's
 central departments.
 After Kang Sheng's disappearance in late November
 1970, Tsao's public appearances became less frequent,
 although she has continued to appear in evident favor.
 In April 1971, she met with V.G. Wilcox and his CPNZ
 delegation, and in June she was present at the meeting

 security apparatus.  In March/April 1966, he accompanied
 Liu Shao-chi and Chen Yi to Pakistan while the Cultural
 Revolution was gathering steam.  That was his last
 recorded appearance until June 1970, when he met an
 Albanian government/Party delegation.
 Feng is rather a tentative member of the ILD,
 and still makes frequent appearances in MFA-type func-
 tions.  However, whenever he appears at a major Party
 gathering, such as meeting an important delegation or on
 National Day, he always appears along with known ILD
 members, often listed immediately after Shen Chien.
 He may be in a post for coordination with the MFA,
 or with whatever political security apparatus now
 exists, or with the Investigation Department (foreign
 intelligence).  Liao Ho-shu places Feng as deputy
 director of the Investigation Department, but there
 is no confirmation of this.
 Chu is a suspected ILD member
 He is identified in the press
 as a "responsible person" of an unidentified depart-
 ment of the Central Committee.  Chu appeared in September
 1969, and began making numerous appearances at ILD
 functions, listed always after Shen Chien and Yang Yu-
 heng.  After January 1971, Chu dropped out of sight,
 but he reappeared, in apparent favor, in November 1971.
 Chu, like Jen Yun-chung, was mentioned by name in a
 1968 Red Flag report of Kang Sheng's speech to the
 Military Control Group of the "XX Department" (appar-
 ently the ILD), indicating that he has a PLA background,

 committee in the ILD.   His present post is unknown;
 it is uncertain whether her still an active'ILD
 member.
 Liu Ke-ming has been reported as a member of the
 "1.st Bureau" of the ILD, dealing with Soviet and FAst
 European affairs.  He was mentioned in the Rumanian press
 as the "deputy general secretary of the foreign rela-
 tions department of the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China" on 2 September 1970.  It would
 appear that he still holds this type of position, judg-
 ini by his recent public appearances.  During the past
 two years, his only public appearances have been with
 Party delegations to or from Albania and Rumania, the
 most notable being his presence  during the meeting
 between Nicolae Ceausescu and Mao Tse-tung in June 1971.
 He has, however, made only seven appearances thus far
 in 1971, which could lead to some doubt as to his posi-
 tion.
 Liu Chun-fa has apparently been with the ILD
 since sometime in 1969, as he began to meet delegations
 from the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front
 (NLFSV) in September of that year, and also sent his
 condolences to the DRV embassy in Peking on the death
 of Ho Chi Minh.  He made only one appearance in 1970,
 but reappeared in June and July of 1971, meeting
 Rumanian and Korean delegations.  There is ha:..,dly
 enough inforamtion even to speculate on his position,
 although his ILD affiliation would seem probable from
 his repeated public appearances with known ILD members.

 having made his first (and last-known) appearances in
 April-May 1971, when he met Party delegations from
 Belgium, New Zealand, and Laos.  Taiwan's monthly
 Studies on Chinese Communism identified Ma as an ILD
 fu functionary i-'n it June 1971*issue (page 143).  However,
 too little information is available to do more than
 speculate on Mass  functional or hierarchical position.

 exists to support speculation.

 have its own staff of interpreters, then Huang Chun can
 also
 be presumed to be an ILD functionary .  He first
 appeared hi  in May 1971, and was listed b as an interpreter..
 All   s subsequent appearances have been with known or

 as a Vietnamese interpreter.

 965-1966 until his disappearance in November 1970
 ,
 Kang was the man ultimately in charge of implementing
 Mao's policies toward "fraternal" Communist Parties.
 He met every Communist Party/government delegation
 from China's major allies, and nearly all of the known
 Marxist-Leninist splinter ?arty delegations that visited
 China.  In addition, he travelled to Albania in 1966
 to a Party meeting there.

 (or Politburo-level supervisor), usually in
 charge of briefing the visiting delegations on CCP and
 PCR policy and activities.
 Kang, who had a leading role in Party-rebuilding
 at least until late 1969, was in charge of the reorgani-
 zation of the ILD after its top leadership was purged
 or criticized in the Cultural Revolution.  In a speech
 carried in the Canton Red Flag Bulletin (Hun -ch'i T'un -
 hsin) of July 1968, Kang a  resse:d himsel to the prob-
 lems of reforming the "XX Ministry" (clearly the ILD,
 since Wang Chia-hsiang, Wu Hsiu-chuan, Chao I-min and
 Liu Ning-i are mentioned as former leaders) through the

 application of Mao's thought.* An earlier Red Guard
 poster, noted on 12 May 1967, reported other incidents
 in which Kang showed concern with the internal workings
 of the ILD, namely condemning Wu Hsiu-chuan and defend-
 ing Liu Ning-i (appointed as head of the ILD in March
 1966).  In a briefing to Chilean Communist delegates in
 July 1970, Kang again discussed the reorganization of
 the ILD.  During some of the more chaotic periods of
 the ILD's Cultural Revolution experience, Kang may have
 served as the actual head of the department.
 Kang's actual influence on the activities and
 policies of the ILD are difficult to determine.  It is
 apparent that policy changes were made similar to those
 made in other departments during the Cultural Revolution,
 namely drawing policies and operations more closely
 within limits determined by Mao's ideology.  Ideological
 purity (by Maoist standards) began to be stressed more
 heavily.  In line with post-Cultural Revolution Maoist
 ideology and tactics, various Parties began to be urged
 by Kang to become more self-sufficient and less reliant
 on financial aid and political advice from China.
 Kang Sheng's decline after the winter of 1969-70
 apparently has affected the ILD.  Great changes appear
 to have been made in the organization and functions of
 the department since Kang has been gone.  A new director
 has been appointed, a man with no known relationship
 to Kang Sheng, and Kang's own proteges (with the exception
 of Shen Chien) seem to have been quietly removed from
 positions of influence within the department.  It is
 believed by some observers that the ILD is now a much
 en  un-c ung and Chu Ta-cheng made comments during
 the speech, which is described as being delivered to
 the "Military Control Group of the XX Ministry on May
 30, 1968."

 Party delegations from several European and Asian coun-
 tries.

 "responsible person" on the Peking Municipal Revolu-
 tionary Committee.  He was named an alternate member
 of the Central Committee in April 1969.  In 1971, he
 ceased to be listed with the known ILD members, and
 ceased appearing at ILD functions (the last being greet-
 ing the British Marxist-Leninist Party on their tour
 f China in December 1970).  Since then, he has been

 the )rganization Department. It would appear that, with
 the ILD now a going concern under a reliable man, Kuo's
 presence in the ILD is no longer required.
 During the course of his
 spectacular rise in the hier-
 archy of the CCP, Politburo
 member and Secretary of the
 Shanghai Municipal Party Commit-
 tee Yao Wen-yuan has taken on
 a number of important respon-
 sibilities in addition to his
 official Shanghia duties.  The
 most important of these has been
 the supervision of the regime's
 entire propaganda apparatus.
 However, one of his new respon-
 sibilities has been meeting
 with Party delegations that
 visit Peking from other countries.  Yao began to appear
 at ILD-type functions with Kang Sheng during October 1970,
 and has continued attending such functions in the absense
 of the latter.  After a two-month absence from Peking
 in early 1971, during which time he was in Shanghai, Yao
 continued to meet both high-level and low-level foreign
 Communist delegations, often along with ILD members.
 In nearly every case, he has been mentioned as being
 a participant in any substantive discussions that took
 place between the Chinese and their visitors.  This
 was notable during the Ceausescu visit to China in June
 1971.  It is possible that, in spite of Keng Piao's
 Party position, it is still considered necessary for
 the ILD to have a Politburo-level supervisor.   If so, Yao
 may be that supervisor, perhaps with help from Chang Chun-
 chiao.  Although Yao's only travel experience outside of

 China was in a Red Guard delegation to Albania, which
 he led in 1967, many observers believe that Yao has
 taken over Kang's role.
 CHANG CHUN-CHIAO
 Chang Chun-chiao, Politburo member and 1st Secre-
 tary of the Shanghai Party Committee, is also frequently
 present in Peking, and often in attendance at ILD func-
 tions.                           Though he is of slightly higher rank than Yao
 Wen-yuan (they are respectively fifth and sixth among
 active Politburo members) and is always listed before
 Yao whenever the two are together at a foreign affairs
 function, it would appear that, at least as far as liai-
 son work is concerned, Yao is somewhat more closely
 concerned.  In particular, while Chang often meets with
 important foreign delegations, and sometimes escorts them
 around China, Yao Wen-yuan is invariably listed as
 being present during the actual discussions, whereas
 Chang almost never is.  Chang has met delegations,
 beginning about October 1970, from New Zealand, DPRK,
 DRV, NLFSV, Rumania, Cambodia (Sihanouk), Japan, and
 the US (Hinton).  However, his participation in ILD
 functions is sporadic, and his presence may be more due
 to his Party rank than ILD affiliation.
 WU FA-HSIEN
 Wu Fa-lisien, the portly, frog-faced commander
 of the PLA Air Force and Deputy Chief of Staff of the
 PLA, was making appearances at foreign affairs, and
 particularly ILD functions, from about 1967 until his
 apparent fall in September 1971.  In 1969, he was men-

 wife) Kuo Yu-feng, and Shen Chien.  Even in Kang's
 absence, Wu continued to make frequent appearances E.long
 with ILD ::*embers. He was the only military member of
 the Politbura to do so consistently.
 Chi Teng-kuei, an alternate member of the CCP
 Politburo and a deputy secretary of the Honan Provin-
 cial Party Committee, is a little-known figure.  Since
 1970, he has frequently appeared at foreign affairs and
 ILD functions.  He was tapped by Mao himself for the
 Politburo, and may be close to Chou En-lai.  He has also
 been associated with Keng Piao in briefing visiting
 Communist delegations, and open sources have noted his
 frequent performance of liaison duties.
 Chang Shih-chung was named an alternate member
 of the Central Committee in April 1969, as a representa-
 tive of the "workers."  He has also been selected as a
 member of the Peking Party Committee and was. a leading
 member of the Conference of Representatives of Peking
 Revolutionary Workers. He connection to the ILD seems
 to be in his consistent appearance with workers' dele-
 gations which visit China, particularly from Communist
 countries.  He has also met Communist Party delegations
 from Great r3ritain, Albania, and Rumania, as well as
 the Hinton group from the US.

 holds or will hold an important rank in a liaison

 LID H5I-CHANG
 Liu Hsi-chang is another member of the Peking
 Municipal Committee and the Conference of Representatives
 of Peking Revolutionary Workers who has had some deal-
 ings with ILD members at foreign affairs functions.
 Rising through the ranks of Revolutionary Rebels during
 the Cultural Revolution, he was elected as a "worker"
 representative to the 9th Central Committee.  His liaison
 work has consisted of meeting various Communist Party
 delegations, seeing worker delegations off to various
 Communist allies nations (he was himself in a delega-
 tion led by Yao Wen-yuan to Albania in 1967), and meet-
 ing trade union delegations visiting China.  His exact
 relation to the ILD cannot be estimated at this time,
 but it is perhaps significant that he has made so many
 appearances with known ILD personnel.
