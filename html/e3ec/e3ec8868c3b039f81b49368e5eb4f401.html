 An anti-intellectual, almost Orwellian atmosphere
 prevails in Communist China today.   This is a product
 of a three-year campaign which reflects Mao Tse-tung's
 personal conviction that intellectuals as a group
 share Soviet "revisionist" ideas,  that they would
 work against the regime at every opportunity and that
 draconian "reforms" are necessary.
 The Chinese scorn as soft the Soviet practice
 of punishing a few individual intellectuals for dis-
 sident attitudes.   Peking assumes that all intellec-
 tuals are dissidents, and is forcing all but the most
 essential to engage in long,  punishing stints of hard
 physical labor.   Intellectuals must spend most of
 their "free time" at political lectures and in super-
 vised study of the works of Mao Tse-tung.   They are
 repeatedly told that their sole concern is to glorify
 Mao Tse-tung and Communism and to provide justifica-
 tion for Mao's militant attacks on "class enemies at
 home and abroad."  No freedom of. intellectual expres-
 sion is permitted,                                    and it goes without saying that
 nothing of artistic merit is produced in China today.
 Intellectuals considered "necessary"--scientists,
 technicians,  and some government cadres--are allowed
 to work with less interference, but,  if the propa-
 ganda is to be believed,  even these groups now spend
 long hours every week doing physical labor and study-
 ing Mao's works.
 The Unfolding of the Campaign
 The present campaign against
 the intellectuals stems from de-
 cisions made at the tenth plenum
 of the central committee in Sep-
 tember 1962.   The previous two
 years had been a period of re-
 laxation, when the regime,  its
 prestige at a low ebb because
 of the disastrous effects of the
 Leap Forward and anti-Soviet
 policies,  played down ideologi-
 cal themes and allowed intellec-
 tuals to engage in "constructive"

 criticism of cultural and eco-
 nomic policies.   This permis-
 sive period ended in September
 1962 when Peking announced that
 it intended to turn China into
 a bastion of Marxist purity and
 to wage an all-out struggle
 against "revisionism and im-
 perialism" abroad and against
 "revisionist," capitalist,  and
 bourgeois inclinations at home.
 Once again Peking began assert-
 ing that intellectuals had to
 be "Red" as well as "expert."

 It is doubtful if the re-
 gime then knew how fast it could
 proceed in remolding intellec-
 tuals.   It spent late 1962 and
 all of 1963 carefully setting
 new guidelines for cultural and
 academic workers.   They were
 told over and over again in
 party and cultural journals that
 the sharpening "class struggle"
 dictated a new across-the-board
 "revolutionary" approach.   Pre-
 viously approved literature and
 philosophical concepts were de-
 clared heretical.   Unnamed
 writers were denounced for at-
 tempting to portray "real" flesh
 and blood characters and were
 told to stick to party-approved
 stereotypes, bourgeois villains
 and revolutionary heroes.   West-
 ern music was declared "bour-
 geois."   Even China's "cultural
 legacy"--revered classic novels
 and popular traditional operas--
 was disparaged.   Peking felt
 these novels and operas portrayed
 feudal characters too favorably
 and were irrelevant to current
 issues.   Social scientists such
 as philosophers and historians
 were attacked for ignoring the
 class struggle and told that
 henceforth their chief task
 would be to provide "justifica-
 tion" for the need for harsher
 social controls.
 The hardening attitude to-
 ward intellectuals was summed
 up by Chou Yang,  deputy direc-
 tor of the propaganda department
 of the central committee, in a
 speech published on 26 December
 1963, Mao's 70th birthday.   Chou
 Yang set as the "fighting task"
 of intellectuals the refutation
 of "modern revisionism and bour-
 geois ideology in all its mani-
 festations on the academic front."
 The speech set forth a dictum
 by Mao, soon to be widely pub-
 licized, that "one always splits
 into two."   This dictum has been
 used to "explain" the widening
 Sino-Soviet split and the de-
 cision to sharpen attacks on
 allegedly hostile "class enemies"
 inside China.
 Following the publication
 of Chou Yang's speech,  the cam-
 paign to remold intellectual
 and cultural activities moved
 out of the discussion stage.
 Early in 1964 the regime ordered
 a total ban on traditional
 operas.   They were replaced by
 a hybrid form of opera that used
 traditional devices to portray
 revolutionary themes and char-
 acters.                                                                    Village story-tellers
 were told to replace their re-
 pertoire of popular stories
 with recitations of atrocities
 formerly committed by landlords
 or examples of selfless behavior
 of revolutionary heroes like the
 soldier-martyr Lei Feng.   Novels,
 plays, and movies produced under
 the party's imprimatur in recent
 years were condemned for their
 lack of "revolutionary realism,"
 and were replaced.   Peking told
 opera buffs that if they found
 fault with the new operas and
 plays,  this proved they were
 "reactionary."

 In mid-1964 the party atti-
 tude toward intellectuals became
 markedly more hostile, partly
 as a result of the worsening
 Sino-Soviet dispute,   Also in
 mid-1964,  Peking intensified the
 struggle against "revisionists"
 both at home and in the inter-
 national Communist movement and
 hardened both its domestic and
 foreign policies.   These policies
 presumably resulted from deci-
 sions reached at a "special work
 conference" of the central com-
 mittee presided over by Mao in
 June 1964--the first high-level
 party gathering announced since
 the tenth plenum.
 In retrospect, mid-1964 ap-
 pears to have been a watershed
 for policy toward intellectuals.
 The regime had hitherto consid-
 ered them reformable,  but it
 now seemed to reach the convic-
 tion that,  as a class,  they were
 incorrigibly "revisionist" and
 antagonistic to Maoist ideals.
 This change reflects Mao's own
 views.   Foreigners who talked
 to him in late 1964 report that
 he complained bitterly of the
 unreliability of students and
 scholars, and a senior official
 in the Ministry of Culture re-
 ported in early 1965 that Mao
 was saying that "the intellec-
 tuals have never aligned them-
 selves with us."
 In mid-1964 the regime be-
 gan accusing prominent individ-
 uals of having deliberately
 spread "revisionist" ideas.   The
 most notable victim was Yang
 Hsien-chen, low-ranking member
 of the party central committee
 and head of the Higher Party
 School until 1961.   In August
 1964 the authoritative party
 journal Red Flag accused Yang
 of propaing the anti-Maoist
 doctrine that "two merge into
 one," and thus providing a philo-
 sophical basis for a policy of
 reconciling class conflicts at
 home and international conflicts
 abroad.   Red Flag said that Yang
 was attempting to perform the
 same role that the philosopher
 Deborin had played in support-
 ing the "Trotsky-Bukharin anti-
 party group" in the USSR.   This
 was the label given to victims
 of the Stalin purge of 1937.
 Throughout the summer and
 fall of 1964 other personalities
 criticized for advocating "re-
 visionism" included Feng Ting,
 professor of dialectical materi-
 alism at Peking University and
 vice chairman of the university's
 philosophy department;   Chou
 Ku-cheng,  a prominent historian
 and a member of the presidium
 of the Peasant and Worker's
 Democratic Party; Yang Han-sheng,
 vice chairman of the All-China
 Federation of Literary and Art
 Circles and motion picture script
 writer; Ou-yang Shan,  a noted
 pre-1949 novelist; and Shao
 Chuan-lin,  vice chairman of the
 Union of Chinese Writers,
 These were all prominent
 intellectuals who had written
 considerable party-approved ma-
 terial in the 1950s and early
 1960s.   Feng Ting, for example,
 is the author of The Communist
 View of Life, a textbook pu -

 clearly represented the main-
 stream of cultural work before
 1963, the party was implicating
 all intellectuals.
 The party has always stressed
 the moral value of manual labor,
 but "labor reform" in the past
 was usually assigned only to
 persons considered backward "right-
 ists."   In mid-1964,  however,
 the regime issued directives or-
 dering all students, scholars,
 and government employees engaged
 in "mental work" to spend at
 least one month a year doing
 hard, physical labor.   These di-
 rectives were promptly and rigor-
 ously applied.   In practice most
 labor assignments appear to have
 been for about three months.   In
 addition, university students
 after graduation were to do man-
 ual labor for a full year before
 assignment.
 Premier Chou En-lai in his
 December 1964 report to the Na-
 tional People's Congress provided
 further indications of party
 policy toward the intellectuals.
 Speaking of a "great debate" that
 had been carried on in the fields
 of philosophy,  history,  educa-
 tion, culture, and art, Chou an-
 nounced that "initial" results
 had been achieved in combating
 erroneous theories, with the
 clear implication that the party
 was going to try for more. Accord-
 ing to Chou,  the "torrent of
 revolution" would allow no slack-
 ening in an intellectual's at-
 tempt to reform himself, and
 Chou prescribed going among the
 workers, peasants and soldiers
 for "long periods" as the prime
 means of reform.
 Chou's remarks were ampli-
 f ied by a
 in Paris in January
 1965 that new disciplinary ac-
 tion against dissident intellec-
 tuals had been approved at a
 meeting of top leaders in Decem-
 ber 1964.                                                             The       official
 said that the regime, reluctant
 to shed blood, had instead de-
 cided to launch a "movement
 peaceful stru gle."
 Mao--complaining
 1 that a plan for cultural action
 first proposed in 1942 had not
 been supported by "certain lead-
 ers"--had ordered a complete
 new reform of cultural organiza-
 tions.   Presumably, Lu Ting-i,
 politburo member and director
 of the propaganda department of
 the central committee, was charged
 with responsibility for carrying
 out these reforms.   In January
 1965 Lu was appointed minister
 of culture, replacing Shen Yen-
 ping (Mao Tun), perhaps China's
 greatest novelist, who had held
 the position since 1949. I
 Mao Tun was removed b

 In 1965 the party for the
 first time since the Great Leap
 Forward began publicly express-
 ing concern over the political
 attitudes of scientists and
 technicians.   In January 1965
 Red Flag demanded that scientists,
 lie everyone else,  treat the
 "class struggle" as their fore-
 most task,  and warned that the
 party would be unable to make
 full use of the services of scien-
 tists who tried to stay aloof

 from politics.   In June,  this
 theme was followed up by Chien
 Hsueh-sen, US-trained rocket
 specialist and probably China's
 foremost scientist, who apolo-
 gized for having personally be-
 littled politics in the past.
 Chien warned that scientists
 must not consider themselves an
 elite group, but must humbly
 study Mao's ideas and engage in
 manual labor.
 In the summer of 1965 Red
 Flag published several important
 articles which attacked promi-
 nent Western scientists--includ-
 ing Niels Bohr, Werner Heisen-
 berg,                             and Linus Pauling--for
 philosophical failings.   Scien-
 tists were exhorted to rely less
 on Western science and more on
 Mao's revolutionary tracts for
 guidance in their research work.
 Another sign of the anti-
 intellectual atmosphere in mid-
 1965 was a statement by Tao Chu,
 powerful head of the party's
 Central-South bureau,  defending
 the right of the Chinese Commu-
 nist regime to repress cultural
 activities.   Noting that most
 people have always condemned
 ,the "First Emperor"  (Chin Shih
 Huang Ti)  for "burning the books
 and burying the scholars alive,"
 Tao stated that any regime had
 the right to do such things to
 strengthen its control,  and that
 "we,  the proletariat," have the
 same right.
 Current Policy
 A series of party pro-
 nouncements in 1966 have spelled
 out in the harshest terms pos-
 sible the current party atti-
 tude toward intellectuals.  The
 most definitive statement to
 date appeared in a bitterly
 anti-intellectual manifesto
 published on 1 January in Red
 Flag.   Again,  as in 1963,  the
 spokesman was Chou Yang,  deputy
 director of the propaganda de-
 partment of the central commit-
 tee.   Chou,  echoing views which
 Mao had privately expressed,
 charged that the overwhelming
 majority of intellectuals,  in-
 cluding even those who are mem-
 bers of the Communist Party,
 had received a bourgeois educa-
 tion,  retain bourgeois ideas
 in their world outlook,  and
 think they are strong enough
 to challenge the party.
 Chou claimed that cultural
 workers had unsuccessfully re-
 sisted party leadership five
 times since 1949.   Dates listed
 were 1951  (The Story of Wu Hsun),
 1954  (Dream of the Red Chamber),
 1954-1955 (Hu Feng),  1957 ("Hun-
 dred Flowers")  and 1961-1962
 ("Second Hundred Flowers").
 Chou described the alleged at-
 tack by intellectuals in 1961-
 62 as the strongest and most
 dangerous of the five,  and
 promised that the party's coun-
 terattack would be unprecedently
 harsh.   Chou, of course,  ignored
 the fact that the party had ac-
 tually relaxed its strictures on
 intellectual expression in 1961-
 62,                                                                      and that all evidence indi-
 cates that intellectuals were
 extremely careful not to exceed
 the bounds of expression then
 in effect.

 Chou attempted to portray
 intellectuals as potential trait-
 ors by drawing a parallel between
 Hungary in 1956 and the present
 situation in China.   "When the
 counterrevolutionary  elements
 revolted in Hungary in 1956 and
 wanted to overthrow the dictator-
 ship of the proletariat there was
 the Petofy Club,  that is,  a
 clique of revisionist bourgeois
 literary and art people and in-
 tellectuals,  which acted as the
 vanguard."   Chou warned that  in-
 tellectuals could be made the
 tools of the bourgeoisie who
 through the "trick of peaceful
 evolution" would try to overthrow
 the revolution.   According to
 Chou,  the scheming of class
 enemies had been effective in
 the Soviet Union,  and "when the
 cart in front overturns,  this
 should serve as a warning to the
 carts behind."
 On 1 February 1966 Peking--
 for the first time since the anti-
 rightist campaign of 1957-58--
 began to name names in charges
 that leading cultural figures
 were deliberately working to sub-
 vert the regime.   People's Daily
 accused Tien Han,  c airman o =e
 Chinese Drama Workers'  Union and
 composer of China's national
 anthem,  and Wu Han,  prominent
 historial and vice mayor of Pe-
 king since 1949,               of attacking
 the party through the medium of
 historical dramas.    The "anti-
 party" charge,  by implication,
 was directed at intellectuals
 in general.   In a full-page dis-
 section of Tien Han's work,  the
 story of an imaginary heroine
 of the Tang Dynasty  (618-907),
 People's Daily accused him of
 saying in 1961 that the inter-
 ests of the party do not coin-
 cide with the interests of the
 people and that the party op-
 presses the people.
 On 24 February People's
 Daily carried further    e im-
 putaion of traitorous activi-
 ties to intellectuals by imply-
 ing collusion between Tien Han
 and Chiang Kai-shek.   It noted
 that two 1956 articles by Tien
 Han,  which could be interpreted
 as critical attacks on regime
 cultural policies, were re-
 printed and circulated by Kuomin-
 tang propagandists in Hong Kong
 in 1957.
 Wu Han,  in a long self-
 criticism in December,  pleaded
 that in his 1961 play, Hai Jui
 Is Dismissed From Office, tTe
 work-for whic   Fe i ow being
 pilloried, he had simply "for-
 gotten" the "class struggle."
 Wu Han conceded that he had
 granted virtues to his Ming
 Dynasty official hero and not
 painted the bourgeoisie all
 black.   Since December, People's
 Daily and Red Flag have puub-
 is ed numerous denunciations
 of Wu Han's self-criticism as
 an attempt to counterattack the
 party.   According to Peking,
 Wu Han has "actively joined
 the anti-Marxist and antiso-
 cialist chorus" and the play in
 question was deliberately in-
 tended to propagate these views.

 To date the party's wrath
 has fallen much more heavily on
 intellectuals in social sciences
 and the arts than on natural
 scientists and technicians, but
 mistrust of this latter group
 is growing.   One segment of this
 group--medical workers--has been
 treated surprisingly harshly
 during recent months.   In Febru-
 ary 1966 Lu Ting-i, director of
 the propaganda department of the
 central committee, explained
 that the new policy toward medi-
 cal workers resulted from the
 regime's conclusion that the
 health field was a special pre-
 serve of intellectuals.   Medical
 workers, he said, are "notorious
 for... upholding individualism,
 looking down on the laboring
 people,  resenting hardship,  and
 being haughty,  egotistic, and
 subjective."
 The indicated solution was
 for medical personnel to spend
 more time in rural areas, both
 serving on roving medical teams
 and working in the fields side
 by side with the peasants.   In
 early 1965 the regime had begun
 assigning urban doctors to rov-
 ing medical teams that served
 for two to five months in the
 countryside.   The announced pur-
 pose then,  however, was mainly
 to raise rural health standards
 and improve party-peasant rela-
 tions; ideological reform.of
 medical personnel was secondary.
 No further change in policy
 toward scientists in general was
 evident in early 1966.   Party
 journals continued to harp on
 their ideological shortcomings,
 and reiterated old complaints
 Page   7
 about scientists who place
 "blind faith" in Western science,
 do not consult the "masses," and
 do not assiduously apply Mao's
 thinking.
 Manual Labor for All
 Chou Yang in his anti-in-
 tellectual diatribe of January
 1966 decreed drastic and vin-
 dictive measures to counter the
 alleged threat posed by intel-
 lectuals.   They would, he said,
 participate to a much greater
 extent than before in hard phy-
 sical labor, in effect becoming
 "part-time intellectuals," while
 spending much of their remain-
 ing time in political indoctrina-
 tion meetings or in supervised
 study of the works of Mao.
 On 22 February People's
 Daily announced that 160000
 workers in the fields of litera-
 ture and art are now engaged
 in agricultural and industrial
 labor for an indefinite period.
 This figure does not include
 movie projection teams and other
 basic-level cultural groups who
 work in the rural areas through-
 out the year.   People's Daily
 further reported tthaat steps were
 being taken to establish a reg-
 ular system whereby all urban-
 based writers and artists would
 spend one third to one half
 their time each year in physical
 labor.   According to People's
 Daily, intellectuals in the
 past went to farms and factories
 simply to "gather material";
 now they are getting their hands
 callused in production teams
 and brigades.   "Shunning neither
 dirty jobs nor tiresome work,

 they have truly discarded their
 pompous airs."
 A stiffer policy toward so-
 cial science departments of uni-
 versities also is now evident.
 Several reports indicate that
 the philosophy and history de-
 partments of Peking University
 --long a center of political
 ferment--the philosophy depart-
 ment of China People's University,
 and the language department of
 the Peking Normal University
 have just been transferred per-
 manently to the countryside.
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi report-
 edly told a group of researchers
 in Shanghai in November 1965 that
 the whole educational structure
 of China was rotten and the
 teachers must go to the country-
 side and study and apply Mao's
 thinking.   Letters indicate that
 with the exception of people
 trained in a few important spe-
 cialties, all college graduates
 now spend their first year after
 graduation in manual work,  partly
 to give them practical training
 but mostly for their own ideo-
 logical good.   Even before grad-
 uation, students are often as-
 signed for an entire semester
 at a time to rural communes.
 Last fall,  for example,  a student
 at Tsinghua University in Peking
 wrote that 4,000 students--nearly
 the entire enrollment--were serv-
 ing a six-month stint in the
 countryside.   Since the letter
 writer "fortunately" had a his-
 tory of tuberculosis,  he was one
 of a group of 800 students ex-
 cused for health reasons.
 In October 1965, Minister
 of Health Chien Hsien-chung re-
 portedly told a group of doctors
 in Chengtu that the normal tour
 in the country for a doctor,
 formerly two to five months,
 would in 1966 be extended to
 ten months.
 A public health conference
 held in Canton in November 1965
 announced that one third of all
 municipal medical and health
 personnel would be assigned to
 rural health work,  some for
 "long periods."   The conference
 further announced that "many"
 conference delegates had pledged
 to spend their lives in the
 countryside.
 Doctors are privately crit-
 ical                                                                    of  these programs.   A re-
 cent graduate of a Canton medi-
 cal school complained in a let-
 ter that he could not understand
 why he and 80 percent of his
 class were being assigned to
 commune health clinics.   Another
 medical school graduate said
 that most of his fellow graduates
 had been sent to the rural areas
 and that he himself,  in spite
 of China's pressing health needs,
 would have to spend one year in
 physical labor before being al-
 lowed to start medical practice.
 An NCNA broadcast of 25
 February painted a glowing pic-
 ture of the "tremendous enthu-
 siasm" that Peking's students,
 teachers, scientists, artists,
 and government workers were
 showing for a variety of nasty,
 dirty jobs.    According to the
 broadcast,  100,000 intellectuals
 in Peking,  including two vice
 mayors,  have taken a hand in the
 collection of night soil,  canal

 digging,  snow removal,  and street
 sweeping.   It cited a group of
 laboratory technicians who were
 no longer content to give only
 one month yearly to physical la-
 bor but have agreed periodically
 to remove rust from the pipes
 of the city's heating plants.
 Soaked with sweat and caked with
 mud, these researchers crawled
 out of underground tunnels "ex-
 hilarated," not by the fresh air
 but because in cleaning pipes
 they had also rid their minds
 of "odious bourgeois ideas."
 A technique which the re-
 gime is employing to bring pres-
 sure to bear on scientists is
 to demand public acknowledgement
 from them of the value of Mao's
 thought in their research,  an
 undoubtedly humiliating experi-
 ence for a person who knows that
 his audience"knows how ludicrous
 this sounds.   National prominence
 was given on 24 February to a
 forum convened in Peking by the
 central committee's political
 department for higher education
 at which'Western-trained profes-
 sors of physics, mechanical en-
 gineering,  soil chemistry,  and
 petroleum abjectly attributed
 their scientific accomplishments
 to the study of Mao's political
 tracts.   An associate professor
 in thermodynamics related how
 he had used Mao's On Practice
 and On Contradiction in study-
 ing and improving the ammonia
 synthesis tower.
 A professor of theoretical
 physics told how he and other
 physicists at Peking University
 had achieved breakthroughs in
 their study of fundamental par-
 titles by using Mao's thought.
 This professor as well had to
 denigrate Western research.   He
 characterized Western study of
 physics as being in a state of
 stagnation because Western phy-
 sicists were adhering to bour-
 geois philosophical concepts.
 On the contrary,  he and his
 fellow physicists, using dia-
 lectical materialism, had al-
 legedly blazed new trails in
 science.
 At the conference a noted
 US-trained professor of soil
 chemistry servilely confessed
 that in the past he had been
 too engrossed in foreign scien-
 tific writings and had confined
 himself too much to his labora-
 tory.   Inspired by Mao's writings,
 and purified by an extended stay
 at farm labor,  he had discarded
 the "pompous airs of an expert
 and college professor."  Claim-
 ing that he had learned much
 about soil science while work-
 ing in the fields,  he pledged
 to go back for an even longer
 stint of manual labor.
 Effects of the Campaign
 Peking's aim has been to-
 tal thought control--the in-
 culcation of all intellectuals
 with Mao's harsh,  fundamentalist
 philosophy--but in this,  the
 regime has failed.    What lit-
 tle is known of the attitudes
 of intellectuals indicates that
 many or most are deeply alien-
 ated and disaffected.   Most are
 probably "revisionist" at heart
 out of sympathy with regime ef-
 forts to keep "class" hostilities
 alive,  and would prefer to leave
 the rest of the world alone and

 concentrate on China's enormous
 developmental problems.
 Increasing disaffection
 among intellectuals would be
 especially detrimental to Pe-
 king's scientific programs.
 It is not yet clear how far the
 regime intends to go in intrud-
 ing politics into natural science,
 but indications are that hence-
 forth Chinese scientists will
 be expected to use political
 as well as scientific criteria
 are allowed to continue their
 serious work while merely giv-
 ing lip service to political
 shibboleths.   Certainly, medical
 services and higher education
 must have already suffered from
 regime hostility to intellectuals
 in these fields.
 Although the intellectuals
 have no capacity or inclination
 for open resistance,  Peking's
 current campaign against them
