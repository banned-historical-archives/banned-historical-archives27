FOREWORD 
This booklet is published for the enlightenment of world 
public opinion which knows nothing of the reality of colo-
nialism and military repression as effected by the French 
Government in the Kamerun. 
We hope that it will help to mobilise the public towards 
influencing the French Government to put an end to the 
fire and carnage they are maintaining in the Kumerun. 
We are appealing to the whole world before it becomes too 
late to do anything. 
This booklet does not pretend to depict a complete 
picture of the grave situation which prevails in the Kame-
run, as it does not but touch on the salient aspects without 
exhausting the subject in its entirety. 
Besides the alarm this booklet reflects, it tries to pay 
hommage to that fraction of world opinion which was so 
indignant at the crimes committed in our country, took 
resolutions condemning these actions and expressed their 
sympathy and support. 
The booklet further stresses, in particular, the respon-
sibility of the United Nations which, while having supreme 
authority in our country, looks indifferently at the atroci-
ties being committed there in its name, without making the 
slightest sign or action of protest. It also proves the extent

of the danger this attitude represents to the prestige of the 
United Nations. As a matter of fact, Mr. Mbida, the French 
Government's agent for repression, has declared on Nov-
ember 9th, 2957: "On two occasions, the founder of the 
U.P.C. has gone to the United Nations to demand indepen-
dence but, what has he brought?" (The Canzeroons Press, 
special issue, November toth, 1957). 
Finally, this booklet is an appeal to the whole world to 
extend moral and material help to the people of the Kame-
run in the struggle for the unity and independence of their 
country as a contribution to the cause of world peace. 
"Slavery is one of the most conspicious causes 
of the deterioration of nations." 
Prof E.A ROSS 
-The history of the peoples struggle for their freedom and 
independence has not, in the least, a character of spontaneity; it 
does not manifest itself except after a long struggle." 
If this thought, of the President of Egypt, was valuable for 
Egypt, it is equally valuable for all the countries who are struggling 
to gain their national sovereignty which is suppressed by colonial-
ism. It is further, the best proof that no people have ever will-
ingly accepted foreign domination. The struggle of the oppressed 
peoples for national liberation was born on the same day colonisa-
tion established itself by brutal force.

The struggle of the people of the Kamerun for the unity and 
independence of their country, comes within the frame of this 
historic process. 
It is well known that the Kamerun was a German Protector-
ate (1884-1914) and was divided in an arbitrary way into two 
distinct countries, the day which followed the end of the first 
world war. It was put under the mandate of the League of Na-
tions with France and Britain as the mandatory Powers. By the 
end of the second world war, which put the seal on the death of 
the League of Nations, the Kamerun passed from the mandatory 
regime to that of the trusteeship of the United Nations on Dec-
ember 13th, 1946. 
Both under the regime of the protectorate or that of the man-
date, the history of the Kamerun is resplendent with glorious 
examples of heroic battles waged for the restoration of their na-
tional independence. 
Yet, the people of the Kamerun never folded their arms and 
bowed to the oppressros; but their conscientious organised poli-
tical struggle does not date back longer than ten years, by the 
creation, on April 10th 1948, of the National Movement, known 
all over the world by the name of the Union of the Populations 
of the Camerouns (U.P.C.). The movement's slogan : 
"Unity and Independence of the Kamerun" has rallied to its 
banner almost the whole of the population. To testify this fact, 
we quote Mr. Claude Krief who wrote in the "Express" of January 
2nd, 1958: 
"This Party has re-united indisputably all the nationals of the 
Camerouns (Editor's note: 'it always unites them'). The intel-
lectuals, for sure, and also the masses who discarded their trib-
alism, as well as the neo-proletarians of Douala and else-
where." 
The British weekly paper -The Manchester Guardian" 
where support of U.P.C. could never be suspected, carried in 
its issue of January 20th 1955 a leading article signed by Mr. 
Thomas Hodgkin. This writer said: 
? 6 ? 
"The U P.C. is undisputedly the best organised political 
party in the Camerouns; a good example of the 'new model' 
pulitical party in West Africa with its pyramidic structure based 
on the village committees in the interior, and on the district 
committees, in the towns." 
The effect of the action of such a national movement hav-
ing such a big influence over the masses of the people in a me-
thodical organisation, is sure to be felt in colonial quarters. For 
the French Minister of Colonies, only a bath of blood could 
"draw such a party into the shade." Strong military contin-
gents were brought from the Senegal and from France, under 
the usual pretext of "restoring order", and on May 25th 1955 
fire opened and all repressive measures were put in to action. 
As Claude Krief put it, in an article which appeared in the 
"Express" of January 2nd 1958, "a brutal repression did the 
rest." Actually, it was a real "brutal repression" with a bal-
ance sheet of 5,000 killed, 200 dwellings set on fire in one single 
town, that of Douala, by reactionary elements, with doubtless 
intention to make French civilisation more appreciated; and 800 
orders of arrest signed on May 28th by Cau, the French ex-
pert of colonial repression who thus opened the season of "chas-
ing the Upecists" who overcrowded the prisons. A large 
number of political detainees were deported to Largeau (0u-
banghi-Chari) and the dissolution of the U.P.C. and two other 
anti-colonialist organisations on July 13th, completed the picture. 
Since then, the country has been under the complete rule 
of insecurity. After isolated incidents of the assassination of 
some patriots, French troops sacrificed 1,500 Kamerunians as a 
1956 Christmas present and to celebrate the day of November 
1 1 th 1957, they killed 480 nationalists in Baham (cf. Doc. A/C 
4/SR of the United Nations). 
While the United Nations General Assembly met in its 
12th session, at New York, and the Kamerun was the highlights, 
petitioners made representations at Manhattan to the Trustee-
ship Commission in the name of the peoples of the Kamerun, re-
garding the vindictive measures taken against the nationals. 
They sollicited the Commission to draw the attention of the

United Nations to the grave situation of the country and re-
commended the appointment of an inquiry mission to investigate 
on the spot 
What then, is precisely taking place in the Eastern Ka-
merun ? 
On November 9th 1597, Mr. Mbida, Prime Minister of the 
puppet government installed in Yaounde by France, addressed a 
proper ultimatum to the patriots of the Kamerun in which he 
gave them a grace of ten days during which they could choose 
between surrender, or, to fight till the end. Mr. Mbida an-
nounced the "severe measures" which his government would 
apply. in case his ultimatum obtained no response from the Ka-
menmian people. viz:? Re-delination of the villages, the im-
position of the curfew, the suppression of markets and public 
transport." ? These measures. the French newspaper "Le Mon-
de". reported in its issue of November 22nd. 1957. do not ex-
clude taking direct action against the agitators of the Union who 
are the instigators of the rebellion."' 
On December 2nd, 1957, a communique was issued in Ya-
ounde. by the Council of Ministers, which read: 
"The High Commissioner and the Government of the Ca-
merouns have once again declared their determination to sup-
press any actior of a minority which..." We made a special 
point in giving the title of the High Commissioner, because a 
section of the French press has tried, since the development of ' 
the situation in the Kamerun. to show the representative of 
France, more as a mediator between Mbida on one side 
nationalists of the Kamerun on the other. The purpose of this 
distorted picture was to show the grave political crisis now exist-
ing in the kamerun as a vulgar tribal quarrel, or a factional 
fight. Thus, many French journalists took the matter easily and 
slightly, while in reality it was quite the contrary. The High 
Commissioner. Pierre Messmer, who conducted the massacres 
of December 1956. thus continued his low business, this year. 
Jo the December 17th 1957, issue of "L'Aurore . Mr. Henry 
Benazet stated under his name: The ultimatum issued by the 
head of the government Mr. Mbida... has pitously failed." 
?s ? 
Henceforward, the Kamerun patriots were at the mercy of 
the French Union Mbida went to Paris, the High Commissioner 
replacing him for some few days. According to the Radio-
Paris news bulletin of December 12th. 1957 after receiving Mr. 
Mbida in audience, the President of the French Republic, Mr. 
Ren?oty, called for Marshal Juin. For those who know Mar-
shal Juin, this was an ominous sign for the Kamerunian patriots. 
However, it was "Le Monde' of December 18th which shed light 
on the purpose of Mbida's voyage. "Mr. Mbida". this paper 
said. "has come to Paris to demand reinforcements for the siege 
of the zone of trouble.- Mbida himself was more precise on 
the aim of his mission, as he declared : Public opinion in the 
Capital should understand that in working for the restoration of 
peace and security in the Kamerun. we work also for the in-
terests of the French Union As our country occupies a geo-
graphical position between the French West Africa and the 
French Equatorial Africa. the success of any subversive move-
ment will rapidly overtake the two neighbouring federations." 
Because of the efficient and prompt manner in which French 
journalists such as Henry Benazet insisted for the colonial re-
gime. Mbida got the reinforcements he asked for. 
"L'Express" published a long article under the heading of 
"French troops sent urgently to the Camerouns to re-establish 
order" in which it confirmed that- "Tv.3 rifle companies will 
arrive this week in the Camerouns. They were the reinforce-
ments which Prime Minister. Mr Andr?arie Mbida, demand-
ed from Mr Chaban-Delmas. the French Minister of National 
Defence. as the 1.500 men who keep order in a territory of 
sixty French provinces are insufficient." 
Most of the French newspapers remarked that the despatch 
of such reinforcements was an indication of the grave sttuation 
actually prevailing in the Kamerun. 
Under the headline: 'The French Go?ernment intensifies 
repression in the Camerouns. L'Humanite of January 4th 
1958 carried a long article, in which it was said: 
The situation in the Camerouns is getting more and more 
grave and reports coming from that country are likewise getting

more and more disquieting. Parallel with the military repres-
sion which has been reinforced by the troops who came from 
French Equatorial Africa, imprisonment for the patriots and the 
syndicalists is taking place on a wide scale." The paper then 
gave' a list of the names of responsible syndicalists and others 
who?were arrested under notoriously illegal conditions, and de-
ported secretly. Mothers of families were not spared from ar-
rest and imprisonment. 
The article went on to say: -Since the murder of Wanko, 
member of the Legislative Assembly of the Cameroun, the troops 
sent for reinforcement are working as the case may be some 
months now. Since the assassination of Dr. Delague in Sanaga-
Maritime, people of the Camerouns live in a state of grave in-
security. 
"A real state of siege has been established in the Bamilike, 
a region which is the size of three French Departments with a 
population of 200.000 inhabitants." 
In the same article one reads that all the meetings of the trade 
unions were under minute supervision. 
The papers which dare to criticise the government of the Ka-
merun are confiscated, freedom of the press is suppressed. 
On the other hand the "Figaro" of December 11th which 
fixed the date of September 6th, 1957 as marking grave develop-
ment of the tension, which has actually reached its climax, con-
firms that: 
"Since that date, no day, or night, passes without blood being 
shed, villages set on fire, or property being stolen. It is difficul,t 
to give accurate figures." 
Yet, these are not the only exploits of the forces said to be 
set for keeping order. Other fresh reports flow in to confirm the 
opinion of the French press. In one little village, that of Bane, 
in the Bamileke, 31 persons were shot dead by rifle fire. On 
November 22nd 1957, Sidje Nefeche, a patriot, was killed in his 
house; shortly after that, fire was set to his dwelling, making a 
most strange grave. It is always in this region that the French 
? 10 ? 
npriassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
mercenaries encircle the market of Balingsap where they make 
arrests en masse of the patriots who are submitted later to un-
imaginable tortures. Some are shot dead and thrown into the 
lake, others are flung alive into the river Noun with big heavy 
stones tied to their legs. Prisoners also are taken out of their 
cells and killed in the same way. 
Finally, to those who still doubt the gravity of the situation 
in the Kamerun, we select the following passage from an important 
document which was delivered to the French authorities by Mr. 
Ruben Um Nyobe, Secretary General of the U.P.C. On page 20 
of this document, one reads under the heading: "The True Solu-
tions for a Political and Moral Settlement in the Kamerun": 
"In Sanaga-Maritime. for instance, the people are invited to 
come out, then those villagers who are found inside their dwellings 
are tortured, robbed and arrested and driven to the concentration 
camps of Botmakak, Dibang, Maboub, M'bdpe, Eseka, Tuma, 
Nkouga, Ndou, Nyanon, Ngambe, etc., where they are forced to 
work in most degrading jobs. They could, however, after 2 or 
4 months of dett.ntion be liberated, after paying big amounts of 
money to the mercenaries, above that ?which had been looted from 
them. The detention camps are guarded by the gendarmes, or 
the military forces, and hundreds of patriots are kept prisoners in 
these unofficial prisons, where they are tortured without legal 
trial of any sort, they are simply "denounced" by a dirty spy as 
being an "Upecist." These camps are maintained by the Head of 
the Region, and other killers of the patriots, who are well known 
to the authorities. All kinds of atrocities are committed there 
with the encouragement of the French authorities who cover them-
sieves with the pretext of acting under orders of the Government 
of the Kamerun." 
All indications point out that the fighting, which broke out in 
Algeria after Dien Bien Phu, is now extending to the Kamerun 
because French colonialism does not wish to die.

THE POSITION OF THE U.N. AND OF FRANCE 
This is how the actual situation reigning over the Kamerun 
under French domination is particularly grave; it is of a nature 
to menace international peace and security; it is quite in conflict 
with the terms and aims of the Charter of the Trusteeship Agree-
ments and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights It is. 
above all, inhuman and represents a spirit incompatible with the 
French Republic tradition. 
Before this drama, which the U N and France are enacting 
as parties contracted by the Trusteeship Agreement, what right 
had France to take over the administration of the Kamerun ? 
1 After the massacres of May 1955, the anti-colonial 
member countries of the U.N. expressed their profound 
sentiments and condemned this savage and blind repres-
sion launched against the defenceless people by the French 
Government. On the other hand, the visiting Mission 
of the Trusteeship Council of the U.N. thought it their 
duty to give their verdict ? which was in favour of the 
administrative authorities ? before having the objective 
material information, and without listening to all parties 
concerned. 
2. During the 11th session of the General Assembly of the 
U.N. a resolution was passed 1064 (XI) "expressing the 
hope ? after having regretted not a single law of am-
nesty has been promulgated in the territory ? that by 
the enforcement of appropriate measures, and rapid pro-
mulgation of the amnesty law, conditions could be estab-
lished in the Kamerun under French administration, which 
would favour the restoration of a normal situation in the 
near future." 
? 12 ? 
3. The 19th session of the United Nations Trusteeship Coun-
cil also voted, in June 1957, a similar resolution. 
4. After the 4th Commission had found it impossible to 
reach a solution for the problem of the Kamerun follow-
ing a debate of 15 days, the pleniary session of the 12th 
session of the U.N. General Assembly voted for the re-
solution recommended by Peru, Venezuela and Equador 
calling on France to accelerate the promulgation of the 
law of amnesty in the Kamerun, as the condition most 
favourable for the restoration of the situation there, to 
normal. 
Although this resolution was the result of compromise, yet 
it imposed a principle by making amnesty a condition for the crea-
tion of a normal political atmosphere. 
It is interesting to recall here, that France herself had voted 
in favour of this resolution, explaining her attitude in these words: 
"With a spirit of conciliation, the French Delegation agree to the 
draft resolution submitted by Equador, Peru and Venezuela. This 
project, to our point of view, constitutes a compromise acceptable 
to all and will allow us to break the deadlock in which we find 
ourselves." (cf. Doc. A/PV. 729 of December 1957, pp. 43-45 in 
English). 
Thus the United Nations and France were in accord as to 
the recognition of the fact that the only condition for the liquida-
tion of the political vaccuum in the Kamerun was the rapid pro-
mulgation of a law of amnesty. 
But to what extent will this laudible intention go ? It will 
not go beyond the lobbies of the United Nations, because the 
French Government will press their mouthpiece, Mr. Mbida, who 
will declare to us: "A general amnesty will be an encouragement 
to crime." In the course of his interview to "Le Monde", Mr. 
Mbida whom the French paper justly described as "a bit dicta-
torial," disclosed to us a secret, when he said: "There are things 
which the French Government cannot say publicly, but which we 
can say for him." ("Le Monde" of December 18th, 1957. p. 6).

40.4. 
Evidently, it is not Mr. Mbida and his Legislative Assembly 
who are opposing the amnesty, but the French Government through 
their spokesmen. According to the provisions of Art 4 t B) of 
the Trusteeship Agreement, it is France and not the "autonomous" 
Government who is responsible for keeping order in the Kamerun 
On the other hand, the statute granted to the Kainerun confers 
on Parliament and the French Government wide legislative powers 
in what concerns matters of public liberties. Furthermore, Art. 41 
of this statute lays down that the High Commissioner "is respon-
sible for public security as well as the security of the French gen-
darmerie, stationed in the territory" and that he can -in cases of 
urgency, take all measures needed for keeping order and safe-
guarding public interests.' Art. 2 of the same statute stipulates 
that no legislation should be made by the Kamerun Government. 
or any measures taken which may be contradictory to interna-
tional laws observed in the territory. But, by force of the right 
of veto, Art. 49 of the above-mentioned statute, the French Gov-
ernment can oppose all legislations, or any other actions which 
conflict with the Trusteeship Agreement, the U N. Charter, or the 
Universal Declaration of the Human Rights 
Thus, the responsibility for criminal actions committed in the 
Kamerun lies on the shoulders of France But she tries to use 
Mr. Mbida as a puppet, exactly as she used Ben Arafa This was 
the explicit view of -L'Express- of 2/1/1958 
This is the situation as it now stands in the Kamerun a situa-
tion which will lead to a real war as a result of the indifference 
and lack of decision on the part of the 83 States who constitute 
the United Nations. This is also the result of strange bargaining 
and miserable diplomatic combinations. 
France is well under way. th use in a territory under United 
Nations trusteeship, the same method she is employing in Algeria 
under the eyes and ears of a world divided by egoist interests 
WOmen, men and children are perishing and the most abominable 
crimes are left to be committed for no reason but that some people 
give more preference to the crops of coco and oil of the Kamerun 
than to human life, leaving the treasured principles of peace. se-
curity, equality, etc., to take care of themselves. 
? 14 ? 
Why then should these poor people be deceived by Declara-
tions and Charters? Why should they be left to be burned to 
ashes to make them belie\ e in such principles 7 it is only history 
which will tell us the cause 
VERDICT OF INTERNATIONAL OPINION 
Nevertheless, if the United Nations close their doors to the 
cries of the Kamerunians. there still exists a fraction of interna-
tional public opinion who will contribute to the cause of the Ka-
merun and support their demands 
It should be said also that inside the United Nations there 
are some representatives w ho support our cause We shall not 
name them, Whether coming from the Philippines or from Mexico, 
from Ghana. or from Ethiopia: from Syria. or from Guatemala, 
from Liberia. or fr( in the Yemen words can never e;.press our 
gratitude to those countries who sponsored our cause as if it was 
their own cause 
In Damascus. the Afro-Asian Jurists Conference, held from 
7th to 10th November. 1957, voted for the following resolutions 
"After taking knowledge of the actual situation in the 
Kamerun vhich situation is a flagrant violation of all inter-
national rights. especially that of self-determination 
-And in consideration of the fact that this territory is a 
country under the truAceship of the United Nations 
"And in consideration of the United Nations Charter. 
Art 76 (B) in particular. which laid down that the ultimate 
aim of the trusteeship regime is independence. 
-And in consideration of the fact that the German-Ka-
merunian Treaty of July 12th 1884. recognised by the United 
Kingdom and France. accepted the principle of the sover-
eignity and unity of the Kamerun territories

such division was unilateral and injust. 
"And in consideration of Arts. 1 (2) and 55 of the 
Charter, recognising the right of the people to decide their 
own destinies in full freedom. 
"And in consideration of Art. 76 (B) of the United Na-
tions Charter. providing in the particular case of the terri-
tories under trusteeship, that attention should be paid to the 
free aspirations of the populations concerned and of the vote 
passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 
February 26th, 1957 by a big majority calling on France and 
the United Kingdom to give independence to the Kamerun 
in an early date. 
"And in consideration of the provisions of Art. 1 of the 
United Nations Charter, recommending the maintenance of 
peace and international security by the peaceful settlement of 
all probems. yet France continues to carry out her massacres 
of the population since May, 1955. 
"And in consideration of the provisions of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Kingdom on her 
part has suppressed the public liberties and deported Ka-
merun nationals. 
"Consequently. this Conference hopes that the actual 
session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will 
take account of the, rightful and legitimate aspirations of the 
Kamerunian people by passing an adequate and firm resolu-
tion for the unity and independence of the Kamerun. 
"This Conference express their solid support to the 
people of the Kamerun in their struggle." 
On the other hand, the Afro-Asian Conference of Cairo. which 
brought together 500 delegates representing 3/4 of the population 
of the whole world, passed the following resolution over the Ka-
merun: 
"The Conference hope that the United Nations would 
realise the grave situation in the Kamerun. 
? 16 ? 
"The Conference call also on all countries of Asia and 
Africa to help by all appropriate means the struggle of people 
of the Kamerun who are fighting for their unity and inde-
pendence. 
"The Conference condemn the measures of violence 
taken by the French Authorities in this territory and appeal 
to French public opinion to demand their Government to stop 
such measures.' 
While this resolution was being taken in Cairo, the African 
Students Federation in Paris voted the following resolutions in the 
course of the meeting of the 8th Congress of their Federation.

? Considering the ever increasing number of the arbitrary 
arrest of patriots which shows the total absence of de-
mocratic freedom. 
? Considering the fact that all these measures will greatly 
aggravate an already deteriorating situation. 
The Congress of the Federation of the Students of Black 
Africa: 
1) Vigorously condemns the policy of repression practised 
by the French Government and by the local authorities 
who are leading the Kamerun to the brink of catastrophy. 
2) Reaffirms the resolutions taken by the preceding ses-
sions, which resolutions conform with those of the Gen-
eral Assembly of the United Nations and suggests the 
following as the proper solution of the Kamerun crisis: 
a) The prompt promulgation of a law of total amnesty 
with effect from May, 1955 up to December 1956. 
b) The restoration of normal political life by respecting 
democratic liberties and the resumption of freedom 
of movement. 
c) The recognition of the INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
KAMERUN. 
3) Launching a vigorous appeal to French and international 
public opinion for the suspension of repressive measures 
under any form and for the respect and implementation

RESOLUTIONS OVER THE EMPLOYMENT OF AFRICAN 
TROOPS IN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS IN THE KAMERUN 
The VIII Congress of the Federation :

posed the employment of Africans in colonial wars 
? 13 ? 
? Considering the despatch to the Kamerun on the demand 
of the criminal puppet Prime Minister M'bida, of African 
troops to besiege the so-called troubled zone. 
? Considering that the despatch of African non-Kamerunian

whole people and the Kamerunian troops in particular are 
supporting the national Kamerunian movement. 
? The Congress declare their resolute protest against the 
employment of African against Africans in a war designed 
by foreign French colonialism 
-- The Congress addresses a vigorous appeal to the people 
of France to awaken their conscience to the gravity of 
the Kamerunian problem. 
? The Congress call on African parliaments and responsible 
people to work jointly to stop the brutalities committed 
against Africans. 
? Pledging all trade unions, the youth and all African pa-

COMMITMENT AND ACTION 
The Federation of the Students of Black Africa in France 
meeting in a Congress held from 27th to 31st December in the 
-Salle" of the "Societes Savantes" in Paris: 
? After having studied the actual situation in the Kamerun

aspect.

? Considering that the struggle of the Kamerunian people 
for their liberation from the bonds of colonialism is a 
cardinal historic fact, the consequences of which will go 
far beyond the geographic demarcation of the Kamerun 
to affect the near future of the whole of Black Africa 
under French domination. 
? The Congress decide: 
1) To take up the struggle of the people of the Kamerun 
as their own struggle 
2) Solemnly affirm their total solidarity with all Ka-
merunian patriots and commit themselves to act for 
their support. 
3) Inscribe the problem of the Kamerun as the first point 
of action in their platform for 1958 and to organise a 
Solidarity Week. 
4) Recommend to the Executive Committee to raise as a 
matter of urgency the problem of the Kamerun in all 
international conferences and students congress. 
5) Asking the U.G.T AN. and the Council of Young 
Africa and the members of the LI G F,.A 0. to appoint 
committees of solidarity everywhere in Africa to main-
tain and mobilise public opinion in favour of the Ka-
merunian patriots. 
All this go to prove that the cause of the people of the Ka-
merun has the profound sympathy of an important part of inter-
national public opinion and that France who is practising all this 
terror in our country has no such support This should urge the 
French people to press their Government to save what remains 
of Franco-Kamerunian friendship. This is a more emphatic proof 
that colonialism has no longer any support, a fact which was 
pronouncedly evident in the speeches of the delegates of the Afro-
Asian Conference in Cairo. 
Addressing that Conference, the delegate of Ethiopia said : 
"Our people have been through the experiences the people of 
Algeria, of the Kamerun and of Kenya are suffering today. The 
? 20 ? 
memories of the cruelty of Fascist oppression are still deeply en-
graved in our minds and thus it would be inconceivable that 
Ethiopia could ever support an injustice which she had been fight-
ing for a long time" 
The Indian delegate, Mrs. Ramashwati Nehru, on the other 
hand emphasized ? "People who are struggling for their liberties 
deserve to be honoured: they should know that they have our 
hearty support" 
Speaking in Port-Said on the occasion of the Victory An-
niversary, President Gamal Abdel Nasser declared: 
"Since Port Said, we have been addressing the whole world 
reclaiming the realisation of the independence of all colonised 
countries." 
All these resolutions and declarations one now should neces-
sarily materialise. The gradually deteriorating situation in the 
Kamerun the increasing number of human lives sacrificed for the 
sake of liberty and independence, the urgent need of the Ka-
merunian people for moral and material help to achieve the inde-
pendence of their country with as less human sacrifices, all these 
factors make it most essential that the above-mentioned resolutions 
and declarations be effected. 
We demand of the whole world to organise meetings and 
demonstrations of protest as well as propaganda campaigns in the 
press. We appeal to the people of Africa and Asia to collect 
contributions to help us in our struggle. We appeal to them to 
approach the International Red Cross to come to the aid of the 
victims of repression in the Kamerun, to our students who are 
cut off from financial aid to continue their studies to graduate as 
lawyers to go to the Kamerun to defend the thousands of patriots 
who are waiting for capital punishment. In brief, we are launch-
ing an appeal to all brothers of Africa and Asia for a moral and 
material aid, an aid which should be effective and massive. 
We rely on the people of France -- our ally, whom we do 
not confuse with the gang of coonialists who are murdering us ? 
in order to put into effect the resolution of the Afro-Asian Con-
ference in Cairo over the Kamerun.

To the American people, who are mostly misinformed as to 
the reality of colonialism to whom the nationalists are always 
pictured as 'demons' and 'panthers', to the American people we 
dedicate the words of Abraham Lincoln: 
"What I would like to emphasize is that no man is good 
enough to govern another without his consent. I declare that this 
is the fundamental principle, the saving anchor of American Re-
publicanism... 
..."If the White govern themselves this would be autonomy; 
but, if the White were not content with governing themselves and 
govern some other people, this I call despotism." These are Lin-
coln's words uttered in the 19th Century." 
This true ,fact has come to be a more urgent essentiality in 
our century in which freedom and independence are actually a 
vital factor. 
THE ROLE AND TASK OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
Yet, could it be said that the United Nations are really in-
capabe of finding a peaceful solution for the problem of the Ka-
merun? The part played by the United Nations during the Suez 
Canal aggression, the fact that the Secretary General of the Unit-
ed Nations was commissioned to go to find out the fate of eleven 
American airmen detained in People's China, these two facts lead 
to the question why should not the same attention be paid by the 
United Nations to the fate of five million Kamerunians, tortured 
and murdered in a country which is actually under the trusteeship 
of the United Nations. 
Under the headline: "The International League of the 
Human Rights against the Policy of the French Government in 
the Camerouns," the French daily newspaper "Libdration" of Jan-
uary 9th, 1958, wrote: "The International League of the Human 
Rights have today expressed their deep anxiety over the action 
taken by the French Government by sending military reinforce-
ments to the Camerouns in order to suppress an uprising. 
? 22 ? 
"Mr. Roger Baldwin. President of the League wrote in his 
letter that in the course of the debate of the General Assembly, 
it was clearly established that the situation in the French Ca-
merouns was in urgent need for prompt and vigorous action on 
the part of the United Nations to inquire into the changes con-
cerning the suppression of the Human Rights in these mandated 
territories. 
"We have conducted a comprehensive inquiry as to the 
existence of Communist influence in the French Cameroons and 
found out that it constitutes a minor element." 
On January 30th, 1958, the Trusteeship Council will meet in 
New York to study the political situation in the countries under 
trusteeship. The Council will also study the declarations of the 
Kamerunians submitted to the 4th Commission of the 12th session 
of the General Assembly of the United Nations in which they de-
nounced the criminal policy France has been following with them. 
This Council also will have to decide sending a mission to visit 
the Kamerun. 
Will such mission be an ordinary, or a special mission 1 
The Colonial Powers were one voice in their refusal to send this 
mission, but, why? 
However, the problem most difficult for solution is: How 
will the visiting mission accomplish its duty honestly and object-
ively in an atmosphere of terror and war prevailing all over the 
territory. This anxiety was expressed by the delegate of the 
Union of the Population of Cameroons (U.P.C.) in the United 
Nations who declared: "Under such conditions it is impossible 
to find the calm and security all of us are hoping for. We should 
ask under what circumstances, and with what measures will this 
visiting mission perform their functions. They will have to choose 
to follow the injunctions of the administrative authorities as was 
the case in 1955, or to follow the opposite course in which case 
these authorities will refuse them the security and cooperation 
they need, in order to discharge their task properly. In either 
case. it will not be possible for your mission to see a true picture 
of the situation in the Kamerun and to draw up correct conclu-
sions and decisions."

Now, that the illwill of France having clearly manifested 
itself, will the United Nations persist in their confidence in 
France? The United Nations have to choose between the prin-
ciples of the Charter and the support of the colonialists. The 
United Nations should choose: 
"Do not forget, Condorcet affirmed in his letter to the Gentle-
men of the Tiers State, that if you tolerate the violation of na-
tional rights by other men, you are bound to recognise as just 
the principles of the policy which tries to justify violence... You 
will be legalising in advance the actions which the tyrants might 
one day take against you... 
"Your security as being the voice of humanity make you duty 
bound to abrogate all the laws which violate the rights of the 
foreigners, the black and the serf..." 
"NO COEXISTENCE IS POSSIBLE WITH COLONIALISM" 
This was President Soekarno's new year message to the 
whole world. 
Actually, peaceful coexistence is only possible among inde-
pendent people, as it is impossible to stand except on the basis of 
equality and reciprocal respect. 
We have tried in vain to evade the war in our country, be-
sides resorting to all juridic means, but, France has always re-
fused to come to reason. 
Thus, our people is standing against oppression and tyranny 
and according to the Charter of the United Nations and of the 
Universal Declaration of the Human Rights. 
Nobody could ever reproach us for taking such a purely de-
fensive attitude. 
As President James K. Polk declared in his message to the 
American Congress on May I 1 th, 1846, we tell our people: "As 
war, in spite of all our efforts to prevent it ? exists on the will 
of France herself ? duty and patriotism call on us to defend with 
? 24 ? 
, A ,,,rnwpri for Release 
3 
energy and honour the rights and interests of our country." No-
body could be found in 1846 to consider James K. Polk as 'Com-
munist.' Why then, do they persist in America to ignore such 
incidents in their history? 
Even Gandhi, the protagonist of non-violence wrote on 
August 11th, 1920, to say: "Where there is nothing do but 
to choose between cowardice and violence, I advise the resort to 
violence. I shall risk violence rather than the degeneration of a 
whole race. 
"I much prefer to see India resorting to arms to defend her 
honour, than to stay cowardly watching the defamation of her 
own honour..." 
If the French murder the Kamerunians as the troops of Santa 
Anna did in Alamo, our people are sure to come out victorious 
with the aid of the Afro-Asian countries, that of the democratic 
people all over the world. If the people of Thermopyles had 
their prophet of misfortune, the Kamerunians will have their Sam 
Houston to liberate them from Franco-British colonial oppression. 
Thus the Kamerunians will play the part devoted to them in 
the society of free peoples. 
Would the year 1958 be the year of the unification and inde-
pendence of the Kamerun ? 
Would the year 1958 be the year of universal peace and bring 
to the Algerian people their aspired independence

FOREWORD 
On March 28th, 1958, the parisian newspaper ? La Tri-
bune des Nations >> wrote: < The events in North Africa are not 
all for the benefit of the Kamerunian nationalists. For the 
Algerian war weakens France, but it hides from the world the 
the fact that a rebellion is taking place in the Kamerun. If it 
were not for the Algerian war, there is no doubt that the 
underground struggle of the U.P.C. (Union of the Populations

Red Cross. But first and above all, it constitutes a vigourcus 
denunciaton of these cruel and flagrant violations of the ele-
mentary rights inherent to every human bOng. Thus, this 
pamphlet also constitutes a call for solidarity, for struggle 
against systematic injustice. This call is particularily adressed 
to the peoples of France and of the United Kingdom, in whose 
names so many barbarian acts are taking place. We hope that 
the peoples of these two nations, mothers of modern democracy, 
will immediately prove that they have not remained in the cradle 
of democracy, while entrusting to others the task of developing 
it. These ?others? of course have their share of respnnsability, 
especially all those who are committed by the United Nations 
Charter and the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man, 
and more particularly all those who have endured foreign 
domination. 
That is why our publication constitutes an appeal to the 
United Nations, to the Inernational League of the Rights of 
Man, to the International Red ,Cross and to the whole world, 
?and mostly to the Afro-Asian countries,?urging:

sent to the .Kamerun in the nearest future. 
(2) Intervention amidst the Visiting Mission of the U.N.

First, the judicial situation: The Kamerun is a territory 
under international trusteeship, and thus ruled by two funda-
mental principles contained in the United Nations Charter: 
Absolute priority to autochtones' interests (art. 73) and a 
necessary conforming of all policy to their freely expressed 
aspirations for independance or autonomy (art. 76 b). It is 
particularily upon these two principles that are based the 
clauses of the Trusteeship Agreements, aiming at guaranteeing 
to the Kamerunian people the full exercise of all their public 
liberties. Moreover both French and British-administered 
zones of the Kamerun enjoy the Universal Declaration of the 
Rights of Man, signed by France and Great-Britain, article 2 
of which stipulates that ? there will be no distinction based 
upon the political, judicial or international statute of a country 
or territory, whether independant, under trusteeship, non-auto-
nomous or submitted to any limitations of its sovreignty.p 
Now, the U.N. Charter as well as the Trusteeship Agree-
ments and the Rights of Man, all constitue treaties between 
the UN and the signatory powers. On the other hand, treaties 
are more powerful than internal and even constitutional laws. 
That is to say that the administrative powers, France and 
Great-Britain, have solemnly accepted to recognise to the 
Kamerunian people, even against their own legislations, their 
full exercise of all democratic liberties and of all Rights 
of Man. 
:Ile second element which should always be kept in mind 
is the geographical position of the Kamerun: surrounded by 
countries closely controlled by imperialists. 
As for the third element, it is the political situation: 
Faced -with the firm determination of the people in favour 
'of immediate Reunification and Independance, colonialists have 
? 9 ? 
started a ? dirty war >> in which the Information Service, the 
Postal Administration and the judicial services all closely 
cooperate with the armed forces (Army, Gendarmerie and 
Police). 
The only regular sources of information are: The Radio 
and two agencies: Associated Press. and the French Press 
Agency (Agence France-Presse), plus a few ? trustworthy ) 
newsmen admitted once in a while into the country. This 
explains : 
? The silence over the .Kamerunian tragedy. 
? The lies concerning freedom fighters. 
? The impossibility to fight efficiently against this 
conspiracy of silence, owing to the tremendous dif-
ficulties encountered in communicating with the 
patriots (geographical isolation, strict control of 
borders, severe mail censorhip, a.s.o.). 
The parisian newspaper ? Le Monde ? admitted in its 
issue of January 2, 1957, that informations were being censor-
ed. These difficulties in contacting guerillas grow more as 
the armed struggle amplifies, and more again as the solidarity 
between imperialists ? particularly French and British ? is 
consolidated. This explains why informations take some time 
before reaching us, and why we mostly report events which 
occurred last year. 
TILE JUDICIAL SERVICES 
We encounter, or rather we SHOULD encounter justice 
at every step. However, its insolvencies and interventions are 
marked with the stamp of its colonial character:

1. ? It is a racial justice. A European deputy, M. Aujou-
lat, well-known for his hostile attitude towards the 
Kanaerunian national movement, has stigmatized the 
discriminatory and arbitrary system in the Kame-
run, in the following words: ? In the Kamerun, 
? there is a white law and a black law, in other 
? words, there is one black justice and one white 
? justice. 
? Look out! he says to the French justice and 
? administration, let your severities and demands 
? be the same for everybody! Do not abuse of 
? preventive detention (a recent circular has just 
0.. drawn attention on this point), or let it at least 
? be applied by absolute rules, without any dis-
? tinction of rank or colour. Do not let the police 
? brutalities which so often accompany the 
? questioning of suspects go beyond the limits gene-
> inaugurated 
by Mr. Cau, judge of Douala, who on the 28th of May 
1955, had delivered 800 of them to be filled by their' 
users. 
? Then, the decree of February 19th, 1955, allowing 
administrative authorities to arrest and accuse and 
then defer the indicted to a magistrate if however 
there should be one. But French Law magistrates of 
whom we are concerned are very rare. So, the admi-
nistrative agents have judicial functions as well: The 
system of the judge-administrator, in theory supressed 
in 1946, seems now restored in the Kamerun ! 
Finally, in the regions where underground struggle is 
most active, we find yet another factor: the ? state of emer-
gency ? which the French Government has instituted while 
hiding behind the protective screen of the Yaounde puppet 
Government. In fact, it is reported in ? Le Monde >> of Novem-
ber 22nd1 1957 that ? the head of the Kamerunian Govern-
ment ? has taken the following measures: ? regrouping of 
villages, night curfews, suppression of markets and common 
transports. These measures do not exclude a direct action 
against the agitators of the Union who are the promoters of 
the rebellion.? 
This regime does not differ in its nature from the once 
instituted in Algeria and dubbed ? State of Emergency ?. But 
what is particularly serious here is that public liberties are 
being suppressed in a territory under trusteeship, in contra-
diction with international obligations, and. even without the 
Chamber's intervention, though this be ra.quired for internal:

laws. Practical consequences are also catastrophic : In this 
country of widespread populations, the application of such an. 
incomplete policy (it could not be and has never been com-
pleted) by the previous construction of large numbers of 
houses and by the installing of an equally satisfactory system 
of food-distribution around the smaller head-districts, it is 
clear that such a policy provokes numerous displacements at 
unseemly times, even if the whole population accepts to submit 
itself to it. Yet these measures resulted in a big failure, the 
echos of which one can still hear in reactionary newspapers 
such as the ? Figaro 1. or ? Aurore ? in whose edition of 
17/12/1957 is written : ? The ultimatum sent by the head of 
the Government, Mr. Mbida... has failed pitifully... pitifully... 
Also, starting in the month of December 1957, one can read 
in the colonialist press itself (e.g. ? La Presse du Cameroun ?, 
ed. of 19/12/57, or ? Aurore T, ed. of 17/12/57), one can read, 
then, the official balance of ? the Terrorism T. in regions other 
than San aga-Maritime and the Barnileke Country. More proof 
that the fascist regime institute by the law of 19/2/55 and by 
the meaSures taken by Mbida, spreads then to the whole of the 
Oriental Kamerun, contrarily to all the international spoken 
treaties of above. 
IL ? ARBITRARY DETENTIONS 
All those patriots who are arrested without warrants and 
have not been guilty of any branch of law, languish away 
under house arrest, which in fact resembles prison-life. To 
give the arrests a legal appearance, and. to quell the protests 
of the people, the colonialists then take blank warrants and 
fill them up. 
Such was the case of Mr. Mathip, national President of 
the J.D.C., among thousands of others. He writes: ? I was 
abducted very early in the morning by armed forces of repres-
? 15 ? 
sion who broke into my home and raided it, stealing many of 
my things. I was submitted to the most savage and cruel 
torture. These hordes intentionally bruised my feet, like unto 
a captured bird, his wings. So paralysed I was half-naked and 
half-dead, my face being deformed and bloody. I was trans-
ported and thrown into a cell in the premises of the judiciary 
police, which had previously been wetted with urine. I was 
laid down on the floor. I was in a desperate state. But until 
then, one must note, I was arrested without any warrant 
whatsoever ; I was guilty of no crime and indicted with none, 
and, I was not even the object of any judiciary information 
to my knowledge. 
The news of my kidnapping by the repressionist forces 
and of the cruelties graciously extended to me started to 
spread, not only in Douala, but throughout the country. 
I was not killed or thrown alive in the common grave, 
thanks, no doubt, to the popular indignation at the treatment 
which I have just related briefly, but mostly because of the 
hope which the colonialists nourished in their breasts of making 
me, by means of torture, torments, pressure and humiliations 
of all kinds, a traitor to the National Movement, and to my 
Country. 
It is certain beyond doubt that, of these two factors which 
enabled me to survive, the first one obliged the colonialists 
to resort to falsehood and forgery in order to justify my 
arrest. So they made a false arrest warrant bearing the date 
of May 25, 1955, under the signature but without the seal of 
the Judge of Douala, Mr. Georges Alexandre Cau, whose name 
will be connected in the history of the national struggle of our 
people with the most shameful and most ridiculous judiciary 
legalities which make up the gist of the French judiciary 
system in our country. This warrant bearing the number

? 16 ? 
1695/652/PJ, was delivered to the polke. on the 20th of May, 
that is after my arrest which was made, to be precise, at 
6 o'clock, before the police station was open. This warrant 
was presented to me. at 16 h. on the 26th of May. The second 
factor in my survival decided the colonialists deport me to the 
prisons of the North. They hoped that there the torments and 
humaiations, pressures and most inhumane treatments would 
get the best of my will to fight. Thus, on Sunday 29th of May, 
and by order of Judge Cau, I was deported together with many 
other like our good friend Marthe Bahida, then pregnant, Iloga 
Ngom Aron, Tchoupaniou Thomas, Urn Libam Oscar, Nganko 
Michei, Job Samuel and Togue Christophe, to name only those, 
who were, like me, in a desperate state. 
For a period lasting nearly four months, indicted as I was 
by virtue of the mandate of Judge Cau in Douala, I was yet 
maintained over 1,200 kms from the place of indictment. During 
these four months I endured tortures and torments in the 
Mokoli fortress as well as in the hell-like prison of Maroua, 
where I had to go on a six-day hunger-strike before being sent 
to Douala, by way of Kaele, Garoua, N'Gaoundere and 
Yaounde. 
In Douala, while still under the same treatment and stuck 
in a, small, dark cell, I was the target of the judiciary appa-
ratus: mandate of deposit for organisation of armed bands, 
for rebellion, for violence to agents of the public forces, for 
voluntary blows and wounds, for carrying arms (prohibited), 
for stealing correspondence, for murder, attempt to murder, 
armed robbery, for organisatio-i of seditious reunions, all of 
these being issued by Mr. Cau for the same pretentious facts 
committed in the same period by the same detainee. But 
ridicule reached its highest point when I was extracted from 
my cell in the month if June 1956 by the Judge who notified 
? 17 ? 
me of a new :ndictment : tins was the organising of the UPC 
and ji.),C wrule in prison, and for that the Douala tribunal 
hoz ouneu me with eight months of Jan last March. 
Must I specify that the indictments for winch Judge Cau 
handed me deposit mandates were founded on mere informa-
tions fabricated and concerted by police informers, turned 
professional witnesss a,.minst whom I was not allowed to call 
for cross-examination? All these files dragged me in front 
of the Douala tribunal who often ieserved for me two-year 
jail sentences, which is not in the least negligible. On the 
day of my release, :he 2nd of July, 1957, I had totalled five 
years and two months of emprisonment. 
So then without the fact that accumulation of sentences 
is illegal I would not have obtained my release before the 26th 
' of July 1960. 
The popular solidarity which was extended to me during 
my detention and the enthusiasm with which the popular 
masses greeted me on my release, and ever since, constitutes 
another proof of the strength of our people who observe and 
judge. I am very touched and very grateful. 
The arbitrariness of these (. detentions p has been suffi-
ciently underlined by Mr. Mathip. Yet, because the gravity 
and frequency of such facts one must cite yet one more 
example; that of Mr. Kameny- Anatole and of Dr. Eyidi Bebey, 
delegate of the Notables' Associations at the 10th session of 
the General Assembly of the United Nations, in February 1957. 
:In the course of their intervention they had protested against 
the anti-democratic and brutal policy of the. administrating 
powers. They concluded by affirming that their act of cou-
rage was going to cost thsm a very dear price on their return 
to the territory. The French representative hastily reassured 
them and the United Nations. saving that absolute freedom 
reigned in Kamerun But no sooner had Mr. Karneny returned

to Douala than his domicile was searched and an arrest warrant 
issued for him. On his return he was arrested then released 
three times . As for Dr. Bebey, they waited six months to 
indict him for ? having published in Douala during 1957 in the 
Newspaper ?L'Opinion du Cameroun?, of which he is publish-
ing manager, many articles upholding directly or indirectly 
the reconstitution or maintainance of the UPC, organisation 
dissolved by the decree of the 13th of July 1955: a fact foreseen 
and checked by art. 2 of the law of January 10, 1936.>> 
But after inquest and interrogation the judiciary author-
ities themselves recognised that the motive of indictment did 
not justify detention under any shape. Yet Dr. Bebey was kept 
under arrest for three months, in spite of his plea to be 
paroled in order that he tend to his family and mostly to his 
sick, growing ever numerous by reason of the political-military 
situation of the country. This, although he is himself a former 
Combattant des Forces Frangaises Libres, (Fighter of the 
Free French Forces), decorated with the Legion d'Honneur, 
Croix de Guerre and many other military distinctions... 
111. ? THE; ? COFITN ? PRISONS 
The arrest's and mass-detentions have brought about the 
necessity of making more police premises: police stations, 
stations for preventive or temporary arrests, and jails proper. 
We learn from a letter written by a high. official, Mr. Hu-
bert, dated from March 12, 1955, that this evolution started 
at the time of the letter and was even prepared and planned, 
in particular by the transfer to the ? Police and Justice: 
Construction >> section of sums initially destined to other 
sections. Also jails, waiting rooms, police stations and other 
police premises were enlarged and more were made at this 
period, to the loss of schools and hospitals, mostly in urban 
districts. As for rural centers, the chiefs, mostly those in 
? 19 ? 
Sanaga-Mantime and Bamileke country, were granted author-
isation, personnel and necessary equipment for the jailing of 
those for whom there is no place in premises directly controlled 
by the administrators and Judiciary Police. 
In spite of the construction of more premises for empnson-
- 
inent, one must note the promiscuity which exists there: po-
litical detainees mix with common prisoners; they are all 
treated in the same way; they are deprived of newspapers 
as well as all other publications; their visiting time is reduced 
to nil, even when they must communicate with their defence 
lawyer, if they are allowed any. They wear prison clothes: a 
small ? boubou ? and 50 cms-long pants or 2 yards of blue 
cloth, heads and feet bare. Only French citizens benefit from 
the political regime in the prisons of Douala and Yaounde. 
Housing conditions are of the least sanitary for non-citi-
zens. From the Yaounde prison, we get a letter : ? Suffice 
it for you to know that for seven months now, we have been 
living in unsupportable conditions (narrow cells where live 60 
people, piled upon one another; dark cells, both by day and 
by night, with only a few minutes' outing for natural needs, 
condthen, not every day) and you may get an idea as to the 
life we lead here. But from the very hour we first took sides 
and positioned ourselves, we know that the way to independence 
was strewn with prison and exile. So be sure that the moral 
is very high... ? In Yaounde, they are ? lucky ? to be let out 
for natural needs. Elswhere, in Dschang for example, po-
litical detainees are only allowed to breathe fresh air one hour 
out of 24. That is, 30 minutes in the morning, and 30 in the 
evening. They urinate all together in a 100-litre trough. Their 
beds measure 16 bamboos in width and they get a woven rug 
30 ems by 50 ems. Many die for lack of medical care ; one 
must even get permission to be let into hospital. For food 
they get one big boiled carrot. It is impossible for them to 
wash. Dysentery and other illnesses abound...

? 20 ? 
This is a terrifying picture to which we need only add a 
few words about the surroundings and the work of political 
detainees. The watch over political detainees is maintained 
by military elements of the French gendarmerie. It is wider 
the orders of the gendarmerie that the prison guards work 
and also the ? Kameronian guards D, preferably recruted 
among elements of origin other than Kameronian. The ? Ka-
meronian guards z. and, in some cases, the prison guards, are 
always armed. In any case they are subject to the strictest 
military discipline. The French gendarmes who care for po-
litical prisons relieve their usual raktary chiefs from thei.,. 
military authority and the region chieftain or subdivislonary 
chieftain, who as we know is a political official, from their 
political authority. The wardens and their aids use their arms 
to silence any who dare make any requests. 
To all this are added the painful and hum:liating tasks 
of constructing roads and jails, more jails... But more often, 
they prefer to transfert detainees from prisons directly 
controlled by administrators and Judicial Police to the East 
and the North, for harder work. And so, last June 3, they 
deported 27 prisoners and chained them in the East. They. 
were not allowed to drink on the way. In Abong-Mbang, they 
were tied up and. put in a long-abandoned hut. In the night 
two were bitten by snakes. From the morrow onwards they 
were given double their usual work: old or young ; man or 
woman, they each had to weed a piece 100 ms log by 3 ms 
large, and cut down. at least 10 trees. From Abong-Bbnag they 
were transported to Ijourne, where they were forced to Iwo: It 
without rest from 7 h. to 15 h. By order of the administrator's 
wife, Mrs Lecolley, they had to lift, two by two, a 100-litn-
`,-ough then cut the grass down with their fingers and the...1. 
teeth All they had to eat was five pieces of banana. Bu'. 
this is the regime in official prisons. Worse is the political 
sequestrat.on in torture camps of administrative chiefs or in 
:41-ndartneries. Patriots are sometimes maintained the/ e for 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
? 21 ? 
more than 3 months They arc given all sorts of tasks and 
.snly liberated after payment of sums of money to the pirate 
chiefs. These pe..ople sequestrated for political reaso,is 
camps which are uncontrolled but which work in fact through 
the power of the French authorities, are watched by ?dikoltons? 
(a Bassa word meaning mercenary) who are invested with 
illegal and provocating power by the Administration. As a 
matter of fact it is these last who murder, arrest, search, rape 
women, burn huts and plunder the goods of patriots.. 
The greatest reward the French administration, grants 
the ? dikokons >> is promotion of some of them to so-called 
superior posts and to colonialist immunity, which immunises 
them from any judiciary pursuit on the part of the regime. 
We know how precarious all this is. 
We could not admit that the administrative and judiciary 
authorities ignore deeds perpetrated by themselves or at least 
with their permission. In any case, numerous letters of protest 
have already been submitted to them, one of which we repro-
duce here.

How can men living in such conditions, and who are not 
even cared for medically for the detection of dangerous 
Illnesses, enjoy a healthy life? 
And yet the Douala Prison is big enough to incorporate 
an. extra cell for our use. 
? The undersigned have the honour of submitting to the 
knowledge of the above-mentioned authorities a series of 
questions, which necessitate an urgent solution. 
1) NEWSPAPERS AND BOONS. We are enclosed 
m the Douala prison like in a bell-jar. Not a newspaper, not 
a book worthy of that name ever reaches us. We rot away in 
a little enclosure, in which we are closed all day long. And 
these are human beings who are being jailed for having in-
dulged in political activities, be they judged as subsersive. 
? 2) HEALTH. Even in the case where conditions 
of life and existence in the Douala prison should not be of a 
nature to undermine our health, which as shall be seen, is not 
the case, it is natural that medical care should be assured to 
all individual even if he be a prisoner. But the dispensary in 
the Douala prison is constantly in need of medicine, so that 
the man-nurse in charge writes little pieces of paper all day 
long, which he calls ? dispensary tickets"). One only gets 
tickets, rarely medical care. If at least the serious cases were 
directed to the _hospital one would. have at least a little peace 
of mind. But the need of our, dispensary is equalled by the 
carelessness of the sanitary service and that of the Prison 
Administration. 
? 3) FOOD: QUANTITY. It is known that a law in 
1933 prescribed nothing but ? mambo ), potatoes, innards, 
rice, fish oil and meat for Samerunian prisoners. But the ma-
cabo is thrown with its skin directly into the pot, and not even 
ivashed so that it may at least boil with its skin; the rice is 
? 23 ? 
boiled dirty and conies directly from its sack; the meat or fish 
are cooked rotten, and in. such dishonest conditions there can. 
only be more aches of the stomach. One can also add to this 
chapter the condition in which our victuals coming from town 
are searched by the Prison Administration. The most re-
pugnant objects are thrown in with them. 
? QUANTITY. After lack of hygiene, we are submitted 
to lack of enough food. Even the prescriptions of the famous 
1933 law are not respected. Instead of 100 grammes of meat 
or fish, 0 litre 03 of oil, 20 grammes of salt, 2 kgs 500 of ma-
cabo and 600 grammes of rice, we are given 60 grammes of 
rotten meat or rotten fish, less than 0 litre 02 of oil, less than. 
10 grammes of saltand less than 0 kgs of rice per day. 
? One can imagine the ensuing indignation especially 
when we know that the 1933 law prescribes a different treat-
ment for Europeans, this providing an anachronical effect in 
the institutions of a Kamerun under so-called ? trusteeship x..

in cell measuring only 15 metres in length, 6 m in width, and 
3m50 in height. This is aerated by 4 openings the total area 
of which measures only 8m squared. We are piled upon one 
another, all 81 of us, over an area of square meters. We manage 
to live on a sleepless area of 79 cms squared. And since the 
boards are 2 ms long it is not difficult to guess what the 
reduced width is that is left for each individual to call his 
own; this gives us the impossible digits of 39 cms squared. 
If the 8 ms squared aid not supply us with some air, we would 
have been surely asphyxiated by our 5,888 in cubed; in a very 
few days.

render this permit permanent, taking care, if need be, to have 
it checked every week by the Prison Administration.

IV. - NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLICE AND

Everybody knows that, according to French legislation, the 
Police have no right to question people. Yet, not only do they 
question them, make unwarranted enquiries, but; also do they

brutalise people in an awful manner, as we have already seen 
in the Mathip case (CF. LE supra). Here is another typical 
case, that of Owona Simon-Pierre, detained in the jail-house 
of Sangmeliraa. In a letter to the Justice of the Peace, he 
declares: ? I had always thought that accused were and still 
are at the exclusive disposal fo the Judge, who must hear 
them out in. ordinary or judicial bearings. But such is not 
my case: At the moment I thought I would be called and 
be confronted with those who accuse me, I was called by the 
gendarmerie to undergo a different kind of questioning. The 
Guard NDJANA came to fetch me without the usual extrac-
tion warrant. This worried me, for I knew what had. pa.ppened 
to Owoundi and. Abondo before me. I refused this illegal call. 
Then the brigade commander, together with two of his men, 
erupted into the jail and took me away, kicking and 
beating me. At the gendarmerie I was again hard beaten, 
and NDJANA dealt me a terrible blow in the stomach, which 
stopped my breathing for a while and nearly broke my ribs. ? 
Worse still, the magistrates act exactly like the police. 
Let us hear a detainee from Douala, DZUKAM Chretien. Last 
November 6, he wrote to the Procurator General, chief of the 
judiciary service of Kamerun : When they are taken to the 
Public Prosecutor's office, patriots think themselves protected 
by the law, but they soon find out the contrary. The instruc-
tor-magistrates of the Kamerun teach by menaces and various 
other forms of intimidation. They even go as far as hitting 
accused whi try and. salve their consciences. That is how 
Mr. Roquefort, judge of instruction of the 3rd cabinet of the 
Douala Office of the Public Prosecutor, on the 16th of October 
1957 gave four slaps to the detainee NKOUAM Denis in the 
presence of Mr. I\TDEFO Sebastien, because NKOL'AM refused 
to profer charges against the latter in the course of a con-
frontation. 
 Therefore the expulsion under discussion is abso?
?

lutely unjust, since it is a menace to all Kamerunians, whereas 
non-Kamerunians. particulary Nigerians, are allowed to live 
in the Kamerun, on the condition that they assure Mr. Endeley 
of their total support especially at the time of the elections. 
We have never been, are not, and never shall be against 
our brothers of Nigeria We fight only those of their 
children ? and they, are not numerous ? who let themselves 
be blinded to the extent playing the game of the imperialists. 
our common enemies. We ask these brothers to be conscious 
of their responsabilities as Africans and to pool their efforts 
immediately to squash the common enemy. This attitude is 
the only one conforming both to the common interest and to 
the regime of international trusteeship from whirh the Kame-
run benefits. In fact, articles 73 and 76b of the U.N. Charter 
stipulate that the autorities of the Kamerun must promote 
priorily the interests of the autochtones according to their 
freely-expressed aspirations . This requires first that the 
Kamerunians be granted the right to live in their own 
country, even to the loss of the non-Kamerunians ; secondly 
and consequently. that they may settle anywhree in the Ha-
merun according to their free aspirations 
Contrary to the engagements of the British and the legi-
timate aspirations of the Kamerunians. the law invoked opens 
the way to the arbitrary and constitutes an intolerable pro-
vocation. That is so, because the vagueness of these terms 
makes law applicable even against the autochtones of the same 
zone, on condition that they be living away from their birth-
place. Then, applied in the framework of the fight against 
the patriots, it conceals flagrant violations of other British 
laws. Let us take the well-known case of our compatriot 
EBODE Engelbert actually living in Kumba and affected by 
this law. He is not reproached anything. Better still, having 
lived for more than three years in Kumba and paying his taxes 
SO-Yr 2014/02/06: 
tr. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/02/06 : CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
? 56 ? 
in that distritt, he automatically becomes, in the ziyes of British 
law, a member of the autochtonous community. To pursue 
him would then. be violating principles which we have already 
recalled, principles which demand equality before the law, 
respect of' the right of free opinion and expression, of meetings 
and associations, in short, it would be violating the niter-
national agreements and the spirit of corpus whicii has made 
the reputation of British democracy. That is the result of 
wanting to act against the will of a whole people. The most 
solemn engagements become as vile as the paper on which 
they are written. 
b) Despite its flagrant irregularity, this menace has 
already been endorsed, alas ! On the day on June 9, 1958, the 
Franco-British autorities arrested masses of patriots in. 
Tombel. Present were English policemen and French militaries 
dome from the Bamileke and Mungo regions; commanding 
them were subdivision chiefs and the Kumba District Officer. 
The French colonialists carried with them a list of names and 
photos of our comrades chased after v*.nce 1955. After this 
operation, two patriots were handcuffed and taken to Nkong-
samba. 
Alas! So then the British colonialists could not oppose 
their will to that of their sanguinary French accomplices. In 
the name of what principle was all this done ? Apart from 
wartime when allies would deliver common enemies to each 
others, extradiction does not apply either to freeing slaves or 
political refugees. Yet, most surely, the Kamerunians are not 
slaves but detainees or political refugees fighting for political 
objectives. , 
Does the United Kingdom then want to declare a regular 
war upon the Kamerunian people? If so, in the meantime let 
the French imperialists have the honesty and decency to 
11111?MINIMEN?116_ 
? 57 ? 
recogn:se jut:hem:1y this state of war which, alone, can 5ustify, 
their extradictions. 
As things go, we continue to repeat that extradictions and 
even war are unjust, contrary to international engagements 
undertaken hetween France and Great-Britain towards the 
Kamerunian people. 
5) The result of all these factors is the lamentable 
situation in which the refugees live, either in prisons, forests, 
in shacks, where they are the prey of weather conditions, lack 
of food, and at least one of the afore mentioned disease. (1) 
Unfortunately it is not astonishing that the refugees 
number many dead among their ranks. Let us cite as examples 
the names of Kamga Elias, Tate Abraham, Notake Michel 
Ngassa Calice, Nana Martin 
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
After this parade of millions of patriots arrested, detained, 
arbitrarily deported, inhumanly tortured, tracked down to 
their very shacks by the authorities as well as by misery, 
disease and death, one understands easily if we share the... 
emotion of so many patriots in the Reverend Pastor AKOA 
Abomo exclaimed in his Easter sermon of 1957 :?
? Who can ennumerate the victims of Sanaga-Maritime and 
? of the whole of the Kamerun : the dead, the prisoners, the 
fC escapees in foreign lands, the freedom fighters? How many 
? huts burned, hamlets partly or totally set afire? Plundered 
? goods, plundered and stolen and destroyed, cattle stolen and 
? killed? Who can ennumerate the bereaved, the widows and

get rich quickly, these sons of JudAs? Who can evaluate 
the hatred the lies and the false testimonies against the 
neighbours? Who can write about the tortures practised 
are the detainees, during this odious and savage killing of 
people, even of great sons of the nation? Who can tell now 
and who will tell in the future this story without crying out 
and gritting his teeth? 
? How and with what can one soothe the woman of Sa-
? naga-Maritime or the one elsewhere, the woman whose 
husband is somewhere dead, or in prison, or fighting in the 
underground, or one knows not where, who can soothe the 
woman who drinks and eats uneasily? If thousands of francs 
? are not enough to pay for the thousands of damages, then 
? hundreds of thousands or even millions are by far insuf-
? ficient to soothe these miseries, even for one hour's time. 2. 
(At these words, relates ? L'Opinion du Cameroun >> in its 
edition af May 6, 1957, the emotion was so high that one could 
notice people wiping their tears.) 
Naturally, we would be very glad to see all the world 
admit the legitimacy of all liberating struggles, especially those 
which, like ours, are performed within the framework of 
particularly clear and precise international agreements; we 
would be very glad to see that everybody understand that the 
movement of independence of a people is irreversible, that 
a people such as ours is invincible, fighting united for an un-
recognised right, ,its liberty ravished and its future menaced 
in a country 33 % of which is forest, and which it knows better 
? than anybody else. 
Even if, unfortunately, we do not succeed in attaining 
all this, we hope at least to provoque the minimum reaction in 
.a normal man. We hope that there will not be imperialists 
? 59 ? 
too patemel or greedy to refuse to examine objectively these 
facts ,to provoque or organise serious enquiries and the active 
solidarity propaganda which is needed with these facts. But 
let us hope that everyone may realize more and more concretelY 
this phrase by Juvenal: ? I am a man and nothing that is 
human. is unknown to me. x, In fact, at a time of artificial 
satellites, the earth has shrunk so much that the prolongation 
of so barbarious a drama may easily endanger the whole 
world... This is why we launch a world-wide appeal in favour 
of the principle so magnificently formulated at the very start 
of the UNIVERSAL Declaration of the Rights of Man: ? The 
recognition and dignity inherent to all members of the human 
family and their equal and unalienable rights constitute the 
foundation of liberty, of justice and of peace in the world. >>

GENEVA 
s/c from his representative in Cairo, 
8, Abdel Khalek Santrat Street, 
CAIRO. 
Mr. Secretary General, 
Cairo, July 4, 1958. 
Since its creation your organisation has not ceased to 
care for the many victims which have accumulated through 
the tragic events which have for more than quarter of a 
century upset the human conscience. At the time of the last 
World War, as at the time of the war waged for eight years 
by France against the valiant Indochinese people, at the time 
of the Korean war, as at the time of the war which led to 
the independence of the Tunisian and Moroccan people, the 
International Red .Cross was able to succour tens of thousands 
of wOunded. The Red Cross was mobilised also at the time 
of the unfortunate situation created by the Hungarian counter-
revolution. Barely yesterday she was on the job again at 
Sakiet Sidi Youssef. She continues to do all she can to help 
in Algeria. 
? 61 ? 
Taken up as she is by the multitude of these bloody 
dramas, this international organisation has certainly not had 
the time to consider the painful tragedy which, since May 25, 
1955, has made millions of victims in the Kamerun, particularly 
in the part under French adminstration. Yes, since May 25, 
1955 the French Government has been piling up the horrors 
in the Kamerun, the horrors which she administers to all the 
people who, tired of bending under the yoke of her colonial 
regime, demand that they be treated as free men, rather than 
eternally vanquished. 
Till lately, the great French press has accorded only 
relative importance to this situation. ? Police operations ?, 
? enforcing of public order 2., etc., such are the terms used 
by the papers of the regime to designate the poignant drama 
which the Kamerunian people have been living for the past 
three years. 
But how and why did one arrive to the present drama? 
This is easy to understand. In fact, the American writer, 
C.L. Sulzberger, wrote recently: 
? The abandon of an empire is a process nearly as cruel 
and bloody as its forniation. This ancient truism of history 
has been learnt successively by Rome, Madrid, Vienna and 
Constantinople. It is now the turn of London and Paris to 
get acquainted with its sad and sour truth. 2. 
On the morrow of the second World War, a war which 
was waged and won by all the freedom-loving men of the world, 
the Kamerunians did not remain indifferent to the manifest-
ations of anti-colonialism which were carried out in Asia and 
Africa, by the people who were still oppressed by a foreign 
despotism. They then organised themselves, on April 10, 
1048, In a powerful movement of national liberation: The

UNION OF POPULATIONS OF THE CAMEROUN, with a 
very precise programme of action. 
Naturally such a programme with interests diametrically 
opposed to those prohibited by the masters of the hour in 
colonised countries, would soon become the ? nightmare ? of 
these latter. And yet the new international statute under 
which the Kameru.n had just been placed left no doubt as to 
thel political future in store for the populations of territories 
under trusteeship. The Kamerunian people, more and more 
awake to the national consciousness, proved by its firm de-
termination that it put a price ? not too high, of course ? on 
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the 
Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man. 
Here, we should cite again the writer Sulzberger, to allow 
you to understand ea-sly the origins of the drama which for 
three years has been tearing the people of the Kamerun. In 
the article from which a passage has been cited before, the 
American author wrote, in fact: 
> 
So then, despite good right and reason being on their side 
in the emancipating struggle already frankly engaged, the 
Warnerunian patriots had to face bloodshed; France, feeling 
the ground giving way from under her, had to make them pay 
the heavy ransom which the struggle for Independence carries 
with it. That is the origin of the massacres which in May 1955 
made at the very least 5,000 dead. At the same time as 
? 63 ? 
unconsoled widows and orphans, misery installed itself as 
master in the country. This serious social plague toorned 
lager with the impressive development of the tragedy ; the 
prisons were filling up at a disquieting pace. For a year 
although reduced to clandestinity, the National Movement 
continued to organise itself a.vhle making cffers of negotiations 
to the administrative authonties. 
But the more it launched appeals, the less it was taken 
notice of ; the summary executions continued to grow in 
number as if to invite the nationalists to be less naive. In 
December 1956, date of the semblance of elections organised 
in application of a law conceived by the Paris Government for 
the integration of Kamerun in the French colonial empire, the 
war came into the open. Intervening before the Nth Com-
mission of the 12th session of the U.N. General Assembly, 
where he was testifying in the name of the populations of his 
country, a Kamerunian petitionary reported 480 dead-alone in 
the very small village of Baham. (Cf. Doc. A/C 4/SR 715 of 
the United Nations.) A no less authorised testimony, because 
made by a sworn enemy of the Kamerunian people ... we are 
talking now of Mr. Louis-Paul Aujoulat ? assures in an inter-
view with ? Temoignage Chretien ? (Feb. 2, 1957) that on 
January 10, nearly a thousand persons had died by French 
bullets. Other newspapers ? L'Effort Camerounais ? (No. 68, 
13-19 January 1957) and ? La Presse du Cameroun, (March 
14, 1957) who bore no suspicion of sympathy for Kamerunian 
nationalism did not forget to stigmatise the killings of Decem-
ber 1956. The last-cited newspaper affirmed, on the basis of 
authoritative information, that: ? more than 10,000 human 
beings are without shelter and live in the worst of penuries ?. 
And since then the situation has only worsened. On Dec. 11, 
1957, the special correspondent of > was able to 
write: ? From this date (i.e. September 6, 1957) there has not 
been a day or night without bloodshed, without the burning of

villages, without the plundering of huts. A balance would be 
difficult to- establish. >> 
From the first days of 1958 important troops reinforce-
ments left for the Kamerun. On January 7, 1958, the ? New 
York Times >> reporter 29 persons killed and 17 kidnapped 
within a period of seven weeks. 
One, then, cannot continue indefinitelk to conceal and 
minimise an operation which has ceased to be a commonplace 
call to order. It is a question now of real war waged by France 
against a people to which she was supposed, through the 
engagements subscribed in the U.N., to grant autonomy or 
independence according to the freely expressed aspirations of 
the said people. It is this flagrant violation which has brought 
many member-states of the U.N. to condemn the policy of 
France towards its ward, in the debates of the Nth Commission 
(1957) as well as during the 21st session of the Trusteeship 
Council. The intervention of the Indian delegate is particularly 
significant. He did not just condemn France's attitude. Inter-
vening in the debate on the grave sttuation created in the 
Kamerun by t.ne policy of strength of the French Government, 
the honorable delegate, Mr. Ajoy. Kumar Mitra exclaimed: 
? For the first time in history arms have been used in a ter-
ritory under U.N. trusteeship in order to master the popular 
will. >> He then requested the sending of an on-the-spot mission 
of judicial enquiry to examine the situation in order to bring 
back the peace... His suggestion, conforming with the wishes 
of the Kamerunian populations, was unfortunately rejected 
because in the U.N., instead of principles, it is the policy dear 
to certain powers which prevails. 
Mr. Secretary-General,

imperialism also signed the

to these treaties and agreements, 
the imperialists were able to 
station their troops in Iraq and 
make use of the Iraqi military 
bases ; the Iraqi army was under 
the rule of British and American 
officials: moreover, the British 
and American secret agent 
could supervise and control the 
affairs of various departments of 
Iraqi government. At the same 
time, a flock of Iraqi ruler& 
whose sole aim was to seek 
their own profits by betraying 
their country and people. having 
been long fed on by their 
foreign masters, were alv.-alfs 
ready at their master's beck 
and call. Meanwhile they 
used to suppress their people 
savagely, and played the role as 
degenerate clowns against people. 
as also Arab solidarity and na-
tional independence. As a matter 
of fact, wherever the imperialist 
domination is more ferocious and 
barbarous, the concentrated con-
tradiction turns out to be more 
conspicous and acute. When 
people are unable to live 
under the suppression of im-
perialist and feudal forces, 
they can not but arise to 
struggle for survival and 
freedom. As imperialists forced 
upon the Iraqi people a policy to 
spilt the unity of the Arab people, 
the later could not but rise to 
defend and win this unity. As 
imperialists turned Iraq into a 
military base and drove Iraqi 
people to serve as cannon

in October 1936, through a revo-
itn.onary coup cidtat of nation-
alists and military men, a nation-
alist .government was estabished, 
which continued up to August 
1937. Though abolished after 
that, this nationalist government 
was,-a -severe blow to the British 
colonialists. 
:'..After. the outbreak of World 
War II. Biitish imperialism, in 
order_to further strengthen its 
domination over Iraq, signed the 
C'Prirtsmouth Ally. Treaty :b 
with the feudal monarchy. 
InStigated? by British imperialism, 
the ?feudal monarchy put a large 
number of patriots into prisons, 
_abolished all the people's organ-
izations and prohibited all the 
patriotic movements. In order to 
fight against traitorous criminal 
actions of the feudal monarchy, in 
1948,. the Iraqi people launched 
a large-scale uprising and over-
threw the then Nuri El-Said 
government. The influence of this 
uprising was such that it ex-
tended- to all the Middle East 
countries where an anti-British 
stormy' movement was waged by 
the :people. 
? 
During the "-years after the 
World- War II, the colonial do-
mination -o.f:American imperialism 
penetrated rapidly into Iraq. 
Therefore, it added new and more 
formidable elements to the fight-
ing task with which the Iraqi 
people were confronted. During 
the years 1951-1954, the heroic 
struggles of Iraqi people were car-
ried out successively one after 
another throughout the country. 
But none succeeded. The re-
volutionary force suffered a big 
loss. For instance, during the 
armed uprising in 1952, almost 
two thousand patriotic elements 
were arrested and executed. 
The revolutionary force gra-
dually drew lessons from the 
numerous blood-shed defeats. 
At the end of 1956, the 
various revolutionary parties and 
groups of Iraq and non-party 
patriotic and democratic elements 
found a National United 
Front. Thus a fighting program-
me was proclaimed : Withdraw 
from Baghdad Pact; oppose 
Eisenhower Doctrine; unite 
closely with Arab Nationalism; 
adopt an independent foreign 
policy which is apart from 
imperialist influence and based 
on the principles of safeguarding 
world peace and establishing 
friendly relations with all 
countries. In domestic affairs, 
the programme promulgated : 
Bring about democracy and 
freedom; release all political 
prisoners, defend national re-
sources and develop national 
economy. After the formation 
of this National United Front,

the people. Once the balance 
of forces have changed, the 
imperialist and feudal forces will 
be ruined as if they are sitting 
'on an erupting volcano. The 
Iraqi revolution testified this very 
truth. It will also be applied to 
the colonial and semi-colonial 
countries, which are now still 
under the yoke of imperialism 
without exception. As to the 
imperialist countries, the places 
where they themselves consider 
that their colonial domination is 
most solid and most reliable can 
likewise be turned into volcano in 
a second. 
Th 2 victory of Iraqi revolution 
is a great victory for the Arab 
people's struggle for independ-
ence. In the past few years. 
the people's struggles for na-
tional independence in the Middle 
East have been forging 
ahead like waves one after 
another and each of them is 
higher than the previous one. 
After the victory of the 
Egyptian people's resistance to 
Anglo-French aggression, the 
Syrian people achieved victory 
in fighting against armed pro-
vocation of Anglo-American 
imperialism in collusion with 
Turkey. And the revolution-
ary - struggles of the peoples 
of Lebanon, Yemen, Oman and 
Jordan have never ceased. All 
these struggles for national 
independence and their victories 
have been mutually supported, 
mutually responded and mutually 
linked together closely. The great 
victory of Iraqi people's revolution 
has been achieved on the basis 
of the anti-imperialist struggles 
of the Arab people. In the future, 
it will in turn influence the 
national movements in other 
countries leading to a new up-
surge. Wherever the national 
revolutionary forces launch at-
tacks, the imperialists aro compel-
led to come on defensive. In 
the Middle East today, the 
powerful force is not that of 
imperialism but that of the 
national revolution. At present, 
it is the epoch of national 
liberation and no more that 
of colonialism. 
The Iraqi revolution has 
triumphed, but how difficult and 
protracted the struggle was. 
Facing this brilliant victory, 
the Anglo-American imperialists 
will not submit to it. Here-
after, they will again try to use 
every possible device such as 
intimidation, bribery, disinte-
gration and subversion either 
in open or covert to menace 
the new-born Iraqi Republic. 
Nevertheless, the Iraqi revolution-
ary government and people 
know it very well and they 
are determined to defend the 
fruits they won: An example is 
enough to explain the whole 
situation. During my stay 
in Baghdad, once I visited a vil-
lage in the suburb, and met many 
plain and industrious peasants. 
While talking about the re-
OCT. ? DEC. 1958 
35 
volution, all the peasants were 
so anxious to take the lead 
to speak: ? Land will be 
distributed to us. We will speed 
up production and support this 
new government forever ?. 
Another one stared at the 
sky, with his hand on his 
bosom, and said: ? Despot has 
passed away. I will devote 
all my life to revolution ?. 
Right at that time an old man 
called Hadid, with a stick in his 
hand, squeeezed in the crowd out 
of breath as if he had just 
walked for a long distance. 
The old man shouted with 
tears flashing in his eyes : ? I 
intend to send my son into the 
army in order to defend re-
volution. Since there are too 
many people in Baghdad, I 
got no chance for enlistment. 
Tomorrow, I will send my 
son to other places ?. Again 
he said : If I would be 
accepted inspite of my old 
age, I would also join the 
volunteers. In case I should 
die, I would rather go to the 
hell! ? Look, how heroic and 
courageous the people are ! 
It is crystal clear to the 
Iraqi people that in order to 
consolidate their revolutionary 
tasks, construction work must be 
carried out in good order. A 
lawyer told me: ? Rome was not 
built in one day, but it must have 
a start ?. Now the Iraqi people 
have already begun their start. 
While you are standing on the 
roof of the high mansion of 
Baghdad Hotel you can see rows 
of chimneys of cement plants and 
other factories in the distance 
belching thick smoke. Of course, 
the most important industry is 
that of the petroleum. I had 
visited a state-operated oil 
ra finery called Doula which is 
built on a very large scale. The 
worl,ers exert all their efforts in 
production, because they under-
stand that this is the heart 
of their country which cannot 
stop its beating even for a 
second. Once it stops, the whole 
country will be paralyzed. There-
fore they are accelerating the 
vibration of this heart. At the 
end of my visit, an engineer 
led us to the top of a water 
tower where I could see the 
whole view as far as possible. 
It is really a piece of fertile 
land with River Tigris rolling 
beside it. The engineer said: 
? People know that we have 
River Tigris and River Euphrates, 
but they do not know we 
have another river bigger than 
these two ? that is the petrol-
eum river flowing underground. 
From now on, we will make 
every effort to exploit this 
subterranean river to build our 
new life ?. While speaking, he 
turned his eyes to and stared at 
the River Tigris. From the 
meaningful expression of his 
eyes, I could see the far-seeing 
ideal of Iraqi people.

? Ninety per cent of China's population are of the 
Han race. Apart from these are other minorities, 
namely, the Mohamtnedans, Mongols, Tibetans, Manchu, 
Shans and Li peoples. Though the standard of living 
of these people vary, they all have a long period of 
history. China is a country composed of a conglomera-
tion of peoples and it has enormous population. ?.

? Although the minority peoples constitute only 6 
per cent of the country's total population, the areas in-
habited by them roughly amount to 60 per cent of the 
country's total area. Many of these areas are rich in 
various kinds of industrial resources. It is clearly wrong 
to think that our country can be built into a great social-
ist country through the efforts of the Han people alone, 
without the concerted efforts and active participation 
of the national minorities ?.

based on the capacity of a fixed area to support an estimated population is 
indicated in Shang Tze (350 B C.). supposed to be a booklet or monooraph by 
Shang Yang, the famous Chin Minister. In the chapter on tel Ming (Encoura-
gement of Immigration), it is said ? Within an area of 100 Ii square, 10 per cent 
is mountain and hills, and 10 per cent is marshes and pcnds ; 10 per cent is 
brooks and water channels; 10 per cent is in ci?ies and residences. roads, and 
pathways; and only 40 per cent of them are fertile fields for cultivation (Pas-
sage discontinues here probably due to loss of records). The produce from 
this area (100 li square) was sufficient to provide for 50,000 foo (man, probably 
with wife). Moreover, the mountains, brooks, marshes, etc., wi.hin this area 
were sufficient to provide the materials (fuel, fish, animals, etc.) to be used 
by these people (50,000); and the cities, residences, roads, paths, etc., were 
sufficient for the people to live in and to use. This completed the system of 
administration by the a ancient Kings. (Economic History of China, by Mabel 
Ping-hua Lee pp. 145-146). 100 Ii square contains 9,000 000 mow ancient (i.e. 
Chow measures).

AFRO-ASIAN QUARTERLY 
The Pao Chia system 
The objective of the Han po-
pulation count, as of the succeed-
ing dynasties, was the collection 
of taxes and to obtain men for 
military service and forced labour. 
By 754 A.D., the most prosperous 
period of the Tang Dynasty, a 
detailed enumeration records the 
figure of 52,919,309. In the Sting 
Dynasty (960 - 1260 A.D.) the 
Pao Chia system was introduced, 
whereby every locality was divid-
ed into groups of households with 
one man responsible for each 
group, collecting taxes, impressing 
men for military service and 
forced labour and making an an-
nual return of the number of 
people under his control. This 
Pao Chia system continued 
through the 16th century, was 
taken over by the Manchu 
Dynasty and lasted right up to 
the Taiping Revolution about 100 
years ago, when the Pao Chia 
network was largely destroyed. 
Thanks to this Pao Chia system. 
some estimates of population and 
amount of cultivated land in dif-
ferent periods of Chinese history 
are available. Mabel Ping-hua 
Lee, in the her admirable (though 
unfortunately, apparently, little 
known) study has compiled an 
elaborate table 1? from the Chinese System of taxation and population 
records available. Besides the enumeration 
population estimate, she has given An important factor contributing 
the total amount Of cultivated land, to wide inaccurancy of the popu-
and average amount of land per 
mouth. Too much meaning 
must not be attached to these fi-
gures. Mabel Ping-hua Lee her-
self remarks that the figures are 
probably quite erroneous :o. But 
she adds : ? Despite the inac-
curacy of the figures they are still 
significant in that they reflect the 
general conditions of Chinese 
history as well as the conditions 
of the special Nriods when pro-
perly interpreted ?. The table in-
dicates that in the beginning of 
later Han the population is re-
duced to two-thirds; in the three 
Kingdoms by about six-sevenths 
in the beginning of Tang by about 
two-thirds ; in the beginning of 
Sung by over a fourth ; and the 
beginning of Tsing, by over three-
fifths. While the figures cannot 
be sacrosanct, they nevertheless 
confirm the conclusion that wars, 
which inevitably preceded the 
overthrow of an old and enthrone-
ment of a new dynasty, caused 
much destruction and misery to 
Chinese people and had the effect 
of interrupting the increase of 
Chinese population. Furthermore, 
the deaths by the million of 
Chinese toilers caused by inces-
sant floods and droughts affect-
ed the population.

lotion returns was the system of 
taxation. Apart from free 
service (corvi), the peasants were 
required to pay the poll tax, that 
is, a tax based on number of 
members in the family. The people 
concealed the number of mouths 
in the family in order to escape 
the taxation based on them. This 
is indicated by the fact that when 
Kao Kung. a statesman of the Sui 
Dynasty. to a certain extent light-
ened the burden of taxation, 
the population figures show an 
increase of from three to eight 
million doors within the 19 years 
from 587 - 606 A.D. A more 
convincing proof of the same is 
provided during the rule of the 
Tsing Dynasty. In the wake of 
long drawn out peasant uprisings 
extending for about a century, 
the Manchus. in order to conso-
lidate their rule could not but 
make some concession to the 
peasants against the landlords. 
The reforms sought the abolition 
of poll-tax and the corvi system 
(forced free labour). The peasants 
were now required to pay taxes 
according to the quantity of land 
they possessed and not according 
to the number of members in the 
family. The Corvi system forced 
the peasants to do free labour ac-
cording to the number of family 
members. With the abolition of 
this system, government hired men 
instead. Landlord resistance pre-
% cnted the materialisation of the 
reforms for about a hundred years, 
but when the reforms were finally 
decreed in 1712 1, the number of 
mouths jumped by 1749 from 24 
million to 124 million, whereas 
never before in history had the 
population been returned as over 
one hundred million. 
Western ? China experts x. misre-

The accurancy or otherwise of 
the available population figures 
apart, there can hardly be any 
doubt about the increasing pres-

and avenues of employment

maximum from the tillers. Incid-
entally, many Western writers on 
China, ignoring this peasant 
exploitation, have with amazing 
facility offered this factor of 
growing population as the root 
cause of all China's evils and 
poverty. To this aspect we shall 
revert later. It may suffice to say 
here that harping on the tune of 
overpopulation as the cause of 
China's evils reveals a level of 
consciousness which obtained in 
China 24 centuries ago when the 
tremendous prospects opened up 
-by the growth of science and 
technique were not known. For 
example, compare the wail of the 
Western writers with the fol-
lowing comment of Han Fei-tzu of 
the Chou Dynasty on the effect of 
increasing numbers on prosperity. 
In the ancient times people were 
few but wealthy and without 
strife; the government gave neither 
rewards nor punishments because 
people were self-controlled. People 
at present think five sons are not 
too much, and each son has five 
sons also; and when the grand-
father is not dead, there are 
twtwentyfive descendents. There-
fore, people are more and wealth 
is less; they work hard and receive 
little. Even if the government uses 
twice as much reward and twice 
as much punishment strife cannot 
be prevented. The wealth of a 
ii 
nation depends upon people 
having enough food, not upon the 
number of people. :t 1. 
Dr. Sun yat-senon the problem of 
China's growing population. 
As against the Western ? China 
experts who stuck to this theory 
of population increase as an 
absolute evil against which 
nothing could be done, their 
object being to hide the savagery 
of shameless Western imperialist 
penetration of China, the leaders 
of Chinese renaissance, while 
deeply aware of the dangers of an 
indiscriminate increase in popula-
tion, were at the same time awake 
to the need for the adoption of 
timely means to remedy its effects. 
Thus, as early as 1894, Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen wrote to Li Hung-chang 
as follows : ? At present China is 
already greatly suffering from 
overpopulation, 'which will bring 
impending danger in its wake. She 
is confronted with a great many 
hidden uprisings and frequent fa-
mines. It is extremely difficult 
for the populous masses to make a 
living even during good years, and 
in time of great drought and 
famine many people will starve to 
death. Our food problem is 
already very acute. The situation 
will be much worse as time goes 
on. If we take no timely means of 
remedy, it will surely worry us. :o2 
10. 
The widespread notion that per-
sisted during the later part of 
the 19th century that there are 
400 million Chinese is based on 
the. estimate of 413,020,000 made 
by the Manch government in 1842. 
In 1900, the Manchu government 
reported 440 million. A census in 
its modern sense was started in 
1908 by the Manchus as a prepar-
atory step towards the intro-
duction of a constitutional mo-
narchy. It was completed in 1911 
but the revolution swept away the 
Manchu dynasty in the same year. 
Results made public a few years 
later revealed that China then 
had 374,223,008 people, which is 
generally regarded as an under-
statement. 
The 1912 Population Census 
Immediately after its establish-
ment, the Republican government 
conducted a census in 1912. A 
high Kuomintang official later cal-
led it ? the most complete census 
of China (not meaning by 
that the best or most trustworthy 
census) 3.1 It gives for each hsien 
(county) of each province such 
statistical data as number of males 
and famales, households, number 
of births and deaths, number of 
married and unmarried males, etc. 
The occupational classification 
gives figures about members 
of Parliament, government of-
ficials and employees, teachers 
and students, priests and nuns, 
lawyers, journalists, medical doc-
tors, farmers, miners, merchants 
manufacturers, fishermen, etc. D. 
K. Lieu points out that the five 
occupations above, from farmers 
to fishermen, are not clearly defin-
ed. He says that the Chinese 
wording may refer to farmers, 
miners, factory labourers and 
fishermen, or it may include also 
landlords, mine-owners, industrial-
ists and owners of fishing fleets. 
? The occupational classification is 
unsatisfactory, and any detailed 
analysis on that basis may not be 
worthwhile 
This 1912 census failed to 
cover three provinces, namely, 
Kwangtung, Kwangsi and Anhwei 
but included the three eastern 
provinces of Manchuria, the spe-
cial administrative district of 
Kingchao, Suiyan and also Sin-
kiang. In addition to population 
data, the census also gives the 
area of each hsien, the acreage 
cultivated and uncultivated, the 
heights of mountains and hills, 
and the length of rivers in the 
hsien, and a host of other inform-
ations not relating to population

Another 1912 estimate 
D.K. Lieu has also given an 
estimated for election purposes. 
The Election Law of the Lower 
House, promulgated on August 
10, 1912, provided, among other 
qualifications, that an elector must 
be of the male sex, and of twenty 
one years of age and above It 
was also provided that one mem-
ber should be returned to the 
Lower House by every 800,000 
population, but where the total 
population of a province was 
below 8 000,000, th3t province 
should at least return 10 members. 
It is pointed out that before the 
census enumeration was complet-
ed, the number of members for 
each province was fixed by the 
law. Multiplying the number by 
800,000, Lieu arrives at figures 
which ? represent the population 
of the province as estimated by 
the law-makers of 1912 except 
where the minimum of ten was 
assigned as in the case of Kirin, 
Heilungkiang, Sinkiang and 
Tibet ?. The following table gives

Another 1929 estimate 'placed the figure at 419,957,000. A Maritime Customs 
estimate in 1931 gives the figure of 438,933,373. There is also mentioned a 1936

Density of population 
The final figure, announced in 
1931, placed China's population at 
474, 787,346, which can at best 
be considercd only a rough 
estimate, since only 12 provinces 
made returns to the Central 
Government, apart from special 
other commodities, upon the circulation of mail matter, or upon estimates as to 
the number and size of households others are simply based on the arbitrary 
judgement or guess of local magistrates. 3. (See Contemporary China I, 1955,

Thus, according to Chen's table, 
Kiangsu topped the list with 813 
persons to a square mile, which is 
more than the average density of 
Belgium. Hopei and Chekiang 
come next, while in Chahar, 
Suiyan and Sinkiang the popul-
ation is sparse. 
Divergent estimates about the 
density of population in pre-
liberation China are available. A 
British estimate placed it at only 
43 to the square kilometre 1, 
whereas Cressey places it at 120 
to the square mile ? in terms of 
Greater China, that is, including 
all Mongolia and Tibet. ?z 
Figures of China's average dens-
ity, however, can be most 
misleading unless they are related 
to the characteristics of the area 
to which they apply. Estimating 
that 80 per cent of the total 
population depends on agriculture 
and only 10 per cent of the area 
is arable, the British publication 
places the average density of 
farm population on arable land at 
400 to the square kilometre. 
Excluding the Mongolian and 
Tibetan areas, Cressey estimates

that the density of population will 
rise to 156 per square mile in the 
twenty-eight provinces of China 
He adds : Much of provincial 
China is semiarid and mountan-
ous and the greater mass of 
population is restricted to the 
Eastern half which may be termed 
agricultural China. Here the 
density is 326 per, square mile. ? 
A true picture of China's dens-
ity of population can be had only 
in reference to smaller units, such 
as political provinces or geograph-
ic regions. In another public-
ation Cressey estimates that the 
average density in North China 
(Yellow River) Plain is 647 and 
Szechuan Basin 580 per square 
mile. In terms of the number of 
persons per square mile of cult-
ivated land, the population

as 1485.1 
Steady Increase in Population 
Warren H. Chen regards the 
1912 Census as a ? most 
complete ? one since the format-
ion of the Republic and says 
that ? the figures for 1912 are 
no less trustworthy than those of 
1910. ? We are indebted to Chen 
for the following comparative 
table of population returns of 
1910, 1912, 1928, indicating a 
steady increase :

Thus, the average rate of an-

that this rate is true of all other 
provinces and outlying territories,

Chen has estimated that by the 
end of 1929 the probable popul-
ation of all China was in the 
neighbourhood of 445,000,000.

Birth-rate and Death-rate in pre-
liberation China 
Owing to the diversity of social, 
economic and natural conditions, 
and also owing to natural cala-
mities and disasters, the birth-
rate and death-rate in China dif-
fered in the different parts of the 
country. No reliable vital statist-
ics of pre-liberation China being 
available, the birth and death 
rates of China have been guessed 
on the basis of data collected on 
a fragmented basis and cannot be 
considered accurate. The Depart-
ment of Agricultural Economics 
.of the Nanking University on the 
basis of limited data collected in 
101 rural communities of 16 
provinces reported a birth-rate of 
83.9 per thousand and death-
rate of 27.6 per thousand. Ac-
cording to a study conducted 
under the Milbauk Memorial 
Fund in 1934, China's birth-rate 
.was estimated at 36.6 per 
thousand, the death-rate 25.7 per 
thousand, and infant mortality at 
153 per thousand. T.R. Tregear 
of the Hongkong University, on 
the basis that world population is 
increasing at 75,000 per day and 
the Indian Republic at 14,000 per 
day, puts China's increase at 
14,000 per day or 9 million per 
annum 1. A survey of a rural 
community conducted under the 
auspices of the Institute of 
Pacific Relations by Sidney D. 
Gamble between 1933 and 1936, 
gave a birth-rate of 4G 
and a death-rate of 27 per 
thousand, thus indicating a natur-
al increase of 13 per thousand 
per annum. 2. Whatever may be 
the actual figures, there can be 
no doubt that the birth-rate and. 
the death-rate, as also the rate 
of infant mortality were high in 
China. 
The only area of China where 
data on population changes have 
been available in an unbroken 
series is Taiwan, which was 
acquired by the Japanese in 1895. 
and for which comprehensive 
census and registration reports are 
available. The rate of growth of 
population in Taiwan between 
1895 and 1945 has been 1.76 per 
cent per year. The population 
more than doubled and the rate 
of increase steadily accelerated 
until it reached 2.5 per cent by 
1940. 3. A variety of factors make 
the Taiwan example only of 
limited value for the understand-
ing of China's population pro-
blems, but the fact of a steady 
tendency for its increase clearly 
stands out.

Land utilisation and Population 
According to one estimate 75 
per cent of the population was 
engaged in agriculture in China 
in 1939 1. Estimates for an earlier 
period is given by Cressey. He 
says that probably the best indic-
ation of the percentage of 
people who live on farms is found 
in the figures of the Directorate 
of Statistics for 1932 which lists 
the number of farm households as 
58,579,181, or 74.5 per cent of the 
total. Cressey also tells of how 
the extent of the rural population 
was estimated by Torgasheff. 
Torgasheff stated that there were 
112 cities with over 100,000 in-
habitants, 467 known cities bet-
ween 100,000 and 25,000, and 
1,443 other cities of unknown size, 
.-so that the total urban population 
is hardly less than 100,000,000, 
that, is not less than 20 per cent 
of the total population ?. Thus 
the rural population works out to 
80 per cent of the total popul-
ation 2. 
There are not enough statistics 
available about land utilisation by 
China's overwhelming peasant 
population and allied matters. 
Chang-Heng Chen, a member of 
China's Legislative Yuan and also 
of the Board of Directors, Chinese 
Economic Society, in a paper sub-
mitted to the Tokyo session of 
the International Statistical Instit-
ute in 1930, has given an 
interesting table 3 showing the 
total area of cultivated land in 
China from 1661 to 1916, and the 
per capita average :

It thus follows that with the 
increase in population, the per 
capita average of cultivated land 
decreased. In a paper]. submitted 
to the Vth Biennial Conference 
of the Institute of Pacific Relations 
in Canada in 1933, W.H. Wong, 
Director of the National Geo-
graphical Survey of China, 
estimated that in China  Cressey says that 
cultivated land in China was only 
0.43 acre per person. 
Occupational Distribution of 
Population 
China's population counts are 
poor in so far as collection of 
statistics relating to the occupat-
ional distribution of population 
is concerned. A post-liberation 
publication of the Economic Re-
search Institute of Academia Si-
nica has published in 1955 a most

The Editors tell us that the 
source for these figures is Agri-
cultural Information Report, Vol. 
V. a work of Kuomintang Go-
vernment officials. The limitations 
of these figures have to be borne 
in mind. The Editors say that 
the a Tenant 7> and 4: Semi-
Tenant ) may include poor pea-
sants or middle peasants and. 
also include rich peasants. The 
Self-cultivating owner >> may be 
including not only poor peasants, 
middle peasants and rich peasants 
but also may include managing 
landlords. In the absence of 
figures expressing the situation 
regarding wage employment in 
rural areas and the number of 
hired agricultural labourers, this 
table can at best be regarded as 
giving a rather blurred picture of 
the livelihood pattern of rural 
China of the time. Even then it 
would be noted that the tenants 
and semi-tenants were in far 
excess of the self-cultivating 
owners. 
The livelihood pattern before 
liberation : A clearer picture 
A clearer picture of the liveli-
hood pattern in different areas of 
China is provided by Table IX 
(p. 261 of the above publication. 
Table No. 1). The Editors have 
given in the footnote to the table 
the sources from where the 
figures are taken. They include 
the studies of Dr. Chen Han-
seng and such other reputed 
agrarian experts of pre-liberation 
China and also Kuomintang 
Government surveys. The Editors 
also mention some qualifying 
factors, but by and large the 
picture of rural classes in old 
China is indicated in Table IX. 
(in the following page). 
Overwhelming percentage of 
landless in preliberation days 
The table thus reveals the land 
situation as it existed in China-
before the War of Resistance to 
Japanese aggression. The general 
picture that emerges is as follows: 
landlords constituted 1-5 per cent 
of rural households, the rick 
peasants 5-10 per cent, the middle-
peasants 15-30 per cent, while-
the poor peasants and farmhands 
constituted 50-70 per cent of the 
total number of rural households. 
In other words 10 per cent of the 
landlords and rich peasants con-
trolled and dominated over 80-9Cin 
per cent of the middle and poor 
peasants and the farmhands, the 
labouring masses of rural China. 
The percentage of diffrent types-
of tenants in the total tenant 
households in some important 
agricultural areas of China is in-
dicated in Table X (on page-
52).

AFRO-ASIAN QUARTERLY 
Peoples' China conducts first 
authoritative Census in Chinese 
History 
After liberation the first author-
itative statement about China's 
population was made by Premier 
Chou En-lai on June 16, 1950, 
while speking to the People's Po-
litical Consultative Conference, 
when he estimated the population 
of liberated China as 487,690,000. 
The Communist Shih-Chieh nien-
Chien, published in January 1952, 
placed the total at 483,879,687, In 
August of the same year the 
Revised Third Edition of Jen-min 
shou-ts'u (The People's Hand-
book) gave the figure of 
486,571,237. In Hsin Chung-kuo 
ti-li (The Geography of New 
China) published in 1953, the 
figure for China's population :s 
given as 478,800,0001, 
In April 1953, in order to re-
gister voters for the general 
election and at the same time 
secure vital data .for China's 
national economic reconstruction, 
the Government Administrative 
Council directed that a national 
survey of population be made. The 
survey was completed in May 
1954, and in November of the 
same year a communique on the 
national population survey and 
census was published by the 
State Statistical Bureau. This 
1953 census is noted for its-
distinction of being the first ever 
census in China whose results can... 
be regarded as accurate. The past 
efforts were unsatisfactory not 
only because the methods adopted 
were unscientific and faulty but 
more so because of the resistance 
of -the people who knew that 
registration meant only one thing : 
that the ruling class will be bet-
ter able to tax, conscript and 
otherwise exproit the people. The 
Chinese people resorted to every 
kind of concealment to cover up 
the existence of military-age men, 
able-bodied breadwinners, or 
numbers of heads on which they 
might be taxed. 
The 1953 census differs from all 
others also because it was carried 
out by a government which has. 
theconfidence of the people. The 
purpose was made clear to the 
nation by a nation-wide campaign. 
of information and propaganda. 
The method of taking the census. 
was worked out on the basis of 
Chinese conditions and the 
experience of the Soviet Union. It 
was made free from all unneces-
sary technical complications. The 
only questions asked were name, 
sex, age and nationality. To secure-
accuracy the standard-time for 
census taking was fixed at mid-
night on June 30, 1953. The work

was directed by the State Statist-
ical Bureau, which set up 
-branches at county and provincial 
levels all over the country. 
Census-taking became a job of the 
-ve.ople themselves. Besides the 
-government officials, popular or-
.-ganisations, school teachers, 
Itudents and others participated. 
According to a Western estimate, 
2.5 million people worked to col-
lect the census figures 1. After the 
preliminary national survey was 
completed a sample check was 
made in 343 countries in 23 pro-
vinces, 5 municipalities and one 
autonomous region, covering al-
together 9 per cent of the total 
,population - 52,953,400 people. It 
was found that duplication 
amounted to 1.39 per thousand 
and omissions to 2.55 per 
thousand. The tabulation of 
figures at the national level com-
menced in May 1954 and the 
total was finally announced on 
November 1 the same year 2. 
Results of the 1953 Census 
The communique issued by the 
State Statistical Bureau says : 
a The vast majority of areas in 
the country conducted a direct 
census  but the census was 
conducted in other ways in a few 
areas where direct census was not 
possible, such as remote places 
where basic-level elections did not 
take place and where communic-
ation facilities were poor, and 
Taiwan which remains to be 
liberated ; and in respect of Over-
seas Chinese and students 
studying abroad. 3 The results 
of the census are given below: 
There were 601,938,035 Chinese-
people in the world at midnight 
of June 30, 1953. Of this total, 
574,205,940 were counted direct-
ly by census-takers. The balance. 
27,732,095, is an estimate based on 
indirect methods. It includes 
7,591,298 people on Taiwan 
(from Kuomintang figures of 
1951), 11,743,320 Chinese resid-
ing or studying abroad, and 
8,397,477 persons in remote border 
regions.

Of the population direct-
ly surveyed and registreted, 
29,7,533,518 were men con-
stituting 51.82 per cent, and 
276,652,422 were women constit-
uting 48.81 per cent. Thus 
there were about 20 million more 
males than .females, which 
certainly is not a very high pro-
portion in nearly 602 millions. As 
many as 338,339,892 persons 
were aged 18 years and over, 
constituting 58.92 per cent. 
Among the latter 1,851,312 per-
sons were aged 80 to 90 years, 
3,384 persons aged 100 years and 
over, the highest age being 155 
years. Of those below 18 years 
of age, 15.6 per cent were under 
four years, 11 per cent between 
5 and 9 years, and 14.48 per cent 
between 10 to 18 years. 
Minority Nationals 
Excluding Taiwan and Overseas 
Chinese, the total population ac-
cording to national composition 
was as follows : 547,283,057 or 
93.94 per cent were Han Chinese 
and 35,320,360 persons or 6.06 
per cent were minority nationals. 
Among the minority nationals. 
each with more than 1,000,00O

.-Pattern of Population Distribution 
The following comments on the 
-pattern of population distribution 
-in China as revealed by the above 
table would be found interesting : 
? The unequal distribution of po-
pulation is striking. Szechuan, on 
the borders of Tibet, which is 
?considerably bigger than France, 
-contain 62 million people. Chin-
-ghai, to the north of Szechuan 
-and twice its size, has only 
1,670,000. Kiangsu, in which 
_Shanghai is situated, at mouth of 
the Yangtze, though 10,000 
_square miles smaller than. 
England, has 41,252,192 people 
-and density of population of 804 
to the square mile, against only 7 
.to the square mile in Mongolia 1. ? 
The State Statistical Bureau 
-.gave the following breakup of 
-.China's population between urban 
and rural areas : Urban 
77,257,282 persons constituting 
13.26 per cent, and rural 
505,346,135 persons constituting 
86.74 per cent. This vast agri-
-cultural population continues to 
concentrate today, as they have 
been since centuries, in the val-
leys of the Yellow River, Yangtze 
-and the Pearl River and also the 
-Chengtu (Szechuan) Plains. 
-Theodore Shabad says that about 
75 per cent of China's population 
lives in 15 per cent of the nation's 
territory and that the greatest 
density is found in the lower and 
middle reaches of the Yangtze, 
where a density of 2,000 to 2,500 
persons to the square mile is not 
uncommon, although the overall 
average in the lowlands is more 
nearly 1,000 to 1,200. Similar 
densities occur in the Canton 
delta and in the coastal plains of 
1> for 
such zones in wartime; at other 
times an approximation of six 
miles (then the range of naval 
guns) was considered adequate. 
This question again came before 
the Hague Codification Confer-
ence in 1930 and in April 1958 
it was debated at the Geneva 
Conference on the Law of the Sea. 
These deliberations produced no 
agreement and subsequently no 
uniform internationally recognised 
limit has been evolved for ter-
ritorial waters. Meanwhile differ-
ent states have asserted differing 
standards which they have en-
forced according to their power. 
The proceedings at Paris in 
1894 above referred to as well as 
those at the Hague in 1930 and 
at Geneva in 1958 vitiate the 
assertion, stridently emanating 
from leading naval and colonial 
powers, that the 18th century 
3-mile limit of territorial waters is 
? 
OCr. ? DEC. 1958 
73' 
still the accepted rule of interna-
tional law and that no nation 
has the right to fix a larger limit 
round its shores. In any event, 
the three mile limit has never been 
generally accepted by Asian 
states. 
The width of the territorial 
waters zone has recently assumed 
particular importance in three 
parts of the world: 
First, off the coast of Iceland 
where British fishing claims are 
being resisted by the Icelandic 
authorities; secondly, off the 
China Coast where a military 
conflict is raging; and thirdly, in 
the Indian maritime region of 
North Gujarat, where oil-fields 
have been found. 
1. Dispute between Iceland and Britain. 
The fisheries dispute between 
Iceland and Britain has followed 
Iceland's proclamation of a twelve 
mile zone of territorial waters. 
Following this proclamation Ice-
land has prohibited foreign fishing 
boats from her waters. Britain has 
claimed that Iceland had no right 
to do this, and, taking- the law 
into her own hands, has sent war-
ships to escort British trawlers 
fishing within twelve miles of the 
Iceland Coast. Great indignation 
has been aroused by this in Ice-
land, particularly because the 
British trawlers menace the 
livelihood of the Icelandic fisher-
men. Such indignation reached 
boiling point when British naval 
units forcibly captured eleven 
of Iceland's coast-guard service-
men who, in execution of Icelandic 
law, had boarded and arrested a 
British trawler illegally fishing in 
Iceland's territorial waters. A 
naval guerilla war is at present in 
progress off the Iceland coast. 
As a British journal writes: 
a Britain cannot afford inde-
finitely to fish in convoy under 
naval protection,... and the Ice-
landers can afford to go on polic-
ing the 12 mile limit for as long 
as it suits them  Of course 
the 3-mile limit is desirable for 
Britain.... When the British 
navy ruled the high seas, ma-
ritime law tended to establish it-
self in the interests of the chief. 
maritime power.... That situat-
ion no longer exists.... The 
Soviet Union has already long 
ago declared a 12 mile limit ? 
which obviously we are powerless 
to challenge. The root of the 
trouble is. ... the over fishing 
by British trawler companies of 
waters on which the Icelanders 
depend for their basis of live-
hood ?. (New Statesman and 
Nation. London, 6th September 
1958) 
2. Military action off the China coast. 
The People's Republic of China 
has also declared a maritime belt 
or zone of territorial waters 
extending twelve miles from her 
shores. For China this is a matter 
of national self-preservation. The

:islands of Quemoy and Matsu oc-
-cupied by Chiang Kai-shek troops 
lie within five miles of the Chinese 
.mainland. As Prime Minister 
-Nehru said in this connection at 
. a Press Conference on 7th 
September 1957, > in order to 
justify American penetration of 
the Middle East. Thirdly, with 
the loss of strategic and military 
bases in South and South-East 
Asia, Britain now feels that she 
should maintain a permanent-
foothold in the Middle East itself-
to ensure continued exploitation 
of the oil resources of the region. 
DOOM OF IMPERIALISM 
The end of World War II 
marked the beginning of the - 
eclipse of imperialist and colonial 
Powers. The post-war emergence 
of independent Afro - Asian 
nations makes the return of - 
colonialism to territories vacated 
by them, now or in the future, an 
impossibility. The tremendous 
accession of strength to the 
democratic and Socialist mo-
vements in the world further 
guarantees the impending doom of 
imperialism a n d colonialism. 
What is happening in the Middle 
East today is the manifestation of 
the death struggle of imperial-
ism, yet unwilling to die a natural 
death. The isolation of imperial-
ist forces is becoming more 
and more clear. And hence 
the new experiment in Anglo-
American partnership in the-
current imperialist adventure in 
the Middle East. 
IMPERIALIST TACTICS 
When imperialists are forced 
to withdraw from a country, *they 
see to it that some combustible 
material is left behind to keep 
the fire smouldering and to ensure 
an explosion at a suitable time. 
They left the Indian Sub-
continent in 1947. But the seeds 
of discord in the form of the-

;Kashmir and the canal water 
',problems which they had deliber-
zately created and left behind 
..:still continue to plague the 
:relations between Pakistan and 
:India. Then, alternately sup-
porting one country against 
-another at international forums 
the Western Powers help to 
maintain the disunity and hostility 
between them. The resultant 
-arms race between the two 
countries is ruining their 
economies and distorting their 
- domestic and international po-
licies. In the same way in 
the Arab Middle East the 
imperialists created the Zionist 
State of Israel in order to serve 
as a constant threat to the 
security of Arab countries and to 
maintain political tension and 
mutual suspicion. By alternately 
supporting one against the other 
and tipping the balance of power 
between the Arabs and the 
Zionists by giving or withholding 
arms, and all the time using 
Israel as a stool pigeon they try 
to keep the Arab countries in 
- subservience. The Dutch colon-
ialists withdrew from Indonesia 
but retained Western New 
Guinea to maintain their foothold 
in the area. 
When forced out of one 
country, colonialists do not pack 
- up and go home straight. They 
make a retreat and then perch 
- somewhere biding their time. 
British troops were forced to 
--withdraw from Egypt; they.moved 
into Cyprus and Kenya. When 
turned out of Jordan they went 
to Aden. When Ceylon closed 
the British air and naval bases in 
the island, British immediately 
announced their decision to build 
a new one in Maldive Islands. 
MILITARY PACTS 
Not content with all this, the 
Western imperialists in order to 
entangle the Asian nations in 
their cold war and to enable them 
to maintain and strengthen their 
political and economic strangle-
hold in West and South-East 
Asia, created two military al-
liances, the Baghdad Pact 
and the SEATO. They re-
presented the purpose of these 
pacts as defence against the 
threat of Soviet aggression, which 
as everybody knows has never 
existed in this region. Under the 
pretext of providing defence 
against a non-existent Soviet 
threat, the imperialists succeeded 
in re-establishing their military 
hold on these countries and in 
extending the evil effects of cold 
war. 
The truth about the Baghdad 
Pact is that it was intended to be 
a shield for imperialist oil 
interests of the Middle East 
against the rising tide of Arab 
Nationalism which was bound to 
assert sooner or later the national 
rights of the Arab peoples who 
are the real owners of the natural 
wealth of the countries. It was 
also intended to create dissensions

AFRO-ASIAN QUARTERLY 
among the Arab countries and 
to prevent Arab nationalism 
from achieving unity and solid-
arity. In short its fundamental 
aim was to fight Arab 
Nationalism which found its 
greatest champion in the Republic 
of Egypt. The fact that this 
organization was set up shortly 
after the successful carrying out 
of the Egyptian Revolution goes 
to show that its target was Arab 
Nationalism. 
This fact was conclusively 
proved at the time of the Anglo-
French invasion of Egypt when 
the Muslim members of the 
Pact refused to condemn the 
aggression although all the other 
Afro-Asian countries and an 
overwhelming section of world 
opinion were unanimous in doing 
so. It has now been further 
confirmed ? if confirmation was 
at all necessary ? by the view 
publicly aired by the three 
surviving Muslim members of the 
pact about the latest Anglo-
American intervention in Lebanon 
and Jordan and the imperialist 
threat to the new Republic of 
Iraq which dared to defy them. 
They not only did not condemn 
the aggressive military action by 
the Western Powers, but on the 
other hand they disgracefully ap-
proved and applauded it. The 
Baghdad Pact, after two suc-
cessive attempts at military ag-
-gression by its imperialist patrons, 
today stands completely stripped 
-of all its pretensions. 
REAL AIM OF MILITARY PACTS 
The present shift of emphasis 
from the so-called defence 
against Communist aggression to 
what is now called ? counter-
subversion ? and defence against 
? indirect aggression ? further 
unmasks the aim, of this 
organization. Any popular de-
mocratic opposition to anti-
national and reactionary policies 
of autocratic Governments kept 
in power by imperialist protection 
would .be dubbed as ? sub-
version x, and the provisions 
of the Pact could be invoked to 
suppress all legitimate democratic 
movements in the country. This 
new orientation given to the 
Baghdad Pact is to enable it to 
deal with all constitutional and 
democratic opposition in a 
country and thus make it safe for 
imperialist exploitation. 
It is very doubtful that those 
Governments who have twice in 
the short period of two years 
embarked on acts of militaiy 
aggression in the Middle East are 
supported by their people in 
their aggressive ventures. It is 
a well-known fact that an over-
whelming majority of the British 
people led by the British Labour 
Movement had strongly opposed 
the Anglo-French aggression in 
Egypt in 1956 and their massive 
opposition not only strengthened 
international action to halt ag-
gression, but it also brought 
down the Government headed by 
Sir Anthony Eden. Similarly even 
1? 
OCT. ? DEC. 1958 
99 
today there is powerful popular 
opposition in Britain to the 
military intervention in the 
Middle East by the present 
Government. The fact that they 
have not dared to carry out the 
intended aggressive plan against 
Iraq is partly due to the strength 
of public opinion in Britain and 
the whole world. 
Again, I do not for one moment 
think that the Government of the 
countries - particularly of Muslim 
countries which have joined the 
military pacts are supported 
in such action by their own 
common people. As far as I 
know, the common people in these 
countries have never had a say in 
the matter. In most cases, ? and 
in the case of -Muslim countries 
in particular ? the Governments 
have acted in disregard or in 
defiance of popular opinion. This 
fact which was never in doubt 
in Iraq has now been proved 
beyond a shadow of doubt by the 
recent revolutionary developments 
in that country. 
PEOPLE DO NOT WANT WAR 
The common people all the 
world over do not want war. I 
have had the opportunity to mix 
with the ordinary people in many 
countries. I have not met even 
a single person anywhere who 
wanted another world war. 
People of my generation _ I am 
73 now ? who have lived 
through two wOrld wars know 
what war means in terms of death, 
destruction and misery. In 
our part of the world we have 
even in peace time more than our 
share of misery, in the form 
of poverty, famine, starvation, 
disease and epidemics, which 
take their annual toll. We do 
not want a war which will 
multiply our misery and sufferings 
a thousand fold. Nobody wants 
war. Those people who have 
built up a higher standard of 
living do not want war because 
it would be the end of their higher 
standard of living. Others like 
the people of Asia who are still 
struggling to emerge from their 
backward economy, impoverished 
by long periods of colonial 
domination, and who are trying 
to raise their living standards by 
hard work and industrial develop-
ment, oppose war because it 
would be the end of their dream 
about a better future. They 
realize that it is the common 
people, the toiling millions, who 
suffer most in any war and who 
ultimately pay for the reconstruct-
ion and restoration by their 
sweated labour and sacrifices. 
War is, therefore, the greatest 
enemy of the working class 
people. Military pacts lead to cold 
war, and cold war is only one 
step short of actual war and may 
at any moment lead to it. That 
is why the common people every-
where are opposed to cold war 
manilditary

the Asian peoples better than 
that all scientific knowledge and 
achievements should have as their 
end and aim the enlargement of 
human happiness and the peace-
ful progress of all mankind. But 
unfortunately this is not true 
today. Gripped by demoralising 
fear or actuated by imperialist 
ambition for world domination, 
the leading countries of the world 
are today devoting their national 
resources and scientific ingenuity 
to the invention and manufacture 
of more and ever more dreadful 
engines of mass destruction. 
Imagination shudders at the 
infinite capacity achieved by 
world Powers for mutual destruct-
ion and human annihilation. 
The spectacle of leaders of 
nations clutching with their bands 
the frightful Hydrogen bombs 
capable of wiping out a million 
human beings in a split second, 
speaking of God and spiritual 
values, is a disgusting pheno-
menon: It is sanctimonious 
hypocricy for religious leaders to 
pronounce benedictions on the 
H-bomb, saying that it is morally 
no less justifiable than the 
primitve man's bow and arrow. 
The first and foremost duty of 
every man who regards peace as 
essential for human progress, and 
who believe that the destiny of 
mankind is greater than the 
destiny of any nation is to fight 
the current nuclear madness. 
I have, in my limited sphere 
and in my own humble way, 
been working for peace and 
understanding between peoples. 
Addressing the recent Stockholm 
conference of the ? Congress for 
Disarmament and International 
Co-operation ; as tffe leader of 
the Pakistan Delegation, I said: 
? In spite of the repeated 
and grim warnings of the 
leading scientists of the world, 
in spite of the cry of anguished 
humanity, nuclear weapons of a 
more and more frightful kind 
continue to be piled up. 
c Any hasty or rash decision may 
cause great disaster to humanity. 
It is sad commentary on the 
collective political wisdom of our 
day that in the name of combiting 
certain ideologies, policies are 
being pursued which may lead to 
the very annihilation of mankind, 
with nobody left to oppose or 
foster any ideology. The pri-
mitive man was in a sense 
the prisoner of his ignorance, 
while today the modern man has 
become the captive of his great 
technological achievements. 
? The threat of war arises from 
the determination of certain 
Powers to interfere in the internal 
affairs of other nations and to 
dominate the world. We 
have seen how, even after the 
horrifying experiences of World 
War H, imperialist Powers have 
engineered wars in Korea, Viet-
nam, Suez, Algeria, Lebanon and 
Iraq. We have also seen how 
the war-like policy of the

imperialist Powers has actually 
created the arms race and the 
consequent world tension. These 
Powers are interested in the 
increase in armaments : for firstly, 
militarism helps them to extend 
their rule over the colonial peoples 
and counters movements of 
national liberation; and secondly, 
the production of armaments is a 
profitable business. They sustain 
their economy through more and 
more expenditure on armaments. 
In order to mint money they are 
playing with human lives. Their 
morality is no higher than that of 
the buccaneers of days gone by. 
? But the arms race is against 
the interests of the peoples of the 
world. It is also against the 
interest of the peoples of the 
imperialist Powers. All the world 
over people want peace. Even 
the peoples of the imperialist 
Powers want peace. That is why 
in this conference there are 
people present from the four 
corners of the world ?. 
We Afro-Asian nations have 
many things in common. We 
have common interests and corn-
mon aims. Some of the Afro-
Asian countries have yet to 
secure their political independence 
from colonial Powers. Most of 
us have yet to achieve our 
economic freedom. And certainly 
all of us have much economic 
leeway to make up and have to 
raise the living standards of our 
peoples. A Herculean task 
awaits all our countries in the 
field of agricultural and industrial 
development. For all this we 
need continued peace. We also 
need complete freedom from 
interference from outside in our 
internal affairs. We want to 
develop friendly relations with one 
another and with all other 
countries with all nations on the 
basis of equality and mutual 
benefit. In short, we want peace-
ful co-existence in a world of dif-
fering ideologies and ways of 
life. The people of Pakistan, like 
the peoples of other Afro-Asian 
countries, stand by the five 
principles enunciated at the 
Bandung Conference as the basis 
of this peaceful co-existence. 
These principles alone can provide 
a stable foundation for world 
peace. They alone can maintain 
Afro-Asian solidarity. It is es-
sential to preserve this Afro-
Asian solidarity if peace is fo 
survive in a world torn 
by ideological conflicts and 
threatened by nuclear madness. 
SOCIAL REVOLUTION 
We in our country are con-
vinced that our social, political 
and economic problems cannot be 
solved without sweeping aside the 
evil legacies of colonial rule and 
the relics of a medieval feudal 
society. Economic progress is 
impossible without liquidating 
the last vestiges of feudalism, and 
social ju-stice cannot be achieved 
without ending all forms of 
exploitation and ensuiing equality

of opportunity to all. The 
influence of the corrupt ruling 
class must be eliminated if the 
will of the people is to prevail. 
The first condition for the ordered 
progress of the society is 
therefore real democracy in which 
the rule of law shall prevail and 
civil liberties shall be guaranteed, 
and tyranny and exploitation 
shall never lift their heads. It is 
characteristic of colonialism that 
wherever its influence exists, 
democracy gets no chance. The 
greater the colonialist domination 
over a country, the greater is the 
tyranny and denial of civil 
liberty there. In the name of 
fighting Communism, the ruling 
classes of these imperialist-
dominated countries suppress all 
democratic and progressive mo-
vements. Western imperialists 
have so much identified them-
selves with anti-democratic and 
anti-national policies in the 
countries they dominate that the 
people of these countries are 
convinced that their fight is first 
and foremost against colonialism 
and imperialism. No wonder 
when popular democratic move-
ments try to overthrow the 
tyrants and the corrupt stooges 
of imperialism, the imperialists try 
to intervene on their side. It is 
our own affair how we treat our 
corrupt ruling classes: whether 
we forgive them, or whether we 
punish them. It is none of the 
business of the imperialists to 
intervene between us, or to tell us 
.how we should deal with them. 
We are living in a world which 
is today full of conflicts and 
turmoils. If we have to achieve 
our aim of peace and progress 
we have to tread our path with 
steadfast faith in our ideals And 
complete unity in our ranks. Our 
faith should include faith in the 
democratic ideals and legitimate 
national aspirations of all peoples. 
.Our unity should cover the unity 
of all peoples who have the same 
ideals and aspirations:

The Paper Tigers 
In their annual gathering sometime ago 
the Conservative hags of Britain decreed : 
Whatever may happen, they will never permit 
Hongkong, Singapore, Aden, Kenya, Malta 
and Gibraltar to be free. 
Years ago they talked the same way about 
Suez, but they were literally kicked out. And 
yet more years ago they talked. identically 
about India, but they had to quit India. 
Then there is more recent history. When 
the U.S aggressors, hand-in-glove with 
Britain, landed troops in Lebanon and Jordan, 
their aggressive plans were not confined to 
just these countries but had wider objectives 
against the new-born Iraqi Republic, the 
United Arab Republic, in fact against the 
entire Arab peoples of the Middle East. 
Three and a half months later, however, 
the imperialists had to eat the humble pie, and 
the U.S and British troops had to withdraw. 
This clearing out of the imperialist troops was 
major victory of the Arab peoples and of 
the world in their fight against colonialism. 
Nevertheless, the imperialists do not seem 
to have learnt any lessons. Modern editions 
as they are of the French Bourbons, they 
obviously learn nothing and forget nothing. 
Canute-like, they order the resurgent huma-
nity of Africa and Asia to stop their march 
forward, but, like the waves of the sea, the 
Afro-Asian peoples surge forward and the 
Canutes- are bewildered. 
In their bewilderment they take resort to 
yet more desperate and despicable methods, 
the most dangerous of which is the sowing of 
seeds of discord among the Afro-Asian

peoples Sometimes a Bourgiba is popped up 
to play the role of the late unlamented Nuri 
Said with regard to Arab nationalism. And 
then a refrain is taken up about discord 
between African and Arab nationalisms. 
More than all this, however, is the in-
creasing recourse to unrestrained violence 
against unarmed peoples. This violence never-
theless proves that, while these dark forces of 
imperialism have still some strength left, this 
momentary rampancy is in reality the last 
kicks of their deathbed struggle. 
As for the Afro-Asian peoples, they have 
learnt their lessons the hard way, and as such 
the lessons are well-learnt. And these great 
lessons are : first, struggle, fail, struggle 
again, fail again, struggle again till victory 
is achieved , second, march arm in arm, 
march unitedly, and guard this unity of the 
fighting forces as the apple of the eye. 
From their hard experience the Afro-
Asian peoples know that the ferocious-looking 
imperialists are like paper tigers who can 
subdue and suppress the masses only till such 
time as they remain awed by it ; that once 
the people take their destiny in their hands, 
these paper tigers are revealed in their utter 
hollowness and instability. 
Indeed, the days when the imperialists 
could ride roughshod are gone for ever, and 
the paper tigers are on their last legs. All 
attempts to stamp out the freedom battles 
through mass murders results in further 
strengthening of the forces of freedom. Im-
perialism is like the setting sun in the western 
-sky. The resurgent Afro-Asian peoples are 
like the rising sun in the eastern sky.

AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
IMPERIALISTS: QUIT AFRICA 
Manifesto Of 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity 
for observance of December 1, 1958, as 
QUIT AFRICA DAY. 
With every day which passes the world 
beholds the spectacle of terrified and panicky 
imperialists resorting to the most shameless 
and naked practices to maintain their tottering 
empires. If on one day it is the brutal act of 
filing upon and killing unarmed men in Aden, 
on another, thousands of African women are 
imprisoned'in South Africa, and on yet another 
occasion it is a mean attempt to break mono-
lithic Arab solidarity. 
Nevertheless, despite all imperialist terror 
and trickery, the freedom movement of the 
awakened Afro-Asian peoples irresistibly mar-
ches forward. Frightened at this spectacle. 
imperialists shoot and the blood of the 
.A fricans and the Asians flows together in the 
course ?of their joint struggles against the 
common foe. Unaware of what they do, the 
imperialists thus create unbreakable bonds of 
solidarity between the Afro-Asian peoples 
against the Western looters and oppressors 
The millions of Arabs on the African and 
Asian mainlands, rising as one man, have dealt 
deadly blows on the tottering fort of imper-
ialism,- and have aroused a great struggle for 
freedom over the entire African continent 
The fact that Asian blood flows in Aden by 
British bullets, and African blood flows in 
Algeria and the Kameruns through French 
guns at the same time has convinced the entire 
Afro-Asian humanity that solidarity against 
the common enemy is their most cherished 
possession. 
The great resurgence over Africa, inspired 
by freedom battles of Asian and the Arab 
peoples, symbolises the emergence into 
consciousness of vast masses of humanity, 
whom the imperialists have thus far crushed 
in a most systematic manner. For, as history 
unfolds, and as the world comes to know how 
the European imperialists ? the British, the 
French, the Portugese, the Belgians ? have 
dominated, suppressed and exploited the 
African peoples, it is revealed that their 
methods here have been more savage, 
thorough and heartless than perhaps else-
where 
The Africans have been treated by the 
imperialists as sheep and cattle, as flora and 
fauna, as things to be cut and eaten, or 
crushed underfoot and trod upon. The great 
African masses, anthropologically among the 
oldest of the human race, possessed of an old 
and vivid culture and art forms, and a very 
virile and intelligent people, were denied by 
the imperialists ex en the status of fellow 
humans, and slandered all over the world 
And now that these Africans have begun 
to get up, the imperialists are resorting to 
such deceit and trickery as the so-called De 
Gaulle "Referendum", or the British mani-
pulated elections in Uganda to ward off then 
inevitable doom. At the same time they resort 
to the worst possible repression and terror. 
The imperialists brazenly say that they 
are in Africa on a "civilising mission", that 
the Africans are unfit to rule themselves, that 
they are leading them to "self-rule", for if 
they leave Africa, it will go into chaos and 
anarchy and the African peoples will destroy 
each other. 
Thus it is that the dying imperialists 
mock at the African peoples. The African 
peoples, however, know to their cost that 
this "civilising mission" is disgraceful, is a 
myth and hypocricy. The reality is its 
barbaric nature. 
Indeed, the African peoples are convinced 
that chaos and anarchy would be preferable 
to imperialist slavery. Through the daily 
intensification of their freeaom battles they 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
demand that the imperialists should forth-
with Quit Africa. 
The widespread and deeprooted Quit 
Africa Movement, given a great fillip by the 
Bandung, Cairo and Accra Conferences, has 
now become the most outstanding feature of 
the vast African continent. 
The African peoples march forward to 
regain their rightful place in the world com-
munity of free and peaceful peoples and their 
unanimous demand to the imperialists is : 
Quit Africa. 
With a view to further consolidate and 
strengthen this gigantic Quit Africa move-
ment, the Permanent Secretariat calls upon 
Afro-Asian humanity to observe December 1, 
1958. as Quit Africa Day. 
On this day let African peoples every-
where gather in their millions to demand of 
the imperialists : Quit Africa. 
On this day, let the vast Asian humanity 
rally in their millions to express their soli-
darity with the Quit Africa struggle of their 
African brethern. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-.Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity calls upon all National 
Committees to prepare from now to make the 
Quit Africa Day an expression of the united 
will of all freedom-loving peoples. Marches, 
public rallies and demonstrations should be 
ganised on an elaborate scale. 
The Permanent Secretariat is confident 
that Quit Africa Day on December One will 
serve the final notice to the imperialists to get 
Out at once.

IMPERIALISTS: QUIT AFRICA. 
Cairo, 15.11.1958. 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE GREATEST RALLY 
OF AFRO-ASIAN YOUTH 
It w as decided at the Afro-Asian Peoples' 
Solidarity Conference at Cairo that the Per-
manent Secretariat, in conjunction with -the 
Supreme Council of Youth's Welfare in the 
U.A.R., should hold at Cairo a Special Con-
ference for the Youth of Afro-Asian countries. 
A combined committee of the two bodies 
was then established and sent its first bulletin 
to all Afro-Asian countries. The main aim 
of this Conference is to strengthen Afro-
Asian Solidarity, develop mutual understand-
ing and friendship among Youth, to study their 
problems, to take adequate steps for the exe-
cution of the resolutions of the Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity Conference, and establish 
the Afro-Asian Youth Congress. 
Later the U A.R. Preparatory Committee 
for the Afro-Asian Youth Conference was 
formed and it is now energetically preparing 
for the great rally of Afro-Asian Youth. 
The U.A.R.P.C. has issued a second 
bulletin and an application form for the Afro-
Asian Youth Conference Membership and has 
sent it to Youth Organizations and Afro-Asian 
National Solidarity Committees in all Afro-
Asian countries. They were requested to form 
a Preparatory Committee for the Youth Con-

ferencc in their country. They were also 
requested to convey their opinion regarding 
our suggestions and our mutual aim and to 
explain the idea of the Conference to the Youth 
of their countries and to fill the application 
form. 
The U.A.R.P.C. has received many warm 
and encouraging answers. from various Afro-
Asian Organizations to the first and second 
bulletins. These answers are unanimous about 
the necessity of uniting. all efforts to achieN 
the aims set down, since it constitutes a vital 
corneri-stone in the fnission of Afro-Asian 
countries for the attainment of liberation. so-
vereignty and prosperity. 
The U.A.R.P.C. has now sent out its third 
bulletin and invitations for the meeting of the 
International Preparatory Committee which 
will be held at Cairo on November 24-26, 1958 
(one member from every country), along with 
a provisional agenda. 
Publicity to popularize the Youth Confe-
rence has begun on a large scale in the U.A.R. 
All students' activities is being directed to 
serve the aims of and bring success to the 
great rally of Afro-Asian Youth.

DESPITE IMPERIALIST BLACKMAIL AND CONSPIRACIES 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
AFRO-ASIAN PEOPLES MARCH FORWARD 
( As the peoples of Africa and Asia march irresistibly forward to 
wrest their freedom from the unwilling hands of the colonialists, the 
panic-striken imperialists take resort to the most naked use of force, 
blackmail, intrigues and conspiracies in a vain attempt to stop the 
course of history. As the coordinator of these freedom struggles, and 
having been created by them, the Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples Solidarity receives reports from the far-flung territories of the 
vast Afro-Asian world. The Permanent Secretariat is called upon to 
express itself on the issues which come up from day to day, with, a 
view to create a correct public perspective on the questions and also 
to advise the various National Solidarity Committees about the line of 
action to be adopted so that the entire Afro-Asian world may be mobi-
lised to support the rightful cause of freedom. Below we compile together 
statements issued by the Permanent Secretariat from August of this 
year up-to-date. - Editor) 
ON FURTHER LANDINGS OF 
U:S. TROOPS IN LEBANON 
The Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Secre-
tariat notes with sorrow and consternation 
that Americari imperialists are continuing to 
land troops and tanks in Lebanon. Even 
though each such aggressive act earns for 
the American Imperialists the lasting hatred 
of the Arab Peoples, they nevertheless blindly 
1,ersist iri their foolish acts. Blindness, indeed, 
could not have gone farther. 
Viewed in the background of British 
landings 'in Jordan, this further pouring in of 
American arms and men in Lebanon can only 
be regarded as preparing the ground for fur-
ther aggressions against the Arab Peoples. All 
Anglo-American professions of peace stand 
cxposed as sheer hypocricy. 
Event S in Arab world should prove to 
the Western imperialists that the liberation 
struggle of the Arab Peoples is an irresistible 
trend. The old days of colonialism and exploi-
tation are gone for ever and any attempt to 
bring back the old state of affairs in contra-
vention to the trend of history will endanger 
peace and is doomed to failure. 
The Afro-Asian Solidarity Secretariat, 
representing the will of the Afro-Asian peoples, 
arns the Anglo-American imperialists to 
desist from such blind acts. The Secretariat 
at the same time reminds the vast masses of 
Asia and Africa that peace can be preserved 
and freedom guaranteed only when the people 
take up the cause in their hands. 
The landing of the Anglo-American forces 
in Jordan and Lebanon is calculated to suppress 
the freedom of the peoples of these countries, 
and aims at supporting a tottering and reac-
tionary coterie. It threatens peace in the area 
and is gross violation of the U.N. Charter. 
In view of the continuing_ threat of Anglo-
American aggression against the Arab peoples. 
and in the light of the forthcoming session of 
the U.N. General Assembly, the Afro-Asian 
Solidarity Secretariat calls upon all its Natio-
nal Committees to'organise mass rallies on the 
clay of the Assembly Session to demand the 
withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon 
and British. troops from Jordan. Such rallies 
should be organized in all important cities in 
which a resolution to the above effect shotrld 
be passed. After this, cables must be sent to 
President Eisenhower, Premier MacMillan and

ON INTENDED NUCLEAR BOMB TESTS 
IN AFRICAN DESERT 
Atomic and nuclear experimentations 
constitute a great menace to humanity. Each 
day millions upon millions of human beings 
raise their voice \ chcmcnt ly to world con-
science to put an end to these destructive lethal 
experiments. Some of the governments have 
spontaneously responded to our humanitarian 
orld appeal, while others insist upon carrying 
out their preconceived plans. France is actually 
attempting to take an active part in the staging 
of these atomic and nuclear experiments in the 
great African desert; and to use the peoples of 
Africa as guinea-pigs, 
The Permanent Secretariat opposes the 
staging of such experiments anywhere and at 
any time. 
We appeal to world public opinion, to the 
United Nations and to the Committee of 
Human Rights to pre x ent these experiments 
taking place, especially those scheduled to be 
carried out in Africa in the near future. 
We further declare that, for our part, we 
shall prevent the staging of these experiments 
by every possible means in our power. 
We call upon all governments and people, 
regardless of colour and nationality w ho have 
the interests of mankind at heart to support 
our appeal by signing this document.

ON BRITISH REPRESSIVE POLICY 
IN UGANDA 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-
Asian Peoples' Solidarity has learnt with cons-
ternation about the tirrest of Mr. Otema Alli-
madi, tlic Permanent Secretary of the Uganda 
National Congress and one of the Uganda dele-
gritcs to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference 
that was held in Cairo in December 1957. Mr. 
Allimadi was charged with importing- prohibit-
ed publications in Uganda. These publications, 
however, were nothing more than some scho-
larship forms arid pamphlets of thq 
Interna-
tonal Union of Students. After gruelling ques-
tioning Mr. Allimadi \'as released on a bond 
pending sentence. 
The Secretariat regards this action by the 
British authorities as an mfrigment of freedom 
01 the individual, and a continuation of their 
? policy to tyrannize all Uganda nationalists. 
Political persecution in Uganda is today a daily 
routine which takes different forms. 
These authorities arc also doing their best 
to stop nationalist leaders from leaving the 
country. We still remember how the Uganda 
delegates to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Confe-
rence were stopped on their way. "lhose w ho 
managed_ to come ? like Mr. Allimadi ?? ere 
persecuted 
The Secretariat condemns such action. 
not only as a violation of human rights, but 
Ls a systematic action to isolate Uganda from 
peace-loving peoples. In the light of this, the 
Permanent Secretariat ? 
1-- Strongly condemns any action by the 
British Authorities to prolong their 
outdated colonial rule. 
2? Calls upon the United Nations to 
send a visiting mission to Uganda to 
investigate the situation. 
3? Calls upon all Afro-Asian Peoples to 
demonstrate their solidarity w ith the 
people of Uganda, and to send 
protest to the United Nations against 
the unlawful persecution of nationa-
lists.

ON THE SITUATION 
IN TAIWAN STRAITS 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity notes with deep concern the 
obstinate insistence of the U.S. imperialism to 
continue with its ubridled provocation in 
China's Taiwan area. It also strongly 
condemns the landing of large numbers of U.S. 
aggressor troops in Taiwan and regards this 
action as an open threat by the U.S.A. to 
expand 'its aggression against the Peoples' 
Republic of China. In fact, the U.S.A. has 
already started to do this. According to the 
latest news, America warships have intruded

AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
into Chinese territorial waters. This step will 
lead to the aggravation of the tension in the 
Taiwan Straits area which will jeopardize 
peace in the Far East and the world. 
The Secretariat firmly believes that 
Taiwan and the Penghu islands are Chinese 
territory and that the Peoples' Republic of . 
China has every right to liberate them. It also 
believes that the United States support of 
Chiang Kai-Shck clique entrenched on Taiwan 
and the Penghu Islands and its direct occupa-
tion of these areas by armed forces constitute 
unlawful interference in China's internal 
affairs and a clear infringmcnt of China's ter-
ritorial sovereignty. They arc also in open 
conflict with the United Nations' Charter. 
The Secretariat has watched for sonic time 
how the Chiang Kai-Shek clique supported by 
the U.S. imperialists has been using the coastal 
islands such as Quemoy as advance bases to 
carry out all kinds of disruptive activities 
against the Chinese mainland. Consequently, 
the Peoples' Republic of China has every right 
to react to this aggression and to take neces-
sary military action aimed at the liberation of 
their territory against Chiang Kai-Shek troops. 
The Secretariat believes that the United States 
is. at the same time, trying to divert the world 
attention from the continued presence of their 
troops in the Lebanon. By so doing the United 
States has hastened to create a new danger 
of wai in the Taiwan Straits area, thus making 
all peace loving peoples realize the apparent 
United States imperialist policy to sabotage 
peace and suppress national independence in 
Asia and Africa. 
The Secretariat has read with indignation 
statements made by United States military and 
political leaders in which is expressed the 
opinion that the United States will use atomic 
weapOns in the Far East as a proof that limited 
wars, as they call them, can be waged by this 
inhuman weapon. The statements published in 
the Western press about this matter and the 
aggressive tone of these Western press and 
statements are a clear evidence of the United 
States vain and savage policy. 
- On behalf of the Afro-Asian Peoples we 
welcome the move by the Peoples' Republic 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
of China to enter into negotiations with the 
U.S.A. over this question. At the same time 
we hope that these negotiations will not be 
used by U.S. as a smokccreen to hide its 
further aggressive actions. 
We strongly demand that all U.S. troops 
be withdrawn immediately from Taiwan area, 
as a guarantee for peace in the Far East, 
indeed in the whole world. 
29-8-58 
ON IMPERIALIST CONSPIRACIES 
AGAINST THE ARAB AND 
THE AFRICAN WOLD 
Basing itself on reports which pour in the 
Office of Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity, the 
Permanent Secretariat is forced to arrive at 
the inescapable conclusion that as the great 
freedom movement of the Afro-Asian peoples 
marches forward ceaselessly from success to 
to success, the imperialist colonisers are getting 
more and more panicky and are resorting to 
the most despicable weapons in their armoury 
in a vain attempt to crush and defeat the irre-
sistible floodtide of the resurgent peoples of 
the two continents. 
These despicable weapons of the hated 
Western imperialists range from such mean 
acts as bribery and large-scale spying to most 
shameless attempts to divide the ranks of the 
freedom fighters, sow dissensions and thus ? 
seek to break the solidarity of the Afro-Asian 
peoples. 
It is not at all surprising that in the 
present treacherous strategy of the imperia-
lists, the main target of attack is Arab Natio-
nalism. The great upsurge of . the Arab 
peoples is driving the last nails in the coffin 
of imperialism and is acling as a most powerful 
factor in rousing the enslaved peoples of 
Africa. 13y and by the African countries arc 
becoming free, the latest to join the family 
being Guinea Till now almost 39% of the 
peoples of the African continent are liberated ; 
it is natural, therefore, that the imperialist 
colonialists are straining their every nerve and 
resorting to the most hateful and shameless 
methods to retain their hold over the remain-
ing 61% of the African peoples, who never-
theless are determined to attain their freedom. 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
And so it is not only for the Middle East 
oil, but also to save their tottering African 
empire that the colonialists have made Arab 
nationalism the main target of their disruptive 
conspiracies. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity is firmly of the opinion that 
the uncalled for, ungrateful and shocking 
attack of the Tunisian delegate on the United 
Arab Republic in the meeting of the Arab 
League Council is part of this same dirty game 
of the imperialists and represents an unholy 
alliance between certain sections in the Arab 
world and the hated imperialists of the \Vest. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity cannot but be concerned by 
these imperialist tactics, since Arab nationalism 
and solidarity are part and parcel, and a most 
powerful wing of Afro-Asian Solidarity. The 
Permanent Secretariat cannot also remain un-
concerned by overt or covert attacks on Pre-
sident Nasser, who, along with other great 
leaders of the Afro-Asian world of today, sym-
bolises the aspirations of millions upon millions 
of the Afro-Asian peoples. 
The ominous pronouncements in the impe-
rialist press and radio before the Arab League 
meeting, and the way in which the Tunisian 
epresentatives' out-burst has been boosted by 
the Voice of America and the British Broad-
casting Corporation leaves no doubt about 
Western complicity in this contemptible move 
to divide Arab Solidarity. To the Permanent 
Secretariat it is obvious that there is a clear 
relationship between all the conspiracies being 
hatched by imperilism against Arab Nationa-
lism and the freedom struggles of the African 
peoples. 
The Permanent Secretariat therefore 
condemns the attack of the Tunisian repre-
sentative on the U.A.R as uncalled for. 
It makes bold to appeal to the Tunisian 
leadership of the day to realise the utter 
futility and dangers of their erroneous way

Days

the company of this dying, moribund system. 
In conclusion, the Permanent Secretariat 
of Afro-Ascan Peoples Solidarity would like to 
alert all its National Committees, and all the 
peoples of Africa and Asia to be wary of the 
divide and rule strategy of the mad imperia-
lists. It calls upon its National Committees 
to explain widely the dangers of Western 
machinations to the peoples at large and place 
before them the correct perspective about Arab 
Nationalism and imperialist conspiracies.

ON FREEDOM BATTLE OF CYPRUS 
To the Permanent Secretariat of Afro-
Asian Peoples' Solidarity has come a cry for 
support from a small nation struggling for 
fi eedom with deathless determination against 
the most cunning and crafty imperialist the 
world has known, namely, the British. 
It is the island of Cyprus whose brave 
people have written many golden pages in the 
history of freedom battles of the world. Not 
so long ago the British imperialists calimed 
that they were in Cyprus on a "civilising 
mission", though the fact of the matter is that 
the people of the island were already highly 
civilised when people in Britain were in a pri-
mitive state. 
The utter shamelessness and shocking hy-
pocricy of the so-called civilising mission of 
the British is clear to all in the world and, 
indeed, beggars description. To their long and 
unpardonable list of crimes in Cyprus, the 
heartless colonialists of Britain have now 
added a diabolical plan to partition the island. 
The hated British imperialists have succeeded 
in partitioning some other areas of the world

and now they are out to cut in two the body 
of Cyprus, even ihough the Greeks and Turks 
have lived like brothers in Cyprus and have 
been always happily mixed economically and 
socially for hundreds of years. 
'During World War II, more than 30,000 
Cypriots joined British forces because of the 
promise then made to free the island and even 
allow union with Greece. As soon as the War 
was over, hypocrites and archliars as the 
British imperialists are, they went back on 
their word and struck upon the Partition Plan. 
The valiant struggle of the Cypriots has, how-
ever, forced them to beat a retreat, and under 
the latest British plan the minority of about 
20 per cent is in effect granted the power of 
veto over the 80 per cent majority. 
Very rightly the Cypriots have rejected 
this plan and have intensified their battle for 
freedom and asked for support of the Afro-
Asian peoples. The Afro-Asian peoples have 
in fact always regarded the Cypriots as be-
honging to their own fraternity and their re-
presentative was present at the Cairo Con-
ference in December last year. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Solidarity therefore unhesitatingly extends its 
fullest support to the brave people of Cyprus. 
It condemns the unheard 'of atrocities and 
reign of terror let loose on the tiny island by 
the British imperialists. It warns the British 
people that such actions of their rulers has 
already won for them the curse of millions 
upon millions of world humanity, and unless 
they rise up and prevent the diabolical, inhu-
man crimes of their imperialist masters, this 
curse of world humanity will prove very 
terrible for the entire British nation. Already 
descended from the zenith of power to its 
nadir, the British nation will face a fate which 
cannot even imagine. 
The Permanent Secretariat would like to 
Sept.-Oct. 195g 
say that the United Nations has been on trial 
on the Cyprus issue for some years now and 
it has been found wanting. If the U.N. fails 
even now to curb the British imperialists in 
Cyprus, it will invite upon itself the distrust of 
world humanity and will be exposed, like the 
earlier League of Nations, as an imperialist 
tool. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Solidarity calls upon all its National Com-
mittees : 
? TO CONDEMN BRITISH ATROCITIES 
IN CYPRUS, 
-- TO CONDEMN THF, BRITISH PLAN OF 
PARITION OF THE ISLAND, 
? TO CONDEMN THE LATEST BRITISH 
PLAN FOR CYPRUS, AND 
-- TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF CYPRUS 
FREEDOM THROUGH MASS RALLIES, 
THE PRESS AND THE PLATFORM.

SITUATION IN UGANDA 
Some days ago the Permanent Secre-
tariat of Afro-Asian Solidarity drew public 
attention to the deceit and trickery of the 
French imperialists in Somaliland. And now 
have conic reports of another fake and bogus

The real and diabolical aim of the British

Rally Behind The Freedom Fighters of Algeria 
Afro-Asian Permanent 
The Permanent Secretariat addressed the 
following letter to all National Solidarity 
Committees on De Gaulle's "referendum" in 
Algeria 
The march of the peoples of Africa to 
freedom is not easy. They have to pay for 
every step by great sacrifices. The imperialists 
have not given up the methods of armed re-
prisals against the peoples who rose against 
unbearable political and economic oppression. 
The huge French army equipped with American 
arms has been waging for four years a re-
lentless colonial war against the Algerian 
community and committing outrages in regions 
of Tunisia and Morocco. The imperialists are 
trying to suppress the liberation struggle of 
the peoples of Kenya and the Kameruns by 
brutal terror. 
At present no one can change the ine-
vitable process. More than 200 millions of 
Africans, who till recently had been in the 
position of slaves, are now turning into an 
active force in the progressive world. 
During the last years in particular the 
peoples of the French possessions have reso-
lutely demanded the liquidation of the colonial 
nature of their relations with France. As a 
resua of stubborn struggles, the peoples of 
Indo-China. Tunisia, and Morocco have 
achieved their national independence. The 
Algerian People arc courageously fighting for 
their legimitc rights to self-determination and 
f re edo in. 
The French authorities are trying in the 
near future, namely on the 28th September. to 
impose on the Algerian people a so-called refe-
rendum on the question of a new French 
Constitution with the purpose of misleading 
world public opinion and of annexing Algeria 
to France. 
But the Algerian people do not want to 
participate in this so-called referendum and 
are struggling against colonialists to liberate 
their country. They declare that Algeria is not 
a French territory. No one can pretend to 
ignore the colonial war which France is waging 
to support her policy in Algeria. Though this

Secretariat's Claron Call 
so-called referendum which is being imposed 
on the Algerian people is absolutely unlawful, 
the French authorities plan to carry it out 
under the protection of the French armed 
forces. h is well known that in Algeria at 
Present there are 800,000 French soldiers and 
policemen and two-thirds of the French Air 
Force and half of the French navy is station-
ed near the Algerian Coast. 
The Algerian people, in accordance with 
the principles of U N. charter, have full right 
to self-determination France has % iolated these 
principles, and the decisions adopted by the 
U.N. General Assembly and by the conferences 
of Bandung, Cairo and Accra on the Algerian 
problem. 
The attempt by France to annex Algeria 
is a direct threat to world peace and security. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity considers that the "refe-
rendum" which is being imposed on the people 
of Algeria and which will be conducted in an 
atmosphere of terror, repression and colonial 
war, and in the presence of huge numbers of 
French troops of occupation is illegal and 
constitutes a flagrant violation of the right 
of the Algerian people to self-determination. 
The Secretariat calls upon all National 
Committees of Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity 
to conduct in their countries without any loss 
of time a broad campaign of protests against 
the so-called referendum ? this new crime 
being perpetrated by the French imperialists 
in Algeria. 
Brethren, 
We sincerely.hope that you will give every 
moral and political support to the Algerian 
People in their gallant struggle to attain 
freedom and national independence.

This so called referendum, planned to be

SUPPORT THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF ALGERIA 
APPEAL BY THE PERM4NEN1 SECRETARIAT TO THE PEOPLES OF ASIA & AFRICA 
On Friday, September, 1958, when the 
Free Governmennt of Algeria was proclaimed 
in Cairo, the Permanent Secretariat issued the 
following statement : 
"On January first this year we met in 
Cairo to lay the foundations on which we can 
build the solidarity of peoples of Asia and 
Africa for peace, freedom and equality. We 
met. in great force to shake off the shackles 
of imperialism and to defend independence of 
those peoples Who were able to win thci; 
freedom from foreign domination and to regain 
the freedom of those who continued to suffer 
under its yoke. 
"From among those who thus assembled 
and who were bearing the yoke of imperialism 
and subjected to a war of genocide, we heard 
the voice of one which was so dear to us, 
revealing the barbarism of French Imperialism 
and its brutality. This was the voice of the 
great Algerian people who were struggling for 
their freedom and fighting for their very exis-
tence. , 
"The Peoples of Asia and Africa stood 
solidly behind the struggling people of Algeria, 
assisting them in their fight for freedom. The 
Cairo Conference regarded the Nvar forced on 
the Algerian peoples as a threat to the security 
of the African peoples and international peace. 
It also condemned the colonial war waged in 
Algeria and the atrocities committed by the 
French imperialist forces against the Algerian 
people who were fighting for their indepen-
dence, It , affirmed its support to the 
heroic struggle of the Algerian people and 
demanded the recognition of the indepen-
dence of Algeria. Further, it demanded that 
negotiation must be started immediately 
between the French Government and the Na-
tional Liberation Front which represents the 
Algerian people, the immediate release of the 
five leaders and all other Algerian nationalists 
ho were in jail and concentration camps. 
"To-day the struggling ? Algerian people 
have announced the establishment of the first 
Free Algerian Government. The people of Asia 
and Africa extend their full support and 
complete backing to this new Government. and 
declare that its establishment is an affirmation 
of the Cairo resolution w hich was passed un-
animously with a view to help the Algerian 
people to secure their independence. 
"It is time that the French- imperialists 
bow to the inevitable course of history and 
withdraw forthwith 800,000 strong occupation 
troops from Algeria. 
"The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-
Asian Peoples' Solidarity calls upon the peoples 
of Asia and Africa to take an active stand for 
the support of this free new government and 
demand from their respective governments 
the immediate recognition of this new regime 
which represents the real Algerian people. It 
calls upon them to use their influence in the 
international sphere to secure the recognition 
? 
of other countries for this legitimate gover-
ment of Algeria. 
"The establishment of this free govern-
ment is yet another success for the free 
peoples and a heavy blow against imperialism. 
The independence of this struggling people is 
an esential condition for security in Africa, 
'indeed in the whole world".

Israel-An Imperialist Conspiracy 
Against Arab Nationalism 
Kamal Bahaa El-Din 
(Controller-General, Afro-Asian Permanent Headquarters) 
rab Nationalism, needless to say, is and 
has been since time immemorial a foregone 
conclusion. The Arab Nation has its origin in 
the East and in the Arab West alike. Its sons 
have but one language, one history, one tra-
dition and a temperament common to all. They 
have been and shall always be one national 
entity. solidly united and closely cooperating 
together for their progressive advancement 
and for safeguarding their freedom and 
integrity. Its history, both past and present, 
bears witness to the humanitarian aspect of 
its character and to the high ideals it has 
always adhered to for the progress and welfare 
of humanity, and also for its own strength 
and integrity. 
Imperialists ,prospered on the wreck 
of the Arab homelands 
Then the imperialists appeared on the 
scene and they envied the Arabs, their high 
position and the prosperity they enjoyed. They 
saw how its territories abounded with wealth. 
They at once concentrated their energy on 
divesting the Arab Home of its power and 
deviated them from their normal path, until 
the edifice of peace which they built during 
many centuries crumbled down. The Arab 
East has for a long spell of time been dominat-
ed by imperialism and all its evils Arabs were 
divested of the means of gaining their daily 
bread, and the imperialist agents were always 
ready to impress upon the simple Arab peoples 
that they alone were capable of looking after 
them and provide for them materially, and 
morally protect and defend them. They divided 
thc Arab homeland into petty states in order 
that the imperialists could live on the sweat 
?

of the Arabs, enjoy their wealth, and usurp 
their homelands. Thus, imperialism prospered 
on the wreck of the Arab homeland, and 
enjoyed its wealth without restraint. 
The mean and vile aspects of the foreign 
coloniser's abominable nature 
This is exactly the crime which the foreign 
colonizer has committed against the Arab 
homeland and infested it with every mean and 
vile aspect of his own abominable nature, in 
order to lead the Arabs to poverty and moral 
deterioration, "sowing among its population 
the seeds of misery, disease and ignorance in 
order to break its backbone and to ensure the 
continuity of his domination. 
Arab sons stand today as a solid 
monolithic phalanx 
Yet, the prolifk Arab nation, despite all 
the machinations of imperialism, has proved 
that it is still conscious of its latent power, 
that it still possesses the spirit to continue her 
heroic struggle for the defence of its dear Arab 
homelands, and that it will soon march en 
masse against the imperialists and the agents 
of evil, crush them and recover its freedom 
and renew its glorious traditions once more. 
The 1952 Revolution of Egypt, and her 
union with Syria, which resulted in the birth 
of the United Arab Republic, and the recent 
Iraqi Revolution are but positive facts of the 
awakening of Arab consciousness, and the 
thundering voice of the Arab homeland, with 
all its Arab sons standing as a solid monoli-
, 
thic phalanx in the face of the tyramcal colo-
niser.

AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
Israel a creation of Imperialism to crush 
Arab Nationalism 
It is a conspicuouS phenomenon which 
the tyrants arc witnessing with flabbergasted 
eyes and are being terrified of its consequences. 
This is the main reason for their resorting to 
the sterile, old methods of treachery and ma-
chiavellian knavery in an atteimpt to crush 
Arab nationalism, by creating the state of 
Israel in the Arab East in order to be a tool 
for the realization of their political and eco-
nomic greed. The creation of this alien state 
within Ar-ab territory is in itself a definite 
proof of the eN il intentions which imperialism 
fosters against Arab nationalism. 
Fresh supply of arms to Israel 
This act of creating the state of Israel is 
a proof of the barbarity of the imperialists, 
and is also a definite evidence that we have 
returned to the age of piracy. This is cigar 
from the fact that this newly created alien 
state has banished the original inhabitants of 
Palestine from their homes, and usurped their 
property and wealth with the help of the im-
perialists by taking recourse to the most im-
moral, mean and barbarous methods. 
Until this very day, the imperialist 
powers, have not ceased to provide their 
Israeli satellite with masses of weapons-, in 
order to perpetrate attacks .against the neigh-
Louring Arab countries every now and then. 
Relying thus on the assistance Of the impe-
rialist states, Israel seeks to prevent the Arabs 
fi om stabilizing themselves. 
Wherr?the imperialists became convinced 
that the movement for liberation, which has 
become a pathword among the Arab peoples, 
is expanding, and that the victories achieved 
by the Arabs through their successful revolu-
tions against imperialism and its agents 
threaten to overthrow them, they felt that the 
old methods of using armed forces for the 
occupation of Arab countries no longer serve 
their purpose. And so they have concentrated 
on- strengthening Israel, the veritable thorn in 
the side of the Arab homeland, and on supply-
ing it with an abundance of weapons so that 
it may be strong enough to oppose Arab Na-
tionalism, and become a tool in the hands of 
imperialism, serving its purpose and its greed 
in this region. 
Arabs Stand United As one Man 
But this policy shall lead, undoubtedly, to 
the acceleration of Arab nationalism, to the 
strengthening of the national feeling and spirit 
among the nations of this territory and shall 
inevitably bring about the downfall of impe-
rialism, its influence and interests in that 
region. 
Today, the Arab nation stands united as 
one man to defend itself against this impe-
rialistic danger. The pre-requisites of Arab 
Nationalism ha x e been completed, and the aim 
bas been unified and defined. It has become as 
clear as daylight. It is the unification of the 
whole of the Arab Nation, right from the 
extremity of the Persian Gulf to the Atlantic. 
The colonizer feels that he has missed the 
boat, and that this new Arab consciousness 
has exasperated him to the verge of madness. 
He, therefore, is bent upon strengthening 
Israel by all means and provide her by all 
kinds of devastating weapons. Latest news 
from England confirm that Israel has been 
provided by English submarines, in order that 
as the obedient satellite of imperialism it may 
carry out its mean and vile aims. 
.The Arabs are unconquerable: 
Imperialists on the run 
But today differs from yesterday. Today 
all the Arab nations stand united against im-
perialism and its e?ils. Today, Arab nationa-
lism has become a positive fact which no one 
can deny. It is the towering giant escaping 
from the bottle, terrifying the powers of evil, 
n d instilling the fear of God in the hearts of 
the impefialists. It is the indomitable will of 
all the Arab peoples who are closely linked 
together by tics of a single common language, 
a single common culture, and close relation-
ship.

AFRO-ASIAN WORLD MOBILISED TO SUPPORT 
THE ARAB AND CHINESE BRETHRN 
(The statements issued by the Permanent Secretariat of Afro-
Asian Solidarity have been receiving the most enthusiastic response 
throughout the vast Afro-Asian world of 1600 millions people. It is only 
natural, since the Permanent Secretariat voices the indomitable will to 
freedom of the Afro-Asian Peoples, which no power, howselver brutal, 
vile and inhuman, can hold in check. Following the appeals of the 
Permanent Secretariat, every National Commiitee went into aclion, and 
we have received many reports from all over. We compile some of 
them below. (Editor) 
Chida 
The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity issued the following statement on 
September 23, 1958, on the situation in Taiwan 
Straits : 
"The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity warmly supports the statement of 
Foreign Minister Chen Yi on September 20, 
1958, in refutation of the statement by Dulles 
and supports the second warning to Eisen-
hower by Khrushchov, Chairman of the Council 
of the Ministers of the Soviet Union on 
September 19, 1958. 
"Since ancient times, Taiwan has always 
been Chinese territory. The Chinese people 
must recover such coastal islands as Quemoy 
and Matsu and liberate Taiwan in order to 
safeguard the sovereignty and territorial inte-
grity of our country. This is absolutely 
Chinese people's internal affair. But the United 
States has invaded and occupied the Chinese 
territory of Taiwan and recently concentrated 
a large number of armed forces in the Taiwan 
Strait area, repeatedly intruded China's terri-
torial air and waters, carried out frenzied mi-
litary provocations and NN ar threats against the 
Peoples' Republic of China'. Such actions of 
the United States are not only aggression and 
provocations against China but also constitute 
an open challenge to the Bandung _spirit and 
seriously threaten peace in Asia and the 
world. 
"The U.S. imperialists have repeatedly 
created tensions 'and intensified their aggres-
sive activities in Asia and Africa. The U.S. 
imperialists have obstructed by all means the 
peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam, 
openly supported the rebels in their subversive 
activities against the Indonesian Republic, in-
terfered with armed force in the internal 
affairs of Lebanon, deliberately postponed the 
withdrawal of their aggressive forces from the 
Lebanon and the Middle East and threatened 
the security of the Iraqi Republic. Now the 
U.S. imperialists are carrying out aggression 
and provocations against China in the Taiwan 
Straits area. The barbarous aggression of the 
United States against the people of China and 
other countries of Asia and Africa has proved 
them to be the mortal enemy of the Chinese 
people and the common and most ferocious 
enemy of the peoples of Asia and Africa. 
"The Chinese people are peace-loving, but 
,NN e are never afraid of war and shall never 
submit to the imperialist's war threats. If the 
imperialists should dare to impose war on us,

The Indian Association for Afro-Asian

to the Press on 6-9-58 on the situation in West 
Asia. 
"The Indian Association for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity welcomes the united resolution of 
the Arab countries in the U.N.O., which vir-

opened up perspective for the peaceful solution 
of West Asia crisis. 
"The Association calls upon the U.S. and 
British farces in Lebanon and Jordan to with-
draw without delay and thus help implement 
the unanimous 1.:_N resolution on West Asia. 
"The Association is gratified at the Prime 
Minister Designate of Lebanon calling for the 
withdrawl of U.S. troops, which gives an 
assurance that the new Government will 
pursue an independent and neutral policy and 
actively" contribute to the growing nationalism

people of the Arab ,countries and pledges its 
continued support for their just aspiration for 
national sovereignrY and unity of their home-
lands". 
STATEMENT ON THE FAR EAST 
SITUATION 
The Indian Association for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity issued the following statement 
to the Press on 6-9-58 on the situation in the 
Far East : 
"The Indian Association for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity views with alarm the growing 
tension in the Far East caused by the unpa-
ralleled concentration of U.S. military, naval 
and air forces, including nuclear weapons, in 
the territorial waters of China and in the 
Chinese territory of Taiwan. 
"The Association once again firmly asserts 
that Taiwan and the off-shore islands belong 
to the People's Republic of China and we 
strongly condemn the continued interference 
of the U.S. in the internal affairs of the Chinese 
people and the lawful desire of the Govt. of 
the Chinese Peoples Republic to integrate these 
territories with the mainland. We further 
condemn the continued use of these islands 
by Chiang- Kai-Shek to dislocate China's peace-
ful sea-trade and communications and to 
constantly threaten the mainland of China 
militarily and otherwise. 
"Our Association once again reiterates 
that there can be no solution to the Far East 
situation until China takes her rightful place 
in the U.N.O. and the U.S. stops its aggressive 
threats and actions in this area and its support 
to Chiang Kai-Shek. 
"All Asia today stands with the people of 
China in its demand that Taiwan and the off-
shore islands are a part of the Chinese terri-
tory and that no violation of its territory or 
waters can be tolerated. U.S. actions against 
China is doomed to failure as was the case in 
the Middle East. 
"The Indian Association for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity calls upon its branches to carry on

PUBLIC MEETING FOR SOLIDARITY 
WITH CHINA 
A well-attended public meeting was 
organised by the Indian Association for 
Afro-Asian Solidarity in Delhi on Sept. 16th 
to protest against U.S. intervention in the 
Taiwan straits and for Recognition for Peoples' 
Republic of China by the U.N.O. 
Every speaker stressed "Hands Off China" 
? a slogan which met with enthusiasm by the 
audience. The illogical stand by the U.S.A. 
and its policy of brinkmanship was unkersally 
condemned. 
San. Rameshwari Nehru presided and the 
other speakers were Mr.. M. Govinda Reddy, 
M.P., Prof. Hiren Mukerjee, M.P., and Dr. 
Gyan Chand. The following resolution was 
passed unanimously at the meeting : 
"This meeting of the citizens of Delhi held 
under the auspices of the Indian Association 
for Afro-Asian Solidarity views with alarm the 
growing danger of world war in the Far East 
caused by the unparalleled concentration of 
U.S. military, naval and air forces, including 
nuclear weapons, in the territorial waters of 
China and in the Chinese Territory of Taiwan 
and by the interference of the U.S. forces into 
the internal affairs of China. 
"This meeting once again firmly asserts 
that Taiwan and the off-shore islands belong 
to the People's Republic of China and it has 
every right to the possession of these islands. 
We strongly condemn the continued inter-
ference of the U.S. in the internal affairs of 
the Chinese people and the lawful desire of 
the Govt of the Chinese People's Republic to 
integrate these territories with the mainland_ 
We further condemn the continued use of these 
islands by Chiang Kai-Shek to blockade and 
to dislocate China's peaceful sea-trade and 
communications and to constantly threaten the 
mainland of China miliranirly and otherwise. 
-This meeting also reiterates that mere can 
be no solution to the Far East situation until 
China takes her rightful place in the U.N.O-
and the U.S. stops its aggressive threats and 
actit..an.s in this area and its support to (-Mang 
Kai-Shek. We demand the immediate with-
drawal of the Seventh Fleet from Taiwan 
straits. 
"Public opinion all over the world, including 
a number of. Go?ernments, support the people 
of China in their demand that Taiwan and the 
off-shore islands are a part of the Chinese 
territory and that no violation of its territory 
or waters can be tolerated. U.S. action against 
China is doomed to failure as was the case in 
the Middle East. 
"We hope that the meeting of the Ambas-
,Aors of the C.S.A. and Peoples China in War-
saw will bear fruit and settlement will be 
reached on the basis of the recognition of the 
just rights of the Chinese people".

to the brave people of Algeria who are fighting 
against French colonial rule for their freedom. 
It Calls upon the people of India to support 
actively the people of Algeria and to extend

tution is being imposed on a people against its 
will.

the French Government to end the war against 
the Algerian people and to settle the question 
of Algeria with the Algerian Front of National 
Liberation on the basis of the sovereignty of

speak on behalf of the people of Algeria. This

the world, particularly of Asia and Africa, will

"People met the rising sun of 14th 
July 1958 in Iraq and elsewhere with the voice 
of one of the Iraqi revolutionary leaders from 
Baghdad Radio telling them that a revolution 
had taken place in Iraq and.that the monarchy 
was abolished and a new Republic was declared 
which will be guided by the principles of the 
United Nations Charter and the resolutions of 
Bandung Conference: 
"This was a great victory for the Bandung 
Principles and for the Afro-Asian Community 
and for the high principles of self-determina-
tion, and world peace and friendship among 
nations. It was very significant that the 
Bandung resolutions were upheld from the very 
first hours of the Iraqi revolution. 
"The great importance of the Bandung 
Conference, in my opinion lies in the fact that 
it emphasizes and confirms the common bonds 
which link countries from Africa and Asia. 
The Bandung Conference also brings out the 
essential unity of objectives and the need for 
intensive cooperation among these countries. 
They have all suffered from colonialism, and 
they all seek self determination and indepen-
dence and insist on their rights to shape their 
own policies on the basis of their vital interests 
and fOr the sake of world peace. The Bandung 
Conference laid down the foundation for coope-
ration among Afro-Asian nations to settle in-
ternational disputes by peaceful means and on 
the basis of the merits of each case, and not 
on the basis of power politics and military 
blocs. Thus it foreshadowed an era of law, 
order and morality in international relations.

accepted in Bandung where other principles

"The Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Con-

The new Iraqi Republican Government is 
guided by the resolutions adopted in that Con-
ference. Most of the delegates to that Confe-

Statement of Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity 
Committee demanding the release 
of Jordan's Patriots 
"The monstrous crimes perpetrated by the 
ruling palace clique in Jordan, which the British 
occupation army is holding in power, have 
aroused profound indignation among all 
peoples of the world. Although under pressure 
of public opinion the life of the Jordanian 
patriot, Nadi es-Salti, was -saved and the sen-
tences of some other patriots mitigated, the 
merciless hand of the executioner still hangs 
over many Jordanian patriots. The military 
tribunals continue to meet out death sentences, 
accusing Jordan patriots of an "attempt on the 
security of the throne". On behalf of millions 
of Soviet people the Soviet Afro-Asian Soli-
darity Committee demands the' repeal of the 
death sentence on Theodore Stefan and Ahmed 
Ibrahim, and their immediate release King 
Hussein and his British patrons want to kill 
Theodore Stefan and Ahmed Ibrahim. 
"Jordan has been converted into an out-
and-out torture-chamber. Thousands of honest 
Jordanians fill the prisons and concentration 
camps where they are tortured and killed be-
cause they demand the withdrawal of the occu-
pation troops from their country. Egged on 
by his imperialist patrons, King Hussein is 
prepared to soak Jordan in blood to uphold the 
tyrannical power and to place on the Jordanian 
people still heavier chains of colonial enslave-
ment. 
"The police tyranny directed against the 
Jordanian patriots shows the true worth of the 
false assurances of British diplomats that they 
had come to Jordan as friends and saViours.

"The British imperialists will not succeed 
in hoodwinking anyone, in misleading world

"The, responsibility for the reign of terror 
and bloodshed let loose in Jordan lies, above 
all, with the British invaders who had come to 
Jordan for no other purpose than to protect 
with their arms the thoroughly rotten throne 
of their henchman i Hussein, and to strangle 
the growing resistance of the Jordanian people 
to the imperialist colonialists. 
"The Soviet people who have invariably 
expressed their ardent sympathies for and 
support of the peoples of Asia and Africa, 
fighting courageously for their freedom and 
independence, resolutely demand the immediate 
withdrawal of US and British troops from the 
Lebanon and Jordan and the curbing of the

? the violation Py US military .aircraft and

show that US aggressive circles have learnt 
nothing from the recent events in the Middle 
East. They are again deliberately increasing 
international tension, actually threatening the 
peace and security of all nations. 
"On behalf of all Soviet people the Soviet 
Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee declares that 
the Soviet people as a whole fully support the 
great Chinese people in their just struggle 
against the US and Chiang Kai-Shek provo-

struggle against the US-Chiang Kai-Shek

addressed to US President Dwight Eisen-

repressions, assassinations, torture, arrests; 
deportations and explusions the, referendum 
returns cannot have legal force. The fact that 
all the arrangements for the referendum in 
Algeria have been entrusted to headquarters 
of the French occupation army is evidence of 
the brazen arbitrariness of the French colo-nialists. 
"The UNO Charter and the Declaration 
on Human Rights guarantees the peoples the 
right of self-determination. The freedom-

Sept.-Oct. 1958 
? :,"A new bright page in, the selfless struggle 
of--the heroic. Algerian people fen- freedom and 
independence has opened, with the birth of ..the 
Algerian Republic._ 
- "Vain arc the attempts Of the French co-
lonialists, who, referring to the "referendum 
results",in Algeria,-try to mislead world public 
, 
Opinion. Every_ unbiased person will see that 
threferewdum held in the conditions of the 
military occupation of the country is void Of 
1e-gal.f6rce: No one doubts flie fact that the 
.results of the "referendum" in Algeria. do not 
in any way" express the will of the freedom-
loving Algerian people. If, during the so called 
referendum,- 97% ,of the Algerians "voted" for 
the perpetuation of slavery by affiliating 
Algeria, with France,: then against whom do 
the colonialists intend to unleash another 
bloody \ yar of annihilation ? 
"Today the -demand to put an end to the 
dirty war of the French colonialists against 
'the? freedom-loving Algerian people rings 
:strOnger than ever throughout the world. 
"All friends of peace and people of good 
will wholeheartedly support the Algerian Re-
public and wish it-with all their hearts to bring 
the national liberation struggle of the Algerian 
people to final victory. 
"The long-suffering- people of Algeria 
have, with the blood of _their best sons and 
dfughters, won the right to a sovereign in-
dependent state. 
"Let those who, arms in hand, have broken 
.into another's home, who sow death and 
reduce *to ashes Algerian towns and villages 
? know that colonialism is doomed, that the 
peoples are fully determined to put an end to 
it. 
"The prOclamation of the Algerian 'Repu-
blic and the fbrmation of a free government of 
fhis Republic, being an expression of the che-
rished thoughts, hopes and the will of the 
Algerian people, proves convincingly that the 
Frenchcolonialists will no.t succeed in throw-
. . 
.ing, the chains of slavery and oppression over 
the Algerianseither by force of arms or by the 
so-called constitutional means: 
"The birth Of the Algerian Republic is a 
matter of great historical significance, ,the 
logical continuation, in the new conditions, of 
the national liberation struggle of the Algerian 
people. - 
"The Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Com-
mittee supports the young Algerian Republic 
and its first free government in the fight 
against the colonialists, for completely clearing 
.,AN1gerian territory of the occupation troops. 
"The sympathies of the Soviet people have 
always been with the 'fighting Algerian people. 
"At numerous _meetings and rallies Soviet 
people resolutely voice support for the young 
Algerian Republic, their solidarity with the 
just struggle of the Algerian people. 
"The Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Com-
mittee is confident that the Algerian Republic, 
headed by its first free government, will, with 
the active support of all the peacelowing 
forces, achieve final victory over the foreign 
invaders". 
Korea 
The Korean Committee for Afro-Asian 
Solidarity adopted the following resolution on 
the Middle East situation at an , enlarged 
meeting : 
"The grave situation being created in 
the Near and Middle East by the armed 
aggression of the U.S.-British imperialists is 
rousing today- the apprehension of all people 
who love peace. 
"It is the unanimous desire and demand 
of the entire world people to curb the impe-
rialiSts aggression in the Lebanon and Jordan 
and to restore peace in this area. The Ame-
rican- and British imperialists are gravely 
endangering peace and the security- of the 
whole world by refusing the proposal of the 
Soviet Union on the convocation of a confe-
rence- of government Heads of Five Powers 
which the people of the entire world demand 
as one and by further aggravating the situa-
tion in the Near and Middle East area through 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
AFRO-ASIAN IfULLETig 
the reinforcement of their military personnel 
and war equipment and material in this area. 
"Under such circumstances, the Govern-
ment of the Soviet Union proposed to convene 
an emergency special session of the U.N. 
General Assembly for the discussion of the 
question of making the U.S. and British 
aggressive forces withdraw from Lebanon and 
Jordan. 
"The Korean people warmly approve and 
support this measure of the Soviet Union as 
one which opens up new prospects for the 
peaceful settlement of the Near and Middle 
East question. 
"The current emergency special session of 
the U.N. General Assembly must immediately 
take measures, in conformity with the unani-
mous demand and wish of the entire people 
of the world, for bringing to a halt the U.S.-
'British imperialists aggression in the Near and 
Middle East and for restoring peace in this 
area. 
"However, the U.S. and British impe-
rialists are brazenfaccdly describing the 
aggressive acts they are committing in the 
Near and Middle East as if they were prompt-
ed by a certain "indirect aggression", which 
does not exist. 
"Such trickery of theirs is not a new one. 
"They ,are occupying the Southern part of 
our country by armed force and running wild 
in introducing various new types of weapons 
including atomic into South Korea and setting 
up an atomic and guided missile base there in 
flagrant violation of the Korean Armistice 
Agreement. 
"Just as the Korean question cannot be 
solved by peaceful means without the with-
drawal of the U.S. imperialist aggressive army 
from Korea, peace and security in the Near 
and Middle East cannot be ensured unless the 
U S. and British aggressive armies pull out of 
the Lebanon and jordan. 
"The Korean people strongly demand the 
US-British aggressive armies to withdraw 
from the Lebanon and. Jordan. 
"We fervently support and encourage the 
27 
people of the Arab countri6 in their struggle 
for the withdrawal- of the U.S. and British 
aggressive armies' and for their freedom and 
national independence. 
"Today no force on earth can block the 
current of the times in which the colonial 
system is rapidly collapsing in the Asian, and 
African area. 
"We strongly demand that at the current 
emergency SPecial session of the U.N. General 
: 
Assembly, the U.N. merdber natiiths; proceeding 
from the lofty Mission 'assigned to th6d, take 
effective measures- fifir the -withdrawal- of the 
U.S. and British aggressive armies froth -fhe 
Lebanon and Jordan .and check the intervens 
tion of the colonialists in the .internal- affairs 
of the Arab countries. 
"Today the powerful peace forces headed 
by the Soviet Union are decisively prevailing 
over the imperialist war_ forces. Should the 
U S. and British imperialists continue their 
bankrupt military adventure, disregarding .the 
voice of the world people, they will /not be able 
to escape the severe punishment of the people 
of the whole world".

Vietnam 
Statement issued by the political parties

protest against the armed intervention of 
American imperialism in Lebanon and othe 
Arab countries : ? 
"On the 15th of July 1958 American Impe-
rialist troops landed on Lebanese soil and open-
ed fire on its citizens. The British on their part 
dropped their troops from the air by means 
of parachutes on Jordanian territory during 
the morning of July 17, 1958. In an attempt 
to justify .their armed intervention in Lebanon 
the American government advanced the pretext 
of protecting the lives of American residing in 
Lebanon and of safegnarding the sovereignty 
and independence of that country. Meanwhile 
no one has been dupe enough to believe in such 
vile arguments. The truth of the matter is 
that in face of the just struggle of the Leba-
nese people against an unpopular government 
serving nought else save the interest of the 
imperialist elements, and in face of the grand 
and glorious victory of the Iraqi people who 
installed a republican government in their 
country very much devoted to the safety of 
its sovereign rights and national independence, 
then again in face of the expanding movement 
of the Arab peoples who are opposed to the 
Baghdad bloc and the Eisenhower-Dulles 
Doctrine, the American imperialists and their 
satellites were seized by panic and committed 
the insane act of intervening militarily in Le-
banon and in other countries of both the 
- Middle and Near East with the View of pro-
tecting their unjust and illicit interests repre-
sented by the petrol fields and of maintaining 
their fertile rapidly disappearing colonial do-
mination. 
"The aggressive act of American impe-
rialists and their gang shall meet with a shame-
ful defeat, as it was the case in Korea, in 
Vietnam, in Egypt and in Syria".

AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 29 
DE GAULLE'S DUPLICITY IN AFRICA 
The Hoax of ihe French 'Referendum 
STATEMENT OF THE PERMANENT SECRETARIAT 
ON POLITICAL SITUATION IN AFRICA BEFORE THE FRENCH "REFERENDUM" 
(I) Africa strongly aspires to independence 
and unity: 
Ever since the Algerian military coup of 
May 13, 1958, Africa has reaffirmed its will 
and determination for independence and unity. 
This is apparent not only in Algeria and the 
Kamerun where fighters for freedom continue 
heroically their struggle against the reinforced 
armies of De Gaulle, but the whole of Black 
Africa and Madagascar. 
Since May 15, Committees for the Defence 
of Democratic Liberties have been formed all 
through the continent. At the same time, de-
finite anti-De Gaulle stands have been taken 
in every part of Africa. The African Inde-
pendence Party for instance launched an appeal 
warning populations that "a serious danger is 
threatening the liberation prospect of Black 
Africa under French domination, as Fascism 
is restored with its spirit of reconquest and 
the terror it generates". 
On the other hand, the Constitutive 
Congress of the African Regroupment Party, 
assembled in Contonou in July, with the parti-
cipation of all Black Africa under French do-
mination, unanimously adopted the following 
resolution : 
"The Congress recommends the creation 
of a solid and progressive African community, 
with every possibility to co-operate in the poli-
tical field with any other community, in the 
framework of liberty and equality : it urges 
France and its people to contribute in faci-
litating the early reunion of Black African 
Constituent Assemblies, it assumes the coun-
tersign of immediate independence and decides 
to take all necessary measures to call Out the 
African masses under the banner of this coun-
tersign and to transform this will for inde-
pendence into concrete facts. 
"These demands for unity and independence 
are also expressed by all other organizations : 
cultural, labour, students, etc. The powerful 
Black Africa Student's Federation in France 
has described De Gaulle as "the man who 
rejects continuously the colonised people's 
claims for independence". The UOTAN, the 
great head syndicate that unites more than 
900/ of workers in Black Africa under French 
domination has declared : 
"The establishment of new relations 
between France and Black Africa will have to 
be carried out, not on the basis of a granted 
charter, not even through a referendum in-
cluding the Metropolis and the Overseas terri-
tories, but on the basis of a free discussion 
between the French representatives, on one 
hand, and the African representatives, o'n the 
other hand, in order to reach a conclusion pre-
serving the indisputable rights of the African 
populations to independence". 
Therefore, there exists now in Africa a 
powerful stream in favour of Unity and Inde-
pendence. Its power was displayed during the 
constitutional tour of De Gaulle. Every-
where, nationalist leaders asked that the 
Constitution be amended ?to recognize the 
African peoples' rights to independence. The 
crowds, mainly in Dakar, have demonstrated 
to support this idea. 
(II) For the following reasons De Gaulle's 
referendum is an obstacle to this popular 
stream: 
1. It is a French referendum, and we all 
know that a people that does not enti-
rely govern itself cannot link its fate 
to the destiny of a foreign nation.

30 AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
7. We also know that a popular consulta-, 
tion organized only by the colonial 
powers is never a democratic one. We 
state as an example the following 
maxim : "The Algerian-like elections" 
which proves that gerrymanded elec-
tions practised by imperialists, are of 
universal reputation. 
3 De Gaulle's Government is already 
taking legal actions against African pa-
triots who called for independence, 
during his stop-over in Dakar. 
4. The fact that he (De Gaulle) is trying 
to impose this referendum upon Alge-
ria ; also its consequences in the Ka-
merun ? a counity: in a state of war 
? while the French Constitution de-
clares that every constitutional decision 
ta::en while the country is occupied is 
null and void. 
The Constitution they are trying to 
impose upon the African peoples aims 
at perpetuating their domination and 
exploitation. 
6. It is the President of the French Re-
public and the French imperialists who 
possess all the poNN Cr, not only in the 
Republic, but also in the so-called 
"French-African Community" (arts. 78, 
80 and 83 of the draft constitution). 
7. The new constitution is opposed to the 
granting of independence to the Afri-
can territories since, such a decision 
could not take effect before being 
approved by French authorities. Now, 
imperialists are too much interested in 
the human and natural wealths of Afri-
ca, to accept willingly to loose them. 
8. For the same reason, the new consti-
tution opposes itself to African unity, 
for, "the status, extent, eventual re-
groupment, and organisation of the 
overseas territories" depend entirely 
upon the laws of the Republic. More-
over, their organisation being defined 
and modified by the French Law (art. 
74), these territories risk to be par-
5. 
celled out like Algeria and the Sahara. 
French imperialists dream in particular 
to annex the whole Sahara-Mauritania 
region, in order to be able to protect 
it more effeciently against Arab and 
African nationalism and against the 
rival covetousness of other impe-
rialists. 
In the light of this, and: 
Consideting that every people has an 
undisputable right to organize itself 
into an independent and sovereign 
State ; 
? Considering that a people that is not 
entirely self-government cannot possi-
bly link its fate to the destiny of 
another nation , 
? Considering as contradictory to this 
double-objective contained in the 
United Nations Charter, 
? The colonial wars in Algeria, in the 
Kamcruns and in other French co-
lonies. 
? The French Government decision to 
associate the populations of Algeria, 
Black Africa and Madagascar to the 
De Gaulle Referendum, 
The Permanent Secretariat for Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity: 
(1) 
Condemns any more to associate the 
peoples of Africa and Madagascar to 
the French referendum, as opposed to 
the will of independence and unity 
expressed by these peoples ; 
(2) Urges the French Government. to 
enter into immediate negotiations 
with the Algerian National Liberation 
Front, on the basis of full independen-
ce for Algeria , 
Also urges the French and British go-
vernments to open immediate nego-
ciations with the U.P.C. (Union of the 
Populations of the Kameruns) for 
Reunification and Independence of the 
Karnerun ; 
Suggests to the United Nations Vi-
siting Mission, expected soon in the

Kamerun, to make all efforts in order 
to receive all petitions and all peti-
tioners, in private, and avoid to meet 
them in the presence of officials, in 
the very spirit of the U.N.'s Charter.

REIGN OF TERROR IN MADAGASCAR 
ON EVE OF "REFERENDUM" 
The following communication received at 
the Permanent Secretariat from the Congress 
of Independence of Madagascar describes the 
situation in the area on the eve of the French 
"referendum" : 
On September 18, 1938, two delegates of 
the "Permanent Delegation of the Congress of 
Independence of Madagascar", Messrs. Rako-
tomanga Eloi and jorondrazana, in charge of 
propaganda in the Realanana District (Pro-
vince of Majunga), went to Mangindrano to 
hold an electoral conference. As they were 
addressing the crowds, instigators started to 
beat them ??ith bludgeons Mr. Rakotomanga 
Eloi, badly hurt, was transported to Majunga 
to receive the necessary medical assistance 
On September 13, 1958, in Bolampona, 
Andapa District (Province of Diego-Suarez), 
Mr. Rabearise, who dared to contradict mem-
bers of the Social Democrat Party, during one 
of their informal meetings, was slapped on the 
face and beaten by one of the speakers, Bela-
zaina. On the same day, in the village of Amba 
Amanasy I, canton of Marovato (Andapa 
District) citizen Tsarasidy and members of the 
Social Democrat Party destro)ed the huts 
of Messrs. Randriambololona and Rakotozafy 
Thomas. 
On September 20, 1958, Mr. Randrianiatna, 
ho lived in Faratsiho (Antsirabe District, 
Province of Tananarive), and who is mandatory 
for the "Permanent Delegation" was caught 
in the street by young men from Antsirabe, 
distributing pamphlets in favour of the De 
Gaulle Constitution. They asked him what he 
thought of the Constitution, and having 
replied that he was against it, Mr. Randria-
niaira was violently beaten by the mob which 
threatened to set fire to his house in no time. 
Mr. Randrianiaira filed a complaint at the 
Gendarmerie of Faratsiho.

During the night of the 20 to the 21st 
September, "unidentified" elements set fire to 
a garage belonging to Mr. Saka Pierre, mem-
ber of the Provincial Council of Tamotabe and 
mandatory for the "Permanent Delegation". 
The fire destroyed two cars. 
These facts, cited from many similar 
others, give a clear picture of the reign of 
terror that has been instituted throughout the 
island on the eve of the "Referendum" 
Moreover, \\e ish to emphasize that 
during the different conferences held by our 
propaganda agents in favour of a "NO", insti-
gators went on fomenting troubles and 
threatening that a "NO" vote would mean a 
recurrence of the events of 1947-48. 
All these acts of vandalism and violence 
arc well known to all government officials. 
They are kept informed of their occurrence by 
our representatives, and sometimes they 
N?itness for themselves the brutal treatment 
inflicted 1)) "Yes" supporters. Horeover, we 
have not yet recorded any reaction from their 
part. 
In the presence of these facts, in addition 
to many others, we cannot but reserve our 
opinion as to the fairness and incorruption of 
the referendum due to take place on the 28th 
September 1958. 
ON SITUATION IN FRENCH SOMALILAND 
STATEMENT OF PERMANENT SECTT. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-
Asian Peoples' Solidarity wishes to draw the 
attention of world opinion to the hypocrisy of 
the so-called French Referendum in what is 
known as French Somaliland. 
Behind a cryptic news item in the daily 
press a few days ago announcing the dismissal 
by the French Governor of Prime Minister M. 
Mahmoud Harbi of French Somaliland lies 1. 
tale of deceit and trickery in which the im-
perialist colonialists are so adept. 
The real and effective truth is that the 
people of French Somaliland rejected De 
Gaulle's fake consitution by an overwhelming 
majority of 80 per cent. The strange mathe-
matics of the French imperialists, however,

AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
Sept.-Oct. 1958 
told the world that the freedom loving Somalis 
have voted for their slave constitution by a, 
majority of 70 per cent. 
In arriving at this bogus result the French 
imperialists have without the least qualm of 
conscience added together the votes of such 
farflung territories as Madagascar, French 
Equatorial Africa and many other places. 
Imperialist mathematics is thus exposed as 
false and hollow and far from reality. 
The people of French Somaliland in fact 
stand solidly behind their dismissed Prime 
Minister, M. Mahmoud Harbi, who fearlessly 
declared in Paris sometime ago that French 
Somaliland will reject De Gaulle's constitution 
.md vote unhesitatingly for frecuom. 
The announcement of this bogus and fake 
result and the dismissal of Prime Minister M. 
Mahmoud Harbi has caused a wave of protest 
in French Somaliland. There have been huge 
protest demonstrations all o? er the country. 
The French imperialists have resorted to tra-
ditional colonial methods to suppress this \VavT. 
of mass anger by resorting to indiscriminate 
firings on peaceful demonstrations and letting 
loose a reign of terror over the land. Dozens 
Announcing our Publication 
of unarmed people have been killed by French 
bullets and thousands have been put behind 
prison bars. And the reign of terror continues 
unabated in French Somaliland. 
The Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian 
Peoples' Solidarity strongly protests against 
French highlandednesse and tyranny in Soma-
Wand. While assuring the brave Somali people 
of the fraternal support that they have of the 
freedomloving peoples of Africa and Asia, it 
warns the French colonialists to desist from 
tl.eir tyranical ways and bow before the 
surging wave of freedom which is sweeping 
across the African continent. 
The Permanent Secretariat appeals to all 
National Committees of Afro-Asian Solidarity 
to raise their voice of protest against this 
French tyranny on the Somali people and mo-
bilise public support for the just cause of 
freedom of our Somali brethern. It also calls 
upon the Afro-Asian representatives in the 
United Nations to raise the question of French 
Somaliland in the general Assembly and 
expose the hypocricy and tyranny of French

Kamerun Will Be Free 
The United Nations is again on trial, and 
this time it is the case of a resurgent African 
country, the Kamerun. 
On more than one occasion the United 
Nations has been tried and found wanting. To 
the N as t Afro-Asian humanity it has in-
creasingly re % elated itself as a tool of U.S. 
imperialism, which today seeks to bolster up 
all puppets and reactionaries all oc er the 
odd. and all dying imperialisms like those of 
Britain and France. 
Though repeatedly exposed, the U.S. im-
perialists yet claim on the one hand to be the 
champions of "freedom", and on the other 
hand show their utter blindness and hypocricy 
on innumerable issues, e.g., the case of the 
admission of People's China in the United 
Nations, to mention only one. 
And yet again, that master of imperialist 
chicanery, John Foster Dulles, has recently 
mentioned that his U.S. Government will 
-champion" the cause of African freedom. 
Well, here is a concrete case, the case of 
the heroic Kamerunian people. The United 
Nations General Assembly meets on February 
20 in a special session to discuss the Kamerun 
case fiSr freedom. It will have before it the 
report of an U.N. Visiting Mission, which 
visited this Trust territory towards the end 
of last year. 
With the U.S. as chairman, the U.N. 
'Visiting Mission had as its members Haiti, 
New Zealand and India. From the very be-

ginning the U.I'.C. leaders of Kamerun have 
entertained grave doubts about the possible 
usefulness of this Mission. The world well 
knows what the U.S. imperialists are. Tiny 
Haiti and New Zealand have always been in 
the pockets of this imperialist or that, and 
nothing much was expected of them except 
dittoing what the .U.S. imperialist master told 
them. The only hope was from India, and the 
Kamerun leaders have expected the Repre-
sentative of this Asian country to play the 
role in accordance with India's traditions of 
freedom and fairplay. This high hope they 
entertained even when earlier performances of 
some Indian representatives in the U.N. on the 
Kamerun question had left much to be desired 
for. 
The Repoil of this Visiting Mission of 
the U.N. has not yet seen the light of the day, 
and it would not be fair to anticipate its 
findings. It is, however, certain beyond a 
shadow of doubt that on the fairness or other-
se of the findings of this U.N. Visiting 
Mission directly depends the future of the 
cntire Trusteeship system of the United 
Nations. The Trusteeship system of the late 
unlamented League of Nations was revealed 
as a conspiracy of imperialist robbers to loot 
pnd pillage the trust territories under high 
sounding phrases. Whether the U.N. Trustee-
ship is different will to a large extent be 
decided on what the Visiting Mission has to 
say on the Kamerun.

So far as the 'Kamerun people arc con-
rcerned, and as far as one can judge from what 
? 
the Kamerun leaders say, they hope for .the 
best, but are prepared for the worst. The Ka-
merunians are a most heroic people, and up-to-
date, perhaps the freedom battle of no other 
African country except Algeria has reached 
:those levels of bravery, deathless determination 
and heroism as that of the Kamerun people. 
'Though shrouded by a veil of imperialist censor, 
trickery and brackmail, the heroic tales of the 
:brave struggle of the Kamcrunians has spread 
-far and wide over the entire African Continent, 
and the recent stirrings of the Congolese 
people is only a direct result of the Kamerun 
battle across their frontier. 
In the Union of the Populations of Ca-
-meroons, and in its leadership headed by Dr. 
Felix-Roland Mournie, one comes across a 
determined set of people and leaders whom no 
power on earth can awe, whom no one however 
mighty can curb, who compare with the bravest 
inen who ever rose and fought for freedom. 
The French and the British imperialists 
THE KAMERUNIAN CASE 
are never tired of Maligning the U.P.C. and 
its leaders and have created puppets to 
hoodwink world opinion. This, however, is an 
old and Outdated trick, and too outmoded to 
cut any ice. 
The demand of the Kamerunian people 
headed by the U.P.C. are simple and straight. 
The All African People's Conference at Accra 
has wholcheastedly supported them and the 
same demands have been endorsed by the 
Permanent Secretariat of Afro-Asian Soli-
darity. We publish the Secretariat's State-
ment for observance of February 20, 1959, as 
Kamerun Day elsewhere in this issue. 
On this coming February 20, the entire 
Afro-Asian world will rise as one man behind 
the demand of the Kamerunian people headed 
by the U.P.C. The brave Kamerunian people 
will determinedly march forward to wrest their 
freedom with the specific assurance that the 
masses of Africa and Asia are behind them. 
Even if the U.N. fails once again, the freedom 
of Kamerun can not be far off. 
Ravings Of An Imperialist Mouthpiece 
By 
FELIX-ROLAND MOUMIE 
(President of the U.P.C.) 
In its editorial of December 27, 1957,. the 
"Economist" of London wrote : "The future 
.of the Kamerun which the United Nations will 
-discuss next February is an urgent matter and 
at the same time a tangled and a complicated 
one". A little further in the same article the 
"Economist" affirms : "It seems perfectly 
possible that the year 1960 will witness the 
birth of the first Communist republic in 
Africa". 
Decidedly, the Kamerunian problem is an 
urgent and a complicated one : urgent because 
the rotteness of its situation exists since 1955 
on account of 'the stubbornness of the ztdini-
histrative authorities who refuse to accept the 
peaceful and democratic solution proposed by

the U.P.C., which, whether these authorities 
admit it or not, is the incarnation of the 
aspirations of the Kamerunian people. Com-
plicated because the same authorities, that is 
to say, the French and the British ? naturally 
refused to cooperate together in coordinating 
their plans in such a manner as to ensure the 
:iolution of the urgent Kamerunian question, 
in conformity with the aspirations of the 
people concerned. In this, we are in perfect 
harmony with the editor of the "Economist". 
On the other hand, we disagree with the 
.statoment in which the editor endeavours to 
forecast, without proof or argument, that the 
first Kamerunian republic in Africa will be of 
a Communistic nature. It is true that whoever 
wishes to destroy his dog will accuse it of 
-(listemper. Apparently, the greatest menace 
which exists in the Kameruns ? in the opinion 
of the "Economist" ? is the Communist 
menace, and not the puppet government and 
assembly which the administrative authorities 
seek to set up and foster against the people's 
will. The Me\ itable consequence of this un-
popular policy is that the Kamerunian people, 
on seeing their lawful rights frustatcd, will 
have no alternative but to, revolt against 
tyranny and oppression and continue their 
armed resistance until their national rights 
have been recognized. This is exactly what 
happened and still happens in the Middle East 
and South America, where peoples deprived of 
Their liberty and aspiring to their independence 
took up arms and revcilted against the usurpers. 
The case of Iraq and Cuba speak eloquently 
for themselves and need no commentary. Here 
-then is, the real danger threatening the Ka-
merun. The supposed Communistic menace is 
but a veiled alibi which is only cited to cover

has been amply proved since the second NN orld

menace is to accept the propositions of the 
U.P.C. which are modest enough in themselves 
and'which reflect our ardent desire of arriving 
at a peaceful and democratic solution of the

Unanimously, this Conference has decided to

that the Accra Conference has invited all-

8 AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
Jan. 1959 
PROFILE OF THE KAMERUN LEADER 
Dr. FELIX-ROLAND MOUM1E 
On November 1, 1926, a son was born to 
a Protestant couple of Foumban in the Ca-
meroons. The father was an agricultural of-
ficial named Moumie. (He has, incidentally, 
recently been released from prison). The son 
was christened Felix. When he was ten years 
old, however, he read the story of Roland, 
the legendary hero who died for his country, 
and himself adopted the name of "Roland" to 
bear witness to his patriotism, for the Came-
roons. The Moumics were Members of the 
Bamoum tribe who, numbering about 80,000, 
are famous for their warrior tradition, as well 
as for their ancient artistic reputation. Later 
Felix had a little sister ? a deaf mute ? from 
the samd mother. When his father re-married, 
there were four more girls, and three more 
boys. Felix-Roland was an apt pupil, and 
studied hard. He was sent to a series of 
schools at Bafoussam, at Dschang, and at 
Brazzaville. When he was 12 years old he 
went to Ryos at Dakar. Here he studied for 
five years (1942-1947); and here too he met 
Gabriel d'Arboussier for whom Moumie feels 
a strong affection, and whom he calls to this 
day "the most learned of Africans". At Dakar 
Moumie studied medicine. They were, how-
ever, difficult years for the students. In 1947 
a strike broke out in the medical school, and 
Moumie ,found himself one of the student 
leaders. "We obtained 100% satisfaction of 
our demands", he remembers. Through his 
political friends in Dakar he became interested 
in the Rassemblement Democratique African 
of Houphouet-Boigny, and became the Secre-
tary-General of the party's student section. 
Nineteen forty-seven was also the year 
that Felix-Roland returned to the Cameroons. 
At this time he made a vital friendship that 
was to alter the course of Cameroonian 
history. He was travelling in a railway- car-
riage. Down the corridor of the car, in 
another compartment, he could hear a con-
versation being carried on. Both the voice 
and the sentiments of the principal speaker 
were much to his liking ? so much so that 
he sat up suddenly in his seat. "That man 
speaks ,,the same language that I do !" he said 
to himself, "I must go and meet him at 
once". The voice of the unknown speaker 
turned out to belong to Urn Nyobe, of the 
Bassa tribe. The language that he and Moumie 
spoke in common was the language of African 
nationalism ! Before the train reached its 
destination ? Yaounde ? Nyobe and Moumie-
together had founded the U.P.C., the Union 
of Populations of the Cameroons, which today 
is known throughout the world as the 
strongest political party in the territory, and 
which plays a role in the Cameroons similar 
to that played by the F.L.N. in Algeria. 
The French, however, were conscious oi 
the power of the movement, and before long 
they managed to disperse the principal U P.C. 
leaders to different parts of the territoiy, so 
that they would no longer be able to meet 
together. It was, on the part of the French, 
a cardinal- mistake, \\ hich they will never be 
able to rectify, and may be compared to the 
British attempt to weaken the. power of 
Nkruma's C.P P. by dispersing its leaders in 
similar fashion. For, although ? the leaders 
could not talk to each other, they were indi-
vidually able to make contacts with people in 
all parts of the country, and to spread the 
new concept of nationalism far and wide 
among people who, up to then, had usually 
been thinking in tribal terms. By 1955 it was 
too late to put the clock back ? although, in 
accordance with the national trait of illogi-
cality, this did not prevent the French from 
making a disastrous attempt to do so. Go-
\ crnor Roland Pre was scat from Paris to 
destroy the U.P.C. His first act was to recall 
all the U.P.C. leaders from their scattered 
regions of "exile", and to concentrate them in 
Douala. Thus Moumie was recalled from the 
North, where lie had been performing 
autopsies in his, capacity of doctor, and uniting 
teams of nationalists in his capacity as a poli--

tician, and was assigned to the hospital at 
Douala. The French then began their con-
certed campaign of provocation to persuade 
the people to rebel so that they might instant-
aneously be crushed and charged with "vio-
lence". On a morning in May 1955 when 
breaking point came, Moumie was operating 
in the Douala hospital when men came running 
into the operating theatre and cried out that 
"the war has begun". Despite the confusion, 
and the clamour around him, Moumic never 
forgot that he w as a doctor True to his Hip-
pocratic Oath he continued to operate until 
past midday. Then at 12.30 friends whisked 
him out of the theatre, before the French 
could come to arrest him, changed his clothes, 
put him in a taxi, and got him down to U.P.C. 
1,eadquarters From here he sent telegrams 
to the Governor, and to Soppo Priso. Over 
20,000 people had by this time congregated 
round the U.1) C. offices, and soldiers also 
arrived. "I never saw a scene like it", re-
members Moumie Then he learned that the 
soldiers were coming for him. The people 
were prepared for violence to defend him. 
Moumie then got on the roof of Soppo Priso's 
car and spoke to the people for four hours 
Id, ask them to remain calm. Then word 
came that the French had arrested some 
People and taken them to prison. At this 
news the people broke loose from control, 
they rushed to the prison, and the sound of 
shooting w as heard. A few minutes later 
five corpses were brought into the offices of 
the U I? C. Among them were friends of 
Moumie whom he had last seen only a few 
minutes earlier. "Then", he says, "I unders-
tood that the war had begun". It was decided 
that Urn, the Secreiary-General of the U.P.C., 
should be in charge of external diplomacy, 
Outindie in charge of propaganda, Kingue in 
charge of internal affairs, and Moumie in 
charge of the legal aspects of the struggle. 
They remained in the U P.C. offices for several 
Meepless nights in a state of siege while tte 
French let loose a veritable jacquerie of re-
pression throughout the country. The Came-
roons endured the first of a series of waves 
of French terrorism, with villages burnt, 
arrests, and massacres by troops brought in 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2014/02/06: CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
from other territories. When the U.P.C. head-
quarters w as at last burnt down by the French,. 
the leaders had succeded in escaping ? Urn 
into hiding in the Cameroons, m here he 
remains to this day, and Moumie, disguised, 
to the British Cameroons on the back of a 
motor-bicycle. 
From 1955 to 1957 Mountie remained 
peacefully in the British Cameroons, writing 
legal studies of the question (the French 
banning of the U.P.0.- lacking any legal basis, 
being done under a law inapplicable to the 
colonies, let alone a Trust Territory). Then 
in 1957 the British, who had permitted the 
U P.C. to contest elections, suddenly, ap-
parently as a result of collusion with the 
French, banned the LT l'.C., and, after a few 
embarrassed weeks of keping- the leaders in 
jail, deported them by air to Sudan The 
British official who deported Moumie told 
him, in extreme embarrassment, that it was 
with the greatest regret that he took this 
action. "I have never before been asked to 
do such a thing for my country", he said, "but 
1 am obliged as a VERY ACTIVE DECISION 
has been taken". So the colonial powers sent 
a brilliant young man of 31 -- a skilled surgeon 
and a student of international law ? into exile 
in the Sudan. The exile \-as aft unjust and 
barbaric act. With Moumie NI. as sent his 
f e . His seven-year-old daughter was, how-
ever, left behind. He did not know , until he 
reathedNewYork,who w as looking after her. 
Khartoum is, of course, on the road to 
Cairo. The French, it is reported, are now 
angry with the British for sending Moumie 
into exile. 
Dr. Moumie has been strongly attacked 
by Premier M'Bida of the Cameroons as being 
a Communist ? an actusation that he has 
denied both in 1957 and in 1958, and, indeed, 
at all times. In Cairo and the Middle East 
he has made firm friends with Egyptians and 
Indians, who understand his love of country. 
At the Cairo Conference he was responsible 
for preparing one of the basic papers for 
discussion ? the report on colonialism. Slight 
in build, serious in manner, motivated first, 
last and always by Cameroonian patriotism, 
more will certainly be heard of Dr. Moumie.

ristration, formed a mighty State : the Mali 
Empire. The emperor was so rich and 
sumptuous that Alexandria gold rates fell 
drastically when he visited that city in the 13th 
cen tury. 
At. this period of time all the African 
peoples, with the exception of the Boschimens, 
knew how to use iron. They even possessed 
crucible furnaces, in which iron was extracted 
directly from the ore. 
The Benin gulf remains famous for its 
remarkable bronze sculptures, dating from the 
15th and 16th centuries. 
Indeed, as Paul Valery NN rote, "we of other 
civilisations know now that we are mortal". 
But why did many African civilisations die ? 
Why were so many others not able to further 
their normal development ? Is it not mostly 
due to European intervention ? Can one deny 
that in destroying the tow n of Benin the 
British bombers destroyed artistic treasures 
and thwarted an original, material evolution ? 
In 1916, French imperialists moved into the 
Kamerun. They found there, among other 
creations of the Kamcrunian genius, a script 
invented by King Njoya and taught ai the lime 
in the schools of the country. Acting like 
,,orthy descendants of the Vandals and the 
Goths, they closed_ all these schools and 
torbade the teaching of this writing, unique 
among others. 
Like w ise, King Njoya's head printer had 
invented a maize mill ; also, through ob-
:-ervation of the Haoussa weavers, he succedcd 
i. introducing the pedal loom to the handi-
craftsmen of Foumban. Unfortunately, less 
than two years after the arrival of the French 
imperialists, all these innovations were relegat-
ed to museums, banned, and infringements to 
this ban carried extremely severe sanctions. 
So they say they came to civilise us, these 
obscurantists, these birds of prey, these man-
hunters ! For countless centuries, they wrested 
off Africa more than 150 million of its children,

Memorandum Submitted To The United Nations 
Visiting Mission By The Union Of The Peoples 
Of The Cameroons 
The U. N. Mission visited Cameroon in 
lucidly explains Kamerun's case for freedom. 
According to the terms of Resolution 1907 
(XXII) of the Trusteeship Council, your 
mission has been appointed, firstly, "to inves-
tigate and report as fully as possible on the 
steps taken in the t o above-mentioned Trust 
Territories tow ards the realization of the 
objective set forth in Article 76 b of the 
Charter, taking into account the terms of Ge-
neral Assembly resolution 321 (IV) of 15 
November 1949 and other rele?ant General 
Assembly resolutions ; 
"2. to give attention, as may be appro-
priate in the light of discussions in the 
Trusteeship Council and the General Assembly, 
and of resolutions adopted by them, to issues 
raised in connexion with the annual reports 
on the administration of the two Trust Terri-
tories- concerned, in petitions received by the 
Trusteeship Council relating to the Territories, 
in hearings in the General Assembly of peti-
tioners from the Territories, in the reports of 
the previous periodic Visiting Missions to the 
Territories and ir,. the observations of the 
Administering Authorities on those reports , 
"3. to receive petitions, ,N about prejudice 
to its acting in accordance w ith the rules of 
procedure of the Council, and to investigate 
on the spot, after consultation with the local 
representative of the Administering Authority 
concerned, such of the petitions received as, 
in its opinion, warrant special in\ estigation". 
This is a most important mandate, and on 
its results depend 
a) The lives of 5 million inhabitants of the 
Cameroons under United Nations trusteeship, 
entrusted to the administration of France and 
Great Britain ; 
b) The U.N.'s prestige ; 
c) The confidence which has been placed 
in the U.N. for the preservation and streng-

limning of peace and security, and especially 
in view of the importance accorded by the 
U.N. to the right of peoples to self-determi-
nation. 
This is a case for conscience, but it also 
entails either respect or utter disregard for 
the terms of the Charter. 
A. The right to petition, as understood by 
the Administering Authorities and as stipulat-
ed in Article 87 of the Charter. 
We are glad to note that the Mandate 
(paragraph 2) of the Visiting Mission directs 
it "to give attention.., to issues raised in con-
nexion with the annual reports of the admi-
nistration of the two Trust Territories con-
cerned, in petitions received by the Trustee-
ship Council relating to the Territories, in 
hearings in the General Assembly of petitioners 
from the Territories, ...etc". 
After certain delays, it is true, the 
'1 rustecship Council has authorized explicitly 
its Mission to take into account all petitions, 
including those submitted by the U.P.C., and 
to report on them to that Council. 
It could not be otherwise, since, according 
to the terms of the Charter (Chapter XIII) 
;=nd resolution 1211 (XII) of the General 
Assembly of the U.N , supreme authority in 
trusteeship matters is not vested in the 
Trusteeship Council or the Administrating 
Powers, but in the General Assembly itself, 
which does not recognize the ban placed arbi-
trarily on the U.P.C. and other organizations 
which have met the same fate. 
We believe, therefore, that you will take 
into account the care which the General 
Assembly and the Trusteeship Council have 
taken to receive all Cameroonians' views on 
their fate and that, before leaving, you will 
receic c all the petitions and all the petitioners

who may come to you, without excluding any 
individual or organization due solely to the 
fact that they are displeasing to the Admi-
nistering Authorities. 
We know that it is the intention of the 
Administering Authorities to press for a 
renewal of the partisan position taken by the 
1955 Mission. But we also know that in view 
of the reaction of world opinion on this po-
sition, and in view of the respect which you 
have for the Charter by virtue of which you 
are travelling to our country, your Mission will 
not allow itself to bow to the injunctions and 
the whims of the Administering Authorities. 
B. Resolution 1211 (XII) of 13 December 
1957. 
The 12th Session of the General Assembly 
? one might even say at the instance and 
with the support of the Administering Autho-
rities ? adopted resolution 1211 (XII) re-
questing these powers to re-establish a normal 
political life in the Cameroons, according to 
a series of measures enumerated during the 
debates, and which we shall merely mention 
here : 
1. The withdrawal of foreign troops from 
the Cameroons ; 
2. The reestablishment of all dissolved 
political parties, i.e., the U.P.C. the u.D.E.F. 
E.C. and the J.D.C. 
3. The restoration of all political liberties, 
particularly those of assembly, expression, 
association, etc. 
4. A total and unconditional amnesty for 
bet8 of a political nature penalized or pro-
secuted since 1955, as well as the return of 
deportees and political exiles ; and 
S. Lastly, as a natural corrolary expressly 
provided for in paragraph 5 of that resolution, 
"the realization in both Territories of the 
final objectives of the Trusteeship system, in 
accordance with the free expression of the 
wishes of the populations concerned, taking 
into account any alternative relative to their 
future status". 
Although the representatives of Prance 
and Great Britain also voted for this reso-
lution, it is precisely the opposite policy that 
they have pursued. Anyone may judge this 
from these facts, chosen among thousands : 
1. Anyone may read in "Le Monde" of 
22 No ember 1937 that the Franco-Cameroons 
Government enacted the following measures : 
"regrouping of villages, prohibition against 
travelling at night, suppression of common 
markets and transportation. These measures, 
moreover, do not preclude direct action against 
the agitators of the Union of the peoples of 
the Cameroons". We may note that decisions 
so harmful to political liberty are taken solely 
by the French Parliament. However, the 
Government has allowed itself to promulgate 
them by simple decree, and this in a territory 
under international trusteeship. At present, 
Sanaga-Maritime, there are mushroom 
villages formed by the forcible regrouping of 
from five to ten villages or rural centers. 
These villages are surrounded by palisades 
from 6 to 8 meters high, topped by posted 
sentries. At the slightest motion of a shadow 
outside the palisade these alert the soldiers 
who open fire without warning and without 
mercy. We may easily imagine the tragic 
consequences of such a regime in a region 
where the populations live in scattered hamlets 
tar removed from their fields. The Authorities 
have had to set up convoys to allow their 
prisoners to obtain supplies from the fields 
once every month. Outside of these move-
ments, all interned persons found absent ard 
treated as rebels. This regime, applied iri 
Malaya and Kenya, is thus a regime of exter-
mination by starvation, and also by assassi-
nation. POr the population, in its Overwhelm-
ing majority, has refused to leave its villages, 
2 Already at the time of the 12th Session 
of the General Assembly, the French Govern-
ment boasted of having sent troop reinforce-
ments to massacre the people of the Carrie-
roons under international trusteeship. Since 
that time, Radio-Brazzaville announced, on 
May 6, that neW reinforcements sent from 
Ubangi, Lake Chad and the Middle Ccingti 
Were on their Way to the Canieroons to sub., 
jugate the U P.C. registande movement in 
Sanaga-Maritime and in the western part of 
the country. Presently, besides the consi-
derably increased forces of the police and the 
gendarmerie, 60,000 soldiers of the French. 
army are carrying out operations in the Cal. 
;Jan. 1959 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 13 
mcroons, as against 2,000 in normal times. 
Congratulating himself on this intensification 
of the war, the so-called head of the Came-
roons Government stated, on 20 June, 1958 ? 
"The Government and the French Authorities 
are sparing no effort to allow the restoration 
of calm in the country". The "Presse du Came-
roun", a colonialists' newspaper which related 
this item (issue of June 21 and 22), added 
that a "U.P.C. general Fanjock Isaac Nyobe, 
was killed near Makak", without mentioning 
a word about the resolution of the General 
Assembly of the United Nations quoted above. 
3. This solidarity between the colonialists 
(Ion not cease to operate fully against the 
Cameroons patriots. Thus, last May 24, the 
British security forces massacred Came-
roonians in the Eastern zone who, in order to 
visit brothers in the Western zone, had taken 
a trail which is not ordinarily in use. This is 
because, since December, the borders of our 
country, down to the slightest trails, are 
guarded by the military. The State under 
trusteeship has even passed a law authorizing 
customs inspectors to bear arms while on duty. 
In support of this pretended law's proponent, 
one of the so-called ministers added that it is 
in effect, the regularization of an already 
----tic?complished fact (Cf. "La Presse du Came-
roun", issue of 18 June 1958). 
4. Another example of the solidarity 
between the imperialists in their disregard for 
their most solemn commitments resides in the 
arrests and arbitrary detentions, both in the 
western and the eastern zones. The British 
Government has pushed its inhumanity to the 
point of turning over Cameroonians placed 
under its administration to the French Autho-
rities, such as Degrando and Ebode Engelbert. 
For the record, here is the expulsion order 
sent to each of these patriots : "The Nati \ e 
Authority of Rumba, in conformity with the 
powers vested in all Native Authorities by 
Section 29 of Chapter 140 of Nigerian Law, 
does order you, Mr. Ebode, who, although 
subject to our jurisdiction, are a nember of 
the Native Community. to leave the sector 
placed under the jurisdiction of the Kumba 
Authority within 40 days, unless within that 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/02/06: CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
time you submit proof that your means and 
your work allow you to live decently, you and 
your family". 
This expulsion order calls for many 
remarks. First, it is based on a Nigerian Law. 
This reference, therefore, testifies to inte-
grationalist designs contrary to the Trustee-
ship Agreements. This expulsion order also 
constitutes a violation of the Charter of the 
United Nations, whose Articles 73 and 76 b 
require that the Administering Powers conform 
to the paramount interests and the freely 
expressed aspirations of the natives. Now, in 
this instance, the latter intend to reside in 
Rumba, or, more generally, in the Western 
Cameroons. To expel them from there is 
again a violation of the Universal Declaration 
of Huuman Rights which recognizes every 
man's right to choose his residence freely 
within any State, and especially in his own 
country, particularly if he is a member of the 
native community, as the expulsion order itself 
recognizes. Thus, legally, it is entirely un-
warranted. Its authors insinuate that it is 
justified due to failure to carry on lawful 
work. This condition is absolutely inadmissible, 
since this would allow any country td export 
to its neighbours its own unemployed workers 
or those citizens who are incapable of earning 
a decent living. Let us look further into this 
inhuman and irrational viewpoint of the im-
perialists. In order for them validly to justify 
this expulsion, they must first prove that actual 
possibilities for decent work exist within their 
borders for all citizens without exception, and, 
further, that the victims of these expulsions 
do not have honest or sufficient means of 
existence. Now, in this case, the imperialists 
cannot furnish this twofold proof The entire 
Cameroons remains an under-developed 
country, tv h er e, by definition, un-employment 
is rife. Also, because it is under foreign do-
mination, its inhabitants suffer from racial 
discrimination. This double evil of unemploy-
ment from under-development and racial dis-
crimination is even more pronounced in the 
Western zone under British administration 
than in the Eastern zone under French admi-
ristration

AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 
The United Nations themselves have 
pointed this out on seVeral occasions. How, 
then, can the English authorities validly rc. 
proach the natives with not having work ? 
Even more, despite this general situation, the 
victims of expulsion whose names have reached 
us up to now , i.e., Ebode Engclbert, Ewondjo 
Dcgrando and his companions expelled from 
Tombel on June 9 last, all these patriots 
are perfectly in order 'even with the Ni 
gcrian Law which has been wrongfully applied 
in the Cameroons. This is proven by the fact 
that they have all regularly paid their taxes 
to date, and some of them have done so for 
many years. They are among the most 
influential members of the native community. 
Thus, their expulsion can be justified neither 
by facts nor by law. On what is it ultimately 
based ? On political motives only. During a 
contradictory public lecture, Mr. Endeley, the 
lecturer, was reduced to stuttering and 
stammering by the questions and arguments 
advanced by Ebodc Engelbert and other 
Fatriots. The so-called prime minister could 
not bear such a defeat ; rather, he built it up 
into a treasonable crime and, abruptly ending 
the lecture, he immediately sent expulsion 
orders to these patriots, giving them not 40 
days as provides the already unjust law, but 
only 15 days. This is how the United Nations 
Charter, the Trusteeship Agreement and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights are 
disregarded ,by these puppets who, never-
theless, pretend that in this way they are 
struggling for the reunification and inde-
pendence of the Cameroons. 
5. The British Government is all the more 
guilty in allowing these exp-ilsions to take 
place, since': 
a) They cause numerous Nigerians, who 
are accorded more rights than the natives, to 
pour into the Cameroons ; 
b) The patriots turned over to the French 
Authorities are subjected to a particularly 
inhuman treatment. First, they are herded 
together and ill fed in unsanitary prisons, 
which are more densely populated than the 
" 
On 19 July 1958, in Stockholm, Mr Jacques 
Ngom admitted that the concentration camps 
Jan. 1959 
alone contained at that time 50,000 patriots 
cut of the 3,000,000 inhabitants listed in the 
census for the Eastern Cameroons. At present, 
the prisons are even more numerous than the 
concentration camps, there being at least one 
for each administrative post (sub-regional or 
regional center) and even for the conformist 
districts. This is how these prisons are filled 
with victims delivered by the English. Since 
19 February 1955, a decree of the governor 
I.as granted all authorities the right to arrest, 
detain or incarcerate all persons deemed 
suspect. The homes of these prisoners, exiles 
and resistance members are encircled at night. 
Other homes are set afire, with women and 
children in them, and yet others are broken 
down with trucks or tractor, like that of 
Njebet jean-Claude in Doula New-Bell. After 
such operations, they dare arrest all homeless 
persons as vagrants and evil-doers. All these 
arbitrarily and brutally arrested persons are 
subjected to a veritable regime of hard labour. 
Thus the populations of the Bambini. Sector 
are forced, under the gun-butts of the soldiers, 
to construct roads to facilitate troop move-
ments, particularly the roads of Ngambc, Man-
ngombe, Ndom, Ndog-Mbock, Basso-Balikol, 
Nkonkwalla, Log-Noug, Ibong, Bisseng, 
Bongan and I3afia. Many die from these 
ordeals, especially since the hard labour is 
accompanied by different tortures. 
When a person is arrested, an electric 
current is attached to his genitals and his ears, 
to force him to inform against the resistance 
members. Other detainees arc placed on 
screens above lighted fireplaces. Yet other 
have their limbs attached to a rope, the other 
end of which is tied to a ram At very brief 
intervals, the soldiers hit the ram to make it 
run, thus quartering their victims. 
These masters of civilization of the Franco-
African community have just invented another 
particularly odious torture, the pit-torture. 
Large pits have been dug, particularly at Nom 
and Boon-Djock. In those at Nom, 'suspects" 
are confined alive, then covered by metal 
sheets on top of which are lighted fires. After 
a certain time has elapsed, the pit is uncovered 
and the bodies are taken out. If there arc 
any survivors, they are interrogated to force

At Boon-Djock, the pits which have been dug 
are filled with water, and the arrested patriots 
have a rubber strip wound about their chests 
and arc thrown in, with only their heads 
remaining above water. Some of them are 
taken up dead. As for the more resistant ones, 
they are subjected to interrogation on the 
location and the movements of the resistance. 
This is the "civilizing" and "humanitarian" 
work which France is accomplishing in the 
Cameroons under international trusteeship. 
This is the "liberalism" of the Ahidjo Govern-
ment, and its desire to come to an understand-
mg with the U These are facts which we 
ask to be t erified on the spot by all observers 
who are even the slightest bit objective, and 
particularly by those appointed by the United 
Nations. 
6. As a consequence of this military si-
tuation and the inhuman treatment meted out 
in the various places of detention. civilians 
can no longer find room in the public hospitals 
. of the principal tow ns in the South, Yaounde, 
Douala, Ebolow a, Nkongsamba, Dschang-, etc. 
The "Presse du Cameroun" quoted above, 
relates in its issue. of June 13, 1958, that the 
soldiers themselt es hate been obliged to place 
several ambulances at the disposal of the po-
pulation 
7. As for the number of dead, it is difficult 
for us to imagine it. Many perish from being-
shot, other following the ordeals and the hard 
labour, and some, finally are deported to 
unknown destinations and are sometimes found 
floating in watercourses As a single example, 
I.ake Yaounde was recently drained by order 
of the Government. In its bed were found 
upwards of 600 skulls. 
S. Not content with carrying out arbitrary 
police and judicial action and military terror, 
and dealing death themselves, the Authorities 
also allow some of their lackeys to organize 
bloody gangsterism. The former "government 
head". Mr 2tIbida, publicly stated (Cf. Journal 
of Debates of the Legislatit e Assembly of the 
Cameroons, February 1957), that his accom-
plices in the I.-cfrisla.tit. e Assembly are armed 
Moreover, "Le Monde" of 17 July. 1958, 
informs us that this former prime minister 
15 
caused a poor, aged and defenceless citizen 
to be beaten to death by his hired killers. Mr. 
Mbida was ready to slaughter others when 
the police intervened. Despite his flagrant 
crimes, Mbida and his henchmen were let 
free. This encouraged them to pillage markets 
and perpetrate other attempted murders. Flow 
can the Authorities ensure order when their 
own agents loot and burn even more furiously 
than the private mercenaries, and when the 
Government itself distributes uniforms, arms 
and ammunition to private individuals, asking 
them to set up groups for "self-defense" ? 
9. This was the situation before the arrival 
to power of General de Gaulle. Despite the 
liberalism which some observers seek to find 
in his African policies, he has only aggravated 
this very alarming state of affairs. This is 
supported by these few facts : Last July 11, 
some patriots were able to photograph, at 
their own risk, tanks and armored cars sent 
by de Gaulle to the combat zones, particularly 
in Sanaga-Maritime. Copies of these photos 
have been sent to the U.N. Secretariat by our 
central office in Cairo. 
Since September, a state of emergency 
pre% ails in the Western part of the country 
(Mungo and Bamileke region). Finally, 
he radio and tarious agencies have 
recently announced a ast encircling and 
"pacification" operation during which the Se-
cretary General of the U.11 C. is reported to 
have been killed. This is an absolutely odious 
murder. Either France recognizes that it is 
in a state of tvar against the pe.ople of the 
Cameroons. in which case we cannot but be 
indignant that the French troops have killed 
a leader, instead of keeping him alit c after 
his "capture" as required by international law ; 
el else the French Got ernment refuses to 
admit that it has unleashed a colonial war in 
our country ; in which case, how can we 
explain these "pacification" operations, and 
these reinforcements of troops and arms ? The 
French colonialists themselves speak of the 
people rallying. This is absolutely fictitious, 
of course as in Algeria, but'a is still significant 
for the real situation in the Cameroons. 
Objectively, unfortunately, we must note that, 
for the first time in history, a colonial war is

unfolding in a Territory under international 
trusteeship. And if, so far as we know, the 
French Government is not using against us 
modern means of extermination, it is sparing 
neither its mercenaries, known as "Senegalese 
Rifles", nor its military equipment. Thus, for 
the past three years, Sanaga-Maritime has 
acquired more roads than in 0 years, solely 
to facilitate troop movements. The radio has 
.also been mobilized to the utmost, with 
frequent special broadcasts beamed at Douala, 
Yaounde and Garoua in order to demoralize 
the population by false reports, while cons-
tantly attacking the patriots. 
We must emphasize that this technique 
is in no way different from that developed by 
Colonel Lacheroy, one of the factious soldiers 
of Algiers. He recommended a three-fold 
action : taking up arms, a fictitious rallying 
of the population, and especially an extensive 
radio campaign against independence. Thus 
the funds collected from the Cameroonian tax-
payers go far more towards a war budget than 
the development of their country. We cannot 
hit question the legality of this public campaign 
in' a Trust Territory whose, very status calls 
for national independence. The Administering 
Authorities are bolstering their open campaign 
with a ,merciless struggle against any mani-
festation of non-conformist political opinions.

condemning to heavy sentences 
any persons possessing or distributing publi-
cations of the U.P.C. Such a decision violates 
both freedom of expression and the internal 
jurisdictional structure, since only a judicial 
Jan. 1959 
authority may decree such severe penalties. 
This clearly reveals the colonialists' firm de-
termination to oppose our aspirations. This 
firm determination has also been concretized 
by the explusion of numerous attorneys from 
the Cameroons, or the refusal to issue them 
a visa permitting them to defend their clients. 
How can an impartial system of justice thus 
deprive the defense of all its legal safeguards ? 
The truth of ? the matter is that colonialist 
justice is becoming increasingly summary and 
partial, since the magistrates requested and 
obtained, in December 1957, the right to take 
into consideration nothing beyond the defense 
of the regime. They have again recently 
condemned to death numerous patriots accused 
of the murder of Delangue, although to date 
the Authorities have declared that no one was 
arrested for his assassination ; meanwhile, we 
see a former "prime minister" murdering his 
fellow-citizens with impunity. The British 
Government is also resolutely engaged along 
the same path. At the beginning of this 
month, it had a number of patriots arrested 
at night. Although most of them were mi-
htants in a legal organization, "One. Came-
roons", they ne ertheless received heavy 
sentences. 
C. The assassination of Ruben Nyobe, Se-
cretary General of the U.P.C. 
With fanfares and with rejoicing, the 
French Authorities announced that, on 13 
September, 1958, they "stuck down:' Mr. Ruben 
Um Nyobe, Secretary General of the U.P.C. 
We do not intend to confirm or to deny 
this report. We merely wish to draw certain 
conclusions, in case it should be true. 
1. As we pointed out above, this is a unique 
act in the history of the international trustee-
ship system : the extermination of political 
leaders so as to leave, as negotiators, only 
Jan. 199 
AFRO-ASIAN 13tILLtTIN 
those who agree, the lackeys of the Admi-
nistering Powers, w ith the tacit blessings of 
the U.N. 
2. After the set-backs in Togoland. where 
the "minority" became a majority, France 
thinks that she can avoid, by the assassination 
of Ruben Urn Nyobc, the whole problem of 
the Cameroons. Those masquerading behind 
such a manceuvre must know that "you cannot 
kill an idea with bullets" (said by Sou.stelle 
after the attempt on his life). 
3. France thereby recognizes the frauds 
instituted in the elections which she organized 
on 23 December, 1956, and the puppet nature 
of the institutions resulting therefrom. All 
the Cameroonian petitioners who appeared 
before the General Assembly and the Trustee-
ship Council after these elections were un-
animous in objecting to the non-representative 
character of the so-called Legislative Assembly 
of the Cameroons. 
4. By this dishonest method, France 
believes that she can impose a "choice" for 
a "community of free peoples" and "Beni Oui-
Oui" spokesmen upon the Cameroonians. This 
was revealed to us by a Tunisian newspaper. 
"La Presse", on the day following the re-
ferendum of 28 September, 1958. Speaking 
of the choice made by Guinea, this newspaper 
t,sserted that "France will find in the Came-
roons and the Ivory Coast the agricultural 
products which she will lose in Guinea upon 
the latter's independence". More clearly ex-
pressed, this means that France has decided 
to remain in the Cameroons, even by the use 
Of force. 
5. It is normal for all these measures td 
have been cunningly worked out between 
France and Great Britain so as to avoid the 
attainment of our national objectives, im= 
mediate unification and independence. This 
ti'as revealed to us by the Delegate of New 
Zealand during the 21st Session of the Trustee-
ship Council. He stated : "... it was difficult 
to conceive for this Territory ? Western 
Cameroons a future which is not linked to 
that of the great neighbouring Iserritory". 
(Report of the Trusteeship Council, Volume II, 
Doc. 4/A/3822, p. 75, paragraph 55). This is 
why we agree with the Representative of 
Burma in supposing that the Administering 
Authorities "in the execution of a large-scale 
plan, had already succeded in destroying the 
unity of the Cameroons, parcelling out this 
solid national entity, and having the Territory 
absorbed into the Nigerian Federation and 
the French Union", newly baptized under the 
designation "community of free peoples". 
D. What do we propose? 
1. We believe that your Mission should 
visa ah the places to which its attention is 
drawn by the natives : the prison-tombs, the 
concentration camps, the watercourses into 
which the Franco-British soldiery throw the 
patriots bodies. 
2. It should, further, receive all petitions 
and all petioners, not only without discrani-
nation, but also without the presence of the 
official authorities. 
Without these two conditions, a United 
Nations Mission Nt;o u Id be absolutely useless, 
for the reports furnished directly by thci 
Administering Authorities to the U.N. containi 
the information which a Mission would gather 
which did not take these two considations intO 
ccount.

Jan. 1959 
British Imperialist Lie Exposed ? 
DECLARATION BY THE NIGERIAN DELEGATES TO THE ALL AFRICAN PEOPLES' 
CONFERENCE ON ICAMERUN, AND A CALL BY THE SAID DELEGATES ON THE 
NIGERIAN PEOPLE TO VIEW WITH CONCERN THE SLANDER DIRECTED 
TOWARDS NIGERIA BY THE COLONIAL POWERS ADMINISTERING KAMERUN 
In the United Nations and everywhere 
else, British representatives state that it is we 
in Nigeria who do not appreciate and who 
combat our brothers of Kamerun struggling 
for the reunification and independence of their 
country. This campaign which presents us as 
African imperialists desiring the annexation of 
Kamerun, is dangerous and likely to sow arti-
ficial discord between the friendly peoples of 
Nigeria and Kamerun. 
We the undersigned, representing the 
undermentioned Nigerian delegations at the 
All, African People's Conference, wish to 
express our concern over thern growing im-
pression of Nigerian complicity in the vic-
timization of Kamerun nationalists, and Ka-
merun progressive Organisations. 
Here in this grand meeting of African 
peoples for solidarity in the struggle for 
freedom and national sovereignity, we wish 
to assure Kamerun delegates at the Con-
ference, and all Kamerunians at home : 
a) that we believe in Nigeria having a 
strong, viable and friendly nation as 
her neighbour 
b) that to that end we support the 
struggle of Kamerun people for unity 
and independence 
c) that we regret the dissolution of Ka-
merun progressive organisations and 
the deportation of their leaders, es-
pecially as the impression has been 
created that Nigeria has been res-
ponsibIc for this when we are not yet 
in control of foreign policy, and 
d) that believing in African solidaritywe 
do not appreciate that these people 
are up to now still barred from 
entering Nigeria and seeking moral 
and material aid for their struggle 
against colonialism and imperialism. 
We wish further to state that we wish the 
Kamerun problem to be democratically 
resolved by a popular referendum organised 
mid supervised by a Commission of the United 
Nations General Assembly at the same time 
in all the whole country as was the case in 
Togoland ? which, was admitted by the United 
Kingdom representative at the United Nations 
himself. 
We are subscribing to the resolution of the 
Conference to the effect that Fcbryary 20th, 
1959, be declared all over Africa as "Kamerun 
Day", and wish that on that day, when a 
special United Nations General Assembly 
Session is meeting to discuss the Kamerun 
problem, all organisations in Nigeria as every-
where else in Africa, express their solidarity 
with Kamerun people by 
a) sending messages and memorandums 
to the Assembly 
b) organizing demonstrations and giving 
press and radio publicity to the 
problem with a view to mobilizing 
world opinion towards an equitable 
settlement 
c) protesting against the employment 
of Nigerian police and armed forces 
for the express purpose of supressing 
genuine Kamerun nationalism, and 
d) allowing Kamerunians free access to 
all sections of the territory admi-
nistered as part of the Federation 
during the referendum campaigns.

calling them by a cry much significant ap-
pellation : "pieces of ebony" ! ! There you 
have the crux of their civilisation ? to trans-
form us into objects, into instruments of pro-
duction . Whereas we, thousands of years 
before them, w ere creating civilisation... It 
was unfortunate that we lost our technical 
start over them but \\ e remain trustees of 
human qualities which have long deserted 
their cities ? hospitality, solidarity, acceptance 
of all that is human and a tangible contempt 
for their god : Money. 
The technical start .. we can catch up w ith 
that, but on one condition only that w c regain 
mastery of our destinies "If the Europeans 
go, the Suez Canal will fill up with sand", said 
they three years ago. Yet, now that the 
Egyptian Government and the Egyptian people 
ha x e taken over their canal, does it not work 
better ? 
What Africans need is, above all, liberty, 
national independence. They can master even 
the most complex modern techniques. I shall 
'cite only the example of the Kamerunian ba-
nana growers Here is how the "Union Fran-
caise" review paid homage to the growers in 
its issue of July 2, 1953 : "The African banana 
production is a recent thing, subsequent to 
1946. Until then one had thought that the 
'hazards of the market would discourage the 
African grow crs producers w ere content to sell 
to their European neighbours. But for many 
years now, the small planter has adapted him-
self : grouped into syndicates, the farmers arc 
.developing their sales. in 1947, 438 tons, in 1951, 
16.700 tons, and thus the planters, from 13.8 
per cent, reach 34 per cent of the total 
tonnage". Today, they have overshot by far 
the 67 per cent mark in banana exports, 
although they themselves consume a good part 
of their production Imperialists must, then, 
in all good faith, evacuate immediately our 
.country . "their mission" has ne? er been a 
-cultural one or one of collective well-being : 
it has always been and always will be a 
"mission" of plunder. 
The Kamerunian pre-colonial economy 
They have been in the Kamerun for sixty 
years. Not only have they thwarted our Cul-
tural and technical et olution, but also they 
ha % c completely disorganised our economic 
system, and, in doing so, have not et en bother-
ed to replace it by another, at least likely to 
satisfy our ever-growing needs. Far be it from 
my thoughts to exalt and praise to high heaven 
the African pre-colonial economy. 1-laying been 
founded on a basis now obsolete, it could not. 
answer the needs of the sputnik era. But one 
must at least recognise its existence : it is not 
the imperialists who brought Us a sound eco-
nomic system. We had some agricultural 
techniques which can still be well used : 
terrace growing, alternating of the culture of 
shallow-root plants with that of tap-root 
plants, aeration and fertilisation of the soil by 
such processes as ridge-plantation, vegetable 
and even animal manure. "Fertilisers soften 
the earth, strengthen it, are pleasant", said 
humourously the Ndikis of northern Kamerun. 
The eminent geographer, Ch. Roquebain, 
notes ? "In the mountains of Manda, in the 
south of Tchad, the peasant tries his best to 
limit the ra% ages of soil erosion : he carves 
terraces on to slopes, holds them up by walls 
made of dry stones, grows supurges and gra-
mineous plants on the borders Work on the 
soil is performed as near as possible to sowing 
time ; the earth is mellowed over the whole 
of its surface only at the time of weeding, 
when the young plants, already tall, can defend 
it agains water-rills". It even seems that our 
peasants used processes of multiplication and 
cross-breeding of species ? Prof. Portcres 
counted more than 37 \ arieties of rice on the 
border of the savannah and the forest. The 
Ndikis of northern Kamerun knew of 45 
varieties of yams ; today even, inhabitants of 
the forest grow 12 varieties of yams, one of 
which originated in Indo-Malaya. This small 
detail stresses the age of Afro-Asian exchanges. 
Moreover, the fact that the most important 
exported African cultures originated abroad

Jan. 1959' 
(cocoa, coffee, etc.) show to what extent the 
African peasant welcomes progress. 
I shallnot extoll upon the iron industries, 
those of the bronze, copper, gold, etc. In fact, 
it is useless to try and knock down an open 
door : powerful populated centres like those 
of Yaounde, Maroua, or that of the Bamileke 
region (150--400 inhabitants to the square km.) 
disposed of techniques allowing for an im-
portant volume of production. In spite of the 
precariousness of means of communications, 
our big centres of economy entertained 
t clations with each other and with the world 
abroad, mainly the Mediterranean world. We 
1-ad our money, our positions in commerce and 
trade. Concluding a study of family budgets, 
idministrator Binet wrote of our country 
that "it possesses traditions and an indigenous 
commercial organisation". Markets, which are 
deeply imbedded in the customs, are numerous 
there, and very frequented. 
Some means of plundering 
The economic system which enabled our 
ancestors to live gave way 70 years ago to 
another system destined to further enslave our 
Country for the benefit of the imperialists, 
without, however, raising our living standards 
and enabling us to catch up with our technical 
delay. Agriculture has been almost entirely 
dismantled. First, the colonialists took our 
best land-plots. Permits for exploitation and 
cultivation covered 230,000 hectares in 1946 
and two 'million hectares in 1956, equal to an 
increase of 860% over a period of ten years, 
solely in Eastern Kamerun. Peasants are 
forced to work hard on the remaining lands 
in order to pay heavy taxes and cover ever-
increasing- needs In the already-mentioned 
study, administrator Binet wrote : "Pro-
portionally, fiscal taxation is much harder on 
the poor", that is to say on the Africans. 
Example : 21 per cent of the FOB price of 
cocoa goes to taxes ; cocoa, the main product 
exported by the country, is entirely in the 
hands of the autochtones. On the other hand, 
the assessments of tax on 'mentioned state-
ments of affairs amount only to 2%. 
In general, indirect taxation ? which, 
weighs more upon the mass of African con-
sumers - - is much heavier than direct taxation 
of a personal character. To fiscal taxations, 
can be added the high prices of the franc 
zone. Mr. Pierre Moussa, Director of Eco-
nomic Affairs at the Colonial Ministry in Paris,. 
admits that the African peasants pay their 
free-traders additional costs amounting to three 
per cent over their incomes. According to his 
own examples, products coming from France 
are taxed in the Kamcrun in noticable pro-
portions as compared with world rates : 23 
per cent. for cotton cloth, 25 per cent for 
machines and instruments as well as for wines, 
30 per cent. for vehicles, 60 per cent, for 
products of milk, 85 per cent, for sugar, etc. 
On the other hand, Kamerumans only 
charge a diminishing part on the price of their 
products. 
Here are some statistics to shon the' 
changes in the producer's share through the 
years 1938-52 : 
Product 
1938 
1952 
Nuts 
53 % 
54% 
Palmyras 
61 % 
44% 
Cocoa 
55 % 
4 0 % 
Coffee 
SI % 
65% 
Since 1953, this tendency must have been, 
accentuated, at least by reason of the heavier 
and heavier taxation of the autochtones. 
this must be added the fact that between 1938: 
and 1951 France's share in imports from 
Eastern Kamcrun jumped from 30% to 77 7%, 
and that of exports to the Kamerun from ' 
56.4% to 63 5%. 
One has a clearer idea, then, of how much 
these unequal exchanges cost the Kamerunian 
people. 
Low salaries is another factor to be added 
to the principal means of plundering the 
a'utochtonous masses, the others being, as we 
have already shown, theft of land, unjust 
taxation, unfair exchanges... A Governor's. 
decree of January 5, 1956, brought into being 
nine classes of salaries. For agricultural work,. 
the hourly pay varies from 12 to 38 French. 
Jan. 1959 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 21 
francs, and for other work from 14 to, 38 
francs..in fact, this hourly pay is thcoritical 
rather than effective, for the administration 
constantly supports the employers Were this 
pay even effective, it would only amount to a 
salary of misery it is, to the N% orker, the 
cnly means by which he can pay taxes, medical 
care, school fees, and is all that he has to 
support, apart from himself, a wife, children, 
his parents and many other rclati \ es. 
Actually, unemployment is a permanent 
and acute problem in the Kamerunian eco-
nomy ? the authorities themselves listed 25 
per cent of the inhabitants of Douala (about 
200,000 inhabitants) as permanently unemploy-
ed. Naturally, all these workless people live 
off the income of their parents and friends. 
This income, to say the least, is ri-
diculous for craftsmen and food-stuffs pro-
ducers as well as for employees and exporters 
Crafstmanship has been completely ruined by 
the competition of Franco-British imports. 
The authorities make no bones about this. 
Thus, administrator Gmllou \\ rote on the 
subject in "Revue Etudes Camerumoses", 
Nos. 31-32, 1950, p 207 "The iron industry 
in the subdivision of Babimbi used to be in 
force over the whole territory :it is gradually 
disappearing- The case with n hich the natives 
can obtain imported articles is the cause of 
this : actually, they find tools of a superior 
quality cheaper. However, there remain in the 
region of Babimbi 111 three founderies " 
The agriculture or edibles for inland con-
sumption is submitted to the same fate as that 
of traditional industry, although, it is true, on 
a slower pace, which is due to a fundamental 
difference : the necessity of having, while 
hampered with a technique of weak production, 
cultures of exportation in order to get indis-
pensable currency Thus, statistics show that 
between 1949 and 1955, areas given to cultures 
of exportation augmented by 12% . however, 
those areas de \ oted to agriculture of plants 
for inner consumption have diminished by 8% 
and production by 4%. 
One understands, then, why an essentially 
agricultural country like the Kamcrun is forced 
to import more than IQ% of its food-stuffs. 
And at what prices ! Even for egsentials, that 
is those which will enable the autochtones to 
exist, they have to use credit ? many of them 
must sell their harvests before they are 
reaped : and, of course, at the price of the 
money-lender. 
Unusually high interest on loans and 
purchase prices maintain the heavy majority 
of the autochtones population in misery. One 
can judge for oneself by the living conditions 
in the economic capital of the country, Douala. 
"Figaro". the ultra-reactionary new spaper of 
Paris described the native quarter of that?town 
the following terms : "Imagine a heap of 
rotten straw-huts, barracks made of torchi-
wood, wooden shacks leaning one upon another. 
There are no streets, or even paths. As soon 
as one leaves the tarmac road which cuts in 
o this prodigious heap of rubbish, one must 
go through sodden shacks, and make one's 
nay betn cen crumbling walls, cross streams 
of excreta, an aken sleeping bodies, stride ov er 
children..." ("Figaro", Feb 3, 1956, page 5). 
The Beneficiaries 
As opposed to this "prodigious heap of 
rubbish" inhabited by the autochtones, superb 
European quarters are being built in all our 
ton ns 
Activities of the country, mostly the eco-
nomic, are centred around the colonialists 
These easily impose their policy of prices and 
salaries, as well as exercise special control 
of the public finances. A few exarpplcs : 
i'rix ate enterprises doing public work benefit 
from extremely advantageous markets . a very 
c.trong profit margin is guaranteed them, 
usually 33 per cent. The material is gi \ en 
to them and becomes their private property 
at the end of the job. Their costing is un-
usually overestimated. Thus, to build the 
80 kms. of road which separate Edea from 
Douala, the Ratzel Bros. enterprise obtained, in 
1953, 2,800,000,000 French francs, or 35,000,000 
francs per kilometre ! Mixed economical en-

terprises- keep the benefits and spread the 
losses. A typical example is that of the Alucam 
2nd Enelcam Societies (Aluminium and Elec-
tricity of the Camcrun), which utilise electrical 
energy produced in Edea, although the state 
participates very deeply in production ex-
penses ; Alucam pays 0.80 frs, the kw. and 
sells that same kw. for 60 frs. in Douala ! 
Moreover, the State guarantees the share-
holders of these societies against all political 
risks, meaning against any eventual nationali-
'fation. 
Who then, can be astonished at seeing 
the profit curve of the imperialists remain high 
in spite of the war for liberation ? In 1956, 
the Manager of the Broadcasting institute in 
Douala declared that in that year the sums 
gained in Eastern Kamerun amounted to 7.5 
milliard francs whereas French investments 
amounted only to 4.5 milliards. ? 
The State favours exploiters by giving them 
the congiscatcd currency acquired thanks to the 
work of the Kamcrunian people. The receipts 
of Western Kamerunian customs have never 
been statisticised. An Indian flex\ spaper "The 
Bharat jyoti", of May 6, 1956, said that for the 
year of 1955. these receipts amounted to 
f 8,000,000. Out of this sum the Nigerian Go-
vernor gave the Kamerun only I 400,000. This 
is so because the rcpartition of receipts to the 
different regions of the Nigerian Federation 
is performed constitutionally on the following 
basis : 15% for the North, 20% for the West, 
41.5% for the East and only 1% for the Ka-
merun. ? 
Plundering of public receipts of the Kit-
merun is thus facilitated through the Kame-
run's integration with Nigeria, and the absence 
of a "'distinct financial system. Thus, what 
these budgetary excesses served for was never 
learned: The Visiting Mission of 1952 wrote : 
"Since the financial exercise of 1949-1950 the 
budget of the territory has always been in-
creasing. .The excess of 1949-1950 amounted 
to 226,000 sterling, that of 1950-1951 to 
L 204,000 sterling". To this can be added 
cxcesses of 352,911 for 1951-1952 and 
Jan. 1959 
200,000 for 1952-1953. Sure, a deficit of 
L 50,000 was registered in 1953-1954, but the 
next year the gains were again of L 40,000. 
It has been said that this money is used for 
the interest of the country ; yet Nigeria is 
covered with nice roads and palaces. NN hercas 
? 
Western Kamerun remains in misery. 
The same thing happens in the Eastern 
zone. The common assembly of all currencies 
in the franc zone and their unilateral manage-
ment by the French Government ensures co-
lonialists not only a remarkable treasure gain 
and fruitful devaluations for the African 
countries, but also, in a more direct fashion 
a substantial reserve of currencies. Since the 
last \ \ a r , the balance of payments of Eastern 
Ramerun is regularly filled by an excess of 
foreign currencies : it is officially said that it 
was 4,661,000 dollars for 19* 
Economic promotion? 
if really the imperialists had come to free 
us from misery, would they not use these sums 
for our economic promotion ? Why does our 
oil, our gold, our iron, our uranium, manganese. 
copper and even beauxite, remain unexploited ? 
Even the cocoa and rubber, etc., plantations 
arc exploited only up to 80%, and even less 
ihan that. 
eryone knows the importance of means 
of communication in economic grox% th Yet, 
in the Kamerun, these are only maintained, to 
say the least, in a belligerent manner, and 
only in strongly-populated European quarters. 
Communication elsewhere is left to rot. A 
typical example is the prolonging of the 
Douala ? Yaounde railroad to the Tchad. This 
prolonging N? ould considerably lower the rail 
tarrifs and seriously stimulate the economic 
development of the Tchad and Chari basins. 
A factor of particular interest 'for us is 
that the prolonging of the railroad is constantly 
requested by Africans of the Kamerun, of the 
Tchad and of the Oubangui (these latter have 
already proposed a federation !). But it would 
ruin the colonialists, who are great road 
transport users and shareholders in the Congo-
Jan. 1959 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 23 
Brazzaville railroad. That is why the prolong-
ing has been simply projected for 30 years. 
In Eastern Kamerun, even more scandalous 
ill will is shown towards bettering rail com-
munications. 
Even the particularly reactionary Visiting 
Mission of the United Nations which visited 
the country in 1955 branded this situation. That 
is so because, since 1920, the English have been 
proposing to drag all the traifics of the Tchad 
basin towards "their Nigeria", not ithstanding 
the territory under trusteeship which will, by 
oefinition, "escape" them That. is why they 
are prolonging by 200 kms into the Tchad 
the Nigerian railroad 
Thus, Article 73 of the harter, \\Inch 
prescribes unconditional "first thought" to the 
interests of the autochtoncs is unobserved. 
This policy has, for long, been the object 
of much vigorous opposition among all the 
social lavers

To stop this current, the colonialists ha % e 
? tried to brib%c Lertain Kamerumans 
On March 12, 1955, Mr. Hubert, one of 
the high officials of the general administration 
gave his subordinates the following orders : 
"The best thing we can do is to excite African 
Oppositions and to make life impossible for 
the U.P.C. leaders by putting them against 
(fedi:led and energetic African. I kno?? that 
this is not csay to do in Boulou country but 
it is however not impossible to find a few 
persons who do not agree with the policy of 
the U.P.C. and who accept to manifest their 
opposition openly". 
Soon afterwards, the March massacres 
happened, and the dissolution of the U.P.C., 
the so-called elections organised in a reign of 
terror, confusion and corruption, in order 
to form a budgetary Assembly which was 
thereafter called Legislative. Contrary to 
their electoral promises, the so-called De-
puties finance the Av a r of colonial reconquest. 
for, as long as it lasts, as long as there are 
no really free elections, they are getting richer 
and richer through the sweat and toil of our 
pee.: Here is a list of their gains in French 
francs  
Prime Minister : Monthly salary 700,000 ; 
Daily transportation cost 20,000 ; 
special funds every three months 
5,000,000. 
Vice Prime Minister : Monthly salary 
600,000. 
Minister : Monthly salary 540,000 ;.daily 
transportation costs 15,000. 
Secretary of State : Monthly salary 
500,000 ; daily transportation costs 
12,000. 
Deputies : Monthly salary 400,000. 
_ To this list of high gains must be added 
a list of substantial advantages : very com-
fortable housing, servants, car and driver 
paid by the State I One of these leeches 
oared to recognise in the course of a public 
meeting that "The comparative study of in-
demnities owed to deputies of the Kamerun 
has shown that they are placed third, after 
the U.S.A and Canada". (cf. "La Presse du 
Cameroun", June 6, 1958). Such disinterest, 
uch sense of ' responsibilities, in a country 
Nl here the annual income is of 20,000 frs ! ! 
Once the colonialists and their lackeys 
1-ave taken their share and more, what is left 
for the economic development of the country ? 
The equipment budget, regularly lower and 
lower since 1955, amounts to 2% of the budget 
of functioning and only covers in fact the 
expenses of cushioning and upkeeping : 
500,000,000 frs. in a country where investments 
ten times higher are needed in order to obtain 
rise in standards of life by just 1 per cent. ! 
In these conditions, one guesses easily the 
depth of the social crisis which the Kamerun 
is traversing, a crisis even more sharpened by 
the unusual plunders and destruction resulting 
from the colonial war. Moreover, and in spite 
of all the slogans praising the civilising mission 
if colonialism, the current policy is still abso-
lutely incapable crf pulling the Kamerun off 
its underdevelopment crisis. One example : at 
the present rythm, it would take 144 years 
for all the five millions Kamerunians to learn 
how to read and write ! Whereas the more 
advanced imperialist countries continue to 
further their development thanks to our re-
sources and work, how can we ever catch up

-with them in the framework of the present 
reginie ? 
The Kamerunian people are firmly resolved 
to eradicate to its foundation the present 
regime. Economically they prove it daily by 
the great material sacrifices to which. they 
consent in favour of the U.P.C. Here is the 
testimony of a great French newspaper, "Le 
Monde" which is resolutely hostile to our 
cause. "In 1956", it writes, "about 1 million 
C.F.A. francs in species were taken by the 
U.P.C. in the Bamileke region and the 30,000 
inhabitants of the Baham head district, head-
quarters of the U.P.C., furnished 400,000 frs. 
monthly". 
Although limited to one region and to one 
3 ear, this example shows clearly the popularity 
of the U.P.C., mostly in this aera of liberating 
war and great social misery. On the other 
hand, the Administration is forced to finance 
by itself the shadow parties which are told to 
oppose us. We read, for example, in the receipt 
books of the lndecam (Cameroun Independen-
ce Party) the following indications : "Receipt 
No. 26 Delegate of the Haussaire (French 
High Commissariat N.D.L.R.) 10,000 fts., 
May 28, 1956. Receipt No. 27, Regional 
Chieftain of Eden region, 15,000 frs. May 31, 
1956, propaganda trip Indecam. Receipt No. 28, 
Surete Manager 3,000 frs., June 1, 1956, 
Journal). 
To all those who believe in the firm de-
termination of the Kamerunian people led by 
the U.P.C. to liberate themselves immediately, 
to all those who, like us, think it necessary to 
have an effective anti-colonialist solidarity to 
oppose the colonialists, we appeal to contribute 
greatly to the immediate peaceful and demo-
cratic solution of the Kamerunian problem by 
making the Kamerun Day a real success on a 
world scale. 
U.P.C. Is The National Expression Of The Cameroons 
By 
JOHN K. KALE 
(Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Uganda National Congress) 
I have been personally associated with 
leaders of the Union des Populations du Ca-
meroon (U.P.C.) both in Africa and ON erseas. 
But having witnessed the battle of the U.P.C. 
at the last General Assembly of the United 
Nations I feel quite qualified to express an 
informed opinion on this mass country-wide 
Nationalist Movement. 
In sincere hope that this article will be 
read in British and French colonies where no 
effort was spared to try to descredit and 
describe the U.P.C. as anything except what 
it was, I will appeal to our readers to bear with
me so that I go a little in the history of the 
1J.P.C. Was Banned Because It Dentanded 
'Independence: 
, The U.P.C. represents 85% of the po-
pulation of the Cameroons. This statistical 
assessment is obtained from French authorities 
:and is well recognised in the 'French Press. 
Voicing the true National aspirations Of the 
-Cameroon people, the U.P.C. was from its 
inception fighting hand in hand with the Ca-
meroon Democratic Youth (C.D.Y.) and the 
Democratic Union of Cameroon Women 
(U.D.F.C.). These two popular organisations 
had, .it must be accepted,- their own specific 
aims and demands, but to be realistic they 
could not expect their fulfilment till the 
independence and unification of the Cameroon 
which was the other name of the U.P.C. 
The U.P.C. like any other nationalist or-
ganisation in maturing and displaying its com-
petence to take overpower from the colonial 
rulers had a thorny path. The K.N.U.C. in 
Cameroon under British rule and led by Mr. 
Endeley, a leader who dramatically changed 
his outlook on unification after marrying a 
Nigerian lady, faded from the U.P.C. as it 
insisted in its demands for independence and 
unification of the Cameroon. The imperialists 
were not satisfied with this disunity on a well 
-known national-caue. They sponsored political 
clubs. YOu cannot call them parties, 35 in 
number to combat the U.P.C. Keeping in mind 
the population of the Cameroon and the fact 
that the U.P.C. represented 85% you can well 
3an. 1959 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 25 
:imagine the representativity of these other 
35 parties. 
To make the long story short however 
-the U.P.C. in conjuction with its associated 
.yotith and women .organisations agreed on 
22nd April 1955 on a common programme of 
-action which unequivocally demanded full Na-
-Ilona' Independence and immediate unification. 
'To translate into action their demands, they 
cquested the' establishment of an executive 
'council which in co-ordination with the U.N. 
ould supervise free general elections con-
ducive to a Constituent National Assembly 
,which would in turn enter negotiation to ter-
-minate the trusteeship administration by 
1.rance. The plan was %cry logical and well 
worked out. The French colonialists were 
frustrated and as usual resorted to the strength 
-power policy. Failing to answer its legitimate, 
casonable and justified demands the admi-
nistrative authority was crude enough to find 
:a solution-in banning the U.P.C. and her sister 
.organisations. The French could justify this 
action in whatever propaganda language they 
;chose but that was the truth and the truth 
alone. 
.Nationalism Cannot Be Killed. 
The French imperialists could claim any 
number of casualities of the U.P.C. militants 
but the last they could say would he the sup-
pression of the national freedom ? vanguard 
under the leadership of the U.P.C., CD Y. and 
U.D.F.C. As their reputation is, the French 
were more ruthless than the British though 
teally it all comes to the same, thing' ? who 
with a different colonial plot left the U.P.C. 
legal in the Western Cameroon till two years 
later when it was banned on June 3rd 1957. 
A mcinth later, to be precise on the 30th June 
"1957, the British authority under,the cover of 
a Nigerian law which guards against the 
"danger to good government" deported the 
heroic leaders of the Union of the Population 
of the Cameroon, the Cameroon Democratic 
'Youth and the Federation of the Cameroon 
1)emocratic Women. 
The British Colonial authorities, in their 
.Short-range-view thought that was the end of 
'the Cameroon struggle. A proof of that was 
:the destination of the deportees which they 
--wrongly judged would be partner in the Ca-
ineroon draina. In.Strdan the Cam,eroon heroes 
.could 'not 'find better friends, the population 
that is, to the great chagrin of the imperialists. 
It was from this cradle that the Cameroon 
problem assumed its Current international 
character. The atrocities of tie imperialists 
and the martyrdom of the Cameroon freedom 
fighters was very well displayed to the 
justice of manking the world over. The 
deportation of these leaders turned, as con-
temporary politics would have it, a blessing in 
disguise. All the French murders could be 
frankly shown to the outside world ; the 
guerilla warfare in the Cameroon could be 
known : world opinion in support of the Ca-
meroon struggle could be mobilised and above 
all the petitioning-to the United Nations which 
had started as far back as 1952 but interrupted 
at the time of the U.P.C. persecution, could 
be resumed. If the imperialists will ever regret 
ever "loosing", the Cameroons, they will first 
be sorry of their deportation orders. 
Cameroon-Unique Trustee Territory. 
The problem of the Cameroon is singular. 
It could be seen but not described. This 
country, a gift to the imperialists in an 
exchange of bloodshed of the Africans in 
World \\Tar I, is a nice example of the civilising 
mission of the Western World. It is the only 
Trust Territory in which the Administrative 
Authority has used military rule to honour the 
United Nations Trusteeship Agreement. It is 
in the Cameroon that France has openly chal-
lenged the Binding nature of the United 
Nations. The Cameroon is the only U.N. 
agreement State in which there is complete 
absence of political life. The Cameroon is also 
unique in another aspect. No nationals of any 
Trusteeship country have been so adamant 
for their rights to freedom so as to necessitate 
colonial political suppression and the depor-
tation of their leaders as the people of this 
bisected country. The Cameroons have also 
petitioned the United Nations more than all 
other U.N. trusteeship people put together. 
France Chose the Wrong Path. 
While recognising the fact that the U.P.C. 
Was the universal Cameroon National Freedom 
front, the French colonial authorities cons-
tantly conspired against it by using Came-
roonian ?agents to spread their colonial interest. 
This became increasingly clear when the 
Cameroonian Leaders in exile uncovered the 
truth of the Cameroon problem te the world.

lonialists sent many Cameroon pseudo-repre-
sentatives to international conferences to 
mislead world opinion. This they could not 
do. Freedom is indivisible and its pursuers 
could not be divided. The world was a better 
judge and the French were the losers. 
As there could not be a vacuum the French 
tried to replace the U.P.C. with their puppets. 
The 35 "parties" were no longer necessary. 
'they had nobody to oppose. The U.P.C. and 
its associated organisations were banned. The 
French then established their puppet govern-
ment in the Cameroon. The overthrow of the 
"Mbinda" regime was moge than a proof of 
the imposed character of thi.s government. 
The lesson, was not convincing enough. By 
trial and error then the French made Ahijo a 
successor. I met Ahijo in New York. He had 
been brought by France to give witness to 
French good intentions in the Cameroon. He 
;s the most desperate Premier I have ever met. 
The U.P.C. And the United Nations. 
Another Anglo-French plot against the 
Cameroon was exposed by the United Nations 
at its 13th General Assembly. France sur-
prisingly and almost dramatically announced 
Per intention of terminating her trusteeship 
of the Cameroon on 1st January 1950. The 
United Kingdom did not delay to make her 
plan known : "Her Majesty's Government 
would consider the termination of the Trustee-
ship of the Cameroon under British admi-
nistration by 1st October 1960". 
France and Great Britain know as we all 
no that there is one Cameroon. That the Ca-
meroon was arbitrarily divided to satisfy im-
perialists needs is just a historical fact. 
Britain and France know more than anybody 
else that independence and unification of the 
Cameroon is a national aspiration of the popu-
lation. If these powers were genuine in granting 
such "independence" to the same country how 
on earth could they choose different dates ? 
How is it they made no provision for free elec-
tions precceding independence? How could this 
independence be achieved before normal po-
litical life was resumed in the Cameroon ? 
Which ruling circle in Paris or London, if we 
may ask further questions, cobld neglect the 
i,eality of the representative and Nationalist 
character of the U.P.C., C.D.Y. or U.D.F.C.? 
Could real independence be given before com-
plete political amnesty of the leaders of these 
movements some of whom were in exile and 
cthers in detention camps ? Both France and. 
Great Britain recognised the unification 
of the Cameroons to be not only a pos-
sibility but a likelihood after independence. 
But we know neither of them envisaged a na-
tional referendum supervised by the United' 
Nations whereby the Cameroon people could 
freely determine their own future. These are 
few of the many questions we must ask our-
selves before we fall prey of another disguised 
Imperialism in the Cameroon. 
The French and British declarations at the 
United Nations were as vague as they could 
be. They coincided with a U.N. Visiting 
Mission in the Cameroon which they hoped 
would rubber-stamp their validity. 
But even 
then the Visiting Mission could not give such 
a comprehensive and convincing evidence,. 
since as we all know it stayed in the Came-
roons only for 34 days and the mass of the 
people had no access to it. How could their 
findings reflect the aspirations of approxi-
mately six million people scattered over an 
area of 525,000 sq. kilometres just in such a 
short time. The French authority to make the 
assurance of their plan doubly sure flew the-
"Prime Minister" Ahijo to New York to join 
the French Delegation on behalf of the "Ca-
meroon Government". 
The Future of the Cameroons 
to be Deterniined by the U.N. 
The 20th February 1959 is a historical day 
for the Cameroon. It has rightly been called 
the Cameroon Day by the All African People's 
Conference. It will mark the reConvening day 
of -the 13th General Assembly of the United 
Nations "to consider the future of the Ca-
m croons". 
France and Great Britain with all .their 
diplomatic ingenuity could not convince the 
United Nations .of their good intentions in thc? 
Cameroon. France was the weaker dcfendent 
because her witness,"Premier"Ahijo"committ-
ed perjury". With all the French briefings he 
got, he ultimately had to confess that inde-
pendence and unification of the Cameroon was 
the universal aspiration of its population. 
France was let down and before Ur. Ahijo 
could answer questions from members* of the 
Committee, France sent him back to the Ca-
meroons. The argument. was "official duty" 
obliged his early return to Yaounde. It was 
Jan 1959 
AFRO-ASIAN BULLETIN 27 
all a hoax ! Such a drama w as an advantage 
to the U P.0 petitioners led by Mr. Felix-
Roland Moumic, its President. The public 
confession of "Premier" Ahijo of the aspiration 
of the Cameroon people as advocated by the 
U.1'.0 and frustrated by France and her puppet 
government led by him left the 4th Committee 
in no doubt of the political forgery prevailing 
in the Cameroon There and then the de-
legation of Iraq asked for the "Immediate 
restoration of the Party led by Ali- Moumic". 
What Mr Pachadhi, the Iraqi representative, 
precisely meant was that the UPC w as the 
only Cameroonian national expression and its 
legal existence in the country was a prere-
quisite to the solution of the Cameroon 
problem At this stage most delegates thought 
tw ice and discovered the trap enmeshed by 
France. This tog-ether with flooding cal des 
supporting the U.P C Petitioners and the sub-
sequent sympathy of the Committee to Mr 
Moumic and his colleagues left no doubt of 
the um ersality of the U.P.0 
How the 20th February 
Was Unanimously Accepted. 
The determined, and genuine stand of the 
Cameroon petitioners as opposed to the 
conspiracy of Mr Ahijo coupled with the 
trickery of France and Great Britain enflamed 
the Afro-Asian group, the Socialist and a ma-
jority of the Latin American countries. De-
legates expressed their concern on how admi-
nistering- authorities of Trusteeship countries 
were usurping the rights of the United 
Nations and outshadowing its responsibilities 
It must be remembered that the United 
Nations is the supreme organ in so far as 
matters affecting Trusteeship Territories are 
concerned The administering authorities only 
shoulder responsibilities of its behalf. Great 
Britain and France were not shy to tramp on 
the U N' charter under naked pretexts 
The Afro-Asian countries stood solidly 
behind the U N. charter and the Trusteeship 
agreement of the Cameroons by the United 
Nations on the one hand. and France and 
Great Britain on the other. They felt the in-
dependence of a trust Territory, and the Ca-
meroons for this matter, was not a matter to 
be decided by the administrative authorities 
alone in fact they felt offended by the way 
France and Great Britain were alienating the 
U N from tile realisation of the objective of 
the trusteeship agreement, to which the 
United Nations was a party. Consequently 
Ghana, I Butt, India, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, the 
Philippines and Yugoslavia sponsored a reso-
lution that the United Nations "decides to 
resume the General Assembly on 20th 
February 1959 to consider exclusively the 
question of the future of the Trust Territories 
of the Cameroon.; under French administration 
and the Cameroons under United Kingdom 
adm mist ration". 
This was a great blow to Administrative 
Authorities who never expected it. You could 
see the British and French Representatives 
openly lobbying delegates. Session after 
session w as adjourned to allow "extra com-
mittee discussions" and "informal consul-
tations". 
The motion took several days and you 
could see undisguised uneasiness among many 
quarters of the chamber of the 4th Committee. 
A satisfactor compromise could not be 
reached. The Afro-Asian block were in to 
move the motion w illy milly. As Great Britain 
and France were directly concerned, the United 
States chose to speak for them and of all 
people her spbkesman was a negress singer, 
Miss Marion Anderson, the head of the de-
legation "lhe U S. delegation felt cons ening 
a special U N session for the United Nation's 
future of the Cameroon was tantamount to a 
degradation of the former's prestige and that 
such a mo\e would create a serious precedent. 
The delegation also expressed the happiness 
that there was no threat to world peace and 
security to W arrant a special session of the 
U N No doubt the delegation had in mind 
the Middle East precedent 1 
Miss Anderson was touched and she made 
a public "personal statement" which worned 
delegates that there was none amongst them 
to whom the freedom and independence of an 
African state meant more She alluded to her 
African descent and reminded delegates that 
she worked on instructions as any delegation 
did This contradiction of a personal opinion 
of a delegate from the official delegation view 
w as an important precedent in the history of 
the United Nations, and to be frank an im-
portant factor in the determination of the 
future of the Cameroons. 
The decisions of the forthcoming United 
Nations w ill have far-reaching effects on the 
remaining Trust Territories as well as the 
other dependent African countries.

PREFACE 
Korea has been divided into the north and south 
for more than 12 years since her liberation from the 
Japanese colonial rule. 
The southern half of Korea is still under the occu-
pation of the American forces, and the demarcation 
line which is by no means a frontier has artificially 
severed her in half. 
This long bisection of the territory and split of the 
nation has brought to the Korean people immense suf-
ferings and misfortunes, and has been retarding the 
political, economic and cultural development of Korea. 
The division of our territory is not only hampering 
the concerted development of the national economy of 
Korea but also preventing the uniform, planned use 
of her rich national resources, and greatly hindering 
the inheritance and development of the national litera-
ture and arts which have a long and brilliant tradition. 
Besides, the division of the country brings grave 
calamity for the individual life of the Korean people. 
It prevents family members and relatives from meeting 
with each other and even from exchanging letters. 
Therefore, the peaceful unification of the country 
is the supreme task for the whole Korean people, 
which proceeds from their vital interests. 
Then, why do we, Koreans of the same blood, have 
to suffer from this national calamiiy under these in-
tolerable, abnormal circumstances? This, of course, is 
entirely due to the aggressive policy of the American 
imperialists and the country-selling policy of the 
Syngman Rheeites who have been persistently hinder-
ing Korea's unification, independence and freedom. 
From the very first day of their occupation, the 
American imperialists have been trying hard to con-
vert South Korea into an object of squeezing out 
maximum profit for the millionaires of the Wall Street 
and an outpost for their aggression of the Asian con-
tinent.

The US imperialists enforced the military adminis-
tration and paved a way to their reactionary rule over 
South Korea, oppressing and persecuting the patriot-
ic and democratic forces there. They oppressed and 
forcibly dissolved the people's committees of all levels 
which were organized soon after the liberation on the 
initiative of the people. 
The US Military Governor enforced on Feb. 20, 
1946, his Ordinance No. 55 ? "Law on Registration 
of Political Parties" ? with a view to restricting and 
oppressing the activities of the democratic political 
parties in South Korea and issued on May 4, 1946, 
the "Ordinance Concerning Violation of Orders and 
Laws of Military Government" aimed at suppressing 
the entire patriotic and democratic forces. He put into 
effect the "Law on Registration of Publicating" on 
May 29 of the same year, which was followed by 
"Ordinance on the Press and Periodicals" aimed at 
exterminating freedom of the press. It enforced a num-
ber of other fascistic laws including "Rules on As-
sembly and Demonstration" of Dec. 1947. 
Brandishing these evil laws, the US imperialists 
perpetrated all sorts of outrageous acts, restricted 
the activities of the democratic political parties and 
social organizations in South Korea, dissolved them 
by force and trampled upon the freedom of speech, 
press and assembly and association. 
Running amuck in converting South Korea into 
their military base, the American imperialists con-
cocted in Nov., 1945 the "National Constabulary," 
predecessor of the "ROK Army," in order to collect 
cheap cannon fodder. At the same time they laid out 
and enlarged big military highways which run along 
the 38th parallel from the eastern coast to the western 
coast of Korea and fortified their positions along the 
38th parallel. 
In addition to this, they enlarged the Kimpo air 
base for B-29 bombers, and newly constructed many 
air bases including the Musolpo Air Base, Chejoo 
island, and also completed a large scale expansion 
? 4 ? 
project of the naval bases in Chinhai, Pusan, Inchon 
and Pohang. Thus they carried out a frenzied con-
struction and expansion of military establishments in 
South Korea. 
On Nov. 13, 1945, by the order of the Military Gov-
ernor in Korea they established the "National De-
fence Command" and on June 15, 1946 formed one 
company of "Korean Constabulary" and reinforced 
the "Coast Guard" from Sept. 1946. On July 27, 1948, 
the puppet "Air Force" has been formed. 
The American imperialists who hate Korea's unifi-
cation and independence intentionally disrupted the 
resolution of the Three Power Foreign Ministers' con-
ference in Moscow, and concocted the "UN Commis-
sion on Korea" by the unlawful "decision" on Korean 
problem in the United Nations. 
Then on May 10th, 1948, they forcibly carried out 
the separate election in the southern part of Korea at 
the point of the bayonet of the US occupation forces 
and fabricated Syngman Rhee's puppet regime. More, 
they attempted to "legalize" the regime on the ground 
that the "election" was held under the "supervision" 
of the "UN Commission." 
They thus began to carry out their aggressive poli-
cy more unscrupulously and more craftily through 
Syngman Rhee's puppet government. Syngman Rhee 
carried forward the US Military Government's high-
handed policy and fascist laws, proclaimed the "Law 
on State Security" and further intensified the middle-
age-like oppression of the South Korean people. The 
Syngman Rheeites rounded up 118,621 people during 
1949 alone, and arrested 32,018 people from Jan. to 
April, 1950, by this notorious law. (Figures quoted 
from the Report of UN Korean Commission which was 
submitted to the 5th General Assembly of the United 
Nations.) During the period from Oct. 1945 to May 
1955, as many as 159,723 people were imprisoned or 
put to death without a trial and 85,532 of them were 
massacred on the spot of arrest. These figures elo-
quently tell how furious their barbarous action was.

On the other hand, the American imperialists took 
every possible step to destroy the South Korean eco-
nomy and convert South Korea into their market, ob-
ject of investment and source of raw materials for 
their industry. 
The American imperialists, who seized the key in-
dustry of South Korea by the single ordinance of the 
Military Governor, strengthened the control of the 
properties formerly owned by the Japanese, by "Pro-
perty Cusothan's Ordinance No. 8" on management 
of vested property dated Jan. 31, 1946. This ordinance 
provided for the transfer of right of custody and su-
pervision of former Japanese-owned properties in 
fifteen main branches?enterprises, companies, cor-
porations and organizations of all types including 
even schools?from the Property Custodian of the 
Military Government to the American advisors and 
departments, sections and agencies of the Military 
Government. 
Thus the former Japanese-owned enterprises which 
came under the American imperialist's control soon 
after the liberation amounted to more than 85 per cent 
of the whole of the South Korean industrial enter-
prises (Seoul Shinmoon, Jan. 23, 1955) 
The US imperialists began to sell or destroy the 
former Japanese-owned property. They sold during the 
year of 1947 alone more than 8,000 dwelling houses, 
2,000 vessels, 5,000 small-scale enterprises. ("Chosen 
Keizai" published in Tokyo on Dec. 20, 1956 by the 
Toyo Keizai Shimpo) 
Besides, they destroyed or converted into their 
military repair shops many industrial enterprises in-
cluding the Chosun Steel Works, the Ulsan Oil Re-
finery and the Poopyong Arsenal. As a result, in 1948, 
the industrial production level of South Korea went 
down to 20 2 per cent as compared with 19=10 wlien 
Korea was under the Japanese rule. (Annual Econo-
mic Review, Bank of Korea, Seoul, 1949) 
In the field of agriculture, the US imperialists 
started to loot the Korean peasants through the 
? 6 ? 
"Oriental bevelopMent Co., Ltd.," the rapacious organ 
of the Japanese imperialists for their exploitation of 
Korean peasants, which the US imperialists renamed 
the "New Korea Company" on Feb. 21, 1946, by "Mili-
tary Government Ordinance No. 52." This company 
owned 320,000 hectares of land, including 230,000 
hectares of orchards as well as arable land, or 12 per 
cent of the total area of arable land in South Korea. 
(Annual Economic Review, 1955) 
The volume of exploitation through this "New Ko-
rea Company" amounted to 2,714,650,000 won in 
the period from Aug. 15, 1945 to March 31, 1948, 
even according to figures of the US Military Govern-
ment. 
Following the concoction of the Syngman Rhee 
puppet government in 1948, the US imperialists have 
concluded a number of aggressive treaties with the 
Syngman Rhee clique and embarked upon firmly 
establishing the system of colonial rule over the South 
Korean economy. The first step for this was the "US-
ROK Agreement on Transfer of Finance and Pro-
perty" concluded on Sept. 1, 1948. 
This agreement stipulated that every possessory 
right and ownership of properties and appendages in 
South Korea the US Government is interested in, re-
gardless of their forms, will be transferred at the re-
quest of the US Government. It also says that all that 
happened during the US military administration will 
be admitted as fait accompli and provides for the free 
use of places and buildings necessary for the US oc-
cupation forces. 
The US imperialists forced South Korea to pay an-
nually the interest for the 25 million dollar credit they 
gave to South Korea in 1946 in the form of surplus 
commodities and surplus agricultural produce and to 
hand over to the United States for part of the credit 
the Bando Hotel and other big buildings in Seoul and 
a huge area of land for military use. 
The American imperialists enlarged the scope of 
their control and exploitation by concluding the "Mu-

tual Aid Agreement" with the 8yrigman Rile() puppet 
government on Dec. 10, 1948. 
By this agreement they firmly grasped the control 
of the whole of the South Korean economy, from the 
control of production and distribution of raw materials 
and products to that of currency issue, finance and 
credit, foreign exchanges, exports and imports of all 
items, compulsive collection of Korean rice and obliga-
tory distribution of the US cereals to the Korean peo-
ple. 
Having seized the control in the political, econo-
mic and military fields of South Korea, the US imperi-
alists concluded in Jan. 1950 "US-ROK Agreement on 
Military Aid" and "US-ROK Agreement on Military 
Advisory Group" with the Syngman Rhee govern-
ment, thus completely taking the right of commanding 
the puppet army into their hands. They concentrated 
puppet army units into the area along the 38th parallel 
on April 5, 1950. They had been causing provocative 
incidents with greater frequency since then, looking 
out for a chance, till they unleashed the aggression 
against the northern part of the D P.R.K. on June 25, 
1950, which led up to the three-year war in Korea. 
The American imperialists have committed atroci-
ties unprecedented in the history of mankind in their 
aggressive war in Korea. 
They have massacred at random innocent people 
in North Korea, destroyed more than 8,700 buildings of 
factories and enterprises as well as 600 thousand 
dwelling houses with a total floor space of 28 million 
square metres and devastated 370 thousand hectares of 
agricultural land, reducing the acreage by 90 thousand 
hectares. 
Moreover, they have destroyed and pillaged more 
than 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and clinics, 260 
theatres and cinemas and thousands of other cultural 
and sanitary establishments. 
Indeed, the total amount of damages even accord-
ing to a rough estimation amounts to 420,000 million 
won.

Besides this, the American soldiers have destroyed 
and plundered factories, schools, hospitals, houses 
and other properties of the people in South Korea, 
mounting to 3,000 million dollars (cf. 1955 "Economic 
Year Book" edited by the Research Department of the 
ROK Bank). 
During the three years of the Korean war, the 
American soldiers have committed most cruel and in-
human atrocities and massacres unprecedented in the 
history of mankind. 
To have an idea of these atrocities, it is enough 
to cite the fact that the number of innocent people 
massacred in Korea by the US troops during the 14 
months from June 25, 1950, to Aug., 1951, reached 
more than 2 million. 
Their atrocities were unparalleled not only in the 
number of people they massacred but also in the 
cruelty of methods they used. How cruel were their 
acts can be seen through the following instances: 
On October 18, 1950, the American soldiers in 
Shinchun county arrested more than 900 innocent 
inhabitants, tied them up with ropes and cords, and 
put them into a pit Then the American soldiers poured 
gasoline and set them on fire, and shot those who 
tried to creep out. They then buried them on the spot 
including those who were still alive. 
On Oct. 20, 1950, in the same county, the Ameri-
can soldiers massacred over 520 people en masse 
by another cruel method. The American soldiers, after 
stripping those people naked, drove them into an 
underground shelter, blocked the entry with boards 
and earth, and after leaving them to suffer from suf-
focasion for a long while, massacred them by explod: 
ing the dynamites that had been placed inside the 
shelter in advance. 
On Oct. 9, 1950, in Seoul, the American soldiers 
arrested 16 innocent inhabitants, and killed them by 
cutting off their hands, legs, tongues, ears, noses, and 
breasts when they were women, and scooping out their 
eyeballs.

In Oct. 1950, in Inchon, the American soldiers ar-
rested Kim Bu Ing (27 years of age), wife of Li 
Sang Kyoon, a dock worker in Inchon, for the only 
reason that she was a member of the Women's U-
nion. After violating and torturing her by every 
means, they stripped her naked, burnt her breasts 
an'd sexual organ with a heated iron poker and then 
killed her. 
On Oct. 18, 1950, in Wonsan-ri, Chori myun, 
Shinchun county, the American soldiers arrested a 
peasant called Bak Do Se only because he was a 
model farmer, passed wire through his nose and ears, 
pierced his hands with a bayonet, nailed the words 
"model fdrmer" on his forehead and dragged him a-
round the village before they killed him. And Ameri-
can soldiers tied his daughter-in-law Li Ok Bong to 
a chestnut tree on a hill, inserted into her vagina a 
stick wet with petrol, and killed her by setting it on 
fire. All this brutality because she resisted them when 
the latter tried to violate her. 
These are only a few instances of the atrocities and 
massacres committed by the US troops during the 
war in Korea. 
Even after the conclusion of the Armistice Agree-
ment, the American imperialists consistently pursuing 
their aggressive policy, have continued to commit 
atrocities against the Korean people. 
Constantly obstructing the peaceful unification of 
the country, the unanimous desire of the Korean peo-
ple, the American imperialists have intensified their 
colonial enslavement policy in South Korea, and be-
come more and more frenzied in oppressing and ex-
ploiting the people. 
Flagrantly violating the Armistice Agreement, 
they are trying to perpetuate the occupation of South 
Korea as their aggressive "advanced assaulting base." 
To begin with, the American imperialists conclud-
ed the "ROK-US Treaty for Mutual Defence" with 
the Syngman Rhee clique on Aug 8, 1953, only 10 
days after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, 
? 10 ? 
a treaty granting wholly to the American imperialists 
the prerogative of supreme command over South Ko-
rean puppet army and providing for the permanent 
occupation of South Korea by the US Army. 
The very fact that this treaty was concluded even 
prior to the opening of the preliminary talks to pre-
pare for the political conference envisaged in the 
Armistice Agreement, proves without the slightest 
doubt that, from the beginning, they were not the 
least inclined towards the peaceful unification of Ko-
rea. 
On the other hand, the American imperialists and 
the Syngman Rhee clique are resorting to continuous 
provocative acts violating the military demarcation 
line. The number of cases of the violation of the 
Armistice Agreement by the American imperialists 
and the Syngman Rhee clique that our side took up 
with the US side as of April 15, 1958, alone reached 
780, including the cases of intrusion by their military 
aircraft since the Armistice Agreement. 
Moreover, they systematically organized all kinds 
of provocations for the purpose of obstructing the 
activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Com-
mission even threatening the lives of its members. At 
the end of this, they unilaterally suspended the lawful 
activities of the Neutral Nations inspection teams in 
the whole area of South Korea in June 1956. 
And on June 21, 1957, they unilaterally renounced 
the observation of paragraph 13-d of the Armistice 
Agreement which prohibits the illegal introduction of 
military weapons into Korea, and they openly tried 
to bring about the overall abolishment of the Korean 
Armistice Agreement. 
On July 1, 1957, the American imperialists brought 
the "United Nations Command" in Seoul. On Oct. 15, 
they transferred the 1st Cavalry Division from Japan 
to South Korea, integrated it with the 24th Division 
of the US Army stationed in South Korea and formed 
a new "Atomic Division" together with the 7th Divi-
sion of the US Army.

And the South Korean puppet army which consist-
ed of 16 divisions at the time of armistice has been ex-
panded to 21 divisions with 720,000 effectives in active 
service and 10 divisions of "reserves." They are still 
continuing to reinforce fervently the puppet army en-
rolling the youth by force. 
Besides this, they have introduced into South Ko-
rea atomic guns of 280 mm. calibre, an Honest John 
rocket battalion from Japan, and conducted large 
scale "mobile ?atomie manoeuvres." 
The American imperialists are still continuing to 
supply the Syngman Rhee puppet army with a large 
amount of new type weapons. 
The colonial policy of the American imperialists to 
enslave the South Korean economy has also been in-
tensified after the war in Korea. 
Today the South Korean economy is completely 
subordinated to American imperialists. Among the 
capital goods needed in South Korea, 100 per cent of 
machine tools, rubber, sugar, fertilizer, 95-98 per cent 
of cotton, and 80 per cent of cement are supplied by 
the United States. 
Such aggressive policy of economy pursued by the 
American imperialists has inevitably caused severe 
damages to the national economy in South Korea. 
In 1956, the industrial output in South Korea was 
reduced to 57 per cent that in the last days of the Jap-
anese imperialist rule (according to the calculation 
hosed on the reports of Tonga Ilbo dated Jan. 10, 
1957, and Seoul Shinmoon dated Aug. 15, 1955) and 
between Oct. 1955 and Jan. 1957, 1,176 medium and 
small enterprises went bankrupt a's against Oct. 1955 
(see Chosun Ilbo dated Feb. 17, 1957). 
The aggressive policy of economy pursued by the 
American imperialists has also brought grave conse-
quences in the field of agricultural economy. 
Under the Japanese imperialist rule, South Korea 
did not feel any shortage of food although the _Jopa: 
12 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
nese imperialists shipped out every year several mil-
lion suk of rice to their country. 
However, today South Korea has turned into an 
area of starvation and is obliged to import several 
million suk of rice from foreign countries every year. 
This is the result of the aggressive scheme of the 
American imperialists who are trying to reduce South 
Korea into a consuming market where they can sell 
their surplus agricultural products. They have sys-
tematically ruined South Korean agriculture. For 
example, in 1955, the cultivated land in South Korea 
diminished by 310,000 hectares as against the last 
days of the Japanese imperialist rule. (See the 1957 
Economic Year Book of the Bank of ROK) and the 
agricultural output in South Korea decreased in 1956 
by 30 per cent as against the last days of the Japanese 
imperialist rule (ditto). The output of cotton in 1957 
was reduced to 18 per cent as against 1945 (Kyung-
hyang Shinmoon dated Oct. 30, 1957). 
Under such circumstances, every year, in the lean 
spring season, more than 700 thousand households of 
farmers run out of food (Dongyang Tongshin, 
Jan. 9, 1958) and at the end of March, 1957, the num-
ber of foodless peasant households reached 1.2 mil-
lion. 
And, this year also, according to the figures com-
piled by the end of January, the number of foodless 
peasant households was expected to reach 700 thous-
and by the end of February (Sege Tongshin, Feb. 13, 
1958). 
Because of the impoverishment of the peasants, 
their debts are growing yearly, and in 1957, the 
amount of their debts increased to 100,000 million 
hwan, 5 times that in the year of 1954. (See the South 
Korean review Jaijung No. 6, 1957.) 
As a result of the aggressive policy pursued by 
the American imperialists in South Korea, the mass 
unemployment, the chronic state of starvation, the 
skyrocketing prices and taxes are producing untold 
sufferings and misfortunes in South Korea today.

Thus the South Korean people are placed in an 
unbearable situation due to the pauperization, non-
rights and the unbridled atrocities perpetrated by the 
U.S. Army occupying South Korea. 
DATA ON ATROCITIES OF U.S. ARMY IN 
SOUTH KOREA 
The atrocities of the US Army in South Korea 
have been steadily increasing since the armistice. 
The cases of atrocities committed by the US Army 
during the period from the signing of the Armistice 
Agreement on July 27, 1953, to April 1958 amount to 
more than 200, even according to reports of the South 
Korean press. 
The atrocities of the US Army in South Korea 
have become more cruel and frequent since last year, 
especially since the moving of the "U.N. Command" to 
Seoul. 
Such atrocities as those committed by Girard in 
Japan and Reynolds in Taiwan which stirred up the 
world public opinion are an "everyday occurrence" in 
South Korea. 
The US Army authorities are taking no due, legal 
sanctions against the atrocities of the US Army which 
evoke national indignation of the Korean people and 
insult the conscience of civilized mankind. On the con-
ti they are shielding and encouraging the criminals 
under this or that pretext. 
Here we are citing some instances out of the many 
atrocities committed by the US Army in South, Korea 
since the armistice as reported by the South Korean 
press. 
I. Raping and Killing Women 
As reported by the South Korean press, there has 
been an unbroken chain of violence and murder cases 
comm.tted by the US Army against Korean women all 
over South Korea.

guards at the US Kunsan Air Base, fired carbines at 
seven Korean girls who were cutting grass nearby, 
hitting 18-year-old Kim Jung Re and 17-year-old Kang 
Keum Soon. (Kyunghyang Shinmoon, Sept. 20) 
Both girls were seriously wounded, and Kim Jung 
Re died on Sept. 25. 
With regard to the homicide case, the US Air Force 
authorities announced: "The girls fled when the guards 
attempted to apprehend them for questioning. When 
the girls failed to halt, the guards fired at them." 
(Kyunghy,ang Shinmoon, Sept. 21, 1957) 
It was on Dec. 10, three months after this occur-
rence that a court martial took up the homicide case 
of Carrot B. Taylor. 
At the court, the truth of the case was brought to 
the open by eye-witnesses. 
Three girls including Kang Keum Soon who came 
into court as witnesses all testified that the US guards 
permitted them by gesture to cut grass in the area. 
They also stated that no order to halt was given by 
the guards. (Hankook Ilbo, Dec. 11, 1957) 
It became clear that the announcement of the US 
Air Force authorities did not tally with the true state 
of affairs. 
Taylor, one of the accused, who killed the Korean 
girl, was given by the court martial a penalty of 9 
months confinement at hard labour and the reduction 
of his salary by 75 dollars for the same period. 
A court martial of Edward T. Young who killed Ko-
rean girl Kim Jung Re was held on January 6, 1958, 
five months after the occurrence of the incident. 
At the court, murderer Edward Young, who had 
been pleading innocence, could not but admit his guilt, 
when he was driven to the corner by the testimonies 
of the eye-witnesses. 
On the 9th, the 4th day of the trial, the accused 
Edward Young was given a penalty of three months 
confinement and pay cut of 30 dollars for the same 
period. (Hapdong Tongshin, Jan. 9)

It is an everyday occurrence for US soldiers to 
commit atrocities against South Korean women in 
broad daylight in the streets of oities. 
On January 22, 1956, two American soldiers ap-
peared in Torim-dong, Yungdeungpo ward, Seoul, and

form of the Ryonghyun Primary School, on the false 
charge of gasoline theft without any ground whatso-
ever and shot his M1 rifle at this pregnant woman, 
killing her on the spot. 
In this connection, the April 10 issue of Inchon Ilbo 
carried an item denouncing the audacious atrocity of 
? 18 ? 
the US soldier. It said: Guards of US units stationed 
in Inchon are using their arms at random, thus fre-
quently causing incidents resulting in the death of 
citizens. The peaceable citizens appeal to the US ArtnS, 
authorities to put an end to the acts of violating civil 
rights 
Disregarding the ever mounting voices of protest of 
the South Korean people against the frequent homicid-
al outrages of the US Army in South Korea, the US 
soldiers are committing more and more atrocities.

suburbs of Kunsan, and took away the draught cow of 
peasant Choi Bong Wha. When Choi's wife Kim Soon 
Rye (62 year old) begged the US soldiers to return the 
coy, they set a military dog on her. For the purpose of 
halting such uninterrupted atrocities of the US sold-
iers, the correspondents in the Kunsan area requested 
an interview with the commander of the US soldiers, 
but even this request was rejected. (Seoul Shinmoon, 
Sept. 23, 1957) 
On Oct. 3, 1957, a 60.year old woman Kim Ho Hi,

ing-gun bullets fired by Mgt. Joseph E. Woodin be-
longing to the 24th Division of the US Army. The US

way in the vicinity of the Battalion area, killing Li 
Chun Soon and wounding Chun Bok Soon in her left 
arm. 
In connection with this incident, the US 8th Army 
authorities alleged that the women intruded into the 
battalion compound breaking the barbed wire fence 
and approached their supply house and were shot be-
cause they attempted to run away when they were 
ordered to halt by the guard. It was also announced 
that the 2 other women were also caught and put under 
custody. (Chosun Ilbo, Oct. 7, 1957) 
But the result of the "ROK-US joint investigation" 
proved that the women were fired at while trying to 
find their way in a thick fog. (Hapdong Tongshin 
message from Seoul, Oct. 5,, 1957) 
On Oct. 27, 1957, in 6th Street Eulji-ro, Seoul, Sgt.

On the evening of April one, on the 1st wharf of 
Pusan, US Army train guard Mckenney, 21, raped a

nounced that the guard fired a carbine bullet at two 
Koreans who were approaching him, and this bullet hit 
the woman, killing her. (Sege Tongshin, April 2, 
1958) 
But according to the result of the investigation of 
the South Korean side to the "ROK-US Joint Investi-
gation Group" semen was found through the autopsy 
of the body and thus it was made clear That she was 
violated. (Dongyang Tongshin, April 5, 1958) 
2. Atrocities against Children, Youth and Students 
Among the barbarous acts of the US Army in South 
Korea, its merciless atrocities against innocent child-
ren go beyond the imagination of the sobre-minded 
people. 
The incidents in which South Korean children fell 
victim to the villainous amusement of the US Army 
? 22 ? 
after the war reach an astounding figure even accord-
ing to the extremely restricted data reported by the 
South Korean press. 
Follows some instances of those atrocities that 
aroused the particular wrath of the South Korean pub-
lic: 
On February 25, 1958, in Poopyung, 2 US officers 
and 1 Corporal ruthlessly tortured a Korean boy, nail-
ed him into a wooden box and carried him away by a 
helicopter. 
According to the investigation of the "ROK-US 
Joint Investigation Group," around 3 a.m. on Feb. 25, 
three US armymen including Captain Marvin. E. 
Kemp of the US 8th Army Aircraft Maintenance 
Centre in Poopyung, under the command of Major 
Thomas G. James, beat a Korean boy Kim Choon II, 
13, and stabbed with a knife his legs and arms on the 
false charge of "theft." 
He was stabbed with a knife three times by the 
captain and ruthlessly beaten by another soldier. 
The boy's hair was cut off with a pair of electric 
? 
hair-clippers and tar-like substance was daubed on 
his head. 
Then the boy was put into a box used for transport-
ing airplane parts and the lid was nailed down. 
AL 8 a.m. Major James loaded the box into a heli-
copter and took it to Euijungboo north of Seoul where 
he dumped the cargo. ? 
According to what the Korean boy Kim Choon II 
said, he asked a man in Euijungboo the way to Poop-
yung and then set out. (Hapdong Tongshin of 
March 1,) 
He said that he resisted with all his strength when 
he was being put into a box. 
At an interview with an AP correspondent, he said; 
"I was sure that I would be sent to far-away place 
and killed."

Information released by the US Army side was at 
variance with the deposition of Kim Choon II. The AP-
Hapdong Tongshin confirms this fact on March 3 in 
the following words: 
To the question of the AP correspondent the boy 
described the persecution, crying bitterly. "They kick-
ed, stabbed nd beat me, tarred my head and nailed 
me down in a box. 
"On the 25th, I was tortured for nearly 5 hours in 
an officer's room. Until I was put into the box, two 
American soldiers endlessly tortured me, kicking and 
stabbing. A certain Major told them to agonize me. A 
captain and master sergeant beat-me with a leather 
strap and a two-feet-long stick, until the leather tore 
to three pieces. They also stabbed me with a fruit knife 
on my arm and leg, leaving one inch gashes. More-
over, they cut my hair with a clipper or pulled it out 
with pliers. 
"After that they took me to a guard house and put 
me in a box. Before they nailed me down they poured 
something black like tar on my head. That stuff ran 
down in my ears and my left ear was almost stop-
ped up." 
After he returned from Euijungboo, the boy said, 
he used 1.5 gallons of gasoline to wipe off the tar. 
When he was sent to Euijungboo in a box, he 
was almost unconscious. But he happened to see, 
through a crack of the box, people passing, so he 
called out for help with all his might. 
To the question of the AP reporter asking if he 
has any relative, the boy answered, again crying, that 
his mother died when he was ten years old, his elder 
brother was in the army and his father living in 
Masan. 
This is the rough account of the circumstances of 
the case. 
Recently the "court martial" of the US Ground 
Force acquitted those American soldiers who corn, 
? 24 ? 
mitted such outrage and passed the sentence of "re-
primand" and 1,200 dollar "fine" upon Captain Kemp 
alone. 
More cruel than this is the case of shooting 3 
year old baby in Inchon last year. 
At about 8:30 a.m., on July 6, 1957, Plc Ronald 
Fasset belonging to a US guard detachment station-
ed at the Inchon port, who was guarding oil pipe, 
shot with his carbine Kim Yung Ho, 3 year old (west-
ern count 2 years of age) son of Kim Chang Jin 
residing at house No. 442, Soongin-dong, Inchon, 
who was playing on an oil pipe. (July 11, 1957 issue 
of Chosun Ilbo.) Local Police report No. 3,422 on 
this case, presented to the "Security Bureau" said, 
"While the American soldier was playing with the 
baby, Yung Ho, his carbine was fired by accident and 
the bullet went through the baby's head." (July 15, 
1957 issue of Hankook Ilbo.) 
However, according to a Hankook Ilbo report 
from the spot quoting a local witness, it was not con-
firmed that the American soldier played with the 
baby, but it was established that he shot at the head 
of the baby. (Hankook Ilbo of July 15, 1957.) 
The result of the investigation conducted by the 
US Army side was made public on the 19th through 
the US 8th Army. According to the announcement 
Pic Ronald Fasset committed an accidental homicide 
and he would be court-martialed accordingly. The Ame-
rican military tribunal decided to acquit him and only 
imposed a penalty of pay-cut for three months upon 
him. (Seoul Shinmoon of Sept. 30, 1957) 
At about 4:40 p.m. on August 25, 1957, a few 
days after the incident, 18 year old Cho Byung Kil 
who lived at house No. 135, Soongeui-dong, Inchon, 
was killed by the bullet fired by Plc Martin Mills be-
longing to the "K" Detachment of the Guard Unit of 
the 21st Port Command. The Korean boy was swim-
ming with his friends in a saltern reservoir on the 
outskirt of Inchon.

Concerning this incident, the authorities of the 
8th Army made an official announcement on the 26th 
saying that the shooting at Cho Byung Ku, who was 
swimming in Inchon, by Plc Martin Mills of the 
Guard Unit of the Port Command of the US Army 
was an accident resulting from the shooting for a 
warning against approaching an oil pipe. 
Hankook Ilbo of Aug. 28 reported about this in-
cident as follows: 
Over one hundred youth and children were swim-
ming in the Yonghyun-dong reservoir on the after-
noon of the 25th. 
Li Jung Woo, a witness of the day's incident, said, 
"Martin .Mills threw stones at the swimming children 
at first. The children swam away and climbed up to 
the western bank. The American soldier leveled his 
M-1 rifle for two or three minutes at them who were 
in some 80 meters distance looking toward him, and 
pulled the trigger. Two bullets dropped in the water 
and the third one hit Cho Byung Nil." 
A joint investigation was conducted by the authori-
ties concerned of the Kyonggi Provincial Police and 
the officers concerned of the US Army stationed in 
the area. 
At first the US Army side insisted that the shoot-
ing by martin Mills was a legitimate act of a guard, 
but at 2 p.m. on the 27th it agreed that Cho Byung 
Ku l was shot without any reason and Pfc. Martin 
Mills should be dealt with by law at a court martial. 
Notwithstanding this, on Sept. 24th, a US court 
martial sentenced Plc Martin Mills to two months 
confinement at hard labour and a fine of 30 dollars 
per Month for a period of 3 months on the charge 
Of "involuntary man-slaughter and failure to obey a 
lawful order." 
Disregarding even the agreement reached after the 
joint investigation, the court martial alleged that Plc 
Martin Mills fired blank shots for warning the swim-
ming Korean children not to approach the oil pipe. 
? 26 ? 
Seeing no result, it went on, he shot into the water but 
the bullet bounced in the water and hit the abdomen 
of Cho Byung Nil. 
This court decision utterly ignores the fact that a 
guard can only shoot towards the air for warning. 
(Kyunghyang Shinmoon of Sept. 26, 1957.) 
While this killing of a boy was stirring South Ko-
rean public opinion, another shooting of a middle 
school boy took place at the Kimchun Railway Station 
in North Kyungsang Province. 
At about 8:30 a.m. of Oct. 3, Song Joon Won, 16 
years of age and a third year student of the Keumre-
ung middle school, and three other boys were crossing 
the compound of the Kinichun Railway Station for a 
short-cut on their way to school. At that time US 
boxcar train No. 126 halted at the northern end of the 
platform for a repair, sireching far out to the com-
pound. The boys passed by the end of the train. At 
this time, Raymond L. Bailey, an M.P. of the "B" 
company, 728th US M.P. Unit, who was guarding the 
train, pulled out a revolver and shot at those boys 
without any rhyme or reason. The American M.P. 
shot again at running boys and the second bullet hit 
the thigh of Song Joon Won and killed him. 
Bailey, the murderer, hid himself in a "ROK" M.P. 
unit, which gave him protection and transferred him 
to the US Army CID. 
In the close wake of the shooting, numerous villag-
ers ran onto the scene and launched a demonstration 
in demand of the handing over of the criminal to the 
Koreans, and thus a serious situation was created for 
a time. 
As to this murder case, the US Eighth Army au-
thorities announced that "Bailey shouted halt in Ko-
rean" when the Korean students allegedly hung onto 
the train and that "he fired one shot into the air and, 
when they ran, fired on the ground in the general 
direction of the fleeing youths." 
However, the results of an investigation by a

"ROK-US joint investigation group" consisting of 
personnel of the "Provincial Police Criminal Investiga-
tion Section" and US Second CID in Taegu as well as 
the testimony of a student named Li Kit Si (16 years 
of age) who witnessed the incident proved that the 
announcement of the US Eighth Army was apart 
from the truth. 
The South Korean paper Hankook Ilbo said that 
Bailey's allegation about the student hanging on the 
train was totally groundless and that the students 
were only passing the shortcut taken by hundreds of 
students every day and, therefore, there was no reas-
on for them to be ordered to halt. Though it was al-
leged that the first shot was fired into the air, investi-
gations proved that it was fired at the boy from be-
hind, at a distance of 72 meters, the paper added. 
Both the first bullet, which was allegedly fired into 
the air, and the second one, which was said to have 
been fired on the ground, left shot-holes on a wall of 
a nearby briquette factory covered with barrel iron 
plates. (Hankook Ilbo, Oct. 8, 1957) 
According to the testimonies given at the court-
martial by Li Kil Si $ Chung Woon Do, 46-year-old 
coal and water supply man, and another witness nam-
ed Chun Choon Dol (40 years of age), they heard no 
order to halt and only saw the G.I. firing. (Seoul 
Shinmoon, Oct. 30, 1957) 
A US Army Master Sergeant who investigated 
the spot of incident also stated that the barrel iron 
plate behind the spot bore two bullet-holes," thus 
disproving the statement of Bailey to the effect that 
one shot was fired into the air. 
Though facts proved that the US soldier committed 
an intentional murder, the US. Army court-martial 
convicted him of "accidented homicide" and sentenc-
ed him to "nine months confinement at hard labour, a 
bad conduct discharge and loss of all pay and allow-
ances."(Kyunghyang Shinmoon, Oct. 30, 1957) 
With regard to this incident, Chosun Ilbo wrote: 
? 28 ? 
"Recently there have been a, steady stream ot Incidents 
of shooting committed by US soldiers in the capital 
and in various localities ? Pajoo, Kunsan, Inchon 
and other areas. And, now, a US M.P. fired bullets at 
young students for no reason and killed one of them. 
This sparked a near riot by citizens, who demanded 
that Bailey be turned over to them." 
Hankook Ilbo said on Oct. 8, 1957, that "what is 
felt in this area is that only- a severe punishment of 
the murderer will mitigate the anger of the people" 
and that "the US Army authorities should stop their 
perverse, crafty apology." It added that "this incident 
aroused the anger of the inhabitants there.... and they 
were on the verge of staging a reproduction of the 
Taipei anti-US riot." 
Stamping the blood-stained ground, the father of 
the victim said: "As I am uneducated, I sent my son 
to school at all cost. This fatal day he had only a 
spoonful of boiled barley before going to school. If I 
had known he would die like this, I would have fed 
him to his fill." 
This was not the first atrocity committed by US 
soldiers against innocent children and young people. 
And this is not the culmination of their cruelty and 
cold-bloodedness either. 
Below we cite some of the atrocities committed by 
them prior to this. 
On Jan. 12; 1956, on the street of ivioonrai-dong, 
Yongdungpo district, Seoul, a lorry driver of the US 
10th Artillery unit killed with a pistol 20-year-old 
Chang Kap Joon who asked him to give a lift. (Kyung-

3. Other US Army Atrocities Against South Korean 
People 
Apart from the atrocities against women and 
youth, the US Army in South Korea has been com-
mitting murder, beating, robbery, fraudulence, vio-
lence and other outrageous acts more frequently with 
every passing day, since with the mass violation and 
plunder case of the US M P. in Pajoo in April last. 
In the Pajoo incident of April 16, last year, 80 
US MPs attacked in the broad daylight Yongjoo-dong, 
Yunbong-ri, Choonai myun, Pajoo county, Kyonggi 
province. They ransacked 184 private houses includ-
ing Baik Bong In's, and robbed the villagers of 2,324 
items of goods amounting to roughly 3 5 million hwan 
in market price. 
Here is how the incident first broke out. A Korean 
boy Yoon Bok Ryong (age 18) of the said village, who 
was leading a miserable life as a shoe-shine boy, gave 
a US 5 dollar note to American M P. Kelles of the 
- 35 -

24th Division for the American cigarettes which the 
M.P. had promised to buy him. Several days passed. 
Yoon Bok Ryong demanded the M.P. to give him the 
promised cigarettes, but the latter flatly refused this. 
Then Yoon Bok Ryong asked the M.P. to pay back 
the 5 dollar. The M.P. refused this, too, and even beat 
Yoon up. 
On the other hand, Smith, M.P. Captain and Com-
mander of the M.P. Company to which the M.P. be-
longed, mobilized 80 men of his company to attack 
the afore-mentioned village. (Tonga Ilbo of April 23, 
1957) 
The M.P. Commander of the 8th US Army describ-
ed it as a lawful act. 
In this connection the "Security Bureau" of the 
Syngman Rhee puppet government, pointing out the 
unjust attitude of the US Army, lodged a protest a-
gainst the 8th US Army, but it was of no avail. 
Even the South Korean "National Assembly" call-
ed for making a strong protest against the US military 
authorities. 
Kim Dal Ho, member of the "National Assembly" 
denounced the case saying, "The mass violation by 
the 80 US MPs, who are supposed to maintain military 
discipline, and their insincere attitude toward the case 
are so humiliating." 
In March, this year, an incident took place in which 
a farmer was beaten up by a group of American 
soldiers. On March 8, 1958, at 1 p.m., corp. Kelly and 
three of his colleagues belonging to the 6147th US 
Air Corps stationed at Kimpo, Kyonggi province, 
saw farmer Li Jung Pyo (age 63) pick up a piece of 
kioard near the Air Corps on his way home from field 
work, and beat him with clubs for one hour on the 
charge of being a robber. The farmer fell unconscious 
with two ribs on his right side broken and his body 
covered with cuts and bruises. (Sege Tongshin, 
March 13, 1958)

mitteed after the Armistice Agreement:

arms, plundered goods worth some 6,000 hwan. 
Coming out of the shop, they stabbed passers-by Kim 
Duk Rim (age 35 living at No. 22, Third Street, Tai-
chang-dong) on the back, and Pak Tai Woo (age 37,

favourably." No explanatory remarks are necessary 
in showing the shamelessness and traitorousness of 
these words. Had he had even an iota of conscience, 
he would not have defended the cruel murderers with 
such heat. 
? The unheard of atrocities committed by the US 
Army in South Korea are neither "accidental," nor 
are they "troubles between individuals." 
During the ten odd years since the US Army oc-
cupied South Korea, not a single day passed without 
an innocent Korean being insulted, robbed or killed 
by the US Army. This is clear even from the above-
quoted far-from-complete data. 
The unbearable national humiliation, agony and 
disaster the South Korean people are undergoing are 
beyond description. It is not without reason that South 
Korea, today, which is under the US occupation, is 
called a living hell. 
These are what the Americans, who post them-
selves as "civilized people," are doing in South Korea 
at a time when the cosmic journey became feasible. 
How could we tolerate further repetition of such 
atrocities? An end must be immediately put to the 
atrocities of the US Army in South Korea and the 
South Korean people must be delivered from these 
terrible conditions at the earliest date. 
This can be realized only by the instant withdrawal 
of the US Army and the peaceful unification of Korea. 
This is why the Government of the D.P.R.K., in its 
statement issued on Feb. 5 of this year, once again 
clarified its program for the peaceful unification of 
Korea ? the most reasonable program for its realiza-
tion through the withdrawal of all foreign troops and 
all-Korean elections on a democratic basis. These pro-
posals included in the statement of the Government 
must be realized at the earliest date. This is the ardent 
aspiration of the entire Korean people, and this ac-
cords with the desire of all the peace-loving people 
the world over.

RACIAL SEGREGATION 
In 1946, the peoples of the differ-
ent nations of the world assembled 
and pledged to work for the promo-
tion of world peace and world com-
munity. Among other things, they 
pledged to reaffirm faith in funda-
mental human rights and in the 
dignity and worth of the human 
person. Yet there are still some 
advanced countries who in utter dis-
regard of their pledge and of repeat-
ed injuctions from the U.N. do not 
even endorse the principle that 
law must not distinguish between 
human beings on the grounds of 
race.

In every country citizens enjoy 
the exercise of certain privileges in 
return for the fulfilment of certain 
obligations. These privileges in-
clude freedom of speech, thought 
and faith, immunity of one's home, 
freedom of movement, equal op-
portunities in education, free choice 
of employment, access to the 
courts, etc. within the limits 
prescribed by the law. 
Yet for decades the intensity of 
racial segregation in the Union of 
South Africa and the United States 
has been increasing. The class of 
white settlers who rule the Union 
of South Africa has been enforcing 
more and more restrictions on the 
coloured natives. 
In addition to previous measures 
taken, the 1956 session of the South 
4_. 
Africa Parliament was largely 
devoted to legislation on racial 
questions. Important measures a-
dopted included the Industrial 
Conciliation Bill which forbade the 
formation of racially-mixed trade 
unions and provided for the division 
of existing mixed unions into 
separate racial bodies. The natives' 
right of access to the courts was 
also restricted. 
Early this year an act was pas-
sed by which the population of the 
Union will be divided into white, 
coloured Asiatic and natives. As 
a result of this procedure many of 
the white people descended from 
coloured parents were considered 
coloured and thus removed into a 
completely different social order 
and racial group ? with all the 
humiliations and indignities that 
follow in the wake of racial reclas-

T-
sification. They have to give up, 
social contracts and face ostracism 
from people who have regarded 
them as white. They also have to 
live in coloured areas, their children 
are taken away from white schools 
and transplanted into institutions 
that cater for the non-whites. They 
woke up to find that the 
? whites only >> notices in public 
places applied to them too. 
Any normal human being would 
revolt against the indignities piled_ 
upon the coloured natives of the 
country by the white settlers who 
had come in as masters and reduced 
the original inhabitants of the 
country to the status of slaves and 
menial servants and kept apart lest 
they contaminate the more fortunate 
whites who come from a superior 
race.

In 1956, the authorities of Cape-
town announced that apartheid 
( segregation) would be enforced on 
many of the city's bus and tram 
routes by order of the National 
Transport Commission which had 
directed that certain seats on public 
vehicles in a number of routes in 
the Cape Peninsula should be 
reserved exclusively for European 
passengers. 
The same year the Capetown 
City Council adopted without op-
position a proposal to provide 
separate facilities for Europeans 
and non-Europeans in amenities 
and offices under municipal control. 
Natives of the High Commission 
Territory are forbidden to enter 
Urban areas without permits.

Coloured voters are placed on a 
.separate electoral roll. 
Moreover, an act was passed 
establishing work camps for ? idle 
and undesirable >> native youth but 
the Natives Amendment Act (1956) 
empowered municipalities to banish 
without trial any native whose 
presence was considered ? detri-
mental to the maintenance of 
peace and order ?. 
It is noteworthy that these laws 
not only apply to the coloured 
natives but also to the Indian and 
Pakistani community in South 
Africa. 
Noteworthy also is the fact that 
the outrageous difference in the 
.treatment of whites and non-whites 
_ 8 _ 
also applies to the wages received 
by workmen. A coloured family 
whose members all have a job earn 
altogether less than can keep them 
above starvation level. ? ? ? 
The problem of seg'regation in 
South Africa was submitted to the 
U.N. on more than one occasion. 
The U.N. condemned the Union 
government's racial policies saying 
that South Africa was almost the 
only country in the world which 
did not at least endorse the princip-
le that law must not distinguish 
between human beings on grounds 
of race. It repeatedly appealed to 
South Africa to revise its apartheid 
policy in the light of the principles 
and purposes of the U.N. Charter 
and world opinion on the grounds 
that no U.N. member can justifiably 
be excused from trying to fulfil its

U.N. Charter pledge to work 
towards the observance of human 
rights and fundamental freedom. 
In protest to what it termed 
interference in its domestic af-
fairs ? the Union of South Africa 
withdraw from the U.N. in 1956. 
This is the situation of negroes in 
South Africa. In the U.S.A. though 
they enjoy a slightly better lot, 
their situation is no less revolting. 
The system of segregation is not 
even questioned. It has been pract-
iced for so long that any attempt at 
integration is very strongly op-
posed. In the Deep South no non-
white would dare to sit at the 
counter in a ? white ? restaurant. 
No non-white would even in jest 
climb the first step of a ? white ) 
dance-hall in the South.

The recent crisis at Little Rock 
shows which way the wind 
blows in the country that is the 
champion of democracy. A mob 
stirred by Governor Faubus of 
Arkansas, stood in the way of nine 
Negro youngsters who, by court 
order, were entitled to join 2,000 
whites at Little Rock Central High 
School. At the opening of the 
school year he called out the 
National Guard against school 
integration. Caught in this em-
barrasing situation, President 
Eisenhower ordered the use of U.S. 
Armed forces to uphold the law 
of the land in Little Rock. The 
ground and air forces of the Ar-
kansas National Guard were 
placed in federal service safely out 
of the hands of Governor Orval 
Faubus who had used them to stop 
integration in the schools.

Despite the Supreme Court's 
ruling that Little Rock Central High 
School must proceed immediately 
with its programme of integration, 
Governor Faubus ordered closed 
the senior high schools in order to 
avoid the impending violence and 
disorder which would occur, and 
to preserve the peace of the com-
munity. 
A quick glance at the negroes' 
right to ,employment will show that 
despite the fact that they are en-
titled by law to free choice of 
employment they actually have ac-
cess only to the lower occupations. 
Though their qualifications may be 
equal or superior to those of their 
white countrymen they still have 
to fight for their rights in an equal 
opportunity to participate in the 
economic development financed by 
the federal government. 
CASES IN POINT 
Azeglia Barthelemy married 
Tony Rice (white) at New Orleans 
in 1920. She had borne him seven 
children before he definitely desert-
ed her in 1931. In 1946 he 
sold the house where she and her 
seven children lived to a certain 
Mrs. Eileen Ryan who produced a 
judgment ordering the eviction of 
the wife and her children from the 
house. 
The wife appealed from this 
judgment and demanded the invali-
dation of the sale contract on the 
plea that it emanated fron. a non-
Owner, considering that she herself 
was a co-partner with the seller in 
the ownership of th-e?hou'se, in 'virtue

of the marriage contract and the 
fact that the house was registered in 
her name and that of her husband. 
Consequently, it was not proper 
that he should sell the whole house 
individually, as he would thus be 
considered as having disposed of 
property which was not his own and 
the sale contract would be null and 
void. 
Mrs. Ryan in a rejoinder 
maintained that the woman who al-
leged to be a wife was not consid-
ered as such in the eye of the 
Law, for State statutes made it 
unlawful for a white man to 
marry a coloured woman and 
would not recognise such a mar-
riage. Consequently, it was not 
admissible that she should be a 
co-partner on the strenght of an 
illegal marriage. 
Mrs. Ryan furthermore proved 
that Tony Rice married that 
coloured woman without realising 
that he was violating the State 
.statutes by doing so. 
In March 1947, the New Orleans 
Court rendered judgment ordering 
the invalidation of the marriage 
contract, in accordance with the 
Louisiana State statutes and the 
immediate eviction of the wretched 
wife. 
The wife appealed from this un-
just judgment, yet it was confirmed 
by the Appeal Court.

POLITICAL RIGHTS 
A. ? Conditions in the Union 
of South Africa. 
Contrary to all constitutional 
laws and parliamentary procedure 
all the negreos and coloured people 
in the Union of South Africa, and 
their number is no fewer than 
11.000,000, have been since the 
formation of the first Union 
Government, and are still being 
denied the xercise of even the most 
elementary of the citizen's political 
rights -- those of voting, nominating 
candidates or taking part in parlai-
mentary or other elections. 
Indeed, Governments fall and 
new governments are formed, Par-
liaments are dissolved and new Par-

liamentary elections are held and 
none of these ,governments or par-
liaments; nor even any' of ,the poli-
tical parties that form the backbone 
of such governments or parlia-
ments, has ever included a single 
coloured man, the part of these 
unfortunate people being restricted 
to that of the non-lookers, and that 
for no other reason than their dark 
skin, despite th fact that they are 
the country's .real owners. 
Replying to the question whether 
it would not be 'advisable, in an 
endeav.our to placate the coloured 
. . 
masses and ,avert the disastrous 
it-  
resu s of a` calaMiiy that is und 
to happen sooner or later, as they 
will not continue to tolerate their 
being deprived of their legitimate 
rights for ever, a Union Govern-
ment _pokes-map said the coloured 
-.. ? 
people would never make any pro-
gress unless they became acclima-
tized and embraced Western cus-
toms and manners. Then, but not 
until then, he added, they could be 
looked upon as good citizens and 
granted whatever rights they prove 
themselves worthy to exercise. 
The spokesman went on to say 
that the negroes and coloured 
people were, moreover, divided 
among themselves, hating and des-
pising each other, while the Indians 
considered themselves as far supe-
rior to both. Certainly it would 
not be prudent to grant such peo-
ple the right of voting, under these 
conditions, he said, and we find it 
our duty to maintain our trustee-
ship a bit longer. 
All of which goes to show that 
depriving the negroes and coloured

people of their legitimate political 
rights is a deliberate and premedi-
tated act. 
B, ? Conditions in the United 
States. 
Many indeed were the occasions 
when the contradictory statutes of 
the various 49 American states, 
particularly in respect of those 
dealing with the negroes and other 
coloured elements, threatened tio 
break the Federation. In fact, most 
of the States believed in the ne-
cessity of liberating the negroes and 
coloured people and granting them 
all rights that place them on an 
equal footing with any other ci-
tizens, particularly political rights. 
The Nora-"ern States were so pres-
sing in their demand that the South-
ern States began seriously to con-
___ 22 
sider the question of separation, but 
after a grave dispute they finally 
decided to concede the Northern 
States demand in respect of the 
political status of their coloured 
inhabitants, but procrastinated in 
regard to other rights. 
It thus became clear to the white 
communities that by gaining their 
political rights, the coloured people 
began to exercise the right of voting 
and got busy electing their repre-
sentatives on political bodies, so 
much so indeed that they even suc-
ceeded in presenting themselves as 
candidates for the representation of 
others. 
Yet on October 21, 1957, the 
Southern Council, one of the great 
American bodies whose member-
ship consists of coloured and whites, 
_23 ? 
?

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/02/06: CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
issued a statmebt to. the effect that 
it has been noticed that the coloured 
Americans .were showing a keen 
desire to share in shouldering _poli-
tical responsibilities and are striving 
to exercise the right of :voting in 
increasing numbers in the, coming 
elections. 
The statement then goes on to 
say that the _Council :Carried out a 
Minute inv' -eStigaii8n 'into the causes 
that prevented :the coloured people 
from the full exercise of their voting 
and '15a0JaiitentaEy. representation 
rights in the past ten 'years in the 
thirteen Southern States. 
The statement, however, neither 
explained: the -meaning of what it 
called: Lull exercise of rights nor 
gave; any. indication as to how and 
whwotild the exercise of rights 
be full or otherwise. 
?24 ? 
Perhaps the Council feared to 
incur the displeasure of the Men at 
the Helm in the Southern States. 
On March 27, 1958, an Asso-
ciated Presse message from Atlanta 
said that America was taking mea-
sures to strip the coloured people 
of all their rights. The message 
added that the Governor of the 
State of the Georgia had just signed 
a Decree-Law depriving the colour-
ed inhabitants of the right to vote 
and obliging illiterate people to 
answer a number of long questions 
as evidence that they fully under-
stand the meaning of the right of 
voting. 
If we add to the forgoing the fact 
that the number of coloured mem-
bers of the American Congress, as 
given in official records for the last

34 Congresses ? from the 46th to 
the 80th Congress ? varied bet-
ween one and two membres at the 
utmost, and that the same obstruc-
tions and obstacles are placed in 
the way of negroes and other co-
loured elements in respect of the 
exercises of their rights of voting 
and nomination to Municipal and 
Rural Councils, we can form a 
fairly accurate idea of the condi-
tions under which they are labour-
ing throughout the whole of the 
United States. 
As evidence of the extremes to 
which the coloured population of 
the U.S.A. have been reduced in 
so far as the occupation of Govern-
ment and dirilomatic posts. is con-
cerned, the following Associated 
Press message from Washington, 
_26 
dated the 18th of February, 1958, 
serves as a telling case in point : 
? The American Government 
has appointed Clifton Howarthon, 
a negro, as United States Minister 
Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extra-
ordinary to Rumania. 
? Mr. Howarthon was American 
Consul in Marseilles and is the only 
coloured official in the State De-
partment ?. 
The condition of the Negroes and 
coloured people in the United States 
would seem to be better when com-
pared with those in the Union of 
South Africa, in that they are con-
sidered as citizens and exercise 
than anything else. Yet many 
significant is the extent to which 
they enjoy other rights and privi-

leges. In fact, theirs is more of an 
internal humanitarian problem 
than anything else. Yet many 
indeed amongst them persistently 
demanded and as many are still 
pressing for equality with the 
whites. 
As recently as September 12, 
1957, Dr. Ralph Bunche, Assistant 
Secretary-General of the United 
Nations who himself is one of their 
great leaders, in a statement quoted 
by practically all news agencies, 
particularly Reuters, the United 
Press and the Associated Press, 
said the persecution of the Negroes 
and the coloured people in the 
United States, particularly in the 
Southern States, was doing great 
,harm to the reputation of the United 
States in the International field. 
Such pictures as those of White 
_ 28 _ 
1 
Americans making fun of Negroes 
could not be considered as a good 
point in public relations, he said, 
adding that the occurrence of such 
events against the coloured inha-
bitants was a matter for great re-
gret, particularly following the 
enthusiastic welcome world public 
opinion accorded to the Congress 
approval of the Civil Rights Law, 
which abolished racial discrimina-
tion. 
In the Union of South Africa, 
however, their problem is social, 
economic, humanitarian and poli-
tical combined, for the Whites 
there consider the negroes and the 
coloured people, who are the real 
owners of the land, as mere ser-
vants and slaves, no more no less.

FACTS ABOUT AFRICA AND TI1E AFRICANS... 
The struggle for freedom troughout 
Africa has become a constant nightmare to 
imperialism; a nightmare leading to the bitter 
reality of a gloomy future threatened by 
economic crisis. 
Europe as it is now, owes a great deal of 
its culture, wealth and civilization to Asia and 
Africa; the two continents which played a very 
important role in the progress of the human 
race. For example, modern art is has an 
African foundation, Greece sought inspiration 
from Africa, Rome saw Africa as a main part 
of her empire, and European Renaissance had 
some Of its roots in Africa. This continent was 
also the main centre from which the Moslem 
empire spread. The American world owes its 
initial growth to the African slave trade, which 
established capitalism in Europe later. 
The Africans who were blind to the 
ambitions of imperialisnt for the last two

centuries are now beginning to see the truth. 
They will no longer stand aggression, nor will 
they. allow imperialism to develop and flourish 
at?the,expense of theiir lives, and the welfare of 
their countries. Colonizers and exploiters ought 
now to give up the idea of taking advantage of 
the trusting Africans, and having priority for 
their interests, while depriving the owners from 
their rights. Moreover, they must reconcile 
themselves to the fact that the people of 
Africa are now hand in-glove to win their 
freedom and reclaim what is theirs. - 
. None of *us is unaware of the fact that 
Africa produces a considerable amount of 
metal and crop for the world market. But who 
among., us have given a thought as to how 
those things are produced-? Again and again 
e see long articles in European and American 
papers telling of the outstanding increase in 
the production of a number of Africa's export as 
Proof of the great success achieved. But they 
refrain from saying ?'whose. success >> and ? to 
whose benefit ?. ' - 
If we go back to the year 1903-4, when a 
group of Englishmen first acquired titles to 
the Land-of Kenya; Colonel Ewart S. Grogan, 
one of the last of that group, and was 
himself the recipient of a 200,000-acre forek 
concession parcelling out of land in Kenya; 
wrote the following statement,. ? There are two 
distinct standpoints from which I view the 
Africans. As a spectator and student of social 
evolution, I see a people infinitely wiser 
infinitely more decent, infinitely saner than 
we. The absolute logic of their life bewilders 
our distorted minds. We can never learn to 
understand them. They soon see through us. 
The second standpoint is the man in their 
midst with work to do. We are dependent upon 
their aid. To assist us they must be moulded 
in our ways. But they do not want to be, and 
yet they must. Either we give up the country 
commercially or we must make them work ?. 
Then he goes on to say, ? I have little sympathy 
.for the capitalist regime. But it is the regime 
under which we still live and till it top-heavy 
crumbles to the ground, the native too must 
;fall in line. We have stolen his land. Now 
we must steal his limbs. Compulsory labour 
is the corollary of our occupation of the 
country.?. 
This is but one example ,of the inhuman 
schemes of work that Europeans imagine they 
will succeed in carrying out. But they will soon 
find out that the people of Africa have other 
-schemes, completely different from theirs: In

the near future the white man will not be able 
to treat the natives of Africa in the same way 
he is doing now, There will be no master and 
slave, and sugar-coated policy w111 fail to 
work. 
Birds of Prey 
'Wherever there is a source of wealth in an 
African land, ?White settlers ?, as they call 
themselves, descend like birds of prey, taking 
all they can lay hands on, depriving the natives 
of what is their right, and grudging them their 
mere existence. 
Segregation 
South Africa gold and diamonds, instead 
of being a source of wealth to the natives, at-
tracted and influx of settlers and immigrants, 
who practised every kind of human injustice to 
_humiliate the .natives and take every advantage 
of their trusting nature and good will. This 
is proved by the living-conditions of the South 
African natives and the way they are .treated 
rhy the white 'settlers. 
? The -WhiteS regard the cities in Which they 
-live -as, being their oWn, and consider it neces-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
sary to do whatever they can to keep 
them exclusively their own. 
The first rule of the white cities might be 
stated; keep the Africans out unless their 
labour is needed. The second rule: they can 
work for us but not live with us. The net 
result of the application of these two rules over 
the ,years, is seen everywhere in the special 
? native ? areas, slum districts, set apart from, 
and on the periphery of the white cities. 
There are another of the same sordid 
details in the picture of these places. Algiers 
have their Bidonville (a settlement of the very 
poorest _people, crowded into huts made of 
rotting wood and beaten-out petrol tins, devoid 
of the most elementary sanitary provisions) 
Casablanca, Morocco, has its ? Carrieres Cen-
trales ?, A poverty-stricken suburb of old tin 
huts. Dakar has its Medina district housing 
150,000 Africans in make-shift dwellings lining 
alleys of loose sand. ?...Settlements. of _closely 
packed huts are to be seen on the fringes of all 
the larger towns in Fast Africa ?, states a recent 
Aritish _Royal Commission survey of the area. 
.cites an offkcial, but unpublished, report 
4e-scribing Africans employed in Nairobi, 
Kenya, in 1948 living in dangerous shacks in the

swamp, in buses parked on the roadside, and 
fourteen to the room in Punwani, two in a bed 
and the rest on the floor. 
This is how the African natives are 
rewarded for the strenuous work they do for 
the white settlers, who flourish and prosper. 
They accumulate wealth and forget that the 
poor native is entitled to a fair share of what 
his own land and soil produce by his own sweat 
and labour. 
Here is another proof of the sufferings 
the natives under imperial rule in Africa have 
to undergo : About nine miles outside Johannes-
burg lies Alexandra Township with its 80,000 
crowded tenants. Every morning and every 
night there are, long lines of Africa men and 
women waiting to board the buses that carry 
them to and &dm work in the city. A commis-
sion of inquiry in 1944 stated : 
national policy of segregation and the necessity 
for finding land needed to house Africans under 
this policy, away from the areas occupied -by 
other races, have created in South Africa the 
unique phenomenon that the lowest paid work-
ers. have to live furthest from their work ?. 
Those, it goes without saying, are the poor 
'overworked natives. 
In 1943 the bus companies incerased the 
Alexandra-Johannesburg fare from 4d. to 5d. 
Just id. more is something not worth mention-
ing, many of us might say. But little do 
we know that one penny meant so much to the 
poor worker, that every morning and every 
evening about 15,000 of men and women 
workers forming a line about three miles long, 
walked in a procession for the distance of nine 
miles twice a day to and back from work, and 
after a very hard day's work. This went on 
for nine days. At last, failing to get the 
employees to consent to pay the extra fare, the 
companies agreed to keep the fare at 4d. One 
penny more on top of starvation wages, high 
rent, soaring food costs and taxes are bound 
to create a revolutionary spirit against foreign 
rule, and rightly too. 
Restrictions to add to Misery 
Let us take the case of an African in the 
Transvaal province who wants to go to 
Johannesburg, for instance. He first has to 
produce his indentification pass. On arrival in 
Johannesburg he has to report to the pass office 
within 24 hours. There he gives up his travel 
pass and gets a permit to look for work. This 
permit is good for just six days; it may some-
times be renewed, but not more than twice. If

is not renewed, or if he doesn't find a job within 
the allotted time he must leave Johannesburg or 
face arrest. If he does find a job, he then has 
his service contract reigstered. He must report 
to have his registration renewed every month. 
Cross Currents 
At the end of the 'World War II, bright 
promises were made that Africa shall march 
forward with the rest of the world. This was 
declared at the first Trade World Union 
Congress held in Paris in October, 1945. That 
was what Jono Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah 
and others said at the Fifth Pan-African 
Congress held later the same month in 
Birmingham, England and presided over by 
Dr. W.E. Burghardt Du Bois, founder of the 
Pan-African Movement in 1919. 
They said, ? We are unwilling to starve 
any longer, While doing the world's drudgery, 
in order to support, by our poverty and 
ignorance, a false aristocracy and a discredited 
imperialism ?, the Pan-African Congress 
declaration read : ? All colonies must be free 
from foreign imperialist control, whether 
political or economic ?. 
1.0 
Against this came the demand from Africa 
and Africans to produce more and more of the 
the raw materials required by Europe and 
America, to recoup the imperialist losses 
sustained in Asia, and to remain subservient. 
Thus arose the series of revolts, strikes and 
boycotts throughout Africa in the years im-
mediately following the war, and in subsequent 
years. 
To have a clear picture of the European 
American postwar rush for Africa's resources, 
one must first understand something of the 
general dimensions of what the whole long 
history of foreign exploitation of these resources 
has amounted to. 
Let us just consider the mineral wealth of 
Africa. It is to be remembered that Europeans 
have been taking this from the continent for 
nearly five centuries. In 1471 the Portuguese 
first sailed around the western bridge of Africa 
to find and take away gold dust. ? The Gold 
Coast >> was the name they gave to the place 
where they found gold dust; that's the present 
Ghana. It's also a well-known fact that such 
things as gold and diamond mines produce a

limited harvest and that once they're dug out, 
they leave nothing behind but a hole in the 
ground. 
Bewildering Figures 
The total of recorded sales of gold and 
diamond in the Union of South Africa through 
the year 1955 comes to $ 13.7 billion. Nearly 
four fifths of that amount came from gold ? 
about 18,874 tons of it. Over 40 tons of 
diamonds 1 
In the Belgian Congo, the European mining 
of gold began in 1904, copper in 1911, diamonds 
and tin in 1913. Cobalt and manganese are 
other major exports. Mineral production 
averaged under $ 7 million a year in 1936-38; 
for the five years 1950-54 it averaged over $ 50 
million for a total of $ 258 million. 
The northeastern corner of Angola is 
diamond country. 
In 1945 the Director of Geological & survey 
in the Gold Coast estimated the value of the 
minerals extracted by the British from the 
British West African colonies since 1880 at 
$ 480 million, three fourths of that amount 
representing gold.

The Ashanti Goldfield Corp., wealthiest 
of the present-day mining companies in Ghana, 
was established in 1897 with a nominal capital 
of ? 250,000 ($ 700,000) and now has an issued 
capital of about $ 35 million. Up to 1954 it 
had produced some 7 million ounces of fine gold, 
today worth $ 245 million. 
Diamonds and manganese are the other 
chief mineral efforts coming from Ghana. 
In Nigeria it is mainly tin; from 1910-54 a 
half million tons of tin ore, valued at $ 336 
million, was exported. 
In Sierra Leone, it is diamonds and iron 
ore. From 1933-52 over 15 million tons of ore 
were taken, 1,328,000 tons of it were exported 
in 1956.

additional massive quantities from other areas, 
and yet they say Africa is poor. If it is the 
mass of population, they refer to, they are 
certainly right. But why should the people be

poverty-stricken when the continent's sub-soil 
yields such wealth? The answer is obvious: 
the mineral riches and the profits thereform are 
taken by non-Africans. 
It is a serious charge to make ? that the 
wealth of Africa is drained away, (writes Dr. 
Rita Hinden, a Fabian Socialist, in the Chal-
lenge of African Poverty). Minerals are one 
of Africa's precious assets, yet the mines are 
almost always operated by European capitalist 
companies, which pay dividends to their over-
seas shareholders, heavy remuneration to their 
directions, as likely as not the lion's share of 
their taxes to the British Exchequer, royalties to 
venerable but functionless companies, and 
enormous wages to local European employees. 
What remains for the African workers and for 
the African exchequers are the crumbs from the 
rich man's table. 
And a Nigerian comments: ? The fabulous 
sums drawn away from our mines alone, 
had they been at the disposal of a government 
of Nigerians, might have transformed the face 
of our country- in a decade. We would have 
had those things which we are now vainly 
seeking for: schools, factories and hospitals ?. 
14 
The Flowing Treasure 
Oil is another attraction for money makers 
in Europe, England and the United States. It 
is one of the big economic question marks in 
Africa. The search for it has been going on for 
years. So far, only Egypt has achieved a small 
regular production, yet enough to provide for 
more than two thirds of its consumption needs. 
Algeria and Morocco have yielded only a little 
fraction of Egypt's output. Elsewhere there has 
been a good deal of exploration and drilling, 
but while occasional oil traces and strikes are 
reported here and there, no substantial finds of 
the liquid gold have yet been disclosed. 
Yet with so little to show for their efforts, 
the oil companies continue their search and 
extend their concession holdings. 
? The great white hope of Algeria and 
Tunisia is oil ?, it was reported in 1953, when 
continued French political control of these 
territories was still taken for granted, and 
? millions of dollars in direct and indirect 
American money and in French francs are being 
expended in a frantic search for it ?. The vast 
Sahara region has become the new ? white 
hope >> of France. Hence the major reason why 
it fights to hold Algeria.

President Nasser's thunder-clap proclam-
ation of July 26, 1956, cancelling the Suez 
Canal Company's concession and nationalizing 
the operation of that strategic waterway 
naturally cast a sudden, heavy cloud over the 
sundry oil concessions in Egypt and the sur-
rounding area. Naturally, the cloud became 
darker and heavier with the Anglo-French 
invasion of Egypt in November. Particularly 
bleak was the immediate outlook for Anglo-
Egyptian Oilfields, the largest British com-
mercial interest remaining in Egypt with assets 
of $ 98 million including a refinery at Suez. 
Under Egyptian experts, the work is flourish-
ing. 
Awareness 
? Africans are not opposed to economic, 
industrial, commercial and political develop-
ment. On the contrary, this is welcomed. But 
they would rather forego all the benefits of 
these developments if they bring in their wake 
political and economic domination by out-
siders 
Such-was the view expressed by a deleg-
ation from Uganda which came to London 
in December, 1953. Economic expansion, the 
16 
VI 
pointed out, had not brought peace or well-
being to Africans in South Africa, nor did 
imposition of Federation for the sake of the 
same objective promise anything good for 
Africans in Rhodesia and Nyasaland. There 
was concern, the delegation stated, lest with 
the economic schemes under way in Uganda ? 
the Kilemke mines and other projects ? 
Africans... will wake up one day to find that 
they are dominated by powerful factors over 
which they have no control. 
From various sections of the continent 
comes evidence of a wide spread bitterness, 
often erupting in action and not only words. 
Hungering for a new way of life, the African 
hears and sees economic expansion schemes 
talked about and developing all around him. 
His relationship to them is almost like that of 
a poor man looking through the window of a 
rich man's restaurant. Except that the African 
is not just an onlooker; he is compelled to give 
his labour for projects which he knows full well 
are aimed at the white man's benefit. not his, 
and point to the prolongation of the white man's 
domination, not to African freedom. Professor 
Harry R. Rudin of Yale University says, ? It 
is ominous that just when the West needs 
Africa most, Africans are demanding greater 
freedom and better economic opportunities for

themselves >>. In this fundamental conflict of 
interests there is dynamite. 
A prominent member of the Malan-
Strijdom regime in South Africa, Dr. T.E. 
Donges, Minister of Interior, in 1951 put it very 
concisely: ? Regarded from the point of view 
of Europe and America, answer is still the same 
? Africa must be kept within that orbit. 
Its raw materials are the complement of the 
highly-industrialized Europe and America ?. 
On one occasion in 1951, Mr. Oliver 
Lyttelton (now Lord Chandos), criticising the 
policy of the Labour government, said : 
? Britain is living on the dollar earnings of the 
colonies, who are prevented freely converting 
their sterling into either goods or dollars, and 
must willy-nilly run up their balances ?. 
view of the often-mentioned financial 
? help >> given by Britain to her colonies through 
the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund 
and other government agencies, it should be 
mentioned in passing that, according to the 
report of Eden's Economic Secretary to the 
Treasury (May 14, 1956), in the six years 
1950-55, the colonies added ? 700 million in 
sterling balances to Britain's finances while 
18 
? 
London was providing ? 300 million in govern-
ment grants and loans to the colonies. One 
further foot-note: the larger portion of such 
loans went to the white settler territories in 
East and Central Africa whereas by far the 
largest contribution of sterling balances came 
from the West African colonies, notably 
Nigeria and the Gold Coast. 
The Congo's trade provides Belgium with 
a surplus of many millions of dollars yearly. 
Coffee, cocoa, sisal and other exports from 
Mozambique and Angola earn considerable 
sums for Portugal. 
The continuation of this arrangement 
whereby Europe is kept in spending money by 
control of the trade in Africa raw materials 
rests on two assumptions. First, it is assumed 
that Africa is and will remain a ? passive ? 
continent subject to European domination, or 
that even with the necessity of granting political 
concessions sooner or later in various areas, the 
economies of these ? liberated ? countries, as 
well as the rest of the continent, can be 
controlled as before by the metropolitan powers. 
The second assumption is that the era of 
go-it-alone colonialism is ended and that there 
19

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Co .y Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/02/06 : CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
is now required an increasing amount of 
international collaboration for the control, 
planning, investment in, and marketing of 
Africa raw material production. 
European Immigration Schemes 
One important point to Europe is to 
populate Eastern, Central and Southern 
Africa, where European settlers have already 
gone, with as many more as can be secured 
and as quickly as possible, in order to fulfill the 
\Vest's economic aims and ensure its continued 
hegemony in the continent. 
? A hundred thousand Belgian colonists 
before ten years or the Congo may well no 
longer be Belgian ?, said the Federation des As-
sociations de Colons du Congo in 1952, and 
others have set a target of 800,000 for the 
Congo's Belgian population in 50 years. ? We 
need a hundred thousand more Portuguese in 
Angola within the next ten years. Then there 
will be no non sensical talk about African 
independence in this country ?, was what a 
civil servant in that colony said. 
The white settlers, whether technicians or 
anything else, are not asked to come help train 
20 
Africans to play their part in all phases of the 
expanding productive process. On the contrary, 
they are being brought in with the objectives of 
trying to keep the existing economic relations 
between white and black permantly frozen. 
Lord Malvern defined the pattern some 20 
years ago when, as Prime Minister of South-
ern Rhodesia, he said, ? In the European areas 
the black man will be welcomed, when tempted 
by wages, he offers his services as a labourer; 
but it will be on the understanding that he shall 
merely assist and not compete with the white 
man ?. At present, since it happens that 
Africans are increasingly ? tempted ? by wages 
to keep from starving, one finds the same idea 
voiced again and again by the upholders of the 
rights of white rule. South Africa's Minister 
of Native Affairs, Dr. H.F. Verwoerd, for 
instance, states his opinion that ? Natives ?, on 
farms are no more an integral part of the 
economy than the oxen, and that South Africa 
can function industrially without economic 
integration being necessary ?. 
In Kenya, Mr. E.A. Vasey, Minister of 
Finance and Development, explains, ? Our 
economic structure developed in three horizont-
al layers: with the African providing the 
21

worker, the unskilled labourer, as the broad 
base, the Asian, the artisans and traders, as the 
middle layer; the European, with a few Asians, 
the executives and the administrators, the top 
layer. 
Segregation again 
- The line between the African's permissible 
work and that of the white artisan is often very 
finely drawn. The managing director of a 
building concern in East London, South Africa, 
received a sentence of a E 10 fine or 20 days' 
jail as a result of a government building inspect-
or having come upon one of the African 
labourers with a trowel in his hand applying 
cement. The court ignored the excuse of the 
defendant's ..attorney that said, ? My client gave 
his foreman strict instructions that the 
labourer should only use his fingers or a piece 
of wood to fill in the openings with cement, 
believing that it was legal ?. 
Can anybody call this a human act? 
The . African has a brain and physical 
strength that entitle him to the same human 
rights as any white man. The following is a 
testimony of some Rhodesian employees who 
22 
a 
have had the sense and decency to allow 
Africans to break through the racial barrier in 
industry. ? Our African crane drivers are as 
good as any European crane driver. Africans 
learn shoe machine work very quickly ? some-
times more quickly, and better, than Europeans. 
All our employees start by knowing nothing. 
Some, after 3 months, can operate turret 
lathes costing E 5,000. The individual product-
ivity of the African is equal to that of 
the European at all levels of jig operation ?. 
Obviously, it is not that the African can't 
do the job, and as well as the European, if given 
a chance; they just don't want him to except, 
sometimes, at a lower wage. 
This question of segregation will remain 
unsolved so long as a white settler is made to 
believe that his superior status in life, as measur-
ed not only against the African's status but 
against his own former less prosperous con-
dition back home, ' can be won and maintained 
only by supporting and preserving the status 
quo of white domination.

question was written by Professor Rayford W.

Logan of Howard University. It is about 
French settlers in West Africa, particularly in 
the Ivory Coast. The report says, ? Almost 
every plane and boat brings ? petits frangais ? 
who compete with Africans for jobs. Some 
Africans received 6,000 West African francs, 
a month for doing the same work for which 
Frenchmen received about four times as much. 
Sometimes Africans were discharged after 
training Frenchmen for a job. 
Race conflict is the least that one can 
expect after such behaviour and ill treatment. 
Africans on the Move 
The New York Times (April 7, 1952) 
reported how ? several thousand non-whites 
marched in Fordsburg Freedom Square 
(Johannesburg). The defiance volunteers were 
carefully selected and instructed. They went 
forth in groups to enter the ? Reserved for 
Whites ? sections of post offices, railway 
stations, and other public places. And when 
arrested, they went to jail without protest. In 
cities and towns all over the country batches 
of volurkeers went into action. Women 
marched along beside the men and were of key 
24 
importance in the success of the campaign. It 
is true that the campaign failed of its objective 
of winning equality and justice but it succeeded 
in cementing unity of action toward democrakic 
goals embracing all national and racial' sections 
of the population. 
The Defiance Movement spread over into 
Northern Rhodesia. In 1953, The African 
Congress of that country began a Challenge 
the Colour Bar campaign in the main towns. 
As crowds of Africans watched, ? defiers ? 
entered post offices, shops, caf? and public 
places reserved to whites. In succeeding years, 
butcher shops and other stores were taught the 
necessity of serving Africans over the counter 
side by side with whites instead of on the out-
side through special hatches as had been done 
before. 
The one weapon that won the battle for 
the defiers was ? the boycotting >> of those 
stores and shops. The whites could hardly 
believe that Africans were capable of such 
planning, organization and discipline.

The gdgca Opp. Problem 
Once, about four years ago, when Lord 
M.alvern_was Governor of ;Southern Rhodesia, 
Acknowledged that, ? one criticism against 
? colonialism ? which had substance, was that 
raw materials had been taken away for the 
industries of 'distant countries at a price which 
.clid not leave enough in the country of origin 
for .the provision of adequate health, education 
and other social services ?. He immediately 
Added that this was now being changed with 
,thedeyelopment of 'secondary industries in the 
country. But !a year an,d a half later, we find 
him saying, ?,It is the abject poverty of the mas-
ses , which is the cause of the trouble. We 
have,not ,the money ,to educate them. Later, in 
1956, after all the appropriations for the Kariba 
,dam, railroad expansian and other capital 
works, Mr. R.S. Garfield Todd, Southern 
Rhodesia's Prime Minister, spoke of the 
inability of the Government to raise the funds 
reasonably required to develop... the African 
population. 
*hy cogldn't they raise the funds required 
for education matters, etc. ?The Rhodesians are 
not to be classed among the poorer countries 
of Africa. The real reason is that the African 
1 
is cheated. He is cheated first by the copper 
companies and other employees who would 
rather pay extra taxes on their profits to the 
government than give their African workers 
more money. He is cheated also by a govern-
ment which spends its revenues to provide 
facilities for the further expansion of the copper 
and other business interests, and to promote 
the size and welfare of the white population. 
The State of African education in 
Rhodesia is typical of that in all settler-ruled 
territories, though perhaps a little better than in 
some. 
A Belgian commission which surveyed the 
Congo's schools not very long ago, reported 
how African children, supposed to be getting 
some primary education, were found to be 
spending their time attending to the coffee, 
peanuts and other crops grown for the market. 
On Kenya's European farms in 1954, there 
were officially reported to be 39,784 children 
employed, most of them on monthly contracts 
and the rest as day labourers, resident labour-
ers, or domestics. A Rhodesian newspaper 
reports: ? Many industrial and commercial 
firms make use of child labour in and around

:Salisbury. The age of the children in some 
case is about six to seven years... Many of 
them look miserable and show of malnutrition. 
Nearly all these children are illiterate and have 
never seen the door of a school ?. 
What future is awaiting those children 
when they grow up? 
The Road to Freedom 
Prime Minister Nkrumah was asked in an 
Edward R. Murrow television interview in 
April, 1956, what he thought was Africa's most 
urgent need today. His answer was, ?...I think 
the first essential thing is political emancipation, 
because once they are politically emancipated, 
they are in the position to develop their own 
-country in a way in which they think fit ?. 
What the Africans demand, can be put in 
lour. words: ? Africa for the Africans 
Africans will not be held down by force 
;any longer. What could be a stronger proof 
_than the protests in ,West Africa Over the 
?ending of 30,000 Senegalese to help the French 
28 
1 
fight Algerians? Some of the Senegalese sur-
rendered and changed into uniforms of the 
North African Army of Liberation, which in 
turn pledged solidarity with all Africans in their 
struggle for independence. 
The people of Africa have their future to 
build. The Cold War measuring-rod of United 
States objectives in that continent is out-dating 
and self-defeating. If losing Africa means its 
ceasing to be the special preserve of Western 
interests, then it is as certainly lost as Asia. The 
leaders of the West, let us hope, will face up to 
the necessity of getting along by means other 
than on the backs of the Africans.

FACTS ABOUT ARICA AND THE AFRICANS... 
The struggle for freedom troughout 
Africa has become a constant nightmare to 
imperialism; a nightmare leading to the bitter 
reality of a gloomy future threatened by 
economic crisis. 
Europe as it is now, owes a great deal of 
its culture, wealth and civilization to Asia and 
Africa; the two continents which played a very 
important role in the progress of the human 
race. For example, modern art is has an 
African foundation, Greece sought inspiration 
from Africa, Rome saw Africa as a main part 
of her empire, and European Renaissance had 
some of its roots in Africa. This continent was 
also the main centre from which the Moslem 
einpire spread. The American world owes its 
initial growth to the African slave trade, which 
established capitalism in Europe later. 
The Africans who were blind to the 
ambitions of imperialism for the last two

centuries are now beginning to see the truth. 
They will no longer stand aggression, nor will 
they allow imperialism to develop and flourish 
'at the expense of their lives, and the welfare of 
their countries. Colonizers and exploiters ought 
now to give up the idea of taking advantage of 
the trusting Africans, and having priority for 
their interests, while depriving the owners from 
.their rights. Moreover, they must reconcile 
,themselves to the fact that the people of 
Africa are now hand in-glove to win their 
freedom and reclaim what is theirs. 
None of us is unaware of the fact that 
Africa produces a considerable amount of 
metal and crop for the world market. But who 
among, us have given a thought as to how 
those things are produced-? Again and 'again 
Nive see long articles in European and American 
papers telling of the outstanding increase in 
the production of a number of Africa's export as 
proof of the great success achieved. But they 
refrain from saying ? whose success >> and ? to 
whose benefit ?. 
If we go back to the year 1903-4, when a 
group of Englishmen first acquired titles to 
The Land Of Kenya; Colonel Ewart S. Grogan, 
one of the last of that group, and was 
himself the recipient of a 200,000-acre forest 
concession parcelling out of land in Kenya, 
wrote the following statement, ? There are two 
distinct standpoints from which I view the 
Africans. As a spectator and student of social 
evolution, I see a people infinitely wiser 
infinitely more decent, infinitely saner than 
we. The absolute logic of their life bewilders 
our distorted minds. We can never learn to 
understand them. They soon see through us. 
The second standpoint is the man in their 
midst with work to do. We are dependent upon 
their aid. To assist us they must be moulded 
in our ways. But they do not want to be, and 
yet they must. Either we give up the country 
commercially or we must make them work ?. 
Then he goes on to say, ? I have little sympathy 
for the capitalist regime. But it is the regime 
under which we still live and till it top-heavy 
crumbles to the ground, the native too must 
fall in line. We have stolen his land. Now 
we must steal his limbs. Compulsory labour 
is the corollary of our occupation of the 
country ?. 
This is but one example of the inhuman 
schemes of work that Europeans imagine they 
will succeed in carrying out. But they will soon 
find out that the people of Africa have other 
schemes, completely different from theirs. In

???? 
the near future the white man will not be able 
to treat the natives of Africa in the same way 
he is doing now. There will be no master and 
slave, and sugar-coated policy will fail to 
work. 
Birds of Prey 
Wherever there is a source of wealth in an 
African land, ? White settlers ?, as they call 
themselves, descend like birds of prey, taking 
.all they can lay hands on, depriving the natives 
Of what is their right, and grudging them their 
mere existence. 
Segregation 
South Africa gold and diamonds, instead 
of being a source of wealth to the natives, ,at-
tracted and influx of settlers and immigrants, 
who practised every kind of human injustice to 
humiliate the natives and take every advantage 
Of their trusting nature and good will. This 
is proved by the living-conditions of the South 
African natives and the way they are treated 
by the white settlers. 
f: The whites regard the cities in which they 
live as being their own, and consider it neces-
6 
sary to do whatever they can to keep 
them exclusively their own. 
The first rule of the white cities might be 
stated : keep the Africans out unless their 
labour is needed. The second rule: they can 
work for us but not live with us. The net 
result of the application of these two rules over 
the years, is seen everywhere in the special 
? native ? areas, slum districts, set apart from, 
and on the periphery of the white cities. 
There are another of the same sordid 
details in the picture of these places. Algiers 
have their Bidonville (a settlement of the very 
poorest people, crowded into huts made of 
rotting wood and beaten-out petrol tins, devoid 
of the most elementary sanitary provisions) 
Casablanca, Morocco, has its ? Carrieres Cen-
trales ?, a poverty-stricken suburb of old tin 
huts. Dakar has its Medina district housing 
150,000 Africans in make-shift dwellings lining 
alleys of loose sand- ?...Settlements of closely 
packed huts are to be seen on the fringes of all 
the larger towns in East Africa ?, states a recent 
British Royal Commission survey of the .area. 
It cites an official, but unpublished, report 
describing - Africans employed in Nairobi, 
Kenya. in 1948 living in dangerous shacks in the

swamp, in buses parked on the roadside, and 
fourteen to the room in Punwani, two in a bed 
and the rest on the floor. 
This is how the African natives are 
rewarded for the strenuous work they do for 
the white settlers, who flourish and prosper. 
They accumulate wealth and forget that the 
poor native is entitled to a fair share of what 
his own land and soil produce by his own sweat 
and labour. 
Here is another proof of the sufferings 
the natives under imperial rule in Africa have 
to undergo : About nine miles outside Johannes-
burg lies Alexandra Township with its 80,000 
crowded tenants. Every morning and every 
night there are long lines of Africa men and 
women waiting to board the buses that carry 
them to and from work in the city. A commis-
sion of inquiry in 1944 stated : ? ...The 
national policy of segregation and the necessity 
for finding land needed to house Africans under 
this policy, away from the areas occupied by 
other races, have created in South Africa the 
unique phenomenon that the lowest paid work-
ers have to live furthest from their work ?. 
Those, it goes without saying, are the poor 
overworked *natives. 
8 
.1 
In 1943 the bus companies incerased the 
Alexandra-Johannesburg fare from 4d. to 5d. 
Just Id. more is something not worth mention-
ing, many of us might say. But little do 
we know that one penny meant so much to the 
poor worker, that every morning and every 
evening about 15,000 of men and women 
workers forming a line about three miles long, 
walked in a procession for the distance of nine 
miles twice a day to and back from work, and 
after a very hard day's work. This went on 
for nine days. At last, failing to get the 
employees to consent to pay the extra fare, the 
companies agreed to keep the fare at 4d.. One 
penny -more on top. of starvation Wages, high 
rent, Soaring food costs and taxes ,are bound 
to create a revolutionary spirit against foreign 
rule, and rightly too. 
Restrictions to add to Misery 
Let us take the case of an African in the 
Transvaal province who wants to go to 
Johannesburg, for instance. He first has to 
Produce his indentification pass. On arrival in 
Johannesburg he has to report to the pass office 
within 24 hours. There he gives up his travel 
pass and gets a permit to look for work. This 
permit is good for just six days; it may some-
times be renewed, but not more than twice. If

tht allotted Hine lid !must leave Johannesburg or 
face, arrest. If he does find a job, he then has 
his serVice contract reigstered. He must report 
ta ,have -his registration renewed every month. 
, 
Cross Currents' 
At -the end of the World- War II, bright 
promises were made that Africa shall march 
forward with. the-.iest.of the world. This was 
declared at the first Trade World Union 
Congress held in Paris in October, 1945. That 
1:Vas what -jonwRenyatta, ,Kwame Nkrumah 
and others said -at the Fifth Pan-African 
Congress held -later the same- month in 
Birmingham, England and -presided 'over by 
Dr. W.E. Burghardt Du Bois, founder of the 
Pan-African Movement in 1919. 
They said, ? We are unwilling to starve 
any longer, While doing the world's drudgery-, 
in order 'to support, by ' our poverty and 
ignorance, a false aristocracy and a discredited 
imperialism ?, the Pan-African Congress 
declaration read: ? All colonies must' be free 
from foreign imperialist control, -whether 
Political or economic ?. 
10 
nprlassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
Against this came the demand from Africa 
and Africans to produce more and more of the 
the raw materials required by Europe. and 
America, to recoup the imperialist losses 
sustained in Asia, and to remain subservient. 
Thus arose the series of revolts?strikes and 
boycotts throughout Africa in the years im-
mediately following the war, and in subsequent 
years,. 
_ To have a clear picture of the European 
Ariiericzin postwar rush for Africa's resources, 
one thust first understand -something of the 
general dimensions of what the whole long 
histdry of foreign exploitation of these resources 
liaamounted to. 
Let us just consider the mineral wealth of 
Africa. It is to be remembered that Europeans 
have been taking this from the continent for 
nearly five centuries. In 1471 the Portuguese 
first sailed around the western bridge of Africa 
to -find and take away gold dust. ? The Gold 
Coast >> was the name they gave to the place 
where they found gold dust; that's the present 
Ghana. It's also a well-known fact that such 
things as gold and diamond mines produce a 
11 
50-Yr 2014/02/06: CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/02/06: CIA-RDP81-01043R003300160001-3 
limited harvest and that once they're dug out, 
they leave nothing behind but a hole in the 
ground. 
Bewildering Figures 
The total of recorded sales of gold and 
diamond in the Union of South Africa through 
the year 1955 comes to $ 13.7 billion. Nearly 
four fifths of that amount came from gold ? 
about 18,874 tons of it. Over 40 tons of 
diamonds! 
In the Belgian Congo, the European mining 
gold began in 1904, copper:in 1911, diamonds 
arid tin in 1913. Cobalt and manganese are 
other `Major exports. . Mineral production 
averaged under '$ 7 million a year in 1936-38; 
for the five years 1950-54 it averaged over $ 50 
million for a total of $ 258 million. 
The northeastern corner of Angola, is 
diamond country. 
In 1945 the Director of Geological & survey 
in the. Gold Coast estimated the value- of the 
minerals extracted by the British from the 
British West African Colonies since 1880 at 
$480' million, three fourths of that amount 
representing gold. 
12 
The Ashanti Goldfield Corp., wealthiest 
of the present-day mining companies in Ghana, 
was established in 1897 with a nominal capital 
of E 250,000 ($ 700,000) and now has an issued 
capital of about $ 35 million. Up to 1954 it 
had produced some 7 million ounces of fine gold, 
today worth $ 245 million. 
Diamonds and manganese are the other 
chief mineral efforts coming from Ghana. 
In Nigeria it is mainly tin; from 1910-54 a 
half million tons of tin ore, valued at $ 336 
million, was exported. 
In Sierra Leone, it is diamonds and iron 
ore. From 1933-52 over 15 million tons of ore 
were taken, 1,328,000 tons of it were exported 
in 1956. 
Two Extremes; Profits and Poverty 
Twenty billion dollars worth of minerals, 
more or less from subequatorial Africa and 
additional massive quantities from other areas, 
and yet they say Africa is poor. If it is the 
mass of population, they refer to, they are 
certainly right. But why should the people be

poverty-stricken when the continent's sub-soil 
yields :such wealth? The answer is obvious: 
the mineral riches and the profits thereform are 
taken by non-Africans. 
It is a serious charge to make ? that the 
wealth of Africa is drained away, (writes Dr. 
Rita Hinden, a Fabian Socialist, in the Chal-
lenge of African Poverty). Minerals are one 
of Africa's precious assets, yet the mines are 
almost always operated by European capitalist 
companies, which pay dividends to their over-
seas Shareholders, heavy remuneration to their 
directions, as likely as not the lion's share of 
their taxes to the British Exchequer, royalties to 
venerable but functionless companies, and 
enormous wages to local European employees. 
What remains for the African workers and for 
the African exchequers are the crumbs from the 
rich man's table. 
And a Nigerian comments : ? The fabulous 
sums drawn- away from our mines alone, 
had they been at the disposal of a government 
oL-Nigerians, might- have, transformed the face 
of our couritry in a decade. We wOuld have 
had those things which we are now vainly 
seeking for: schools, factories and' hospitals ?. 
.14 
The' Flowing Treasure 
Oil is anothe'r attraction for money makers 
in Europe, England' and the United States. It 
is one of the big e&momic question Marks in 
Africa. The 'search for it-has been going on for 
Years. So 'far, Only Egypt has achieved a small 
regular production, yet enough to provide for 
more than two thirds of 'its consumption needs. 
Alderia and Ivlorocco have yielded only a little 
fraction of Egypt's output. Elsewhere there has 
been a good deal of exploration and drilling, 
but while occasional oil traces and strikes are 
reported here and there, no substantial. finds of 
the liquid gold have yet been disclosed. 
Yet with so little to show for their efforts, 
the oil companies continue their search and 
extend their concession holdings. 
? The great white hope of Algeria and 
Tunisia is oil ?, it was reported in 1953, when 
continued French political control of these 
territories was still: taken for granted, and, 
millions of dollars in direct and indirect 
American money and in French francs are being 
expended in a frantic search for it ?. The vast 
Sahara region, has become _ the new ? white 
hope ?-of France. Hence the major reason why 
it fights to hold Algeria.

President Nasser's thunder-clap proclam-
ation of July 26, 1956, cancelling the Suez 
Canal Company's concession and nationalizing 
the operation of that strategic waterway 
naturally cast a sudden, heavy cloud over the 
sundry oil concessions in Egypt and the sur-
rounding area. Naturally, the cloud became 
darker and heavier with the Anglo-French 
invasion of Egypt in November. Particularly 
bleak was the immediate outlook for Anglo-
Egyptian Oilfields,. the largest British com-
mercial interest remaining in Egypt with assets 
of $ 98 million including a refinery at Suez. 
Under Egyptian experts, the work is flourish-
ing. 
Awareness 
? Africans are not opposed to economic, 
industrial, commercial and political develop-
ment. On the contrary, this is welcomed. But 
they would rather forego all the benefits of 
these developments if they bring in their wake 
political and economic domination by out-
siders ?. 
Such was the view expressed by a deleg-
ation from Uganda which came to London 
in December, 1953. Economic expansion, the 
.16 
pointed out, had not brought peace or well-
being to Africans in South Africa, nor did 
imposition of Federation for the sake of the 
same objective promise anything good for 
Africans in Rhodesia and Nyasaland. There 
was concern, the delegation stated, lest with 
the economic schemes under way in Ugana ? 
the Kilemke mines and other projects ? 
Africans... will wake up one day to find that 
they are dominated by powerful factors over 
which they have no control. 
From various sections of the continent 
comes evidence of a wide spread bitterness, 
often erupting in action and not only words. 
Hungering for a new way of life, the African 
hears and sees economic expansion schemes 
talked about and developing all around him. 
His relationship to them is almost like that of 
a poor man looking through the window of a 
rich man's restaurant. Except that the African 
is not just an onlooker; he is compelled to give 
his labour for projects which he knows full well 
are aimed at the white man's benefit, not his, 
and point to the prolongation of the white man's 
domination, not to African freedom. Professor 
Harry R. Rudin of Yale University says, It 
is ominous that just when the West needs 
Africa most, Africans are demanding greater 
Freedom and better economic opportunities for

themselves >>. In this fundamental conflict of 
interests there is dynamite. 
,A prominent member of the Malan-
Strijclom regime in South Africa, Dr. T.E. 
Donges, Minister of Interior, in 1951 put it very 
concisely: ? Regarded from the point of view 
of Europe and America, answer is still the same 
7-- Africa must be kept within that orbit. 
fts raw niaterials are the complement of the 
highly-industrialized Europe and America ?. 
_ On one, occasion in 1951, Mr. Oliver 
Lyttelton '(now. Lord Chandos), criticising. the 
policy ? of , the Labour government, - said : 
? Britain is living on the dollar earnings of the 
colonies, who are prevented freely :converting 
their sterling into either goods or dollars, and 
must willy-nilly run up their balances ?. 
.3 
In view of the often-mentioned financial 
?Atelp ? given by Britain to hercolonies through 
the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund 
and- other govetnment agencies, it should be 
mentioned in passing-- that, according to the 
report of Eden's E_conotnic Secretary to the 
T,,gsuty. May 14, 1956), in the six years. 
k959755,, the colonies. added E 700 million in 
sterling balances to ?Britain's finances while 
18, 
- 17 
on rove 
Rel 
? 
London was providing -E 300 million in govern-
mend- grants and. loans to the colonies. One 
further footnote: the larger portion of such 
loans went to the white settler territories in 
East and Central Africa whereas by far the 
largest contribution of sterling balances came 
from the West ?African colonies, notably 
Nigeria and the, Gold Coast. 
The Congo's trade provides Belgipm with 
a surplus of many millions of dollars yearly. 
Coffee, Cocoa, sisal and other exports from 
Mozambique and Angola earn considerable 
sums for Portugal. 
The continuation of this arrangement 
whereby Europe is kept in spending money by 
control of the trade in Africa raw materials 
rests on two assumptions. First, it is assumed 
that Africa is and will remain a ? passive ? 
continent subject to European domination, or 
that even with the necessity of granting political 
concessions sooner or later in various areas, the 
economies of these ? liberated ? countries, 'as 
well as the rest of the continent, can be 
controlled as before by the metropolitan powers. 
Th&*second assumption is that the era of 
go-it-alone colonialism is ended ancrthat there

is now required an increasing amount of 
international collaboration for the control, 
planning, , investment in, , and marketing of 
Africa yaw material,production. 
? 
European Immigration Schemes 
One important point to Europe is to 
populate Eastern, Central and Southern 
Africa, where EurOpean settlers have already 
gone, With as many more as can be secured 
and as quickly as"possible, in order to fulfill the 
West's economic aims and ensure its continued 
hegemony in the continent. 
? A hundred thousand Belgian colonists 
before ten years or the Congo may well no 
longer be Belgian ?, said the Federation des As-
sociations de Colons du Congo in 1952, and 
others have set a target of 800,000 for the 
Congo's Belgian population in 50 years. ? We 
need -a hundred thousand more Portuguese in 
Angola within the next ten years. Then there 
will be no non sensical talk about African 
independence in this country ?, was what a 
civil servant in that colony said. 
? The-white settlers, whether technicians or 
-anything else, are not asked to conic help train 
20 
Africans to play their part in all phases of the 
expanding productive process. On the contrary, 
they are being brought in with the objectives of 
trying to keep the existing economic relations 
between white and black permantly frozen. 
Lord Malvern defined the pattern some 20 
years ago when, as, Prime Minister of South-
ern Rhodesia, he said, ? In the Europ6n areas 
the black man will be welcomed, when tempted 
by wages, he offers his services as a labourer; 
but it will be on the 'Understanding that he shall 
Merely asSist and not cOmPete,' Withr-the white 
Man ?. At present', since: If' happens that 
Africans are increasingly ? tempted ?)bY wagers 
to' keep from starving, one finds the same idea 
voiced ?n and 'again by the -Upholders of the 
rights of white rule. South Africa's Minister 
of Native Affairs, Dr. H.F. Verwoerd, for 
instance, states his 'opinion that ? Natives ?, on 
farms aie no more an integral part of the 
economy than the oxen, and that South Africa 
can function industrially without economic 
integration being necessary }.? ? 
? In Kenya, Mr. E.A: Vasey, Minister of 
Finance and Development, explains, ? Our 
economic structure developeddn three horizont-
al' layers.: with the 'African providing the

work and that of. the White artiSa-n" is often very 
finely, drawn. _The, managirig director of

_ -? 
Can anybody call this a human act? 
= The -African has,., a brain and physical 
stiength -that entitle him to the same human 
rights as an. white pan. The following is a 
te'stimony of some Rhodesian employees who 
22 
have had the seise and decency to allow 
Africans to break through the racial barrier in 
industry. ?.Our African crane drivers are as 
good as any European crane driver. Africans 
learn shoe machine work very quickly ? some-
times more quickly, and better, than Europeans. 
All our employees start by knowing nothing. 
Some, after 3 months, can operate turret 
lathes costing E 5,000. The individual product-
ivity of the African is equal to that of 
the European at all levels of jig operation ?. 
Obviously, it is not that the African can't 
do the job, and as well as the European, if given 
a chance; they just don't want him to except, 
sometimes, at a lower wage. 
This question of segregation will remain 
unsolved so long as a white settler is made to 
believe that his superior status in life, as measur-
ed not only against the African's status but 
against his own former less prosperous con-
dition back home, can be won and maintained 
only by supporting and preserving the status 
quo of white domination. 
Another report concerning the same 
question was written by Professor Rayford W.

Logan of Howard University. It is about 
French settlers in West Africa, particularly in 
the Ivory Coast. The report says, ? Almost 
every plane and boat brings ? petits francais ? 
who compete' with Africans for jobs. Some 
Africans received 6,000 West African francs, 
a month for 'doing' the same work for which 
Frenchmen received about four times as much. 
Sometime S Africans were discharged - after 
training Frenchmen for a job.

, .The New York Times (April 7, 1952) 
reported how ? several thousand non-whites 
marched in Fordsburg Freedom Square 
(Johannesburg). The defiance volunteers were 
carefully selected ,and instructed. They went 
forth , in groups to enter the ? Reserved for 
Whites,? sections of post offices, railway 
stations, and other public places. And when 
arrested, they went to jail without protest. In

importance in the success of the campaign. It 
is true that the campaign failed of its objective 
of winning equality and justice but it succeeded 
in cementing unity of action toward democrakic 
goals embracing all national and racial sections 
of the population. 
The Defiance Movement spread over into 
Northern Rhodesia. In 1953, The African 
Congress of that country began a Challenge 
the Colour Bar campaign in the main towns. 
As crowds of Africans watched, ? defiers ? 
entered post offices, shops, cafes, and public 
places reserved to whites. In succeeding years, 
butcher shops and other stores were taught the 
necessity of serving Africans over the counter 
side by side with whites instead of on the out-
side through special hatches as had been done 
before. 
The one weapon that won the battle for 
the defiers was ? the boycotting >> of those 
stores and shops. The whites could hardly 
believe that Africans were capable of such 
planning, organization and discipline.

The Education Problem , 
Once, about four years ago, when Lord 
Malvern was Governor of Southern Rhodesia, 
acknowledged that ? one criticism against 
? colonialism ? which had substance, was that 
raw materials had been taken away for the 
industries of distant countries at a price which 
did not leave enough in the country of origin 
for the provision of adequate health, education 
and other social services ?. He immediately 
added that this was now being changed with 
the development of secondary industries in the 
country. But a year and a half later, we find 
him saying, ? It is the abject poverty of the mas-
ses which is the cause of the trouble. We 
have not the money to educate them. Later, in 
1956, after all the appropriations for the Kariba 
dam, railroad expansian and other capital 
works, Mr. R.S. Garfield Todd, Southern 
Rhodesia's Prime Minister, spoke of the 
inability of the Government to raise the funds 
reasonably required to develop... the African 
population. 
Why couldn't they raise the funds required 
for education matters, etc. ? The Rhodesians are 
not to be classed among the poorer countries 
of Africa. The real reason is that the African 
26 
is cheated. He is cheated first by the copper 
companies and other employees who would 
rather pay extra taxes on their profits to the 
government than give their African workers 
more money. He is cheated albo by a govern-
ment which spends its revenues to provide 
facilities for the further expansion of the copper 
and other business interests, and to promote 
the size and welfare of the white population. 
The State of African education in 
Rhodesia is typical of that in all settler-ruled 
territories, though perhaps a little better than in 
some. 
A Belgian commission which surveyed the 
Congo's schools not very long ago, reported 
how African children, supposed to be getting 
some primary education, were found to be 
spending then: time attending to the coffee, 
peanuts and other crops grown for the market. 
On Kenya's European farms in 1954, there 
were officially reported to be 39,784 children 
employed, most of them on monthly contracts 
and the rest as day labourers, resident labour-
ers, or domestics. A Rhodesian newspaper 
reports ? Many industrial and commercial 
firms make use of child labour in and around

Salisbury. The age of the children in some 
case is about six to seven years... Many of 
them look miserable and show of malnutrition. 
Nearly all these children are illiterate and have 
never seen the door of a school ?. 
What future is awaiting those children 
when they grow up? 
The Road to Freedom 
. Prime Minister Nkrumah was asked in an 
Edward R. Murrow television interview in 
April, 1956, what he thought was Africa's most 
urgent need today. His answer was, ?...I think 
the first essential thing is political emancipation, 
because once they are politically emancipated, 
they are in the position to develop their own 
-country in a way in which they think fit ?. 
What the Africans demand, can be put in 
four words: ? Africa for the Africans I% 
Africans will not be held down by force 
any longer. What could be a stronger proof 
than the protests in West Africa over the 
-cending of 30,000 Senegalese to help the French 
? 
fight Algerians? Some of the Senegalese sur-
rendered and changed into uniforms of the 
North African Army of Liberation, which in 
turn pledged solidarity with all Africans in their 
struggle for independence. 
The people of Africa have their future to 
build. The Cold War measuring-rod of United 
States objectives in that continent is out-dating 
and self-defeating. If losing Africa means its 
ceasing to be the special preserve of Western 
interests, then it is as certainly lost as Asia. The 
leaders of the W?est, let us hope, will face up to 
the necessity of getting along by means other 
than on the backs of the Africans.

policy is not the outcome of sympathy with the Soviet 
Union alone, but of considerations of higher self-interest : the 
desire to spare the world the horrors of nuclear destruction ; 
to build up their national economies ; and to raise their 
standards of living in peace, far from the constant threat of 
nuclear and thermo-nuclear gfall-outi. 
' ? Neutralism here, of course is far removed from the neutra-
lism embraced by Switzerland over the last few thcades. This 
Swiss-type neutrality -could only be adopted during the past eras 
of-conventional warfare, when it was possible for civilian poptt-
lation to enjoy a large degree of protection from armies fight-
ing it Out in' the field. Nowadays, the outlook is radically dif-
ferent : it -has been- estimated by American strategists, for 
instance, that a thermonuclear attack launched against the 
Soviet Union would wipe out three million persons in Western 
Europe, 'thousands, of miles away from the actual targets of 
attack. This estimate does not even take into consideration the 
nlions ..of casualties, that would be suffered in a Russian re-
prisal attack_on Ame,rican,bases in Western Europe and Africa 
Again, the natunal governments in Africa and Asia read-
ily appreciate that neutralism. in this sense is only a negative 
attitude in world affairs. This stand may at one time have 
been defensible, but in the present day it is as if to hide one's 
head in the sand. For these nationalist countries in Africa 
and Asia know full well that the main struggle going on today 
is. between the solonialist countries, and those countries striving 
to achieve independence or to protect their newly-won liberty. 
They know that not only in theory, but in actual every-day 
practise ; because their leaders, men like Nasser, Nehru, and 
Sukarno, have lived its reality with the people. There is, then. 
no neutralism in the fight against imperialism, for the Africans 
cannot maintain a neutralist attitude towards French colonialist 
massacres in Algeria ; neither can the Arabs remain neutralist 
to British imperialism in Kenya ; nor can the Afro-Asians feel 
neutralist about American-Dutch co!onialism in Indonesia. For 
colonialism is like a disease, which if not totally stamped out, 
is bound to break out again in the same or another part of 
the body politic. Neutralism in this case can only amount to 
an acceptance of imperialism, instead of its refutation ; it can 
Only mean the protection of colonialism, instead of exposing 
it and mobilising world opinion against it. 
Hence we hafie the word epositive, added. It is a meaning 
that rejects negativism, yet at the same time it does not commit 
the struggling Afro-Asian countries to any policy but that 
dictated by their own naional self-interest, in the international 
sphere and at home. 
. If we want to define more closely the basic essentials of 
positive neutralism, they may be summed up as follows : 
FIRST : positive neutralism in the first instance means the full 
protection of niticinal independence :against the aggres-
sions of imperialism ; while we now find' 'thatinter-
national circumstances permit of that at isreient. That

mean i an' active strUggle againft iniperialism wherever 
it may' be, the liberation of the national economy 
from foreign influence, and the rejection of alien 
pacts and alliances 'focussing 'local and world atte'n-
don on imperialism and its evils, and the support of 
national movements in those countries seeking inde-
pendence,- or whose national independence is threa-
tened. . . 
- 
SECOND and this is the logical development of the first 
point, and that is that imperialism continues to 
wage battle against the national movements as a 
,whige! using 'the most violent means. The positive. 
neutralist nations. .must, in order to face this 
_ . _ 
onslaUght, seek their natural allies, the more to he. 
able to' 'resist external imperialist egression, and 
internal plotting ; 'as. well as resistance to economic 
areii order to consolidate the -13a.s' is -of inde-

It may be superfluous to add that without the Afro-Asian 
solidarity there can be no positive neutralism. For without a 
forceful and active nationalist policy positive-neutralism cannot 
survive ; and without solidarity there can be no real basis for 
common nationalist policy. It is no accident that this policy 
has led to the conference of Afro-Asian governments at 
Bandung, and the wider Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference in 
Cairo.
