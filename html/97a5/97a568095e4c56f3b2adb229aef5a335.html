 February 3, 1966       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 For Bombing Resumption the Need Was
 Obvious
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. RICHARD FULTON
 OF TENNESSEE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr.                   FULTON of  Tennessee.  Mr.
 Speaker,  the recent               resumption   of
 bombing of North Vietnamese person-
 nel  and              installations came  after              a
 concerted effort over many weeks by
 President Johnson to seek a means
 whereby   this tragic              conflict  could
 be removed from the fields of battle
 and be pursued at the conference table in
 the hopes of a peaceful settlement.
 It was with great regret that President
 Johnson ordered the resumption of the
 bombings.  Nonetheless the decision was
 his to make and it was made, doubtlessly
 with reluctance and heavy heart.
 Mr. Speaker, the President's decision
 has drawn significant approval.  Among
 those who have joined in approval is the
 Nashville Banner.  The views of this
 paper were published in an editorial
 dated February 1, 1966, and entitled
 "Right, Mr. President: For Bombing Re-
 sumption, the Need Was Obvious."
 I would like to insert this editorial in
 the RECORD and commend it to the at-
 tention of my colleagues.
 RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT-FOR BOMBING RESUMP-
 TION, THE NEED WAS OBVIOUS
 It was not an impromptu decision, con-
 trived in the dark and spurred by impulse,
 that sent U.S. bombers back into action over
 North Vietnam yesterday-ending in its 38th
 day the bombing suspension that began on
 Christmas eve.  It was a military necessity;
 the logical and only effective answer to that
 enemy's contemptuous disregard of America's
 sustained effort for peaceful settlement at
 a conference table.
 President Johnson spelled it out clearly
 in his calm mesage of formal announcement
 and reasoned explanation.  He assuredly has
 the majority of America with him in that
 decision; for to the bulk of this constituency
 it was-and is-obvious that the avenue to
 peace does not lie in the direction of over-
 tures to Hanoi.  These have failed; construed
 by that enemy as a sign of weakness and in-
 decision.
 It now is clear that the Vietcong wants
 no peace, save on its own terms, amounting
 to total conquest.  That would be U.S. sur-
 render-a repudiation of its commitments,
 and the turning over, ultimately, of all Asia
 to Communist aggression.
 There was no timidity and indecision in
 the President's statement.  He laid it on the
 line, exercising again a prerogative given in
 the  congressional  resolution  of  August
 1964-and with the action recommended by
 competent advisers including, notably, the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 With that decision there can be no quarrel
 on the part of any security-minded Ameri-
 can, sensitive to the facts in the case as
 restated.  One paragraph stands out by way
 of solemn warning:
 "If continued immunity is given to all
 that supports North Vietnam aggression, the
 cost in lives-Vietnamese lives and Ameri-
 can lives and allied lives-will be greatly
 increased."
 That has been true throughout the one-
 sided 37-day cease-fire; it would be equally
 true of any settlement that installed a Viet-
 cong Government over that land, to break
 out afresh across Asia when it had consol-
 idated its strength with that of its Com-
 munist partners to push for wider conquest.
 The Banner opposed that U.S. commitment
 from the outsets-objecting to an adventure
 obviously not thought through at the time.
 But once involved in it, and engaged in the
 war that followed, this newspaper has em-
 phasized that we must win it.  Nothing less
 than victory will justify the, sacrifice that
 already has been made.
 President Johnson was not repudiating the
 concept of honorable peace-arrived at by
 any avenue of reason.  He went to great
 length to assure  contemporary powers  of
 America's willingness to present the Viet-
 namese issue to world judgment.  He author-
 ized Ambassador Arthur Goldberg to submit
 it to a review by the U.N. Security Council.
 He gave respectful acknowledgment to Pope
 Paul's urgent suggestion for arbitration by
 neutral powers.  As reiterated in the course
 of his text, top U.S. diplomats have made the
 rounds of the world in these Christmas and
 post-Christmas weeks, expressing America's
 willingness to negotiate.
 America wants an honorable peace, with
 guarantees of freedom as the only objective
 that can make it that. That is the U.S. pur-
 pose; it wants not a square inch of real es-
 tate, or captive status for any people on
 earth.
 The whole world knows that, and charges
 to the contrary are infamous.
 The United States suspended those bomb-
 ings in the hope that-sparing North Viet-
 nam the punishment that was occurring-
 the enemy would come to the conference
 table.  The hope was in vain.
 That is why the bombings have resumed-
 a foretaste of the power this Nation has to
 crush that enemy on whom peace overtures
 have been wasted.
 The President has made his decision, and
 it was the right one.  He presented the case
 with courage and candor; with due respect
 for the opinions of mankind, but with a pri-
 mary concern where it belongs, on the in-
 terest of the United States.  With any failure
 to meet this challenge, that very default
 would compound the ultimate sacrifice.
 America has the resources to  win  this
 war, and must use them to that end.
 It is a time-honored maxim, now under-
 stood surely by thinking men everywhere,
 that once you are engaged in war there is no
 substitute for victory.

 Army Doctors in Hawaii Make Notable
 Advance in Malaria Fight
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker there
 are few news stories that can sur-
 pass the excitement evoked by reading
 an article on a breakthrough in the
 treatment of a disease.  Such a break-
 through was reported in the treatment
 of the dreaded malaria on Tuesday, Jan-
 uary 18, 1966.  The news is especially
 timely since an estimated 1 out of
 3 GI's in Vietnam has been contract-
 ing this dreaded disease.  There is no
 question about the morale boosting effect
 the news of this breakthrough has had
 on our troops in Vietnam.
 The heroes who discovered the com-
 bination of, drugs that could break the
 relapse cycle of the recurring type of
 malaria are Col. Frank L. Miller and
 Col. James A. OrbIson, medical officers
 who are assigned to U.S. Army, Tripler
 General Hospital in Hawaii. They have
 by their tireless efforts to discover this
 "wonder mix," proven again that the
 war can be fought just as heroically in
 the laboratories on the homefront as in
 the swamps of Vietnam.
 I ,commend to the readers of the CON-
 GRESSIONAL RECORD the article written by
 Lyle Nelson on the breakthrough in the
 treatment of malaria which appeared In
 the Thursday, January 20, 1966, issue of
 .the Honolulu Star-Bulletin:
 TWO AT TRIPLER HAILED FOR BREAKTHROUGH
 IN MALARIA FIGHT
 (By Lyle Nelson)
 Back in the days of World War II, GI's
 took so many atabrin pills to avoid malaria
 they turned yellow.
 And if they threw the pills away they often
 came down with malaria, which causes chills,
 a fever, a headache, and a rotten feeling in
 general.
 Then came the Vietnam war and a tougher
 strain of malaria popped up.  It resisted the
 medicine that seemed to work at Guadal-
 canal and other tropical battlegrounds.
 Now this type of malaria appears to be
 licked, thanks to the men at Tripler Hospital.
 Finding a cure for anything in the field
 of medicine is part luck and part attention.
 to the smallest detail in analyzing research
 and laboratory data.
 CREDIT TWO COLONELS
 Special credit at Tripler for finding a possi-
 ble way to solve the malaria problem in Viet-
 nam goes to Col. Frank L. Miller, chief of
 pulmonary and infectious diseases, and the
 man he works for and with, Col. James A.
 Orbison, chief of the department of medi-
 cine at Tripler.
 Malaria has become a big problem in Viet-
 nam.  In some areas 1 out of 3 GI's got the
 bug.
 Tripler took in 285 victims last year.
 Miller started watching how often they
 suffered relapses and what drugs or combi-
 nation of drugs they were taking, in Viet-
 nam and after they arrived at Tripler.
 He discovered that malaria attacks reoc-
 curred among men who had taken different
 combinations of drugs with one exception.
 WONDER  MIX
 The wonder mix appeared to be pyrimetha-
 mine (a sulfone) and quinine.
 Miller and Orbison found they could break
 this relapse cycle with this combination.
 Hints of this finding came from similar
 malaria research being conducted among
 volunteer  prisoners  at  the  Illinois  State
 Prison in Joliet.
 The word on pyrimethamine and quinine
 is now being passed along to hospitals be-
 tween Washington and Saigon.
 Army officials in the Pentagon discussed
 the breakthrough Tuesday.
 Miller and Orbison will discuss the mat-
 ter before Honolulu's civilian doctors at the
 regular meeting of the American College of
 Physicians at the Mabel L. Smyth Auditorium
 February 23.
 THE CAUSE
 Malaria is caused by a parasite which works
 its way into the red blood cells after a victim
 is bitten by a mosquito bearing the disease.
 Victims are treated in two ways.
 First, doctors administer drugs that will
 help prevent malaria "bugs" from growing
 and developing.
 In cases, like those at Tripler, where it is
 too late to do this, they try to break the
 relapse cycle.
 It is in this cycle, between the active and
 dormant stages, that they achieved what
 appears to be a cure.
 Not only will the finding be good news for
 servicemen  in tropical areas  but for dis-
 charged Vietnam veterans who are having
 relapses of malaria.
 One such case in Colorado recently proved
 fatal.  He apparently was no longer taking
 pills.
 It's almost a case of better yellow than
 dead.
 Challenge to the U.N.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROMAN C. PUCINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, January 12, 1966
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 Chicago Sun Times carried an excellent
 editorial in its February 2 edition deal-
 ing with our efforts to bring the whole
 Vietnam issue before the United Nations.
 I fully agree with the Sun Times edi-
 torial that the United States has handed.
 the United Nations a problem that will
 be harder to solve than any that body
 has undertaken in the past. But I also
 agree that if the U.N. can indeed resolve
 the Vietnam conflict, it will attain a new
 scope of respect and dignity not only
 in the United States but throughout the
 entire world.
 Mr. Speaker, the Sun Times editorial
 follows:
 CHALLENGE TO THE U.N.
 The U.S. resolution to the U.N. Security
 Council on Vietnam was brief and to the
 point.  It recommended that "appropriate
 interested governments" arrange a confer-
 ence "looking toward the application of the
 Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 and the
 establishment of a durable peace in south-
 east Asia."  The first order of business of
 the conference would be to arrange an end
 to the fighting in Vietnam.
 If the Security Council does take on the
 task its members will undoubtedly discover-
 and hopefully appreciate-some of the dif-
 A527
 ficulties the United States has struggled with
 In its efforts to stop Communist aggression
 in southeast Asia.
 It is doubtful that the U.N. Security Coun-
 cil can come to any solution of the Vietnam
 conflict  without  consultation  with  either
 Red China or North Vietnam or both.       The
 wording of the U.S. resolution is such that
 room has been left for the Security Council
 to invite these nations to the conference.
 Whether they would accept such an invita-
 tion is another matter.  Hanoi has refused,
 in the past, to accept a similar invitation
 made by the U.N. on the grounds that it
 did not recognize that international body.
 The United States has handed the U.N.
 a problem that will be harder to solve than
 any that body has undertaken in the past.
 If the U.N. does make the effort to solve the
 crisis in Vietnam and it is rebuffed by the
 aggressor nations it then faces an even
 greater problem-a direct and open challenge
 to every member U.N. nation of the right of
 the nations of the world to live in peace.
 Drummond Defends U.S. Deci-
 sion on Bombing
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. ED EDMONDSON
 OF OKLAHOMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, January 13, 1966
 Mr.  EDMONDSON. Mr.  Speaker,
 there are conclusive reasons why the
 bombing pause in North Vietnam could
 not be continued indefinitely without
 some constructive response from Hanoi.
 In pinpointing these reasons, no one,
 It seems to me, has done a better job
 than Columnist Roscoe Drummond.
 In a February 2 column in the Wash-
 ington Post, entitled "The Lull Ends-
 The United States Shows Its Mettle," Mr.
 Drummond stated that the decision will
 effectively unify the country behind the
 President.  "It was a painful decision,"
 he wrote.   One reason for its necessity,
 he said, was the fact that "Ho Chi Minh
 confirmed publicly that he would not ne-
 gotiate until after unconditional sur-
 render by South Vietnam and removal
 of all U.S. forces."
 A second reason, he said, was because
 "North Vietnam used the bombing pause
 of 37 days to increase the flow of North
 Vietnamese troops across the border"
 into South Vietnam.  "Obviously," Mr.
 Drummond adds, "the diplomatic rea-
 sons for continuing the pause were ex-
 hausted."
 While believing that to resume the
 bombing was not a "welcome or agree-
 able choice," he stated that the alter-
 native "of yielding South Vietnam and
 southeast Asia to the aggressor-would
 be far worse for the United States and
 the whole free world."
 The column Is one which many of my
 colleagues will want to ponder and I in-
 clude it in the Appendix of the RECORD:
 THE LULL ENDS-THE UNITED STATES SHOWS
 ITS METTLE

 It will mean that the United States will in-
 crease its military actions at every level in
 order to remove Hanoi's belief it can win
 because we will become hopelessly divided,
 grow weary, and don't really mean to stick
 it out.
 It will leave open the door to peace talks
 anytime Hanoi so chooses-as the action in
 taking the issue to the U.N. Security Council
 allows.
 There  are  conclusive  reasons why  the
 bombing pause could not be continued in-
 definitely  without                           some  constructive re-
 sponse from Hanoi.                         The decision was never
 in doubt. It was a painful decision but not
 a. difficult one because it rested on two facts:
 The fact  that Ho  Chi  Minh   confirmed
 publicly that he would not negotiate until
 after unconditional surrender by South Viet-
 nam and removal of all U.S. forces.
 The fact that North Vietnam used the
 bombing pause of 37 days to increase the
 flow of North Vietnamese troops across the
 border and to increase the level of Vietcong
 attacks and terror in South Vietnam to a
 point greater in number than ever.
 Obviously, the diplomatic reasons for con-
 tinuing the pause were exhausted.
 'T'here wil- of course be some dissident and.
 fear-laden voices in Congress.  A democracy
 is never unanimous.  Only 3 months before
 Pearl Harbor, Congress came within one vote
 of killing the draft. But now the leading
 advocates of continuing the bombing pause---

 their support of the President.
 And how  will the American  people re-
 spond?  Here, too, there will be honest dif-
 Ierences which the Communists see, not as a
 source of a democracy's strength, but as it
 weakness on which they continue to count.
 But just before the President announced his
 decision, Louis Harris sampled public opin-
 ion and found that if Hanoi refused to talk
 peace, the American people would support
 the resumption of bombing by more than
 2 to 1.  His survey showed that 60 percent of
 the country would back a U.S. force of 500.-

 Birmingham Area Chamber of Commerce
 Protests Attorney General's Decision
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JOHN BUCHANAN
 Your decision  as to Federal examiners
 must, therefore, have been based upon a find-
 ing that the appointment of examiners was
 otherwise necessary to enforce the guarantees
 of the 15th amendment.  In making that
 finding, the act required that you consider
 what bona fide efforts were being made in
 the Birmingham area to comply with the
 15th amendment.  There can be no doubt
 that such bona fide efforts have been made.
 The Jefferson County Board of Registrars
 has, since' January 1 of this year, more than
 tripled the number of registration clerks, in-
 cluding the addition of Negro clerks.  They
 have extended their registration days from
 3 days per week to 5 days per week, one of
 which is all day Saturday.  The capacity of
 the facilities of the board of registrars to
 register voters has been far greater than re-
 quired by the number of applicants for reg-
 istration.  Even on the Saturday preceding
 your action, applicants for registration were
 fewer than could have been registered by
 the board. Those truly desirous of register-
 ing have had ample opportunity to do so.
 We cannot escape the conclusion that the
 only basis for appointment of Federal exam-
 iners was to make registration more conven-
 ient.   Considering  the  gravity of sending
 Federal examiners to take over a function of
 P. State, a function which is guaranteed to
 that State by the Constitution of the United
 States; considering that this action, in addi-
 tion to affecting the integrity of constitu-
 tional government with all the harmful con-
 sequences inherent in such an action, was
 an encouragement of demonstrations such
 as those which preceded your action, demon-
 strations which invloved so many unlawful
 acts that injunctions against them have been
 issued by the Federal court of this district,
 the mere  increase  in the  convenience of
 voter registration is,  in our judgment,  a
 basis so inadequate for your action as to
 justify our protest and to require your re-
 consideration.
 Sincerely,
 WALTER BOULDIN,
 President.

 Mr. BUCHANAN.  Mr. Speaker, on

 in registering and voting.

 And the VISTA program (Volunteers in

 these things, plus clothes, recreation, books,

 figures you will have to admit the Govern-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROMAN C. PUCINSKI
 05' ILLINOIS
 iN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday. January 12, 1966
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, tele-
 vision station WBBM-TV in Chicago car-
 ried an extremely interesting editorial on
 January 26 which I would like to call to
 the attention of my colleagues, partic-
 ularly since proposals for establishment
 of an ombudsman have been suggested
 to the Congress.
 I thoroughly agree with the editorial
 that any citizen who needs assistance to-
 day can get such assistance either from
 his Congressman or other representa-
 tives to various levels of government in
 the community.
 Mr. Carter Davidson, editorial director
 of WBBM-TV, has performed a signifi-
 cant public service and effectively shot
 down trial balloons recently launched
 around here for creation of an ombuds-
 man position.
 The editorial follows:
 WHO NLHDS AN OMDUDSMAN?
 If we are net careful, we are going to get
 a  new word in the language-and a new
 [ace on the public payrolls.  The word is
 "ombudsman."  It comes from Sweden, and
 it means, literally, representative of the peo-
 ple.               As it works in practice, the ombudsman
 ;peaks up for ordinary citizens like us, who
 get caught up in the tangles of governmental
 redtape.
 You,  yourself,  may have had  some  ex-
 perience in the frustration of trying to get
 something done, or a complaint heard, by
 ;ome office of government.  Chances are you
 ended up mumbling to yourself about "what
 chance does a little guy have trying to fight
 city hall?" In theory, an ombudsman, es-
 pecially elected for the job, would fight your
 light  for  you.   And,  In theory,  it  is  a
 good idea.  So good, in :fact, that there have
 been proposals for establishing the position
 of ombudsman here in :Illinois.
 A bill to create such a post was introduced
 in. the last session of the State legislature but
 got lost in the shuffle.  The same was true
 in California, where we are told the ombuds-
 man bill came close to passage.  Now there
 is agitation in New York State to establish
 nn ombudsman there.
 We can be fairly sure the effort will be re-
 newed in Illinois next year when the gen-
 eral assembly meets again.  We do not need
 an ombudsman in Illinois, or in the city of
 Chicago.  We already have several.  All you
 have to do is use them.  You have two U.S.
 senators, your Representative in Congress,
 an alderman in city hall and a whole galaxy
 of State representatives and senators.  They
 occupy the offices they hold because they
 promised you, at election time, they would
 represent your interests.
 Write to them, or call them on the tele-
 phone.  They  are  your  ombudsman,                          your
 representatives.  At least that's what they
 get paid for being, and the better ones earn
 their pay.
 In our view, we don't need to hire a n om-
 budsman to get us out of any tangles of
 governmental redtape.  We need to use the
 representatives we already have.  That's why
 we have them.
 American Revolution Bicentennial
 Commission
 SPEECH
 HON. CHARLES McC. MATHIAS, JR.
 OF MARYLAND
 IN'I'HE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 1, 1966
 Mr. MATHIAS.          Mr. Speaker, a few
 short years from now, between 1973 and
 1983,  we will be celebrating the 200th
 anniversary of the American Revolution,
 and the bicentennial of our national
 commitment to the principles of liberty
 and equality set forth in the Declaration
 of Independence.
 There is no question that this bicen-
 tennial will be marked across the land
 by countless local, State, National and
 international    activities,    stretching
 through a full decade, under the auspices
 of     innumerable    public   auth )rities,
 learned societies, and historical, civic,
 patriotic, philanthropic, and profession-
 al organizations and groups.
 There is no question that we will en-
 Joy a great range of conferences and
 convocations, scholarship and analysis,
 and pomp and pageantry.
 There is no question that this bicen-
 tcnniai will be the greatest celebration
 in the history of our Republic-but there
 is no assurance that it will be as great,
 as thoughtful, and as mature as the oc-
 casion requires.  I personally believe that
 it is the ideals rather than the relics of
 the Revolution that we should emphasize.
 Given the magnitude of the bicenten-
 nial, and the wealth of talents and re-
 sources involved, careful planning and
 comprehensive coordination are both dif-
 ficult and essential. In my judgment, the
 job can only be done by a blue-ribbon
 national commission. with ample time
 and authority, and with the confidence
 and cooperation of the many groups and
 agencies involved.
 Last week the gentleman from Massa-
 chusetts [Mr. MORSE] and I introduced
 identical bills, H.R. 12252 and H.R. 12260,
 to establish an American Revolution Bi-
 centennial Commission as the best agency
 for this tremendous task.
 The Commission we propose would
 have 31 members, including the Presi-
 dent, Vice President, and Speaker of the
 House; 4 Senators and 4 Representa-
 tives; the Secretary of State, the Secre-
 tary of the Interior, the Librarian of
 Congress, the Secretary of the Smith-
 sonian Institution, and the Chairman of
 the Federal Council on the Arts and
 Humanities; and 15 members from pri-
 vate life, appointed by the President.
 The President, Vice President, Speaker
 of the House, and the five executive-
 branch officials designated would be ex-
 officio members of the Commission.
 Because the full dimensions of the bi-
 centennial cannot be determined at once,
 the Commission would devote its first 2
 years to comprehensive planning.  Dur-
 ing the first year of its existence, the
 Commission is directed to convene a na-?
 tional assembly of representatives from
 the Federal Government, the States, and
 all interested groups.  This assembly
 would discuss possible bicentennial ac-
 tivities and make recommendations to
 the Commission.
 Based on the assembly's conclusions
 and its own preliminary work, the Com-
 mission would submit a full report to
 Congress within the first 2 years of its
 existence. As described in our bills, this
 report would include discussion of a great
 range of possible activities; recommen-
 dations for the allocation of financial
 and administrative responsibility among-
 various public and private authorities
 and groups; and such legislative enact-
 ments and administrative actions as the
 Commission considers necessary.
 In fulfilling its broad responsibility to
 plan, encourage, coordinate, and conduct
 bicentennial activities, the Commission
 would be authorized to consult, cooperate
 with, and seek advice and assistance from
 all appropriate Federal departments and
 agencies, State and local public bodies,
 learned societies, and historical, patriotic,
 philanthropic, civic, professional, and re-
 lated   organizations.  Conversely,   all
 Federal departments and agencies are
 authorized and requested to cooperate
 fully with the Commission, with more
 specific directives being given to the Sec-
 retary of the Interior, the Chairman of
 the Federal Council on the Arts and
 Humanities, and the Librarian of Con-
 gress, the Secretary of the Smithsonian
 Institution, and the Archivist of the
 United States to develop appropriate ac-
 tivities and projects in their respective
 fields.
 Mr. Speaker, I would emphasize that
 the American Revolution Bicentennial
 Commission is not designed nor intended
 to preempt the field and preclude, or even
 monitor, local and private efforts.  Its
 goal is just the opposite: To encourage
 all interested. groups, to offer informa-
 tion, to help provide advice and techni-
 cal assistance, and to orchestrate a vast
 collection of activities and projects into
 a bicentennial of unprecedented scope,
 depth, and quality.
 Toward this goal, the planning proce-
 dures established under this bill are es-
 pecially important, for all posibilities
 must be surveyed and studied before
 final recommendations are made and
 final arrangements begun.  The cont:l-
 nuity of leadership provided by this Com-
 mission will be vital, too, for without
 it, the most careful planning could be
 for naught.
 In developing this legislation, the gen-
 tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Monsl:i
 and I have consulted with many inter-
 ested individuals, and have studied the
 experience of previous commemorative
 commissions, particularly the Civil War
 Centennial Commission.  In the weeks
 ahead, we will be seeking the advice and
 counsel of many groups and individuals
 throughout the Nation.  We hope to ob-
 tain the interest and support of many of
 our colleagues in the House, so that an
 early hearing on this bill can be obtained.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. JOHN A. RACE
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. RACE. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed
 gratifying to see the wide support the
 President has received for his decision to
 resume air strikes in North Vietnam. It
 seems to me that of these, none is more
 important than the forthright, strong
 statement by President Eisenhower.
 The former World War II supreme
 commander  believes  that  President
 Johnson acted in the only way possible.
 His support of renewed air action over
 North Vietnam is without reservation.
 General Eisenhower's outspoken en-
 dorsement of the President's decision to
 resume bombing in the north after the
 37-day pause is both "timely and wel-
 come," the Washington Star commented
 in a February 2 editorial entitled "Ike
 and Vietnam."
 The Star reiterated General Eisen-
 hower believes that President Johnson
 "unquestionably has made the correct
 decision in ordering resumption of the
 bombing."
 General Eisenhower has made it clear
 that if we fail in Vietnam we would have
 to face the aggressors on other battle-
 fields in southeast Asia. And he added:
 I'm for winning the battle here (in Viet-
 nam)                and not in some more remote place
 not of our own choosing.
 The words of this beloved former
 President and wise commander will be
 heard-and listened to.  We are indeed
 fortunate to have his advice and the
 President to have his support. Because
 my colleagues may want to peruse the
 editorial to which I have referred, I
 hereby submit it for publication in the
 RECORD.
 IKE AND VIETNAM
 It is no secret that General Eisenhower in
 the main has approved and supported the
 policies which the Johnson administration
 has been following in Vietnam.
 Nevertheless, his outspoken endorsement
 of the President's decision to resume bomb-
 ing in the north after the 37-day pause is
 both timely and welcome.  It is timely be-
 cause the President, during the. past' few
 days, has been under heavy attack in the
 Senate, primarily from a minority group of
 liberal  Democratic Senators.   Despite  the
 fact that they are in the minority, however,
 the continuing criticism in the Senate is
 bound to contribute to confusion in the
 country and in some degree to shake public
 confidence in the soundness of Mr. Johnson's
 decision.
 So the vigorous statement from the form-
 er President,  in whose  administration  we
 first began giving aid to Saigon, is welcome.
 His two overwhelming Presidential victories
 testify to the size of his following in the
 United States.  And most of the American
 people, we believe, will prefer his judgment
 to that of the Morses, the Fulbrights, and
 the Gavins.
 in an interview with the New York Times,
 Mr. Eisenhower said the President "unques-
 tionably has made the correct decision in or-
 dering resumption of the bombing.  An in-
 definite pause, he added, would only give
 "sanctuary to those responsible for sending
 guerrilla forces and supplies into South Viet-
 nam" in the effort to impose their will on
 the Government and people of that country."
 Mr. Eisenhower has no sympathy at all
 with the comments from Senators to the ef-
 fect that we are escalating the war while
 "playing at brinkmanship with a nuclear
 world war III."   He  also rejects  General
 Gavin's suggestion that we should lodge our
 forces in coastal enclaves while   pursuing
 peace efforts. What, he asked, would the
 Vietcong be doing throughout the rest of
 South Vietnam while U.S. forces sat securely
 in their enclaves?
 If we fail in Vietnam, he continued, we
 would have to face the aggressors on other
 battlefields  in  southeast  Asia.   And  the
 World War II Supreme Commander conclud-
 ed with this: "I'm for winning the battle
 here (in Vietnam) and not in some more
 remote place not of our own choosing."
 A  beleagured  and           harrassed President
 needs  the  support  of      all  Americans, es-
 pecially those in a position to know what
 they are talking about.  For this reason if
 for no other we are glad that General Eisen-
 hower has seen fit to speak out forthrightly
 at this critical time.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker, one
 of the more charming advantages of our
 democratic form of government is the
 prominent role that is given to the First
 Lady. Because we in America have been
 blessed with a succession of outstanding
 First Ladies and because we are cogni-
 zant of the influence that a First Lady
 can exert in a country, we look with great
 respect and expectation to the new First
 Lady of the Philippines-Mrs. Ferdinand
 Marcos.           -
 Mrs. Marcos recently demonstrated a
 keen awareness of the importance of her
 role when she said in an interview with
 Ligaya Fruto of the Honolulu Star-
 Bulletin that her goal during her hus-
 band's tenure is to work toward the
 advancement of the arts.  She is par-
 ticularly interested in establishing a na-
 tional theater and a national museum.
 As a member of one of the oldest political
 clans of the Philippines and as a grad-
 uate of the St. Paul's College and the
 Philippine Women's University College
 of Music and Arts, she is unusually well
 qualified for the task.
 The people of the Philippines look to
 Mrs. Marcos not only as a leader in the
 arts, but also as a symbol of the good
 that will come to them during the ad-
 ministration of President Marcos. As a
 person who has met Mrs: Marcos and
 who has been completely charmed by her
 beauty and personality, I believe thatthe
 people of the Philippines will not be dis-
 appointed.         -                 -
 I commend for your reading the in-
 teresting article by Miss Fruto, about the
 First Lady of the Philippines which ap-
 peared in the January 18, 1966, issue of
 the Honolulu Star-Bulletin:
 MRS. MARCOS SEEKS PHILIPPINE -ISLANDS NA-
 TIONAL THEATER, MUSEUM
 (EDITOR'S NoTE.-Star-Bulletin staff writer
 Ligaya Fruto left the Philippines yesterday
 aboard the liner President Cleveland for her
 return to Hawaii.  She has been on an exten-
 sive tour of the Far East.  This latest article
 is an exclusive interview with the new First
 Lady  of  the  Philippines,  Mrs.  Ferdinand
 Marcos.)
 (By Ligaya Fruto)
 MANILA,  PHILIPPINES.-"TO keep up with
 Ferdinand (Marcos) you have to have some
 kind of a mind," said Mrs. Marcos, First
 Lady of the Philippines, who is noted for the
 beauty of her face and form.
 Filipinos torn by political strife, repeated
 disillusionment, and the economic and moral
 ills that threaten their survival are agreed
 on one thing:
 They believe they have one of the most
 beautiful and capable First Ladies in the
 world today.
 Tall for a Filipino and with the serene,
 honey-colored radiance of a true Malayan
 beauty, Imelda Romualdez Marcos has the
 warmth and charm which have swayed voters
 and impressed diplomats and make her the
 greatest asset to a man of Marcos' brilliance
 and ambition.
 That she has a mind, too, she demonstrated
 during an interview in Malacanang Palace,
 the White House of the Philippines.
 In a simple linen dress, with gold-toned
 pearl jewelry that were her husband's Christ-
 mas gifts to her, she looked as calm and un-
 ruffled at 11:30 a.m., as she must have looked
 at 8:30, or some 20 visitors before.
 "I seem to be busier than Ferdinand,"
 she laughed.  "He was through for the morn-
 ing three visitors ago.  But I don't mind.
 It takes two to do a job like this.
 "I have no illusions about the difficulty of
 this position.  But although I am young in
 years (she's 33) and in experience, I know I
 can seek the counsel of older and wiser
 people.
 "I have confidence that my husband and
 I can do the job."
 Mrs. Marcos' pet- project is the establish-
 ment of a national theater and a national
 museum.
 "Filipinos by their heritage are musicians
 and  artists,"  she  explained.   "Everywhere
 you go musicians are appreciated.
 "Japan is now becoming the first nation in
 musical development in Asia.      Why not the
 Philippines? We., have the best musicians-
 everywhere-here.
 "The same thing with culture. We've been
 using fine porcelain and china even before
 other peoples in the world.  Yet our wonder-
 ful  artifacts are  gathering  dust in  some
 school warehouses, unseen and unappreci-
 ated.
 "I'd like to ask Ferdinand to work for
 the passage of a bill to prevent artifacts from
 leaving the country.  We should have them
 on display in a museum to show the rich-
 ness of our culture."
 A national theater and a museum are nec-
 essary if Filipinos are to be made aware of
 'this heritage.
 "Awareness is half the battle," she said.
 "I have to work to get these two essential
 national institutions within the 4 years
 of Ferdinand's administration.  No matter
 how much I might strive to get them done
 after his term, I may not have the influence
 to accomplish what I should.  -          .
 "So I'll have to work hard in the next 4
 years."

 Ellison McKissick
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. W. J. BRYAN DORN
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 iN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. DORN.  Mr. Speaker, in the pass-
 ing of Ellison McKissick, South Carolina,
 the South, and the United States lost a
 great humanitarian, a pioneer industrial-
 ist, and a great American.
 Mr. McKissick was president of the
 Pmerican Textile Manufacturers Insti-
 tute in 1950. Thus honored by those in
 the textile industry, he very ably served
 L iae entire industry and our country dur-
 ing a critical period of world history.
 The following splendid editorial, which
 is a fitting eulogy to Mr. McKissick, ap-
 peared in the Greenville News on Feb-
 rila,ry 2, 1966:
 1!iLLISON SHIYTII MCKi side
 The story of the life of Ellison Smyth Mc-
 l ssick, the manner in which he lived it,
 t ie productive uses to which he put it, and
 t..)e  accomplishments  which  marked  it,
 a:'could be an inspiration to the builders of
 the new South for generations.
 An engineer by profession, it gentleman by
 instinct, and a textile pioneer by circum-
 sacnce and choice, Mr. McKissick made an
 extraordinarily strong impression on his era.
 Wherever the name was  known, it was
 highly respected among business and indus-
 trial leaders.  Wherever the man himself was
 known, he was held in esteem and affection.
 And nowhere was this more vividly illus-
 trated than by the regard held for him by the
 men and women who worked, not for him
 but with him for that was his method of op-
 e-ation,  in  the family  enterprise  he,  his
 father and sons acquired and developed in
 part but mainly built from the ground up.
 They have kept it a family enterprise by
 daring to try the new and to be different in
 this day of stock trades and mergers.  Many
 textile  innovations  started  in McKissick-
 owned and operated plants, for Mr. McKis-
 sick had an affinity for new ideas.  One of
 the most recent rounds of wage increases
 shouted in the Alice Manufacturing Co. of
 Easley.
 Mr. McKissick's  relations  with  his  em-
 ployees, or coworkers, was highly personal.
 lie knew hundreds of them by name and
 many present employees are of the second
 nod third generations to find careers in his
 plants.  In lean times, he helped to provide
 schools, homes, and churches for his people.
 In better times, he shared the profits of the
 company with them.
 Mr. McKissick was noted for a personal
 diffidence unusual in a man of his accom-
 p?ishments.  Although  a  man  of  many
 t?,lents, he abhorred the public spotlight.
 ome years ago a reporter for the News
 )proached Mr. McKissick with the idea of
 (1:)ing a story on his ability as an architect-
 engineer.  At the time the textile executive
 was busy drawing up the plans for a new
 toil], something few if any of his contem-
 p:araries could have done.  Courteously but
 firmly the reporter was rebuffed and told-
 without a trace of sarcasm but with simple
 honesty-that in Mr. Kissick's opinion there
 were any number of things more interesting
 to report.
 Ile was literally and figuratively a builder
 of the southern textile industry.  He headed
 same of its organizations and liaison com-
 tniitees and led it into new and better paths.
 When he decided to expand, or build a new
 plant, the result was invariably something
 d_l1erent and more modern.
 Personally, he  was strikingly  handsome
 and
 courtly in manner, treating all men,
 great or humble, as equals.  His quiet man-
 ner never quite hid the spring steel of the
 war hero he was in 1917-18 or the compas-
 sionate but firmly competent industrialist
 he became.
 We extend to his family, to whom he in-
 parted so many of hia  fine qualities,  our
 deepest sympathy.   We and thousands of
 others share their loss and their grief.
 H.R? 12456 and H.R. 12478-Horton
 Bills To Attack Water Pollution
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. FRANK HORTON
 OF NEW YORK
 IN              HE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. HORTON.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 pieased to announce my introduction of
 two new legislative measures, :H.R. 12456
 and H.R. 12478, to focus an increasing
 Federal attack on the Nation's leading
 natural resources problem, water pollu-
 tion.
 One of the lessons of living is that
 we do not always see everything we are
 paying for and sometimes we do not
 even realize how high these costs are.
 Water pollution is a prime  example.
 This contamination of streams, rivers,
 and lakes is expensive for every one of its.
 Po:aution increases the cost to munic-
 ipalities and industries of                                                       obtaining
 fresh water,, it impairs recreational re-
 sources making them more costly to
 maintain,  and  poisons  in  the water
 around us destroy useful aquatic life.
 I have developed a special interest in
 water pollution because of my service on
 the Natural Resources and Power Sub-
 committee of the House Committee on
 Government  Operations.   Among  our
 accomplishments so far was persuading
 the President to issue an Executive order
 directing all Federal agencies in the Na-
 tion to clean up their own facilities.
 A .second attack came with the passage
 by Congress last year of the Water
 Quality Act.  This legislation provides
 for the establishment and enforcement
 of antipollution standards in interstate
 streams. It also increases Federal finan-
 cial assistance for construction of corn-
 m.unity sewage plants.
 However, I feel there is much more to
 be done to control water pollution, and
 with that in mind I introduced this new
 legislation to cope with the ever-increas-
 ing problem..
 One bill, H.R. 12478, gives a tax incen-
 tive to industries that build waste treat-
 ment works.
 The second bill, H.R. 12456, amends
 present Federal law to further help cities,
 towns, and villages improve their sewage
 facilities.
 These  legislative  proposals  are  in-
 tended to make an effective end to water
 pollution  a  national priority by  e11-
 couraging local governments to match
 greater Federal assistance and by stimu-
 lating businesses to spend the money
 necessary to control pollution-causing
 conditions from their factories.
 A515
 Mr. Speaker, I ask the attention of my
 colleagues to these measures and urge
 their prompt and positive consideration.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT F. ELLSWORTH
 OF KANSAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. ELLSWORTH.   Mr. Speaker,  I
 would like to draw the attention of my
 colleagues to a recent editorial in the
 Keene, N.H., Evening Sentinel, reprinted
 from the Newport, N.H., Argus-Cham-
 pion. It refers to a bill which Congress-
 man JAMES C. CLEVELAND, of New Hamp-
 shire, and I introduced along with eight
 of our colleagues.  I am pleased to in-
 clude the editorial at this point:
 IGNORANCE DANGEROUS
 The antics of scoop-happy, irresponsible
 news hawks in the coverage of the Lindbergh
 kidnaping trial constitute one of the most
 disgraceful chapters in the history of Amer-
 ican journalism.
 Worst than that, the public reacted to
 them in a series of Government edicts re-
 stricting the use of microphone and camera.
 edicts that today are helping to produce an
 ignorant electorate.
 Because of the excesses that made a circus
 of what should have been a most serious trial
 of an accused man who eventually went to
 the electric chair, the courts of the United
 States wrote canon 35, which holdsthat the
 use of a microphone or camera in the court-
 room "is calculated" to destroy the dignity
 of the court.
 In the 31 years since that trial, however,
 cameras  and  microphones  have  been  im-
 proved so that their presence would not even
 be noticed in a courtroom and most news-
 men have developed a realistic sense of re-
 sponsibility.
 So  the rule  that  prevents  the  use of
 camera or microphone to help the public
 understand the conduct of our courts, is as
 obsolete as the star chamber proceeding that
 the open trial is supposed to prevent.
 In the interest of freedom, of intelligent
 self-government, we need more of the real-
 istic reporting of public affairs that can be
 reinforced by the use of microphone and
 camera
 New Hampshire ought to be proud that
 Second District Congressman JAMES C. CLEVE-
 LAND is taking the lead in trying to give the
 people of America the right to know what
 their House of Representatives is doing.
 He has introduced bills that would permit.
 the use of microphone and camera in the
 House of Representatives.  Presidents of the
 United States, he notes, can cause electronic
 reporting from the House, but when they
 leave the Hall the microphones and cameras
 go too.
 "In my opinion, this is wrong," he says.
 "The electronic media, in the interests of
 elementary democracy, should be permitted
 to bring the public to the floor of the House
 to hear the debates which will decide their
 future."
 Mr. CLEVELAND'S bill ought to have the sup-
 port of every Congressman who does not fear
 that it will expose his incompetence as cu-
 pidity.
 And its principles ought to be written Into
 law not only in Washington, but in New
 Hampshire, to insure the right of every citi-
 zen to witness Government agencies at their
 work, and to look at every public record

 stepped up war on poverty, indeed, endorses
 a commitment deeper than any mere request
 for heavier poverty program funding.
 The earlier success of Mr. Shriver as crea-
 tor, nourisher, and deeply sensitive adminis-
 trator of the Peace Corps from infancy to
 international recognition made him a logical
 choice to lead on the battle front against
 poverty.
 Mr. Shriver will now have the challenging
 task, of testing of possible weapons for a
 home front war on poverty, then marshaling
 of the most suitable brains, stratagems, and
 agencies into a full scale task force capable
 of achieving victory.
 It is a tribute to the toughness of a man
 that Mr. Shriver was able .to stretch himself
 so thin for so long at both the Peace Corps
 job and the poverty war assignment.  This
 toughness seemed at odds with the high de-
 gree of sensitivity with which he met every
 driving inquiry of every American youth
 seeking fresh challenge, and new Idealism
 in the Peace Corps.
 Those who have observed and admired the
 work of Mr. Shriver under two Presidents
 have no doubt that he will breathe into his
 new full time job the same dedication and
 inspiration that made the Peace Corps ac-
 cepted around the world-and at home as
 well. .
 President Johnson has made a good selec-
 tion and the Nation should benefit from .it.
 Australia Supports Decision To Resume
 Bombing
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLEMENT J. ZABLOCKI
 or WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. ZABLOCKI.  Mr. Speaker, reac-
 tions to President Johnson's recent deci-
 sion to resume bombing of military tar-
 gets in North Vietnam have come from
 nations around the world. Undoubtedly
 one of the most significant of these, how-
 ever, has been the expression of support
 and endorsement registered by the Aus-
 tralian Government through the coun-
 try's Prime Minister, the Right Honor-
 able Harold Holt.
 The fact that the Australian Govern-
 ment speaks here as a participant in and
 not a mere observer of the defense of
 South Vietnam from Communist aggres-
 sion gives this statement validity and
 importance. As one of the countries who
 share our commitment to uphold the
 rights and dignity of the people of South
 Vietnam, Australia stands firm in recog-
 nizing this decision as "realistic and nec-
 essary."
 Prime Minister Holt fully points out
 the true significance of the sincere and
 genuine efforts of the United States to-
 ward peaceful  negotiations.   Regret-
 ably, in Peiping and Hanoi those efforts
 were met by repeated accusations of in-
 sincerity.  Further demonstrating its
 contempt for those efforts, North Viet-
 nam used the bombing lull to rebuild
 its own war machine.
 Prime Minister Holt puts the vital is-
 sues relating to the resumption Of bomb-
 ing into perspective.  I, therefore, rec-
 ommend his statement to my colleagues.
 TEXT  OF  STATEMENT  ISSUED  BY  THE  PRIME
 MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THE RIGHT HON-
 ORABLE HAROLD HOLT, ON FEBRIIARY 1, 1956
 President Johnson has made a statement
 about the resumption of bombing in North
 Vietnam directed against installations and
 transport routes used for the conduct of
 warfare in South Vietnam,
 The bombing was suspended in December,
 even though an earlier pause in bombing
 last May had evoked no positive response,
 and even though there were strong military
 reasons  for the  continuance of bombing.
 The North Vietnamese authorities had, for
 a period of months, increased the rate of
 infiltration of armed men to South Vietnam.
 In the last 6 months of 1965, many thou-
 sands of North Vietnamese soldiers entered
 South Vietsiam as units and equipped for
 open warfare.
 The purpose of the bombing has been not
 to destroy the regime in Hanoi or break the
 economy of North Vietnam, or to shatter
 the basis of the people's livelihood, but to
 damage or destroy those military instal-
 lations and facilities which enable Hanoi to
 supply and support its own forces in the
 support the American decision as realistic
 and necessary.  It remains our hope, how
 ever, that the North Vietnamese and those
 associated  with  them will recognize that
 their aggression will not be allowed to suc-
 ceed.  We must hope that the time is not
 distant when they will join in finding a just
 and peaceful solution.  While the aggression
 continues, it will be met firmly by resistance
 in which Australia will play its part.  We
 know that the United States will remain
 alert and ready to explore any indication of
 willingness on the other side to move to-
 wards a settlement on just terms.
 The U.S. readiness in this respect is indi-
 cated by the request of the U.S. Government
 for an urgent meeting of the Security Coun-
 cil. to consider the situation in Vietnam.

 The mandate from Congress to the Depart-
 ment of Agriculture is that it he responsive
 to the wishes of the farmers concerned in
 producing milk it is hardly doing that.
 i .ecent hearings on the marketing order
 clearly demonstrated  that producers ship-
 ping  to  the            Philadelphia  milkshed  over-
 whelmingly  favor  the  present                    marketing
 arrangement.
 The dispute now raging does not      affect
 prices to the consumer.   It does, though,
 seriously affect dairy farmers, many of them
 in Kent and Cecil Counties, where the an-
 nual loss under the proposed change would
 amount to almost a million dollars.
 These  farmers  want  violators  punished.
 it is to their interest to eliminate the chfsel-
 Aug brokers and crooked middlemen who take
 kickbacks from unscrupulous suppliers.
 't'here is no reason why the USDA can't
 change  the present order to make it   en-
 lorcible.
 While the price to the consumer may not
 be affected, the loss to the economy right
 here in Kent County would be seriously felt.
 Tlms it behooves, not only  the milk-pro-
 ducing farmers but all of us to do something
 al:'out it. Congressman Roesas C. B. MORTON, gave
 great support to the milk producers during
 the recent Federal hearings in Philadelphia.
 We suggest you,  all  of us, write him in
 support of our farmers.
 Many of my colleagues here in Con-

 O'IIARE-TO-MIDWAY CREWLESS SKYBIIS CALLED
 POSSIBILITY
 (By Fletcher Wilson, Sun-Times corre-

 PITTSBURGH.--George L. DeMent said hear
 Tuesday, after riding an experimental sky-
 bus, that such a vehicle might someday serve'
 to connect Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Air-
 ports.
 The chairman of the Chicago Transit Au-
 thorilT said the crewless, rubber-tired bus
 run by computers on an elevated track would
 be a "natural," for transporting passengers
 between the two fields, if Midway become s
 busy again.
 DeNfent  and  Bernard  L.  Marsh,  Skokie
 Village manager, took. a ride on the light -

 Present transit cars range in weight from
 45,000 pounds in Chicago to 80,000 in New
 York City.
 "Here is the challenge," Hazard said.
 "Do we have the wit to get rapid transit
 out of the ground?  Do we have the engi-

 HON. ROMAN C. PUCINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA'T'IVES
 Wednesday, January 12, 1966
 Mr. PUCINSKI.                       Mr. Speaker, the Chi-
 cago Sun-Times carried a most revealing
 article  by  its                    distinguished  writer,
 Fletcher Wilson, on the possibility of
 inking Chicago's Midway Airport with
 O'Hare Field in Chicago through the use
 of a new skybus service.
 My colleagues are aware of my con-
 tinuing effort to reactivate Midway so
 that some of the congestion we now ex-
 perience at O'Hare, and in particular,
 the long delay in the holding pattern
 before landing, can be alleviated by
 transferring a greater degree of flight
 operations from O'Hare to Midway.
 I was very pleased to learn that Mr.
 George L. DeMent, one of the most re-
 s,pected constituents in my congressional
 district, who serves as chairman of the
 Chicago Transit Authority has indicated
 that possibilities exist for linking Mid-
 way with O'Hare through this new type
 of transportation.
 There is no question that one of the
 main. deterrents for reactivating Midway
 on the major scale has been a_ link of
 rapid transit connection between the two
 airports.
 The project was sponsored. by the Pcrt
 Authority of Allegheny Cou:u'y, operator of
 the Greater Pittsburgh Transit System, which
 still includes red streetcars.
 Westinghouse  subcontracted  portions  of
 the nearly 2-mile-long skybus system to 30
 other companies.
 Tuesday, for the first time, three 18,0e!0-
 pound cars seating 28 and holding 70 persons,
 ran around the clock to show it could be done
 at one push of a button.
 The cars Operate at 50 miles per hour on
 a looped track set up on an attractive con-
 crete and steel structure supported by single
 I-beam columns.
 In addition to serving as a connection be-
 tween airports, DeMent said,  "the skyhus
 would be right for carrying passengers from
 the Loop to McCormick. Place if somebody
 would subsidize the operatiorn."
 "This is the most exciting transit de,: el-
 opment I have seen," he asserted.
 Marsh said steps are being taken to acquire
 a strip of the old North Shore Line right-of-
 way, from the end of the Skokie Swift at
 Dempster in Skokie, 9,000 feet north to Old
 Orchard Road.  The Chicago & North West-
 ern Railway now owns the land
 "Skybus trains or conventional buses could
 operate there," Marsh said.  The project is
 dependent: upon obtaining Federal or other
 funds and consent of the CTA to operate the
 line.
 DeMent repeated to Marsh the CTA's 'ra-
 ditional position:
 '1lVe will take on any line guaranteed not
 to show a loss."
 AIRPORT CONTRACT
 Westinghouse has signed a $3 million con-
 tract to install a skyhus at a new airport in

 Mr. FULTON  of  Tennessee.  Mr.
 Speaker, this country has had the good
 fortune of having top administrators at
 the head of many' departments and bu-
 reaus. Of these, none has worked harder
 or been more effective than R. Sargent
 Shriver.
 Those of us who have had the oppor-
 tunity to work with Mr. Shriver knew
 that he has performed distinguished
 service on two fronts-as the head of the
 administration's war on poverty and as
 Director of the Peace Corps.
 As the Nashville Tennessean has ob-
 served, the fact that Mr- Shriver will
 now devote his full time to fighting
 poverty demonstrates "the sincerity of
 President Johnson's expressed intentions
 to make certain that the poor shall riot
 suffer fresh deprivations to finance an
 escalation  of  the  Nation's  Vietnam
 effort."
 The Tennessean's editorial is a tribute
 to both the President's good judgment
 and Mr. Shriver's ability, and I ask per-
 mission to have it inserted in the RECORD.
 GOOD SELECTION IN MR. SHRIVER
 The sincerity of President Johnson's ex-
 pressed intentions to make certain that the

 In view of these facts, I have urged the
 President to issue a directive to the Budg-

 tire $402 million authorized by the Con-
 gress for fiscal 1966 to meet the loan
 needs of the rural electric cooperatives.
 in addition, I feel it is imperative that
 an REA deficiency loan fund be author-
 ized for the current fiscal year in order
 to reduce the loan application backlog
 to a manageable size.
 Since the $270 million budget request
 for the REA electric program is patently
 inadequate to fill an 'expected $413 mil-
 lion loan need in fiscal 1967, I urge my
 colleagues in the House and Senate to
 join me in supporting an increase in the
 REA appropriation or the establishment
 of an adequate contingency reserve. Use
 of such a contingency reserve should be
 based on the need for funds by the Na-

 Congress intended this money to be used
 if and as needed.  The need existed in
 fiscal 1965 and continues to exist in fiscal
 1966, but the Budget Bureau has chosen
 to regard the contingency reserve as un-
 touchable.
 Mr. Speaker, the rural electric coopera-
 tives of the Nation are developing a plan
 designed to bring outside supplemental
 capital into the program and thus to
 minimize the need for direct appropria-
 tions. In truly cooperative fashion, they
 are working on a proposal which would
 establish a cooperative bank for rural
 electric systems, a credit institution
 which the rural electrics would ulti-
 mately own and operate.
 It is commendable that our rural elec-
 tric co-ops are taking steps to imple-
 ment such a forward-looking proposal.
 Congressional action will be necessary to
 put this plan into effect, and it will have
 my active support when it comes before
 the Congress.  Meanwhile, we must as-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JACK EDWARDS
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 19,66
 Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, there has been some talk about
 "consensus" in recent months.
 For most of the latter half of 1965 we
 on our side of the aisle were talking of
 the rising signs of inflation. But a con-
 sensus was  lacking,  since the White
 House insisted there was no problem of
 inflation.
 Now that has all changed. The change
 is described well in the following edito-
 rial from the Evening Star of Washing-
 ton for February 2:
 SPEAKING IN UNISON
 William McChesney Martin, chairman of
 the Federal Reserve Board, found himself a
 rather lonely man as 1965 ended.
 He had served notice back in August that
 he was worried about the possibility of in-
 flation. By November, when word got around
 that the Federal Reserve was thinking of
 tightening up money by increasing the dis-
 count rate, the reaction from the adminis-
 tration was not long in coming.
 Treasury Secretary Fowler, following the
 easy-money, expansionist philosophy of the
 White House, declared that such an increase
 to dampen inflation would be "premature
 and unwise."  Within the next (few days a
 startling example of the Johnson treatment
 ensued.   Commerce Secretary Connor and
 Laobr Secretary Wirtz in separate speeches
 suggested there was still plenty of room in
 the economy for expansion without inflation.
 Then Joseph Laitin, a White House press
 aid, told reporters the administration didn't
 "consider inflation a major threat at this
 time.
 The climax to all this came December 2
 when the President himself told the Business
 Council in Washington that economic growth
 in 1966 would not be accompanied by in-
 flation.   "We can produce the goods and
 services we require," he declared, "without
 overheating our economy."
 The rest, of course, is history. Martin & Co.
 ignored the drumfire of pronouncements and
 announced a raise In the discount rate De-
 cember 5.   The President,  obviously  dis-
 pleased, deplored the action and said it
 should have been postponed until the Fed-
 eral Reserve had the "full facts."
 Well, a funny thing has happened at 1600
 Pennsylvania Avenue.  In his economic mes-
 sage the other day, the President conceded

 to show the "real them."  No teleprompter,
 no reading of speeches prepared by someone
 else.  No cosmetics. except perhaps as a cor-
 rective measure where a person looks worse
 on TV than on the street.
 1,'urther, candidates should be examined by
 a  single  interrogator  so  that  consecutive
 thinking   can be  followed,  and responsive
 answers can be pressed for, while with several
 questioners a question more easily can be
 evaded.
 To undertake this, a station must take the
 initiative in providing a skilled and fair in-
 terrogator and seeing that he is properly
 prepared.  The problem of fairness is a diffi-
 cult one because a questioner can conceal a
 bias far more easily than the witness, the
 candidate, who must take positions, even if
 they are blurred.  The interrogator's responsi-
 bility is a large one because although he
 cannot misquote a candidate as a writing
 reporter can, he can misrepresent him by
 guiding the subject and influencing the tone
 of the discussion
 The questions should emphasize the im-
 portant  issues.   In  this  way  the  general
 neglect of them can be compensated, while
 the responses cannot but help to disclose the
 personality of the candidates.
 This format Should be made an adversary
 proceeding for the joint purposes of bringing
 out the truth and dramatizing the spectacle.
 Wigmore claimed that the practice of cross-
 examination constituted the most powerful
 engine for eliciting the truth.  Cross-exami-

 votes.
 ]Despite the allegation of politics and in-
 elliciency in the poverty war and the ques-
 tionable need for these programs with drop-
 ping unemployment, the President asks for
 another $390 million for an effort which has
 accomplished very little.
 Tucked away in the total request is a small
 aniount. -$2 million-for the Garrison irri-
 gation  project  construction.  This  project
 was approved by Congress when the people
 themselves in the area involved showed they
 wanted irrigation and were willing to repay
 the Federal investment.  This is one Fed-
 eral expenditure which was sought by the
 people involved and which will be financed
 cations will then have to be carried over
 to f_scal 1967, where it will be added to
 the  $413  million  in new  applications
 which  the   rural  electric cooperatives
 have indicated they will be submitting to
 REA in fiscal 1.967.  Obviously, the $270
 million electric: loan program proposed
 in the administration's fiscal 1967 budget
 cannot begin to take care of the fiscal
 1966 backlog, let alone the new applica-
 tions.
 Mr. Speaker, I am vitally concerned
 with the economic and social well-being
 of the rural area which I have been
 privileged to represent in Congress for
 the past 24 years.  Because of this, I
 have a deep and longstanding interest
 in the operations of the numerous Fed-
 eral programs which have been designed
 to combat poverty and aid in the devel-
 opment of rural America.
 Unfortunately, many of these pro-
 grams  appear  to  be  missing  their
 goal.  This criticism cannot be made of
 the REA electric and telephone program.
 Like the Farmers Home Administration
 and the Small Business Administration
 programs, the REA program operates at
 the grassroots level.   Its accomplish-
 ments are of direct, immediate, and last-
 ing benefit to the rural areas served by
 REA's electric and telephone borrowers.
 The 10 rural electric cooperatives in
 my home district in Wisconsin have done
 much more than simply providing lights
 to their 43,073 consumer-members and
 their families.  'The power furnished by
 these co-ops is making possible the re-
 creational and industrial developments
 which are so essential to the revitaliza-
 tion of our depressed rural economy.

 Mr. O'KONSKI.  Mr. Speaker, in stitd-
 yin; the administration's proposed budg-
 rural electric systems.  It is not enough
 to string some electric lines in rural.
 America and then consider that the job
 of rural electrification has been coi:n-
 pleted.  Our rural electric cooperatives
 must have access to adequate amounts
 of growth capital if they are to be able
 to furnish the increasing amounts of
 electricity required by a growing rur.Il
 economy. If a budgetary tourniquet is
 applied to REA loan funds, the produc-
 tive capacity of our rural areas will be
 the real victim of the resulting anemia.
 Mr. Speaker, the Congress recognized
 this basic truth when it provided for an

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. BEN REIFEL
 OF SOUTH DAKOTA .
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr.   REIFEL.                      Mr.  Speaker,  under
 leave to extend my remarks, I should like
 to have included in the Appendix of the
 RECORD the address of Gen. Harold K.
 Johnson, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army,
 at the 81st annual meeting of the Aber-
 deen Chamber of Commerce, Aberdeen,
 S. Dak., on Thursday, January 20, 1966,
 in which he discussed the Vietnam situa-
 tion.
 General and Mrs. Johnson share a
 warm place in the hearts of many South
 Dakotans and, particularly, in Aberdeen.
 Mrs. Johnson was born and reared in
 Aberdeen and lived there while her hus-
 band was serving in the Pacific during
 World War II and during his ordeal as a
 Japanese prisoner of war after Bataan.
 General Johnson joined his wife in
 Aberdeen at the end of the war.  They
 became well-known and respected citi-
 zens in the community.  The Johnsons
 still cherish the many friendships found-
 ed during the time they lived there.
 General Johnson was the subject of the
 cover story of the December 10, 1965, is-
 sue of Time magazine.
 The speech follows:
 I am sure that you have heard many times
 why we are in Vietnam, but it bears repeat
 ing.          I have found it difficult to find a better
 expression of our obligation than one writ-
 ten in a letter by a young Army captain to
 his wife shortly before he was killed in ac-
 tion.  This letter was not written for pub-
 lication although his wife subsequently per-
 mitted it to be published.  It was a private
 communication between husband and wife,
 where the husband was expressing better
 than most of us can some of his innermost
 thoughts and feelings.  I quote:
 "I feel that there is too much talk of
 despair. * *  *   Above all, this is a war of
 mind and spirit     And it is a war which can
 about 400 to 500 men for a specific engage-
 ment and then disperse.
 These enemy formations were receiving di-
 rections on a weekly or sometimes more fre-
 quent basis from Hanoi, and the South Viet-
 namese Army was just barely holding its
 own.  Today, those same gallant Vietnamese
 soldiers are battling battalions and regiments
 of Vietcong who have now been reinforced
 by major elements of at least three divisions
 of North Vietnamese troops.  They continue
 to receive direction from Hanoi, but on a
 daily and sometimes an hourly basis.
 However, significant friendly support has
 now come to the assistance of the Vietnamese.
 Korea, with her intimate knowledge of the
 terror, the humiliation, and the devastation
 associated with Communist aggression, has
 provided a combat division.   Australia, an
 ultimate objective of Communist expansion
 in the Pacific, is providing an infantry bat-
 talion, some airlift forces, advisers, and medi-
 cal teams.   This Australian battalion has
 just  completed  an  operation in the  Iron
 Triangle area north of Saigon, with elements
 of our 1st Infantry Division. New Zealand
 has sent both combat forces and civil assist-
 ance teams.   Altogether, 38 nations are pro-
 viding assistance either of a military or of an
 economic or civil support nature and, of

 ment suddenly disappeare   o
 dered.  Government tax collectors were driv-
 en out and over a period of years, that vil-
 lage became a Vietcong village.
 This course of events has  been followed
 in many villages in South Vietnam.   The
 number is not known, but there are about
 10,000 hamlets in Vietnam, and these ham-
 lets are grouped together into about 2,560
 villages.  In addition, there are major metro-
 politan areas such as Saigon, Da Nang, and
 Hue.    Cells of Communists exist in the larger
 cities but the extent of their control is not
 the same as in the rural areas.
 OTHER WEAPONS USED
 To accelerate this process of infiltration
 and takeover, the Vietcong use the weapon
 of intimidation and terror, going to any ex-
 treme of brutality which they believe neces-
 sary to destroy the fabric of society.  As a
 typical illustration, during the week of Jan-
 uary 2-8, the Vietcong murdered 24 civilians,
 wounded 73, and kidnaped 328.  Many of the
 civilians were province or hamlet officials,
 schoolteachers,  or  Buddhist  monks.   To
 portray the magnitude of these atrocities
 in relation to U.S. population, which is more
 than 12 times larger than the population of
 South Vietnam, the figure would be over 5,000
 U.S. civilians killed, wounded, and kidnaped
 by the enemy during the week.
 The takeover by infiltration of the politi-
 cal structure and by intimidation and terror
 apparently was too slow for the Communists,
 for, in 1959, they greatly intensified their
 efforts,  and boosted  them  again  in  1961.
 It was at this stage that additional Ameri-
 can  advisory  effort                                                                                                                                   and  materiel    were

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -APPENDIX           ?uarr/ 1, .1966
 When ,you consider that Saigon is at the
 end of a supply line nearly 10.000 miles long
 and that it takes 19 days for it fast ship to
 make the trip, it takes time to build up
 stockpiles to sustain the military effort.
 As an added complication, supplies that
 were ordered a month ago may have a lower
 priority for use by the time that they ar-
 rive.                  A combat action in Vietnam may have
 resulted in a heavier than planned consump-
 tion of some other items of supply that are
 on other ships.   Moreover, many  supplies
 that. necessarily are shipped to Saigon have
 to be reloaded on other ships and carried
 up  the coast.   The  Vietcong have  cut  a
 number of roads throughout  South Viet-
 nam;  hence, it is safer and less costly to
 move supplies by sea to coastal ports and
 then inland.  Of course, we have an exten-
 sive in-coup try air logistic system that also
 helps the supply problem.
 As to the impact of this logistic buildup,
 many commanders  volunteered the  infor-
 mation to me while I was in VietnaIn that
 there had been no combat action undertaken
 that was inhibited in any way by a lack of
 supplies.  However, it is natural that in the
 early stages of a rapid buildup such as has
 occurred in Vietnam, that our support will
 be thin in places for varying periods of time.
 Normally, we try to have supplies on hand
 to  support  the  troops  for  a  considerable
 period. It   should   be  evident  that  these
 supplies must be built up and at the pres-
 ent time our stockpiles are growing at a
 rapid rate.  When I was there in December.
 we had then built up to well over one-half
 or  what  they  ultimately will    be.   Thus,
 the fact that a ship is not unloaded does
 not mean that our soldiers are suffering for
 the supplies that are aboard that ship.     We
 have a very solid foundation for a logistic
 system that will support whatever level of
 effort our President decides is necessary.
 IS.SOOPS ARE CONFIDENT
 How and what are our troops doing?           I
 spent about 8 days visiting just as many
 units as I could cover in  that period      of
 time, starting out early in the morning and
 li.nishing up late at night. Everywhere that
 I went our commanders and our soldiers
 were simply  filled  with confidence.     They -
 have demonstrated an ability to lick this
 treacherous, cunning enemy in direct com-
 bat.  't'hey have demonstrated an ability to
 dig him out of his tunnels and caves.     They
 have demonstrated an ability to avoid his
 booby traps, his bear traps, his punji stakes.
 and his mines.  We are still taking casualties
 every day from these devices, but our troops
 have learned to cope with them and         are
 doing a simply magnificent job.
 Our forces are confronted by two kind:; of
 military  action.   First,  because  our hell-
 copiers enable  us to range far and wide,
 we are searching out enemy formations so
 that they can be taken under attack.
 This is a :"eassuring capability because we
 should be able to avoid being surprised by
 enemy mass formations and defeat the parts
 of the mass before they can assemble into
 an overwhelming force.  This was done by
 the  lit Cavalry Division in  the In Dram,
 Valley Battle in mid-November.  Second, we
 must contin-ie to search out long established
 enemy hideout or safe haven areas.   The
 battles  thai, have occurred last week and
 going  on  into  this  week  in  places with.
 strange names like Cu Chi, Lai Khe. and the
 Michelin Plantation are examples of this kind
 or action.  Our forces have uncovered large
 quantities of supplies.
 Last week:  for example, one unit discov-
 ered  enough  rice  to feed  three  Vietcong
 regiments for about a year. Those regiments
 trust now find another source of supply.
 Some of this they will attempt to take from
 the farmers and thus create an animosity
 that serves to dry up the sea in which the
 guerrilla fish swim,  using Mao Tse-tung's
 expression.
 At the same time, our forces are engaged
 in  other  kinds  of  constructive.  country-
 building endeavors.                                                                                    They do not fight all
 the time.  When they are not fighting, small
 teams are out helping the villagers rebuild
 schoolrooms, or building new ones, improv-
 ings sanitation, providing fresh water, per-
 haps helping a widow repair her house.  A
 most important activity is the valuable serv-
 ice  performed  by  our  medical personnel.
 Wherever our troops are located, (,o r doctors
 and corpsmen are not only treating, the sick,
 but are teaching the benefits of basic hygiene.
 They are giving of themselves and are giving
 heart, as Captain Spruill said,  to  an em-
 battled people.
 VTF.TNAMESE  FIGHT  WELT
 Iii reporting the events in South Vietnam
 today,  our papers very naturally    tend  to
 highlight the activities of the U.S. ;;)fees and
 to a lesser degree the activities of the Aus-
 tralians  and  the                                                                                                                Koreans.  U.S  activities
 are described quite fully, althou,,h the ac-
 tions in which casualties occur s 'wally re-
 ceive a special recognition.                                                                                                             On the other
 hand, the thousands of actions that are con-
 ducted by the Vietnamese forces each day
 are largely overlooked.
 I want to assure you that the Vietnamese
 are fighting and fighting well.  They have
 demonstrated a very remarkable resilience
 and an amazing ability to absorb punish-
 inent, when one thinks back upon the num-
 ber of years that they have been fighting.  Do
 nut discount the Vietnamese effort and do
 not get the impression or the idea that the
 United States is taking over the war. This
 is still a Vietnamese war, and white they are
 pulling  all  that  their  capabilities enable
 them to  pull,  they continue to need the
 help of the United States and other allies.
 From my visits to Vietnam, I seea country
 in deep trouble.  I see a country    it need of
 unwavering help.   I see a people ravaged by
 war because Hanoi and Peiping continue to
 export the tools of violence and t , seek ab-
 solute political domination over the helpless.
 I see a, succession of brutalities, of innocents
 murdered in the night, of kidnal`ings with
 no return, of exploded mines maiming chil-
 dren and parents in buses-all bees use Hanoi
 controls and fuels the aggression in South
 Vietnam.  I see a determined people who
 have been fighting communism since 1954,
 bleeding in human lives on the average of
 500 soldiers a week, desperately striving to
 establish political order so that they can live,
 prosper, and enjoy the blessings of freedom,
 in peace.
 Yet, I also see that rather than cease ag-
 gression in  the face of South Vietnamese
 resiliency and determination to reset, Hanoi
 has increased support of t:he Vietce ng by in-
 filtrating more supplies and North Vietnam-
 ese regular army combat forces.  Thus, we
 have had to respond with combat forces to
 the South Vietnamese call for assistance, and
 until Hanoi halts its aggression, we must
 continue to defend freedom in So.ath Viet-
 nam.
 WIDOW'S REPLY
 I receive many touching letters from some
 of our soldiers and from the families of some
 of our soldiers, who understand what they
 are fighting for.                     They understand the im-
 portance of today's task in Vietnam in re-
 lation to America's continued freedom.
 In  closing, I would like to read a brief
 quotation  from  a  young  mother.  I had
 lunch with her husband a year ago in Decem-
 ber in Vietnam.                                                                              He was a brilliant young
 officer, among the top of his West Point class,
 a Rhodes scholar, and one of the people that
 we had looked to for leadership in tomorrow's
 Army.  He was killed by a sniper's bullet as
 he was accompanying a Vietnamese patrol

 a reply from her.  In this reply, she ;:aid;

 Red's Long-Range Strategy
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. BOB WILSON
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. BOB WILSON.  Mr. Speaker, one
 of the most serious aspects of the South
 Vietnamese war is the manner in which
 Cambodia is assisting the Communist;
 aggression in Vietnam. Cambodia, which
 has received hundreds of millions of dol-
 lars in taxpayers' money in the form of
 aid, has betrayed our friendship and has
 virtually joined the camp of the Com-
 munist aggressors. For all too long there
 has been a reluctance among too many
 officials in this country to face up to the
 Cambodian problem and take the steps
 necessary to protect the lives of U.S.
 fighting men and our allies engaged. in
 the Vietnamese war, and whose efforts
 are handicapped by Communist utiliza-
 tion of Cambodia.
 Consequently, it was with considerable
 satisfaction. that we learned of the recent.
 report that our military commanders in
 South Vietnam have at least some lim-
 ited  authority  to  pursue  Communist
 forces from Vietnam across the Cam-
 bodian border.
 This situation is the subject of a very
 informative, column by Brig. Geri. James
 D. Hittle, USMC, retired, director of na-
 tional security and foreign affairs for the
 Veterans of Foreign Wars, appearing in
 the South Bay Daily Breeze, Torrance,
 Calif., and 'in other papers served by the
 Copley News Service.
 Because of the manner in which this
 column by the VFW national security
 director, General Hittle, explains the
 seriousness of Cambodia's assistance to
 Communist aggression, and specifically
 its effect upon the war in South Viet-
 nam, I include the column at the conclu-
 sion of these remarks:
 THE  CHANGING  SCENE:  REDS'  LONG-RANGE
 STRATEGY
 (By James D. Hittle, brigadier general. USMC,
 retired)
 WASHINGTON.-The decision to permit U.S.
 troops to pursue Communist units across the
 Cambodian border marks another critical step
 in the ever-widening war.
 It is about as close as one can come to a.
 jungle version of the seagoing "hot pursuit"
 doctrine.  From now on when Communist
 forces are getting pummeled on the South
 Vietnamese side of the border, they won't
 be able to drift back and thus escape com-
 bat defeat.
 But there is far more to the breaching of
 the Cambodian border sanctuary than the
 pursuit across it.

 terrorism is on the increase in the frontier

 All of this illustrates how the Communist
 general staffs look on the southeast Asian
 peninsula as a single arena.   The current
 phase of Red aggression requires the seizure
 of South Vietnam and the expulsion of U.S.
 power from it.  The reason: to clear their
 eastern flank.  If they can do this, they can,
 with greater freedom of action, then turn
 southward against Thailand and Malaysia.
 The decision to pursue across the Cambo-
 dian frontier is a partial recognition that we
 cannot restrict the conflict to the South Viet-
 nam sector when the Reds are waging war
 throughout the peninsula.

 VAST CHANGE IN GREENSBURG IN DECADE
 Greensburg is a different city than it was
 10 years ago.
 Residents of this community do not rec-
 ognize how far reaching this transformation
 has been as much as former residents upon
 their return here.
 The change has been gradual but sig-
 nificant.
 Advent of new schools and new public
 works brought about the dawn of a new era
 here and in Decatur County as well.
 In  1956,  the  principal  industries  were:
 Bohn Aluminum & Brass Corp., Consolidated
 Veneer Corp., now Mitchell Industries, Inc.,
 Cyclone Fence Co., and Dry Clime Lamp Co.
 Bohn continues as one of this city's most
 valued industries with a high record of stable
 employment.   Mitchell  Industries, Inc.,  is
 approaching its 20th year of production in
 Greensburg, marked by steady employment
 and expansion.
 A decade ago, Cyclone Fence Co. was sing-
 ing its swan song as a Greensburg industry.
 has increased from 5,009 in 1956 to 5,775 in
 1966.  Now in its third year is WTRE-FM
 ,
 which plans to buy property near Greensburg
 for future expansion.   Another operation,
 Decatur County REMC, has acquired land
 west of the city.  Two new shopping centers
 have been opened.
 Various utilities have expanded their op-
 erations during the past 10 years.  Public
 Telephone Corp. has installed a dial system,
 provided  for direct dialing and now uses
 a microwave tower.   The Decatur County
 Rural Water Corp. was formed in 1965. The
 Greensburg Municipal Water Works has ex-
 panded its system.
 In 1956, Edgewood Acres was the principal
 subdivision, adjacent to Greensburg. Not
 only has Edgewood Acres been expanded
 but over a half dozen new subdivisions have
 become the site of new homes.
 . Development of Lake Santee is becoming
 the equivalent in economic value to a new
 industry in Decatur County.
 Expansion in several Decatur County com-
 munities has occurred in the past decade,
 notably at Westport and St. Paul.
 Development of industry has brought new
 families to this community.  Key figures in
 the new industries have become active in the
 life of this community.
 The change in the past decade has brought
 to this community a balance between agri-
 culture and industry.  In the field of agri-
 culture, new peaks were registered in 1965

 Subterfuge Spending
 lXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 !PION. E. Y. BERRY
 OF   SOUTH DAKOTA
 N TIE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. BERRY. Mr. Speaker, a very ir,-
 teresting and illuminating editorial ap-
 peared in last week's issue of the Sturgis
 (S. Dak.) Tribune, entitled "Subterfuge
 Spending," which certainly is food for
 thought for every Member of Congress
 who last year voted for the Elementary
 arid Secondary Education Act, and who
 must certainly be interested now in how
 it is being administered.
 Under unanimous consent I insert the
 editorial in the RECORD and suggest. that
 every Member read it.  It follows:
 student from the wealthiest family in our
 public school system-  The act was obviously
 geared for urban centers where pockets of
 poverty can be easily identified.
 It became apparent some months ago that
 a more liberal interpretation of the act's
 provisions was necessary if South Dakota
 and Other States like it are to share in this
 massive federal aid to education program.
 So the Federal funds were allocated to the
 districts on the basis of the percentage of
 students each of them are estimated to have
 of the total number of families in the State
 with incomes under $3,000 per year counted
 in the last Federal census.
 The fact that each district is assumed to
 have some students from low-income fam-
 ilies automatically qualifies it for a share
 of the county's allocation.  However, specific
 projects not already in the school program
 are required for release of the Federal funds.
 A district may inaugurate more than one
 new  project, depending on its needs, but
 each project is evaluated independently on
 its merits.
 Under this formula, Sturgis Independent
 School District No. 12 qualified for $27,000 of
 the $72,000 allocated under the act to Meade
 County.  The Government, based on the last
 census, estimates there are 335 "educationally
 deprived" children in Meade County.  The
 Sturgis district is using most of its alloca-
 tion for the new kindergarten project.                                                                               It
 plans to use the remainder on summer re-
 medial projects.  Now, of course, the kinder-

 HON. DAVID S. KING
 OF UTAH
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. KING of Utah. Mr. Speaker, the
 voices of protest within  our  country
 against the American position in Viet-
 nam have been sobered and silenced, to
 a large degree, by the ominous Commu-
 nist rebuff to President Johnson's peace
 overtures.
 Those voices which earlier were lam-
 basting the administration for what they
 felt was its passive pursuit of peace
 should now, in all fairness, be blasting

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MILWARD L. SIMPSON
 OF WYOMING
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, February 3, 1966
 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, Sena-
 tor Hucx SCOTT, of Pennsylvania, gave
 the sermon at St. John's Church-Epis-
 copal-in Georgetown at the Annual
 Church and Government Sunday.  He
 spoke with eloquence and deep feeling
 of need for people in today's world to
 better understand their God.  So that
 more people will have an opportunity to
 read these important remarks I ask
 unanimous consent that they be printed
 in the Appendix of the )RECORD.
 There being no objection, the sermon
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 ADDRESS BY U.S. SENATOR HUGH SCOTT, AN-
 NUAL  CHURCH AND  GOVERNMENT  SUNDAY,
 JANUARY 9, 1966, AT THE ST. JOHN'S CHURCH
 (EPISCOPAL),   GEORGETOWN, WASHINGTON,
 D.C.
 "What is man, that Thou art mindful of
 him?" Psalms 8, verse 4. "Thou makest him
 to -have  dominion  of  the  works  of  Thy
 hands."   Verse 6.
 Confronted by the incredible advances of
 the modern world, has the inner nature of
 man been affected, and if so, in what way?
 The discoveries within a single century have
 surely altered the course of man's progress
 more than the sum total of all the term of
 man's prior existence on this earth.
 What of man against the machine?  How
 has he fared?  The machine drastically alters
 the course of man, speeds up his timetable a
 hundredfold, even a thousandfold _and, in
 space opens a new dimension to be conquered.
 What of the effect upon man's relationship to
 God?
 Automation may be defined as the substi-
 tution by machines for the physical strength
 of man.  Cybernetics may be described as the
 substitution by machines for the mental op-
 erations of man.
 Some of you may have read recently the
 somewhat irreverent story told by techni-
 cians about computers.  The story goes that
 a huge computer was fed this question: "Is
 there a God?" The computer whirred, buzzed
 and finally read out: "Now there is."
 Well, the most deeply thoughtful explorers
 of the nature of the universe find, of course,
 that the more they learn, the more there is to
 learn.  The deeper they probe, the more likely
 they are to find that the acceptance of God,
 the Creator, is essential to the verity of their
 theorizing.
 Einstein caused the world to know the
 meaning of E equals MC2, but behind this
 equation  of  destruction,  beyond  the  dis-
 covery of a key to unleash the powers of the
 earth and the air, lies the creative, all-know-
 ing force which is God.
 Men     have  believed   (as   the  ancients
 thought) that Heaven is upon some moun-
 tain top, or beyond the sky or at the far-
 thest                 reaches  of the stars.  Though  men
 have dispatched their minds to search in     tial, to use modern terms, of these two
 the far places, the longest journey cannot   thoughts which Goethe has left with us:
 but bring one back to the simplest truth:     "Nothing is more terrible than ignorance
 that God is surely to be found within each   in action," and
 human hea
 t
 r
 .
 Let us return to man and the machine:
 servant or master?  It is true that automa-
 tion  and                                                                            cybernetics  bring  with  them
 deprivations and dislocations. They may,
 and do, reduce employment,  especially In
 the areas of their original impact. In time,
 more employment is created, more leisure is
 made possible for  the  employee. Leisure,
 wisely used, can open new worlds, hereto-
 fore unsavored.
 Automation, the machine, is not superior
 to man.  It does not supplant man in the
 scheme of nature any more than the secular
 church  can,  in  this aspect,  supplant the
 spiritual church.  The good works of auto-
 mation may serve to free the individual to
 provide more time to adjust more agreeably
 to a widened vista, perhaps even to give
 more thought to his meaning as man.     The
 good  works  of  the  secular church  brin
 g
 religion into involvement with the problems
 of modern living.  As we have just read in
 Psalm 72: "He shall defend the children of
 the  poor."  The  spiritual  commitment  of
 the church impels it still to minister to the
 souls of men.
 A more automated community need never
 be a less spiritual community, as is well ex-
 emplified in the computerized atomic energy
 communities in New Mexico and Tennessee.
 For it is eternally true that there is no ma-
 chine to replace those inner fires of inspira-
 tion, to create the indispensable ideas which
 only men can feed to the machines.
 No cybernetic formulas to simplify with
 computers the intricate problems of men in
 space can ever put men in orbit until after
 other human beings have conceived within
 themselves, and then pursued, the challenges
 offered by the unexplored.
 However  much  the  Sunday supplement
 "That which. we have inherited from our
 forefathers, we must earn again, in order to
 deserve."
 So,  imperishable  ideas  are  flung,  like
 torches, to be retrieved and carried aloft by
 others, from day to uncountable day.
 How wise are they who know that these
 things they have done are not of their own
 human doing.  There is the cry of one who
 made possible our now commonplace tele-
 phone, when he viewed its success: "What
 hath God wrought."
 No one will claim that any electronic device
 has ever been sparked by the touch of God's
 hand.  But every single thing which goes
 into that complicated engineering marvel has
 been conceived by men who, without in-
 spiration,  which is the heritage of God's
 challenge to man, would have been as power-
 less to start themselves as are the machines.,
 In all of our "still achieving, still pursu-
 ing," amidst the tumult of this modern busy
 world, let us never forget that there is a
 voice to be heard, a voice which is not our
 voice, yet mindful of us, informing us all,
 commanding us all:
 "Be still-and know that lam God."

 Health and food services: Medical exami-
 nations, dental checkups; eyeglasses for chil-
 dren who can't afford them, nursing serv-
 ices, school breakfasts, and lunches to sup-
 plement inadequate diets.
 Guidance and counseling services:  Em-
 ployment of guidance counselors, psychome-
 trists, psychologists or psychiatrists (often
 part-time or on a shared basis with neigh-
 boring  school  districts),  social                 workers,
 home-school visitors; extension of guidance
 and counseling services to the junior high,
 or even elementary, level.
 Teacher in-service training: Seminars on
 teaching  disadvantaged  children, under-
 standing their culture, dealing with their
 parents; observation of master teachers or
 remedial specialists in the laboratory situa-
 tion; workshops, conducted by an institu-
 tion of higher learning on Saturdays or dur-
 ing the summer, in connection with a spe-
 cific title I project.
 Recreation:  Perhaps  an activity  of low
 priority, but in a balanced program, It could
 have a place; such activities might consti-
 tute a part of a summer educational camp
 or might be combined with health services
 in areas where physical needs  have been
 neglected.
 Cooperative projects seem particularly de-
 sirable for districts with small entitlements.
 As one school official in the Southwest re-
 marked: "What can we do with $237?"  In
 any such situation, joint ventures are vir-
 tually necessary to achieve a program with
 scope and substance-in short, to get the
 most bang for the buck.  Oklahomas is con-
 sidering the approval of a rebuilt bus ($37,-
 000) that would rotate among a number of
 rural school districts to provide remedial
 reading services.  Similar mobile units could
 be used to provide health, guidance, or li-
 brary services,
 Because of the late date of the appropria-
 tion measure and subsequent delay of proj-
 ect materials, we realize that many school
 districts found it difficult to implement pro-
 grams during the first half of the school
 year.  If, because of existing commitments,
 adequate personnel are not available to staff
 projects for the second term, summer pro-
 grams might be ideal-remedial classes, en-
 richment activities, preschool projects, day
 camps, full-time summer school programs,
 etc.  Schools may wish to combine the ad-
 vantages of an academic program with the
 play aspects of a summer session, gearing
 remedial classes to craft and creative activi-
 ties.
 An enrichment remedial recreation com-
 bination is hard to beat.  In fact, summer
 school programs have the twin advantage of
 using uncommitted resources and providing
 opportunity to plan effective programs that
 have special merit for children who would
 otherwise  lapse  completely  into a  barren
 home environment.
 If a local district does not have sufficient
 resources within the school system, it may
 wish to draw on the resources of outside
 groups-Federal    Extension   Service agents
 and home economists of the Department of
 Agriculture, OEO personnel, church volun-
 teers, women's groups, civic organizations.
 For instance, if a school district needs to
 improve  its  library  program but    cannot
 escure sufficient staff of supplies, it may con-
 tract with the public library system to mobil-
 ize the necessary resources.
 The following projects have been initiated
 by school districts in the past, not neces-
 sarily under title I, and have been high-
 lighted in "Education: An Answer to Pov-
 erty,                School  Programs  for  the  Disadvan-
 taged" (a revision of Educational Research
 Service Circular No. 2), or the December issue
 of School Management.
 A small Midwestern city has made a con-
 centrated effort to encourage parental in-
 terest in an enrichment program for the
 primary grades.  For its kindergarten pro-
 gram it conducted extensive interviews with
 parents to help form an approximate record
 of the experience each child had gleaned from
 his home and neighborhood environment,
 Moreover, a community counseling program
 has been instituted and social workers offer
 to help with problems that might affect a
 child's success in school-budget, nutrition,
 atmosphere for study.
 A Michigan preschool also cultivates pa-
 rental interest.  Teachers make home visits
 every afternoon, ostensibly to report to par-
 ents on a child's progress.  But the visit is
 mostly taken up with engaging the mother;
 the preschool pupil, and other brothers and
 sisters in games and storytelling, thus en-
 couraging the delighted mother to become a
 preschool teacher in her own home.
 In an Ohio city an ingenious, "and extreme-
 ly inexpensive, preschool kit is helping dis-
 advantaged youngsters  and  their  mothers
 get ready for the first grade. Three hundred
 women produced over 3,000 preschool kits at
 a cost of 50 cents per child-plain denim bags
 filled with  15-cent packages of clay, pipe
 cleaners, crayons, paste, pads of paper, shoe-
 laces,  erasers,  storybooks,  coloring  books,
 homemade dolls, beanbags, pencils, paper
 clips, shelf paper and other items.
 In the summer, mothers were invited to
 attend   preschool  demonstration meetings
 where volunteers showed mothers how to
 make a game out of teaching their children
 how to brush their teeth, how to cut the
 tops off an old pair of sneakers, staple them
 to  cardboard  and  teach  children how  to
 play "ties your shoes."  Mothers added items
 to the bags themselves-thread, spoons, zip-
 pers-anything  their                                                                                          child's  imagination
 could pursue.  The same city also instituted
 a   tutor  corps of 1,600  outstanding   high
 school students who coach 4,000 elementary
 students in 60 locations throughout the inner
 city-in libraries, YMCA's, recreation centers,
 churches, settlement houses, and schools.
 A school in Maryland has instituted a pro-
 gram to test newly enrolled first graders for
 reading readiness.   Children without ? ade-
 quate preschool experience are now placed
 in classes of no more than 20 pupils.  Chil-
 dren in one southern school who are behind
 in auditory and language development-and
 who without special help would remain be-
 hind-are given special training in listening
 and speech production by a speech therapist.
 A_ California district designed a summer
 program for migrant children involving field
 trips, medical examinations, films on good
 health  habits,  remedial  instruction,  and
 group work in various subject areas.
 Programed instruction on teaching ma-
 chines-an  ever-increasing                                                                                       practice-has
 been found to be effective with disadvan-
 taged children, perhaps because the pupil is
 doing something to make the machine work
 and the machine rapidly presents him with
 something new to do-in short, he learns
 how to learn.  But no amount of "hardware"
 can replace a competent instructor or a well-
 designed curriculum.
 One Maryland community has established
 evening counseling services in the city library
 for students over 16 years of age who have
 dropped out of school.  Paid community
 service can also be a prime tool for influenc-
 ing dropouts to resume school work.  Some
 localities  have  developed impressive pro-
 grams of combining youth employment with
 resumed schooling, future job training, and
 counseling.    To deter potential dropouts
 from leaving school, a work-study project
 might provide for jobs in hospitals, libraries
 and day-care centersservices that would ac-
 complish the triple purpose of vocational
 training, community betterment, and aca-
 demic incentive.
 An Illinois county has tried to stem drop-
 outs by creating part-time jobs-teacher aids,
 playground  attendants,  office  assistants,
 2001
 library helpers, landscape and laboratory as-
 sistants.
 One after-school study, center is run on
 Saturday mornings by a minister's wife and
 30 volunteers, mostly high school seniors. A
 library is stocked by the pablic library sys-
 tem.                                                                                                                               A similar project could be instituted
 under title I, perhaps in cooperation with
 title II library resources.  Needy high school
 students might be hired as homework help-
 ers..                                                                                                                               For that matter, pilot experiments in
 Michigan and California have indicated a
 noticeable rise in involvement and achieve-
 ment of young. children who were tutored by
 sixth-grade  students-not  to  mention  a
 beneficial change in the achievement and at-
 titude of the tutors themselves.
 As part of  a  $320,000 approved title  I
 project from Texas, $12,000 is being set aside
 for food services and $28,000 for clothing,
 medical and dental help.  The superintend-
 ent remarked that the success of remedial
 activities depends greatly on the effectiveness
 of community-oriented activities.
 One proposed project from Georgia calls
 for a psychologist or psychiatrist to spend
 24 days a year working in the district on a
 consultant basis.  (The nearest psychologist
 is 50 miles away and funds do not permit a
 full-time man.)   In the same area, a quali-
 fied reading consultant would be hired to
 plan a developmental reading program for
 disadvantaged students.  Part of his duties
 would include the development of an inserv-
 ice training course for teachers to stress
 diagnosing reading problems.and employing
 effective classrooms techniques (the district
 can't afford highly trained specialists and has
 hired 13 extra teachers for remedial classes).
 In California, Project TNT (training nat-
 ural talent)  would provide an invigorated
 school program for academically able junior
 high students handicapped by poor primary
 backgrounds. This proposed extension of an
 ongoing project would involve special group-
 ing, intensive counseling, special individual-
 ized projects, 24-hour-a-day access to library
 materials, cultural  activities,  and  special
 summer sessions-all designed to encourage
 college entrance, to win family conildence,
 and, ultimately, to upgrade programs in all
 deprived areas-and all costing $6,000.
 Mentally retarded teenagers have been en-
 couraged to become self-reliant in one Pa-
 cific coast project costing only $10,000.  They
 have been taught some very fundamental,
 but necessary, tasks: how to cash a check,
 pay a bill, mail a package, apply for a job.
 These interpersonal relationships are staged
 in the classroom and then practiced in the
 community.
 In an upstate New York community, adult
 volunteers act as classroom troubleshooters
 to help teachers spot specific student prob-
 lems-at a mere cost of $2,500.
 As part of one great cities project, special
 service schools in economically and educa-
 tionally deprived areas are provided with
 smaller classes than in regular schools, spe-
 cialized programs in reading and mathemat-
 ics, additional teaching personnel for correc-
 tive reading or guidance, and larger-than-
 average allotments for textbooks and sup-
 plies.

 LTtIVATE INITIATIVE AND THE RENT
 3UPPI:,EMENT PROGRAM
 (Mr. MULTER (at the request of Mr.
 ANNUNZIO)   was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 bbicoRD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. MULTER.  Mr. Speaker, in his
 housing message the President cited the
 dramatic and positive response to the
 rent supplement program from private
 groups throughout the country.  In the
 short time since the last session of the
 Congress adjourned, without acting on
 the administration's request for funds
 to implement the program, the Depart-
 ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
 ment has already received preliminary
 proposals  from  sponsors  to  construct
 nearly 70,000 low-income units under the
 rent supplement program as soon as
 funds become available.
 The President reported to us that this
 overwhelming expression of interest in
 the program had come from nearly every
 state in the Union and from 265 locali-
 ties.  He said about half of the requests
 had come from charitable and nonprofit
 groups.
 While this is impressive, it comes as no
 surprise to Inc.  In my own State of New
 York I have been gratified to observe in
 recent years a great upsurge in the num-
 ber of private groups sincerely concerned
 with the plight of slum dwellers and
 deeply committed and dedicated to in-
 tense efforts to help these people improve
 themselves  socially  and  economically
 and, at the same time, to help them bring
 Up to decent standards the houses and
 neighborhoods in which they live.  This
 great outpouring of social concern and
 the desire to take action and to make
 sacrifices in behalf of our less-privileged
 fellow citizens is in the great tradition
 of America.  Just as we, as a nation,
 have demonstrated our desire to help
 the underprivileged in the less-developed
 countries of the world, Americans every-
 where are becoming concerned with the
 underprivileged portion of our own great
 society.  For ironically, we do not have
 to travel halfway around the world to
 discover poverty, deprivation, and hu-
 man despair.  It is to be found in abun-
 dance in the slums of most of our cities
 and towns.
 This concern for our less fortunate
 neighbors is being manifested by minis-
 ters, priests, and rabbis-by fraternal
 organizations, by neighborhood improve-
 ment associations, by nonprofit organi-
 zations supported by civic and business
 leaders, and by a host of other groups of
 high motive and noble purpose.
 Not only in my own State but in every
 part of the country, there is a great and
 swelling movement of private charity;
 spontaneous, informal, intensely local.
 It is a tribute to and a reflection of the
 qualities  which  have  made  America
 great;.
 It is most. reassuring, that these groups
 have responded so quickly to the prom-
 ise of the                                                                   rent supplement   program.
 This program is well designed to assist
 them in carrying out the noble purposes
 of human and neighborhood improve-
 ment to which they are dedicating so
 much of their effort.   In a sense, the
 rent supplement program was made to
 order for their purposes--and they have
 been quick to recognize it..
 The rent  supplement  program will
 make it possible for them to help poor
 people in poor neighborhoods to bring
 their living conditions up to a decent
 standard.  This, combined with the so-
 cial  services  and  human  counseling
 which they are so uniquely equipped to
 provide, represents an Unparalleled op-
 portunity for private groups to el minate
 substandard living conditions, a social
 inalad,justmen.t, lack of opportunity and
 hope--which are the deepest causes of
 the disease which threatens the very
 fabric of our urban society.
 I think we owe it to these many pri-
 vate nonprofit groups to give them. the
 tools they need to accomplish the inspir-
 ing job of social reconstruction they are
 so eager to undertake.  They have made
 it very clear that they Consider the rent
 supplement program one of the tools
 they need the most.

 THE PRESIDENT DECIDES
 (Mr. McGRATH  (at the request of
 Mr. ANNUNZIO) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. McGRATH. Mr. Speaker, on Jan-
 uary 29, the Philadelphia Inquirer car-
 ried a thoroughly interesting editorial
 discussion of the Pre:t,ident's role in
 reaching decisions.
 Beyond this theme, the Inquirer also
 demonstrated great clarity of foresight
 and accuracy of predictability.
 On that day-2 days before President
 Johnson announced our resumption of
 bombing in North Vietnam-the In-
 quirer declared:
 President Johnson has sought and obtained
 expert counsel on every facet of the issues
 facing him in Vietnam.  Be has analyzed the
 results of the bombing lull and his peace
 offensive.  When he is as sure as any human
 being can be that what ho intends to do is
 the best interests of our country-he will do
 it.  And, when he does, he deserves. and we
 are sure that he will receive, the whole-
 hearted support of the overwhelming ma-
 jority of the American people.
 Since the appearance of that editorial,
 the Communists of Hanoi and Peiping
 have been shown in no uncertain terms
 that we do not intend to lessen our re-
 sistance to the beleaguered people of
 South Vietnam.  We do not intend to
 pull back from our commitment to the
 cause of freedom in that troubled. place.
 And I believe that the Inquirer was
 absolutely correct in its prediction that
 the President will have the support of
 the great majority of our people.
 So that my colleagues may have the
 opportunity to read this frank editorial,
 I am submitting it for printing in the
 RECORD at this point:
 THE PRESIDENT DECIDES
 "The buck," read a sign on President Tru-
 man's desk in the White House, "stops here."
 When the chips are down, when the final
 judgment                                               has  to  be  made-whether  the
 issue  is freedom for the slaves, the mis-
 sile confrontation with Soviet Russia in Cuba,
 or the resumption of bombing in. North Viet-
 nam-it is the President who has the decisive
 word.
 The loneliness and the agonizing respon-
 sibility that go with his office must have
 been brought home to the present occu-
 pant of the White House to an excruciating
 degree as he has wrestled with the problems
 wrapped up In the bombing of North Viet-
 nam.
 Whatever conclusion is reached, the re-
 sponsibility will rest on Lyndon B.. John-
 son-and not on a single one of the indi-
 viduals who have been pressuring him, harn-
 mering at him., and pulling and pushing him
 in every direction since the bombing pause
 began on Christmas Eve.
 Very few of these self-appointed advisers
 have more than second- or third-hand knowl-
 edge of the issues.   Most of them merely
 parrot what someone else has said, on the
 frailest authority.   Yet they all but push
 intimidating fingers into the President's face
 to urge him to give up the bombing in-
 definitely, to pulverize Hanoi, or to adopt
 some other strategy.
 It Is easy to be a Monday morning quarter-
 back, when you're not held responsible for
 mistakes.   It  is easy for Congressmen  to
 pose as cloakroom Napoleons, when they can
 shift as the winds blow-belligerent yester-
 day, pacifist tomorrow, and comatose in be-
 tween.
 Some of those who have been pressuring
 the President the most are outright appeasers
 who want the United States to run out of
 Vietnam at once, and who will never be
 satisfied with anything less.
 President Johnson  has  sought  and  ob-
 tained expert counsel on every facet of the
 issues facing :him in Vietnam. He has ana-
 lyzed the results of the bombing lull and
 his peace offensive. When he is as sure as
 any human being can be that what he in-
 tends to do is in the best interests of our
 country-he will do it.  And, when he does,
 he deserves, and we are sure that he will
 receive,  the wholehearted  support  of  the

 The most recent abuse of its activities
 occured last May in Chicago. The com-
 mittee, according to its chairman, was
 seeking factual information upon the
 activities  of  the  Communist  Party.
 What information was received still re-
 mains a mystery, but to me it appears
 that this was a propaganda excursion,
 one which could again take on the aspect
 of destroying the reputation and lives of
 American citizens by publicly accusing
 them of associations with elements which
 the committee considers undesirable.
 This year's request for funds is the
 largest that the committee has requested
 and the largest of any committee of the
 House. I protest this authorization and
 if illness had not confined me to my

 money's worth. Its record of legislative
 accomplishment is so small that its posi-
 tive actions could be enumerated on
 about one-half page of a regular letter-
 head.  The principal activities, it appears
 to me, is not aimed toward legislation but
 rather in the investigating and exposing
 individuals and organizations as anti-
 American or un-American.   An  ap-
 pearance before this committee brands
 one as being against the United States.
 I shall, as long as I remain in Congress,
 refrain from authorizing any funds to

 Mr. GILLIGAN. Mr. Speaker, I have
 Introduced today a bill to untangle the
 time mess that annually hits the Nation
 during the summer months.
 It is entitled the "Uniform Time Act of
 1966." States or political subdivisions of
 States and the District of Columbia, that
 adopt daylight savings time must do so
 during a specified period under provi-
 sions of the bill.  The period begins on
 the last Sunday in April and ends the
 last Sunday in October.
 The purpose of the bill is to straighten
 with one uniform law the tangle of dif-
 ferent State laws on daylight savings
 time.
 Because of the tangle, businessmen are
 frustrated in daily transactions, travelers
 are confused, and millions of dollars are
 lost needlessly.
 My  colleague,  the gentleman from
 Tennessee, the Honorable RICHARD H.
 FULTON, in testifying before the House
 Committee on Interstate and Foreign
 Commerce, recently asserted that the
 time mess costs the Nation's motorbus
 operators $250,000 to reprint schedules;
 the railroads an estimated $1 million for
 reprinting schedules;  and broadcasters
 $1.6 million to tape shows.
 The amount lost to businessmen just
 trying to negotiate intrastate with one
 another amidst this time crazy quilt
 surely runs into the millions.
 My bill also has an enforcement provi-
 sion.              It provides that the Interstate
 Commerce Commission may apply to the
 district court of the United States where
 such violation occurs and seek court in-
 junction  or  other process  to  enforce
 obedience to the act.
 't'he present hodgepodge of State laws
 have given the United States the un-
 happy title of "world's worst time keep-
 er."              The country would lose the title
 under the Uniform Time Act of 1966.
 I recommend the bill for your consid-
 eration and approval.

 Mr. PATTEN.      Mr. Speaker, I think
 it is of tremendous significance that for-

 curred completely in President Johnson's
 decision to resume bombing in North
 Vietnam.
 The general's statement is a clear
 indication of the unity which the coun-
 try is giving the President in his de-
 termination to give our fighting men in
 Vietnam every support they need.
 On this issue there niust be no north
 or south, no east or west. On this issue
 the country can agree and does agree.
 We expect much from our soldiers.
 We are proud of them.  'We call them
 the finest men in all the world--brave
 and courageous in every sense of the
 word.  The cream of the crop is over

 from them, they expect a lot from us.

 CONFLICT
 (By Felix ]3elair)
 WASHINGTON, January 3:1.--Former :Presi-
 dent Dwight D. Eisenhower said today that
 President   Johnson   "unquestionably has
 made the correct decision"  in ordering a
 resumption of bombing in North Vietnam.
 To have done otherwise, Genera. Eisen-
 He  had  no  sympathy  at  all,  General
 Eisenhower said, with some Members of the
 Senate and others who maintained that a
 bombing resumption in the north would be
 escalating the war and playing at brink-
 manship with a nuclear world war III.
 He contended that it was Hanoi, working
 through the National Liberation Front of
 South Vietnam, the political affiliate of the
 Vietcong, that had done the escalating.  In
 addition to a completely negative response
 to President Johnson's peace overtures, he
 said, North Vietnam's Communist regime had
 used the period of suspended bombing to
 strengthen their forces  in  the south  and
 send more equipment.
 The Vietcong forces had expanded their
 attacks on U.S. military installations and
 barracks  while  continuing  their  bombing
 of nonmilitary civilian targets such as buses
 and other public facilities, the former Presi-
 dent said.
 All  this  required  that American   forces
 react, and the bombing of North Vietnamese
 targets was part of that reaction, he said.
 He added that "in the circumstances there
 was nothing the President could do but order
 a resumption of the bombing."
 General Eisenhower's voice was strong and
 he was at no loss for words to express his
 views on the President's decision.    He said
 he was feeling fine again and today had
 played 9 holes of golf.
 Although General Eisenhower did not say
 so,  his  views  on  any  U.S.  military  in-
 volvement                                                                                                                                            always  are  considered  by  the
 Joint Chiefs  of   Staff  and  are sometimes
 solicited by President Johnson.
 Without going into the question of limited
 warfare as opposed to an expansion of hos-
 tilities in Vietnam, General Eisenhower re-
 jected the recent proposal by Lt. Gen. James
 M. Gavin (retired) that the U.S. forces with-
 draw into several costal enclaves in South
 Vietnam so as to limit the war while pursuing
 peace efforts.
 The general raised the question of what
 the Vietcong would be doing throughout the
 rest of South Vietnam while U.S. forces sat
 securely in their enclaves.
 Answering his own question, he said that
 as in the case of an indefinite suspension of
 bombings, such a course would only postpone
 an inevitable decision to meet force with
 force.

 On this list are some of the largest and most
 successful companies in the United States.
 A new advantage to advertising has been
 recently revealed, and since it affects a cor-
 poration which is considering becoming part
 of Lorain, the facts are worth noting.
 United  Artists  was  an  advertiser  who
 placed a full page ad in the 1964 Democratic
 National Convention program.  The cost of
 this ad was $15,000. The some corporation
 also took a full page ad in the Democrats'
 advertising book "Toward an Age of Great-
 ness" published in December 1965.  Again
 the cost was $15,000. Both of these ads ap-
 peared in spite of the fact that Federal law
 makes it a crime for either corporations or
 labor unions to make contributions or ex-
 penditures "in connection with any election
 to any political office, or in. connection with
 any primary election or political convention
 or caucus held to select candidates for any
 political office."   (Title 18, sec. 610.)
 Could this advertising have  resulted in
 the fact that on January 6, 1966, a hearing
 examiner from the Federal Communications
 Commission recommended that United Art-
 ists Broadcasting, Inc., be awarded a con-
 struction permit for a new television broad-
 cast station supposedly assigned to Lorain,

 The SPEAKEo tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Illinois [Mr. PUCINSxr] is
 recognized for 30 minutes.
 (Mr. PUCINSKI asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr.  PUCINSKI.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 events of the last 24 hours would indicate
 that there is a flicker of hope today that
 the President will succeed in chartering
 a course which could bring the conflict in
 Vietnam to the negotating table.  I say
 advisedly and stress that it is only a
 flicker, only a thin sliver of hope but I am
 sure that to the millions of parents in
 this country, fathers and mothers whose
 youngsters are of draft age; to the tens of
 thousands of parents in this country
 whose boys are now in the service and
 who are actually serving in Vietnam, and
 to the millions of young men who are
 most directly involved in these events,
 even such a flicker can be a source of
 cautious comfort.
 The inspiring victory scored yesterday
 by our Ambasador to the United Nations,
 Ambassador Arthur Goldberg, in bring-
 ing before the United Nations Security
 Council a full-scale discussion of the
 Vietnam conflict is the basis for this
 flicker of hope.
 Following closely behind Ambassador
 Goldberg's success of yesterday, is the
 statement made today by the South
 Vietnam Ambassador, Vu Van Thai, who,
 according to the Associated Press, said
 that his government believes the Viet-
 nam war could be halted on the basis
 of the 1954 Geneva Agreement.  The
 Associated Press dispatch states that he
 made a comment after a 1 hour and 10
 minute meeting with U.S. Secretary of
 State. Dean Rusk.  Thai said he had
 made a "complete tour of all the prob-
 lems facing us at this stage.  There is
 an identity of views both in standing
 against aggression and in the sincere de-
 sire of both of our governments to con-
 tinue the search for peace."
 The Ambassador said the Saigon Gov-
 ernment had been consulted and was in
 full agreement with the United States
 before President Johnson's move in tak-
 ing the peace bid to the United Nations
 Security Council.
 Asked about the reconvening of the
 1954 Geneva Conference, which would
 include Communist China, North Viet-
 nam, and the Soviet Union, as well as
 Britain, France, and the United States,
 Thai said:
 Our Government has made clear that while
 we were not a signatory to the Geneva
 agreement, we feel that the war could be
 stopped on the basis of the Geneva agree-
 ment.
 The main violation of that agreement has
 been due to the aggression from the north.
 Our Government has reiterated the princi-
 ple of the right of the Vietnamese to choose
 their  own  institutions  through  free  and
 democratic elections.
 But he said that this could not be
 carried out until the aggression has been
 stopped.
 I think the fact that nine nations
 voted with us yesterday at the United
 Nations to bring this whole Vietnam
 conflict before the Security Council is a
 great source of hope.
 We can all recall that by using this
 United Nations international forum in
 1962, and exposing for the whole world
 to see the full details of the Communist
 conspiracy in Cuba, President Kennedy
 was able to marshal world support and
 indignation against the Soviet Union for
 placing missiles in Cuba.  It was this
 world indignation that helped avoid a
 major confrontation when the Soviets
 withdrew. While I am mindful of those
 who criticized the shortcomings of the
 United Nations-and, on occasion, I, too,
 have been impatient with it-it appears
 to me that the record is clear that the
 United Nations can become an instru-
 ment for resolving disputes which could
 lead to major world conflict.
 The United Nations did p3ay a vital
 role in 1962.  But let us not forget also
 that as a corollary to using the United
 Nations as a forum to bring before the
 world all of the facts on Cuba, we had a
 President then, as we have a President
 now, not afraid to stand up to aggression
 during the discussions.
 I firmly believe the wisdom of Presi-
 dent Johnson's decision to renew bomb-
 ing of North Vietnam is beginning to
 demonstrate to the world the sincerity
 of our purpose as Americans in defend-
 ing South Vietnam during the agonizing
 period while we search for other meth-
 ods to end the war.
 We want peace above  everything.
 That is a matter of indisputable record.
 We have exerted and exhausted every
 single one of our resources in the search
 for that peace.  But, at the same time,
 we are not going to .let our allies down.
 We are not going to see South Vietnam
 abandoned because we know that to
 abandon South Vietnam today would
 merely whet the appetites of those who
 would conquer freedom throughout the
 world.
 I warned 2 weeks ago of the Tri-Con-
 tinental  Communist Congress held  in
 Cuba during the first 2 weeks of Janu-
 ary.  For those people who cannot un-
 derstand why Mr. Johnson has to follow
 this parallel track-on the one hand,
 using whatever resources are at our dis-
 posal to bomb military installations in
 Vietnam; and then, on the other hand,
 looking for peace in the United Nations-
 let them just read the record of that Tri-
 Continental Congress and let them un-
 derstand that the Communists have de-
 vised a new technique of warfare.
 Our Nation, by building up the huge
 war machine that we have, has made
 major war too expensive.  I think it is
 safe to presume that there will be no
 major exchange of nuclear devices be-
 tween the major powers because all par-
 ties concerned realize what a costly ap-
 proach that would be.
 And so the Communists have now de-
 vised a new technique of conquest by sub-
 version, conquest by terrorism, and the
 testing ground for this new technique
 is South Vietnam.
 The Tri-Continental Congress clearly
 went on record to repeat this subversion
 and terrorism to seize nation after na-
 tion on the continents of Africa, Asia and
 Latin America.  It is important for those
 who urge we abandon Vietnam to know
 that much more than just a piece of real
 estate in Vietnam is involved in this war.
 For this country today to walk away
 from South Vietnam without resolving
 that problem and without guaranteeing
 for those people the rigt to self-deter-
 mination would be to give the green light
 to Communist leaders on three conti-
 nents, who brazenly and boldly spelled
 out their plans in Havana for 15 days in
 the first 2 weeks of January.  They told
 us openly how they plan to carry on the
 same kind of subversion and terrorism
 throughout the whole of Asia, throughout
 the whole of Africa, and throughout the
 whole of South America.  This is the
 new  technique  of  the  International
 Comintern, which is being reestablished
 throughout the world.
 And so, for all of those well-meaning
 Americans who would say that we ought
 to leave Vietnam, that they do not like
 Vietnam, I submit and suggest that they
 look at the record of Havana during the
 first 2 weeks of January.
 I submit that the President is follow-
 ing the course that is the only course
 for Americans to follow.
 I submit that there is a reason why
 Hanoi and Peiping, and, yes, even Mos-
 cow, do not want to see this conflict re-
 solved. It is becoming crystal clear that
 Hanoi and Peiping and Moscow would
 just as soon have this conflict continued
 in South Vietnam, because they feel
 that they have all of our attention
 centered there, all of our energies directed
 there, while ? in the meantime, they are
 free .to roans all over the world and en-
 gage in their subversion.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --HOUSE          February    1966
 To those who cannot understand the
 global aspect of the Vietnam conflict, let
 ure remind them that in this last year,
 lit governments of the African Continent
 have gone down and have been wiped out
 through subversion  and conflict, very
 much along the same lines that we now
 ace in Vietnam.
 I ,;a.y that President Johnson's policy
 in Vietnam---carrying the olive branch
 of peace in one hand and the arrows
 of defense in the other, is the only policy.
 11, is a policy aimed at preventing world
 war ]-It.
 I am pr;;ud that the overwhelming
 majority of American people who are
 deepiy concerned about Vietnam, who
 want an honorable victory in Vietnam,
 have shown it maturity never before
 demonstrated in America in saying to
 the President:  "Mr. President, we are
 with you.  We trust your judgment.  We
 trust freedom's future in your hands. We
 trust our survival to your guidance."
 God grant that we could have had
 this kind of understanding in 1935 and
 1936 and 1937, when another great Presi-
 dent stood in Chicago at the Outer Drive
 Bridge and called for a quarantine of the
 first aggressors of that era.  He warned
 in those days that if we did not stop a.g-
 Fression at ghat point, it would spread
 into a major conflict.  And he was a
 prophet to be dealt with, because indeed
 the world sat back, and we saw the dev-
 astation that followed in World War II.
 I say to those who urge a policy of
 withdrawal before the battle is ended
 that they fail to look at history.
 ]:fight here on Pennsylvania Avenue,
 clown the street from the Capitol, in
 front of the National Archives Building,
 there  are  two  inscriptions: One  says
 "What Is Past Is Prolog," and the other
 says "Study the Past."    Now, if anybody
 still wonders what we are doing in Viet-
 nam, let them just study the past and
 they will ser what we are doing in Viet-
 riatn.  We are defending freedom and
 stopping aggression before it gets out of
 hand.
 We have said we will not be fooled
 a!;ain. So we are trying to move for-
 ward on two courses, one at the peace
 table. while the other contains aggres-
 sion.
 I am confident that the breakthrough
 Ambassador  Goldberg  scored  in  the
 United  Nations yesterday in winning
 support for the President's request that
 the Vietnam question be brought to the
 United Nations Security Council, is the
 lrst  major breakthrough.  Oh, I am
 mindful of the veto and I a.nr mindful of
 all the other things the Communists can
 Flo to block us at the U.N.  I know that
 there will be a long, hard road to fol-
 low at the United Nations before we can
 oven hope to bring this thing to an hon-
 orable conclusion and solution, but at
 least we are moving forward.
 As we look back in history again and
 as we look at the role that the United
 Nations has played in Cuba and in the
 Congo and in the Gaza strip and as we
 '-,D down the line and see the record of
 the United Nations, we Americans today
 can look at this little flicker of hope and
 :see that maybe by the grace of God, we
 can get out of Vietnam with honor and
 still preserve the dignity and freedom of
 those people we have vowed to protect.
 Mr. KING of Utah.  Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Yes. I yield to the
 gentleman from Utah.
 Mr. KING of Utah.  Mr. Speaker, I
 should like to say that I have thrilled
 at the words of the distinguished gentle-
 man from Illinois.                                                                 I agree with him, 100
 percent.  It was my privilege to be in
 South Vietnam for a period of a week
 about 2 months ago..  I was there the
 day of the bombing of the Metropol Hotel
 in Saigon.   I was the first American
 civilian to reach the site of that bombing.
 I remember the sickening feeling which
 came over me as I contemplated the
 havoc, the carnage, the desolation caused
 by that explosion in which some 133 per-
 sons were seriously injured and 8 were
 killed.  I realized then that the tactics
 of the Vietcong were absolutely devoid
 of morality.  I realized[ that they were
 desperate and fanatical in the pursuit
 of their objectives.  I came aw r.v from
 that country more determined than ever
 to stand firm to resist this kind of ter-
 rorisrn.                                                              I was told, for example, that
 during 1965 the Vietcong averaged about
 850 acts of terrorism every single week
 for an entire year's period.  The amount
 of terrorisms has actually gone u`r rather
 than down in the last 2: or 3 months.  I
 felt then and I feel now--and I believe
 most of the American people feel strong-
 ly-that this type of conduct cannot be
 tolerated.  It violates all of the rules of
 decency and of acceptable conduct, yes,
 even for warfare.
 I heartily approve of the cours,~ of our
 Nation in standing firm.  I commend the
 distinguished  gentleman  for  what he
 said.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr- Speaker, I thank
 the gentleman from Utah for his con-
 tribution. I would certainly like to asso-
 ciate myself with his remarks.  This is
 the thing we have been trying to explain
 to the American people.  We are fighting
 a war in Vietnam unlike anything that
 civilization has ever fought before.  In
 the classical sense of warfare, there were
 armies with uniforms and tanks and
 there was some code of ethics toward
 soldiers including a code of exchanging
 prisoners of war which has been set up
 over the years. Going back through the
 whole history of civilization, man's in-
 humanity toward his fellow man had
 some sort of standards at least for the
 military personnel.  However, what we
 are fighting in Vietnam today is a com-
 pletely new concept of Communist war-
 fare which can strike in. any country or
 in. any section of the world.  You are
 fighting men that you cannot identify as
 the enemy, men who work the fields dur-
 ing the day and in the evening, w: ith the
 very same clothes on, but heavily armed
 by Hanoi and Peiping, go out and :ornmit
 acts of violence, terrorism, and subver-
 sion.  These are terrorists who have not
 stopped at murdering, executing 60,000
 of South Vietnamese city, villar;e, and
 municipal officials.  They have destroyed
 entire local governments.  They are tak-
 ing mayors and city councilmen and
 police chiefs and all others responsible
 for orderly government and putting them
 up against the wall and destroying them.
 That is the kind of war we are fighting in
 Vietnam.  For us to walk away from it
 now would be an open invitation for this
 kind of terrorism all over the world, and
 I say, also, here in the United States.
 Vietnam,  Mr.  Speaker, is  the  testing
 ground for an entirely new method of
 terrorism and subversion with which the
 Communists hope to conquer the world
 through so-called "small wars of libera-
 tion."
 Mr. RIVERS of Alaska.  Mr. Speaker,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from Alaska.
 Mr. RIVERS of Alaska.  Mr. Speaker,
 I thank the gentleman for yielding and
 compliment him on his constructive and
 discerning analysis of this situation.  I
 subscribe to what you have said and
 associate myself with your analysis of the
 situation.  I want to be counted among
 those who are standing squarely behind
 the President in handling this most diffi-
 cult situation.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr, Speaker, I thank
 the gentleman very much for his state-
 ment.                                                                                            I yield back the balance of my
 time.
 SUPPORTING   PRESIpENT   3
 SON'S POLICY       VIETNAM
 The SPEAKER pro t~mpora (Mr. Ros-
 TErrKOwsKI)..  Under previous order of
 the House, the gentleman from Califor-
 nia [Mr. HOLM uELDI is recognized. for 15
 minutes.
 Mr. HOLIFIELD.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 supported the President's foreign policy
 in Vietnam since its inception and I sup-
 port it today.
 I believe the principles contained in
 the United Nations Charter comprise the
 basic foundation for mediation and con-
 ciliation between nations.  Two of the
 most important principles are:
 First, condemnation of military ag-
 gression by one nation against another
 as a means of settling a dispute; and
 Second, the right of self-determination
 by the people of any nation in free and
 uncoerced elections.
 In Vietnam we have naked aggression
 by the North Vietnamese hard core mili-
 tary troops and covert infiltrators against
 the people in the Republic of South Viet-
 nam.
 Since 1954-55 we have had a planned
 North Vietnamese four-pronged program
 of infiltration, subversion, terrorism, and
 guerrilla military takeover  of villages
 and areas in South Vietnam.
 Another principle of the United Na-
 tions involves regional agreements be-
 tween nations to come to each other's aid
 at the request of the aggrieved nation.
 These agreements to aid in the event of
 aggression may be either bilateral, as
 between  two  nations,  or multilateral,
 through regional organizations such as
 NATO or SEATO.
 In the instant case of Vietnam, it is
 true we were not signatory to the Geneva
 agreement of 1954, but we did take of-
 ficial note of the agreement and issued

 February 3, 1966         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 is completely contrary to the proposal
 of the President's Maritime Advisory
 Committee that our merchant marine
 fleet be expanded.
 This budget reduction of funds for con-
 struction subsidies to 13 ships for fiscal
 1967 comes at a time when our replace-
 ment program is already more than 90
 vessels behind schedule, and this reduc-
 tion will only compound an already ex-
 isting deficiency in our replacement pro-
 gram.
 A strong merchant fleet is indispen-
 sable to the commerce and security of
 our country and the free world.  Only
 merchant ships can carry the needed
 cargo and can handle the movement of
 supplies and men in time of emergency.
 Our foreign and domestic economy, and
 the importance of balance of payments,
 make expansion of the shipping industry
 under the American flag absolutely nec-
 essary.
 I am at a loss to understand the budg-
 et proposals for 1967 just as I could not
 understand, and strongly opposed, the
 cutbacks in recent years at our Nation's
 shipyards. Shipbuilding and ship repair-
 ing in this country have reached an all-
 time low. The United States has dropped
 to 12th place among the top shipbuild-
 ing nations of the world. Even Poland
 and Yugoslavia rank above us, and Ja-
 pan's shipbuilding triples that of the
 United States.
 In my State of New York we are well
 aware of the consequences of our ship-
 building decline, both public and private.
 Both Bethlehem and Todd have curtailed
 their shipbuilding activities in the New
 York area, and the closing of the Brook-
 lyn Naval Shipyard, which I vigorously
 opposed, has caused unemployment and
 hardship for thousands.  New York is
 the largest port and trade center in the
 world, and yet the 1967 budget allows
 only $1 million for harbor improvement
 projects-an  extremely  low  figure  in
 comparison to the needs and the impor-
 tance of the port of New York.
 Mr. Speaker, shipbuilding in our own
 shipyards should expand and increase,
 providing employment and preserving
 the needs of our American merchant
 fleet. I am opposed, as is the chairman
 of my Merchant Marine Committee, to
 any plan for the foreign construction of
 ships for subsidized operations under the
 U.S. flag.  Building abroad would fur-
 ther debilitate our shipyards and thus
 weaken our ability to meet unusual de-
 mands on our fleet. We must expand our
 merchant fleet through construction in
 U.S. shipyards, and we should preserve
 and maintain our repository of trained
 manpower in our shipyard facilities.  It
 does not make sense to propose a "build-
 ing abroad" program and cut back at
 for our merchant seamen and our ship-
 builders.  We have slipped to the point
 where we have a mere handful of only
 900 ocean-going vessels.  The budget
 figure for 1967 for 13 merchant ships is
 but a drop in the bucket compared to
 Soviet Russia's over 400 merchant vessels
 under construction or on order.
 Between 1954 and 1960 the U.S. mer-
 chant marine fleet decreased 310,000 tons
 a year while the Soviet Union fleet in-
 creased 450,000 tons annually.  And in
 1961-1962 and 1963 we dropped 400,000
 tons annually. The Soviet Union is mov-
 ing toward control of the oceans and
 trade routes, and in the current Vietnam
 situation; we have to turn to foreign-
 flag ships for commercial commitments
 and to carry military cargoes as well.
 The percentage of our foreign commerce
 which is moving on American-flag ships
 is now less than 10 percent.  We must
 check this steady decline.  Our success
 in Vietnam depends on our ability to
 transport men and materials. We should
 not have to depend on others to carry
 our foreign commerce.
 A significant increase in construction
 subsidies for our merchant fleet, which I
 strongly urge, would produce a more effi-
 cient and modern fleet.  This, in time
 and in turn, would reduce the amount of
 operating subsidy needed. We must rec-
 ognize the fact that our higher American
 standard of living makes it highly un-
 likely that we would ever be able to elimi-
 nate these subsidies.
 I am also concerned, Mr. Speaker,
 about the failure on numerous occasions
 of our Government to carry out the
 policy of cargo preference of Public Law
 664, enacted by the Congress in 1954,
 which provided that at least 50 percent
 of U.S.  Government-generated cargo
 should be carried in American-flag ves-
 sels, if such vessels are available at fair
 and reasonable rates.   Congressional
 supervision and action have made some
 improvements in this situation, but there
 are still many instances where the cargo
 preference requirement is not being met.
 Mr. Speaker, we must have a strong
 U.S.-flag  merchant marine,  American
 built and manned, adequate to meet
 peacetime as well as wartime needs. Be-
 cause I am deeply concerned about the
 present plight of our merchant fleet, I
 call this matter to the attention of the
 Congress.
 I am pleased that my Merchant Ma-
 rine Committee, under the able chair-
 manship of the gentleman from Mary-
 land, Congressman EDWARD A. GARMATZ,
 will soon hold hearings on the present
 condition and future plans for the Amer-
 ican merchant marine. I have urged the
 following action: First, a study of the
 actual readiness and capabilities of our
 merchant marine; second, that the 1967
 tended that the United States have an  budget figures be sufficient to meet the

 NATIONAL CHILDREN'S DENTAL
 HEALTH WEEK
 (Mr. SAYLOR asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr.  SAYLOR.  Mr.  Speaker,  once
 again it is my pleasure to direct my col-
 leagues' attention to National Children's
 Dental Health Week.  This event will be
 celebrated during the week of February
 6 and, as is traditional, special programs
 of varying types will be held in commu-
 nities across the Nation.  National Chil-
 dren's Dental Health Week is the one
 time of the year when the Nation's den-
 tists make a concerted effort to call at-
 tention to the importance of oral health
 and to the simple procedures that can be
 followed in the home that, when coupled
 with visits to the family dentist and
 school dental health education pro-
 grams, help insure a healthier citizenry.
 National  Children's Dental  Health
 Week takes on this year a special sig-
 nificance because of another event that
 will be taking place this month. On
 February 27, the American Dental As-
 sociation will be dedicating its new head-
 quarters building in Chicago.  The new
 23-story building will house not only the
 association but also a number of special
 groups within the fields of dental re-
 search, education, and care.  It is in-
 tended to be, and I am sure will soon be-
 come, the national and international
 headquarters of dentistry.
 The traditional celebration of Na-
 tional Children's Dental Health Week
 symbolizes the remarkable strides taken
 by dentistry over the past 20 years and
 which has brought it to a new level of
 maturity   and   accomplishment.  The
 American public of today understands
 more clearly than ever before that there
 is an intimate relationship between oral
 health and general health.  It under-
 stands that the achievement of higher
 national standards of oral health de-
 pends not merely on the practicing den-
 tist, the dental educator or the dental
 research scientist, but on the individ-
 ual citizen and parent as well.  Oral dis-
 ease is not dramatic, but it is insidious.
 Tooth decay remains the most common
 disease we know with periodontal or gum
 disease continuing to be a most serious
 affliction among our adult population.
 Oral cancer continues to show a fright-
 eningly high mortality rate, a rate worse
 that most forms of cancer.
 Much then remains to be done.  But
 the continuing improvement in public
 understanding coupled with the clear in-
 dications that the dental profession con-
 tinues to move forward rapidly makes
 this a time of greater promise for the
 Nation's dental health than ever before

 1.939?'"``'                  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE         February 3, 1966
 Mr. CALLAWAY.  Mr. Speaker, re-
 cently I have brought to the attention
 of the House the efforts of courageous
 Americans in support of their country,
 and particularly in support of our fight
 for freedom in Vietnam.  I tell these
 stories, Mr. Speaker, because I fear that
 in the outburst of public attention to the
 anti-American demonstrations, these ef-
 forts might go unnoticed.
 Today I have asked consent to insert
 in the RECORD the "Statement of the
 American Student Position on Vietnam
 and Communism," which came to me
 from the Young Americans for Freedom
 at Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., and
 which bore the signature of 600 students
 and professors.  They, like all Americans,
 are proud to make known their support
 of the brave people of South Vietnam,
 and of the brave men that we have sent
 to fight with them.
 The  statement  referred  to  is  as
 follows:
 STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN STUDENT POSH
 'NON ON  VIETNAM AND COMMUNISM
 We young Americans-students and citi-?
 zens-solemnly and in all sincerity declare:
 That, since it Is contrary to our American
 traditions that an unrepresentative and rad-?
 ical leftist minority be permitted, without
 dispute, to speak through our communica-
 tions media as if representative of students
 as it whole, we feel it our duty as a respon-?
 aible majority to express what we consider
 the  firm  convictions  of  the  majority  of
 students on the following vital issues con--
 ron-ing our Nation today:
 I. We believe that it is the sovereign right
 of  any  people  to  determine   by  free and..
 Honorable means the form of government
 under which they wish to live.
 2. We believe that the people of Vietnam,
 having so chosen, and having requested the
 ;aid of the United States of America to re-?
 list a tyrannical aggressor, should be giver.;
 all possible aid by the U.S. forces to bring
 this conflict to a victorious conclusion for
 the forces of freedom.
 3. We believe that our forces overseas in
 Vietnam and  wherever similar Communist
 aggressions  have  occurred and may occur
 should be given our fullest support psycho.
 logically, morally,                        and  militarily.
 4. We believe that commonsense and prat-.
 t.icality dictate that violent Communist ag-
 gression is            best faced  and  overcome  now
 nn.   foreign  soil  and that the American
 soldier in Vietnam and elsewhere abroad is

 According to the Bureau of La, bor Sta-
 tistics, in the 5 years. from December
 1961 through December 1965, the cost
 of tomatoes is up 50 percent, center-cut
 pork chops are up 23 percent.  Potatoes
 rose 21 percent, coffee increased 15 per-
 cent, and grade A egg,; are up 10 per-
 cent.  All of this is on a national aver-
 age.                                                               In many cities the increases are
 much higher.
 The same sort of thing is true of
 nearly every item that enters the cost-
 of-living index prepared by the Depart-
 ment of Labor, HEW, and other agencies.
 If you do not believe the spiraling cost
 figures, just ask your wife.  The spiral
 is moving upward at increasing speed.
 She can give you a day-by-day count
 on swift-rising costs.
 HIGHER COST OF LIVING
 (Mr. BRAY (at the request of Mr.
 I'Hnl.l.)   was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD    and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. BRAY. Mr. Speaker, admininis-
 tration spokesmen keep insisting that
 prices have been kept stable under the
 Great Society.
 At the same time official  /tatistics
 show that meat prices went up 131/2
 percent in 1965 to a record high.  In the
 past 5 years prices for food hrve risen
 about 11 percent.
 When the Great Society talks about
 stable prices.. I guess we all know what
 kind of stable they are talkin     about.
 Was not one of the famous labors of
 Hercules to clean out the Augea n stable,
 where all those bulls were kept':'
 The only thing steady about prices
 for Americans since Eisenhower is the
 increasing speed of the spiral of costs
 of living and the equally steady erosion
 of the buying power of the dollar.
 PRICE STABILITY
 (Mr. ADAIR (at the request, of Mr.
 HALL) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. ADAIR.  Mr. Speaker, the admin-
 istration keeps insisting that this coun-
 try enjoys "price stability."  Under the
 Great Society prices are about as steady
 as a drunken man on roller skates on an
 icy sidewalk.
 In just 5 years, almost everything that
 people eat, wear, or use has gone up-
 up-up-an.d the dollar has gone down-
 down-down-in purchasing power.
 On the basis of official Federal figures
 from September 1961, to the latest avail-
 able in 1965 men's shoes are up over 11
 percent in cost, suit cleaning and press-
 ing 8 percent, a private hospital room
 17 percent, a physician's home visit 13
 percent, a haircut 10 percent, a perma-
 nent wave 10 percent, cigarettes 11 per-
 cent, 8-hour domestic service 13 percent,
 and movie tickets 17 percent.
 And prices continue to spiral.  If you
 doubt this, ask your neighborhood grocer
 who charges you at least 11 percent more
 overall than he did 5 years ago.
 INFLATION
 (Mr. ROUDEBUSH (at the request of
 Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. ROUDEBUSH.  Mr. Speaker, in
 5 years of freewheeling, high spending
 razzle-dazzle under the Democrats, the
 dollar--cut loose from the ballast of gold,
 silver, and fiscal integrity-is leading us
 into runaway price inflation.
 The 1961 rent dollar is now worth only
 95.6 cents, the apparel dollar is down to
 96.4 cents, the medical dollar is down to
 91 cents, transportation to 94.5 cents,
 and the housing and rent dollar has
 dropped over  4  cents in this  5-year
 period.
 Inflation is the cruelest and most
 cowardly form of taxation ever devised,
 falling with especially crushing force on
 the poor and the old as well as the peo-
 ple with small fixed incomes.
 This is a tax, however, that falls on
 everyone living in these United States.
 It is a betrayal of the American people.
 VIETNAM.
 (Mr. EDW?RDS of Alabama (at the
 request of 1VIr. -Hn) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr.  EDWARDS . of  Alabama-  Mr.
 Speaker, according to news reports last
 week, the Communists in North Vietnam
 took good advantage of the pause in our
 bombing there to construct several mis-
 sile  sites.  They  also                                                                                                              rebuilt  many
 bridges, repaired damaged roads, and
 generally strengthened their position as
 the source of arms and supplies to the
 guerrillas  fighting our men  and the
 South Vietnamese people.
 We can be very sure that the North
 Vietnamese are not alone in their efforts.
 They receive substantial and essential
 help from outside in building missile in-
 stallations and in acquiring equipment
 needed to carry on their war, whether
 they do it during a bombing pause or not.
 Soviet Russia, as well as East European
 Communist satellite nations, are engaged
 in heavy supply operations to help North
 Vietnam.  East German and Polish cor-
 respondents  have  written  freely  of
 massed antiaircraft batteries and trucks

 which could come only from Soviet
 Russia.
 Most of these supplies move from Rus-
 sia to Vietnam by sea.  Radio Moscow it-
 self announced on December 23, "A con-
 stant caravan of merchant ships plies the
 line from Odessa, the Soviet Union's big-
 gest Black Sea port, to Haiphong,  the
 port of Hanoi."
 The broadcast went on to say that
 these ships are delivering goods which
 North  Vietnam  sorely  needs. Polish
 ships also carry goods, including modern
 equipment, to Vietnam.
 In order to reach Haiphong all these
 ships must pass through the Gulf of Ton-
 kin, which is said to be controlled by
 some of the largest and fastest American
 naval units, including naval aircraft.
 More and more these clays there is rea-
 son to take action.  To me it is incredible
 that we sit by and do nothing about this
 while our men are being shot at every
 day in Vietnam.
 The only explanation for our inaction
 has been that we are not officially at
 war. But this is not adequate. It infers
 that if we take action to stop this ship-
 ping we will be taking an act of war.
 Actually, there are different types of
 blockades, and some are clearly not clas-
 sified as acts of war.  In 1962 President
 Kennedy threatened a partial blockade
 of Cuba. It was not an act of war, and
 it worked: or, it worked for the brief
 time that it was enforced.
 That action was taken against ma-
 terials of war. Foods and medicines were
 clearly exempted.  This kind of action
 could well be considered now again.
 Or, there is another approach.  Way
 back in 1856 all major powers, including
 Russia, signed the Declaration of Paris
 which approved what was called a pacific
 blockade.  In this kind of blockade a
 country announces that a certain coastal
 area is closed until a limited objective is
 attained.           -
 Even earlier, in 1827, Great Britain,
 France, and Russia joined to use a pacific
 blockade to induce Turkey to enter into
 mediation to resolve a dispute.  Since
 that incident a pacific blockade has had
 the sanction of international law.
 I do not know if we could quickly or
 easily win the war in Vietnam by prevent-
 ing ships from carrying supplies to North
 Vietnamese ports, but we could cer-
 tainly make progress toward that goal,
 perhaps a great deal of progress.
 We must never forget that our boys'
 lives are at stake, and weapons of war are
 coming through Haiphong daily. There
 is no excuse for this to continue.
 I believe the American public deserves
 to have a statement as to why the Gov-
 ernment is not taking action.
 ADM. RICHARD' H. JACKSON
 (Mr. BOB WILSON (at the request of
 Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.}
 Mr. BOB WILSON.       Mr. Speaker, it is
 my distinct pleasure to introduce today,
 at the request of the American Battleship
 Association, a bill to authorize the :Press-
 dent to promote Adm. Richard H. Jack-
 son to the honorary rank of fleet admiral.
 My proposed legislation reads:
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives of the  United  States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the
 President is authorized and requested to pro-
 mote Admiral Richard H. Jackson, United
 States Navy retired, to the honorary rank of
 fleet admiral.
 SEc. 2. No individual shall be entitled to
 receive any bonus, gratuity, pay, or allow-
 ances by reasons of this Act.
 Mr'. Speaker, this most distinguished
 and remarkable gentleman will be 100
 years old on May 10 of this year. He is
 the oldest living graduate of the U.S.
 Naval Academy and he is surprisingly
 active and alert, residing in Coronado,
 Calif., in my congressional district.
 Richard Harrison Jackson was born in
 Tuscambia, Ala., on May 10, 1866, and en-
 tered the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis,
 Md., on appointment of the Honorable
 Luke Prior, of the Eighth Alabama Dis-
 trict, on June 4, 1883.  Completing the
 4-year course in June 1887, he went to sea
 for the 2 years' service then required by
 law before commissioning. He served on
 the U.S.S. Boston and U.S.S. Trenton
 and on June 30, 1889, was honorably dis-
 charged from naval service. As a naval
 cadet, he so distinguished himself dur-
 ing the sinking of the Trenton when he
 devised and, with the help of other mem-
 bers of the crew, made a human sail that
 he was restored to the service, with the
 rank of ensign, to date from July 1, 1890,
 by special act of Congress dated Septem-
 ber 26, 1890.
 Receiving progressive promotions he
 attained the rank captain on July 11,
 1915.  Appointed rear admiral-tem-
 porary-on June 30, 1919, he was com-
 missioned in that rank on June 3, 1921.
 He served in the rank of vice admiral
 from October 5, 1925, to July 24, 1926, and
 in that of admiral from from July 24,
 1926, to July 9, 1927. Transferred to the
 retired list of the Navy, in the rank of
 rear admiral, upon reaching the statutory
 retirement age of 64 on May 10, 1930, he
 was advanced to the rank of admiral-
 the highest rank in which he had
 served-on the retired list, by congres-
 sional legislation, on June 16, 1942.
 In addition, to the Navy Cross and
 French Legion of Honor, and the Order
 of Avis by Portugal, Admiral Jackson has
 the  Spanish  Campaign  Medal, the
 Philippine Campaign Medal, the China
 Relief Expedition Medal, and the World
 War I Victory Medal with Overseas Clasp.
 This May 10 on Admiral Jackson's
 100th birthday he will be honored at a
 banquet attended by the U.S. Navy's lead-
 ing admirals.  I am hopeful my col-
 leagues will move rapidly in favorably
 acting. on the bill I have introduced to-
 day to grant the honorary rank of fleet
 admiral to this wonderful gentleman,
 Adm. Richard H. Jackson.
 CONGRESS  SHOULD  DEBATE
 VIETNAM WAR
 (Mrs. DWYER (at the request of Mr.
 HALL) was granted permission to extend
 her remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mrs.  DWYER.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 President's decision, to resume bombing
 of North Vietnamese military targets, at
 least on a limited basis, has stimulated
 what may develop into a full-scale de-
 bate in Congress on the conduct of this
 complex and frustrating war.
 Such a debate is long overdue, and I
 welcome  it.  It  would  be  especially
 timely and desirable now that the United
 Nations has agreed to debate the Viet-
 nam issue.
 Whether one supports fully the Presi-
 dent's policies, or opposes them, or is
 somewhat confused and doubtful about
 them-which is the case with many of
 us here-another congressional "great
 debate" should be encouraged.  As a
 nation, we are confused about the issues
 in Vietnam, ignorant of some of the es-
 sential facts on which wise decisions must
 be based, and uninformed about the
 courses of action that are open to us.
 In such a situation, a comprehensive
 and candid congressional debate could do
 much to help clarify the issues and con-
 tribute toward an informed consensus, as
 opposed to an unenthusiastic acceptance
 of a policy we do not fully understand.
 At any rate, debate could do no harm,
 and it might develop in greater detail
 the facts, alternatives, and consequences
 we need to know.  The administration
 only increases the risks of an already
 dangerous situation by relying for sup-
 port on a confused and uninformed pub-
 lic.
 To a surprising extent, Congressmen
 and Senators profess to feel confused and
 uninformed themselves, and this fact
 adds a. serious new dimension to our
 dilemma when one considers that the
 President specifically relies on a resolu-
 tion approved by Congress for the au-
 thority to conduct the war in Vietnam,
 not to speak of the appropriations the
 war requires.  Congress, therefore, has a
 heavy obligation to inform itself and to
 enlighten the country.
 Until more information is available,
 until issues are clarified, Congress and
 the people have little alternative but to
 support the President's position in the
 immediate circumstances.  And this-
 despite considerable doubt and some dis-
 sent-is what most Congressmen and
 Senators are doing now.  But Congress-
 men should go further and make certain
 that we and the people we represent are
 as fully informed as military security
 permits.  Only then can a policy consen-
 sus have real meaning for a free people.
 I believe that our uncertainty extends
 to both the ends and the means of our
 policy toward Vietnam.  It is often as-
 sumed that Americans are united on ob-
 jectives even though we may differ on
 the means of attaining those ends, but
 I am afraid we should not take this as-
 sumption for granted.                                                                                                       It is true that
 most Americans, including myself, hope
 our policies will result in the contain-
 ment of aggressive communism in south-
 east Asia and .n the establishment of a
 stable and freely chosen government in
 Vietnam.  As ideals, these goals are fine.
 But what do they really mean, and what
 do they require to be attained?  Any
 congressional review of our policy must
 start here, with such fundamental ques-
 tions as, How far are we prepared to go?
 There is no doubt about our military
 capacity to win an early and total vic-
 tory over North Vietnam by bombing

 that country virtually out of existence.
 But would such a victory be worthwhile
 if it should mean taking on the Soviet
 Union in a nuclear war and engaging
 millions of Communist Chinese troops on
 the mainland and in Korea-a distinct
 possibility raised recently by no less a
 strategist than Gen. James Gavin?
 It we are not prepared for all-out war,
 can we realistically expect that our pres-
 ent strategy of gradual escalation will
 force the Communists to agree to negoti-
 ate a. settlement?
 If  negotiations  should take place,
 could  any  workable   settlement  be
 reached, given the totally opposite aims
 of the Communists and ourselves?  How
 long could we expect any settlement to
 be maintained without the continued
 presence of large numbers of American
 troops?  Or would United Nations or
 other international supervision be prac-
 tical--or available?
 If no settlement should be possible,
 how long would we be prepared to fight
 with no better prospect in view than
 continued  military stalemate?  Would
 anything worth saving be left of South
 Vietnam if fighting should continue in-
 definitely at the present scale?
 Would General Gavin's suggestion of
 taking a stand in the coastal cities of
 South Vietnam provide a way to main-
 tain American resistance while reducing
 risks and casualties to a minimum?
 Could there be a better place-as some
 Have suggested-to defend freedom in
 southeast  Asia  than  Vietnam?   Or
 would American withdrawal there result
 necessarily in further Communist suc-
 cesses in Asia?
 'T'hese and other fundamental ques-
 tions must be considered out in the open.
 Whether public debate results in added
 support for the administration's present
 position or in demands for some kind of
 change, we should be a stronger, more
 united people.  While the President, of
 course, is constitutionally responsible for
 military and foreign policy decisions, it
 is  this  supplementary leadership role
 that Congress must now accept.
 CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE
 (Mr. TALCOTT (at the request of Mr.
 []ALL) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. TALCOTT.  Mr. Speaker, the rec-
 ord shows that Secretary of Labor Wirtz
 has taken the position that California
 agriculture did not sustain serious dislo-
 cation, or severe losses, as the result of
 his refusal to certify the need for sub-
 stantial numbers of supplemental farm-
 workers during 1965.  I understand he
 has indicated that no foreign agricul-
 tural workers will be permitted to work
 on California farms during 1966.  Rath-
 er, the Secretary proposes to continue
 dependence upon a variety of sociologi-
 arl  experiments  to  induce                    domestic
 workers to 1111 the gap.  The facts of
 the situation lead to different conclu-
 sions than those the Secretary evidently
 has reached, in my opinion.
 Mr.  Speaker, the able and distin-
 uished Senator from California GEORGE
 MuRpHY, has prepared a statement in
 which he places the matter in a different
 perspective.  I am pleased to bring his
 comments to the attention of my col-
 leagues and other interested persons, and
 include  the  statement  of  Senator
 MUepisy,  dated December 14, 1965, at
 this point in my remarks:
 STATEMENT BY  SENATOR: MTJRI,riY
 Recent statements of Secretary o)f Labor
 W. Willard Wirtz concerning the California
 farm labor picture serve only to compound
 the already existing confusion which he has
 created.  In my judgment he has misrepre-
 sented the facts and drawn misleading and
 unwarranted conclusions.
 It is natural that I should disagree with
 Mr. Wirtz because he looks at, the question
 from the standpoint of a commitment to
 certain labor leaders interested in increas-
 ing their ranks and in trying to justify his
 sociological  experiment.   I,  on  the  other
 hand, am concerned only with the general
 welfare of my State and its people, as well
 as its largest industry, agriculture.
 I am concerned with the thousands of jobs
 supplied by agriculture which were lost last
 year and which in the future may move into
 Mexico.   I am concerned with the cost of
 living which continues to rise addiniT further
 strain on the already overburdened family
 budget.
 In short, Mr. Wirtz is trying to prove a
 theory while I am committed to the general
 welfare of the people.
 Since the adjournment of Congress last
 month, I have toured California from one
 end to the other meeting with farm,. rs, large
 and small.
 I think it is time Mr. Wirtz stopped talk-
 ing theory and began talking to the farmers.
 He would find, as I have, that farmers every-
 where are in total disagreement with his po-
 sitions, policies, and statements-all of which
 ignore facts and dramatic evidence which is
 available to prove the farmer's side of the
 story.
 If Mr. Wirtz' policies had brou rht em-
 ployment to more American citizens and a
 healthier climate to our farming ?ndustry
 as he claims, 1: would indeed be delighted
 and join in the praise of his efforts.  Unfor-
 tunately, this is not the case.  Thy: results
 confirm my predictions and those of leading
 agriculture  economists,  farm  leaders,   and
 even Governor Brown, who felt from the very
 beginning that the Wirtz  plan would not
 work.
 lissed on a thorough study of the oast his-
 tory of California agriculture, it was ob-
 vious that supplemental workers would be
 needed to harvest many crops during the
 peak  periods  since  there  never has  been
 enough qualified  domestic  worker:;  avail-
 able to do the job.  Mr. Wirtz clammed he
 could supply these workers from the ranks
 of the domestic: unemployed and in spite of
 millions of dollars spent; on an unsuccessful
 national recruitment program, he has been
 proved incorrect.
 I have asked for the full cost of this ill-
 advised recruitment program, but  o far I
 have been unable  to get; any  fip.ues re-
 leased from the Department of Labor.
 I predicted that the dictatorial nterfer-
 once of the Secretary of Labor in agriculture
 would lead only to increases in grocery prices
 to the housewife. Here again we have un-
 fortunately been proven correct.
 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic: reports
 that the retail price of fresh tomatoes in the
 San Francisco area in October stood at 23.8
 cents a, pound compared with 18.2 cents a
 year before.  This report was quoted in the
 Los Angeles Herald 'Examiner on December
 2, 1965, along with a long list of oth:'r prices
 which are In complete disagreement with
 Some quoted by Secretary Wirtz.  As far as
 I am concerned, I don't believe there is a
 housewife anywhere in America WOO isn't
 painfully aware that the cost of living is
 up.
 Mr. Wirtz' recent statements have coin-
 pletely misrepresented what has happened
 to agriculture this past year.  He has pur-
 posely overlooked the serious losses of crops
 suffered by our farmers, the thousands of
 acres of vegetables never planted, the in-
 crease in production costs, the exodus of
 many farmers seeking new locations in Mex-
 ico, and the increase in wholesale and re-
 tail prices.  He also seems unaware of the
 fact that a great deal of California crops
 continue to be harvested by Mexican na-
 tionals and that the number of wetbacks
 in California appears to be double that of
 last year.
 I can understand Mr. Wirtz' reluctance to
 point out these matters, as they completely
 expose the failure of his policies this year.
 A full  examination would show that the
 Secretary has substituted one plan already
 proven unworkable for another all year long
 without coming up with any new or prac-
 tical approach to the problem.
 Instead  of  putting  California's  unern-
 ployed to war], on our farms, as he originally
 intended, Mr.. Wirtz'  program has  simply
 substituted  -35,000  extra Mexican green-
 card workers (recorded as domestics for sta-
 tistical purposes)                                                                                                                                  and Illegal entries (wet-
 backs)  for those who came to the United
 States under the well-organized and prop-
 erly supervised bracero program.  Today, as
 in the past, Mexican workers are supplying
 California agriculture's supplemental man-
 power needs.
 When Mr. Wirtz asserted that domestic
 farm employment was up 20,000 to 25,000
 this year, he deliberately neglected to men-
 tion reliable estimates that there have been
 about 35,000 more green-card workers who
 are considered domestics.  Nor did h.e men-
 tion that tens, of thousands of wetbacks are
 known to have been on our farms this year.
 I have also been told by responsible labor
 leaders that Mr. Wirtz' mistakes have actu-
 ally cost one union about 20,000 jobs.
 A basic fact shatters all of Mr, Wirtz' con-
 tentions that his experiment was successful.
 The total agricultural employment in Cali-
 fornia has throughout the year been sub-
 stantially less than it was last year--41,000
 less, for example the week after Labor Day in
 spite of the 35,000 extra green-card Mexican
 workers which. Mr. Wirtz insists on counting
 as domestics.
 Mr.  Wirtz'  fantastic schemes  have  not
 provided our farmers with the workers they
 needed nor our expanding population with
 much-needed new jobs.  In fact, in his at-
 tempt to eliminate unemployment he has
 actually eliminated jobs.
 The same day Mr. Wirtz was trying: to tell
 the  housewives  that  he  has  not  caused
 higher food prices, newspapers throughout
 the State were carrying a report from Sacra-
 mento under the headlines:  "Bracero Ban
 Ups Grocery Prices."  The story, dated De-
 cember 2,                                                                                                                                      1965, disclosed that  "California
 agriculture's first year without access to a
 large reservoir of bracero labor is nearing
 an end with rising consumer prices on many
 products  already forcing  housewives   to
 stretch food budget dollars."
 Commonsense alone would tell anyone that
 you  cannot  impose  increased  production
 costs and inefficiency on the farmers and
 lower the acreage planted without raising
 prices everywhere down the line, from the
 farm to the grocery shelves.
 Mr. Wirtz    admitted  that the  asparagus
 growers had suffered losses, but he blamed
 it on the weather "playing a trick."  The fact
 is that nature is always unpredictable and
 that is exactly why we need a supplemental
 farm labor force ready and able to pick the
 crops when needed.  If we had had the work-
 ers when needed for the asparagus harvest,
 the crop would not have been lost.

 By so doing we have greatly weakened

 ask for the international criticism that
 we are getting because of our course of
 conduct in Vietnam.
 But let me tell the Senate of one chap-

 that is the building up of a privileged

 this sanctuary, in violation of our inter-

 of military sanctuaries by Communist
 nations anywhere in Asia or elsewhere
 in the world.
 It is always interesting to me that so
 many in our own country, who think so
 much better of themselves than the rest
 of the world thinks of us, are willing to
 ignore our own transgressions and seek
 to fix attention on the transgressions of
 our enemies.  We have not, under the
 terms of the SEATO Treaty, lived up to
 our obligations to report our activities
 to the Security Council.
 Therefore, we are violating the U.N.
 Charter whether we are acting in South
 Vietnam under paragraph 1 or under
 paragraph 2.  In either case, we are
 violating article 2, paragraph 4, of the
 charter which states that "all members
 shall refrain in their international re-
 lations from the threat or use of force."
 We have violated article 33 of the char-
 ter which requires that parties to a dis-
 pute "shall, first of all, seek a solution
 by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, con-
 ciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement,
 resort to regional agencies or arrange-
 ments, or other peaceful means of their
 our choice" and note that article 33 re-
 quires that these steps be taken "first
 of all."
 I repeat it-article 33 requires that
 these steps be taken "first of all."
 Mr. President, I am saddened by the
 fact that history will record that my
 Government did not take those steps
 first of all, and convicted herself of being
 a violator of the United Nations Charter.
 We have violated article 37, which
 states that "should the parties to a dis-
 pute of the nature referred to in article
 33 fail to settle it by the means indi-
 cated in that article, they shall refer it
 to the Security Council." We have vio-
 lated article 39, which states that "the
 Security Council shall determine the
 existence of any threat to the peace,
 breach of the peace or act of aggression."
 If we are invoking SEATO, we have and
 are violating article 53 of the United
 Nations Charter which states that "no
 enforcement action shall be taken un-
 der regional arrangements or by regional
 agencies without the authorization of the
 Security Council."
 From the floor of the. Senate tonight,
 Mr. President, I ask you: When did you,
 as Commander in Chief, ask for Secu-
 rity Council authorization for us to en-
 gage in armed conflict in southeast Asia
 under SEATO? Neither President John-
 son nor Dean Rusk nor McNamara can
 erase the  indelible language of the
 United Nations Charter, and that lan-
 guage is binding On us as well as on
 every other signatory to the charter.
 Some of -my colleagues and some peo-
 ple in the administration do not like it
 because I point out that our hands are
 not clean.  Let me say that sometimes
 the United Nations is referred to as a
 tribunal of equity.  I used to teach my
 law students that old doctrine of equity
 that one appears before a court of
 equity, if one expects to have equity
 done, only with clean hands.
 The sad thing is that the United States
 cannot appear before the United Nations
 with clean hands, so far as our violations
 of the charter are concerned. It is im-
 portant that we wash them.  That is
 why I believe it is so laudable that at
 long last we are before the United Na-
 tions.  We must accept a considerable
 amount of criticism, because we have it
 coming to us.
 I would not have my ambassador hesi-
 tate to see to it that others with unclean
 hands have their records spread open in
 the United Nations.
 But this stage must be put behind us.
 The record will have to be made against
 us, against our enemies, and against our
 potential enemies.  Then the members
 of the United Nations must settle down,
 in my judgment, and reach an under-
 standing as to how we can best bring an
 end to a war in southeast Asia which.
 by the day is increasing the threat of
 a third world war.
 For many months past I have urged
 that the Security Council-or in the case
 of a veto, the General Assembly-con-
 sider a recommendation that the mem-
 bers of the Geneva Conference of 1954
 reconvene and seek to arrive at an ar-
 rangement whereby they can implement
 and effectuate the basic tenets of the
 Geneva accords of 1954.  At long last-
 although for many months our admin-
 istration would not hear of it-our Gov-
 ernment now indicates that it would be
 willing to consider these accords.
 Arthur Goldberg is now saying that if
 the United Nations would agree to do
 that, we would be at Geneva tomorrow.
 This means, of course, that we would
 have to sit down with the Communists.
 What a change. This means, of course,
 that there would be a reconvening of the
 Geneva Conference.  This means that
 there would have to be a recognition of
 another basic truism of international
 law, and that is that a Communist nation
 has exactly the same sovereign rights un-
 der international law as a free nation.
 In spite of all the hysteria and war
 propaganda that is stalking this country
 and misleading many Americans, let us
 face up to the fact that we cannot wish-
 fully think Communists and their gov-
 ernments off the face of the earth. Nor
 can we bomb them off the face of the
 1975
 earth.  We can win military victories
 over them, but that will never give us
 peace.
 The objective should be to lead man-
 kind toward peace and not toward war,
 even though through war we might gain
 some surrenders.
 So I am again pleading tonight, Mr.
 President, that my country recognize how
 important it is that we do everything we
 can to try to have the Geneva Conference
 reconvened in order to carry out the
 basic tenents of the 1954 accords.
 When will my Government face up to
 the fact that the Geneva accords of 1954
 not only did not provide for two govern-
 ments in Vietnam, but literally pro-
 hibited it?  It was pointed out in the
 language of the accords that the 17th
 parallel was only a demarcation between
 two military zones; that the French mili-
 tary were to repair to the south of the
 17th parallel while the Viet Minh would
 remain in the north; and that then, for
 the next 2 years, under the direction of
 the International Control Commission,
 consultations would take place leading to
 an application of the principle of self-
 determination in July 1956, by way of a
 free election supervised by the Interna-
 tional Control Commission.
 The sordid, black, unfortunate chapter
 of American history that we wrote at that
 time will plague future generations of
 Americans because we stopped that elec-
 tion. We not only stopped that election
 but we, the United States, set up a puppet
 government in South Vietnam and by so
 doing we clearly voilated the Geneva
 accords.
 I have been reading with great in-
 terest the discussions of our spokesmen
 about our willingness now to see a recon-
 vening of the Geneva Conference and the
 implementation and the effectuation of
 the agreements reached in 1954.
 I wonder if they recognize the chal-
 lenge that is going to be made to our
 action in violating the Geneva accords
 by taking Diem out of New York and
 Washington, D.C., sending him to South
 Vietnam, financing him, militarizing him,
 and creating a government there to serve
 our interests.
 All they have to do is listen to the
 criticisms of us in New York City these
 days or go with me across Asia, and it
 will soon be discovered that all of the rest
 of the world seems to know this except
 the American people.  Then, there will
 be the job of concealing from the Amer-
 ican people the ugly facts about our un-
 fortunate military policy in southeast
 Asia.
 In this stormy weather in Washington,
 D.C., I can think of no more descriptive
 term than to say once again that a
 "snow job" has been done on the think-
 ing of the American people.
 No, Mr. President; we have violated
 section after section of the United Na-
 tions Charter in regard to our illegalities.
 If we are invoking SEATO, we have
 and are violating article 53 which states:
 No enforcement action shall be taken un-
 der regional arrangements or by regional
 agencies without the authorization of the
 Security Council.
 And we are violating article 103 which
 states:

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORL) - SENATE         February 3, 190
 BALL MISREPRESENTATIONS Or' SEATO
 In a speech at Northwestern Univer-
 sity last Sunday, Undersecretary George
 Ball further obfuscated our position by
 saying of the SEATO Treaty :
 Under that treaty and its protocol, the
 United States and other treaty p. rtners gave
 their joint and several pledges to guarantee
 existing boundaries-including  the line  of
 demarcation between North and South Viet-
 nam  established  when  the  Fv'nch                                                                       relin-
 quished their control over Indochina.
 This is, too, a gross misstatement of
 our commitment  under the             SEATO
 Treaty.  There is nothing in this treaty
 which says that we or our treaty part-
 ners  pledged  to                                                                     '"guarantee        existing
 boundaries" anywhere-and George Ball
 knows it.  Contrary to Mr. Ball's dis-
 torted interpretation, we certainly did
 not commit ourselves to maintain a per-
 manently divided Vietnam.
 Once again, Mr. Ball has fallen into
 the pit which the administration digs
 for itself every time it tries to endorse
 the 1954 Geneva agreement and an in-
 dependent South Vietnam at one and
 the same time.  The two assertions are
 totally contradictory.
 Under the  1954 Geneva agreements
 which ended the war in Indochina the
 division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel
 was a "provisional military demarcation"
 line.
 The final declaration of that confer-
 ence states that this line "should not in
 any way be interpreted as constituting
 a political or territorial boundary."  The
 final declaration went on  to  spell out
 that the "military demarcation line"
 was to be obliterated through unification
 elections to be held throughout Vietnam
 in July 1956.  We all know why these
 elections were not held as promised: Be-
 cause Diem and we knew that no non-
 Communist leader could hope to equal
 Ho Chi Minh at the ballot box.
 To say that a divided Vietnam is guar-
 anteed  under SEATO will riot strike
 Hanoi or Peiping as being unusual.  It
 only proves what the Communists have
 been saying all along: that despite the
 words of President Johnson that we sup-
 port the 1954  agreement,  rho United
 States has no intention of carrying out
 its principles and that our real objective
 is to maintain a divided Vietnam with an
 American puppet government in South
 Vietnam.  It is little wonder that the
 Communists    doubt   our   intentions.
 When we use doubletalk in stating our
 policies-as George Ball did when he
 spoke at Northwestern  University  last
 Sunday-that we support a n ?turn to the
 1954  Geneva  agreements  and  at the
 same time say that under SEATO we are
 committed to a divided Vietnam-there
 is no question about which line they will
 believe.
 Either we  support the 1954 agree-
 ments-designed to create a unified Viet-
 nam-or we do not.  The State Depart-
 ment's position on this point, like its
 policies in Vietnam generally, are ambig-
 uous, deceptive and, although calculated
 to fool our own citizens, the free world,
 and  the other side, really fool no one.
 But they destroy the credibility of this
 Government.  Until the State Depart-
 ment and the President begin to be hon
 est with themselves and the people then
 is little hope for achieving peace througl
 the United Nations or any other means
 As a first step I suggest that they hire s
 few people who can read the plain Eng-
 lish in the 1954 agreements and the
 SEATO  treaty.   It  does not  take  a
 Philadelphia lawyer to read them-but ii
 does take more than the abilities of the
 best international lawyer in Philadel-
 phia to make legal sense out of the State
 Department's position.
 Undersecretary of State Ball has of ter
 been described as the leading dove in the
 Department of State.  In the light of
 what Mr. Ball said at Northwestern Uni-
 versity last Sunday, he looks more to nie
 like a dove in hawk's feathers, unless he
 is a pigeon.
 There was a sharp and militant edge to
 Mr.  Ball's  remarks  last Sunday.  He
 described the alliances and commitments
 of this country as "a barrier around the
 whole  periphery  of  the    Communist
 world."  He said that the battles our
 soldiers and marines are fighting   in
 South Vietnam are "skirmishes in a con-
 tinuing war to prevent one Communist
 power after another from violating in-
 ternationally recognized boundary lines
 fixing the outer limits of Communist
 dominion."  He referred to the "cynical
 and systematic aggression by the North
 Vietnamese regime" and called it "one
 further chapter of the long and brutal
 chronicle of Communist efforts to extend
 the periphery of Communist power by
 force and terror."  This is hardly the
 language of temperance.  It is the same
 kind of name-calling that. we constantly
 accuse our adversaries of adopting.  It
 is not the language of statesmanship. It
 is evidence of emotionalism and subjec-
 tivity when dispassion and reason are
 needed.
 I gather from Mr. Ball's remarks that
 he feels that the United States has a
 holy writ to fix the geographic :limits
 beyond which communism will not be
 permitted.  Do we grant our adversaries
 the same right?  What if the course of
 events had proceeded differently in In-
 donesia and the Indonesian Communist
 Party, which was the third largest Corn-
 munisr, Party in the world, had succeeded
 in establishing a Communist government
 in that country?  Would that have been
 beyond the "outer limits" Secretary Ball
 mentioned?  What about the new na-
 tions of Africa?                                                                                                                         Are they beyond the
 outer limits, are they outside the "barrier
 around the whole periphery of the Com-
 munist world" to which Mr. Ball referred
 last Sunday?
 Simply stated, we are fighting a uni-
 lateral. war in Vietnam that is militarily
 impractical, politically foolish, and inor-
 ally indefensible.  It must be stopped
 before the virulent language and the de-
 ception practiced by both sides renders
 all peaceful solutions impossible.
 I know that there are those, even some
 Members of this body, who take the.po-
 sition that we who criticize the foreign
 policy of our Government are in some
 way letting down the boys who are fight-
 ing in South Vietnam.
 In the event of a conflict between the ob-
 ligations of members of the United Nations
 under the present charter and their obliga-
 tions under any other international agree-
 ment, their obligations under the present
 charter shall prevail.
 Inciden tally, this principle of the prim-
 acy of the U.N. Charter is reiterated in
 article VL. of the Southeast Asia Collec-
 tive Defense Treaty.  And article I of the
 treaty states:
 The panics undertake, as set forth in the
 charter of the United Nations, to settle any
 international  disputes in which they may
 be involved by peaceful means.
 SSNERRAL TO U.N.
 In his trews conference of January :31,
 Secretary Rusk said that the time had
 come to meet the requirements of "para-
 graph 1 of article IV of the Southeast
 Asia Treaty itself to report this present
 situation to the Security Council."  Here
 for the first time, we find the Secretary
 referring specifically to paragraph 1 of
 article IV of the Southeast Asia Collec-
 tive Defense Treaty. But he still does not
 say that we are now fighting in South
 Vietnam under paragraph 1, and not
 paragraph 2, though that is the clear
 implication.  At any rate, we are obeying
 the spirit if not the letter of the obliga-
 tion in paragraph 1 to report the meas-
 ures being taken to the Security Council
 after fighting there for some 2 years
 without doing it.  I say that we are not
 obeying the letter of the law in this case
 because, as I have pointed out, paragraph
 I requires that the measures being taken
 under its authority shall be immediately
 reported to the Security Council.  We
 have certainly not made this report im-
 mediately and "better late than never" is
 hardly a principle of international law.
 Now that we have referred the situa-
 tion in Vietnam to the Security Council,
 our violations of articles 33 and 37 of
 the U.N. Charter are no longer as blatant.
 We are finally seeking a solution to the
 dispute by mediation or arbitration, as
 article 33 obliges us to. We have not done
 this "first of all" as article 33 requires,
 but at least we have made a gesture in
 this direction.  By referring the dispute
 to the Security Council on January 31,
 we are finally complying with our obliga-
 tion under                        article 37 of the charter.
 is am, of course, pleased to see this
 matter referred to the United Nations.
 I have been urging this course of action
 since March of 1964, and I am distressed
 that it has taken the administration so
 long to realize what our obligations are
 to the L.N. Charter.
 Secretary's Rusk's assertions that we
 have a "clear and direct commitment" to
 South Vietnam under the Southeast Asia
 Collective  Defense  Treaty  are  feeble,
 v_r?Cue, and unconvincing.   In fact, we
 have no commitment to them for they
 are not a party to the treaty.       What
 commitment we do have, is to the other
 parties to the treaty. It is either to con-
 sult with them, if we are acting under
 paragraph 2 of article IV of the treaty,
 or to act with them to meet the common
 danger if paragraph 1 applies.  What we
 have done in South Vietnam is to inter-
 vene unilaterally when we are by no
 means committed to do so.

 February 3,. 1966         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Those of us who are trying to change
 the foreign policy course of our Govern-
 ment, in order to bring this Govern-
 ment's policy back Into the framework
 of the Constitution of the United States,
 are seeking to bring an end to the kill-
 ing of our boys in South Vietnam.  We
 are seeking to prevent the development
 of a situation in which tens upon tens of
 thousands, and perhaps millions, of our
 boys will be sent into a massive war in
 Asia, to die unjustifiably and unneces-
 sarily.
 Therefore, Mr. President, the issue is
 being drawn as to whether the admin-
 istration is to be continued to be sup-
 ported in the conduct of this illegal and
 unconstitutional war, or whether, at
 long last, we shall adopt a foreign policy
 that will amount, in fact, to the substi-
 tution of the rule of law for America's
 jungle law of military force in southeast
 Asia.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous per-
 mission to have printed in the RECORD
 at this point the text of the SEATO
 Treaty, and the text of the Geneva ac-
 cords.
 There being no objection the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 12.  FINAL  DEC T.ARATION  OF GENEVA  CONFER-
 JULY                                              21, 1954 ~
 h inal declaration, dated July 21, 1954, of
 the Geneva Conference on the problem of re-
 storing peace in Indo-China, in which the
 representat.] ves of Cambodia, the Democratic
 Republic of Viet-Nam, France, Laos, the Pee-
 pie's Republic of China, the State of Viet-
 nam,                   the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Re-
 publics,  the                      United  Kingdom,      and  the
 United States of America took part.
 1. The Conference takes note of the agree-
 ments ending hostilities in Cambodia, Laos
 and Viet-Nam and organizing international
 control and the supervision of the execution
 of the provisions of these agreements.
 2.  The Conference expresses satisfaction
 at  the ending of hostilities in Cambodia.
 Laos  and  Viet-Nam:  the  Conference  ex-
 presses its conviction that the execution of
 the provisions set out in the present declara-
 tioo and in the agreements on the cessation
 of hostilities will permit Cambodia, Laos and
 Vier,-Nam henceforth to play their part, in
 full independence and sovereignty, in the
 peaceful community of nations.
 3. The Conference takes note of the dec-
 la.ra.tions made by the Governments of Cam-
 IC/ 43iri v.  2,  21  July  1954,  Original:
 I'r'cnch.
 bodia and of Laos of their intention to adopt
 measures permitting all citizens to take their
 place in the national community, in particu-
 lar by participating in the next general elec-
 tions, which, in conformity with the consti-
 tution of each of these countries, shall take
 place in the course of the year 1955, by secret
 ballot and in conditions of respei c for fun-
 damental freedoms.
 4. The Conference takes note of the clauses
 In the agreement on the cessation of hostili-
 ties in Viet-Nam prohibiting the introduc-
 tion into Viet-Nam of foreign hoops and
 military personnel as well as of all kinds of
 arms and munitions.  The Conference also
 takes note of the declarations made by the
 Governments of Cambodia and Laos of their
 resolution not to request foreign aid, whether
 in war material, in personnel or In instruc-
 tors except for the purpose of the effective
 defence of their territory and, in the case of
 Laos, to the extent defined by the agree-
 ments on the cessation of hostilities; in Laos.
 5. The  Conference  takes  note  of  the
 clauses in the agreement on the cessation
 of hostilities in Viet-Nam to the effect that
 no military  base under the   control  of a
 foreign State may be established in the re-
 grouping zones of the two parties, the lat-
 ter having the obligation to see that the
 zones allotted to them shall not constitute
 part of any military alliance and shall not
 be utilized for the resumption of hostilities
 or in the service of an aggressive policy.  The
 Conference also takes note of the declarations
 of the Governments of Cambodia and Laos
 to the effect that they will not join in any
 agreement with other States; if this agree-
 ment includes the obligation to participate
 in a military alliance not in conformity with
 the principles of the Charter of the United
 Nations or, in the case of Laos. with the
 principles of the agreement on the cessa-
 tion of hostilities in Laos, or so long as their
 security is not threatened, the obligation to
 establish  bases  on Cambodian or  Laotian
 territory for the military forces of foreign
 Powers.
 6. The Conference recognizes that, the es-
 sential purpose of the agreement relating to
 Viet-Nam is to settle military questions with
 a view to ending hostilities and  that the
 military demarcation line is provisional and
 should not in any way be interpreted as
 constituting a political or territorial bound-
 ary.   The Conference expresses its convic-
 tion that the execution of the provisions set
 out in the present declaration and in the
 agreement  on  the  cessation  of  hostilities
 creates the necessary ba:?is for the achieve-
 ment in the near future of a political settle-
 meat in Viet-Nam.
 7. The  Conference  declares that, so far
 as Viet-Nam IS concerned, the settlement of
 political problems, effected on the basis of
 respect for the principles of independence,
 unity and territorial integrity, shall permit
 the Viet-Namese people to enjoy the funda-
 mental freedoms, guaranteed by democratic
 institutions established as a. result of free
 general elections by secret ballot.  In order
 to ensure that sufficient progress in the res-
 toration of peace has been made, a:? id that all
 the necessary conditions obtain for free ex-
 pression of the national will, gei cral elec-
 tions shall be held In July 1956, under the
 supervision of an international commission
 composed of representatives of the Member
 States of the International Supervisory Coin-
 mission, referred to in the agreement on the
 cessation of hostilities.  Consultations will
 be held on this subject between the com-
 petent representative authorities of the two
 zones from 20 July 1955 onwards.
 8. The lrovisions of the agreements on the
 cessation of hostilities intended to ensure
 the protection of individuals and of prop-
 erty must be most strictly applied and must,
 in particular, allow everyone in Viet-Nara to
 decide freely in which zone he wishes to live.
 9. The competent representative authori-
 ties of the Northern and Southern zones of
 Viet-Nam, as well as the authorities of Laos
 and Cambodia, must not permit any indi-
 vidual or collective reprisals against persons
 who have collaborated in any way with one
 of the parties during the war, or against
 members of such persons' families.
 10. The Conference takes note of the dec-
 laration of the Government of the French
 Republic to the effect that it is ready to
 withdraw its troops from the territory of
 Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam, at the re-
 quest of the governments concerned and
 within periods which shall be fixed by agree-
 ment between the parties except in the cases
 where, by agreement between the two par-
 ties, a certain number of French troops shalt
 remain at specified points and for a specified
 time.
 11. The Conference takes note of the dec
 laration of the French Government to the
 effect that for the settlement of all the prob-
 lems connected with the re-establishmens
 and  consolidation  of peace  in  Cambodia,
 Laos and Viet-Nam, the French Government
 will proceed from the principle of respect for
 the independence and sovereignty, unity and
 territorial integrity of Cambodia, Laos and
 Viet-Nam.
 12. In their relations with Cambodia, Lao:;
 and Viet-Nam, each member of the Geneva
 Conference undertakes to respect the sov-
 ereignty, the independence, the unity and
 the territorial integrity of the above-men.-
 tioned states, and to refrain from any inter-
 ference in their internal affairs.
 13. The members of the Conference agree
 to  consult  one  another  on  any question
 which may be referred to them by the In-
 ternational Supervisory Commission in orde?
 to study such measures as may prove neces-
 sary to ensure that the agreements on the
 cessation of hostilities in Cambodia, Laos
 and Viet-Nair are respected.

 Both our military and political authorities
 in Vietnam--and to some extent throughout
 southeast Asia---often give the Impression of
 lacking political realism through failure to
 take time into account as it key psychological
 factor in our strategy for the war.  U.S. civil-
 ian experts talk glibly about the need for the
 American people to face a generation of con-

 operations can be launched before the end
 of the present U.S. troop builclup----.assum-

 struggle honorably,  at  an acceptable cost

 The one task we cannot shirk in Vietnam
 is finishing the job we committed ourselves
 to in the eyes of Asia to complete: that of
 effectively putting a stop to all North Viet-

 THE Ho CHI MINH TRAIL AND OUR THAI
 BUILDUP
 (By Denis Warner)
 BANGKOK.-"Within 3 hours of their arrival
 here by air we could have the troops an the
 road with everything they need in the way
 of equipment."  The briefing officer from the
 7th U.S. Maintenance Battalion spoke with
 pride as he showed me around the supply
 depot in Korat, Thailand.  With a minimum
 of publicity and what appears to be maxi-
 mum efficiency, this little-known, and de-
 pressed economic and political center of the
 15 backward northeastern Thai provinces has
 become a military base with impressive of-
 fensive and defensive potentials.
 The tanks, the amphibious carriers, the
 trucks, and jeeps are loaded and ready to
 go.  The guns are hitched to their carriages.
 Under a huge tent inflated by compressed air
 I counted more than a hundred jeeps.  They
 occupied only a small part of the 176,000
 square feet of covered space available. There
 are another 144,000 square feet of semiper-
 manent installations providing controlled-
 humidity storage space.  There are miles of
 water and oil pipelines, and immense stacks
 of barbed wire.  Complete bridge units are
 loaded on trucks. There are railway ties and
 rails, ammunition, guns-the lot.
 The amount of supplies is secret, but there
 is enough to keep the 7th Maintenance Bat-
 talion busy full time.          "You can say that we
 have more than 41,000 tons of equipment
 valued at $50 million if you like," the briefing
 officer told me.  "Or you might say that we
 have more than enough for a battalion and
 less than enough for a division."  An edu-
 cated guess suggests that the higher estimate
 may well be conservative, but in any event
 the materiel now available is primarily of
 symbolic  importance.   Impressive as  the
 buildup is, it is overshadowed by the emer-
 gency program now underway that within
 a few months will multiply Korat's military
 potential and, if need be, permit expansion
 of the already established control unit, the
 9th U.S. Logistical Command "B," to its full
 capacity of between 35,000 and 65,000 support
 troops and a field force of 100,000 combat
 troops.
 As a base, Korat still suffers from many
 handicaps.   Improved rail communications
 and the construction of the Friendship High-
 way in 1958 halved the travel time to and
 from Bangkok. But Bangkok is  itself  a
 bottleneck.  Four-fifths  of  Thailand's ex-
 panding foreign trade                     passes through its
 inadequate port facilities, and it cannot cope
 with the operational needs of a "B"-category
 U.S. logistical command.
 To meet the situation, the United States
 is building a new military airfield, port, and
 over-the-beaches landing zone at Ban Sat-
 tahip, about a hundred miles south-south-
 east of Bangkok.  Existing roads and rail
 lines between Ban Sattahip and Korat are
 being improved and the 538th Engineer Bat-
 talion is completing a 163-mile direct all-
 weather route between the two bases through
 the rugged limestone hills that skirt the
 southern rim of the Karat plateau.   The
 road is scheduled to be fully operational in
 March.  "If you think Camranh Bay is im-
 pressive, go to Sattahip about the middle of
 the year and see what is doing there," one
 American officer told me.  "There has never
 been another military pipeline quite like
 this."

 1950                        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         February 3, 1966
 Despite seemingly effective landslide bomb-
 ing missiions, the Vietcong have continued
 to use two main entry routes into Laos from
 North Vietnam, the Mu Gia and Nape Passes.
 Two roads, including one newly built, run
 south to the main staging post of Tchepcne
 on Route 9.   A third access route crosses
 the demilitarized zone in the Vietcong-domi-
 nated northwestern region of South Vietnam
 and picks lip Route 9.
 bouts it is critical.  Deny it to the Vietcong
 and the trail is out.   But this is neither
 tactically nor logistically feasible in an op-
 eration mounted exclusively in South Viet-
 nam.  The 1st ARVN Division in Quang Tri
 Province, at the eastern end of Route 9, is
 experienced and  effective.   While its sc.c-
 cie;oes in recent months have been outstand-
 ing, it cannot by itself consolidate its gains
 in the immensely difficult terrain where Route
 9 crosses the Laotian border. To perform
 tl;it limited task, which would at most deny
 the Vietcong only one of the three main lines
 of communication from North Vietnam into
 Laos, would not only require substantial re-
 L:ifurcemerit  but  would  tax                                 the  logistical
 o pabilities of the American and Vietnamese
 forces at :Hue and Danang.  But to attempt a
 more substantial operation from bases on
 the coast would be next to impossible.
 A more obvious threat to the He Chi Minh
 Trail could be directed through Pakse and
 Stvannaklict in western Laos, where the going
 is much easier.  Provided that northeastern
 'I:'harland sloes not erupt into full-scale in-
 surgency, the lines of communication would
 be secure.  Moreover, the new supply route
 [rem Ban Sattahip through Korat would re-
 lieve South Vietnam of the major logistical
 strain of an operation that could eventually
 require three or more divisions.
 It, may he argued that such an operation
 would destroy all that remains of the 1962
 Geneva Agreement on Laos.   The political
 issues involved the reaction of both Vientiane
 and  the  Soviet  Union  and could present
 problems.   It has, however, long been ap-
 parent that North Vietnam signed that agree-
 ment only to safeguard its own unlawful and
 via-al corridor to South Vietnam. So far, the
 preservation of the fiction of Laotian ne'a-
 tra ity and noninvolvement has been useful
 in maints.;ning relative tranquillity in Vie;a-
 tian.e.  But to those in the field who favor
 such  an  operation,  this  consideration  is
 hardly a match for the issues at stake in
 Vietnam a. rid the frustration of the American
 effort threatened by the continued and ex-
 panding use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.                                 To
 these men, the questions that matter are
 whether there is demonstrable evidence that
 the North Vietnamese have abrogated the
 Geneva Agreement by their use of the Ho
 Clii Minh 'mail, whether the reinforcements
 osing the trail are of major significance in
 the Vietcong war effort, and finally, whether
 ground action against the trail would prove
 effective.
 'there can be no doubt about the answer
 to the first two questions.  As for the third,
 many responsible military men believe that
 the difficulties to be overcome would be re-
 warded by the results.  It is, therefore, not
 inconceivable that Korat, already a psycho-
 logleal threat to the Vietminh, may even-
 tually be ;invested with a major role in future
 U.S. offensive plans in South Vietnam,
 Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, after
 we have had an opportunity to review
 these articles, I think a debate on the
 resolution of the Senator would be very
 helpful.
 Mr. JAVI'I'S.  Mr. President, I am very
 grateful to the Senator for his interces-
 sion and for the very interesting articles
 from the Reporter magazine which I
 know will be helpful to our review.
 Mr. President, it requires time and
 atrition sometimes to have light break
 through to the real point. The point that
 I am pressing upon the President of the
 United States is-arid this is the light
 that I hope will break through to his con-
 sciousness-the fact, that this will help
 and not hurt.  It is not in derogation of
 the authority that he has been exercis-
 ing.  It. is no reflection on his authority
 to conduct foreign affairs.
 The President himself demonstrated
 that he wanted and needed to have the
 partnership of Congress by asking for
 the resolution of August, 1964,  Now that
 there is a new ball game, why does he not
 ask again and get the same fortification,
 the same strength, and the same sub-
 stantiality so that he cannot be chal-
 longed on the ground of illegality, as has
 been done, or challenged on the ground
 that he is using authority for a purpose
 which was never :intended, for a new pur-
 pose, for a new escalation of the struggle.
 l[  believe that e,-erythin; is to be
 gained and nothing is to be lost, beyond
 what has been already lost by furnishing
 food for the propaganda mills in Hanoi.
 The strength that can be afforded to
 our freedom and its decision far out-
 weighs any minor disadvantage of any
 character.
 As one who has supported the Presi-
 dent, I hope that before it is too late, in
 terms of graver disquiet than presently
 exists,  we  can  have  a  congressional
 debate.
 1: can understand why the congres-
 sional committees, representing the ma-
 jority, have been unwilling to have this
 debate so far unless the President should
 asia: for it.  Would it not be better for
 the President to ask for this resolution,
 as lie did in August of 1964, than to be
 forced to it?  The committees would
 take the ball and run with it.  That is
 what can result in view of the gathering
 storm in Congress, not because of the
 war in Vietnam, but because of the ap-
 parent feeling of the President that Con-
 gress should not have an opportunity to
 debate and vote on the issue.
 I urge the President to seek the benefit
 of this debate.
 1!rlr. President, to intellectual men-
 and the President is  an intelligent
 man-the proudest words in the English
 language are: "I am persuaded."
 I hope very much that the President
 may invite debate in this matter in view
 of the feelings of so many who thor-
 oughly support him in terms of what he
 is trying to do and in terms of the free-
 dom and safety of our Nation and of the
 world.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 will the Senator yield?
 Mr. JAVITS.  I yield.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 while I have not heard everything that
 the Senator has said, I believe that he is
 proposing a discussion on the floor of the
 Senate  in regard  to  the  Vietnamese
 situation.
 Mr. JAVITS. l[ say that thr' President
 should come to us again, as he did in
 August 1964, for a resolution on Vietnam.
 I say that as a supporter of the President.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 asa member of the Comrnittet? on Armed
 Services, and as a, member of the Appro-
 priations Subcommittee, I point out that
 the  authorization  and  appropriation
 bills must come before us within the next
 2 or 3 weeks.
 It would seem to me that there would
 be a very full discussion not only of the
 subject matter of the bills, but also of
 the entire problem that faces the Presi-
 dent and ourselves.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, the Sen-
 ator knows that there is no one whom I
 respect more than I do the senior Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts.  Yet, I do not
 believe that the discussion and debate
 which will be engendered, as it will be, by
 the  authorization  and appropriation
 bills, will. be quite opposite to what the
 Senator from Colorado F. Mr. DOMINICK I
 and other Senators, myself included, are
 talking about.
 The authorization and appropriation
 bills represent a  different issue.  The
 issue would be whether we were going to
 support the men in the field.
 This is not something that I imagine.
 We had this issue in connection with
 the appropriation last year of the $.'00
 million.
 The entire debate was stultified by the
 fact that no one would ever desire to
 stop the appropriation of money for men
 who are fighting.  We have been there
 ourselves. Many of us have been in the
 armed services.
 The only thing that is germane is that
 the policy is up for determination in a
 sense resolution.
 The President has done it before., in
 my judgment, a little arbitrarily. Speak-
 ing as one who supports the President
 in his policy, I am asking him to do it
 again when the situation is so changed
 and when there is a gathering sto:rm of
 feeling that it should be done.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 I do not believe the Senator from Now
 York and the Senator from Massachu-
 setts are very far apart in their points
 of view.
 My point is simply that in our herr-
 ings, which extended over a period of
 3 days, there was testimony from the
 Secretary of Defense and from General
 Wheeler and others.  The entire prob-
 lem was discussed.
 I agree that there was no discussion as
 to whether a new resolution was needed.
 However, the entire general principle as
 to why we were there and what we were
 doing was discussed.
 Mr. JAVITS.   Mr. President, "[  am
 grateful to my colleague.

 is in fact the defense of a vital Interest of
 the United States.
 Nations do not fight Indefinitely if they
 are not convinced that their own vital inter-
 ests are at stake.  Although the Korean war
 began under much better legal and moral
 auspices than did our entanglement in Viet-
 nam, the American people came to hate the
 Korean war.  The reason for that was that
 they did not believe that the interests of
 America In Korea on the Asian mainland
 were great enough to justify the casualties
 that were being suffered.
 The other principal difficulty in uniting
 the country behind a national purpose in
 Indochina is that the President's diplomatic
 advisors  have never defined our national
 purpose except in the vaguest, most ambig-
 uous generalities about aggression and free-
 dom.   The country   could be united-in
 the preponderant mass-on a policy which
 rested on a limited strategy and on limited
 political objectives.  It cannot be united on
 a policy of trading American lives for Asian
 lives on the mainland of Asia in order to
 make General Ky or his successor the ruler
 of all of South Vietnam.  The division of
 the country will simply grow worse as the
 casualties and the costs increase and the
 attainment of our aims and the end of the
 fighting continue to elude us.
 The revision of our policy in Vietnam-
 the revision of our strategy and our political
 purposes  and plans-is  the  indispensable
 condition of a really united country and of
 an eventual truce abroad.  Gestures, prop-
 aganda, public relations, and bombing and
 more bombing will not work.  Without a
 revision of the policy-of our war aims as
 stated by Secretary Rusk of our military
 strategy  as  approved  by Secretary  Mc-
 Narnara-the President will find that he is
 in a dead end street.
 He added that Bloomberg's initiation of
 the post oRice's impact training program was
 the factor most responsible for the assistant
 postmaster being selected for the honor.
 "The impact program," Clemens explained,
 "is Intended to inject a human relations at-
 titude  into labor-management discussions
 and  is  a landmark in  labor-management
 dealings within the post office system."
 Other training awards presented last night
 went to Dwight P. Jacobus, supervisor of
 education service to industry, State Depart-
 ment of Education, and to Clyde S. Hartlove,
 vice president of public relations and em-
 ployee  development, Esskay Quality Moat
 Co.
 Clemens noted that although the M.TSTD's
 three-man awards committee was composed
 of members of industry, two of the three
 awards were presented to Government em-
 ployees-one Federal and one State.
 If a certain clement. of pride can be de-
 tected  there,   it's                                                                                  probably   pardonable.

 TIIE  CIIURCUES  AND  VIETNAM-NO  MATTEa
 How AMDIGUOUS ARE TIM IssuES INVOLVED
 IN TIIE  CONFLICT,    TIIE  CHRISTIAN GOSPEL
 MAKES  CERTAIN  ATTITUDES  TOWARD THEM
 CLEAR
 (By Georgia Harkness)
 In the face of the escalating war in Viet-
 nam the churches have been conspicuously
 failing to direct the thinking of their mem-
 bers on the portentous issues involved. At its
 meeting in December the National Council
 of Churches' General Board adopted an ad-
 mirable policy statement and message, but
 so far as local congregations are concerned a
 question uppermost in the minds and hearts
 of millions of Americans is being bypassed
 in American Protestantism.
 There is no denying the complexity of the
 situation, a complexity that leaves one un-
 certain what to say unless he accepts or
 rejects outright the administration's posi-
 tion.  Yet our first obligation as Christians
 is clear: to maintain our ethical sensitivity
 to the demands of the Gospel. Obviously, the
 Gospel gives us no blueprint for the precise
 forms of action to be taken amid the com-
 plexities of the modern world: that is why
 Christian pacifists and nonpacifists can sin-
 cerely differ.   Yet we have firm  common
 ground on which to stand In the Gospel's im-
 peratives on love and reconciliation, on re-
 spect for human life, and the need to relieve
 suffering wherever it is found, on the recog-
 nition that every person, whatever his race,
 nation, social status, or political coloration,
 is of Infinite worth to God and should be
 viewed as bound to us by ties of brother-
 hood.  These imperatives have been affirmed
 again and  again  by  great  representative
 bodies of churchmen.  Whether we are paci-
 fists or nonpacifists, supporters of the ad-
 ministration's foreign policy or dissenters,
 we ought to take them seriously.
 UNWARRANTED                                                                                                                                          INSENSITIVITY
 Yet what is happening to our inner atti-
 tudes?  The Vietcong                                                                                                                                         are  human beings,
 made in God's image like ourselves, perhaps
 less culturally advanced but as precious in
 God's sight as any American. When we hear
 a news report of 240 American boys killed
 in I week, we rightly wince. When we hear
 In the same report of 2.400 Vietcong killed,
 are we not inclined to rejoice as if something
 good had happened?    Do we think God re-
 joices?
 Insensitivity to the taking of human life
 when it is on the other side creeps up on
 us in every war.  We rationalize by saying
 that  thus  the end of the war is brought
 nearer.  Perhaps, and perhaps not.  In the
 present conflict the escalation of the war
 seems to have stiffened Hanoi's opposition
 to negotiation, as is likely to be, the case in
 any conflict when resources with which to go
 on fighting remain.  Be that as it may, for
 the Christian to view with composure and
 even with rejoicing the large-scale death of
 other human beings is an indication that
 somewhere along the way our Christian sen-
 sitivity has slipped.
 Another angle of insensitivity appears in
 the dulling of our reaction to the :;htiu{thl.ar
 of innocent noncombatants-old men and
 women, mothers and  their  babies, terrified
 villagers who may have been warned but who
 have no place to go when the napalm begins
 to fall.  It is to the credit of our soldiers
 that many of them, though trained in the
 stern realities  of war,  shrink  from  such
 slaughter.  If we have let our sensibilities
 be lulled to sleep, a look at such photo-
 graphs as those of "the blunt reality of war
 in Vietnam" in Life's November 26,      1965,
 issue should help to awaken us.
 Though new in form, this is the old ques-
 tion of the legitimacy of obliteration bomb-
 ing.  Those whose memories reach back to
 World War II may recall that the protest
 against the wholesale bombing of civilian
 populations issued by a small group of reli-
 gious leaders-there were only 28 of us-
 was generally greeted with opposition and
 derision.  But after the war was over the
 report of the commission appointed by the
 Federal Council of Churches on "The Rela-
 tion of the Church to the War in the Light
 of the Christian Faith" (often called the Cal-
 houn  Commission)   almost  unanimously
 condemned  the  practice  of obliteration
 bombing.  What the judgment of history will
 be on the conduct of the war in Vietnam
 remains an open question.

 'ebruary 3, 1966                        CONGRESSIONAL. RECORD - SENATE
 A  closely  related  issue  for  which  the
 hurches must be  concerned  if    they  are
 i remain Christian is the need for a vastly
 'celerated program of relief. The efforts
 our Government to care for refugees and
 )unded  villagers are commendable.      Yet
 ii view of the enormity of the problem and
 the continuing destruction they are inade-
 quate.  The longer the war continues the
 greater the need will become. Here is clearly
 something the churches can support-a sere-
 ice to which the Christian conscience can
 respond.
 More than 600,000 persons in South Viet-
 nam have fled from their homes to escape
 he violence from both sides.     And in the
 ,orth there are unknown numbers of vic-
 tims of our bombing, for while an attempt
 has been made to limit that bombing to
 military and other strategic targets, persons
 are inevitably  caught  in  the  destruction.
 To minister to  the  suffering,  whether in
 the south or north, both Church World Serv-
 ice and the American Friends Service Com-
 mittee are appealing for funds to carry on
 a  greatly increased    program  of  relief.
 Though many of us feel helpless in this
 crisis, helping relieve desperate human need
 is certainly one thing we can do.
 Let us look ahead a little.  We should wel-
 come our Government's offer to give economic
 aid to Vietnam and other countries of south-
 east Asia.  Will we be as willing when the
 war  finally terminates  with  all  Vietnam
 such a shambles that nothing but a long
 and very expensive program will rebuild it?
 National honor will hardly let us leave the
 area in that condition, yet one can anticipate
 the outcries at the expense involved, at its
 impingement on the cost of domestic pro-
 grams.   Christians must  then  Insist that
 if we can pour out vast sums  of money
 as well as human life to win the war in
 Vietnam,  we  must  be  as willing  to  ex-
 pend  our                 tax funds  to create  conditions
 for decent human living in the shattered
 area.
 THE RIGHT AND DUTY TO PROTEST
 'I Inust speak now of a more disputed issue.
 What about the demonstrations, marches,
 and other forms of protest against Govern-
 ment policy? Shall we defend them, or shall
 we oppose them as unpatriotic and as a
 means of  giving aid and comfort to the
 enemy while other young Americans suffer
 and die for us in Vietnam?  There is clearly
 no justification for dishonesty or for draft
 dodging.  The burning of a draft card is
 both a defiant and a futile form of protest.
 And though we may sympathize with the
 deep concern that has prompted self-immo-
 lation, we must agree that suicide is not the
 Christian answer.
 When conducted in an orderly manner
 demonstrations  are  within  the  American
 tradition of the right to free expression of
 opinion.  To forbid them is to stifle democ-
 racy at home under the guise of preserving
 it abroad.   Certainly they should be per-
 mitted when the safety and welfare of the
 public are not infringed upon.  Yet in most
 cases,    certainly  in  the  much  publicized
 Berkeley demonstrations, it is a very diverse
 group     that marches.   There are probably
 some Communists; there are committed paci-
 fists; there are many who for various reasons
 do not approve the Government's policy in
 Vietnam.  Some of these reasons are care-
 fully thought out and held with deep convic-
 tion;  others  appear  to  be  less  laudably
 grounded. It is impossible to form one com-
 mon judgment about all who participate.
 At present it is only those clergymen and
 pacifists who ask for exemption on religious
 grounds who are legally excused from mili-
 tary service.  Of late the question has arisen
 as to whether this provision should be ex-
 tended to cover those who conscientiously
 believe that all war-or one particular war-
 is unjust.   Again, some past history may
 help to answer the question.
 At the Oxford Conference on Life and
 Work in 1937 there was a clear condemna-
 tion of war as "a particular demonstration
 of the power of sin in this world and a defi-
 ance of the righteousness of God as revealed
 in Jesus Christ and him crucified."   Yet
 three  positions  were  stated  as conscien-
 tiously held by Christians:                                                                                absolute pac-
 ifism, the support of "just wars," and re-
 sponse to the call of the state unless one is
 absolutely certain that his country is fight-
 ing for a wrong cause (report, sec. V, 7).                                                                    By
 the time of the Amsterdam Conference of
 1948 the atomic age had intervened and the
 position had shifted somewhat to another
 triad: denial that modern war can be an act
 of justice, the duty of citizens to defend the
 law by force if necessary, and the Christian
 'pacifist position (report, sec. IV, 1).  In later
 assemblies of the World Council of Churches
 the matter was approached from other angles
 with less specific statements.
 In view of such affirmations by representa-
 tives of the world Christian community it
 would seem that there ought to be standing
 ground both in the law and in the attitudes
 of the local community for the person who
 protests against participation in a war which
 he  conscientiously  believes  to  be  unjust,
 Such a provision if enacted into law would
 doubtless impose problems for draft boards,
 but perhaps not more than in the case of
 Christian pacifists. Judgments would need
 to be made on the basis of the individual's
 wider spectrum of life and thought; min-
 isters might be called on to defend deserving
 persons and refuse support to others.  Yet I
 do not see on what other basis genuine free-
 dom of conscience can be preserved.
 A further service the churches can render
 is to educate their members, as objectively
 as possible, on the background of the pres-
 ent war.  The best brief statement in re-
 sponse to this obligation that I have seen
 was that in the Church Woman for Novem-
 ber 1965. It is true, of course, that there are
 ambiguous  elements  in  the  background
 which, because they are ambiguous, can be
 cited on either side of the issue.  For exam-
 ple, are all of the Vietcong Communists, as
 is commonly assumed?  The original Viet-
 minh, which became the Vietcong, was anti-
 French rather than pro-Communist.  Most
 of those now fighting against the South Viet-
 nam Government are peasant Lads innocent
 of ideology, yet there seems little doubt that
 their  leaders  are  Communist-trained, - re-
 sponsive to the bidding of Hanoi.
 Are we in Vietnam to honor the commit-
 ments of three Presidents?  There is no doubt
 about the Johnson  commitment, but the
 original Eisenhower offer of aid was condi-
 tional upon needed reforms and the estab-
 lishment of a strong government responsive
 to the people.   (President Eisenhower's let-
 ter of Oct. 23,  1954,  to Ngo Dinh  Diem,
 printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD Of July
 27, 1965, merits perusal (vol. III, No. 136).)
 Is our presence in Vietnam a violation of
 the Geneva accords of 1954?  By these agree-
 ments the Communists were to withdraw to
 the north and the French and non-Commu-
 nists to the south; both sides were to end
 hostilities and neither zone was to be used
 as a base for military activities;  elections
 were to be held within 2 years under an
 international control commission to deter-
 mine the nation's political future.  It is clear
 that North Vietnam has violated this agree-
 ment.                                                                    It is less well understood that the
 Geneva accords were  mainly between the
 French and the Vietminh and that both the
 non-Communist Vietnamese representatives
 at the conference and the United States re-
 fused to sign them.
 Such items do not per se settle the right-
 ness or wrongness of the present conflict.
 They do indicate that we ought to know the
 facts, including such nuances as these, and
 state them with as much light and as little
 heat as possible.
 I certainly claim no superior wisdom as to
 what should now be done, but the reader is
 entitled to know my position. -I do not ad-
 vocate immediate withdrawal, but neither
 do I think we should continue the present
 bombing and jungle warfare.  The most sen-
 sible solution I have seen is that advanced
 by Senator GEORGE MCGOVERN in an address
 to the Senate which appears in the CON-
 GRESSIONAL   RECORD  previously  mentioned.
 The gist of his suggestions is that we should
 continue to hold the cities and coast, which
 can be done without great destruction of life
 or property, stop the bombing and sit it out
 until an honorable peace can be negotiated.
 In the meantime effort should be made
 through the United Nations or other agencies
 to  bring  about a  ceasefire.   Negotiations
 which our Government has proposed, how-
 ever unconditional, are not likely to come
 about so long as bombing of North Vietnam
 continues-hence the hope inspired by the
 cessation at the beginning of the new year.
 The United States has sufficiently demon-
 strated that it is not a "paper tiger" and need
 not fear loss of prestige should the cessa-
 tion continue.  Negotiations when entered
 into should certainly include participation
 by representatives of the National Liberation
 Front in Vietnam.  Eventually there should
 be a phased withdrawal of all foreign troops
 except a United Nations or other interna-
 tional peacekeeping force.   And free elec-
 tions by which the people may determine
 their own political future should be pro-
 vided for.
 A further requirement, as suggested above,
 is that until economic self-subsistence and
 rebuilding are attained there must be both
 the promise and the actuality of massive eco-
 nomic aid, with the provision of hospitals,
 orphanages,  schools,  and  varied forms  of
 technical assistance.  If we make all this
 possible we will validate our claim that we
 are in South Vietnam to protect the people
 from aggression.   At the same time such
 response to human need will form the best
 insurance against the spread of communism.
 Finally, we should be praying for those
 who  suffer  in  this  deeply troubled  land,
 whether friend or enemy, whether Chris-
 tian, Buddhist, atheist-men, women, and
 children   with  stricken bodies  and   souls,
 caught in the grip of forces they did not
 create  and do not understand.   That, at
 least, any Christian can do if he shares some-
 what the love of God for every suffering one
 among his human children.
 TRIBUTE TO  OREN  HARRIS,  A
 FORMER REPRESENTATIVE FROM
 ARKANSAS,                 NOW   A  FEDERAL
 JUDGE
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, few
 Americans have the opportunity to serve
 their country in both the legislative and
 judicial branches of the Government.
 Few men have the chance to bring to the
 judiciary a quarter century of lawmak-
 ing experience, but such a man is Oren
 Harris, a close, personal friend of mine
 and the former Representative of the
 Fourth    Congressional   District    of
 Arkansas. He has been sworn in earlier
 today at El Dorado, Ark., as Federal
 judge for both the eastern and western
 districts of Arkansas, after having been
 nominated by President Johnson last
 year.
 Judge Harris resigned his seat in the
 House  of  Representatives  effective
 February 2, 1966, after 25 years' service
 in that body and after 9 years as chair-
 man of the House Interstate and Foreign
 Commerce Committee.

 1924                       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE         Febri  r?y
 Oren Harris was in Congress when I
 came as the Representative of the Third
 Congressional District of Arkansas in
 1942.  His service to Arkansas has been
 exceptional, his fairness as a committee
 chairman irreproachable, and his judg-
 ment wise and mature.   I have a very
 deep admiration for him and have en-
 joyed working in the Congress with hint
 these many years.   Arkansas will miss
 his services as a legislator, but his in-
 timate knowledge of the law will serve
 him in good stead and I am thankful
 that  the  new  judgeship  position.  in
 Arkansas has been filled by a man of his
 caliber.
 i,7r. President, I join the rest of the
 Arkansas delegation and his colleagues in
 the House in paying tribute to one of
 Arkansas' outstanding Representatives.
 My best wishes to both Judge Harris and
 his wife, Ruth, in their new life.
 ENROLLMENT IN PUBLIC ELEMEN.-
 TARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, because
 I know the basic statistics covering en-
 rollment, teachers and high school grad'-
 uatcs in full time public elementary and
 secondary day schools are of continuing
 interest to my colleagues and because
 these are the basic statistics which will
 be cited time and a@:ain in connection
 with education legislation in the second
 session, I feel it appropriate to set them
 forth at this point in my remarks for the
 reference of my colleagues.
 Mr. President, I as:i unaniltlous con-
 sent to have a news release dated Jan-
 uary 16, 1966, from the Office of Educa-
 tion of the U.S. Department of Health,
 Education and WeI:fcre, together with
 the accompanying tables, printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the, news re-
 lease was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 U.S. I)EPARTMEN'r OF HEALTH, I eU-
 CAT.ON, AND WELFARE, OF'rI(9 OF
 EDL CAUTON,
 Washington D.C., Januar; 16, 1966.
 Enrollments in public elementary and sec-
 ondary schools this fall rose to 4'.1 million,
 an increase of 721,0037 or 1.8 percent over last
 yo"r, the U.S. Office of Education announced
 today.
 The 12th annual fall survey, conducted in
 cooperation with State eepartmelas of edu-
 cation, also shows:
 Lnrollrncis s  are  coal inuing  to  increase
 mare rapidly in secondary schools than in
 elementary schools.  The elementary school
 enrollment of 26.4 million is up 194,000, or
 0.7 percent    above  a year ago.     Secondary
 school enrollments rose 533.000 to 15.7 mil-
 lion, a gain of 3.5 percent.
 The estimated average annual expenditc_
 per pupil  in average  daily  attendance  is
 1965- 66 is $532.  Based on average daily men,
 bership-counting students both present alt
 absent-the estimated   average  annual
 penditure is $503.
 The survey also :.bowed:
 Approximately   1,716,000   full-time  and
 part-time public schoolteachers, an increase
 of 68,100, or 4.1 percent over 1964.
 The estimated average annual salary of all
 instructional personnel, including principal,,
 teachers, librarians, and others is $6,700 in
 1965-66.   The  average  annual  salary  foi
 classroom teachers Is $6,500.
 About 81,700 full-time public schoolteach
 ers-4.8 percent of the total-{lo not    mor,
 State certification standards.   The propor-
 tion of teachers with less than standard cer-
 tificates has been declining slowly in recent
 years.
 Total expenditures for public, schools in
 the current school year will amount to allot t
 $25.8 billion.
 In the 1964-65 school year, 16,400 class-
 rooms were abandoned because of school or
 school  district  consolidations,  populatioa
 shifts, destruction of buildings. and other
 factors. The completion of 65,200 classrooms
 during the same period brought the number
 of classrooms currently in use to 1,595,000.
 (NOTE To EDITORS.-Further details, giving
 current year figures by region and State  s
 well as national totals for a 5-year period are
 contained in the attached tables.)

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         February 3, 1966
 $43  million.  Even  in  the  Portland,
 Maine, area, the cost has been estimated
 at more than $20 million.
 For the last decade, Federal construc-
 tion grants have stimulated local abate-
 ment and control projects.                         Municipal
 response to the grants was immediate
 and encouraging even at its initial
 modest and totally inadequate level.
 However, Lecause of the grant limits,
 the resulting activity has barely kept
 pace with the needs of growing popula-
 tions and urbanization. The tremendous
 backlog of needed facilities, now totaling
 at least $20 billion, remains unmet. The
 lifting of ceilings and the stepping up
 of authorizations, as recommended by
 the subcommittee, would permit and
 stimulate the necessary attack on the
 backlog.
 Since the national pollution abatement
 program began in 1948, the basic legisla-
 tive policy has been that the control of
 pollution is a State responsibility.  Re-
 grettably, most States have failed to help
 communities meet the costs of abatement
 and control.  Presently, only six States
 have authority to apply State funds for
 this purpose.
 Our job, then, is to provide more In-
 centive to the States.                         A 10 percent Fed-
 eral bonus for State matching funds, and
 the opportunity for doubled Federal ap-
 propriations for program support will
 stimulate State participation.
 A challenge to our technology is the
 development of  efficient  methods  of
 treating combined municipal and indus-
 trial effluent. An appropriation of $125
 million over 5 years would foster the
 depth of research needed to find and
 demonstrate the answers.   In the long
 run, these answers would save countless
 dollars and help us achieve the water
 quality we will need.
 Industry, like municipalities, will in-
 creasingly feel the financial burden of
 treatment. In many instances, this bur-
 den can adversely affect an industry's
 growth and prosperity.  Many companies
 already face this problem..  It calls for
 a reevaluation of our policy on financial
 assistance to industry for treatment
 works.
 Summing up, there are three basic ele-
 ments                 in  the Federal  Government's
 water pollution control effort: treat-
 ment, enforcement, and research.
 The Water Quality Act of 1965 gave us
 the means for developing and establish-
 ing meaningful water quality standards.
 But if communities do not have the
 resources to achieve adequate treatment,
 standards and enforcement will mean
 little.
 And without research to find more
 efficient methods of treatment, the costs
 could overwhelm us in the decades
 ahead.
 Our next legislative attack on dirty
 water should begin where the Water
 Quality Act left off. The subcommittee's
 recommendations are guidelines for our
 work in the months ahead.
 I urge my colleagues to read the sub-
 committee's report.
 JOB CORPS GIRLS START TO WORK
 Mr. MONTOYA.  Mr. President, I am
 pleased to bring to the attention of the
 Senate an article about a young lady
 from my State who is a recent graduate
 of the Los Angeles Women's Job Corps
 Training Center.
 The story was written by Mrs. Eliza-
 beth Shelton, staff writer for the Wash-
 ington Post.  The story is about Juana
 Marie Waquiu of Jemez Pueblo, N. Mex.
 It is of paramount importance that in-
 dustry scrutinize the graduates of the
 Job Corps for potential job placement.
 This point of view i  well expressed by
 W. C. Hobbs, senioi vice-president of
 Consolidated American Services, Inc.,
 and chief executive of its Management
 and Engineering Services Division. This
 company was the first to hire male Job
 Corps graduates and now blazes a new
 trail by being the first in private industry
 to hire female graduates of the Job
 Corps.
 Mr. Hobbs feels certain of the abilities
 of the Job Corps graduates.  His quota-
 tion is worth repeating:
 I feel very strongly that In the Job Corps,
 industry has a natural young mine of flex-
 ibility and a pool of labor.                                                                                      Just because
 these are poor kids who have dropped out
 of school doesn't mean they are not good
 workers.  Once industry realizes they have
 a pool, and can direct the skills and techni-
 cal training they need, they are going to
 come to Job Corps and say, "I need so many
 of this type of skill."
 This is an inspiring and impressive
 story. It should be of interest-of great
 interest--to all Americans.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the article, written by Elizabeth
 Shelton, be printed in the RECORD at this
 point of my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 JOBS CORPS GIRLS START TO WORK
 (By Elizabeth Shelton)
 The first two career girls to come to the
 Capital with Job Corps diplomas as their
 credentials are happly at work in the down-
 town  office  of  a  management  consultant
 firm.
 Juana Marie Waquiu, a 21-year-old from
 Jemez Pueblo, N. Mex., arrived here yester-
 day to double as a PBX switchboard opera-
 tor and receptionist with the Management
 and Engineering Services Division of Con-
 solidated American Services, Inc.  She was
 the  first  graduate  of  the  Los Angeles
 Women's Job Corps Training Center.
 The second graduate, Willye L. Evans, 20,
 of Oklahoma City, Okla., has been on duty
 in the same office for a week as a, clerk-
 typist.  "It's just like home," Willye says.
 "Everybody is so friendly."
 Both live on Buchanan Street NE., with
 the family of a member of the MES staff.
 Neither has had a chance yet to sightsee
 around the city, but Willye went on a motor
 trip in Maryland on Sunday and thought it
 "very nice."
 Her mother is a domestib worker in Idabel,
 Okla.  Willye tried working her way through
 Langston University in Oklahoma but had
 to leave in her second year because her sal-
 ary as an assistant to the adviser of the New
 Homemakers of America was applied only to
 tuition and left her no money for expenses
 or to send home.
 She plans to go to business college at night
 with an eventual goal of teaching business
 subjects.  She  attended  the  Metropolitan
 Junior College in Los Angeles and graduated
 in 5 months.
 Juana, daughter of a carpenter, attended
 Albuquerque Business College, in New Mex-
 ico, for a year, but couldn't find a job in that
 city.  She learned switchboard operation at
 the Los  Angeles  Trade  Technical  College
 while enrolled at the Los Angeles Job Corps
 Center.
 Back at home are five brothers and two
 sisters. The older sister is married and the
 oldest of her brothers helps his father, but
 the others are still of school age and Juana
 helps to support them.
 The brand new white-collar girls make $2
 an hour at their new jobs.  They will re-
 ceive in-grade promotions and the chance
 to rise, through training, to new grades.
 W. C. Hobbs, senior vice president of Con-
 Am and executive chief of its MES division,
 Is confident the Job Corps is producing a
 competent employment pool for industry.
 The organization  was  the  first  to  hire
 male Job Corps graduates as employees and
 found their work so satisfactory that two are
 being given additional pay and responsibili-
 ties.  The third was assisted to return to
 high school so he will have a base for higher
 education.
 One of the reasons that Hobbs feels so
 assured is  that  the  24-hour-a-day  living
 experience at a Job Corps center gets every-
 thing  about  the  enrollee's  abilities                                                                                                                                             and
 habits down on the record.
 "This provides a great deal more Informa-
 tion than a series of interviews, or even a
 job trial," he said.
 "I  feel  very  strongly  that  in  the  Job
 Corps, industry has a natural young mine
 of flexibility and a pool of labor," he said.
 "Just because these are poor kids who have
 dropped out of school doesn't mean they are
 not good workers.
 "Once industry realizes they have a pool
 and can direct the skills and technical train-
 ing they need, they are going to come to
 Job Corps, and say, 'I need so many of this

 NORTH VIETNAM
 Mr.  DODD. Mr. President, in this
 mornings New York Times there are two
 items which, on the surface, appear to
 contradict each other.
 On page 16 of the New York Times
 there is an article headed "Senate Mail
 Hits War Escalation." According to this
 article, the mail in most Senate offices
 is running 2 or 3 to 1 against escalation
 or a resumption of bombing, and in some
 Senate offices the ratio is running as high
 as 100 to 1.
 On the other hand, an article on page
 1 of the New York Times reported that
 there is wide national support for the
 President's decision to resume bombing
 of North Vietnam.  The article, which
 ran more than 1 page in length, was
 based on the reports of 10 staff corre-
 spondents who interviewed State and
 local officials, professional and business
 men, editors, students, and others.
 The remarkable discrepancy between
 the true state of American public opinion
 and the heavily weighted public opinion
 estimates gleaned from congressional
 correspondence can, I believe, be ex-
 plained in very simple terms.
 The great majority of the American
 public who support the President's policy
 are unorganized and do not consider it

 dumber of banks have made such adjust-
 meats, and there have been numerous re-
 posts of rates on certificates of 5 percent,
 ;tad, in a few instances, as high as 51 per-
 cent.   This has renewed concern that the
 ;enrarnble for deposits might carry the going
 r:itr, among the large as well as the small
 banks to the regulatory ceiling, despite the
 attempts to avoid making this ceiling into a
 niagnet for going rates.
 't new rash of savings instruments based
 in  certificates  of  deposit  has  developed
 amotig many banks.      These are being called
 savings certificates, savings bonds, invest-
 ment deposits, or ot'kcr special names and
 an being offered at rates as high as 5 per-
 and guaranteed for periods as long as
 tin-ee years.  The minimum amounts being
 accepted are often $1,000 and, in some cases,
 as low as $25.   The common denominator
 on many of these new instruments is the
 ":act; that they provide for many depositors
 a :-eac?y alternative to passbook savings on
 which a maximum 4-percent rate has been
 retained under regulation Q.   There have
 been  reports  of unsettling and disruptive
 :;hefts  of funds  among  banks, and  from
 :savings  and  loan associations  to banks.
 Whether such shifts are indeed taking place
 in large amounts is of critical significance
 to the financial system and of great impor-
 tance to the economy.  The Federal Reserve
 =snthorities looked into this matter a few
 weeks ago and concluded that reports of
 eli:auptive shifts were somewhat exaggerated,
 ;et least at that time.
 Gat this is not the complete story.  Even
 lbaugh a rate war among banks and other
 liranciai institutions, may not yet have de-
 veloped,  the  pressure  resulting  from             the
 rising demand for credit is tempting some
 bankers--including a few in the large money
 market banks-to oiler unrealistically gen-
 erous terms on CDs.   There is a clear and
 present danger that such actions could lead
 l,o highly destructive and undesirable com-
 petition from which no one-banks, savers,
 other financial institutions, or the American
 ec nnomy-could gain.
 tuck a fierce competitive race for savings
 7.m1 time money could he particularly harm-
 iIul. to the small banks of the Nation and the
 regional  and  local  economies  which  they
 r;e ve.   Healthy competition  among banks
 and other lenders is highly desirable.  How-
 ever, competition that entices large and dis-
 rnpt.ive flows of funds from country to city.
 arum small banks to large banks, and from
 the specialized financial industries into the
 ;ranking system can be harmful.
 I therefore urge the Nation's commercial
 bankers to exercise the prudence and re-
 ;porisibilit:y that will be absolutely necessary
 in the days and months ahead.  There is no
 :nrgic. formula.  Nor will the pressures be
 cuitiorin throughout;  the  banking  system.
 rut it is appropriate that we remind our-
 that the most successful banks, over
 extended periods of time, have been those
 i:,nks that have been able to strike a healthy
 b;.lance between the need for stability and
 %.1   aced for growth.
 In  reviewing bank policies, several ques-
 ,inus should be answered objectively.  Does
 I,ho local demand for credit warrant the com-
 peGitive               quest for deposits?   Is the bank
 ;eitempting to grow just  for the sake of
 growth?  Will credit standards have to be
 iewered to put the expensive money to work
 ii. raises that will be profitable?  How stable
 no the deposits?  Will these shift quickly
 wi.i,.h any rate change by competitors? How
 long     will the bank be able to sustain the
 h glier rates?
 '['hiis we must understand:  a significant
 recur;  of  the  Federal  Reserve  action has
 been to grant; new freedom to the banking
 With the prime rate at 41,, percent,
 franks had become a "bargain basement" for
 b ,rrowers in relation to prevailing rates in
 the bond market.     The effect was to maintain
 an unrealistic prime rate level which gave
 a subsidy to bank borrowers and threatened
 to exhaust bank lending capacity .   The
 increase in the discount rate, ar.d related
 rise in the prime rate, has giver.- banks a
 new freedom to charge rates on loans tha
 are more in line with the open market.
 In a full employment economy, demand;
 for credit can become almost insatiable.  The
 problem for many credit institutions is to
 control the integrity of their own portfolios
 through the selection or rejection o;: the loan,;
 offered.  Thus the Federal Reserve action on
 the  rate front dramatized the credit situa-
 tion that had been developing and help to
 improve our ability to build heathy loaf.
 portfolios.
 The matter now rests essenotalhr with the
 bankers  in  their response  to this rapidlee
 changing environment.   We cannot expect:
 to be monitored daily by the Federal Re-
 serve  :Board.   We  have                                                                  been told  plaint,.,
 that credit must be restrained.   We have
 been told plainly that banks must not in-
 dulge  in  competitive  rate  wars                                                                   for   time
 money.
 If the Federal Reserve policy is to be effec-
 tive, self-discipline on the part of banks
 now absolutely required.  Any other course.
 of action would be unthinkable simply be-
 cause the national interest demands it. Fail-
 ure to exercise voluntary but  prudent re-
 straint, now can only lead to stricter regula
 tory controls later.
 Indeed,  the  very  manner in 'athich the
 Federal Reserve has raised the 11 eg of cau-
 tion is indicative of its confidence in the
 integrity and responsibility of the American
 banking system, and this we must honor.
 STEPS TOWARD CLEAN WATER
 Mr.  MUSKIE.  Mr.        President,  the
 Water Quality Act of 1965 is a meaning-
 ful document.  But it does not complete
 the responsibility  of Congress  in the
 critical area of water polluticii control
 and abatement.
 The Water Quality Act gave the Na-
 tion  the  basic                                                            tools  to  enhance  the
 quality of our water resources.  To put
 those tools to work, we need the musce
 of greatly increased Federal, State, and
 local money behind them.
 The Senate Subcommittee on Air and
 Water Pollution has recently published
 a report which documents this need.
 The report is entitled "Steps Toward
 Clean. Water," and is based on 12 days
 of hearings last year.  More than 900
 pages of testimony and supporting evi-
 dence were recorded,
 The findings and recommendations of
 the l'eport are a sobering evaluation of
 the problem and the need to solve it.
 The subcommittee estimate:, that the
 national cost of meeting our treatment
 plant construction needs by 1972 is  tiL
 least $20 billion.  The present Feder.il
 effort is only $150 million a year.  The
 subcommittee reports this "is entirely
 inadequate even to keep pace with ti e
 problem."
 Furthermore, present restrictions on
 individual grants gravely limit the prix
 grans, especially in large coranrunities.
 While these may be the most obvious
 deficiencies in our program, they are not
 the only ones.
 For instance, the overwhelming ma-
 jority of States does not assist cornmun i-
 ties with matching grants tinder the
 sewage  treatment  construct:on  grant
 program.
 Except in isolated cases, we do not have
 a coordinated program for handling
 effluent from industrial and municipal
 sources in river basins.  The increased
 cost of waste treatment for industries is
 a threat to their economic vitality.
 Finally, present waste treatment sys-
 tems too frequently are based on con-
 cepts developed 40 years ago.
 Because  of  the  interrelationship  of
 these needs, no one part can be ignored
 without jeopardizing our success with the
 others.
 During the coast-to-coast hearings last
 year, the subcommittee learned firsthand
 of the nature and scope of these inade-
 quacies.  To succeed, the subcommttee
 has made six recommendations.  We
 should consider them carefully.
 First. Do away with the dollar ceiling
 limits on treatment construction grants,
 and instead provide a 30-percent grant
 for each project, regardless of its cost.
 Second. Provide a bonus of 10 per-
 cent of the Fcderal grant when the State
 matches at least 30 :percent of the project
 cost.  In addition, cities should be au-
 thorized to apply directly for Federal.
 grants when States fail to match the
 Federal grant.  A revolving fund should.
 be established for long-term, low-interest;
 loans to help cities meet local matching
 requirements when the State fails to
 match the Federal share.
 Third. Authorize $6 billion for Fed-
 eral  treatment  construction  grants
 through fiscal year 1972.
 Fourth. Double the authorization for
 grants to States and interstate agencies
 for program support to $10 million a year
 for 5 years, providing the States increase
 their share.
 Fifth. Authorize $25 million annually
 for 5 years for research, development and
 demonstration of advanced waste treat-
 ment and purification methods, and for
 development and demonstration of new
 or improved methods for treating com-?
 patible municipal and industrial wastes.
 Sixth. Provide for collection and pub.-
 l.ication  of  information on  treatment
 practices in industrial, manufacturing
 and processing establishments.  Use the
 contract authority more extensively in
 the conduct of research, training and
 demonstrations.  In   connection with
 such authority, start a program of train-
 ing operators of municipal and indus-
 trial or other private treatment plants.
 These six recommendations are a, bold
 but necessary program to meet the reali-
 ties of the water pollution crisis.
 By eliminating the dollar ceiling on
 individual project grants, we could brine;
 meaningful support and encouragement
 to the Nation's cities.  Their problems
 are at the heart of the national problem.
 Presently, the maximum Federal grant
 to a single project is $1.2 million and the
 maximum for a joint project undertaken
 by two or more communities is $4.8 mil-
 lion.
 For major cities, these amounts are
 woefully  inadequate.  New  York  City
 alone faces the expenditure of $780 mil-
 lion for needed facilities.
 In Atlanta, the price tag is $100 mil-
 lion.                                                                                                          In Los Angeles, it is $75 million.
 In Detroit, it is $1.51 million. In Pitts-
 burgh, it is $32 million.  In Houston, it is

 necessary to manifest their support by
 repeated letters and telegrams addressed
 to the President and to their Congress-
 men.
 But the relatively small minority who
 are opposed to the President's policy are
 highly organized, and the several major
 organizations which have been playing a
 leading role in the anti-Vietnam agita-
 tion repeatedly remind their followers
 and correspondents of their duty to write
 and to wire-not once, but repeatedly-
 to the President and to Congressmen.
 For example, yesterday a constituent
 sent me a printed card which he had
 received from the National Committee
 for a Sane Nuclear Policy.  The card
 urged the recipient to wire the President
 and wire his Senator and Congressman
 protesting against the resumed bombing
 of the North-and if he had already done
 so once, the card urged the recipient to
 3o so again.
 I have been advised that similar com-
 munications have been sent out by the
 Students for a Democratic Society, by
 the National Emergency Committee To
 End the War in Vietnam and by other
 organizations involved in the anti-Viet-
 nam agitation.
 I would -therefore urge my colleagues
 to take these facts into consideration in
 evaluating the correspondence they re-
 ceive on the Vietnam war.
 A much surer gage of the state of
 public opinion than the highly organized
 correspondence which has been deluging
 our offices is the repeated public opinion
 polls demonstrating overwhelming sup-
 port for the President's policy.
 For example, the same New York Times
 from which I have quoted points out
 that:
 A nationwide poll by Louis Harris before
 the end of the pause reported that 61 percent
 favored and 17 percent opposed all-out bomb-
 ing of every part of North Vietnam if the
 Communists refused to sit down and talk
 peace.
 Remarkably enough, there was very
 little difference in opinion on this point
 between those who had voted the Gold-
 water ticket in 1964 and those who had
 voted the Democratic ticket.
 Of those who had supported Goldwater,
 65 percent favored all-out U.S. bombing
 if the Communists refused to talk peace,
 and 14 percent were opposed.
 Of those who had voted Democratic, 59
 percent supported all-out bombing and
 only 17 percent were opposed.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to insert into the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD at this point the following three
 items:
 First. The article, captioned "Senate
 Mail Hits War Escalation," which ap-
 peared on page 16 of the New York
 Times, today, Thursday, February 3.
 Second. The article, captioned "Wide
 Support Found in Nation for Renewed

 same date.
 Third.  The Harris survey, captioned
 "Public Would Back More Troops, Bomb-
 ing if Negotiation Move Fails," the full
 text of which appeared on page 2 of the

 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SENATE MAIL HITS WAR ESCALATION-OPPOSI-
 TION LED BY MIDWEST AND MOUNTAIN STATES
 (By E. W. Kenworthy)
 WASHINGTON, February 2.-Many Senators
 reported today that their mail was heavily
 against escalation of the war in Vietnam.
 A sampling of Senate offices indicated that
 the strongest opposition, as reflected in mail
 and  telegrams,  was  in  the  Midwest  and
 Mountain States.
 However, Senators from the eastern sea-
 board reported that their mail also was "sub-
 stantially" or "predominantly" against esca-
 lation.
 In the House, most Members interviewed
 said their mail on Vietnam was light.  The
 reason, they believed, is that constituents are
 more likely to write their Senators on foreign
 affairs issues.  The Senate alone has the con-
 stitutional authority to advise and consent
 on treaties and has therefore become the
 dominant legislative body on foreign policy
 questions.
 A White House spokesman said no tabula-
 tion was being made on its mail concerning
 Vietnam.
 Most of the Senators interviewed said the
 mail gave little appearance of being orga-
 nized.
 As might be expected, those Senators who
 have been critical of the administration's
 policy for some time or who were among the
 15 that wrote to the President last week
 urging a continuation of the pause in the
 bombing  of  North  Vietnam  reported  the
 largest percentage of mail against escalation.
 For example, Senator MIKE MANSFIELD, of
 Montana, the Democratic leader, is receiving
 mail and telegrams from all over the country
 that is more than '100 to 1 against escalation.
 EDWARD KENNEDY REPORTS
 Senator  GAYLORD  NELSON,  Democrat,  of
 Wisconsin,                  who  signed the letter  to the
 President, said his mail had been 10 to 1
 against stepping up the war.
 But the office of Senator EDWARD M. KEN-
 NEDY, Democrat, of Massachusetts, who did
 not sign the letter, said he had been receiving
 80 to 100 letters a day and that the trend
 was "substantially" in opposition to escala-
 tion.
 Several Senators said the heavy mail began
 during the last 2 weeks of the bombing pause,
 a large proportion of which urged a continua-
 tion of the lull,  The Senators said, however,
 that there had been no decline since the
 President's decision last Monday to resume
 bombing.
 In fact, some Senators have experienced
 an increase.   Senator EUGENE J. MCCARTHY,
 Democrat, of Minnesota, who made a speech
 Monday urging the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee to undertake a critical review of
 Vietnam policy, received 450 telegrams yes-
 terday supporting his position and one dis-
 senting phone call.
 However,          Senator  WALTER  F.  MONDALE,
 Democrat,  of Minnesota,  who,  unlike Mr.
 MCCARTHY,  did not sign the letter to the
 President or speak out against resumption of
 the bombing, reported that he was getting
 about 150 letters and telegrams a week. He
 said the telegrams were running 6 or 7 to 1
 and the letters 2 or 3 to 1 against escalation.
 In a private poll taken for the adminis-
 tration in Minnesota just before Christmas
 and the beginning of the bombing pause,
 21 percent of those asked wanted "the United
 States to go all out for victory in Vietnam
 even it It means war with the Chinese";
 29 percent believed "the United States should
 bomb Hanoi and any other targets that will
 increase U.S. effectiveness," and 27 percent
 thought "the United States should continue
 the present policy" of limited  bombing.
 Only 9 perecn.t thought "the United States
 should stop bombing North Vietnam, even
 if it decreases U.S. effectiveness."
 POLLS FAVOR BOMBING
 A nationwide poll by Louis Harris before
 the end of the pause reported that 61 per-
 cent favored and 17 percent opposed all-out
 bombing of every part of North Vietnam "if
 the Communists refused to sit down and
 talk peace."
 The  Minnesota  and  Harris  polls  would
 seem to indicate that a large majority of
 those who  do  not  write  letters to their
 Senators are "hard-liners."
 The White House places much more reli-
 ance on polls than on mail.                                                                                                                               Shortly before
 he ordered the pause,  the President  was
 impressed by a poll showing 73 percent of
 the country in favor of the pause.
 WIDE SUPPORT FOUND IN NATION FOR
 RENEWED VIETNAM BOMBING
 A spot check of the New York Times indi-
 cates widespread support in the nation for
 President Johnson's decision to resume the
 bombing of North Vietnam.
 Mixed with this support, however, is fear
 of a possible nuclear conflict and confusion
 over U.S. strategy.
 Opinion across the nation appeared to be
 in general agreement, with the exception of
 the South.  There the view that the United
 States should press the war harder seemed
 to predominate.
 The prevailing national mood was sum-
 med up by a Methodist minister in Madison,
 Wis.
 "I think the people as a whole support
 the  resumption  of bombing,  but with  a
 troubled conscience," he said. "Most of the
 people feel a loyalty to the Government and
 support for the elected officials that require
 them to rely on their judgments.   But I
 feel more people are sicker of war now than
 at any time in our history."
 Ten   staff   correspondents   interviewed
 state  and  local  officials,  professional and
 business men, editors, students and others
 on opinion in their communities.  The re-
 sults reflect a broad trend, though they do
 not purport to be scientific.
 Many of those questioned seemed to feel
 that while the President had all the facts
 and probably knew what was best, there still
 was the "nagging possibility," as one Cali-
 fornian put it, "that perhaps, just perhaps,
 the minority is correct after all."
 "It's hard to fit all these different ele-
 ments together so they make sense," a Michi-
 gan university president said.  "The loyal
 citizen has a little sense of distress and un-
 easiness  because  it  doesn't  quite  come
 clear cut."
 For some, anxiety over nuclear war has
 become intense. The wife of a New Mexico
 scientist called for disengagement in Viet-
 nam no matter what the cost. "I'd rather
 be Red than dead," she said.
 The feeling of militancy in the South was
 generally attributed to the region's long-
 standing tradition of military distinction,
 as well as to the large number of troops
 stationed there.
 But one Mississippian explained it in part
 as a reaction to frustration over civil rights
 advances.  "They don't see much that they
 can do to stop civil rights activity," he said,
 "so this seems to make them want to stop
 the Communists just that much more."
 An indication that some segments of the
 public  may be  poorly informed  on  Viet-
 nam emerged from a recent poll of under-
 graduates at a college in Pittsburgh.                                                                                                                                    Half
 of the students, many of whom may soon be
 drafted, could not answer such basic ques-
 tions as "who is Ho Chi Minh" and "where
 is Dienbienphu."
 One Texas news dealer found, however,
 that interest in the war had picked up late-

 ( i-y Gladwin Hill)
 I.,irs   ANGELES,   February  2.-"Confusion"
 and "perplexity" are two word:; that crop ma
 repeatedly in any sounding of public senti-
 ment on the Vietnam situation in this area.
 There is no doubt among well placed oh-
 s, rvers of collective opinion--political lead-
 er:;, busineocmen, professional people, educa-
 tors, clergymen, editors-about why people
 are confused.
 "It's because they sense that the admin-
 istration is confused," one said.  "President
 .iohnson and Secretary Rusk have kept re-
 iterating the ultimate goal of our Vietnam
 involvement,: to stop communism.  No bod?
 can  challei -,e that.  But there's a vast gap
 between that goal and the inconclusive mili-
 tnry operations we see from clay to day.                       The
 necessary  connection  between  the two  is
 obscure, questionable.  That  gap is  where
 people are tioundering-along with the ad-
 in i ni- tration."
 "if President Johnson had said we'll es-
 calate and smash through to victory at what-
 ever cost, it would have been accepted by the
 average citizen," said Julius Leetha.m, who
 as county chairman heads the largest bloc
 of Republicans in California.
 "The fact that there have been apparent
 misgivings  in  the  Democratic  leadership
 about whether we should be in there at all
 has pushed the average citizen into intellec-
 tual perplexity."
 Poll of Students
 A recent poll of students at the University
 of California, Los Angeles, on proper course
 in Vietnam yielded these responses:
 for pursuance of present operations, 2,164.
 For  "escalation,"  even  into  Communist
 China, 498.
 For immediate withdrawal, 553.
 For stopping bombing In hopes of peace,
 763,
 For withdrawal to a "neutral" position,
 690.
 While most of the respondants in this poll
 presumably were not of voting age, the shad-
 ing of sentiment encountered in a canvass
 of adult opinion leaders suggested that feel..
 logs generally In the Pacific Southwest might
 divide in about the same ratio.
 Opinion nas not yet generally crystalized
 into aggressive points of view.  But incfica-
 Lions are that it would not take many radical
 developments, either favorable or adverse, to
 polarize it.
 "People are supporting the President on
 Vietnam--and at this juncture they'd sup-
 port him if he chose to withdraw," said Philip
 Kerby, editor of the liberal magazine Frontier.
 "Opinion Is becoming more definite on both
 sides of the question-mostly, I think, be.-
 cause of the growing intensity of public dis-
 cussion," commented Leonard Mandel, a shoe
 manufacturer.
 The Surface Facts
 The consensus is that the public is well in-
 -formed about the surface facts of the Viet-
 nam situation, but hazy about the rationale
 and the administration's approach to it.
 "People generally just don't know the rea. ?
 son for our Vietnam involvement," said D:r.
 Neil  Jacoby,  dean of the  UCLA  Business
 School.
 "1 think there is understanding that our
 aim is to prevent the spread of communism,"
 said Dr. Robert G. Neumann, UCLA political
 science professor.  "But things come out, like
 the Fanfanl peace overture that give even. the
 President's strong supporters the feeling that
 things are not being told."
 The persistance of uncertainty about the
 Nation's course seems to be bringing closer a,
 critical juncture In public opinion.
 "It's now become a question of get out or
 get; tougher," comnien.t-d Conrad Jamison,
 a vice president of one California"s largest
 banks.   "We're doing nothing decisive.   If
 nothing decisive continues to be done, dis-
 satisfaction will grow."
 Reflecting this trend, a. prominent; Beverly
 Hills dentist, Dr. Fern Petty, the normally
 jovial former president cf Optimis.ts Interna-
 tional declared impatiently: "I"rrt sick and
 tired of our kissing everybody's foot.   We
 ought to go in there as d blast the hell out
 of Hanoi.  We're seeking peace, and that's
 the quickest way to ge, it.  Were actually

 power-and it can't, even hold 1-outh Viet-
 nam.' "
 Heads a Larf;e Temple
 More mildly, but no less pointedly, Rabbi
 Edgar  Magnin  of  the  Wilshire  Boulevard
 Temple, one of the world's largest Jewish con-
 gregations, commented:
 "I get around a lot anJ I havent met any-
 body who liked this venture-Jew. Christian,
 Chinaman or atheist. I don't think anybody
 with half a brain wants to be in this thing,
 because it can't solve anything.  If we did
 will militarily, 6 months later there'd be an-
 other government in there.  But 4f its going
 to be a war, it should be an all-cut war.  If
 it Isn't, we ought to get out."
 Simon Cassidy, a newspaper publisher and
 president of the California Democratic Coun-
 cil, a. liberal rank-and file party organization,
 commented:
 "The kind of people I talk to-mostly peo-
 ple                                                                             in  the  CDC-are  disappointed to  see
 the  bombing  resume. Right  now  they're
 willing to take the President's appraisal as
 long as they don't see it lot of coffins coming
 back, or it isn't costing too much money, or
 there isn't any rationing,  But an the going
 gets tougher, people's questions  Will get
 tougher.  They're going to ask:  'What the
 hell are we doing over there?-What can
 bloodying up some junk le do to defend our
 freedom?'"
 -here is little evidence that opinion on
 Vietnam follows economic or class lines.  The
 dominant considerations, cross-sectional in
 nature, are such things as the draft and,
 subtly, the national economy.
 Mrs. Robert Neumann, a member of the
 McCone Commission that investigated the
 Watts riots, said, "I have gotten a feeling
 that really disadvantaged people don't think
 much about internatio:Ial affairs-but that's
 just an impression.    But you do get other
 divisions of opinion.  In my United Nations
 group,  which  is  principally  middle  class,
 there are idealists who believe the war Is
 dreadful  and  should  be stoppers     immedi-
 ately-but there are those who think It's
 necessary."
 Resignation in North.we!.t
 (By Lawrence It. Davies;
 SAN  Fxsnossco,  February 2.--Iteep-seated
 regret that bombing of North Vietnam was
 renewed has gripped the Pacific and border-
 ing States.  But the mcod of a substantial
 majority, as suggested by inquiries in a cross-
 section of opinion leaders, is one of resigna-
 tion to the belief that perhaps there was no
 practicable alternative.
 Even among the clergy where the bombing
 renewal was widely dep.ored, some in high
 places subscribed to this belief.  And some
 of the  "noisy minority"  of  opponents  of
 bombing, on and off college campuses, ac-
 knowledged that they were outnumbered by
 supporters of President Johnson's action.
 Repeatedly,  in  northern  California, the
 Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and neighboring
 States, questioners met substantially with
 this :reply:
 "I find a lot of people, :probably a majority,
 saying the President ana his advisers have
 the information and we have to trust them
 to make the decisions."
 Coupled with this were similar predictions
 from a prominent San Francisco business-
 man and civic leader, a Democrat:
 "As surtaxes and other taxes are added to
 support the war In Vietnam there will be
 an increasing demand from voters that we
 pull out.  People are selfish; when their oan
 pocketbooks are affected it makes a differ-
 ence."
 A California State senator, also a Democrat,
 saw  a change in mood as already taking
 place, away from one guided partly by eco-
 nomic status.  The country club set he sail,
 originally demanded, "Go in and knock hell
 out of them (the North Vietnamese)."
 "Now," he said, "as their kids in college
 are being reclassified, they are beginning to
 say, 'maybe we ought to try harder to got
 to the negotiating table.'  But what do you
 do if the other side vron't negotiate?"
 In Alaska where the general re.ction was
 "the President had no choice," and where
 Gov. William A. Egan, a Democrat, said "if
 principles mean anything, then we must fol-
 low through," Robert J. McNealy, senate pres-
 ident, a Democrat, thought that, President
 Johnson  should   "order   nuclear   bombs
 dropped on both Hanoi and Peiping."
 "By such. action," he said, "the lives of
 many thousands of American boys could be
 saved  and  this country  entrenched  as  a
 world power for peace during the next f-0
 years."
 And illustrating a point widely made th,.t
 personal involvement often dictates the at-
 titude toward bombing renewal, a Portland
 newspaper advertising executive commented:
 "The idea  of using the bomb  again  is
 horrible.  But I wouldn't be here today if
 they hadn't used the bomb in Japan." Be
 was in the South Pacific during World War It.
 Demonstrations in several States by college
 students against renewal of the bombing
 against North Vietnam drew relatively sunail
 numbers of participants.
 Students Support United States
 Jerry Baker, president of his fraternity at
 Montana State University, reported that his
 house members were "definitely in favor (if
 the bombing policy."
 One, Tim Babcock of Montana, a Republi-
 can, thought "we may have waited too long."
 And the Right Reverend Chandler W. Ster-
 ling, Episcopal Bishop of Montana, said that
 he was saddened by the step but added, "I
 don't see where we have any alternative o t
 the moment;."
 There was conflicting opinion on whether
 voters were well informed on issues.  Ross
 Cunningham, political editor of the Seattle
 Times, doubted "if the average guy in the
 street worries about any misinformation."
 Joe Frisno, executive news editor of the
 Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said everybody he
 talked with "has a good idea what is going
 on and they believe either we should be there
 or not be there."
 Nevadans had mixed reactions on the re-
 sumption of bombing and Idahoan.,;. Includ-
 ing Gov. Robert E. Smylie, were described
 by  opinion  leaders  as  generally  believing
 that "the Nation was obliged to support the
 President's decision."
 Whereas many felt the public was getting
 all the  information  it    needed,  Governor
 Smylie, a Republican, called for "a good deal
 more candor on the part of the administra-
 tion."                                                                                                                                      And Gov. Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon,
 a candidate for  the  Senate, voiced "deep
 regrets" over the resumption of bombing.

 snowfall-
 However, indications that the heavy wea-
 ther had significantly distracted public at-
 tention                           from  the  war  were  scant; there
 apparently had been little anxiety about the
 fighting before the weekend storm brought
 unusual local hardships to the area.
 Observers  in  five  States---Pennsylvania,
 Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and Ken-
 tucky-said today that there was "more con-
 cern                          about  interrupted  deliveries  of fuel
 oil for furnaces and of milk for children"
 than about the resumed deliveries of Ameri-
 can bombs on the other side of the world.
 The prevailing mood was said to be one
 of quiet support for the President as the
 Commander in Chief.
 A dearth of public comment about Viet-
 nam-or  even  of  private  conversation  at
 office coffee breaks and at home gatherings--
 was widely interpreted by observers in all
 live States as constituting "strong but pas-
 sive support" for President Johnson's de-
 cision, announced Monday, to resume the
 bombing of North Vietnam after a 37-day
 pause.
 They Can Turn It Off
 Here in Pittsburgh, one ardent critic of
 that decision. Richard A. Rieker, managing
 editor of the Carnegie Review at Carnegie
 Institute of Technology, described the pre-
 vailing attitude of "many if not most" of
 the scores of persons he said he had talked
 to in recent days as "about equal to their
 interest in the Sunday pro football game---
 they can turn it on or they can turn it off
 about Vietnam and it is all right because
 the President. who has the facts, is expertly
 calling the plays whether they pay attention
 or not."
 "I guess you have to call that public sup-
 port," Mr. Ricker said. "But the war is not
 touching the country, in my opinion."
 "People are saying, 'What do I know about
 it?  What is it to me?  The people in Wash-
 ington  have  the                           facts,'"  the  38-year-old
 editor said.
 Mr. Ricker is      chairman  of an informal
 group here called the Pittsburgh Committee
 Against the War in Vietnam.  He said there
 were 25 persons at the last meeting in De-
 ceniber.
 (hev. William W. Scranton, in a monthly
 televised news conference that was broad..
 cast statewide last Sunday, appeared to have
 expressed a broadly held consensus about the
 resumption of bombing by observing, just
 before the decision was announced in Wash.?
 ington on Monday, that "in the very near
 future we are going to have to fish or cut
 bait, as we did in Korea."
 "If you can't come to some peaceful so-
 lution," the Governor said, "you apparently
 are going to have to start it (bombing) again
 in order to stop the North Vietnamese effort;
 from being successful in South Vietnam."
 Students Poorly Informed
 A poll on Vietnam among 188 undergradu.-
 ates at Carnegie Tech, published 2 weeks
 sego in the 'T'artan, the student newspaper,
 disclosed that half the students queried were
 unable to answer correctly even one of nine
 rudimentary questions about the war, such
 as:  "Identify Dienblenphu, Ho Chi Minh,
 Daring, Diem, and Pleime."  Only six of the
 students correctly identified all mine.
 Those who (lid well on the identifications
 held "widely divergent opinions" on the war,
 the Tartan reported.  "On the other hand.
 80 percent of those who knew virtually noth-
 ing about Vietnam disagreed with protest
 demonstrations and supported the Govern--
 ment.  Most students fall in this category"
 In Kentucky, Wilson W. Wyatt, a former
 mayor of Louisville, former Federal Housing
 Administrator,  and  manager  of  Adlai  B.
 1tevenson's 1952 presidential campaign, dur-
 ing the height of the Korean war, c0111-
 merited that "the Commander in Chief has
 made a difficult decision and the only thing
 to do now is to support him fully.  But I
 have  not  heard  any  exultation  over  the
 bombing,"
 Mr. Wyatt said that "in the present mood
 of national uncertainty" about Vietnam, a
 sharp rise in American casualties and draft
 call would be received "with a good deal of
 anguish"  and with  "the  probability of  a
 strong Republican attempt to exploit the
 issue."
 Should the war lead to a direct military
 confrontation  with Communist  China,    he
 said, "as much as I would regret such a de-
 velopment there would be total unity in the
 country to win."
 THE SOUTH:BI;N STATES

 GREENVILLE, Miss., February 2-After
 working hours  in  Raleigh,  N.C.,  State
 Treasurer Edwin Gill p'ops himself into an
 easy chair in the Sir Walter Hotel, where he
 lives, and "feels the pu;.se" of the public as
 it strides from the hotel entrances to the
 elevators.
 This week, the talk ha. turned i o President
 Johnson's decision to resume the bombing
 of North Vietnam, and Mr. Gill is yet to find
 anyone who criticizes the President for his
 action.
 "The general feeling   get," said Mr. Gill,
 who at 66 has survived nearly foul decades of
 political activity in the State, "is that he
 knows it great deal we do not know.  We are
 all trusting him to do what he thinks best."
 Across the  South,  pulse  samplers  were
 reading it much the same as Mr. (;ill, except
 for Mississippi and Alabama where there are
 rumblings that the war should be escalated
 still further, and at the Atlanta he adquarters

 Committee and the Sou t-fern Christian Lead-

 In Birmingham, Ala., more than 80 social,
 business,  and  labor  organizations  have
 adopted  an  entire  divsion-the  Big Red
 One---and  are  peppering  the i.roops and
 friendly Vietnamese with mail and gifts.
 Quietly Accepted
 Al Stanton, city editor of the Birmingham
 News, believes that the city had accepted the
 President's decision quietly, as ono, that was
 inevitable.  Had he riot taken it. Mr. Stan-
 ton said, the criticism would probably have
 been widespread.
 A week age, before President Johnson an-
 nounced his decision to resume                                                                                      he bomb-

 Vietnam even if this were to lead to full
 scale  Red  Chinese  Involvement  In  this
 event, Senator STENNIS favored stopping the
 hordes of Red Chinese coolies     with every
 weapon we have.
 "One  reason    the  legislators  applauded
 Senator STENNIS' speed: was that they do
 not see much that they can do to stop civil
 rights activity," said a veteran Mississippi
 reporter today. "So  this  seems  to make
 them want to stop the Communist s just that
 much more."
 While there is disenchantment     with the
 war among student committee acid leader-
 ship conference workers, Negroes in general
 appear to share the prevailing white view.  A
 Little Rock dentist, Dr. Garmar:  Freeman,
 said he thought that most Negroes;--whether
 middle class or poor--were not ^reatly in-
 formed on Vietnam issues, but were sup-
 porting the war because "it is something
 Uncle Sam is doing."
 Tendency Toward Suspicion
 In Columbia, S.C., Jim McAden, executive
 director of the South Carolina Tex Ale Manu-
 February d, 1966
 facturers Association, said that although the
 State "tends to be suspicious of anything
 Lyndon Johnson does," it is accepting his
 judgment on Vietnam because it has a "pa-
 triotic heritage and will fight over something
 and is glad. to do it,"
 The general view appears to bear out a
 recent study of old public opinion polls by
 Alfred O. Hero, Jr., in a recent book, "The
 Southerner in World Affairs."
 Mr. Hera said that in the period before
 World War II and in periods of tension with
 Communist countries since then, Southern-
 ers were quicker to give their support  to
 military objectives  that  were residents of
 other regions.
 They were less likely, too, than residents
 of other regions to withdraw their support
 because of increased drafting and taxation.
 "To be perfectly frank, the average per-
 son is not real informed on the issues," said
 Barney  Weeks,  president  of  the  Alabama
 Labor Council, "but he is for winning the
 doggone thing."
 Bombing is backed
 (By Martin Waldron)
 HousTON,        Feb.  2.-President Johnson's
 decision to resume bombing of North Vie t-
 nam has the overwhelming approval of resi-
 dents of Texas and Oklahoma.  But the war
 itself has much less support.
 Opinion leaders in the two States agree
 that the average citizen believes that bomb-
 ing of military targets in North Vietnam. will
 bring the war to an end sooner, and this is
 what they want, but if the war intensifies,
 residents of both States will give full backing
 to it.
 Both  Texas  and Oklahoma have  strong
 military traditions  and  regularly furnish
 large numbers of volunteers for the armed
 services.
 "The whole Southwest is somewhat mili-
 tarily  oriented,"  said  Charles  L.                                                                                                                                 Bennett,
 managing editor of the Daily Oklahoman in
 Oklahoma City. "Military service to many
 people still is the most honorable profession."
 Mr. Bennett said that Oklahomans had
 been showing "a growing impatience at the
 lull in the bombing" when peace moves by
 this country were frustrated.
 Community leaders in a dozen cities in the
 two States agreed that the Vietnam war is
 the most misunderstood war in the Nation's
 history.  Julius Carter, editor of a Houston
 weekly newspaper, the Forward Tinies, which
 says it is the "key to Houston's; Negro market,
 said: "Not only do not the average citizens
 not understand this war, a lot of Ph. D. s
 don't.   I don't myself.  Most people don t
 even know where the front is."
 Pickets in Houston
 A group of students picketed in down-
 town Houston yesterday in protest of the
 resumption of bombing.    They carried signs
 outside  the    Tenneco Building  for  several
 hours, and took a lot of verbal abuse from
 passersby, some of them stopped automobiles
 to curse them.  The pickets said they chose
 the Tenneco Building because two subsidi-
 aries of the company which owns the build-
 ing manufacture napalm.
 This was the only organized protest against
 the resumption of bombing in the two States.
 The Texas and Oklahoma daily newspapers
 had generally called  for a resumption  of
 bombing, and labeled it afterward as the
 only choice President Johnsen had.   Sonic
 editorials have said that the United States
 had not gone far enough.  The Daily Okla-
 homan called for bombing of Hanoi.
 In Austin., a leader of the Texas liberal
 community, Ronnie Dugger, said he frankly
 did not know what the majority of people
 in his; area thought.  "Among those I know.
 there is a sense of melancholy."
 In central[ Texas, and in the area around
 El Paso, both of which are centers of retired
 military personnel, the support of the re-
 sumption. of bombing is very strong  Where

 Senator JOHN G. TOWER made a speech in
 Braunfels calling for even more widespread
 bombing that President Johnson had ordered,
 he received a standing ovation.
 Most of those who were themselves against
 the resumption of bombing said they did not
 discuss it with persons outside their own
 circles.
 "I don't know what the people think about
 the bombing," said the Reverend James Mc-
 Namee, a Roman Catholic priest in Tulsa.
 "I know I think we should settle this war, and
 some people tell me they agree with me.  But
 others tell me they are for intensifying the
 war."
 The editorial page editor of the Tulsa Daily
 World,  Walter  Biscup,  said,  "Everybody I
 have talked to privately, publicly, officially,
 unofficially, on and off theecord, has been
 overwhelmingly in favor of the resumption
 of bombing.  It is the only way or shortening
 the war."
 NEW  ENGLAND  STATES
 Grudging response
 (By John H. Fenton)
 BOSTON,    February 2.-President Johnson
 has stirred firm but grudging response in
 New England to his decision to resume bomb-
 ing of North Vietnam.
 The     support has  many  facets.   Among
 them are the normal chins-up response to
 the Commander in Chief and a reflection of
 integrity in a matter of national commit-
 ment.                        But they also include a growing dis-
 illusionment with the entire military op-
 eration and a gnawing concern or the pos-
 sibility of escalation into a general war with
 Communist China.
 One      editor in Maine  said that he was
 chiefly concerned with the shaky condition
 of the Government of South Vietnam.
 Those in higher income and educational
 levels appear to be better informed about
 developments and aims, though they shared
 with the out-and-out  hawks a confusion
 over the moral aspects of the situation.  One
 man said, "Just because we don't like the war
 doesn't mean we aren't concerned about our
 boys over there fighting."
 Those are some of the conclusions of con-
 versations with a representative cross-section
 of leaders in positions dealing with public
 opinion  in communications,  religion and
 business.  And they include inferences made
 from the disinclination of some persons rep-
 resenting education, religion and business to
 discuss the situation even off the record.
 Little Visual Protest
 So far, there has been little visual pro-
 test.            A thin line of pickets ringed the Fed-
 eral Building here yesterday.  The group was
 organized by the Committee for Nonviolent
 Action which is based in Connecticut.  But
 some of the marchers came from local groups
 that had been opposed to the Vietnam con-
 flict from the outset.
 On Boston Common students handing out
 leaflets to passers-by reported half of those
 who accepted them kept them or at least
 put them in the pockets.   They said the
 others tossed them aside.
 Jerome Grossman, chairman of the Massa-
 chusetts Political Action for Peace, or PAX,
 said that the picketing gesture was intended
 to be a 24-hour vigil.  He expressed doubt
 that it was worth the effort and that the
 energy could have been spent in other ways.
 Mr. Grossman is a Boston businessman.

 TIIE     HARRIS  SURVEY-PUBLIC  WOULD  BACK
 MORE  TROOPS,  BOMBING  IF      NEGOTIATION
 MOVE FAILS
 (By Louis Harris)
 If the efforts of President Johnson and his
 emissaries fail to get the Communists to the
 negotiation table in Vietnam, the vast major-
 ity of Americans would support an imme-
 diate escalation of the war-including all-
 out bombings of North Vietnam and increas-
 ing U.S. troop commitments to 500,000 men.
 The temper of American public opinion
 might be described as hesitantly but deter-
 minedly militant if an acceptable peace can-
 not be negotiated.
 Before the pause, 39 percent of the public
 said it thought air raids on North Vietnam
 ought to be intensified.  But when asked
 what their-reaction would be if the Com-
 munists fail to respond to recent peace over-
 tures, the number who would support all-out
 bombings rose to 61 percent.     -
 A carefully  drawn cross section  of the
 public asked:
 "Despite the pause in bombings of North
 Vietnam and the ceasefire, suppose the Com-
 munists refuse to sit down and talk peace.
 Would you then favor or oppose all-out U.S.
 bombings of every part of North Vietnam?"

 The question on increased U.S. troops was

 are now being killed here every week. Would
 you favor our increasing the number of U.S.
 troops to 500,000-with higher losses of life-
 if that meant the war might be shortened
 or would you be against such a pig increase
 in U.S. troops?"

 Thus a clear majority of the American

 U.S. troops in Vietnam or both if there ap-

 U.S. public is deeply committed to the search
 for peace in Vietnam-but not for peace at
 any price.
 IN A DEAD-END STREET
 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President, as the
 dean of American political columnists,
 Walter Lippmann, always speaks out of
 long experience and with the kind of
 wisdom which has recently, following
 Senator AIKEN's use of the term here in
 the Senate, given rise to the characteri-
 zation "owl" in contrast to the other
 birds of frequent mention, the hawks and
 the doves..
 In today's column, which appeared in
 the Washington Post this morning, the
 judicious and well-phrased comment of
 Mr. Lippmann is turned toward the Ton-
 kin Bay resolution and its use as a
 "blank check," and toward the vital
 question of public debate on the ques-
 tions surrounding our action in Vietnam.
 As Mr. Lippmann points out, there are
 difficulties in holding a debate on this
 question, since expressions of dissent
 undoubtedly give comfort to the enemy.
 But, as he notes, "the remedy for this
 disadvantage cannot be to silence dis-
 sent. For the dissent cannot be silenced."
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the Lippmann column, "In a
 Dead-End Street," be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 IN A DEAD-END STREET
 (By Walter Lippmann)
 In saying that under the joint resolution
 of August 7, 1964, he has full authority from
 Congress "to take all  necessary steps" in
 Vietnam, the President left himself in the
 position of a man relying on the letter of the
 bond, regardless of what it meant at the time
 it was written.  There is no doubt that the
 language of the resolution gives him a blank
 check.  But there is no doubt also that when
 the blank check was voted in August 1964,
 it was voted to a man engaged in a campaign
 for the Presidency  against Senator Gold-
 water, who was advocating substantially the
 same military policy that President Johnson
 is now following. Therefore if laws are to be
 interpreted in the light of their legislative
 history, the President is without legal and
 moral authority to fill in the blank check of
 August  1964 with whatever he thinks he
 ought to do in 1968.
 It' is, of course, impossible to rescind the
 resolution of August 1964.  But as a matter
 of fact the actions of the administration go
 far  beyond  the  original  meaning  of  the
 resolution of 1964.  This is the positive rea-
 son why the objections and the conduct of
 the greatly enlarged war should be examined
 and debated before we are led into a still
 greater war.
 It ought not to be necessary to press this
 point in a country dedicated to government
 by due process of law.  A President who finds
 that his powers are challenged by respon-
 sible leaders of his own party and of the
 opposition would not refuse debate.    He
 would not pretend that briefings are a sub-
 stitute for debate.  He would insist upon de-
 bate and welcome it.  For only by refusing to
 rely upon the letter of the law would he be
 acting according to its spirit.
 It is wrong to keep using the blank check
 while many of those who voted for it in 1964
 now say-and historically they are indubit-
 ably  right-that  the  resolution  does  not
 mean what the President is making it mean
 in 1966.  It is also unwise to stretch the
 letter of the law this way.  For the country
 is deeply and dangerously divided about the
 war in Vietnam, and in the trying days to
 come this division will grow deeper if the
 President rejects the only method by which
 a free nation can heal such a division-
 responsible and informed debate.
 There are two principal difficulties in hold-
 ing such a debate.  About one of these we
 hear a great deal, namely, that our adver-
 sary will take heart from the speeches and
 newspaper articles and be confirmed in his
 view that the United States will not stay
 the course but will pack up and go home.
 Undoubtedly the dissent here at home does
 give comfort to the enemy abroad.
 But the remedy for this disadvantage can-
 not be to silence dissent.  For the dissent
 cannot be silenced.  It would be a delusion
 to suppose that this dissent has its source in
 the minds of a few Senators and of some
 publicists.  It has it source among a great
 mass of the American people who simply
 are not persuaded that the war in Vietnam

 tin United States.
 Nations do not fight indefinitely if they
 are not convinced that their own vital inter-
 ests are at stake.  Although the Korean war
 began under much better legal and mcral
 auspices than did our entanglement in Viet-
 anni, the American. people came to hate the
 Korean war.   The reason for that was that
 they did not believe that the Interests of
 America in Korea on the Asian mainland
 were great enough to justify the casualties
 tlla.t were being suffered.
 he oUier principal difficulty in uniting
 the country behind a national purpose in
 Inclochina is that the President's diplomatic
 advisers  have  never defined  our  national
 purpose except in the vaguest, most ambig-
 uous generalities about aggression and free-
 dom.                     The           country   could be united---in
 the preponderant mass-on a policy which
 rested on a. limited strategy and on limited
 political objectives.  It cannot be united on
 a policy ooi' trading American lives for Asian
 lives on 'lee mainland of Asia in order to
 make General Ky or his successor the ruler
 of  all of South Vietnam.  The division of
 the country will simply grow worse as the
 casualties a.nd the costs increase and  the
 attainment of our aims and the end of the
 fighting continue to elude us.
 'the recision of our policy in Vietnam-
 the revision of our strategy and our political
 purposes  and  plans-is  the  indispensable
 condition of ;L really united country and of
 an eventi;:il  truce abroad.  Gestures, prop-
 aganda, public relations, and bombing and
 more bombing will not work.   Without a
 revision of the policy--of our war aims as
 stated by Secretary Rusk of our military
 strategy  as   approved  by   Secretary  Me-
 Narnara--ilu, President will find that he is

 WARREN M. BLOOMBERG, MAN OF
 THE YEAR
 Mr. B1fEWSTER.           Mr. President, o-
 ganizatlo.rs  throughout  the  50 States
 have named Outstanding men for their
 deeds and dedication during the year
 19(L3, as "Man of the Year."
 Assistant  Postmaster  Warren  M.
 Bloomberg. of Baltimore, received such
 an award from the Maryland Society of
 Training Directors at their first annual
 awards dinner last week. Mr. Bloomberg

 hours  to  improve  labor-ma.nagemet-It
 relations in the post office system. His
 initiation of the impact training prog:Crarn

 Mr. Warren M. Bloomberg, a respected

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE

 Because of the swift technical develop-
 ment of communications, Mr. Wilson thinks
 the world is at the dawn of becoming a
 single cultural community.  He says: "Com-
 munications includes important elements of
 education, and is close to being the essence
 of humanism; our ability to draw upon the
 information created by those who went be-
 fore us is a uniquely human ability.  It is
 in the area of communications that Xerox
 has its special interests and will make, I
 trust,  special contributions.   Communica-
 tions technology is undergoing a revolution
 no  less  great  than  that  experienced by
 energy."
 To respond to the coming changes Mr.
 Wilson  believes  that people must  receive
 "purchasing power that is increasingly in-
 dependent of the hours spent doing things
 that have represented the great bulk of the
 world's work up to now.  We must, quite
 simply, invent anew kind of money, a new
 way of distributing the material wealth of
 our society.  How prepared are we to make
 the  social  inventions,  the practical  non-
 technical plans, for the changes in our in-
 stitutions that these developments are forc-
 ing upon us?"
 It is the tremendous spectrum of change
 that he sees coming that interests Mr. Wil-
 son so keenly in education.  He thinks of
 the university as the bridge to these new
 aspects of life, as a cluster of brains on
 which business, government, scientists, and
 other individuals must depend for the co-
 hesive intelligence needed to meet the prob-
 lems confronting the world.  The university
 will help preserve freedom, and Mr. Wilson
 says of freedom that it may be clumsy but
 it leads to greatness in any society or nation.
 His faith in freedom was an integral part
 of his work for equal rights for Negroes and
 other minority groups in Rochester.  Xerox
 today,  in  association  with  other leading
 Rochester   institutions (especially Kodak,
 of which. he is a great admirer), is working
 carefully to open up job opportunities, to
 give  special  training, to  recruit talented
 prospects from these groups.  The serious
 disturbances within Rochester's Negro com-
 muntiy last year were a "surprise to most of
 us here for we felt the city had really done
 a conscientious, enlightened job in this area
 of our relations with each other.  Our dif-
 ficulties were probably, a symptom of the
 racial tinderbox here and everywhere."
 With his wide reading and frequent travel
 abroad,  Mr. Wilson  feels  deeply involved
 with the world around him as well as with
 Xerox, but he recognizes that corporate suc-
 cess powers his ability to render the quality
 of public service that interests him in edu-
 cation, in racial justice, and the reduction
 of poverty, and in international relations.
 Of this aspect of Xerox, he says, "To provide
 leadership  within  business for the  social
 projects that interest us here we must be
 terribly successful.   If  our business were
 to falter it would harm our ideas.   Xerox's
 task is to remain incredible, but be credible.
 We want to be an important major world
 enterprise.  And we want to render services
 of real value to the world.
 In  a speech  at the United  Nations in
 connection with the controversial television
 programs Xerox sponsored, Mr. Wilson said,
 "It is a part of our philosophy that the high-
 est interests of a corporation are involved
 in the health of the earth's society.  How
 ridiculous it is to build a showroom in New
 York without simultaneously trying to help
 build a peaceful world.  Our objectives, like
 yours, are to help men better communicate
 with each other, and therefore it is all im-
 portant for Xerox to be favorably known
 throughout  the  world   as  an  institution
 willing to risk in order to improve under-
 standing, which will innovate boldly, but
 not recklessly, which will accept challenge
 of its short-range position in order to but-
 tress the long years ahead.                      It is our deeply
 considered judgment, cold and calculated,
 that this company will benefit by its asso-
 ciation with the U.N. and with you * *
 These men of the U.N., of all the earth's
 people, are living soul-size lives.  It is a joy
 and a value to join with them."
 A highly efficient, resourceful, imaginative
 version of the businessman-citizen Saturday
 Review regards as essential to the expan-
 sion of our economic society and of the
 quality of life in America, Mr. Wilson is
 himself living a soul-size life at a time of
 national urgency when our character and
 our principles are being challenged as never
 before.
 WILLIAM D. PATTERSON.
 THE  PRESIDENT'S  MESSAGE  ON
 INTERNATIONAL     HEALTH  AND
 EDUCATION
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.   Mr. President,
 today the President sent to Congress a
 special message on international health
 and education.
 Reading it, I remembered some in-
 formal remarks which President Johnson
 made last summer at the National Insti-
 tutes of Health.
 The occasion was the signing of the
 Health Research Facilities Amendments
 of 1965. Before putting his pen to that
 historic act the President made a speech
 which included these words:
 I wake up in the morning * * * and the
 one thing that sustains me is to see what we
 are doing for the lame and the palsied, what
 we are doing in adding knowledge in the field
 of education, what we are doing *  *  * to
 make this not just America the beautiful,
 but the world the beautiful.
 He spoke that day of "the goals that we
 will set for happiness for all of the chil-
 dren not only of our land," but of the
 world.
 I was struck then by the magnitude of
 the President's hopes.
 And I am glad today to see those hopes
 being translated into a program of
 mutual cooperation and mutual benefit
 to the world's nations.
 I believe this program will be remem-
 bered as a remarkable achievement for
 the Congress.
 It emphasizes cooperation, not char-
 ity.
 It recognizes that our wealth and man-
 power are not unlimited.
 It gives us an opportunity to broaden
 the concern we have already demon-
 strated for better health.
 It affirms Disraeli's famous observa-
 tion:
 The health of the people is really the foun-
 dation upon which all their happiness and
 all their powers as a state depend.

 IETNAM
 EMEMBER
 Mr. RUSSELL of South Carolina. Mr.
 President, while great and difficult deci-
 sions are upon the President and the
 Congress with respect to this Nation's
 foreign policy in Vietnam, I think it fit-
 ting that the observations of a soldier,
 stationed in that faraway place, be
 brought to the attention of us all. It is
 his recollection of Christmas evening in
 Vietnam, written by Capt. R. E. Ward
 III, son of Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Ward, Jr.,
 of Spartanburg, S.C.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 article from the Spartanburg Journal of
 Spartanburg, S.C., printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 A CHRISTMAS To REMEMBER
 (NOTE.-Christmas  has  passed  but  the
 memory and experience lingers with most.
 Here is the story of a soldier in Vietnam in
 his words:)
 R. E. Ward III, son of Mr. and Mrs. R. If.
 Ward, Jr., of 116 Pineville Road, is a captain
 with the 1st Infantry Division on combat
 duty in Vietnam.
 Prior to his Vietnam assignment, Captain
 Ward was aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. Ran-
 dolph C. Dickens.  For his performance dur-
 ing                                                                                                                              his  service with  Brigadier  General
 Dickens, Captain Ward received the Army
 Commendation Medal.
 Since he assumed his duties in Vietnam,
 Captain Ward and Mrs. Ward, the former
 Miss Beverly Riedel, have become parents of
 a son, Robert Edwin Ward IV.  He was born
 on January 6.
 From Vietnam, Captain Ward has written
 his parents about his observance of Christ-
 mas.                                                                                                                              No one can tell his story for him.  It
 follows in his own words:
 "A Christmas to remember:
 "Christmas Eve 1965, Republic of South
 Vietnam.  Tonight I experienced Christmas
 as man was intended to.  Unlike the typical
 cold snowy Christmas Eves of my youth, this
 was a warm tropical evening with a slight
 breeze, very pleasant and mild.  Also differ-
 ent was my dress.  On this night I, like most
 of the other men, was in uniform.  Not our
 dress uniform or class A uniforms, but in the
 dusty olive drab combat fatigues.  Some of
 the men even carried guns on their hips.
 "We all arrived at 2000 hours for the Main
 Post Chapel Christmas Eve communion serv-
 ice.                                                                                                                              The tent was without lights due to a
 generator failure and men were hastily put-
 ting up gas lanterns.  A wooden floor and
 strong rough pews had been placed inside.
 An altar table had been erected with the
 chaplain's altar set open in readiness for the
 service.  The men of the 1st Infantry Divi-
 sion band (used as guards of the division CP
 and the commanding general when not play-
 ing in the band) were seated inside the tent

 EDUCATION AND LIBBY DAM
 Mr. METCALF.                         Mr. President, one of
 the serious educational problems in vari-
 ous parts of the country has been con-
 struction of adequate school facilities, in
 time for children to use them, in fed-
 erally impacted areas.
 Lincoln County, Mont., is an impacted
 area which is due for a much greater
 impact in the years ahead.  Libby Dam in
 Lincoln County is going into construc-
 tion, by the Corps of Engineers, this year.
 According to a survey furnished me by
 the corps last year, the school population
 of the town of Libby will increase by 180
 this year, 1.1)60 next year. and 1,440 in
 1968.  In other words the school popula-
 tion in 1967 will be about 800 above what
 it was in 1966, and the Libby schools will
 have to educate an additional 380 chil-
 dren in 1963.  The impact will stay at
 approximately that high level, the corps
 estimated, through  1971.  The  Libby
 school system now has about 2,000 pupils,
 thus the new impact will mean an in-
 crease of about 70 percent.
 't'here will also be an impact, although
 a lesser one. on other school systems in
 Lincoln County, because of construction
 of Libby Darn.
 On January 10 I asked the Corps of
 Engineers and Office of Education to
 advise me how plans were progressing on
 extension of all possible assistance to the
 Lincoln County school system in connec-
 tion with Libby Dam construction.
 Mr. President, I am amazed by the re-
 sponse that I have received to that re-
 quest.              I find that the Corps of Engineers,
 which last year forecast a tremendous
 impact on the Lincoln County school sys-
 tem, has advised the Office of Education
 as follows:
 Most of the work on Libby Dam will be
 seasonal, due to winter weather conditions.
 Representatives of the Corps of Engineers
 have  expressed  their belief that,  for this
 reason, many of the construction workers
 will riot move their families into the Libby
 area, and that the workers will live there
 only during the actual working season.  If
 such proves to be the case, the impact on
 the Libby school system will not reach the
 proportions apparently anticipated by the
 officials of the school district.
 That statement above, attributed to
 the Corps of Engineers, contrast:i sharply
 with the forecast by the Corp: of En-
 gin(ers itself, in its estimates furnished
 me last year.
 Mr. President, I had) ::lot been aware of,
 any plan to construct, Libby Dam on a
 seasonal basis. The :Bureau of ICeclama-
 tion constructed Hungry Horse Dam and
 Yellowtail Dam, in similar latitudes, in
 record time.  Many construction work-
 ers, despite the nature of their work and
 the amount of travel and moving in-
 volved, endeavor to taite their families
 with them, particularly when, as in this
 case, construction will extend over a 6-
 year period.
 Libby Dam's builders are not going to
 be a bunch of hermits, working when the
 sun shines.  They are going to include
 a good many family men, many of them
 from other parts of Montana, who in-
 tend to stay with the .lob, be a part of
 the community, and educate their chil-
 dren in Lincoln County.
 I want to see adequate school facilities
 for those children.  I am not pleased
 with the conflicting forecasts Of school
 impact provided by the Corps of En-
 gineers.  It will be provided an oppor-
 tunity to review and reconsider these
 contradictions.
 I know that the corps, the Office of
 Education and the local school system
 have extremely competent and conscien-
 tious persons who want to provide ade-
 quately for the children's education.  I
 believe it wise to get this matter of pro-
 jected school population straightened out
 as quickly as possible.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to insert at this point in the RECORD
 the corps' March 1965 estimate of school
 enrollment increase in Libby, my letter
 of January 10 to Lt. Gen. William F.
 Cassidy, Chief, Corps of Engineers, which

 Army, Washington, D.O.
 DEAR  GENERAL  CASSIDY:  In  the  enclosed
 letter, Superintendent Carl R. Enle,bretson
 of the Libby, Mont., public schools, shows
 that close cooperation between the corps,
 the U.S. Office of Education and local school
 officials is essential in order to have ade-
 quate  school  facilities  available  for  the
 thousands of students who will be added to
 the Lincoln County school rolls alter con-
 struction of Libby Dam begins.
 I am most anxious to see that the Federal
 Government extends all possible assistance
 to the Lincoln County school system during
 this difficult period.
 I would like to know what the corps is
 doing in this regard now, and what else needs
 to be done.
 I am sending a copy of this correspondence,
 for comment, to Dr. B. Alden Lillywhite, As-
 sistant Commissioner and Director. Division
 of School Assistance in Federally Affected
 Areas, Office of Education.  I assume your
 people are already in touch with the Office
 of Education.

 While most of the respondents in this poll
 presumacly were not of voting age, the shad-
 ing of sentiment encountered in a canvass of
 adult opinion leaders suggested that feel-
 ings generally in the Pacific Southwest might
 divide in about the same ratio.
 Opinion has not yet generally crystallized
 into aggressive points of view.  But indica-
 tions are that it would not take many radical
 developments,  either  favorable or  adverse
 to polarize it.
 "People are supporting the President on
 Vietnam--a.n.d at this juncture they'd sup-
 port him  if  he chose to withdraw," said
 Philip Kerhy, editor of the liberal magazine
 Frontier.
 "Opinion  is  becoming  more  definite  on
 both sides of the question-mostly, I think,
 because of the growing intensity of pub'.ic
 discussion," commented Lennard Mandel, a
 shoe manufacturer.

 The general view appears to bear out a
 recent study of old public opinion polls by
 Alfred O. Hero Jr. in a recent book, "The
 Southerner in World Affairs."
 Mr. Hero said that in the period before
 World War II and in periods of tension with
 Communist  countries  since  then,  south-

 military objectives than were residents of
 other regions.
 They were less likely, too, than residents
 of other regions to withdraw their support
 because of increased drafting and taxation,

 A group of students picketed in downtown
 Houston yesterday in protest of the res.una-

 took a lot of verbal abuse from passersby;
 some of them stopped automobiles to curie
 them.   The  pickets  said  they  chose  the

 of the company which owns the buildii g
 manufacture napalm.
 This    was  the  only  organized   prote:;t
 against the resumption of bombing in. the
 two States.
 The Texas and Oklahoma daily newspapers
 had generally called  for a resumption of
 bombing, and labeled it afterwards as the
 only choice President Johnson had.  Some
 editorials have said that the United States
 had not gone far enough.  The Daily Okla-
 homan called for bombing of Hanoi.
 In Austin, a leader of the Texas liberal
 community, Ronnie Dogger, said he frankly
 did not know what the majority of people
 in his area thought.  "Among those I know,
 there is a sense of melancholy."
 In central. Texas, and in the area around EI
 Paso, both of which are centers of retired
 military personnel, the support of the re-
 sumption of bombing is very strong.  Where
 Senator JoNN G. TowER matte a speech in
 Braunfels calling for even more widespread
 bombing than President Johnson had or-
 dered, he received a standing ovation.
 Most of those who were themselves against
 the resumption of bombing said they did
 not discuss it with persons outside their own
 circles,
 "I don't know what the people think about
 the bombing," said Rev. James McNamee,
 a Roman Catholic priest in Tulsa.  "I know
 I think we should settle this war, and some
 people  tell me they agree with me.   But
 others tell me they are for intensifying the
 war."
 The editorial page editor of the Tulsa Daily
 World, Walter Biscup, said, "Everybody I have
 talked to privately, publicly, officially, un-
 officially, on and off the record, has been over-
 whelmingly in favor of the resumption. of
 bombing,  It Is the only way of shortening
 the war."
 NEW ENGLAND STATES
 Grudging response
 (By John H. Fenton)
 BosToN,   February 2.-President  Johnson
 has stirred firm but grudging response in New
 England to his decision to resume bombing of
 North Vietnam.
 The  support  has  many  facets.   Among
 them are the normal chins-up response to
 the Commander in Chief and a reflection of
 integrity in a matter of national commit-
 ment.                                                                                                                                       But they also include a growing dis-
 illusionment with the entire military opera-
 tion and a gnawing concern for the possibility
 of escalation into a general war with Com-
 munist China.
 One editor in Maine said that he was chiefly
 concerned with the shaky condition of the
 Government of South Vietnam,
 Those in higher income and educational
 levels appear to be better informed about de-
 velopments and aims, though they shared
 with  the out-and-out hawks  a confusion

 war doesn't mean we aren't concerned about
 our boys over there fighting."

 WITH COLORS FLYING
 Mr. PROXMIRE.         Mr. President, it is
 about, time that someone gave frank
 praise to the remarkable record this
 Government has made in recent years to
 the remarkable economic expansion and
 growth of our Government.
 Complaints about inflation, excessive
 spending, and so forth come easily and
 make headlines.  But the biggest eco-
 nomic fact today is the magnificent
 showing of the American economy and
 everyone with an eye to see and a brain
 to think must concede that the policies
 of the Johnson administration have had
 a great deal to do with it.
 Hearings this week before the Joint
 Congressional Economic Committee has
 reinforced these Johnson administration
 achievements.
 In today's Washington Post, Harold
 Dorsey makes a welcome analysis of the
 economic report. He shows that the re-
 port is not simply a singing of hosannahs
 to the past achievements but a realistic
 program to meet the problems of pros-
 perity and high employment.
 He points out that the President stands
 ready to recommend unpopular policies
 if necessary, as the President says:
 If the tax measures I am now proposing,
 in conjunction with the moderating influ-
 ence of monetary policy, do not hold total
 demand within the bounds of the Nation's
 productive capacity, I will not hesitate to ask
 for further fiscal restraint on private spend-
 ing.
 Dorsey calls that statement by the
 President "an impressive mouthful of
 economic wisdom" and the answer to the
 many economists who "have been doubt-
 ing that the administration recognizes
 the problem and who have been skepti-
 cal of the President's willingness to
 adopt corrective policies."

 moderating influence of monetary policy, do
 not hold total demand within the bounds of
 the Nation's productive capacity, I will not
 hesitate to ask for further fiscal restraints on
 private spending."
 That is an impressive mouthful of econom-
 ic wisdom.  Not only does it recognize the
 condition, but it also expresses a determina-
 tion to restrain demand to whatever degree is
 necessary to equate it with supply.   The
 statement seems to me to be the answer to
 the many economists who have been doubt-
 ing that the administration recognizes the
 problem and who have been skeptical of the
 President's willingness to adopt corrective
 policies.
 Equally important in this quotation is the
 implication of coordination in the use of
 monetary policies and fiscal policies.  This is
 reassuring because it has appeared in the
 past few months that there was friction,
 rather than coordination, in the relations of
 the Federal Reserve and the administration.
 The economic message explains with un-
 usual clarity the policies which led to the
 'current condition of full utilization of the
 economy's resources.   It explains why the
 problems and policies of a fully occupied
 economy are different than those of the last
 few years.  It recognizes that the problems
 ahead require an adjustment in policies if a
 satisfactory solution is to be found.
 I find it very difficult to criticize the policy
 adjustments that have been recommended.
 The acceleration of tax payments is likely to
 slacken moderately the upward trend in the
 spending of the private sector, but only
 temporarily.  It is one of the efforts to re-
 strain demand a little while the growth in
 capacity and supply catches  up.   Tighter
 credit and higher interest rates are designed
 to contribute to the same objective.   The
 temporary restraint on otherwise desirable
 Government expenditures is a third contri-
 bution to the same end.  The timing and co-
 ordination of all three of the policy decisions
 Is a neat bit of planning.
 The President's plea to business and labor
 leaders for restraint is appropriate.  The re-
 port tried to explain to them why their indi-
 vidual self interest would be damaged by In-
 flation, which is the most unjust and capri-
 cious form of taxation.  The administration's
 approach is one of education, not dictation.
 Many economists doubt that the art of eco-

 THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL
 AMENDMENT  TO    EXTEND    THE
 TERMS  OF  MEMBERS OF      THE
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO
 4 YEARS
 Mr. METCALF.  Mr. President, the
 proposed constitutional amendment to
 extend the term of Members of the
 House of Representatives from 2 to 4
 years makes good sense.
 A hundred and seventy years ago, the
 business of Congress was limited in
 scope, modest in volume, and less com-
 plicated in nature.  With the growing
 complexity of our modern society, the
 march of technology and the rise of the
 United States to a position of un-
 paralleled world power, the business of
 Congress has undergone radical change.
 Our work is now-almost unlimited in
 subject matter.  Its volume is stagger-
 ing. Its complexity is such that an en-
 tire lifetime could profitably be spent
 in trying to master it.
 There are, in fact, venerable Members
 who  have  acquired  great  expertise
 through long experience in that body,
 in one or another field of legislation.
 Their judgment is profoundly respected.
 Freshman Members should also have an
 opportunity to acquire, through expe-
 rience in office, at least the minimum of
 knowledge and of skill that is necessary
 today in order to discharge our collec-
 tive duties effectively.  The present 2-
 year term practically precludes attain-
 ment of that indispensable minimum.
 Consider for a moment the workload
 that confronts the Congress in this sec-
 ond half of the 20th century. We must
 come to grips with the strategy of nu-
 clear defense, the exploration of outer
 space, the use of natural resources. We
 concern Ourselves with foreign military
 economic aid, Federal aid to education,
 social security, labor relations, highways
 and housing, industrial health and safety.
 In every one of these fields, a high de-
 gree of expertise is required for the en-
 lightened discharge of the legislative
 function.  That requirement cannot be
 met in any field-let alone in more than
 one-within the short space of a 2-year
 term.
 The problem is greatly intensified,
 moreover, by the hundred-fold increase
 since 1789 in the number of bills intro-
 duced in the House of Representatives
 during a typical session of Congress.
 Legislation that is consistently high in
 quality as well as adequate in quantity
 to meet this Nation's growing needs
 would be most likely to emerge from that
 body if its Members could devote an un-
 interrupted stretch of 4 years to the
 problems involved.
