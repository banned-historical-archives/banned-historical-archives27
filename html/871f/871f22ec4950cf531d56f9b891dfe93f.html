 30 July 1959
 The Soviet leaders appear
 to be less hopeful about draw-
 ing further concessions from
 the Western foreign ministers
 on the issue of the form of all-
 German negotiations.   They may
 have decided to allow the Ge-
 neva talks to terminate with-
 out making any important
 changes in their position and
 to press for an early summit
 conference.
 In his speech in Dnepro-
 petrovsk on 28 July,Khrushchev
 said. the "time has come" for
 the heads of the government to
 tackle "complex unsettled inter-
 national issues."  He made a
 perfunctory call for "fresh ef-
 forts" by the foreign ministers
 to reach agreement "on what they
 can agree upon," but contended
 that "the other, more difficult
 matters...will be considered
 by the heads of government."
 Khrushchev said the USSR
 does not share the "unjustifi-
 ably pessimistic estimates" of
 prospects at Geneva made by
 "some Western leaders" and con-
 tended the foreign ministers
 have already accomplished some
 "positive work."  He claimed
 that all "misunderstandings"
 have been eliminated regarding
 the "term"  of the proposed
 agreement on Berlin and an all-
 German committee and stressed
 again that the time limit is
 not of "paramount importance."
 The Soviet premier continued to
 insist, however, on linking the
 creation of an all-German com-
 mittee to an interim settle-
 ment on Berlin and reiterated
 previous statements that the
 USSR will not underwrite any
 agreement which perpetuates
 the, occupation regime in West
 Berlin.
 The paper Gromyko handed
 the Western ministers on 28 July
 contained no important modifica-
 tions in Soviet proposals on
 Berlin and all-German talks.
 It is unlikely that the USSR
 would agree to an interim
 Berlin settlement if the West
 rejects all-German negotia-
 tions.   Gromyko?may propose
 that the foreign ministers pre-
 pare a document setting forth
 their differences and agree-on
 a date for a summit meeting.
 Soviet officials continue
 efforts to enhance East Ger-
 many's status through a con-
 tinued role in negotiations.
 the Soviet leaders probably did
 not expect any major change in
 the Western position, they may

 30 July 1959
 consider that the visit has
 furthered the USSR's posture
 as advocate of peaceful nego-
 tiations and advanced prospects
 for an early summit meeting,
 and possibly for a Khrushchev
 visit to the United States. The
 visit has been accorded'prominent
 and 'substantial:. Soviet newAs .e o erage.
 Khrushchev Visit to US
 In what appears to be a
 calculated camppaignQ Soviet !of-
 ficials':and- newsmen, in -seVeral
 cities:-haye  hinted that Khru-
 shchev would be delighted to
 receive an invitation to visit
 the United States.  The Soviet
 chargd d'affaires in Paris on
 20 July told an American offi-
 cial that he very much hopes
 Vice President Nixon's visit
 to the USSR may furnish the
 occasion for an invitation from
 President Eisenhower to Khru-
 shchev.   He suggested that
 Nixon might.extend this in*ita-
 tion when sending thanks for
 his reception in the USSR and
 added'that such a visit would
 be far more profitable than a
 summit meeting, where the dif-
 ferent attitudes of the British
 and French would not contribute
 to settling problems.
 "Captive Nations Week"
 The bloc reaction to the
 Congressional resoiLutian and the
 President's proclamation for a
 week of prayer for the enslaved
 peoples of Eastern Europe re-
 flects the Soviet leaders:' ex-
 treme sensitivity to any offi-
 cial Western reference to the
 subjugation of the Communist
 nations. They exhibited par-
 ticular irritation over its
 coincidence with the  Nixon
 visit,   Khrushchev set the tone
 for the reaction in. a speech on
 his return from Poland in which
 he termed the American action
 "direct interference" in Soviet
 affairs. and an "infamous slan-
 der."  The Polish press voiced
 regret that circles attempting
 to sharpen the cold war had
 drawn the President into the
 affair.   Khrushchev made fre-
 quent references to the "cap-
 tive peoples" while touring
 with the vice president in Mos-
 cow, and also in his 28 July
 speech in the Ukraine.
 Nuclear Talks
 The Soviet delegation at
 Geneva continues to press for
 discussion  of.  its annual-
 inspection quota proposal,and
 is attempting to play down any
 other East-West differences in
 the way of  a nuclear  test
 cessation agreement.  On  24
 July the chief Soviet delegate
 expressed satisfaction  with
 what, he termed a "significant
 rapprochement of positions" on
 control-post staffing.
 Using the figure of 30
 specialists at each post given
 by the West as an example in
 presenting its new proposal
 for one third Western,   one
 third Soviet, and one third
 from nonnuclear countries,
 he claimed that Moscow could
 accept the "ten specialists"
 prom the other side which the
 West was proposing, and there-
 fore had brought its position
 in line with Western desires.
 He charged, however, that the
 addition of specialists from
 nonnuclear countries,  which
 have not even. asked to be rep-
 resented, would not be in ac-
 cordance with the principle
 of "mutual control" by. the
 three powers.  He said that if
 the West Would drop this part
 of its proposal., "artificiii.lly
 introduced. into the conference,"
 Moscow would allow two or three
 of the ten Western representa-
 tives to be  from  nonnuclear

 declared that the USSR would
 "give up"`two-or three of its
 ten places to representatives
 of neutral countries.
 On 28 July the Soviet del-
 egation promised to study a
 Western draft for a prepara-
 tory commission to  function
 until the control commission
 becomes operative.
 West German Views
 Bonn political leaders
 expect an early climax to the
 foreign ministers' conference
 and fear that domestic pres-
 sures may make it impossible
 for the Western powers, partic-
 ularly London, to break off the
 conference over Moscow's de-
 mand for an all-German commis-
 sion.   Chancellor Adenauer ada-
 mantly opposes such a commis-
 sion, and Bonn plans to fight
 against acceptance of it, pos-
 sibly even to the point of re-
 fusing to participate.
 Bonn has been. considering
 a move to counteract continued
 Soviet propaganda that West
 Germany is the main obstacle
 to a settlement.   The govern-
 ment evidently intends to keep
 alive a plan which Foreign Min-
 ister Brentano revived at the
 cabinet meeting on 22 July for
 Bonn to offer Poland and Czecho-
 slovakia nonaggression pacts
 and to renounce the use of force
 in the settlement of boundary
 disputes.   Brentano argued that
 although this could lead to
 diplomatic recognition, Warsaw
 and Prague, without a specific
 renunciation of the German east-
 ern territories, would reject
 such a move.   Although the cab-
 inet at first rejected the pro-
 posal on the grounds that Po-
 land might accept it as a basis
 for negotiations and later claim
 Bonn should renounce the ter-
 ritories as proof of its good
 faith, government spokesmen
 have since announced the govern-
 ment's agreement "in principle."
 Bonn apparently intends to use
 hints of such a pact to deter-
 mine Soviet bloc reaction, while
 refraining from Making the ac-
 tual proposal at Geneva.
 West Berlin political lead-
 ers are more pessimistic than
 at any time since the crisis
 began last November.   They are
 concerned that the Western pow-
 ers may be forced to make con-cessions at Geneva, and would
 prefer a complete breakoff in
 the talks rather than any modi-
 fication of the Western powers'
 proposals.   They fear new East
 German harassment of access to
 the city.   Western observers
 noted a marked decline in pub-
 lic morale following the confer-
 ence recess on 20 June, but
 Secretary Herter's appearance
 in Berlin on 25 July may have
 bolstered spitits.
 British Reaction
 British press reporting
 has tended to dwell on  the
 different attitudes of  For-
 eign Secretary   Lloyd and his
 allies at  Geneva.   Independent
 and   Conservative papers re-
 ported  on 24 July that Lloyd
 had made clear Britain's satis-
 faction with  Gromyko's assur-
 ances that no unilateral action
 would be  taken during  the
 period of  an interim agreement
 on Berlin.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 July 195'
 French Comment
 Since the Geneva confer-
 ence reconvened, the French
 non-Communist press      has been
 notable    for  its relatively
 moderate tone and for the rel-
 atively limited space devoted
 to the talks.   Emphasis  has
 been on the unity of   Allied
 ranks, and although the men-
 tion of fissures in the West-
 ern front is not completely
 absent, remarks critical of the
 British have been subdued.   Al-
 though the press has sought out
 elements in Soviet statements
 which might provide the basis
 for hope that the two sides
 were inching toward each other,
 the absence of reconciliation
 between the two sides has been
 highlighted, and responsibil-
 ties for the lack of progress
 has been generally attributed
 to MOSCOW.
 (Concurred in by 05I
 Iraq
 The Qasim regime has ex-
 perienced a quiet week, with
 only minor clashes reported be-
 tween                     Communists and  anti-
 Communists since the                          Kirkuk
 troubles. Prime Minister Qasim
 was reported to  be      resting
 after his strenuous schedule
 during the revolution anniver-
 sary celebrations.                    However,
 he held a press conference on
 29 July in which he vigorously
 denounced the "anarchists"--
 by implication Communists--who
 he said had fomented the re-
 cent disorders in Kirkuk and
 other provincial towns.  He
 also warned the newspapers to
 curb their "news" of new plots
 and to halt their  recrimina-
 tions.
 Baghdad authorities mean-
 while continued quietly to take
 measures which have the effect
 of limiting Communist  influ-
 ence in the army and bureaucracy
 while they strengthen top con-
 trol of the government apparat-
 us.  Major General Abdi, the
 military governor general who
 exercises over-all administra-
 tive authority  because  the
 country is still legally under
 martial law, has  banned  the
 Communist-inspired "committees
 for the defense of the republic"
 which had acted as unofficial
 purge committees in various
 government departments.
 In his major speech during
 Egypt's revolution anniversary
 celebration, Nasir delivered a
 lengthy apologia regarding his
 attitude toward Iraq.   Although
 his remarks in  general  were
 conciliatory, he still put the
 blame on Qasim for coolness of
 VAR-Iraqi relations, and this
 is said to have ruffled  the
 Iraqi leader again.
 The UAR President put his
 main emphasis, however, on two
 other aspects--one was a lengthy
 interpretation of the signifi-
 cance and duties of the Nation-
 al Union, the regime's mass or-
 ganization.   It appears that the
 union in Nasir's mind is not a
 monolithic "party" in the Com-
 munist or fascist sense but a
 movement of the whole people
 which will find its most signif-
 icant expression in practical

 works, such as community de-
 velopment and agricultural im-
 provement projects on the vil-
 lage level, rather than in po-
 litical activity.
 Nasir's other theme was
 the Israeli issue,   He claims
 the UAR is ready for a new Is-
 raeli attack at any time, and
 revived the propaganda claims
 of 1956 that the Egyptian Army
 was not defeated, but merely
 withdrew in order to be better
 able to fight the British and
 French.
 The revolutionary celebra-
 tion and Nasir's speeches fall
 within a period appointed by
 Cairo for a "cultural seminar"
 for UAR students in the Soviet
 bloc which may be designed to
 reindoctrinate the students as
 well as to attempt to determine
 the extent to which Communist
 indoctrination has been success-
 ful. The authorities are not
 known to have decided yet wheth-
 er to curtail their program of
 education in the bloc.
 Nasir's blasts at   Israel
 last  week  took  the  form of
 replies to a speech by Moshe
 Dayan, the former commander of
 the Israeli Army who has en-
 tered politics under the wing
 of Prime Minister Ben-Gurion.
 The Dayan thesis appears to be
 that Israel should adopt a
 more actively tough policy, re-
 turning UAR "hostility" in kind.
 This statement may well
 have been a trial balloon for
 some new policy determination
 by the Israeli Government,since
 Tel Aviv has officially indi-
 cated that a "reconsideration"
 of the UAR position on the Suez
 Canal issue is under way. While
 the Israelis had previously in-
 dicated that the canal itself
 was not of major economic im-
 portance to them, they now talk
 of the delays and inconveniences
 experienced by their Asian cus-
 tomers as a result of the UAR's
 actions and of the more serious
 effects these actions have on
 their over-all position.
 Dayan's speech sounded like
 a menace to Cairo, and the cur-
 rent Israeli diplomatic line
 will probably confirm this im-
 pression as will indications
 than Israel intends to launch
 an international publicity cam-
 paign to block the UAR from ob-
 taining a World Bank loan for
 Suez, Canal development.
 Israeli Army summer maneu-
 vers, which reportedly involved
 some 35,000 men, are scheduled
 to conclude with an air defense
 exercise during the first week
 of August.   They involved mo-
 bilization practices and ground-
 air cooperation as well as this
 exercise.
 Lebanon
 Public order in Lebanon,
 which is always somewhat pre-
 carious, received another blow
 this week with the assassina-
 tion of Naim Mughabghab, a top

 Paratroop and infantry re-

 to Sam Neua Province, where the
 government's position has dete-
 riorated rapidly in the past
 ten days.      The two battalions

 the West of Sam Neua apparently
 is in enemy hands and the pro-
 vincial capital itself is re-
 ported under threat of attack.
 Loss of the airfield at Sam
 Neua would cut off the govern-
 ment's principal means of ac-
 cess to this remote province.
 Panic has struck the town
 and a general exodus of inhabi-
 tants and government officials
 is taking place by air and on
 foot.   There are no check points
 around the town of Sam Neua and
 Communist partisans reportedly
 are infiltrating the area.
 Antigovernment forces in
 the province number perhaps
 1,000.   They apparently comprise
 pro.-Communist local tribesmen,
 augmented by company-size units
 of the former Communist Pathet
 Lao, and possibly some Viet-
 namese Communist cadres.   The
 rugged terrain favors the enemy,
 and the nearby frontier facili-
 tates covert support from North
 Vietnam.   In a 29 July com-
 mun:Lque, Laos openly charged
 North Vietnam with complicity
 in the current fighting.
 At least two incidents of
 harassing attacks on army six-
 man "civic action teams" have
 occurred in two provinces in
 central Laos.  These may be
 designed to forestall addition-
 al reinforcements for the north.
 The military commander in cen-
 tral Laos views the situation
 there as such that he cannot
 spare any of his troops at
 present.
 Laotian officials view the
 over-all situation as "grave,"
 but do not believe the present
 fighting heralds full-scale
 civil war throughout  Laos.
 Premier Phoui believes  the
 enemy's primary purpose is to
 take possession of Sam Neua, and
 later Phong Saly Province, both
 Pathet Lao strongholds prior
 to the unification settlement
 with the government in November
 1957'.   In addition to the in-
 ternational implications, the
 attacks may have the aims of
 forestalling the government's
 increasing efforts to combat
 Communist influence at the grass
 roots and disrupting the army's
 new training program.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 TOP CHINESE LEADERS MAY BE REV][EWING BASIC POLICY
 Only five members of Com-
 munist China's 26-man party
 politburo have been reported in
 Peiping during the past month,
 which suggests that the top
 leadership has been meeting out-
 side the capital for a basic
 policy review. Mao Tse-tung
 has not been seen since 18 June,,
 and Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai
 since 25 June,  The request
 early,inJuly by a Canadian mem-
 ber of parliament to see Mao,
 Liu, and Chou was rejected as
 "inconvenient because they are
 at a retreat in the mountains@"
 There has been Some loss
 of momentum during 1959 in the
 "giant leap forward" and the
 commune campaign.  The regime
 seems to be backing away from
 extravagant 1959 economic tar-
 gets, especially in agriculture.
 Also Peiping has had consider-
 able trouble with the communes
 and now is emphasizing more
 material incentives and a less
 rigidly controlled life for
 the overworked peasant members.
 Renewed attention is being given
 the country's economic difficul-
 ties.
 the members were apparently ab-
 sent from Peiping,  One, Li
 Hsien-nien, has since been re-
 ported in Shanghai presiding
 over an agricultural conference.
 His appearance there suggests
 that some of the leaders now may
 be explaining the regime's
 domestic policies at the region-
 al level.
 I
 A discussion of foreign
 policy also may be linked to
 a top-level conference.  Peiping's
 ambassadors to India, Pakistan,
 Cambodia, Indonesia, and the
 UAR and its charge in Yemen
 have been reported returning
 to China since early June. The
 Chinese Communist ambassadors
 to Burma and the USSR are ab-
 sent from their posts, suggest-
 ing they too have returned.
 A recent article by the
 Kwangtung Province party first
 secretary appears to be defend-
 ing Mao against, criticism of
 his "leap forward" and commune
 programs.  The article states
 that "greatness" lies not in
 always being correct--which is
 impossible--but in continually
 uncovering new problems and
 changing policies accordingly.
 American officials in Hong Kong
 note that Mao is the only Chi-
 nese characterized as "great"
 in the mainland press,
 A meeting of the politburo
 could have been held during the
 last week in June, when all of
 t
 Foreign policy talks now
 would probably seek to apprise
 Chinese leadership of internal
 developments in the countries
 to which the ambassadors are ac-
 credited and to assess the de-
 gree of damage done to Peiping's
 prestige by 1958's truculent
 policy and by suppression of the
 Tibetan revolt.  'Last winter,
 Peiping indicated its basic
 policy is still to "isolate the
 United States" and improve Com
 munist China's international
 standing, and that a less bel-
 licose attitude would be adopted
 toward certain Western nations
 and the uncommitted Asians.
 A recent acrimonious note
 to Pakistan and the recrimina-
 tions exchanged with India and
 the UAR suggest, however, that
 the protection of its own in-
 terests will not be sacrificed
 to the pursuit of friendship.

 any  conference of the Chinese
 leadership,
 Khrushchev has again ex-
 pressed disapproval of the
 commune system despite the Chi-
 nese Communist regime's con-
 tinuing commitment to that form
 of organization and despite the
 fact that differences on this
 issue have been an irritant to
 Sino-Soviet relations in the
 past.  The Soviet premier's
 latest disparagement, during
 his recent tour of Poland, was
 made publicly and has been
 carried in the Polish and So-
 viet press, whereas his earlier
 comments were made in a private
 interview with Senator Hum-
 phrey.
 Addressing a meeting at a
 collective farm near Poznan on
 18 July, Khrushchev recalled
 that efforts had been made to
 set up agricultural communes
 in the Soviet Union in the
 early 1920s but that "nothing
 came of many of these communes."
 Tracing their failure to the
 absence of the necessary ma-
 terial and political conditions,
 Khrushchev concluded that the
 sponsors of the movement "had
 a poor understanding of what
 Communism is and. how it is to
 be built."  In the setting and
 context, it ie probable that
 Khrushchev's remarks were in-
 tended primarily to reassure
 Polish peasants against hasty
 socialization of agriculture,
 but this renewed criticism of
 the commune is not likely to set
 well with the Chinese Communists.
 Khrushchev had expressed
 himself in similar terms in
 his meeting with Senator Hum-
 phrey last December.   The Chi-
 nese communes, Khrushchev said,
 were "old-fashioned, reaction-
 ary, and impractical" because
 they-ignored the principle of
 incentives as a spur to pro-
 duction.  Following publica-
 tion of Humphrey's account of
 the interview, Peiping report-
 edly protested to Moscow, and
 at the 21st party congress in
 January, Khrushchev disavowed
 his statements, alleging that
 they had been fabricated.
 Since late last year, Pei-
 ping has retreated from its
 extreme ideological claims.
 The Chinese "transition to
 Communism" has been put off;
 the principle of free supply
 has been drastically altered
 in favor of Khrushchev's "ma-
 terial incentives"; and the
 assertion that the commune is
 "the basic form for the future
 Communist society" is muted.
 The Chinese have repeatedly
 stressed, moreover, that their
 commune is specifically tai-
 lored to Chinese conditions.
 Soviet media subsequently car-
 ried several mildly favorable
 reports on the communes.  How-
 ever, these have appeared most-
 ly in media which reach non-
 blocc audiences, and they have
 consistently pointed out that
 the commune's advantages are
 limited to "Chinese conditions."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 July 1959
 Khrushchev's Poznan speech
 has not been reported by the
 Chinese.   Peiping's propaganda
 continues to praise Soviet
 achievements--from which the
 "Chinese must earnestly learn"
 --and to affirm Moscow's lead-
 ership of the bloc.   Peiping has
 shown that it prefers a picture
 of Sino-Soviet unity unmarred
 by public debate on the commune.
 However, the Chinese leadership
 is certain to take Khrushchev's
 Poznan remarks as criticism,
 which is especially to be re-
 sented in view of Peiping's ef-
 forts to accommodate itself to
 Moscow's disapproval of the
 communes.   Peiping can be ex-
 pected to renew its protest to
 Moscow, insisting, at the least,
 that future criticisms of Chi-
 nese policies be expressed
 privately rather than in a
 public forum
 YUGOSLAVIA'S DISPUTE'?'wl'rH SOVIET BLOC
 The dispute between Yugo-
 slavia and the Soviet bloc has
 resumed much of its original
 character despite the tactical
 maneuvering which followed
 Khrushchev's visits to Albania
 and Hungary during late May and
 early June.   Recent unconfirmed
 reports of a future meeting be-
 tween Khrushchev and Tito seem
 unfounded, since neither side
 is willing to make concessions
 to achieve a rapprochement or
 even a stable detente.
 no change
 o  a     u es  s  i t ly while
 Khrushchev and Tito are in power.
 nce Khrushchev's
 visit to Hungary and Albania,
 however, the Yugoslavs have
 attacked the USSR only once--
 for misleading press treatment
 of its agricultural system and
 production results--in contrast
 to their daily contention in
 the press  with  all  the satel-
 lites except Poland,
 A change was noted, too,
 in Yugoslavia's economic re-
 lations with'the USSR, and
 early this month Belgrade opened
 negotiations with Moscow over
 the developmental credits grant-
 ed by the USSR in 1956 and
 suspended in 1958.   At the one
 session to date,' the Yugoslavs
 presented a claim for damages
 to their economy caused by the
 suspension.   Officials on both
 sides doubt that any signifi-
 cant part of the credits will
 be rescheduled or that the
 talks will be continued at a
 higher level.
 Belgrade also charged that
 Moscow has violated its trade
 agreement by refusing to sell
 wheat at market prices
 elgrade expects
 to be treated on the same favor=
 able trade terms as bloc mem-
 bers. The Yugoslavs, for example,
 sought Russian wheat at the
 same price set for the Albanians.
 Moscow apparently does not
 feel it has to bargain for
 Yusoslav foreign policy support
 because Belgrade's "socialist
 pretensions" already force it

 THE INTER-AMERICAN MEETING OF FOREIGN MINISTERS
 The foreign ministers of
 the 21 American republics will
 convene in Santiago, Chile, on
 12 August to discuss threats of
 war in the Caribbean arising
 mainly from efforts by Cuba and
 Venezuela to "liberate" the
 peoples under dictatorships.
 This dispute has endangered the
 effectiveness of the Organiza-
 tion of American States (OAS)
 and confidence in its collective
 security system.
 The meeting grows out of
 Dominican dictator Trujillo's
 complaint against Cuba and Vene-
 zuela for complicity in three
 small rebel landings in the
 Dominican Republic and his re-
 quest on 2 July that the OAS
 put into effect the consulta-
 tions called for under the In-
 ter-American Treaty of Recipro-
 cal Assistance, Before the re-
 quest came to a vote, the vari-
 ous OAS. delegations made it
 clear that widespread hatred
 for Trujillo in their countries
 would make it impossible to
 vote for consultations regarding
 Cuban and Venezuelan interven-
 tion, regardless of the facts
 of the matter? Paradoxically,
 this position is a revereal of
 the customarily adamant Latin
 American insistence on the
 principle of nonintervention.
 As an alternative, the OAS
 Council called the meeting in
 Santiago to consider political
 tensions in the Caribbean, which
 threaten such countries as Haiti
 and Nicaragua, as well as the
 Dominican Republic.   Avoiding
 specific charges, the brief
 draft agenda for the meeting
 emphasizes:   1)  consideration
 of Caribbean tensions in the
 light of principles and standards
 which govern the inter-American
 system, 2) effective observance
 of the principles of noninter-
 vention and nonaggression, 3)
 the effective exercise of rep-
 resentative democracy and re
 spent for human rights, and 4)
 the "perfection" of inter-Ameri-
 can instruments and procedures
 to help maintain peace.
 Several officials have al-
 ready expressed pessimism about
 its results.   The debate will
 probably be acrid and complicat-
 ed by other issues,   Cuba, for
 example, wants to stress econom-
 ic problems as the Caribbean's
 worst ill; on 28 July Foreign
 Minister Roa said Cuba might
 boycott the meeting if economic
 problems are not included in the
 agenda,   Venezuela, which en-
 joys high prestige in the hem-
 isphere                                                                  as a genuinely demo-
 cratic government, is already
 campaigning for the ouster of the
 Dominican Republic from the OAS,

 ARGENTINE MILITARY UNREST SUBSIDES
 Argentine President Fron-
 dizi's appointment of  Navy
 Secretary Clement on 26 July
 ended the near rebellion in
 the navy and promises to give
 him some respite from the sharp
 military pressures of the past
 two months.   As in the case of
 the new army secretary, Clement
 has not been involved in the
 recent service quarrels and was
 selected by Frondizi to restore
 discipline and thereby dis-
 courage military efforts to
 dictate to Frondizi.
 Frondizi was finally forced
 to replace former Secretary
 Estevez;when top naval officers
 stated they would no longer
 follow Estevez' orders because
 he did not adequately repre-
 sent navy views.   The fleet
 returned to its main base from
 maneuvers to reinforce this
 stand.   The majority of top
 admirals had tendered their
 resignations but at the same
 time had told subordinate units
 that the admirals,. not Esteirez,
 were in charge of the navy.
 The new secretary, a re-
 spected retired'officer, should
 be acceptable to the navy not
 only because of his background
 but also because he has not
 been involved in the recent
 service quarrels.   He requested
 retirement in December 1954,
 participated in the anti-Peron
 revolution of September 1955,
 and subsequently served in the
 provisional government.
 Estevez' departure has al-
 ready eased tension and, to-
 gether with the earlier cabinet
 and service changes, reduces
 the area for effective exploi=
 tatioa by die-hard plotters.
 Army Secretary Anaya, a retired
 officer appointed on 1 July,
 continues to make a good im-
 pression in his similar prob-
 lem of restoring discipline.
 The air force, since its bitter
 intraservice dispute in Sep-
 tember 1958, has managed to
 keep out of the spotlight.
 Apparently quieted tempo-
 rarity by the military crises,
 Peronista and Communist labor
 leaders now have renewed their
 agitation for emergency wage
 increases to offset the rise
 in living costs, which have
 about doubled since Frondizi
 took office on 1 May 1958.   The
 strike called by the , Peronista-
 dominated metallurgical workers
 on 2,6 July resulted in running
 battles with the police and
 threats to try to promote a
 general strike.   Bombings
 have also increased, although
 not necessarily because of the
 strike.
 Anti-Peronista labor is

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 July 1959
 Peronista and Communist labor
 leaders.   The latter announced
 in mid-June their intention to
 wage a joint campaign against
 austerity measures under the
 US-backed stabilization program.
 This combination is be-
 lieved to have contributed to
 the sharp drop in popular votes
 received by Frondizi's party--
 63 percent below 1958--in the
 12 municipal elections in Santa
 Fe Province on 26 July.   The
 number of blank ballots--mostly
 from the Peronistas--was larger
 than the vote of any single
 party.   Some 10 percent of the
 tota l'vote was received by the
 Communist party, which was al-
 lowed to participate despite         25X1
 Frondizi's April decree out-
 lawing Communist political
 activities.
 France apparently expects
 that its first nuclear weapons
 test--now anticipated early in
 1960--will meet the United
 States 'legal requirement for
 "substantial progress" and
 thereby qualify France for
 broad American aid on nuclear
 weapons construction.   In this
 expectation, the French Govern-
 ment now seems to prefer to
 work out its first test of a
 nuclear weapon unaided, and is
 increasingly inclined to see
 eventual advantages for France
 in the idea of limiting the
 number of nuclear powers.
 Minister of Armed Forces
 Guillaumat admitted in June
 that help from the United States
 would have been welcome five
 or six years ago, but he
 stressed that for France to
 receive aid now "for the first
 explosions, which can and will
 be purely French, would be a
 grave error of policy."  A
 Foreign Ministry spokesman in-
 terprets Guillaumat's State-
 ment to mean that American aid
 to the French nuclear weapons
 program now would jeopardize
 more extensive aid after the
 first French tests.   Some French
 officials have hinted that be-
 fore the French tests-are con-
 ducted, a definite promise-of
 American aid or perhaps even
 the establishment of a "work-
 ing-level" committee to decide
 the type and extent of aid to
 be granted would be more wel-
 come than actual aid in the
 first tests.
 The French argue that the
 Soviet Union already has the
 information they would receive
 from the United States,   and
 that with American aid, France
 would save money which could
 then be used to meet its NATO
 commitments.   NATO Secretary
 General Paul-Henri Spaak had
 publicly told the Atlantic
 congress in June it seemed
 logical that there should be
 no secrets between allies.
 :Presumably because of its
 growing expectations, Paris no
 longer rejects out of hand a
 limitation on the size of the
 "nuclear club" to as few powers
 as possible.  There is evidence
 that some French officials be-
 lieve that ultimately the "prin-
 ciple"' of :limit ng the club
 fnaj- 'work to 'French  benefit..
 They :reason that once France's
 first weapon is tested without
 foreign assistance, France
 would qualify as the fourth
 nuclear  power,   and  the
 "principle"  would  discourage
 any  "fifth power"  in  the
 nuclear  weapons  field.

 SCANDINAVIAN REACTION TO CANCELLATION OF KHRUSHCHEV VISIT
 Khrushchev's cancellation
 of his August visit to Denmark,
 Norway, and Sweden has occa-
 sioned surprise, some embarrass-
 ment, and sharp political con-
 troversy in Norway and Sweden
 but no serious alarm regarding
 relations with the USSR.
 The Scandinavian govern-
 ments in their notes to the
 Soviet Union regretted the
 "postponement" of the visits,
 which they had somewhat re-
 luctantly scheduled in return
 for the visits of the three
 Scandinavian premiers to the
 USSR in 1955 and 1956.  How-
 ever, various officials, par-
 ticularly members of the for-
 eign ministries, have indicated
 they are glad to avoid at this
 time any discussions with Khru-
 shchev which might involve them
 in Soviet propaganda gestures
 regarding a "Baltic sea of
 peace" or a Scandinavian zone
 free of nuclear weapons and
 missiles.
 Some concern was suggested
 by the care taken in the notes
 to express the hope that the
 traditional good relations be-
 tween Scandinavia and the USSR
 would not be affected.   Nor-
 way's Prime Minister Gerhard-
 sen in a public statement
 has severely criticized  the
 opposition parties and   the
 press for irresponsibility'
 and for influencing Norway's
 relations with the USSR "in
 a negative manner',"  In both
 Norway and Sweden,  a vitriolic
 political controversy  has
 flared up between   the  So-
 cialist governments                                                                 and their
 opposition, with the Social-
 ist press accusing  the op-
 position of playing domestic
 politics with the visit.
 In Finland, which Khru-
 shchev was to have visited
 on  a less formal basis  en
 route back to the USSR, of-
 ficials and the press  appear
 to have  maintained  their
 characteristic reserve in
 making any comments  on the
 Soviet move.    One independent
 newspaper, however, predicted
 that Khrushchev's  decision
 indicated a "harder and  more
 restricted Soviet  foreign
 policy toward   the Scandina-
 vian  countries"  and, by im-
 plication,   Finland.
 BRITISH PARTY CONTROVERSY OVER CENTRAL AFRICAN POLICY
 Two weeks of House of Com-
 mons debates have pointed up
 the dilemma London faces in
 preparing for next year's re-
 view of the constitution of
 the Federation of Rhodesia and
 Nyasaland.   This review was
 envisaged when the British Gov-
 ernment granted virtual self-
 government to the white-settler-
 controlled federation in 1953,
 but pledged not to withdraw
 its protection from the Afri-
 cans of Northern Rhodesia and
 Nyasaland without their con-
 sent.
 Both British political
 parties are worried about Af -
 ricart developments, but they
 differ sharply over colonial
 policy;  clashes on this sub-
 ject have been unusually acute.
 The Macmillan government is
 principally anxious that the
 review be accomplished,  in
 such a way a$to bring neither
 renewed African violence, like
 that in Nyasaland last winter,
 nor open thwarting of London
 by the federation government.

 The Labor par-

 tuated by its search
 for a popular issue
 for the general
 elections expected
 this fall.   Although
 colonial issues do
 not normally carry
 much weight with the
 British electorate,
 Labor's failure to
 attract popular sup-
 port for its ecoAr
 nomic program or its
 proposal for disarma-

 this issue likely to
 draw unusually heavy
 party attention.
 RHODESIA  AND NYASALAND
 The Labor party is en-
 couraged by some independent
 press support for its demands
 that Colonial Secretary Lennox-
 Boyd resign, and will probably
 continue exploiting the find-

 Commission that the Macmillan
 government exaggerated an Af-
 rican "massacre plot" to justi-
 fy invoking a state of emergen-
 cy in Nyasaland last March.

 to Prime Minister Macmillan's
 plan to establish a new 26-mem-

 on the government will greatly
 hamper the constitutional review
 if they win the British elections
 and have to deal with the feder-
 ation's  prime minister, Sir Roy
 Welensky,with whom they have

 may also be expected to strengthen

 tween Ethiopia and Somalia, a
 UN trust territory administered
 by Italy'and scheduled for inde-
 pendence in December 1960, is
 still undemarcated after eight
 years of negotiation.   Addis
 Ababa is increasingly concerned
 over the Greater Somalia move-

 2,500,000 Somali tribesmen
 scattered through five terri-
 tories--Somalia, British and
 French Somaliland, Kenya, and
 Ethiopia.
 In Cairo, the Ethiopians
 reportedly obtained President
 Nasir's promise to change his
 attitude '.tdward- ,Addis 'Ababa.
 In the past, Cairo radio has
 broadcast anti-Ethiopian prop-
 agandaain favor of the Moslems,
 and Egyptian agents have been
 active among the Moslems of
 Somalia and to a lesser extent
 those of Ethiopia.   As a result,
 relations between Cairo and
 Addis Ababa have been tense;
 the Emperor had repeatedly put
 off a visit to Cairo during
 recent years.
 Nasir now apparently has
 agreed to end the press attacks,
 to support Ethiopia at the
 United Nations on the Somali
 boundary issue, and to withdraw
 support from the Greater Som-
 alia movement.
 Nasir's reported,about-

 an accommodation with his

 THE MALAYAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 The decision of the Malay-
 an Chinese Association (MCA) to
 remain in Malaya's ruling Alli-
 ance party has, at least tem-
 porarily, resolved a serious
 political crisis and improved
 the Alliance's prospects of
 winning a substantial majority
 of the 104 seats at stake in
 the 19 August general elections.
 The compromise settlement re-
 sulted, however, in the resig-
 nation of a number of MCA lead-
 ers and a probable decline in
 Alliance strength in predomi-
 nantly Chinese districts. The
 dispute:also has almost cer-
 tainly increased racial ten-
 sions, which could  reach;
 the  breaking   point during
 the current campaign.
 Communal. issues, principal-
 ly candidate apportionment and
 the use of the Chinese language
 in school examinations, were
 the basis for the MCA rift with
 the United Malay National Or-
 ganization (UMNO), the Malay
 component of the Alliance. The
 final apportionment of candi-
 dates resulted in 69 UMNO, 31
 MCA, and 4 Indian nominees--
 numbers which reflect roughly
 the relative strengths of the
 three Alliance partners.
 Opposition candidates in-
 clude 58 from the Pan-Malayan
 Islamic party,  19 from the
 People's Progressive party, 37
 from the Socialist Front, 11
 from two smaller parties, and
 29 independents,   All of these
 opposition. parties tend to in-
 cite communal discontent in
 their campaigns, for virtually
 all their candidates are play-
 ing to only one of the two ma-
 jor racial groups, Malays or
 Chinese.
 Recent events in Malaya,
 including the::state assembly
 elections and the MCA-UMNO
 squabble, indicate that there
 is a continuing trend toward
 voting along strictly racial
 lines.   In the 11 state asses-
 bly elections, the vote for the
 multiracial Alliance totaled
 approximately 54 percent--a
 sharp decline from the 80-per-
 cent total in the last nation-
 al election in 1955.   This de-
 cline in Alliance strength prob-
 ably will not be fully reflect-
 ed in the forthcoming elec-
 tions, however, ? because of the
 disunity  of  the  opposition
 parties  and their lack of a
 nationwide organizational base.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE WAR IN ALGERIA
 The war in Algeria, now in
 its fifth year, appears to be
 entering a crucial phase.   The
 French are increasingly, hope-
 ful of being able to announce
 the "pacification" of the rebel-
 lion before the UN debate on
 Algeria this fall; leaders of
 the rebel Army of National Lib-
 eration (ALN) maintain that the
 start of the rainy season in
 October will permit them to re-
 organize and resupply their
 forces as they have in the past.
 Area of
 Current French Offensive
 With the French now con-
 ducting an all-out campaign
 against rebels in mountainous
 eastern Algeria, the course of
 the war in the next few months
 may determine whether the rebel-
 lion can be defeated militarily,
 or whether a settlement can be
 reached only through negotia-
 tions.   The moderate Algerian
 leadership---which recognizes
 that the rebel army cannot force
 the French out of Algeria--has
 long favored negotiating with
 the French, but De Gaulle-has
 refused to discuss any politi-
 cal issues, only a cease-fire.
 He has also insisted that talks
 must be held in Paris rather
 than in a neutral country as
 desired by the rebels.   The French
 are unlikely to modify this
 stand as long as there is a
 possibility of a military victory.
 French.Strategy
 Under the lead-
 ership of air force
 Gen. Maurice Challe,
 French forces now are
 putting more pressure
 on the rebels than at
 any time in the war.
 Concurrently, the
 French are making
 strenuous efforts to
 win the allegiance of
 the uncommitted Mos-
 lems and to keep the
 rebels from contact-
 ing their Moslem sup-
 porters.   Without of-
 fering independence,
 De Gaulle has sought
 to convince the Mos-
 lems that a French
 victory will not turn
 back the clock or re-
 turn them to the sta-
 tus of second-class
 citizens.
 Militarily, Challe's plan
 emphasizes the aggressive pur-
 suit of rebel forces in the
 field, the garrisoning of
 "pacified" areas, and the de-
 nying of supplies to the rebels
 by the patrolling of electri-
 fied border barriers.   In con-

 tively immobile French forces

 often lost the initiative to
 hit-and-run rebel bands,   the
 Challe plan stresses the en-
 gagement and'destruction of
 rebel units, as well as the
 rounding up of escapees.   By
 making effective use of hel-
 icopters and aerial  recon-
 naissance, Challe's "pursuit
 commandos" have had consider-
 able success in keeping rebel
 bands from escaping into the
 hills.
 Rebel Problems
 To date the rebels have
 been fskir2y successful in sup-
 plying and maintaining an army
 which appears to number between
 15,000 and 20,000 effectives,
 down from a 1956 peak of about
 40,000.   However, the rebels
 depend for both supplies and
 reinforcements on staging areas
 in Morocco and Tunisia, areas
 which have been increasingly
 denied them since the spring
 of 1959 by French border bar-
 riers.   These barriers,   to-
 gether with some reduction in
 the support given the rebels
 by the Moroccan and Tunisian
 governments, have forced the
 rebels to depend  on supply
 lines consisting  largely  of
 caravans south of the barri-
 ers, but even these have been
 subject to interception.
 In addition to supply dif-
 ficulties, the rebels have'had
 problems of morale and disci-
 pline.   Since the death in com-
 bat of several of the rebels'
 top field commanders  earlier
 this year, the percentage  of
 prisoners among rebel casual-
 ties has risen sharply; pris-
 oners.~ now comprise about a
 third of total rebel losses.
 Prospects
 Faced with the increased
 effectiveness of the Challe plan,
 the rebels until recently tended
 to split into small units to
 avoid capture and destruction.
 While this lessened their ef-
 fectiveness as a fighting force,
 activity by small groups in-
 creased their capability for
 terrorism and for sabotage of
 French installations.
 Since the 14 July attack
 in force on Ain Zana near the
 Tunisian border, however, the
 rebels may have become con-
 vinced that occasional large
 operations must be launched, if
 only for propaganda purposes.
 The rebels also appear to be
 attempting to provoke incidents
 between  French  and  Tunisian
 forces   along  Tunisia's bor-
 der  in                                                           order  to  enlarge
 the latter's    participation
 in  the  war  and  to  direct
 world  attention  on  Algeria
 before   the UN debate.
 Good weather   now  faeili-
 tateas                                                               French pursuit of reb-

 and  policing  of  barriers
 along  the  border.  The  French
 offensive  in  the  Kabylie
 mountain  area  of  eastern
 Algeria  appears         to  be an
 attempt  to  end  organized
 rebel  resistance  prior to the
 UN  debate,  and  the  French
 may,   for diplomatic  reasons,
 announce  the  defeat  of  the
 rebels  before  the  end  of

 rapid action impossible.   It
 was not until 1955 that the
 abolition of the zamindars sys-
 tem was accomplished in West
 Bengal--the last major state
 to enforce such legislation.
 The rights of the former
 zamindars, most of whom were
 permitted to retain their home
 farms, generally accrued to the
 states, and the only immediate
 benefit realized by the tenants
 was the elimination of the bur-
 densome charges in addition to
 rentals which the zamindars
 had customarily imposed. The
 tenants were usually given the
 right to become owners, but few
 could pay the necessary sums,
 and many came to believe that
 the reform had been of little

 benefit. The program did in-
 crease the revenues of the state
 governments and help establish
 a closer state-tenant relation-
 ship.,  Much of the new state
 revenue was used for agricul-
 tural development programs which
 aided the tenants.
 Tenancy Reform
 The abolition of the zamin-
 dars system removed only the up-
 permost layer of the interme-
 diaries between the state and
 the tenants.  Tenants who held
 land under the zamindars fre-
 quently leased it to subtenants.
 The same situation developed in
 non-zamindars lands where some
 landowners had large holdings.
 Thus much of the land remained
 cultivated by tenants, and re-
 forms were necessary to improve
 the status of the tenant.
 The tenancy reforms adopted
 generally fall into three groups:
 security of tenure, including
 the question of the landlord's

 if the government made a major
 effort to carry out the program.
 In contrast to the expan-
 sion of cooperatives, the lim-
 itation of landholdings would
 be unlikely to benefit Indian
 agriculture for some time.   If
 the ceilings on landholdings
 were low enough to be polit-
 ically effective in winning
 peasant support, it would take
 land away from both the rela-
 tively large landowners and
 the smaller ones who produce
 much of the food that supplies

 provide only about three acres
 per family for those families--
 about half of the total--which
 now have less than three acres
 of land.
 Even less realistic is the
 plan to set up joint farms,
 which appears to have been
 adopted without much thought
 as to how the scheme would work
 in practice.  Few joint farm-
 ing societies now in existence
 in India have been successful,
 and it seems unlikely that the
 numerous administrative and
 financial problems involved
 could be solved, even if the
 political opposition could be
 overcome.
 Nehru apparently believes,
 however, that such a program
 would increase crop yields. He
 probably also feels it would
 help the Congress party polit-
 ically by demonstrating its
 continued ability to think and

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 July 1959
 THE EAST GERMAN REFUGEE
 The continued flight of
 several hundred refugees from
 East Germany each day, follow-
 ing the more than 3,000,000
 who have fled to the West since
 World War II, indicates that
 14 years of Communist rule have
 failed to inculcate a universal
 belief in Communist ideology or
 satisfaction in Communist
 achievements.  Discontent and
 a hope for a better life lead
 the refugee to take serious
 risks, leave his possessions,
 and seek an uncertain future
 in West Germany.   Some become
 disillusioned and return to
 East Germany to face possible
 imprisonment.
 Who Is the Refugee?
 Most of the refugees are
 workmen, housewives, or clerks,
 but nearly every occupation
 has been represented, includ-
 ing police and the military.
 Most refugees have been adults
 aged 25 to 66 and children
 from 7,, to.. l4,years old.
 The most significant refu-
 gee today--because East Germany
 can ill afford to spare him--is
 the professional man, a doctor
 or teacher from a university or
 lower school.  Because great
 numbers in this category have
 fled, the East German regime
 is suffering serious manpower
 shortages, especially in the
 medical field, but also in the
 dental, pharmaceutic, engineer-
 ing, and technical fields.
 Motivation
 In general, the
 refugee flees because
 of personal griev-
 ances against the
 Communist system. He
 may be a farmer un-
 able to meet impos-
 sibly high delivery
 quotas.  He may be
 a small businessman
 faced with national-
 ization of his shop,
 or a worker fleeing
 constantly increas-
 ing work norms.  The
 refugee might:. be a

 youth escaping military service
 or the girl friend who follows
 him.  He may be an intellectual
 subjected to increasing pres-
 sures to compromise his pro-
 fessional standards, or a
 Christian escaping the, in-
 creasing atheistic pressures?
 He may simply have responded
 to the strong attraction of a
 prosperous West Germany.
 In the case of the refugee
 intellectual, there is often no
 single clear-cut motivation. A
 new development or changed cir-
 cumstance probably provides the
 immediate stimulus to flight.
 He may receive a summons to ap-
 pear before a party or govern-
 ment functionary to explain
 some previous statement or ac-
 tion.   Recent moves to Commu-
 nize educational institutions
 in line with the regime's ''poly-
 technical education" program
 may depress. him.  He may be
 physically or mentally exhausted
 by overwork or psychological
 harassment.  A party member
 with limited professional qual-
 ifications may be promoted over
 him.         Probably more important
 than any other reason is. the
 regime's deliberate and sys-
 tematic discrimination against
 his children in education.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 July 1959
 To be eligible for screen-
 ing through the emergency ad-
 mission procedure provided by
 West German law, the refugee
 has to leave East Germany per-
 manently and stay in the Fed-
 eral Republic or West Berlin.
 He is accepted as a "recognized"
 refugee if :   a) his life was
 endangered because he engaged
 in political activities in East
 Germany; b) he wants to be re-
 united with his family; or c)
 he can prove there is a job
 for him in the West so he will
 not become a public burden.
 If.:he.,does, trot meet',these
 requirements, he is a "nonrec-
 ognized" refugee who may  re-
 main in the West but will not
 get the assistance given recog-
 nized refugees.   However, the
 refugee authorities might grant
 him recognized status, if its
 denial would mean an extraordi-
 nary hardship to him.
 "The reu::gn: zed:;ref-
 ugee is usually flown
 to West Germany, at
 no expense to himself,
 and treated like any,
 other German citizen.
 He is given a resi-
 dence permit, permis-
 sion to work, or pos-
 sibly a pension, an-
 nuity, or social re-
 lief.   He may also
 stay in West Berlin,
 which takes 10 per-
 cent of the  recog-
 nized refugees    as
 its quota.
 The., -nenrecog-
 nized   escapee   is
 merely given refuge
 under the provisions of the
 West German public welfare laws
 which guarantee a minimum sub-
 sistence to each person in need.
 He is given food and lodging,
 medical service,  and,  if urgent-
 ly necessary, clothing or other
 items; if he is accommodated
 in a camp, he gets some  spend-
 ing  money.   Under  no              circum-
 stances  is he  compelled  to
 return to East Germany.
 While at Marienfelde, the
 refugee is interrogated by the
 three Western powers and  by
 West Berlin authorities for se-
 curity and intelligence infor-
 mation.
 Refugees in Berlin
 In addition to its 10-per-
 cent quota of recognized refu-
 gees, West Berlin is also re-
 sponsible for all nonrecognized
 refugees.   Furthermore, any
 refugee who elects to  remain
 in Berlin may do so, regardless
 of his status.
 The nonrecognized refugee
 is a serious burden on Berlin.
 Privileges accorded to recog-
 nized refugees but denied  to
 him include the right to ?vote,
 permission to hold a job, as-
 sistance in finding housing,
 Reception center in Berlin.
 and free transportation by air
 for resettling in West Germany.
 The nonrecognized refugee there-
 fore must decide whether to re-
 turn to the East,   go to West
 Germany on his own responsibility
 and expense, or remain in West
 Berlin. He may return to East Ger-
 many;  it is less likely that he
 will try to go on to West Germany.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 July 1959
 If the nonrecognized refu-
 gee chooses to remain in West
 Berlin, he is permitted to live
 and eat without charge in per-
 manent camps and to receive one
 dollar per month.   Legally he
 cannot hold a job, but the la-
 bor market has been invaded by
 nonrecognized refugees on an
 unofficial basis.   Since he
 cannot apply through the labor
 office for a job, he works be-
 low the legal minimum rate.
 The effect is not as great as
 might be expected, however, be-
 cause many such workers hold
 jobs in small Plants which sur-
 vive only because they can se-
 cure help at lower than the
 legal minimum.   Many of the
 nonrecognized refugee workers
 are domestic servants employdd
 by people who would dispense
 with this luxury if required
 to pay the legal rate.
 The refugee, whether he
 remains in Berlin permanently
 or temporarily, is probably
 housed in a camp.   He may go
 for two or three weeks to a
 transit camp where persons live
 during the screening process.
 His camp may be a former fac-
 tory, hastily improvised as an
 emergency shelter.  Or the
 refugee may go to a permanent
 camp, a smaller installation
 holding from 70 to 800 people,
 with somewhat primitive condi-
 tions.
 The refugee may live with
 relatives or friends, or, if
 lucky, be placed in an apart-
 ment.   Life in a camp inevita-
 bly causes lower morale, so
 the government is attempting
 to settle families in apartment
 buildings.
 Refugees in West Germany
 To cut down the process-
 ing in Berlin, the refugee may
 be flown to a camp in Giessen
 or Uelzen in West Germany where
 he completes his processing and
 is assigned a permanent loca-
 tion.   He may also be flown to
 a camp in whichever West German
 state has accepted him under a
 quota system.
 Since West German law ap-
 plies to East German citizens
 who come to Berlin or the Fed-
 era]'. Republic, the refugee may
 go directly to friends or rela-
 tives without registering in a
 camp.   He thus avoids the long
 stay in various camps and pos-
 sible assignment to undesirable
 locations and employment.   He
 may fly from Berlin to West
 Germany at his own expense; he
 might at a later date report to
 Giessen or Uelzen and be record-
 ed there.
 The principal problems for
 the refugee in West Germany are
 housing and employment, for
 which the state governments are
 responsible, but with help from
 the federal authorities.
 In general, the refugee
 will have little difficulty
 being resettled in West Germany,
 although in some states he will
 find housing inadequate and
 might have to remain in a camp
 for as long as two years or
 wait in Berlin to be flown to
 West; Germany.
 The refugee will have
 little trouble finding  a job
 in West Germany--on 30 June
 job openings there exceeded
 the number of unemployed per-
 sons.   He may, however, have
 difficulty in finding a job
 commensurate with his training
 or previous experience,and be-
 come! discontented.   Moreover,
 he may expect to improve his
 lot in West Germany without
 having a skill or training to
 offer.   Private organizations,
 particularly professional  .
 groups, will assist the govern-
 ment; in placing him in his pro-
 fession if he is qualified.
 Sometimes the refugee de-
 cides to go back to East Ger-
 many.   The reasons for such de-
 cisions are many and complex,
 but generally they add up to
 dissatisfaot'ion with conditions
 in the West or some compelling
 personal condition.
 The returnee may fall into
 the large group of adventurers
 who move back and forth across
 the border.   Possibly he com-
 mitted a criminal offense in

 THE BLOC'S FOREIGN MILITARY AID PROGRAM
 The Sino-Soviet bloc, since
 the start of its arms aid pro-
 gram in 1955, has extended more
 than one billion dollars in mil-
 itary assistance to underdevel-
 oped countries, particularly
 the .UAR, Iraq, Afghanistan,: and In-
 donesia`.   In addition, it has
 provided arms and materiel to
 Yemen, Algeria, Guinea, Finland,
 and Austria, and reportedly
 agreed recently to supply arms
 to Ethiopia.   Offers have also
 been made to provide-arms to
 a number of other countries,  in-
 cluding Tunisia, Burma, and
 some of the Latin  American
 republics.
 Military assistance to
 underdeveloped countries--a
 major factor in the bloc's pene
 tration drive--is relatively
 easy to implement and is of
 substantial propaganda value
 to the contributors.   Arms aid
 accounts for about one third
 of Sino-Soviet bloc aid of
 all types extended to underde-
 veloped countries but comprises
 more than one half of all aid
 actually delivered.
 The bloc has been able
 through its arms deals to con-
 tribute to its posture as a
 big-power supporter of nation-
 alism in the neutralist countries,
 thus assisting local Communists
 to attain political influence.
 Playing on the underdeveloped
 country's desire for manifesta-
 tions of independence, the bloc
 supplies it with symbols of
 national defense, regardless of
 the country's ability to fully
 use the arms.   The recipients
 of this aid become increasingly
 dependent on the bloc for the
 continued maintenance of their
 armed forces, and Moscow hopes
 they eventually will become
 more susceptible to bloc political
 pressures.
 Meanwhile,  the bloc,  os-
 tensibly remaining aloof from
 internal problems, can pose as
 the recipient country's best
 friend and stanchest supporter

 of its nationalistic struggle
 with  "the  imperialistic and
 capitalistic West."
 In negotiating its arms
 deals, the bloc has displayed
 a willingness to grant huge
 discounts--in some instances
 as  much  as  two  thirds  of
 quoted prices.   In addition,
 the bloc accepts partial, if
 not complete, repayment in
 surplus commodities rather
 than  demanding  full  payment
 in hard currencies.
 The export of arms is for
 the bloc a relatively inexpen-
 sive means of penetration.                 The
 continual re-equipping of the
 bloc's own armed forces with
 new models of weapons results
 in a sizable stockpile of ob-
 solescent items,
 While  Czechoslovakia and
 Poland have in the past "front-
 ed" for Moscow, the USSR has
 in the last year come to deal
 more directly with the coun-
 tries receiving bloc arms.  It
 supplies by far the greatest
 amounts of arms,accounting for
 more than two thirds of all the
 bloc arms delivered to the UAR,
 Iraq, Afghanistan, P .d Indonesia.
 Communist China now par-
 ticipates in the bloc's arms
 aid program and its role prob-
 ably will increase, particular-
 ly in Southeast Asia and in Al-
 geria, where lack of diplomat-
 ic ties obviates repercussions
 in relations with Prance.  Al-
 though China's arms aid to Al-
 geria and Indonesia has been
 limited, Peiping probably will
 attempt to increase its stature
 in Southeast Asia by offering
 additional aid to Djakarta.
 Technical Aid and  `raining
 In conjunction With the
 arms deals, the bloc also pro-
 vides technical assistance to
 the countries receiving arms.

 and members of the armed forces
 of these underdeveloped coup-
 tries provides opportunities for
 ideological indoctrination, es-
 pecially when such contact takes
 place inside the bloc.   Since
 the military groups in these
 underdeveloped countries have
 been traditional sources of
 authority, the effect of bloc
 training on future military
 leaders may be expected to in-
 fluence their political orienta-
 tion.   Bloc personnel both at
 home and abroad, however, ap-
 pear to have conducted them-
 selves in such a way as to a-
 void criticism.   The increased
 contacts with the military per-
 sonnel of the recipient coun-
 tries has not yet resulted in
 any obvious subversive attempts
 by bloc personnel.
 The UAR
 Since 1955 the bloc has
 provided Egypt and Syria, now
 the UAR, with arms, equipment,
 and training amounting to an
 estimated $700,000,000.  The
 bloc presumably will continue
 to supply arms and materiel to
 Since the .`format1,on of th&-
 UAR in 1958, Cairo has regulated
 the purchases of bloc arms for
 both regions, dealing  almost
 exclusively with" the  Soviet
 Union.  Moscow in turn has in-
 creasingly dominated the bloc's
 military assistance program in
 the  UAR during recent years.
 Despite the frictions
 caused by Nasir's anti-Communist
 campaign in the Middle East,
 the bloc has continued to pro-
 vide military aid to the UAR.
 The technical assistance phase
 of the bloc military aid pro-
 gram in the UAR has continued
 unhampered and appears even to
 have increased.   Moscow appar-
 ently intends to continue to
 depend on its economic and par-
 ticularly its military aid pro-
 grams in the UAR to maintain the
 close ties which had been shak-
 en by the exchange of recrimina-
 tions between Moscow and Cairo
 earlier this year.
 Iraq
 Iraq, the latest major
 recipient of bloc military
 assistance, concluded an arms
 deal with Moscow in late 1958
 The bloc, thus far,   is  esti-
 mated to have supplied Iraq with
 as much as $100,000,000 in arms
 and  materiel  since   deliver-
 ies of military equipment began
 late last year.   Additional
 shipments of materiel probably
 will continue to be delivered to
 Iraq throughout the remainder
 of 1959.
 Moscow, in its dealings
 with Iraq, has demonstrated
 the value the bloc leaders
 attach to their overseas arms
 aid program.  While the Soviet
 Union and other members of the
 bloc were in the process of
 granting recognition to the
 new Iraqi regime  and  also con-
 cluding trade agreements with
 it  Moscow in November 1958
 quickly arranged to provide
 arms to the Iraqi armed forces.
 Bloc arms and materiel began
 arriving immediately and mili-
 tary technicians and advisers
 were dispatched to Iraq.   It
 was not until March of this
 year that Moscow was able to
 extend a meaningful economic
 credit to Baghdad.   While the

 USSR is still in the
 survey stages of its
 economic aid program,
 bloc arms in large
 quantities are con-
 tinually arriving in
 Iraq.
 Afghanistan
 The bloc, par-
 ticularly the Soviet
 Union, has since 1956
 supplied Afghanistan
 with an estimated
 $75,000,000 in mili-
 tary assistance.   In
 addition the Soviet
 Union concluded a new
 arms agreement with
 Kabul in June of this
 year.   While  the
 scope of this agree-
 ment is not yet ap-
 parent, Moscow  pre-
 sumably will continue to grant
 substantial discounts to Kabul
 on its arms purchases.   This
 arrangement probably will per-
 mit Afghanistan to make mere
 token payments for the bloc
 military aid it is receiving
 while modernizing its armed
 forces.
 Other Recipients
 The bloc has  provided
 Yemen with more than $30,000,-
 i1 military aid under an
 agreement concluded in 1956
 with Czechoslovakia, but prob-
 ably financed:by:.Moscow.                                                           By
 early 1958, practically all the
 arms and equipment arranged for
 under this deal had been 'de-
 livered.
 The bloc made     gift  ship-
 ments  of  obsolete                                                                arms  to
 Guinea  earlier  this  year.
 The   value  of  these arms--
 estimated      at  $500,000--is
 insignificant in  comparison
 with   their     psychological im-
 pact.
 arms to Algeria via Egypt.
 The  Algerian    rebel  gov-
 ern e, earlier this year,  was
 granted an       estimated $5,-
 000,000 in  military  aid                                                                  by
 Communist China. Peiping's
 grant  was made  in response
 to  a  visit to  Communist
 China  by  a rebel  mission.
 A subsequent  rebel  mission
 visited China this spring, re-
 portedly to make arms purchases
 under Peiping's grant. China
 presumably will deliver the
