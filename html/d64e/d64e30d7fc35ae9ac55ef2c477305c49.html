 Post Office Answers
 To The Editor:
 With reference to the letter from Mr.
 S.F.  Wei  published  in  your  esteemed
 journal of the 12th instant under the
 caption  "Hongkong    Postage", complain-
 ing of the exorbitant rate of postage
 for printed matter for Hongkong, I have
 to inform you that the rates of postage
 for Hongkong and Macao are based upon
 the  Postal  Agreements  between   China
 and  Hongkong  and  China    and  Macao,
 which provide that, with the exception
 of letters and postcards which are charg-
 ed the domestic rates of postage, all other.
 categories of mail matter, special fees,
 etc. should be charged. according to the
 Union tariff of postage.  As newspapers,
 magazines and other printed matter do
 not fall under the categories of letters
 and -postcards, the International rates of
 postage apply  in accordance  with the
 provisions of the above-cited Agreement.
 It is, therefore, obvious that, under the
 restrictions  of the said Agreement, no
 unilateral action can be taken towards
 the modification of any of its stipula-
 tions.

 Fukien Defended
 To The Editor:
 In his article, "How Safe and Sound
 is Fukien," which appeared in the March
 12th issue of the Review, Mr. Lin has
 shown an extensive knowledge about my
 native province and his criticism is well-
 founded.  But in his eagerness to point
 out the weak points of the province, he
 has totally neglected the human factor,
 without which  the  world  would  be  a
 place of desolation.   e
 While it is true that Fukien has never
 played an important part in any of the
 wars, this was equally true of Kwang-
 tung province before the                      Republic  of
 China was established.   That the last
 emperor of the Sung dynasty preferred
 Kwangtung does not prove that this pro-
 vince was safer than  Fukien.   As                        a
 matter of fact, the dynasty had removed
 its capital southward many times before
 coming to Kwangtung, and sought a place
 of refuge rather than an advantageous
 position from which to launch an offen-
 sive.
 During the recent Sino-Japanese war,
 the Japanese not only seized Amoy but
 fortified the island and stayed there for
 the duration of the war.  Fukien's moun-
 tainous terrain and. unproductiveness was
 not a factor that kept the Japanese from
 invading that province.  Since they could
 strike at the Central Government with
 comparative ease  from   any point  other
 than Fukien, it would. have been foolish
 to operate out of a province where they
 were bound to encounter more difficulties.
 However, no place is worth much with-
 out  the human                      factor.    Look  at the
 state of Utah in America, popularly called
 "The Great American Desert," with its

 tainous  regions  and  soil  too  poor  to
 yield  any  crop,  it  now   thrives   and
 prospers through proper cultivation.   And
 Japan, with few natural resources, and
 soil saturated with volcanic ash, came to
 be one of the great powers of the world.
 Formosa, a wilderness, was built up to
 a rich productive island which contribut-
 ed greatly to the support of Japan before
 the war, and .ongkong, now called the
 Gibraltar of the East, has been developed
 into one of the greatest port cities of the
 world.  All this was not conjured up over
 night,  but  was  accomplished  by  great
 human effort.
 Many things have been possible despite
 poor natural resources and few advan-
 tages: Sun'Yat-sen's revolution was crad-
 led in Kwangtung where there was little
 to  work  with;  the  great  dynasty  of
 Ch'ing was founded in Shensi, certainly
 not one of the richest provinces in China;
 and the Communists have been fighting
 superior odds  under adverse conditions
 for more than 30 years, and have sur-
 mounted great difficulties.  If all this is
 possible, why can't the Kuomintang, with
 US aid behind them, do as well?  I am
 not a pro-party man, but I do    think
 the Kuomintang has a very good chance
 to win back if they work hard.   They
 certainly have better conditions now than
 their antagonists did four years ago. I
 agree that Fukien is not a. Normandy,
 and in the event of war between Russia
 and America, the latter would surely use
 Korea rather than  Fukien, and Japan
 rather than Formosa.   But the article
 was not discussing such a war, and in
 the meantime the two provinces of Fukien
 and Kwangtung have much to offer the
 Kuomintang.  If they fail, it is the fault
 of their leaders, mismanagement, despotic
 policy.  It all depends on how they exert
 themselves.

 Magazine Ban
 To The Editor:
 I was greatly shocked by the fact that
 a  number  of  'Shanghai   publications
 which spoke the people's view and had
 a great many readers have been forced
 to discontinue publication by the newly
 established  "cultural  control authority"
 of the. Nanking-Shanghai-Hangchow Gar-
 rison Headquarters.
 According to press reports, such maga-
 zines as World Culture, The Revelation,
 The Modern Woman, Outlook, The Uni-
 versity Review, and The Middle School
 Times were banned because they are con-
 sidered to be against  the martial law.
 But these magazines, it should be pointed
 out,  are  legal  and have      been  duly
 licensed by the Government authorities.
 These magazines have played a leading
 role  in  the present  culture  of China.
 They have suffered from economic hard-
 ships                                                                                                                     and, political  pressure  and   their
 closure at this time is hard to under-
 stand.                                                                                                                        It's clear that political pressure
 on the cultural organs is heavier than
 ever before, and it is rumored that press
 censorship may be re-introduced.
 This is what is behind the "honorable
 peace" about  which  there is  so  much
 talk.

 "The Spanish press has published the
 news of the $25,000,000 Chase Bank loan
 without comment.
 "Although financial circles were pleased
 at the  transaction, privately,  however,
 they were disappointed that it was neces-
 sary to mortgage  Spain's gold reserves.
 "It was hoped the Chase deal will serve
 'to break the ice' toward granting Spain
 an official American loan really big en-
 ough             to revive  the  country's  heavy  in-
 dustry,               agriculture,  and  transportation
 which, as interpreted here, is a dire neces-
 sity not only for Spain but also for the
 general rehabilitation program in western
 Europe.
 "(A spokesman for the  Chase   Bank
 said  the loan  had been granted after
 consultation with  and approval by the
 US  State  Department.)"
 I ani quite taken aback by the views
 expressed  by   you in connection with
 this unholy project.  You risk prosecu-
 tion by the Un-American Activities Com-
 mittee and the horrible threat never to
 be admitted to occupied Japan and Ger-
 many in case you finally realize that all
 "really" bad Fascists have reformed, and
 that the safest place in the face of the
 Red Menace is the US zone of Germany,
 Japan, and Spain in that order.
 I just came back from there.  Nazism
 was a good idea badly carried out.

 New TB Drug
 To The Editor:
 The  seriousness  of  the      tuberculosis
 problem may be seen by figures compiled
 in 1946 by the United Nations Health
 Investigation Office, which estimated that
 some  300  out  of  every  100,000  persons
 die from this disease each year.  If this
 estimate is     accurate, at least 1,500,000
 persons in      China die from TB yearly.
 The Svenska Lacartidin Magazine 43,
 2029-41, 1946, reported that 'a physician
 in the  Sahlgrenska  Hotal in        Sweden
 named Dr. Jorgen Lehmann had utilized
 a para-amino-salicylic-acid preparation to
 treat tuberculosis and had achieved very
 effective results.
 I  was  therefore very  glad  to      learn
 from an advertisement; in the       Chinese
 papers that the Grena Chemical Works,
 a. Chinese medical factory, may be able
 to make a P.A.S. solution     prepared by
 Professor Wong-Shao-ting, since its price
 will be much cheaper than that imported
 from abroad.
 Since  the  demand  for       P.A.S.  is  so
 great and I earnestly hope that our own
 medical factory can increase the produc-
 tion of P.A.S.

 New Education
 To The Editor:
 A schoolmate of mine has just come
 down from the liberated areas to see his
 mother.  He told me the following about
 secondary  education  under  the  New
 Democracy:
 At an educational conference held last
 winter by the authorities of the North-
 east             and        North  China.  areas, middle
 school policy was discussed and certain
 principles laid down.
 The greatest difference between educa-
 tion here and in the liberated areas is
 that students there must work to earn

 t
 they spend half of       tch  day on such
 labor, their records d-  not seem to be
 any worse than  tho-   of  students in
 KMT-controlled areas.
 Textbooks  in  comp    courses such  as
 politics, history and the national language
 are being revised, but   he others are not
 changed.
 School   affairs- are  decided  by  the
 School Affairs Ruling CoAmittee which
 consists of six teacher ; and one or two
 students.  This  body    has  the highest
 authority in the school
 I have described th use methods with
 the  idea  that they  !tight  possibly be
 applied to middle scho ds here as a pro-
 gressive reform.

 So-called Reforms
 To The Editor:
 What has happened  to  the  reforms
 issued  by  Acting President  Li  Tsung-
 jen?                                                                                                                       One of them  provides for    the
 abolition of special criminal courts. These
 coltrts have been abolished, all right, but
 in their place has been established mili-
 tary courts with the privilege of execut-
 ing people "on the spot."                                                                                                                   The summary
 executions of 21 persons in Kunming and
 three bus workers in Shanghai illustrate
 how these courts work.
 A second reform was the lifting of
 restrictions  on  newspapers  and  maga-
 zines.   However, the banning and con-
 fiscation  of newspapers  and magazines
 has been renewed in Shanghai.      Thou-

 tines" were confiscated by the police and
 garrison authorities on March 17.,  These
 magazines contained a number of articles
 that were pro-Communist or critical of
 the Government, and many of them may
 not have been based on fact.     However,
 their wide circulation  is an indication
 of the frame  of mind of the general
 public, and the policy of banning or con-
 fiscating them is an ill-advised one which
 has not worked in the past.
 Despite the promised cession of acti-
 vities  of KMT  secret agents, the dis-
 appearance of people is on the march
 again.   It is rumored that a delegate
 of a shipping company in Shanghai was
 arrested soon after his return from Pei-
 ping, where he had contacted Communist
 leaders.
 These developments, together with many
 other oppressive measures, go to show that
 the diehards and reactionaries are not
 willing to have any house-cleaning pre-
 paratory to peace talks with the Com-
 munists.  They have never wanted peace;
 they want a hushed silence under threat
 of imprisonment, torture and death.

 Chungking Bombing
 To The Editor:
 I don't know what the B-24 bombar-
 diers could have  been thinking  about
 when they bombed the Chungking. I
 should like to ask them  whether they
 thought it was for the good of the na-
 tion.  China cannot make any warships
 and it is hard to say when this loss to
 our country can be made up.  I believe
 that the  bombardiers were  disloyal to
 their country  although they might  be
 said to have been loyal to the KMT.
 I am sure that th     Chinese Civil War
 is not likely to be  von by aviators or
 the navy or by for?ign loans.  Only a
 Government which  is  championed by the
 people can win,  arr  the action of the
 KMT in bombing     u trships of  its own
 country will surely de rease its champions.
 It is interesting tc note that the Chi-
 nese airmen rode on American planes to
 bomb a British war. hip.  It is now re-
 ported that two more warships presented
 to us by America, ar, , to be anchored at
 Kaohsiung in a few days.  Whether or
 not  these  two  shit;  will repeat  the
 tragedy of the Chun; king no one knows.

 I hope I can read the Review always.
 But now my finances have failed  and
 1 am obliged to bid you farewell.
 China, as well as the world, is. now
 facing a fearful  storm and  the  grey
 clouds gather in every corner. We cc; t_

 will come or in what way, and can cnly

 is the very one to help us during this
 stormy period of time.
 I often have read that some of your
 readers get free copies through the con-
 tributions of other readers, and that old
 copies are sent to needy readers.  Now,
 since I am in distress, I can only wish
 luck might fall upon me.

 Missing Persons
 To The Editor:
 In spite of Acting President Li Tsung-
 jen's directive against illegal arrests, four
 persons are missing here:  Two teachers,
 a student  of the  Shanghai  College of
 Law, and an employee of the District
 Government.
 Mr. Li Tze-cheng, head of discipline of
 the Provincial Chuchow Normal School,
 was visited by plain clothesmen who said
 several students of the  Normal  School
 had been taken to Garrison Headquarters
 because they had quarreled with some-
 body in a theater.  They requested that
 he go with them to see these students.
 Ile wanted to call the roll first, but they
 would not permit him to do so.  When
 he had not returned by the next morning,
 the principal of the school went to the
 Garris=on Headquarters and was told they
 knew nothing of Mr. Li's whereabouts.
 Mr. Wang Do-hsiang, a history teacher
 at the Provincial Chuchow Middle School,
 was chatting at home with his wife and
 a younger sister when plain clothesmen
 entered the house under the pretext of
 checking the census.   They pointed to
 his younger sister and asked who she
 was.   Mr. Wang explained and said she
 was studying at the  Yu-Nong  Middle
 School where she was to return the next
 day.   The plain clothesmen would not
 accept this  explanation and took him
 away with them.
 The student, Mr. Chen Nan-hsiang, also
 was taken away by plain clothesmen act-
 ing as census takers, who charged him
 with housing persons without registering
 them with the census authorities.   His
 elder brother wanted to go instead but
 was not permitted.   He followed    Mr.
 Chen to the Garrison Headquarters but
 was refused entrance. Later he was told
 his brother was not there.

 "Wet Firewood"
 To The Editor;
 Present indication < are that the Gold
 Yuan has got out   'f control.  At very
 short intervals, GY totes of $5, $20, and
 $50 denomination   lave passed  out of
 circulation.  And  y ^sterday,  barely  a
 fortnight after GY ':50 notes were pooh-
 poohed as "wet firer ood", GY $100 notes
 were being widely  ejected in everyday
 business transaction  here in this town
 of Dan Shui  Hon,  Hoiping.     The local
 bankers  and mercl ants  are    hurriedly
 shipping huge amounts of these unwant-
 ed notes to Kougmo In or Canton, where
 they are said to be still accepted, to be
 dumped on the mnl kete. there.
 From my obscrvat ons I find that small
 notes first were reused in the country-
 side, the rejection sp ?eading to the larger
 places.  This state a` affairs implies that
 the people in far-lung places have be-
 come extremely nerv:,us about possession
 of GY notes and have learned from ex-
 perience that they  an turn into waste
 paper over night.
 Also it is interesti'g to note that even
 before the $1,000 n tes are brought in
 here, the $100 not(: are being rejected,
 and the only ones _lsable are the $500
 notes.   It look;: her  as if the peoples'
 rejection of the (i" may move faster
 than    the  Govcrnvu nt  can  issue  new
 notes.

 Yenchow Bandits
 To The Editor:
 Recently many bandit  outrages  have
 occurred in this city of Yenchow, and in
 the surrounding countryside. They have
 entered the hous.ps and robbed the people
 of their rice, money and gold.    Many
 very rich men have received anonymous
 letters from the bandits demanding more
 gold and rice.  Many of these men have
 paid so the bandits would not kill them
 and burn their houses.
 This  situation  is  a  disgrace  to  the
 whole nation.   The provincial authorities
 of Chekiang and the troops stationed in
 this area should be held responsible for
 these incidents.
 The   bandits are neither  Nationalists
 nor Communists.  We are, told by news-
 papers that the bandits are mostly sol-
 diers who have been paid off, and that
 the more soldiers we pay off, the more
 bandits will be let loose.

 Pacific  Pact
 T HE official announcement of the Atlantic Pact
 was the signal for an all-out campaign by
 various interested parties to persuade the non-
 communist powers with interests in Asia to unite
 in a Pacific version of the Atlantic defense plan.
 We don't like the Atlantic Pact, but we'd like a
 Pacific Pact even less.  While. the Atlantic Pact
 is the latest in a series of moves designed to tor-
 pedo the United Nations, it at least has the
 blessings of governments put in office by fully
 sovereign countries, regardless of how naive or
 unenlightene4their respective electorates may be.
 The most vociferous appeals for a Pacific Pact,
 however, come from the capitals, of European
 colonial powers who are afraid that they are
 about to lose something to which they have no
 legitimate rights.
 The campaign to induce Uncle Sam to pull
 a few colonial chestnuts out of the fire began a
 long time ago and has been increasing in intensity
 in almost direct ratio to the advance of the Chi-
 nese Communists from the north.  In the Feb-
 ruary 5 issue of the Review we warned that
 European .powers with colonial holdings in Asia,
 aided and abetted by individuals and organiza-
 tions in America and other non-colonial countries,
 were plotting a means whereby America's money
 and materials could be sucked into a Pacific plot
 to preserve colonialism.  At that time we said:
 "The trap, laid snugly in. the various colonies, is
 being artfully baited with the red flag bearing
 the hammer and sickle and the European coloni-
 alists are waiting behind the bushes for the
 American bull, who seems to go completely
 berserk at the sight of anything red, to charge
 in and solve the crisis."
 In the few weeks that have passed since
 then, the campaign has reached a new tempo.
 Almost every day the newspapers are full of
 scare headlines over stories-largely undocument-
 ed-telling how the Chinese Reds are plotting
 revolution and anarchy throughout Asia.  The
 pressure has become so strong that the few in-
 dependent countries that exist in Asia today
 have begun red witch hunts of their own, im-
 munist Asia has worked itself into a frenzy in
 an effort to impress Uncle Money Bags that it,
 too, is against communism and thereby is de-
 serving of a handout of US dollars.
 A most unholy trinity composed of European
 colonialists, misguided and/or corruption ridden
 native governments, and American vested in-
 terests are working night and day to involve the
 United States in a most foolish adventure in
 Asia.  Whether they will succeed in their plot
 remains to be seen.  Meanwhile it is well to be
 advised of their doings.
 The most prominent position in this campaign
 is held by France, a country whose bankrupt
 colonial policy in Asia is apparent to all.  For
 about three years the French have been trying
 to impose their repressive rule on Indo-China.
 Today, the French are on the brink of being
 thrown out of Indo-China by the Vietnam re-
 sistance movement.  With a Communist China
 in the offing, a Vietnam victory is  assured.
 Fr ante's only chance now is for America to save
 her colony for her. To this end, the French
 propaganda machinery has been working over-
 time grinding out story after story about the
 Red menace in Asia, %how French democracy is
 on the verge of extinction in Indo-China, how
 China's Reds, who are nothing but Moscow's
 hirelings, are unfairly aiding the Indo-Chinese
 in, their fight.  All of this, of course, is pure
 hogwash.  The French are taking a beating and
 are looking for help.
 One excellent example of how the colonialists
 twist the news was contained in a United Press
 story from London on March 24, written by
 Harold Guard, one of UP's staff correspondents.
 Guard  reported :  "Intelligence  reports  from
 Indo-China said today that Chinese Communists
 from Yunnan Province have joined Vietnam
 guerrillas in fighting French colonial forces."
 The story then gave details of border attacks
 from China, saying, "Chinese Communists now
 control half 'of Yunnan.... 70,000 Communists
 (are)  moving to occupy six important towns
 within easy reach of Indo-China by road and
 river."
 The first thing that is wrong with this story
 is that it comes from "intelligence" sources.  No
 matter whether they are French or British, they
 are obviously suspect in this case since both are
 official agencies of governments which have ac-
 tively been playing up. the red threat in Asia
 for their own partisan ends.  To readers here
 in China, it is useless to point out the many
 other errors in the- story.  Correspondent Guard,
 perhaps, may be pardoned for not knowing his
 Chinese geography or for not being familiar with
 the many revolts-only some of which are Com-
 munist led-in Kuomintang areas of China.  How-
 ever, he also should know better than to write
 about China from London, especially if he has
 no more reliable sources than French or British
 secret police organizations.
 The Siamese have not been far behind the
 French in their yelping about the dangers of
 the reds.   The Siamese Government, which is
 prisoning in some cases thousands of their own    not known for its eficiencw~,  ossibly has two

 anti-communist bandwagon so as to be in a posi-
 tion to grab off its share of the money which
 it is confidently hoped Uncle Sam will dish out.
 The other could be to seize a fine opportunity for
 obtaining outside support for a continuation of
 its long-time campaign against the large Chinese
 minority in the country.  According to- press re-
 ports, virtually all of Siam's estimated 4,000,000
 people of Chinese descent may be- considered
 suspect.,  Government spokesmen have talk=ed
 loudly of the communist menace and have re-
 marked pointedly that the monstrous doctrine of
 Marxism has little appeal for Siamese, being
 confined almost entirely to the country's Chinese
 community.  Viewed in the light of past actions
 of the Siamese Government, this sudden concern
 over Communism is merely another chapter in
 a long history of pogroms against the Chinese
 minority.
 The Philippine Government apparently does
 not wish to be left out and' has joined the
 scramble.  According to daily press  reports,
 Manaila is rapidly discovering that the Hukbala-
 hap rebellion is not so much a result of the
 government's inability to  solve  its landlord-
 peasant problems as it it the direct result of
 foul instigation by the numerous communists
 among the islands' Chinese population.
 The  ability  of the  Chinese Communists
 should not be underestimated, but we wonder if
 these people, who have yet to bring the major
 portion of China under their control, are capable
 of turning all of Asia upside down through such
 extensive operations as some would have us be-
 lieve.

 Self Help
 W ~'-` E have discussed the question of self help
 W upon several past occasions, usually point-
 ing out that no amount of foreignaid could solve
 China's many complex economic problems unless
 an energetic program of self help were inaugurated.
 Such a belief can scarcely be questioned, but the
 argument usually has arisen over whether or
 not the Government actually has attempted to
 help itself.  Official sources, quite naturally, have
 maintained that the Government was exploring:
 all, possible avenues in its search for methods of
 obtaining aid within this country and that only
 the Civil War has prevented China from pulling
 herself up by her own boot straps.  Others have
 maintained that there was little or no evidence
 of self help or that efforts directed toward that
 end were entirely too puny.  Some critics have     may give an inkling of how the question of self
 h    d th
 l
 of deliberate misuse of foreign aid.
 Personally, we have been of the opinion that
 precious little effort has been or is being made
 to develop internal sources of aid, while the
 existence of waste in handling foreign aid is
 evident to all but the blind.  This is not to say
 that the Chinese Government has not recognized
 the need for helping itself by using indigenous
 methods and materials for reconstruction and re-
 habilitation.  However, it does appear that the
 matter has gone no farther than the "recogni-
 tion" stage. We have yet to see any evidence
 that this administration has. been able to or-
 ganize itself sufficiently for " effective action.
 Thousands of tons of rotting and rusting materials
 and  machines, piled  in  huge  storage areas
 throughout the country, bear ample testimony
 to the Government's poor use of outside aid.
 There are, we know, many standard reasons
 advanced as to why such materials have not been
 used. It is said that the materials themselves
 are unsuited to China, that the machines were
 not in working order, that the Government had
 no money to finance the distribution of the sup-
 plies, etc.  A trip through any of these storage
 depots, however, will illustrate the flimsiness of
 such statements and adequately show that they
 are at best very poor excuses for a seemingly
 complete inability for organization.
 The continued existence of these depots,
 filled with materials which in some cases arrived
 in this country more than three years ago, is
 a visible indictment of the administration.  The
 claim by officialdom that the materials are not
 usable in this country can easily be disproved
 by a walk through any of the several so-called
 thieves' markets in Shanghai, where salvaging
 and improvisation, developed to an astounding
 degree of perfectio , may be seen.  For instance,
 the fact that the glass craftsmen have developed
 a. technique whereby the smallest pieces of broken
 window pane can be salvaged and made into use-
 ful articles testifies to the truth of the saying
 that nothing in this country need be wasted. The
 blocks-long sidewalk markets where gears, bear-
 ings, chains, and all sorts of machine parts are
 bought and sold and bartered, is proof that the
 small Chinese merchant can, if circumstances
 permit, organize his activities in such fashion as
 to fulfill a public need.  The people have the
 ability and the organization to use the materials,
 no matter how small.  It is only the Govern-
 ment, undecided and uncertain, which perches
 atop valuable materials like a hen sitting on
 infertile eggs which eventually will rot and be-
 come useless.
 Is it any wonder, then, that an administration
 which is incapable of making good use of materials
 given it has difficulty in discovering ways and
 means of helping itself?

 The China Weekly Review, April 2, 1949
 the Reds will have to accomplish all their re-
 habilitation  and reconstruction aims through
 self help.  How well they will be able to organize
 themselves and how fast they will be able to
 proceed toward their announced goal of increas-
 ing production and making a better life for the
 people remains to be seen.  However, it does
 appear that they have gone the Nationalists at
 least one step better by making an effort to do
 something.
 One story from Manchuria tells how the
 workers in the state-owned fa.rm implement
 factory in Harbin recently perfected two new
 farm machines.. One was a horse-drawn soya
 bean harvestor which is said to harvest more
 than eight acres of beans a day.  The other, a
 threshing machine drawn by a four horse team,
 can handle more than three tons of grain per
 day.  The story ends on a characteristic note:
 "Only after the agrarian reform did the farmers
 in Manchuria begin to have the spare cash for
 new machinery."
 This seems to us to be a very significant
 story.  With reform of the land tenure and the
 tax systems, the farmer's living standard is
 raised, and as soon as this is done, the state
 factories begin turning out improved machines
 for him to buy which will in, turn increase his
 productive powers and, presumably, his income.
 In Manchuria the Chinese Communists found
 precious little in the way of ready made capital.
 In fact, the area had been pretty well stripped
 of its industrial machine by Russian confiscation
 and local looting, not to mention the American
 bombing during the war.  Presumably, the Com-
 munists had to start pretty much from scratch.
 They reformed the land system and then, with
 the farmer's economic condition already slightly
 improved 'and with cash in his pocket for the
 first time, set about making labor saving ma-
 chinery to- sell him.
 Contrast this to the extensive agricultural
 improvement system blueprinted for National-
 ist areas.  The emphasis was all on foreign
 help, foreign technicians, foreign money, for-
 eign machines.  The foreigners, their machines
 and their money, all arrived, but what has
 been the result? True, some organizations, such
 as the NAEC, have been set up and are function-
 ing.  However, what about the farmer?  Shack-
 led with the old evils of tenancy, heavy and
 unjust taxes, and occupying a social position but
 little better than that of a serf, these improve-
 ments on the whole have been of little help to
 him. Hundreds of tractors were brought to
 China, but how many have been put into use?
 Some are used by Government organizations, but
 we would guess that scarcely any have. actually
 been put to the use for which they were intended.
 Take another example.  From Kaifeng it
 is reported that the People's Government has
 completed the dredging of the Hui-Chi Canal
 which passes through the city.  Un-dredged for
 10 years, its overflow had inundated the flatlands
 surrounding the town, thus making unworkable
 one-fourth. of the area which in. the past used to
 the unemployment of an estimated 1,2010 salt
 workers.
 The  dredging was  accomplished. by  the
 mobilization of 5,000 workers found without jobs
 when the Reds took over the city.  One might
 be tempted to ask why the Nationalist adminis-
 tration of this city, which was in occupation
 about three years after VJ Day and which pre-
 sumably had at its disposal all sorts of mech-
 anical dredging and other equipment as gifts
 from UNRRA or secured through surplus pro-
 perty deals, failed to undertake the job?  How
 is it that a Communist administration, working
 without the aid of foreign tools to lighten the
 work, was able to undertake and complete the
 job in a matter of months?  Surely the Reds
 had to face at least as many obstacles as the
 Nationalists.
 There are many possible explanations, of
 course, for this seeming ability of the Com-
 munists to pitch into a job and get it done.  One
 very likely one is easily explained by the old
 adage about how a new broom sweeps cleaner
 than an old one, meaning that people new to
 power are on the whole more earnest in their
 administration, more efficient and more deter-
 mined to please than an old gang which has be-
 come so accustomed to ruling that, it has, for-
 gotten the importance of popular goodwill.
 Another reason, perhaps, is that faced with
 the prospect of gaining control of a China which
 will be cut off from the American dole, the Com-
 munists realize that any improvements to be
 made must be brought about by their own efforts
 and that, therefore, they have to get busy and
 do what they can with the materials on hand.
 The KMT, on the other hand, has not really had
 to get out and dig for the past few years be-
 cause it seemed certain that Uncle Sam could be
 counted upon to provide the money and direction.
 A still further possibility-and the one
 which we believe is the most important-is that
 the. Communists are by nature a very realistic
 bunch not given to living in a dream world filled
 with wonderful paper plans for the future.  At
 the present moment they are viewed by many
 as a huge colossus from the north which is about
 to shove the tottering Kuomintang aside and
 swallow the country.  However, it should be re-
 membered that their dominance of the scene is
 a quite recent affair. As recently as -a' year or
 two ago there were many people who would not
 have given the Communists much of a chance.
 Ever since 1927 the odds have been weighted
 heavily in favor of the KMT.  Purged from the
 Government, defeated militarily time and again
 until finally surrounded in a small pocket in
 Kiangsi in 1930, the Communists have been on
 the verge of complete defeat countless ,times.
 When the Generalissimo drove them into the
 barren north Shensi countryside in 1935, most
 observers felt that the end was in sight.  Even
 many of their supporters and friends thought
 that all was up with the Reds.  However, they
 seem to have come through very well.
 The reason fore their success, we believe,
 lies not so much in the fact that they are com-

 Thy China Weekly Review, April 2, 1949
 many lands, as it does in the fact that the Corn
 munists realized that if they were to exist at
 all, they had to provide a platform that was
 popular with the broad mass of the. people.
 Whether the platform was a pr` oper "red" one
 or not was unimportant.  What was important
 was., that it give the people a better deal.  Boiled
 down to one essential, the Communists' program
 meant reform.  There is a lot of loose talk about
 the excesses of the Chinese Communists, their
 atrocities against "the people," etc.       However,
 the fact remains that there is ample evidence
 that in areas where they have assumed control,
 they have been active reformers of the social,
 economic, and political scene.  People fleeing the
 Reds have told of their brutality, their iron rule,
 and so on.  However, it would seem that the
 mass of the people must like what the Com-
 munists have been doing.                     Otherwise, why would
 they support them and enable them to rise to
 their present powerful position?
 Suppose that all the stories of Communist
 atrocities were correct.  Suppose that the Com-
 munists actually had killed all the landlords and
 their families and divided up their wealth among
 the tenants.  Who would really care, aside from
 the landlords and those closely connected with
 them; a group consisting of perhaps 15 or 20
 percent of the population.  Observers who de-
 plore bloodshed might well object, but the vast
 majority of the population, which will benefit
 thereby, can hardly be expected to offer serious
 opposition to such a program.
 Since there seems ample evidence that these
 "excesses" which have been made so. much of
 by the KMT and others have been few and far
 between and that the Reds reform measures on
 the whole have been rather orderly, it would
 appear that the extreme realism school of thought
 has triumphed.  Forced by circumstances - a.:
 much as anything else - to give good govern-
 ment and to face problems realisticly, the Com-
 munists have won out against seemingly over-
 whelming obstacles.  The few reports of achieve-
 ments now reaching Shanghai from areas more
 recently taken over seem to confirm this view.
 The Reds are giving good, efficient, and honest
 government.  A few, especially those who have
 battened off the peasants and the workers in
 the past, find that there is no place for them
 in the Communist's scheme of things and have
 come running to Shanghai and other havens
 with howls   of anguish.  The vast majority,
 however, appears to be staying put and to be
 enjoying such improvements as canal dredging,
 land redistribution, higher income and supplies
 of better farming tools.
 From the little evidence now available one
 might hazard a guess that the day of self help
 is approaching.  Its arrival will satisfy a lot of
 people and at the same time will confound a
 great many, especially those who have heard ex-
 cuses for so long that they have come to believe
 that the Chinese were a special breed of people

 Peace Plan Contest
 The various manuscripts received in the Review's contest
 for a best and most practical Peace Plan for China have at
 lost been translated into English or into Chinese as the case
 may be and turned over to the judges ...... The widespread
 interest which the. Review's contest has aroused throughout
 China is indicated in the number of letters which are being
 received...... One letter this week from Mr. Wilfredo T. Ty,
 editor of the Fukien Star of Foochow, reads in part:
 .....if you ever wish to be of any use in China, my
 Challenge is, do something for the next generation.   Invest
 your fortune in the next generation and thus be assured of
 twofold greater returns.  We already know enough about the
 nature of the human youth to supply us for a long time to
 come with a working basis for his direction and improvement.
 Our point of greatest interest is of course the prevention of
 the young from taking up the ways which are deplored in
 the conduct of the adult and further to develop in them in-
 dependent judgment, the power of sustained and self-directed
 activity in enlarging social relationships, the ability to grow
 in co-operation with, and not in opposition to, the rest of
 their countrymen.  In other words, to develop in them a new
 morality.   When this, and a few other reforms have been
 accomplished, then many if not all of the evils which now
 afflict China will vanish or remedy themselves automatically.
 Then and only, then will China be at peace."
 Opium Business
 The Anti-Opium Bureau in Canton has claimed the exclu-
 sive right of preparing opium for  sale in  the  city.   The
 Bureau is preparing daily 4,000 ounces of opium, making a
 profit of $8,000 every day, when all products are disposed of.
 The prepared opium is being sold from $11 to $5.50 an ounce
 according to grade and origin.

 Industrialization Of Siberia
 Agricultural production in eastern Siberia has increased
 five times over the previous output, coal production has in-
 creased four times  and scores of  new mines  with modern
 technical equipment have been opened in the Irkutsk region,
 according to the report of Kachalin, the Communist delegate
 at the 18th Communist  Congress recently held in Moscow.
 ITe said that Eastern Siberia has become a flourishing industrial
 country where thousands of tractors, harvesting combines and
 other  complicated  agricultural  machines  work  on  collective
 farms.  Gross industrial output had increased more than 200
 percent, providing a firm foundation for future development
 of the region as well as strengthening the defense power or
 the Soviet Union in the. Far East.
 Puppet Nanking
 Nanking made much fuss and noise on the occasion of
 the  first  anniversary  (March  28)  of  the  creation  of  the
 so-called "Reformed Government" by the Japanese.
 Failing in repeated efforts to erect a unified structure
 fir  the  control  of the various  rival  regional  groups,  the
 Japanese are now trying to make Nanking the center of their
 future political intrigues.   This is revealed in   a statement,
 ir;sued by the Nanking regime, announcing that plans for the
 organization   of  a  central administration  are  nearing  com-
 pletion, the fundamental principle of such an administration
 being close cooperation with Japan and its ultimate objective,
 the establishment of a new order in East Asia.
 With  the  assistance  and  under  the        direction  of  the
 Japanese Government, the statement claimed, Nanking and its
 affiliated groups made marked progress during the year.      But

 Journey To hied Shantung
 IN Tsingtao, where dispirited Na-
 tionalists      and                       uncertain  Amer-
 icans await the Communists, infor-
 mation about how                             to  cross to the
 Communist lines is as plentiful as
 beggars and deteriorating US-made
 materiel.  This information  is  not
 always reliable, but  getting to the
 Communists is so easy that it does
 not matter very much.   Larry Tighe,
 a   businessman  and  writer,  Henri
 Cartier-Bresson, a     Magnum photo-
 grapher, and I crossed  over pain-
 lessly in a jeep on February 10th.
 We  were  escorted  through      the
 Nationalist lines by a staff officer
 who took the precaution of substitut-
 ing a private's cap for his, own.                At
 Chimo, some 30 miles northwest of
 Tsingtao,  the commanding general
 told us without fervor over    lunch
 that the Reds might shoot us.    "On
 this side is freedom; on the other,
 tyranny," he remarked. We spent the
 night at the Nationalist outpost of
 Lingshan, a fortified village.
 The next morning we drove slowly
 into no man's land, along the rutted
 road of a brown, tarred. valley, pass-
 ing the indigo figures  of  peasants
 who grinned at us..  When we saw
 people in the distance, we slowed the
 jeep to a crawl, and Cartier-Bresson
 and I walked in front of it, waving
 a white flag.  But we went through
 several villages without meeting any-
 body except little knots of curious
 peasants  and   groups  of  racing
 children.
 In a village eight or 10 miles from
 Lingshan  we    met  a  blue-clothed
 militiaman with a Japanese rifle. He
 grinned, got in the jeep and 'took us
 on to the next village where at last
 we saw the padded yellow uniforms
 of the People's Liberation Army.
 We stayed in this village a week,
 living  in  battalion   headquarters.
 Two officers came and  interviewed
 us in Japanese,` and a day or so later
 an  English-speaking    hsien official
 interviewed  us  more  thoroughly.
 This official took us on  about 10
 miles to a village   suburb  of  the
 county seat of  East Pingtu.  Here
 we waited a fortnight vainly for a
 reply to our request to proceed to
 Tsinan.  This request was transmit-
 ted through official channels to the
 East China and North China gov-
 ernments,  both of  which, we dis-
 covered later, were being  moved.
 Another factor hindering  quick ac-
 tion was the inadequacy                   of com-
 munications,  which    bear a. heavy
 military and administrative burden.
 After a fortnight I was obliged to
 give up, the idea of continuing to
 Tsinan and requested permission to
 return  to Tsingtao. This   request,
 too, was transmitted to  the    East
 China and North China governments.
 It was granted after  another two
 weeks, and on March 18th the three
 of us drove back to Tsingtao, again
 crossing the lines without incident.

 During our five v eeks' stay in the
 two Red villages w  were restricted
 most of the time t , the compounds
 in which we  livrd.  The  officials
 explained that   th !y had to  ob-
 tain authorization                                                         before we could
 go about freely. Trey also express-
 ed the fear that                                                        ve might be at-
 tacked by Kuoraintt rg terrorists, as,
 they declared, two Catholic.  priests
 had been  som.'  t: me  before.    We

 all soldiers, official: and  peasants

 the best possible i'h od and lodging,
 and allowed to sei d whatever tele-
 grams and letters v e wished into the

 fully to pay for o it                                                             lodging and
 food.  "There is i o    provision for
 payment, and no o ie ever has," an
 official told us.  Orr offers of gaso-
 line and tools wcr                                                               also rejected
 politely.  At last wf forced our hosts
 to accept a medical kit, by threaten-
 ing to throw it                                                            it  a ditch on our

 were healthy; earn 'st and cheerful.
 They were well-unformed and fed,
 and their arms. th 'ugh  presumably
 inferior to those is sued to the 'field
 armies, were zealoisly tended.   We
 watched squads of  hem practice field
 stripping  light   n achine   guns  in
 freezing   weather.   Recruits were

 organization of th,   People's Bank
 is a big step towar:l the stabilization
 of the currency," he added pride-
 fully.
 In the evenings  t    courier would
 come on a bicycle     with mail and
 copies of the local   newspaper, the.
 Giao Dung Pao.  .c little  knot of
 soldiers would read the paper by the
 light of a peanut oil lamp  which
 cast giant shadowe on the earthen
 walls.  Sometimes the paper would
 publish a new  som.g,  and the sol-
 diers would puzzle mut the tune and
 then sing it.
 Not only was th ,re a great deal
 them  sang  the  Internationale, but
 the favorite  song  was a new one
 called Discipline for Entering Cities
 Song. Another was the Eight Dis-
 ciplines and Four Principles Song.
 The daily newspaper also served
 as a kind of textbook.  Li told me
 that the soldiers would study the
 paper and then   during  a   class
 would ask the instructor to explain
 things they did not understand.  A
 group discussion would result.  "A
 Well-educated  army  is  a  strong
 army," Li explained to me.
 Most of the newspaper was de-
 voted to  local and                                                                                                   national news,
 but foreign news was allocated some
 space.  Thexpulsion of Anna Louise
 Strong from Russia  was  given a
 front-page  box;  Agnes  Smedley's
 reply to, General MacArthur    was
 summarized.  American  policy  to-
 ward China was several                                                                                                        times re=
 viewed, and survey  articles dealt
 with the situations in Indonesia and
 Indo-China.
 A hunger for detailed news about
 the outside world was evident among
 the  local  officials. A half-dozen
 copies of The China Weekly Review
 which we brought with us were read
 avidly, and numerous articles from
 them were translated. A desire for
 scientific information was particular-
 ly apparent.  One official listed for
 us foreign magazines which he would
 like to receive:  New Masses,  Po-
 pular Mechanics .  .                                                                                                  .
 On one wall of our compound was
 a skillfully-executed cartoon showing
 a big-nosed American general hold-
 ing a little bespectacled Japanese as
 if to place him on a saddled  dog
 named Chiang.  The title was- "Ser-
 vant  of                                                                                                 Servants."  The  soldiers
 would laugh merrily, and     with  a
 touch of embarrassment,  whenever
 we went up to eye this more closely.
 The soldiers were    curious about
 our possessions, which  they would
 examine casually and discuss. They
 were  always  friendly,  and some-
 times                                                                                                     with  great hilarity   we
 would chase each other around the
 compound.  The soldiers had a chin-
 ning bar lashed between two trees
 nearby and in the   evenings they
 would take off their  padded coats
 and take turns doing  tricks on it.
 THE area in which we stayed has
 been the scene of intermittent
 fighting since about 10 years ago,
 when the Shantung Column and Lin
 Piao's Eighth Route Army division
 began to resist the Japanese in the
 province.   The  Communists early
 established a guerrilla base in the
 area, from which they harassed the
 Tsingtao-Tsinan railroad, and tales
 of raids, ambushes, heroes, traitors
 and tricks played on the Japanese,
 we discovered, have become part of
 the local folklore.  The last heavy
 fighting took place, in 1947,. when the

 fire then, and were told that the local
 Communist forces had  defended it
 bitterly, wiping out several Kuomin-
 tang regiments.             Now what is left
 of the population is rebuilding slow-
 ly; new straw roofs have risen here
 and there among the smashed walls.
 The harvests of the last two years
 have been small as a result of the
 war and bad weather, we were told.
 This  year  the  -local  authorities,
 directed by the  provincial govern-
 ment, have begun an intense drive
 to increase production.  The  Giao
 Dung Pao every   day  carried long
 articles and editorials about spring
 plowing and sowing, a seed and fer-
 tilizer loan program has been worked
 out, and about March 10th the sol-
 diers went into the fields to help the
 peasants.   Daily   progress   reports
 were sent to Tsinan by radio.
 Land Reforth
 The land reform has been carried
 out in the area, a Communist Party
 member told us.     The richest land-
 lord in the vicinity              owned  about
 1,000 mow .(one-sixth  of  an acre)
 and the second  richest,   365 mow.
 This land has been     distributed to
 the former tenant  families, - which
 now, own three mow, more or less,
 per person.  Land  owned by land-
 lords was confiscated outright, but
 they were allowed to retain enough
 for their own use on the same basis
 as the peasants.  The rich peasants
 were  handled  differently.  Efforts
 were made to persuade them to give
 surplus land to poorer relatives. If
 persuasion   failed,  pressure   was
 brought  to  bear   through  village
 meetings.   Peasants who owned only
 a few more mow than their neigh-
 bors were not asked to give them up.
 In some  counties  in       Shantung
 some ultra-leftist incidents took place
 a- year agog we were told.  A  few
 landlords  and  collaborators   were
 shot by decision of village meetings.
 These killings, however, were termed
 illegal  by  the  higher authorities,
 since the magistrate  is the lowest
 official with the  power  to   order
 execution.
 Another problem      created by the
 redistribution of land, we were in-
 forrned, has been the  tendency of
 poor peasants who have received ad-
 ditional land to celebrate by working
 less hard.  This caused middle pea-
 sants to grumble:  "We worked to
 get our land.  You get some for no-
 thing and now you just loaf."  To
 meet this problem, the Communists
 began production campaigns.
 Poorer villages have  been given
 land by richer villages. To effect such
 redistribution, conferences of several
 villages are called.  If a village re-
 fuses to yield land to a poorer neigh-
 bor, the case may be referred-to the
 commissioner, the immediate super-
 ior of the magistrate,  for  settle-
 ment.
 For tax purposes the land in this
 area has been  classified  into ten
 degrees.  The annual tax is two cat-
 ties of grain per degree times mow,
 regardless of the size of the crop.

 Springtime Notes From Hunan
 --                               Toni Farnham
 THE beauty of th Hunan country-
 side  in                                       sprint                     cannot  be a
 source of joy to it, inhabitants this
 year with troubles even worse than
 economic chaos be: etting the pro-
 vince.  Early in M rrch news of an
 army of rebels in t:he western part
 of . the province  came  first  as a
 rumor. Then, with the        publication
 of newspaper aecour ts, it became the
 subject of discussioi on everybody's
 lips.
 Are they'  Conr;nunists?    They
 deny it. Even -;troi-'er is the denial
 that they are bandi-.s; they are the
 "People's  Liberate g  Army"       and
 they claim a just rievance and  a
 cause for which  ~ey fight.   Tsao
 Chen-ya, the leader of the liberators,
 was the chief of p dice in Hwang-
 hsien, westernmost  city in                                                          Hunan.
 Schoolboys learning the geography
 of their native  province call that
 part "the nose on the old woman's
 face."   From Hwanghsien,    leader
 Tsao took his follow ire to the North
 and East as far a.,. Chenki, wartime
 capital of Hunan.   Chis city is the
 site of the famous ave-arsenal, and
 a desirable plum fi,. anyone seeking
 power.   Here the  'liberators" took
 captive the head o  the arsenal and
 held him prisoner while  removing
 8,000 rifles and a oodly supply of
 ammunition.
 From Chenki the :.rmy, now grow-
 ing to a size report !d as                                                          high  as
 7,000, continued nun th to Yuanling.
 At this point the a ell-planned and
 executed  "revolution "  disintegrated
 into a  campaign   f pillage. The
 citizens" of Yuanling : ound themselves
 the victims, rather than the bene-
 ficiaries, of the                                                           upi ising.      For ten
 days they huddled or, t'error while all
 shops and homes we e systematically
 looted.   An  estima ed  400  shops,
 after being cleared  >f all valuables,
 were burnt on the pretext that illu-
 mination was neede( to prevent the
 Nationalist army,    !cently arrived
 from eastern Hunan, front crossing
 the river.  In any ev ~nt the regulars
 contented themselve:  with sporadic
 rifle fire,   making no attempt to
 cross.    On March 10 the rebels after
 one last wave of loo "ing, turned the
 city back to  its, ofli ials  and with-
 drew in an orderly manner.
 The grievance of t ie revolutionary
 leader and his  folk wets has  been
 directed  against   ti e   Vice  Com-
 mander-in-Chief of t"h , Peace Preser-
 vation Army, Generic Li Mo-an, who
 was sent recently from Changsha by
 Governor Chen Chien to organize and
 prepare that part  o' his    command
 area for the nation i resistance to
 north.  The farmers ,f this area are
 known to posses:; go is for their in-
 dividual protection
 a id it is report-
 the cause of the uprising.  Leader
 Tsao  declares  his loyalty to  the
 Nationalist  Government, and espe-
 cially to Governor Chen, while seek-
 ing the overthrow and  removal  of
 General Li.
 On the eleventh of March a nego-
 tiated  agreement  was    reached  in
 which the  following points were
 made: 1)  All the "rebels" at pre-
 sent under the  leadership of  Tsao
 Chen-ya would be formed into  a
 division of the National Army. 2)
 Commander of this  new division
 would be Wong Yuin-wha. 3) All
 the junior officers under Wong would
 be elected by their own men. 4) All
 pay, subsistence and supplies to this
 division are to be on an equal basis
 with those remitted to the Nation-
 alist Army proper.
 Tsao Chen-ya is to be commander
 of a regiment in this new army.  At
 present, members  of the liberation
 army have returned to  their   home
 villages and Tsao Chen-ya has gone
 back to his job in  Iwanghsien   to
 await the reorganization.  Governor
 Chen is reported to be sending an
 official to Hwanghsien to count, in-
 terview and organize the new army.
 Other parts of Hunan also are re-
 acting to the weakened authority of
 the Central 'Government.  Southwest
 of  Changsha  in  Shaoyang,    from
 where this is being written, life has
 become tense after many rumors of
 bandit attack. The present state of
 mind is best evidenced by a collapse
 of the market for staple commodi-
 ties.  First grade rice plunged from
 7.60 to 4.50  silver dollars,  even
 though transportation costs in this
 rice importing area  have been  in-
 creasing.  All the  police  from the
 Hsien villages have  been   brought
 into the city for fear         they  would
 suffer the  loss of  their arms.  A
 curfew has been ordered, and one
 night recently the lights of the city
 were -kept on all night in anticipa-
 tion of  an                                                                                                   attack. However,  the
 recent arrival of  troops  from  the
 First Army    Regiment has   helped
 ease the tension.
 Wu-kang       Hsien,  south of Shao-
 yang, has not been so fortunate and
 is now experiencing the discomforts
 of its  own   small  revolution. Its
 rebel army, starting with. fifty men,
 has grown, if rumor may be   relied
 upon, to 2,000 men.  A door-to-door
 canvas of the largest village yielded
 the necessary guns, flashlights, and
 tennis shoes to equip an army. Local
 tailors were  set to work    making
 uniforms from confiscated cloth. So
 far the influence of this group has
 not   extended  beyond   the  hsien
 boundaries.
 Although  not  unduly    disturbed,

 CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN CHINA
 A Chinese Christian
 THE  foreign  missions  in  China
 are   facing  a  situation  today
 which they have never faced before.
 China has been going through a re-
 volution ever since 1911, but we are
 witnessing' a stage of that revolu-
 tion now which is unprecedented in
 scope  and  intensity  in the  whole
 history of social change in China.
 My feeling is that while the Chris-
 tian missions were able to make a
 valuable contribution  in  China  in
 the past and could truly be regarded
 as pioneers, prophets, fanatics and
 martyrs, they have become confused
 at the present time and have not
 only lost their grip on things but
 are also uncertain of the direction
 in which they should be going.
 In the past decades the missions
 came.. to China as a leaven in, and
 a crusade against, the then existing
 order of society.  They were fruitful
 not only in the introduction of new
 thoughts, new institutions and new
 ways of life, but also in the de-
 molishing  of                          outmoded  customs,
 practices and ideologies. The Chris-
 tian churches, schools and hospitals
 were effective tools in the achieving
 of these aims.     A Chinese who be-
 came a Christian in those days was
 a hero because in many ways he dis-
 carded the things that were behind
 and placed himself in a conspicuous
 position which was open to ridicule
 and  persecution.  The  missionary,
 too, was a prophet because he was
 able to tell the Chinese what was
 wrong with their past and to point
 to them the way of the future.   To
 put the matter in a nutshell, China
 was then a very backward country
 and the Christian missions from the
 "civilized" west brought with them
 a superior culture which the Chin-
 sse people needed even if many of
 them rebelled against it for a time
 because of social inertia.
 THE author     of  this article,
 who  for  ob ?ious  reasons
 prefers        to rema n anonymous
 at the present ii ne, is a res-
 ponsible                                                                 Chime. !   Christian
 known  personalit  to the edi-
 tors. For sorr,e ti me he has felt
 that the  Christ; n    movement
 in China, partic:rdarly the part
 played by the fo eign mission-
 aries,                                                           was  at  t ariance    with
 fundamental Chri tiara concepts,
 and  was out  c f    step  with
 events in modern China. After
 considerable ?rffor? , he was per-
 suaded to write  rut his views
 for publication in the  Review.
 The  whole quit tior   of   the
 future  place of the Christian
 movement  in 1- nina  is,    we
 feel, of great inr,ortance.  We
 have, therefore,  invited  both

 leaders to preset!, their views

 sions of opinion from readers.

 existing order whole- heartedly,   and
 yet they would be reluctant to give
 it up in favor of something which
 they believe to be contrary to Chis-
 tian principles.
 Why  is  it  that  the  Christian
 missions     and the  Christian  move-
 ment in China as a whole are op-
 posed to the present development in
 China?  It is because they are too
 much one with the existing order.
 Both  capitalism  and protestantism
 grew out of a revolt against the
 feudalistic  society with which the
 Catholic Church was more or less
 identified at that time.  Both stood
 for individualism and laissez faire
 which constituted the core of liber-
 alism in the modern age.                                                                                                  Individ-
 ualism  has  its  values;                                                                                              in many
 ways it contributed to the develop-
 ment of the human personality. But
 in other ways individualism. has been
 the cause of many of the ills of our
 present social  order.  It  elevates
 human personality by one hand and
 immediately destroys it by the other.
 It permits freedom of action for the
 individual and yet it brings social
 chaos to a world which is no longer
 divided by geographical distance.  It
 has. been the _ cause of an economy
 of plenty, of emancipation from the
 world of nature, but at the same
 time  it  has  brought  about social
 inequality, class conflict and inter-
 national antagonism.
 Toward Collectivism

 many people think-which is more         people may not wan, to support the     class and that will mean a certain
 amount of struggle in which violence
 and bloodshed will necessarily be in-
 volved.
 The dilemma which we are facing
 today  is  this:  The present  social
 order simply cannot be maintained,
 even if we want it to be.  A radical
 change is bound to come and it will
 mean more or less negation of thy:
 present individualism and liberalism
 -until the new collectivistic order
 is fully established.  The change is
 forced on us  and we have to pay
 the price for it. If we are not happy
 with the way in which others are
 attempting to bring about the change,
 it  is  up  to  us  not only to  devise
 better methods but also to demon-
 strate that these methods will work.
 But this, it seems, we are unable
 to do,  We are facing a dilemma be-
 cause we are in the situation of a
 person who is sick but refuses to
 recognize his sickness., and is trying
 his utmost to avoid the inconveni-
 ence, pain, and cost of having to
 consult a doctor.
 Unfortunate Incidents
 What is the situation in which the
 missionaries in China find themselves
 today? The Communists are steadily
 gaining ground; in due time, they
 may be  able to bring  the  whole
 country under their control.  In the
 so-called liberated areas the Chris-
 tians,  particularly  the                Catholics,
 seem to be experiencing a good deal
 of difficulty.  Perhaps a good many
 of the reports about Communist at-
 rocities and excesses are exaggerated
 or distorted.   Yet it is beyond doubt
 that a good many of .them are true.
 There  are      various  explanations
 for these occurrences, and we may
 take them for what they are worth.
 In the first, place, in a period of
 turmoil created by the civil war un-
 fortunate incidents would take place
 in spite of the bee  intentions.  This
 would especially le true when the
 fighting force:; ar , newly recruited
 and lack discipline.  In the second
 place, the Communists are carrying
 out a series of very drastic land re-
 forms in the libe ated areas which
 would     naturally come into  conflict
 with people who are big land owners
 or rich farmers of have in one way
 or  another  oppre; sed  the     common
 people.  Christians who suffer in this
 way suffer not as Christians but as
 civilians who come under the opera-
 tion of the new 1 +gislation.  In the
 third place, a large percentage of
 our    missionaries   are   American
 citizens and many of our churches
 get  their  suppor{   from  American
 sources.  The  unf )rtunate     fact  is
 that   the  Commu:ds.ts  regard  the
 United    States .e.  an even   more
 dangerous enemy than the present
 Kuomintang regini ~ in China.   They
 often connect the missionaries and
 the Christian chuff ches with Amer-
 ican                                                          imperiali,;m.    Whether or not
 the  missionaries  ?r the Christians
 are  actually  engt ged in activities
 which the Commun sts consider to be
 subversive, they as   under suspicion.
 Broader I" rspective
 If these explan itions have some
 degree of truth i m them, then the
 whole situation  tikes on  quite  a
 different color.  It would seem then
 that the responsildity for the un-
 fortunate incidents, lies just as much
 with the missionar +.s and the Chris-
 tians as with the 7ommunists.                                                             Our
 failure  to  deal  - rith  the burning
 issues in the prese,it social situation

 &, Watch
 The failure on the part of the
 missionaries and the  Christians to
 look at the whole matter from this
 broader perspective has caused them
 to take a negative attitude toward
 the present development. Instead of
 thinking in constructive terms as to
 how they can contribute to the build-
 ing of a new order and how they
 can lessen the evils which would in-
 evitably  accompany this                                                                                                        period  of
 change, they are thinking in terms
 of evacuation and withdrawal.   Some
 even talk in terms of the "new cat-
 acombs" they may have to go into.
 All this is most unfortunate, con-
 sidering the revolutionary and pro-
 phetic nature of the original Chis-
 tian gospel.
 Whither  Christian   missions  in
 China? It seems no one has even
 attempted  to  answer  the question.
 In fact we cannot answer it until we
 are conscious of our involvement in
 the status quo  which  necessitates
 radical change. But if we are con-
 scious of it, then we shall see com-
 munism not                                                                                                     as   a menace to the
 things we hold dear, but as a chall-
 enge to the task which we should
 have taken up but have failed to.
 We may then see the vision of a new
 world of possibilities, in which we
 shall be able not only to do our part
 in building a new world but may
 also be able to convert many who
 now seem to oppose us in the Chris-
 tian way of life.  The fact that we
 do not see this vision is due to our
 obsession  against communism  and
 the Soviet Union. We have grown
 up with the present social order and
 have found ourselves comfortable in
 it even though it is full of contradic-
 tions.  But the time may come when
 the march of events may open our
 eyes to the true situation and then,
 in repentance, we may be. able to see
 wherein we have gone astray.
 Whither Missions?
 Whither  Christian  missions  in
 China? ,It will  be   difficult for
 missionaries to answer this question
 for themselves.  It will he difficult
 for Chinese Christians to answer it,
 because ideologically  they are so
 much at one with the missionaries.
 The sad thing in our era is the fact
 that the United States as the richest
 and most powerful country in the
 world .is trying to impose its social
 pattern on peoples and nations which
 are  struggling  fbr  a  new  social
 order.  Instead  of   allowing these
 peoples and nations to find their own
 way in the light of the situation
 they are in, the United States seems
 to be dictating to them, in fact if
 not in words, the way which they
 should  go.  This  attitude  of  the
 United States is facing obstacles in
 many parts. of the world and it is
 now  meeting  with  the    most  per-
 sistent                                                                                                      opposition in  China.    Will
 the missionary movement in China
 be able to rise above this situation
 and to proclaim the prophetic word
 or will it seek the easy way and
 identify itself with the forces of re-
 action? The answer to this question

 following have made  a great im-

 Last summer the Reds conducted
 a night raid on Dan Shui How in
 Kaiping hsien. They   kept  their
 hands off the inhabitants' property,
 however, although  they were in a
 position to do as  much looting as
 they  wanted,  since  the  gar4ison
 troops in the suburbs had been sur-
 rounded.                       In a hsiang in Kaiping, a
 band  of   armed  Reds shot several
 bandits who, in the   name of the
 "People's  Liberation Army,"  had
 plundered a passing bus.   They re-
 quested the local inhabitants to re-
 port                  the  execution  to  the hsiang
 chief.
 Awaiting Communists
 The sentiment of the people, in
 fact, is more and more on the side
 of the Reds.  One old man of well
 over 60, a hsien councillor of Kai-
 ping, openly told his friends that he
 was  awaiting the  arrival  of the
 Communists,   saying,  "Since  the
 Communists have been in the North
 for so long, why don'.t they come
 down to the South sooner?" This is
 the boldest remark about communism
 that I have heard made publicly. It
 is to be understood that the old man
 is a local luminary who has been
 in public service for scores of years.
 Hence he is in no fear of being red-
 baited merely for having made an
 "undesirable" remark.

 NEWS OF THE WEEK.
 Peace Talks Commence In Peiping;
 Communists Shift To City Policy
 PEACE  negotiations  between  the
 Government  and  the   Chinese
 Communists are expected to begin in
 Peiping on April 1.  The   Govern-,
 ment's peace delegation,. is headed by
 General Chang  Chih-chung, the
 other members being  Shao  Li-tze,
 Huang  Shao-hsiung,  Chang Shih-
 chao,  and  Li  Cheng.                The   Com-
 munists are represented by Chou En-
 lai, Lin Piao, Yeh Chien-ying, Lin
 Pei-chi and Li Wei-han. The Gov-
 ernment  has    accepted                Communist
 leader Mao Tze-tung's eight terms
 made public on January 14 as the
 basis for discussion.
 According  to the    Chinese-owned
 China Daily Tribune, the maximum
 concessions the Government is  ex-
 pected to make on these eight points
 are as follows:
 1)  In the matter of the punish-
 ment of war criminals, the Govern-
 ment will  request the  Communists
 not to adopt an attitude of "retalia-
 tion", but will agree to the complete
 withdrawal  from  politics        of  such
 leaders as wore ardent advocates of
 the civil war.
 2)  With reference  to the abro-
 gation of the  Constitution'                    agree-
 ment will be given to the convoca-
 tion of a new National                      Assembly
 truly representative of the people in
 the country for a referendum.
 3)  The question of the abolition
 of the legal  status of the  present
 Government is  considered  of     no
 consequence in view of the expect-
 ed formation of                  a  coalition Gov-
 ernment if the peace talks succeed.
 4)  The    reorganization  of    the
 Army should be carried out on the
 principle of the nationalization  of
 the armed forces.
 5)  As  to  the  confiscation     of
 bureaucratic capital, the Government
 will agree to its requisitioning on a
 fair basis.
 6)  The enforcement of land      re-
 form is also the policy of the Gov-
 ernment.
 7)  The abolition of "traitorous"
 treaties can be effected after care-
 ful study of existing agreements.
 8)  Complete  agreement  is  ex-
 pressed with the  convocation of            a
 new Political Consultative Confer-
 ence for  the  establishment  of               a
 coalition government.
 be the first demur d of the Nation-
 alists on the grounds that continua-
 tion of fighting is not conducive to
 peace negotiations.
 Well-informed sources predict that
 the question of reo, gailization of the
 armies is the crux  of  the  peace
 issue, and it is gererally feared that
 the peace talks  n,ny breakdown on
 this point.
 Before the departure of the Gov-
 ernment's peace delegation, a series
 of important confc rences were held
 by responsible generals of the Minis-
 try of National Defense to discuss
 the reorganization +f armies. Acting
 President Li Tsung-jen, Premier Ho
 Ying-chin and all  members of the
 peace delegation also were present
 at these conferences, Results of these
 talks were guarded as top  secrets,
 but it is understood that, after much
 ,..deliberation, the Government adopted
 certain formula wl ich would  "pos-
 sess the dual foatui,~ of being accept-
 able to the Commi nists and at the
 same time be capal le of maintaining
 the entity of the   ationalist Army
 which  Generalissineo   Chiang Kai-
 shek laid down as c tie of his require-
 ments for a peace settlement."
 Peace-A Question Mark
 PUBLIC reaction ?:o the opening of
 peace talks ha.: been a mixture
 of hope and appreii: nsion. A United
 Press story dated  March 27  from.
 Nanking makes in'resting  reading.
 It reads in part   r:s follows: "The
 question on most I ps was:  Can it
 be possible?  To most cautious ob-
 servers peace proslects are a ques-
 tion mark at b be restored with
 Government help if necessary; pro-
 duction power L. to be  increased,
 production costs lowered,  and  pro-
 duction increased both quantitatively
 and qualitatively.
 "The develu?pmc-irt  of industrial
 undertakings is to be accompanied
 by higher profits and higher wages
 so that general income levels  may
 be raised.  Re-pr..'ductior- processes
 are to be promos'd with the build-
 ing of organic sty: ictures for the ac-
 cumulation of industrial capital.  At
 the same time, le >or efficiency is to
 be improved and the living conditions
 of workers improved  through the
 application of the' principle of 'bene-
 fiting both labor and capital.' The
 supply of mai eria'  resources from
 rural areas for cities, and the supply
 of finished produc,s for rural areas
 from cities are bo;h to be increased,
 and the economic  tics between the
 two regions are tc be strengthened.
 "The  basic  ehjective,  therefore,
 consists in the promotion of indus-
 trial  undertakings  and                                                             improving
 conditions of workers."
 Contrary to pr+ railing fear about
 Communist hostility toward capital-
 ists, the Chinese Zeds, the magazine
 discloses, are enli iting the coopera-
 tion of private capital in their efforts
 to restore and expand industrial pro-
 duction.
 "After VJ Day, ' the article says,
 "the liberated areais were expanded
 to include  m:.uiy  middle-sized  and
 small   cities   and   towns,    some
 towns   and cities  'of'  larger size,
 conditions in the liberated areas be-
 came an important field of activity.
 "It was then felt that in order to
 develop various light and heavy, in-
 dustries on a larger  scale, the co-
 operation of the capitalists in the
 liberated areas was necessary.  Ex-
 perience gained                                                                                                        also indicated the
 pgacticability of encouraging private
 industrial undertakings.         Many en-
 terprises formerly operated by the
 state  in  the  Shansi-Chahar-Hopei
 Border   Area,  for  instance,   have
 either been turned over to    private
 ownership or else have   encouragt_ed
 private investments.  The same policy
 is put into practice in other liberated
 areas.
 "Such a tendency, it will be seen,
 serves to promote  the    development
 of industrial capitalism.  This  en-
 couragement of                                                                                                              private  industrial
 capital must, however,             be distin-
 guished from the oppression of na-
 tional industrial                                                                                                      capital  which  is
 practised by the  feudalistic,  coxn-
 pradore, and bureaucratic capitalists
 of Nationalist. China."
 In order to step  up      production,
 the Communists are reported by the
 magazine to have  improved     labor-
 management relations and technique.
 The article notes :
 "One of the first problems receiv-
 ing  attention  from  the                                                                                                      authori-
 ties is the improvement of organiza-
 tion and management as well as the
 improvement of  production. techni-
 ques.  With reference to the latter,
 in addition   to improving   existing
 technical methods, special  attention
 is given to the introduction of new
 and more effective  production    me-
 thods.
 "The acquisition of adequate sup-
 plies of raw materials to insure con-
 tinuous production, the best use of
 production, tools, and economy in the
 consumption of raw  materials  are
 other factors taken into serious con-
 sideration in efforts to increase pro-
 ductive power."
 In conclusion,  the magazine de-
 clares that the industrial policy of
 the Chinese Communists so far has
 been fairly successful, saying:
 "The majority of coal mines have
 been restored and most are operating
 on a normal basis.  Other  mining
 enterprises, including gold, mica and
 iron have also been re-opened in the
 various districts.  Most power sta-
 tions and other utility services have
 been restored.
 "Many enterprises  formerly  oc-
 cupied by the enemy or forced to
 suspend operations have been  res-
 tored to their rightful owners when
 the  democratic  government estab-
 lished its authority.                                                                                                     Mention may
 be made of the Tai Chang Flour Mill
 at Kan Tan; the Tsi Foong Flour
 Mill at Tsining; the Chang Yu Bre-
 wery at Chefoo; and the Sui Feng
 Flour Mill at  Chefoo.  All  these
 plants were restored to their orig?-
 honestly done their best for their    districts.  In these places, there was                           inal owners, and loans were issued

 information about Hunan, and hope you
 Kill send me a free copy of your Review,
 as I no longer see it at the library.
 In the history of China, Hunan people
 have always been the pioneers of every
 revolution for the benefit of all China.
 They  are  considered  ultra-modern  and
 cosmopolitan.
 Since the present civil war has spread
 so extensively, prices have sky-rocketed
 and taxes have grown increasingly heavy.
 Now, to ward against a famine in the
 spring,  more  than  2,000  farmers  have
 organized themselves into an "Army of
 the People" to fight against conscription
 and taxation of foodstuffs.
 First' they    fought  at   Yitngling, and
 later at the three cities of Mu-young,
 Luki, and Sinki.  A weapons factory was
 raided and 8,000 rifles taken at Sinki.
 They have now become so strong that
 the two regiments of Nationalist troops
 are no match for them.   The Kuomin-
 tang should realize now the Bandit Sup-
 pression Campaign is of no use.

 American Aid
 To The Editor:
 The present attempt is inspired by a
 reading of C.Y.W. Meng's  article,  "A
 Chinese View of American Aid," in the
 March  19,  1949,  issue  of the China
 Weekly Review.     The writer in China
 enjoys the distinction of being` at one
 and  the  same  time  a   citizen  of this
 country and of the United States.   He
 has -no political axe to grind....
 From the time of his adolescence he
 has devoted himself to efforts to helping
 China become a free, independent, pro-
 sperous and progressive country ...... If
 China can attain this end by any aid
 from America, he wants to see America
 give this aid unstintedly to the greatest
 possible  extent.    Mr.  Meng  seems to
 think  that  American  aid  should cease
 because,  presumably,  American  aid is
 producing. the opposite effect ...... I must be suffering from what Mr.
 Meng called "Uncle Sam's mental bank-
 ruptcy," because I cannot make sense out
 of his allegations......pr.           M
 When he states that   esent American
 aid prolongs "our civil war" and inter-
 feres with a  "peaceful                 movement      for
 political and social change in China," I
 can't understand it.  I don't understand
 how a civil war, in which unnumbered
 thousands   of  combatants  and    non-
 combatants are killed and maimed, can
 be called a "peaceful movement:'
 Being  "mentally  bankrupt,"  I cannot
 understand how American aid, which is
 designed to lessen human  suffering  in
 China  and  to  promote   economic  and
 educational growth within the country,
 can  be interpreted into  meaning  that
 y'1111lt11111t11111111t111 III11111151111511111it11 I I111111111111111111111i'~

 such  aid has  the  erect  of  operating
 against   "political   f ?eedoin, economic
 equality  and  social security       for  all
 peoples."
 ..Now, it ha:, appeared to me that
 the American aid to     China heretofore
 given was and i;;    gig en to a dynamic
 consciousness of "a  changing     China, a
 progressive China, and a new China"--
 the very kind of  China that America
 and all  men  of   goc.t will  wish  to  see
 China  become.... Mr.  Meng  will  place
 me under a debt of gratitude to him
 if he will be so kind  as  to show me
 how American aid prevents, or tends to
 impede,  efforts  to  nuke    China change
 and become new and -i,rogressive.
 He hits the point,  lowever, when he
 says that America a ms to  counteract
 Communism.        What's wrong with that?
 The  American     nation was  founded on
 the principles that all men are created
 equal, that they are endowed with cer-
 tain inalienable rights, and that among
 these are the rights t, life, liberty and
 the  pursuit  of  happiness:     Does  Com-
 munism stand for then principles?                                                                          Look
 at Soviet Russia today,  Ii; is the classic
 example of what Conv,iunism is.... Dods
 it stand for "political freedom, economic
 equality  and     social  security for  all
 peoples?"   Why, then, do its people try
 so hard to escape from        this  political
 heaven-even at the r sk of their lives?
 . But the conten ;ion seems to be
 that China today is  ",uled by a group
 of        "extreme rightists,"   "reactionary
 ruling classes," and "corrupt regimes."
 Unfortunately,    this   s  all too     true.
 That's why China ha     been brought to
 her present sorry pas     My question to
 Mr Meng is this:  What choice have the
 Chinese  people?  Ir.  there  any       other
 choice than that of acr epting Communist
 dictatorship, or doing everything possible,
 with whatever outside help is available,
 to reform a Government presently domin-
 ated by "extreme                                                                    rightists"  and        "re-
 actionary ruling classes?"
 .Does Mr. Mang wish to imply
 that  the  Communist  regime that         now
 threatens the whole of China is not Com-
 munist in the sense that we understand
 the Moscow model--that, In fact, it is a
 regime truly devoted  Lo "political free-
 dom, economic equality, and social security.
 for all peoples?"   If it `is, I want to
 know  it  quickly,  b-cause  'I've  been
 opposing that regime.... and if the pre-'
 sent overlords of Peiping are for these,
 I'm with them.
 Mr. Meng can prove this promptly, and
 remove all my doubts.  All he has to do
 is to go up to Peiping, and induce The
 China Weekly Review to do the same.
 If he and The China Weekly Review can
 go up there and lambast the Communist
 regime  for  its  wrongs  (as  I  suppose
 there are some), as'both have so success-
 fully been pasting the Kuomintang Gov-
 ernment for its sins (of which there are
 undoubtedly  many)-with  impunity-he
 .can persuade me to believe that we are
 watching a "civil war" that is only a
 "peaceful  movement for  political  and
 social change." And I'll write home to
 my folks and tell them to pester the life
 out of our.  Congressmen and   Senators
 until they stop aid to China.

 Feudal Justice
 To The Editor:
 It was gratifying to read your edi-
 torial "Feudal Justice" in the March 26
 issue of the Review.  You expressed what
 many people want to but dare not say.
 For other measures of General Tang
 En-po, I should like to add the following
 which he effected in Honan:   In order
 to  eliminate armed   resistance,  he  dis-
 banded the Honan Militia by either assas-
 sinating their leaders  (for example, Pi
 Jing Fang) or driving them to the front
 as cannon fodder.     He also used farm-
 ers' wheat fields as drilling grounds and
 farmers were killed by shrapnel when his
 army practiced shooting.
 The   chapter   "Honan   Famine"  in
 Annalee Jacoby's and Theodore White's
 book "Thunder   Out  of  China"   carries.
 more details on General  Tang     En-po's
 activities.

 Disparities
 To The Editor:
 Because of the wide disparity between
 the rich and the poor, it is hard for the
 former to understand how hard things
 are for the latter.
 A French writer speaks of a duchess
 who once visited a convent too poor to
 have  a  fire  to  warm  the  building.
 of living by reducing taxes and exempt-
 ing them from extra taxes.                                                                                                                         On return-
 ing to Peiping., she was asked how thet
 free  tax  was  to  be  decided,  and  she
 replied,  "Oh,  wait!   Peace  has. come
 back to the world and people are going
 to enjoy themselves very well."
 Such      mistakes  come from  ignorance
 and the wide difference of the standard
 of living between the poor and the rich.

 Good Faith
 To The Editor:
 Because  the  civil  war  keeps  inter-
 rupting communications, it takes at least
 16  days  for  the Review to  get  here
 through the mails.      I keep thinking that
 if there were no war I should be able
 to get your magazine more easily.
 Everything here keeps getting worse
 and worse because of the political and
 economic situation.  The only way the
 present crisis can be relieved is through
 peace.   I would advise the Government
 to use good faith with the Communist
 Party, and as a college student I say
 loudly to the Government, "Quickly, give
 us peace."

 Shivering with  cold,                                   the  duchess  felt
 great sympathy for the nuns at the con-
 vent, and ordered firewood to be sent to
 them.  After warming herself at the fire
 in her home, she gradually began to for-
 get the misery at                                                                                                       he convent.  When

 she wished to have sent, she said, "Oh,

 THE CHINA
 WEEKLY
 A Weekly Newspaper Established in 1917
 The editorial pages present each week the opinions
 of the editor. The other pages of The China Weekly Re-
 view are written by the other members of the staff and
 the contributing editors who report and interpret the
 news irrespective of the views expressed in the editorials.
 Abundance For All
 H ENRY WALLACE, former US vice-presi-
 dent and recent unsuccessful candidate for the
 presidency, has suggested that the United States
 and Soviet Russia cooperate in making-China a
 testing ground for a program of "abundance for
 all peoples."  Mr. Wallace then went on to say
 that neither communism nor capitalism can solve
 the problem of want until "both, by agreement,
 get rid of the spirit of intolerance".
 We can imagine the reaction of many people
 to Mr. Wallace's proposal, which was made to a
 meeting of the Cultural and Scientific Conference
 for World Peace in New Yotk.  The Conference,
 even before it began meeting, wasp labeled by the
 American State Department as a vehicle for the
 spread of communist propaganda.  With such a
 prejudiced approach by an important American
 governmental organization, it is likely that the
 suggestions made by Wallace and others will be
 labeled in many quarters as red propaganda,
 impractical,  foolish,  etc.  Many of Wallace's
 earlier proposals have met similar receptions.
 For example, we remember when, as Secretary
 of Commerce in the last Roosevelt administra-
 tion, Wallace said that the American postwar
 economy could be  so geared  as  to provide
 60,000,000 jobs. Newspaper editorialists, column-
 ist,, and various public figures hooted in derision,
 claiming that this was another example of
 "Henry's dreaming."  Since the end of the war,
 American employment figures have frequently
 been well above the 60,000,000 mark.
 Despite the allegations of those who claim
 that there. are so many people in the world today
 that they cannot .be fed adequately, we think that
 Wallace's idea of Russo-American cooperation. in
 China  to  attempt  to  provide  a  program of
 "abundance" for all the Chinese people is no
 more of a "dream" or "vision" than his earlier
 idea that the American economy could provide
 jobs for 60,000,000 workers. '
 The end of the Civil War in this country
 should contribute greatly to China's ability to
 feed and clothe herself.  In years past, the
 country's annual food deficit was not so,great in
 normal seasons.  The cessation of fighting, which  ing.  It should also be remembered that this
 would mean the end of huge  non-productive         fabulous sum represents money which the govern-
 Approved For Release 2006/04/21 : CIA-RDP83-00415R003000060007-4
 armies and a chance for the farmers once again
 to tend their fields in peace, should provide a
 tremendous boost to the local economy.  Added
 to this a program of foreign help, which would
 provide capital and improved techniques, and
 China should soon be on the, road to self-
 sufficiency.  Even if she cannot economically
 raise sufficient food, other industries working for
 the export trade can be developed so that she will
 acquire sufficient foreign exchange to buy her
 additional food requirements from surplus areas
 abroad.
 We grant that the population pressure in
 this country constitutes a major problem which
 will have to be met in the very near future,
 especially if any improvement in living con-
 ditions for the masses results in population in-
 creases of such rapidity as to "eat up" the.sur-
 plus.  However, there is a good chance, we be-
 lieve, that modern production techniques may
 enable the nation to keep ahead of population
 growth for some time.  Daily headlines in the
 local press would indicate that.  A report from
 Manila recently described an experiment With
 enriched rice which may provide the answer to
 beri-beri, an lindiginous disease in Asia's rice
 eating countries.  The added nourishment pro-
 vided by enriched rice might also go a long way
 toward eliminating the many other diet deficiency
 diseases and ailments commonly found in China.
 In the US, where mechanization is almost
 taken for granted, new innovations in agriculture
 are being tried out each year.  Cotton growing,
 which is a big industry in China, too, is being
 mechanized rapidly in the US with machines now
 available for most of the work. While progress
 is slow and the trial and error process is still
 going on, a recent press dispatch from Washing-
 ton reported that "mechanization of the cotton
 crop has now been accomplished experimentally
 at every stage from the seed-bed to the market."
 Think of the labor such a development would
 free for industry in China!
 The world, especially the United States, now
 has for the first time in the history of mankind
 sufficient tools to manufacture from nature enough
 materials to feed, clothe, and house all people.
 It is no longer necessary for a large section-
 perhaps even a majority-of the world's popula-
 tion to live on a subsistence level.  Proof of this
 can be obtained from a glance at the official ex=
 penditure  figures  for  the  last war.  Enough
 money, representing actual industrial and agricul-
 tural production, was spent by the powers for
 military means to have raised the standard of
 living of the respective countries immeasurably.
 According to the "World Almanac," the
 total amount spent by the six principal belliger-
 ents (not including China for which no estimates
 were available) was US$1,116,991,463,084. Added
 to this was an estimate of US$'230,900,000,000
 representing  property  damage.  US$1,347,891,-
 463,084  would,  for  example,                                                                      easily _ provide
 adequate housing and clothing for every man,
 woman, and child in China.. The possibilities of
 what could be done with such a sum are stagger-
 Approved For Release 2006/04/21 : CIA-RDP83-0041 g0R000R0 077view, April 9, 1949
 ments of the principal powers were able to extract
 from the people over and above their, daily re-
 quirements.                        In the case, of the United States,
 the people supplied the surplus wealth without
 much, if any pain, while in other countries, such
 as Germany, Italy and Japan, it was obtained as
 a result of great privation.
 In any event, the mere fact that the countries
 of the world could afford to spend such a stagger-
 ing sum and to. suspend or curtail normal pro-
 ductive activities for up to six years proves con-
 clusively that mankind now is, able to produce
 yearly a considerable surplus of materials above
 the basic rpinimum requirements.  The fact that
 such "surplus" wealth is not used for the benefit
 of mankind in relieving want and in improving
 the machinery of production reflects upon the
 intelligence of the governments of the world.
 The United States is today spending pro-
 digious sums on self defense, unsound foreign
 relief programs, and military aid schemes for
 other countries under the provisions of treaties
 such as the North Atlantic Pact.  This money
 would easily abolish poverty and want in the
 United States if spent properly. What's more -
 as the war years proved-the natural wealth and
 highly-developed  productive  machine  of  the
 United States would. enable it alone to contribute
 greatly toward eliminating want in the rest of
 world.
 The factors hampering Russo-American co-
 operation on a plan to provide an abundance for
 the many people suffering from want are largely
 political, and these political reasons in, turn stem
 largely from the narrow selfish interests of certain
 partisans who actually do not care about the
 welfare of the masses.  This is indeed a sad
 commentary upon our time.
 Another Student Tragedy
 A T LEAST one student has died as a result of
 injuries received during a fight in Nanking
 when a group of soldiers attacked a student
 parade.   It is disheartening to see students
 in Nationalist China once again becoming the
 victims of violence, especially during a time when
 the Nationalist Government has in .a&,tuality sued
 for peace.  If nothing else, it makes one wonder
 about the sincerity of the rulers who day in and
 day out for the past few months have been pub-
 licly stressing their desire for peace.
 While only the naive would believe that the
 Nanking regime would have become so desirous
 of peace if it still had its armies intact, its eco-
 nomy on a sound footing, and its people under
 firm control, one may even become suspicious of
 the Government's intentions if it allows students
 to be beaten and killed for expressing a desire
 for peace.  Since the Government has in fact
 already dispatched a mission to 'Peiping to dis-
 cuss peace terms with the Communists, why
 should the same Government frown upon student
 demonstrations or parades favoring an end to
 hostilities ?
 The Nanking municipal authorities, presum-
 ably controlled by acting-President Li Tsung-jen,
 reasonable view of the situation than elsewhere.
 In Nanking, it is reported, the authorities have
 decreed the death penalty for any soldier caught
 attacking students.  Meanwhile, in Shanghai the
 authorities continue to view the students as
 Communist agents and to warn them against any
 demonstrations or parades.
 About the only conclusion one can draw is
 that the Kuomintang authorities, who are talk-
 ing peace with one hand and beating students
 with the other, either are hypocrites or are ac-
 tually so stupid that they cannot see the ridi-
 culous contradictions with which they are sur-

 Irresponsible Behavior
 A S the tempo of the "cold war" between the
 United  States  and  Russia  mounts,, each
 nation appears more and more to be carrying a
 chip on its shoulder. If this tendency continues,
 there is virtually no chance of averting war.
 Living in this atmosphere, we perhaps become
 accustomed to new "outrages," new political and
 economic maneuvers, threats, reactions, etc.,' but
 the fact remains that relations have been strained
 to a dangerous degree, despite the oft heard re-
 mark that since no one really wants war, there
 will be no war.      '
 It appears to us that there is an excellent
 chance of war, although almost everyone realizes
 full well what a new war would cost in,'terms of
 human suffering and material destruction.  There
 comes a point when one more insult, one more
 threat, one more little incident sets in motion a
 train of events which quickly culminate in war.
 This has been the history of the beginnings of
 many previous conflicts.  World War I, it will be
 recalled, began from one small incident which,
 unfortunately, occurred at a time, when relations
 were strained.  If our memory of history books
 serves us right, the . German Kaiser, although
 long following a certain path toward war, was
 most reluctant to take the final step when Aus-
 trian Emperor Franz Joseph called upon him
 to honor Germany's treaty obligations.  In fact,
 the Kaiser. is supposed to have made a last
 minute attempt to persuade the Emperor  of
 Austria  from  carrying  out  his    plans for
 hostilities.
 World War II began with somewhat more
 deliberate calculation upon the part of the Ger-
 mans, although there is some reason to believe
 'that Hitler, having managed to run through a
 good part of Europe without provoking Britain
 and France, perhaps thought he could get away
 with another conquest without war.
 In the case of Japan's  attack  upon the
 United States, which was perhaps one of the
 greatest open acts of violence in modern times,
 the situation was somewhat different.  How-
 ever, with the benefit of hindsight, it is possible.
 now to go through the back files of newspapers
 covering periods when war has started and to
 see that a conflict was obviously in the offing,
 no matter how much of a surprise it may have
 seemed at the time.  We think that if an ob-
 it must be admitted, have finally taken a more                  server not conditioned to   r  headlines in his

 daily paper, were to pick up, say, a file of any
 metropolitan American newspaper for the past
 three years and skim through it, he would come
 to the conclusion that step by step the world
 was preparing for a new war and that if,
 upon turning to tomorrow's paper, he saw that
 war had broken out, he would not be particularly
 surprised.
 If war comes tomorrow it will not be be-
 cause Russia or America actually wanted to
 begin a conflict that would be sure to cost far
 more than either could gain.  It would be be-
 cause both nations, behaving at times in the
 most childish manner, have insulted each other
 so extensively, laid down so many ultimatums
 and in general progressed so far toward an open
 rupture that they had reached a state where
 neither  behaved ` entirely  rationally.  It  has
 'long been our opinion that if the Americans and
 Russians were able to see themselves in the same
 light as they view each other, the perspectives
 of both might' be improved.
 We were appalled recently by a United Press
 story from Washington which read in part: "It
 was revealed today that the Budget Bureau- was
 considering a Defense Department recommen-
 dation for expansion of an Air Force fleet of
 B-36   `inter-continental'   super-bombers.  The
 proposal was based in part on conclusions 'from
 recent tests, all conducted under combat . con-
 ditions, that the mammoth aircraft is virtually
 immune from interception and has a range to
 attack ~any Russian target from North, American
 bases ....  Military planners have marked off
 some 70 strategic targets in Russia as possible
 objectives in the event of war."
 This story has passed with little if any com-
 ment in the American press, although there was
 some criticism by a few members of Congress.
 However, their objection to it was not what one
 might expect.  Rather, they censured the Defense
 Department because the publication of the news
 "jeopardized" national security in that it gave
 away a military secret !
 It seems almost unbelievable that such a
 statement could be made by a responsible Amer-
 ican Government agency and -perfectly fantastic
 that the only criticism of it from the people's
 elected representatives was that a military secret
 had been let out of the bag.  Just suppose,
 for instance, that the setting had been Russia
 instead of America.` Suppose that in presenting
 its military budget to the Soviet Government, the
 Russian Airforce had said it needed money for
 a very special plane, one that could bomb any
 part of the United States and that, in fact, the
 Russian Army had already marked out 70 cities
 such as New York, Chicago, St. Louis, etc. for
 bombing in event of war.  The American Con-
 gress and press would be howling to high heavens
 and demanding that the State Department dis-
 patch  a  stern  note  to               Moscow  ordering a
 satisfactory  explanation  forthwith.  How  dif-
 ferent it would be if it were the other guy !
 Likewise, how would the Russians react if it
 had been British. sentries in Austria who kkno kk

 down two Russian soldiers for stepping across
 an imaginary line on a sidewalk in Vienna and
 then kicked them into insensibility?  Moscow
 would this minute be denouncing it as another
 calculated plot by the imperialists to disturb the
 peace of the world.  The extent to which we
 have progressed can easily be seen by the almost
 daily blasts of viturperation hurled at one an-
 other by the information media of the East and
 West.  Moscow  denounces  the  "imperialist
 aggressors" for questioning "democratic" Russia's
 peaceful aims.  The most insulting statements
 are made about the United States, and at the
 same time hurt and alarm are expressed over
 the "unjustified" criticism by America of. Russia.
 Exactly the reverse takes place almost every
 morning in the United States.
 A war between the. East and the West is as
 unnecessary today as it ever was.  There are few
 basic differences that could not be solved by men
 of common sense and good will sitting around a
 conference . table.  However, from present, in-
 dication's, it doesn't appear that such a solution
 will be found.  Each accuses. the other of bad
 faith, while proclaiming his  own  spotless  in-
 nocence.  Each proclaims that if he backs down
 now, or even expresses a desire to negotiate, the
 other will interpret it as a sign of weakness and
 attempt to take advantage of it.  With such
 unreasonable attitudes prevailing and with each
 side arming as fast as it can, the future looks very
 gloomy.
 People's Rights Protected
 G ENERAL HO YING-CHIN, China's new pre-
 mier, has issued instructions to the Shanghai
 Police Bureau ordering that henceforth illegal
 arrests shall be prohibited and that the "people's
 freedom" shall be protected.  The order, it is
 reported, has been received by the local author-
 ities . and Police Commissioner Mao Sen has cir-
 culated it to all police departments with the
 notation that they are to abide by it.
 General Ho, it is said, emphasized protection
 3f the physical freedom of the people and pointed
 nut that arrests should only be made by the
 judicial and police authorities in accordance with
 the legal procedure as provided in Article 8 of
 the Chinese Constitution.  He is reported to have
 leplored the fact that the constitutional pro-
 vision was not strictly adhered to by various
 )rganizations during the period of mobilization
 end that illegal arrests were reported.  In order
 :-o respect the constitution and to render protec-
 ion to the 'people, no repetition of the-past un-
 lesirable practices will be tolerated, General Ho
 cdmonished.
 This is indeed welcome news.  Perhaps the
 : nost significant part of the whole order is that
 ,.t instructs the authorities to govern their ar
 ions by the provisions of the constitution. Th-r
 -s one of the few public acknowledgements by a
 s)rominent official in recent months that the
 xovernme}n~t is } bound by the constitution.  In
 C~I7k-RDP&-bb4'1 &k6d6 O    tinned since
 Approved For Release 2006/04/21 : CIA-RDP83-0041    Q  0Qf 97R4ew, April 9, 1949
 it was adopted with great fanfare some two years
 ago.  The last time it figured in the news was
 when some local victims last fall had the courage
 to complain about their treatment at the hands'
 of the authorities, whom, they said, were not
 abiding by the constitution.  The reply, as we
 recall, was that it was nonsense to talk about
 the constitution at such a critical period in the
 bandit suppression campaign because it had long
 since been superceded by the provisions of the
 national emergency.  It was implied that those
 who persisted in harping upon the constitution's
 provisions for personal freedom might be suspect-
 ed as Communist agents trying to disturb the
 public's mind.
 Now,  however, all  seems changed.  The
 second most important Nationalist official has
 issued a stern warning to local officials telling
 them that they must carry out their duties in
 accordance with the provisions of the constitu-
 tion.  This is a great step forward and it is to
 be hoped that General Ho will now turn his at-
 tention to some of the other provisions of the
 constitution.
 For instance, the constitution guarantees
 freedom of the press.  However, according to a
 story in the Shanghai Evening -Post of March
 24, the unbelievable total of 185 magazines have
 been banned by the Nanking-Shanghai-Hangchow
 Garrison Headquarters and the Bureau of Social
 Affairs.  Under General Ho's plan to return to
 constitutional government, it would follow that
 such restrictions upon the press would have to
 be lifted.  It is to be hoped that the new pre-
 mier-will shortly issue further instructions to
 the officials concerned.
 During Sun Fo's tenure of office the com-
 plaint was frequently made that military and
 other local officials refused to carry out the
 orders of the Nanking Government whenever
 such orders conflicted with the views of the
 authorities concerned. Now, with one of China's
 best known generals holding the premiership,
 local officialdom should be more amenable to in-
 structions from above, especially since General
 Ho has at one time or another been the superior
 officer of most of the generals still holding com-
 mands in Kuomintang China.  No longer, pre-
 sumably, can local potentates escape orders from
 above by stating that they do not conform with
 the Government's policy of seeking peace through
 strength or other excuses such as the people in
 Nanking cannot appreciate the problems of the
 local commanders.  Premier Ho is a military
 man with a long record as number- two Kuomin-
 tang general, ranking just behind the General-
 issimo.  In fact the Communist radio has had
 a lot to say about General Ho, having at various
 times referred to him as a bandit, a criminal
 and as a prime instigator of the anti-Communist
 Civil War.  It seems clear now that General Ho
 is the boss.  Whatever happens from now on is
 his 'responsibility. He has seen fit to order Kuo-
 mintang officialdom to- observe the constitution
 insofar as the people's physical freedom is con-
 cerned.  Let us hope that he pursues this policy
 a bit further.

 Chamber Of Commerce Report
 In presenting the annual Report, the Chairman said in
 part:
 "...... During January of this year, the various news-
 papers in China published a letter written by Secretary of
 State  Hughes  to  Mr.  George  Lockwood,  Secretary  of  the
 Republican  National  Committee, which  shows that the    Ad-
 ministration at Washington is aware of the seriousness of
 the Chinese situation...... Secretary Hughes' letter in part
 reads as follows:
 " `The difficulty of the situation in the Far :East, as you
 will perceive, lies in the weakness of the Chinese Government.
 We have done what we could to strengthen it and to give
 it the opportunity for development, but that development must
 of necessity take place within.  It is not possible for the
 powers to create a government for China or to substitute
 with any hope of success a government through their own
 agencies.  The utmost which they may hope to do is to bring
 the Chinese authorities to a realization of their responsibilities
 and give such assistance  (even though it should be against
 the will of certain elements in Chinese politics which hope
 to profit by a continuance of disorder and., corruption)  as
 will tend to stabilize the finances and the transportation ser-
 vices of the Chinese government and thereby bring about con-
 ditions of order and security which may offer a less difficult
 set of conditions in which the Chinese people may develop
 an effective administration of their own.""
 Southern Taxes
 Further tax  assessments  are being  made  on  the Can-

 Canton silk dealers are considering suspending business as a
 protest  against a surtax of  50 percent on  stable and 20
 percent on transit likins for raw silk,   The silk men  are
 now paying eight different taxes or contributions before they
 finally land their goods on the market. These include export
 duty,  Kwangchow  Prefecture  likins, transit  likins, stable
 likins, and four others collected for local charity or protec-

 Wang Ching-wei's Intrigues
 Fresh intrigues of the most sinister character designed
 to bring about the -collapse of China's resistance to force her
 to capitulate to Japan are unfolding themselves in the latest
 activities of Wang Ching-wei, who appears now to be giving
 himself up entirely to the Japanese in order to wreak ven-

 In  addition  to  his latest  lengthy  outburst  which  was
 evidently inspired by the assassination of his henchman, Tseng
 Chung-min, Wang is said to be working intimately with the
 Japanese to hasten the downfall of the National Government.
 An understanding is reported to have been reached between
 Wang and the Japanese Premier Baron Hiranuma, whereby
 Japan had furnished Wang with the sum of $4,000,000 to
 finance his intrigues.
 Flood Plus War
 With the public eye focused on the Sino-Japanese hostili-

 bombing campaign, little attention has been given to the fact
 that a natural calamity in the shape of the rampaging, un-
 controlled Yellow River, aided in its depradations by conditions
 of war, is destroying the homes and livelihood of numberless
 people in the Hwai River valley region of Anhwei province,
 and has already created real conditions of famine.

 WILL CHINA BECOME A RUSSIAN SATELLITE?
 Edgar snow
 COMMUNIST victory in China has
 raised some of the most per-
 plexing questions since the Marshall
 Plan. and the Truman  doctrine be-
 came the foundations  of our post-
 war foreign policy. The   questions
 themselves are not entirely new. As
 matters of  speculation they have
 engaged the interest of men in our
 foreign service for years, as well as
 that of other observers who foresaw
 current developments.  But the re-
 volutionary change                        of power has
 now transformed mere  possibilities
 of the past into these living enigmas
 of the present:
 Will a communist-led government
 inevitably mean that China must fall
 under the absolute domination of the
 Kremlin?  Will Moscow plant "spe-
 cialists" in the Chinese police force,
 the army, the party Politburo, the
 state   apparatus,   to   constitute  a
 government above government, as in
 Eastern Europe?      Will  China  fall.
 into the orbit of    Soviet    economic
 planning, with powers held by Rus-
 sian commissars to                 operate      mines
 and  industries . to meet      Russia's
 strategic demands?   Will the Krem-
 lin be able to dictate internal policy
 to Chinese communists,  as well as
 control China's vote in the United
 Nations?
 Unique History
 For some parts of the world the
 mere asking of such questions might
 be synonymous with answering them
 in the   affirmative.    But   experts
 share many     doubts in  the case of
 China.  'Among them there is wide-
 spread                    recognition  that  the   de-
 velopment of communist  power                          in
 China has established a unique his-
 tory, with special variations in the
 past foreshadowing deviations in the
 future.
 I myself have for  years         taken
 some part in written and oral dis-
 cussions  revolving  around  all                     the
 points examined in this article. In
 some quarters I have.been derided as
 the creator of  "the exceptionalist
 theory" for China. It  has       never
 been my contention that the Chinese
 communists are "not real Marxists."
 But internal evidence did convince
 me that they will not give "absolute
 obedience" to the Kremlin-the basic
 test of anyone accepted as satisfac-
 tory  by  Moscow.  After  a  dozen
 years of firsthand study of China I
 concluded that Soviet Russia would
 not hold effective domination over the
 extremely nation-conscious  Chinese
 communists.
 Some officers in our Foreign Ser-
 vice took a similar view.                Because. of
 that,  the State  Department    was
 less   worried about  communists in
 China than in other , places.  That
 was one reason  why  Mr.     Truman
 officially encouraged the formation
 of  a constitutional Chinese   gov-
 ernment   representing                    communists
 as  well  as  nationalists.   Our  ex-
 perts realized that the communists

 the Chinese Com,n.unists. Sev-

 the alternative would be civil war in
 which   the  old  re=gime  would  be
 smashed entirely, and during which
 the communists would be forced to
 draw closer to Russia.
 The attempt at a , ompromise solu-
 tion failed, and milii ary events have
 now borne out the lai;ter forebodings.
 Yet there are  powerful people in
 Congress, and around it,  who still
 argue that salvation in Asia lies in
 heavier and more di.-ect intervention
 against  the   Chine.;e  communists,
 rather than an  acknowledgment of
 failure in that policy. The Adminis-
 tration is now inclined  to  absorb
 the lessons of event., in China, and.
 to adopt   a wait-and-see attitude.
 But   interventionist;   insist   that,
 normal or friendly    relations with
 Chinese communists ire just as im-
 possible as with the Russians.                                                               It is
 necessary to fight them by all, means
 available, short of scar.  They con-
 tend that it is. inconsistent to spend
 millions opposing; guerrillas in tiny
 Greece, while retreat ng before com-
 munists in China, which holds nearly
 a quarter of  manki id.    And.  they
 see no  difference   ',etween   Greek
 Reds, dependent on  invasion bases

 formidable internal reserves at its
 command.
 The Chinese party -say  interven-
 tionists  who fear   ttalin                                                        will boss
 China-is an  orthodox party thor-
 Moscow unilaterally dissolved it.  It
 has supported the  Cominform's re-
 solutions.  The party has even up-
 held-though belatedly  and           some-
 what "lukewarmly," our official polit-
 ical observers have noted-Moscow's
 denunciation of Tito, whom Chinese
 communists admired in the past.
 Like the Russians,  too, Chinese,
 communists believe in the "historical
 necessity"  to  liquidate   capitalism.
 They intend to help install universal
 socialism  and-ultimately-commun,-4
 ism.    At present they are not en-
 forcing communist or even socialist
 measures.   But they have made it
 clear that they will, as soon as pos-
 sible, establish state ownership over
 all the principal means of Chinese
 production, and collectivize the land.
 The Chinese Reds    have   frankly
 proclaimed themselves loyal allies of
 the Soviet Union.   Although   the
 Kremlin furnished very  little ma-
 terial help to justfy such claims, it
 did  give  important political  or
 moral   support.    Chinese   Reds
 also sympathized openly with Rus-
 sian                                                                                                 aims  to  eliminate   the in-
 fluence of American power in Asia.
 It is flue that the United  States
 furnished Chiang Kai-shek the prin-
 cipal military and economic support
 for his campaigns against the com-
 munists.  But even if we had re-
 mained neutral, interventionists say,
 it would have influenced communist
 policies  and  attitudes   very   little.
 Communists would  still  have de-
 manded withdrawal of our                                                                                                            armed
 forces and cancellation of the com-
 mercial treaty which gave the 'Unit-
 ed States prior claims                                                                                                   on     China's
 strategic raw materials.
 Interventionists Logic
 All that-which is more or less
 true-offers little hope for any re-
 turn to the "good old (lays" in China.
 The interventionists also think that
 such facts are enough to condemn
 the communists as  enemies of the
 Chinese people, enemies of China's
 freedom.   They  argue that a aov-
 ernment  led  by                                                                                                      such  a  party
 inevitably means a nation ruled in
 the interests of Russia, hostile to
 the United States and committed to
 eventual war against us.  Therefore,
 we should promptly extend the anti-
 Cominform front to South China and
 to the European colonies in South-
 eastern Asia.  We should  arm all
 those who would fight the commun-
 ists,'"wherever they lift their heads."
 But does adherence to an ideology
 or a body of dogma by a ruling polit-
 ical party alone determine the rela-
 tions of a nation, with its neighbors?
 Is the party ideology of the moment
 of greater permanent importance than
 the nation's whole past and the legacy
 of  the  past living  in  its people?
 Or greater than its vital  economic
 requirements and exchanges with the
 rest of the world?    Interventionist.

 There is, in fact, no evidence to

 otherwise or was interested in more
 than Russian nationalist      aims  in
 Manchuria.  It offered no other ad-

 Yenan's political line had clearly
 reflected  quite  other  expectations.
 .Several days after the treaty was
 signed but before it was published
 -Japan had already surrendered-
 the  Chinese  communists  issued  a
 proclamation to their forces which
 -demanded: (1) immediate seizure of
 Nanking,   and   establishment of
 a "people's government" there; and
 (2) seizure of the cities of North
 China  and Manchuria, and disarm-
 ing of Kuomintang  troops  in re-
 pudiation of the Generalissimo's au-
 thority.   Yenan heaped scorn upon
 Chiang Kai-shek as a "fascist," a
 "traitor," and an enemy of the peo-
 ple no better than Japan's puppets
 at Nanking.
 This, about the man with whom
 Moscow had just concluded a treaty
 recognizing   Chiang   as   China's
 supreme  commander     and  Russia's
 loyal anti-fascist ally!
 It was nearly a week after V-J
 Day before the  treaty  was made
 public.  It placed the Chinese com-
 munists                   under even    heavier pres-
 sure than Marshal Tito had resisted
 when, not long before, Moscow had
 demanded that he accept Mikhailo-
 vitch as a valid "nationalist" leader
 of Yugoslavia.   Finally  convinced
 that  the  text  was  authentic, the
 Yenanites realized that both Stalin
 and the United States were com-
 mitted to support the Kuomintang
 regime.   'T'hey had no alternative
 but to compromise, in the first round
 of the postwar struggle.
 Within a  month Mao       Tse-tung
 was in Chungking, negotiating-at
 the  instigation  of American  Am-
 bassador                       Patrick  Hurley - with
 Chiang Kai-shek.
 Meanwhile,    the  American Air
 Force flew Chiang's troops into the
 key cities of the north to take over
 from  the  defeated  Japanese.  In
 accordance with the treaty, our Air
 Force and  our Navy  also ferried

 While  the   Generalissimo took

 local guerrillas. All this competition

 Gave LittlAe Help
 From the best information I could
 get, when I was in Korea in 1946,
 the Russians had given little help
 to the Chinese  Ro(:s.    The ' latter
 were rather inclined to look upon
 their "loyal allies" as an obstacle,
 in fact.  The Russians did nothing
 to halt their rural activities, when
 partisans had a ch.ince to disarm
 hinterland  Japanese  garrisons,  or
 secure caches of awns.   But they
 enforced the  treaty in the  cities.
 where  they  turned  over  power  to
 Kuomintang    author ties.   Russian
 policy played no decisive role in the
 ultimate defeat of (,hiang's armies
 in Manchuria and it had no influence
 on the fate of the Kuomintang south
 of the Great Wall.
 As a result, theref )re, of the com-
 munists' sovereign victory in China,
 there now exists in East Asia a. new
 set of circumstances with significant
 implications both iieide and beyond
 the Marxist world.   Moscow must
 deal with. a major, fo-eign power run
 by communists  pos +essing   all the:
 means of maintaining real equality
 and  independence.   This    beconnes
 important when it  is realized that
 potential sources of rriction between
 Soviet  and Chine: e ' nationalisms
 already exist in Manchuria, Mon-
 golia and Chinese Turkestan, where
 Russian attrition ha: been going on
 for generations.   The question is:
 Will the legacy of  ast differences,
 and their influence of the psychology
 of the two regimes which now face
 each other along    any  thousands
 of miles of frontier, be overcome by
 their adherence to a  common ideo-
 logy?
 Complete  control of  Manchuria,
 especially,  seems  i:idispensable to
 state.  Despite lts 40,000,000 popula-
 tion, Manchuria. i5, still the" greatest
 area left open,for settlement by im-
 migration from densely crowded re-
 gions.   It -contains more than 80
 per cent of all China's iron deposits,
 37 per cent of her forest lands, a
 large part of her coal, and great
 water-power resources.   Before the
 war it held about 40 per cent of
 China's railway mileage, 70 per cent
 of her total  smelting and  mining
 enterprises, and over half the textile
 industry.   It accounted for 40 per
 cent of China's entire export trade.
 Under Japan, Manchuria's industrial
 facilities and communications great-
 ly expanded.
 Certain temptations are inherent
 in  Russia's  special  position   in
 Manchuria,  cbup?ed  with -the au-
 thority of the Kremlin hierarchy in
 the world communist    organization.
 By the Treaty of 1.945, Russia be-
 came half owner of the trans-Man-
 churian railway system, which has
 its terminus at Dairen.  Russia also
 acquired equal ownership and man-
 agement rights in valuable auxiliary
 mines, industries, hotels and other
 enterprises.   Moscow obtained joint
 control of the naval and air base
 at Port Arthur, the right to move
 troops in thz railway zone, co-ad-
 ministrative authority in the city of
 Dairen, and duty-free trans-shipment
 rights.
 At last there is in Manchuria a
 government which would appear to
 fit Moscow's description of "friend-
 ly."  Indeed it is pledged, by past
 vows made  before  Chinese  com-
 munists  came  to  power,  loyally                                                                                               to
 obey Kremlin-that its, Comintern-
 directives.       And yet-they are still
 Chinese there.   They can no more
 wish to see Manchuria or any part
 of China absorbed, annexed, bossed
 or pushed around by Russia than
 the  Russians    would  like  to  see
 Siberia annexed,-as an "autonomous
 state," by China.
 Head-on Collision
 If Russia were now to seek to
 deprive the Peiping government of
 control over the economic, political
 and military life of Manchuria or
 to detach it from China after the
 pattern of Outer Mongolian "inde-
 pendence," there would be a head-
 on collision of nationalisms within
 the communist-run world.   Chinese
 communists could no more survive
 the loss of  Manchuria to  Russia
 than the  latter could  permit the
 annexation of the Ukraine by com-
 munist Poland or its absorption into
 a Polish-German communist federa-
 tion.
 What meager  reports  one  gets
 about  current Soviet-Chinese                  rela-
 tions in Manchuria indicate that old
 suspicions  persist,  abetted               by   the

 almost ascetic equality in living con-
 ditions, sharing everything alike be-
 tween officers and men.  They were
 rudely shocked to discover the wide
 differences in food, clothing, quart-
 ers,  pay  and  privileges                     between
 various grades of  Russian soldiers
 and civilians.  There have also been
 incidents of    arrogance  and  cone
 descension.
 A more serious source of friction
 is likely to develop out of the prac-
 tice  of  importing  Russian-trained,
 Russian-speaking  Chinese   to  take
 over responsible  authority in   the
 Soviet-Chinese joint enterprises and
 in zones of co-occupation.  An out-
 standing- case of the kind was the
 return of Li Li-san, who was brought
 to Harbin, and is now a figure of
 power, owing to his close connection
 with the Russian secret police.
 As former head of    the     Chinese
 Communist Party, Li Li-san bitterly
 fought Mao Tse-tung and had him
 expelled from the  Politburo.    Mao
 won  out  in  the  field,  where  he
 organized the  Chinese Red     Army,
 and Li Li-sari fled to Moscow fifteen
 years ago.  For a time Li had Corn-
 intern support,                    but   Mao's   success
 with the peasant movement earned
 reluctant  sanction for his  "line."
 Now, in returning Li Li-san to Har-
 bin in 1945, the Russians reopened
 an old chapter of rivalry.
 On his own, Li could no longer
 seriously challenge  Mao's  internal
 prestige and popularity.   But some
 Chinese communists think that his
 restoration to  regional power   was
 symptomatic   of  a  Kremlin  policy
 aimed eventually to establish an au-
 tonomous Manchurian party dominat-
 ed  by                   Chinese  loyal  to   Moscow
 rather than  the Chinese  Politburo.
 Although  Mao     Tse-tung issued  a
 belated  welcome to  Li   Li-san, he
 must have resented this development
 much  as  Tito    resented. the  MVD
 specialists sent  in by   Russia  to
 "supervise" in Yugoslavia.
 But 1945 was no time .to rebuke
 Moscow.   Until' China    was firmly
 unified under communist power there
 would be no open schism between
 the Russian and Chinese parties.
 New Federation
 And today?   Much depends upon
 how far .the Russians push for the
 separation of Manchuria from China.
 Far from accepting the role of satel-
 lites, either for Manchuria or China
 as a whole, the Chinese communists
 look upon their country as the poten-
 tial focus of a new federation of
 Eastern socialist states, which can
 exist independently,  on a  plane of
 complete equality with the U.S.S.R.
 While the Kremlin cannot be much
 happier over such a prospect than
 it was about Tito's Balkan federation
 scheme, it would be highly illusory
 to imagine that the Russains will
 promptly repeat, in China, the mis-
 takes which lost them effective con-
 trol of Yugoslavia.  They will pro-

 that the United States is the main

 and  of any of    all anti-communist

 it is reasonable to suppose that by

 gime has been etablished by a re-
 volution which satisfied some urgent
 needs. of  the    ieasantrv-combined
 with the   eiiergg,' aroused  by anti-
 foreign  slogans                                                                of  a  nationalist
 movement. It      can    succeed and
 endure only by c)ntinuing that same
 pattern---by redsrming the most im-
 portant promise:; of internal progress,
 popular reform arid true national in-
 dependence.       It                                                                cannot succeed by
 betraying those promises.  It would
 be destroyed if it surrendered the
 interests of the  Chinese  people  to
 Russian demands which might make
 of China a coil nial ;instrument or
 base for aggress ve war against the
 United States.
 Ambitious Program
 The new  gov: snment's  program
 envisages rapid ,ndustrialization, ex-
 panded public wo-ks and communica-
 tions of all kinds, greatly increased
 and modernized agricultural output,
 enlarged facilitie  for mass educa-
 tion and public-hoalth work, and the
 training of thousands of new techni-
 cians capable of directing an econo-
 my  co-ordinated  by  state  planning.
 Yet it starts off with a nation that
 is bankrupt--it: cities  ruined, its
 railways  wvech(d, its machinery
 antiquated or useless, its river and
 canal systems broken down, its peo-
 ple   hungry,   wr ary and      ragged,
 eager to work bit lacking the tools
 and other   means.   Chinese com-
 munists   are       not  so                                                        stupid as to
 think, once they 'begin to carry the
 full responsibility of national power,
 that they can solve all those internal
 problems and sie iultaneously 'launch
 a war, or help  lussia to launch a
 war, against the United States.
 All Chinese a- e deeply conscious
 of the desperate need for an extend-
 ed period of pence.   Mao Tse-tung
 knows that his ambitious state pro-
 gram will require capital and credits
 on a huge  scald, heavy  industrial
 machinery and   ools of all  kinds,
 and hence a large volume of foreign
 imports.  He and other communists
 realize that Russia cannot  satisfy
 demands for capital goods even in
 Eastern Europe and Siberia.   Still
 less can Russia right now become
 the  industrial  arsenal         of  a  new
 China. If the noN- regime is to make
 a speedier  Success of  modernizing
 China than its predecessors, it will
 credit arrangements.  America is un-
 likely to recognize the new regime
 until it has unified control over all
 China.   Even after that, relations
 may be distant and cool compared
 to the past.  But the roots of anti
 Americanism are not deep in China.
 They will diminish in proportion as
 the need of American help becomes
 more urgent.
 No Menace To US
 China as it stands presents no war
 menace to the United States in the
 visible future.   General MacArthur
 was quite right when he said recent-
 ly that Chinese Red successes did
 not endanger our security.    As a
 market, China need not he missed in
 the American economy; the balance
 of our trade there has been heavily
 unfavorable for many years.   This
 is an excellent time for Uncle Sam
 to leave the initiative in our future
 relations entirely up to the Chinese,
 and give them plenty of time, years
 if necessary, to  realize the main
 fact.   That is, that Sino-American
 trade  is at  least as  important to
 China as it is to the U.S.A.
 I have  suggested that  there are
 serious contraditions between the na-
 tional                                                                                                        aspirations  of the  Chinese
 communists and Russian nationalist
 expansion under the guise of "inter-
 nationalism."   But such differences
 are a very minor matter compared
 to the "contradictions" between the
 "national aspirations of the . Chinese
 communists" and the aims of con-
 tinued American intervention against
 them!  If the purpose of American
 policy is to strengthen China's inde-
 pendence from Russia, then it is not
 likely to be achieved by forcing the
 communists-who already rule about
 half the population-to resign them-
 selves to the terms of Russian al-
 liance, in self-defense.   If it were
 demonstrated,  however,  that  the
 United States  does  not intend to
 hold onto any part of China, nor to
 try to impose its will there in al-
 liance with anti-communists of all
 varieties, the factors I have discuss-
 ed would then come into operation
 in  establishing  the  character  of
 Sino-Russian communist relations.
 In any event, in the long run the
 Chinese Communist Party probably
 cannot and will not subordinate the
 national interests of Cliina to the
 interests of the Kremlin..   If our
 policy is washed clean of interven-
 tionism, history may evolve  along
 lines for which  all the  necessary
 preconditions now exist.  China will
 become   the   first communist-run
 major power- independent of Mos-
 cow's dictation.                                                                                                      And that in itself
 would project entirely new perspec-
 tives within the socialist camp as
 well as elsewhere.
 Peiping might eventually become a
 kind of Asiatic Moscow, an Eastern
 Rome  preaching  Asiatic  Marxism
 out of Moscow's control.  As such,
 it would come to constitute the sym-
 bol of the overthrow of the Euro-
 pean colonial  system in                                                                                                      Asia, as
 China now represents a long-range    preferences.   China  will  need  at       private-property rights   in   the

 also set up a frontier against the
 expansion of communism as an ex-
 tension of Russian nationalism in
 the East-a barrier as effective as
 that now erected at Belgrade in the
 West.
 It is just possible that an inde-
 pendent  China  under  communist
 leadership, at the center of a new
 system of independent Asiatic states,
 might eventually prove to be a prin-
 cipal factor in the stabilization of
 world peace.  Given the opportunity
 to  develop  its  own  resources  in
 arm's-length co-operation with other
 nations, such a new Asia might form
 a bloc of powers important enough
 to maintain a stable balance between
 the Russian and American spheres
 of influence.
 People accustomed to thinking in
 terms of ideological absolutes may
 find it hard to understand how "com-
 munism" can be contained by com-
 munism or how it could be checked
 by anything but its exact opposite,
 which they tend to see as "capita-
 lism."  But there are many shades
 and variations in meaning and growth
 in words of that type, and there will
 he more. Dialectically, it is likely
 that the  threat of Russian  world
 dictatorship will be checked by rival
 developments  of  communist  power
 as well as by social democracy and
 modified capitalism.
 New Polarizations.
 History shows us that aggressive
 universal faiths  and organizations
 have been halted beford  they con-
 quered the world-or burned it up-
 by internal rivalries or disintegra-
 tion more often than by attacks from
 without.   Until a few months ago,
 many people  considered it an im-
 mutable law that communist states
 everywhere, at all times, would al-
 ways   submit                unconditionally   to
 Kremlin dictation.  But even people
 who do not understand anything else
 about the Yugoslavia schism realize
 that something new has been added
 to the word "communism"-because
 the above statement is obviously un-
 true. Now at least it must be amend-
 ed  to  read:  "Every   communist
 state. at all times, will submit un-
 conditionally to the Kremlin-unless
 it has an army and a police force
 loyal to its own  national leaders
 first, and to  the Russian national
 leaders second."
 Anyone may speculate about what
 comes next in China, but no one
 can now predict all the results of
 the new polarizations of power in
 Asia.  There are grave risks involv-
 ed in a policy of nonintervention in
 the internal  affairs of  China and
 other Asian states.  There are per-
 haps even greater risks entailed by
 unqualified   support of  the  status
 quo.  For even the most myopic ob-
 server must realize that a now era
 of  nationalism-independence     com-
 bined with various forms of social
 revolution-is now a reality for most
 Asiatic nations.   Events in China
 are merely the most dramatic cur-
 rent expression of an upheaval that
 is shaking nations from  Korea to
 Arabia.   And Japan. had the right

 Educational Changes In Peiping
 Yu Wah
 Peiping (by Mail).
 THE  liberation of    Peiping came
 sooner than was  expected  and
 education was caught    unprepared.
 Moreover,  education  constituted. a
 different problem from the political
 takeover, and the Communists felt it
 should   be dealt  with slowly. The
 frequently in the last two months to
 discuss what can be done to gear the
 university system to the New Demo-
 cracy.  However, all feel  that  the
 changes must be so basic that it will
 take time to effect them. Further-
 more,  although in such   fields as
 science, engineering agriculture and
 medicine students have been trained
 along western lines and the labora-
 tories and textbooks have been im-
 ported from the United States and
 the United Kingdom, there is such
 need for trained personnel that the
 status quo must be maintained until
 a smooth changeover can be effected.
 Likewise, the law schools have been
 left alone  because there is  nothing
 to replace them at the moment.
 In the arts college, however, some
 minor changes have been made. Com-
 munist literature has been introduc-
 ed into the freshman Chinese classes,
 and in freshmen  English the  old
 textbooks  have been discarded and
 English-language material on Russia
 substituted wherever possible. Some
 students even requested exemption
 from freshman  English.         A special
 examination was given at Tsinghua
 University in March which released
 a small percentage of students from
 the course, but the majority will con-
 tinue the study of English.
 Since the Government has not de-
 manded  any  immediate reforms                                                                                                      in

 Wages are paid both in cash and in
 kind.  Basic pay is calculated  ac-
 cording to two sets of formula, one
 for pay  under 300  CNC and     the
 other for pay above 300 CNC.
 Briefly, it works out as follows: If
 a worker's basic pay is 160 CNC, he
 receives nearly 600 catties of millet,
 90 of which he receives in kind. If
 his basic pay is 400 CNC, he receives
 nearly  800 catties,  90 of which is
 paid in kind.  An unskilled laborer
 at the. university receives 150 catties
 and a skilled laborer 300 catties. The
 price of millet was quoted at eight
 Jen Min Piao a catty in January and
 11 Jen Min Piao in February.  Up
 to March 17, when the government
 opened  remittances and  trade with
 the Nationalist areas, the conversion
 rate between the Jen Min Piao and
 the Gold Yuan was one to 10. (The
 blackmarket exchange rate between
 the US dollar and the Jen Min Piao
 is one to 600.)
 Administrative Changes
 Several changes have been made
 in university  administration.  For-
 merly, only professors and                   persons
 on the highest levels of administra-
 tion attended faculty meetings.. Now
 they are open to persons of lower
 rank as well.  All decisions must be
 discussed and approved by the par-
 ties concerned before they go into
 effect.  While under this system the
 president of the university may ap-
 pear to be only a nominal head, the
 feeling is that he  should   execute
 the decisions, not make them.    The
 practicability of this has been illus-
 trated by the fact that Peita, Tsing-
 hua and Yenching universities have
 been virtually  without a  president
 since the liberation of Peiping and
 this has not  interfered with  their
 normal  functions.  Another  notable
 change is that school finances, which
 formerly were a closed-door business,
 have now been exposed    to   public
 scrutiny.  Also, the posts of dean of
 discipline have been abolished.
 Next in importance to educational
 reform is the  task of setting up  a
 research institute to make a thorough
 study of Peiping's population problem.
 The city has an estimated 1,300,000
 non-productive consumers out of a
 population of 2,500,000.   The pro-
 blem is how to encourage these con-
 sumers to  migrate  to                   productive
 areas and reduce the city's popula-
 tion to around 1,000,000.                 Results of
 the research institute's study  and
 whatever recommendations    it  may
 make should,play an important part
 in the government's production  in-
 crease program.  The government is
 also employing scholars to translate
 books on law and  government    ad-
 ministration  patterned   after                       the
 USSR and the Eastern       European
 countries.
 These   reforms,  and      whatever
 others may be made here during the-
 next   few months,               it          must  be
 emphasized, are not final, and will
 not be until the entire educational
 system of the country can be unifi-

 The Week's Business
 DESPITE the issu ,.nce of big deno-
 mination notes of  GY5,000  and
 GY10,000, the shortage of cash notes
 in the Shanghai market continued and
 more bank orders  had to be  used,
 many of which  wt re found   to be
 counterfeit.
 Prices in general continued to rise
 and the peak was reached on Mon-
 day (April 4) when gold was quoted
 at GY1,250,00b per ounce and green-
 backs at  GY28,000.  The  price of
 rice reached GY160.000 per picuL
 This bullish trend was checked in
 the afternoon when the Central Bank
 of China dumped ?,0,000 ounces of
 gold in the ' market at  GY1,250,000
 per ounce and it w as reported that
 over GY70,000,000,0tr0  was recalled
 by the Bank durin';, the . day.
 A tight     money  situation  was
 created and the interest rate went
 as high as GY300 per mule per day
 by evening.   Many  banks  found it
 impossible to balance their accounts
 in the Shanghai  Clearance   House
 and sold gold  bars  to the Central
 Bank late at night at prices as low
 as  GY900,000  per  ounce.  It was
 estimated that as  much as   10,000
 ounces of gold was sold during the
 night to the Central Bank, which
 made a profit of i;Y3,500,000,000.
 In this  connectic n, it    worthy of
 note  that  the  Central        Bank  has
 brought large quantities of gold from
 South China in     rtcent       weeks and
 more is  expected  o  arrive in the
 near future.  Furthermore,  gold       is
 -being  purchased    iy   the  Central
 Bank in America ai the official price
 of GY35 per ounce. All these con-
 signments of gold are expected to be
 dumped in the local market to recall
 Gold Yuan notes.
 In his report       to the  Legislative
 Yuan, Dr.  S. Y.     Liu,      Minister of
 Finance and Governor of the Central
 Bank, declared th:ai. China now has
 gold, silver, foreign.   exchange  and
 commodities valued at        US$200,000,-
 000.                                                     These assets, he             said, will be
 dumped on the  na rket and       should
 last at least for one year.   Accord-
 ing                                                      to Dr. Liu, C iina's total     note
 issue at the end of March was only
 GY200,000,000,000.  At the exchange
 rate then the Government could have
 redeemed .all the      (old  Yuan notes
 with US$10,000,000.
 Dr. Liu  revealed    further  that
 three-fourths of the National Budget
 is being used for  military purposes
 and that the Government  will be
 able to meet its obligations by the
 sale of US$15,000.{100 worth of as-
 sets every month.                                                           The monthly bud-
 get for the  entire                                                        Government  is
 120,000,000 silver collars, of which
 90,000,000 silver dollars is alloted to
 the National   Defense Ministry for
 military expenditur ~.s. '
 '             Approved For Relea
 In addition to gold dumping, which
 constituted the  most important  de-
 velopment during the past week, an-
 other note worthy step was the deci-
 sion of commercial banks not to cash
 checks until after  they have   gone
 through   the    Shanghai  Clearance
 House.  This means a 24-hour time
 lag after a  check is deposited, and
 brought local markets to a. standstill
 on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 This decision on the part of the
 banks was reached because of the
 increase in the number of dishonor-
 ed checks during the past months due
 to the practice of businessmen issuing
 checks without depositing the neces-
 sary amounts first.  The banks had
 found it  necessary to  advance the
 money and often when it was learned
 late at night  that the  dishonored
 checks amounted  to    hundreds  of
 millions of dollars, they were forced
 to sell gold at cheap rates to the
 Central Bank.
 The  decision was adopted, there-
 fore, as a measure of protection for
 banks.
 New  regulations issued  by  the
 Finance Control Bureau to stop the
 banks from the  reckless  issue of
 bank orders also checked the smooth
 flow of credits and, as a result, busi-
 picul, dropped to GY150,000 per picul
 ness and the markets were quiet.
 However, prices increased as soon
 as  money  became  easy.  By  the
 evening of April 6, gold. was quoted
 at as high as GY150,000 per ounce
 while  greenbacks  were   GY32,000.
 The price of rice, which increased to
 the new record of  GY200,000 per
 picul, dropped to GY150,000 per picul
 .on the same day when more arrivals
 reached town.
 Although statistics are  not  yet
 available, well-informed business cir-
 cles state that many firms have clos-
 ed down and many others have gone
 into   bankruptcy.   The  Central
 Bank's policy of selling gold at high
 rates and buying it from the public
 at extremely low rates when money
 turns tight has been the subject of
 strong criticism by the local press
 during the past few days.. It is felt
 that the Central Bank should assist
 businessmen  rather  than  compete
 against them.

 NEWS
 OF THE WEEK
 Delegates Open Peace Talks;
 Nanking Students, Army Clash
 THE  Government's six-man peace
 delegation  headed by  General
 Chang Chih-chung arrived in Peiping
 by air on April 1 to start negotiat-
 ing peace with the Chinese                      Com-
 munists.  Details of the delegation's
 reports to Nanking were kept strictly
 secret and most of the papers. were
 resorting to speculation on the na-
 ture of the current talks.
 The Kuomintang's  official  organ,
 the Central Daily News, published in
 Nanking, disclosed that the delega-
 tion opened negotiations  in Peiping
 with proposals  of an    immediate
 cease-fire and convocation of a multi-
 party  political consultative                  confer-
 ence.  It was even claimed by sources
 close to acting President Li Tsung-
 jen that the Communists had agreed
 in principle to issue a cease-fire order
 shortly.  But  competent observers
 believe   the  matter  is      not  that
 simple.
 It is understood that the Nation-
 alist peace delegation spent the first
 few days in an informal exchange
 of views with individual members of
 the Communist peace delegation in
 order to "cultivate friendship" and
 create a more favorable atmosphere
 for formal talks.  One Chinese paper
 said General Chang Chih-churip, em-
 phasized  the  Government's  sincere
 desire for peace in the interests of
 world peace at an informal meeting
 with the Communist delegation. He
 was further reported to have said
 that mutual recognition  and not
 mutual antagonism was required be-
 tween  the  two parties.                     He  urged
 mutual consultations, not arbitrary
 decision; mutual concessions, not des-
 potism.
 According to  the  same      paper,
 General Chou En-lai, head    of the
 Communist delegation, said in reply:
 "It is only a dream of fools to think
 that a third world war will break
 out." Those "fond of war," General
 Chou was reported to have declared,
 wish to  take  the  opportunity    of
 talking peace to delay the attacks of
 the  Communist  People's  Liberation
 Army so that they can rearm for
 a  counterattack.  He  further    de-
 manded that Communist Leader Mao
 Tze-tung's  eight terms   be  carried
 out and that the Kuomintang de-
 monstrate  its  sincerity                         by  actions
 and facts, not mere words.
 The mood of pessimism is very
 strong  in well-informed  circles  in
 Nanking  regarding  the   prospects
 for peace. In the words of an out-
 spoken and sharp-tongued observer,
 "Maybe it was only a coincidence
 that the long-awaited peace confer-
 ence between the Kuomintang and
 the Chinese Communists should have
 started on April Fools' Day.  It will
 be the Chinese people who are most
 likely to get fo.yled."
 *
 Nanking In,-ident
 SEVERAL hou.-s after the Govern-
 ment's   pease   delegation   left
 Nanking for Peiping, there occurred
 in the capital  r,  highly regrettable
 incident, involving students and army
 officers.  As a r^sult, a student was
 killed and more than one hundred
 others badly injured.  There' were
 different. ver sioi s  of  the  incident.
 But some facts were beyond dispute.
 It was understocd that several thou-
 sand students of the various colleges
 and universitie: in Nanking staged
 a demonstration and went to peti-
 tion                                                              acting  Pre ident  Li  Tsung-jen
 about improving    the    livelihood of
 the students as l releasing students
 who      were  rounded  up  last  year.
 The  students     reasoned ,that  since
 acting  Presidens  Li     had   already
 ordered the release of all political
 prisoners there was no reason what-
 soever                                                                 why th:, arrested    students
 should  still  be  detained.   Besides,
 the recent skyrocketing of commodity
 prices- has mad.   life very difficult
 for the students
 According to Reuter, the demon-
 strating   students                                                                  shouted      such
 slogans  as  '94 ore  American      Aid
 Would    Kill Our     People."     They
 carried posters saying:  "We Oppose
 False  Peace.  ])own  with Bureau-
 cratic                                                              Capitali;i s!  Liquidate   their
 Pr9perties!  W:~ Oppose Conscription
 and Taxation in Kind."
 False Peace
 The    .4ssocAat, d   Press    reported
 that the demonstrating students dis-,
 tributed leaflets which said among
 other things:  "Now we are hearing
 of the departur= of the Government's
 peace delegation.     This is' only a
 gesture to fool 'rhe people since the
 Government hac, lost the war and all
 its troops.... We know this peace
 f,esture is false because the Govern,,
 ment continues  large-scale  conscrip-
 tion of troops, requisitioning of food,
 and because the Government is con-
 tinuing its prep,,rations for war and
 strengthening the Yangtze River de-
 fense."
 The official vex sion, as made public
 by the Government,  described the
 incident as a  `clash" between in-
 activated  Nationalist                                                       army officers
 and the demonstrating students who
 were charged with having aroused
 the  dissatisfacti.mn of  the  officers
 with  their  "pry,-Communist     propa-
 ganda."  But tho official store, failed
 to  explain  wh r  more  than       100
 students   were  . injured   in  this
 "fracas."
 The students told a different story.
 They charged that the whole incident
 was a well-planned job.    They were
 beaten up  with  wooden clubs      by
 more than  1,000 inactivated- army
 officers now under the care of the
 Ministry of National Defense.      It
 was further charged that a large
 group of students was stoned and
 clubbed in front of the gates of the
 Presidential Office.
 The heavy casualties  among the
 students  indicates that the  whole
 matter was something bigger than
 an   "accidental"   soldier - student
 fracas.   Reports on the number of
 students injured also were conflicting.
 The spokesman for the Nanking gar-
 rison  headquarters                                                                                                         said  only  60
 students were injured.  The Ministry
 of Education, in conjunction with the
 presidents of the various universities
 and colleges in the capital, conducted
 a thorough check and announced that
 110 students were injured, one of
 whom died afterwards.  The casualty
 list  made  public  by .the  students
 counted one killed, 70-odd badly in-
 jured, 200-odd slightly injured and
 30 missing.
 Violent Reaction
 The Nanking "incident" caused a
 big stir throughout the country. The
 violent 'reaction on the part of the
 Chinese Communists, as evidenced by
 the sharp attacks voiced by the Pei-
 ping   Red   radio   station;                                                                                                      added
 significance to  the  trouble.   The
 Government authorities were doing
 their best to  hush up  the  matter.
 A special curfew has been enforced in
 Hankow, Foochow and elsewhere to
 ban student  demonstrations.      In
 Shanghai,  precautionary    measures
 were taken     to  forestall similar
 student trouble.   The local Chinese
 and foreign press was called upon
 'by the  Government  authorities  to
 help enlighten the students "not to
 be  utilized   by  some  subversive
 trouble-makers." Fang Chili, director
 of the Shanghai Kuomintang Head-
 quarters, deplored the Nanking in-
 cident and requested the local press
 to  wield  its editorial power  to
 prevent a similar tragedy in Shang-
 hai.
 In   order  to   prevent    further
 trouble, the Government has ordered
 the removal of the inactivated army
 officers from the city to the suburbs.
 But Tenter  reported. April 4 from
 Nanking:  "Last week's   skirmishes
 between                                                                                                          demonstrating  university
 students  and  veteran  Kuomintang'
 officers and N.C.Os back from the
 front threatened to flare up again
 today  when  officers  picketed the
 Dramatic Art School and threatened
 to shoot any student venturing out-
 side...."

 Psychological Warfare
 AT  the  same  time  when  peace
 negotiations between the Kuo-
 mintang and the Communists form-
 ally started in Peiping, there ivas a
 significant exchange of massages be-
 tween             General  Fu  Tso-yi,  former
 Nationalist  commander-in-chief for
 North China and Communist leader
 Mao Tze-tung'.   General  Fu,  in  a
 circular message to Chairman Mao
 Tze-tung,    all   democratic parties,
 people's  organizations   and patriotic
 elements  inside     the Kuomintang,
 pointed out that Peiping was saved
 from destruction by a peace settle-
 ment         and          expressed the  hope  that
 all Kuomintang military and govern-
 ment personnel with patriotic senti-
 ments  would  courageously                     admit
 their mistakes and work for peace,
 on Peiping's pattern. Fu also pled-
 ged y.:,, support to the Communists.
 Mao Tze-tung in his    reph' wel-
 comed Fu's willingness to stand on
 the side of the people and told the
 civil servants in Nationalist  China
 that they would  also  be    welcome
 whoever  they  might   be,  provided
 they distinguished right from wrong.
 Mao's statement is viewed as a
 severe  psychological  blow       to  the
 Nationalists.  Reuter commented:
 "Qualified neutral  observers   here
 today told Reuter that the Chinese
 Communists  dealt the  Kuomintang
 Government what was probably the
 most serious psychological blow so
 far when their chairman, Mr. Mao
 Tse-tung, last night told Nationalist
 officials that `they will be welcome
 to work by us. no matter who they
 are.'
 "Mr.  Mao's  broadcast  statement
 may set at rest lurking' fears in the
 minds of many Kuomintang minor
 officials about what may happen to
 them if the Communists took- over
 all China, these observers said.
 "The  statement  might  also  im-
 measurably  increase  the                    popular
 lethargy among the masses in Na-
 tionalist China towards further re-
 sistance         to the           Communists,  and
 heighten  the  prospects of further
 `piecemeal  peace' on the Peiping
 pattern  unless  it is quickly and
 effectively countered by the Ho Ying-
 chin Government, they said.
 "The statement has virtually cut
 off any further retreat of the Na-
 tionalist Government from the peace
 conference table at Peiping if the
 Communist terms prove too severe,
 these observers thought."
 MacArthur Plan
 T HERE. has  been  march  agitation
 in recent weeks in the      United.
 States  for extending  more  aid  to
 Nationalist China in its  desperate
 fight  against Communism.    Harold
 F.  Stassen proposed a MacArthur
 Plan for Asia patterned after the
 Marshall  Plan  for    Europe.   He
 elaborated on the subject: "We must
 conclude we are foolhardy to con-
 tribute         by         our  action  or  by  our
 withdrawal  of  aid,  to  the  Com-
 States.  Before                                                                                                   the  signature, the
 Soviet Government had protested to
 the Atlantic countries  against  the
 project, which it charged was ag-
 gr'essive and aimed at Soviet Russia.
 It  further  charged  that  the pact
 violated the United Nations charter
 and the Potsdam and Yalta Agree-
 ments                                                                                                  and  contradicted  both  the
 Arlg'lo-Russian  and  Franco-Russian
 non-aggression treaties.
 President Harry S. Truman signi-
 ficantly                                                                                                    emphasized  that  the  in-
 fluence of the pact "will be felt not
 only in the area it specifically covers
 but throughout the world."   He also
 hailed the pact as a "shield against
 aggression."
 But  Senator       RoLert    A. Taft
 thought  otherwise. He     said  the
 pact might increase chances of an-
 other world war and' called on the
 Senate and public for a "complete
 discussion" on its issues.
 Taft,  powerful  chairman  of  the
 Senate Republican Policy Committee,
 expressed   grave  fears  about  the
 consequences of the pact in an address
 prepared  for  broadcast.    He said
 despite provisions reserving to Con-
 gress the right to declare war the
 pact in fact would bind the United
 States morally to go to war if any
 member- nation in Europe is attack-
 ed either by Russia or  some other
 power.
 "I am inclined to believe, there-
 fore, that if we adopt     the  treaty
 we should do so with the frank ad-
 mission that we are committing onr-
 selves to go to war if Russia attacks
 one of the Western European na-
 tions," he said.
 While  he  did  not consider  this
 as  "conclusive  argument"   against
 the treaty, Taft said he was fearful
 that  its  terms  might  "make    us
 a policeman for all Western Europe"
 even if Russia became peaceful in
 the meantime. His most serious con-
 cern, however, was that pact nations
 "may  give   the  Russians  the  im-
 pression, at least justified by them-
 selves,                                                                                                that they   are  ringing them
 around with armies for the purpose
 of  undertaking   aggressive  action
 when the time comes.
 "They may feel that, if war is to
 come, they had better undertake it
 before these  armaments  are   built
 up. Under such circumstances, the
 pact, instead of being a deterrent
 to war, might become an incitement
 to war and make it more probable
 instead of less."
 Reaction in this country .to  the

 Foreign Affairs Minister of the Na-
 tionalist                                                                                                    Government  George    Yeh
 told the Chinese press that the pact
 would probably avert a third world
 war.  A joint statement issued by
 leaders of the Chinese Communist
 party and various democratic parties
 and   groupings condemned the At-
 lantic Pact as endangering the peace
 and security of mankind and. aiming
 at provoking a new aggressive world
 war.  It promised that the Chinese
 people  would  fight  shoulder   to
 shoulder with Soviet Russia if the
 Atlantic Pact signatories. should dare
 assist by materials a  l  by counsel,

 But Americans who are watching
 the China situation ci the spot feel
 that Stassen did not know what. he
 was talking about.  I i this connec-

 "Americans  in   China  read  the

 "Most of them feel that Commun-

 Chinese Magazine Roundup
 New Hope
 BEGINNING from its
 March 21 issue, the
 New Hope Weekly has
 printed a series of in-
 teresting and informa-
 tive articles about the
 factional  strife  within
 tical  Science  Cr rup,  and the  Re-
 formationists (tli, followers of Wang
 Ching-wei    after the   Nanking and
 Wu-han open rif', ).
 "In its struggle against the Com-
 munists, the CC is waging an ideo-
 logical  war  a:nsi.                                                                   the  common
 enemy o'f , all K;'i TT cliques, but in
 its struggle with fellow KMT mem-
 bers, the matter boils down to be
 that of a struggv:v for power, or to
 be exact, for pr vate interests."
 The CC clique managed to control
 the    Government    through    the
 machinery of the party but the mass
 recruiting of  C overnment officials
 into the party h is made the KMT
 become  a loose  organization,  the
 magazine disclose.
 ";Under   the  principle  that  the
 party is all powerful, it' has always
 been the  goal c f the  CC to put
 everything under the control of the.
 party," the artic e explains.  "Ac-
 cordingly, the rune  was                                                               formulated
 that all public f inctionaries of the
 National  Govern vent must   become
 members of the ]-MT.  Also, it was
 stipulated that all officers of the armed
 forces have to be party members. A
 system of the  s(s-called `special re-
 gistration  of                                                                  pvrty  members' was
 then set up to  'acilitate the entry
 of elite meniher. of society into the
 KMT. This me ssure, however, by
 opening the dou) to   numerous op-
 portunistic   warlords,                                                                 bureaucrats
 and politicians who thus flocked into
 the KMT, had th. effect of seriously
 undermining th   strength  of  the
 party and of gr,.dually bringing it
 to its present pli rht.  Later on, the
 Central Training Corps was estab-
 lished as a mean ; of inducting peo-
 ple into the KM' I'.                                                               Those who are
 given one  month of  training  are
 supposed to beco7:re `marginal' mem-
 bers, while those -.vho go through six
 months  of training      in the `senior
 training class' ar- absorbed into the
 nucleus of the party.   But all in
 all, this practice has done, more harm
 to the KMT  th,;n good,   since the
 greater part of !he people inducted
 into the party ar  opportunists who
 are  only interes ed' in  their  own
 political advancen.ent, while a large
 number of men cf real talent become
 alienated from thr party."
 The  phenomeu--1 success     of  the
 CC clique has be 'n due to the fact
 that it has the llessing and strong
 backing  of  Gen,rralissimo   Chiang
 Kai-shek, the at',gaznie points out,
 saying:
 "That the    CC has  always been
 able to.have the upper hand in this
 political struggh  is entirely due to
 the  unshakable ronfidencc of  the
 `Supreme. Leader' in the loyalty of
 their clique, and is not due to any
 xtraordinary skin  or forsight  as
 isplayed by  its;  members    It is
 Chen brothers and though he, too,
 enjoyed   the   confidence  of  the
 Supreme Leader."
 Masses Weekly
 IN Shih-fu makes a detailed study
 in Masses Weeklji of February
 3, of the lessons of Chinese revolu-
 tions and  comes to the      conclusion
 that the present revolutionary move-
 ment  in  China  is  quite  different
 from the revolutions of 1911 and
 1926-27 in Chinese history.
 "First," he says, "the historical
 characteristics of the present revolu-
 tion are  vastly different  from, the
 revolutions of the past. The Chi-
 nese revolution has developed to a
 point at which the relative strength
 of  the  revolution  and  counter-re-
 volution      has  undergone    a  funda-
 mental change.                                                                                                         Today, the people's
 strength of the Chinese revolution,
 which is based on the     ;proletariat
 and  the peasantry    in  cooperation
 with the petty bourgeoisie and na-
 the Kuomintang.                     Several paragraphs
 dealing with the CC clique are given
 below.
 With regard to the origin of the
 CC clique, the magazine has this to
 say:   The  CC     clique  began its
 life as an anti-Communist organiza-
 tion, in the form of a so-called AB
 (Anti-Bolshevik)   group organized
 by KMT members in-1927.   Later
 .on, as the KMT organization became
 bigger and the control of the party
 became more centralized, the leading
 elements  of  the  AB  group  were
 absorbed into the Organization Do-
 partment of the KMT.                         Finally, the
 AB group was completely dissolved
 and its membership came under the
 control of the  Chen brothers  who
 were then in charge of the organiza-
 tion  work of                     the  KMT.  In  this
 sense, CC really meant `Centralized
 Control' instead of the Chen broth-
 ers as is generally explained.
 According to  the  magazine,  the
 activities of the  CC clique spread
 from party affairs to the political
 field.  "In the beginning," it writes,
 "the clique  was only  absorbed  in
 party affairs and cultural activities.
 In was only after 1930, after the
 defeat of Generals Feng Yu-hsiang
 and Yen Hsi-shan, that the CC clique
 extended their  influence over poli-
 tical affairs.   So far as numerical
 strength is concerned, the CC clique
 probably  heads  the  list  of   the
 various factions   inside  the  KMT.
 But its leadership is too poor, and
 talented people  preferred  to  stay
 away because they did not like being
 bossed  around.     Chang  Li-sheng,
 top-level leader of the CC   clique,
 once    significantly   remarked that,
 when    he  was  the     Director of
 Organization of the KMT, ' he did
 not even have the authority to ap-
 point                      or dismiss  any  of      his  low
 subordinates. The well-known Chow
 Fu-hai and Ting Mo-tsun, both of
 them high KMT officials  who de-
 fected to the Japanese to become
 officials in the puppet Nanking re-
 gime, were  all active                      members of
 the CC before they decided to de-
 sert.                      Others, like  Huang  Yu-jen
 who are now known for their.scath-
 ing attacks against the                  CIC in the
 Legislative Yuan, were also formerly
 followers of the Chen brothers and
 had been sent abroad by them. for
 advanced training. Still others, like
 Chu Chia-hwa and Chang Li-sheng,
 though fostered within the folds of
 the' CC, have  now cut  themselves
 loose and are  wont to  oppose the
 CC in all sorts of manners.
 ,
 g
 political  enemies  come the  Com-      though he was in all respects much       the helm.  This is another guaran-

 solely on this  to count that  Yang
 Yung-.tai, the la!- all powerful chief
 of the Political :'eience Group, was
 tional bourgeoisie, has far exceeded
 the strength of the counter-revolu-
 tionary landlords, bureaucrats                                                                                                        and
 big  bourgeoisie who are  supported
 by American imperialists.  The coun-
 ter-revolution is  well on the                                                                                                              high

 volution  is marching                                                                                                         forward   by
 leaps and. bounds....
 "Second, the  prevailing                                                                                                   inter-
 national  situation  is                                                                                                          also different
 from what it was in 1911 and 1927.
 After the Second World    War, the
 whole world split into two  hostile
 political camps as the result of the
 attempts made by      American  im-
 perialism  to  dominate  the                                                                                                          whole
 world and invade the countries in
 both Europe and Asia. The line-up
 is quite clear. One side is headed
 by  the United States, comprising
 the British,. French and other  im-
 perialists.  The other is led by So-
 viet Russia, comprising the new de-
 mocracies  in  Eastern  Europe                                                                                                          and
 the revolutionary movements in the
 colonial and semi-colonial countries
 in the Orient. The former is an
 anti-democratic  imperialistic united
 front; the latter, an anti-imperialis-
 tic democratic united front.                                                                                                      Be-
 cause of the post-war political and
 economic  trouble in  Britain   and
 France and the          United  States, it
 is impossible for the imperialists to
 act in concert against the Chinese
 revolution.  The rapid growth of re-
 construction in    Soviet Russia                                                                                                           and
 other  Eastern        European countries
 has added to the strength of the
 world  revolution,       which  is   also
 superior  to  the global counter-re-
 volution.   This is favorable to the
 Chinese revolution.
 "Third, the Chinese    Communists
 who are leading the Chinese revolu-
 tion are no longer inexperienced and
 incompetent.   On-the contrary, the

 US Magazine Roundup
 Foreign Policy Report
 SIGNIFICANT analysis of the
 North Atlantic Defense Pact is
 carried in the February 15 issue of
 Foreign Policy Reports published by
 the Foreign Policy Association.  The
 study  contains  pertinent  facts re-
 garding the background of the pact,
 written by Blair Bolles, and a dis-
 cussion of the pros and cons, con-
 tributed by Vera Micheles Dean.
 In outlining the background of the
 pact, Mr. Bolles recalls that the idea
 of a military alliance between the
 United States and Great Britain was
 first suggested by Winston Churchill
 in his Fulton, Missouri, speech on
 March 6, 1.946 and received a cold
 reception at that time. With British
 Foreign  Secretary  Bevin's proposal
 in January, 1948, for the formation
 of  a  Western   Union  consisting, of
 France,  England and    the Benelux
 countries, however, and the develop-
 ments in Czechoslovakia. - that Feb-
 ruary,                    the   traditional American
 antipathy toward military alliances
 began  to  dissolve, he points  out.
 The ice  was     broken  for official
 American action on an Atlantic Pact
 with the passage by the Senate on
 June  11, 1948, of the Vandenberg
 Resolution proposing that the United
 States   pursue  international peace
 and  security  by the  "progressive
 development of regional and other
 collective   arrangements for   in-
 dividual and collective self-defense"
 "Encouraged  by  the resolution,"
 Mr. Bolles writes,-"the State Depart-
 ment in July initiated conversations
 with   the   Brussels  powers   and
 Canada" and on December 10 started
 negotiations on the Atlantic treaty.
 From here on Mrs.      Than  +~tres
 assumptions of the countries benefit-
 ing by                                                the  Marshall  plan.  Others.
 believe that it will ;)rove impossible
 to restore the sens,c of security....
 until  Russian  troops....are with-
 drawn from Germany and Austria,
 and therefore urge, nstcad, negotia-
 tions with the USSR for a general
 or at least partial settlement on the
 continent."
 The State Depart.rient, Mrs. Dean
 says, answers the ti ?st of these ar-
 guments by giving *s onomic recovery
 priority  over  rearmament.  How-
 ever,  she  points  out,  opponents                                                    of
 the pact contend tha:_ "the very pro-
 cess  of                                                         rearmameen1 will - generate
 fears which still further rearmament
 will be needed to allay, creating a
 mounting spiral of expenditures in
 which military estimates will prevail
 over considerations +jf economic and
 social recovery."
 No direct answer, she says, to the
 second argument-- he need for a
 general settlement with the USSR-
 has been given by tie State Depart-
 ment, "whose basic premise is that
 the activities of the Soviet Govern-
 ment since the war save endangered
 peace   and   prevented   recovery."
 The factor that it counted on to
 provide American pr'blic support for
 the pact, Mrs. Dear writes, is that
 it  safeguards the  American   "con-
 stitutional process" }'y heaving in the
 hands of Congress the power to de-
 clare war.  "This ve?y feature, how-
 ever," she notes, "arouses the most
 serious  objections  i-n  the part of
 the nations of Western Europe" who
 realize they are tai? ing the risk of
 antagonizing Russia and want to be
 sure of automatic IIS action in re-
 turn.
 partment, she writes, "the core of
 the case for the pact" is that "if
 world  recovery  is  to  progress....
 `the sense of security must be re-
 stored.' "  Therefore,                      "the   North
 Atlantic defense pact, backed by in-
 tegration    of the  armed  forces                     of
 Western European nations furnished
 with American armaments either as
 outright gift  or on terms of lend-
 lease, is a necessary corollary of the
 European Recovery Program."
 Those who question this thesis, she
 continues, "raise two principal argu-
 ments.                    Some contend that the mili-
 tary                 program  envisaged          under  the
 North Atlantic defense pact would
 have an effect exactly contrary to
 that  desired  by Washington, since
 the necessity  of  diverting  ;existing
 economic  resources  to       armaments
 Would  delay,  and  perhaps    actually
 jeopardize fulfillment of the Euro-
 pean                Recovery      Program,  both    by
 reducing the   amount of American
 and   Western  European        manpower
 and materials available for peace-
 time production,                  and by making it
 politically  difficult  to achieve  the
 revival of East-West trade on the
 continent which was one of the basic
 For Or Against UN?
 NEXT comes the question of the
 United   Nation:.    The   State
 Department, Mr:s. i):ean says, main-
 tains that the  pact  is in harmony
 with the UN by virtue of Articles
 51  and  52  in the harter.  Article
 51` provides that "Nothing.... shall
 impair the inherent right of indivi-
 dual or collective ca lf-defense if an
 armed attack occurs against a Mem-
 ber of the United Nations, until the
 Security  Council   'mas  taken  the
 measures necessary to maintain in-
 ternational                                                                peace   and   security."
 Article  52  says  that  "Nothing. , . .
 precludes the Exists nee of regional
 arrangements or agencies for dealing
 with such matters relating to the
 maintenance          of int. rnational peace
 and security as are appropriate for
 regional  action...   consistent with
 the Purposes and 1'rinciples of the
 United    Nations."  'n         this   connt,,: --
 tion,  Mrs.                                                        Dean  :recalls  that              the
 subject of    re?'ioiFi arrangements
 came up  at  both     the. Du'-bartort
 Oaks and San Fran-isco   conferences
 with regard to regional. agreements
 already in existence in the Western
 Hemisphere and the "problems that
 might  arise  if the former    enemy
 states should resort  to  aggression
 during the transitional period before
 peace  treaties  had been concluded
 and  responsibility for keeping  the
 peace had been transferred to the
 United Nations Organization." Chap-
 ter VIII of the Charter was drafted
 with these problems  in mind,    she
 says, and contains article 52.
 Mrs. Dean quotes "a distinguished
 international ' law   expert,   Hans
 Kel'sen," as saying that Article 51
 was intended to be "a provisional
 and temporary measure" to be used
 "until"  the  Security  Council took
 appropriate  action  and  "not  as  a
 substitute   for  it."  Therefore, she
 says, it has been argued that any
 pact such as the Atlantic one should
 be "firmly    and unmistakably 'sub-
 ordinated                                                                                                         to the authority of the
 Security     Council."  Otherwise, the
 veto  power   possessed  by  the  US,
 Britain and France might conceivably
 be used "to prevent direct     action
 by the Security Council."
 "A second major objection to the
 North  Atlantic  pact,"  Mrs.    Dean
 writes,     "is  raised by those  who
 wonder how such a pact would affect
 the position of the colony - owning
 nations of Western Europe in their
 relations to the dependent peoples
 of Asia.  Would the United States,
 it  is  asked, in underwritir' - the
 security and  economic recovery of
 Western Europe, be expected also to
 underwrite the status quo in Indo-
 nesia, Indo-China, Malaya, and other
 colonial areas, whose present condi-
 tion of unrest has a direct impact
 on  the  security  and  on the  eco-
 nomies of Britain, France and the
 Netherlands?   Will the nations of
 Western Europe be free to use the
 arms  they    max  receive from the
 United  States --- subdue native up-
 risings?"
 Closely related to this, she says,
 "is -the question whether the security
 of nations can be defended solely by
 military  means    against   external
 threats  or external  aggression,  or
 whether the main problem some na-
 tions                                                                                                   face is  the possibility of in-
 ternal upheavals .... There is danger
 . that the fear of instability and
 disorder understandably generated in
 the United States by the desire to
 see the ERP succeed within the time
 limit of four years set for it may
 cause some Americans to favor the
 maintenance of existing regimes and
 economic and social conditions, and
 to consider any attempt to alter the
 existing state of affairs as defiance
 of  ERP.   The intimate linking of
 ERP with rearmament might then
 conceivably induce the United States
 to permit the countrie  benefiting by
 American aid to use their armaments
 for the suppression of internal dis-
 orders."

 What Chinese Papers Say
 T HE  Army attack

 Nanking.  and  the
 formal opening  of
 peace  talks in Pei-

 for their freedom  and. to fight for
 peace, they must be determined  to
 proceed  thoroughly  and completely
 with the  task  of wiping out this
 group of war criminals.   The Nan-

 Chairman  Mao  Tse-tung    of  the
 Central Committe<  of the Commu-
 nist  Party,                                                        and  primarily the 'first
 condition for the 'unishment of war
 criminals, cannot permit of any re-
 vision..  .  .                                                          .
 "The occurrence  of the Nanking
 tragedy at such a time and at such
 a locality as it did cannot but lead
 us  to question tie    Nanking  Peace
 Delegation:     Where  is  the 'peace'
 advocated  by   v?~ur     Government?
 The fact is that the Nanking re-
 actionary                                                                 and   traitorous   govern-
 ment  from                                                                which  the Delegation
 comes has   seriously        violated  the
 basic conditions of the peace negotia-
 State.                                                                                                        The  people throughout  the
 country  unanimously  demand that
 the peace talks must be successful
 and that failure cannot be rormiteed.
 Violent  propaganda outbursts will
 only  obstruct sake thinking     and
 clear understanding, and lead to un-
 favorable reactions from the people."
 The   Shun    Pao agreed:        "If the,
 peace talks are to succeed, mime-
 diate                                                                                                     suspension  of  all   military
 orerations should be the first  pre-
 requisite."
 But on the other hand the same
 papers asked   the   Government   to
 strengthen   its  war preparations
 south of the Yangtze. The Chung
 Yang Jih Pao emphasized the im-
 portance of the defense of Yangtze,
 while the Ho Ping Jih. Pa?o, general-
 ly  regarded                                                                                                   as  mouthpiece of the
 Nationalist   army,   explained  that
 making war preparations do not run
 counter to talking peace.
 "To be prepared for war and to
 attend actively to the defense of the
 Yangtze really do not conflict with
 the  peace efforts,"  the  paper  said.
 "Instead,  such  measures  will      be
 helpful to the peace cause. It is
 obvious that once our defense of the
 Yangtze  is  successfully taken care
 of, the peace terms, of the Commu-
 nists will not be so harsh, and hopes
 for peace will grow.       Moreover, if
 the  Communists - cannot cross the
 Yangtze, they cannot fight even 'if
 they want to, and they will have to
 cease hostilities even if they do not
 want to.  As long, as the Commu-
 nists  are  prevented from crossing
 the Yangtze, the  Government may
 continue to be on the defensive and
 not cross the river for a counter-
 offensive.                                                                                                         In such a case, the war
 wi)W." automatically cease to exist, and
 peace will follow."
 topics of editorial comment in the
 Chinese press.  The signing of the
 Atlantic  Pact in  Washington 4also
 drew some comment.
 Nanking Tragedy  .
 IN  commenting   on  the      Nanking
 Incident,  the  Chung   Ylang     Jih
 Pao, official organ of the    Kuomin-
 tang, advised the students to take
 into consideration the extreme grav-
 ity of the current situation and re-
 frain from "making trouble."
 "It is incumbent  on    the     young
 students themselves to treasure the
 great    sympathy  which the public
 exhibits for them, and therefore to
 be constantly awake to the need of
 reviewing   their  own  actions," the
 paper said.  "Today the. situation is
 too critical.  On the one hand, the
 peace talks are being begun, but on
 the  other   hand,  the Communist
 Army        north  of  the Yangtze is
 steadily pointing its gun toward the
 south and advancing by degrees.  .
 "Every one who  looks         forward
 to  the realization of  peace   must,
 therefore,  value  the  present  pre-
 carious moment, and seek to promote
 real  peace  with    a cool  head, by
 differentiating  right  from   wrong,
 and investigating carefully the vari-
 ous             issues        involved  in the  peace
 movement.      Violent  propaganda
 efforts which are only partial to the
 interests  of  one   party and  blind
 rabble-rousing can only confuse is-
 sues and mess up the main prob-
 lems.   Unnecessary  demonstrations
 can      only  give rise to unfavorable
 reaction from the people and do the
 cause  of      peace  more  harm  than
 good.   Young people are emotional
 and easily excited. Since the stu-
 dent movement of the past two or
 three? years has produced unfavor-
 able impressions and repercussions,
 the  students should do some hard
 thinking and should increase their
 sense of self-awakening."
 The   Nanking  incident   drew   a
 sharply-worded  editorial  from the
 Communist New China News Agency.
 A  summary of  the  editorial,  as
 printed in several papers in. Shang-
 hai, is given below:
 "The Nanking Student Tragedy of
 April  1  once  more shows  to the
 Chinese people that it.is impossible
 to   expect   the   Kuomintang war
 criminals to' repent  and lay down
 their arms. The Nanking tragedy
 tells the Chinese. people once more
 that any attitude of leniency and
 protection in dealing with this group
 of  war   criminals  will  only mean
 that  peace  iii, China  will  not  be
 realized.    The  Nanking      tragedy

 What
 THE current peace talk and the
 future  of  Christianity  under

 the US press.  Other comment dealt
 with the recent cultural and scien-
 tific conference on world peace held
 in New York.

 Christianity In China
 ~'HE Christian Science Monitor, in
 an editorial entitled "Christian-
 ity and Communism in Asia," said:
 "Since common ownership of pro-
 perty in the  early              Christian. com-
 munity  broke  down                  through   the
 weight of human greed,  Christians
 have  recognized in. varying degrees
 that their `kingdom' was not of this
 world. It could be   brought  into
 human affairs only   through indivi-
 dual regeneration and gradual social
 improvements following  from more
 Christian lives.
 "But social improvements      have
 often been slow in, coming. In Asia,
 for instance, the effects of Western
 exploitation  have sometimes  been
 more evident  than  the    effects of
 Western Christianity.   Even Chris-
 tians of the East are asking whether
 a new social system  may  not be
 necessary."
 The Monitor   then  referred to a
 letter written by T. C. Chao, dean of
 the School of Religion at Yenching
 University   and    one        of   the
 six   presidents of   the   World
 Council  of  Churches, which  was
 published recently in the Christian
 Century.  The Monitor says the let-
 ter "speaks of the rejoicing of Chin-
 ese Christian at being 'liberated'. by
 the Communists from the Kuomin-
 tang regime" and quotes it as say-
 ing:
 "An unexpected thing has been the
 speed with which the Communists win
 and Kuomintang forces fall to pieces.
 No thoughtful  Christian  in  China
 can regard  this  unexpected  speed.,
 without a deep sense of gratitude
 to God. Collapse of the Kuomintang
 armies means   cessation  of   war,
 which is very much desired by all,
 while it causes Communists to recon-
 sider their policies and  to                become
 moderate .
 "Religion will- be indeed hated and
 despised, but  also  tolerated; and
 religion will be in need of a sort of
 reaceful persecution to emerge from
 cultus to reality      . To my mind,
 we Christians in China are facing
 a most -creative, period of witness-
 bearing.  One ;s thrilled at the dan-
 gers {and -opportunities confronting.
 Christianity in.mingled proportions."
 The Monitor comments:   "Chris-
 tians in the  West  may                not take
 so  ebullient  a  view.   The Chris-
 tianity which hopes to cooperate with
 dogmatic Communism may be in for
 sad disillusionment. But there is a
 tremendous    challenge to Western
 Christians    in . this new develop-
 ment.

 Peace Talks
 W
 THE   New        York
 Ti nes took a pes-
 sitnisti                                      view of the
 cucren, peace talks in
 Puipiw,, voicing  the
 opinict that,   since
 no chance to come o ,it on top, they
 should be called "capitulation" con-
 ferences.                                                   The paper said:
 "There is little  it i.son to be op-
 timistic about the `peace' conference
 that opened in China April 1.   If
 Nanking's delegates wake an honest
 effort to reach a ger-rine compromise
 of differences they wiii fail.  And the
 alternative is outriga.; surrender. In-
 deed, the prelinl:inari.!s  that led to
 the choice of the clanking delega,
 tion, coupled with the daily insistence
 of the Coniniurtist; North China radio
 that the only basis  for  discussion
 was   the  eight-polo .   program of
 Mao Tze-tung, invite the suggestion
 that `peace'  conference          is a mis-
 nomer.                                                   `Capitulati,:n'           conference
 would be more accur-rte.
 "The Nanking deli gates were ap-
 parently under few 'llusions.                                                              They
 described themselves as at the edge
 of a bottomless abye;.   Even more
 pessimistic   was   t'aeir assertion
 that   no   insui mou itable difficul-
 ties need be faced,  if                                                         there  were
 `mutual confidence,  ?nutuar  under-
 standing                                                   and mutual               concessions.'
 Those delegates arc    all old enough
 and worldly wise  enough to know
 that to. speak of  in ituality in con-
 fidence, understandin_                                                              and conces-
 sions in respect to a conference with
 the Chinese, or any other, Commun-
 ists, ., is to employ a contradiction in
 terms.
 "Repeatedly,, the Communist radio
 has insisted that it hts no confidence
 in Nanking, nothing but,  contempt.,
 rather than understa cding, for Nan-
 king's leaders, and  no                                                            disposition
 have clamped  down  the  `bamboo
 curtain' of secrecy.  It is a mistake
 to talk  about `censorship' in Com-
 munist China.                                                                                                   There isn't a censor-
 ship, because there is nothing to Cen-
 sor.  The press and the  public will
 not be represented at any stage or
 in any degree in   the negotiations.
 What the world finally learns about
 what happened will presumably be
 what the Chinese Communists think
 it ought to learn.
 . "These have been sorry days for
 the ` Republic of China.  And  few
 have been. sorrier than that on which
 these Nanking  delegates `go before
 their conquerors and their judges to
 discuss the terms- of their sentence."
 Cultural Conference
 THE Philadelphia  Inquirer  sup-
 ported the State                                                                                                      Department's
 assertion that the cultural and scien-
 tific conference for world peace held
 recently in New York was a "sound-
 ing board  for  Communist                                                                                                propa-
 ganda."  The paper declared:
 "Our  thoughts-our   efforts-are
 directed toward peace. But we have
 learned, and we must . not forget,
 that while Russia's spokesmen shout
 about peace, they are putting bale-
 ful pressure on Iran, looming threat-
 eningly  over  Finland    and                                                                                                spying
 upon every free country on the globe.
 Americans should keep their minds
 free of needless fears about all this,
 preserve . their strength  and  their
 will to, defend themselves and make
 Russia's acts, not  words, the only
 basis of judgment   about what the
 Soviet Union really stands for.
 The Christian Science Monitor ex-
 pressed belief ,that the meeting only
 caused  "confusion;,"    The  paper
 said :
 "Perhaps only political innocents
 could have, expected  this  sort  of
 thing to promote peace.   Americans
 can, by frank questioning of national
 policies, help to shape them toward
 peace.  But similar criticisms from
 men who strain at gnats of Demo-
 cratic failings but  swallow camels
 of totalitarian oppression are little
 likely to foster either reform, or good
 will.  ... .
 "This meeting sought to promote
 the kind of `peace' desired by those
 who say:  `We must cooperate.  It
 is just a matter of good  will and
 tolerance.'   But on  that kind of
 peace we should have liked to hear
 from those who have been liquidated
 in countries taken over by Commun-
 ists  when                                                                                                    America was 'cooperat-

 e   ma   eek y Review, April 9, 1949-
 The Review's English Lesson
 MR. Al. L. Chen suggested that we discuss a Time Magazine
 story, from  the  March 7 issue, concerning  President
 Truman,     titled r'Auother  Think  Coming."       Unfortunately,
 there is not enough space to reprint the whole story, so we
 shall try to explain some of the expressions used, as usuaI:.
 Another think coming:  A slangy phrase
 used to describe someone who has guessed wrong,
 who anticipates something which will not happen ;
 it is usually contemptuous.        "If he thinks I'nf
 going to wait all day, he's got another think
 coming."
 Off-the-cuff :  Extempore, as a speech.
 Nostalgic : Homesick.
 Smart-aleck:    Smug, self-satisfied with own
 cleverness; smarty.
 Move on:  This phrase can be used in two
 ways : the first, in its literal sense, to gb on, for-
 ward, ahead; the second, to describe committee
 action or decision. It is not clear from the context
 as given ("And when it is time for them
 (members of my staff) to be moved on,, I do the
 moving....") whether the meaning is to decide
 which persons are wanted on the staff, or to decide
 which are to be discharged (i.e., moved on some-
 where else).
 Blair House: A house near the White House,
 which is used to. receive distinguished visitors ;
 sometimes referred to as the "Little White
 House."
 Ineffectual gesture:  A move or action that
 has no result; also, empty gesture. Sweeping the
 sea, or commanding the tides to stand still, are
 ineffectual gestures.
 Cracking:   (Also crackling), as used in
 "cracking over the telegraph wires," is an onoma-
 topoetic word, describing the sound Qf  the
 electric sparks.
 Contrite:  Showing sorrow or regret for
 having committed a fault : repentant.
 Tentative: Of the natures of an experiment;
 something offered provisionally.
 The Word That Came td Dinner:  This is a
 paraphrase of the title of a comedy that had a
 long and successful run in the United States.
 It describes the sufferings caused an innocent
 family by an irascible celebrity, who came to their
 home for dinner, slipped and injured himself and
 was forced to remain in the household until well
 enough to move.  Thus, as used here, it indicates
 that the unpleasant phrase made such a stir that
 it could not be quietly forgotten.
 Sedate:  Quiet, calm, serene, serious, staid.
 Gamy:    Highly-flavored; gamy language in-
 cludes highly. colored expressions which often. are
 not admitted in so-called polite society. Also,
 "racy."                                       .
 Clucked: Literally, made noises like'a hen.
 Since the sounds sometimes' made by a person in
 reprimanding a younger one, for example, are
 similar, anyone who "clucks"  admonishes or
 LXXVII
 their editorial pages," the image is of a flock of
 fussy old hens, being most upset at some action
 or statement, and reproving its author.
 Cautious:  To give cautious approval is to
 approve so carefully, with so many "ifs, ands
 and buts", that its force is weakened.  In some-
 what similar fashion, the phrase "damn with
 faint praise" means to approve so cautiously, and
 with so many reservations, that the effect is one
 of disapproval.
 Showman: A producer of plays, operas, etc.
 As used in the story, the meaning is extended to
 refer to a columnist, considered by the writer
 to be interested only in attracting publicity.
 Hardy:  Bold,  brave,  resolute, confident,
 strong, firm, long-enduring. The "hardy expert,
 on the burning word" referred to, H. L. Mencken,
 has long been one of the most outspoken journal-
 ists in America.
 Burning word: Here used to refer to profane
 expressions, insults, gamy language.
 Complained, complains:  In referring to a
 statement made in a book, either the present or
 the past tense would seem correct, depending
 upon whether the writer refers to. the moment
 when the author set his words down (past tense),
 or the moment when the reader sees the same
 words (present tense).
 Fudge:  Nonsense, piffle, when used as an
 interjection; usually cited in derision, as being
 sissified.
 Sis-boom-ah: A college football cheer in the
 US; hence, anything with sis-boom-ah has spirit,
 verve, enthusiasm, drive.
 *
 THE following sentence, with which Mr. Mencken is quoted
 as continuing, his remarks upon the phrase that caused
 the uproar, we quote in full:   "Put the second person pro-
 noun and the adjective old in front of it and scarcely enough
 bounce is left in it to shake up an archdeacon."  The phrase
 then becomes, "You old son of ' a bitch."
 Bounce:  Bouyancy, verve, drive, energy.
 Shake up an archdeacon: Amaze or unsettle
 a church official who is next in rank. below a
 bishop.  In other words, Mr. Mencken says that
 the phrase, as amended, has little in it to amaze
 or shock, probably because it is often used
 jocularly.
 Opprobrious: Attaching disgrace; as, an op=
 probrious 'epithet.
 *      *      *
 ~1 WE are asked to recommend some of the best magazines
 devoted to English Language and literature published in
 the US.   This is a difficult question to answer, since there
 are scholarly periodicals which deal with fine points of.grani-
 mar and philology, there are good journals for a more general
 interest, written well,, and there are journals, such as Time
 Magazine or the New Yorker which have developed a style
 of 'their own.  Of the more general type, Harpers and the
 Atlantic Monthly are among the best as far as the quality of
 the language is concerned.  The Saturday Review of Literature.

 LETTERS
 From The People
 Comments from readers on current topics
 are  cordially  invited:  their opinions,  how-
 ever, do not necessarily represent the views
 of The China Weekly Review.
 American Aid
 To The Editor:
 I have  read the          article "A    Chinese
 View of American Aid" in the March 19
 issue of the Review and strongly sup-
 port the stand taken by Mr. C. Y. W
 Meng.   I should say it represents the
 views of millions of our people.
 The US is failing in its policy to-
 ward China, and we oppose any military
 aid program "to prolong our civil war."
 As Mr. Meng pointed out, there are very
 few expressions  of gratitude from the
 eaters of ECA rice, and Mr. La.pham's
 proposal for new aid to the "Nationalists"
 was unanimously opposed by professors,
 peace-sponsors and even some legislators.
 During the past ten years China has
 been a semi-feudal country,   As vivid
 as, any picture is its personal regime,
 corrupt dictatorship and the. misery of
 its people.  We Chinese would only wel-
 come                         American  aid  that  would  really
 help to bring about democracy, freedom]
 equality and a new China.

 Christian Writes
 To The Editor:
 I am a Christian living in Wusih.  I
 am also a Review reader.   The article,
 "Christian  Missions in China"  in the
 April  2  Review  helped me understand
 many things which have been puzzling
 me for a long time.  But I wonder about
 the point that preachers are too much
 in favor of maintaining the status quo
 and individualism, for in China today,
 in many small towns, the churches are
 not prosperous.
 In  my  mind the  whole  problem  of
 the relation  between the  churches and
 the revolution is  full of contradictions
 and it is difficult to obtain a balanced
 view. I wonder if you could ask the
 author of this article to write something
 more on the problem, for I am certain
 that there are many Christians like my-
 self who  need  help  on  how -to be a
 Christian in. the future.

 Supports Premier Ho
 To The Editor:.
 I was very interested in reading your
 introduction  to  our  new  premier,    Ho
 Ying-chin, in the March 26 issue of the
 Review.
 It was reported that General He, when
 the Young Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang
 kidnapped  Chiang      Kai-shek  in  1936,
 wanted to bomb  Sian where the Gen-
 eralissimo was being held, but that he
 was  dissuaded  from   doing  so.  I  per-
 sonally think He was blameless as far
 as this incident was concerned.
 General Ho, it will be remembered, has
 always  been  against  the    Communists

 was ordered by him.  Ile was later sent
 abroad when General George C. Marshall
 was attempting to mediate between the
 Nationalists and  the  Communists,  for
 there was a feeling that Ho was block-
 ing efforts to negotiate a peaceful settle-
 ment.  However, many people are con-
 vinced  that  General                                                                                                                        Ho  underwent  a
 change of heart while he was .abroad.
 His  speeches abroad were tinged with
 a slightly leftist coloring.
 After his return to China, General Ho
 remained inactive for a period until the
 time came when he was asked by Acting
 President Li Tsung-jen to become pre-
 mier.  Immediately  after  General  Ho's
 appointment, there was much talk about
 injecting new blood into the Nationalist
 Government.   Although there has been
 much speculation as to whether or not
 he could successfully open peace talks
 with the Communists, I still trust and
 support him fully and believe that under
 his guidance the peace-loving cabinet will
 negotiate a conclusion to the Civil War.

 No More Surrenders
 To The Editor:
 We remember that after our victory
 over Japan, General Ho Ying-Chin was
 sent to represent China at the surrender
 for which he received considerable pres-
 tige from the people and received at-
 tention from the world.
 Now when cries of "Prepare for war
 if you want peace" are bandied about,
 Qeneral Ho has formed a new cabinet.
 It is hard to tell what General Ho
 will do but it does not seem likely that
 he will be receiving any more surrenders.

 Foreign Postage
 To The Editor:
 With reference to the letter from Mr.
 Loo Shih-cheng published in  the March
 26 issue of your esteemed Review under
 the caption "Foreign Postage," I have to
 inform you that the tariff of Interna-
 tional Postage is based upon the rates
 stipulated in the Universal Postal Con-
 vention, and the foreign airmail postage
 is fixed according to the transit charges
 paid to the Aviation companies by the
 Post Office.  As both are calculated on
 a foreign currency  basis, the  postage
 rates on foreign, mail are collected in
 Gold  Yuan    converted according to the
 rates of the Foreign Exchange Clearance
 Certificates, published in the daily news-
 papers.  Owing to the frequent fluctua-
 tions of such rates, the Post Office is
 compelled to adjust its tariff of Inter-
 national postage in order to avoid undue
 losses sustained by it.
 I shall appreciate it if you will kind-
 ly publish this letter in your esteemed
 journal for the information of Mr. Loo
 Shih-cheng  as  well  as  the  public  in
 general.

 Students Sympathize
 To The Editor:
 It was a sad surprise to read about
 the   incident  involving   the   injured
 students in Nanking.  According to the
 Ta Kung Pao, the fight started when
 the demonstrating  students staged the
 famous "Yangko" dance in the streets,

 casualties were reported among the sol-
 diers,  a number of students  were in-
 jured, and at least one killed.
 What  kind  of democracy is     this
 that the Government talks about?  By
 what law was the demonstration  for-
 bidden?                       Yes, the martial law signed by
 the Government does not permit demon-
 strations, but is this law right?                           In-
 cidents like the above have the sympathy
 of the entire student body of China.

 To The Editor:
 The  Nanking student  incident shows
 that realization of the word democracy
 is  very  different from just  saying  it.
 On   the   surface,  acting President   Li
 Tsung-jen     makes efforts        to  stop the
 Civil War, but the Government. is still
 killing  peace loving  students  with  its
 secret   fifth  column.  It is high time
 that the Government revealed that it is
 using the peace talks as a mask unless
 it accepts Mao Tze-tung's eight terms.

 fully and sincerely  adhered to  by the
 two parties concerned.  Such agreement
 must depend  upon the mutual efforts
 directed by the parties towards the con-
 clusion  of a peaceful arrangement for
 that purpose.
 Many years of war have drained the
 life of the nation.  We want the KMT
 and the CP to negotiate and explore all
 means to bring peace to China.    The
 great task of keeping the country in a
 state of peace and order and leading the
 country towards modernization is on the
 shoulders of both parties.
 Both the  Government and the     Com-

 To The Editor:
 The following is my translation of an
 article carried in the Hunan Daily News
 of March 17th, entitled, "Why Chen Yi
 was Detained":
 "Though the  reasons for Chen  Yi's
 being dismissed from his post as Gov-
 ernor of Chekiang Province are many,
 the main one is that he has, lost the
 confidence of President Chiang Kai-shek.
 Ever since last winter when Tsinan fell
 into the hands of the Communists and
 an investigation  was made as to why
 it fell, Chen has been in Chiang's bad
 graces.   After   General  Wang  Yao-wu
 was taken prisoner, some of the legisla- -
 tors in Nanking.... went so far as to
 demand that President Chiang step down,
 as the fault was his.  Chefs Yi was call-
 ed to Nanking and questioned, and among
 sued an order to rele tse all political pri_
 -soners, with a view to showing his sin-
 cerity  toward  peace,  Again  Chen  Yi
 took the order, serioi:sly, and bailed' out
 five arrested student., of Chekiang Uni-
 versity.    When Chen Yi went to Chikow
 to see President Ch ang, Chiang asked,
 'Do you know someth ng of the arrogance
 of the Che Ta boy:. ' ' and Chen replied,
 'Yes, I know of it.'  Why didn't you do
 something about it,   hen?' Chiang ques-
 tioned.  'The more you meddle in their
 affairs, I am afraid, the more they will
 become troublesome,' Chen said. 'If you
 don't  meddle,  do  you  think they will
 cease to  make trouble?' asked  Chiang.
 'At least, I have succeeded in avoiding
 serious troubles  during my  tenure of
 office so far,' Chen Yi replied,
 "As the conversation went on, Pres-
 ident                                                                                                                      Chiang's    temper  grew  shorter,
 until at last he could no longer control
 himself.  Ile  struck his hand  on  the
 table, roaring, `Obey me, and you shall
 keep your post;    or else, pack up and
 get away with you.'
 "When  Chen  Yi told    his friends of
 this unhappy scene afterwards, he was
 all  grumbles.  'It is better for me to
 get away now,' he said. 'If I try to hang
 on any longer, maybe there will be no
 chance in the future for me to get away
 at all.'
 "Another thing worth mentioning here
 is  the  disagreement  between  Chen  Yi
 and therefore came into direct conflict
 with Mayor Jen.  When -Chen heard of
 this, he called King to him, scolded him
 severely, and deprived him of - the title
 of Chairman of the Board of Directors
 of the Hangchow Chamber of Commerce.
 Having been insulted thus, King went;
 to his boss, a certain big shot, to com-
 plain.  The                                                                                                                      big  shot,  greatly  offended
 with Chen  for  having  ill-treated  his
 henchman,  went    immediately   to  see
 President Chiang. By speaking evil of
 Chen in every way he could, he succeed-

 ed in rousing Chiang's rage to such an
 extent that the president decided to dis-
 miss  Chen  Yi              at  once,  without  even
 bothering to consult with his most trust-
 ed subordinates.          So Chen was unaware
 of his having been dismissed until Chow
 Yen's appointment as the new governors.
 of Chekiang was made public.
 "After Chen had been dismissed, Pres-
 ident  Chiang  still  felt  uneasy.   His
 suspicion pained him so much that at
 last he ordered Chen Yi to be detained.
 According to some  Shanghai papers,
 Chen Yi was sent to Chuchow, his place
 of detainment, by a certain general.  He.
 is now leading a secluded life there."

 Will Share Review
 To The Editor:
 Ever  since  the  unfreezing of  the
 August 19 price levels, commodity prices
 have been soaring day by day so furious-
 ly that they are beyond our reach and
 the result is that the living standard of
 the common people has descended to a
 record  low.  Both  school-teachers  and
 students, with  their salaries  and sub-
 sidies lagging far behind, are unable to
 find a way to keep body and soul to-
 gether, let alone subscribe to magazines
 and newspapers.
 In, spite of being a subscriber to your
 magazine for only three months, I find
 in your readers' columns many requests
 for free ?ubscriptions. ,  These seem to
 be usually either from underpaid school-
 teachers or poverty-stricken students for
 whom  these  days  even    textbooks  are
 luxuries.  However,   these   people  are
 fond of the straight views published in
 your magazine, and their ardent desire
 for the truth prompts their appeals for
 your help.
 I am extremely sympathetic with these
 people and with a view to helping them
 to some extent, I have decided to share
 my Review.  Would you, dear editor, in-
 troduce me to one of these friends?  If
 possible, I will send him my copy every
 week as soon as I have finished it and
 he may return it to one after' he has
 read it.

 Canton Strike
 To The Editor:
 One hundred seventy-six professors at
 National  Sun  Yat-sen  University went
 on  strike on  March 25 to demand an
 improvement in  their living conditions.
 This is the first time that any professors
 in Canton have struck singe VJ Day.  In
 this respect, I believe Canton's professors
 have been more patient than  those in
 Peiping and  Shanghai, who have more
 than once. used the strike weapon to pro-
 test  against irregularities.    But things
 have reached such a pass that even the
 Canton professors could endure their suf-
 ferings no longer.
 In an open letter to the public, these
 professors disclosed  that they  had re-
 peatedly appealed to the various authori-
 ties  concerned.  Under  present  infla-
 tionary conditions, their monthly salary,
 the equivalent of HK$30, is hardly suf-
 ficient to support one person, let alone
 an entire family.
 2,000  cattics  of  ri?e to be  contributed
 to the professors, and they have been
 gathering firewood, carrying water and
 doing other odd jogs to help the teach-
 ers..                                                                         Such   acts  o'  genuine    sympathy
 present a sharp coltrast to the Govern-
 ment's apathy.

 Why No Reporters?
 To The Editor:
 According to the newspapers, the Com-
 munists have refused to let either Chi-
 nese or foreign reporters be present at
 the peace talks in Peiping.
 My opinion is that the main reason
 for this must be that the Communists
 don't  want  to  have  the  conditions in
 Peiping made knot.,n to persons on the
 outside.  In that else, I can't but doubt
 the    administration, of   the   so-called
 liberated areas.  t  Peiping is as good
 as the Communist, say, why don't they
 welcome reporters there?

 News From Peiping
 To The Editor:
 Recently, my sister, who is in Peiping,
 wrote me saying, "Peiping has fallen into
 the hands of the Communists. '  Many
 beautiful  buildings,_ are  empty. The
 former  officials  of  Peiping  have made
 their way to Hongkong and Canton, a
 few even going as far as America. The
 people left in Peiping, except for a few,
 are as poor as church mice.     Of course,
 there is;no need for them to escape and
 most of them have shown no sign that
 they have any intention of leaving Pei-
 ping :,
 My sister reported further that prices
 are no longer skyrocketing, and, indeed,
 that prices have  been forced  down on
 various commodities by the Communists.
 All youth of school age are able to re-
 ceive a free education and daily neces-
 sities are provided for them.  Such news
 surprises me very much.  I have never
 heard of such a thing in China since I
 was born.  I would rather study in Pei-
 ping than in Szechuen, where we have
 to pay thbusands of'GY to stay in school.

 . Backward Areas
 AS we have mentioned in these columns before,
 the problem of the "backward areas" has been
 coming up for more attention recently in Western
 capitals. In Paris, for example, sudden concern
 is felt for the pitiable economic state of Indo-
 China and other French colonial possessions.
 London, likewise, is worried about the lack of
 development in the African territories controlled
 by Great Britain.
 All of this concern would be more touching
 were it not for the fact that it is such a, recent
 development.  In days past, when all one had to
 worry about were the recurring economic depres-
 sions and occasional wars between the various
 colonial powers, little attention was paid to
 development of "backward" areas.  Such regions
 were usually prevented from attaining any worth
 while degree of industrial or other economic
 development so that they would fit easily into the
 old pattern of colonial exploitation for the benefit
 of the home economy.
 One does not have to be a devotee of Marxism
 to understand the role the subject colonies played
 in the development of trade and industry among
 the leading capitalist countries of Europe. Capital-
 ism, as we know it today, got its beginnings in
 the industrial revolution.  After industrialization
 had reached a certain degree, the factory owners
 of Europe found that they must develop markets
 abroad in which they could sell finished products
 if they wanted their business to expand and
 prosper.  In brief, they-came up against the pro-
 blem of an oversupply for the home market be-
 cause of the low purchasing power of the people.
 Unless new markets abroad were found, a depres-
 sion at home resulted.
 Realization of this simple economic fact led
 to the great rush for colonies.  After all available
 areas had been grabbed by the competing powers,
 it was inevitable that they would fight among
 themselves in an effort to secure some of the other
 nations' colonial holdings.  These were the rea-
 sons behind the scramble for colonies, not, as was
 Since colonies were to serve the function of
 export market for finished products and source
 of supply for industrial raw materials or food, it
 was obvious that the Western' powers were not
 interested in developing these backward areas.
 The American Revolution started largely because
 the colonialists knew full well that they were
 getting a raw deal from their masters in Eng-
 land.  It was common practice for colonial pow-
 ers to pass laws  forbidding  the  erection  of
 factories in colonies.  Actually, the ruling na-
 tions were not only unconcerned about the lack
 of development in colonial areas, but did every-
 thing within their power to prevent any such
 development.
 When the limits of the market had  been
 reached in colonial areas, the old problem of over-
 supply again became  apparent and                                                                    depressions
 continued.  In recent years, a new development
 in the relationship between colonies and the ruling
 powers took place.  Many European businessmen
 found that if they moved part of their industrial
 establishment to a colonial area, they could earn
 a profit even during depression years because of
 the small operation costs.  In. this way,. China, a
 semi-colonial country, became the field for con-
 siderable foreign investment.  Thus Shanghai,
 which lacks many of the requirements for a large
 textile industry, became a major textile center
 anyway.  If English mills, especially during de-
 pression years when the market experienced a
 great shrinkage, could not sell their products in
 India or China because the materials cost  too
 much, it still was possible for mills owned by
 Englishmen-but established in Shanghai where
 labor was practically free-to operate at a profit.
 Thus many English mill owners found them-
 selves on the horns of a dilemma.  They wanted
 the manufacturing process conducted in England
 so that the latter country could reap the reward
 for the labor, but at the same time they found
 that frequently they could do better financially
 if they established their mills in the backward
 areas.
 The immediate result of the establishment
 of foreign-owned factories in backward areas was
 to open the eyes of the wealthy natives who de-
 sired to follow the lead of the westerners.  In
 China, there developed a small industrial class
 of Chinese who opened factories to compete with
 English, American, German, and Japanese out-
 fits.  The foreign powers attempted to throttle
 this competition by placing obstacles in the way
 of the native industrialists.  This was accom-
 plished largely via the unequal treaties which
 exempted foreign business in China from Chin-
 ese control.  Chinese industrialists, meanwhile,
 always at the mercy of local gangsterism and
 passing warlords, found it extremely difficult to
 compete.  In the colonies, the foreign powers
 usually nipped native competition in the bud by
 simply forbidding the establishment of extensive
 industrial works by natives.

 such movements have a strong nationalistic flavor,
 but some are also developing along class lines.
 In semi-colonial, semi-feudalistic China a Com-
 munist rebellion has succeeded to the extent of
 forcing a corruption-ridden and wholly inefficient
 nationalist regime to sue for peace.  In Indo-
 China a revolutionary coalition front composed
 of nationalists and communists has about kicked
 the French overlords out of the country.  In
 Indonesia, a pure nationalist movement-having
 split with and suppressed its communist sup-
 porters-is carrying on the struggle.  In Malaya,
 a Communist-flavored revolt is in full swing,
 while in Burma, which, like China, might be
 called semi-colonial, the nationalists and com-
 munists, plus an autonomous-minded minority
 group, are engaged in a three ring _ circus.
 Perhaps this new development is more easily
 understood in China.  Here, the native group
 which originally opposed the foreign powers who
 sold manufactured goods and bought raw mate-
 rials is now attempting to enlist the support of
 these very same foreigners in the internal class
 struggle.  So long as the Chinese Communists
 were a force scarcely to be reckoned with, the
 native nationalists ?ought the foreign imperi-
 alists.  Attacks upon the .,unequal treaties were
 constant.  However, now that the Communists
 have succeeded in rallying the oppressed peas-
 antry and are on the point of driving out the
 nationalists or-at least getting them under con-
 trol, the latter are turning to their old enemies
 and requesting support.
 As things have turned out, it is not the
 principal colonial powers whose aid is being
 sought, but that of the United States.  This is
 merely  because the  leading colonial powers,
 Britain, France,  and  Germany,  have fought
 among themselves so extensively that they are
 no longer in a position to give aid. The United
 States, although not a colonial power in the
 strict sense of the word, does operate pretty
 much upon the same economic principles as the
 European colonial powers and therefore reacts
 similarly when it sees a market in process of
 being eliminated or controlled by its own in-
 habitants to such an extent that "free" or
 privileged trade is no longer possible.
 WITH this background on relations between
 the "'developed" and "undeveloped" coun-
 tries -of the world, it is particularly interesting
 to read the press agency stories from London,
 Paris, Washington, and other capitals of the
 "developed" world telling of the great concern
 that is felt for the inhabitants of the backward
 areas.
 Aside from a plaintive wail or two from
 Paris where the ruling group would like to have
 Indo-China considered a backward area in need
 of development, providing, of course, that the
 money comes from America or some place other
 than France, the concensus seems to be that
 Africa is the main undeveloped area in need of
 economic aid.  Perhaps the reason is that the
 "dark" contineptpp is co  ider dl the 21~~ t~0   1
 rove    or a ease
 vanced politically and therefore may be exploit-
 able for a while longer than other colonial areas
 where the natives, although living in undevelop-
 ed physical surroundings, have become entirely
 too well developed politically.
 All this talk of development, it seems, stems
 from the late President Roosevelt who had an
 ambitious and praiseworthy  scheme for im-
 proving the economic status of. all backward
 areas and for moving populations around so as
 to relieve pressure on some areas and provide
 sufficient manpower for development of sparsely
 populated areas.  However, it now seems that
 Roosevelt's plan is to be dusted off so that it
 can complement the Truman Doctine, the Mar-
 shall Plan, and the Atlantic Pact.  The present
 idea is to use American money, materials, and
 know-how in an effort to expedite the exploita-
 tion of Africa in the interests of the European
 colonial powers with whom the US wishes to
 align herself for the next war.
 If left to her own devices, the. US might
 rush in without due consideration and upset the
 apple cart.  A,  least that seems to be the
 opinion in London.  The British, who are no-
 body's fools, have learned a lesson in Asia
 where a rich empire is slowly slipping out of
 their grasp. While they want Africa developed
 so that a substitute source of revenue may be
 secured, they do not wish to do anything which
 might cause the Africans to begin thinking
 along the. same lines as their Asiatic counter-
 parts.
 A recent Associated Press dispatch from
 London sheds interesting light on this point:
 "A political planner in the colonial office
 believes Britain probably will have to let go its
 East African colonies within 25 or 30 years, even
 in the best circumstances.  The same thing, he
 believes, will happen even sooner on the West
 African Gold Coast, where political riots have
 already taken place.  This same attitude is re-
 flected in the colonial section of Britain's new
 four-year plan' for recovery submitted to the
 organization for European economic cooperation.
 "If investment is `pushed too far or too
 fast,' the plan statement said, `it would give rise
 to conditions that have the gravest consequences
 to social welfare and stability.'  In short, there
 are agitators who could profit from inciting
 Africans with talk of `exploitation by capitalist
 imperialists.'  If development schemes are car-
 ried out in a way to make this seem partly logical
 to the workmen, riots and rebellion are likely
 to. wreck the best laid plans."
 There it is in a nutshell.  Faced with the
 combined threat of a loss of revenue from straight
 exploitation of Asiatic colonies and the closure,
 of normal markets by an embittered native po-
 pulace, the European powers, whose whole way
 of life at home is built upon the colonial system,
 are both anxious and scared to develop new
 markets in Africa.  With the lesson learned in
 Asia behind them they are conscious that eco-
 nomic development inevitably leads to loss of

 thus are fearful lest such development result in
 an early loss of these last colonies in Africa.
 The colonial powers, refusing to see the
 handwriting upon the wall 'which tells them in
 unmistakable terms that the days of colonialism
 are over, are rapidly becoming enmeshed in more
 and more economic contradictions.  Weakened by
 wars among themselves and loss of revenue from.
 Asiatic colonies, they are too poor to undertake
 development of the world's last available colonial
 region over which they exercise physical control.
 They have -turned to America for aid, offering
 to split the profits if Uncle Sam will supply the
 necessary tools for exploitation.  It will be inter-
 esting to see if the United States is really foolish
 enough to finance this last hopeless adventure
 of governments whose thinking has not changed
 for the past two centuries.

 Seventy-year-old Yang Ju  Sam,  first Korean  Methodist
 bishop, was arrested last night by a special police force for
 allegedly collaborating with the Japanese ........      Arrest of
 Yang  (a YMCA director in Seoul)  was interpreted here as
 indication of a behind the scenes political tug-of-war being
 waged between President Rhee and          a  group  of  national
 assembly  delegates  who  are in control of      a special  police
 force.... The special police force, informed observers here
 believe, is a political tool to throttle opposition .......... -
 United Press dispatch from Seoul, Korea, on March 29.
 Yang can at least take comfort in the fact that he is
 living in Southern Korea, a democracy endorsed by the United
 States, and not in Northern Korea, a Moscow-dominated con-
 centration camp where the people's freedoms are ruthlessly
 suppressed.
 Reds Drive For Production
 T HE Chinese Communists, according to their
 radio broadcasts, : are currently engaged in
 an all-out drive to increase production in all lines.
 A propaganda campaigns designed to impress upon
 individual workers and peasants the great need
 for more materials has been launched.  It is ex-
 plained that the country needs'more food, more
 consumer goods, more- capital products and that
 these things can be secured only through increased
 effort.  Every opportunity is used to impress
 upon the individuals that since they are now
 working for themselves, they should work harder.
 Aside from appeal's to patriotism, many con-
 crete measures designed to increase production
 have been adopted.  A! labor emulation campaign
 has been inaugurated.  Workers"are told of the
 fine work done in such and such a factory or
 rural district and asked to enter into competition
 in an effort to set a new production mark.  Con-
 tests between individual workers in the same or-
 ganization are mapped out, with prizes for the
 winners. In addition to these devices, a very,basic
 inducement has been offered-higher pay. Work-
 ers are told that their income will go up cor.?-.
 1          1
 d
 h
 tools.  Numerous new farm and factory imple-
 ments, it is said, have already been developed.
 It, is, of course, far too early to be able to
 judge the success of this program or even to
 make an estimate of how much production can
 be increased or what such an increase would mean
 to the national economy.  However, it is possible
 to see the basic common sense behind the whole
 campaign.  China is a very poor and undeveloped
 country and if she is to make any great steps
 toward increasing her wealth and thereby raising
 the overall standard of living, it must come from
 the hard work of the Chinese people.
 It is true that the mere ending of the Civil
 War will result in vast improvement.  The de-
 mobilization of soldiers and their return to pro-
 ductive work, the elimination of the "exploiter
 class," especially from rural areas, inauguration
 of efficient and honest government, development
 of a sound system of taxation, and so on will
 result in a vast improvement:
 How - great  these  advances  will  be  it
 is  difficult to  tell  with any exactitude, but
 it  is  possible  to    get an  estimate  of the
 extent to which China's economy has slipped
 in recent years. According to Dr. On Pao-sail,
 of the Academia Sinica, China's national income
 has been falling year by year since 1936.  His
 estimate puts China's national income in 1946
 at 25 percent below the 1936 figure.  This is a
 sizeable drop, especially when one considers that
 the national' income was rising steadily in the
 years immediately preceding the outbreak of the
 Sino-Japanese War.  Presumably, China has not
 only sustained an actual 25 percent drop in income
 (luring the decade 1936-46, but has lost even
 more if one were to presume that during this
 period income might have been increasing yearly
 had it not been for the war with Japan and the
 Civil War which followed.
 Once  the  return  to  "normalcy"  takes
 place  following - the end of  fighting, the
 percentage-wise increase of national income will'
 be a slow affair considering that China must
 start very nearly from scratch.  However, if the
 Communists are able to keep up the spirit of the
 people, through measures such as those men-
 tioned in the foregoing, there is no reason why
 the country cannot develop an ever-expanding in-
 come which, barring future setbacks such as
 wars or other national calamities, can theoreti-
 cally reach a stage where everyone's legitimate
 wants and needs can be met.
 If the Communists are able to carry out
 such a program, they will have succeeded in doing
 something which no other Chinese government
 has been able to accomplish, or, for that matter,
 even to contemplate.

 Such arbitrary action,. BOTRA pointed out,
 is in direct contravention of the agreement sign-
 ed between the Chinese Government and the.
 United Nations which specified that no relief and
 rehabilitation supplies granted China, by UNRRA
 were to be used for military purposes.  According
 to the BOTRA protest, Nationalist troops in re-
 cent weeks have been helping themselves to the
 organization's stockpiles.  Some one and a half
 million board feet of lumber have been confiscated.
 An additional 450,000 cubic feet of sand and
 797,300 cubic feet of stone have been carted off
 by local troops.  Besides constituting a violation
 of the Chinese Government's treaty obligations,
 the less is, BOTRA alleges, crippling; some of its
 programs.  The lumber, for example, had already
 been allotted to the Fisheries Rehabilitation Ad-
 ministration for junk building.
 It is, of course, always discouraging to see
 materials designed for productive purposes swal-
 lowed and digested-apparently without any ob-
 servable benefits  whatsoever--by the Govern-
 ment's roving hordes of soldiery.  However, in
 this specific case there is a certain ironical touch.
 For three years the Chinese people have been
 waiting for BOTRA to start disgorging some
 materials.   Now, it seems, these materials  are
 fii ally being put to some use, even though it
 may be non-productive.  Perhaps we are being
 a little unfair to BOTRA since its dismal record
 has been in part the result of circumstances be-
 yond its control. The whole Fisheries Rehabilita-
 tion Administration fiasco, we understand, is
 almost entirely attributable to the selfish inter-
 ests of the local fish market and fish guild, which
 have a powerful local protector whose authority
 apparently cannot be  successfully  challenged.
 Shanghailanders have been forced to go without
 fish or buy them at outrageous prices because the
 market and guild prefer to operate in an economy
 of scarcity.
 A combination of factors consisting of op-
 position from various vested interest groups, such
 as the fish guild in Shanghai, corrupt  rural
 magistrates who demanded their "squeeze" from
 rural improvement programs, landlords who re-
 sented any imported ideas or materials which
 might tend to upset the. old feudal relationship
 between master and servant, and an astounding
 inability to function efficiently as an organization
 have made BOTRA much more of a failure than
 P. success.
 Now that it is reported that Chinese troops
 are appropriating materials, many of which have
 lain in the weather for the past three years be-
 cause of BOTRA's inability to put them to use,
 the final curtain may be rung down on BOTRA,
 as   it  was  on  UNRRA,  which, wound  up
 its affairs and ceased existence just recently in
 New York.  In any event, it is hardly likely that
 the Communists or the new coalition regime will
 be willing to support any of the bureaucratic left-
 overs, although it is likely that going concerns

 Any Hope For Szechuen?
 There is at least one measure of comfort for us as we
 look out upon the unfolding of -the perennial flower of hope.
 There has been so little to justify hope, and the flower has
 been so often rudely blighted, that even if we are doomed
 again  to  disappointment,  no  one  will  lose  very  much  sleep
 as a result of the nerve strain we have endured during the
 past five years with the anxiety we felt during the Great
 Revolution, at which time there was no  fighting compared
 with what  we  now     expect.   We  cannot but  smile  at     the
 philosophic manner in which we now hear of "wars and rumors
 of war."
 So we may as well play at the game of hope instead of
 indulging  in  an  evening's  "pleasure"  over  majongg      which
 pastime might meet with the wrath of the Chief of Police who
 still needs funds. Whenever we order a consignment of goods
 from Shanghai, or even Chungking, it is as good as a game
 of chance, for the exhilaration in watching the slow progress
 of the native junks as they crawl slowly by the "perils" by
 water--perils by robbers--perils by the countrymen cannot be
 beaten by a good horse race.
 Everyone plays. it.   Some put all  their stake  on the
 black.  The Gloomy Dean has nothing on them.  If a soldier
 walks across the street in broad daylight there is going to
 be a bombardment of the city within an hour!  If the news
 papers mention that one of the "enemy" is making overtures
 of peace it only means that the said "enemy" is about to
 attack,  Chungking has been taken away from Liu Tsen Hou
 at least three times since the tide there turned in favor of
 the North., But still he seems to remain there. No one blames
 them-the outlook for so many years has been so gloomy that
 their glasses are all smoked.

 Dead. End. In Aia For The West
 And ew Roth
 THE  Western  Powers  are  like a
 group of "Dead End Kids"       in
 Asia. Their policies have brought
 them to a dead end.  They' scarcely
 seem to realize the impasse  exists,
 much less know any exit therefrom.
 The West  knows it has      suffered
 serious defeats. Recent    Communist
 victories have so tipped the balance
 in Asia that they may well be among
 the leading reasons for the   recent
 Soviet peace offensive.          The  Com-
 munist military and political victories
 in China make  it virtually  certain
 that all 450,000,000 Chinese will be
 under a Communist-led     Government
 before the end of this year.  In the
 elections in American-run Japan the
 Communists have boosted the num-
 ber of their seats in Parliament from
 four to 36.  The American-supported
 South  Korean and Philippine gov-
 ernments are  uneasy   as   sporadic
 Communist uprisings  break out in
 various areas.  In Viet Nam a Com-
 munist-led    nationalist .  coalition
 harasses the few beachheads still re-
 tained by the French. In Burma and
 Malaya the governments find it dif-
 ficult to                     extirpate  insurgent Com-
 munist bands which began their up-
 risings last spring.                      In Indonesia the
 Dutch  attack  has  precipitated a
 guerilla movement which seems like-
 ly to come increasingly under Com-
 munist influence.  All of these Com-
 munist movements, of course,  have
 taken  considerable encouragement
 from developments in China.
 While the  Western  powers are
 conscious of their  setbacks, there
 does not seem to be any general
 realization that they are, to a very
 considerable degree, in a blind alley.
 Thus, many American military and
 political  strategists feel  that" they
 can make up for American setbacks
 in China by allowing the conserva-
 tive business elements  in Japan to
 achieve    enough of a  comeback to
 make Japan an effective ally against
 the Communist-dominated  mainland.
 By  leaning  toward the  Japanese
 businessmen, however, the American
 authorities have helped push Japan-
 ese labor  toward the                       Communists.
 In addition this  policy  has aroused
 the active fears of those countries
 formerly under the Japanese heel. In
 China,   for   example,   reports  of
 America's     rebuilding  Japan  have
 been one of the most compelling fac-
 tors pushing the                     intellectuals  'and
 even  some  industrialists-both    of
 them  strongly     anti-Japanese-into
 the arms of the Communists.
 Britain in Malaya 'is also threshing'
 around in a dead end.  Although up-
 wards of 40,000 police  and  troops
 are harassing less  than  5,000 pre-
 dominantly-Chinese                                     Communist in-
 surgents, the rate at which the Com-
 munists are being rooted out is very
 low.  In  order  to cut   down the
 amount of support these guerillas are
 porting some of them.  This arouses
 the  antagonism  of    much of  the
 Chinese commur=ty which comprises
 over two-fifths o-' Malay's population.
 Furthermore, sirce virtually only the
 Malays volunteer in any numbers for
 the police and ;nilitary forces sup-
 pressing the the ?at to Britain's posi-
 tion, the British government is hard
 put to  resist   lemands  by    Malay
 leaders for spe vial  privileges  for
 -them.  These  p ivileges are certain
 to be resented b ; the Chinese.  Bri-
 tain feels comps fled to act energeti-
 cally in Malaya because its exports
 of rubber and tin produce over one
 quarter of  Britain's  dollar credits.
 But in fighting 0 preserve this "dol-
 lar  arsenal",  i npoverished  Britain
 has been compelled to make sapping
 police and military expenditures.
 By its  Decer..iber    attack on the
 Indonesian Republic, Holland plunged
 headlong along ?- route in which com-
 plete victory seems                                                                barred by  the
 wall of Indonesian  resentment    and
 resistance and tie  only  alternative
 now is complete withdrawal.     Until
 December there always existed the
 possibility  of     settlement  which
 would enable  Holland to retain its
 privileged econoi-iie position for prob-
 ably at least a generation. Holland
 is a trading na ion which has kept
 its comparativel, high living stand-
 ards by serving as an entrepot for
 Germany and by exporting Indonesian
 products to the United  States and
 using the proceeds to finance its own
 imports as well as goods for sale to
 Indonesia.  Although the Indonesians
 were not willing ?:o permit Holland to
 retain its prewa? monopoly position,
 they were willing to allow it a pri-
 vileged  position                                                               in  exchange  for
 political  independence  which they
 reckoned as more important.    Many
 Indonesian nationalists  have feared
 that complete economic independence
 would put Indonesia under the econo-
 mic control of it ~ Chinese minority.
 ALTHOUGH tie Dutch have cap-
 tured a considerable portion of
 the leading town: in the area formerly
 under the Indonesian Republic since
 they launched thAr current offensive,
 they have met with more sabotage
 and guerilla resistance than they anti-
 cipated.  Further more, the unprovok-
 ed Dutch attack ias strengthened na-
 tionalist feeling, already very strong
 among the  youta and the  educated.
 To one who has  spent any time in
 Indonesia nothin;  has been more un-
 realistic than th '  professed                                                                Dutch
 elation when it was clear that three
 Indonesian prir?ces, Rajah     Anak
 Agung, Tengu  vlansur and    Sultan
 Abdul Hamid II would go along with
 the Dutch, desp'Le the attack.  The
 latter two are aristocrats who have
 always been in t:re Dutch pocket be-
 cause  they feel  their only hope of
 the Indonesian nationalist hares as
 well as the Dutch imperialist hounds
 but who,  in the last  analysis, has
 decided that as a Rajah his privileges
 are threatened by a   republican  re-
 gime which proved  to be                                                                                                         strongly
 anti-feudal in his native Bali.   But
 such allies. can do little if any good;
 there are comparatively few aristo-
 crats and many nationalists in Indo-
 nesia.  Dutch  military                                                                                                        expenditures
 last year amounted to US$500,000,-
 000-almost twice what Holland re-
 ceived in ECA aid.  This year they
 seem likely to be higher without sue=
 cessfuIly  "pacifying"  Indonesia,  a
 necessary prerequisite to its success-
 ful exploitation.
 The Dutch have succeeded not only
 in antagonizing Indonesia nationalists
 and in aligning other Asian nation-
 alists against them, but also in com-
 plicating the already   difficult                                                                                                      pro-
 blems of other Western nations. The
 Indonesian  Republican  government
 depended on the US to protect them
 against the Dutch, and one of the
 reasons the Sukarno-Hatta  govern-
 ment suppressed                                                                                                     its own  insurgent
 Communist opposition so enthusiasti-
 cally last September was to prove to
 the   Americans that          they were
 sincerely anti-Cqmmunist. When the
 Dutch attacked  and the  Americans
 limited themselves to denouncing the
 Dutch and   stopping  ECA  aid  to
 Dutch-held  Indonesia but  not  to
 Holland,  many  fence-sitting Indo-
 nesian and other Asian nationalists
 came to the conclusion that the US.
 is more interested in anti-Communist
 imperialists than in anti-Communist
 nationalists.
 Britain  has  been  similarly  em-
 barrassed by the Dutch attack.                                                                                                            Al-
 though the British                                                                                                          had previously
 shifted from a fairly neutral position
 to one leaning toward its Western
 Union colleague, the  Dutch   attack
 complicated  British  relations with
 India and other former British pos-
 sessions. The British, for example,
 had been working hard to cement re-
 lations  with                                                                                                        India,  in  the   hope
 of keeping it within the Common-
 wealth.  But India has taken the
 lead  in aid  for  Indonesia,  while
 Britain has discreetly supported the
 Dutch. In short, the Dutch attack
 in Indonesia  has  almost done    as
 much to weaken Western influence in
 South Asia  as the  Communist vic-
 tories in China have accomplished in
 East Asia.
 In the meantime, the French have
 been rattling around in their own
 narrow  cul-de-sac  in  Viet   Nam.
 Despite an army of  over    120,000
 men and an annual expenditure of",
 about US$400,000,000, they are  too

 The China Weekly Review, April 16, 1949
 A West China' Notebook
 Lynn Chase and Amos Landman
 BEYOND the coastal belt of China
 lies a vast country-gaunt, tree-
 less  mountains             in  Kansu,         camel
 caravans in Chinghai,  terraced rice
 paddies , in   Szechuen,   primitive
 tribesmen in Yunnan.
 West China, including the Central
 Asian province of Sinkiang, is popu-
 lated by nearly 100,000,000                  Chinese,
 Moslems, Tibetans, Mongols, Tartars,
 and others.  It is a varied hinter-
 land  lying                  between  Tibet,  Soviet
 Siberia,   Red   China,  Nationalist
 China, Indo-China, and Burma.
 Technically, this tremendous tract
 is under the hegemony of    Nanking.
 But as a practical matter, much of
 it is autonomous or semi-autonomous.
 Thus, a big slice of China will not
 be immediately affected by the Com-
 munist-Nationalist peace negotiations
 now proceeding in Peiping, whatever
 their result.
 Northwest Metropolis
 The metropolis of Northwest China
 is a beige-colored city, Lanchow, in
 Kansu province.  Its  buildings are
 made of the baked earth on which
 the city stands, and are covered with
 a layer of dust of this same earth.
 The city's sidewalks, like those of
 many Chinese cities, are a hub of
 commerce.  Peddlers   clutter  them
 with   dried  raisins and apricots,
 garish Sinkiang  rugs,    Turkestan
 caps, cotton piece-goods from Shang-
 hai, and scores of other wares.
 Mule-drawh   droshkies and    work-
 carts-some equipped with pneumatic
 tires which are scarcer than gold in
 this area-raise clouds of      dust  no
 matter how slowly they move.
 Just outside the  city along    the
 Yellow River,   giant wooden  water
 wheels stand motionless, waiting for
 the spring rise which will start them
 turning and irrigating,  the fields.
 And in villages along the Yellow
 River are children so poor that they
 are  naked from  the waist    down,
 despite the paralyzing cold.
 Not far away, in East Kansu and
 Shensi, are the battle lines of the
 Communists  and   Nationalists.  If
 the Reds win, then what?
 Wu Hua-fu, Kansu Highway Com-
 missioner, and Gustav Soderbom, a
 Swedish businessman who has spent
 most of his life in China, are con-
 vinced that  the  Communists  can
 never take and hold the Northwest.
 The Chinese, they say, are individual-
 ists  and will never submit to the
 Communist organization of society.
 Then you talk to Catholic and
 Protestant missionaries, to -a Turki
 rug merchant and an American busi-
 nessman, to the Chinese themselves.
 They ask that their names be with-
 held,'then they speak frankly:
 The Chinese are fed up with war;

 Many peasants would actually wel-
 come the Reds, the, businessmen and
 missionaries agrer.
 Only the  Moslems,  whose    anti-
 Communism has  a religious                                                                 basis,
 will fight.  They r.re a minority, but
 they hold direct :ailitary control of
 Chinghai and Ninghsia provinces, and
 indirect control of much of Kansu.
 The  Moslem   H ho  dominates the
 Northwest is  Gei eral Ma  Pu-fang
 of Chinghai.  We  pent a day jounc-
 ing over rutted rotds to call on him
 in  his exotic ca dtal,  Sining, 150
 miles west of Lar dhow.
 The moment yoi    cross into Ching-
 hai, an arid, mou, tain-studded tract
 bigger than Texas you see evidence
 of impressive pub is works. Every-
 where young trees have been plant-
 ed-60,000,000 in tie last five years,
 we learned  later.  Roads have been
 improved,  irrigati;.n  projects built,
 wool-processing plt.nts   set  up, and
 clinics opened.  El, en   free schools
 have been   establi:hed-a rarity in
 China today.
 By  discreet     iu uiry,    the other
 side of the coin  s revealed.   Ma
 Pu-fang is the al,; elute ruler of the
 province.  He  hold,  a  monopoly in
 most important en; rprises, including
 the wool indu:;try, we were told by
 merchants and others.    Taxes are
 said to be exorbitant.   One source
 reports that Ma drafted - without
 pay-some 40,0D0 peasant men and
 women to repair anme bridges which
 were washed out b"7 a flood.
 Interview With Ma
 Thin-whiskered, imposing Ma  Pu-
 fang, whose bearin:?, is such that he
 gives the impressio i of being four or
 five inches taller than he actually is,
 found time for an nterview one 7:00
 a.m.
 So great is his hatred of the Com-
 munists, he said, that he will fight
 to the last man. But he also despises
 the Central Govern meat. He attack-
 ed Generalissimo Gliang Kai-shek for
 sending him only  y, trickle of arms
 and  ammunition.  If  acting-Pres-
 ident Li Tsung-jen makes peace with
 the Communists,  : e continued, he
 will ignore the pea 'e.  He called for
 American aid.
 The concensus is chat Ma Pu-fang's
 Moslem troops wil' fight. and fight
 well.  Those we saw drilling in Si-
 ring were easily th..+ sharpest-looking
 soldiers we have s''en in China.
 But Ma's 100,000 troops are spread
 thin on a line from -Tihwa, nearly
 1.000 miles west c>f Sining, to the
 Shensi front, about  400 miles east.
 Following a  recen?  conference  in
 Lanchow of the governors of     the
 Northwest  provinces,   Ma  drafted
 enough men for     ;mother division.
 This  does not chenge  the  picture
 Air  Transport,  just flew them 50
 tons of American aid program muni-
 tions, but the  arms stock  remains
 low. Northwest China, far away on
 the Central Asian highland, appears
 beyond the reach of effective Amer-
 ican                                                                                                   help,  assuming such help is
 tendered.
 Chinghai's hope seems to be that
 the Reds will not  now expend the
 men to storm the Sining River valley,
 the main entrance to the province.
 It is a narrow defile which a small
 force could hold for a time.
 Similarly situated as to  arms is
 Ninghsia province, whose governor
 is  another  Moslem  warlord, Ma
 Hung-kwei.   Ma Hung-kwei,  how-
 ever, is closer to Red territory, has
 a   smaller  percentage' of warlike
 Moslems in his army, and does not
 enjoy the same natural defenses. as
 Chinghai.
 Both  Mas    represent  a Moslem
 minority   ruling   a   non-Moslem
 majority.    According  to reliable,
 neutral sources, the latter has little
 or no desire to fight.
 Chungking And Chengtu
 Five hundred miles south, in the
 heart  of    Szechuen  province, are
 Chungking, China's' wartime capital,
 and  Chengtu,   provincial capital.
 Mayor Yang Shen of Chungking,
 a former warlord, tells you the peo-
 ple fear the Communists, but that
 if,  acting-President  Li Tsung-jen
 makes peace,  Szechuen will accept
 it.  There is, however, one' proviso:
 should                 Chiang  Kai-shek reject a
 peace consummated by Li Tsung-jen,
 Yang believes that China's rich pro-
 vinces,                                                                                                                     including  Szechuen, would
 support the Generalissimo. -
 Two                    others, General Hsu Sze-
 ping,                                                                                                                     Secretary-General of the
 Chungking Pacification Headquarters,
 a military, area embracing four huge
 provinces, and a high official of the
 provincial government in  Chengtu,
 both acknowledge that the peasants
 are fed up with war.
 The Chengtu Garrison Commander
 and  chief  of  the  secret  police,
 Lieutenant-General  Yen   Hsiao-fu,
 denounces the Communists, but say,
 he is willing to    string along with
 the Central Government in its peace-
 making efforts.
 The position of the officials falls
 into  -perspective  as  you  talk  to
 others.    General Hsien Teh-sen, an
 official of the outlawed Democratic
 League,  and  a     wealthy- landlord
 living in a  hilltop  mansion  1,000
 feet above  the Chialing     River, in
 Chungking,   declares,  "the  people
 urgently need and want peace."
 Despite  the     government's  order
 that political prisoners be freed as
 evidence to the Communists of good
 faith in peace negotiations, the staff
 of two  Democratic League     papers
 remain in  jai], Hsien   maintained.

 age and  scholarship are  venerated
 even among political enemies.
 Missionaries and foreign consular
 officers confirm his statement that
 the people want an end to fighting.
 You  are told of  abuses by the
 government. . The  peasant   spends
 two or three days bringing his rice
 to tax collection  offices, for taxes
 are paid in kind.  Eating along the
 way is  expensive   for  him.   But
 sometimes when he turns in his rice
 he is told that the grain is inferior,
 and that he  cannot be given  full
 credit for it. He has, no recourse.
 Then the tax rice is often sold to
 speculators-sor_retimes government,
 officials-who dump it on the market
 at harvest time, depressing the price
 the peasant' receives for his grain.
 A  few  months  later,  when   the
 peasant has to buy rice for food,
 the price will have soared.
 A Chinese  recites a jingle com-
 monly used to                   describe the  public
 attitude toward   government   of-
 ficials :
 "Meet and not discuss;
 Discuss and not decide;
 Decide and not act;
 Act and not show strength"
 Men In Uniform
 Despite the talk about peace, sol-
 diers are omnipresent. At first, be-
 cause they are so unmilitary-looking,
 one does not take much note of them.
 But then  you  become  aware that
 wherever  you  go,   however   you
 travel,  there  are  always  men  in
 uniform.
 In Lanchow, there are no customs
 officials, so  soldiers inspect your
 luggage.   On  the  Chinghai-Kansu
 border, it is they who check travel-
 lers  (asking us for calling                  cards
 rather than passports).         In Chung-
 king, Chinese Air Force planes were
 flying passengers about the country
 -for pay.    In Chengtu, there were
 no  coolies  to  load  a commercial
 plane, so  soldiers were   ordered to
 do the job.
 Hanchung, a walled city in South
 Shensi, is jammed with troops who
 have   been  evacuated  from Sian,
 where the war is going badly for
 the Nationalists.  Military traffic on
 the highway from Szechuen to Han-
 chung, Sian, and Lanchow is report-
 ed heavy.                   Soldiers ride truck con-
 voys  around  Kunming  to  protect
 them from bandits.
 Seven new divisions are being con-
 scripted      in  Chungking,  five  in
 Yunnan, in addition to the one in
 Chinghai.
 Officials declare the new units are
 to be used only if peace negotiations
 fail.    But the men appear dispirited
 and lackadaisical.. A former colonel
 in the Chinese army who has. travel-
 led all over West China says that
 neither  rookies nor veterans  have
 the slightest desire to fight.   He
 adds that even high officers cannot
 support their families on their pay.
 With few arms  and a  populace
 which may become ugly if an at-
 tempt is made to force it to carry
 on the war,  West China can only
 await the inevitable.                   tion to Article 17t of the Constitu-    (1FR  f 4 ) by,  as  Mencius  says,

 China", ,, Suicidal Factors At Work
 _A MIDNIGHT CRY ('}            P   )
 OF all the suicid: l factors at work
 in this pseudo-4 emocracy of ours,
 the trampling of p dple's rights has
 been the greatest. The Government
 has muzzled free ,peech and press,
 imposed  heavy  tr xes,  monopolized
 commercial enterpi ses and indulged
 in the wanton issue of banknotes. In
 so doing, it has a;! ~nated itself from
 the people, without whose support no
 government can lom.g survive.
 Professors Wen  -to and Li Kung-
 po were                                                       assassinated  in  Kunming
 because of their  outspoken attacks
 on the corruption c' the bureaucrats.
 Gestapo and secret service men have
 been so omnipreser t in cities in the
 interior that the o vners of teashops
 and restaurants, jr order to prevent
 any untoward inc i. cents, had notices
 posted on their walls reading:  "Re-
 frain from talking politics. By order
 -of the Gendarme    orps."       Even  in
 Shanghai men and women have been
 secretly whisked v vay by the   Ges-
 tapo on the ptetc  t that they were
 either communists or  anti-Kuomin-
 tang   and                                                            hav;     been     heard
 of no more.  As ate as  last May,
 disappearances ur.c Hr the guise  of
 suppressing  comm anism were    fre-
 quent in Shanghai, but in reality the
 victims' only crime if it could be
 called a crime, wan to oppose official -
 corruption.
 These  activities  silenced   public
 opinion, and innocent   people, once
 they were kidnaped by the secret
 agents, had little .recourse.  Many a
 respectable family was    terrorized
 and its only alternative was to take
 flight to Hongkong. The activities of
 the myriad  illega and    semi-legal
 organizations drov,> hundreds of in-
 nocent citizens to Foreign asylums.
 The Bill of Righ s remained a dead
 letter in spite of the promulgation
 of the Constitutiot, on December 25,
 1947.   There  w.: s,  for  example,
 the Peking student tragedy, in which
 14 students  died    under rifle and
 machine gun fire :.nd more than 100
 were wounded.
 No more did the Constitution safe-
 guard the right to freedom of the
 press.  On July 8. 1948, the Hsin Min
 Pao, an independ it Nanking news-
 paper with a 20 y'?ar history and the
 largest circulation in the city, was
