Preface 
Origins of this Report 
On November 3, 1986, Al-Shiraa, a Lebanese 
weekly, reported that the United States had 
secretly sold arms to Iran. Subsequent re-
ports claimed that the purpose of the sales 
was to win the release of American hostages 
in Lebanon. These reports seemed unbeliev-
able: Few principles of U.S. policy were 
stated more forcefully by the Reagan Ad-
ministration than refusing to traffic with ter-
rorists or sell arms to the Government of the 
Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. 
Although the Administration initially 
denied the reports, by mid-November it was 
clear that the accounts were true. The 
United States had sold arms to Iran and had 
hoped thereby to gain the release of Ameri-
can hostages in Lebanon. However, even 
though the Iranians received the arms, just 
as many Americans remained hostage as 
before. Three had been freed, but three more 
had been taken during the period of the 
sales. 
There was still another revelation to come: 
on November 25 the Attorney General an-
nounced that proceeds from the Iran arms 
sales had been "diverted" to the Nicaraguan 
resistance at a time when U.S. military aid to 
the Contras was prohibited. 
Iran and Nicaragua?twin thorns of U.S. 
foreign policy in the 1980s?were thus linked 
in a credibility crisis that raised serious ques-
tions about the adherence of the Administra-
tion to the Constitutional processes of Gov-
ernment. 
The public and Members of Congress ex-
pressed deep concern over the propriety and 
legality of actions by the staff of the Nation-
al Security Council (NSC) and other officers 
of the Government regarding both the arms 
sales and the secret assistance to the Contras. 
The issue of U.S. support for the Contras 
was not new. The President and Congress 
had engaged in vigorous debate over the 
proper course of U.S. policy, and Congress 
had barred U.S. support of Contra military 
operations for almost 2 years. Subsequently, 
senior Administration officials had assured 
Committees of Congress repeatedly that the 
Administration was abiding by the law. 
The Iran-Contra Affair, as it came to be 
known, carried such serious implications for 
U.S. foreign policy, and for the rule of law 
in a democracy, that the 100th Congress de-
termined to undertake its own investigation 
of the Affair. 
The inquiry formally began on January 6, 
1987, when the Senate, by S. Res. 23, estab-
lished the Select Committee on Secret Mili-
tary Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan 
Opposition. The next day, the House, by H. 
Res. 12, established the Select Committee to 
Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with 
Iran. The two Chambers charged their re-
spective Committees with investigating four 
major areas: arms sales to Iran, the possible 
diversion of funds, to aid the Contras, viola-
tions of Federal law, and the involvement of 
the NSC staff in the conduct of foreign 
policy. 
The two Committees took the unprece-
dented step of merging their investigations 
and hearings and sharing all the information 
they obtained. The staffs of the two Commit-
tees worked together in reviewing more than 
300,000 documents and interviewing or ex-
amining more than 500 witnesses. The Com-
mittees held 40 days of joint public hearings

Preface 
and several executive sessions. The two 
Committees then decided to combine their 
findings in a joint Report. 
The conclusions in this Report are based 
on a record marred by inconsistent testimony 
and failure on the part of several witnesses 
to recall key matters and events. Moreover, 
a key witness?Director of Central Intelli-
gence William J. Casey?died, and members 
of the NSC staff shredded relevant contem-
poraneous documents in the fall of 1986. 
Consequently, objective evidence that could 
have resolved the inconsistencies and over-
come the failures of memory was denied to 
the Committees?and to history. 
Under the American system, Government 
is accountable to the people. A public bipar-
tisan investigation such as this one helps to 
ensure that the principle of accountability is 
enforced for all officials and' policies. It 
strengthens the national commitment to the 
democratic values that have guided the 
United States for two centuries. 
The President cooperated with the investi-
gation. He did not assert executive privilege; 
he instructed all relevant agencies to 
produce their documents and witnesses; and 
xvi 
he made extracts available from his personal 
diaries, although he rejected the Committees' 
request to refer to those entries in this Report 
on the ground that he did not wish to estab-
lish a precedent for future Presidents. 
The Committees also received unprece-
dented cooperation from a sovereign nation, 
the State of Israel. Although not willing to 
allow its officials to be examined, the Gov-
ernment of Israel assembled and furnished 
the Committees with extensive materials and 
information, including information affecting 
its national security. 
The Committees' investigation of the Iran-
Contra Affair is not the first, following as it 
does the findings of the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence and the President's 
Special Review Board (known as the Tower 
Board); nor will it be the last, for the investi-
gation of the Independent Counsel assigned 
to this matter continues. 
But the Committees hope this Report will 
make a contribution by helping to explain 
what happened in the Iran-Contra Affair, 
and by helping to restore the public's confi-
dence in this Nation's Constitutional system 
of Government.

Executive Summary 
The full story of the Iran-Contra Affair is 
complicated, and, for this Nation, profoundly 
sad. In the narrative portion of this Report, 
the Committees present a comprehensive ac-
count of the facts, based on 10 months of 
investigation, including 11 weeks of hearings. 
But the facts alone do not explain how or 
why the events occurred. In this Executive 
Summary, the Committees focus on the key 
issues and offer their conclusions. Minority, 
supplemental, and additional views are print-
ed in Section II and Section III. 
Summary of the Facts 
The Iran-Contra Affair had its origin in two 
unrelated revolutions in Iran and Nicaragua. 
In Nicaragua, the long-time President, 
General Anastasio Somoza Debayle, was 
overthrown in 1979 and replaced by a Gov-
ernment controlled by Sandinista leftists. 
In Iran, the pro-Western Government of 
the Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlavi was over-
thrown in 1979 by Islamic fundamentalists 
led by the Ayatollah Khomeini. The Kho-
meini Government, stridently anti-American, 
became a supporter of terrorism against 
American citizens. 
Nicaragua 
United States policy following the revolu-
tion in Nicaragua was to encourage the San-
dinista Government to keep its pledges of 
pluralism and democracy. However, the San-
dinista regime became increasingly anti-
American and autocratic; began to aid a left-
ist insurgency in El Salvador; and turned 
toward Cuba and the Soviet Union for politi-
cal, military, and economic assistance. By 
December 1981, the United States had begun 
supporting the Nicaraguan Contras, armed 
opponents of the Sandinista regime. 
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
was the U.S. Government agency that assist-
ed the Contras. In accordance with Presiden-
tial decisions, known as Findings, and with 
funds appropriated by Congress, the CIA 
armed, clothed, fed, and supervised the Con-
tras. Despite this assistance, the Contras 
failed to win widespread popular support or 
military victories within Nicaragua. 
Although the President continued to favor 
support of the Contras, opinion polls indicat-
ed that a majority of the public was not 
supportive. Opponents of the Administra-
tion's policy feared that U.S. involvement 
with the Contras would embroil the United 
States in another Vietnam. Supporters of the 
policy feared that, without U.S. support for 
the Contras, the Soviets would gain a dan-
gerous toehold in Central America. 
Congress prohibited Contra aid for the 
purpose of overthrowing the Sandinista 
Government in fiscal year 1983, and limited 
all aid to the Contras in fiscal year 1984 to 
$24 million. Following disclosure in March 
and April 1984 that the CIA had a role in 
connection with the mining of the Nicara-
guan harbors without adequate notification 
to Congress, public criticism mounted and 
the Administration's Contra policy lost much 
of its support within Congress. After further 
vigorous debate, Congress exercised its Con-
stitutional power over appropriations and cut 
off all funds for the Contras' military and 
paramilitary operations. The statutory provi-
sion cutting off funds, known as the Boland 
Amendment, was part of a fiscal year 1985 
omnibus appropriations bill, and was signed

Executive Summary 
into law by the President on October 12, 
1984. 
Still, the President felt strongly about the 
Contras, and he ordered his staff, in the 
words of his National Security Adviser, to 
find a way to keep the Contras "body and 
soul together." Thus began the story of how 
the staff of a White House advisory body, 
the NSC, became an operational entity that 
secretly ran the Contra assistance effort, and 
later the Iran initiative. The action officer 
placed in charge of both operations was Lt. 
Col. Oliver L. North. 
Denied funding by Congress, the President 
turned to third countries and private sources. 
Between June 1984 and the beginning of 
1986, the President, his National Security 
Adviser, and the NSC staff secretly raised 
$34 million for the Contras from other coun-
tries. An additional $2.7 million was provid-
ed for the Contras during 1985 and 1986 
from private contributors, who were ad-
dressed by North and occasionally granted 
photo opportunities with the President. In 
the middle of this period, Assistant Secretary 
of State A. Langhorne Motley?from whom 
these contributions were concealed?gave 
his assurance to Congress that the Adminis-
tration was not "soliciting and/or encourag-
ing third countries" to give funds to the 
Contras because, as he conceded, the Boland 
Amendment prohibited such solicitation. 
The first contributions were sent by the 
donors to bank accounts controlled and used 
by the Contras. However, in July 1985, 
North took control of the funds and?with 
the support of two National Security Advis-
ers (Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter) 
and, according to North, Director Casey?
used those funds to run the covert operation 
to support the Contras. 
At the suggestion of Director Casey, 
North recruited Richard V. Secord, a retired 
Air Force Major General with experience in 
special operations. Secord set up Swiss bank 
accounts, and North steered future donations 
into these accounts. Using these funds, and 
funds later generated by the Iran arms sales, 
Secord and his associate, Albert Hakim, cre-
ated what they called "the Enterprise," a 
private organization designed to engage in 
covert activities on behalf of the United 
States. 
The Enterprise, functioning largely at 
North's direction, had its own airplanes, 
pilots, airfield, operatives, ship, secure com-
munications devices, and secret Swiss bank 
accounts. For 16 months, it served as the 
secret arm of the NSC staff, carrying out 
with private and non-appropriated money, 
and without the accountability or restrictions 
imposed by law on the CIA, a covert Contra 
aid program that Congress thought it had 
prohibited. 
Although the IA and other agencies in-
volved in intelligence activities knew that 
the Boland Amendment barred their involve-
ment in covert support for the Contras, 
North's Contra support operation received 
logistical and tactical support from various 
personnel in the CIA and other agencies. 
Certain CIA personnel in Central America 
gave their assistance. The U.S. Ambassador 
in Costa Rica, Lewis Tambs, provided his 
active assistance. North also enlisted the aid 
of Defense Department personnel in Central 
America, and obtained secure communica-
tions equipment from the National Security 
Agency. The Assistant Secretary of State 
with responsibility for the region, Elliott 
Abrams, professed ignorance of this support. 
He later stated that he had been "careful not 
to ask North lots of questions." 
By Executive Order and National Security 
Decision Directive issued by President 
Reagan, all covert operations must be ap-
proved by the President personally and in 
writing. By statute, Congress must be noti-
fied about each covert action. The funds 
used for such actions, like all government 
funds, must be strictly accounted for. 
The covert action directed by North, 
however, was not approved by the President 
in writing. Congress was not notified about 
it. And the funds to support it were never 
accounted for. In short, the operation func-
tioned without any of the accountability re-
quired of Government activities. It was an

Executive Summary 
evasion of the Constitution's most basic 
check on Executive action?the power of 
the Congress to grant or deny funding for 
Government programs. 
Moreover, the covert action to support the 
Contras was concealed from Congress and 
the public. When the press reported in the 
summer of 1985 that the NSC staff was en-
gaged in raising money and furnishing mili-
tary support to the Contras, the President 
assured the public that the law was being 
followed. His National Security Adviser, 
Robert C. McFarlane, assured Committees of 
Congress, both in person and in writing, that 
the NSC staff was obeying both the spirit 
and the letter of the law, and was neither 
soliciting money nor coordinating military 
support for the Contras. 
A year later, McFarlane's successor, Vice 
Admiral John M. Poindexter, repeated these 
assurances to Congressional Committees. 
Then, with Poindexter's blessing, North told 
the House Intelligence Committee he was 
involved neither in fundraising for, nor in 
providing military advice to, the Contras. 
When one of Secord's planes was shot 
down over Nicaragua on October 5, 1986, 
the President and several administration 
spokesmen assured the public that the U.S. 
Government had no connection with the 
flight or the captured American crew 
member, Eugene Hasenfus. Several senior 
Government officials, including Elliott 
Abrams, gave similar assurances to Congress. 
Two months later, McFarlane told Con-
gressional Committees that he had no knowl-
edge of contributions made by a foreign 
country, Country 2, to the Contras, when in 
fact McFarlane and the President had dis-
cussed and welcomed $32 million in contri-
butions from that country. In addition, 
Abrams initially concealed from Congress?
in testimony given to several Committees?
that he had successfully solicited a contribu-
tion of $10 million from Brunei. 
North conceded at the Committees' public 
hearings that he had participated in making 
statements to Congress that were "false," 
"misleading," "evasive and wrong." 
During the period when the Administra-
tion was denying to Congress that it was 
involved in supporting the Contras' war 
effort, it was engaged in a campaign to alter 
public opinion and change the vote in Con-
gress on Contra aid. Public funds were used 
to conduct public relations activities; and 
certain NSC staff members, using the pres-
tige of the White House and the promise of 
meetings with the President, helped raise pri-
vate donations both for media campaigns and 
for weapons to be used by the Contras. 
Pursuant to a Presidential directive in 1983 
the Administration adopted a "public diplo-
macy" program to promote the President's 
Central American policy. The program was 
conducted by an office in the State Depart-
ment known as the Office for Public Diplo-
macy for Latin America and the Caribbean, 
(S/LPD). S/LPD's activities were coordi-
nated not within the State Department, but 
by an interagency working group established 
by the NSC. The principal NSC staff officer 
was a former senior CIA official, with expe-
rience in covert operations, who had been 
detailed to the NSC staff for a year with 
Casey's approval, and who upon retirement 
from the CIA became a Special Assistant to 
the President with responsibility for public 
diplomacy matters. 
S/LPD produced and widely disseminated 
a variety of pro-Contra publications and ar-
ranged speeches and press conferences. It 
also disseminated what one official termed 
"white propaganda": pro-Contra newspaper 
articles by paid consultants who did not dis-
close their connection to the Administration. 
Moreover, under a series of sole source con-
tracts in 1985 and 1986, S/LPD paid more 
than $400,000 for pro Contra public relations 
work to International Business Communica-
tions (IBC), a company owned by Richard 
Miller, whose organization was described by 
one White House representative as a "White 
House outside the White House." 
The Administration, like Members of Con-
gress, may appeal directly to the people for 
support of its positions; and government 
agencies may legitimately disseminate infor-

Executive Summary 
mation and educational materials to the 
public. However, by law appropriated funds 
may not be used to generate propaganda 
"designed to influence a Member of Con-
gress;" and by law, as interpreted by the 
Office of the Comptroller General, appropri-
ated funds may not be used by the State 
Department for "covert" propaganda activi-
ties. A GAO report concluded that S/LPD's 
white propaganda activities violated the ban 
on arranging "covert propaganda." 
Private funds were also used. North and 
Miller helped Carl R. "Spitz" Channell raise 
$10 million, most of which went to Chan-
nell's tax-exempt organization, the National 
Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty 
("NEPL"). They arranged numerous "brief-
ings" at the White House complex on Cen-
tral America by Administration officials for 
groups of potential contributors. Following 
these briefings, Channell reconvened the 
groups at the Hay-Adams Hotel, and made a 
pitch for tax-deductible contributions to 
NEPL's Central America "public education" 
program or, in some individual cases, for 
weapons. Channell's major contributors were 
given private briefings by North, and were 
afforded private visits and photo sessions 
with the President. On one occasion, Presi-
dent Reagan participated in a briefing. 
Using the donated money, Channell ran a 
series of television advertisements in 1985 
and 1986, some of which were directed at 
television markets covering the home dis-
tricts of Congressmen considered to be 
"swing" votes on Contra aid. One series of 
advertisements was used to attack Congress-
man Mike Barnes, a principal opponent of 
Contra aid, and one of the Congressmen to 
whom Administration officials had denied 
violating the Boland Amendment in Septem-
ber of 1985. Channell later boasted to North 
that he had "participated in a campaign to 
ensure Congressman Barnes' defeat." 
Of the $10 million raised by North, Chan-
nell and Miller, more than $1 million was 
used for pro-Contra publicity. Approximate-
ly $2.7 million was sent through IBC and 
off-shore accounts of another Miller-con-
6 
trolled company to Secord's Swiss accounts, 
or to Calero's account in Miami. Most of the 
remainder was spent on salaries and expenses 
for Channell, Miller and their business asso-
ciates. 
NEPL's charter did not contemplate rais-
ing funds for a covert war in Nicaragua, and 
the Internal Revenue Service never ap-
proved such activity when NEPL was grant-
ed exempt status. As a consequence, Chan-
nell and Miller have each pleaded guilty to 
the crime of conspiring to defraud the 
United States Treasury of revenues "by sub-
verting and corrupting the lawful purposes 
of NEPL." Channell named North as a co-
conspirator. 
In private fundraising, as in the "white 
propaganda" campaign, the goal of support-
ing the Contras was allowed to override sen-
sitivity to law and to accepted norms of be-
havior. 
Iran 
The NSC staff was already engaged in 
covert operations through Secord when, in 
the summer of 1985, the Government of 
Israel proposed that missiles be sold to Iran 
in return for the release of seven American 
hostages held in Lebanon and the prospect 
of improved relations with Iran. The Secre-
taries of State and Defense repeatedly op-
posed such sales to a government designated 
by the United States as a supporter of inter-
national terrorism. They called it a straight 
arms-for-hostages deal that was contrary to 
U.S. public policy. They also argued that 
these sales would violate the Arms Export 
Control Act, as well as the U.S. arms embar-
go against Iran. The embargo had been im-
posed after the taking of hostages at the U.S. 
Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, 
and was continued because of the Iran-Iraq 
war. 
Nevertheless, in the summer of 1985 the 
President authorized Israel to proceed with 
the sales. The NSC staff conducting the 
Contra covert action also took operational 
control of implementing the President's deci-
sion on arms sales to Iran. The President did

Executive Summary 
not sign a Finding for this covert operation, 
nor did he notify the Congress. 
Israel shipped 504 TOW anti-tank missiles 
to Iran in August and September 1985. Al-
though the Iranians had promised to release 
most of the American hostages in return, 
only one, Reverend Benjamin Weir, was 
freed. The President persisted. In November, 
he authorized Israel to ship 80 HAWK anti-
aircraft missiles in return for all the hostages, 
with a promise of prompt replenishment by 
the United States, and 40 more HAWKs to 
be sent directly by the United States to Iran. 
Eighteen HAWK missiles were actually 
shipped from Israel in November 1985, but 
no hostages were released. 
In early December 1985, the President 
signed a retroactive Finding purporting to 
authorize the November HAWK transaction. 
That Finding contained no reference to im-
proved relations with Iran. It was a straight 
arms-for-hostages Finding. National Security 
Adviser Poindexter destroyed this Finding a 
year later because, he testified, its disclosure 
would have been politically embarrassing to 
the President. 
The November HAWK transaction had 
additional significance. The Enterprise re-
ceived a $1 million advance from the Israe-
lis. North and Secord testified this was for 
transportation expenses in connection with 
the 120 HAWK missiles. Since only 18 mis-
siles were shipped, the Enterprise was left 
with more than $800,000 in spare cash. 
North directed the Enterprise to retain the 
money and spend it for the Contras. The 
"diversion" had begun. 
North realized that the sale of missiles to 
Iran could be used to support the Contras. 
He told Israeli Defense Ministry officials on 
December 6, 1985, one day after the Presi-
dent signed the Finding, that he planned to 
generate profits on future arms sales for ac-
tivities in Nicaragua. 
On December 7, 1985, the President and 
his top advisers met again to discuss the 
arms sales. Secretaries Shultz and Weinberg-
er objected vigorously once more, and Wein-
berger argued that the sales would be illegal. 
After a meeting in London with an Iranian 
interlocutor and the Israelis, McFarlane rec-
ommended that the sales be halted. Admiral 
John Poindexter (the new National Security 
Adviser), and Director Casey were of the 
opposite opinion. 
The President decided to go forward with 
the arms sales to get the hostages back. He 
signed a Finding on January 6, 1986, author-
izing more shipments of missiles for the hos-
tages. When the CIA's General Counsel 
pointed out that authorizing Israel to sell its 
U.S.-manufactured weapons to Iran might 
violate the Arms Export Control Act, the 
President, on the legal advice of the Attor-
ney General, decided to authorize direct 
shipments of the missiles to Iran by the 
United States and signed a new Finding on 
January 17, 1986. To carry out the sales, the 
NSC staff turned once again to the Enter-
prise. 
Although North had become skeptical that 
the sales would lead to the release of all the 
hostages or a new relationship with Iran, he 
believed that the prospect of generating 
funds for the Contras was "an attractive in-
centive" for continuing the arms sales. No 
matter how many promises the Iranians 
failed to keep throughout this secret initia-
tive, the arms sales continued to generate 
funds for the Enterprise, and North and his 
superior, Poindexter, were consistent advo-
cates for their continuation. What North and 
Poindexter asserted in their testimony that 
they did not know, however, was that most 
of these arms sales profits would remain with 
the Enterprise and never reach the Contras. 
In February 1986, the United States, 
acting through the Enterprise, sold 1,000 
TOWs to the Iranians. The U.S. also provid-
ed the Iranians with military intelligence 
about Iraq. All of the remaining American 
hostages were supposed to be released upon 
Iran's receipt of the first 500 TOWs. None 
was. But the transaction was productive in 
one respect. The difference between what 
the Enterprise paid the United States for the 
missiles and -what it received from Iran was 
more than $6 million. North directed part of

Executive Summary 
this profit for the Contras and for other 
covert operations. Poindexter testified that 
he authorized this "diversion." 
The diversion, for the Contras and other 
covert activities, was not an isolated act by 
the NSC staff. Poindexter saw it as "imple-
menting" the President's secret policy that 
had been in effect since 1984 of using non-
appropriated funds following passage of the 
Boland Amendment. 
According to North, CIA Director Casey 
saw the "diversion" as part of a more gran-
diose plan to use the Enterprise as a "stand-
alone," "off-the-shelf," covert capacity that 
would act throughout the world while evad-
ing Congressional review. To Casey, Poin-
dexter, and North, the diversion was an inte-
gral part of selling arms to Iran and just one 
of the intended uses of the proceeds. 
In May 1986, the President again tried to 
sell weapons to get the hostages back. This 
time, the President agreed to ship parts for 
HAWK missiles but only on condition that 
all the American hostages in Lebanon be re-
leased first. A mission headed by Robert 
McFarlane, the former National Security 
Adviser, traveled to Tehran with the first 
installment of the HAWK parts. When the 
mission arrived, McFarlane learned that the 
Iranians claimed they had never promised to 
do anything more than try to obtain the hos-
tages' release. The trip ended amid misunder-
standing and failure, although the first in-
stallment of HAWK parts was delivered. 
The Enterprise was paid, however, for all 
of the HAWK parts, and realized more than 
an $8 million profit, part of which was ap-
plied, at North's direction, to the Contras. 
Another portion of the profit was used by 
North for other covert operations, including 
the operation of a ship for a secret mission. 
The idea of an off-the-shelf, stand-alone 
covert capacity had become operational. 
On July 26, 1986, another American hos-
tage, Father Lawrence Jenco, was released. 
Despite all the arms sales, he was only the 
second hostage freed, and the first since Sep-
tember 1985. Even though McFarlane had 
vowed at the Tehran meeting not to deliver 
8 
the remainder of the HAWK parts until all 
the hostages were released, the Administra-
tion capitulated again. The balance of the 
HAWK parts was shipped when Father 
Jenco was released. 
In September and October 1986, the NSC 
staff began negotiating with a new group of 
Iranians, the "Second Channel," that Albert 
Hakim had opened, in part, through prom-
ises of bribes. Although these Iranians alleg-
edly had better contacts with Iranian offi-
cials, they, in fact, represented the same prin-
cipals as did the First Channel and had the 
same arrangement in mind: missiles for hos-
tages. Once again, the Administration insist-
ed on release of all the hostages but settled 
for less. 
In October, after a meeting in London, 
North left Hakim to negotiate with the Irani-
ans. Hakim made no secret of his desire to 
make large profits for himself and General 
Secord in the $15 billion-a-year Iranian 
market if relations with the United States 
could be restored. Thus, he had every incen-
tive to make an agreement, whatever conces-
sions might be required. 
As an unofficial "ambassador" selected by 
North and Secord, Hakim produced a re-
markable nine-point plan, subsequently ap-
proved by North and Poindexter, under 
which the United States would receive "one 
and one half" hostages (later reduced to 
one). Under the plan, the United States 
agreed not only to sell the Iranians 500 more 
TOWs, but Secord and Hakim promised to 
develop a plan to induce the Kuwaiti Gov-
ernment to release the Da'wa prisoners. 
(Seventeen Kuwaiti prisoners, connected to 
"al-Dawa," an Iranian revolutionary group, 
had been convicted and imprisoned for their 
part in the December 12, 1983, attacks in 
Kuwait on the U.S. Embassy, a U.S. civilian 
compound, the French Embassy, and several 
Kuwaiti Goverment facilities.) The plan to 
obtain the release of the Da'wa prisoners did 
not succeed, but the TOW missiles were sold 
for use by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. 
Following the transfer of these TOWs, a 
third hostage, David Jacobsen, was released

Executive Summary 
on November 2, 1986, and more profit was 
generated for the Enterprise. 
Poindexter testified that the President ap-
proved the nine-point plan. But other testi-
mony raises questions about this assertion. 
Regardless of what Poindexter may have 
told the President, Secretary Shultz testified 
that when he informed the President on De-
cember 14, 1986, that the nine-point plan in-
cluded a promise about the release of the 
Da'wa prisoners in Kuwait, the President re-
acted with shock, "like he had been kicked 
in the belly." 
During the negotiations with the Second 
Channel, North and Secord told the Iranians 
that the President agreed with their position 
that Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, had 
to be removed and further agreed that the 
United States would defend Iran against 
Soviet aggression. They did not clear this 
with the President and their representations 
were flatly contrary to U.S. policy. 
The decision to designate private parties?
Secord and Hakim?to carry out the arms 
transactions had other ramifications. First, 
there was virtually no accounting for the 
profits from the arms deals. Even North 
claimed that he did not know how Secord 
and Hakim actually spent the money com-
mitted to their custody. The Committees' in-
vestigation revealed that of the $16.1 million 
profit from the sales of arms to Iran only 
about $3.8 million went to support the Con-
tras (the amount representing "the diver-
sion"). All told, the Enterprise received 
nearly $48 million from the sale of arms to 
the Contras and Iran, and in contributions 
directed to it by North. A total of $16.5 
million was used to support the Contras or 
to purchase the arms sold to (and paid for 
by) the Contras; $15.2 million was spent on 
Iran; Hakim, Secord, and their associate, 
Thomas Clines, took $6.6 million in commis-
sions and other profit distributions; almost $1 
million went for other covert operations 
sponsored by North; $4.2 million was held in 
"reserves" for use in future operations; $1.2 
million remained in Swiss bank accounts of 
the Enterprise; and several thousand dollars 
were used to pay for a security system at 
North's residence. 
Second, by permitting private parties to 
conduct the arms sales, the Administration 
risked losing control of an important foreign 
policy initiative. Private citizens?whose mo-
tivations of personal gain could conflict with 
the interests of this country?handled sensi-
tive diplomatic negotiations, and purported 
to commit the United States to positions that 
were anathema to the President's public 
policy and wholly unknown to the Secretary 
of State. 
The Coverup 
The sale of arms to Iran was a "significant 
anticipated intelligence activity." By law, 
such an activity must be reported to Con-
gress "in a timely fashion" pursuant to Sec-
tion 501 of the National Security Act. If the 
proposal to sell arms to Iran had been re-
ported, the Senate and House Intelligence 
Committees would likely have joined Secre-
taries Shultz and Weinberger in objecting to 
this initiative. But Poindexter recommend-
ed?and the President decided?not to 
report the Iran initiative to Congress. 
Indeed, the Administration went to consid-
erable lengths to avoid notifying Congress. 
The CIA General Counsel wrote on January 
15, 1986, "the key issue in this entire matter 
revolves around whether or not there will be 
reports made to Congress." Shortly thereaf-
ter, the transaction was restructured to avoid 
the pre-shipment reporting requirements of 
the Arms Export Control Act, and place it 
within the more limited reporting require-
ments of the National Security Act. But 
even these reporting requirements were ig-
nored. The President failed to notify the 
group of eight (the leaders of each party in 
the House and Senate, and the Chairmen and 
Ranking Minority Members of the Intelli-
gence Committees) specified by law for un-
usually sensitive operations. 
After the disclosure of the Iran arms sales 
on November 3, 1986, the American public 
was still not told the facts. The President 
sought to avoid any comment on the ground

Executive Summary 
that it might jeopardize the chance of secur-
ing the remaining hostages' release. But it 
was impossible to remain silent, and inaccu-
rate statements followed. 
In his first public statement on the subject 
on November 6, the President said that the 
reports concerning the arms sales had "no 
foundation." A week later, on November 13, 
the President conceded that the United 
States had sold arms, but branded as "utterly 
false" allegations that the sales were in 
return for the release of the hostages. The 
President also maintained that there had been 
no violations of Federal law. 
At his news conference on November 19, 
1986, he denied that the United States was 
involved in the Israeli sales that occurred 
prior to the January 17, 1986 Finding. The 
President was asked: 
Mr. President . . . are you telling us 
tonight that the only shipments with 
which we were involved were the 
one or two that followed your Janu-
ary 17 Finding and that . . . there 
were no other shipments which the 
U.S. condoned? 
The President replied: 
That's right. I'm saying nothing, but 
the missiles we sold. 
And, on November 25, 1986, the Attorney 
General?with the President at his side?an-
nounced at a press conference that the Presi-
dent did not know of the Israeli shipments 
until after they had occurred. He stated that 
the President learned of the November 1985 
HAWK shipment in February 1986. 
In fact, however, the Israeli sales, includ-
ing the HAWK shipment, were implemented 
with the knowledge and approval of the 
President and his top advisers; and the Presi-
dent himself told Shultz on the day of his 
press conference that he had known of the 
November 1985 shipment when it occurred. 
McFarlane, Poindexter, and North were inti-
mately involved in the Israeli shipments; and 
the CIA had actually transported one deliv-
ery from Israel to Iran. 
10 
While the President was denying any ille-
gality, his subordinates were engaging in a 
coverup. Several of his advisers had ex-
pressed concern that the 1985 sales violated 
the Arms Export Control Act, and a "cover 
story" had been agreed on if these arms sales 
were ever exposed. After North had three 
conversations on November 18, 1986, about 
the legal problems with the 1985 Israeli ship-
ments, he, Poindexter, Casey, and McFarlane 
all told conforming false stories about U.S. 
involvement in these shipments. 
With McFarlane's help, North rewrote 
NSC staff chronologies on November 19 and 
20, 1986, in such a way that they denied 
contemporaneous knowledge by the Admin-
istration of Israel's shipments to Iran in 1985. 
They asserted at one point that the U.S. 
Government believed the November 1985 
shipment consisted of oil-drilling equipment, 
not arms. 
Poindexter told Congressional Committees 
on November 21, 1986, that the United 
States had disapproved of the Israeli ship-
ments and that, until the day before his brief-
ing, he believed that Administration officials 
did not know about any of them until after 
they had occurred. He then destroyed the 
only Finding signed by the President that 
showed the opposite. 
Casey told Congressional Committees on 
November 21, 1986, that although a CIA 
proprietary airline had actually carried mis-
siles to Iran from Israel in 1985, the proprie-
tary had been told the cargo was "oil-drill-
ing equipment." 
McFarlane told the Attorney General on 
November 21, 1986, that the Israelis said 
they were shipping oil-drilling equipment in 
November 1985 and that McFarlane did not 
learn otherwise until May 1986. 
On learning that the President had author-
ized the Attorney General to gather the rele-
vant facts, North and Poindexter shredded 
and altered official documents on November 
21, 1986, and later that weekend. On No-
vember 25, 1986, North's secretary con-
cealed classified documents in her clothing

Executive Summary 
and, with North's knowledge, removed them 
from the White House. 
According to North, a "fall guy" plan was 
proposed by Casey in which North and, if 
necessary, Poindexter, would take the re-
sponsibility for the covert Contra support 
operation and the diversion. On Saturday 
November 22, 1986, in the midst of these 
efforts to conceal what had happened, Poin-
dexter had a two and one half hour lunch 
with Casey. Yet Poindexter could not recall 
anything that was discussed. 
North testified that he assured Poindexter 
that he had destroyed all documents relating 
to the diversion. The diversion nevertheless 
was discovered on November 22, 1986, 
when a Justice Department official, assisting 
the Attorney General's fact-finding inquiry, 
found a "diversion memorandum" that had 
escaped the shredder. 
Prior to the discovery of the diversion 
memorandum, each interview by the Attor-
ney General's fact finding team had been 
conducted in the presence of two witnesses, 
and careful notes were taken in accordance 
with standard professional practices. After 
discovery of the diversion memorandum?
which itself gave rise to an inference of seri-
ous wrongdoing?the Attorney General de-
parted from these standard practices. A 
series of important interviews?Poindexter, 
McFarlane, Casey, Regan, and Bush?was 
conducted by the Attorney General alone, 
and no notes were made. 
The Attorney General then announced at 
his November 25 press conference that the 
diversion had occurred and that the Presi-
dent did not know of it. But he made several 
incorrect statements about his own investiga-
tion. He stated that the President had not 
known of the Israeli pre-Finding shipments, 
and he stated that the proceeds of the arms 
sales had been sent directly from the Israelis 
to the Contras. These statements were both 
mistaken and inconsistent with information 
that had been received during the Attorney 
General's fact-finding inquiry. 
Poindexter testified to these Committees 
that the President did not know of the diver-
sion. North testified that while he assumed 
the President had authorized each diversion, 
Poindexter told him on November 21, 1986, 
that the President had never been told of the 
diversion. 
In light of the destruction of material evi-
dence by Poindexter and North and the 
death of Casey, all of the facts may never be 
known. The Committees cannot even be sure 
whether they heard the whole truth or 
whether Casey's "fall guy" plan was carried 
out at the public hearings. But enough is 
clear to demonstrate beyond doubt that fun-
damental processes of governance were dis-
regarded and the rule of law was subverted. 
Findings and Conclusions 
The common ingredients of the Iran and 
Contra policies were secrecy, deception, and 
disdain for the law. A small group of senior 
officials believed that they alone knew what 
was right. They viewed knowledge of their 
actions by others in the Government as a 
threat to their objectives. They told neither 
the Secretary of State, the Congress nor the 
American people of their actions. When ex-
posure was threatened, they destroyed offi-
cial documents and lied to Cabinet officials, 
to the public, and to elected representatives 
in Congress. They testified that they even 
withheld key facts from the President. 
The United States Constitution specifies 
the process by which laws and policy are to 
be made and executed. Constitutional process 
is the essence of our democracy and our 
democratic form of Government is the basis 
of our strength. Time and again we have 
learned that a flawed process leads to bad 
results, and that a lawless process leads to 
worse. 
Policy Contradictions and Failures 
The Administration's departure from 
democratic processes created the conditions 
for policy failure, and led to contradictions 
which undermined the credibility of the 
United States.

Executive Summary 
The United States simultaneously pursued 
two contradictory foreign policies?a public 
one and a secret one: 
?The public policy was not to make any 
? concessions for the release of hostages lest 
such concessions encourage more hostage-
taking. At the same time, the United States 
was secretly trading weapons to get the hos-
tages back. 
?The public policy was to ban arms ship-
ments to Iran and to exhort other Govern-
ments to observe this embargo. At the same 
time, the United States was secretly selling 
sophisticated missiles to Iran and promising 
more. 
?The public policy was to improve rela-
tions with Iraq. At the same time, the United 
States secretly shared military intelligence on 
Iraq with Iran and North told the Iranians in 
contradiction to United States policy that the 
United States would help promote the over-
throw of the Iraqi head of government. 
?The public policy was to urge all Gov-
ernments to punish terrorism and to support, 
indeed encourage, the refusal of Kuwait to 
free the Da'wa prisoners who were convict-
ed of terrorist acts. At the same time, senior 
officials secretly endorsed a Secord-Hakim 
plan to permit Iran to obtain the release of 
the Da'wa prisoners. 
?The public policy was to observe the 
"letter and spirit" of the Boland Amend-
ment's proscriptions against military or para-
military assistance to the Contras. At the 
same time, the NSC staff was secretly assum-
ing direction and funding of the Contras' 
military effort. 
?The public policy, embodied in agree-
ments signed by Director Casey, was for the 
Administration to consult with the Congres-
sional oversight committees about covert ac-
tivities in a "new spirit of frankness and co-
operation." At the same time, the CIA and 
the White House were secretly withholding 
from those Committees all information con-
cerning the Iran initiative and the Contra 
support network. 
?The public policy, embodied in Execu-
tive Order 12333, was to conduct covert op-
erations solely through the CIA or other 
12 
organs of the intelligence community specifi-
cally authorized by the President. At the 
same time, although the the NSC was not so 
authorized, the NSC staff secretly became 
operational and used private, non-accounta-
ble agents to engage in covert activities. 
These contradictions in policy inevitably 
resulted in policy failure: 
?The United States armed Iran, including 
its most radical elements, but attained neither 
a new relationship with that hostile regime 
nor a reduction in the number of American 
hostages. 
?The arms sales did not lead to a modera-
tion of Iranian policies. Moderates did not 
come forward, and Iran to this day sponsors 
actions directed against the United States in 
the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. 
?The United States opened itself to black-
mail by adversaries who might reveal the 
secret arms sales and who, according to 
North, threatened to kill the hostages if the 
sales stopped. 
?The United States undermined its credi-
bility with friends and allies, including mod-
erate Arab states, by its public stance of op-
posing arms sales to Iran while undertaking 
such arms sales in secret. 
?The United States lost a $10 million 
contribution to the Contras from the Sultan 
of Brunei by directing it to the wrong bank 
account?the result of an improper effort to 
channel that humanitarian aid contribution 
into an account used for lethal assistance. 
?The United States sought illicit funding 
for the Contras through profits from the 
secret arms sales, but a substantial portion of 
those profits ended up in the personal bank 
accounts of the private individuals executing 
the sales?while the exorbitant amounts 
charged for the weapons inflamed the Irani-
ans with whom the United States was seek-
ing a new relationship. 
Flawed Policy Process 
The record of the Iran-Contra Affair also 
shows a seriously flawed policymaking proc-
ess.

Executive Summary 
Confusion 
There was confusion and disarray at the 
highest levels of Government. 
?McFarlane embarked on a dangerous 
trip to Tehran under a complete misappre-
hension. He thought the Iranians had prom-
ised to secure the release of all hostages 
before he delivered arms, when in fact they 
had promised only to seek the hostages' re-
lease, and then only after one planeload of 
arms had arrived. 
?The President first told the Tower 
Board that he had approved the initial Israeli 
shipments. Then, he told the Tower Board 
that he had not. Finally, he told the Tower 
Board that he does not know whether he 
approved the initial Israeli arms shipments, 
and his top advisers disagree on the question. 
?The President claims he does not recall 
signing a Finding approving the November 
1985 HAWK shipment to Iran. But Poin-
dexter testified that the President did sign a 
Finding on December 5, 1985, approving the 
shipment retroactively. Poindexter later de-
stroyed the Finding to save the President 
from embarassment. 
?That Finding was prepared without ade-
quate discussion and stuck in Poindexter's 
safe for a year; Poindexter claimed he forgot 
about it; the White House asserts the Presi-
dent never signed it; and when events began 
to unravel, Poindexter ripped it up. 
?The President and the Attorney General 
told the public that the President did not 
know about the November 1985 Israeli 
HAWK shipment until February 1986?an 
error the White House Chief of Staff ex-
plained by saying that the preparation for 
the press conference "sort of confused the 
Presidential mind." 
?Poindexter says the President would 
have approved the diversion, if he had been 
asked; and the President says he would not 
have. 
?One National Security Adviser under-
stood that the Boland Amendment applied to 
the NSC; another thought it did not. Neither 
sought a legal opinion on the question. 
?The President incorrectly assured the 
American people that the NSC staff was ad-
hering to the law and that the Government 
was not connected to the Hasenfus airplane. 
His staff was in fact conducting a "full serv-
ice" covert operation to support the Contras 
which they believed he had authorized. 
?North says he sent five or six completed 
memorandums to Poindexter seeking the 
President's approval for the diversion. Poin-
dexter does not remember receiving any. 
Only one has been found. 
Dishonesty and Secrecy 
The Iran-Contra Affair was characterized 
by pervasive dishonesty and inordinate secre-
cy. 
North admitted that he and other officials 
lied repeatedly to Congress and to the Amer-
ican people about the Contra covert action 
and Iran arms sales, and that he altered and 
destroyed official documents. North's testi-
mony demonstrates that he also lied to mem-
bers of the Executive branch, including the 
Attorney General, and officials of the State 
Department, CIA and NSC. 
Secrecy became an obsession. Congress 
was never informed of the Iran or the 
Contra covert actions, notwithstanding the 
requirement in the law that Congress be no-
tified of all covert actions in a "timely fash-
ion." 
Poindexter said that Donald Regan, the 
President's Chief of Staff, was not told of the 
NSC staffs fundraising activities because he 
might reveal it to the press. Secretary Shultz 
objected to third-country solicitation in 1984 
shortly before the Boland Amendment was 
adopted; accordingly, he was not told that, 
in the same time period, the National Securi-
ty Adviser had accepted an $8 million con-
tribution from Country 2 even though the 
State Department had prime responsibility 
for dealings with that country. Nor was the 
Secretary of State told by the President in 
February 1985 that the same country had 
pledged another $24 million?even though 
the President briefed the Secretary of State 
on his meeting with the head of state at

Executive Summary 
which the pledge was made. Poindexter 
asked North to keep secrets from Casey; 
Casey, North, and Poindexter agreed to keep 
secrets from Shultz. 
Poindexter and North cited fear of leaks as 
a justification for these practices. But the 
need to prevent public disclosure cannot jus-
tify the deception practiced upon Members 
of Congress and Executive branch officials 
by those who knew of the arms sales to Iran 
and of the Contra support network. The 
State and Defense Departments deal each 
day with the most sensitive matters affecting 
millions of lives here and abroad. The Con-
gressional Intelligence Committees receive 
the most highly classified information, in-
cluding information on covert activities. Yet, 
according to North and Poindexter, even the 
senior officials of these bodies could not be 
entrusted with the NSC staff's secrets be-
cause they might leak. 
While Congress's record in maintaining 
the confidentiality of classified information is 
not unblemished, it is not nearly as poor or 
perforated as some members of the NSC 
staff maintained. If the Executive branch has 
any basis to suspect that any member of the 
Intelligence Committees breached security, it 
has the obligation to bring that breach to the 
attention of the House and Senate Leaders?
not to make blanket accusations. Congress 
has the capability and responsibility of pro-
tecting secrets entrusted to it. Congress 
cannot fulfill its legislative responsibilities if 
it is denied information because members of 
the Executive branch, who place their faith 
in a band of international arms merchants 
and fmanciers, unilaterally declare Congress 
unworthy of trust. 
In the case of the "secret" Iran arms-for-
hostages deal, although the NSC staff did 
not inform the Secretary of State, the Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the lead-
ership of the United States Congress, it was 
content to let the following persons know: 
?Manucher Ghorbanifar, who flunked 
every polygraph test administered by the 
U.S. Government; 
14 
?Iranian officials, who daily denounced 
the United States but received an inscribed 
Bible from the President; 
?Officials of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, 
who received the U.S. weapons; 
?Secord and Hakim, whose personal in-
terests could conflict with the interests of the 
United States; 
?Israeli officials, international arms mer-
chants, pilots and air crews, whose interests 
did not always coincide with ours; and 
?An unknown number of shadowy inter-
mediaries and financiers who assisted with 
both the First and Second Iranian Channels. 
While sharing the secret with this dispar-
ate group, North ordered the intelligence 
agencies not to disseminate intelligence on 
the Iran initiative to the Secretaries of State 
and Defense. Poindexter told the Secretary 
of State in May 1986 that the Iran initiative 
was over, at the very time the McFarlane 
mission to Tehran was being launched. Poin-
dexter also concealed from Cabinet officials 
the remarkable nine-point agreement negoti-
ated by Hakim with the Second Channel. 
North assured the FBI liaison to the NSC as 
late as November 1986 that the United States 
was not bargaining for the release of hos-
tages but seizing terrorists to exchange for 
hostages?a complete fabrication. The lies, 
omissions, shredding, attempts to rewrite his-
tory?all continued, even after the President 
authorized the Attorney General to find out 
the facts. 
It was not operational security that moti-
vated such conduct?not when our own 
Government was the victim. Rather, the 
NSC staff feared, correctly, that any disclo-
sure to Congress or the Cabinet of the arms-
for-hostages and arms-for-profit activities 
would produce a storm of outrage. 
As with Iran, Congress was misled about 
the NSC staff's support for the Contras 
during the period of the Boland Amendment, 
although the role of the NSC staff was no 
secret to others. North testified that his oper-
ation was well-known to the press in the 
Soviet Union, Cuba, and Nicaragua. It was 
not a secret from Nicaragua's neighbors,

Executive Summary 
with whom the NSC staff communicated 
throughout the period. It was not a secret 
from the third countries?including a totali-
tarian state?from whom the NSC staff 
sought arms or funds. It was not a secret 
from the private resupply network which 
North recruited and supervised. According 
to North, even Ghorbanifar knew. 
The Administration never sought to hide 
its desire to assist the Contras so long as 
such aid was authorized by statute. On the 
contrary, it wanted the Sandinistas to know 
that the United States supported the Contras. 
After enactment of the Boland Amendment, 
the Administration repeatedly and publicly 
called upon Congress to resume U.S. assist-
ance. Only the NSC staff's Contra support 
activities were kept under wraps. The Com-
mittees believe these actions were concealed 
in order to prevent Congress from learning 
that the Boland Amendment was being cir-
cumvented. 
It was stated on several occasions that the 
confusion, secrecy and deception surround-
ing the aid program for the Nicaraguan free-
dom fighters was produced in part by Con-
gress' shifting positions on Contra aid. 
But Congress' inconsistency mirrored the 
chameleon-like nature of the rationale of-
fered for granting assistance in the first in-
stance. Initially, Congress was told that our 
purpose was simply to interdict the flow of 
weapons from Nicaragua into El Salvador. 
Then Congress was told that our purpose 
was to harrass the Sandinistas to prevent 
them from consolidating their power and ex-
porting their revolution. Eventually, Con-
gress was told that our purpose was to elimi-
nate all foreign forces from Nicaragua, to 
reduce the size of the Sandinista armed 
forces, and to restore the democratic reforms 
pledged by the Sandinistas during the over-
throw of the Somoza regime. 
Congress had cast a skeptical eye upon 
each rationale proffered by the Administra-
tion. It suspected that the Administration's 
true purpose was identical to that of the 
Contras?the overthrow of the Sandinista 
regime itself. Ultimately Congress yielded to 
domestic political pressure to discontinue as-
sistance to the Contras, but Congress was 
unwilling to bear responsibility for the loss 
of Central America to communist military 
and political forces. So Congress compro-
mised, providing in 1985 humanitarian aid to 
the Contras; and the NSC staff provided 
what Congress prohibited: lethal support for 
the Contras. 
Compromise is no excuse for violation of 
law and deceiving Congress. A law is no less 
a law because it is passed by a slender major-
ity, or because Congress is open-minded 
about its reconsideration in the future. 
Privatization 
The NSC staff turned to private parties 
and third countries to do the Government's 
business. Funds denied by Congress were ob-
tained by the Administration from third 
countries and private citizens. Activities nor-
mally conducted by the professional intelli-
gence services?which are accountable to 
Congress?were turned over to Secord and 
Hakim. 
The solicitation of foreign funds by an Ad-
ministration to pursue foreign policy goals 
rejected by Congress is dangerous and im-
proper. Such solicitations, when done secret-
ly and without Congressional authorization, 
create a risk that the foreign country will 
expect and demand something in return. 
McFarlane testified that "any responsible of-
ficial has an obligation to acknowledge that 
every country in the world will see benefit 
to itself by ingratiating itself to the United 
States." North, in fact, proposed rewarding a 
Central American country with foreign as-
sistance funds for facilitating arms shipments 
to the Contras. And Secord, who had once 
been in charge of the U.S. Air Force's for-
eign military sales, said "where there is a 
quid, there is a quo." 
Moreover, under the Constitution only 
Congress can provide funds for the Execu-
tive branch. The Framers intended Con-
gress's "power of the purse" to be one of the 
--principal checks on Executive action. It was 
designed, among other things, to prevent the

Executive Summary 
Executive from involving this country unilat-
erally in a foreign conflict. The Constitution-
al plan does not prohibit a President from 
asking a foreign state, or anyone else, to 
contribute funds to a third party. But it does 
prohibit such solicitation where the United 
States exercises control over their receipt 
and expenditure. By circumventing Con-
gress' power of the purse through third-
country and private contributions to the 
Contras, the Administration undermined a 
cardinal principle of the Constitution. 
Further, by turning to private citizens, the 
NSC staff jeopardized its own objectives. 
Sensitive negotiations were conducted by 
parties with little experience in diplomacy, 
and financial interests of their own. The dip-
lomatic aspect of the mission failed?the 
United States today has no long-term rela-
tionship with Iran and no fewer hostages in 
captivity. But the private financial aspect 
succeeded?Secord and Hakim took $4.4 
million in commissions and used $2.2 million 
more for their personal benefit; in addition, 
they set aside reserves of over $4 million in 
Swiss bank accounts of the Enterprise. 
Covert operations of this Government 
should only be directed and conducted by 
the trained professional services that are ac-
countable to the President and Congress. 
Such operations should never be delegated, 
as they were here, to private citizens in 
order to evade Governmental restrictions. 
Lack of Accountability 
The confusion, deception, and privatiza-
tion which marked the Iran-Contra Affair 
were the inevitable products of an attempt to 
avoid accountability. Congress, the Cabinet, 
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were denied 
information and excluded from the decision-
making process. Democratic procedures 
were disregarded. 
Officials who make public policy must be 
accountable to the public. But the public 
cannot hold officials accountable for policies 
of which the public is unaware. Policies that 
are known can be subjected to the test of 
reason, and mistakes can be corrected after 
16 
consultation with the Congress and delibera-
tion within the Executive branch itself. Poli-
cies that are secret become the private pre-
serve of the few, mistakes are inevitably per-
petuated, and the public loses control over 
Government. That is what happened in the 
Iran-Contra Affair: 
?The President's NSC staff carried out a 
covert action in furtherance of his policy to 
sustain the Contras, but the President said he 
did not know about it. 
?The President's NSC staff secretly di-
verted millions of dollars in profits from the 
Iran arms sales to the Contras, but the Presi-
dent said he did not know about it and Poin-
dexter claimed he did not tell him. 
?The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff was not informed of the Iran arms 
sales, nor was he ever consulted regarding 
the impact of such sales on the Iran-Iraq war 
or on U.S. military readiness. 
?The Secretary of State was not in-
formed of the millions of dollars in Contra 
contributions solicited by the NSC staff from 
foreign governments with which the State 
Department deals each day. 
?Congress was told almost nothing?and 
what it was told was false. 
Deniability replaced accountability. Thus, 
Poindexter justified his decision not to 
inform the President of the diversion on the 
ground that he wanted to give the President 
"deniability." Poindexter said he wanted to 
shield the President from political embarrass-
ment if the diversion became public. 
This kind of thinking is inconsistent with 
democratic governance. "Plausible denial," 
an accepted concept in intelligence activities, 
means structuring an authorized covert oper-
ation so that, if discovered by the party 
against whom it is directed, United States 
involvement may plausibly be denied. That is 
a legitimate feature of authorized covert op-
erations. In no circumstance, however, does 
"plausible denial" mean structuring an oper-
ation so that it may be concealed from?or 
denied to?the highest elected officials of the 
United States Government itself.

Executive Summary 
The very premise of democracy is that 
"we the people" are entitled to make our 
own choices on fundamental policies. But 
freedom of choice is illusory if policies are 
kept, not only from the public, but from its 
elected representatives. 
Intelligence Abuses 
Covert Operations 
As former National Security Adviser 
Robert McFarlane testified, "it is clearly 
unwise to rely on covert action as the core 
of our policy." The Government cannot 
keep a policy secret and still secure the 
public support necessary to sustain it. Yet it 
was precisely because the public would not 
support the Contra policy, and was unlikely 
to favor arms deals with Iran, that the NSC 
staff went underground. This was a perver-
sion of the proper concept of covert oper-
ations: 
?Covert operations should be conducted 
in accordance with strict rules of account-
ability and oversight. In the mid-1970s, in 
response to disclosures of abuses within the 
intelligence community, the Government en-
acted a series of safeguards. Each covert 
action was to be approved personally by the 
President, funded by Congressional appro-
priations, and Congress was to be informed. 
In the Iran-Contra Affair, these rules were 
violated. The President, according to Poin-
dexter, was never informed of the diversion. 
The President says he knew nothing of the 
covert action to support the Contras, or the 
companies funded by non-appropriated 
monies set up by North to carry out that 
support. Congress was not notified of either 
the Iran or the Contra operations. 
?Covert actions should be consistent with 
publicly defined U.S. foreign policy goals. 
Because covert operations are secret by defi-
nition, they are of course not openly debated 
or publicly approved. So long as the policies 
which they further are known, and so long 
as they are conducted in accordance with 
law, covert operations are acceptable. Here, 
however, the Contra covert operation was 
carried out in violation of the country's 
public policy as expressed in the Boland 
Amendment; and the Iran covert operation 
was carried out in violation of the country's 
stated policy against selling arms to Iran or 
making concessions to terrorists. These were 
not covert actions, they were covert policies; 
and covert policies are incompatible with de-
mocracy. 
?Finally, covert operations are intended 
to be kept from foreign powers, not from the 
Congress and responsible Executive agencies 
within the United States Government itself. 
As Clair George, CIA Director of Oper-
ations, testified: "to think that because we 
deal in lies, and overseas we may lie and we 
may do other such things, that therefore that 
gives you some permission, some right or 
some particular reason to operate that way 
with your fellow employees, I would not 
only disagree with tbat I would say it would 
be the destruction of a secret service in a 
democracy." In the Iran-Contra Affair, se-
crecy was used to justify lies to Congress, 
the Attorney General, other Cabinet officers, 
and the CIA. It was used not as a shield 
against our adversaries, but as a weapon 
against our own democratic institutions. 
The NSC Staff 
The NSC staff was created to give the 
President policy advice on major national 
security and foreign policy issues. Here, 
however, it was used to gather intelligence 
and conduct covert operations. This depar-
ture from its proper functions contributed to 
policy failure. 
During the Iran initiative, the NSC staff 
became the principal body both for gather-
ing and coordinating intelligence on Iran and 
for recommending policy to the President. 
The staff relied on Iranians who were inter-
ested only in buying arms, including Ghor-
banifar, whom CIA officials regarded as a 
fabricator. Poindexter, in recommending to 
the President the sale of weapons to Iran, 
gave as one of his reasons that Iraq was 
winning the Gulf war. That assessment was 
contrary to the views of intelligence profes-
sionals at the State Department, the Depart-

Executive Summary 
ment of Defense, and the CIA, who had 
concluded as early as 1983 that Iran was 
winning the war. Casey, who collaborated 
with North and Poindexter on the Iran and 
Contra programs, also tailored intelligence 
reports to the positions he advocated. The 
record shows that the President believed and 
acted on these erroneous reports. 
Secretary Shultz pointed out that the intel-
ligence and policy functions do not mix, be-
cause "it is too tempting to have your analy-
sis on the selection of information that is 
presented favor the policy that you are ad-
vocating." The Committees agree on the 
need to separate the intelligence and policy 
functions. Otherwise, there is too great a risk 
that the interpretation of intelligence will be 
skewed to fit predetermined policy choices. 
In the Iran-Contra Affair, the NSC staff 
not only combined intelligence and policy 
functions, but it became operational and con-
ducted covert operations. As the CIA was 
subjected to greater Congressional scrutiny 
and regulation, a few Administration offi-
cials?including even Director Casey?came 
to believe that the CIA could no longer be 
utilized for daring covert operations. So the 
NSC staff was enlisted to provide assistance 
in covert operations that the CIA could not 
or would not furnish. 
This was a dangerous misuse of the NSC 
staff. When covert operations are conducted 
by those on whom the President relies to 
present policy options, there is no agency in 
government to objectively scrutinize, chal-
lenge and evaluate plans and activities. 
Checks and balances are lost. The high 
policy decisions confronting a President can 
rarely be resolved by the methods and tech-
niques used by experts in the conduct of 
covert operations. Problems of public policy 
must be dealt with through consultation, not 
Poindexter's "compartmentation"; with hon-
esty and confidentiality, not deceit. 
The NSC was created to provide candid 
and comprehensive advice to the President. 
It is the judgment of these Committees that 
the NSC staff should never again engage in 
covert operations. 
18 
Disdain for Law 
In the Iran-Contra Affair, officials viewed 
the law not as setting boundaries for their 
actions, but raising impediments to their 
goals. When the goals and the law collided, 
the law gave way: 
?The covert program of support for the 
Contras evaded the Constitution's most sig-
nificant check on Executive power: the 
President can spend funds on a program only 
if he can convince Congress to appropriate 
the money. 
When Congress enacted the Boland 
Amendment, cutting off funds for the war in 
Nicaragua, Administration officials raised 
funds for the Contras from other sources?
foreign Governments, the Iran arms sales, 
and private individuals; and the NSC staff 
controlled the expenditures of these funds 
through power over the Enterprise. Con-
ducting the covert program in Nicaragua 
with funding from the sale of U.S. Govern-
ment property and contributions raised by 
Government officials was a flagrant violation 
of the Appropriations Clause of the Constitu-
tion. 
?In addition, the covert program of sup-
port for the Contras was an evasion of the 
letter and spirit of the Boland Amendment. 
The President made it clear that while he 
opposed restrictions on military or paramili-
tary assistance to the Contras, he recognized 
that compliance with the law was not op-
tional. "[W]hat I might personally wish or 
what our Government might wish still 
would not justify us violating the law of the 
land," he said in 1983. 
A year later, members of the NSC staff 
were devising ways to continue support and 
direction of Contra activities during the 
period of the Boland Amendment. What was 
previously done by the CIA?and now pro-
hibited by the Boland Amendment?would 
be done instead by the NSC staff. 
The President set the stage by welcoming 
a huge donation for the Contras from a for-
eign Government?a contribution clearly in-
tended to keep the Contras in the field while 
U.S. aid was barred. The NSC staff thereaf-

Executive Summary 
ter solicited other foreign Governments for 
military aid, facilitated the efforts of U.S. 
fundraisers to provide lethal assistance to the 
Contras, and ultimately developed and di-
rected a private network that conducted, in 
North's words, a "full service covert oper-
ation" in support of the Contras. 
This could not have been more contrary 
to the intent of the Boland legislation. 
Numerous other laws were disregarded: 
?North's full-service covert operation 
was a "significant anticipated intelligence ac-
tivity" required to be disclosed to the Intelli-
gence Committees of Congress under Sec-
tion 501 of the National Security Act. No 
such disclosure was made. 
?By Executive order, a covert operation 
requires a personal determination by the 
President before it can be conducted by an 
agency other than the CIA. It requires a 
written Finding before any agency can carry 
it out. In the case of North's full-service 
covert operation in support of the Contras, 
there was no such personal determination 
and no such Finding. In fact, the President 
disclaims any knowledge of this covert 
action. 
?False statements to Congress are felonies 
if made with knowledge and intent. Several 
Administration officials gave statements de-
nying NSC staff activities in support of the 
Contras which North later described in his 
testimony as "false," and "misleading, eva-
sive, and wrong." 
?The application of proceeds from U.S. 
arms sales for the benefit of the Contra war 
effort violated the Boland Amendment's ban 
on U.S. military aid to the Contras, and con-
stituted a misappropriation of Government 
funds derived from the transfer of U.S. prop-
erty. 
?The U.S. Government's approval of the 
pre-Finding 1985 sales by Israel of arms to 
the Government of Iran was inconsistent 
with the Government's obligations under the 
Arms Export Control Act. 
?The testimony to Congress in November 
1986 that the U.S. Government had no con-
temporaneous knowledge of the Israeli ship-
ments, and the shredding of documents relat-
ing to the shipments while a Congressional 
inquiry into those shipments was pending, 
obstructed Congressional investigations. 
?The Administration did not make, and 
clearly intended never to make, disclosure to 
the Intelligence Committees of the Finding?
later destroyed?approving the November 
1985 HAWK shipment, nor did it disclose 
the covert action to which the Finding relat-
ed. 
The Committees make no determination as 
to whether any particular individual in-
volved in the Iran-Contra Affair acted with 
criminal intent or was guilty of any crime. 
That is a matter for the Independent Counsel 
and the courts. But the Committees reject 
any notion that worthy ends justify viola-
tions of law by Government officials; and 
the Committees condemn without reserva-
tion the making of false statements to Con-
gress and the withholding, shredding, and 
alteration of documents relevant to a pend-
ing inquiry. 
Administration officials have, if anything, 
an even greater responsibility than private 
citizens to comply with the law. There is no 
place in Government for law breakers. 
Congress and the President 
The Constitution of the United States 
gives important powers to both the President 
and the Congress in the making of foreign 
policy. The President is the principal archi-
tect of foreign policy in consultation with 
the Congress. The policies of the United 
States cannot succeed unless the President 
and the Congress work together. 
Yet, in the Iran-Contra Affair, Administra-
tion officials holding no elected office re-
peatedly evidenced disrespect for Congress' 
efforts to perform its Constitutional over-
sight role in foreign policy: 
?Poindexter testified, referring to his ef-
forts to keep the covert action in support of 
the Contras from Congress: "I simply did 
not want any outside interference." 
?North testified: "I didn't want to tell 
Congress anything" about this covert action.

Executive Summary 
?Abrams acknowledged in his testimony 
that, unless Members of Congressional Com-
mittees asked "exactly the right question, 
using exactly the right words, they weren't 
going to get the right answers," regarding 
solicitation of third-countries for Contra sup-
port. 
?And numerous other officials made false 
statements to, and misled, the Congress. 
Several witnesses at the hearings stated or 
implied that foreign policy should be left 
solely to the President to do as he chooses, 
arguing that shared powers have no place in 
a dangerous world. But the theory of our 
Constitution is the opposite: policies formed 
through consultation and the democratic 
process are better and wiser than those 
formed without it. Circumvention of Con-
gress is self-defeating, for no foreign policy 
can succeed without the bipartisan support 
of Congress. 
In a system of shared powers, decision-
making requires mutual respect between the 
branches of government. 
The Committees were reminded by Secre-
tary Shultz during the hearings that "trust is 
the coin of the realm." Democratic govern-
ment is not possible without trust between 
the branches of government and between the 
government and the people. Sometimes that 
trust is misplaced and the system falters. But 
for officials to work outside the system be-
cause it does not produce the results they 
seek is a prescription for failure. 
Who Was Responsible 
Who was responsible for the Iran-Contra 
Affair? Part of our mandate was to answer 
that question, not in a legal sense (which is 
the responsibility of the Independent Coun-
sel), but in order to reaffirm that those who 
serve the Government are accountable for 
their actions. Based on our investigation, we 
reach the following conclusions. 
At the operational level, the central figure 
in the Iran-Contra Affair was Lt. Col. 
North, who coordinated all of the activities 
and was involved in all aspects of the secret 
20 
operations. North, however, did not act 
alone. 
North's conduct had the express approval 
of Admiral John Poindexter, first as Deputy 
National Security Adviser, and then as Na-
tional Security Adviser. North also had at 
least the tacit support of Robert McFarlane, 
who served as National Security Adviser 
until December 1985. 
In addition, for reasons cited earlier, we 
believe that the late Director of Central In-
telligence, William Casey, encouraged 
North, gave him direction, and promoted the 
concept of an extra-legal covert organiza-
tion. Casey, for the most part, insulated CIA 
career employees from knowledge of what 
he and the NSC staff were doing. Casey's 
passion for covert operations?dating back 
to his World War II intelligence days?was 
well known. His close relationship with 
North was attested to by several witnesses. 
Further, it was Casey who brought Richard 
Secord into the secret operation, and it was 
Secord who, with Albert Hakim, organized 
the Enterprise. These facts provide strong 
reasons to believe that Casey was involved 
both with the diversion and with the plans 
for an "off-the-shelf' covert capacity. 
The Committees are mindful, however, of 
the fact that the evidence concerning Casey's 
role comes almost solely from North; that 
this evidence, albeit under oath, was used by 
North to exculpate himself; and that Casey 
could not respond. Although North told the 
Committees that Casey knew of the diver-
sion from the start, he told a different story 
to the Attorney General in November 1986, 
as did Casey himself. Only one other wit-
ness, Lt. Col. Robert Earl, testified that he 
had been told by North during Casey's life-
time that Casey knew of the diversion. 
The Attorney General recognized on No-
vember 21, 1986 the need for an inquiry. His 
staff was responsible for finding the diver-
sion memorandum, which the Attorney Gen-
eral promptly made public. But as described 
earlier, his fact-finding inquiry departed from 
standard investigative techniques. The Attor-
ney General saw Director Casey hours after

Executive Summary 
the Attorney General learned of the diver-
sion memorandum, yet he testified that he 
never asked Casey about the diversion. He 
waited two days to speak to Poindexter, 
North's superior, and then did not ask him 
what the President knew. He waited too 
long to seal North's offices. These lapses 
placed a cloud over the Attorney General's 
investigation. 
There is no evidence that the Vice Presi-
dent was aware of the diversion. The Vice 
President attended several meetings on the 
Iran initiative, but none of the participants 
could recall his views. 
The Vice President said he did not know 
of the Contra resupply operation. His Na-
tional Security Adviser, Donald Gregg, was 
told in early August 1986 by a former col-
league that North was running the Contra 
resupply operation, and that ex-associates of 
Edwin Wilson?a well known ex-CIA offi-
cial convicted of selling arms to Libya and 
plotting the murder of his prosecutors?were 
involved in the operation. Gregg testified 
that he did not consider these facts worthy 
of the Vice President's attention and did not 
report them to him, even after the Hasenfus 
airplane was shot down and the Administra-
tion had denied any connection with it. 
The central remaining question is the role 
of the President in the Iran-Contra Affair. 
On this critical point, the shredding of docu-
ments by Poindexter, North, and others, and 
the death of Casey, leave the record incom-
plete. 
As it stands, the President has publicly 
stated that he did not know of the diversion. 
Poindexter testified that he shielded the 
President from knowledge of the diversion. 
North said that he never told the President, 
but assumed that the President knew. Poin-
dexter told North on November 21, 1986 
that he had not informed the President of the 
diversion. Secord testified that North told 
him he had talked with the President about 
the diversion, but North testified that he had 
fabricated this story to bolster Secord's 
morale. 
Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility 
for the events in the Iran-Contra Affair must 
rest with the President. If the President did 
not know what his National Security Advis-
ers were doing, he should have. It is his 
responsibility to communicate unambiguous-
ly to his subordinates that they must keep 
him advised of important actions they take 
for the Administration. The Constitution re-
quires the President to "take care that the 
laws be faithfully executed." This charge en-
compasses a responsibility to leave the mem-
bers of his Administration in no doubt that 
the rule of law governs. 
Members of the NSC staff appeared to 
believe that their actions were consistent 
with the President's desires. It was the Presi-
dent's policy?not an isolated decision by 
North or Poindexter?to sell arms secretly to 
Iran and to maintain the Contras "body and 
soul," the Boland Amendment notwithstand-
ing. To the NSC staff, implementation of 
these policies became the overriding con-
cern. 
Several of the President's advisers pursued 
a covert action to support the Contras in 
disregard of the Boland Amendment and of 
several statutes and Executive orders requir-
ing Congressional notification. Several of 
these same advisers lied, shredded docu-
ments, and covered up their actions. These 
facts have been on the public record for 
months. The actions of those individuals do 
not comport with the notion of a country 
guided by the rule of law. But the President 
has yet to condemn their conduct. 
The President himself told the public that 
the U.S. Government had no connection to 
the Hasenfus airplane. He told the public 
that early reports of arms sales for hostages 
had "no foundation." He told the public that 
the United States had not traded arms for 
hostages. He told the public that the United 
States had not condoned the arms sales by 
Israel to Iran, when in fact he had approved 
them and signed a Finding, later destroyed 
by Poindexter, recording his approval. All of 
these statements by the President were 
wrong.

Executive Summary 
Thus, the question whether the President 
knew of the diversion is not conclusive on 
the issue of his responsibility. The President 
created or at least tolerated an environment 
where those who did know of the diversion 
believed with certainty that they were carry-
ing out the President's policies. 
This same environment enabled a secretary 
who shredded, smuggled, and altered docu-
ments to tell the Committees that "some-
times you have to go above the written 
law;" and it enabled Admiral Poindexter to 
testify that "frankly, we were willing to take 
some risks with the law." It was in such an 
environment that former officials of the NSC 
staff and their private agents could lecture 
the Committees that a "rightful cause" justi-
fies any means, that lying to Congress and 
other officials in the executive branch itself 
is acceptable when the ends are just, and that 
Congress is to blame for passing laws that 
run counter to Administration policy. What 
22 
may aptly be called the "cabal of the zeal-
ots" was in charge. 
In a Constitutional democracy, it is not 
true, as one official maintained, that "when 
you take the King's shilling, you do the 
King's bidding." The idea of monarchy was 
rejected here 200 years ago and since then, 
the law?not any official or ideology?has 
been paramount. For not instilling this pre-
cept in his staff, for failing to take care that 
the law reigned supreme, the President bears 
the responsibility. 
Fifty years ago Supreme Court Justice 
Louis Brandeis observed: "Our Government 
is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For 
good or for ill, it teaches the whole people 
by its example. Crime is contagious. If the 
Government becomes a law-breaker, it 
breeds contempt for law, it invites every 
man to become a law unto himself, it invites 
anarchy." 
The Iran-Contra Affair resulted from a 
failure to heed this message.

Chapter 1 
Introduction: Background on U.S.-Nicaragua 
Relations 
On July 17, 1979, President Anastasio Somoza De-
bayle and his family fled Nicaragua. A civil war that 
had devastated the nation's economy and caused more 
than 130,000 casualties was at an end, as was the 
autocratic and corrupt 43-year rule of the Somoza 
family. But the battle for Nicaragua's future was just 
beginning. 
The United States had long played a role in Nicara-
gua's affairs. Under the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, the 
United States had declared the Western hemisphere, 
including Central America, off-limits to European 
powers. For the rest of the 19th century, U.S. influ-
ence was episodic. An American privateer named 
William Walker briefly seized control of Nicaragua in 
1855, opened its borders to slavery, and appointed 
himself President before he was deposed and execut-
ed. The opening of the Panama Canal, however, in-
creased the strategic importance of Nicaragua to the 
United States in the early 20th century. 
A treaty signed by the United States and Nicaragua 
in 1911 gave the United States an exclusive right of 
intervention in return for the reorganization of Nica-
ragua's finances. One year later, President Taft in-
voked this pact as a basis for dispatching 2,700 Ma-
rines to Nicaragua. The Marines initially arrived at 
the request of a U.S.-supported Nicaraguan President, 
ostensibly to protect American property and citizens. 
They stayed, with one brief intermission, until 1933. 
During this period, Nicaragua was a virtual depend-
ency of the United States. 
From 1927 to 1933, the Marines and the Marine-
trained Nicaraguan National Guard, with General 
Anastasio Somoza Garcia at its head, fought a guerril-
la war against the forces of General Augusto Cesar 
Sandino, who opposed the U.S.-backed Conservative 
Government of Adolfo Diaz. Sandino, whose aim was 
to rid Nicaragua of "U.S. imperialists," became a na-
tional hero to many Nicaraguans during those years; 
the Sandinistas were named after him. When U.S. 
forces withdrew in 1933, Sandino accepted a truce. 
He was shot dead a year later. Many authorities be-
lieve Sandino was killed on direct orders from 
Somoza, who seized power from the civilian govern-
ment in 1936. 
From 1936 to 1979, Anastasio Somoza Garcia and 
then his son, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, ruled Nica-
ragua. The rule of Anastasio Somoza Debayle was 
characterized by corruption; the Somoza family 
owned nearly one-third of all the land and controlled 
much of the country's wealth. 
In 1961, opponents of Somoza formed the National 
Liberation Front (FSLN), popularly known as the 
Sandinistas. This fledgling resistance organization 
drew much of its early support from students. Fidel 
Castro provided some of its initial financial backing. 
Through the early 1970s, the FSLN was a marginal 
group, unable to succeed in its low-level guerrilla war 
or to marshal popular support. 
The 1972 earthquake that devastated the capital 
city of Managua, however, changed the nature of the 
conflict between the rebels and the Government. Fol-
lowing the earthquake, Somoza reaped immense prof-
its from international relief efforts. His show of greed 
in the face of so much suffering was an important fact 
in his loss of support from the growing Nicaraguan 
business and professional classes. Another was his 
grooming of his son, known as Tachito, to inherit his 
position. 
Successive attacks by the FSLN were met by in-
creasingly harsh reprisals by the National Guard. 
Strikes, street protests, and guerrilla raids prompted 
Somoza to order the wholesale shooting of alleged 
peasant collaborators and the clearance of large areas 
of the countryside where opposition fighters found 
sanctuary. Somoza's human rights abuses led the 
Carter Administration in April 1977 to reduce mili-
tary and economic aid to the regime. Six months 
later, the aid was restored after Nicaragua promised 
to curb the excesses of the National Guard. 
Despite Somoza's promises, the situation deteriorat-
ed. In January 1978, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the 
editor of La Prensa, Nicaragua's foremost opposition 
newspaper, was assassinated. His assassins were never 
found, but the public reacted against the Government. 
A wave of protest swept the country. The ranks of 
the FSLN swelled with new recruits. Business, trade, 
and church groups joined the rebellion. 
The FSLN was the only force trained and capable 
of opposing the National Guard. The fact that the 
movement had taken on the rhetorical trappings of a 
leftist insurgency seemed of little consequence to 
Nicaraguans eager to remove Somoza. Following the

Chapter 1 
killing of Chamorro, non-Marxist resistance groups 
began to gather around the FSLN, leading ultimately 
to the creation of the Broad Opposition Front seeking 
to draw all economic classes, ages, and professions. 
By the beginning of 1979, the movement could claim 
the full backing of Cuba, the unqualified support of 
the democracies of Venezuela and Costa Rica, and 
broad sympathy throughout Latin America. 
In February 1979, the State Department announced 
that, because of Somoza's unwillingness to accept a 
negotiated settlement, the United States was recalling 
more than half of its officials in Nicaragua and sus-
pending all new economic and military aid. The end 
of U.S. backing cut the last props of support for the 
Government, and the end of the Somoza dynasty 
came on July 17, 1979. 
The Sandinistas were enormously popular when 
they began their rule. A Provisional Government of 
National Reconstruction was formed to lead the coun-
try. At its head was a five-person directorate com-
posed of Violetta Chamorro (widow of the murdered 
La Prensa editor), Alfonso Robelo, Sergio Ramirez, 
Moises Hassan, and Daniel Ortega. Hassan and 
Ortega came from the militant wing of the Sandinista 
Party. Members of the 18-member cabinet and the 33-
member council were drawn from a broad spectrum 
of Nicaraguan public life. Though Nicaraguans were 
generally satisfied that the new Government repre-
sented the Somoza opposition, the United States was 
not, pointing to Ortega and Hassan as left-wing radi-
cals. 
The Sandinistas Take Over 
The Sandinistas set out to court public favor and 
international support. They promised free elections, a 
free press, free enterprise, an independent judiciary, 
and an end to political oppression. 
Yet, the Sandinistas took over television and radio 
stations and censored the newspaper La Prensa, 
which opposed repression whether by the Sandinistas 
or by Somoza. The Sandinistas forced the two moder-
ate members of Nicaragua's governing council, Cha-
morro and Robelo, to resign, pressured opposition 
parties, continued political detentions, and expropriat-
ed land. The revolutionary party organization as-
sumed the functions of state. On September 19, 1980, 
the Government announced that it would not hold 
national elections until 1985. 
Americans were divided on how to interpret Sandi-
nista intentions. If the Carter Administration did not 
openly embrace the Sandinistas, neither did it close all 
doors to a possible reconciliation. Immediately fol-
lowing the Sandinista victory, the United States do-
nated $39 million in emergency food aid to Nicara-
gua, and in 1980 Congress appropriated an additional 
$75 million in emergency economic assistance (Public 
Law 96-257). Similarly, Washington supported the 
provision of aid to Nicaragua from international lend-
ing organizations. 
The Carter Administration accepted the fact that 
the United States was in "competition" with Cuba to 
win over the Nicaraguan Government, but it hoped 
that friendly relations could be maintained. Yet while 
providing overt financial assistance, President Carter 
in the fall of 1979 signed a Finding authorizing sup-
port to the democratic elements in Nicaragua because 
of the concern about the effect of the Sandinista take-
over on such institutions. 
In public statements, Sandinista officials expressed 
their desire for better relations with the United States, 
and insisted that they had no intention of supporting 
insurgencies aimed at subverting their neighbors. 
Their actions, however, began to raise doubts. Weap-
ons and equipment sent by Cuba through Nicaragua 
were making their way to rebels in El Salvador. 
The new regime received aid from several sources, 
including United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and 
Western Europe. But the United States, the largest 
single contributor, became increasingly concerned 
about the new regime's growing ties with the Eastern 
bloc. Nicaragua increased its number of Cuban advis-
ers, and in 1980 and 1981 signed agreements with the 
Soviet Union and East bloc governments, including 
Bulgaria and East Germany, for advisers and military 
and intelligence assistance. 
Candidate Ronald Reagan stated his firm opposition 
to any further U.S. support for the Sandinistas. In 
January 1981, President Carter suspended aid to the 
Nicaraguan regime. In April 1981, the Reagan Ad-
ministration continued this policy. It announced that 
it would withhold the remaining $15 million in un-
spent U.S. assistance to Nicaragua and not request 
further economic aid until the revolution was democ-
ratized and all assistance to the Salvadoran rebels 
ceased. 
Concerns about Nicaragua's internal repression, its 
growing military force, its ties to the Soviet bloc and 
its support for the Salvadoran insurgency led the Ad-
ministration to consider ways to assist the regime's 
opponents, who came to be known as the Contras. 
The Contras 
As the Sandinistas consolidated their hold on Nicara-
gua in 1979 to 1981, the concerns of the United States 
were matched within Nicaragua itself. In response, a 
new Nicaraguan rebel movement?anti-Sandinista 
"Contras"?emerged.

Chapter 1 
The Contras were not a monolithic group, but a 
combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan 
society: former National Guardsmen and right-wing 
figures who had fought for Somoza and against the 
revolution; anti-Somocistas who had supported the 
revolution but felt betrayed by the Sandinista Govern-
ment; and Nicaraguans who had avoided direct in-
volvement in the revolution but opposed the Sandinis-
tas' increasingly anti-democratic regime. 
Many future Contra leaders fled to exile. Some, like 
Jose Francisco Cardenal, head of the Superior Coun-
cil of Private Enterprise (COSEP), moved to the 
United States, where they began a political campaign 
to win support for their cause in Congress and from 
among the Cuban and Nicaraguan exile communities. 
Other anti-Sandinistas set about organizing a resist-
ance movement in neighboring nations. 
The largest and most active of these groups, which 
later came to be known as the Nicaraguan Democrat-
ic Force (FDN), was led by Adolfo Calero Portocar-
rero. Calero had been an accountant and businessman, 
and had been active in the movement to oust Somoza. 
Following the liberation, he served as the political 
coordinator of the Conservative Democratic Party 
and became an outspoken critic of the Sandinista 
Government. Calero joined the resistance movement 
after his office and home were attacked and he was 
forced into exile. 
Although Calero had opposed Somoza, the FDN 
had its roots in two insurgent groups made up of 
former National Guardsmen who fled Nicaragua after 
the fall of Somoza. In 1981, this branch of the resist-
ance consisted of only a few hundred men. 
Other elements of the anti-Sandinista resistance 
emerged following the failure of members of the Nic-
araguan provisional government to resolve their dif-
ferences over the political direction of the country. 
Increasingly, those who opposed the Sandinistas 
found themselves isolated within the Government. 
The resignation in 1980 of Violetta Chamorro from 
the ruling directorate triggered an exodus of moderate 
leaders from the Government. 
Among those who left were Alfonso Robelo Calle-
jas and Arturo J. Cruz. Robelo had entered politics 
during the two national strikes organized against 
Somoza. In March 1978, he founded the Nicaraguan 
Democratic Movement and was imprisoned by 
Somoza. After his release, he was forced into exile. 
He participated in the post-revolutionary Government 
as the head of his own political party and as an 
opponent of the Sandinista regime. Cruz, who would 
become a prominent Contra leader, was named Nica-
raguan Ambassador to the United States in 1981. He 
resigned 2 years later in protest against Sandinista 
policies, and joined the resistance in 1983. 
In addition to the main force of FDN fighters cen-
tered primarily in the northern portion of the country, 
other resistance forces became active in other parts of 
Nicaragua. These include several Indian groups oper-
ating along the Atlantic coast and, after 1981, a group 
formed by the charismatic figure and former Sandi-
nista guerrilla leader and hero, Eden Pastora. Forces 
under Pastora were based along the southern border 
with Costa Rica. 
Initial support for the Nicaraguan resistance came 
from another country, which organized and supplied 
paramilitary forces in early 1981. By the end of 1981, 
however, the Contras were looking to the United 
States for their support. They were to find a receptive 
audience?President Reagan.

Chapter 2 
The NSC Staff Takes Contra Policy 
Underground 
In December 1981, the President authorized a Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) covert action program to 
support the Contras. The CIA's activity, however, 
did not remain covert for long: within months, it was 
the topic of news reports and the subject of Congres-
sional debate questioning the Administration's policy 
in support of the Contras. The Administration re-
sponded that it did not intend to overthrow the San-
dinista Government in Nicaragua, but sought to check 
the spread of communism to El Salvador and other 
nations in Central America. 
In 1982, in the first Boland Amendment, Congress 
sought to enforce that claim by barring the Adminis-
tration from using Congressionally appropriated 
money for the "purpose" of overthrowing the Sandi-
nista regime. The Administration, although not 
pleased with the amendment, nevertheless accepted it, 
because the amendment allowed the Administration to 
maintain support for the Contras so long as that sup-
port had as its "purpose" stopping the spread of the 
Sandinista revolution outside Nicaragua's borders. 
With the first Boland Amendment, then, came a 
temporary compromise between the Administration 
and Congress. But it was an inherently uneasy com-
promise, based more on semantics than substance: The 
Contras were not in the field to stop Sandinista arms 
flowing to El Salvador; they were in the field to 
overthrow the Sandinistas. The Intelligence Commit-
tees of Congress, while rejecting that objective, nev-
ertheless approved CIA use of contingency reserve 
funding to support the anti-Sandinistas. And the Ad-
ministration embraced the contradiction inherent in 
the new law, by emphasizing that U.S. support was 
aimed only at interdicting arms destined for other 
Central American Communist insurgencies. 
During 1983, press reports of a "secret" CIA war 
in Nicaragua led to increased questioning in Congress. 
In July, the House voted to end all Contra aid. Mean-
while, in the hopes of forestalling an aid cutoff, the 
Administration accepted an invitation by the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence to clarify its inten-
tions in pursuing a covert program. Despite Adminis-
tration efforts to meet those concerns, by the winter, 
the House and Senate had agreed to cap Contra fund-
ing at $24 million, a sum that both the Administration 
and the Congress knew would not last through fiscal 
1984. 
Nonetheless, the Administration decided to escalate 
the operations in Nicaragua. When the Nicaraguan 
harbor mining was disclosed in April, it created a 
storm of protest in Congress and around the country 
and, chiefly as a result, Congress declined to appro-
priate more money for the Contras. With the CIA out 
of funds for the Contras, the NSC staff took over the 
program of supporting the Contras. But this time, the 
operation was covert in a new sense?it was con-
cealed from Congress. 
Beginning in May 1984, when the CIA-appropri-
ated funds for the Contras ran out, the National Secu-
rity Council (NSC) staff raised money for Contra 
military operations from third countries with the 
knowledge of the President, supervised the Contras' 
purchase of weapons, and provided guidance for the 
Contras' military operations. The operational responsi-
bilities fell largely to Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a 
member of the NSC staff who reported to the Nation-
al Security Adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, and his 
deputy, Vice Admiral John M. Poindexter. 
In October 1984, the Congress passed and the 
President signed the second Boland Amendment pro-
hibiting the expenditure of any available funds in sup-
port of Contra military operations by any agency or 
entity involved in intelligence activities. Rather than 
halting U.S. support for the Contras, the CIA's with-
drawal was treated as a call for the NSC staff to take 
over the entire covert operation, raising more money 
from a third country, arranging for arms purchases, 
and providing military intelligence and advice. The 
NSC staff went operational?and underground. 
The December 1981 Finding 
Within 2 months of President Reagan's inauguration, 
the CIA proposed, and the NSC considered, plans for 
covert action to deal with the growing Cuban pres-
ence in Nicaragua. The United States continued to 
recognize the Nicaraguan Government, but diplomat-
ic relations became increasingly adversarial because of 
the Administration's concern that the Sandinistas 
were continuing to receive significant military support

from Cuba, support targeted, in part, for insurgent 
groups beyond Nicaraguan borders.2 
In December 1981, President Reagan signed his 
first Finding specifically authorizing covert paramili-
tary actions against the Sandinista Government in 
Nicaragua.3 Under the law, covert actions may be 
initiated only by a personal decision of the President. 
A Finding is an official document embodying that 
decision. By signing a Finding, a President not only 
authorizes action, but accepts responsibility for its 
consequences. 
Sponsoring the CIA's new covert program in Cen-
tral America was the Director of Central Intelligence, 
William J. Casey. Casey was a veteran of covert 
operations, having served with the Office of Strategic 
Services (OSS), the predecessor to the CIA, during 
the Second World War. In 1945, Casey, just 32 years 
old and a Navy lieutenant, was chief of the Secret 
Intelligence Branch that directed intelligence gather-
ing in German-controlled Europe from OSS head-
quarters in London. 
After the war, Casey became a successful corporate 
lawyer and a wealthy investor, was appointed Chair-
man of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 
later became head of the President's 1980 election 
campaign. Following the 1980 election, Casey was 
named Director of Central Intelligence, the first Di-
rector to enjoy Cabinet rank. Casey was a firm believ-
er in the value of covert operations, and took an 
activist, aggressive approach to his craft. In the words 
of the CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Clair 
George, "Bill Casey was the last great buccaneer 
from OSS."4 
Pastora Defects 
Casey saw the opportunity to make military head-
way against the Sandinistas in early 1982, when rebel 
leader Eden Pastora defected from the ruling Sandi-
nista junta. Pastora appeared to be an ideal candidate 
for Contra military leadership. Known to his follow-
ers by the nom de guerre, "Comandante Zero," he had 
been one of the heroes of the fight against Somoza. 
From 1977 to 1978, he served in the Sandinista Na-
tional Liberation Front and later held several high 
posts in the new Government until his abrupt resigna-
tion in 1981. In April 1982, Pastora organized the 
Sandinista Revolutionary Front (FRS) and declared 
war on the Sandinista Government. 
Although Pastora was a popular, charismatic leader 
with the potential to challenge the Sandinistas, his 
geographic base presented a problem for the Adminis-
tration. He insisted on operating in the southern part 
of Nicaragua. The Administration, however, claimed 
that its only purpose in aiding the Contras was to 
interdict arms flows to El Salvador, which lies to the 
north of Nicaragua. Support for Pastora in the South 
contradicted that claim. 
32 
Casey's deputy, Admiral Bobby R. Inman, an intel-
ligence professional who had headed the National Se-
curity Agency, objected to this broadening of the 
covert program. He believed that it was unsound, and 
unauthorized by the existing Presidential Finding. Yet 
Casey was determined to proceed. Inman retired at 
the end of June 1982 and the CIA supported Pastora 
without any change in the Presidential Finding.6 
A Proposal for a New Finding 
Pastora's rebel group "develop[ed] quickly."6 By 
July 12, 1982, Donald Gregg, then head of the NSC's 
Intelligence Directorate and responsible for all covert 
action projects, proposed a new draft Finding to keep 
pace with Pastora's developing operations. Gregg, 
like Inman, believed that broad support for Pastora 
was outside the scope of the December 1981 Find-
ing.7 He wrote to William Clark, the National Securi-
ty Adviser, that "additional actions not covered by 
previous authority are now being proposed." Those 
"additional actions" included providing "financial and 
material support," training, and arms supply to Pas-
tora's forces.6 The problem with providing that assist-
ance under the December 1981 Finding, as Gregg 
saw it, was that the "rationale" of the earlier Finding 
appeared "to be to have the anti-Sandinista forces 
strike against the Cuban presence in Nicaragua rather 
than attacking the Sandinista units."" 
Vice Admiral Poindexter, then military adviser to 
the National Security Adviser, disagreed. In a hand-
written note, Poindexter stated: "I don't see this really 
needs to be approved since the earlier Finding covers 
it, but maybe it would be good to get a confirmation 
since we now have a better idea as to where we are 
going."11 As drafted by Gregg, the proposed Finding 
provided for CIA paramilitary support to forces 
inside Nicaragua for the purpose of "effect[ing] 
changes in Nicaraguan government policies."12 This 
draft Finding, with its broadly stated goals, was never 
approved by the President. 
Boland I 
By the fall of 1982, press reports told of a growing 
U.S. involvement in Nicaragua." Administration 
spokesmen responded by stating that the U.S. Gov-
ernment was seeking not to overthrow the Nicara-
guan Government, but merely to prevent it from ex-
porting revolution to El Salvador. Aid to the Contras 
was presented as an act in defense of El Salvador, not 
a hostile act against Nicaragua. 
Congress soon began to question this explanation." 
The Contras were in the field for the announced 
purpose of overthrowing the Sandinistas, not simply 
to interdict supplies destined for El Salvador." Con-
gress debated the issue extensively, with some Mem-
bers questioning whether their own Government was 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7

Chapter 2 
violating the charters of both the United Nations and 
the Organization of American States by interfering in 
the internal affairs of Nicaragua." Members voiced 
concern that U.S. support for the Contras was provid-
ing a "convenient pretext" for the Sandinistas to 
impose martial law, suppress freedom of the press, 
stifle religion, and undermine the rights of assembly 
and free elections." Those who supported these 
views called for a complete cutoff of aid to the Con-
tras. 
There was equally strong support in Congress, par-
ticularly in the Senate, for aiding the Contras. Some 
Members believed that the Sandinistas were trying to 
spread a Marxist revolution to neighboring states. 
They argued that no Communist regime had ever 
stepped down or consented to free elections and that 
support for the Contras was necessary to bring about 
democracy in Nicaragua.'8 
Out of this debate emerged an amendment to the 
Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1983, later 
known as Boland I. Introduced by Representative 
Edward P. Boland, the amendment passed the House 
by a vote of 411-0, and was adopted, in December 
1982, by a Conference Committee of the House and 
Senate. This first Boland Amendment prohibited CIA 
use of funds "for the purpose of overthrowing the 
Government of Nicaragua." '9 
The internal contradictions of the Administration's 
announced Nicaragua policy" were carried forward 
in the new law: Congress appropriated funds that 
would be used by the CIA for Contra assistance, but 
at the same time rejected the Contras' objective to 
remove the Sandinista Government. During the floor 
debate on his amendment, Representative Boland indi-
cated that while the Administration did not like his 
proposed restrictions, it would accept them." Con-
gress had not cut Contra funding; it merely had legis-
lated an impermissible purpose. The Administration 
still could maintain support for the Contras and did, 
by relying upon its original justification for Contra 
support?stopping arms flows to El Salvadoran Com-
munist insurgents. 
In December 1982, The New York Times reported 
intelligence officials as saying that Washington's 
"covert activities have. . . become the most ambitious 
paramilitary and political action operation mounted 
by the C.I.A. in nearly a decade. . . ."22 One month 
later, in January 1983, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, ac-
companied by staff of the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, visited Central America to review U.S. intelli-
gence activities related to Nicaragua. His findings, 
supplemented by followup Committee briefings and 
inquiries, revealed that the covert action program was 
"preceding policy," that it was "growing beyond that 
which the Committee had initially understood to be 
its parameters," and that "there was uncertainty in the 
executive branch about U.S. objectives in Nicara-
gua."23 
Questions about compliance with the Boland 
Amendment increased throughout 1983. In March, 37 
House Members sent a letter to the President warning 
that CIA activities in Central America could be vio-
lating the law." In April, news reporters visiting 
Contra base camps wrote that "[t]he U.S.-backed 
secret war against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista 
regime has spilled out of the shadows."" 
Challenged to defend the Administration's compli-
ance with the law, the President asserted in April that 
there had been no violation of the Boland Amend-
ment. There would be none, said the President, be-
cause even a law he disagreed with had to be ob-
served: "We are complying with the law, the Boland 
Amendment, which is the law."" "[VV]hat I might 
personally wish or what our government might wish 
still would not justify us violating the law of the 
land."27 When asked if his Administration was doing 
anything to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua, 
he replied, "No, because that would be violating the 
law."28 
According to some in Congress, the Administration 
was facing a "crisis of confidence" about the legitima-
cy of CIA support for the Contras." The President 
responded with a major address on Central America 
to a joint session of Congress on April 27, 1983. 
Rejecting images of a new Vietnam, the President 
stated: 
But let us be clear as to the American attitude 
toward the Government of Nicaragua. We do not 
seek its overthrow. Our interest is to ensure that 
it does not infect its neighbors through the export 
of subversion and violence. Our purpose, in con-
formity with American and international law, is 
to prevent the flow of arms to El Salvador, Hon-
duras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. 
It soon became clear, however, that the President 
had not made the case for the Administration's 
Contra support policy with either the Congress or the 
American people." He was not helped by the Con-
tras' performance on the ground. The Contras had 
failed to win either popular support or military victo-
ries in Nicaragua and could not, without both, sustain 
public support in the United States." 
The Administration Responds to 
Congressional Unrest: May-
September 1983 
In May 1983, both the House and Senate Select Com-
mittees on Intelligence challenged the Administra-
tion's Nicaragua policy, but in different ways. The 
Senate Intelligence Committee "took the rather un-
usual step of requiring" that "the Administration ar-
ticulate, in a clear and coherent fashion its policy 
33

Chapter 2 
objectives." Before the Committee would vote for 
more aid, it wanted a new Presidential Finding.33 
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelli-
gence, on the other hand, favorably reported a new 
bill, the "Boland-Zablocki" bill, to the full House for 
consideration.34 The bill barred aid for the Nicaragua 
covert action program, but it also took the Adminis-
tration at its word about the need to stop arms flows 
to El Salvador. The legislation provided $80 million 
in assistance to Central American governments to 
stop the flow of arms to rebel groups, but no funds 
for "support of military or paramilitary activities in 
Nicaragua."35 Despite strong Administration opposi-
tion, the House passed the bill on July 28, 1983, by a 
vote of 228195.36 
With its implicit threat of an aid cutoff, the Boland-
Zablocki measure challenged the Administration to 
articulate a plausible rationale for covert aid. The bill 
exposed the loose fit between the Administration's 
announced policy of stopping arms flows to El Salva-
dor and its covert support of the Contras. If the 
Administration really wanted to stop arms flows to El 
Salvador, it could do so directly, said the Congress; 
but if its purpose was to aid the Contras in over-
throwing the Nicaraguan Government, there would 
be no funding.37 
The Administration responded to the threat of an 
aid cutoff in three different ways. First, the Adminis-
tration established a public relations office in the State 
Department attempting to muster the public and Con-
gressional support necessary for the Contras. Second, 
anticipating that a cutoff might nevertheless occur, 
the Administration developed a secret plan to stock-
pile weapons for the Contras at the CIA. Finally, at 
the same time, to satisfy Congressional demands, the 
Administration agreed to draft a new Finding. 
White Propaganda 
In June of 1983, the Administration decided upon a 
new method of trying to win public support for the 
President's policy in Central America. On July 1, 
1983, then National Security Adviser Clark an-
nounced that "the President had decided that the Ad-
ministration must increase our efforts in the public 
diplomacy field to deepen the understanding of the 
support for our policies in Central America."39 
As a result, an office of Public Diplomacy for Latin 
American and the Caribbean (S/LPD) was estab-
lished in the State Department, headed by Otto 
Reich,39 who eventually was given the rank of Am-
bassador.40 The S/LPD was an interagency office 
with personnel contributed by the Department of 
State, the Department of Defense (DOD), the 
Agency for International Development, and the U.S. 
Information Agency. Although created as part of the 
State Department, the office was established at the 
direction of the National Security Council.4' The S/ 
LPD's activities were coordinated by an interagency 
34 
working group staffed by the NSC. The principal 
NSC staff officer was a former senior CIA official. 
With the knowledge and approval of Director Casey, 
he was detailed to the NSC staff for a year. He later 
became Special Assistant to the President with re-
sponsibility for public diplomacy matters. 
The mission of the office?public diplomacy?was 
a "new, non-traditional activity for the United States 
government," according to the State Department. In 
fact, "public diplomacy" turned out to mean public 
relations-lobbying, all at taxpayers' expense. The 
office arranged speaking engagements, published pam-
phlets, and sent materials to editorial writers.42 In its 
campaign to persuade the public and Congress to 
support appropriations for the Contras, the office used 
Government employees and outside contractors?in-
cluding Richard Miller and Francis Gomez who 
would later work with North to provide Contra as-
sistance.4 3 
A Deputy Director of S/LPD, Jonathan Miller, 
reported the office's success in what he labeled a 
"White Propaganda Operation," which sought to 
place op-ed pieces in major papers by secret consult-
ants to the office.44 By Reich's own description, the 
office adopted "a very aggressive posture vis-a-vis a 
sometimes hostile press." It "briefed Members of Con-
gress, reached out to audiences previously over-
looked, found new ways of reaching traditional audi-
ences, and generally did not give the critics of the 
policy any quarter in the debate."45 It claimed that 
lajttacking the President was no longer cost free."'" 
Later, the Comptroller General would find that 
some of the office's efforts, in particular Jonathan 
Miller's "White Propaganda," were "prohibited, 
covert propaganda activities,"47 "beyond the range 
of acceptable agency public information 
activities. . . 2'49 In a September 30, 1987, letter, 
the Comptroller General concluded that S/LPD had 
violated "a restriction on the State Department's 
annual appropriations prohibiting the use of federal 
funds for publicity or propaganda purposes not 
authorized by Congress." 49 
The CIA Tries to Stockpile 
In the summer of 1983, while efforts were under-
way at the State Department to change public opin-
ion, the CIA began secret preparations in the event 
Congress decided to cut off aid to the Contras. In that 
event, the Agency planned to obtain equipment free 
of charge from the DOD. 
On July 12, the President directed that the DOD 
provide enhanced support for the CIA in its efforts to 
assist the Contras.5? One day later, the CIA sent a 
"wish list" to the DOD, requesting that $28 million in 
equipment be transferred to it, "free-of-charge."' 
The list covered everything from medical supplies to 
aircraft, and included a request for personne1.52 The

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 2 
Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed that each of the four 
services carry a quarter of the cost of these trans-
fers.53 The equipment then could be stockpiled by the 
CIA and provided to the Contras if the need arose. 
The CIA would not run afoul of any aid ceiling since 
it had not paid for the equipment. The equipment 
involved had been paid for out of the normal DOD 
budget allocation. In short, money appropriated by 
Congress for one purpose would be used for another, 
bypassing any limits Congress might place on CIA 
appropriations, such as the then-pending Boland-
Zablocki bill.54 
By late summer, the DOD's General Counsel con-
cluded that a nonreimbursable transfer would violate 
the Economy Act, a law requiring that the DOD be 
reimbursed for the cost of interagency transfers.55 
The CIA would have to pay for all items except 
surplus equipment. From the CIA's perspective, this 
defeated the purpose of the plan: to avoid the expend-
iture of CIA funds and shift the cost to the DOD.56 
The project was finally terminated on February 12, 
1985, after the CIA had obtained, without cost, 3 
surplus Cessna aircraft and, at cost, 10 night vision 
goggles, 1 night vision sight, and a Bushmaster 
cannon.57 
The September 1983 Finding: A New 
Rationale for Covert Aid 
Trying to forestall a complete cutoff of Congres-
sional aid, the Administration accepted the Senate 
Intelligence Committee's proposal that it draft a new 
Finding defining and delimiting the purposes of the 
covert program. By August, Director Casey had pre-
sented the Committee with a first draft and later, in 
September, proceeded to "informally discuss the find-
ing with Senator Goldwater and other key Senators 
of the SSCI."58 Within the Administration, the Find-
ing was, as North put it, "thoroughly scrubbed" by 
the State Department and NSC staff as well by as the 
Justice Department and lawyers from DOD and 
CIA." 
On September 16, 1983, at a National Security 
Planning Group (NSPG) meeting, Director Casey 
briefed the President and his advisers from the State 
and Defense Departments on the draft Finding. The 
Director explained that the earlier Finding had been 
"modified to reflect [a] change of objectives. 
No longer was the covert program justified solely by 
the need to curb Cuban support for the Sandinistas or 
to stop arms flows out of Nicaragua. A new, and 
broader, rationale was added: covert aid was intended 
to pressure the Sandinistas to negotiate a treaty with 
nearby countries.6' 
The new Finding also reflected a change of tactics. 
Congress would not accept a Finding broad enough 
to permit paramilitary operations conducted by U. S. 
citizens. The Administration gave its assurances that 
aid for paramilitary operations would be limited to 
third-country nationals." Casey told the President 
that the "new Finding no longer lets us engage in PM 
[paramilitary operations]."63 
Three days later, on September 19, 1983, the Find-
ing was signed.64 The next day, the Intelligence 
Committees received briefings on it. Shortly thereaf-
ter, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to pro-
vide aid for a continued covert operation in Nicara-
gua.65 
The new Finding, however, was not without prob-
lems. The Administration's stated objective in sup-
porting the Contras was now to pressure the Sandinis-
tas into accepting a treaty that had to include free 
elections. If, as the President believed, the Sandinistas 
could not win such an election, they would never 
agree to such a treaty.66 Only the prospect of a 
military defeat would push them toward a negotiating 
posture. Yet, the renunciation of a military victory 
was the price set by Congress for a bipartisan com-
promise. The Finding thus contained within it a para-
dox that would haunt the Administration's Nicaragua 
policy. 
Forcing the Issue: The December 
Funding Cap and Intensifying 
Covert Operations 
One day after the September Finding was briefed to 
the Intelligence Committees, an unnamed Administra-
tion official was quoted in The New York Times 
explaining the rationale of the new Finding: "Yes, we 
are supporting the rebels until the Nicaraguans stop 
their subversion," an "approach," the official urged, 
that "should end the argument over whether the Ad-
ministration was violating its pledge by doing more 
than just stopping the arms flow."67 
But Administration hopes that the September Find-
ing, and its new rationale for covert action, would 
end the debate on Contra aid were quickly dashed. 
Discussions were held on the House floor over the 
advisability of continuing covert aid, and the Presi-
dent took his cause to the public in his radio address-
es. In October, the House voted to halt all aid to 
paramilitary groups fighting the Nicaraguan Govern-
ment." The Senate, however, wanted to continue 
aid. In early December, the House and Senate agreed 
to a compromise: A "cap" of $24 million would be 
placed on Contra funding, and the CIA would be 
barred from using its contingency reserves to make up 
any shortfal1.69 
Congress and the Administration recognized that 
the $24 million appropriation would be insufficient to 
sustain a covert operation through the fiscal year.7? 
Therefore, the door was left open for a future Admin-
istration funding request to carry the program for the 
balance of the year if negotiations for a peace treaty 
were thwarted by the Sandinistas. The President was

Chapter 2 
required to report to Congress by March 15 on the 
steps taken to achieve a negotiated settlement in Cen-
tral America.? 
The Decision to Bring the Situation to a 
Head 
Having survived the threat of a total cutoff of funds 
for the Contras, the Administration decided to intensi-
fy the CIA's covert activities while funding still re-
mained.72 Charged by the new National Security Ad-
viser, Robert McFarlane, to prepare an "in-depth 
review" of the Administration's Central America 
policy,73 a Special Interagency Working Group 
(SIG)74 concluded: "Given the distinct possibility 
that we may be unable to obtain additional funding in 
FY-84 or FY-85, our objective should be to bring the 
Nicaragua situation to a head in 1984." 74a At a Janu-
ary 6 NSPG meeting, the President and his advisers 
concurred in the SIG recommendation: "Our covert 
action program should proceed with stepped up inten-
sity." 7 5 
Even before the decision had been officially ac-
knowledged, plans had been implemented to step-up 
paramilitary operations in Central America. In the 
fall, speedboats carried out attacks against Sandinista 
patrol craft and fuel tanks.76 By November, a more 
heavily armed speedboat had been developed for 
follow-on operations.77 
At the end of December, and thereafter, the mining 
and other operations increased. In early January, the 
CIA proposed attacks against fuel supply depots and 
transmission lines along the "entire Pacific coast of 
Nicaragua."78 On January 7, three magnetic mines 
were placed in Sandino harbor;79 on February 3, an 
air attack destroyed a Sandinista "communications 
and naval arms depot""; and on February 29, more 
mines were placed at Corinto." By March 29, plans 
had been made to support an attack by Eden Pastora 
on San Juan del Norte; it was hoped that the attack 
would result in the installation of a provisional gov-
ernment.8 2 
The Role of Lt. Col. Oliver North 
At the NSC, Lt. Col. Oliver North became the 
liaison with the CIA in its intensified covert effort. A 
graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy, he had distin-
guished himself on the battlefield in Vietnam, winning 
a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts." 
He was assigned to the NSC in October 1981, where 
he quickly established a reputation with his superiors 
as a staffer who could get a job done.84 
North was energetic, articulate, action-oriented, and 
had a reputation for bypassing red tape.85 His superi-
ors could depend on him not only to carry out orders, 
but to keep them informed." North was a prodigious 
writer, often staying in his office until late at night to 
complete lengthy papers or other work.87 
36 
As described by a number of his colleagues, North's 
relationship to McFarlane was very close.88 With 
McFarlane's rise to the position of National Security 
Adviser, North came to play an increasingly large 
role not only in the operational aspects of Contra 
policy, but also in forging that policy. North already 
had contacts in Central America who were pleased 
with his success. On November 7, 1983, John Hull, 
Indiana native, ranch owner in Costa Rica, and 
Contra supporter, wrote that "B.G.," or "blood and 
guts," as North was known, was to have a new boss, 
Robert McFarlane. Hull hoped this would make 
North "more powerful as we need more like him."89 
North became a strong advocate within the NSC 
staff of intensified covert support for the Contras. He 
was the point of contact, transferring information 
from the CIA to the National Security Adviser for 
the President's approval.9? For every significant, and 
sometimes insignificant, operation, he provided a 
memorandum to the National Security Adviser des-
tined for the President. His reports were detailed and 
enthusiastic, his recommendations supportive of fur-
ther operations.9' 
In his new assignment, North looked to Casey for 
guidance. In his words, Director Casey was a "teach-
er or philosophical mentor" of sorts, to whom he 
looked for help and advice on a regular basis.92 "Bill 
Casey was for me a man of immense proportions," 
North testified, "a man whose advice I valued greatly 
and a man whose concern for this country and the 
future of this land were, I thought, on the right 
track." "History," North stated "will bear that 
out."93 
Tension Between the 1983 Finding and 
Intensified Operations 
In a series of memorandums written between Oc-
tober 1983 and March 1984, North recorded the 
CIA's increasing covert presence in the region. Rela-
tively minor operational details were given to the 
President, as on November 4, when North advised 
McFarlane to suggest an increase in the number of 
weapons supplied to the Contras by 3,000. The Presi-
dent approved the recommendation.94 North not only 
sought approval for, but also reported the results of, 
various actions proposed to him by Agency person-
nel. On February 3, he reported a successful attack on 
a Sandinista communications and naval arms depot. 
Admiral Poindexter penned, "Well done," and 
checked North's recommendation that the President 
would be briefed.9 5 
North frequently stated in his memorandums that 
the actions recommended were within the Septem-
ber 1983 Finding. 96Yet, progress toward negotiations 
and success in arms interdiction were not the focus of 
his attention; instead, the destruction of Sandinista

Chapter 2 
subjects of these memorandums. North kept his 
superiors advised of Contra actions that would 
weaken the Sandinista regime, explaining that the 
purpose of the mining and attacks was to enhance 
the Contras' military strength, while "reduc[ing] 
the mobility of Sandinista military units."97 
North could contend that such military activities 
were within the scope of the Finding because of the 
Finding's essential ambiguity: Paramilitary action, 
once authorized, may be used to promote a diplomat-
ic end while at the same time furthering the cause of 
military victory. But by March of 1984, it had 
become clear that the diplomatic end the Finding 
described was not what North anticipated or encour-
aged. In memoranda to McFarlane, he proposed sig-
nificant military actions against the Sandinistas, the 
details of which cannot be disclosed for national secu-
rity reasons, but which give substance to the testimo-
ny of Clair George, CIA Deputy Director for Oper-
ations, that North's ideas were often extreme, 
"crazy," or "hairbrained."98 The memos reveal the 
same enthusiasm for covert paramilitary operations 
that North would later bring to his work as the 
"switching point" for Contra support during the next 
2 years.69 
The Money Begins to Run Out 
By February 1984, the $24 million earmarked by 
Congress for the Contras was being quickly depleted. 
On February 13, North wrote to McFarlane, empha-
sizing the importance of obtaining "relief from the 
$24M ceiling,"1" but recognizing that "[c]ongres-
sional resistance on this issue is formidable": 
[P]rospects for success are bleak even with a 
concerted effort. At some point, we may have to 
reassess our prospects and decide whether pru-
dence requires that we somehow stretch our FY-
84 effort to avoid running out of funds.101 
In a memorandum drafted by North for the President, 
McFarlane concluded that "[u]nless an additional 
$14M [million] is made available, the [Contra aid] 
program will have to be drastically curtailed by May 
or June of this year. 
"102 
The Harbor Mining Disclosures 
In early April, the country learned that the U.S. 
Government was involved in the mining of Nicara-
guan harbors. U.S. Government presence in Nicara-
gua had become "embarrassingly overt."103 As 
McFarlane testified: "The disclosure that harbors had 
been mined in Nicaragua was received very 
badly. . . 104 
Some in Congress believed that the Administration 
had misrepresented the activities it conducted under 
the September 1983 Finding.105 Senator Barry 
Goldwater, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman, 
charged that his Committee Members had been de-
ceived at the very moment they were being asked to 
vote to support Contra aid. "[lit is indefensible on the 
part of the Administration to ask us to back its for-
eign policy when we don't even know what is going 
on," he declared.106 
After initial assertions by Director Casey and the 
National Security Adviser 1?7 that full and detailed 
disclosure had been provided to Congress, the Ad-
ministration decided to end the escalating battle and 
offered a truce. On April 26, Director Casey 
"apologize[d] profoundly," conceding inadequate dis-
closure.'" But the "apology" could not heal the 
"fracture" between Congress and the Administration 
that the mining had created."9 The Administration's 
policy to bring the situation "to a head" had back-
fired: the plan, rather than attracting support, lost it. 
Keeping the Contras Together: 
Spring-Summer 1984 
The Administration's proposal for $21 million in 
supplemental assistance for the Contras now lay in 
doubt as Congress debated the course of U. S. policy 
in Central America. The uproar over the mining inci-
dent made any further appropriation unlikely. Indeed, 
House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, Jr. declared 
that, in his view, the President's funding request was 
"dead." 10 
With or without appropriated funds, the Adminis-
tration planned to continue supporting the Contras. In 
McFarlane's words, the President directed the NSC 
staff to keep the Contras together "body and 
soul."110a In Poindexter's words, the President 
"wanted to be sure that the contras were support-
ed.,,i 
McFarlane assigned this responsibility to North, 
who testified: 
I was given the job of holding them together in 
body and in sou1.112 
To keep them together as a viable political oppo-
sition, to keep them alive in the field, to bridge 
the time between the time when we would have 
no money and the time when the Congress 
would vote again, to keep the effort alive, be-
cause the President committed publicly to go 
back, in his words, again and again and again to 
support the Nicaraguan resistance. '13

Chapter 2 
Tapping Foreign Sources The First 
Efforts 
With the appropriated funds projected to run out in 
May or June, the Contras could be kept together only 
if an alternative source of funding could be found. 
The Administration began to look beyond the U.S. 
Treasury to foreign countries for monetary support. 
As early as February, North drafted a National Secu-
rity Decision Directive recommending "immediate ef-
forts to obtain additional funding of $10-$15 million 
from foreign or domestic sources to make up for the 
fact that the current $24 million appropriation will 
sustain operations only through June 1984."114 While 
McFarlane struck this language from an official pol-
icymaking document,' 15 he quietly pursued the same 
idea. 
Looking to Country 1 for Contra Support 
McFarlane testified that perhaps as early as Febru-
ary 1984, he considered "the possibility of in effect 
farming out the whole contra support operation to 
another country, which would not only provide the 
funding, but give it some direction."' 16 In February 
or March, McFarlane pursued the idea with an offi-
cial from Country 1."7 He inquired whether Country 
1 would have any interest in instructing "the contras 
in basic tactics, maneuver[s], and so forth."8 Coun-
try 1 officials eventually declined the invitation."9 
But McFarlane was not dissuaded from attempting 
a less ambitious plan for third-country support. On 
March 27, McFarlane met with Director Casey and 
proposed a plan to approach third countries, including 
Country 1, for Contra assistance. In a memorandum 
of that date, Casey recounted McFarlane's plan: 
In view of possible difficulties in obtaining sup-
plemental appropriations to carry out the Nicara-
guan covert action project through the remainder 
of this year, I am in full agreement that you 
should explore funding alternatives with [Coun-
try 1] and perhaps others.12? 
Others were not in "full agreement," however, 
about an approach to Country 1. Secretary of State 
George P. Shultz testified that during other discus-
sions within the Administration about third-country 
funding, he questioned the legality and wisdom of any 
third-country approach. Shultz testified that by April 
18, McFarlane knew he (Shultz) felt it was a mistake 
to approach Country 1 for Contra support.'21 
Nevertheless, McFarlane followed through with the 
plan recounted in Director Casey's March 27 memo. 
He directed Howard J. Teicher, the Director of Near 
East Affairs at the NSC, to speak to an official in 
Country l's Ministry of Foreign Affairs about obtain-
ing monetary support. Teicher made the approach, 
but Country 1 declined to be a part of the plan.122 
McFarlane, in a memorandum of April 20, told 
38 
Teicher that he was "disappointed in the outcome but 
we will not raise it further . . . [w]e will not press 
them on the question of assistance to the contras."123 
In May, Secretary Shultz learned of Teicher's ap-
proach from the U. S. Ambassador to Country 1, and 
he confronted McFarlane at the White House.'" Ac-
cording to Shultz, McFarlane told him that Teicher's 
approach to Country 1 was without authorization and 
that Teicher was operating "on his own hook."125 
But Shultz later learned, to the contrary, from his 
Ambassador, that Teicher had made a point of telling 
the Ambassador he was in Country 1 at McFarlane's 
instructions.'" Later, McFarlane told the Commit-
tees that he had directed Teicher to seek a contribu-
tion from Country 1.127 
Looking to Country 6 for Contra Support 
Another third-country funding option considered 
by the CIA during the spring of 1984 was an ap-
proach to Country 6. In his March 27 memorandum, 
Casey indicated that Country 6 officials alreadY had 
been approached and that the initial reaction had been 
favorable.'" Between April 10 and 13, 1984, Duane 
(Dewey) Clarridge, Chief of the Latin American Di-
vision of the CIA Directorate of Operations traveled 
to Country 6.129 While there, CIA Deputy Director 
John N. McMahon, told Clarridge to "hold off" on 
his discussions because of the recent harbor mining 
disclosures.130 Upon his return to the United States, 
Clarridge wrote: 
Current furor here over the Nicaraguan project 
urges that we postpone taking [Country 6] up on 
their offer of assistance. Please express to [Coun-
try 6 official] my deep regret that we must do 
this, at least for the time being, and I fully realize 
that he cannot crank up assistance on a moment's 
notice, should we decide to go forward in the 
future.131 
Clarridge testified that neither Casey's March 27 
memorandum nor the cable traffic (in some cases cap-
tioned, "[Country 6] Assistance to the Nicaraguan 
Project"132), represented CIA efforts to solicit 
Contra assistance from Country 6.133 He conceded 
that the documents showed that, prior to his arrival, 
Country 6 had offered to aid the Contras, and that an 
offer may have been made as early as January 1984 in 
a meeting between Director Casey and a Country 6 
official.'" But before he arrived in Country 6, 
Clarridge testified, "a decision had been taken . . . 
that we would neither ask for any assistance nor 
would we accept any . . . ."136 Clarridge did not 
explain why, if the Country 6 offer of assistance was 
dead before his visit, he urged on his return "we 
postpone taking [Country 6] up on their offer of as-
sistance."136

Chapter 2 
Country 2 Contributes Funds 
By May 1984, the Contras had exhausted the last 
portion of the $24 million Congressional appropriation 
for fiscal 1984. McFarlane testified that possibly as 
early as May,'" he met with the Ambassador from 
Country 2 and explained that it was almost "inevita-
ble that the Administration would fail" to win Con-
gressional support for the Contras.138 According to 
McFarlane, the Ambassador offered to "provide a 
contribution of $1 million per month, ostensibly from 
private funds that would be devoted to?as a humani-
tarian gesture?to sustenance of the Contras through 
the end of the year."1" In his testimony, McFarlane 
denied that any solicitation of Country 2 had oc-
curred, and insisted the Country 2 contribution was 
merely a gift. 140 
After receiving the contribution and informing his 
deputy, Admiral Poindexter, McFarlane charged 
North with the responsibility for arranging the trans-
fer of funds: "[I] asked him to be in touch with the 
contra leaders and to find out where the bank account 
was kept. . . . Lieutenant Colonel North came back 
and provided the name of the bank, its address and 
the contras' account number for the bank in 
Miami. . . ."14' McFarlane communicated this to 
the Ambassador by handing him an index card with 
the account number on it.142 North testified that it 
was McFarlane who asked him "to establish the 
initial resistance account offshore to which money 
was sent by a foreign government."143 
According to McFarlane, the President was in-
formed of the Country 2 contribution shortly after it 
took place. McFarlane placed a note card into the 
President's morning briefing book. He chose this 
method of informing the President of the contribution 
to reduce any chance that others at the President's 
daily briefing might become aware of the funding 
scheme. After the meeting, McFarlane was called in 
to "pick up the note card which," he recalled, "ex-
pressed the President's satisfaction and pleasure that 
this had occurred."144 
McFarlane also testified he informed selected mem-
bers of the executive branch of the funding. "Within a 
day or so," he told Vice President George Bush, and 
at a weekly breakfast with the Secretaries of State 
and Defense, he "drew them aside" and informed 
them that the Contras would be "provided for" until 
the end of the year. Neither Secretary, according to 
McFarlane's testimony, asked the source of the 
funds.145 McFarlane testified that it was "likely" he 
told then-Chief of Staff, James A. Baker III "Mil the 
spring of '84," and that it was "possible" he told then-
Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III of the 
Country 2 contribution.146 McFarlane claimed he did 
not inform Director Casey of the Country 2 fund-
ing.147 
But McFarlane's account was disputed by other 
witnesses. Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberg-
er had no recollection of being so advised by McFar-
lane;148 and Secretary Shultz testified that he was 
told of the contribution for the first time in June 1986 
after Admiral Poindexter became concerned that the 
Secretary of State had not been told of the Country 2 
contribution.149 Baker denied any knowledge of the 
contribution. 50 
The June National Security Planning 
Group Meeting 
On June 25, the National Security Planning Group 
met to consider options for funding the Contras. In 
attendance were the President, Vice President Bush, 
Secretary Shultz, Secretary Weinberger, Director 
Casey, Meese, and McFarlane. Director Casey urged 
the President to seek third-country aid. Secretary 
Shultz responded that Chief of Staff James Baker had 
told him that if the U.S. Government acted as a 
conduit for third-country funding to the Contras, that 
would be an "impeachable offense."" Casey re-
sponded that it was permissible if the plan called for 
direct contributions from third countries to the Con-
tras. Meese recalled that there was an opinion by 
Attorney General William French Smith that provid-
ed authority for such a plan, but also noted that if an 
opinion were sought, Justice Department lawyers 
should be given guidance on what the opinion should 
say. The meeting ended without any firm conclusion. 
McFarlane advised that no one was to do anything 
without the necessary Justice Department opinion. 
Although McFarlane had already secured the contri-
bution from Country 2, neither he nor anyone else 
mentioned it.152 
And although McFarlane had urged those at the 
National Security Planning Group meeting not to do 
anything, that very day North arranged for the trans-
fer of Country 2 funds to Contra leader Adolfo 
Calero. North's notes reveal that on June 25, 1984, he 
told Calero that funds would be transferred "w/in 24 
hrs.," through an offshore account. North issued a 
series of instructions to Calero: "Never let agency 
know of amt, source, or even availability" of the 
funds; "No one in our govt. can be aware"; and 
"Your organization must not be aware."153 
North made these plans to send the Country 2 
funds to Calero despite his apparent knowledge of the 
legal difficulties expressed earlier that day at the Na-
tional Security Planning Group meeting. His notes 
reflect that he was advised of those discussions by 
Clarridge of the CIA. North recorded phrases such as 
"impeachable offense" (presumably referring to Sec-
retary Shultz's remark), and "going to French Smith 
?reading on US seeking alternative funding." The 
note continues: "Seek 3d party funding.91154 
The next day, Director Casey met with Attorney 
General Smith along with members of the Justice 
Department and the CIA legal staff. In a memoran-

Chapter 2 
dum recording the meeting, the CIA's General Coun-
sel, Stanley Sporkin, reported that in response to Di-
rector Casey's question about the "legal limits" of 
funding options, the Attorney General stated: 
that he saw no legal concern if the United States 
Government discussed this matter with other na-
tions so long as it was made clear that they 
would be using their own funds to support the 
Contras and no U.S. appropriated funds would be 
used for this purpose. The Attorney General also 
said that any nation agreeing to supply aid could 
not look to the United States to repay that com-
mitment in the future. The DCI [Director of 
Central Intelligence] made it clear that if there is 
a possibility this option might be used, he would 
advise the CIA oversight committees.155 
The Intelligence Committees were not advised of the 
Country 2 contribution until 1987. 
Providing Support?The Private Network 
With funds available from Country 2, North turned 
to creating a mechanism for providing materiel sup-
port for the Contras. "When we ran out of money," 
North testified, "when people started to look in Nica-
ragua and Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador 
and Costa Rica for some sign of what the Americans 
were really going to do," a decision was made to 
create an infrastructure, what North termed a "covert 
operation" to provide the operational support denied 
by Congress.156 
North testified that, at Casey's suggestion, he 
turned to Retired U.S. Air Force Maj. General Rich-
ard V. Secord: 157 
[I]n 1984, we were approaching the proscriptions 
under Boland, Director Casey and I had had a 
number of discussions. I had made a number of 
trips, and obviously by then I had become much 
more engaged in the support for the resistance. 
Director Casey is the one who had suggested 
General Secord to me as a person who had a 
background in covert operations . . . and was a 
man who, by Director Casey's definition, got 
things done, and who had been poorly treated. 
Those were his words. 
I approached General Secord in 1984 and asked 
that he become engaged in these activities. . . . 
I went back to him again and at some point in 
'84, he agreed to become actively engaged. He 
agreed to establish, and did, private commercial 
entities outside the United States that could help 
carry out these activities.158 It was always 
viewed by myself, by Mr. McFarlane, by Direc-
tor Casey, that these were private commercial 
ventures, private commercial activities 
40 
It was clearly indicated that Mr. McFarlane and 
Admiral Poindexter and in fact almost drawn up 
by Director Casey, how these would be outside 
the U.S. Government, and that I told them right 
from the very beginning that those things that he 
did deserved fair and just compensation.16? 
[I]t was always the intention to make this a self-
sustaining operation and that there always be 
something there which you could reach out and 
grab when you needed it. Director Casey said he 
wanted something you could pull off the shelf 
and use at a moment's notice.'" 
The network, albeit privately run, was created for the 
purpose of pursuing "foreign policy goals." Accord-
ing to North: "It was never envisioned in my mind 
that this would be hidden from the President." 162 
The President has publicly stated that he was kept 
informed of some of the efforts by private citizens to 
aid the Contras.163 Poindexter testified the President 
"knew the contras were being supported . . . by 
third-country funds and by private support 
activity. . . ." 164 There is no evidence, however, to 
suggest that the President was ever informed about an 
"off-the-shelf' covert operation. 
Secord's Initial Role 
General Secord had served in the Air Force until 
1983, when he retired and entered private business. 
During his service in the Air Force, he was involved 
in special operations with the CIA in Laos. From 
1978 to 1981, Secord headed the U.S. Air Force 
International Programs office.155 
In summer 1984, Secord's first assignment from 
North was to assist the Contras in buying weapons 
with the funds sent to Calero by Country 2. In July, 
Secord, accompanied by his associate and former CIA 
operative, Rafael Quintero, met with Calero to dis-
cuss the Contras' need for low-priced weapons. He 
left the meeting with a weapons list.166 Although 
Secord was not an arms dealer, he agreed to act as a 
broker to procure the weapons with his business part-
ner, Albert A. Hakim, a naturalized American of Ira-
nian descent.'" In his testimony, Secord referred to 
the operation that he and Hakim used for Contra 
support as "the Enterprise." 168 
Owen's Role 
North also obtained the assistance of Robert W. 
Owen to act on his behalf with Contra leaders. Owen 
was a private citizen who was a teacher before he 
joined the staff of Senator Dan Quayle in 1982. After 
leaving Senator Quayle's staff in 1983, Owen joined 
Gray & Co., a public relations firm in Washington, 
D. C.199 
In the spring of 1984, while Owen was at Gray & 
Co., a Contra representative approached the firm

Chapter 2 
seeking representation. Owen was asked to contact 
the Nicaraguan Democratic Forces (FDN). He turned 
to North, whom he had met the year before while 
working for Senator Quayle. Owen learned from 
North that the Contras needed money, and they dis-
cussed a plan to set up a group of European proprie-
tary companies to purchase weapons overseas. During 
the discussions, North asked Owen to travel to Cen-
tral America to determine the Contras' requirements 
over the next several months. Owen agreed.'" 
Taking a leave of absence from his firm, Owen 
traveled to Central America in late May or early June 
1984 and met with Contra leaders. He was told, and 
subsequently repeated to North, that the Contras 
"would need $1 million a month, and if they wanted 
to increase in size they would need about a million 
and a half dollars a month." 171 Between October 
1984 and March 1986, Owen made more than seven 
trips to Central America collecting information and 
delivering intelligence and money to the Contras on 
North's behalf. '72 He was given the code name 
"T.C." (The Courier), and in his own words, he 
served as North's "eyes and ears" in Central Amer-
ica.'" 
Boland II 
In the summer of 1984, CIA covert assistance to the 
Contras began to wane as funds were depleted. Mean-
while, legislation?the second Boland Amendment?
that would bar the Agency from future support for 
the Contras had been passed by the House in early 
August. According to McFarlane, as the CIA stepped 
out of the picture, the task of supporting the Contras 
fell to the NSC: "[t]he President had made clear that 
he wanted a job done. The net result was that the job 
fell to the National Security Council staff." 174 
In late August, North traveled to Central America 
to meet with Calero to resolve "immediate operation-
al/logistic problems." McFarlane advised North: "Ex-
ercise absolute 'stealth.' No visible meeting. No press 
awareness of your presence in the area." 175 On Sep-
tember 1, North proposed to McFarlane that he 
obtain a "private donor" for a new helicopter to re-
place one shot down the day before. The National 
Security Adviser penned a note: "I don't think this is 
legal." 176 One month later, on October 9, North 
proposed a National Security Decision Directive call-
ing "for the CIA to provide assistance to the Nicara-
guan Resistance Forces in interdicting Soviet arms 
bound for the FSLN in Managua." Once again, 
McFarlane wrote on the cover sheet: "011ie/Ken [de-
Graffenreid]. 177 pls check w/ CIA legal counsel 
promptly to confirm this is legal . . . 178 
By early October, Congress had adopted the 
Boland Amendment to an omnibus appropriations bill. 
Signed into law by the President on October 12, 1984, 
the bill would later be referred to as Boland II. It 
provided in relevant part: 
During fiscal year 1985, no funds available to the 
Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of 
Defense, or any other agency or entity involved 
in intelligence activities may be obligated or ex-
pended for the purpose or which would have the 
effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, mili-
tary or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by 
any nation, group, organization, movement or 
individual. 
Similar provisions were adopted as parts of the De-
fense and Intelligence Authorization bills. 
While Boland II cut off all funding for the Contras, 
it held out some hope for renewing Contra aid in the 
future by providing that the Administration could 
seek a $14 million appropriation on an expedited basis 
after February 28, 1985. But, even as the bill held out 
a future hope, its sponsors made clear that the law 
was intended to achieve an immediate cutoff of aid. 
As Representative Boland put it, the law "clearly 
ends U.S. support for the war in Nicaragua. Such 
support can only be renewed if the President can 
convince the Congress that this very strict prohibition 
should be overturned." 178 
Poindexter and North, who admitted assisting the 
Contras in their military activities, had a different 
view. Both testified that they did not believe that 
Boland II was applicable to the NSC staff and that 
while the CIA could no longer provide any assistance 
to the Contras, the NSC staff was free to do so.'" 
Poindexter put it succinctly: "I never believed, and 
I don't believe today, that the Boland Amendment 
ever applied to the National Security Council 
staff. . . .,* 181 
Their former superior, Robert McFarlane, was sur-
prised by that view. '82 McFarlane, who denied au-
thorizing the NSC staff to provide military assistance 
to the Contras, maintained that the "Amendment gov-
erned our actions." 183 In "cutting off money for the 
Contras," he understood Congress to say "we don't 
want any money raised for the Contras." McFarlane 
testified that he repeatedly addressed the NSC staff 
with "a kind of litany of mine, . . . [not to] 'solicit, 
encourage, coerce, or broker'" financial contributions 
for the Contras.'" According to McFarlane, he spe-
cifically told North to "stay within the law and to be 
particularly careful not to be associated with or take 
part in any fundraising activities." 185 He dismissed 
his instruction to North to keep the Contras "together 
body and soul" as meaning nothing more than "smoke 
and mirrors." 186 What he intended North to provide 
was only moral and political, not military, support.'" 
North and Poindexter both denied hearing 
McFarlane's warnings against solicitation and en-
treaties to observe the law.'88 Both claimed that they 
were acting within their legal rights in aiding the

Contras. North stated that all of his acts were author-
ized by his superiors,'" and Poindexter, speaking as 
one of those superiors, confirmed that he had given 
North a "broad charter" to support the Contras and 
had "authorized in general" North's actions in carry-
ing out that charter.'" McFarlane testified he was 
unaware of the breadth of North's activities.'91 
In any case, Poindexter and North were not de-
terred by Boland II in assisting the Contras. Thus, 
after the Boland Amendment passed, Poindexter ex-
plained to McFarlane his Nicaraguan strategy for the 
future: "continue active negotiations but agree on no 
treaty and agree to work out some way to support the 
Contras either directly or indirectly. Withhold true 
objectives from staffs." 192 
Indeed, Boland II was a spur to action. The CIA 
had to withdraw from supporting the Contras and, 
according to North, this meant he "was the only 
person left talking to them." 193 As North put it: 
"The U.S. contact with the Nicaraguan resistance was 
me, and I turned to others to help carry out that 
activity." 194 Poindexter saw it the same way: 
Very frankly, we were willing to take some risks 
in order to keep the Contras alive, as I said, until 
we could eventually win the legislative battle. 
So for all intents and purposes, Colonel North 
largely took over the?much of the activity that 
[the] CIA had been doing prior to their being 
prohibited from carrying [on] activity because of 
the Boland Amendment.195 
As Poindexter summed up North's role, "[O]nce the 
CIA was restricted," North was the "switching point 
that made the whole system work. . . the kingpin to 
the Central American opposition . . . ." 196 
Boland II did not deter North?it simply reinforced 
the need to keep what he was doing secret from 
Congress, the public, and others in the Government. 
The CIA support of the Contras had not been kept 
from Congress?it was openly debated on the floor 
and was funded by appropriations. With Boland II, 
the assistance?now handled by the NSC staff?went 
underground. 
Contra Aid Fall 1984 to Winter 
1985 
Boland II did not cause any immediate crisis for the 
Contras. Steps taken months before ensured their sur-
vival. As McFarlane testified, "[T]here wasn't any 
need" for funds at the time.'" The $1 million-a-
month pledged by Country 2 in June 1984 would 
"bridge the gap" at least until December. And as 
North testified, by the time the Boland Amendment 
was passed, "General Secord had been engaged and 
money had started to flow to the Nicaraguan Resist-
ance from outside sources." 199

Arms Shipments Begin and Blowpipes 
Are Sought 
While Secord undertook to procure weapons, 
North remained heavily involved. Calero testified that 
he consulted with North regarding weapons needs 
and purchases 199 and North's notebooks confirm 
this.299 
In the fall, the Contras' most pressing need was 
ground-to-air missiles. The Sandinistas had just ob-
tained Soviet-designed HIND-D helicopters, sophisti-
cated assault helicopters. North devoted his efforts to 
finding a missile capable of shooting them down. 
North learned in December 1984 that Blowpipe 
missiles were available in a Latin American country 
and, on his advice, Calero visited the country to ne-
gotiate for their purchase."' On December 17, 
Calero reported back to North that the Latin Ameri-
can country was willing to donate Blowpipes provid-
ed that Calero bought eight launchers for 
$200,000.202 Permission was required and North tried 
to get that permission, recommending to McFarlane 
that the President take it up directly with the perti-
nent head of state.2" McFarlane denied he ever 
asked "the President to intercede with any person for 
the obtaining of Blowpipes for the Contras." 204 In 
any event, permission was not secured and on January 
3, 1985, Calero reported to North that the "Blow 
Pipe deal is off." 205 North would try the following 
year to revive it. 
In the meantime, Secord had located ground-to-air 
missiles in Country 4. But in December, North 
learned that Secord was having difficulty in arranging 
their shipment to the Contras. North asked Gaston 
Sigur, an NSC consultant and expert in Far Eastern 
Affairs, to set up a meeting in Washington between a 
representative of the originating country, Country 4, 
and North.2" At the meeting, North told the Coun-
try 4 official that the missiles were going to the 
Contras, not to the Central American country identi-
fied in the official documents.207 North said that 
while he was "actually seeking to facilitate the trans-
portation" of the missiles, he hoped that he could 
persuade Country 4 to donate them.2" Ultimately, 
Country 4 agreed to sell the missiles to the Contras. 
North sent McFarlane and Poindexter a memoran-
dum reporting on the meeting. Although McFarlane 
could not recall the memorandum, he testified that it 
would likely have prompted him to ask "Admiral 
Poindexter to find out what was going on . . . and 
how his [North's] actions squared with the law." 
McFarlane did not recall how his questions were re-
solved.2" North testified that McFarlane and Poin-
dexter approved the meeting with the Country 4 rep-
resentative described in his memo.2" 
Meanwhile, the Contras were also running out of 
basic weapons. According to Secord, in November, 
Secord, using money provided by Calero, made a

Chapter 2 
downpayment on a shipment of arms which was to 
come by sea from the Far East. But the shipment was 
delayed and, in fact, it would not arrive until the 
spring of 1985.2" 
To make the first arms shipment, the Enterprise 
needed an end-user certificate (EUC)?a document 
certifying that the arms were for the exclusive use of 
the country to which the arms were being sent. The 
Contras could not issue end-user certificates because 
they were not a recognized government. Thus, false 
certificates had to be procured for the Enterprise, and 
again it fell to North to arrange their procurement. 
By the end of January, he was engaged in the task. 
He wrote in his notebooks: "Mtg. w/ Adolfo 
[Calero]-. . . . [Central American Leader] re: EUC for 
M-79 Rounds. [Leader of Central American country] 
turned down." 212 "Private mtg. w/ [U.S. Ambassador 
to a Central American country], offline items?EUC-
$5000 M-79 Rds." 213 By early February, there was 
urgency in the request: Second met with North and 
told him that he "need[ed] to get a bunch of EUC's 
from [Country 14] NOW for next shipment." 214 By 
February 14, 1985, North had the end-user certificates, 
and Secord was able to ship more than 90,000 pounds 
of East European munitions by chartered aircraft from 
Defex, a European arms dealer, to a Central American 
country for the Contras.215 
Providing Intelligence and Military 
Advice 
North's role was not limited to assisting arms pur-
chases. On direction from McFarlane, he gave politi-
cal advice to the Contras on unifying the different 
factions and adopting a platform recognizing human 
rights and pledging a pluralistic society.216 Even 
more critical for the Contras, North provided military 
intelligence and advice. 
The CIA and the DOD could not provide military 
intelligence directly to the Contras, so North provid-
ed it himself. North would obtain maps and other 
intelligence on the Sandinista positions from the CIA 
and DOD, ostensibly for his own use.217 North 
would then pass the intelligence to the Contras using 
Owen as a courier.215 North explained the reasons 
for this system: 
Q: Did you believe that you were complying 
with Boland when you took intelligence from the 
CIA and passed it to the Contras through Robert 
Owen? 
A: Yes. And the intelligence that I passed myself 
personally, and it wasn't all from the CIA, much 
of it came from the Department of Defense. 
Q: And did you understand at the time that the 
CIA and the Department of Defense couldn't 
pass that intelligence directly? 
A: Exactly. 
Q: And you believed that it was compliance with 
Boland, that it was fulfilling the purposes of 
Boland for you to take the intelligence from the 
CIA or the Department of Defense and pass it to 
the Contras? That is what you are saying? 
A: I am not saying that it was fulfilling the pur-
poses of Boland. I am saying it was working 
around the problem that Boland would have cre-
ated in trying to comply with Boland that al-
lowed me to do that.219 
Director Casey was eager to keep the CIA bu-
reaucracy insulated from North's activities in support-
ing the Contras. Indeed, in November, Casey com-
plained to Poindexter that North was conducting his 
support activities "indiscreetly," 220 and had disclosed 
to CIA officials that he was raising funds for, and 
providing intelligence to, the Contras.221 
Learning of the complaint, North wrote McFarlane 
on November 7, 1984, to defend his behavior. North 
insisted he had not implicated the Chief of the CIA's 
Central American Task Force in his Contra support 
activities. "Clarifying who said what to whom," 
North acknowledged that he had passed intelligence 
to Calero to assist him in destroying the Sandinistas' 
newly acquired HIND-D helicopters. North stated 
that he had gone to both the CIA and to the DOD 
for information on the helicopters' location and 
passed this on to Calero.222 
North denied, however, that he had disclosed his 
purpose to the Chief of the Central American Task 
Force, or advised him about the "financial arrange-
ments of the FDN." 223 In fact, the memo recounts a 
conversation showing that North misled the Task 
Force Chief, telling him that the intelligence request 
had been "a fall out of the CPPG [the Crisis Pre-
Planning Group]," and that he (North) had no idea 
where the Contras were obtaining their funding. In 
the memorandum, North reported that he encouraged 
the Task Force Chief's impression that the funding 
had been obtained from "outside" sources.224 
McFarlane testified that he did not authorize North 
to pass intelligence to the Contras and if, as the memo 
indicated, North had passed that information to 
Calero, Boland II would had been violated.225 North 
admitted that he had provided the intelligence but 
maintained that Boland II did not "prevent the trans-
fer of basic intelligence information to the Con-
tras." 226 
In early February 1985, North became concerned 
about a shipment of weapons bound for the Sandinis-
tas aboard the ship, the Monimbo. In a memorandum 
to McFarlane and Poindexter, North recommended 
the vessel be seized or sunk: 
If asked, Calero would be willing to finance the 
operation. He does not, however, have sufficient 
numbers of trained maritime special operations 
43

Chapter 2 
personnel or a method of delivery for seizing the 
ship on the high seas. . . . If time does not permit 
a special operation [on the high seas] . . . Calero 
can quickly be provided with the maritime assets 
required to sink the vessel before it can reach 
port at Corinto. He is in contact with maritime 
operations experts and purveyors of materiel nec-
essary to conduct such an operation.227 
North asked McFarlane for authorization to provide 
Calero "with the information on Monimbo" and for 
permission to approach him "on the matter of seizing 
or sinking the ship." 228 
This time, Admiral Poindexter raised a legal ques-
tion, but only to advise McFarlane about how North's 
recommendation should be handled. On the bottom of 
the memorandum, Poindexter agreed with North that, 
"We need to take action to make sure ship does not 
arrive in Nicaragua. JP."229 But in a cover note to 
McFarlane, Admiral Poindexter wrote: 
Except for the prohibition of the intelligence 
community doing anything to assist the Freedom 
Fighters I would readily recommend I bring this 
up to CPPG [Crisis Pre-Planning Group] at 2:00 
today. Of course we could discuss it from the 
standpoint of keeping the arms away from Nica-
ragua without any involvement of Calero and 
Freedom Fighters. What do you think?230 
No action was taken on North's recommendation to 
seize the Monimbo. 
In addition to providing intelligence, North also 
secured the logistical assistance of a paramilitary op-
erations expert. He described those efforts in the same 
December 4 memorandum to McFarlane in which he 
had outlined his intervention with Country 4 to 
secure surface-to-air missiles. According to the memo, 
Secretary of the Navy John Lehman had suggested to 
North that he meet with David Walker, a former 
British SAS officer, to discuss the services Walker's 
company could provide. North met with Walker, and 
proposed to McFarlane that Walker: 
establish[ ] an arrangement with the FDN for 
certain special operations expertise aimed particu-
larly at destroying HIND helicopters. . . . Unless 
otherwise directed, Walker will be introduced to 
Calero and efforts will be made to defray the 
cost of operations from other than Calero's limit-
ed assets.231 
In his testimony, North confirmed that he had ar-
ranged for Walker to "provide operational support 
for certain activities in the region," and that Walker 
was paid either by the Contras or Secord. This step, 
according to North, was approved by Poindexter or 
McFarlane.232 McFarlane testified that he referred 
North's memo on the subject to Poindexter,233 and 
44 
Poindexter said that, if asked, he would have ap-
proved North's actions.234 
Three months later, Walker provided two techni-
cians to help carry out a military operation in Nicara-
gua. North testified that he was involved in the oper-
ation.235 A subsequent PROF note confirms Walker's 
role.236 
Singlaub Efforts with Countries 3 and 5 
Country 2 had pledged funds only through the end 
of 1984. Therefore, by the end of the year, an urgent 
need existed to find money for the Contras to contin-
ue into 1985. 
In late November 1984, North approved the efforts 
of Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub to 
obtain funds from third countries to support the Con-
tras.237 Singlaub met in Washington with officials of 
Country 3 and Country 5 to request aid. Singlaub was 
blunt about the Contras' needs: bullets, guns, and anti-
aircraft missiles. The foreign country officials, howev-
er, expressed concern about running afoul of "Con-
gress by openly defying the Boland Amendment." At 
the same time they were willing to help "if this could 
be done in a way that did not attract attention." They 
agreed to send Singlaub's request to their respective 
governments.236 
On November 28, Singlaub reported to North the 
reaction of the officials of Countries 3 and 5, inform-
ing him he "was prepared to go and meet with senior 
officials in those governments." According to Sing-
laub, North concurred and gave the plan "his bless-
ing. . . . [I]t was a good idea, he saw no objec-
tion . . ." 239 
Whether North was authorized to "bless" Sing-
laub's efforts is a matter of conflicting testimony. Ac-
cording to McFarlane, to solicit or facilitate aid from 
a third country was barred by the Boland Amend-
ment and he did not authorize North to pursue fund-
ing from third countries.24? But according to North, 
he believed McFarlane had approved: "he was aware 
of each and every one of [my] actions to obtain 
money from foreign countries and approved of it. 
"241 
North defended his actions, testifying that Country 3 
had offered to make a contribution;242 he had never 
made any "solicitation" because that would be an 
improper act for a Government officia1.243 
Singlaub followed up on his request, travelling to 
Countries 3 and 5 in January. He met with highly 
placed officials and reiterated his earlier request for 
military donations to the Contras.244 Singlaub provid-
ed the officials with an index card bearing the name 
of the bank and account number, under Calero's con-
trol, where the funds could be deposited directly.245 
Singlaub told the officials he was a private citizen, but 
wanted to make it clear he was not an "unguided 
missile ricocheting around to that part of 
the world." 246 He expressed the belief that "it 
would be possible. . . to have someone in the Admin-

Chapter 2 
istration send a signal to them. . . to indicate that [he] 
. . . was not operating entirely on [his] . . . own, 
without the knowledge of the Administration."247 
On February 1, 1985, North's notes reflect that 
Singlaub called North and told him that Country 3 
needed a signal that the Administration would be 
"greatly pleased" by a donation before Country 3 
would be willing to contribute.248 On February 6, 
North wrote McFarlane and reported that: "Singlaub 
will be here to see me tomorrow. With your permis-
sion, I will ask him to approach [the Country 3 and 5] 
Embass[ies] urging that they proceed with their offer. 
Singlaub would then put Calero in direct contact with 
each of these officers. No White House/NSC solicita-
tion would be made."243 McFarlane made no re-
sponse on the memo to North's recommendations.2" 
Singlaub testified that he returned to Washington 
on February 7, met with North to report his results, 
and recounted his "entire presentation."2" He rec-
ommended that now was the time for a U.S. Govern-
ment representative to send a signal to Countries 3 
and 5. According to Singlaub's testimony, North re-
sponded that he would "brief his superiors," and 
eventually told him (Singlaub) that he had informed 
his superior, whom Singlaub assumed to be McFar-
lane.252 
Countries 3 and 5 did not contribute any money as 
a result of Singlaub's efforts. Not until late 1985, after 
a signal was in fact given by an NSC official, did 
Country 3 make a contribution.263 
Country 2 Makes an Additional 
Contribution 
With the Contras running out of funds, McFarlane 
turned once more to Country 2. McFarlane made the 
initial approach to its Ambassador for more funds. He 
testified that he did not "solicit" funds because the 
Boland Amendment prohibited such solicitation. He 
merely told the Ambassador of the plight of the Con-
tras and hoped for a contribution.264 According to 
Secord, North asked him to follow up on McFarlane's 
initial meeting.255 
Secord testified that he did in fact follow up with 
the Ambassador, with whom he "had dealt. . . in the 
past with respect to possible contributions to the Con-
tras." When Secord raised the subject, the Ambassa-
dor responded curtly, "You can stop twisting my arm 
. . . . I have decided to take it up with the head of 
state."266 McFarlane did not recall Secord's involve-
ment. 257 
In early February 1985, Country 2 agreed to con-
tribute an additional $24 million.268 McFarlane in-
formed the President of the contribution by placing a 
note card in the President's daily briefing book. The 
President again reacted with "gratitude and satisfac-
tion," expressing no surprise.263 Unknown to McFar-
lane, the Country 2 head of state had already in-
formed the President directly of the new contribution. 
But the President did not mention this when he 
briefed the Secretary of State and McFarlane on his 
meeting with the government leader.26? 
Nor did McFarlane tell the Secretary of De-
fense.26' Both Secretary Weinberger and General 
John W. Vessey, Jr., the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, learned of the contribution from other 
sources.262 Secretary Shultz, who dealt regularly 
with Country 2, was not told of the contribution until 
June 1986.263 This was an omission "not of conscious 
choice," according to McFarlane.264 
The new donation from Country 2, like its prede-
cessor, was sent to Calero's accounts. Between June 
1984 and March 1985, Country 2's contributions, to-
taling $32 million, were virtually the only funds the 
Contras had. 265 
Contra Aid: Winter-Spring 1985 
The Administration Returns to Congress 
When the President signed the Boland Amendment, 
he made it clear he would return to Congress for 
additional Contra support: 
I sincerely regret the inability of the Congress to 
resolve the issue of continuing certain activities in 
Nicaragua . . . . I am signing this act with every 
expectation that shortly after the next Congress 
convenes it will provide adequate support for 
programs to assist the development of democracy 
in Central America. 266 
In the winter of 1985, the Administration pinned its 
hopes on obtaining the $14 million in aid held out by 
the Boland legislation. The law provided for expedit-
ed consideration of such a request after February 28, 
1985, if the President certified to Congress that Nica-
ragua was supporting other Central American com-
munist insurgencies. McFarlane conveyed to his staff, 
in particular to North and Donald R. Fortier, then 
Senior Director for Policy Development, the Presi-
dent's "strong wish that we not break faith with the 
Contras. . . . [We need] to do everything possible to 
reverse the course of the Congress, and get the fund-
ing renewed," he said. "[T]he mission was to win the 
vote the next time . . .?"267 
The chances for success were dim from the start. 
The new Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, David Durenberger, had warned publicly that 
he would oppose both the release of the $14 million 
and any future Contra aid.268 But the President had 
not given up. He told a group of reporters, "We're 
going to do our best."269 
Defense Secretary Weinberger called for an updat-
ed legislative strategy and new funding alternatives to 
win the battle in Congress.27? White House officials 
considered a number of legislative proposals including 
third-country assistance and/or the supply of non-

Chapter 2 
lethal aid coupled with third-country lethal assist-
271 Legislative strategy groups met to consider 
the proposals. McFarlane, accompanied by North, 
traveled to Central America to gauge the reaction of 
leaders in the region. Donald Fortier was dispatched 
to Capitol Hill to assess Congressional sentiment.272 
While North assisted in drafting various legislative 
proposals, his preferred option was to seek Congres-
sional approval for sufficient sums to fund an in-
creased covert action program "adequate to achieve 
victory."273 North understood that foreign contribu-
tions would ensure Contra survival, but success could 
only be achieved with increased funding: 
[R]esources available to the resistance from sym-
pathetic government(s) and/or individuals will 
permit current small-scale operations to continue 
for at least another 6 to 8 months. A resumption 
of USG funding or additional alternative re-
sources would be essential in order to bring the 
scale of activity to that which existed in the 
spring of 1984 and, over time, to prevent an 
erosion of the will and determination of the FDN 
combatants.274 
North was optimistic that "[w]ith adequate support 
the resistance could be in Managua by the end of 
1985.,, 275 
Any legislative proposal for increased aid depended 
upon the Contras' survival in the field. McFarlane 
testified he told North that "unless the Contras 
become a credible military force, they would never 
gain political support in Congress and among the 
American people."278 North was counting on the En-
terprise to provide the support necessary to maintain 
the Contras as a viable force. 
The Weapons Shipments from the 
Enterprise Continue 
In the spring of 1985, two weapons shipments ar-
ranged by Secord in consultation with North and 
Calero would finally reach the Contras: first, in Feb-
ruary, a planeload of 90,000 pounds of munitions from 
Europe and, second, in the spring, a sealift. Both 
shipments were arranged through Transworld Arma-
ment, and both apparently required end-user certifi-
cates.2" 
North needed the cooperation of Central American 
countries to provide documentation and to receive the 
shipments for the Contras. On March 5, 1985, he 
proposed that one country be rewarded for its assis-
tance. In a memorandum to McFarlane, North sug-
gested that the Secretaries of State and Defense and 
Chairman Vessey of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be asked 
to grant the Central American country additional se-
curity assistance. 278 
The "real purpose" of this memo, North explained, 
was to: 
46 
find a way by which we can compensate [Coun-
try 14] for the extraordinary assistance they are 
providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. At 
Tab II are end-user certificates which [Country 
14] provided for the purchase of nearly $8M 
worth of munitions to be delivered to the 
FDN.27? 
In the attached memorandum to Weinberger, Shultz, 
and Vessey, drafted by North, the real purpose 
behind the request was not stated. The memorandum 
contained no reference to the end-user certificates, "to 
the arrangements which have been made for support-
ing the resistance through [Country 14],"280 or to the 
Country 14 munitions "wish list" North attached for 
McFarlane's information.281 Instead, the request for 
aid was predicated on its merits. 
McFarlane testified that he recommended that the 
Cabinet approve increased assistance based solely on 
his assessment of Country 14's need, without taking 
into account its support of the Contras.282 North 
testified that he had not promised a "quid pro quo." 
There was no "need" to make such a promise to a 
country threatened by the Sandinista presence, he 
said. 283 
Disbursements to Other Contra Leaders 
During the winter and spring of 1985, North decid-
ed to use the money sent directly to Calero from 
Country 2 to support other Contra leaders. To do 
this, funds were withdrawn from Calero's account 
using traveler's checks, and hand-carried to North. 
North stored the checks in his safe. Additional cash 
was secured from Secord.284 
North testified that the idea for maintaining this 
fund came from Director Casey:285 
My recollection is that the very first traveler's 
checks came either very late '84 or certainly 
early 1985 and that the sum total of traveler's 
checks was probably in excess of $100,000 or 
thereabouts. 
I also had cash which I estimated to be some-
where in the neighborhood of 50 to 75 thousand 
dollars in cash, so we are talking about an oper-
ational account that went from somewhere 
around 150 to 175 thousand dollars. At various 
points in time there would be considerable sums 
in it and at various points in time there would be 
none in it. 
My recollection is that I got the traveler's checks 
in packages of less than $10,000. I understand 
that others have remembered elsewise, but that is 
how I remember it. 
Those funds were used to support the operations 
that we were conducting. They were used to

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 2 
support the covert operation in Nicaragua, and 
then eventually were used to support other ac-
tivities as well. 
The fact that I had those funds available was 
known to Mr. McFarlane, to Admiral Poin-
dexter, to Director Casey, and eventually to Ad-
miral Art Moreau over at the Pentagon. It also 
came to be known to others, some of whom you 
have had testimony here.286 
* * a * * 
What is important that you realize is that meticu-
lous records were kept on all of this. I kept a 
detailed account of every single penny that came 
into that account and that left that account. All 
of the transactions were recorded on a ledger 
that Director Casey gave me for that purpose. 
Every time I got a group of traveler's checks in, 
I would report them, and I would report them 
when they went out, even going so far as to 
record the traveler's check numbers themselves. 
The ledger for this operational account was 
given to me by Director Casey, and when he 
told me to do so, I destroyed it because it had 
within it the details of every single person who 
had been supported by this fund, the addresses, 
their names, and placed them at extraordinary 
risk.287 
Poindexter testified that he knew of the account 
almost from the start, in 1984: 
[lit was associated with the first contribution of 
Country 2, I think it came to my attention, by 
Colonel North reporting to me, that Mr. Calero 
had provided some funds to him, and it was my 
understanding it was cash, at least that's my 
recollection of my understanding.288 
Poindexter "didn't see anything illegal about it," but, 
as he testified, "any time you handle cash there are 
perception problems that can certainly develop . . . . 
And so I told Colonel North he should get rid of the 
money by returning it or whatever, that I didn't think 
that was a good idea."288 In fact, the money was 
instead funneled to various Contra leaders throughout 
1985 and 1986. 
One of the principal beneficiaries of North's fund 
was a Resistance leader. With McFarlane's approval, 
North decided to assume support for the Resistance 
leader, using funds drawn from the Calero ac-
count.2" North assured McFarlane that Casey had 
been told that North would maintain contact with the 
Contra leader." Later, though, North reported that 
"the CIA will not be told of the new source for 
[Resistance leader's] funds."262 
By February 27, 1985, "Adolfo [Calero] ha[d] 
agreed to provide Ethel requisite funds in the blind 
without [the] [Resistance leader] becoming aware of 
the source."2" Eventually, Calero was to "deposit 
$6,250 per month in [Resistance leader's] checking 
account without [his] knowledge [of the source]."294 
But before the direct deposit mechanism could be put 
into operation, North enlisted Robert Owen and Jona-
than Miller, then-Deputy Coordinator for Public Di-
plomacy at the State Department, to pass the money 
to the Resistance leader. Sometime in early March, 
North handed Owen and Miller traveler's checks 
from his office safe, and requested that the checks be 
cashed. Miller and Owen did so, and returned to 
North's office. Later that day, at his apartment, Owen 
passed $6,000 to $7,000 in cash to the Resistance 
leader.295 
Owen handled a number of transfers to Contra 
leaders. He testified that he paid "[s]omewhere be-
tween six and ten" Contra leaders, and the total 
amount paid was "[s]omewhere around $30,000."2" 
On March 22, 1985, for example, Owen traveled to 
Central America carrying several thousand dollars in 
cash or traveler's checks for delivery to a Contra 
leader.287 In some cases, Owen's efforts did not take 
him far from the White House itself. In April, for 
example, he waited outside the Old Executive Office 
Building in the rain. A car drove up, and Owen 
passed cash to a Nicaraguan Indian leader sitting 
inside.2" These payments had a number of purposes: 
One payment was made to an Indian leader as a "quid 
pro quo" for ceasing negotiations with the Sandinistas 
and joining instead with other Indian leaders to 
"work together in a united front."2" 
Keeping the Operation Secret 
North provided the logistical and funding assistance 
the Contras needed to keep going in Central America 
at the same time that he worked to keep their cause 
alive in Washington. To persuade Congress to vote 
for renewed aid, it was critical that the NSC staff's 
Contra assistance remain secret. As North warned 
Calero: "Too much is becoming known by too many 
people. We need to make sure that this new financing 
does not become known. The Congress must believe 
that there continues to be an urgent need for fund-
North actively cultivated an image of Contra self-
sufficiency within the Administration. For example, 
he urged the CIA's Chief of the Central American 
Task Force to reject the State Department's opinion 
that the Resistance had become largely ineffective 
since U.S. funding ran out in May 1984. "I told [the 
Chief of the Central American Task Force]," wrote 
North, "that it was important that the SNIE [Special 
National Intelligence Estimate] reflect the fact that 
there was substantial outside support which had con-
tinued for some months and showed no signs of abat-
ing.,930i

Chapter 2 
But even without such active encouragement, the 
secrecy shrouding North's efforts contributed to the 
appearance of Contra self-sufficiency. As funds ar-
rived and weapons were shipped, CIA intelligence 
reports confirmed that the Contras remained not only 
a viable force, but were surviving on their own, with-
out apparent U.S. Government assistance. By March, 
close to a year after U.S. Government aid had ceased, 
Director Casey's subordinates provided Casey with 
briefing materials, reporting surprise at the Contras' 
survival, but noting there was little intelligence on 
how the Contras had managed to flourish: 
Since the cutoff of official funds to the anti-San-
dinistas in May 1984 they have been able to field 
a viable guerrilla fighting force, have increased 
their numbers, and improved their tactical effi-
ciency. It is estimated that to maintain the level 
of activity that they have it would cost an esti-
mated one and one half to two million dollars per 
month. There is, however, no intelligence on the 
source of this income, except that it comes from 
private groups, and possibly some U.S. business 
corporations.30 2 
The secret of North's involvement, however, was 
not to last. North's name had begun to appear periodi-
cally in the press along with that of Singlaub. By 
March, Singlaub already had become something of a 
"lightning rod" in the press, attracting attention as a 
private fundraiser for the Contras.303 According to 
Singlaub, North told him that his frequent visits to 
the NSC were a source of concern.304 But North 
"understood and agreed" that Singlaub had to keep a 
"high profile" in order to raise funds, and he support-
ed the effort. If Singlaub "had high visibility, [he] 
might be the lightning rod and take the attention 
away from [North] and others who were involved in 
the covert side of support." 3 ? 5 
Covert Operation and Legislative 
Strategy Intertwine 
While maintaining the secrecy of his Contra support 
activities, North worked to promote a legislative 
strategy that would change both the Congressional 
and the public perception of the Nicaraguan 
threat.306 In March, he and Donald Fortier spon-
sored an elaborate plan calling for lobbying, a media 
blitz, and culminating in almost daily Presidential 
speeches and phone calls in support of the initiative. 
At its most ambitious stage, the plan included a 10-
page, day-by-day chronology to describe each of the 
players' appointed tasks.30 7 
At the same time, North proposed a "Fallback 
Plan," should Congress refuse to provide aid or lift 
the Boland Amendment restrictions.3" In a memo-
randum to McFarlane, North noted that the Contras 
had sufficient funding for munitions to carry them 
48 
through October 1, 1985, but they needed money for 
the following year.3" The fallback plan, sent to 
McFarlane on March 16, called for Country 2, de-
scribed as the "current donor," to contribute an addi-
tional $25 million to $30 million to the Resistance for 
the purchase of arms and munitions; for the President 
to appeal to the public for contributions instead of 
seeking a Congressional appropriation; and for a tax-
exempt foundation to be established to receive the 
contributions. McFarlane rejected the idea of the 
Presidential appeal, expressed doubt about seeking 
more money from Country 2, and approved the estab-
lishment of a tax-exempt foundation." ? 
With McFarlane ruling out a return to Country 2, a 
return to Congress was the Administration's only 
hope for renewed Contra funding. During March 
1985, North focused his attention on the elaborate 
legislative strategy plan he had been working on since 
late February. The plan was developed in conjunction 
with a peace initiative drafted by North in a Miami 
hotel room with FDN head Adolfo Calero and other 
Contra leaders, which became known as the San Jose 
Declaration. North arranged the deadline for a Sandi-
nista response to the peace plan to coincide with the 
vote by Congress. If the Sandinistas rejected the over-
ture, as North anticipated, then "special operations 
against highly visible military targets in Nicaragua," 
were timed to follow in the hopes that successful and 
"visible" Contra military activities might favorably 
influence Congress's decision on Contra aid.3" 
At the last minute, however, the Administration 
considered delaying the submission of the Administra-
tion's new aid request to Congress.312 North recog-
nized that if the vote were delayed, the Contras' 
planned military operations would not serve as an 
effective tool in influencing Congress's decision on 
the aid proposal. He strongly recommended to 
McFarlane that the vote take place as originally 
scheduled. He wrote: 
The deadline for substantive negotiations . . . was 
carefully chosen to ensure that the internal oppo-
sition would have a specific date for their own 
planning purposes. Military operations were 
planned based on the expiration of the offer on 
April 20. . . . [A]n attack is scheduled for April 
25. Based on my request Calero has agreed to 
postpone the attack for five days. The force 
which is being inserted to conduct this operation 
cannot be logistically supported in this area after 
May 5. The resupply situation will require that 
they be withdrawn after that date. 
* * * 
It is my belief that urging the resistance leaders 
(particularly Calero) to accept a major delay . . . 
will result in a breakdown of the unity we have 
achieved. [Calero] has only cooperated to date in

in the U.S. Government who have supported the 
movement since October 1984?North and 
McFarlane.313 
The Administration Responds to 
Congressional Defeat 
In early April, the Administration submitted a Contra 
aid proposal to the Congress, along with its own 
peace plan modeled on the San Jose Declaration. The 
President pledged that lethal aid would only be pro-
vided if the Sandinistas rejected the proposal. The 
plan provoked controversy, and on April 23, the 
House rejected the Administration's proposal. 
When the House rejected the bill, the President's 
first step was to reassure Central American leaders 
that he had not given up on Contra aid. As to one 
country, the President had special cause for concern: 
A military leader had seized ammunition intended for 
the Contras. The President telephoned the head of 
state and received an assurance that the ammunition 
would be delivered to the Contras.3" 
Publicly, the President expressed his determination 
"to return to the Congress again and again." 313 Soon 
after the House defeat, the Administration was back 
on Capitol Hill hoping to mold a compromise in sup-
port of nonlethal aid. 
Meanwhile, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega 
traveled to the Soviet Union and throughout Europe, 
seeking renewed assistance for the Sandinista forces. 
President Ortega's visit to Moscow prompted the 
President to issue a warning to Congress: 
And whatever way they may want to frame it, 
the opponents in the Congress of ours, who have 
opposed our trying to continue helping those 
people, they really are voting to have a totalitar-
ian Marxist-Leninist government here in the 
Americas, and there's no way for them to dis-
guise it. So, we're not going to give up.3" 
President Ortega's Moscow trip also prompted a 
renewed sense in Congress that something had to be 
done to support the Contras. With strong support 
from Congressional leaders, President Reagan an-
nounced the imposition of economic sanctions against 
Nicaragua on May 1, 1985.3'7 
Maintaining the Covert Operation 
Before the Congress rejected the Administration's aid 
proposal, North was optimistic about the Contras' 
prospects. In an early April 1985 memo to McFar-
lane, North explained what the operation had 
achieved up to that point, and the plans he had for its 
future.3" Based on information provided by Calero, 
North outlined what the Contras had spent "since 
USG funding expired in May 1984."3" Of the "grand 
total" of $24.5 million received by Calero, 
"$17,145,594 has been expended for arms,32? muni-
tions, combat operations, and support activities."321 
Extolling the FDN's nearly twofold increase in size, 
and its newly acquired expertise in guerrilla warfare, 
North emphasized that the money had been spent 
wisely: "In short, the FDN has well used the funds 
provided and has become an effective guerrilla army 
in less than a year."322 
The image of Contra military capability cultivated 
by North was arguably at odds with reality. U.S. 
Army General Paul F. Gorman, Commander of the 
Southern Command from May 1983 through Febru-
ary 1985, told the Committees that "the prospects of 
the Nicaraguan resistance succeeding [were] dim at 
best." Specifically referring to Congressional testimo-
ny he gave in June and December 1985, Gorman 
testified: 
what I was saying in those days was that I did 
not see in the Nicaraguan resistance a combina-
tion of forces that could lead to the overthrow of 
the government or the unseating of the Sandinis-
tas. . . . The training of the Contras was, when I 
last saw them in 1985, abysmal. . . . I didn't 
regard them as a very effective military organiza-
tion, based on what I could see in reflections of 
battles, in communications on both sides. The 
Sandinistas could wipe them out. 
Regarding North's reaction to his views, Gorman 
added: 
Oliver was terribly concerned about my attitude, 
and he knew that I was travelling up here on the 
Hill and in other circles where I was being asked 
to comment on the prospects of these people. 
Q: I take it Colonel North, who had been your 
friend . . . was not pleased with the position you 
were taking? 
A: No. . . . I made a speech over at the National 
Defense University which was reported in the 
Washington Post . . . and Oliver . . . got very 
exercised because in it I said . . . I can't see any 
amount of money or any amount of time, given 
the present set of conditions, that would be effi-
cacious. . . . Oliver got very exercised about that 
and called me and said would you try to put to-
gether an op ed piece . . . which he allegedly was 
going to get placed in the Washington Post. It 
never was, and I gather it's because what I wrote 
displeased him. 
Gorman concluded by telling the Committees, "it was 
also very clear to me, he [North] saw me as a prob-
lem in terms of what I was saying, and I think he was 
just doing his damndest to get me to shut up?old 
General, put a cork in it."323 
In the spring, North had made ambitious plans for 
the Contras' future, according to his April 11 memo. 
The force would be increased in size. Two special

operations were planned: an "attack against Sandino 
airport with the purpose of destroying" Sandinista 
HIND-D helicopters; and a "ground operation against 
the mines complex" in Nicaragua securing the princi-
pal lines of communication in and out of Puerto Cabe-
zas. Finally, North told McFarlane the Contras 
would open a Southern front.324 
These plans were soon stalled, though, when in late 
April, Congress rejected the Administration's funding 
request. The defeat precipitated a crisis atmosphere 
among Contra leaders, who had planned on renewed 
Congressional funding. There were daily contacts be-
tween Contra leaders and North, and between North 
and the CIA Chief of the Central American Task 
Force. The problems of the Resistance were further 
complicated when one Central American country, re-
sponding to Sandinista encroachment, ordered the 
Contras to move to less exposed locations.325 
Meanwhile, in Congress, a consensus was building 
in favor of humanitarian aid. By May 15, 1985, Con-
gressional leaders were seeking counsel from the NSC 
on the Administration's position about a Contra sup-
port bill that was limited to nonlethal aid. North, 
along with other NSC staff members, drafted talking 
points for a meeting between McFarlane and Minority 
Leader Robert H. Michel, emphasizing that the "pri-
mary goal" was to lift the Boland Amendment restric-
tions, "which severely limit our ability to support/ 
advise the now unified Nicaraguan resistance."326 
By the end of May, North was optimistic that the 
Boland Amendment restrictions would be lifted, at 
least with respect to the CIA's provision of intelli-
gence and political support. But even if they were 
lifted, and Congress appropriated humanitarian aid, 
North did not contemplate that his covert operation 
would end. He told McFarlane in a May 31 memo: 
Plans are underway to transition from current 
arrangements to a consultative capacity by the 
CIA for all political matters and intelligence, 
once Congressional approval is granted on lifting 
Section 8066 [Boland Amendment] restrictions. 
The only portion of current activity which will 
be sustained as it has since last June, will be the 
delivery of lethal supplies.327 
The Secord Group and Its 
Competition 
As humanitarian aid measures were debated in Con-
gress, Secord's Enterprise was continuing to procure 
weapons for the Contras. By May, Secord was using 
Thomas G. Clines, rather than the original broker. 
Clines' source was a European arms dealer.325 
Secord was also using Rafael Quintero to handle the 
logistics of the arms deliveries in Central America. As 
North put it, Quintero was the "Secord man on [the] 
scene."329 He coordinated the arms reception in Cen-
tral America, and "all of the liaison with the Contras 
and with the local authorities."33? From Quintero, 
Secord would obtain the information necessary to 
50 
provide North with what North termed "views from 
on [the] scene" in Central America.331 Clines, Quin-
tero, and Secord were to play an increasingly large 
role in the Contra support structure as the summer 
progressed. 
During May, Secord arranged through Clines for 
the third in a series of arms transfers to the Contras. 
This time, the shipment was to arrive by sea.332 Peri-
odically, Secord would call North with the latest 
update, as on May 8: "Came out of mtg/ in . . . now 
in Paris; -Tested every item; -ship arrived 4-5 hours 
ago; -40,000 M-79 . . . ."333 Later, on May 24, North 
recorded: "Call from Dick; -Vessel needs shipping 
agent for receiving; -Need to do long lead plan for 
Aug-Sep delivery; -need to make deposit for M-79 
buy."334 As Secord testified, North "was in the infor-
mation collection business" and "[h]e wanted to know 
if I would provide him with details of any deliveries 
or deals that were made, and I did so gladly."335 
General Secord was not the only weapons dealer 
seeking the Contra account during the summer of 
1985. For example, Ronald Martin, a Miami arms 
dealer, was by May "setting up [a] munitions 'super-
market'" in Central America.336 As North testified: 
"You had a very competitive environment down 
there. Once the U.S. Government withdrew in '84 
from directly supporting the resistance, you ended up 
with a lot of folks out there running a very cutthroat 
business."337 
North discouraged Calero from dealing with some 
of Secord's competitors. He testified that CIA Direc-
tor Casey had suspicions that the arms warehouse 
operation run by Martin was supported by U.S. fund-
ing that had been diverted to Martin by a Central 
American country. According to North, Casey told 
him "that there shouldn't be any further transactions 
with that broker until such time as he resolved or 
they were able to resolve where" the money to stock-
pile "several millions of dollars worth of ordnance" 
had come from.338 
Secord's other competitor for procuring arms for 
the Contras during the spring of 1985 was General 
Singlaub. As early as April, Singlaub had begun to 
arrange for a major weapons purchase, after meeting 
at FDN base camps in March with the FDN military 
commander, Enrique Bermudez.339 The list of weap-
ons Singlaub drew up with Bermudez included AK-47 
rifles, RPG-7 rocket launchers, light machine guns, 
and SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. Singlaub took the 
weapons list to North, who made "some additions and 
subtractions." North and Singlaub "reach[ed] a clear-
cut statement of what we were going to buy.',340 
Sometime later that month, Singlaub introduced 
Calero to a European arms dealer.34' Calero was 
astonished at the low prices he had been quoted; "at 
least in the case of the AK-47s that price was about 
half of what we had previously had to pay.91342 (In 
part, this can be attributed to the fact that Singlaub 
did not take a commission.)

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 2 
According to Singlaub, North later confirmed that 
the prices quoted by the European arms dealer were 
lower than anything he had ever seen before. Con-
fronted with the price list, North "expressed some 
surprise, doubt, that they could be purchased for that 
price." But, he "made it quite clear that that was a 
very, very good price and a bargain. We were getting 
twice as many weapons for the same amount of 
money."343 In his testimony, North maintained that 
he checked Secord's prices against the prices of other 
dealers: "[s]ome were higher, some were lower."344 
Part of the explanation for the difference between 
Secord's prices and those of Singlaub's dealer was 
Secord's profit margin?a margin of which Calero 
was unaware. Secord testified that his markup on all 
Contra shipments "averaged out almost exactly 20 
percent."345 In fact, the actual commission charged 
on the cost of arms averaged 38 percent.346 
In Secord's own words: 
By the way, this was a strict commercial kind of 
transaction. There was nothing spooky about it. 
It was just a normal brokering deal. The prices 
were marked up in the process, different markups 
for different line items depending upon the size, 
but between 20 and 30 percent was the markup 
which is quite low in the arms business.347 
Secord candidly admitted that he was to make a 
profit:348 
Q: I take it from what you are saying that you 
were to make a profit on these arms transactions? 
A: Yes . . . . It was intended that the profits 
generated would be shared by Hakim, myself, 
and, of course, the arms dealer.349 
Calero testified he was unaware that Secord was 
earning money off the arms sales. He believed that 
Secord was supplying the weapons at cost.35? "My 
understanding, right from the beginning, was that he 
was not making a profit," Calero recalled.351 North, 
on the other hand, testified that it was his understand-
ing from his conversations with Casey in 1984 that 
those running the off-the-shelf covert entities were 
entitled to fair compensation:352 "The arrangement 
that I made with General Secord starting in 1984 
recognized that those who were supporting our effort 
were certainly deserving of just and fair and reasona-
ble compensation." 3 5 3 
Calero Tries Singlaub 
In early May, Calero and Singlaub met with Secord 
in North's office to discuss procuring SA-7 mis-
siles.354 Although Singlaub's price was lower than 
Secord's, North and Calero decided that Secord 
should supply the missiles because Secord was pre-
pared to provide training and Singlaub was not.355 
Sometime in mid-May, Calero placed an order for 
weapons?other than SA-7s?through Singlaub's 
dealer. Calero "preferred" dealing with Singlaub, 
rather than Secord, because not only was Singlaub a 
closer personal friend, but also his prices were lower. 
Singlaub told Calero that he believed Secord was 
making a profit. Secord, on the other hand, told 
Calero that Singlaub would be unable to deliver: 
"The price was so, you know, so low that he thought 
he [Singlaub] couldn't make, he couldn't do it. Yes, he 
[Secord] told me that, yes."356 
North's notes reflect an unsuccessful attempt to per-
suade Calero not to deal with Singlaub via the Euro-
pean arms dealer.357 On May 17, Secord met with 
North and discussed pending weapons transactions, 
including Martin's munitions supermarket and the 
"Singlaub deal w/ A.C; -[European arms 
dealer] . . . .; - 10K AK47s; -procuring items from 
USSR . . ." 358 An hour and 20 minutes later, North 
spoke to Calero and noted, "will stop move w/ [Europe-
an arms dealer]." 359 But despite Calero's apparent 
decision to stop the Singlaub deal, Secord informed 
North on May 20 that it "[s]ounded like Calero was 
going to have to go through with [the European arms 
dealer] purchase." 369 
North appears to attribute to Director Casey his 
reluctance to procure arms through the European 
dealer. According to North, Casey warned him of "a 
transaction of some five to six million dollars from a 
broker who he was concerned had also been involved 
in reverse technology transfer to the Eastern Bloc, 
and he told me to do everything possible to discour-
age further purchases."361 Although North did not 
name the dealer, his reference to a "transaction of 
some five to six million dollars" points to the Europe-
an arms dealer. The arms dealer denied to the Com-
mittees any involvement in reverse technology trans-
fers.3 6 2 
The purchase that Singlaub arranged did in fact go 
forward after Owen, at North's request, confirmed 
the list with Calero. The arms arrived in Central 
America on July 8, 1985.3 6 3 
This was the last shipment Calero was to order 
from Singlaub or any arms dealer other than Secord. 
The Singlaub shipment had nearly exhausted the 
funds in Calero's own accounts. Calero told North in 
May, "[I] have enough to cover this [shipment] but 
[it] will leave nothing." 3 6 Thereafter, money raised 
by North and Secord was given directly to Secord, 
who then provided the Contras with arms. Calero 
testified he was "never given a reason" why his "au-
thority to have cash directly sent to [him] to make 
those purchases in the future was taken away."365

House that, in the interest of U.S. foreign relations, certain 
foreign nations which were approached or enlisted for 
Contra aid would not be referred to by name. Accordingly, 
those countries were given numerical designations.

119. The idea that Country 1 might fund U. S. ventures in 
Central America was not a new one for McFarlane. In the 
spring of 1983, he learned that Country 1 might be willing 
to provide security assistance and agricultural training to 
other countries. In a note to Oliver North recounting this 
offer, McFarlane mused that since the U. S. appropriation 
to Country 1 increased every year, perhaps it would be 
willing to sign over the increase for use in Central America.

raising additional funds. In the March 27 memorandum, he 
indicated that two initiatives already were underway at the 
CIA to provide the Contras with weapons and other materi-
als: one involved an arrangement with Country 1, and the 
other involved an approach to Country 6. Neither effort 
produced any significant Contra assistance. Id., C7490.

North's notes show that the arrangements were made by 
June 25. On June 24, he noted "call to RCM re arrange-
ments" and on June 25 he noted that he had told Calero the 
funds were on their way. North Notebook, 6/24/84, 
Q0338; id., 6/25/84, Q0340. Bank records show the pay-
ment was actually received in Calero's account on July 6,

There is some evidence that Secord may have been in-
volved in another covert operation prior to the Contra 
project. In an Apr. 27, 1984, notebook entry, North relates 
what appears to be an arms deal with Country 1 ("Team to 
[Country 1] $54 million worth of arms"). Later the note 
states: "McFarlane talked to [Country 1 official] Can't 
produce $; similar to Secord arrangement; 65 lift vans; 
$750K." North Notebook, 4/27/84, Q0228 (emphasis

As recounted by North, Casey's plan mirrored the sugges-
tions of others. It was about this time that Robert Owen, 
who would become North's courier, provided him with a 
plan for "setting up proprietary companies . . . to purchase 
goods overseas and provide assistance to the contras."

freedom fighters in Nicaragua. . . . Arm them and abandon 
them on a party line vote. No food, no medicine, no ammu-
nition, not even moral support. We barely leave them a

by, Singlaub; and (3) a diversion from the proceeds of an 
upcoming arms sale to Country 3 (so that no disbursement 
would then be reflected on Country 3's books). Singlaub

Chapter 3 
The Enterprise Assumes Control of Contra 
Support 
In the summer of 1985, Congress voted to appropriate 
$27 million for the Contras' humanitarian needs, in-
cluding food, medicine and clothing. At the same 
time, the covert program, run by the National Securi-
ty Council (NSC) staff, entered a new and bolder 
phase. With the Contras' daily living needs taken care 
of by Congress, and their requirements for arms 
having been met through Country 2's prior donations, 
the NSC staff was able to focus on attempting to 
improve the Contras' military effectiveness. This in-
volved establishing an air resupply program for the 
main Contra fighting force operating in the North of 
Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), 
and promoting the opening of a second Contra front 
in the South of Nicaragua by supporting other Contra 
fighters, independent of the FDN, who were operat-
ing there. This support for the southern forces includ-
ed the procurement of arms as well as the establish-
ment of an air resupply program. 
Disappointed at the failure of Adolfo Calero to 
develop a logistics infrastructure, Lt. Col. Oliver 
North asked Gen. Richard Secord and his associates 
to assume new responsibilities that under the Boland 
Amendment the U.S. Government could not under-
take. Secord agreed to continue to handle all future 
weapons procurement for the Contras and to acquire 
and operate a small fleet of planes to make air drops 
of weapons, ammunition, and other supplies to the 
Contras in both northern and southern Nicaragua. 
North arranged the funding for Secord to carry out 
these activities, directing third-country and private 
contributions to Secord that previously went to 
Calero. These funds were later augmented by the 
diversion from the Iranian arms sales that North, with 
Admiral John Poindexter's approval, initiated. 
Financed by contributions and the diversion, the 
Secord group purchased and operated five airplanes, 
built an emergency airstrip in Costa Rica, maintained 
an air maintenance facility and a warehouse in an-
other Central American country, and hired pilots and 
crew to fly the air drop missions. They also pur-
chased weapons and ammunition in Europe and deliv-
ered them to Central America for use by the Contras 
in the south and north. North called the organization 
"Project Democracy." Secord and his partner, Albert 
Hakim, referred to it as the Enterprise. 
The Enterprise, though nominally private, func-
tioned as a secret arm of the NSC staff in conducting 
the covert program in Nicaragua. While Secord con-
trolled the operational decisions of the Enterprise, 
North remained in overall charge of the Contra sup-
port program. He set the priorities and enlisted the 
support of an Ambassador, Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) officials, and military personnel to 
carry out the air resupply operation. He dealt with 
crises as they arose, sometimes on a daily basis. In 
carrying on these tasks, North had the unqualified 
support of Admiral Poindexter, who had replaced 
Robert McFarlane as National Security Adviser in 
December 1985. 
The efforts of the NSC staff and the Enterprise to 
carry out a government function with a makeshift 
covert organization were, however, dogged by prob-
lems from the beginning. The Enterprise's aircraft 
were in poor condition and the group had to over-
come numerous tactical problems in carrying out its 
mission. While the Enterprise conducted routine air 
drops in northern Nicaragua, it was not able to begin 
a regular air drop operation in the south until late 
summer of 1986?at a time when both Houses of 
Congress had voted to authorize the CIA to resume 
its support for the Contras with appropriated funds 
and when the Enterprise was trying to sell its assets 
to the CIA. The operation ended abruptly in October 
1986 when the plane that Eugene Hasenfus was on 
was shot down while on a mission to drop supplies to 
the Contras in Nicaragua. 
Before that and for more than 2 years, the NSC 
staff had secretly achieved what Congress had openly 
disapproved in the Boland Amendment?an extensive 
program of military support for the Contras. The 
Boland Amendment operated as a restraint on disclo-
sure, not on action, as the NSC staff placed policy 
ends above the law. 
The Enterprise's Mission is 
Expanded 
On June 12, 1985, the House passed a bill approving 
$27 million in humanitarian assistance to the Contras, 
paving the way for final approval and signature by 
the President in August 1985. While that vote virtual-

Chapter 3 
ly ensured that the Contras would have adequate 
food, medical supplies, and other provisions, it also 
strictly limited the money to nonmilitary uses. 
The provision of covert military assistance re-
mained the secret business of the NSC staff. In the 
summer of 1985, articles appeared in the press specu-
lating about the role of the NSC staff in assisting the 
Contras and Congress began inquiring of the National 
Security Adviser whether this was true. Yet, at this 
very time, the NSC staff decided to extend its covert 
program to include a system for resupplying Contras 
in the field. Some of the Contras fighting within Nica-
ragua were as many as 30 days away by land from 
border areas. To keep them supplied and to encour-
age other fighters to move from border sanctuaries to 
Nicaragua, a capacity to make aerial drops of ammu-
nition and other supplies was essential.' 
As early as February 1985, North had urged Calero 
to set aside $10 million from the funds raised from 
Country 2 to hire a logistics expert and create a 
resupply operation. But the available money was used 
to purchase and stockpile weapons. As a result, by 
summer 1986, the Contras had a surplus of arms. 
Their problem was how to deliver these weapons to 
the fighters. For North, the answer lay with Secord 
and his group.2 
In early July, North held a meeting in Miami of 
Contra leaders and members of Secord's group to 
arrange for what Congress had refused to fund?the 
air resupply of lethal material for the Contra forces 
inside Nicaragua. Present were North, FDN leader 
Adolfo Calero, Enrique Bermudez, the FDN military 
commander, Secord, and his associates, Thomas 
Clines and Rafael Quintero.3 
North began the meeting with an expression of a 
loss of confidence in the way the FDN was handling 
the donated funds he had directed to the FDN. 
Secord described North's remarks: 
The meeting commenced on a pretty hard note, 
with Colonel North being worried about and 
critical of the Contras, because he had been re-
ceiving reports that the limited funds they had 
might be getting wasted, squandered or even 
worse, some people might be lining their pockets. 
His concern, as he articulated it, was a very 
serious one. He was afraid that if anything like 
this was going on that since they were dependent 
on contributions that the image of the Resistance 
could be badly damaged; it could ruin us, in fact, 
and he was very, very hard on this point.4 
North's solution, though not unveiled at the meet-
ing, was to have Secord and his group take over the 
procurement function for the Contras. As Robert 
Owen, North's courier, testified, "I think he and Gen-
eral Secord felt they probably could do a better job" 
of handling the funds than the Contras.3 
60 
North had decided to furnish the FDN directly 
with arms, air support, and other supplies. He would 
no longer leave to the Contras the task of spending 
their own money on these goods and services. Almost 
immediately after the Miami meeting, Secord's part-
ner, Albert Hakim, established the Lake Resources 
account in Geneva, Switzerland, and thereafter virtu-
ally all donated funds were directed by North to the 
Lake Resources account in Switzerland, not Calero's 
accounts. The Secord group?the Enterprise?would 
no longer function simply as an arms broker from 
which Calero would purchase the arms. With the 
contributions, it would make all the decisions on arms 
purchases and supply the Contras with the weapons 
and the other support they needed, without receiving 
from the Contras payment for the arms.6 
The Contras' management of money was only one 
of the problems raised at the all-night meeting in 
Miami. More important was the need to create an 
airlift system to drop supplies to FDN troops inside 
Nicaragua and to open a Southern front. 
The first priority, all agreed, was the delivery of 
the arms already purchased to the soldiers fighting 
near and inside Nicaragua. Before the Boland Amend-
ment was passed, the CIA helped to arrange the airlift 
of arms and other supplies to the troops. When the 
CIA withdrew, the Contras had difficulty maintaining 
this important logistical function. The FDN's aircraft 
were few and could not effectively and consistently 
penetrate Nicaraguan airspace past Sandinista de-
fenses. Moreover, the FDN lacked properly trained 
personnel. The continuing resupply of troops and its 
attendant logistics, maintenance, and communications 
comprised the "sinews of war," the infrastructure nec-
essary for any sustained and effective fighting force. 
North turned to Secord to establish and run the air 
resupply operation.7 
The participants in the Miami meeting also agreed 
on the need to open a Southern front. With the FDN, 
the principal Contra force, operating in the North, the 
Sandinistas could concentrate their military forces on 
the Northern front. Forcing the Nicaraguans to fight 
a two-front war by building up a Contra force in the 
South was elemental military strategy. Calero, howev-
er, continued to concentrate his resources on his own 
organization in the North, the FDN.8 
The air resupply and Southern front projects went 
hand-in-hand. Because neighboring countries were re-
luctant to permit land resupply from inside their bor-
ders, a southern force could not live without air re-
supply. And the FDN could not, or would not, un-
dertake this mission on its own.3 
Thus, the air resupply operation that North asked 
Secord to undertake was also the key to the Southern 
front. In giving this assignment to Secord, North testi-
fied that he acted with McFarlane's authority." 
McFarlane denied this." Poindexter, however, stated 
that he was "aware that Colonel North was con-

Chapter 3 
cerned about the logistics operation, the way it was 
going, and I was aware that he was going to talk to 
General Secord about setting up a more professional 
logistics support operation as a private operation." 12 
The New Humanitarian Aid 
As the Enterprise began implementing the plans laid 
in Miami, the Contras received a boost from Wash-
ington. On August 8, 1985, President Reagan signed 
legislation authorizing $27 million in humanitarian aid 
to the Contras." For the first time since May 1984, 
the Contras would receive U.S. Government funding 
as well as intelligence support from the CIA. Al-
though the Boland Amendment remained in effect, 
new legislation specified that the Amendment did not 
prohibit exchanging information with the Contras." 
The legislation prohibited the CIA or the Depart-
ment of Defense (DOD) from administering the new 
humanitarian funds and required that the President 
ensure that any assistance "is used only for the intend-
ed purpose and is not diverted" for the acquisition of 
military hardware. The State Department was chosen 
to administer the aid. By executive order signed on 
August 29, 1985, the President created the Nicara-
guan Humanitarian Assistance Office (NHAO) in the 
State Department.15 
The State Department was reluctant to accept this 
responsibility. The Department had no experience and 
lacked the organization to feed and provide for the 
daily needs of troops. To run NHAO, Secretary 
George P. Shultz tapped Ambassador Robert Duem-
ling, a seasoned diplomat, but with no prior experi-
ence in administering an aid program. Secretary 
Shultz cautioned Duemling to administer the aid not 
only with "enthusiasm" but also with "care." Ambas-
sador Duemling found the program difficult to admin-
ister from the start.16 Nicaragua's neighbors did not 
officially recognize the Contra movement, even 
though Contras operated unofficially out of their ter-
ritory. The cargo of the initial NHAO flight on July 
10 was impounded when local Central American au-
thorities learned that an NBC film crew was on board 
at the invitation of Calero's brother. Thereafter, that 
Central American country barred, for a period of 
time, the entry of NHAO employees, which prevent-
ed them from conducting any on-site accounting of 
supplies or of the Contras' needs." Deumling's diffi-
culties were definitional as well as operational. 
NHAO had continually to assess whether various 
items were "humanitarian" within the meaning of the 
statute." 
Preparations for the Resupply Operation 
In the beginning of August, Secord met with North 
and others to discuss the steps necessary to establish 
the resupply program. First, a logistics organization 
consisting of aircraft, spare parts, maintenance, com-
munications, and trained personnel had to be set up. 
For that, Secord turned to former Air Force Lt. Col. 
Richard Gadd, who since his retirement from the 
military in 1982 had been providing, through a private 
business, air support to the Pentagon.19 
The second task was to obtain a secure operating 
base from which the aircraft could launch their mis-
sions. For this, Quintero, on Secord's instructions, 
consulted with the Contra leaders and chose a mili-
tary airbase in a Central American country ("The 
Airbase".) Secord and North concurred in this 
choice. 2 ? 
Finally, Secord concluded that to establish a sus-
tained air resupply operation on the Southern front, 
an emergency airstrip was necessary in the South. 
North suggested to Secord Santa Elena in the north-
west corner of Costa Rica, which North believed 
could also be used as a covert secondary operating 
base for resupply to the Southern front.21 
U.S. Support for the Covert 
Operation 
The plans made in Miami for a resupply operation 
and a Southern front could not have been implement-
ed without the active support of U.S. Government 
officials. 
In July 1985, almost immediately after the Miami 
meeting, North asked Lewis Tambs, the newly ap-
pointed Ambassador to Costa Rica, to help open a 
Southern front for the Contras, a request that Poin-
dexter approved.22 Tambs agreed without consulting 
Secretary Shultz. Later that summer, North specifical-
ly asked for Tambs' help, as well as that of CIA Chief 
Tomas Castillo, to facilitate the construction and use 
of the airfield.23 
North testified that he had received authorization 
from Director of Central Intelligence William J. 
Casey to bring Castillo into the resupply operation. 
Moreover, according to North, the airstrip was dis-
cussed in the Restricted Interagency Group on Cen-
tral American Affairs, which consisted of, among 
others, North, the Chief of the Central American 
Task Force (CATF) at the CIA and the group's 
chairman, Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State 
for Inter-American Affairs.24 Abrams acknowledged 
the discussions, but testified that he believed "private 
benefactors, as we used to call them, were building 
the airstrip." 25 
The Airfield Is Planned 
On August 10, 1985, North flew to Costa Rica 
where he met with Castillo and Tambs. North and 
Castillo discussed the establishment of a secret airbase 
that would permit moving all Contra military oper-
ations inside Nicaragua for resupply by air. Castillo 
and Tambs then worked to achieve the establishment

of the airfield and air resupply depot for the Contra 
forces. Castillo reported these developments to the 
Chief of the CATF at CIA headquarters. The Chief 
replied that he was pleased with these developments 
but he "emphasize[d]" to Castillo that neither the 
CIA nor DOD could "become involved directly or 
indirectly" in the project." 
Less than a week later, North sent Robert Owen to 
Costa Rica to scout the Santa Elena site. Owen met 
with Tambs, who introduced him to Castillo as a 
North emissary. The next day, Owen and Castillo 
surveyed Santa Elena. Owen took photographs and 
returned to Washington with a map, photos, and a 
description of various logistical problems presented 
by the air strip. North later told Castillo that he 
thought Santa Elena was an ideal place for a refueling 
and resupply base.2 7 
Meanwhile, North recruited a former Marine col-
league, William Haskell, to negotiate the purchase of 
the land at Santa Elena for the airfield. By the begin-
ning of September, Haskell, under the alias of Olm-
stead, arrived in Costa Rica to meet with Joseph 
Hamilton, an American who headed the group that 
owned the land at Santa Elena. While Tambs assisted 
in bringing the parties together, Castillo alerted North 
that local groups had to be involved in the construc-
tion. Eventually, Secord paid more than $190,000 for 
local contractors and guards at the airstrip.28 On Oc-
tober 3, Haskell called North with news of Hamilton's 
tentative approval for the sale of the land. Shortly 
thereafter, North, Haskell, Secord, Gadd, and Hakim 
met. At North's request, Gadd agreed to assemble a 
team and assume responsibility for constructing the 
airstrip. 29 
The Airbase Is Secured 
Once the Airbase in the other Central American 
country was selected as the most desirable main base 
for the air resupply operation, North also took the 
necessary steps to obtain host-government approval, 
which required the assistance of other U.S. Govern-
ment officials. North's notebooks reflect that on Sep-
tember 10, 1985, he met with Col. James Steele, a 
U.S. Military Group Commander stationed in Central 
America, and Donald Gregg, Vice President Bush's 
National Security Adviser. Among the discussion 
topics North listed was a "Calero/Bermudez visit to 
[the Airbase] to estab[lish] log[istical] support/ 
maint[enance]," as well as other possible locations for 
the resupply base.3? Gregg, however, testified that he 
did not know of the resupply operation prior to the 
summer of 1986.3' 
On September 16, North's notebooks reflect a call 
from Steele, "what about Felix?help for a/c [air-
craft] maint[enance]." 32 An ex-CIA operative, Felix 
Rodriguez had volunteered as a private American cit-
izen to aid a Central American Air Force in counter-
insurgency maneuvers. Rodriguez had a close rela-
62 
tionship with a local Commander stationed at the 
Airbase ("The Commander"). In a letter dated Sep-
tember 20, North asked Rodriguez to obtain service 
space at the Airbase for one C-7 Caribou aircraft and 
for occasional Maule maintenance. The Maule would 
be operated by the FDN and the Caribou by a private 
contractor for aerial resupply of both the FDN in the 
North and eventually in support of a Southern front, 
North wrote. North also said Rodriguez could use 
North's name with the Commander. Rodriguez 
agreed to help and obtained the Commander's ap-
proval.33 Poindexter had sanctioned North's efforts to 
obtain the Central American country's help in the 
logistics of air resupply.34 
Securing suitable aircraft that the Enterprise could 
afford proved difficult. In the summer of 1985, North 
met with both Secord and Calero on the most imme-
diate aircraft needs of the FDN and the resupply 
operation. They decided that their first need was a C-
7 Caribou, a twin-engine propeller aircraft capable of 
carrying a 5,000-pound cargo over a 900-mile 
range.35 By November 1985, Gadd, whose task it was 
to locate and purchase the airplanes, had found three 
surplus C-123 airplanes belonging to a Latin Ameri-
can Air Force. Gadd had earlier formed Amalgamat-
ed Commercial Enterprises (ACE), a shelf company 
registered in Panama, to hold title to the aircraft. 
ACE was owned equally by Gadd and Southern Air 
Transport of Miami, which was to provide mainte-
nance and other logistical support." 
The logistics director of the Latin American Air 
Force was unwilling to sell the airplanes?whose use 
was for military transport?to Gadd without a sign of 
official U.S. Government approval. So, Gadd turned 
to North for assistance, who decided to intercede in 
an effort to obtain the airplanes. North told Gadd and 
Secord that he requested both Robert McFarlane and 
the State Department's assistance. On November 15, 
North indicated in his notebook that he called "El-
liott" "re call to [the Latin American country]" for 
the purpose of telling [that country] that "ACE is 
OK." Abrams, however, denied any knowledge of the 
planes belonging to the Latin American country's Air 
Force. In addition, North asked Vince Cannistraro, a 
colleague at the NSC, to intercede with the Latin 
American country. In the PROF note on November 
20, North referred to Cannistraro's upcoming call and 
provided the following talking points: 
A reputable business organization called A.C.E. 
Inc. is negotiating with your air force to buy 
three excess C-123 aircraft, a number of engines 
(48) and some spare parts. 
A.C.E. is a legitimate company which will use 
the aircraft for a good purpose that is in the 
interest of your country and ours?humanitarian 
aid deliveries to anti-communist resistance forces 
(. . . Nicaragua).

Chapter 3 
Apparently the logistics director for the air force 
. . . was concerned that A.C.E. (Amalgamated 
Commercial Enterprises) may not be legitimate 
or that the A/C could be used for drug running 
or the like. This is not the case. 
It would be very helpful if you could contact 
someone who can clarify the good reputation of 
A.C.E. and encourage [the logistics director] to 
consummate the offer which has been made by 
A.C.E. The need is great for these planes. They 
will help the cause of democracy where it is most 
needed. 
Nonetheless, the Government of the Latin American 
country did not approve, and the Enterprise had to 
look elsewhere.37 
From the inception of the air resupply operation in 
July 1985, North impressed upon Secord the fact that 
they were operating with donated funds that were 
strictly limited. Consequently, more preferable air-
planes that were examined by Gadd and discussed by 
North and Secord, such as the Casa 212 and the L-
100 turbo jet propeller-driven aircraft, were rejected 
because of their high cost, in favor of the less expen-
sive C-7 and C-123.38 
Country 3 Comes Through 
More third-country money was needed to support 
the Contras. McFarlane had barred a return to Coun-
try 2,39 and John K. Singlaub had since the end of 
1984 been trying unsuccessfully to obtain money from 
Country 3. 
In the summer of 1985, North turned to Gaston 
Sigur, a Senior Director for Far Eastern and Asian 
Affairs on the NSC staff, to seek his assistance with 
Country 3.40 According to Sigur, North told him that 
it was an "emergency situation," and that he and 
McFarlane were aware that Country 3 "might have 
an interest in giving some assistance, financial assist-
ance in the humanitarian area to the Contras." 41 
North, too, testified that he had gone to Sigur with 
the knowledge, and approval, of McFarlane.42 
McFarlane testified to the contrary, claiming that he 
was "firm" with North "in saying to him absolutely 
no participation by you or any other staff member in 
any kind of approach to this country." 43 
Sigur recalled that when North asked him to set up 
the meeting, he inquired, "[N]ow everything here is 
quite legal?" to which North replied, "[O]h yes, we 
have checked all that out and there is no question 
about that. 
9> 44 
Sigur met with a Country 3 official and, without 
mentioning any specific amount of money, learned 
that the representative needed "to go back to his 
home government on it." The same day, Sigur went 
to McFarlane and told him that any contribution from 
Country 3 would have to be made directly through 
U.S. Government channels. According to Sigur, "Mr. 
McFarlane's response to that was that this is not pos-
sible, that cannot be done, and so I saw that as the 
end of that, and I told Colonel North about it." 45 
North was not deterred. He asked Sigur to arrange 
a face-to-face meeting with the Country 3 representa-
tive." At the ensuing meeting at the Hay-Adams 
Hotel in the fall of 1985, North told the Country 3 
representative that "this country [U.S.] would be very 
grateful if they were to make the contribution."47 
North's plea was successful. Sometime later, the 
Country 3 official responded with a $1 million contri-
bution in "humanitarian" assistance.48 North then sent 
Owen to give the official an envelope containing the 
Swiss bank number of the Enterprise's Lake Re-
sources account. The $1 million was transferred to 
Lake Resources and another $1 million followed in 
the early months of 1986.49 
The Link With NHAO 
Without the knowledge of its supervisors, the Nica-
raguan Humanitarian Assistance Office (NHAO) pro-
gram was used to further the Enterprise's activities. 
Robert Owen became the first link between NHAO 
and the covert operation. In mid-September 1985, 
Owen applied to Ambassador Duemling for a position 
in the humanitarian aid office. North recommended 
Owen as a "can do" person "who knows the scene," 
but Duemling declined to hire him." 
Duemling still refused to hire Owen even after the 
three directors of the United Nicaraguan Opposition 
(UNO)?Calero, Arturo Cruz, and Alfonso Robelo?
wrote Duemling requesting Owen's help. North, how-
ever, continued to press for Owen's employment. At a 
Restricted Interagency Group meeting on October 11, 
North complained about the October 10 NHAO re-
supply flight impounded by Central American au-
thorities, claiming that it would never have happened 
if Owen had been working for NHAO. Only then did 
Duemling relent and agree to fund a UNO contract 
with Owen's company, the Institute for Democracy, 
Education and Assistance, Inc. (IDEA), to assist in 
disbursing the humanitarian aid." 
North exploited Owen's new position by using his 
trips, funded by humanitarian aid dollars, to transfer 
and receive information about the Contra war and the 
fledgling resupply operation. Following his trips to 
Central America, Owen would submit two reports?
one to NHAO describing humanitarian services per-
formed and another to North describing his activities 
in coordinating lethal aid. The grant agreement with 
the State Department barred Owen from performing 
"any service" related to lethal supply "during the 
term of this grant." 52 
North also told Owen that he should introduce 
Gadd to Mario Calero, who was in charge of pur-
chases for the FDN in the United States, so that 
Gadd might get a contract to fly humanitarian aid 
supply missions." Later, North personally accompa-

Chapter 3 
nied Gadd to meet with Ambassador Duemling and 
urged Duemling to award Gadd an air delivery con-
tract, to which Duemling, unaware of Gadd's role in 
the lethal resupply operation, agreed.54 
New Legislation Congressional 
Support Increases 
On November 21, 1985, the Senate agreed to a con-
ference report on the Intelligence Authorization Bill 
providing two significant Contra support measures: 
the CIA was granted additional money to provide 
communications equipment to the Contras and the bill 
specifically provided that the State Department was 
not precluded from soliciting third countries for hu-
manitarian assistance. The U.S. Government was still 
barred from expending funds to provide lethal assist-
ance to the Contras but, according to North, "the 
instructions were to bite off a little at a time and start 
moving back toward full support." 55 
Poindexter Visits Central America 
On December 12, 1985, the newly appointed Na-
tional Security Adviser, Admiral Poindexter, took a 
trip with North to Central America." 
In a PROF note to Poindexter, North recommend-
ed the trip, suggesting that it be "billed as a quick 
tour through the region to confer w/ top ranking 
U.S. officials to reinforce the continuity of U.S. 
policy in the region." That explanation would be a 
"plausible cover" for the real purpose of the trip, 
which included delivering to Central American offi-
cials "the messages we need sent." 57 
One of the messages was that "we [the United 
States] intend to pursue a victory and that [a Central 
American country] will not be forced to seek a politi-
cal accommodation with the Sandinistas." 58 North 
noted that this Central American country was at-
tempting to use support of the Contras as leverage to 
force U.S. aid.59 
The Santa Elena airstrip in Costa Rica was also an 
issue raised in discussions during the trip. North 
brought Poindexter up to date on the progress of the 
Santa Elena airstrip, and they discussed what meas-
ures "could be taken to encourage" Costa Rica to be 
more cooperative with the Contras. When Poindexter 
returned from his one-day trip to Central America, he 
briefed the President on the morning of December 13, 
including informing the President of the efforts to 
secure the land necessary for the airstrip. Poindexter 
testified, and his notes reflect, that Poindexter "did 
talk to him [the President] about the private air-
strip." 60 
Continued Funding Problems 
By the end of 1985, North had put into motion the 
airlift operation and the beginnings of the Southern 
64 
front. A critical problem remained how to fund these 
efforts. Throughout 1985, North, Casey, and Singlaub 
discussed a variety of methods to fund support for the 
Contras. In early 1985, in connection with his solicita-
tion of Country 3, Singlaub suggested to Country 3 
officials and to North that a portion of his proposed 
arms sales to Country 3 be diverted and applied to the 
benefit of the Contras. During the summer of 1985, 
Singlaub worked without success through Geomili-
tech Consultants, owned by Barbara Studley, on di-
verting part of a $75 million proposed sale of torpe-
dos to Country 3. In the fall of 1985, Singlaub ar-
ranged for both North and Casey to meet with Stud-
ley to present yet another plan to aid the Contras and 
democratic resistance forces worldwide. Geomilitech 
would be a vehicle for a three-way trade to "enable 
the U.S. Government, the Administration, to acquire 
some Soviet-bloc weapons without having to go 
through the painful process of appropriations," in 
order to furnish weapons to anti-Communist insurgen-
cies in Nicaragua and around the world. The pro-
posed trade entailed the U.S.'s giving credit for high 
technology purchases to another country, that coun-
try using the credit to deliver military equipment to a 
totalitarian country, which would then transfer 
Soviet-compatible weapons to a trading company. Ac-
cording to the plan, the company, at the direction of 
the NSC and CIA, would distribute the weapons to 
the Contras and other resistance movements, "man-
dating neither the consent or awareness of the De-
partment of State or Congress." These fundraising 
ideas were never approved. The diversion from the 
Iranian arms sales would provide the needed funds." 
Legislative Plans and a New Finding 
At a January 10, 1986, NSC meeting, the first in 15 
months on Nicaragua, the President heard the views 
of his advisers. CIA Director Casey described a build-
up of Soviet weaponry and increasing Sandinista re-
pression in Nicaragua; Admiral William J. Crowe, Jr., 
discussed the inability of the Department of Defense 
to provide logistical assistance that the Contras badly 
needed; and Secretary Shultz voiced his approval for 
resumption of Congressional funding for a covert pro-
gram. The President ended the meeting by instructing 
his advisers to prepare to go back to Congress with a 
request for full funding ($100 million) of a covert 
action program.62 
A week after the meeting, the President signed a 
new Finding on Nicaragua, consolidating what had 
been separate Findings governing various aspects of 
the program. The Finding authorized the CIA to im-
plement the newly granted aid and to establish the 
communications network for which Congress had just 
provided funding.

Chapter 3 
The Resupply Operation Begins 
In January 1986, the plans set in motion by North 
in the fall of 1985 were beginning to give shape to the 
resupply operation. Gadd recruited flight crews, 
agreed with Southern Air Transport that it would 
handle all aircraft maintenance, and purchased the 
first aircraft, a C-7 Caribou. A team was also sent to 
Santa Elena and construction of the airstrip began in 
earnest.63 Moreover, the problem of secure communi-
cations was solved with the help of the National Se-
curity Agency. 
According to North, both Casey and Poindexter 
had told him to seek some type of secure communica-
tions support. North turned to the National Security 
Agency for secure communications equipment.64 
The National Security Agency provided KL-43 en-
cryption devices to North. On January 15, North 
gave KL-43s to the principal members of the covert 
operation: Secord, Gadd, Steele, Castillo, Quintero, 
and William Langton, president of Southern Air 
Transport. North also put a device in his office at the 
Old Executive Office Building. Each month newly 
keyed material was distributed to the group to enable 
them to communicate with each other in a secure 
manner.6 5 
Throughout January 1986, North also pursued dis-
cussions with Steele and CIA representatives about 
arrangements for using the Airbase and for establish-
ing the airstrip at Santa Elena. North's notebooks 
indicate a series of telephone conversations with 
Steele relating to obtaining the permission of Central 
American officials for the resupply aircraft to operate 
from the Airbase.6 6 
During that same period, North wrote to Poin-
dexter that General John Galvin, Commander of U.S. 
Southern Command, was "cognizant of the activities 
under way in both Costa Rica and at [the Airbase] in 
support of the DRF [Democratic Resistance Force]." 
North added, "Gen. Galvin is enthusiastic about both 
endeavors." According to North's notebooks, North, 
Poindexter, and others met with Galvin on January 
16 to discuss, among other items, "covert strategy/ 
training/planning/support" for the Nicaraguan Resist-
ance. General Galvin testified that he knew of the air 
resupply operation, but believed that it was being 
financed and run by private individuals, not the NSC 
staff.6 7 
Meanwhile, North continued his discussions on the 
details of construction of the airstrip at Santa Elena. 
His discussions covered arrangements for fuel storage 
on site, the construction of guard quarters and even 
instructions to the bulldozer operation." 
In February, after consultation with Enrique Ber-
mudez and various commanders connected with the 
Southern front, North and Secord decided to deliver 
approximately 90,000 pounds of small arms and am-
munition geared for airdrop to the FDN, which also 
could be delivered to the Southern front. This was 
the first delivery of arms that North and Secord pro-
vided to the Contras without payment from them and 
out of funds that had been contributed directly to the 
Enterprise. 69 
Yet by February, supply problems still plagued the 
operation. There was only one plane at the Airbase, 
and it was damaged. On its arrival flight, the C-7 
plane had developed mechanical problems. The crew 
jettisoned spare parts, and even training manuals, but 
the plane crash-landed nonetheless.7? 
Faced with the Contras' requests for resupply and 
lacking aircraft to perform the job, North sought to 
deliver arms to the Contra soldiers using aircraft that 
had been chartered by NHAO to take humanitarian 
supplies from the United States to Central America." 
In February 1986, North called Gadd at home and 
told him to charter an NHAO flight from New Orle-
ans to the Airbase in Central America. Once the plane 
arrived at the Airbase, it was directed to an FDN 
base where ammunition and lethal supplies were 
loaded and airdropped to the FDN. NHAO later re-
fused to pay for the portion of the charter that cov-
ered the delivery of lethal supplies." 
In the South, however, the Contra forces remained 
without necessary supplies. In part, the problem was 
logistical: the Costa Rican airfield was not yet open 
and the only planes available at the Airbase could not 
make the flight to southern Nicaragua. The problem 
was also political: the FDN did not want to share its 
scarce resources with the southern forces. In early 
February, Owen warned North that "our credibility 
will once again be zero in the south" if deliveries did 
not soon start: 
[T]hey have been promised they will get what 
they need. Who is to be the contact for these 
goods and who is to see that they are delivered? 
A critical stage is being entered in the Southern 
Front and we have to deliver.73 
In early March, North asked Owen to travel with 
another NHAO humanitarian aid flight that, upon un-
loading, would be reloaded at the Enterprise's ex-
pense with lethal supplies for airdrop to the Southern 
front. However, the FDN never produced the muni-
tions promised, even though CIA officials tried to 
persuade the FDN to release the munitions. The mis-
sion thus resulted in failure. As Owen later wrote 
North, "the main thing to be learned from this latest 
exercise is . . . the FDN cannot be relied upon to 
provide material in a timely manner."74 
The President Meets a Costa Rican 
Official 
In March 1986, a meeting North arranged for a Costa 
Rican Official with President Reagan at the White 
House occurred. The meeting was simply a photo

Chapter 3 
opportunity, attended as well by North and Cas-
tillo.75 
After the Oval Office visit, North asked the Official 
to meet with Secord that afternoon to work out some 
issues concerning the airstrip. At the meeting, the 
Official asked Secord for a letter, which the Official 
dictated, to the effect that the Costa Rican Civil 
Guard maintain control of the airstrip, have access to 
it for training purposes, and that ecological and envi-
ronmental considerations apply.76 
Lethal Deliveries Begin 
By the end of March 1986, the C-7 Caribou aircraft 
was operating and flights finally began to ferry lethal 
and nonlethal supplies for the FDN in the North. But 
the problem of resupplying the Southern front re-
mained.77 
On March 28, Owen wrote to North that he, 
Steele, Rodriguez, and Quintero reached a consensus 
on what steps had to be taken to successfully resupply 
the South: lethal and nonlethal supplies should be 
stockpiled at the Airbase; the Caribou or better yet a 
C-123 should load at the Airbase, deliver to the 
South, and refuel at Santa Elena on the return to the 
Airbase; and the Southern Air Transport L-100 
should be used until Santa Elena was prepared to 
refuel the C-7 and C-123.78 
While Gadd completed the purchase of a second C-
7 Caribou and the first C-123 in early April, North 
responded to the growing needs of the southern 
forces. Between early April and April 11, North co-
ordinated virtually every aspect of the first drop of 
lethal supplies into Nicaragua by way of the Southern 
front. He was in regular communication with Secord 
and others to ensure that the drop was successful. 
KL-43 messages among the planners involved in this 
drop show both the level of detail in which North 
was concerned and the coordination among various 
U.S. Government agencies to ensure that the drop 
succeeded. The first message, from North to Secord, 
established the essential elements of the drop: 
The unit to which we wanted to drop in the 
southern quadrant of Nicaragua is in desperate 
need of ordnance resupply. . . . Have therefore 
developed an alternative plan which [Chief of the 
CIA's CATF] has been briefed on and in which 
he concurs. The L-100 which flies from MSY to 
[an FDN base] on Wednesday should terminate 
it's NHAO mission on arrival at [the FDN base]. 
At that point it should load the supplies at [the 
Airbase] which?theoretically [the CIA's Chief 
of Station in the Central American country] is 
assembling today at [the FDN base]?and take 
them to [the Airbase]. These items should then be 
transloaded to the C-123. . . . On any night be-
tween Wednesday, Apr 9, and Friday, Apr 11 
these supplies should be dropped by the C-123 in 
the vicinity of [drop zone inside Nicaragua]. The 
66 
A/C shd penetrate Nicaragua across the Atlantic 
Coast. . . . If we are ever going to take the 
pressure off the northern front we have got to 
get this drop in?quickly. Please make sure that 
this is retransmitted via this channel to [Castillo], 
Ralph, Sat and Steele. Owen already briefed and 
prepared to go w/ the L-100 out of MSY if this 
will help. Please advise soonest.79 
Secord and Gadd arranged to lease the L-100 plane 
from Southern Air Transport. Secord transmitted the 
following instructions to Quintero on April 8: 
CIA and Goode [North's code name] report 
Blackys [a Southern front military commandante] 
troops in south in desperate fix. Therefore, 
[CIA's Chief of Station in a Central American 
country] is supposed to arrange for a load to 
come from [the FDN base] to [the Airbase] via 
L100 tomorrow afternoon. . . . Notify Steele we 
intend to drop tomorrow nite or more like Thurs 
nite. . . . Meanwhile, contact [Castillo] via this 
machine and get latest on DZ [drop zone] co-
ordinates and the other data I gave you the 
format for. . . . CIA wants the aircraft to enter 
the DZ area from the Atlantic. . . .80 
On April 9, Secord relayed to North that "all co-
ordination now complete at [the Airbase] for drop?
[Castillo] has provided the necessary inputs."' After 
the Southern military commanders relayed the drop 
zone information to Castillo's communications center, 
Castillo sent a cable to the Chief of the CATF at CIA 
headquarters, requesting flight path information, vec-
tors based on the coordinates of the drop zone, and 
hostile risk evaluation to be passed to the crew. CIA 
headquarters provided the information, as it did on 
three other occasions that spring.82 
After Secord's April 9 message, the L-100 arrived 
and was loaded with a considerable store of munitions 
for airdrop to the South on April 10. Castillo had 
provided the location of the drop zone to Quintero, 
and Steele told the Southern Air Transport crew how 
to avoid Sandinista radar. Despite North's intricate 
planning, the L-100 was unable to locate the Contra 
forces. The maiden flight to the Southern front had 
failed.83 
On April 11, the L-100 tried again, airdropping 
more than 20,000 pounds of lethal supplies inside 
Nicaragua. This was the first successful drop to the 
southern forces. Before the plane left, Steele checked 
the loading of the cargo, including whether the as-
sault rifles were properly padded. Castillo reported 
the drop to North in glowing terms: 
Per UNO South Force, drop successfully com-
pleted in 15 minutes. . . . Our plans during next 2-
3 weeks include air drop at sea for UNO/KISAN

may be overly ambitious planning but with your 
help, believe we can pull it off." 
The Resupply Operation Steps Up 
Its Activities 
While the April 11 mission to the South was the only 
successful airdrop in that region, the air resupply op-
eration was, by April, operating regular, almost daily, 
supply missions for the FDN in the North. Most 
missions delivered supplies from the main FDN base 
to the FDN's forward-operating positions. Other 
flights dropped lethal cargo to units operating inside 
Nicaragua. Many of these flights were helped infor-
mally by CIA field officers on the ground, who pre-
pared flight plans for aerial resupply missions, briefed 
the air crews on Nicaraguan antiaircraft installations, 
and provided minor shop supplies to the mechanics. 
On one occasion, the CIA operations officer at an 
FDN base flew Ian Crawford, a loadmaster for the 
resupply operation, in a CIA helicopter with lethal 
supplies on board over the border area so Crawford 
could see where he and his crew were airdropping 
cargo three to four times daily. However, the resup-
ply operation was not without problems. Poor mainte-
nance hampered the performance of the aircraft and a 
lack of a closely knit organization contributed to the 
Enterprise's troubles.95 
Because of these problems, North and Secord flew 
to the Airbase in Central America on April 20 for a 
one-day meeting with the Commander, Steele, Rodri-
guez, and the military leadership of the FDN. During 
the meeting, North and Secord emphasized the impor-
tance of the Southern front and complained about the 
difficulty of getting stocks out of the FDN, thus pre-
paring the FDN for the future storage of Southern 
front supplies directly at the Airbase. There was some 
misunderstanding as to whether the FDN were the 
legal owners of the aircraft, but North and Secord 
stated that the aircraft belonged to a private company 
dedicated to support all the Contras, both the FDN 
and the Southern front. In turn, the FDN leaders 
expressed their dissatisfaction with the C-7 aircraft. 
They were simply "too old" to operate effectively, 
Bermudez told them. He wanted bigger and faster 
aircraft. North responded that if he had the money to 
buy better aircraft, he would, but they were financing 
the operation with donated funds." 
The possible purchase for the FDN of Blowpipe 
surface-to-air missiles to use against the Sandinista 
HIND-D helicopters was also raised. In December 
1985, Secord and Calero had tried to purchase Blow-
pipes from a Latin American country. The transaction 
proceeded to the point where the Enterprise placed a 
deposit on the missiles. But necessary approvals for 
the sale could not be secured, even though North 
enlisted the help of Poindexter and of McFarlane, 
who remained in contact with North by PROF ma-
chine even after he left the Government." 
After the April 20, 1986, meeting, the first shipment 
of lethal supplies by the Enterprise for the Southern 
front arrived at the Airbase to be stored by the resup-
ply operation. At North's request, the Enterprise paid 
David Walker $110,000 for two foreign pilots and a 
loadmaster to fly missions inside Nicaragua so that 
U.S. citizens would not be exposed to possible shoot-
down or capture." 
Secord tcok another step to overcome the resupply 
problems. He recruited Col. Robert Dutton to 
manage the resupply operation on a daily basis. 
Secord knew Dutton from their active duty together 
in the U.S. Air Force, where Dutton had considerable 
experience in managing covert air resupply oper-
ations. Gadd's role was phased out and on May 1, 
Dutton, retiring from the Air Force, was placed in 
operational command of the resupply operation, re-
porting to Secord, and increasingly over time, direct-
ly to North on all operational decisions of conse-
quence.89 
At the outset, Secord emphasized to Dutton that 
the air program would receive very little in the way 
of additional funding. Dutton was instructed to 
manage the operation with existing equipment and 
conserve resources carefully as the money provided 
was all "donated." 90 
When Dutton took over, he traveled to Central 
America to assess the operation. There were approxi-
mately 19 pilots, loadmasters and maintenance opera-
tors at the Airbase. In addition, Felix Rodriguez and 
his associate Ramon Medina coordinated with the 
Commander and oversaw the local fuel account. 
Dutton also examined the aircraft?two C-7s, one C-
123, and the Maule?and found that, indeed, they 
were in "very poor operating condition." 91 
The resupply operation at the Airbase maintained a 
warehouse stocked with an assortment of munitions?
light machine guns, assault rifles, ammunition, mor-
tars, grenades, C-4 explosive, parachute rigging, uni-
forms, and other military paraphernalia. The crews 
lived in three safe houses and used a separate office 
with maps and communications equipment. By May, 
the Santa Elena airstrip, along with emergency fuel 
storage space and temporary housing, was finished." 
Because Secord (and later North) had impressed on 
Dutton the need for strict accountability given the 
limited nature of the donated funds, Dutton enforced 
a stringent set of accounting requirements: Expendi-
tures had to be carefully documented and all missions 
fully reported. Moreover, Dutton devised an organi-

Chapter 3 
zation, based on a military hierarchy, that delineated 
each person's role and responsibility. Dutton also de-
fined the legal constraints on the organization as he 
had understood from Secord: no Contra combatants 
could be airdropped into battle. These new require-
ments of accountability, reporting, and organization 
were followed for the remaining life of the oper-
ation.93 
Despite these impending changes, North wrote to 
Poindexter expressing his weariness and warning that 
without Congressional authorization for CIA involve-
ment, "we will run increasing risks of trying to 
manage this program from here with the attendant 
physical and political liabilities. I am not complaining, 
and you know that I love the work, but we have to 
lift some of this onto the CIA so that I can get more 
than 2-3 hrs. of sleep at night." 94 
Dutton's Reorganization Plan 
Following his first trip to Central America in May, 
Dutton began drafting a reorganization plan for the 
Enterprise "to outline in one document exactly what 
the basic operating locations were, and who the key 
people were and what their responsibilities were."95 
The plan was reviewed, edited, and approved by both 
Secord and North." The plan stated that "B.C. 
Washington has operational control of all assets in 
support of Project Democracy."97 While Secord 
maintained that B.C. Washington meant "primarily 
myself and Robert Dutton," 98 Dutton testified that 
"B.C. Washington" described North and Secord.99 
According to Dutton, the purpose of the reorgani-
zation plan was to disguise the role of Secord and 
North. The lawsuit brought by freelance journalisits 
Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey had named Secord 
and was generating publicity. North and Secord, ac-
cording to Dutton, were concerned that Rodriguez, 
who had become disaffected, was providing informa-
tion about the operation to Avirgan and Honey. 
North and Secord, therefore, wanted to create the 
pretense that they "had withdrawn from the oper-
ation, they were no longer part of it, and this new 
company called B.C. Washington, which represented 
the donators [sic], therefore the benefactors?that 
they had come in to take over the operation." 100 
But, according to Dutton, "the fact was that Colonel 
North and General Secord's relationship with the or-
ganization had not changed one bit."?' As Dutton 
acknowledged, "B.C. Washington" was a facade that 
North and Secord developed in order to cloak their 
role.1?2 
The Southern Front Resupply 
On May 24, 1986, the day after Dutton left Central 
America, another planeload of munitions, paid for by 
the Enterprise arrived at the Airbase for the Southern 
front. Because the FDN was reluctant to make arms 
available to the independent southern Contra forces, 
68 
North and Secord decided in April 1986 that arms 
and other supplies would now be stored under the 
control of the Enterprise at the Airbase. This second 
direct shipment of arms to the Airbase to be delivered 
to the Southern front was part of the new plan. To-
gether with the late April shipment, there were now 
more than $1 million in arms at the Airbase available 
for airdrop to the Southern front forces.'" 
The warehouse, however, was not large enough to 
accommodate the new munitions. Dutton had to ask 
the Commander for permission to expand the ware-
house, while seeking North's approval for the addi-
tional cost of construction. After the Commander au-
thorized the expansion, North relayed to Secord his 
approval for construction to proceed.'" 
With new arms and an expanded warehouse, 
Dutton had the material to deliver to the Southern 
front. However, while regular deliveries with the C-7 
continued to the FDN in the North, no flights were 
being made to the South. North told Dutton that the 
Southern forces were adding 150 new recruits a day, 
but that they had neither enough weapons for the 
fighters nor enough medicine to treat the growing 
problem of mountain leprosy.1?9 
On June 2, Castillo called North and told him that 
drops to the southern units were needed as soon as 
possible. Castillo advised North that Quintero had all 
the necessary vector information to make the drops. 
Following Castillo's request, two deliveries were pre-
pared for the South totalling about 39,000 pounds, 
and on June 9, after coordinating with Castillo the 
location and needs of the Southern troops, the C-123 
airplane tried to make an air drop. However, the 
plane could not locate the troops inside Nicaragua, 
and when it landed at the Santa Elena airstrip, it got 
stuck in the mud.'" 
The stuck plane caused consternation at the U.S. 
Embassy in Costa Rica. The month before, Oscar 
Arias had been inaugurated as the new President of 
Costa Rica. The new Costa Rican Government had 
told Ambassador Tambs that it had instructed that the 
airstrip not be utilized. Tambs, in turn, told Castillo to 
notify North and Udall Corporation that the airstrip 
had to be closed. Now Tambs was faced with explain-
ing to President Arias why a munitions-laden airplane 
was stuck in the mud at Santa Elena. A plan was 
devised by Tambs, Castillo, and others at the U.S. 
Embassy to borrow trucks from a nearby facility to 
free the aircraft, but the plane was able to take off 
before the plan could be carried out.'" 
The needs of the FDN still had to be met. On June 
10, North met with Calero who requested that the 
Caribou planes fly more missions inside Nicaragua. 
The Enterprise was just about to purchase additional 
arms for the FDN.'" However, the most pressing 
need, North wrote to Poindexter, was neither money 
nor arms, but rather: "to get the CIA re-engaged in 
this effort so that it can be better managed than it

Chapter 3 
now is by one slightly confused Marine Lt. Col." 
North further reported to Poindexter that "several 
million rounds of ammo are now on hand . . . Criti-
cally needed items are being flown in from Europe to 
the expanded warehouse facility at [the Airbase]. At 
this point, the only liability we still have is one of 
Democracy, Inc.'s airplanes is mired in the mud (it is 
the rainy season down there) on the secret field in 
Costa Rica." 109 
The decision to purchase additional millions of dol-
lars in arms for the FDN was taken after the Enter-
prise learned from Bermudez and the FDN leaders 
that FDN stocks were getting low. Hundreds of tons 
of East European weapons were paid for in three 
installments between June 27 to July 16. The ship-
ment, the last arms purchased for the Contras by 
North and Secord, never reached 
Despite the difficulties, North wanted to continue 
to airdrop supplies, especially to the South. As soon 
as the C-123 was freed from the mud, it embarked on 
another mission with a full lethal load for the south-
ern troops. But this time, fog covered a mountain, and 
William Cooper, the chief pilot for the resupply oper-
ation, hit the top of a tree, knocking out an engine. 
After the plane reached the drop zone, Cooper could 
not locate the troops." 
Communicating by KL-43, North told Castillo that 
to facilitate further airdrops to the southern forces, he 
had "asked Ralph [Quintero] to proceed immediately 
to your location. I do not think we ought to contem-
plate these operations without him being on scene. 
Too many things go wrong that then directly involve 
you and me in what should be deniable for both of 
us.""2 
Meanwhile, North made further plans to ensure re-
supply to the Southern front. With the C-123 dam-
aged in flight, the remaining C-7 aircraft could only 
make the trip to the South if it were able to refuel 
before the return trip, and the Santa Elena strip was 
not operational. North asked Dutton to look for an-
other C-123, and with Tambs' assistance, arranged for 
a new flight pattern in which the empty C-7 aircraft, 
after making its drops, refueled at the San Jose Inter-
national Airport in Costa Rica. The new refueling 
plan permitted two small drops of supplies to the 
Southern front. But, by the third week in July, 
$870,000 worth of munitions were still sitting at the 
Airbase waiting for the Southern forces. Despite all 
the efforts, the vision of a year before for the South-
ern front had yet to become a reality."3 
Alternative Funding Sources: 
North's Response to 
Congressional Action 
The Administration continued to seek an appropria-
tion for the CIA to resume its program of covert 
assistance to the Contras. In early May, according to 
Poindexter, the President told him, "If we can't move 
the Contra package before June 9, I want to figure 
out a way to take action unilaterally to provide assist-
ance." Poindexter wrote his deputy, Donald Fortier, 
"The President is ready to confront the Congress on 
the Constitutional question of who controls foreign 
policy. . . . George [Shultz] agrees with the President 
that we have to find some way and we will not pull 
out." 114 
North, who received a copy of Poindexter's PROF 
note, responded immediately with a suggestion: The 
Contras should capture some territory inside Nicara-
gua and set up a provisional government. The Presi-
dent would respond by recognizing the Contras as the 
true government and provide support. Asked by Poin-
dexter whether he had talked to Casey about his plan, 
North replied, "Yes, in general terms. He is support-
ive, as is Elliott [Abrams]. It is, to say the least, a 
high risk option?but it may be the only way we can 
ever get this thing to work."115 
The Money: Third Country Assistance 
By the end of April 1986, the Contras' funding 
needs were critical. North told Fortier: "We need to 
explore this problem urgently or there won't be a 
force to help when the Congress finally acts."6 The 
same day, North wrote to McFarlane that "the resist-
ance support acct. is darned near broke," and asked 
for assistance in filling the gap: 
Any thoughts where we can put our hands on a 
quick $3-5M? Gaston [Sigur] is going back to his 
friends who have given $2M so far in hopes that 
we can bridge things again, but time is running 
out along w/ the money. So far we have seven 
a/c working, have delivered over $37M in sup-
plies and ordnance but the pot is almost empty. 
Have told Dick [Secord] to prepare to sell the 
ship first and then the a/c as a means of sustain-
ing the effort. Where we go after that is a very 
big question. "7 
An Aborted Solicitation 
Despite North's reference to "Gaston," it was not 
Gaston Sigur, but Singlaub who went to the Far East 
in May 1986 in search of Contra aid. This time, Sing-
laub wanted to be sure that he would receive the 
official U.S. "signal" these countries had previously 
told him was a condition to their aid. Before he trav-
eled to Countries 3 and 5, Singlaub spoke to Elliott 
Abrams at the State Department and, according to 
Singlaub, explained that he wanted to know "how the 
U.S. would send a signal." Singlaub testified that 
Abrams told him that he (Abrams) would send the 
signal. "8 
Singlaub arrived in Country 3, but before he could 
meet with his contact, Abrams told him to stop the 
plan. When Singlaub and Abrams later met, Singlaub

Chapter 3 
testified that Abrams told him that the solicitation 
was "going to be handled by someone at the highest 
level." Singlaub assumed that it would be someone 
from the White House, although Abrams never gave 
him a specific name.119 However, Abrams disputed 
Singlaub's testimony. While acknowledging that he 
spoke to Singlaub about Singlaub's proposed solicita-
tion, Abrams testified that he never agreed to provide 
to Singlaub a U.S. Government signal for the solicita-
tion."? Abrams' account is supported by the testimo-
ny of Richard Melton, at the time Director of the 
Office of Central American Affairs at the State De-
partment, who was present during Abrams' conversa-
tions with Singlaub.'21 
The May 16, 1986, NSPG Meeting 
On May 16, 1986, the President and his advisers 
discussed the issue of obtaining funds from third 
countries. In a memorandum to the President for the 
National Security Planning Group (NSPG) meeting, 
North suggested three ways to "bridge the gap" in 
funding: (1) a reprogramming of funds from DOD to 
the CIA ($15 million in humanitarian aid); (2) a Presi-
dential appeal for private donations by U.S. citizens; 
and (3) a "direct and very private Presidential over-
ture to certain Heads of State." The last source of 
funds would, as North put it, eliminate the need "to 
endure further domestic partisan political debate." 122 
Director Casey opened the meeting and explained 
the Contras' needs. The good news, he told the Presi-
dent, was that the Contras had infiltrated more troops 
into Nicaragua than ever before, and the troops were 
now being resupplied by air.'" The "bad news" was 
that the Resistance was operating under the assump-
tion that it would receive new funding at the end of 
May. Only $2 million remained from the humanitarian 
assistance appropriation. '24 
Later in the discussion, Secretary Shultz returned 
to the Contras' need for funds. Noting the unlikeli-
hood of an immediate Congressional appropriation 
and the improbability that the intelligence committees 
could be persuaded to reprogram funds, Secretary 
Shultz suggested that third countries be approached 
for humanitarian aid. North added that the Intelli-
gence Authorization Act of 1986 permitted the State 
Department to approach other governments for non-
military aid. '25 
No one at the meeting discussed the fact that Coun-
try 2 had already given $32 million to the Contras, 
including a $24 million donation committed to the 
President personally. Nor was it mentioned that sev-
eral Far Eastern countries had been approached for 
donations or that Country 3 had given $2 million only 
6 months earlier. Instead, Shultz was instructed to 
prepare for review by the President a list of countries 
that could be solicited. 
Later that day, North told Poindexter that the ur-
gency of the need had lessened: The Enterprise had 
70 
that day received the last $5 million of the $15 million 
arms sales to Iran. North wrote Poindexter: "You 
should be aware that the resistance support organiza-
tion now has more than $6 million available for imme-
diate disbursement. This reduces the need to go to 
third countries for help." 126 North later testified that 
he wrote the message because "it was important he 
[Poindexter] understand that Secretary Shultz didn't 
need to go out that afternoon and go ask for addition-
al help." Poindexter testified that he understood the 
$6 million to which North referred was coming from 
the Iranian arms sales, but he did not tell the Presi-
dent the $6 million was available. North testified that 
as he was leaving the NSPG meeting, he mentioned 
to Poindexter that Iran was supplying $6 million for 
the Contras, but that he did not know whether he 
was overheard.'27 
North wrote Poindexter that he did not know 
whether all those present at the NSPG meeting, such 
as Chief of Staff Donald Regan, knew of "my private 
U.S. operation." On the other hand, North noted to 
Poindexter, "the President obviously knows why he 
has been meeting with several select people to thank 
them for their 'support for Democracy' in 
CentAm."128 
North also realized that disclosure of a significant 
sum of money earmarked for Contra support, but only 
made possible by arms sales to Iran, could prove 
politically embarrassing. 
The more money there is (and we will have a 
considerable amount in a few more days) the 
more visible the program becomes (airplanes, 
pilots, weapons, deliveries, etc.) and the more 
inquisitive will become people like Kerry, 
Barnes, Harkins, et al. While I care not a whit 
what they may say about me, it could well 
become a political embarrassment for the Presi-
dent and you. 
He suggested that the problem could be "avoided 
simply by covering it with an authorized CIA pro-
gram undertaken with the $15M" reprogrammed 
funding from the DOD budget.'29 
Poindexter approved North's recommendation to 
seek the $15 million reprogramming and responded to 
his concerns: "Go ahead and work up the paper 
needed for the $15M reprogramming. . . . I under-
stand your concerns and agree. I just didn't want you 
to bring it up at NSPG. I guessed at what you were 
going to say. Don Regan knows very little of your 
operation and that is just as well." By May 28, how-
ever, it was clear that "the votes were not there," and 
the reprogramming effort was dropped in favor of a 
campaign to obtain Congressional support for the 
$100 million aid package. '30 
Meanwhile, the concerns that prompted North's si-
lence at the May 16 NSPG meeting persisted: Who 
knew about the secret aid third countries had given

Chapter 3 
earlier? In the prior 2 years, members of the NSC 
staff had approached several countries for financial 
assistance to the Contras. Of these, two had provided 
funds or other forms of assistance. Those solicitations 
were made without the knowledge of the Secretary of 
State and other senior diplomatic officials. 
The December amendment expressly provided that 
soliticitations for humanitarian aid were not preclud-
ed. Now, Secretary Shultz and others were discussing 
making approaches to countries that had already con-
tributed. Poindexter and North became concerned 
that their prior actions would be uncovered. 
On June 10, North wrote Poindexter, "[A]t this 
point, I'm not sure who on our side knows what. 
Elliott has talked to Shultz and had prepared a paper 
re going to [Country 2 and Country 3] for contribu-
tions. Elliott called me and asked 'where to send the 
money." North asked Abrams to "keep quiet" until 
he talked to Poindexter. North added: 
At this point I need your help. As you know, I 
have the accounts and the means by which this 
thing needs to be accomplished. I have no idea 
what Shultz knows or doesn't know, but he 
could prove to be very unhappy if he learns of 
the [Country 2 and 3] aid that has been given in 
the past from someone other than you. Did RCM 
[McFarlane] ever tell Shultz. '31 
North recommended that Poindexter and McFar-
lane meet to discuss "how much Sec Shultz does or 
does not know abt [Country 2 and 3] so that we don't 
make any mistakes." 132 Poindexter declined to 
follow North's advice: "To my knowledge Shultz 
knows nothing about the prior financing. I think it 
should stay that way." '33 
Nonetheless, McFarlane informed Secretary Shultz. 
As the Secretary described the event, on June 16, 
1986, he received a telephone call on a secure phone 
from McFarlane, who had by then been out of the 
Government for approximately 6 months. In a con-
versation that occurred completely out of context and 
long after the donation had been made, McFarlane 
told Secretary Shultz about the Country 2 donation to 
the Contras.134 
Soon thereafter, Abrams recommended Brunei as a 
likely country from which to seek humanitarian assist-
ance for the Contras. As Poindexter put it, "[t]hey 
have lots of money." 135 Brunei also qualified for 
another reason. The Secretary of State did not want 
to be beholden to any country that was a recipient of 
U.S. aid.'36 Brunei was not. Originally, the Secretary 
of State was to make the approach during a meeting 
with the Sultan of Brunei in June. Before Secretary 
Shultz left, Abrams asked North for a Contra account 
to which the money could be sent. North directed his 
secretary to prepare an index card with the account 
number on it. North told Abrams that the account 
was controlled by the Contras and Abrams so in-
formed Secretary Shultz.'" Following Poindexter's 
instructions, North did not reveal that the NSC staff 
"had access to the accounts." 138 North gave the 
index card to Abrams, who gave it to the Secretary 
of State. The Secretary decided, however, that he 
would discuss the general issue of Central America 
with the Sultan but that he would not make an actual 
solicitation. The card was not used on that trip.'39 
On August 8, 1986, Abrams met in London with a 
representative of the Government of Brunei. In an 
unusual occurrence for Abrams, he traveled under an 
alias. The two men first met at a London hotel, then 
walked in a nearby park where Abrams requested $10 
million in bridge financing for the Contras. Asked by 
the official what Brunei would receive in return, 
Abrams responded, "Well, . . . the President will 
know of this, and you will have the gratitude of the 
Secretary and of the President for helping us out in 
this jam.''140 The official persisted, asking, "What 
concrete do we get out of this?" Abrams responded, 
"You don't get anything concrete out of it." Abrams 
then gave the account number that he had received 
from North to the Brunei official."' 
Although the Sultan of Brunei eventually trans-
ferred the $10 million, the funds never reached the 
account for which they were intended. North testified 
that he had intended to give Abrams the number of 
the Lake Resources account controlled by Secord and 
Hakim, but the account numbers had been inadvert-
ently transposed by North or by his secretary, Fawn 
Hal1.142 
Felix Rodriguez Becomes Disaffected 
Shortly after North traveled to Central America in 
late April 1986, Rodriguez decided to leave Central 
America. Rodriguez testified: "I don't know if I got a 
sixth feeling or something, but after I saw the people 
in there, I didn't feel comfortable with it and I 
thought we had better leave." Rodriguez informed 
Steele, citing fatigue as the reason for his depar-
ture.'43 
Rodriguez met with Vice President Bush in Wash-
ington on May 1. He had arranged the meeting 
through the Vice President's National Security Advis-
er, Donald Gregg. The appointment scheduling memo 
for the meeting states: "To brief the Vice President 
on the status of the war in [a Central American coun-
try] and resupply of the Contras." Members of the 
Vice President's staff gave conflicting testimony over 
how this description was printed on his schedule. Sam 
Watson, the Vice President's Deputy National Securi-
ty Adviser, testified that the memo was inaccurate, 
and that he did not provide the description. Phyllis 
Byrne, the secretary who typed the memo, testified 
that Watson had given her the description.'" 
In the Old Executive Office Building on his way to 
the Vice President's office, Rodriguez stopped by to 
tell North he was leaving the operation. Rodriguez

Chapter 3 
said North asked him to remain in Central America, 
but he ignored the request. Escorted by Gregg and 
Watson, Rodriguez then met with the Vice Presi-
dent.' 45 
Before Rodriguez could tell the Vice President that 
he was leaving Central America, North arrived and 
told the Vice President about the good job Rodriguez 
was doing. Embarrassed to tell the Vice President he 
was going to leave, Rodriguez left the meeting with-
out discussing his resignation, and eventually returned 
to Central America. Rodriguez testified that "at no 
point in any of this conversation did I ever mention 
doing anything that was remotely connected to Nica-
ragua and the contras." Moreover, former Senator 
Nicholas Brady, who was also present at the meeting, 
testified that the resupply operation was not dis-
cussed.146 
Rodriguez stayed in Central America, but his rela-
tionship with Dutton became increasingly strained. 
According to Dutton, they disagreed on how the 
operation should be run. At the same time, North had 
his own reservations that Rodriguez was "something 
of a loose cannon" who might reveal the oper-
ation.147 
On June 8, Dutton complained about Rodriguez in 
a KL-43 message to North: "He now wants a $10K 
emergency fund that he will control. He also wants 
partial control of our fuel fund ($50K)." Cash funds 
translated into unaccountable slush funds so far as 
Dutton was concerned. Furthermore, with the estab-
lishment of cash accounts, the resupply operation 
would be "losing control of one of the most critical 
portions of the operation, that is the money." 148 
Rodriguez was summoned to meet with North and 
Dutton in Washington on June 25. North began by 
showing Rodriguez the organizational plan drawn up 
by Dutton, in which Rodriguez was designated "liai-
son officer." After North stated that he had intelli-
gence that Rodriguez was compromising the oper-
ation by talking over open, unsecured telephone lines, 
Rodriguez complained that the poor condition of the 
aircraft, the communications equipment, and the lack 
of adequate radar had endangered the pilots and crew 
on the flight which hit the mountain, even though on 
that flight, despite the fog, the pilot was able to locate 
the drop zone by using the aircraft's radar. North, in 
turn, offered Rodriguez $3,000 a month to stay in the 
operation, which Rodriguez later accepted.'" 
Rodriguez testified that at the end of the meeting, 
he asked to see North alone. Rodriguez told North 
that he had learned "that people are stealing here," in 
particular Thomas Clines, a former associate of 
Edwin Wilson. Rodriguez expressed his concerns that 
arms were being sold at inflated prices. North disput-
ed Rodriguez's conclusions and told Rodriguez that 
Clines was a patriot, and that he was not buying 
equipment, only helping to transport the goods. In 
fact, none of the arms furnished to the FDN and the 
Southern front since Rodriguez became involved in 
72 
the operation were sold to the Contras. Instead, the 
Enterprise purchased arms with money obtained from 
the arms sales to Iran and private U.S. donors.15? 
At the close of the meeting, according to Rodri-
guez, North made one last comment. Congress was 
voting that day on the $100-million Contra aid legisla-
tion, and the television in North's office carried the 
floor debate. According to Rodriguez, North looked 
at the television and said: "Those people want me but 
they cannot touch me because the old man loves my 
ass." North did not recall that part of his conversation 
with Rodriguez. That meeting was the last between 
the two.151 
New Legislation 
On June 25, 1986 the House approved the Adminis-
tration's request for $100 million in Contra aid. Al-
though the bill would not become law for another 3 
months, the vote ensured passage of the Contra aid 
legislation. The President announced at 11:30 a.m. 
that day that the vote "signal[led] a new era of bipar-
tisan consensus in American foreign policy. . . . We 
can be proud that we as a people have embraced the 
struggle of the freedom fighters in Nicaragua. Today, 
their cause is our cause." 152 
The $100 million aid package marked the first time 
in more than 2 years that the House had voted to 
provide lethal assistance to the Contras. By June 
1986, North had established air resupply to both the 
Northern and Southern fronts. The Enterprise had 
succeeded in flying lethal material to the Contra fight-
ers inside Nicaragua; even Americans in the employ 
of North's organization were flying into that country, 
all financed by donated funds and proceeds from the 
Iranian arms sales overseen by North. None of 
North's activities were disclosed to Congress in ad-
vance of the House vote. Only 1 month later, before 
the aid bill had been signed, Poindexter would write 
to Congress that the NSC was complying with the 
letter and spirit of the Boland Amendment.' 53 
Selling the Assets to the CIA 
With the House vote in June, North's hopes to 
reengage the CIA in Nicaragua were on the verge of 
being realized. North was increasingly occupied with 
the Iran arms initiative, and he was anxious to give 
the Contra resupply operation back to the CIA. But 
North wanted the Enterprise to recoup its investment, 
and urged the CIA to buy the assets of the resupply 
operation in Central America.'" 
Secord had Dutton prepare a plan to present to the 
CIA. North wrote to Poindexter: 
We are rapidly approaching the point where the 
PROJECT DEMOCRACY [PRODEM] assets in 
CentAm need to be turned over to CIA for use 
in the new program. The total value of the assets 
(six aircraft, warehouses, supplies, maintenance

Chapter 3 
facilities, ships, boats, leased houses, vehicles, 
ordnance, munitions, communications equipment, 
and a 6520' runway on property owned by a 
PRODEM proprietary) is over $4.5M. 
All of the assets?and the personnel?are owned/ 
paid by overseas companies with no U.S. connec-
tion. All of the equipment is in first rate condi-
tion and is already in place. It wd be ludicrous 
for this to simply disappear just because CIA 
does not want to be "tainted" with picking up 
the assets and then have them spend $8-10M of 
the $100M to replace it?weeks or months later. 
Yet, that seems to be the direction they are head-
ing, apparently based on NSC guidance. 
If you have already given Casey instructions to 
this effect, I wd vy much like to talk to you 
about it in hopes that we can reclaim the issue. 
All seriously believe that immediately after the 
Senate vote the DRF [Nicaraguan Democratic 
Resistance] will be subjected to a major Sandi-
nista effort to break them before the U.S. aid can 
become effective. PRODEM currently has the 
only assets available to support the DRF and the 
CIA's most ambitious estimate is 30 days after a 
bill is signed before their own assets will be avail-
able. This will be a disaster for the DRF if they 
have to wait that long. North predicted "disas-
ter" if his plan was not followed.'" 
The plan drafted by Dutton at Secord's request 
offered two options. The first was to sell the assets of 
the organization to the CIA at cost; the second would 
continue the operation on behalf of the CIA for a 
monthly fee. Although Dutton, Secord, and North 
differed in their public testimony over whose idea it 
was to include these two options (and Secord denied 
that he ever authorized a sale of the assets), Dutton's 
plan contemplated that the Enterprise would continue 
in operation. The plan indicated a preference for a 
sale because the funds generated would permit the 
Enterprise to engage in other covert action projects: 
"[W]e prefer option I with the proceeds from the sale 
going back into a fund for continued similar require-
ments." 156 
North testified that the idea to sell the Enterprise's 
assets to the CIA was Director Casey's. In a PROF 
note to Poindexter at the time, North said that the 
sale to the CIA would be the only way to finance 
purchases for the Contras prior to the time the Con-
gressional appropriation became effective: 
Given our lack of movement on other funding 
options, and Elliot/[C/CATF's] plea for 
PRODEM [Project Democracy] to get food to 
the resistance ASAP, PRODEM will have to 
borrow at least $2M to pay for the food. That's 
O.K., and Dick is willing to do so tomorrow?
but only if there is reasonable assurance that the 
lenders can be repaid. The only way that the 
$2M in food money can be repaid is if CIA 
purchases the $4.5M worth of PRODEM equip-
ment for about $2.25M when the law passes. 
Concluding his efforts to "sell" the project, North 
offered to send Poindexter a copy of Dutton's "pro-
spectus," or, as he wrote, "the PROJECT DEMOC-
RACY status report. It is useful, nonattributable read-
ing." 167 
Poindexter responded that he had not given Casey 
any "guidance" against the sale and, indeed, that he 
approved of North's plan. Poindexter explained that 
he had told CIA Deputy Director Robert Gates "the 
private effort should be phased out," but he agreed 
with North and asked him to talk to Casey about the 
plan to sell Project Democracy to the CIA.' 58 
Clair George, the CIA Deputy Director for Oper-
ations, testified that North asked him to buy the air-
craft, but that he declined because their use in private 
resupply could result in criticism of the CIA. "I 
wouldn't buy those planes if they were the last three 
planes in Central America," he said.'" 
The Resupply Operation is Interrupted 
Relations between Felix Rodriguez and the resup-
ply operation continued to deteriorate. Tensions in-
creased when early in August a dispute erupted be-
tween Secord's deputy, Rafael Quintero, and Rodri-
guez. Ignoring Quintero's instructions not to use the 
aircraft, Rodriguez took an Enterprise-owned plane in 
Miami and flew into the Airbase with a load of spare 
parts and medicine. By the time Rodriguez arrived in 
Central America, Quintero was claiming that the 
plane had been stolen. Quintero gave instructions to 
refuel and send the plane back to Miami, full of the 
supplies. Rodriguez ignored the order and told the 
crew to unload." 6? 
Rodriguez maintained that all the aircraft belonged 
to the FDN, and expressed his concern to the Com-
mander that the Enterprise would pull out, taking the 
planes away from their rightful owners?the 
FDN.'" On August 6, Dutton called North to tell 
him that Rodriguez "took C-123K from Miami." 162 
North later complained to Gregg, the Vice Presi-
dent's National Security Adviser, that Rodriguez had 
"made off with an airplane," and asked him, "Will 
you call him and find out what the hell is going on?" 
Rodriguez told Gregg he had decided to tell Gregg 
"about what had been going on." 163 
Steele then called North to tell him that the "situa-
tion was not good." Steele warned North there was 
no one on the "scene who can take charge," and that 
the Commander was becoming a "potential problem" 
because he believed that the aircraft "belong[ed] to 
the DRF [Democratic Resistance Forces]." Steele 
added that Rodriguez was "enroute to see Don 
[Gregg]."' 64

Chapter 3 
North sent his colleague and aide, Lt. Col. Robert 
Earl, to sit in on the Rodriguez-Gregg meeting. Brief-
ing Earl before the meeting, North portrayed Rodri-
guez as someone who had "insinuated himself into the 
organization and was giving rudder orders and it was 
not his place to do so." 165 
In the dispute with Rodriguez, Quintero had also 
accused Rodriguez of air piracy. Now, after confer-
ring with Rodriguez, the Commander understood that 
he too was accused of air piracy, and feared the 
aircraft themselves would be taken. 
On August 8, Rodriguez met with Gregg and set 
out his allegations about the Secord group. Gregg 
noted the points Rodriguez made: "using Ed Wilson 
group for supplies"; "Felix used by 011ie to get 
Contra plane repaired . . ."; "a swap of weapons for $ 
was arranged to get aid for Contras, Clines and Gen-
eral Secord tied in"; "Hand grenades bought for $3 - 
sold for $9." Gregg, according to Earl, expressed 
shock about the involvement of Clines.166 
On August 12, Gregg convened a meeting to dis-
cuss Rodriguez's allegations with a group of Adminis-
tration officials involved in Central American policy-
making: Steele; Ambassador Edwin Corr; Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of State Walker; the Chief of the 
Central American Task Force; and from the NSC, 
Earl and Ray Burghardt. Gregg testified that he 
"went over the notes with the people who were 
there." Without mentioning North's involvement, 
Gregg emphasized that he considered Clines not reli-
able but that he had faith in Rodriguez.167 
Gregg knew by this time that North was involved 
in the operation. Rodriguez had made that clear at his 
initial August 8 meeting, and Gregg's notes reflect 
that knowledge.'" Gregg testified that at no time did 
he pass that information on to the Vice President. 
Gregg did not report the meeting, because he be-
lieved it "was a very murky business. . . . We had 
never discussed the Contras. We had no responsibility 
for it. We had no expertise in it. I wasn't at all certain 
what this amounted to. . . . I felt I had passed along 
that material to the organizations who could do some-
thing about it, and I frankly did not think it was Vice 
Presidential level." 169 
The Resupply Operation Resumes 
Shortly after Gregg's August 12 meeting, Steele 
was scheduled to meet with Dutton in Washington to 
resolve the dispute with the Commander. Dutton had 
told Steele by KL-43 that "It is everyone's intent to 
continue to support the effort," but that the aircraft 
were owned by an independent company, not the 
FDN, in part so they could be used to support the 
Southern front forces as well as the FDN. Secord, 
too, insisted that the aircraft belonged to a private 
company. Earl, North's deputy, told Secord by KL-
43 on August 13 that the crew should simply pull out 
because the threat of a lawsuit against the Command-
74 
er had "poisoned the atmosphere." Secord responded 
that there was more than "1 million dollars worth 
equipment" in Central America owned by the Enter-
prise, which had no intention of abandoning them. 
Secord explained that the "threat of air piracy lawsuit 
has nothing to do with [the Commander]. This was 
comment made to VP by 011ie ref Max [Felix Rodri-
guez] vice [the Commander]." 170 
Dutton later met with Steele in Washington and by 
the end of the meeting, Steele had agreed to help to 
solve the brewing "confrontation" between the Com-
mander and the resupply operation.'" 
The warring parties reached an uneasy resolution 
after Steele returned to Central America. Steele took 
a more active role in overseeing the flights and was 
told to inform the Commander that, while the assets 
were made available to the Contra cause, they be-
longed to a private company whose desire was to 
turn them over to the CIA once the Agency resumed 
Contra support. Steele felt that he would have trouble 
persuading the Commander to accept this position 
until he was assured that the CIA would continue to 
provide support.172 
On August 22, Dutton was able to reassure Steele: 
Received new guidance through Goode [North] 
from his boss. We are to stay in full operation 
supporting the drops until 1 Oct. At that time 
NSC says that CIA will have been in operation 
approx. 1 month. The CIA will go to [The Cen-
tral American government] and explain that they, 
the CIA, are now in contro1.1" 
During the fall of 1986, problems continued in the 
resupply operation, but some success on both the 
Northern and Southern fronts was finally achieved. 
The resupply operation delivered more than 180,000 
pounds of lethal supplies to the Southern front in 
September alone.17 4 
In late August, North attended a Restricted Inter-
agency Group meeting at which the Chief of the 
CATF and others were asked what steps the airlift?
i.e., according to North, the "covert operation being 
conducted by this government to support the Nicara-
guan Resistance"?should take now that the CIA was 
due to assume control. According to North, he de-
scribed at that meeting the activities in which the 
Enterprise was engaged and sought approval from the 
Restricted Interagency Group to continue until the 
CIA could take over.175 While the Chief of CATF 
acknowledged that North discussed airdrops to the 
Contras, he testified that he did not recall North dis-
cussing "his full service covert action program."76 
On August 22, Dutton met with Quintero and de-
vised a new plan for Southern front resupply that he 
presented to North: The initial arrival over the drop 
zone should be at dusk; once the zone has been identi-
fied by the pilots, repeated sequential drops would be 
made in the evening without communication to the

Chapter 3 
troops. Castillo agreed with the plan, as did Steele. 
North also approved it.177 
On September 4, North met with Poindexter. North 
asked Poindexter for the "go/no go" on sequential air 
deliveries to the Southern forces. Shortly afterwards, 
North told Secord to implement the new drop plan 
and conduct a "force feed" operation to the South 
where all supplies would be delivered sequentially in 
accordance with Dutton's plan.178 
On September 9, Dutton flew with the crew in the 
second C-123 (now operational) inside southern Nica-
ragua to attempt a lethal drop to the troops Castillo 
had identified. But this mission was unable to locate 
the troops, prompting Dutton to propose to North 
using two aircraft on each mission to increase deliv-
ery potential once troops were located and to protect 
against increased Sandinista antiaircraft fire. Dutton 
also asked North for help on weather information and 
troop location. North approved the use of two air-
craft and told Dutton to obtain weather information 
from Steele, and that he would speak to Castillo 
about troop locations. North cautioned Dutton not to 
personally fly inside Nicaragua again: The operation 
could not afford the exposure if the plane were shot 
down inside Nicaragua with Col. Robert Dutton at 
the controls.179 
The pace of delivery stepped up. The resupply op-
eration was finally becoming effective only weeks 
before the CIA would be back in the business. On 
September 11, a lethal drop was successfully made to 
the South using the C-123 while the C-7 delivered 
more arms for the FDN in the northern regions. 
Dutton reported the success of the southern delivery 
to North. On the 12th, three aircraft made more de-
liveries: a C-123 delivered 10,000 pounds to the South 
and a C-7 and a Maule delivered to the FDN. Sep-
tember 13 was "a red letter day," Dutton wrote to 
North. All five aircraft flew at the same time, with 
lethal loads dropped in both the North and South. 
"The surge is now in full force," Dutton relayed to 
North. The plan at last was working.180 
Things were going so well that Dutton advised 
North that an additional $20,000 in cash was needed 
for the fuel fund and that the "C-123 is now armed 
with HK-21/7.62 machine gun on the aft ramp, bring 
on the MI-24." In fact, before Dutton returned to 
Washington, he could report to North that "all troops 
should now have equipment. Will stand by for direc-
tion from [Castillo]. He already told us not to send 
any more to [a Southern commandante] for a while. 
Never thought we would hear that." 181 
The "hand-to-mouth" operation that had limped 
along on limited resources for so long had, with the 
support of certain individuals, finally delivered the 
goods. Under North's direction, Dutton's operational 
control, Castillo's critical assistance in locating, dis-
patching, and scheduling the needs of the Southern 
troops, and Steele's coordination with the Command-
er, the South received arms, while deliveries contin-
ued apace to the FDN in the North. Indeed, for the 
rest of September, lethal drops were successfully 
made to both the FDN and the Southern forces. 
North duly reported the operation's success to Poin-
dexter.182 
When Dutton returned from Central America later 
that month, he met with North. North asked him to 
arrange a 1-day trip to the region so that he could 
personally thank the pilots and crew. North told him, 
"Bob, you will never get a medal for this, but some 
day the President will shake your hand and thank you 
for it."183 
Dutton had also prepared a photograph album de-
picting the operation: the operational bases, drop 
zones, aircraft, munitions, and the crew replete with 
assault machine guns and other assorted weapons. 
Dutton showed the album to North, who liked it and 
said he wanted to show it to "the top boss."84 North 
testified that he sent the album to Poindexter to show 
to the President, but never heard further about the 
album. Poindexter testified that he did not show the 
album to the President.185 
North Expands His Special Operations 
Even with the $100 million in appropriated funds 
becoming available in the near future, North tried to 
get other aid for the Contras. In May, Israeli Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin had offered to provide Israeli 
military advisers for the Southern front. Although 
nothing came of this offer, North and Rabin met 
again in September and discussed an Israeli transfer of 
Soviet bloc weapons to the Contras. Rabin wanted 
"to know if we had any need for SovBloc weaps and 
ammo he could make avail." Rabin asked whether 
North's ship, the Erria, had left the Mediterranean. 
When North responded that it was in Lisbon, Rabin 
suggested that it dock at Haifa and "have it filled w/ 
whatever they cd assemble" of a "recently seized 
PLO shipment captured at sea." '86 
Poindexter sanctioned the Israeli arms offer: "I 
think you should go ahead and make it happen. It can 
be a private deal between Dick [Secord] and Rabin 
that we bless. . . . Keep the pressure on Bill [Casey] 
to make things right for Secord." Later, Poindexter 
cautioned "[a]bsolutely nobody else should know 
about this. Rabin should not say anything to anybody 
else except you or me." On September 15, North told 
Poindexter that "orders were passed to the ship this 
morning to proceed to Haifa to pick up the arms. 
Loading will be accomplished by Israeli military per-
sonnel." 187 
Despite Poindexter's caution, North later recounted 
the offer in a memorandum briefing the President for 
a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. 
North wrote that Prime Minister Peres was likely to 
raise certain sensitive issues, such as the transfer of 
Soviet bloc arms by the Israelis "for use by the Nica-
raguan democratic resistance." North recommended:

1

Chapter 3 
"If Peres raises this issue, it would be helpful if the 
President thanked him since the Israelis hold consid-
erable stores of bloc ordinance compatible with what 
the Nicaraguan resistance now uses." Next to this 
sentence, Poindexter penciled: "Rabin. Very tightly 
held."188 
As another expansion of his special operations, 
North received an offer from a third party to engage 
in sabatoge and other activities inside Nicaragua, to 
be financed with Enterprise funds. Poindexter ap-
proved the sabatoge plan, but instructed North not to 
become involved in conspiracy or assassinations.189 
According to North, the plan was never implemented 
because North was dismissed.19? 
The Operation Begins to Unravel: 
Disclosure of the Airstrip 
Along with others in the Administration, North had 
helped to prevent the disclosure of his operation to 
Congress. The extent of his involvement in Central 
America, however, made him open to exposure. Al-
though the U.S. Congress was not told of North's 
role in supporting the Contras, Central American 
governments?including that in Managua?were 
aware of it. Eventually, one of those governments 
chose not to remain silent. 
Early in the morning on September 6, North 
learned that a Costa Rican official was threatening to 
hold a press conference announcing the existence of 
the Santa Elena airfield and alleging violations of 
Costa Rican law by North, Secord, and Udall Re-
sources. North immediately called Assistant Secretary 
Abrams and told him that the press conference had to 
be stopped. Half an hour later, North had reached 
Ambassador Tambs and placed a conference call to 
Abrams.191 
President Arias was scheduled to visit the United 
States, and Abrams "instructed Tambs to advert to 
the visit in a way which made it clear to President 
Arias that his visit was at risk." Abrams testified, "It 
was supposed to be diplomatic, but the message was 
supposed to be clear." North's notes reflect the idea 
of a greater threat than the cancellation of a White 
House visit: "Conf. call to Elliott Abrams and Amb. 
Lew Tambs; -Tell Arias; -Never set foot in W.H.; - 
Never get 5 [cents] of $80M promised by McPher-
son." An hour or two later, Tambs had made the call 
(but did not threaten the cutoff of aid), and the press 
conference was cancelled.192 
In his report to Poindexter, North exaggerated his 
own role in the crisis. In a PROF note, North told 
Poindexter he had personally forestalled the crisis by 
calling the President of Costa Rica and threatening to 
cut off aid. North conceded to Poindexter that he 
may have overstepped the bounds of his authority: "I 
recognize that I was well beyond my charter in deal-
ing with a head of state this way and in making 
76 
threats/offers that may be impossible to deliver." 
Poindexter responded: "Thanks, 011ie, you did the 
right thing, but let's try to keep it quiet." North 
admitted in his testimony that he had not called Presi-
dent Arias. He claimed, instead, that the PROF mes-
sage "was specifically cast the way it was to protect 
the other two parties engaged." 193 
The Costa Rican officials were delayed but not 
deterred by the call. On September 25, Costa Rican 
authorities held a press conference announcing the 
discovery of a "secret airstrip in Costa Rica that was 
over a mile long and which had been built and used 
by a Co. called Udall Services for supporting the 
Contras." Olmstead was named as the man who set 
up the airfield as a "training base for U.S. military 
advisors."194 
North offered a "damage assessment" to Poin-
dexter, assuring him that "all appropriate damage con-
trol measures" had been undertaken to "keep USG 
[U.S. Government] fingerprints off this." He wrote to 
Poindexter: 
Udall Resources, Inc., S.A. is a proprietary of 
Project Democracy. It will cease to exist by 
noon today. There are no USG fingerprints on 
any of the operation and Olmstead is not the 
name of the agent?Olmstead does not exist. We 
have removed all Udall Resources . . . to another 
account in Panama, where Udall maintained an 
answering service and cover office. The office is 
now gone as are all files and paperwork.' 95 
The New York Times picked up the story. North, 
with assistance from Abrams and others, drafted press 
guidance for the Administration's response. The 
"guidance," approved by Poindexter, stated that the 
airstrip had been offered to the Costa Rican Govern-
ment "by the owners of the property who had appar-
ently decided to abandon plans for a tourism project." 
It concluded: "No U.S. Government funds were allo-
cated or used in connection with this site nor were 
any U.S. Government personnel involved in its con-
struction. Any further inquiries should be referred to 
the Government of Costa Rica." The U.S. Govern-
ment's role in facilitating the construction of the air-
field was concealed.196 
At the same time North was promoting this cover 
story, he suggested to Poindexter that steps be taken 
to "punish" the Costa Rican Government for the dis-
closure.'97 
On September 30, North again argued that any 
attempt to benefit President Arias should be quashed: 
"Those who counsel such a course of action are un-
aware of the strategic importance of the air facility at 
Santa Elena and the damage caused by the Arias' 
government revelations." 198

Chapter 3 
The Covert Operation Ends 
The triumph of the airlift was short-lived. When Bill 
Cooper wrote to Dutton in late September after an-
other successful drop, "Ho-Hum, just another day at 
the office," Dutton warned him to be careful.'29 
On October 5, a C-123 left the Airbase at 9:50 a.m. 
local time with 10,000 pounds of ammunition for a 
drop to the FDN inside Nicaragua. Cooper was in 
command, Buzz Sawyer the co-pilot, and Eugene Ha-
senfus the loadmaster who would actually drop the 
supplies. An FDN fighter was also on board for radio 
communications to the troops on the ground. Al-
though the mission was to support the northern FDN 
forces, the plane flew a southern route to avoid San-
dinista guns.20? 
First reports had the plane missing. Castillo sent 
Southern front troops to look for the plane and 
Dutton notified North's office in an attempt to mount 
a search operation. Earl attempted to arrange for a 
U.S. military search and rescue mission, while friend-
ly governments in the region also organized a discreet 
search effort. Felix Rodriguez called the Vice Presi-
dent's Deputy National Security Adviser at his home, 
telling him the plane could not be found. It was all to 
no avail: the plane had been hit by a Sandinista SAM-
7 over Nicaraguan territory. Three crew members 
were killed. Only Hasenfus survived, captured by the 
Sandinistas.201 
Abrams called North and asked him to arrange to 
retrieve the bodies. The State Department issued 
press statements claiming no U.S. involvement in the 
mission.202 
But the Enterprise had begun to unravel. The 
bodies of the crew were found bearing Southern Air 
Transport identification cards. The Federal Aviation 
Administration and the U.S. Customs Service began 
to investigate. With secrecy no longer possible, the 
resupply operation was shut down.203 
Presidential Authorization and 
Knowledge 
The President told the Tower Review Board that he 
did not know that the NSC staff was assisting the 
Contras.204 After the Tower Report was issued, the 
President stated that private support for the Contras 
was "my idea." 205 In fact, the President knew of the 
contributions from Country 2.206 According to Poin-
dexter, the President's policy was "to get what sup-
port we could from third countries." 207 
In general, Poindexter understood that the Presi-
dent wanted the NSC staff to support the Contras, 
including encouraging private contributions. The 
President also knew, according to Poindexter, that 
North was the chief staff officer on Central America 
who was responsible for carrying out the President's 
general charter to keep the Contras alive. Poindexter 
regularly reported to the President on the status of 
the Contras, the fact that they were surviving, and 
"in general terms" North's role in facilitating their 
survival. As a result of these briefings, Poindexter 
thought that the President understood that both he 
and North were coordinating the effort to support the 
Contras. Poindexter also believed the President under-
stood that "Col. North was instrumental in keeping 
the Contras supported without maybe understanding 
the details of exactly was he was doing." 208 
As to the level of detail provided to the President 
on the Contra support operation, Poindexter testified 
that he: 
would not get into details with the President as 
to who was doing what. The President knew that 
there was a Boland Amendment, he knew there 
were restrictions on the government. As he has 
said, I think, since November of 1986, that he did 
not feel that the Boland Amendment applied to 
his personal staff and that that was his feeling all 
along. I knew that. 
He knew the Contras were being supported, and 
we simply didn't get into the details of exactly 
who was doing what.2" 
Poindexter testified that on one occasion, he briefed 
the President with some specificity about the Contra 
support program, but understood that the President 
did not recall the briefing: 
Now, you know, the President doesn't recall ap-
parently a specific briefing in which I laid out in 
great detail all of the ways that we were going 
about implementing the President's policy, and I 
frankly don't find that surprising. It would not, 
frankly, at the time have been a matter of great 
interest as to exactly how we were implementing 
the President's policy.210 
Without getting to the "extraneous ? detail[s]" of 
how the President's policy was being implemented, 
however, Poindexter briefed the President on the 
Santa Elena airstrip in Costa Rica. Poindexter testified 
that in December 1985, after he returned from Central 
America, he specifically briefed the President about 
the local assistance provided in establishing the air-
strip. In addition, Poindexter informed the President 
that the "private individuals" were also involved in 
establishing the airstrip. At the same time, Poindexter 
excluded the "extraneous detail" that North, through 
Tambs and Castillo, had facilitated the construction of 
the airstrip.211 Similarly, while Poindexter thought 
that the President was aware of North's role in sup-
porting the Contras, "it did not include something as 
specific as directing Col. North to conduct air supply 
operations." 212 North testified that he believed that 
the President approved his efforts to resupply the 
war. In fact, his actions support that belief. While

Chapter 3 
Poindexter testified that he did not show the photo-
graph album detailing the operation to the President, 
North testified that he sent the album to the President 
through Poindexter and told Dutton that the Presi-
dent would thank Dutton for his efforts. 
Conclusion 
Although the North-Secord resupply operation ended 
on a disastrous note, with the shooting down of the 
Hasenfus plane, North had successfully managed, 
with the approval of his superiors, the covert pro-
gram to assist the Contras for almost 2 years. The 
covert program that North had developed inevitably 
created conflicts of loyalties and shadings of duties 
among the persons whom he coopted to assist him. 
Felix Rodriguez was a close associate of Donald 
Gregg, the National Security Adviser to the Vice 
President. Yet North instructed Rodriguez not to tell 
Gregg that he was secretly working for North, and 
Rodriguez testified that he complied until the summer 
of 1986.213 According to North, Director Casey 
wanted to insulate the CIA's career employees from 
North's operation so that the CIA could not be 
charged with a violation of the Boland Amend-
ment.2" CIA officials admitted that, far from their 
traditional role, they "actively shunned information. 
We did not want to know how the Contras were 
being funded . . . we actively discouraged people 
from telling us things." 215 
78 
The CIA's attempt to remain uninformed failed as 
North sought out the assistance of CIA personnel in 
Central America. Particularly after Congress amended 
the law to allow the CIA to exchange intelligence 
with the Contras, many flights undertaken by the 
Enterprise were reported by CIA field offices to CIA 
headquarters; and at least one CIA Chief of Station 
provided information necessary for the Enterprise to 
make accurate airdrops and avoid Sandinista fire. 
A CIA Chief of Station, the U.S. Ambassador to 
Costa Rica, and other operatives?both Government 
employees and private citizens?that North recruited 
with the approval of his superiors provided necessary 
support to his covert program of military support for 
the Contras. Yet throughout this time, the NSC staff 
repeatedly assured Congress that it was complying 
with the letter and spirit of the Boland Amendment. 
The NSC staff's resupply operation provided essen-
tial support to the Contras' during 1986. Not only did 
North coordinate that effort, but he decided with 
Secord, after consulting the Contras' military com-
manders, what supplies were needed in order to con-
duct the entire Contra operation, both on the ground 
and in the air. 
North directed the Enterprise's efforts on behalf of 
the Contras with Poindexter's approval and in the 
belief that the President likewise concurred. The 
result was that, with the help of other U.S. Govern-
ment officials, North managed to provide to the Con-
tras what Congress had not: a full-scale program of 
military assistance.

this political context for the contribution from Country 
Three: "In October 1985 when the NSC staff was schedul-
ing an appointment for Colonel North to meet with one of 
these countries that later contributed $2 million, I was in-
volved in a tough legislative battle in this House. On Octo-
ber 12, I believe, of 1985, this House passed a textile bill, 
very controversial. At that very time, Colonel North appar-
ently was soliciting, from a nation that was impacted by this 
bill, funds secretly and that country later delivered $2 mil-
lion, according to the testimony. The President vetoed that 
bill in December 1985 and between December 1985 and 
August 1986, when the Congress decided to sustain the 
President by an eight-vote margin, there were entreaties 
apparently made to many other nations that were impacted 
by this legislation." McFarlane 100-2, at 279.

66. At the end of December 1985, Steele called North to 
report that all was "OK" on final flight arrangements at the 
Airbase and that fuel for the aircraft had to be handled on a 
"pay as you go" basis. On January 6, North talked to Steele 
about problems with Felix Rodriguez, including security 
concerns and Rodroguez' ties to an arms dealer connected 
to the military of a Central American country. Despite 
various organizational problems, Steele called North a week 
later to report significant progress. The Commander was 
now "fully aboard." The building construction for a ware-
house was underway, and all that was needed was money to 
pay for the fuel. On January 16, North discussed with 
Steele the 3 Butler buildings Gadd was constructing and 
operational security at the Airbase. North talked to Steele 
again on January 20 concerning additional operational prob-
lems and determined (apparently after a call from the Chief 
of the CATF) that flight planning data for resupply aircraft 
should be passed to Steele for local coordination. North

North continued to hope, up through September, that the 
assets could be sold. On Sept. 3 or 4, North met with 
Ambassador Tambs and told him that he wanted to sell the 
assets because the Freedom Fighters were out of money. 
North hoped to raise about $5 million. Tambs was skeptical. 
He knew that the Costa Rican Government closed down 
the airstrip. Tambs asked North: "How could you sell 
something which you couldn't use?" North did not reply.

Private Fundraising: The Channell-Miller 
Operation 
While donations from other countries and profits from 
the Iran arms sales provided most of the money for 
lethal assistance to the Contras after the Boland 
Amendment, the network of private foundations and 
organizations formed by Carl R. "Spitz" Channell and 
Richard R. Miller also played a role. Channell's prin-
cipal organization, the tax-exempt National Endow-
ment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL), used 
White House briefings and private meetings with the 
President to raise more than $10 million from private 
contributors, almost all for the Contra cause. Over 
half of this total came from two elderly widows?
Barbara Newington and Ellen Garwood?who made 
the bulk of their contributions after receiving private 
and emotional presentations by Lt. Col. Oliver North 
on the Contras' cause and military needs. One dozen 
contributors accounted for 90 percent of NEPL's 
funds in 1985 and 1986. 
Of the $10 million that was raised, only approxi-
mately $4.5 million was funnelled to, or spent on 
behalf of, the Contras, including more than $1 million 
for political advertising and lobbying. The rest was 
retained by Miller and Channell for salaries, fees, and 
expenses incurred by their organizations, including 
compensation to their associates, David Fischer and 
Martin Artiano. 
The NEPL money spent for direct and indirect 
assistance to the Contras was disbursed primarily by 
Miller at the direction of North. Approximately $1.7 
million was "washed" by Channell through Miller's 
domestic and Cayman Island entities?International 
Business Communications (IBC) and I.C., Inc.?to the 
Enterprise, where it was commingled with funds from 
third-country contributions and the Iranian arms sale. 
Another $1 million was passed at the direction of 
North through Miller's entities to accounts controlled 
by Adolfo Calero, and approximately $500,000 was 
distributed at North's request to other persons and 
entities engaged in activities relating to the Contras. 
Channell and Miller made elaborate efforts to con-
ceal the nature of their fundraising activities and 
North's role. Certain funds received by NEPL for 
Contra assistance were allocated on Channell's books 
to a project denominated "Toys," a euphemism for 
weapons. The NEPL and IBC employees were in-
structed to refer to North by a code name, "Green." 
Funds were transferred to the Contras, not directly?
which would be traceable?but through Miller's 
anonymous offshore entity, I.C., Inc. North misrepre-
sented to several White House officials the nature of 
the network's fundraising activities. For instance, the 
President apparently was led to believe that the funds 
were being raised for political advertising; the Presi-
dent's Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, was deliberately 
kept in the dark by North and Admiral John Poin-
dexter; and North misrepresented to Congress and 
White House personnel the nature of his involvement 
in the activities of NEPL and IBC. As a result, the 
network was able to operate successfully until the 
latter part of 1986, when increased Government aid to 
the Contras and public disclosure of both the Iranian 
arms sales and the Contra resupply network made 
further assistance efforts unnecessary and unwise. 
By using a tax-exempt organization to funnel 
money to the Contras?for arms and other purposes?
Channell and Miller provided tax deductions to 
donors. As a result, the U.S. Government effectively 
subsidized a portion of contributions intended for 
lethal aid to the Contras. In the spring of 1986, Chan-
nell and Miller pled guilty to criminal tax charges of 
conspiring to defraud "the United States Treasury of 
revenues to which it was entitled by subverting and 
corrupting the lawful purposes . . . of NEPL by using 
NEPL . . . to solicit contributions to purchase mili-
tary and other non-humanitarian aid for the Contras." 
At his plea hearing, Channell identified Miller and 
North as his co-conspirators. 
The Background 
Carl R. "Spitz" Channel! 
Channell, 42, was raised in Elkton, West Virginia. 
He attended American University from 1963 to 1968 
and then, for a brief period, the Union Theological 
Seminary in Virginia. He left to join the Army and, 
after service for 3 years, received an honorable dis-
charge.3 
In 1976, Channell began to work for Terry Dolan, 
the founder of the National Conservative Political 
Action Committee (NCPAC). His initial responsibility 
was assisting in Congressional campaigns. After the

Chapter 4 
1978 elections, Dolan asked Channell to shift to fund-
raising. To Channell's own surprise, he was an instant 
success, and was named by Dolan as NCPAC's first 
national finance chairman. In that position, Channell 
concentrated on NCPAC's "high dollar donor pro-
gram" and set up a number of briefings in Washington 
for potentially large contributors.2 This fundraising 
method was to become the standard operating proce-
dure for the Channell-Miller network. 
In 1982, Channell left NCPAC to form his own 
political consulting organization, the Channell Corpo-
ration, to offer fundraising advice to campaigns and 
candidates. By 1984, he began to establish a network 
of other politically-oriented foundations. First, he 
founded the American Conservative Trust (ACT) as a 
Political Action Committee (PAC). At approximately 
the same time, he incorporated NEPL and sought 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recognition of NEPL 
as a tax-exempt foundation under Section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code.3 
In its application for tax-exempt status, NEPL as-
serted that it was formed "to educate members of the 
general public on American political systems and soci-
etal institutions." The application further stated that 
this education was to be accomplished through the 
study of the development of American political sys-
tems and the influence of such systems on societal 
institutions in the United States. NEPL indicated to 
the IRS that it would collect information on these 
topics, make that information available to the general 
public, and eventually conduct seminars.4 
On December 12, 1984, the IRS issued a determina-
tion letter stating that, based on the information con-
tained in NEPL's application and assuming that its 
operations would be consistent with the program out-
lined in the application, NEPL qualified as an exempt 
organization under Section 501(c)(3).5* 
According to Channell, when he formed NEPL in 
late 1984, most "Washington insiders" doubted that 
anyone could raise money to advance foreign policy. 
Channell, however, believed that he could succeed 
because his major donors were committed to Presi-
*Channell formed additional entities between 1983 and 1986. The 
American Conservative Trust State Election Fund (ACT-SEF) was 
formed as a state PAC to take advantage of state laws allowing 
corporate contributions to such entities. "Sentinel" was formed in 
1983 as a lobbying organization under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax 
code. The "American Conservative Foundation," a 501(c)(3) corpo-
ration also established in 1983, was intended to focus on issues that 
were "more worldwide in scope and interest" than NEPL. The 
"Anti-Terrorism American Committee" (ATAC) was formed in 
1986 as a PAC focusing on "congressional attitudes toward terror-
ism and policies associated with terrorism." "Grow Washington" 
and "Hill Potomac" were corporations established to pursue specif-
ic initiatives that, according to Channell, never materialized. Those 
entities have therefore remained inactive and unfunded. In 1986, 
Channell assumed control of another conservative organization, 
Western Goals, which had been established by the late Representa-
tive Larry McDonald. Channell Dep., 9/1/87, at 62-66.

dent Reagan and his philosophy toward foreign af-
fairs. 6 
At first, NEPL concentrated on raising funds to 
publicize "European issues," e.g., SALT, summits, 
and nuclear freeze proposals. In January 1985, after 
NEPL ran a large newspaper advertisement congratu-
lating President Reagan on his inauguration, Channell 
received a call from Edie Fraser of the public rela-
tions firm, Miner & Fraser. According to Channell, 
Fraser indicated that she admired the ad and asked 
for NEPL's assistance in organizing and promoting a 
fundraising dinner for the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund 
(NRF). This was Channell's introduction to the Con-
tras' cause.7 
To assist him, Channell recruited Daniel Conrad, a 
fundraising consultant from San Francisco, with 
whom Channell had dealt on earlier occasions. 
Conrad came to Washington, and together he and 
Channell initiated NEPL's involvement in the Nicara-
guan issue.8 
Daniel L. Conrad 
Conrad, 44, received a bachelors degree in English 
and Political Science from Northwestern University 
in 1965. He also did graduate work in philosophy and 
business at Northwestern and the University of Michi-
gan.3 In the late 1960s, after short stints as a manage-
ment trainee at Ford Motor Company and a fundrais-
er for Northwestern, Conrad joined Harvey Fundrais-
ing Management of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as a field 
director for campaigns. 
In the early 1970s, after a brief career as a stock-
broker, Conrad started his own firm, the Institute for 
Fundraising, in San Francisco. It was a sole propri-
etorship that presented seminars, produced manuals, 
and offered consulting services in the field of fund-
raising." 
In the late 1970s, Conrad incorporated his business 
as Public Management Institute (PMI), which evolved 
from a training and consulting services firm to one 
primarily engaged in the publishing of periodicals and 
reference materials on financial grants and capital 
campaigns. Conrad himself continued, however, to 
consult on fundraising matters.12 
Conrad first met Channell in 1978 or 1979 at a 
seminar on fundraising being taught by Conrad in 
Alexandria, Virginia. After their initial meeting, 
Channell called Conrad periodically for informal 
advice on fundraising. In 1983 or 1984, Channell hired 
Conrad as a consultant to advise him on how to build 
a political consulting business, an assignment that 
lasted approximately 1 week.13 
Given Channell's history of looking to Conrad for 
advice, it was natural for Channell to ask Conrad to 
assist him in fundraising for the Contras?even 
though Conrad had never been involved in political 
fundraising and had no particular interest in the Nica-
raguan issue." Their financial arrangement was never

formalized. According to Conrad, Channell just gave 
him money periodically. For his efforts on the NRF 
dinner, for example, Conrad recalls receiving $10,000 
or $15,000 from Channell, $10,000 from the NRF, and 
$1,500 from Miner & Fraser. After that time, Con-
rad's compensation "kept changing," with Channell 
deciding at various intervals how much to pay him. 
According to Conrad, he signed on with Channell's 
organizations more as a matter of friendship than as a 
matter of business. i5 
Although Conrad had no formal position or title, 
he served initially as the number two person in each 
of Channell's organizations. Channell eventually gave 
him the title, "Executive Director."18 
When Conrad joined Channell, the common offices 
for Channell's various entities were in a small town-
house at 305 4th Street, NE, in Washington, D.C. 
Later, in August 1986, as money from Contra donors 
rolled in, they moved to luxurious and spacious new 
quarters in National Place, 1331 Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C., and hired additional 
staff and fundraisers. 
Lines of authority in Channell's organization were 
informal. Fundraisers reported either to Conrad or 
Channell, who shared responsibility for training them. 
Channell, however, was generally in charge of pre-
paring the script to be used for soliciting prospective 
donors. '7 
Richard R. Miller and IBC 
Miller, 35, received a bachelors degree in 1976 from 
the University of Maryland. During parts of 1979 and 
1980, he served as director of broadcast services for 
the Reagan campaign. William Casey, Director of the 
1980 Presidential campaign, furloughed him when 
funds ran short but then rehired him. During the 
furlough, Miller formed Ram Communications, a 
short-lived public relations firm.18 
After the 1980 election, Miller served on the transi-
tion team and then briefly as special assistant to the 
director of public affairs in the Department of Trans-
portation. From February 1981 to February 1983, he 
was chief of news and public affairs for the Agency 
for International Development (AID). He was then 
promoted to public affairs director at AID, where he 
remained until 1984.19 
Upon leaving AID, Miller established IBC as a sole 
proprietorship to engage in media relations, strategic 
planning for public affairs, political analysis, and exec-
utive branch liaison. In 1984, he began to work with 
Francis Gomez who recently had left his position as 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in the 
State Department. Miller had first met Gomez in Feb-
ruary 1982.20 
Immediately upon leaving the State Department in 
February 1984, Gomez received a contract from the 
State Department to assist its newly formed Office of 
Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbe-
an (S/LPD) with public relations advice and support. 
The original purchase order for the contract specified 
that Gomez was to write talking point papers on 
Central America, prepare speaker kits, identify and 
refute distortions and false allegations regarding U.S. 
policy, draft sample speeches, prepare op-ed pieces 
and feature articles, assist Central American refugees 
and exiles visiting Washington, arrange media events 
for them, and make them available for Congressional 
interviews.21 
This contract was renewed with Gomez in May 
1984 and then assumed by IBC in August or Septem-
ber 1984. Before it terminated in September 1986 after 
several renewals, Gomez and IBC received a total of 
$441,084 from the State Department.22* 
By mid-1984, with the assumption of the State De-
partment contract, IBC was functioning as an infor-
mal partnership between Miller and Gomez, even 
though Gomez was technically a subcontractor to 
IBC. At a later time, Miller and Gomez would each 
establish personal corporations?Miller Communica-
tions, Inc. and Gomez International, Inc.?and, effec-
tive January 1, 1986, would restructure IBC into a 
partnership of those two entities. There is not, howev-
er, any written partnership agreement.23** 
In September 1984, IBC also began to represent one 
of Adolfo Calero's organizations, the Nicaraguan De-
velopment Council (NDC). Initially, IBC charged 
NDC $3,000 a month for public relations services, a 
fee that was later raised to $5,000 a month when IBC 
hired a full-time employee to do work for NDC. This 
relationship gave Miller and Gomez significant oppor-
tunities to work closely with Calero, Alfonso Robelo, 
and Arturo Cruz.24 
In the course of assisting the Contras with their 
public relations, Miller was introduced to North, ap-
parently by either Otto Reich or Jonathan Miller (no 
relation)?Director and Deputy Director of S/LPD?
who were IBC's principal contacts at the State De-
partment.25 In early 1985, Richard Miller became in-
volved with the NRF dinner, with which Channel! 
and Conrad were also engaged. This was the begin-
ning of their relationship, although the dinner de-
manded little of their respective energies and was 
organized and run principally by others. 
*In Audit Report No. 7PP-008, July 1987, the State Depart-
ment's Office of Inspector General filed its conclusions reached 
after a special inquiry into the awarding and supervision of these 
contracts with Gomez and IBC. That report concluded, in summa-
ry, that, while the original contract was justifiable, its utility 
became questionable during its later stages. The Inspector General 
also criticized the sole-source, noncompetitive process for awarding 
and administering the contracts, especially the classification of one 
version of the contracts as "SECRET," indicating that the classifi-
cation was unjustified and improper. Audit Report at 32-33.

Chapter 4 
The NRF Dinner 
According to Channell, the NRF dinner had to be 
postponed several times and was an organizational 
disaster. When it finally took place on April 15, 1985, 
President Reagan attended and delivered the keynote 
address. The NRF dinner proved to Channell that 
large and expensive functions were not an efficient 
method of raising money for the Contras, but the 
President's commitment to the Contra cause con-
vinced Channell that the Nicaraguan issue was fertile 
ground for fundraising and public education." 
Thereafter, Channell and Conrad, with the assist-
ance of Miller, concentrated on private meetings with 
potential large donors, who would be given an audi-
ence with North and, in some cases, a photo opportu-
nity with the President. 
The idea of focusing on potential big givers to the 
Contras was not new. Edie Fraser, one of the princi-
pal organizers of the NRF dinner, testified that at the 
suggestion of the State Department she met with 
North on December 11, 1984, to seek White House 
"participation" in the dinner. At that meeting, Fraser 
mentioned the Sultan of Brunei to North as a possible 
contributor to the NRF. Fraser explained that the 
Sultan had come to her attention because he had 
made a contribution to UNICEF in honor of Mrs. 
Reagan. On December 28, 1984, Fraser sent further 
biographical information on the Sultan to North, but 
does not know if North ever followed this lead." 
On March 4, 1985, Fraser sent additional informa-
tion to North on the planned dinner. At the bottom of 
the cover letter she added a handwritten note: "011ie, 
Very Imp., Two people want to give major contribs 
i.e. 300,000 and up if they might have one 'quiet' 
minute with the President." 28 
According to Fraser, she added this note to the 
letter because of her conversations with Channell and 
Conrad, who suggested that some of their contribu-
tors might make large donations to the NRF dinner if 
they could meet alone with President Reagan. As far 
as Fraser can recall, she added the number of donors 
("two") and the possible amount of money 
("300,000") to her note to give the offer some defini-
tion. She cannot be sure that either Channell or 
Conrad were that specific in their conversations with 
her." Neither Channell nor Conrad recall discussing 
such an offer with Fraser.3? 
Fraser received no response from North regarding 
the offer. In fact, Fraser says she never heard from or 
spoke to North again after their initial meeting on 
December 11, 1984. Her letters were not answered by 
North; someone else at the White House ultimately 
assumed responsibility for liaison with the group plan-
ning the dinner." 
NEPL and IBC Meet 
In late March 1985, prior to the NRF dinner, Chan-
nell called the office of Edward Rollins, then White 
88 
House Political Affairs Director, to ask how NEPL 
could help support "the President's agenda in Central 
America." Rollins's office referred the call to John 
Roberts, then a White House aide, who agreed to 
have lunch with Channell and Conrad." 
At that lunch, according to Channell, Roberts re-
sponded to their interest in the Nicaraguan issue by 
stating that they should talk to Miller and Gomez, the 
principals of IBC. Roberts told Channell and Conrad 
that IBC was "the White House outside the White 
House" on this issue. Shortly thereafter, Channell and 
Conrad set up a meeting with Miller.33* 
Roberts had called Miller prior to that meeting and 
alerted him to the referral, suggesting that Channell 
and Conrad wanted to "help the President" on Nica-
ragua. In particular, Roberts told Miller that Channel! 
and Conrad wanted to do a media campaign. Roberts 
did not mention any possibility of direct financial as-
sistance to the Contras.34 
Channell-Miller Network The 
Beginnings 
In late March or early April 1985, Channell, Conrad, 
Miller, and to a significantly lesser degree, Gomez, 
embarked on an effort to assist the cause of the Con-
tras. Their joint efforts would extend into the latter 
portion of 1986. According to Miller, Channell initial-
ly offered to IBC a retainer of $15,000 per month, 
which IBC accepted.35 
In exchange for this retainer, IBC was to handle 
media relations, political analysis, research, advertis-
ing copy, film production, and other public relations 
functions. There was never any written agreement, 
however, reflecting the arrangement between NEPL 
and IBC.36 
At first, IBC lent support to the American Con-
servative Trust and NEPL in their efforts to educate 
the public on the Nicaraguan issue. Very quickly, 
however, Channell expressed to Miller an interest in 
raising money for the Contras. Because of their prior 
contact with the Contras' organization and leaders, 
Miller and Gomez believed that they could be of 
assistance. One of Channell's first steps, with IBC 
help, was to secure a letter from Adolfo Calero au-
thorizing NEPL to solicit contributions on behalf of 
his organizations.37 This letter, dated April 10, 1985, 
opened "Dear Spitz," and read in part: 
Please help us to achieve our dream, a free and 
democratic Nicaragua, not tied to a hostile Soviet 
threat but to a peaceful democratic American 
tradition. 
*With respect to this conversation, Roberts told the Committees 
in an interview that he possibly described Miller as "fronting for 
the State Department" or as "in the family." Roberts Int., 7/17/87.

All resources you can raise will be appreciated. 
We can put all of them to good purposes. 
Richard Miller and Frank Gomez can keep you 
informed of our progress and serve as our con-
tact point in the United States.38 
The Initial Solicitations 
In early April 1985, Channell spoke with one of his 
prior contributors, John Ramsey of Wichita Falls, 
Texas, who Channell felt might be interested in con-
tributing to support the Contras. Ramsey seemed re-
ceptive to the idea, but wanted to meet Calero in 
person to ensure that any money he contributed 
would, in fact, be used to support the Contras." 
Channell scheduled a dinner for himself, Conrad, 
Miller, Gomez, Ramsey, and Calero in Washington, 
D.C., on April 10, 1985. At the last minute, however, 
Calero was unable to attend and the dinner went 
forward without him. Going into the dinner, Channell 
had told Miller and Gomez that Ramsey was a 
"tough cookie" who probably would be most interest-
ed in the Contras' need for arms and other lethal 
supplies.4? 
At the dinner, in a private room at the Hay-Adams 
Hotel, Miller and Gomez spoke at length about the 
Contras' need for supplies, both lethal and non-lethal. 
Gomez showed Ramsey a book of photographs taken 
during a recent trip Gomez had made to various 
Contra bases in Central America. This collection in-
cluded pictures of Contra fighters, mortars, and ma-
chine guns.4' 
Conrad openly tape-recorded the conversation 
during dinner, supposedly because he was learning 
new information about the Contras and wanted to 
preserve it.'" The transcript of the tape, as further 
interpreted by Channell, Conrad, and Miller during 
depositions, confirms that Channell, Miller, and 
Gomez discussed the Contras' military and non-mili-
tary needs at length, often in response to questions 
from Ramsey. At one point, Miller deflected a sugges-
tion by Ramsey that people be solicited to send used 
shotguns to the Contras: 
RAMSEY: "The best I can tell, a shotgun is the 
best thing to use in jungle warfare." 
GOMEZ(?): "Or a very rapid fire machine gun. 
That's why the AK-47s and the M 16s are the 
best weapons." 
MILLER: "The M16 fires a 22.5 caliber bullet." 
RAMSEY: "I bet I could get 10,000 people to 
give their old shotguns to this." 
MILLER: "Only one problem. You can't export 
guns without a license."43 
Shortly after this exchange, the subject turned to 
methods of counteracting Soviet-supplied HIND heli-
copters: 
GOMEZ or MILLER: "Calero has said publicly, 
so that the Sandinistas could hear on secret radio 
communications in the field saying we have red 
eyes [missiles]. It's a big lie." 
UNKNOWN: "They're playing a psychological 
war against the Sandinistas." 
MILLER(?): "The more sophisticated of the 
shoulder-held missiles, the red eyes. There's 2 
different kinds. One that's a little less expensive 
and there's one that's $8,000. It can take it 
out." 44 
Later, Channell itemized some of Calero's needs: 
CHANNELL: "Calero wants those red eye mis-
siles. He wants boots. He wants back packs. He 
wants AK-47 rounds which you can get on the 
international market. He wants communications 
equipment." 46 
Ramsey, however, returned again to his suggestion 
to provide the Contras with donated arms, which is 
not what Channell and Miller had in mind: 
RAMSEY: "We're going to call it the Shotgun 
Drive. And we're going to get Remington to put 
up the amo [sic]. Dupont owns Remington. 
"We're going to start on CBs. We're not even 
going to invoke the electronic media until we get 
support or we have about three semis going 
north on Tobacco Road out of North Carolina 
full. 
"And they keep calling on another semi. 
"We got an empty semi out there? Somebody got 
an 18-wheeler empty can come down and help 
liberate Central America?" 46 
Near the end of the transcript, the Channell-Miller 
group succeeded in turning the discussion back to 
missiles and money: 
UNKNOWN: "Between now and May 1 the red 
eye missiles could be the entire key. 
"Because if they succeed at this point in launch-
ing an offensive including tanks and MI24 heli-
copters into that region and go for the 
cans . . . . 
"There's two different kinds of red eye missiles. 
There's one that's very unsophisticated which is 
just a direct shot missile. And then there's one 
that's able to take on the Hind [sic] because the 
Hind has major decoy devices, has heavy arma-

ment, and it has these flares on the back of the 
exhaust from the jets?the expulsion from the 
engine?that mask the heat. 
"So you have to have the $8,000 red eye to make 
it work."4 7 
The transcript concludes with an observation, at-
tributed to Miller, summing up well the philosophy 
with which Channell, Conrad, and Miller approached 
their solicitations: 
MILLER: "If you provide money for ammuni-
tion, the money they've set aside for ammunition 
can go to boots. 
"On the other hand, if you provide money for 
boots, what they've set aside for boots can go to 
ammunition." 4 8 
The solicitation was a success. The next morning 
Ramsey had breakfast with Calero and, at that time or 
shortly thereafter, donated $20,000 directly to the 
Nicaraguan Development Council. As noted earlier, 
the NDC had previously retained IBC as a public 
relations consultant.* 
Later, in early June 1985, Miller received a tele-
phone call from North, who asked him to try to raise 
$30,000 for an undisclosed purpose related to the 
Contras. North also gave Miller the name and number 
of a Robelo-controlled account in the United States?
although Miller did not know that?into which any 
contribution could be deposited.49 
At Channell's suggestion, Miller contacted Ramsey, 
who sent $10,000 directly to the Robelo-controlled 
account.5? North later confirmed to Miller that the 
contribution had been received." 
Channell then asked Miller to have North send 
telegrams of appreciation to both Ramsey and Chan-
nell. Miller got North's approval for these telegrams 
and sent them over North's name.52 In those June 6, 
1985 telegrams, North thanked Ramsey and Channell 
for their support." 
The Ramsey solicitation was not, however, to 
become the model. It did not produce enough money 
for the effort and the donation was sent directly to 
Robelo so that the Channell-Miller group was not 
compensated. A new approach was undertaken. 
North's Maiden Presentation 
After the Ramsey solicitation, Channell drew on his 
experience with NCPAC briefings, and worked with

Miller to sponsor a White House "event" for prior 
and potential NEPL contributors. This event was in-
tended to educate contributors about the situation in 
Nicaragua and to solicit funds for the Contras. 
Through North, Miller and other IBC associates were 
successful in arranging a White House briefing for a 
group invited by NEPL.54 
The briefing was held on June 27, 1985, in the Old 
Executive Office Building next to the White How 
with North as the principal speaker. According to 
Channell, North delivered what became his standard 
speech about Nicaragua and the Contras. North 
showed slides during his presentation, some of which 
had been provided by IBC.55 
North's speech was an impassioned plea. He dis-
cussed the Communist threat posed to Nicaragua's 
neighbors by the Soviet and Libyan military buildup 
in Nicaragua, the political and religious repression in 
Nicaragua, the humanitarian and military needs of the 
Contras, and the importance of United States support 
for the Contras. North also emphasized that the 
United States would be flooded with millions of refu-
gees if Nicaragua continued under its existing regime 
and policies.* This briefing was the initial substantive 
encounter between Channell and North.** 56 
After the briefing, the potential donor group was 
taken across the street for a reception and dinner at 
the Hay-Adams Hotel. As was to become customary, 
NEPL arranged and paid for food and lodging at the 
Hay-Adams for persons attending this special White 
House briefing. At the dinner, Channell presented 
Calero with a check for $50,000, which represented 
all Contra-related contributions received to date by 
NEPL. At Miller's instruction, the check was made 
payable to a Calero account.57 
Channell testified that his understanding was that 
the contributed funds would be used for humanitarian 
supplies. This understanding was based on Calero's 
specific appeal that night for medicine and food.58

used a variety of pseudonyms, the most common of 
which was Ebrahim al-Masoudi?to Miller, who was 
engaged to market the Prince's oil. Miller and the 
Prince met several times over the course of the next 
several months. Miller's interest was twofold: he and 
North wanted to raise money for the Contras, and he 
was to receive $1 million of the profit that would be 
derived from the sale of the oil." 
Miller kept North fully apprised of his dealings 
with the Prince, which eventually also included a 
prospective gold transaction and assistance in freeing 
the hostages held in Lebanon.6? Indeed, Miller be-
lieved that he "was an agent working on [North's] 
behalf" in connection with these and other activities 
undertaken at North's request.6' * 
On April 26, 1985, Miller and Gomez incorporated 
a Cayman Islands corporation known as I.C., Inc.62 
This entity originally was intended to receive the 
profits from the transactions conducted with the 
Prince. Gomez was included because Miller needed a 
second corporate director under Cayman Islands law 
and Gomez was a close business associate on whom 
Miller could rely." 
The Cayman Islands were chosen by Miller on the 
recommendation of a "political friend." Miller wished 
to keep "offshore" any money that he derived from 
his transactions with the Prince, because: (1) he did 
not want to incur federal income tax on these pro-
ceeds; and (2) he and North "took precautions all the 
time . . . not to have organizations be readily available 
for public view." Miller was told that it was cheaper 
to maintain bank accounts in the Cayman Islands than 
in Switzerland. He also received advice from an attor-
ney that such an offshore "collection point" was a 
lawful arrangement. 6 4 
Although no proceeds were derived from the ven-
ture with the Prince,** I.C., Inc. became an integral 
part of the Channell-Miller fundraising network for 
the Contras. It served as a conduit, protected by 
Cayman Islands bank secrecy laws, through which 
the funds contributed to the tax-exempt NEPL could 
be transferred to the Contras or to the Enterprise. 
Miller advised North in late April or early May 
1985 of the actual formation of I.C., Inc." Indeed, 
North testified that he directed Miller to establish this 
Cayman Islands corporation to be used for Contra 
funding efforts.66 In May 1986, Miller changed the 
name of I.C., Inc. to "Intel Co-Operation, Inc.," and 
amended the corporate charter to specify that the 
company was engaged, among other things, in provid-

tion with operations and persons under investigation by the Com-
mittees, see Chapter 5. 
**According to Miller, he spent approximately $370,000 on ac-
tivities involving the Prince. North was aware of and approved 
these expenditures. Miller did not incur monetary loss, however, 
because North authorized Miller to reimburse himself for these 
expenditures from Contra assistance funds transferred to IBC from 
NEPL. R. Miller Dep., 8/21/87, at 404-07. 
ing grants to "political and benevolent" organiza-
tions.67 At that time, Miller told North about this 
name change and charter amendment, which Miller 
asserts was not aimed at providing increased cover 
for the operation.6 
The Creation of the Network 
Soon after the June 1985 briefing, Channell asked 
Miller to arrange a meeting with North. Certain con-
tributors to NEPL were concerned about press re-
ports suggesting that contributions for the Contras 
were being skimmed or spent on unnecessary or obso-
lete items." In addition, Channell wished to express 
his appreciation to North for the June 27 briefing.70 
Miller ultimately arranged a meeting on July 9 for 
himself, North, Channell, and Conrad at the Grill 
Room in the Hay-Adams Hotel. At the meeting, 
Channell asked North how best to ensure that funds 
contributed to NEPL for the benefit of the Contras 
actually were used for that purpose. North told Chan-
nell that henceforth "continued" contributions to 
NEPL for the Contras should be passed to IBC for 
proper dispersal. From shortly after this meeting 
through the fall of 1986, NEPL made all Contra as-
sistance payments to IBC or to I.C., 
North had shown a flow chart to his deputy, 
Robert Earl, and Miller sometime in 1985, which 
showed NEPL, IBC, and I.C., Inc. as vital parts of an 
elaborate Contra funding network. While this chart 
turned out not to be a fully accurate depiction of the 
actual workings of the network, North used it with 
Miller to explain "how a covert operation is set up." 
Miller recalls that the chart was similar to (although 
not as complete as) a chart found in North's safe and 
reproduced in the Tower Review Board Report at C-

White House Briefings and Hay-Adams 
Gatherings 
The North briefing in June 1985 served as the blue-
print for other similar briefings during the next year 
for NEPL contributors or potential contributors. 
These group briefings occurred on October 17, 1985, 
November 21, 1985, January 30, 1986, and March 27, 
1986. 
The White House briefings were meticulously 
planned by NEPL, IBC, North, and White House 
personnel. Internal White House memorandums ob-
tained by the Committees show that North was the 
switching point for arranging and coordinating the 
briefings with White House liaison, White House 
Counsel, and White House security.

NEPL prepared and sent invitations to persons se-
lected by Channel] and his associates. A typical invi-
tation to a briefing stated in pertinent part: 
You are one of a small group of dedicated Amer-
icans who has stood by President Reagan . . . in 
support of his agenda. . . . It will be a pleasure 
to meet you in Washington on [date] when you 
attend our special security briefing followed by a 
working dinner. . . . Please be reminded that 
your accommodations at the Hay-Adams Hotel 
are taken care of and there is no expense to 
you. 7 3 
For those who attended, NEPL met them at the 
airport with a limousine and escorted them to the 
Hay-Adams Hotel, where all expenses were paid by 
NEPL. 
The group typically was taken from the Hay-
Adams to a reception room in the Old Executive 
Office Building, where they were introduced to 
North and other White House personnel. Other than 
North, among those who participated in these brief-
ings were Patrick Buchanan, White House Communi-
cations Director; Mitch Daniels, Political Assistant to 
the President; Linas Kojelis, Special Assistant to the 
President for Public Liaison; Linda Chavez, Deputy 
Assistant to the President and Director of the Office 
of Public Liaison; and Elliott Abrams, Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Inter-American Affairs. For the 
January 30 briefing, David Fischer?a former Special 
Assistant to the President who became a highly paid 
consultant to NEPL and IBC?even arranged for a 
Presidential "drop-by." 
North always delivered the principal speech and 
slide presentation along the lines of the June 1985 
briefing. While he was an effective speaker, North 
generally was careful not to ask for money, often 
telling the audience that he could not solicit funds 
because he was a Federal employee. He did, however, 
suggest that persons interested in contributing funds 
for the Contras should speak with Channell. At least 
one attendee at these briefings recalled North's stating 
that there were certain matters he could not discuss 
with them "on this side of Pennsylvania Avenue" but 
that Channell would raise later "on the other side of 
the street," a reference to the Hay-Adams Hote1.74 
An account of North's presentation was provided at 
the public hearings by an eventual contributor in at-
tendance at the March 1986 briefing, William 
O'Boyle: 
[North] described the military and political situa-
tion in Nicaragua. He had photographs of an 
airport in Nicaragua that had been recently built; 
the purpose of the airport was ostensibly com-
mercial, but it was in fact a disguised military 
airport. One of the uses for which the airport was 
intended was to recover the Russian Backfire 
92 
bombers after they made a nuclear attack on the 
United States. 
Another possible use of this airport was to fly a 
certain kind of mission that was currently being 
flown out of Cuba, up and down the east coast of 
the United States. Apparently every day a Rus-
sian plane leaves Cuba, as I recall, and goes right 
up the 12-mile limit, has some kind of large 
device on the outside of the plane. . . . This 
Nicaraguan air base would allow the Russians to 
fly the same kind of mission up the west coast to 
the United States. . . . 
He described the refugee problem . . . and we 
could look forward in the next few years to mil-
lions of refugees flooding across our borders as 
this happened. . . . 
He showed photographs which indicated that the 
Nicaraguan government officials were indicated 
in smuggling dope. . . . He also told an anecdote 
about some Nicaraguan agents that were recently 
caught with dope and money and so forth and 
disguised as American agents.75 
O'Boyle indicated also that North furnished him with 
classified information designed to show that the Sovi-
ets were managing the diplomacy of the Nicaraguans 
before the United Nations.76 
After the briefings, Channell, Miller, and their asso-
ciates hosted a cocktail party and dinner at the Hay-
Adams, often attended by Contra leaders and some 
U.S. Government officials. During the reception and 
dinner, NEPL and IBC employees attempted to deter-
mine which attendees were the most likely contribu-
tors. The enticement of purchasing lethal supplies for 
the Contras was often used with potential contribu-
tors. Those persons who expressed a serious interest 
in contributing money for the Contras were offered 
the opportunity to meet one-on-one with North, and, 
if they gave enough, a meeting with the President.77 
Large contributors to NEPL uniformly received 
thank you letters from North (and often from the 
President) for their support of the President's policies 
in Central America, although without specific refer-
ence to any contribution.78 
North's Involvement in Solicitations 
Intended for the Purchase of Lethal 
Supplies 
In his public testimony, North testified that "I do 
not recall ever asking a single, solitary American citi-
zen for money."79 He readily admitted, however, that 
"I showed a lot of munitions lists" to Contra contrib-
utors or potential contributors "in response to ques-
tions about the cost of lethal items."" The Commit-
tees received evidence on North's activities that shed 
light on these statements.

Chapter 4 
1. "Big Ticket Items" and "011ie's New Purchase" 
Lists. In the late fall or early winter of 1985, Channell 
asked Miller to have North prepare and provide a list 
of "big ticket items" to be used in soliciting contribu-
tions for the Contras. At Miller's request, North recit-
ed a list that included heavy lifting of cargo by air-
craft (approximately $675,000 worth); training and 
outfitting of an "urban tactics unit"; the resupply of a 
Contra fighting unit known as the "Larry McDonald 
Brigade" (a Contra unit); and probably missiles of 
some kind.81 
Miller typed the list onto his computer, printed a 
single copy, gave that copy to Channell, and deleted 
the computer entry. Channell used this list, which 
totalled approximately $1.2 million, to solicit contribu-
tions." An apparently different "big ticket items" list 
was prepared by North and used by him and Channell 
in a solicitation of Nelson Bunker Hunt. Handwritten 
notes produced by Miller indicate other conversations 
with North about fundraising for lethal supplies. A 
note dated September 18, 1985, contains entries read-
ing "$415,000-Weapons, C4, M79" and "520,000 
MAUL."83 "C4" refers to an explosive, "M79" likely 
refers to a grenade launcher, and "$520,000 MAUL" 
refers to the cost of eight Maule airplanes. Miller 
testified that North provided this information to him 
with the understanding that it would be used for 
fundraising.84 
Another handwritten note of Miller's contains the 
entry "011ie's new purchase list." The note is dated 
February 5, 1986.85 Miller does not recall the deriva-
tion of this entry.86 
2. North's Special Appeals. As North testified public-
ly, he met with scores of potential contributors to 
convey the plight and needs of the Contras. Insofar as 
North's actual role, the more revealing of these meet-
ings are those that were conducted in private. As the 
descriptions below indicate, North prepared potential 
large contributors for what Conrad termed "the call 
to the altar." 87 
a. Nelson Bunker Hunt?In September 1985, Chan-
nell arranged a meeting in Dallas between North and 
Nelson Bunker Hunt, a wealthy Texas businessman 
who had contributed $10,000 to NEPL the previous 
July. Channell rented a private airplane for $8,000 to 
$9,000 to transport North to and from Dallas.88 * The 
trip was worth the cost. 
In Dallas, there was a private dinner at the Petrole-
um Club attended by Hunt, Conrad, Channell, and 
North. North gave his standard briefing, without 
slides, and showed Hunt a list of various Contra 
needs. The list was divided about evenly between 
lethal and non-lethal items, and included Maule air-
craft and a grenade launcher possibly described as an 
* This was the first time North used an airplane supplied by 
NEPL; on one other occasion, NEPL chartered a plane to fly 
North and his family for a weekend visit to Barbara Newington's 
house in Connecticut. Channell Dep., 9/1/87, at 148. 
"M-79." The total price was about $5 million. Ac-
cording to Channell, after discussing the items on the 
list and their prices, North "made the statement that 
he could not ask for funds himself, but contributions 
could be made to NEPL, or words . . . to that 
effect." North then left the room, a maneuver that 
had been "pre-arranged."89 
Channell explained that the list was his idea because 
he wanted a "fundraising objective" to take to Hunt. 
He therefore had asked North to prepare a list total-
ling about $5 million for use in the solicitation of 
Hunt.5? 
Despite this evidence, Hunt has told the Commit-
tees that Channell never spoke to him about the Con-
tras' need for weapons. According to Hunt, Channell 
told him that the Contras had "unpaid bills" for 
"[flood and shelter, medicine, [and] general 
expenses. . . ." 91 Hunt testified that he does not 
recall any conversation he had with North at the 
dinner.52 
Nonetheless, as a result of this dinner, Hunt made 
two payments to NEPL of $237,500 each." One of 
them was a contribution and one was a loan. The loan 
was evidenced by an unsigned promissory note be-
cause Channell would not agree to the loan (especial-
ly after he was unable to find a contributor to guaran-
tee the loan on NEPL's behalf). Nevertheless, he held 
the $237,500 principal for 4 months, repaying it to 
Hunt in January 1986 without interest." Hunt subse-
quently paid $237,000 to NEPL in March 1986 as a 
contribution, making his total contributions to NEPL 
$484,500.55 
In the case of Hunt's initial $10,000 contribution in 
1985, he sent NEPL a personal check drawn pursuant 
to a "check request" and marked "contribution." He 
also itemized the $10,000 contribution as a charitable 
deduction on his 1985 tax returns. By contrast, each 
step in the later transactions was conducted with 
Hunt's law firm?Shank, Irwin & Conant (SI&C) of 
Dallas, Texas?acting as an intermediary, and issuing 
its own checks, backed by Hunt's funds." 
Hunt testified that he handled these transactions in 
this manner in an effort to avoid publicity in the 
"liberal media" over the contributions. He acknowl-
edged that the NEPL gifts were the only ones he had 
ever made indirectly. Moreover, none of the check 
requests or check stubs for the three large checks has 
any entry in the section designated for "purpose." 
Documentation for other checks produced by Hunt 
consistently included this entry. Hunt indicated that 
he must have overlooked this omission on the three 
checks in question.57 
Finally, Hunt did not itemize the $237,500 contribu-
tion on his 1985 tax return or the $237,000 contribu-
tion on his 1986 return. He explained that, because of 
large losses each year, he did not need the deductions. 
Nonetheless, numerous other contributions apparently 
were itemized by Hunt on those tax returns."

Chapter 4 
In short, it seems that Hunt took great pains to 
keep his large contributions to NEPL "off the books." 
As indicated above, a note made by Miller 1 day after 
Hunt issued the checks for the contribution and loan 
to NEPL contains the entries "$415,000?Weapons 
C4, M79" and "$520,000 MAUL," referring to muni-
tions and airplanes." This same note refers expressly 
to Hunt in a different context.1?? 
b. Barbara Newington?Barbara Newington, a 
wealthy widow from Greenwich, Connecticut, had 
been a large contributor to Channell organizations 
(and at least one predecessor organization) for a few 
years. In 1985 and 1986, Newington contributed a 
total of $2,866,025 to NEPL. On June 25 or 26, 1985, 
she met privately with North because she was unable 
to attend the Channell group meeting arranged for 
the next day. She also met privately with President 
Reagan on two occasions.101 
In early November 1985, North, Miller, and Chan-
nell participated in a solicitation of significant contri-
butions from Newington. Miller's handwritten notes 
leading up to the meeting indicate that Channell pre-
pared a proposed "pitch" for "Green"?the code 
name for North used by NEPL and IBC?to use with 
Newington. This "pitch" included statements such as 
"[you are] the most secure person we know in the 
U.S." and "[w]e are asking you to take on a project 
that requires your kind of person.'9102 Although 
Miller does not specifically recall, he might have re-
layed a somewhat softened version of this solicitation 
to North.1?3 
In further preparation for the solicitation, Miller 
created a file folder that contained an unclassified 
photograph of a Soviet HIND helicopter on one side 
of the folder and a picture of a shoulder-held surface-
to-air missile on the other side. He also included an 
article from The New York Times on the capabilities 
of the HIND helicopter.'" 
The critical meeting took place in Newington's 
suite at the Hay-Adams Hotel where Channell, Miller, 
and Newington were joined by North. At the meet-
ing, North referred to the file folder prepared by 
Miller, placed The New York Times article in front 
of Newington, and described the capability of the 
pictured surface-to-air missile to counteract HIND 
helicopters. In response to a question from Newing-
ton, North indicated that he knew where to obtain 
such missiles, although Miller cannot recall whether 
North quoted any prices. North left the room shortly 
thereafter. According to Miller, North's absence was 
not specifically prearranged, "but it was his practice 
not to be in the presence of the donor when they 
were asked for money.',105 
Channel] then solicited Newington for a substantial 
amount of money. Over the course of the next 4 to 6 
weeks, Newington made stock contributions to NEPL 
worth approximately $1.1 million.106 Like Hunt, 
94 
Newington has denied that she ever made a contribu-
tion intended for the purchase of lethal supplies."7* 
At some point in the spring of 1986, Channell and 
Newington decided to invite North and his family to 
Newington's house for a weekend of recreation and 
relaxation. Miller, North, and North's family travelled 
to Connecticut in a private plane chartered by Chan-
nell. It is unclear whether there was any discussion of 
Contra assistance that weekend.'" 
c. William O'Boyle?William O'Boyle testified that 
he received several fundraising calls from NEPL in 
early 1986. O'Boyle, an independently wealthy busi-
nessman from New York City, had been referred to 
NEPL by a friend from Texas.'" 
In late March, he was invited by mailgram to a 
private White House briefing on Nicaragua. He flew 
to Washington on March 27, was met at the airport 
by a limousine arranged by NEPL, and was delivered 
to the Hay-Adams Hotel, where he met Channell, 
Miller, and others. Channell escorted the group to a 
meeting room in the Old Executive Office Building, 
where North presented the briefing described 
above." ? 
After the briefing, the participants returned to the 
Hay-Adams for a cocktail reception and dinner at-
tended by Channell, Miller, and other NEPL and IBC 
personnel. During the reception, O'Boyle indicated to 
a NEPL employee, either Cliff Smith or Krishna Litt-
ledale, that he was interested in making a contribution 
to purchase weapons for the Contras. He wanted to 
know what weapons were needed and how much 
they cost. The NEPL employee with whom O'Boyle 
spoke told him later that a Blowpipe antiaircraft mis-
sile could be purchased for $20,000.111 
After dinner, Channell told O'Boyle that there was 
a small, select group of persons in the United States 
who contributed money for lethal supplies to carry 
out the President's policy in support of the Contras. 
Channell asked O'Boyle if he would meet with North 
at breakfast the next morning. O'Boyle agreed."2 
Breakfast took place in the main dining room of the 
hotel. Before North arrived, the conversation between 
O'Boyle and Channell continued in the same vein as 
the evening before. Channell told O'Boyle that they 
had him "checked out" overnight to ensure that he 
(O'Boyle) was reputable enough to join the select 
group of Americans Channell had mentioned.113 
When North arrived, Channell told him that 
O'Boyle was willing to contribute funds for the pur-
chase of weapons. North immediately began to de-
scribe from a notebook the Contras' needs, including 
several million rounds of "NATO" ammunition, East-
ern bloc ammunition, Blowpipe and Stinger antiair-
*Miller later heard from Calero that no missiles had been re-
ceived by the Contras. North told Miller that the Newington 
money had been used to purchase "secure radios." R. Miller Dep.,

that Blowpipe missiles cost $20,000 each, but that 
they had to be purchased in packs of 10. He also 
mentioned that the cost of Maule airplanes was 
$65,000 each. According to O'Boyle, North stated 
that "he could not ask for money himself as a govern-
ment employee."114 
Either at this breakfast or the evening before, 
Channell informed O'Boyle that if he contributed 
$300,000 or more, a 15-minute "off-the-record" meet-
ing would be arranged between O'Boyle and Presi-
dent Reagan. Channell indicated that other people 
who had contributed that amount of money had met 
with the President. O'Boyle understood that these 
meetings with the President were "off-the-record" be-
cause the subject matter was so secret and sensi-
tive.115 
O'Boyle told Channell that he wanted time to con-
sider whether to make a contribution. After returning 
to his home in New York for a few days, O'Boyle 
decided to contribute $130,000 to NEPL for the pur-
chase of two Maule airplanes.* He flew to Washing-
ton to deliver his check to NEPL headquarters and 
was taken to the Hay-Adams Hotel by a NEPL em-
ployee. Channell met O'Boyle at the hotel. O'Boyle 
then gave his check to Channell, who telephoned 
North to join them at the hotel. '16 
When North arrived, Channell showed him 
O'Boyle's check, which North acknowledged. North 
spoke to O'Boyle again of the Contras' military needs 
and corresponding costs, but indicated that Blowpipe 
missiles no longer were available. In North's presence, 
Channell again told O'Boyle that a larger contribution 
would warrant a meeting with the President and 
asked for more money. 117 
Despite a visit in New York from Channell and 
Conrad and another meeting with North in Washing-
ton in which North disclosed a purported "secret" 
plan as to how the Contras would prevail in Nicara-
gua, O'Boyle informed Channell that he did not wish 
to make further contributions to NEPL.** In any 
event, in response to a subsequent mailing from 
NEPL, O'Boyle made one more contribution for 
$30,000.118 
d. Ellen Clayton Garwood?Ellen Garwood also tes-

been a NEPL contributor on several occasions. She is

*The Committees have concluded from Enterprise records that 
O'Boyle's contribution was used for general Contra support, not for 
the purchase of two Maule aircraft. 
**At the meeting in New York, O'Boyle expressed to Channell 
some concerns about the legality of using tax deductible contribu-
tions for weapons. According to O'Boyle, Channell told him that a 
lawyer had advised favorably on the question of legality, but that 
in any event the money could not be traced because contributions 
were being passed through a for-profit corporation and overseas.

1984 at a Council for National Policy meeting. She 
had been briefed privately by him on the Contras' 
needs at least a handful of times, including once at a 
small airport in Dallas when North flew there to 
solicit Hunt in September 1985."9 
Garwood travelled to Washington in April 1986 to 
attend meetings of NEPL contributors. Prior to the 
trip, Channell told Garwood that she would be pre-
sented with an appeal for much more money than had 
been requested of her before.'20 
During the last day of the NEPL meetings, Chan-
nell asked Garwood to meet with him and North that 
evening in the hotel lounge. At the evening meeting, 
North told Garwood that the situation of the Contras 
was desperate. With tears in his eyes, North explained 
to her that the Contras were hungry, poorly clothed, 
and in need of lethal supplies. He emphasized that the 
Contra forces might not exist by the time the Con-
gress renewed Contra aid.'21 
Either North or Channell then produced a small 
piece of paper with a handwritten list on it. They 
discussed the list in hushed tones outside of Gar-
wood's hearing. After North left the lounge, Channell 
showed the paper to Garwood. The paper contained 
a list of weapons and ammunition, with a price oppo-
site each category of items. She recalls that the list 
included hand grenades, antiaircraft missiles, bullets, 
cartridge belts, and other items.122 
Channell told Garwood that the items were what 
the Contras needed to sustain their efforts and re-
quested her to provide the amount necessary to pur-
chase the listed lethal supplies. Channell transcribed a 
copy of the list for Garwood to take with her.123 
To supply the items on the list, Garwood immedi-
ately contributed more than $1.6 million to NEPL; 
she wired $470,000 in cash and transferred stock 
valued at $1,163,506. For this same purpose, she con-
tributed an additional $350,000 the next month. All 
told, she contributed $2,518,135 in 1986. Garwood 
stated unequivocally that the principal purpose of 
these April and May 1986 contributions was to pur-
chase for the Contras the weapons and ammunition 
on the list provided by North and Channe11.124

These descriptions of the Hunt, Newington, 
O'Boyle, and Garwood solicitations are not exhaus-
tive. The Committees interviewed or deposed 13 of 
NEPL's significant contributors during the relevant 
time period, nearly all of whom reported personal 
contact with North. The Committees have received 
evidence that several of these contributors?including 
John Ramsey of Wichita Falls, Texas, and C. Thomas 
Claggett, Jr., of Washington, D.C.?made donations 
intended for the purchase of lethal supplies. Chan-
nell's records reveal that 12 contributors, including 
Newington and Garwood, accounted for slightly 
more than 90 percent of NEPL's contributions in 
1985 and 1986.

By giving to the tax-exempt NEPL, the contribu-
tors were able to claim tax deductions even though 
their contributions were intended for the purchase of 
lethal supplies. The Committees have received evi-
dence that several of these contributors claimed tax 
deductions for their NEPL contributions. For taxpay-
ers in the 50 percent tax bracket, this meant that the 
public in effect paid for half their gifts. 
The Role of the President 
In a May 19, 1986, PROF note to Poindexter, 
North wrote "the President obviously knows why he 
has been meeting with several select people to thank 
them for their 'support for Democracy' in Cent[ral] 
Am[erica]."123 In fact, what the President knew is a 
matter of some doubt. 
The President, in his March 19, 1987, press confer-
ence said that he believed that contributors he met 
had donated money for political advertising for the 
Contras.126 The minutes of the May 16, 1986, Nation-
al Security Planning Group (NSPG) meeting reveal 
the same understanding on the part of the President. 
He stated, "What about the private groups who pay 
for ads for the Contras? Have they been contacted? 
Could they do more than ads?" 127 Similarly, in prep-
aration for the January 30 briefing, Linda Chavez 
wrote a memorandum to the President, stating that 
"ACT and NEPL spent in excess of $3 million sup-
porting the President's programs through public 
awareness using television and newspaper mes-
sages." 128 In fact, much of the $3 million was direct-
ed toward Contra support activities, including arms. 
Poindexter, however, testified at his deposition that 
"Where wasn't any question in my mind" that the 
President was aware that the contributors he was 
thanking were giving to the Contras 123 He added 
that "in the White House during this period of time 
that we were encouraging private support, we really 
didn't distinguish between how the money was going 
to be spent." 1" North testified that in writing his 
May 19 PROF note, he assumed that the President 
was aware that the contributions were for munitions, 
as well as other things, although he denied ever dis-
cussing this with the President.131 
The President met with and thanked several large 
contributors for their support of his policies. David 
Fischer, former Special Assistant to the President, 
arranged Presidential photo opportunities or meetings 
with at least seven major Channell-Miller contributors 
in 1986. Fischer and Martin Artiano, a Washington 
lawyer, were paid steep fees by IBC (which charged 
these fees to NEPL) for arranging these meetings 
(among other services). Channell's statement to 
O'Boyle that these meetings carried a $300,000 price 
tag is substantiated by Edie Fraser's cryptic note to 
North (mentioned above); at least five of the six con-
tributors who donated more than $300,000 to NEPL 
were invited to meet with the President. 
96 
The Role of David Fischer and Martin 
Artiano 
In late November or early December 1985, Miller 
asked Martin Artiano, an acquaintance from the 1980 
Reagan Presidential campaign, to help him find some-
one "who had some Washington experience at a rela-
tively senior level" to provide "consulting" assistance 
to IBC on behalf of NEPL.132 When Artiano learned 
of IBC's needs, he contacted David Fischer, who had 
been a friend since they worked together as advance 
men in the 1976 Reagan campaign."3 
After the unsuccessful 1976 Reagan Presidential 
effort, Fischer worked as an employee of Deaver and 
Hannaford, a public relations firm that did extensive 
work for Mr. Reagan. Fischer was in charge of Mr. 
Reagan's advance operations and served on occasion 
as his personal aide during the years of preparation 
for another Presidential run in 1980.134 During the 
1980 campaign, Fischer became the full-time personal 
aide to Mr. Reagan, travelling on the campaign plane 
with the candidate. After the inauguration in January 
1981, Fischer was appointed Special Assistant to the 
President with an office adjacent to the Oval 
Office.135 For the next 4 years?until April 1985?
Fischer was in almost constant contact with the Presi-
dent. 
As President Reagan's second term began in early 
1985, Fischer and his wife decided for personal rea-
sons to move to Utah. By the fall of 1985, however, 
Fischer wanted to return to Washington and asked 
Artiano to let him know about employment or con-
sulting opportunities136 When contacted by Artiano 
about the IBC opportunity, Fischer authorized Ar-
tiano to pursue discussions with Miller on his 
behalf.137 
When Miller decided to retain Fischer and Artiano, 
he sought Channell's concurrence because NEPL ulti-
mately was to be the recipient of, and billed by IBC 
for, the "consulting" services performed by Fischer 
and Artiano. While all the participants recall that 
Fischer and Artiano agreed to act as subcontractors 
for IBC and provide services to Channell's organiza-
tions, there is sharp dispute over the terms of that 
agreement. This dispute is only sharpened by the ab-
sence of a written understanding. 
Channell and Conrad insist that they agreed to pay 
Fischer and Artiano $50,000 for each meeting Fischer 
scheduled with the President for a NEPL contributor. 
Conrad claims to recall a meeting in December 1985 
in Miller's office attended by Miller, Artiano, Fischer, 
Channell, and himself at which Artiano broached, and 
Channell accepted, this proposal.'" Channell recalls 
Fischer and Artiano making this proposal but claims 
that he rejected it as too expensive. Instead, according 
to Channell, he opted for a straight retainer of 
$20,000 per month.'" Gomez recalls that Fischer and 
Artiano were to be compensated at least in part based

Chapter 4 
on the number of Presidential meetings they could 
arrange for NEPL contributors.'" 
Fischer and Artiano vehemently deny that any such 
proposal was made or accepted. Artiano, who negoti-
ated with Miller on behalf of Fischer, testified that 
they initially agreed to a 2-year consulting contract 
for a monthly retainer of $20,000 a month. When he 
and Fischer realized the amount of work Channell 
demanded, however, Artiano testified that he request-
ed a $50,000 "acceleration" of their retainer. This 
payment was made to them on January 31, 1986, and 
was split evenly by Artiano and Fischer. Later, Fisch-
er demanded and received another $50,000 "accelera-
tion," which he did not split with Artiano. In July 
1986, Fischer and Artiano recast their arrangement 
with IBC entirely, replacing the 2-year consulting 
contract with a formal joint venture between "David 
C. Fischer & Associates" and IBC."' 
According to both Fischer and Artiano, they 
learned in early 1986 that Channell and Conrad were 
operating under the assumption that there was a 
straight fee-for-Presidential meeting arrangement. Ar-
tiano thereupon convened a meeting of all the princi-
pals and disabused Channell and Conrad of that 
notion.142 
Miller's recollection lends some credence to every-
one's account. He testified that the initial agreement, 
struck in December 1985, was a $20,000-a-month con-
sulting arrangement. He testified, however, that this 
initial agreement did not contemplate Fischer setting 
up meetings at the White House. Shortly after striking 
the original deal, according to Miller, Channell began 
to make increased demands upon Fischer, one aspect 
of which was setting up meetings between the Presi-
dent and major NEPL contributors. In exchange for 
servicing those increased demands, Fischer and Ar-
tiano demanded, through Miller, an acceleration of 
their retainer to $70,000 per month (that is, $50,000 
per month more than the monthly fee of the original 
arrangement). When Miller relayed this demand to 
Channell, Channell suggested that, for such a sum, 
NEPL should get at least one meeting with the Presi-
dent each month. According to Miller, Channell ulti-
mately did agree to this acceleration.'" 
All told, between December 1985 and February 
1987, IBC paid Fischer $397,400 and Artiano 
$265,000. Artiano transferred $60,000 of his payments 
to Fischer. All of the payments were reimbursed to 
IBC by NEPL. 
When asked about allegations that Fischer was paid 
$50,000 for each meeting arranged with the President, 
Donald Regan, the President's Chief of Staff, testified 
that he had no independent knowledge of such an 
arrangement, but, if true, the allegations would be a 
"real embarrassment." According to Regan, "we 
thought he was doing it out of his concerns for the 
contras and the goodness of his heart, a public pro 
bono type of thing." He continued: "To find out he 
was being paid for it was a real shock . . . . [A]nyone 
getting paid to get a group into the White House, we 
tried to block that." 144 
Fischer, however, contends that Regan knew by 
the first meeting between the President and Channell 
supporters?in January 1986?that Fischer was acting 
as a paid consultant to the Channell organization. 
When he raised the subject with Regan, according to 
Fischer, Regan responded, "I hope you're being com-
pensated for this."14 5 
North's Other Fundraising Efforts 
Separate from his Channell-related efforts, in the 
fall of 1985, North enlisted Roy Godson?a consult-
ant to the National Security Council?to assist in rais-
ing funds for a humanitarian organization involved 
with Nicaragua. Godson's efforts led to a deposit to 
the I.C., Inc. account through first the Heritage 
Foundation and then the Institute for North-South 
Issues (INSI), a non-profit organization controlled by 
Miller and Gomez. This deposit originally took the 
form of a $100,000 grant from the Heritage Founda-
tion to INSI. The Heritage Foundation received the 
money for the "grant" from a private contributor 
arranged by Godson and Clyde Slease, a Pittsburgh 
attorney and friend of Godson's. Godson had ar-
ranged for Slease to meet privately with North and 
McFarlane on the need to raise funds for the humani-
tarian organization.146 
The true objective of this "grant" was disguised in 
correspondence between Miller (as Treasurer of 
INSI) and Edwin J. Feulner (as President of the Her-
itage Foundation) with whom Godson had met pre-
viusly. Miller sent an INSI "grant proposal" to the 
Heritage Foundation in September 1985 proposing the 
preparation and dissemination of public information 
materials in Central America. This proposal requested 
$100,000. On October 15, the Heritage Foundation 
sent INSI a check for $100,000, with Feulner stating 
by letter that "[m]y colleagues and I have discussed 
your proposal in some detail, and are pleased to re-
spond in a positive way." 147 
INSI passed to I.C., Inc. only $80,000 of the 
$100,000 Heritage Foundation "grant," and retained 
the $20,000 balance as an administrative fee. The ulti-
mate distribution of the $80,000 forwarded to I.C., 
Inc. was made to an entity which, according to 
Miller, North represented was an account controlled 
by the humanitarian organization. INSI misrepresent-
ed on its 1985 IRS Form 990 the nature of the activi-
ties supported by this money.148 
Godson also arranged for John Hirtle, a stockbro-
ker in Philadelphia, to meet with North in Washing-
ton. Following this meeting, Hirtle and North met 
again in Philadelphia with two prospective contribu-
tors.'" One subsequently donated $60,000 by check 
dated December 13, 1985, directly to INSI. Shortly 
thereafter, this amount was then transferred by INSI 
directly to a Lake Resources account in Switzerland.

Chapter 4 
What Happened to the Money 
Just as only a small fraction of the Iranian arms 
profits was used for the Contras, so only a small part 
of the money Channell raised for the Contras reached 
them. Fischer and Artiano received more than 
$650,000 or more than five percent of the total money 
raised, and Miller, Gomez, and their companies re-
tained a large percentage of the $5 million that IBC 
received from NEPL. A total of $2,740,000 was trans-
ferred by IBC to I.C., Inc., and $430,000 directly to 
Lake Resources. After deducting the payments to 
Fischer and Artiano?which eventually were reim-
bursed by NEPL?the balance, approximately $1.2 
million, was retained by IBC for fees-for-services and 
expenses on NEPL's behalf.* This amount, however, 
is not all that Miller and Gomez received from the 
venture. Miller testified that North agreed in late 1985 
that he and Gomez could begin to collect a 10 per-
cent commission on the payments funnelled to the 
Contras through IBC and I.C., Inc. Miller stated that 
North said that the 10 percent was reasonable since 
"most of the other people in the business of providing 
assistance to the Contras were taking 20% to 
30%." 150 North, in his testimony, denied that he had 
agreed to any specific percentage, but rather stated 
that he had approved "fair, just, and reasonable" com-
pensation to Miller and Gomez.'51 Nonetheless, 
North's notebooks contain an entry for November 19, 
1985, which states "IBC - 10%." 
Miller and Gomez formed another Cayman Islands 
corporation in early May 1986, World Affairs Coun-
selors, Inc. (WACI) to receive the compensation ap-
proved by North. Miller instructed his Cayman Is-
lands agent to deduct automatically for WACI 10 
percent of all funds transferred to I.C., Inc."2 A 
total of $442,000 was taken by Miller and Gomez 
pursuant to this commission arrangement. Miller 
never told Channell that he and Gomez were receiv-
ing a 10 percent commission approved by North. 
Both Miller and Gomez believed that once the Contra 
assistance money left NEPL, it was subject to North's 
total discretion and control."3 
Including these commissions, IBC, Miller, and 
Gomez received more than $1.7 million from the 
money raised by NEPL for the Contras. Channell's 
take was also substantial, though apparently not of the 
magnitude of Miller's and Gomez's total compensa-
tion. He furnished his offices extravagantly and was 
lavish in his expenditures. He drew compensation for 
1985 and 1986 totalling $345,000, while Conrad and 
his organization received more than $270,000, extraor-
dinary earnings for nonprofit fundraisers. 
*During the relevant time periods IBC received $356,472 under 
its contract with the State Department, $39,000 from Calero for 
services, $180,000 from affiliated entities, and $407,304 from other 
individuals or organizations. In other words, the amount retained 
by IBC from NEPL accounted for nearly 60% of IBC's income in 
1985 and 1986. 
98 
Out of the money raised by NEPL, the Contras and 
their affiliated entities received only $2.7 million, with 
approximately $500,000 going to other persons and 
entities engaged in activities relating to the Contras. 
The money was routed through IBC and I.C., Inc. 
and disbursed at the direction of North to Lake Re-
sources, Calero, and the other persons and entities. In 
virtually every case, Miller would tell North when 
money was available and North would then instruct 
him on what to do with it. Figure 4-1 depicts the 
flow of money. In addition, as described in the next 
section, more than $1.2 million was spent on political 
advertising and lobbying for the Contras. 
Political Advertising for the Contras 
Apart from financial assistance to the Contras, the 
major project of the Channell and Miller organiza-
tions in 1985 and 1986 was a "public education" and 
lobbying program in support of U.S. Government aid 
for the Contras. 
The major vehicle in the "public education" cam-
paign was a series of television advertisements pre-
pared by the Robert Goodman Agency in Baltimore 
that cost NEPL $1 million. Adam Goodman of that 
agency, following the Senate's approval of the Contra 
funding bill in 1986, wrote a letter to Channell de-
scribing their achievement: 
By design, we launched the four-week national 
television ad campaign in Washington, DC, in 
late February. This reflected the economy of 
reaching all 435 Members of the House (and 100 
United States Senators) in one sitting. Beginning 
with Week 2, and running through the first deci-
sive House vote in late March, we also aired spot 
commercials in 23 additional television markets 
across the country. These targeted markets, cov-
ering the home Districts of nearly thirty Con-
gressmen experts considered to be at the core of 
the key 'swing vote' on Contra funding, added 
scope and credibility to the ad campaign. In fact, 
N.E.P.L.'s national television spot series was ulti-
mately seen by more than 33 million people, or 
one out of every seven Americans.' 5 4 
Supplementing the television programs were press 
conferences and speaking tours by persons supporting 
the Contras. These were arranged by IBC and an-
other public relations firm, Edelman, Inc., retained by 
Channell, which was paid $92,000 by NEPL. 
NEPL paid $115,000 for extensive polling by the 
Finkelstein Company as an aid to selecting areas 
where television advertisements and speaking tours 
would most likely have a favorable effect on a Con-
gressional vote. He also retained two companies, 
Miner & Fraser and the Lichtenstein Company, to 
generate letters to Congressmen supporting Contra 
aid, and he paid two lobbyists for their services in

support of this effort: Dan Kuykendall, who concen-
trated on undecided Republicans and conservative 
Democrats, and Bruce Cameron, who focused on lib-
eral Democrats. 
Another organization, Prodemca, which had con-
centrated on Central American issues, also received 
payments from Channell. Its representatives apparent-
ly participated in strategy sessions about enlisting 
Congressional support. 
Finally, it appears that Channell engaged in adver-
tising targeted to defeat Representative Michael 
Barnes's bid for a Senate seat in Maryland. Represent-
ative Barnes had been a vocal opponent of military 
assistance to the Contras. Channell's Anti-Terrorism 
American Committee ran a series of television adver-
tisements opposing Representative Barnes during the 
primary campaign. When Representative Barnes was 
defeated in the primary, Channell and his associates 
(Cliff Smith and Krishna Littledale) sent a telegram to 
North exulting in this result: 
We have the honor to inform you that Congress-
man Michael Barnes, foe of the freedom tighter 
movement, adversary of President Reagan's for-
eign policy goals and opponent of the President's 
vision for American security in the future has 
been soundly defeated in his bid to become the 
Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from 
Maryland. 
His defeat signals an end to much of the disinfor-
mation and unwise effort directed at crippling 
your foreign policy goals. 
We, at the Anti-Terrorism American Committee 
(ATAC), feel proud to have participated in a 
campaign to ensure Congressman Barnes' 
defeat.155 
Channell-Miller Network: The End 
The Beginning of the End 
On October 18, 1986, the President signed legisla-
tion appropriating $100 million for the Contras ($30 
million for humanitarian assistance and $70 million in 
unrestricted aid). The anticipation of this legislation 
led to a downturn in the activities of the Channell-
Miller fundraising and Contra assistance network (see 
Figure 4-1) after the summer of 1986. 
With the disclosure in early November of the sale 
of arms to Iran, however, persons involved in the 
network became concerned that the story of the net-
work would unravel and become public. This pre-
scient concern led to meetings between Miller and 
North on November 20 and 21. 
The initial meeting was requested by Miller. They 
met in the hallway outside of North's office in the 
Old Executive Office Building. Miller told North that 
he was worried about the possible legal ramifications 
and the costs associated with a legal defense. North 
told Miller that he should use the money left in the 
Intel Co-Operation (or I.C., Inc.) account (approxi-
mately $200,000) for any legal fees that might 
arise.156 
North called Miller the next day, November 21, to 
arrange a meeting later that afternoon. Miller met 
North in the Old Executive Office Building, and 
North asked him for a ride to Dupont Circle. Miller 
told North that money was needed from a foreign 
source to fund public relations and congressional ac-
tivities on behalf of the United Nicaraguan Opposition 
(UNO). Miller suggested contacting the Sultan of 
Brunei or an Arab country. North's response was "I 
gave one to Shultz already and he [screwed it up]." 
North also stated that "if Shultz knew that the Aya-
tollah was bankrolling this whole thing he'd have a 
heart attack." Miller did not understand either refer-
ence.157 
Either that day or the day before, North told Miller 
that the Attorney General had advised North to 
obtain legal counsel.* Miller dropped North at the 
office building at 1800 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., 
where Tom Green's law offices, among others, are 
located.158 
The Lowell Sun Allegations 
On December 14, 1986, the Lowell (Mass.) Sun ran 
a story under the headline "Money from Iranian 
Arms Sales Was Used to Back Conservatives During 
1986 Election." The story stated that "[a]bout $5 mil-
lion from the almost $30 million in excess raised from 
arms sales to Iran was filtered to conservative politi-
cal action groups" to "support candidates who backed 
President Reagan's pro-Contra and Star Wars poli-
cies." The only such group named in the article was 
NEPL. 
The Committees have uncovered no evidence to 
substantiate the allegation that NEPL or any other of 
Channell's political action groups received any pro-
ceeds derived from the sale of arms to Iran. In this 
regard, the Committees have accounted for virtually 
all of the funds received by Channell's organizations 
during the relevant period, none of which are trace-
able to the Iranian arms sales. Similarly, the Commit-
tees have accounted for virtually all expenditures 
from the Enterprise, and none of these were paid to 
Channell's organizations. 
NEPL Activities in December 1986 
In December 1986, NEPL's staff received an un-
usually lengthy holiday vacation from December 15 
to January 5, 1987. The reason given for this lengthy 
break was that the media were making it too difficult 
*The Attorney General denied that he offered such advice to 
North. Meese Dep., 7/8/87, at 103. See Chapter 20 for a more 
complete description of the events in November 1986.

for the organizations to conduct their work and that 
the most sensible response was to close operations for 
a couple of weeks.' 5 9 
Immediately prior to the extended holiday, two 
NEPL accounting employees were instructed by their 
supervisors to delete from the accounting records any 
and all references to the "Toys" project. As men-
tioned above, contributions intended for the purchase 
of lethal supplies generally were designated on 
NEPL's books for the "Toys" project. Alterations in 
the accounting records and related floppy discs were 
made to modify prior references to "Toys" to a neu-
tral project named "CAFP TV" (presumably Central 
American Freedom Project?Television Advertis-
ing).1 6 0 
In addition, NEPL's principal accountant took all 
NEPL accounting materials home with him during 
the vacation, including financial records, bank state-
ments, check books, deposit slips, and the like.161 
The evidence obtained by the Committees suggests 
that all such records were taken to perform year-end 
accounting tasks and were returned by the accountant 
without further alteration. 
February 1987 Report from IBC to NEPL 
On February 16, 1987, IBC issued a report to 
NEPL that reconstructed the disposition of the 
Contra assistance payments made by NEPL to IBC 
and I.C., Inc. during the period from July 1985 
through the end of 1986. The report contained sup-
porting documentation for many of the relevant 162trans-
actions. 
In a summary at the beginning of the report, IBC 
acknowledged that most of the disbursements of these 
100 
funds were made "at the request of Lt. Col. Oliver L. 
North." Moreover, the summary states that "we were 
assured by [North] at the time that the funds were to 
be applied solely for humanitarian assistance."163 
Miller has told the Committees that he would write 
these statements differently if he were writing them 
today.1 6 4* 
Guilty Pleas of Channel! and Miller 
On April 29, 1987, Channell pled guilty to a one-
count criminal information filed the same day by the 
Independet Counsel. As noted above, the information 
charged that Channell, Miller, "and others known and 
unknown to the Independent Counsel" conspired "to 
defraud the IRS and deprive the Treasury of the 
United States of revenue to which it was entitled by 
subverting and corrupting the lawful purposes . . . of 
NEPL by using NEPL . . . to solicit contributions to 
purchase military and other types of non-humanitarian 
aid for the Contras," in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 
371. The acts identified by the information as part of 
the conspiracy include the Ramsey, Hunt, Newington, 
O'Boyle, Garwood, and Claggett solicitations. At the 
hearing in which Channell's guilty plea was accepted 
by the Federal district court, Channell named Miller 
and North as his co-conspirators. 
Miller pled guilty to a substantively identical crimi-
nal information on May 6, 1987. Both Channell and 
Miller are awaiting sentencing. 
*According to Miller, he told North in late 1986 that he "hoped 
to hell the account had been used for humanitarian assistance." 
North responded "Oh hell, yes." R. Miller Dep., 8/21/87, at 331.

Chapter 5 
NSC Staff Involvement In Criminal 
Investigations And Prosecutions 
During the period covered by the Boland Amend-
ment, federal law enforcement agencies conducted in-
vestigations that touched upon various aspects of the 
secret Contra support operation. Concerned that these 
investigations, if pursued, would expose the NSC 
staff's covert operations, North and Poindexter react-
ed by contacting the agencies involved. They sought 
to monitor investigations and, in some cases, to delay 
or impede their progress by suggesting that national 
security was at stake. Confronted with such assertions 
from White House officials involved with the nation's 
security, law enforcement agencies understandably 
cooperated with the NSC staff by delaying some in-
vestigations, arranging to move a convicted former 
foreign official whom North was afraid would dis-
close facts about the Contras to a minimum security 
prison, and giving Poindexter and North information 
about other investigations. 
The Committees are aware of seven such episodes, 
three involving the United States Customs Service 
and four involving the Department of Justice. They 
represent an integral part of the NSC staff's efforts to 
keep its operations even from those with legitimate 
law enforcement interests. 
North and the Customs Service 
Maule Aircraft Corporation 
In the summer of 1986, the United States Customs 
Service, following up on a CBS news report, began 
an investigation into allegations that Maule Aircraft 
Corporation of Macon, Georgia, had shipped four 
aircraft into Central America to support the Contras 
in possible violation of U.S. export control laws.' 
In August 1986, the Commissioner of the U.S. Cus-
toms Service, William von Raab, was approached by 
North, who told him that Customs agents in Georgia 
were giving Maule Aircraft Corporation a hard time.2 
North said the Maule Corporation shipped aircraft 
such as "Piper Cubs" down south. North also said 
that Maule was "a close friend of the President." 
Commissioner von Raab told North he would look 
into the Customs Service investigation and assigned 
the matter to William Rosenblatt, Assistant Commis-
sioner for Enforcement.3 
Rosenblatt contacted North, who told Rosenblatt 
that the people involved in the sale and export of the 
four Maule aircraft were "good guys" and had done 
nothing illega1.4 North insisted that the aircraft were 
simply "super Piper Cubs" and were exported only to 
a Central American country, where they were used to 
supply the Contras with medical and humanitarian 
supplies.3 Rosenblatt explained that in order to verify 
the legality of the transactions, Customs needed cer-
tain documents and photographs of the aircraft, 
which North promised to produce. In exchange, Ro-
senblatt agreed to postpone issuance of subpoenas. 
Over the course of the next several weeks, Rosenb-
latt continued to contact North periodically to request 
the promised documentation,6 which North led him 
to believe would be forthcoming "momentarily." Be-
cause of North's promises, Rosenblatt told the agent 
in charge to suspend issuing a grand jury subpoena 
for Maule, although the agent asserted that the Maule 
officials were "stone-walling" him.7 In the interim, 
Rosenblatt found himself dealing with North on two 
other matters, one involving a Customs informant 
named Joseph Kelso and another involving Southern 
Air Transport's role in the Hasenfus aircraft, where 
North asked Customs to narrow a subpoena so as not 
to expose other sensitive operations (see Chapter 18). 
On November 10, Rosenblatt met with Commis-
sioner von Raab to discuss North's assertions that the 
Customs investigation could compromise national se-
curity, including an effort to obtain the release of the 
hostages.9 At that meeting, von Raab advised Ro-
senblatt to speak with Robert Kimmitt, General 
Counsel to the Treasury Department, about his inabil-
ity to obtain the Maule and SAT records. Rosenblatt 
scheduled that meeting for the afternoon of Novem-
ber 17.9 
On the morning of November 17, Rosenblatt called 
North to attempt again to get the promised docu-
ments on Maule Aircraft. To Rosenblatt's surprise, 
North indicated that he had the documents and would 
send them right over. When they arrived, however, 
Rosenblatt was quite disappointed. They did not in-
clude purchase orders, photographs, or other docu-
ments sufficient to dispose of the Customs inquiry. 
That afternoon, Rosenblatt met with Kimmitt and re-
lated the entire episode involving Maule and SAT.' ?

Chapter 5 
At that point, the investigation resumed, 6 weeks after 
it had been halted at North's request. 
While Rosenblatt testified he never mentioned the 
Kimmitt or von Raab meetings to North and he had 
no contact with North after November 17," North's 
notes suggest that Rosenblatt did brief him on these 
matters after November 17. A note dated "19 Nov. 
86" reads:

Kelso 
Another matter on which Customs had dealings 
with North involved Joseph Kelso. Kelso was on 
probation after a conviction for illegally exporting 
arms to Iraq. In 1986, he approached Customs under 
an alias and offered to work as an informant.' 3 
In the spring of 1986, Kelso, accompanied by a 
Customs informant, traveled to Costa Rica to gather 
information on an alleged counterfeiting and drug 
ring that supposedly included corrupt DEA agents." 
Kelso and the informant had not notified the U.S. 
Embassy or Costa Rican authorities of their investiga-
tion, and Kelso was detained and questioned by the 
Costa Rican authorities and DEA agents as to what 
he was doing in the country." Kelso was then taken 
to John Hull's farm." Hull reported the incident to 
North and Owen in a letter." At the same time, 
Tambs complained to Customs about their sending 
informants into Costa Rica without notifying the Em-
bassy. 
After returning to the United States, Kelso, who 
faced charges of violating his probation, turned over 
tape recordings of his activities to Customs, and 
claimed that, apart from his trip for Customs, he was 
working for the intelligence community." In or 
about September 1986, Rosenblatt called North to 
find out if Kelso was working for the intelligence 
community." North, who was already aware of 
Kelso's visit to Costa Rica, suggested that Rosenblatt 
allow Owen, whom Rosenblatt did not know, to 
listen to Kelso's tapes to verify his claims. Rosenblatt 
agreed on the assumption that Owen was part of the 
NSC staff, or otherwise assisting North.2? 
After receiving the Kelso tapes from Rosenblatt in 
October, Owen made two trips to Central America 
where he met with DEA agents. Although Owen was 
purporting to investigate Kelso's status, he never 
communicated further with Rosenblatt, and Rosenb-
106 
latt concluded from this silence that Kelso had not 
been working for the intelligence community." 
Miami Neutrality Investigation 
In connection with another investigation, this one 
conducted by the Office of the United States Attor-
ney for the Southern District of Florida, North and 
Poindexter were able to obtain information concern-
ing the vulnerability of the Enterprise. 
The Roots of the Investigation 
On July 21, 1985, the Miami Herald published an 
article by reporters Martha Honey and Tony Avir-
gan. In that article, a mercenary for Civilian Military 
Assistance (CMA) named Steven Carr, who was then 
imprisoned in Costa Rica, spoke of an arms shipment 
from Fort Lauderdale to a Central American location. 
The article caught the attention of the FBI in the 
Southern District of Florida, which opened an investi-
gation into Carr's allegations and alerted FBI head-
quarters in Washington, D.C., as required in any 
matter involving the Neutrality Act.22 
Garcia Allegations 
In December 1985, an individual named Jesus 
Garcia was convicted in the Southern District of 
Florida on charges of possessing an unlicensed ma-
chine gun. 2 3 
While Garcia was awaiting sentence, he offered 
through his attorney to provide federal authorities 
with information relating to paramilitary plots in Cen-
tral America. As a result of that offer, he was inter-
viewed on January 7, 1986 by two FBI agents. He 
claimed that he had been set up on the machine gun 
charge by a person who supposedly worked for Tom 
Posey and the CMA, a pro-Contra paramilitary 
group. According to Garcia, Posey was attempting to 
neutralize him because of his knowledge of a CMA 
plot to assassinate Ambassador Lewis Tambs to col-
lect a reward offered by a notorious drug kingpin in 
Central America. The assassination, Garcia told the 
FBI, would, as an added benefit, be blamed on the 
Sandinistas, thereby assisting the Contras' cause. 
Garcia also gave the FBI further details on the gun 
shipment reported earlier in the Miami Herald.24 
The FBI agents and Jeffrey Feldman, the Assistant 
United States Attorney conducting the investigation, 
were all skeptical.25 Nevertheless, given the gravity 
of Garcia's allegations, the investigation continued. At 
the request of the FBI, embassy officials in Costa 
Rica interviewed Carr and other American mercenar-
ies imprisoned in that country. Hotel records at the 
alleged site of a critical meeting seemed to confirm its 
occurrence. Flight plans and records suggested that 
the alleged arms shipment also could have oc-
curred. 2 6

Chapter 5 
During this phase of the investigation, the FBI re-
ceived allegations that North, Owen, and John Hull 
were involved in, or at least aware of, the gun run-
ning plots.27 This information was not supplied by 
Garcia, but came through other sources." 
On March 14, 1986, an FBI agent and Feldman met 
with Anna Barnett, the Executive Assistant United 
States Attorney. While the FBI agent and Feldman 
were in Barnett's office discussing the investigation, 
United States Attorney Leon Kellner came in to in-
quire whether anyone was aware of an alleged plot to 
assassinate Ambassador Tambs. According to Kellner, 
he had just received a call from someone at the De-
partment of Justice in Washington who wanted infor-
mation about the investigation." At or shortly after 
that meeting, it was decided that the FBI agents and 
Feldman would travel to New Orleans to interview 
Jack Terrell, a/k/a "Colonel Flaco," a former CMA 
mercenary who, they had been told, knew more de-
tails of the conspiracy.3? 
Activity in Washington 
The FBI agents had been advising headquarters by 
telex throughout the early stages of the investigation 
and in early March had received a request from 
Oliver Revell, Executive Assistant Director of the 
FBI, for a detailed summary of their findings. Their 
report was forwarded to headquarters on March 20, 
1986.3' 
Revell's inquiry was itself sparked by a request 
from Deputy Attorney General D. Lowell Jensen for 
an update on the investigation." Revell sent a sum-
mary of the agents' report five pages in length, to 
Jensen. 3 3 
Upon receiving the memorandum, Jensen met with 
Attorney General Meese to discuss the case. Jensen 
recalls that he and Meese decided that Admiral Poin-
dexter, the National Security Adviser, should be 
briefed on the matter because of its international im-
plications and the possibility of danger to an Ameri-
can diplomat. Jensen was uncertain, however, wheth-
er he or Meese initiated the proposal to brief Poin-
dexter.34 Meese testified at his deposition that he did 
not recall discussing this matter with Jensen.35 
Jensen also forwarded a copy of Revell's memoran-
dum to Associate Attorney General Steven Trott, 
who forwarded it in turn to Deputy Assistant Attor-
ney General Mark Richard. On the "buck slip" ac-
companying the memorandum, Trott wrote: 
Please get on top of this. [Jensen] is giving a 
heads up to the N.S.C. He would like us to 
watch over it. 
Call Kellner, find out what is up, and advise him 
that decisions should be run by you." 
On another buck slip attached to the memorandum 
for his own record, Richard wrote, "3/26/86, spoke 
to Kellner?AUSA not back yet from [New Orle-
ans]."37 
Richard recalls speaking with Kellner about the 
case on several occasions over the next several 
months. Trott and Jensen also believe they spoke to 
Kellner about the case on a few occasions. Each of 
them specifies that he never attempted to impede or 
otherwise interfere in the investigation itself, and the 
Committees have no Lvidence that contradicts this." 
On March 26, 1986, Jensen went to the NSC and 
showed Poindexter a copy of Revell's memorandum. 
Jensen does not recall any discussion that may have 
taken place. Poindexter testified that he does not 
recall the briefing at all." 
Terrell and Costa Rica 
In New Orleans, Terrell provided the FBI agents 
and Feldman with additional information on the al-
leged assassination plot and arms shipment. When 
pressed, however, Terrell admitted that most, and 
perhaps all, of his information was based on hearsay 
rather than on his direct participation or observa-
tion.40 
Feldman and the FBI agents traveled to Costa Rica 
on March 31, 1986, and reported to the U.S. Embas-
sy. There they met with Tambs, who wanted to know 
the purpose of their visit. Feldman briefed Tambs 
thoroughly on their investigation and intentions. 
During that briefing, Feldman showed Tambs a chart 
he had drawn to illustrate the supposed conspiracy 
that had been described to him. The chart showed a 
pyramid of participants, with lines of involvement 
running up through John Hull and Robert Owen to 
Oliver North at the top.4' 
When he saw the chart, Tambs summoned 
"Thomas Castillo," who introduced himself to the 
investigators as a CIA station chief. Castillo provided 
them background information on Hull. According to 
Feldman, Castillo also spoke of North warmly as "the 
person who introduced me to the President of the 
United States last week."42 
Over the course of the next two days, Feldman, the 
FBI agents, and various embassy personnel inter-
viewed Steven Carr and several other imprisoned 
mercenaries. They attempted to set up an interview 
with Hull, who initially agreed and then declined to 
speak to them.43 Feldman was also told by an em-
ployee at the U.S. Embassy that Hull had been con-
tacted by the NSC about the investigation.44 
North received a briefing from Owen on Feldman's 
visit. In a letter dated April 7, 1986, Owen identified 
each of the investigators who had appeared in Costa 
Rica, then wrote: 
According to [Castillo], Feldman looks to be 
wanting to build a career on this case. He even 
showed [Castillo] and the Ambassador a diagram 
with your name at the top, mine underneath, and

Chapter 5 
John's underneath mine, then a line connecting 
the various resistance groups in [a Central Ameri-
can country.] 
Feldman stated they were looking at the "big 
picture" and not only looking at a possible viola-
tion of the neutrality act, but at possible unau-
thorized use of government funds. They went 
several times to the prison to question the five in 
jail. They tried to talk with John, but he was 
advised not to talk with them unless he had a 
lawyer present.4 5 
April 4 Meeting 
Feldman met late on the afternoon of April 4, 1986, 
with Kellner and Barnett to discuss the results of his 
trip to Costa Rica. Also present were Larry Scharf 
(Special Counsel to the United States Attorney) and 
Richard Gregorie (Chief Assistant United States At-
torney). 
Feldman explained to them that, while the assassi-
nation plot seemed to be fading as a cause for concern 
or a vehicle for prosecution, the gun-running charges 
seemed to have some basis in fact. Others at the 
meeting believed, however, that Feldman was having 
a difficult time fitting a complex combination of facts, 
witnesses, and actors into a coherent theory of pros-
ecution.46 
At one point, the topic of the Boland Amendment 
was raised. Because no one in the room was familiar 
with the details of that legislation Barnett asked As-
sistant United States Attorney David Liewant to 
locate it with the research computer.47 
According to Liewant, when he arrived at 
Kellner's office with the printout, only Kellner, Bar-
nett, and Feldman were present and Kellner was on 
the telephone talking to someone at the Department 
of Justice.48 According to Liewant, when Kellner 
hung up, he turned to Barnett, Feldman, and Liewant 
and said that the Department wanted them to "go 
slow" on the investigation. Liewant could tell from 
Kellner's expression and tone of voice that Kellner 
was disdainful of that suggestion and had no intention 
of actually slowing the investigation." 
If Liewant's account of this meeting is correct, the 
Department of Justice would appear to have been 
exerting improper influence to delay an investigation, 
albeit influence brushed aside by Kellner. But each of 
the other participants in the April 4 meeting deny that 
any such telephone conversation took place." Rich-
ard, Trott, Jensen, and Meese also deny that any 
telephone call like that described by Liewant oc-
curred or that anyone, to their knowledge, attempted 
to slow the investigation at any time.51 
At the end of the meeting on April 4, Kellner asked 
Feldman to draft a memorandum pulling together the 
results of the investigation to date as well as Feld-
man's approach to any possible prosecution." 
108 
The Meese Aside 
On April 12, Meese, along with Jensen and Revell, 
arrived in Miami to visit a number of FBI agents 
wounded in a shoot-out the day before. Kellner ac-
companied Meese on his visits." 
During the day, Meese pulled him aside and asked 
him about the Garcia investigation. Kellner believes 
that he told Meese that there did not appear to be 
much substance to the assassination allegations, but 
that the gun-running investigation was continuing. 
Kellner testified that Meese neither stated nor implied 
that the investigation should be slowed or conducted 
in any other particular manner." 
Meese recalls asking Kellner about the matter, al-
though he does not recall pulling Kellner aside to do 
so. Meese testified that he mentioned that case in 
particular because it had received attention by the 
press.55 Meese also denies that he attempted to affect 
the course of the investigation." 
The Feldman Memoranda 
On April 28, Feldman provided the first in what 
was to become a series of memorandums to Kellner. 
Both Feldman and Kellner felt that it was unsatisfac-
tory.57 On May 14, Feldman therefore produced a 
more detailed memorandum, 20 pages in length. It 
reviewed the facts gathered to that time and conclud-
ed that it was appropriate to issue grand jury subpoe-
nas for various documents and witnesses. Feldman 
wrote: 
The Bureau believes that a grand jury is neces-
sary for several reasons. First, it would dispel 
claims that the Department of Justice has not ag-
gressively pursued this matter. Second, a grand 
jury would eliminate some of the deception they 
believe they have encountered during their inter-
views with Jesus Garcia, Daniel Vasquez Sr., 
Ronald Boy, and Max Vargas. Finally, the grand 
jury would give the Department of Justice access 
to Costa Gun Shop's business records and 
CANAC's bank records. 
Within a few days, Kellner returned the memoran-
dum to Feldman with the notation "I concur, we 
have sufficient evidence to institute a grand jury in-
vestigation into the activities described herein."58 
Kellner then convened a meeting in his office on 
May 20 to discuss the case. Present, once again, were 
Kellner, Barnett, Scharf, Gregorie, and Feldman. As 
the discussion progressed, Scharf and Gregorie set 
forth a number of reasons why they believed it pre-
mature to issue grand jury subpoenas. Gregorie, at his 
deposition, summarized those reasons: 
Before you go into the grand jury, as I told Jeff, 
you have to have some idea where you're going 
and what you're looking for.

Chapter 5 
Up until that time, he had some wild stories that 
were concocted by freelance newspaper reporters 
about mercenaries who were unreliable, individ-
uals who had failed a polygraph, people who 
were unreliable, and we did not have a stage set 
of facts [sic], and I did not think it was appropri-
ate to go into the grand jury with a bunch of 
people who we were later going to find out were 
totally lying and totally misled in a grand jury, 
going to confuse them. 
What I saw was a confused mess of facts that 
were leading in no particular direction, and had 
no form or substance to them." 
By the end of the meeting, a consensus developed 
that further interviews should be conducted before 
resorting to the grand jury. Feldman, who had re-
quested authorization to go to the grand jury initially, 
acquiesced in the decision and agreed to have the FBI 
conduct the additional interviews.60 
After Kellner changed his mind and concluded that 
grand jury subpoenas would be premature, he asked 
Feldman to redraft the May 14 memorandum to re-
flect that conclusion. Feldman did so, and submitted a 
revised version to Kellner on May 22. Feldman did 
not change the original date on the revised memoran-
dum.6' 
Kellner asked Scharf to review this new version, 
and Scharf made a number of changes. Most impor-
tant, he included a reference to the Christic Institute 
litigation filed in the Southern District of Florida on 
May 30 and added to the conclusion a number of 
reasons why resort to a grand jury would be prema-
ture. Scharf had these changes made on a word proc-
essor, but did not change the original date or author. 
As a result, when Kellner submitted the memorandum 
to the Department on June 3, it still bore the date of 
May 14 even though it referred to an event that 
occurred on May 30. Feldman did not see this final 
version of his memorandum before Kellner sent it on 
to Washington.6 2 
Further Investigation 
The FBI agents undertook the additional investiga-
tion requested by Feldman. On July 31, 1986, they 
presented Feldman with a lengthy "prosecution 
memorandum" that included their most recent find-
ings. Feldman, in turn, forwarded that report to 
Kellner on or about August 14.63 
On August 29, 1986, Kellner told Feldman to sus-
pend any further investigation on the matter until he 
(Kellner) returned from an impending trip to Wash-
ington. According to Feldman, Kellner told him that 
"politics" were involved. Feldman found this state-
ment surprising and disturbing, because it was the 
first, and only, time Kellner had indicated to him that 
such considerations were relevant. When Kellner re-
turned from Washington shortly thereafter, he told 
Feldman to proceed." 
Kellner confirmed Feldman's version of this inci-
dent. According to Kellner, shortly before he was to 
leave for Washington he received a letter from John 
Hull making serious allegations of impropriety by 
members of Senator Kerry's staff, who were also in-
vestigating Garcia's allegations. Hull also had includ-
ed affidavits from some of the imprisoned mercenaries 
retracting some of their prior statements regarding 
gun-running and Contra support. Kellner stated that 
he feared that he was being put into the middle of a 
political dispute, and wanted to talk to Mark Richard 
about the allegations before proceeding further. After 
that discussion, Kellner immediately authorized Feld-
man to proceed. Both Feldman and Richard con-
firmed this explanation.6 5 
Meanwhile, Kellner had reviewed the prosecution 
report cursorily and forwarded it, in mid-August, to 
Richard Gregorie for his input. On October 6, the 
day after the Hasenfus crash, Gregorie responded to 
Kellner that he felt the case was ready to go to the 
grand jury.66 The prosecution memorandum then 
rested again with Kellner, who forwarded his own 
approval to Feldman in the first week in November?
six months after Feldman had first suggested the need 
for a grand jury. The relative inactivity from mid-
August to the first week in November was again 
frustrating to Feldman and the FBI agents, and was 
explained by Gregorie and Kellner as due to the gen-
eral press of other matters.6 7 
Upon receiving approval from Kellner, Feldman 
proceeded with the investigation. The Independent 
Counsel subsequently declined to take over the case 
and Feldman was continuing to investigate the matter 
at the time he was deposed by the Committees." 
Reward for a Friend 
In one episode, the NSC staff undertook to persuade 
the Department of Justice to "reward" someone char-
acterized by North as a "friend" who had been con-
victed of plotting to assassinate a Central American 
leader. In that episode, the NSC staffs motive appears 
to have been a desire to prevent disclosure of certain 
questionable activities. 
According to a North PROF to Poindexter, the 
"friend" was an official in a Central American coun-
try with whom North, the U.S. Ambassador, General 
Gorman, and Dewey Clarridge arranged for bases for 
the Contras as well as overall logistics, training and 
support. 69 
This official and other plotters were indicted prior 
to 1986 for conspiracy to assassinate a Central Ameri-
can leader.7? Pursuant to a plea agreement, the offi-
cial pleaded guilty to two felony counts which car-
ried a significant maximum sentence; and he was later

Chapter 5 
sentenced to two shorter, though still significant, 
prison terms to run concurrently." 
At the sentencing hearing, U.S. military officials 
assigned to the State Department testified on behalf of 
the official. The court provided that the official could 
be immediately eligible for parole if so determined by 
the Parole Commission and recommended he serve 
his sentence at a minimum security institution. Mean-
while, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams 
promised the official's government that he would look 
into the case.72 
In a September 17, 1986 PROF message to Poin-
dexter, North noted that the official was under the 
impression he would serve only a matter of days or 
weeks at the minimum security institution and then be 
released.73 North was concerned that once the offi-
cial realized he was really going to serve a long 
sentence, "he will break his longstanding silence 
about the Nic[araguan] Resistance and other sensitive 
operations."74 North noted the next morning he 
would meet with Oliver Revell, Steven Trott, and 
Elliott Abrams to explore the possibility of a pardon, 
clemency, deportation, or sentence reduction. The ob-
jective of this exercise, as North put it, was "to keep 
[the official] from feeling like he was lied to in legal 
process and start spilling the beans."75 Admiral Poin-
dexter responded: "You may advise all concerned that 
the President will want to be as helpful as possible to 
settle this matter." 7 6 
Representatives of different agencies of the Admin-
istration met to discuss the request for leniency. 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mark Richard at-
tended a meeting where Defense Department repre-
sentatives argued on the official's behalf. Richard con-
cluded their reasons were not sufficiently specific.77 
No one ever gave a detailed account of what the 
official had actually done for the United States to 
deserve leniency. He was always simply described as 
a "friend of the United States."78 The State Depart-
ment agreed with the Department of Justice that the 
official was a terrorist and should be punished. The 
CIA did not express an opinion.79 
At a subsequent meeting in North's office on Sep-
tember 24, 1986, North tried to convince Trott, 
Revell, C/CATF (CIA) and James Michel, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State, that the official was only 
tangentially involved in the assassination plot and de-
served leniency.8? Revell disagreed. North asked 
them to consider recommending a minimum security 
correctional institution rather than the federal prison 
to which the official had been assigned, despite the 
court's recommendation, by the Bureau of Prisons.8' 
In early October, North tried again with the De-
partment of Justice, this time with help from General 
Gorman and Dewey Clarridge. Also at this meeting 
were Mark Richard (filling in for Trott), Revell, and 
Elliott Abrams.82 North, Gorman and Clarridge all 
argued for leniency for the official, explaining only 
that the official was a "friend of the government" 
110 
who was "always ready to assist us" and "was helpful 
in accommodating our military."'" Abrams agreed 
that the U.S. should do what it could for the official, 
thereby reversing the State Department's earlier posi-
tion.84 According to Richard, he offered to meet 
with others in the Department and determine whether 
the Department would oppose the transfer of the offi-
cial to the minimum security institution. 
North's contemporaneous account of that meeting 
portrayed the Justice Department as more committed 
to assisting the official. In a PROF note to Poin-
dexter, North indicated that, after the last co-con-
spirator was convicted and sentenced, the Department 
of Justice would have the defense attorney file a 
motion to reduce the sentence to time served and 
arrange to have General Gorman brief the court in 
camera on the equities. North said Trott and Revell 
believed this should result in the release and deporta-
tion of the official. North suggested that the official's 
attorney should be discreetly briefed to mollify the 
concerns of those involved that the official "will start 
singing songs nobody wants to hear."85 
Richard soon determined that neither Trott nor 
Kellner had any objection to redesignating the official 
to the minimum security institution, as contemplated 
in the original court's recommendation and made the 
appropriate arrangements with the Bureau of Pris-
ons.8 6 
The Fake Prince 
As explained briefly in Chapter 4, an individual 
named Kevin Kattke contacted North in March or 
April 1985 about a Saudi "prince" who proposed do-
nating to the Contras approximately $14 million in 
proceeds derived from the sale of the "prince's" oil. 
North referred the "prince" to Richard Miller. Miller 
and the "prince" met regularly over the course of the 
next several months. The "prince" sought Miller's 
help in marketing the oil, agreeing to pay Miller $1 
million of the profits earned. Miller kept North regu-
larly apprised of his dealings with the "prince", which 
eventually also included both a proposed gold trans-
action and assistance in freeing the hostages held in 
Lebanon.87 Indeed, Miller saw himself as "an agent 
working on [North's] behalf" in connection with 
these activities.88 Yet while North was attempting to 
develop the "prince" as an asset in both his Iran and 
Contra initiatives, the FBI was investigating the 
"prince" for bank fraud. 
From the start, Miller had misgivings about the 
bona fides of the "prince." He did library research 
without much success in an effort to establish the 
"prince's" authenticity. According to Miller, North 
told him that the CIA had confirmed both the 
"prince's" identity and the veracity of the "prince's" 
information about the hostages."

Chapter 5 
Early in their relationship, the "prince" told Miller 
that he had information about the hostages in Leba-
non that would be useful to U.S. efforts to locate and 
extricate the hostages. At North's suggestion, Miller 
related this information to the Hostage Location Task 
Force, representatives of which met with and inter-
viewed the "prince" in Houston. Miller continued to 
inform North of the hostage-related information con-
veyed by the "prince."" 
In July 1985, North asked a DEA agent (Agent 
1)?who was detailed to North in connection with 
hostage release efforts?to accompany Miller and the 
"prince" to England to assist the "prince's" entry into 
the country, if necessary. Agent 1 agreed, and North 
arranged for payment of his travel expenses." 
The three men stayed in London for five or six 
days. Based on discussions with the "prince" about 
the situation in the Middle East, Agent 1 concluded 
that it would be worthwhile to develop the "prince" 
as a source in the hostage location effort." 
In August 1985, the DEA agents embarked on fur-
ther activities with the "prince." At North's request, 
they traveled to Geneva from Cyprus to help the 
"prince" obtain travel papers after his passport had 
allegedly been stolen. Even with the cooperation of 
Ambassador Faith Whittlesey, Agent 1 was unsuc-
cessful in obtaining a U.S. passport for the "prince." 
A week later, however, Agent 1 obtained travel 
papers for the "prince" issued by another country. 
Agent 1 remained with the "prince" in Europe for 
some time thereafter, and paid the "prince's" ex-
penses.? 3 
At North's request, Secord met Agent 1 and the 
"prince" in Geneva in September 1985. After meeting 
the "prince," Secord expressed to Agent 1 concerns 
about the "prince's" bona fides." 
Meanwhile, during the spring and summer of 1985, 
the "prince" developed legal problems in the United 
States. In late spring, the "prince" cashed a $250,000 
check at William Penn Bank in Philadelphia, which 
was returned for insufficient funds. This event result-
ed in a referral to the FBI's Philadelphia field office 
for bank fraud charges against the "prince." In con-
nection with the fraud investigation, the FBI's Wash-
ington field office was asked to interview both North 
and Miller.? 5 
An FBI agent interviewed North on July 18, 1985. 
According to the agent, North said that he had re-
ferred the "prince" to Miller because it was inadvis-
able (and potentially unlawful) for an NSC staff 
person to meet with an individual who planned to 
contribute funds to the Contras. North further in-
formed the agent that the "prince's" interest in donat-
ing to the Contras was discussed by North personally 
with the President and with Robert McFarlane." 
North "confidentially" advised the agent that the 
NSC staff had maintained indirect contact with the 
"prince" because of the Contras' desperate need for 
funds.? 7 
North specifically requested that attempts by the 
FBI to interview the "prince" be held in abeyance 
until after the week of July 22, 1985, because the 
Congress was expected to approve funding for the 
Contras that week. After being pressed by the FBI 
agent, North "backed down" on this request, al-
though he expressed his view that FBI contact with 
the "prince" prior to the NSC's determination of the 
"prince's" true intentions likely would eliminate any 
possibility that the "prince" would aid the Contras. 
On his departure from North's office, the agent was 
introduced by North to Adolfo Calero, whom North 
called the "George Washington of Nicaragua"." 
After the North interview, the FBI agent attempted 
to contact Miller, who did not return several of the 
agent's telephone calls. North called the agent on July 
30, 1985, in apparent response to the agent's attempt 
to reach Miller. North told the agent that Miller and 
the "prince" were in Europe arranging a transfer of 
funds from the "prince" to the Contras." 
On August 27, the FBI agent finally interviewed 
Miller, who outlined the history of his contacts with 
the "prince." Miller mentioned that he knew North, 
but did not disclose anything to the agent about Nica-
ragua. In October, Miller was interviewed again by 
the FBI. During this session, he pledged complete 
cooperation with the fraud investigation.'" 
During the course of the grand jury investigation of 
the "prince," North called the FBI's Oliver Revell 
once again to express concern that Miller might be 
questioned about confidential governmental matters. 
North told Revell that Miller was a consultant to the 
NSC and the State Department on the hostage situa-
tion, but did not mention Miller's efforts on behalf of 
the Contras. At North's request, Revell called the 
Assistant United States Attorney who was handling 
the "prince's" prosecution in Philadelphia. Revell re-
lated the concern expressed by North, and was as-
sured by the prosecutor that, if Miller testified, he 
would not be questioned about any hostage-related 
activities.1?1 
According to Miller, he spent approximately 
$370,000 on the activities involving the "prince." 
North was aware of and approved these expenditures. 
On at least three occasions?two of which occurred 
after Miller agreed to cooperate fully in the investiga-
tion of the "prince"?Miller sent travelers checks to 
the "prince" in Europe.'" Although the "prince" 
requested these payments?which totalled $32,500?at 
least $15,000 was used to finance the DEA hostage 
rescue operations. North approved all such pay-
ments.1? 5 
These expenditures, however, did not result in 
monetary loss for Miller. He complained to North of 
the money that the "prince" had cost him, and North 
told Miller to take reimbursement for these costs from 
Contra assistance funds that he had transferred to

exempt organization.104 
In the end, it was determined that the "prince" was 
neither a "prince," nor even a Saudi. He was an 
Iranian con man, who pleaded guilty to bank fraud 
charges on the eve of his trial. He now is incarcerated 
in a federal penitentiary in Texas."5 
Instigation of Investigations 
North attempted to exploit his contacts with the FBI 
to attempt to instigate or intensify investigations of 
people and organizations perceived as threats to the 
Enterprise. He was ultimately assisted in this effort by 
Richard Secord and Glenn Robinette. 
In early 1986, Secord had been the target of allega-
tions that he was running guns and drugs between 
Central America and the United States. In May 1986, 
these allegations blossomed into a lawsuit filed in 
United States District Court for the Southern District 
of Florida. The lead plaintiffs in the action were re-
porters Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan, who were 
represented by the Christie Institute. The defendants 
included Secord, Thomas Clines, Theodore Shackley, 
and John Hull.' ?6 
At some point after the lawsuit was filed, North 
again contacted Oliver Revell, this time to suggest 
that the federal government ought to investigate the 
plaintiffs because he thought they were probably 
being funded or supported by the Sandinistas. Revell 
told him that the FBI did not engage in that type of 
investigation. 
07 
On May 9, the FBI interviewed North about al-
leged measures taken against him. North claimed that 
his car had been vandalized, he had been followed, 
and his dog had been poisoned. North also claimed a 
fake bomb device had been left in his mailbox. He had 
not kept the device, however, for the FBI to analyze. 
North told the FBI that he had written down the 
license number of the car that was used to follow 
him, but, after several requests from the FBI, he 
failed to provide it, claiming he lost the number.'" 
The FBI checked with the local police regarding 
the fake bomb device placed in North's mailbox. 
North had told them he discarded it before it could 
be examined. The FBI concluded it was probably a 
prank rather than a threat. 
On June 3, 1986, North met with FBI agents to 
discuss an investigation they had been conducting into 
allegations by North that he was the target of politi-
cally motivated vandalism and harassment, perhaps by 
foreign intelligence sources. At this meeting, North 
expressed his displeasure about the FBI's alleged lack 
of effort in the investigation. In particular, he com-
plained that the FBI had never contacted an NSC 
staffer who supposedly was the source of allegations 
linking North to drug traffic, had not investigated 
Daniel Sheehan of the Christic Institute, had not 
interviewed a reporter who claimed North had threat-
112 
ened him, had not examined allegations made by Sen-
ator Kerry against North, and had not attempted to 
interview Senator Durenberger and Representative 
Hamilton to determine the sources for allegations 
made against North about which they had raised 
questions.'" Despite these complaints, the FBI ulti-
mately closed its investigation after concluding that 
none of North's complaints could be traced to foreign 
intelligence sources." ? 
North ultimately hit on a better formula, however, 
with Secord's assistance. In March 1986, Secord had 
retained Glenn Robinette, a security consultant and 
former CIA officer, to conduct a private investigation 
of some of the individuals ultimately involved in the 
Honey and Avirgan lawsuit.' " One of the people 
Secord singled out for such treatment was Jack Ter-
rell, also known as "Colonel Flaco." Terrell had at 
one time been a pro-Contra mercenary associated 
with Tom Posey and CMA. He ultimately became 
disillusioned with the Contras, however, and began to 
cooperate with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. He threat-
ened to testify that North had helped provide secret 
funding to the Contras and that he, Terrell, had used 
CMA as a cover from which to carry out CIA-spon-
sored assassinations."2 
In mid-1986, the FBI received information from a 
classified source that pro-Sandinista individuals might 
have been contemplating an assassination of President 
Reagan. The FBI suspected that Terrell might be 
involved and disseminated this information to the 
CIA, Secret Service, State Department, Department 
of Justice, and NSC. " 3 
Shortly thereafter, on July 15, 1986, Revell re-
ceived a call from North, who indicated that he knew 
a person familiar with Terrell's activities and would 
make his contact available for debriefing.114 The FBI 
met that evening with Robinette, North's contact, 
who told them he had met Terrell on July 11 while 
posing as an attorney exploring the possibility of col-
laborating with Terrell on a book, movie, and televi-
sion program. Robinette, who was in daily contact 
with Terrell, offered to assist the FBI in gaining infor-
mation about him." 5 
On July 22, 1986, FBI agents interviewed North. 
He told them he had heard of Terrell eighteen 
months earlier when a Contra intelligence officer 
complained of Terrell's brutality.'" North claimed 
he suggested at the time of that incident that local 
officials should expel Terrell. North stated that he had 
heard that Terrell had tried to import guns into a 
Central American country and had claimed to be for-
merly with U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. 
The FBI agents asked North about Secord and 
Robinette. North said Secord ran an import-export 
business and was a consultant to the Defense Depart-
ment and emphasized Secord did not work for him. 
He said Robinette was a security consultant hired by 
Secord to investigate Terrell. North acknowledged he

met with Robinette prior to sending him to the FBI 
and that Robinette gave him copies of the Terrell 
manuscript and the other materials Robinette shared 
with the FBI. North stated that neither he nor his 
staff was responsible for arming, funding, or adminis-
tering Contra programs and denied he was involved 
with covert operations being run from the U.S."7 
The FBI decided to watch Terrell with Robinette's 
help. Although Robinette refused to wear a recording 
device, he reported back to the FBI after he met with 
Terrell. Shortly thereafter, Terrell went to Miami at 
the same time President Reagan visited Miami. 
Agents observed him there and concluded he was not 
a threat to the President. The FBI then terminated 
this investigation.' 18 
Summary 
These seven episodes collectively show how the NSC 
staff, and North in particular, tried to prevent expo-
sure of the Enterprise by law enforcement agencies. 
We do not mean to impugn the integrity of the law 
enforcement officials involved. Suggestions that na-
tional security could be compromised, coming from 
NSC aides, inevitably were given weight by law en-
forcement officials and led them on occasion to pro-
vide information to the NSC staff and to delay inves-
tigations. The fault lies with the members of the NSC 
staff who tried to compromise the independence of 
law enforcement agencies by misusing claims of na-
tional security.

occurred a few months before this conversation. According 
to von Raab, he received a telephone call from General 
Singlaub who inquired about a helicopter, the "Lady

American country. When von Raab informed Singlaub that 
the helicopter needed a license before it could be released, 
Singlaub indicated that he would obtain one. Singlaub then 
suggested that von Raab call North about the matter. When 
von Raab did so, North told him that the individuals in-

Kellner believes the call came from Mark Richard, Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, and 
had been sparked by a letter from Garcia's wife that had 
found its way to Richard's desk. Richard, on the other 
hand, does not recall being aware of the investigation until 
some time later in March, when he received a "buck slip" 
on the matter from Steven Trott, then Assistant Attorney 
General for he Criminal Division. Kellner Dep., 4/30/87, at

the Committees reflect any calls from the Department of 
Justice to Kellner on the afternoon of April 4. Because the 
federal government uses a separate network, "FTS," for 
intra-governmental telephone calls, commercial toll records 
are not useful. The General Services Administration, which 
maintains and monitors the FTS network, routinely records 
information for only 20% of the calls made on the network. 
A review of these records for April 1986 reveals a call on 
April ,4 from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General to 
the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida. The call took place at 11:33 a.m. and 
lasted only 1 minute. It was, therefore, too early and too 
brief to be the call described by Liewant, J20977-J21016. 
This evidence is not, of course, conclusive, since the call 
described by Liewant could have originated in Miami or 
could have been among the 80 percent originating at the 
Department of Justice but not recorded.

Keeping "USG Fingerprints" Off The Contra 
Operation: 1984-1985 
In October 1984, the President signed into law a ver-
sion of the Boland Amendment barring the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and 
"any other agency or entity of the United States in-
volved in intelligence activities" from providing sup-
port to Contra military activities. Explaining the stat-
ute on the floor of the House of Representatives im-
mediately before its passage, Representative Edward 
P. Boland, then Chairman of the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, was clear about the 
legislation's intent: the provision "ends U.S. support 
for the war in Nicaragua." National Security Advis-
er Robert C. McFarlane acknowledged that intent: 
"the Boland Amendment governed our actions," he 
told these Committees.2 Although Congress eventual-
ly approved humanitarian aid for the Contras and 
authorized intelligence sharing, the full prohibition on 
lethal support remained in effect until October 1986. 
Despite the Boland Amendment's prohibition, U.S. 
support for the Nicaraguan Resistance continued. As 
set forth fully in Chapters 2 and 3, members of the 
National Security Council staff?with help from offi-
cials of other Government agencies?supervised a 
covert operation supporting the Contras. They pro-
vided weapons and military intelligence to the Resist-
ance and resupplied troops inside Nicaragua, using 
funds raised from foreign countries, private citizens, 
and ultimately the Iranian arms sales. They did so 
despite the unambiguous intent of Congress that the 
U.S. Government, including the NSC staff, could not 
aid the Contras' military effort. 
Secrecy, therefore, was vital to the success of the 
Contra operation. Disclosure of U.S. support, Oliver 
North wrote to John Poindexter in May 1986, "could 
well become a political embarrassment for the Presi-
dent and you." 3 Moreover, disclosure would surely 
doom the project. Poindexter told these Committees: 
"It was very likely if it became obvious what we 
were doing that Members of Congress would have 
maybe tightened it [the law] up. I didn't want that to 
happen." 4 
* North's term used in two PROF notes to Poindexter dealing 
with the possible disclosure of the U.S. Government link to the 
Contra operation. [Exhibits OLN-131 and OLN-307', Hearings, 
100-7, Part III.] 
But just as secrecy was vital to the operation's 
success, even limited success jeopardized that secrecy. 
As the Contras continued to purchase supplies and 
equipment despite the cut-off of aid, Congress and the 
media inquired, inevitably, about the sources of Re-
sistance support and funding. 
Officials involved in the Contra support operation 
took every precaution to ensure that the project re-
mained secret. They withheld the facts from some 
Administration officials who spoke out frequently on 
U.S. policy in Central America, forcing them to mis-
lead Congress and the American people. They dis-
couraged reporters from pursuing the link between 
the NSC staff and the Contras. And they responded 
to direct inquiries with half truths and false state-
ments. 
1983-1984: Suspicions, and the 
"Casey Accords" 
Even before the full-prohibition Boland Amendment 
was enacted in October 1984, Members of Congress 
were concerned that the Administration was not pro-
viding sufficient information about the covert pro-
gram in support of the Nicaraguan Resistance. 
In April 1983, Senator Daniel Moynihan, Vice-
Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence, spoke of a "crisis of confidence" between Con-
gress and the intelligence agencies running the oper-
ation.5 A year later, Committee Chairman Barry 
Goldwater rebuked the CIA in the wake of the rev-
elations related to Nicaragua harbor mining. He wrote 
to CIA Director William Casey: "[W]e were not 
given the information we were entitled to receive." 6 
Expressing the sense of many in Congress, Goldwater 
said at an Intelligence Committee hearing: "We 
cannot play guessing games with the intelligence com-
munity if the relationship between legislative and ex-
ecutive branches is to work." 7 
After the mining incident became public in April 
1984, Director Casey was called before an extraordi-
nary secret session of the Senate-60 Members were 
present?to explain the failure to consult adequately 
ahead of time. The Director apologized at the session, 
and promised a new spirit of cooperation.5 The prom-
ise would soon be formalized in what became known

Chapter 6 
as the "Casey Accords," an agreement between the 
CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee on con-
sultation guidelines for covert operations. Under the 
agreement, the CIA would share explanatory material 
outlining the exact nature, goals, and risks of the 
covert operation. The CIA would also give prior 
notice of any "significant, anticipated intelligence ac-
tivity," even if the planned activity was part of an 
ongoing covert operation.9 
The accords reflected the recognition that coopera-
tion and forthrightness on covert activities were es-
sential in the relationship between the Executive and 
Congress. But the subsequent actions of Casey and 
members of the NSC staff did not reflect that recogni-
tion. 
1984: Testimony Before Congress 
on Third-Country Assistance 
In December 1983, the President signed into law leg-
islation limiting funding for the Contras in fiscal year 
1984 to $24 million.' ? The limit was the result of a 
compromise between the House, which hoped to cur-
tail support for the Contras, and the Senate, which 
favored continuing the aid. Explaining the compro-
mise on the floor of the House, Representative Boland 
said the $24 million, which would likely run out by 
June 1984, represented a "cap on funding from what-
ever source." Representative J. Kenneth Robinson, 
the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence 
Committee, said that the $24 million compromise 
meant "no additional funding could be made avail-
able" for the Nicaraguan Resistance "unless additional 
authorization and/or appropriations are approved by 
both Houses."12 
The Administration, however, sought funding for 
the Contras beyond the $24 million appropriation. On 
several occasions in 1984, officials tried to obtain aid 
for the Contras from third-country sources. Those 
attempts occurred as early as February, when the 
Administration began to suspect that Congress was 
not likely to approve supplemental funding for the 
Contras when the $24 million ran out." Shortly 
thereafter, McFarlane sought to obtain equipment, 
materiel and training for the Contras from Coun-
try 1.14 
In a March 27, 1984, memo, CIA Director Casey 
urged McFarlane to proceed with his plans to obtain 
aid from Country 1, and told him that the CIA was 
working along a second track to obtain assistance 
from that Country. Casey added in the memo that the 
CIA also was exploring "the procurement of assist-
ance from [Country 6]." That country had "indicat-
ed" that it might make "some equipment and training 
available" to the Contras." Country 1 rejected 
McFarlane's approach, and the advance to Country 6 
was called off, in part because of the revelations in 
April relating to the Nicaraguan harbor mining." 
118 
As McFarlane testified, those revelations left a 
"zero probability" that Congress would provide sup-
plemental funding for the Contras, "and no amount of 
wringing our hands was going to change that."17 In 
May or June, the National Security Adviser obtained 
a $1 million-a-month donation from Country 2, and 
informed the President, who expressed "satisfaction 
and pleasure" with the gift. McFarlane testified that 
he also shared the news with the Vice President." 
McFarlane informed the President of the donation 
using a notecard. He rejected the option of telling the 
President about the gift at a morning briefing because 
"there could be . . . as many as ten people in the 
room [and] I simply didn't know for sure who would 
be there." 9 
In order to further ensure that the new Contra 
funding remained secret, McFarlane did not share de-
tails of the gift with the Secretaries of State or De-
fense. McFarlane, who acknowledged that he regard-
ed the Country 2 contribution as a secret to be closely 
held, testified he told them in vague terms that the 
Contras "had been provided for through the end of 
the year."2? Neither Secretary of State Shultz nor 
Secretary of Defense Weinberger recall receiving any 
information on third-country funding until later.2' 
McFarlane also instructed North not to share news 
of the new funding with anyone; indeed, according to 
North, McFarlane never told him which country had 
contributed.22 North, in turn, instructed Contra 
leader Adolfo Calero: "never let agency [CIA] know 
of amt, source, or even availability [of the funds]. . . . 
No one in our govt. can be aware. . . . Your organiza-
tion must not be fully aware."" 
Stories about the third-country contacts soon began 
appearing in the media. In mid-April 1984, The Wash-
ington Post quoted anonymous sources speculating 
that third countries might be persuaded to provide 
money for the Contras.24 Administration officials 
were quoted in the story as flatly denying that the 
United States would approach foreign countries for 
assistance." In an article 4 days later discussing up-
coming U.S.-Israeli talks on Israeli assistance to Cen-
tral American countries, The Washington Post quoted 
State Department spokesman John Hughes as saying, 
"The United States has no intention of using third 
countries to finance covert action in Central Amer-
ica."" Although Hughes was not aware, his denial 
came at a time when the CIA and NSC staff were 
continuing their attempts to obtain third-country sup-
port. 
Prompted by the reports, the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence requested an ap-
pearance on May 2 by CIA Director Casey and Ken-
neth W. Dam, then Deputy Secretary of State. The 
testimony occurred about 5 weeks after Casey had 
sent the memorandum to McFarlane outlining the 
CIA's efforts to obtain lethal assistance for the Con-
tras from Country 1 and Country 6 and indicating

Chapter 6 
Casey's awareness of McFarlane's attempt to obtain 
assistance from Country 1. Coming only days after he 
had pledged to be fully candid with Congress, Casey's 
testimony was inconsistent with his memorandums: 
STOKES: . . . There has been some talk in the 
media with reference to [Country 1] or [Country 
2] being alternative funding sources. What can 
you tell us about that? 
CASEY: Well, there has been a lot of discussion. 
We have not been involved in that at all. 
FOWLER: Who has? 
CASEY: I do not know.27 
* 
FOWLER: . . . Is any element of our Govern-
ment approaching any element of another Gov-
ernment to obtain aid for the Contras? 
CASEY: No, not to my knowledge.28 
Kenneth Dam acknowledged to the Committees 
that "there have been conversations with [Country 
1]" about aid to the Contras and explained that those 
talks had led nowhere." He also said that there had 
been no "high level" approach to Country 2.30 Asked 
about Administration activities, Dam denied that the 
U.S. Government was approaching other countries 
for assistance: 
FOWLER: . . . Is the Administration actively 
looking for help, either in funding or in tactical 
aid to our [Contra] operation? 
DAM: . . . We are not making approaches to 
other Governments. So it is clear?you know, 
when you say 'actively' I do not know what is 
going on in terms of people's minds or conversa-
tions among people within the executive branch. 
We do not have a program of approaching other 
governments for support, and we are not doing 
so. 
FOWLER: . . . We want to know whether or 
not in light of serious questions about the Con-
gress' willingness to continue this funding, 
whether or not our Government in all of its 
ramifications is looking for help, both in funding 
and the possibility of some tactical or strategic or 
geopolitical?whatever you want to call it?help 
to our operations and policy in Nicaragua. 
DAM: All I can do is answer precisely, and that 
is what I am trying to do. We have no program 
of approaching other Governments. We are not 
currently approaching other Governments on this 
subject. I am not going to tell you we will not 
sometime in the future. We do not see this as a 
realistic approach. We do not see this as a solu-
tion, and I think that is a very precise answer." 
Dam's denials accurately reflected State Department 
policy but not Administration activities. There is no 
evidence that Dam was aware of the Casey and 
McFarlane third-country efforts or that he did not 
make his statements in good faith. However, Casey, 
who knew at least about the approaches to Countries 
1 and 6, did not correct Dam's statements. 
With the help of the Country 2 donation, the Con-
tras survived beyond the summer of 1984, when their 
Congressionally approved $24 million allotment had 
been exhausted. The donated funds began to flow in 
July, and by September 4 the Contras had received $3 
million.32 By then, Oliver North also had called on 
Richard Secord to purchase weapons for the Con-
tras.3 3 
On September 9, two major newspapers, The New 
York Times and the Miami Herald, published reports 
suggesting that third countries and private U.S. citi-
zens had replaced the CIA in providing aid to the 
Contras.34 The reports prompted another Congres-
sional inquiry. Three days after the stories appeared, 
the House Intelligence Committee called officials 
from the CIA and the State Department to appear 
before it. Members assumed that these officials?
Dewey Clarridge, the CIA's Latin American Division 
Chief, and Ambassador Anthony Langhorne Motley, 
Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Af-
fairs?would know whether the reports were true or 
false.35 
Clarridge told the Members that the CIA believed 
the Contras had been receiving about $1 million per 
month3 6?precisely what Country 2 had provided. 
He added, however, "We know of no place or no 
country that has supplied any funds in any real 
amount."37 Motley, who had not been informed of 
the contribution from Country 2, testified: 
FOWLER: Are we, is the United States of 
America, soliciting help for the Contras? 
MOTLEY: No. No. 
FOWLER: In other countries? 
MOTLEY: No. 
FOWLER: Are we encouraging other countries 
to participate? 
MOTLEY: No, no, and that's a very good point. 
FOWLER: Are we under any negotiations or 
discussions with any other countries to aid these 
efforts? 
MOTLEY: No.3 8 
Motley explained the "decision" made on this issue 
by senior Administration officials. As the $24 million

Chapter 6 
was running out, he said, the Administration decided 
that even though third-country solicitation was still 
"technically" permitted, a "feeling of mistrust" exist-
ed, and "in that context it was decided that we would 
not encourage and that we would not facilitate either 
other governments or in private groups within the 
United States. And to my knowledge, that has been 
honored." 3 9 
Committee member Wyche Fowler, Jr., responded 
that he had "a hard time believing . . . that our 
government does not know" how the Contras were 
surviving.40 Indeed, the President, the Vice Presi-
dent, and the National Security Adviser knew that 
Country 2 had made a substantial donation to the 
Contras. 
Early 1985: The Second Country 2 
Contribution 
In February 1985, the Administration obtained an ad-
ditional donation from Country 2. A $5 million depos-
it was made on February 27, 1985; by the end of 
March 1985, the amount totaled $24 million, bringing 
the total donation from that country to about $32 
million.4' Again, officials took steps to ensure that 
the funding remained secret. 
McFarlane withheld information about the new do-
nation from two likely recipients of Congressional 
inquiries on the subject of U.S. support for the Con-
tras: Secretary of State Shultz and CIA Director 
Casey.42 The President did not tell Shultz either, 
even though he briefed the Secretary on his meeting 
with the donor country's head of state shortly after 
that meeting.43 Shultz testified: "I don't think he [the 
President] is out to deceive me."44 (Secretary of De-
fense Weinberger, along with the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, found out about the donation 
independently.45) 
About Shultz, McFarlane testified that he "shared 
virtually everything?I think indeed everything?with 
the Secretary of State that I would learn of rel-
evance."'" Asked whether the reason he did not tell 
Secretary Shultz was "for his benefit, not for yours," 
McFarlane said yes.47 McFarlane further explained: 
"I am guessing that it [not telling Shultz] was prob-
ably out of concern for further dissemination and 
compromise of that relationship, and damage and em-
barrassment."'" State Department and CIA officials 
had been frequently questioned about the sources of 
Contra funding in 1984. And McFarlane's decision 
not to tell Secretary Shultz about the donation came 
shortly after The Washington Post publicized corre-
spondence between Representative Joseph P. Addab-
bo, the former Chairman of the Defense Subcommit-
tee of the House Appropriations Committee, and the 
State Department. In a December 11, 1984, letter, 
Addabbo had asked Shultz whether some countries 
receiving U.S. foreign assistance had diverted some of 
120 
those funds to the Contras. The State Department 
replied negatively one month later, and the corre-
spondence was the subject of an article on Janu-
ary 23.49 
Like McFarlane, North took action in February 
1985 to prevent disclosure of U.S. Government activi-
ties in support of the Contras. In a letter addressed to 
Calero about the new large donation, North revealed 
his intention to conceal facts from Congress: 
Please do not in any way make anyone aware of 
the deposit. Too much is becoming known by too 
many people. We need to make sure that this 
new financing does not become known. The 
Congress must believe that there continues to be 
an urgent need for funding.5? 
Within weeks of the new donation, Assistant Secre-
tary Motley was called to testify before the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations. On March 26, 1985, 
Senator Christopher Dodd asked about "a number of 
rumors or news reports around this town about how 
the Administration might go about its funding of the 
Contras in Nicaragua. There have been suggestions 
that it would be done through private groups or 
through funneling funds through friendly third na-
tions, or possibly through a new category of assist-
ance and asking the Congress to fund the program 
openly." Motley replied that the Boland Amendment 
prohibited "any U.S. assistance whether direct or in-
direct, which to us would infer also soliciting and/or 
encouraging third countries; and we have refrained 
from doing that because of the prohibition."5' 
Senator Dodd pursued the matter further: 
DODD: Well, that aside, looking at these resolu-
tions, there are always clever ways of discover-
ing something that may have been omitted. All I 
am asking from you is, and from the Administra-
tion more directly, is whether or not we can 
have an assurance that there will be no indirect 
efforts made to finance the Contra operation 
through third party nations or through other ve-
hicles within the foreign aid authorization to fi-
nance this operation, that you will proceed pursu-
ant to the resolution as adopted on the continuing 
resolution. 
MOTLEY: I think that was one thing that was 
loud and clear with us when I started. I told you 
that we understand what it means, direct and 
indirect, including third party. We take it to the 
letter of the law at its most liberal interpretation. 
And I can assure you that we have done it in the 
past. You want my assurances that we will con-
tinue to do it in the future, and if you feel that is 
necessary, I will so give it to you. 
DODD: We have that assurance, then.

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 6 
MOTLEY: That is right.52 
After Senator Dodd referred to the availability of 
possible loopholes, Ambassador Motley responded: 
We are going to continue to comply with the 
law. I am not looking for any loopholes. . . . 
Nobody is trying to play games with you or any 
other Member of Congress. That resolution [the 
Boland Amendment] stands, and it will continue 
to stand; and it says no direct or indirect. And 
that is pretty plain English; it does not have to be 
written by any bright, young lawyers. And we 
are going to continue to comply with that.53 
Again, Motley was not informed that the Adminis-
tration had obtained the donation from Country 2, 
that the National Security Adviser and the CIA had 
sought assistance from other countries, or that the 
NSC staff had begun to supervise the covert Contra 
operation out of its offices. 
Casey Briefing of Senate 
Intelligence Committee 
In late 1984 and early 1985, North sent CIA intelli-
gence information to the Contras through Robert 
Owen.54 The CIA Chief of the Central American 
Task Force (C/CATF), who ordinarily passed that 
information to North, denied to these Committees 
that he knew intelligence was being transmitted by 
North via Owen to the Contras.55 On April 17, 1985, 
CIA Director Casey, accompanied by Deputy Secre-
tary of State Dam, briefed the Senate Intelligence 
Committee on intelligence operations in Nicaragua. 
Casey told Committee members that, apart from intel-
ligence which might jeopardize the lives of Ameri-
cans, "we've kept out of any intelligence exchange 
. . . . We haven't been providing intelligence."56 
Prior to the date of the briefing, North had ob-
tained Richard Secord's assistance to purchase weap-
ons for the Contras with the funds donated from 
Country 2. North testified that Casey suggested 
Secord for this purpose.57 However, Casey assured 
the Members that "over the past year, we strictly 
honored in practice and in spirit the Congressionally 
mandated restrictions on military aid to the Con-
tras."58 He testified: 
CASEY: [Wle have carefully kept away from 
anything which would suggest involvement in 
their activities which have been carried on quite 
effectively and with considerable success in get-
ting support and getting weapons and getting am-
munition on their own. They've gone into the 
international arms markets. We know that from 
lots of sources that they were buying things from 
other countries and bringing in ammunition and 
been raising money. But we don't have any idea 
as to the quantity, what they got in the pipeline 
or?
CHAIRMAN: That's all I wanted to establish." 
Deflecting Media Inquiries 
By June 1985, reporters were close to establishing a 
link between the NSC staff and Contra support. A 
June 3 memo from North to Poindexter illustrates 
North's efforts to discourage reporters from pursuing 
the story. North boasted in the memo that at his 
request, Adolfo Calero told Alfonso Chardy of the 
Miami Herald "that if he (Chardi) [sic] printed any 
derogatory comments about the FDN or its funding 
sources that Chardi [sic] would never again be al-
lowed to visit FDN bases or travel with their units." 
North added: "At no time did my name or an NSC 
connection arise during their discussion."" 
North and retired Major General John K. Singlaub 
had already devised a plan to divert press attention 
away from the NSC staff's Contra operation, which 
by then was being coordinated under North by Rich-
ard Secord, Richard Gadd, and their employees. 
North encouraged Singlaub to court the media, realiz-
ing that, as Singlaub put it, "If I [Singlaub] had high 
visibility, I might be the lightening rod and take the 
attention away from himself [North] and others who 
were involved in the covert side of support."' 
The plan seems to have had some success. Shortly 
after his discussion with North, Singlaub was the sub-
ject of a long article in The Washington Post con-
necting him to support for the Contras," and in the 
coming months, he would be featured in virtually all 
the major newspapers. Although North himself soon 
would be the subject of press reports, Secord was not 
mentioned in the media until mid-1986, and details of 
North's resupply operation were not revealed until 
the plane carrying Eugene Hasenfus was shot down 
in October 1986. 
June-August 1985: Press Reports on 
NSC Staff and Contra Support 
By April, third-country funding had not only sus-
tained the Contras but had "allowed the growth of 
the Resistance from 9,500 personnel in June 1984 to 
over 16,000 today?all with arms," according to an 
April 11, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane." 
During May, according to a May 31 memo, "the 
Nicaraguan Resistance recorded significant advances 
in their struggle against the Sandinistas."64 
In June, reporters first linked the Contras' success 
with North. By mid-August, most major news organi-
zations had published or broadcast reports on this 
"influential and occasionally controversial character 
in the implementation of the Reagan Administration's 
foreign policy." 6 5

Chapter 6 
News stories in June 1985 explored the sources of 
Contra funding. On June 10, the Associated Press 
distributed an article by Robert Parry suggesting that 
the White House had lent support to private fundrais-
ing efforts. The article named North as the White 
House contact for such efforts, which according to 
the report, revolved around John Singlaub.66 
Two weeks later, the Miami Herald reported that 
the Administration "helped organize" and continued 
to support "supposedly spontaneous" private fundrais-
ing efforts. The article quoted extensively from ousted 
Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) leader Edgar 
Chamorro, who described a trip by North and a CIA 
officer to a Contra base in the spring of 1984. North 
and the CIA officer assured the rebels, according to 
the article, that the White House would "find a way" 
to keep the movement alive. Neither North nor the 
CIA officer specifically promised private aid, al-
though "it was clear that was their intent," Chamorro 
was quoted as saying.67 
In August, reports in The New York Times, The 
Washington Post, and other major newspapers assert-
ed that White House support for the Contras involved 
more than fundraising. Oliver North had given the 
Contras "direct military advice" on rebel attacks, ex-
ercising "tactical influence" on military operations, 
The New York Times reported. The newspaper re-
ported that North had also "facilitated the supplying 
of logistical help" to the Contras, filling in where the 
CIA could no longer help. The information was at-
tributed to anonymous "administration officials."69 
Denials 
The day after this story appeared, President Reagan 
responded to the allegations. "[W]e're not violating 
any laws," the President said as he signed legislation 
providing $27 million in humanitarian aid for the 
Contras and authorizing the exchange of intelli-
gence.69 In a statement released later that day, the 
President added that he would "continue to work 
with Congress to carry out the program as effectively 
as possible and take care that the law be faithfully 
executed." 7 ? 
The National Security Adviser made his first com-
ments on the allegations about North in an interview 
with The Washington Post. In an August 11 article, 
McFarlane said he had told his staff to comply with 
the Boland Amendment. "We could not provide any 
support," he said, but he also stated that the NSC 
staff could and did maintain contact with the Con-
tras.71 
Summer and Fall August 1985: 
Congressional Inquiries 
In the third week of August, Representative Michael 
Barnes, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Western 
Hemisphere Affairs of the House Committee on For-
122 
eign Affairs, and Representative Lee H. Hamilton, 
Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence, separately wrote the President's Na-
tional Security Adviser, inquiring into NSC support 
for the Contras." Representative Barnes' letter, dated 
August 16, cited press accounts as the cause of con-
cern about NSC staff support for the Contras. The 
reports, Barnes wrote, "raise serious questions regard-
ing the violation of the letter and spirit of U.S. law." 
The letter summarized the focus of his inquiry: 
Whether the NSC staff provided "tactical influence 
on rebel military operations;" whether the NSC staff 
was engaged in "facilitating contacts for prospective 
financial donors;" and whether the NSC staff was 
involved in "otherwise organizing and coordinating 
rebel efforts." 
Barnes made clear his view that such activities 
would violate the intent, if not the letter, of Congres-
sional restrictions on aid to the Contras: "Congres-
sional intent in passing the Boland Amendment was to 
distance the United States from the Nicaraguan rebel 
movement, while the Congress and the nation debated 
the appropriateness of our involvement in Nicaragua." 
The letter continued, "The press reports suggest that, 
despite congressional intent, during this period the 
U.S. provided direct support to the Nicaraguan 
rebels." Barnes' letter concluded with a request for all 
information and documents "pertaining to any contact 
between Lt. Col. North and Nicaraguan rebel leaders 
as of enactment of the Boland Amendment in Octo-
ber, 1984." 
Representative Hamilton's letter also cited press ac-
counts and expressed a concern about "actions that 
supported the military activity of the contras." He 
requested "a full report on the kinds of activities 
regarding the contras that the NSC carried out and 
what the legal justification is for such actions given 
the legislative prohibitions that existed last year and 
earlier this year." 
In addition to the requests from Representatives 
Hamilton and Barnes, two other inquiries were sent to 
McFarlane. On October 1, Senators David Duren-
berger and Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman and Vice 
Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence, sent a letter with specific questions, following 
up on a meeting with McFarlane." And on Octo-
ber 21, Representative Richard J. Durbin wrote 
McFarlane asking him to respond to charges made in 
the media. 7 4 
Responses to Congress: The 
McFarlane Letters 
As described fully in Chapter 3, the covert Contra 
support operation expanded substantially in the 
summer and fall of 1985. Until that point, North had 
arranged for funding, coordinated the purchase of 
arms, and passed military intelligence to the Contras.

Chapter 6 
Beginning with the July meeting at the Miami Airport 
hotel, North sought to broaden the project, attempt-
ing to replicate the earlier CIA covert operation. The 
Enterprise took control of third-country funds and 
other money obtained with the help of the NSC staff, 
and began to set up its own air resupply operation to 
provide weapons and material to Resistance troops 
inside Nicaragua. 
On September 5, McFarlane sent the first of his 
responses to Congress. He wrote to Representative 
Hamilton: "I can state with deep personal conviction 
that at no time did I or any member of the National 
Security Council staff violate the letter or spirit" of 
Congressional restrictions on aid to the Contras. In 
denying allegations about NSC staff activities, the 
letter echoed the language of the Boland Amendment: 
I am most concerned . . . there be no misgivings 
as to the existence of any parallel efforts to pro-
vide, directly or indirectly, support for military 
or paramilitary activities in Nicaragua. There has 
not been, nor will there be, any such activities by 
the NSC staff.75 
This letter, drafted by McFarlane himself, served as 
the model for five additional letters prepared by 
North, signed by McFarlane, and sent in September 
and October in response to Congressional inquiries.76 
In testimony before these Committees, McFarlane 
called these responses "too categorical."" He said: "I 
did not give as full an answer as I should have."78 
North went further, acknowledging that statements in 
the letters were "false," and summarizing the re-
sponses as "erroneous, misleading, evasive, and 
wrong." 7 9 
McFarlane wrote to Hamilton that he made his 
categorical denials only after he "thoroughly exam-
ined the facts and all matters which in any remote 
fashion could bear upon these charges."8? A review 
by the NSC staff did take place, but the actions taken 
in conjunction with that review leave it open to ques-
tion. 
First Reaction: Conceal the Facts 
When the Barnes letter arrived, Poindexter, who 
was then the Deputy National Security Adviser, as-
signed North to draft the response, noting on a memo 
he had received from a subordinate: "Barnes is really 
a trouble maker. We have good answers to all of 
this."' The "good answers," Poindexter acknowl-
edged in testimony, involved concealing NSC staff 
activities supporting the Contras: 
Q: And when you suggested that he prepare the 
first draft of the response, was it your intention 
that Colonel North be able to answer that letter 
with finessing a description of his activities? 
A: That is exactly right. 
Q: That is why you designated him as the action 
officer? 
A: That is right, because my objective here again 
would have been to withhold information.82 
McFarlane, meanwhile, had decided to draft the 
initial response himself. In preparation, he instructed 
Poindexter to assemble "records, files of all memoran-
dums, papers, travel vouchers, and so forth" relating 
to the Congressional inquiries." The Committees un-
covered no evidence to suggest that the officers who 
conducted the document search were aware of or 
attempted to conceal the full extent of NSC staff 
activities. The search, however, was conducted nar-
rowly. The information policy officer assigned by 
Poindexter to conduct the search wrote the following 
in a memo presenting plans for the document search: 
[T]he search should be as narrowly focused as 
was the request. In this case, Congressman 
Barnes has focused on `. . . documents, pertaining 
to any contact between Lt. Col. North and Nica-
raguan rebel leaders as of. . . October, 1984.' . . . 
Fishing expeditions in all files relating to Central 
America and/or Nicaragua are NOT necesssary 
to respond to the request.84 
The officer ruled out a search of the files in North's 
office, explaining, "they are 'convenience files' gener-
ally made up of drafts, and/or copies of documenta-
tion in the institutional and Presidential Advisory 
files."85 North's files, in fact, included nonlog memos, 
many PROF notes, his notebooks, and letters to 
Calero, Owen, and others. 
Finally, the officer noted that appointment and tele-
phone logs had become "favorite targets" of such 
Congressional inquiries, and suggested "[i]t may be in 
our interest to be terribly forthcoming and bury Mr. 
Barnes in logs of dates and/or names re meetings and 
telecons or perhaps to offer to do so putting him on 
notice that the logs give times and dates but no sub-
stance." She recommended, however, "that for now 
we limit the search of appointment and telephone logs 
to 011ie," thus leaving the search to the main target of 
the inquiry. Under the recommendation, North would 
be asked to sample the logs and "give us a sense of 
what they consist of and of the potential relevance to 
the request." 8 6 
Poindexter approved that recommendation, along 
with the other recommendation to begin a search of 
all Presidential and official NSC files. He also did not 
indicate any disagreement with the officer's statement 
that North's office files ought not be searched.87 
Within a few days, some 50 relevant documents were 
identified, and 10 to 20 were deemed worthy of 
review. They were given to Commander Paul 
Thompson, the NSC's General Counsel. On or about 
August 26, Thompson gave the documents to McFar-

lane, warning him that some warranted concern and 
raising the possibility of asserting executive privilege 
in response to the Barnes inquiry." 
The Six "Troubling" Memos 
McFarlane reviewed the documents and selected 
six memorandums which, despite the narrow focus of 
the search, "seemed to me to raise legitimate ques-
tions about compliance with the law." He added: 
"[A]n objective reading would have taken passages in 
each of these memorandums to be either reflective of 
a past act that was not within the law or a recommen-
dation that a future act be carried out that wouldn't 
be."99 
A summary of the six documents, all memos from 
North to McFarlane, follows: 
Memo of December 4, 1984: "Assistance for the 
Nicaraguan Resistance." 
The memo 90 described a meeting between North 
and an official of Country 4, a totalitarian country, a 
meeting undertaken "in accord with prior understand-
ing." 91 
At the meeting, according to the memo, North at-
tempted to convince the official to permit a sale of 
antiaircraft missiles and launchers to the Contras. The 
official had mistakenly believed that the weapons 
were intended for the Central American country 
listed on the end-user certificate. The memo shows 
North's efforts, only months after the most restrictive 
Boland Amendment went into effect, to obtain sophis-
ticated weapons for the Contras. 
The memo also recounted a meeting with Singlaub, 
who described his efforts to solicit aid for the Contras 
from two other countries located in the Far East. 
North wrote, "If it is necessary for a USG official to 
verify Calero's bona fides, this can be arranged."92 
Such an arrangement would constitute facilitation of a 
contribution to the Contras. Finally, the memo dis-
cussed David Walker, a former British Special Air 
Services officer who, in a meeting with North, of-
fered to conduct sabotage operations for the Resist-
ance. "Unless otherwise directed," North wrote, 
"Walker will be introduced to Calero and efforts will 
be made to defray the cost of Walker's operations 
from other than Calero's limited assets."93 
McFarlane testified that upon receiving this memo 
he believed that he asked Poindexter to investigate 
and "find out from Colonel North what had happened 
and how his actions squared with the law."94 The 
memo contains the notation: "Noted JP" in Poin-
dexter's handwriting.95 
Memo of February 6, 1985: "Nicaraguan Arms 
Shipment." 
The memo 96 noted that the Nicaraguan merchant 
ship, Monimbo, was about to pick up a load of arms 
for delivery to Nicaragua, a delivery that North 
124 
urged should be stopped. North noted, "if asked, 
Calero would be willing to finance the operation" to 
seize or sink the ship but does not have the personnel 
to do so. North suggested that foreign countries 
might be able to help.97 
North added that if time did not permit a "special 
operation" to seize the ship, "Calero can quickly be 
provided with the maritime assets required to sink the 
vessel before it can reach port of Corinto." 98 North 
recommended "that you authorize Calero to be pro-
vided with the information on Monimbo and ap-
proached on the matter of seizing or sinking the 
ship." National Security Council records indicate that 
McFarlane saw this memo and did not approve or 
disapprove. McFarlane testified that he did not ap-
prove.99 Admiral Poindexter wrote on the memo, 
"We need to take action to make sure ship does not 
arrive in Nicaragua." He attached a note saying, 
"Except for the prohibition of the intelligence com-
munity doing anything to assist the Freedom Fighters 
I would readily recommend I bring this up at CPPG 
[Crisis Pre-Planning Group meeting] at 2:00 today. Of 
course we could discuss it from the standpoint of 
keeping the arms away from Nicaragua without any 
involvement of Calero and Freedom Fighters." 100 
Memo of March 5, 1985: "[A Central American 
Country's] Aid to the Nicaraguan Resistance." 
The memo 101 requested McFarlane's signature on 
memorandums to senior Cabinet officers asking their 
views on increased U.S. aid to a Central American 
country. "The real purpose of your ?memo," North 
wrote, "is to find a way by which we can compensate 
[the country] for the extraordinary assistance they are 
providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.',102 
The attached memo did not include a reference to 
such a purpose. North attached to the memo for 
McFarlane false end-user certificates provided by the 
Central American country to cover nearly $8 million 
of munitions that were soon to be delivered to the 
FDN. The certificates, North wrote, "are a direct 
consequence of the informal liaison we have estab-
lished with [an official of the Central American coun-
try] and your meeting with him and [the country's] 
President." 103 The certificates were made out to 
Energy Resources International, a company owned 
by Albert Hakim and Secord. 
North added in the memo, "Once we have approv-
al for at least some of what they have asked for, we 
can ensure that the right people in [the Central Amer-
ican country] understand that we are able to provide 
results from their cooperation on the resistance 
issue." 104 
North recommended that McFarlane sign and 
transmit the attached memo to the other Cabinet offi-
cers. NSC records reflect that McFarlane approved 
the recommendation. However, McFarlane testified 
that aid was sought on its merits, and not to reward

the Central American country for helping the Con-
tras.1?5 
Memo of March 16, 1985: "Fallback Plan for the 
Nicaraguan Resistance." 
The memo 108 set out a plan to aid the Contras in 
the event that Congress did not do so. It included 
several recommendations. Among them: 
- The President publicly urge Americans to con-
tribute funds for humanitarian aid to the Contras. 
McFarlane wrote in the margin, "Not yet."?7 
- Creation of a tax-exempt corporation for dona-
tions. McFarlane wrote "Yes."1?8 
- "The current donors. . . be apprised of the plan 
and agree to provide additional $25-30M to the 
resistance for the purchase of arms and muni-
tions." McFarlane wrote "doubtful."109 
According to McFarlane, the term "current 
donors" referred to Country 2.110 
Memo of April 11, 1985: "FDN Military 
Operations." 
In the memo,' 11 North described how the Contras 
spent the $24.5 million "made available since USG 
funding expired," making clear that the funds ob-
tained by McFarlane went mostly for "arms, ammuni-
tion, and other ordnance items." 112 
North also wrote: 
Despite the lack of any internal staff organization 
. . . when the USG withdrew, the FDN has 
responded well to guidance on how to build a 
staff. Although there was a basic lack of familiar-
ity with how to conduct guerrilla-type oper-
ations, since July, all FDN commanders have 
been schooled in these techniques and all new 
recruits are now initiated in guerrilla warfare tac-
tics before being committed to combat. In short, 
the FDN has well used the funds provided and 
has become an effective guerrilla army in less 
than a year. "3 
North described Contra plans for "future oper-
ations," including a further increase in troops, a spe-
cial operations attack against the Sandinista Air 
Force, a ground military operation against a mine 
complex and, "the opening of a southern front . . . 
which will distract EPS units currently committed to 
the northern front."14 He continued: 
It is apparent that the $7M remaining will be 
insufficient to allow the resistance to advance 
beyond these limited objectives, unless there is a 
commitment for additional funds. The $14M 
which the USG may be able to provide will help 
to defray base camp, training, and support ex-
penses but will not significantly affect combat 
operations until early Autumn due to lead-time 
requirements. Efforts should, therefore, be made 
to seek additional funds from the current donors 
($15-20M) which will allow the force to grow to 
30-35,000.115 
North recommended "that the current donors be 
approached to provide $15-20M additional between 
now and June 1, 1985." 116 NSC records showed that 
McFarlane indicated no decision and returned the 
memo to the System IV files. McFarlane testified that 
he rejected North's recommendation and sought no 
further aid from Country 2. 
Memo of May 31, 1985: "The Nicaraguan 
Resistance's Near-Term Outlook." 
In the memo,' 17 North provided an update of 
Contra political and military activities. Among other 
things, he listed several important FDN military suc-
cesses and concluded: "These operations were con-
ducted in response to guidance that the resistance 
must cut Sandinista supply lines and reduce the effec-
tiveness of the Sandinista forces on the northern fron-
tier."118 North _concluded by noting, "[P]lans are un-
derway to transition from current arrangements to a 
consultative capacity by the CIA for all political mat-
ters and intelligence, once Congressional approval is 
granted on lifting Section 8066 restrictions [the 
Boland Amendment]."119 He added: "The only por-
tion of current activity which will be sustained as it 
has since last June, will be the delivery of lethal 
supplies.'5120 
North recommended that McFarlane brief the 
President on these matters.'21 NSC records do not 
indicate whether McFarlane approved this recommen-
dation. 
Undiscovered Documents 
The memos Thompson presented to McFarlane in 
late August 1985 did not represent all the memos 
written by North to McFarlane demonstrating 
North's involvement in supporting the Contras. Be-
cause it was limited by the information policy officer 
to official NSC and Presidential Advisory files, the 
search would not uncover "nonlog" memorandums. 
In one such memo, dated November 7, 1984, North 
made clear that he was attempting to pass intelligence 
information about Sandinista HIND helicopters to 
Calero.'22 
Nor did the search turn up relevant logged memo-
randums in which North indicated that he and Contra 
leaders had planned the timing of rebel military oper-
ations. For example, a March 20, 1985, memo stated: 
In addition to the events depicted on the internal 
chronology at Tab A, other activities in the 
region continue as planned?including military

operations and political action. Like the chronol-
ogy, these events are also timed to influence the 
vote: 
- planned travel by Calero, Cruz and Robelo; 
- various military resupply efforts timed to sup-
port significantly increased military operations 
immediately after the vote (we expect major San-
dinista crossborder attacks in this time frame?
today's resupply. . . went well); and 
- special operations attacks against highly visible 
military targets in Nicaragua.' 23 
McFarlane-North Alteration 
Discussions 
On August 28, McFarlane and North began a series 
of lengthy meetings to fashion a response to the Con-
gressional inquiries. According to a chronology pre-
pared by McFarlane, they met six times and spoke by 
phone four times between August 28 and September 
12, the date of the response to Representative 
Barnes.'" Although both McFarlane and North ac-
knowledged to the Committees that they discussed 
altering the documents, the two dispute the purpose 
of the meetings. 
McFarlane maintained that the meetings, together 
with the document review, constituted his investiga-
tion into North's activities, an investigation, he said, 
that turned up no proof of illegal activities.125 For 
example, he asked North about allegations relating to 
fundraising. According to McFarlane, North respond-
ed that he had not solicited or encouraged donations, 
that he merely told potential donors, "if you want to 
be helpful to the Contras, go to Miami, they're in the 
phone book they have an office, and do it your-
selves."' 26 
The two reviewed the documents and, according to 
McFarlane, North explained that his memos were 
being misinterpreted. For example, in one memo 
North wrote that the FDN "has responded well to 
guidance on how to build a staff," and that "all FDN 
commanders have been schooled" in guerrilla warfare 
tactics.127 McFarlane said North told him, contrary 
to any implication in the document, that the guidance 
came not from him but from retired military officers 
hired by the Contras.128 As McFarlane related the 
events, North offered to alter the documents and 
McFarlane gave him a tentative go-ahead. McFarlane 
testified: 
Well, as we went through them, he pointed out 
where my own interpretation was just not accu-
rate . . . and he just said, you are misreading my 
intent, and I can make it reflect what I have said 
126 
if this is ambiguous to you, and I said all right, 
do that.129 
North shortly returned with a sample alteration. 
McFarlane's testimony indicates that the document 
North had altered was "FDN Military Operations," 
dated April 11, 1985. The recommendation in the 
document, "that the current donors be approached to 
provide $15-20M additional between now and June 1, 
1985" was replaced with a recommendation that "an 
effort must be made to persuade the Congress to 
support the Contras."13? North had asserted, accord-
ing to McFarlane, that the problem with the docu-
ments was one of interpretation and that the changes 
would be slight. McFarlane acknowledged that this 
alteration left the document "grossly at variance with 
the original text."131 
McFarlane testified that he did not replace any 
original NSC documents with altered documents and 
did not instruct North to do so. He said he took with 
him when he resigned the pages North had altered 
and eventually destroyed them.132 
North's version of events is substantially different. 
McFarlane, North testified, brought the selected doc-
uments to his attention, "indicated that there were 
problems with them, and told me to fix them." This 
meant, he testified, that he was to "remove references 
to certain activities, certain undertakings on my behalf 
or his, and basically clean up the record."133 The 
documents, North acknowledged, "clearly indicated 
that there was a covert operation being conducted in 
support of the Nicaraguan Resistance."34 That is 
why, North testified, McFarlane instructed him to 
alter them: 
The documents, after all, demonstrated his 
[McFarlane's] knowledge and cognizance over 
what I was doing, and he didn't want that. He 
was cleaning up the historical record. He was 
trying to preserve the President from political 
damage. I don't blame him for that.135 
North testified that he did not abide by McFarlane's 
instruction until shortly before his dismissal: "I saw 
towards the end of my tenure that this list still had 
not been cleaned up, and so I went and got the 
documents out of the system and started revising the 
documents."136 
Although the record is inconclusive on what exact-
ly McFarlane and North discussed at their meetings, 
it is undisputed that both the National Security Advis-
er and one of his principal staff members considered 
altering NSC documents. They discussed this course 
after receiving requests from several Members of 
Congress for access to precisely those types of docu-
ments.

Responses to Congress: The 
Denials 
Within days of his document review and discussions 
with North, McFarlane sent the first of his responses 
to Congress. In addition to the broad assurance that 
the NSC staff was complying with the "letter and the 
spirit" of the Boland Amendment, the responses con-
tain specific denials of allegations that the NSC staff 
had provided fundraising or military support to the 
Nicaraguan resistance. 
Fundraising 
McFarlane's September 12 response to Representa-
tive Barnes stated: "None of us has solicited funds, 
[or] facilitated contacts for prospective potential do-
nors. . . ."137 
In his October 7 letter, McFarlane replied as fol-
lows to a written question from Representative Ham-
ilton: 
Mr. Hamilton: The Nicaraguan freedom fighters, 
in the last two months, are reported by the U.S. 
Embassy, Tegucigalpa, to have received a large 
influx of funds and equipment with some esti-
mates of their value reaching as high as $10 mil-
lion or more. Do you know where they have 
obtained this assistance? 
Mr. McFarlane: No.138 
In fact, according to his own testimony, McFarlane 
not only knew how the Contras obtained financial 
assistance, he personally facilitated the main donation 
to the Contras: 
Q: . . . I was referring to Country Two and the 
fact that the actual donors had, as I understand it, 
Country Two was the actual donors?
A: Yes. 
Q: And that you had not only facilitated con-
tacts, but you had facilitated the actual contribu-
tion. 
A: I will accept that, yes.138 
Furthermore, according to Assistant Secretary of 
State Gaston Sigur and North, McFarlane was aware 
of Sigur's efforts to obtain a donation from a Far 
Eastern country?efforts that took place while the 
responses to Congress were being prepared. North, of 
course, was aware of that approach. Indeed, on 
August 28, the day he and McFarlane had their first 
lengthy meeting to discuss the Congressional inquir-
ies, North reassured an official from that country that 
the United States would be grateful if his country 
made a contribution to the Contras.14? The country 
responded with a $1 million gift."' 
Also, in his letter of September 12, Representative 
Hamilton asked: 
Has Colonel North been the focal point within 
the NSC staff for handling contacts with private 
fundraising groups, such as the World Anti-Com-
munist League and the Council for World Free-
dom headed by retired Major General John K. 
Singlaub? 
McFarlane replied, .6p,10.99142 In fact, however, 
North had been dealing with Singlaub on fundraising, 
as the December 4, 1984, North-to-McFarlane memo 
showed. As North told the Committees, he "certainly 
saw General Singlaub a lot related to support for the 
Nicaraguan Resistance."143 
Military Assistance 
In his September 5 letter, McFarlane stated: 
At no time did we encourage military activities. 
Our emphasis on a political rather than a military 
solution to the situation was as close as we ever 
came to influencing the military aspect of their 
struggle.144 
North was heavily involved in the military aspect 
of the Contra struggle. He testified that this statement 
was false.'" In addition to helping arm the Contras, 
and to providing intelligence and cash to Contra lead-
ers, North also, beginning in the summer of 1985, 
coordinated the efforts to set up a resupply operation 
to provide lethal and nonlethal supplies to troops 
inside Nicaragua. Several weeks before the letters 
were drafted, North asked Secord to set up the oper-
ation, and he called on Ambassador Lewis Tambs to 
facilitate the construction of an airfield for refueling 
resupply aircraft.'" Yet, McFarlane wrote to Repre-
sentative Hamilton on October 7: 
Lieutenant Colonel North did not use his influ-
ence to facilitate the movement of supplies to the 
resistance.147 
North acknowledged that this statement was false.'" 
It is unclear whether McFarlane was fully aware of 
North's activities. McFarlane testified he was not.'" 
But the documents McFarlane reviewed and about 
which he was concerned shortly before drafting the 
first response to Congress showed that North repeat-
edly attempted to influence the military aspect of the 
Contras' struggle. 
Furthermore, McFarlane specifically denied in his 
October 7 letter to Representative Hamilton that 
North had provided the Contras "tactical advice": 
The allegation that Lieutenant Colonel North of-
fered the resistance tactical advice and direction 
is, as I indicated in my briefing, patently 
untrue.153 
127

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 6 
North acknowledged to the Committees that although 
he never "sat down in the battlefield and offered 
direct tactical advice . . . I certainly did have a 
number of discussions with the Resistance about mili-
tary activities, yes, to include the broader strategy for 
the Southern front and an Atlantic front and an inter-
nal front."5' And McFarlane testified: "I felt it was 
likely that an officer of the qualifications and excel-
lence of Col. North, when he was down visiting in 
Central America, probably did extend advice."152 
Indeed, McFarlane admitted in his testimony that he 
felt in 1985 that "it was likely" that North had gone 
"beyond the law" on giving military advice to the 
Contras.153 He testified: "But without certain evi-
dence of it, not being able to disapprove it, I accepted 
that [the denials McFarlane said North gave him] as 
sufficient grounds for saying it as truth, and I believe 
that I was wrong to do so. But that is why I sent 
McFarlane maintained that he believed at the time 
that such advice was not the "central concern" of 
Congress. "It seemed to me that that was inconse-
quential to the outcome of the conflict, and probably 
not in the eyes of Congress a serious matter," he 
said.'55 Representative Barnes' letter, however, 
shows that one of his main concerns was about re-
ports that North had provided "'tactical influence' on 
rebel military operations."56 In addition, Representa-
tive Hamilton, in his first letter, expressed an interest 
"in actions that supported the military activity of the 
contras."57 Each of the other letters from Congress 
asks McFarlane to respond to specific allegations 
about NSC military support for the Contras. In any 
case, McFarlane in his letters offered no such explana-
tion, merely a flat denial. 
Finally, despite his assertion in his letters to Con-
gress, McFarlane himself influenced the Contras' mili-
tary struggle. The $32 million obtained with his help 
from Country 2 enabled the Resistance to purchase 
weapons to continue fighting. The April 11, 1985, 
memo from North describing how the funds were 
expended stated clearly that the donation was being 
used to purchase lethal supplies.'58 
McFarlane's Meetings with Members 
The denials McFarlane made in his letters were 
repeated in face-to-face meetings with Members of 
Congress. On September 5, Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence Chairman Durenberger and Vice 
Chairman Leahy questioned McFarlane in an hour-
long private briefing. At the start of their meeting, 
McFarlane showed the two Senators a copy of the 
letter he would send to Representative Hamilton that 
day. McFarlane assured Senators Durenberger and 
Leahy that "no law had been broken," and that 
"there was no intent to circumvent restrictions Con-
128 
gress placed on aid to the Nicaraguan Resistance." 
Asserting that he had grilled North on his involve-
ment with supporters of the Resistance, McFarlane 
said he was confident that "[N]o NSC staff member 
either personally assisted the Resistance or solicited 
outside assistance on their behalf." Senator Leahy de-
scribed the meeting in a letter written shortly thereaf-
ter: 
Mr. McFarlane said that the officer [North] had 
frequently received calls from persons wishing to 
donate funds, and that he referred them to the 
Contra leaders themselves. He insisted that the 
officer never solicited funds, encouraged dona-
tions or initiated contacts with potential donors. 
He further denied that the officer, in several per-
sonal meetings with Contra leaders, both in 
Washington and in Central America, ever offered 
military advice. The officer's authorized role, Mr. 
McFarlane said, was to assure the Contras during 
the time of the Congressional aid cutoff of the 
President's continued moral support. . . .'69 
McFarlane concluded by telling the Senators, "I can't 
believe everything everyone says, but I do believe 
011ie." 160 
After the session, Senator Durenberger told a re-
porter that he felt McFarlane was candid about his 
knowledge, but that questions about U.S. Government 
support for the Contras remained: 
So we came away from the meeting feeling that 
from Bud McFarlane we're getting what he be-
lieves to be the situation with regard to his staff. 
Are we satisfied that this sort of concludes the 
matter and that no one in any way involved was 
directing the effort? No, you can't be satisfied.'61 
On September 10, McFarlane met with Representa-
tive Hamilton and other Members of the House Intel-
ligence Committee. As Representative Hamilton later 
summarized the meeting in a letter to a colleague, 
McFarlane told the Committee Members that Presi-
dent Reagan had made clear that the entire executive 
branch had to comply with the Boland Amendment. 
McFarlane said he had conducted a thorough investi-
gation into allegations made about the NSC staff and 
concluded that North had not "given military advice 
of any kind to the Contras," nor had he "solicited, 
accepted, transmitted or in any other way been in-
volved with funds for the Contras. 
"162 
The House Intelligence Committee Chairman ac-
cepted the denials of the National Security Adviser. 
At the close of the session, Mr. Hamilton told McFar-
lane, "I for one am willing to take you at your 
word."163

Chapter 6 
McFarlane-Barnes Document 
Dispute 
In his first response to Representative Barnes on Sep-
tember 12, McFarlane ignored the Congressman's re-
quest for documents. A PROF note to Paul Thomp-
son on September 20 indicated that McFarlane be-
lieved he had successfully sidestepped the document 
issue: "Now that we have the Barnes letter behind us 
you can return the Contra papers to 011ie please.)9164 
Ten days later, however, Representative Barnes re-
newed his document request. In a letter to McFarlane 
dated September 30, 1985, the Congressman wrote: 
I am sure you understand that the pertinent docu-
ments must be provided if the Committee is to be 
able to fulfill its obligation to adopt legislation 
governing the conduct of United States foreign 
policy and to oversee the implementation of that 
policy under the law.'65 
Congressman Barnes went on to explain why he felt 
strongly about his Committee's need to review the 
documents: 
It may be helpful if I spell out more clearly the 
interest of the Committee. The Committee retains 
its concern about possible violations of federal 
law by members of the NSC staff. However, that 
is not the Committee's only?or even primary?
concern, given that the enforcement of the law is 
an Executive Branch function. It is the Commit-
tee's responsibility, however, to conduct over-
sight of laws that limit the activities of the Exec-
utive Branch under the Committee's jursidiction, 
and to reach judgments as to whether changes in 
the law are indicated by those activities. Even if 
the Committee determined that the activities of 
the NSC staff on this matter were entirely legal, 
the Committee might still determine that changes 
in the law were necessary. I am sure it is obvious 
to you that the Committee cannot make those 
judgments unless it has in its possession all infor-
mation, including memorandums and other docu-
ments, pertaining to any contact between the 
NSC staff and Nicaraguan rebel leaders. I would 
hereby renew my request for such information, 
both oral and documentary. '66 
Thus, the Barnes letter of September 30 emphasized 
that Congress was entitled to know about the NSC's 
efforts to support the Contras, even if those efforts 
were legal. Once apprised of the facts, Congress 
would determine whether additional legislation was 
required, including closing any loophole in the 
Boland Amendment that the NSC staff might have 
claimed. 
Representative Barnes and McFarlane met at the 
White House on October 17. The day before the 
meeting, NSC General Counsel Paul Thompson pre-
pared a memo for McFarlane suggesting that Repre-
sentative Barnes should be told that the National Se-
curity Adviser had no legal authority to turn over the 
documents. North's actions, Thompson wrote, were at 
the National Security Adviser's direction "in further-
ance of the President's initiatives." Documents per-
taining to North's actions in carrying out the Presi-
dent's instructions "are internal and deliberative in 
nature and are furthermore not NSC agency docu-
ments. As Presidential advisory papers, they fall 
under the dominion of the President and are no 
longer subject to your disposition."167 
At the meeting with Congressman Barnes, McFar-
lane, referring to a stack of documents on his desk, 
explained that a document search had been made and 
that McFarlane had selected documents relevant to 
Congressional inquiries. He told Congressman Barnes 
he would not permit the documents to leave his office 
but would allow the Congressman to read them there. 
McFarlane acknowledged that he made the offer 
knowing Representative Barnes would likely refuse it: 
Q: And I take it?it was part of your thinking 
that if a busy Congressman came down to your 
office and saw a substantial stack of documents, 
and you were having a short meeting [McFarlane 
had budgeted one hour for the session], it was 
very unlikely that he would ask to read through 
the documents from one end to the other? 
A: I think that is true, yes."8 
Indeed, Representative Representative Barnes deemed the offer not 
to be serious. He understood McFarlane to imply that 
the documents on the desk were not all the docu-
ments but only the ones McFarlane had concluded 
were "relevant." This, Barnes felt, "was not an ade-
quate way to ascertain the truth of the allegations." 
Furthermore, Representative Barnes believed that 
prohibiting staff from reviewing the documents would 
result in an incomplete investigation: "[I]n my experi-
ence the only way you can do a good investigation is 
to compare documents?one to another?and to ana-
lyze these with staff who have the time and back-
ground to work at putting them in context." McFar-
lane's offer, therefore, "didn't seem like a serious pro-
posal."169 
On October 29, Representative Barnes wrote 
McFarlane again expressing his view that the proce-
dures mandated by McFarlane were "inadequate."'" 
He requested that McFarlane turn the documents 
over to the House Intelligence Committee, thereby 
assuring that the classified materials would be appro-
priately handled. Representative Barnes wrote: "I be-
lieve that this proposal would surely resolve any con-
cerns that the Administration might have about the 
security of the information, while at the same time 
fulfilling the responsibilities of the House."7' This

Chapter 6 
was the last correspondence between McFarlane and 
Representative Barnes on this issue. 
North, however, tried unsuccessfully to convince 
McFarlane to send one more letter?a response North 
maintained he would have preferred to send at the 
start.'" In the draft letter, McFarlane refused out-
right to turn over documents claiming that they were 
"internal Presidential documents regarding sensitive 
relations with other governments."73 The executive 
branch, the letter said, "must abide by its commit-
ments to other governments not to compromise sensi-
tive information."174 The letter stated that disclosure 
of the documents sought by Barnes would "adversely 
effect the national security of the United States and 
endanger our citizens."' 7 5 
McFarlane's 1986 Testimony 
In the wake of the November 1986 relevations and a 
full year after he left office, McFarlane testified 
before several panels investigating the Iran-Contra 
Affair: the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, 
the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees, 
and the President's Special Review Board (The 
Tower Board). Again, Members of Congress?and 
this time officials on the Tower Board staff as well?
were unable to learn the crucial facts about the Gov-
ernment's actions in support of the Nicaraguan Resist-
ance. 
The former National Security Adviser acknowl-
edged to the panels that North had told him in May 
1986 about the diversion of Iranian arms sales funds 
to the Contras. That aspect of Administration support 
for the Resistance, by the time of McFarlane's De-
cember 1986 testimony, had been revealed by the 
Attorney General. Beyond that, McFarlane withheld 
virtually all other relevant information in his posses-
sion about U.S. support for the Contras during the 
period of Congressional restrictions. He concealed 
new information he learned of North's activities in 
1986, and he repeated many of the inaccurate state-
ments that he had made orally and in writing to 
Members of Congress while he was National Security 
Adviser. 
In his testimony before the Select Committees, 
McFarlane acknowledged that his remarks to investi-
gating panels between December 1986 and February 
1987, like his statements about U.S. support of the 
Resistance in 1984 and 1985, had been "clearly too 
categorical." 7 6 
McFarlane's Testimony on North's 
Activities in 1986 
On December 1, 1986, while he was testifying 
before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 
McFarlane was asked whether, after his resignation, 
there were "any indications" about "North's involve-
130 
ment in the funding [of the Contras] either directly or 
indirectly." McFarlane responded: 
Well, since leaving Government my only basis 
for knowing anything more about the issue is 
what I read in the press and the events that I 
described this morning about what I was told 
about the diversion of Iranian money in May of 
this year. So I have no personal basis for cor-
roborating the press stories that I've seen that 
have alleged that Col. North has done various 
things to channel money and to advise and done 
business with arms merchants. I have no inde-
pendent knowledge of that and I guess the only 
thing that I do know first hand from Col. North 
was what he told me about diversion of Iranian 
monies. I've described that this morning.'" 
In fact, despite his assertion that he had "no person-
al basis for corroborating" allegations about North, 
and that "the only thing" he knew "first hand from 
Col. North" was the diversion, McFarlane had 
learned directly from North in 1986 about efforts to 
provide funds and weapons to the Resistance. Indeed, 
McFarlane had offered to assist. After his resignation, 
McFarlane communicated regularly with the NSC 
staff via a PROF machine he was permitted to keep 
in his home. PROF messages in 1986 show that North 
freely shared with McFarlane details of the NSC-
coordinated Contra operation, despite North's strong 
desire to hold close information about the project. 
The following exchange between North and McFar-
lane about efforts to obtain sophisticated Blowpipe 
missiles for the Resistance is illustrative. In late 
March, North wrote to McFarlane about efforts to 
obtain sophisticated surface-to-air missiles for the 
Contras: 
After the House vote on aid to the resistance, I 
plan to take a few days just to get re-acquainted 
w/ the family. Meanwhile, we are trying to find 
a way to get 10 BLOWPIPE launchers and 20 
missiles from . . . thru the Short Bros. Rep. The 
V.P. from Short Bros. sought me out several 
mos. ago and I met w/ him . . . a few weeks ago 
. . . . Short Bros., the mfgr. of the BLOWPIPE, 
is willing to arrange the deal, conduct the train-
ing and even send U.K. "tech reps" fwd if we 
can close the arrangement. Dick Secord has al-
ready paid 10% down on the delivery and we 
have a [Central American country] EUC [end 
user certificate] which is acceptable to. . . .178 
McFarlane replied about one week later: 
I've been thinking about the blowpipe problem 
and the Contras. Could you ask the CIA to iden-
tify which countries the . . . have sold them to. I 
ought to have a contact in at least one of them. 
How are you coming on the loose ends for the

Chapter 6 
material transfer? Anything I can do? If for any 
reason, you need some mortars or other artil-
lery?which I doubt?please let me know.'" 
In another message to McFarlane, dated April 21, 
1986, North provided details on the resupply oper-
ation. "So far," he wrote, "we have seven A/C [air-
craft] working, having delivered over $37M in sup-
plies and ordnance . . . ." In the message, North also 
discussed the need to obtain new funding for the 
Contras. "The resistance support acct is darned near 
broke," he wrote. "Any thoughts where we can put 
our hands on a quick $3-5M? Gaston [Sigur] is going 
back to his friends who have given $2M so far in 
hopes that we can bridge things again, but time is 
running out along w/ the money." Sigur recalled 
making no such approach in 1986.1" Demonstrating 
to McFarlane his operational control of the resupply 
program, North added that he had told Secord to sell 
"the ship first and then the a/c [aircraft] as a means of 
sustaining the effort." He then proposed to McFarlane 
that U.S. businessman Ross Perot be approached for 
funds. "As you know, we've never asked him for help 
in this regard, believing that he wd be inclined to talk 
about it," North wrote, an indication that he and 
McFarlane had discussed funding alternatives. "It 
may now be time to take that risk. Any thoughts?"181 
The reference in the PROF to Richard Secord's 
involvement in the Contra operation is not the only 
such reference. In February 1986, North sent a PROF 
message to McFarlane in which he said that he had 
"asked JMP [Poindexter] for a session w/ you and 
Dick Secord as soon as possible after Dick returns 
tomorrow night from Eur[ope] where he is setting up 
an arms delivery for the Nic[araguan] resistance. A 
man of many talents ol' Secord i5."182 In his testimo-
ny before the Select Committees, McFarlane specifi-
cally acknowledged that he was aware in 1986 that 
"Secord was involved in helping the Contras."83 
But on December 10, 1986, testifying before the 
House Intelligence Committee, McFarlane denied any 
such knowledge. Representative Brown asked: "Let 
me ask about Gen. Secord . . . . Were you aware of 
the fact that he had a role in the Contra supply 
operation?" McFarlane replied, "No sir."84 
Testimony on Fundraising Activities 
As described above, McFarlane arranged for two 
large donations totalling about $32 million from 
Country 2, telling a high official of that country about 
U.S. concerns and the Contras' needs, and then pro-
viding the bank account number when the country 
decided to donate funds. The first gift came in 1984 
and the second in February and March 1985. 
In his testimony before Congress following the No-
vember 1986 disclosures, McFarlane denied personal 
knowledge of the donations by Country 2. During 
McFarlane's testimony on December 8, 1986, before 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative 
Mel Levine asked: "There have been also press re-
ports that" Country 2 has been "indirectly involved in 
financing the Contras. Are you aware of any such 
activities?" McFarlane replied: "I have seen the re-
ports and I have heard that" Country 2 has contribut-
ed. However, he said, "The concrete character of that 
is beyond my ken."185 
Similarly, McFarlane testified at that session in re-
sponse to a question from Representative Edward F. 
Feighan that he had "seen the reports that various 
countries have" donated funds to the Contras, includ-
ing Country 2. He testified: "I have no idea of the 
extent of that or anything else."86 
Acknowledging before the Select Committees that 
his testimony was "not as full an account as I could 
have given," McFarlane maintained nevertheless that 
his earlier testimony was "technically accurate."87 
He told the Committees that even though he had 
facilitated the donations, he did not precisely know 
the extent of the contribution or the exact total of the 
deposits. However, such precision was scarcely the 
focus of the questions from the Members of Congress. 
Moreover, the April 11, 1985, North memo which 
McFarlane reviewed in connection with the summer 
1985 Congressional inquiries, described in great detail 
the extent of the donation.'" 
Members of both the House and Senate Intelligence 
Committees specifically asked McFarlane if he still 
stood by his 1985 statement that there was no "official 
or unofficial" relationship involving any member of 
the NSC staff and fund-raising for the Nicaraguan 
Resistance.189 Despite his role in the two contribu-
tions from Country 2, and despite the knowledge that 
North and Sigur said he had of Sigur's discussions 
with Country 3 about a possible donation?all of 
which occurred during his tenure as National Securi-
ty Adviser?McFarlane stood by his statement: "I 
believe as I did then that that was true throughout my 
time and association with the NSC."9? 
On December 18, in his second appearance before 
the Senate Intelligence Committee following the No-
vember disclosures, McFarlane acknowledged for the 
first time that he "believe[d]" Country 2 had donated 
funds. He knew of the donation, he testified, only 
because Secretary Weinberger told him: "I think that 
is the only one I ever heard about but I was told by 
the Secretary of Defense that there had been a contri-
bution by [Country 2], and I don't know that I could 
put a date on it."'81 
Six weeks after this testimony, McFarlane wrote 
the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee to correct his statements. In his 
letter, he described the 1984 donation, maintaining, as 
he did before the Select Committees, that he had not 
solicited the gift. McFarlane did not mention the 
second contribution from Country 2. He wrote: "At 
no time from that moment [spring 1984] to this date,

Testimony on 1985 Activities 
As McFarlane acknowledged before these Commit-
tees, the documents he gathered in response to the 
summer 1985 Congressional inquiries, "raise[d] legiti-
mate questions about compliance with the law."193 In 
his testimony following the diversion disclosure, 
McFarlane not only withheld his concerns about the 
documents, but asserted that they proved that North 
had fully complied with the Boland Amendment. 
For example, on December 10, 1986, before the 
House Intelligence Committee, responding to ques-
tions from Representative Dick Cheney, McFarlane 
testified that in the summer of 1985 he "went to 
considerable length to determine whether" North had 
violated the Boland Amendment. A document search, 
he said, "turned up two or three inches of paper, that 
reported on contacts that did occur between Colonel 
North and myself, indeed the President and Contra 
leaders." He continued: 
[F]rom the sum total of these documents, it was 
clear that the activities were to meet with Contra 
officials, civilian officials, tell them in so many 
words where we were, that we did not have 
Congressional support for military help, that we 
would try to get it, continue working with the 
Congress, that we couldn't provide it in the short 
term but we hoped that they would use the time 
until we could get it, to strengthen their political 
organization, bring in people like Cruz and others 
to develop a political program . . . but we 
couldn't do anything to help them194 
McFarlane also told the Tower Board that "neither 
the documentary record nor interviews with Colonel 
North showed any evidence" that North had provid-
ed military or fundraising support to the Contras.199 
As noted above, the documents about which McFar-
lane was concerned in August 1985 were not so in-
nocuous. 
Summer 1985: Inquiry of the 
Intelligence Oversight Board 
The flood of press allegations about possible NSC 
violations of the Boland Amendment prompted no 
investigations by executive branch law enforcement 
agencies. Only one small executive oversight organi-
zation, the Intelligence Oversight Board, responded to 
the widespread charges. In late August 1985, the 
Board conducted an inquiry into NSC staff activities. 
After a brief investigation by its counsel, Bretton G. 
Sciaroni, the Board concluded that Oliver North had 
not provided military or fundraising assistance to the 
Nicaraguan Resistance.19 6 
132 
Sciaroni began his inquiry with a 30 to 40 minute 
interview of Paul Thompson. Shortly before that 
interview, Thompson turned over to McFarlane the 
NSC file documents on North's activities. Those doc-
uments included the six "troubling" memorandums 
that indicated, as Thompson later put it, that "if he 
[North] was in effect doing what was reflected in the 
documents, he was perhaps not aware of the con-
straints of the . . . Boland Amendment."'" In his 
interview with Sciaroni, Thompson made no mention 
of North's activities as depicted in the memorandums. 
Indeed, he denied that North had provided "military 
support" to the Contras and asserted that North had 
limited himself to providing political encouragement 
and "moral support" while funds were unavailable.'" 
Although the Committees cannot be certain what 
Thompson knew directly of North's activities, it is 
clear that his denials cannot be squared with the 
memorandums he had given McFarlane. 
Furthermore, Thompson withheld from Sciaroni 
the six "troubling" memorandums included in the 
batch he gave McFarlane. During their meeting, 
Thompson provided Sciaroni an inch-thick pile of 
documents and told him he was producing "the rele-
vant documents for my review," according to Sciar-
oni. The only documents to which Sciaroni would not 
be permitted access, Thompson told him, were 
North's personal working files. Thompson also told 
Sciaroni that the pile of documents he was turning 
over were the same as those that had been "shown to 
the Hi11."199 Missing from the pile were many of the 
documents Thompson himself acknowledged raised 
questions about North's activities.2" 
Sciaroni's next investigative step was to talk with 
North. During a 5-minute discussion, North gave 
Sciaroni a "blanket denial" of charges that he was 
actively involved in aiding the Contras.2" Although 
North did not recall the conversation with Sciaroni, 
he was clear in his testimony that he had no intention 
of being candid with the Intelligence Oversight Board 
Counsel: "I am sure if he asked me" about supporting 
the Contras, "I denied it, because after all we viewed 
this to be a covert operation and he had absolutely no 
need to know the details of what I was doing.',202 
Still, Sciaroni stressed in his testimony that he was 
justified in expecting cooperation from NSC staff offi-
cers. Both Thompson and North, he said, "understood 
who I represented, the mandate of the Board to look 
into matters of legality, and the seriousness of the 
allegations that had been raised."2" His investigation 
was "an anomaly" in that he had no legal authority 
over the NSC staff, and therefore, Sciaroni said, he 
"was relying upon the good will of other officers at 
the White House.',204 Once again, however, North 
chose to conceal. This time, the object of his decep-
tion was a board established by and operating within 
the executive branch, an entity privy to intelligence 
information and programs of the highest sensitivity.

Chapter 6 
Summary 
While exercising its responsibility to oversee the im-
plementation of the law cutting off aid to the Nicara-
guan Resistance, Congress tried repeatedly through 
1984 and 1985 to learn how the Resistance was stay-
ing alive and whether the U.S. Government was in-
volved with the Contras' survival. The President, the 
Vice President, the National Security Adviser, and 
officials on the NSC staff were aware that a multimil-
lion dollar donation from Country 2, facilitated by 
McFarlane, was largely responsible for the Contras' 
survival. North, Poindexter, and perhaps other high 
Administration officials, were aware that the NSC 
staff was directly providing lethal support to the Nic-
araguan Resistance. McFarlane denied knowledge of 
North's activities, but documents he reviewed follow-
ing Congressional inquiries show that North actively 
assisted the Contras' military effort. 
Yet Congressional inquiries on U.S. support for the 
Contras were invariably met with categorical denials. 
So too were inquiries made by the media. In both 
cases, the information sought related not to sensitive 
operational details, but to a controversial foreign 
policy issue. The question repeatedly asked was 
whether it was the policy and practice of the U.S. 
Government during this period to provide lethal sup-
port to the rebels fighting in Nicaragua. It was to that 
question that Administration officials repeatedly re-
sponded with denials. 
The record leaves no doubt that some of the offi-
cials making these denials did so as part of a deliber-
ate attempt to deceive Congress and the public. 
North, who testified, "I didn't want to show Congress 
a single word on this whole thing," admitted that the 
letters sent to Congress over McFarlane's signature 
were "false." In meetings with Members of Congress, 
McFarlane repeated the statements in the letters. He 
acknowledged in testimony before these Committees 
that he had been "too categorical." Poindexter testi-
fied that his intent during this period was to "with-
hold information." And it is difficult to reconcile CIA 
Director Casey's testimony in this period with his 
knowledge of the facts as demonstrated by the docu-
mentary evidence, and with his pledge to the Senate 
Intelligence Committee that he would abide by a new 
spirit of cooperation. 
Other officials who denied the existence of U.S. 
support, including the State Department officials who 
testified before Congress in 1984 and 1985, and the 
press liaison of the NSC staff, were unaware of the 
truth, themselves victims of concealed information. 
As 1986 began, a new National Security Adviser 
was supervising the NSC staff, promoted from within. 
But the covert Contra operation continued, as did the 
overriding concern to keep the fact that the United 
States was providing lethal aid to the Contras secret 
from Congress and the American people.

Chapter 7 
Keeping "USG Fingerprints" Off the Contra 
Operation: 1986 
In 1986, the Contra support project finally achieved a 
degree of operational success. By mid-year, weapons 
and other material were being dropped to Resistance 
troops inside northern Nicaragua; by fall, similar air-
drops were being made in the South. Congress had 
appropriated funds for the humanitarian needs of the 
Contras, it had authorized third-country solicitation 
for humanitarian aid, and it had allowed the CIA to 
provide intelligence to the Resistance. But Congress 
had maintained the prohibition on lethal support. Fol-
lowing the pattern of 1984-1985, allegations in the 
media and independently obtained information 
prompted Congressional inquiries, which in turn were 
met with categorical denials by Administration offi-
cials, some of whom knew the statements to be mis-
leading and false. 
The expansion of the covert operation's activities in 
1986 also created new problems for officials still seek-
ing to maintain secrecy. In September, a new Costa 
Rican Government threatened to reveal the existence 
of the Santa Elena airfield, exposing the involvement 
of U.S. citizens and Government officials in providing 
support to the Contras. Administration officials mobi-
lized quickly to squelch the threatened press confer-
ence. Successful at first, the officials were unable to 
prevent disclosure by the Costa Rican Government 
three weeks later. Concerned that reporters might 
discover the link between the airfield and U.S. offi-
cials, North immediately took steps to ensure that no 
"USG fingerprints" would be found on Santa Elena.' 
In October, the Sandinistas shot down an Enter-
prise plane on a resupply mission (the Hasenfus 
flight). Administration officials, not all of whom knew 
the true facts, denied before Congress and to the 
media that the U.S. Government was involved in the 
Hasenfus flight. Even the President spoke out. With 
no protest from his National Security Adviser or 
others aware of the facts, the President told the 
American people: "[There is no government connec-
tion with that at all."2 
For most of 1986, efforts to determine whether the 
U.S. Government was providing lethal support to the 
*North's term, used in two PROF Notes to Poindexter dealing 
with the possible disclosure of the U.S. Government link to the 
Contra Operation. (Exhibits OLN-131 and OLN-307, Hearings, 100-
7, vol. 3.) 
Contras despite the legal restrictions were thwarted 
by the same techniques used in 1985. 
January to June 1986: Press 
Reports 
Through the first quarter of 1986, Congressional and 
media attention on the NSC staff's involvement with 
the Contras abated. In Washington, Congressional 
Committees had accepted the categorical denials the 
previous fall by the National Security Adviser. In 
Central America, the resupply project was not fully 
operational and Resistance activities slowed. A New 
York Times reporter in the region in January found 
the "Nicaraguan guerrillas . . . back in their camps;" 
in early March, the correspondent described the Re-
sistance as being "in its worst military condition since 
its formation in 1982."3 
By the end of March, the Contras' fortunes began 
to shift, and articles again appeared discussing the 
sources of Resistance funds and supplies.4 Some fo-
cused on charges that the Contras had received lethal 
support from American mercenaries and funds from 
drug trafficking; others explored how the Contras 
were spending the $27 million appropriated by Con-
gress in August, 1985, for humanitarian aid.3 By the 
end of April, North had reemerged as the focus of 
attention. The allegations in the new series of articles 
were almost always attributed to anonymous officials, 
and some of the details were incorrect. But the main 
charge?that U.S. Government officials had contin-
ued to provide lethal aid to the Contras despite the 
Boland Amendment?was accurate. The renewed re-
porting provided the context for a new round of 
Congressional inquiries that would begin at the end of 
June. 
Focus on North 
In an April 30, 1986, article headlined, "Colonel's 
Actions May Have Broken Contra Aid Ban," the 
Miami Herald provided what it called "the first 
glimpses at the inner workings of the well-oiled pri-
vate contra support machine that?with White House 
encouragement?developed after Congress suspended 
contra aid." The article asserted that Oliver North 
137

Chapter 7 
had arranged a meeting between a potential donor 
and a Contra fundraiser. It quoted "administration 
officials" as saying that "North acted repeatedly on 
behalf of the contras, especially in channelling poten-
tial donors to the rebels." John Singlaub and Robert 
Owen were cited in the article as two "conservatives 
closely associated with the contras" who had frequent 
meetings with North. In the article, lain administra-
tion official authorized to reply to queries" was 
quoted as saying that "Oliver North has not been 
involved in illegal activities."6 
On June 8, the Miami Herald ran on page one the 
headline, "Despite Ban, U.S. Helping Contras." Quot-
ing anonymous Administration and Resistance offi-
cials, the article reported that the Reagan Administra-
tion "continued secretly to assist anti-Sandinista rebels 
in finding weapons and plotting military strategy 
through a network of private operatives overseen by 
the National Security Council (NSC) and the CIA." 
According to the article, the system was supervised 
by North with "advice from" officers in the CIA 
Central American division. After enactment of the 
Boland Amendment, "private individuals were used as 
bridges between the administration and the rebels." 
The Administration "feels it has honored" Congres-
sional restrictions "by channeling its involvement 
through private citizens." This belief was attributed to 
"two administration officials and a knowledgeable 
rebel leader."7 
On June 22, the Miami Herald reported that the 
"controversial program to coordinate private aid to 
anti-Sandinista rebels through the National Security 
Council was approved by officials in the White 
House." This was attributed to "several current and 
former administration officials." The article went on 
to quote "one source," unidentified, as saying that 
McFarlane briefed Reagan on the proposal to aid the 
Contras and that the President verbally approved the 
plan. The Herald reported that McFarlane denied 
knowledge of any such plan to aid the Contras!' 
Concern for Secrecy 
As the Contra support operation expanded during 
1986, the task of maintaining secrecy became more 
challenging. National Security Adviser John Poin-
dexter, who admitted to the Committees, "I wanted 
to withhold information on the NSC operational ac-
tivities in support of the Contras from most every-
body," did what he could to conceal the NSC con-
nection. 
North oversaw two of the most important NSC 
"accounts," but Poindexter kept North's title artifi-
cially low because "we wanted to provide a signifi-
cant amount of cover for Colonel North and his ac-
tivities."" According to Poindexter, North's respon-
sibilities warranted the title Special Assistant to the 
President, the third-level rank in the White House. 
Instead, he kept North as Deputy Director of Politi-
138 
cal Military Affairs." "We didn't want to call public 
attention to Colonel North," Poindexter testified." 
In July, shortly after the renewal of Congressional 
inquiries, Poindexter tried further to downplay 
North's responsibilities. He apparently leaked to the 
Washington Times the story that North's position at 
the NSC staff was "precarious" and that "NSC soft 
liners" were maneuvering "to edge him out."" In a 
PROF Note sent the day the article appeared, Poin-
dexter reassured North about his intentions: "I do not 
want you to leave and to be honest cannot afford to 
let you go."14 He told North to call two reporters at 
the Washington Times and "tell them to call off the 
dogs." Poindexter wrote: "Tell them on deep back-
ground, off the record, not be published, that I just 
wanted to lower your visibility so you wouldn't be 
such a good target for the Libs [Liberals]."" 
Poindexter directed North not to put "things in 
writing about his operational activities, especially 
with regard to the support for the Contras."" North 
had stopped writing "logged" memorandums?docu-
ments stored in the official NSC files?after Repre-
sentative Barnes had sought access to such documents 
in the summer of 1985. North testified: "[W]e had . . . 
decided to take those kinds of documents out of the 
system altogether . . . so that outside knowledge 
would not necessarily be derived from having seen 
them."" Subsequent to the 1985 Congressional in-
quiries, written communications about the Contra op-
eration between North and his superiors were done 
exclusively using "non-logged" memorandums and 
the PROF system. North had assumed that PROF 
notes, after their use, were erased from computer 
memory and irretrievable.'8 
Poindexter arranged for North to communicate 
with him directly, thereby preventing other NSC staff 
members from learning details of the Contra oper-
ation. Ordinarily, PROF messages to the National Se-
curity Adviser were channeled through other staff 
members. On August 31, 1985, two weeks after he 
had assigned North to draft the response to Repre-
sentative Barnes, Poindexter sent North a message 
with the subject heading "Private Blank Check."" 
When North wanted to communicate with Poindexter 
directly, he sent a message in reply to the "Private 
Blank Check" note. Poindexter testified: "Otherwise 
. . . those messages were intercepted by the [NSC 
staff] Executive Secretary.'t20 
Poindexter also stressed to North the need to avoid 
speaking of his secret operational activities with 
anyone, including other Administration officials. In 
May 1986, Poindexter learned that North had dis-
cussed his plan to offer the Erria to the CIA for use 
in a covert activity with Ken deGraffenreid, Senior 
Director of Intelligence Programs at the NSC, the 
officer who maintained NSC documents of the high-
est sensitivity. The Erria was a ship under North's 
control, purchased by the Enterprise for use in van-

Chapter 7 
ous covert operations. In a PROF he titled "Be Cau-
tious," Poindexter directed North to maintain absolute 
silence about his activities: 
I am afraid you are letting your operational role 
become too public. From now on I don't want 
you to talk to anybody else, including [CIA Di-
rector] Casey, except me about any of your oper-
ational roles. In fact you need to quietly generate 
a cover story that I have insisted that you stop.2' 
Poindexter testified that he was particularly con-
cerned about keeping Casey ignorant of the operation 
because the CIA Director could be called to testify 
before Congressional Committees.22 
Poindexter also kept the existence of the covert 
operation hidden from officials who did not ordinarily 
testify before Congress, such as former Chief of Staff 
Donald Regan. Poindexter explained: "Based on my 
feeling that if we were going to keep this up and 
avoid more restrictive legislation, that we simply had 
to limit the knowledge of the details to those that had 
absolutely the need to know. I simply didn't think 
that he [Regan] had an absolute need to know."23 In 
addition, Poindexter testified that he felt Regan 
"talked to the press too much. I was afraid he'd make 
a slip."24 Despite Poindexter's directive, North kept 
the CIA Director apprised of everything, according 
to his testimony. But North shared Poindexter's desire 
to conceal U.S. Government coordination of Contra 
support activities from Congress and the American 
public. He told these Committees: "I didn't want to 
show Congress a single word on this whole thing."25 
In May, as Robert Dutton was brought in and the 
project became operational, North became concerned 
that the likelihood of disclosure was increasing. He 
described in a PROF to Poindexter "the urgent need 
to get the CIA back into the management of this 
program." He explained: 
The more money there is (and we will have a 
considerable amount in a few more days) the 
more visible the program becomes (airplanes, 
pilots, weapons, deliveries, etc.) and the more 
inquisitive will become people like Kerry, 
Barnes, Harkins, [sic] et al. While I care not a 
whit what they say about me, it could well 
become a political embarrassment for the Presi-
dent and you. Some of this can be avoided 
simply by covering it with an authorized CIA 
program undertaken with the $15M.26 
The next month, as airdrops became more frequent, 
North tried to ensure that resupply activities in Cen-
tral America could not be traced back to him or other 
U.S. officials. On June 16, he informed Tomas Cas-
tillo, a CIA Station Chief in Central America, that he 
had sent Rafael Quintero to Central America to facili-
tate a supply drop to the FDN. "I do not think we 
ought to contemplate these operations without him 
being on the scene," North wrote via KL-43. "Too 
many things go wrong that then directly involve you 
and me in what should be deniable for both of us."27 
Shortly after this message to Castillo, Karna Small, 
the press liaison for the NSC staff, asked North to 
comment on allegations that would be broadcast in a 
CBS News program, "West 57th Street." Small sent a 
note to North saying she had declined the show's 
request to speak with North, but that since it would 
include interviews with people making charges about 
North, she should call back with a comment. She 
remarked, "I can't just give them the 'bullshit' re-
sponse."28 
The segment aired on June 25. It charged that "the 
White House secretly directed a private aid network 
to arm the Contras when it was illegal for the White 
House to do that." The show focused on John Hull, 
suggesting that he played an important role in helping 
the Contras from his ranch in Costa Rica. It also 
alleged that Robert Owen acted as "the NSC repre-
sentative" to the Contras and their supporters in 
Costa Rica. Describing Owen as "the bag man for 
011ie North," the report charged that he carried 
$10,000 a month from the NSC to John Hull for use 
in purchasing lethal and nonlethal supplies for the 
Nicaraguan Resistance. The segment also reported: 
"The White House today quoted Colonel Oliver 
North as calling the private aid network 'nonsense.' 
The White House also said, quote, 'The President 
never approved any such plan' [to aid the Con-
tras]".29 
Two days after the show aired, North sent a PROF 
to Karna Small: 
I have just had a chance to watch the W57th 
piece. As far as I am concerned, it is the single 
most distorted piece of 'reporting' I have ever 
seen. . . . The only charges made about the NSC 
are made by people who are in jail, on their way 
to jail or just out of jail. If this is supposed to be 
credible, then I'll eat my shirt.3? 
North acknowledged in the PROF that he knew 
Robert Owen, but denied the inaccurate charge that 
Owen was "paid off" $50,000. North did not com-
ment on the charge, the substance of which was accu-
rate, that Owen delivered to Central America money 
provided by North. Nor did he comment on the gen-
eral allegation that he was aiding the Contras. 
June 1986: New Congressional 
Inquiry 
On June 4, Representative Ron Coleman of Texas 
introduced a Resolution of Inquiry (H. Res. 485), 
directing the President to provide documents and in-
formation about support for the Contras. In a public 
statement, the Resolution's author explained the need

Chapter 7 
"to get at the truth" behind the widely publicized 
allegations: "[D]isturbing new reports that our own 
government officials may have deliberately violated 
the law that prohibited any open or hidden U.S. as-
sistance for military operations inside Nicaragua [sug-
gest that there] may have been an intentional disre-
gard for our own democratic process."31 
In a statement inserted into the Congressional 
Record, the author of the Resolution explained the 
information sought from the Administration: 
My resolution of inquiry seeks answers and infor-
mation on two central questions. Did Lieutenant 
Colonel North develop and implement a plan for 
Contra funding in the event that Congress did 
adopt the Boland Amendment? . . . Second, what 
was the degree of Lieutenant Colonel North's 
involvement with the Contra high command 
before, during, and after the Boland Amendment 
became the law of this land. Did he assure the 
Contra generals that the administration would 
find a way to ensure continued funding and as-
sistance even in the event of a congressional ban? 
Did he, as alleged, provide regular tactical and 
logistical assistance to the Contra high command 
on a regular basis? Did Lieutenant Colonel North 
then implement a sham network of intermediaries 
to filter his continued advice to the Contra gener-
als in direct violation of at least the spirit of the 
Boland language? 3 2 
Representative Coleman said he introduced his Reso-
lution "very reluctantly," adding: "No one can be 
allowed to operate above the law of this great coun-
try?least of all those officials obligated to defend our 
Constitution." He concluded by stating that the Reso-
lution "touches upon areas of concern that go far 
beyond the question of one's position relative to 
Contra aid. Rather, this course of action goes to ac-
countability and ensuring that one branch of our Gov-
ernment [does not] disregard . . . the other two."33 
The Resolution of Inquiry directed the President to 
provide to the House information and documents in 
three areas: 
1. Funds and Supplies: Information and documents 
on contacts between any NSC staff member and pri-
vate individuals or representatives of foreign govern-
ments relating to the provision of funds and supplies 
to the Contras.34 
2. Military Activities: Information and documents 
on contacts between any NSC staff member and any 
member of the Nicaraguan Resistance relating to 
Contra military activities.35 
3. Singlaub, Owen & Hull: Information and docu-
ments on contacts between any NSC staff member 
and Robert W. Owen, Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, 
and John Hull." 
The Resolution was referred to the House Commit-
tees on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Armed Serv-
140 
ices. On June 25 and July 1, the Chairmen of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence Com-
mittee requested comments from the President on the 
Resolution. 
The Executive's Response 
On July 21, Poindexter wrote the Chairmen of the 
three Committees "in reply to your letter to the Presi-
dent."37 Poindexter testified that he "probably" did 
not show the letter to the President, but discussed the 
issue with him "in general terms . . . . I probably told 
him about the Resolution of inquiry and told him that 
we were opposed to it. He agreed."38 
In the one-page letter, Poindexter first stated the 
Administration's opposition to the resolution of in-
quiry. He continued: 
Last fall, in an effort to cooperate with Chairman 
Barnes, my predecessor, Robert C. McFarlane, 
met with members of your committee and the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. While I did 
not participate in these discussions, I understand 
that information on the specific issues raised in H. 
Res. 485, was provided to your Committee and 
that this information made it clear that the ac-
tions of the National Security Council staff were 
in compliance with both the spirit and letter of 
the law regarding support of the Nicaraguan re-
sistance. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on H. 
Res. 485. I have forwarded similar letters to 
Chairman Fascell and Chairman Aspin and sin-
cerely hope that this matter can finally be put to 
rest.3 9 
Insisting that the letter was technically accurate, 
Poindexter acknowledged to the Select Committees 
that the letter "clearly withholds information."40 
By any standard the response was misleading. First, 
the National Security Adviser implied in the letter 
that he accepted the view that the Boland Amend-
ment applied to the NSC staff, and that the NSC staff 
under his tenure was not providing covert lethal sup-
port to the Contras. Poindexter referred explicitly to 
the information McFarlane had provided Congress 
that "made it clear that the actions of the National 
Security Council staff were in compliance with both 
the spirit and the letter" of the Boland Amendment. 
He did not disclose that he had authorized North to 
provide to the Contras precisely the kind of covert 
aid the Boland Amendment was intended to prohibit 
or that, as he put it, "We had been running this 
[Contra] operation on our own for a long period of 
time." 4 1 
Asked how he could reconcile the statement that 
the NSC staff was complying with the "letter and 
spirit" of the Boland Amendment with the actions

Chapter 7 
North had taken and that he had approved, Poin-
dexter testified: 
I felt that the Boland Amendment did not apply 
to the NSC staff and I felt that indeed we were 
complying with the letter and spirit of the 
Boland Amendment. Now, it doesn't say that we 
are not helping the Contras. We were.42 
In addition, Poindexter's letter implied that he had 
no dispute in 1985 with the categorical denials 
McFarlane gave Congress on allegations about 
North's activities. In fact, however, Poindexter was 
aware that North had taken over coordination of 
Contra-support activities after enactment of the 
Boland Amendment." Moreoever, when the Barnes 
letter arrived at the NSC on August 17, 1985, it was 
Deputy National Security Adviser Poindexter who 
assigned North to draft the response, intending that 
North would conceal his true activities from Con-
gress.44 As Poindexter himself put it before these 
Committees, he intended with his letter to say "that 
the questions had been addressed by Mr. McFarlane 
in the previous year." 45 But McFarlane's denials had 
misled Congress the previous year, as Poindexter's 
letter misled Congress in 1986. 
August 1986: North's Meeting with 
Members of Congress 
In response to the Resolution of Inquiry, the House 
Intelligence Committee sought to meet with North.46 
On August 6, North met with 11 members of the 
House Intelligence Committee in the White House 
Situation Room.47 North began the session with a 
presentation about his activities. The description 
echoed closely McFarlane's letters the year before to 
Representatives Hamilton and Barnes: North's princi-
pal mission was to coordinate contacts with the Con-
tras; a main purpose of his job was to assess the 
viability of the Nicaraguan Resistance as a democratic 
organization; and he explained to Contra leaders the 
limitations on U.S. support as imposed by the Boland 
Amendment. According to a memorandum based on 
notes taken at the meeting, North said "that he did 
not in any way, nor at any time violate the spirit, 
principles or legal requirements of the Boland 
Amendment."48 
In response to specific questions, North denied that 
he had raised funds for the Contras or offered them 
military advice. North told the Members that his rela-
tionship with Robert Owen was "casual," that Owen 
never took guidance from him. He stated that he had 
not been in contact with John Singlaub at all in 1985 
or 1986." 
By his own testimony, North lied to the Members 
of the Intelligence Committee at this meeting: 
A: . . . I will tell you right now, counsel, and all 
the Members here gathered, that I misled the 
Congress. I misled?
Q: At that meeting? 
A: At that meeting. 
Q: Face to face? 
A: Face to face. 
Q: You made false statements to them about your 
activities in support of the Contras? 
A: I did." 
At the conclusion of the meeting, according to an 
observer, Representative Hamilton "expressed his ap-
preciation for the good-faith effort that Admiral Poin-
dexter had shown in arranging a meeting and indicat-
ed his satisfaction in the responses received."' On 
August 12, Hamilton wrote Representative Coleman 
that the House Intelligence Committee would not 
move forward with the Resolution: "Based on our 
discussions and review of the evidence provided, it is 
my belief that the published press allegations cannot 
be proven." 2 
Authority to Lie 
North conceded in his testimony that Poindexter 
did not give him specific prior authority to make false 
statements." Before meeting with the Members of 
the House Intelligence Committee, North expressed to 
his aide Robert Earl "concern . . . [about] what he 
was authorized to say" at the session." According to 
Earl, North tried to obtain guidance from Poindexter 
but could not reach him." Poindexter "was on leave, 
yes, out of the office" during this period, according to 
Earl, who testified: "My impression was that the 
leave was not accidental. The timing of the leave was 
just not a coincidence."6 In his testimony, Earl char-
acterized his observation as follows: 
Q: So that your impression of it, your observa-
tion of it, was that Colonel North had some in-
formation to protect and that he was being left to 
figure out how to protect it on his own? 
A: I think that's a fair statement." 
North and Poindexter differ on whether North had 
general authority from the National Security Adviser 
to lie at the session. North testified that he was acting 
under such authority: "I went down to that oral meet-
ing with the same kind of understanding that I had 
prepared those memos in 1985 and other communica-
tions."" North added: "[Poindexter] did not specifi-
cally go down and say, '011ie, lie to the Committee.' I 
told him what I had said afterwards, and he sent me a 
note saying, "Well done." 59

Chapter 7 
While Poindexter did send such a note, he claimed 
it did not indicate approval of North's lies. Poindexter 
acknowledged that North and he had a "general un-
derstanding that he [North] was to withhold informa-
tion about our involvement." But Poindexter told 
these Committees that he did not know North had 
lied at his meeting with the Intelligence Committee, 
and that he had not expected North would do so.6? 
The evidence is clear, however, that Poindexter 
knew North had misled the Members of Congress. 
Poindexter attached his "well done" message to a 
PROF Note summarizing the meeting. The summary 
was written by Bob Pearson, one of two NSC staffers 
besides North who had attended the August 8 meet-
ing in the Situation Room, and sent to Poindexter 
who forwarded the PROF note to North. The mes-
sage began by declaring, "Session was success," and 
went on to describe North's presentation as "thor-
ough and convincing." Pearson wrote: 
In response to specific questions, 011ie covered 
the following points: 
?contact with FDN and UNO aimed to foster 
viable, democratic political strategy for Nicara-
guan opposition, gave no military advice, knew 
of no specific military operations. 
?Singlaub--gave no advice, has had no contact 
in 20 months: Owen?never worked from OLN 
office, OLN had casual contact, never provided 
Owen guidance.6' 
Poindexter testified that "by reading the summary 
in this note, I didn't attach any great significance to it 
because I knew that the questions and answers would 
be very carefully crafted."62 Yet Pearson's PROF is 
clear that North told the Members he "gave no mili-
tary advice" to the Resistance, that he had only 
"casual" contact with Owen and never "provided . . . 
guidance," and that he had "no contact" with Sing-
laub for 20 months. 
Thus, even if Poindexter did not expressly author-
ize North to lie, he was aware of North's misleading 
statements and made no effort to correct them. Nor 
did he reprimand North. On the contrary, Poindexter 
congratulated North on his performance and on his 
success at deflecting the inquiry. 
In his testimony, Poindexter acknowledged that he 
did not expect North to disclose the truth: 
I did think that he would withhold information 
and be evasive, frankly, in answering questions. 
My objective all along was to withhold from the 
Congress exactly what the NSC staff was doing 
in carrying out the President's policy . . . . I 
thought that Colonel North would withhold in-
formation. There was no doubt about that in my 
mind.6 3 
142 
September 1986: The Santa Elena 
Airfield 
Soon after North had turned aside the Congressional 
inquiry, he learned of a new threat of exposure, this 
one involving the Santa Elena airfield in Costa Rica. 
It came just as Congress was taking steps to fund the 
Contras again. 
The airfield at Santa Elena had been built with the 
covert assistance of several U.S. Government offi-
cials, including North, Tambs, and Castillo. Complet-
ed in early 1986, the airfield was originally intended 
to serve as an abort base and refueling site for resup-
ply aircraft, but never became a crucial element in the 
operation. The new Costa Rican Government that 
took office in May 1986, requested that the field not 
be used to aid the Contras. Ambassador Tambs 
agreed, and the operation relied on alternative means 
to drop supplies to Resistance troops inside Nicara-
gua.6 4 
North learned late Friday, September 5, that the 
Costa Rican Government planned a press conference 
about the airfield the next morning. Officials at the 
press conference, North was told, would reveal that 
Santa Elena had been used as part of an operation to 
resupply the Contras and that U.S. Government offi-
cials were involved with the airfield. In response, 
North mobilized several government officials to pres-
sure high Costa Rican officials to call off the press 
conference. 
North told a good deal of the story in a PROF sent 
the next day to Poindexter: "Last night at 2330 our 
Project Democracy rep. in Costa Rica called to 
advise" that the Arias Government would hold a 
press conference the next morning "announcing that 
an illegal support operation for the Contras had been 
taking place from an airfield in Costa Rica for over a 
year."65 North wrote that Secord and CIA Station 
Chief Tomas Castillo would be "predominantly men-
tioned." From North's notebook it appears that he too 
was in danger of being mentioned at the press confer-
ence. The first entry relating to the incident reads: 
"0005?call from [Castillo]?Security Minister plans 
to make public Udall role w/ Base West [Santa Elena 
airfield] and allege violation of C[osta] R[ican] law by 
Udall, Bacon, North, Secord, et al."66 
North immediately arranged a conference call with 
Elliott Abrams and Louis Tambs. North claimed in 
his PROF note to Poindexter that the three officials 
agreed that North would call President Arias and 
make two threats: if the press conference proceeded 
as scheduled Arias would not be permitted to meet 
with President Reagan and he "w[ould] never see a 
nickel of the $80M that [Agency for International 
Development Director M. Peter] McPherson had 
promised him" the day before.67 North's notebook 
also reflected his intention to threaten a foreign gov-

Chapter 7 
ernment if necessary to maintain secrecy. The entry 
reads: 
0008 - Conf. . . . Call to Elliott Abrams and Amb 
Lew Tambs 
- Tell Arias: 
- Never set foot in W.H. 
- Never get 5 [cents] of $80M promised by 
McPherson.8 8 
According to North's PROF Note to Poindexter, 
Abrams and another Government official passed "the 
same word" to President Arias." However, accord-
ing to their testimony, neither North, Abrams, nor the 
other official called Arias.70 North testified that he 
falsified the facts in his PROF note to "protect" the 
other officials involved." He did not offer any expla-
nation why he felt it necesary to hide the facts from 
Poindexter, who knew details of the resupply oper-
ation, including the existence of the airfield. 
Ambassador Tambs did call President Arias. The 
purpose, he testified, was to "dissuade him from this 
press conference."72 Abrams recalled instructing 
Tambs before the call to President Arias that revela-
tion of the airfield would put at risk Arias' upcoming 
meeting with President Reagan." Tambs testified that 
he merely told President Arias that it would not be 
prudent to hold the planned press conference in light 
of the pending case before the International Court of 
Justice. 7 4 
In his PROF note, North assured Poindexter that 
steps had been taken to ensure that the NSC-coordi-
nated Contra operation would not be linked to the 
airfield: "As a precaution the Project a/c [aircraft] 
were flown to [another base] last night and no project 
personnel remain on site at the field."78 The next day, 
Poindexter indicated his approval of North's actions. 
He wrote in a PROF: "Thanks, 011ie. You did the 
right thing, but let's try to keep it quiet."78 
Airfield Revealed: Damage Control 
Although the initial news conference was cancelled, 
the Costa Rican Government announced the existence 
of the airfield three weeks later. On September 26, the 
Costa Rican Interior Minister told reporters that his 
government had discovered and shut down an airfield 
that had been used for resupplying the Contras, for 
trafficking drugs, or both. Secord and North were not 
mentioned, although the name of the Enterprise Pana-
manian company that built the airfield, Udall Re-
sources, Inc., was revealed, as was the pseudonym 
(Robert Olmstead) of William Haskell, the man who 
purchased the land.7 7 
The airfield had not been used in the resupply oper-
ation for several months, and the press conference 
had compromised its location and purpose. Nonethe-
less, action was taken to ensure that the roles of U.S. 
officials and the Enterprise remained concealed. In a 
PROF note, North told Poindexter: "There are no 
USG fingerprints on any of the operation." Udall 
Resources, which North described as "a proprietary 
of Project Democracy," will "cease to exist by noon 
today." The company's resources?$48,000?were 
moved to another Panamanian account. And Udall's 
office in Panama "is now gone as are all files and 
paperwork." Olmstead, North added, "is not the name 
of the agent?Olmstead does not exist."78 
In a second PROF note to Poindexter written that 
day, North blamed the failure to head off the press 
conference in part on the absence of Ambassador 
Tambs, who was on leave. North wrote that Tambs 
"put this thing back in its box two weeks ago when I 
called you in the middle of the night to threaten that 
Arias would not get in the door of the oval office if 
this came out."78 North's PROF continued with a 
lengthy slur directed against Costa Rican officials 
who exposed activities in their own country. 
North concluded the message: 
Believe we have taken all appropriate damage 
control measures to keep any USG fingerprints 
off this and with Elliott and [CIA Chief Castillo], 
have worked up appropriate "if asked" press 
guidance.8? 
The press guidance went to Poindexter for approv-
al on September 30.8' The guidance, which according 
to the cover memo had been coordinated with Elliott 
Abrams, the CIA Chief of the Central American Task 
Force (C/CATF) and Richard Armitage, Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for International Security Af-
fairs, consisted of answers to two likely questions. 
The first potential question and suggested answer 
were: 
[Question] Did U.S. personnel supervise con-
struction of the airstrip in Northern Costa Rica? 
[Answer:] The U.S. Embassy in San Jose, Costa 
Rica, has reported that during the Administration 
of Former President Monge the Ministry of 
Public Security was offered the use of a site on 
the Santa Elena Peninsula which could be used as 
an extension of the civil guard training center at 
Murcielago. The site included a serviceable air-
strip which could have supplemented the small 
one which is located near the training center. 
The offer was reportedly made by the owners of 
the property who had apparently decided to 
abandon plans for a tourism project. The Embas-
sy has no information on the Ministry's decision 
concerning the offer.82 
The answer concluded: "No U.S. Government funds 
were allocated or used in connection with this site 
nor were any U.S. Government personnel involved in 
its construction."83 The press guidance thus con-
143

Chapter 7 
cealed the involvement in the airfield's construction 
of North, Tambs, and Castillo. 
The suggested answer in the press guidance to the 
second possible question was also misleading: 
[Question:] Was the airstrip intended for use by 
the Contras? 
[Answer:] The Government of Costa Rica has 
made clear its position that it will not permit the 
use of its territory for military action against 
neighboring states. The U.S. Government re-
spects that position. 
In fact, the airfield had been used to help the Con-
tras. The Costa Rican Government had already re-
vealed that the airfield's purpose had been to help the 
Contras, to traffic drugs, or both. Among the officials 
who had helped prepare the guidance, Abrams and 
CIA Central American Task Force Chief acknowl-
edged knowing that the airfield was intended to help 
the Contras and that U.S. citizens?if not Govern-
ment officials?were involved.84 North and Poin-
dexter, to whom the press guidance was sent for 
approval, knew the airfield was part of the covert 
operation to help the Resistance." 
The steps taken to keep reporters from finding 
"USG fingerprints" on the airfield were successful for 
the time being. Not until October 24 did evidence 
emerge suggesting ties between the airfield and the 
U.S. Government. That revelation would come from 
Eugene Hasenfus after he was shot down and cap-
tured by the Sandinistas." 
The Hasenfus Downing 
On the morning of October 5, 1986, one of the air-
craft belonging to the Enterprise left its operational 
base with 10,000 pounds of ammunition and gear for 
FDN forces inside northern Nicaragua. William 
Cooper was in command, Wallace "Buzz" Sawyer 
was the co-pilot, and a 17-year-old FDN fighter was 
handling radio communication with the troops on the 
ground. Also on board, as the "kicker" who would 
actually drop the supplies to forces waiting below, 
was Eugene Hasenfus. 
Within a few hours, the aircraft was reported miss-
ing. Officials later learned that the plane had been hit 
by a Sandinista SAM-7 missile over Nicaraguan terri-
tory. Three crew members were killed. Hasenfus sur-
vived and was captured by the Sandinistas. 
The Sandinistas found in the wreckage, and showed 
reporters, an identification card issued to Hasenfus by 
the air force in the operational base's host country 
identifying him as an "adviser" in the "Grupo 
U.S.A." group at the base, and a business card be-
longing to an official at the NHAO office in Washing-
ton. They also found and displayed an ID card issued 
to Cooper by Southern Air Transport.87 
144 
The U.S. Government Connection 
The Hasenfus flight was part of the resupply oper-
ation coordinated by North with the support and ap-
proval of the President's National Security Adviser. 
North acknowledged in testimony about the flight: "I 
was the U.S. Government connection."" James 
Steele, a U.S. Military Group Commander in Central 
America; Lewis Tambs, the U.S. Ambassador to 
Costa Rica; and Tomas Castillo, a CIA Station Chief 
in Central America, all provided assistance to the 
secret operation to support the Contras. Yet, virtually 
every newspaper article on the incident in the days 
after the downing would quote senior Government 
officials, including the President himself, denying any 
U.S. Government connection with the flight. And 
within a week, high Government officials would offer 
the same categorical denials before Congressional 
Committees. 
The Initial Response 
When the Sandinistas shot down the Hasenfus 
plane, North was in West Germany negotiating with 
the Second Channel. He returned to Washington 
within 48 hours of the downing to help deflect inquir-
ies about the flight, leaving Albert Hakim behind to 
complete his negotiations. 
Castillo, however, recognized immediately that the 
Hasenfus crash could lead to disclosure of the oper-
ation. Before the downing was even confirmed, he 
wrote to Robert Dutton via KL-43: 
Situation requires we do necessary damage con-
trol. Did this A/C [aircraft] have tail number? If 
so, is it the same one which refueled several 
times at . . . Please advise ASAP. If so, we will 
have to try to cover quickly as record of tail 
number could lead to very serious implication." 
Two days later, plans were made at a Restricted 
Interagency Group (RIG) meeting in which Abrams 
and CIA Central American Task Force Chief (Cl 
CATF) participated to ensure that the U.S. Govern-
ment would not be implicated by the flight." A 
PROF from NSC staff member Vincent Cannistraro 
to Adm. Poindexter described decisions made at the 
meeting. Among them, Cannistraro wrote, "UNO to 
be asked to assume responsibility for flights and to 
assist families of Americans involved." Also, the 
group decided that press guidance would be prepared 
"which states no U.S.G. involvement or connection, 
but that we are generally aware of such support con-
tracted by the Contras."91 
A few days later The New York Times reported: 
"Nicaraguan rebels took full responsibility today for 
the flight of a military cargo plane that was downed 
over Nicaragua last week." A "senior Administration 
official" was quoted in the story as saying that the 
U.S. Government had asked the rebels to take respon-

Chapter 7 
sibility. While denying that any such request was 
made, Bosco Matamoros, UNO's Washington-based 
spokesman, told the reporter, "There was no United 
States government connection."92 Similar denials by 
Administration officials would soon follow. North 
was not at the RIG meeting, but he testified that the 
guidance stating no U.S. Government connection was 
"not inconsistent with what we had prepared as the 
press line if such, if such an eventuality occurred."93 
The Denials 
The President: There is no evidence the President 
knew of U.S. involvement in the Hasenfus flight. But 
the National Security Adviser and officials on the 
NSC staff did know. Also, the day of the downing, 
Felix Rodriguez called Col. Sam Watson in Vice 
President Bush's office, suggesting to him that North 
was involved with the flight." Donald Gregg, Assist-
ant to Vice President Bush, earlier had been alerted to 
the possibility that North was linked to the resupply 
operation. 
Nevertheless, the President was permitted to deny 
any U.S. Government connection with the flight. In 
an exchange with reporters on October 8, the Presi-
dent praised the efforts to keep the Contras armed, 
comparing resupply efforts to those of the "Abraham 
Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War." But when 
asked whether the Hasenfus plane had any connection 
with the American Government, the President re-
plied, "Absolutely none." He told reporters: 
There is no government connection with that at 
all . . . We've been aware that there are private 
groups and private citizens that have been trying 
to help the Contras?to that extent?but we did 
not know the exact particulars of what they're 
doing.95 
The Secretary of State: On October 7, Secretary 
Shultz told reporters that the Hasenfus aircraft was 
"hired by private people" who "had no connection 
with the U.S. Government at all."" He was quoted 
on two national network news programs that evening 
as saying, "The people involved were not from our 
military, not from any U.S. Government agency, CIA 
included."97 On October 10, Shultz reiterated this 
denial while at the Reykjavik Summit with the Presi-
dent. Asked during a Today Show interview about 
Hasenfus' statements that he worked with CIA em-
ployees on the resupply operation, Shultz said: 
[D]on't forget that this man is under arrest and is 
saying things under those conditions. I have said, 
on the basis of checking with both the Defense 
Department and the CIA, that I am informed by 
both those agencies that he is not an employee of 
theirs and they are not connected with this oper-
ation.98 
Secretary Shultz testified that the U.S. Government 
involvement with the Hasenfus flight was a "surprise" 
to him," and the record shows that two National 
Security Advisers frequently failed to confide in him 
or give him accurate information. Shultz said he 
based his denials on a "general understanding" that 
"there was no problem" with North's activities, be-
cause Congressional inquiries into North's activities 
came up empty. Moreover, Abrams testified that he 
gave categorical assurances to Shultz that there was 
no U.S. Government involvement in the Hasenfus 
flight, and that neither North nor anybody else on the 
NSC staff was involved in the provision of lethal 
assistance to the Contras.1?? 
North claimed in testimony that Shultz "knew what 
I was doing" to support the Contras, citing a single 
instance where the Secretary at a reception "put his 
arm around my shoulder, and told me what a remark-
able job I had done keeping the Nicaraguan Resist-
ance alive."0' Shultz testified, however, that he 
merely told North that he appreciated North's work 
"to keep up the morale of these [the Contra] leaders. 
. . . But that was the sum and substance of it. To 
build on that remark this superstructure of implication 
is entirely unwarranted.',102 
Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Af-
fairs: Elliott Abrams was the primary spokesman for 
the Administration about the Hasenfus flight. His cat-
egorical denials of U.S. involvement were not limited 
to the State Department; he did not hesitate to tell 
reporters that no Government agency was tied to the 
Hasenfus flight, including the NSC staff. Typical of 
his statements during this period were the following, 
made on the CNN Evans & Novak show which aired 
October 11: 
EVANS: "Mr. Secretary, can you give me cate-
gorical assurance that Hasenfus was not under 
the control, the guidance, the direction, or what 
have you, of anybody connected with the Ameri-
can government?" 
ABRAMS: "Absolutely. That would be illegal. 
We are barred from doing that, and we are not 
doing it. This was not in any sense a U.S. gov-
ernment operation. 
NOVAK: "Now, when you say gave categorical 
assurance, we're not playing word games that are 
so common in Washington. You're not talking 
about the NCS [sic], or something else?" 
ABRAMS: "I am not playing games." 
NOVAK: "National Security Council?" 
ABRAMS: "No government agencies, none. 
"104 
Abrams was no less categorical in denials to Con-
gressional Committees. He testified three times during 
this period. On October 15, Abrams testified alone

Chapter 7 
before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Western Hemisphere Affairs. On October 10, he testi-
fied before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
and on October 14, before the House Intelligence 
Committee. On these two occasions, he was accompa-
nied by Clair George, the CIA's Deputy Director for 
Operations; and the Chief of the CIA's Central Amer-
ican Task Force. 
During the House Intelligence Committee appear-
ance, the following exchange occurred: 
HAMILTON: ". . . Just to be clear, the United 
States Government has not done anything to fa-
cilitate the activities of these private groups, is 
that a fair statement? We have not furnished 
money. We have not furnished arms. We have 
not furnished advice. We have not furnished lo-
gistics." 
GEORGE: "Mr. Chairman, I cannot speak for 
the entire United States Government." 
HAMILTON: "Can you, Mr. Abrams?" 
ABRAMS: "Yes, to the extent of my knowledge 
that I feel to be complete, other than the general 
public encouragement that we like this kind of 
activity."105 
As Abrams later acknowledged to these Commit-
tees, this statement was "completely wrong.',106 
Abrams testified that he was unaware that North was 
involved with the Hasenfus flight, insisting that he 
was just another person deceived by North.'" 
North, on the other hand, included Abrams with 
other officials who, he said, had tried to keep the 
Contra operation secret. He testified: "I am sure that 
others like Mr. McFarlane and Admiral Poindexter 
and Director Casey and Elliott Abrams and the Chief 
of the Central American Task Force and others were 
trying to weigh in their souls what would happen to 
those [involved in or assisting the operation] . . . if the 
American Government stood up and announced 
it."?8 Noting that Abrams had asked North to help 
raise money to retrieve the bodies of the dead crew-
members, North said, "Why would he turn to me if 
he didn't know I was doing it?"" 
Abrams testified that he did not specifically call 
North to ask for such assistance, but that those issues 
merely "came up in the conversation.""? Moreover, 
Abrams maintained he had sufficient reason to believe 
North was not involved in the Hasenfus flight. He 
noted first that McFarlane had categorically denied to 
Congress that North was providing military support 
to the Contras. Abrams conceded that those denials 
were made a full year before the Hasenfus shoot-
down, but said that based on his work with North in 
the Restricted Interagency Group (RIG) throughout 
1986, he "had no reason whatsoever to believe that he 
was violating the law."111 
146 
North claimed, however, that his Contra-related ac-
tivities were discussed at some RIG meetings.' 12 In 
his testimony, North specifically mentioned only one 
RIG meeting, initially asserting that Abrams attend-
ed.1 North's notebook entry of that meeting, how-
ever, indicates Abrams was not present. Nonetheless, 
North maintained that Abrams knew details of his 
Contra-support activities. An entry in North's note-
book for April 25, 1986, suggests that North and 
Abrams discussed "support for S. front," the fact that 
the "air base [was] open in C[osta] R[ica]," and "100 
BP's [Blowpipe missiles]."4 North testified that he 
did not specifically recall that conversation, "but do 
not deny that I discussed those [items listed in North's 
notebook] at various points in time with Mr. Abrams 
and others."' 13 (Abrams was not asked about this 
notebook entry.) 
Moreover, the third key member of the RIG, the 
CIA Chief of the Central American Task Force (Cl 
CATF), testified that he was "taken aback" by 
Abrams' categorical denials of North's involve-
ment.' 16 While he insisted that he did not want "to 
impeach" Abrams' testimony, C/CATF told these 
Committees: "I thought he [Abrams] would have a 
broad brush understanding, as did a lot of other 
people, 011ie was in and around those things."7 
Abrams argued in defense of his statements that he 
or someone on his staff had checked with other key 
agencies?the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and 
the Department of Defense (DOD)?and verified that 
no U.S. officials were involved with the Hasenfus 
flight."" In their testimonies, two key CIA offi-
cials?the C/CATF and the Deputy Director for Op-
erations?mentioned no call from Abrams' office, and 
testified they were surprised by Abrams' categorical 
denials.' 9 
Similarly, Abrams noted that soon after the crash, 
while North was out of the country, he called an 
NSC staff officer and received assurances that the 
NSC staff was not involved in the Hasenfus flight.'" 
Abrams said the official "may have been Mr. 
Earl."121 Earl, however, was aware that the flight 
was part of "Democracy, Inc." and that North played 
an important role in that organization.'" (Earl was 
not asked about a call from Abrams.) 
During the period he was making his denials, 
Abrams spoke with North. But Abrams did not ask 
whether North was involved with the Hasenfus flight, 
despite the fact that Abrams, in his words, "knew that 
he [North] was monitoring" the private Contra sup-
port network.'" Abrams said he did not ask North 
because "it was very clear that [confirming his in-
volvement in the flight] would have been completely 
contradictory to what he had previously told me."1.24 
North had a different explanation: "He didn't have to 
ask me. . . He knew."125 
Finally, while testifying before the House Foreign 
Affairs Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 7 
on October 15, 1986, Abrams said that he did not 
believe anyone in the Government would know de-
tails about the flight: 
KOSTMAYER: "You have not been told by our 
Government, if indeed our Government knows, 
who organized and who paid for this particular 
flight?" 
ABRAMS: "I wouldn't separate myself from the 
Government. We don't know." 
KOSTMAYER: "Do you think there is anyone 
in the Government who does know?" 
ABRAMS: "No, because we don't track this kind 
of activity."126 
Asked to reconcile this response with the fact that 
he knew North monitored the Contra aid network, 
Abrams told these Committees: "To say that Col. 
North was the person who knew the most about the 
private benefactors?which I thought, and think to be 
the case?is not to say that he could tell you the 
name of every one of them and could tell you every-
thing that every one of them was doing each day."27 
CIA Deputy Director For Operations: Clair 
George, appearing with Abrams at two sessions 
before Congressional Committees, limited his denials 
to the Central Intelligence Agency. Typical of his 
remarks was the following from his opening statement 
before the House Intelligence Committee on October 
14: 
First I would like to state categorically that the 
Central Intelligence Agency was not involved 
directly or indirectly in arranging, directing or 
facilitating resupply missions conducted by pri-
vate individuals in support of the Nicarguan 
democratic resistance.'28 
In fact, at least one CIA official was directly involved 
in providing lethal supplies to the Contras in 1986. 
George testified before these Committees that he was 
unaware of this fact when he testified at the Hasenfus 
hearing. Nonetheless, in his testimony before these 
Committees, George admitted that his earlier state-
ment was "wrong", and he offered an apology.129 
George acknowledged that he knew in October 
1986, that the NSC staff was "participating in some 
way in supplying the Contras"3? but he allowed 
Abrams' categorical denials about the involvement of 
any U.S. officials to pass without comment. He ex-
plained: 
I was surprised Abrams made that statement. It 
was so categorical. The question is, should I leap 
up and say, 'hold it, Elliott, what about?excuse 
me, all you members of HPSCI, but Elliott and I 
are now going to discuss what we know about'?
and I didn't have the guts to do it.'" 
Saying he was "overly taken with trying to protect 
the Central Intelligence Agency," George expressed 
regret that he had not responded in some way to 
Abrams' categorical denials.'32 
CIA Central American Task Force Chief: The 
C/CATF told these Committees he was aware that 
the categorical denials about any U.S. involvement in 
the Hasenfus flight were wrong. Asked whether he 
had "any doubt" who ran the Hasenfus flight, he said, 
"No."33 However, testifying before the House Intel-
ligence Committee on October 14, the C/CATF said: 
"We know what the airplanes are by type. We knew, 
for example there were two C-123s and C-7 cargos . . 
. . We knew in some cases much less frequently that 
they were flying down . . . into southern Nicaragua 
for the purposes of resupply, but as to who was flying 
the flights and who was behind them, we do not 
know:9134 
The C/CATF maintained before these Committees 
that his statement was not false because he did not 
know exactly who was behind the flights: 
A: "I want to make one thing very, very clear. I 
don't lie and I don't provide false answers, and if 
I'm put in a situation that is undeniable, I will 
find some way to avoid lying. . . . I didn't know 
who was flying those flights." 
Q: "Or who was behind them, is what you said?" 
A: "You could have put me on a rack and I 
couldn't have told you who the pilots were, who 
was managing them. I at that time suspected, but 
didn't know that General Secord was involved 
with them. I had no idea where the money was 
coming from. . . . It is not a lie."35 
Generally, the C/CATF remained "uniquely 
silent," as he put it, during the hearings on the Hasen-
fus flight where he was a supporting witness: "I spoke 
when spoken to."36 He told these Committees that 
he had decided that, as the junior official on a panel 
with Abrams and George, he would not speak up 
first: 
I could have been more forthcoming, but I frank-
ly was not going to be the first person to step up 
and do that. . . . So long as others who knew the 
details, as much as I, who knew more than I, 
were keeping their silence on this, I was going to 
keep my silence. . . . I was a member of the 
administration team. I wasn't going to break 
ranks with the team. . . . My frame of mind was 
to protect, was to be a member of the team.'" 
The C/CATF told the Committees that he was "trou-
bled" by his failure to speak out, but added, "There is 
not a lot I can do about it."38

Abrams' Brunei Testimony 
In addition to denying any U.S. role in the Hasenfus 
flight, Elliott Abrams denied on several occasions that 
the U.S. Government actions had sought third-coun-
try funding for the Contras. His statements were 
made despite his previous involvement in soliciting 
funds from the Government of Brunei. In testimony 
before Congressional Committees in late 1986, 
Abrams repeatedly deflected questions about the Con-
tras' funding, giving responses which were, in his 
word, "misleading."139 
In an October 10 open hearing of the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, Senator Kerry asked 
Abrams whether Country 2 had provided assistance 
to the Resistance. Abrams replied: "I think I can say 
that while I have been Assistant Secretary, which is 
about 15 months, we have not received a dime from a 
foreign government, not a dime, from any foreign 
government." Asked whether the Contras had re-
ceived funds, Abrams said: "I don't know. But not 
that I am aware of and not through us." He added at 
the hearing that if the Contras had approached a 
foreign government, "I think I would know about 
it.?140 
Appearing before the House Intelligence Commit-
tee on October 14, 1986, together with Clair George, 
Abrams again denied that third countries had aided 
the Contras: 
ABRAMS: "I can only speak on that question for 
the last fifteen months when I have been in this 
job, and that story about [Country 2], to my 
knowledge is false. I personally cannot tell you 
about pre-1985, but in 1985-1986, when I have 
been around, no." 
CHAIRMAN: "Is it also false with respect to 
other governments as well?" 
ABRAMS: "Yes, it is also false."4' 
Before these Committees, Abrams testified that he 
did not know about the Country 2 or Country 3 
contributions. Although he had personally solicited 
Brunei, that country's donation had not been received 
at the time of his testimony, and therefore he ex-
plained it was technically true that the Contras had 
not received assistance from Brunei. Furthermore, 
Abrams testified that Brunei had been promised confi-
dentiality, and "I did not believe I was authorized to . 
. . reveal that solicitation."1.42 
On November 25, 1986, Abrams testified together 
with the CIA's C/CATF before the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence shortly after Attorney 
General Meese's press conference disclosing the di-
version of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Con-
tras. He was again asked about reports of third-coun-
try funding: 
148 
BRADLEY: ". . . Did either one of you have 
any knowledge or indication that the contras 
were receiving funds from . . . Mid-Eastern 
sources?" 
ABRAMS: "No." 
C/CATF: "No." 
BRADLEY: "Did either one of you ever discuss 
the problems of fundraising?" 
ABRAMS: "Let me add to that, Senator. I spoke 
to Dick Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for 
Near Eastern Affairs, probably in the course of 
the summer, to ask him if he thought I could 
raise any money from Middle Eastern sources. 
He was rather discouraging as to whether we 
would be able to do it, and so we never 
tried. . . ." 
BRADLEY: "Now, you did not discuss with 
anyone else in the Executive Branch the possibili-
ty of receiving funds from . . . any . . . Middle 
Eastern source?" 
ABRAMS: "That's correct. I never?once I had 
that conversation with him, that was the end of 
it."1.43 
Again, Abrams maintained that this testimony was 
literally correct because Brunei was not a Mid-East-
ern country.144 In his Senate Intelligence Committee 
appearance, Abrams was also asked whether he dis-
cussed third-country funding with members of the 
NSC staff: 
BRADLEY: "Did either one of you ever discuss 
the problems of fund raising by the Contras with 
members of the NSC staff?" 
ABRAMS: "Well, yes. I mean, I think?I can't 
remember a specific day, but certainly the ques-
tion?the fact, which now appears to be slightly 
mysterious, that they never had any money, we 
discussed?you know, it came up all the time, 
because they were always running out of every-
thing. So the question came up, sure." 
BRADLEY: ". . . So let me ask it again. Did 
either one of you ever discuss the problems of 
fund raising by the Contras with members of the 
NSC staff?" 
ABRAMS: "No, I can't remember." 
BRADLEY: "Well, you would say gee, they got 
a lot of problems, they don't have any money. 
Then you would just sit there and say, what are 
we going to do? They don't have any money. 
You never said, you know, maybe we could get 
the money this way?"

Chapter 7 
ABRAMS: "No. Other than the conversation I 
have?other than the Middle Eastern thing 
which I recounted to you. We're not?you know, 
we're not in the fundraising business. . . ." 
BRADLEY: "Were you completely ignorant of 
all fundraising activities by the Contras?" 
ABRAMS: "No. Certainly not in the?I knew 
for?I mean?I don't think I knew anything that 
wasn't?I am trying to think if I knew anything 
that wasn't in the newspaper, that is, I knew 
certainly that Singlaub was raising money for the 
Contras. I knew that others were raising money 
for the Contras. I mean, using the Contras in a 
very general sense. For example, Friends of the 
Americas raises money for medical relief and 
things like that. I knew that was happening. I 
didn't know what Singlaub was raising or how or 
what he did with it when he got it. I was, until 
today, fairly confident that there was no foreign 
government contributing to this. But I knew 
nothing, still don't know anything about the 
mechanisms by which money was transferred 
from private groups that have been raising it, to 
the Contras."145 
Abrams maintained before the Select Committees 
that these statements were "technically correct" be-
cause he was asked about "fundraising by the Con-
tras" and the Brunei solicitation was fundraising by 
the United States for the Contras.146 However, in his 
exchange with Senator Bradley, when asked whether 
he was ignorant of all fundraising "by the Contras," 
Abrams did not limit his responses to his knowledge 
of fundraising by the Contras. He specifically men-
tioned fundraising for the Contras by John Singlaub 
and by the group, Friends of the Americas. 
Finally, in his Senate Select Committee testimony, 
Abrams distanced the State Department from Contra-
related fundraising. He stated: "We don't engage?I 
mean the State Department's function in this has not 
been to raise money, other than to try to raise it from 
Congress."147 
In his testimony before these Committees, Abrams 
acknowledged that he intended to prevent the Mem-
bers of Congress from learning about the solicitation 
of Brunei: 
Q: In fact, your approach on November 25 . . . 
was that unless the Senators asked you exactly 
the right question, using exactly the right words, 
they weren't going to get the right answers. 
Wasn't that the approach? 
A: That is exactly the correct description of what 
I did on that date. . . 
Q: And, as you have said. . . it would have been 
a very easy thing to have stopped the whole 
shooting match by simply saying Senators you 
are now getting into an area that I am not au-
thorized to discuss? 
A: It would have been relatively easy. It would 
have been the right thing to do. . . . 
Q: And so unless the Senators knew the facts in 
advance so they could frame their question in 
exactly the right words, they wouldn't find out 
and they didn't find out. Isn't that what hap-
pened? 
A: Correct. That is exactly what happened.'" 
Abrams testified that after his November 25 testi-
mony, he realized that he had "failed to disclose the 
solicitation of Brunei," and asked for permission to 
"go back and tell the Committee there had indeed 
been another solicitation." Abrams attempted to reach 
Senator Bradley, who had posed the question, to ex-
plain that there had, in fact, been a solicitation which 
he had failed to mention in this testimony. Failing to 
reach Bradley, he conveyed the message to a member 
of the Senator's staff. When Abrams appeared again 
before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Decem-
ber 8, he was asked to explain his answers to the 
Committee as a whole. Shown a transcript of his 
earlier statements, Abrams admitted they were mis-
leading but attempted to defend them as technically 
accurate. After a recess, Abrams apologized to the 
Members, having been advised by Senator Boren to 
do so.149 
He made no similar effort to correct his testimony 
in October before the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee or the House Intelligence Committee. 
Conclusion 
Throughout the period of Congressional restrictions 
on lethal aid to the Contras, Administration officials 
were asked repeatedly whether the U.S. Government 
was in any way providing such support. In every 
instance, officials responded to the inquiries with eva-
sive answers or categorical denials. Some of these 
officials made their statements as part of a deliberate 
attempt to conceal what they knew about U.S. Gov-
ernment support for the Nicaraguan Resistance. 
These Committees found no direct evidence sug-
gesting that the President was a knowing participant 
in the effort to deceive Congress and the American 
public. But the President's actions and statements con-
tributed to the deception. 
Congressional Committees overseeing the imple-
mentation of the Boland Amendment repeatedly 
sought to determine how the Contras were being 
funded. The President knew that Country 2 had pro-
vided substantial sums of money to the Resistance; he 
had personally discussed such a contribution with the 
leader of that country. But knowledge of this contri-

Chapter 7 
bution was not widely shared within the Administra-
tion. Indeed, high-ranking State Department officials 
were permitted on several occasions to testify to Con-
gress that it was not the policy of the United States to 
facilitate or encourage third-country donations, and 
that the Administration had not in fact done so. In 
one instance, following the enactment of the full pro-
hibition Boland Amendment in October 1984, Ambas-
sador Motley testified that "soliciting" or "encourag-
ing" third country donations would violate the law. 
In October 1986, the President denied that the U.S. 
Government had any connection with the Hasenfus 
flight, depicting it as part of a "private" operation. 
According to Poindexter the President "understood 
that the Contras were being supported and that we 
were involved in?generally involved in coordinating 
the effort."5? These Committees found no evidence 
suggesting that the President knew his statements 
about the flight were false. He merely echoed the 
denials made the day before by State Department 
officials.'51 The National Security Adviser and others 
who knew the President's remarks were false appear 
to have made no effort to ensure that the President's 
statements were accurate and his knowledge com-
plete. Poindexter testified he was too busy with the 
Reykjavik summit to correct the public record."2 
Reasons for the Deception 
North endeavored to explain the need for the decep-
tion by arguing that he was forced to weigh "the 
differences between lives and lies." He told the Com-
mittees: 
[t]he revelations of the actual details of this activ-
ity . . . would have cost the lives of those with 
whom I was working, would have jeopardized 
the governments which had assisted us, would 
have jeopardized the lives of the Americans who 
in some cases were flying flights over Nicaragua, 
would have put at great risk those inside Nicara-
gua and in Eastern Europe and other places 
where people were working hard to keep them 
alive. . . .153 
North's justification for his decision to deceive does 
not withstand analysis. Congress is routinely briefed 
on covert operations where lives are at risk. Beyond 
that, Congress publicly debated and then approved 
150 
the support of the Contras prior to enactment of the 
Boland prohibition. Operational details that would 
have put at risk the personnel conducting those oper-
ations were not publicly revealed. The same is true 
for the Congressionally approved operation in support 
of the Contras currently underway. 
Even in 1985 and 1986, Congress was not asking 
about operational details such as drop-zone coordi-
nates or flight paths. Members of Congress simply 
wanted to know whether it was true that the U.S. 
Government was providing lethal support to the Nic-
araguan Resistance. 
Indeed, North testified that his efforts were known 
widely outside the United States, even by this Coun-
try's enemies: "Izvestia knew it . . . . My name had 
been in the newspapers in Moscow, all over Daniel 
Ortega's newscasts. Radio Havana was broadcasting 
it."154 Moreover, it was important to the success of 
the resupply operation that friendly countries in Cen-
tral America knew that the U.S. Government support 
for the Contras was continuing so that they would 
not drive the Contras out of their countries. 
Only the American people and the Congress were 
kept in the dark. Had they known, it would not have 
been lives at risk but the NSC staffs secret operation 
itself. Poindexter told these Committees he believed 
during his tenure in the White House that disclosure 
of the NSC staff operation would have almost surely 
triggered tighter restrictions on aid to the Contras."5 
McFarlane testified that disclosure of the "troubling" 
documents on North's activities which he had gath-
ered in response to a Congressional inquiry "would be 
an extremely torturous, conflicting, disagreeable out-
come and that I hoped we didn't come to that."56 
North's contemporaneous actions and words pro-
vide clear evidence that the reasons for the deception 
had more to do with the political risk to the operation 
than to the physical risk to operation personnel. The 
record is clear that North's actions after the revela-
tion of the Santa Elena airfield were motivated by a 
desire to prevent the discovery of "USG finger-
prints," in his words, on the airfield. 
In addition, in a May 1986, PROF note to Poin-
dexter, North warned that Members of Congress were 
bound to become "more inquisitive" as the Contra 
operation's level of activity increased. He wrote: 
"While I care not a whit what they say about me, it 
could well become a political embarassment for the 
President and you." '57

reported H. Res. 485 unfavorably. "Unlike the usual prac-
tice of the House in a resolution of inquiry," the report

explained "rather than requesting him [the President] to 
produce the specified materials, this resolution directs the 
production of information." This, the report said, "could 
place the President in an untenable position concerning 
compliance if the resolution were agreed to in its present 
form." (Rept. 99-724) As a result, the other two Committees 
to which it had been referred-Foreign Affairs and Intelli-
gence-were no longer compelled to report the measure 
within 14 days. Nevertheless, the resolution was still pend-
ing under the rules of ordinary legislation, and Committee 
members wanted to give it full consideration. They deemed 
it necessary to meet with Oliver North. 
47. In attendance at the 8:30 a.m. meeting with North 
were Chairman Hamilton, Representatives McCurdy, Kas-
tenmeier, Daniel, Roe, Stump, Ireland, Hyde, Cheney, Liv-
ingston, and McEwen; Bob Pearson and Ron Sable of the 
NSC staff; and Tom Latimer and Steve Berry of Committee 
staff.

Committee members came to the meeting believing that 
official Administration policy held that the NSC staff was 
covered by the Boland Amendment. The former National 
Security Adviser had told the House Intelligence Commit-
tee as much the year before, and the current National Secu-
rity Adviser had indicated by his letter that the interpreta-
tion stood. North, in his statements to the Members, said 
nothing to the contrary. He stated that he had always acted 
in compliance with the letter and the spirit of the Boland 
Amendment. During the session, he admitted undertaking 
only those actions clearly permitted by all officials of the 
Executive Branch. He denied activities that Members who 
believed the Boland Amendment applied to the NSC would 
have interpreted as illegal.

Chapter 8 
U.S.-Iran Relations and the Hostages in 
Lebanon 
For many Americans, the most surprising and alarm-
ing aspect of the Iran-Contra Affair was President 
Reagan's decision to sell arms to Iran. Only a few 
years before, that nation had humiliated the United 
States. From November 1979 to January 1981, Iran 
held American diplomats hostage, while Iranian mobs 
in the streets of Tehran chanted slogans calling for 
the death of President Carter and the destruction of 
U.S. interests throughout the Middle East. 
Since November 14, 1979, first in response to the 
hostage crisis and then because of the Iran-Iraq war, 
the United States had embargoed the sale of arms to 
Iran. Moreover, it had been the policy of the United 
States since December 1983 to pressure other govern-
ments, through "Operation Staunch," to stop the sale 
of arms to Iran in order to help bring an early end to 
the Iran-Iraq war. 
The United States also opposed the transfer of arms 
to Iran because of its involvement in terrorist activi-
ties. Following repeated attacks against Americans 
and U.S. interests in Lebanon, the Secretary of State 
officially placed Iran on a list of countries -supporting 
terrorism. Reagan Administration policy on terrorism 
was well known and was clearly stated by the Presi-
dent: "We make no concessions. We make no deals." 
Why did the Reagan Administration make a com-
plete about-face on both of these publicly stated poli-
cies?to sell no arms to Iran and to make no conces-
sions to terrorists? The background of recent U.S. 
policy toward Iran and of the seizure of American 
hostages in Lebanon provides a context in which to 
assess those policy reversals. 
No Regional Guarantees 
Partly in reaction to the war in Vietnam, the 
United States in 1969 began to shift to a worldwide 
policy of no longer directly guaranteeing the security 
of its regional allies. Instead, the United States would 
work with its friends to ensure ? that they had the 
military capability to defend themselves against inter-
nal subversion or external threat. Under the Nixon 
Doctrine, the United States looked to regional 
powers, such as Iran, to serve as guardians of Ameri-
can interests in distant corners of the world. 
Iran's armed forces, under Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi, served as a deterrent to regional aggression 
in this conception of American policy. "Iran," Presi-
dent Carter declared during a 1977 trip to Tehran, 
"because of the great leadership of the Shah, is an 
island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of 
the world."2 Equipped with the latest American 
weaponry and backed by a 350,000-man army, Iran 
had become America's policeman in the Gulf. The 
Shah relished the role and his power. "Nobody can 
overthrow me," he once boasted, "I have the support 
of 700,000 troops, all the workers, and most of the 
people. I have the power."3 
The Shah's power proved illusory. Growing pro-
tests by students, leftists, and, most importantly, 
Muslim religious opponents led in February 1979 to 
the Shah's overthrow and his replacement by a Shiite 
Muslim religious leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, who 
had been forced into exile in 1964, first to Iraq and 
then to France. The new regime was contemptuous of 
both the United States?the "Great Satan"?and the 
West. Fiery Shiite clerics accused the United States of 
imperialism and the murder of thousands during the 
Shah's rule. America's fortunes in Iran had crumbled. 
If any doubt remained about the nature of the new 
regime, it was removed on November 4, 1979, 
when youthful Iranian militants?the Revolutionary 
Guards?stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and 
took 66 American diplomats hostage. The hostage 
crisis lasted 444 days. It helped to drive one President 
from office and to elect another who pledged that 
America would not be so humiliated again.4 
Arms Sales to Iran 
In response to the Embassy seizure, the United States 
on November 14, 1979, embargoed all arms shipments 
to Iran as part of a general embargo on trade and 
financial transactions. Ten months later, however, the 
invasion of Iran by Iraq, on September 22, 1980, 
raised the question of who might ultimately be pun-
ished by this punitive measure. The prospect of an 
Iranian defeat and an increase in Soviet influence in 
the region was of concern.

Chapter 8 
Iran's armed forces were in disarray; the officer 
corps and enlisted ranks had been decimated by gov-
ernment purges and desertions. Iran's military arsenal 
was also in poor shape. Modern aircraft, armor, and 
naval vessels purchased by the Shah had been left 
unattended during the 24-month revolution and were 
badly in need of spare parts and maintenance. Adding 
to Tehran's vulnerability was the fact that most of the 
weaponry in the Shah's arsenal was of American man-
ufacture, and the U.S. embargo prevented resupply. 
National Security Council (NSC) and Central Intelli-
gence Agency (CIA) analysts concluded that the 
Ayatollah Khomeini was ill-prepared to meet Iraq in 
a modern war. 
Against this background, the Reagan Administra-
tion's Senior Interdepartmental Group (SIG) con-
vened on July 21, 1981, to discuss U.S. policy toward 
Iran. SIG members concluded "that U.S. efforts to 
discourage third country transfers of non-U.S. origin 
arms would have only a marginal effect on the con-
duct and outcome of the war, but could increase 
opportunities for the Soviets to take advantage of 
Iran's security concerns and to persuade Iran to 
accept Soviet military assistance."5 While no agency 
representative argued in favor of U.S. action to en-
courage an increase in arms supply to Iran, some 
expressed concern that a rigid U.S. policy against all 
arms transfers to Iran would not serve overall U.S. 
interests. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, strongly op-
posed arms sales to Iran, which they believed would 
represent a profound shift in U.S. policy that "would 
be perceived by the moderate Arab states as an action 
directly counter to their interests." Similarly, they 
felt that any li]mprovement in the Iranian arms 
supply would intensify the war with Iraq" and possi-
bly spill over into neighboring states. Administration 
policy against arms sales to Iran remained firm. 
Despite the U.S. embargo, Iran obtained weapons 
and military support services on the thriving world 
arms market. Oil was often the medium of exchange 
in elaborate barter deals, and Persian Gulf trade 
became an irresistible lure for international arms mer-
chants. The Reagan Administration listed no fewer 
than 41 countries that had provided Iran with weap-
ons since the start of the war.7 
As a result, by the spring of 1983, the tide in the 
Gulf war had turned in favor of Iran. A steady supply 
of munitions, artillery, and ground-to-air and ground-
to-ground missiles had enabled the more numerous 
Iranian armed forces and Revolutionary Guards to 
expel Iraqi forces, seize and retain some small pieces 
of Iraqi territory, and shell the major city of Basra 
and the capital city, Baghdad. Once thought by West-
ern analysts to be on the verge of collapse, Iran had 
rebounded from its earlier battlefield setbacks. 
Operation Staunch 
At this point the Administration decided to initiate 
Operation Staunch, a plan seeking the cooperation of 
other governments in an arms sales embargo against 
? Iran. On December 14, 1983, the State Department 
instructed its Embassies in countries believed to be 
involved in arms trade with Tehran to urge their host 
governments to "stop transferring arms to Iran be-
cause of the broader interests of the international 
community in achieving a negotiated end to the Iran-
Iraq war." 
Within the U.S. Government, authorities increased 
surveillance of shipments of American equipment and 
spare parts destined (usually through intermediaries) 
for Iran. Between January 1984 and January 1987, the 
State Department sent more than 400 cables to Amer-
ican overseas missions urging compliance with Oper-
ation Staunch. Secretary Shultz personally urged 
member governments to work within the European 
Community to reduce the flow of materiel to Iran. 
Reports persisted that Israel still actively supplied 
the Iranian military despite U.S. efforts to stop arms 
sales through Operation Staunch. Other reports hinted 
that U.S. and Israeli representatives met regularly to 
discuss Tehran's war needs. Widespread reports, par-
ticularly from the Middle East, also suggested that the 
United States was violating its own arms prohibitions. 
The effectiveness of Operation Staunch was uncer-
tain, but Iran's military potential clearly grew. 
The U.S. Government repeatedly and publicly reaf-
firmed its commitment to lessening the flow of arma-
ments to Tehran. A typical public statement from the 
State Department, dated May 1985, noted that: "The 
U.S. does not permit U.S. arms and munitions to be 
shipped to either belligerent and has discouraged all 
free-world arms shipments to Iran because, unlike 
Iraq, Iran is adamantly opposed to negotiations or a 
mediated end to the conflict." 
Iran's Support of Terrorism 
The long-suppressed Shiite community in Lebanon, 
with close religious and familial ties to Iran, had 
found inspiration in the rule of the Ayatollah Kho-
meini. In the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Leba-
non in June 1982, some Shiite groups in Lebanon used 
political kidnappings and terrorism against Americans 
and American institutions as retaliation against per-
ceived U.S. support for the Israeli invasion and occu-
pation of their country. The United States became 
aware in July 1982 that Iran was supporting groups in 
Lebanon, such as Islamic Jihad and the Hizballah 
(Party of God), that were suspected of terrorism. 
United States Marines had been sent to Lebanon 
briefly in August and September 1982 to supervise the 
withdrawal of forces of the Palestine Liberation Or-
ganization (PLO) from Beirut and returned to Leba-

non soon thereafter in the aftermath of the Sabra and 
Shatila massacres. The purpose of the U.S. presence 
in Beirut was to help support the Government of 
Lebanon in its efforts to restore stability and its au-
thority throughout Lebanon. The U.S. troops came to 
be perceived in Lebanon as a partisan militia, howev-
er, working on behalf of the Maronite-and-Christian-
controlled government. 
A series of bold attacks followed against Americans 
and American interests throughout Lebanon. The 
U.S. Embassy in Beirut was destroyed in April 1983, 
killing 63, including 17 Americans. A suicide bombing 
on October 23, 1983, killed 241 Marines in their bar-
racks in Beirut. This incident was followed in Decem-
ber by a series of bombing attacks against the U.S. 
and French Embassies in Kuwait. The 17 men who 
were apprehended in the Kuwait attack were tried 
and sentenced to prison. The release of these "Da'wa 
prisoners" (as they came to be known after a pro-
Khomeini party with supporters in several countries) 
became a key demand of the Hizballah as attacks 
against U.S. targets and the taking of American hos-
tages continued in Lebanon. 
The Hizballah, a loosely structured movement cen-
tered on the Shiite clans of the Bekaa Valley, 
emerged as a principal opponent of the United States 
and the Western presence in Lebanon. The use of 
force?particularly terrorism?against Western inter-
ests in Lebanon was viewed by the more militant 
members of Hizballah as religiously sanctioned. 
From the outset, U.S. intelligence recognized that 
the Hizballah was composed of competing political 
elements, not all of whom were controlled by Iran. 
But frustration mounted within the Administration in 
the aftermath of the Marine barracks bombing, the 
Kuwait Embassy attack, and the assassination on Jan-
uary 11, 1984, of the President of the American Uni-
versity in Beirut, Malcolm Kerr. 
On January 20, 1984, the Secretary of State desig-
nated Iran a sponsor of international terrorism. This 
decision was followed 4 days later by the announce-
ment that Iran would be subjected to U.S. Govern-
ment regulations limiting the export of U.S. military 
equipment to "countries that have repeatedly provid-
ed support for acts of international terrorism."9 The 
State Department assured Congress that "[t]he ques-
tion of further controls under this rubric is currently 
under active review at senior levels of the Adminis-
tration."" The Department announced these addi-
tional measures based upon what it termed convincing 
evidence of a broad Iranian policy furthering terror-
ism beyond its borders, including public statements by 
Iranian officials supporting those acts. 
160 
Hostage-Taking Begins 
The hostage-taking that was to propel the Iran-
Contra Affair began 6 weeks later. 
Three Americans were seized in Beirut in 1984: 
Jeremy Levin, Beirut Bureau Chief for the Cable 
News Network, on March 7; William Buckley, CIA's 
Chief of Station, on March 14; and the Reverend 
Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister who had lived 
in the Lebanese capital for 30 years, on May 8, 1984. 
Buckley's capture was of special concern for CIA 
Director Casey. It was suspected at the time?and 
later confirmed?that Buckley was being tortured, 
and Casey wanted to spare no effort to get him back. 
Citing a continuing pattern of Iranian support for 
terrorism, the State Department imposed new restric-
tions in September 1984 on the export to Iran of 
aircraft, spare parts for aircraft, and high-powered 
outboard motors. The Department also banned all 
other goods and technology to Iran intended for a 
"military end-use or end-user." 
The Administration staked out an increasingly 
tough public position on dealing with terrorists. 
Speaking in New York on October 25, 1984, Secre-
tary Shultz called for "swift and sure measures" 
against terrorists, both to prevent attacks and to re-
taliate for them: "[Me cannot allow ourselves to 
become the Hamlet of nations, worrying endlessly 
over whether and how to respond," he said." 
Yet the hostage-taking continued. Four Americans 
were seized in 1985: Father Lawrence Martin Jenco, 
Director of Catholic Relief Services in Beirut, on 
January 8; Terry Anderson, chief Middle East corre-
spondent for the Associated Press, on March 16; 
David Jacobsen, Director of the American University 
Hospital, on May 28; and Thomas P. Sutherland, 
Dean of the American University's School of Agri-
culture, on June 9. 
Throughout this period, the only positive develop-
ment on the hostages came on February 13, when 
Jeremy Levin gained his freedom. It remains uncer-
tain whether he escaped from, or was released by, his 
captors after nearly 11 months of confinement. 
Around the time that Levin was freed, the NSC, with 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, created an interagency Hos-
tage Location Task Force. 
On June 14, 1985, Shiite terrorists struck again, 
hijacking TWA flight 847 and murdering one of its 
passengers, Navy diver Robert Stetham. National Se-
curity Adviser Robert McFarlane publicly stated: "It 
is my purpose to remind terrorists and to keep them 
on notice that no act of violence against Americans 
will go without a response." 2

Chapter 9 
The Iran Arms Sales: The Beginning 
In August 1985, the President decided that the United 
States would allow arms sales to Iran. The decision 
represented a reversal of U.S. policy against selling 
arms to Iran and, as it later turned out, against 
making concessions for the return of hostages. Yet it 
was made so casually that it was not written down, 
the President did not recall it 15 months later, and the 
Secretaries of State and Defense were not even told 
of it at the time. 
The President's decision triggered a series of arms 
transactions with Iran that continued for 15 months. 
At the initial transaction, the Iranians established a 
pattern of dealing that never changed: Iran would 
agree to get the hostages freed in return for arms; 
once the arms arrived, the Iranians would demand 
still more weapons; only after another arms shipment 
would a single hostage?not a group, as promised?be 
freed. But, instead of breaking off the transactions, the 
Americans continued to accede to the Iranian de-
mands. What follows is the story of how the arms 
sales began. 
The Actors Take Their Places 
Long before the President made his decision, the indi-
viduals and circumstances that propelled the sales 
were at work in Washington, Jerusalem, and Tehran. 
Since the fall of 1984, the National Security Coun-
cil (NSC) staff had been pressing other Government 
agencies to develop a plan for opening a relationship 
with Iran and moderating that government's anti-
American stance. The State Department and the De-
fense Department opposed the notion, and while the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was favorably in-
clined, officials there said renewed relations hinged on 
the release of seven U.S. hostages held by the pro-
Iranian Hizballah in Lebanon and on a pledge by Iran 
to stop terrorist activities. 
In Jerusalem, officials were eager for better rela-
tions with Iran, for two very pragmatic reasons: com-
mercial and diplomatic. Israel had friendly relations 
with Iran under the Shah. Despite revolutionary 
Iran's vow to destroy Israel, the Israelis regarded Iraq 
as a greater threat to their security than Iran. Israel's 
goal was to create conditions for the resumption of 
commercial and diplomatic relations with a post-Kho-
meini regime. 
Tehran had its own agenda. Rhetoric notwithstand-
ing?the United States was considered "The Great 
Satan" and Israel a blasphemy?Tehran wanted 
modern tanks and high-technology antitank and anti-
aircraft missiles to counter Iraq's Soviet-made fighter 
planes and modern tanks. It needed spare parts to 
maintain the arsenal of weapons that the Shah had 
purchased from the United States. 
The unlikely catalyst for bringing these disparate 
parties together was Manucher Ghorbanifar?a re-
sourceful Iranian merchant living in Paris who under-
stood the intersection of interests and saw how the 
American hostages could be used as an incentive for 
the sale of missiles to Iran. 
Ghorbanifar 
Since fleeing Ilan in 1979, Ghorbanifar had sought 
to make a career as a broker through whom Western 
governments could develop contact with Iran. By 
1984, Ghorbanifar was well known to U.S. intelli-
gence services, and details of his activities filled a 
thick file in the CIA's Operations Directorate. The 
CIA viewed Ghorbanifar with particular disfavor, but 
that did little to discourage the Iranian from trying to 
interest U.S. intelligence agencies in various schemes, 
all of which would financially benefit him. 
His CIA file describes Ghorbanifar as an Iranian 
businessman and self-proclaimed "wheeler dealer" 
who, prior to the 1979 revolution, had been the man-
aging director of an Israeli-connected Iranian shipping 
company. According to rumors, Ghorbanifar also was 
an informant for SAVAK, the Shah's intelligence 
service, and had a relationship with Israeli intelli-
gence; but those relationships have never been con-
firmed. 
Ghorbanifar's business permitted him to travel out-
side Iran, and, following the revolution, he chose 
Paris as his base of operations, particularly after he 
and his brothers, Ali and Reza, were implicated in an 
abortive July 9, 1980, coup attempt in Iran. Ghorbani-
far apparently developed his own intelligence net-
work and endeavored to sell his services to various 
Western governments. Ghorbanifar became a CIA re-
porting source in January 1980. Described by the

Chapter 9 
Agency as a "rumormonger of occasional usefulness," 
Ghorbanifar lasted as a source only until September 
1981, when the Agency decided he was concerned 
solely with advancing his financial interests.' 
Information generated by Ghorbanifar continued to 
reach the CIA, however, both directly and through 
other intelligence agencies. In January 1984, Ghor-
banifar contacted U.S. Army Intelligence in West 
Germany with tales of "Iranian terrorist organiza-
tions, plans, and activities." 2 In mid-March, a CIA 
officer met with Ghorbanifar in Frankfurt to explore 
the data Ghorbanifar was offering. At that meeting, 
Ghorbanifar indicated he had information on the kid-
napping, in Beirut, of CIA Chief of Station William 
Buckley. He identified an Iranian official (the Second 
Iranian), who would play a key role in the arms-for-
hostages transactions a year later, as the "individual 
responsible" for the kidnapping.3 He also described 
an Iranian plot to assassinate U.S. Presidential candi-
dates.4 
A CIA-administered polygraph examination of 
Ghorbanifar on this information indicated he was 
lying. Ghorbanifar gave no satisfactory explanation 
for the results.3 Undeterred, he again approached the 
CIA in June 1984, this time trying to broker a meet-
ing between the U.S. Government and another Irani-
an official (the First Iranian).6 The First Iranian was 
also to be a key player in the arms-for-hostages trans-
actions of 1985 and 1986. According to Ghorbanifar, 
the First Iranian was favorably disposed towards the 
United States.7 
Again, Ghorbanifar was polygraphed, and again, 
the examination indicated he was lying.8 This time, 
the CIA responded by publishing, on July 25, 1984, a 
rarely issued "Fabricator Notice," warning Agency 
personnel and other U.S. intelligence and law enforce-
ment agencies that Ghorbanifar "should be regarded 
as an intelligence fabricator and a nuisance." 9 
Ghorbanifar Proposes to Ransom the Hostages 
Ghorbanifar continued to seek a relationship with 
the U.S. Government. His first chance came in No-
vember 1984 when he met Theodore Shackley, a 
former Associate Deputy Director for Operations of 
the CIA who had retired from the Agency in 1978. 
On behalf of his "risk management" firm, Research 
Associates, Inc., Shackley maintained contact with 
the former head of the Shah's SAVAK Counterespio-
nage Department VIII, General Manucher Hashemi. 
At the suggestion of Hashemi, Shackley traveled to 
Hamburg, West Germany, where he met with a 
group of Iranians, including Ghorbanifar, the First 
Iranian and a Dr. Shahabadi, chief of the Iranian 
purchasing office in Hamburg and purportedly a 
friend of Saudi entrepreneur and arms dealer Adnan 
Khashoggi. At one meeting, on November 20, Ghor-
banifar told Shackley that for a price he could ar-
range for the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon 
164 
through his Iranian contacts. Ghorbanifar said he re-
quired a response on the "ransom deal" by December 
7. Ghorbanifar added that he would not work with 
the CIA because the Agency was "unreasonable and 
unprofessional." 10 Upon his return to the United 
States, Shackley sent a memorandum about his meet-
ings with Ghorbanifar to Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, 
Ambassador-at-Large in the State Department and 
a former Deputy Director of the CIA." Walters 
referred the memorandum to Hugh Montgomery, 
Director of Intelligence and Research in the State 
Department. Montgomery, in turn, passed the Shack-
ley memorandum to Ambassador Robert B. Oakley, 
head of the State Department's counterterrorism ef-
forts, and Assistant Secretary of State for Near East-
ern Affairs Richard W. Murphy. Oakley and Murphy 
regarded the hostage ransom proposal as a "scam," 
and on December 11, 1984, Montgomery told Shack-
ley that the State Department was not interested in 
pursuing the Ghorbanifar ransom proposal." 
Ghorbanifar Tries Again 
Ghorbanifar still did not give up. Having failed 
with the CIA, the Army, and the State Department, 
he found another and ultimately more fruitful channel 
into the U.S. Government through Israel. A New 
York businessman, Roy Furmark, served as the con-
tact point. Furmark had previously worked for Adnan 
Khashoggi, and was a friend of CIA Director William 
Casey. Furmark also knew Cyrus Hashemi, a natural-
ized U.S. citizen of Iranian extraction whom Furmark 
tried to interest in a number of business ventures." In 
January 1985, Furmark and Ghorbanifar met while 
Furmark was in Europe to discuss business opportuni-
ties in Iran." 
Furmark later introduced Ghorbanifar to Hashemi 
and Khashoggi." Ghorbanifar, at this time, was look-
ing for sophisticated weapons for Iran, and Khashoggi 
suggested that Ghorbanifar try to develop access to 
the United States and its weapons through Israel. 
Sometime later, Khashoggi put Ghorbanifar and Ha-
shemi in touch with an Israeli group: Al Schwimmer, 
an adviser to then Israeli Prime Minister Shimon 
Peres, and Ya'accov Nimrodi, an Israeli businessman 
with government service background." Both Kha-
shoggi and Hashemi saw the potential for huge profits 
if Ghorbanifar were to become the conduit for U.S. 
arms to Iran and gain control of trade between the 
United States and Iran." 
At Khashoggi's initiative members of the Israeli 
team met with Hashemi and Ghorbanifar in London, 
Geneva, and Israel in early spring. Weapons sales to 
Iran were discussed but the meetings produced noth-
ing concrete." In late April, Ghorbanifar proposed 
to one of the Israelis that he be permitted to purchase 
U.S.-manufactured TOW antitank missiles from Israel, 
and, in return, he would obtain the release of CIA

Beirut Chief of Station Buckley, then a hostage in 
Lebanon.' 9 
Ledeen Gets Involved 
At about that same time, NSC consultant Michael 
Ledeen was trying to persuade National Security Ad-
viser Robert McFarlane to use him as an informal 
channel to get intelligence on Iran from Israel, using 
his close personal relationships with several high-
ranking Israeli officials.2? In March 1985, Ledeen met 
in Europe with a senior official from a western Euro-
pean nation who told Ledeen that the United States 
could play a significant role in Iran. The foreign offi-
cial recommended that the United States contact 
Israel because the Israelis had the best intelligence 
resources on Iran.21 Upon his return to the United 
States in early April, Ledeen proposed to McFarlane 
that he be authorized to meet with Israeli Prime Min-
ister Peres and other Israeli officials to explore poten-
tial Israeli-U.S. cooperation on Iran.22 Although the 
NSC staff told McFarlane that "none of us feel Mike 
should be our primary channel for working the Iran 
issue with foreign governments," 23 they were im-
pressed with Ledeen's access to Prime Minister Peres, 
and therefore recommended that Ledeen informally 
meet with the Israelis to express interest in developing 
"a more serious and coordinated strategy for dealing 
with the Iranian succession crisis."24 McFarlane 
agreed. 
Ledeen traveled to Israel in early May.25 On May 
3 he met with Prime Minister Peres and then with a 
former senior official of the Israel Defense Forces." 
During the meetings, Ledeen said he was acting on 
McFarlane's behalf, although in a private rather than 
official capacity, and expressed interest in sharing in-
telligence on Iran. According to Ledeen, the Ameri-
cans held hostage in Lebanon were not discussed at 
these meetings in early May.27 An Israeli official, 
however, recalls Ledeen's telling him about offers by 
various Iranians to help get the hostages released." 
According to Ledeen, the Prime Minister asked him 
to advise McFarlane that Israel wanted to sell artil-
lery shells or pieces to Iran but would do so only if it 
received U.S. approval. 2 9 
The NSC Reconsiders Iran Policy 
When he returned to the United States, Ledeen told 
NSC staff member Donald Fortier that the Israelis 
were interested in working with the United States on 
Iran. At the time, Fortier was working closely with 
CIA National Intelligence Officer for the Near East 
and South Asia, Graham Fuller, who was updating 
the Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) on 
Iran at McFarlane's request.3? A SNIE represents the 
U.S. intelligence community's short-term assessment of 
a given country or situation in response to a specific 
need. Both the SNIE circulated on May 20 and a 
memo submitted by Fuller three days earlier to CIA 
Director Casey, included a recommendation of arms 
sales through an ally as one of a number of options 
for pursuing an opening to Iran." The NSC staff 
concluded that Israel should be that country, al-
though FOrtier continued to question whether Ledeen 
was the appropriate intermediary through which the 
United States should deal with Israel.32 
On June 3, 1985, McFarlane approved a second 
Ledeen trip to Israe1,33 but Ledeen's return to Israel 
was delayed when Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz protested Ledeen's earlier trip.34 Shultz had 
heard from the U.S. Ambassador to Israel that 
Ledeen had been in Israel talking to Israeli officials 
about obtaining intelligence on Iran, without notice to 
the U.S. Embassy.35 Shultz complained to McFarlane 
that neither he nor the U.S. Ambassador to Israel had 
been informed of the trip, and pointed out that Israel 
and the United States had differing interests in Iran. 
He also questioned the wisdom of relying upon Israeli 
intelligence about Iran." McFarlane told Shultz that 
Ledeen had taken the May trip "on his own hook." 
He also said he was "turning [the Iran initiative] off 
entirely."37 In fact, McFarlane told Ledeen to post-
pone, not cancel, the trip." 
Major policy changes call for consultation with the 
Secretaries of State and Defense and an opportunity 
for the President to consider their views. McFarlane 
thus began the established process of interdepartmen-
tal policy formulation. He had earlier requested the 
CIA to prepare the updated SNIE on Iran, and in 
June he asked members of his staff to prepare a draft 
National Security Decision Directive (NSDD). An 
NSDD is a Presidential directive establishing policy 
in a particular area. It is the result of an analytical 
process, including discussions among the interested 
parties. 
Fortier and Howard Teicher of the NSC staff sub-
mitted the draft NSDD to McFarlane on June 11, and 
on June 17, McFarlane circulated this draft to Secre-
tary Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Wein-
berger, and CIA Director Casey. The draft NSDD 
recommended, among other things, that anti-Kho-
meini factions in Iran should be supported, and that 
U.S. allies and friendly states should be encouraged to 
"help Iran meet its import requirements . . . 
includ[ing] provision of selected military equip-
ment."" To bolster the NSC's analysis, McFarlane 
cited the CIA's earlier intelligence estimate that had 
recommended such arms sales, and warned of the 
Soviet threat to Iran.4? 
Only Casey endorsed the draft NSDD.41 Secretary 
Weinberger wrote on the transmittal note accompany-
ing the draft, "This is almost too absurd to comment 
on. . . . It's like asking Quadaffi to Washington for a 
cozy chat."42 Weinberger's response to the National 
Security Adviser was less sarcastic but unambiguously 
negative.43 Secretary Shultz's response was also nega-

tive. He criticized the idea of relaxing the arms em-
bargo against Iran, warned against the danger of 
strengthening Iran, and disagreed with the notion that 
Iran was in danger of falling into Soviet hands.44 
During the same period, the President was sharply 
critical of Iran. In a speech to the American Bar 
Association on July 8, 1985, the President declared 
Iran to be part of a "confederation of terrorist states 
. . . a new international version of Murder Incorpo-
rated." He added, "Let me make it plain to the assas-
sins in Beirut and their accomplices that America will 
never make concessions to terrorists."45 
The Discussions Continue 
While the Secretaries of State and Defense were 
opposing any relaxation of the arms boycott of Iran, 
Israel was receiving different signals from the NSC 
staff. Ledeen testified that McFarlane had authorized 
him to tell Prime Minister Peres that Israel could 
engage in a one-time arms sale to Iran of artillery 
shells or pieces, "but just that and nothing else."'" 
One of the Israeli participants reported to another 
Israeli participant, however, that the authorization 
conveyed by Ledeen from McFarlane was for a trans-
fer of TOW missiles.47 
By early June, the Israelis were considering a trans-
action linking the sale of TOWs to the release of the 
American hostages." However, the Israelis were un-
willing to proceed without evidence of a clear, ex-
press, and binding consent by the U.S. Government to 
the proposed transaction.49 
On June 19, Ghorbanifar, accompanied by Fur-
mark, met in Israel with the Israeli team. Ghorbanifar 
proposed that the Israelis sell 100 TOWs to Iran 
through him. He also agreed to set up a meeting with 
an Iranian officia1.5? 
The Israelis reported these developments to McFar-
lane. In late June, according to McFarlane's testimo-
ny, David Kimche, the Director General of the Israeli 
Foreign Ministry, became involved in the project. 
Kimche had an established relationship with McFar-
lane and Ledeen." While in Washington for another 
purpose in early July, he briefed McFarlane on the 
ongoing contacts of Israeli and Iranian officials, and 
the Iranians' interest in establishing contact with the 
United States.52 Kimche recommended that the dis-
cussions with the Iranians continue. McFarlane told 
Secretary Weinberger about the meeting, and Wein-
berger's military assistant, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, re-
called that McFarlane discussed both the sale of arms 
to Iran and the hostages." 
On July 8, 1985, members of the Israeli team met in 
Hamburg with Ghorbanifar, Khashoggi, Khashoggi's 
son-in-law, and the First Iranian. Before the meeting, 
Ghorbanifar told the Israelis that the sale of 100 
TOWs was essential to enhance his credibility with 
Iran, and claimed that the sale would be followed by 
the release of the American hostages.54 
166 
Ghorbanifar described the First Iranian as a politi-
cally powerful individual in his own right, with close 
personal connections to Khomeini, and a leader of 
one of Iran's revolutionary organizations.55 
At the meetings, the First Iranian spoke of the need 
for a party who could act as a bridge between Iran 
and the United States, of the threat of Soviet influ-
ence in Iran, and of the risks he had taken in meeting 
with Israel in order to promote an epening with the 
United States. The participants also discussed missiles 
and hostages." The First Iranian promised to present 
a comprehensive written proposal within a week. 
Shortly after that meeting, according to Ledeen's 
testimony, Schwimmer flew to Washington and met 
with Ledeen on July 11, 1985. He briefed Ledeen on 
Ghorbanifar's proposal to obtain the release of the 
American hostages in exchange for TOW missiles.57 
Ledeen then wrote McFarlane, "The situation [con-
cerning Iran] has fundamentally changed for the 
better."58 On July 13, he briefed McFarlane orally on 
the Israeli talks with the Iranians." 
After meeting with Ledeen, McFarlane cabled Sec-
retary Shultz with a summary of the proposal con-
veyed by Israel: 
The short term dimension concerns the seven 
hostages; the long term dimension involves the 
establishment of a private dialogue with Iranian 
officials on the broader relations. . . . They [the 
Iranians] sought specifically the delivery from 
Israel of 100 TOW missiles. 
McFarlane recommended to Shultz that the United 
States go forward with a tentative show of interest, 
although his admonition proved to be prophetic: 
Then one has to consider where this might lead 
in terms of our being asked to up the ante on 
more and more arms and where that could con-
ceivably lead. . . .61 
Shultz responded to the proposal with caution, rec-
ommending that "we should make a tentative show of 
interest without commitment." 62 
In the meantime, Israel awaited the United States' 
response on whether it was authorized to sell the 
TOWs. 
The President Is Informed 
McFarlane decided to take the matter to President 
Reagan, even though the President was in the hospital 
recuperating from surgery. By this time, the release of 
the hostages had become an immediate concern to the 
President. He had met with the hostage families for 
the first time in late June, and had been moved by the 
experience. On July 3, he had attended a National 
Security Planning Group meeting to discuss the hos-
tages, and had come away frustrated at the lack of 
alternatives.

Chapter 9 
McFarlane met with the President at the hospital 
on July 18. Donald Regan, the White House Chief of 
Staff, was present." What was discussed at this meet-
ing is not clear: Apparently no one took notes. Regan 
did not recall any mention of arms at the meeting,83? 
and McFarlane's accounts have varied: More than a 
year later, on November 21, 1986, McFarlane wrote 
in a PROF note to Poindexter that the President "was 
all for letting the Israelis do anything they wanted at 
the very first briefing in the hospital."'" But during 
the public hearings McFarlane stated that the Presi-
dent's position was that no U.S. owned items from the 
United [S]tates [could be] proper[ly] shipped at that 
time." This left open the possibility that the Israelis 
were free to ship from Israel Israeli-owned TOWs 
that had been acquired from the United States." 
McFarlane testified that the Israelis were informed 
that the President was unwilling to allow the United 
States to supply arms directly to Iran." Ledeen testi-
fied, however, that, in accordance with McFarlane's 
instructions, he informed the Israelis that the Presi-
dent approved "in principle" the sale of TOWs by 
Israel subject to further review of the details." 
But Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin would 
not proceed unless he received assurances that the 
Secretary of State knew of the plan and that the 
President unequivocally approved. The Israelis were 
concerned that the initiative could become public; and 
without specific American approval, Israel would be 
the target of criticism. In the meantime, the Israelis 
had received the First Iranian's written proposal, 
dated July 16, 1985, which was passed on to Ledeen. 
The proposal was general, promising a more concrete 
plan in the near future. It contained no commitment 
for the release of the hostages." 
The Israelis insisted on meeting with Ghorbanifar 
to secure a commitment for the release of the Ameri-
can hostages in return for the shipment of 100 
TOWs.7? The meeting took place in Israel on July 25. 
Ghorbanifar stressed the need for the 100 TOWs and, 
for the first time, mentioned spare parts for antiair-
craft missiles." He also said that the Iranians needed 
other weapons as well. Ghorbanifar stated that the 
weapons would not only strengthen his and the First 
Iranian's credibility in Iran, but also win the support 
of the military. The Israelis told Ghorbanifar that 
they could recommend that their government supply 
the missiles only if secrecy would be maintained and 
the hostages released. Ghorbanifar stated that within 
2 to 3 weeks of delivery of the missiles, the hostages 
would be released, although he warned that the Irani-
ans might want to keep a few of the hostages for 
leverage.72 On July 28, the Israelis briefed Ledeen on 
the meeting with Ghorbanifar, and on the Israeli deci-
sion not to proceed unless U.S. authorization was 
more unequivocal. Ledeen reportedly said the Israelis 
had already received sufficient authorization from the 
response that the President had given in the hospital. 
But the Israelis were insistent on confirmation." 
The Israeli Arms Sales Are Authorized 
On August 2, according to McFarlane's testimony, 
Kimche flew to Washington to meet with McFarlane 
and to obtain the specific U.S. position on Israel's sale 
of the TOWs. The meetings occurred on August 2 
and 3. McFarlane made no memorandum of the meet-
ings, and recollections differ. All agree, however, that 
the Israelis asked for permission to sell 100 TOWs, 
and that McFarlane agreed to present the issue to the 
President.74 
The White House log records an August 6 meeting 
between McFarlane and the President, the Vice Presi-
dent, Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger, and Regan. 
McFarlane reported that the Iranians wanted a dia-
logue with the United States and 100 TOWs from 
Israel in return for which four hostages would be 
released." McFarlane also said that the United States 
would be able to deny any connection to or knowl-
edge of the sale, a suggestion the Secretary of State 
regarded as untenable." Secretary Shultz told the 
President that it "was a very bad idea," and that 
despite the talk of better relations, "we were just 
falling into the arms-for-hostages business and we 
shouldn't do it." 7 7 
Secretary Weinberger also opposed the sale. He 
and Secretary Shultz argued that the initiative would 
not work, and that the sale would contradict the U.S. 
efforts to persuade other countries to observe the 
embargo.78 None of the witnesses recalls the Vice 
President's position, and there is no evidence that 
Casey was consulted by the NSC staff at this stage. 
McFarlane, according to Ledeen, directed that Casey 
and the CIA not be informed for fear that the CIA 
might leak.79 
Chief of Staff Regan testified that the President told 
McFarlane to "go slow" at the August meeting and 
to "make sure we know who we are dealing with 
before we get too far into this." 80 According to all 
the participants, the President announced no decision 
at the meeting. 
Several days later, the President telephoned McFar-
lane and, according to McFarlane, authorized the Is-
raelis to proceed with the sale in modest quantities of 
"TOW missiles or other military spares" that would 
be replenished by the United States. The President 
stipulated that the sales not affect the balance of the 
Iran-Iraq war, not be used for terrorist purposes, and 
not include such major items as aircraft.81 McFarlane 
told Poindexter about the conversation, but Poin-
dexter did not recall its contents.82 Regan recalled 
that the President appeared upset when he learned in 
September that TOWs had been shipped. 
The President, in his Tower Board interview, origi-
nally confirmed that he had authorized the sale, but 
later stated that he had no actual recollection one 
way or another." No documents record the decision.

Chapter 9 
The Tower Board concluded that the President 
most likely approved the Israeli sales before they oc-
curred. The evidence supports that conclusion. The 
Israelis expressly sought the President's approval of 
the Israeli sales and confirmation that the Secretary of 
State had been consulted. By McFarlane's own admis-
sion, he told the Israelis that they were authorized to 
sell the TOW5."4 McFarlane had no motive to ap-
prove a sale of missiles to Iran if the President had 
not authorized it. Moreover, Ledeen testified that 
McFarlane told him of the President's decision." 
McFarlane also contemporaneously reported the 
President's approval to Kimche." 
The President's decision on the arms sale conveyed 
by McFarlane to the Israelis committed the United 
States to the policy unsuccessfully advocated in the 
draft NSDD?the sale of weapons by an American 
ally to Iran. 
Preparations for the Delivery 
In early August, the Israelis began to make the 
necessary arrangements to obtain the 100 TOWs 
through the Israeli Ministry of Defense." Ghorbani-
far, in the meantime, was meeting with Khashoggi in 
Spain to arrange financing for the initial TOW pur-
chase. The Israeli Ministry of Defense was unwilling 
to supply. the TOWs until payment had been deposit-
ed. Iran, on the other hand, was unwilling to pay 
until the missiles were delivered. Ghorbanifar asked 
Khashoggi to "bridge" this gap by lending him $1 
million, which Ghorbanifar could then deposit with 
the Israelis and repay upon payment by Iran. Kha-
shoggi agreed." On August 7, Khashoggi ordered 
the transfer of $1 million into an Israeli intermediary's 
account." Back in Washington, McFarlane asked 
Ledeen to coordinate with the Israelis on the release 
of the hostages in Lebanon." 
Preparation for the TOW shipment continued in 
Israel. On August 12, the Israelis decided to deliver 
the TOWs to Iran by chartering a "neutral," non-
Israeli DC-8 aircraft. Still unresolved at this time, 
however, was the price to be charged by the Israelis 
to Ghorbanifar for the missiles and the price to be 
paid by them to the Israeli Ministry of Defense for 
the TOWs. After considerable bargaining, Ghorbani-
far agreed to pay $10,000 per missile, $2,000 less than 
he was receiving from the Iranian Government. 
The Israelis did not agree on the price the Ministry 
of Defense would receive until after the missiles were 
delivered to Iran. The Ministry of Defense wanted 
$12,000 per missile, which it calculated to be the 
replacement cost per missile. The Israeli intermediar-
ies maintained that they could only pay $6,000 per 
missile, because the remainder of what they received 
from Ghorbanifar was required for heavy shipping 
costs and other substantial expenses.9? The Ministry 
of Defense eventually received $3 million from an 
168 
Israeli intermediary for the 504 TOWs in March 
1986.9' 
Israel Ships 96 TOWs But No Hostage 
Is Released 
On August 19, Ghorbanifar returned to Israel 
where he met with the Israeli team. Ghorbanifar ad-
vised that he had made payments in Iran but he was 
not certain how many hostages would be released. As 
for CIA Station Chief Buckley, Ghorbanifar said that 
the Iranians recognized his "special value" and, there-
fore, would return him last.92 That same day, the 
DC-8 transport aircraft arrived in Israel, and was 
loaded with 96 (rather than 100) TOW missiles." In 
the early morning hours of August 20, the plane left 
Israel bound for Iran, with Ghorbanifar on board. 
The TOWs were then delivered and the aircraft re-
turned to Israel late that same day.94 
But no hostages were released. Ghorbanifar had an 
explanation: contrary to his plan, delivery of the mis-
siles was taken by the Commander of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guards rather than by the Iranian fac-
tion for whom they were intended.95 Still, Ghorbani-
far remained hopeful that he could produce the hos-
tages. With McFarlane's assent, Ledeen met with 
Kimche in London on August 20 to discuss ways to 
bring the hostages out of Lebanon." 
From London, Ledeen flew to California, where 
the President was vacationing, to brief McFarlane on 
his meeting with Kimche and to obtain McFarlane's 
authorization for a meeting in Europe with Ghorbani-
far and the Israelis.97 On August 22, McFarlane ap-
proved another trip to Europe for Ledeen." On 
August 30, McFarlane arranged for the State Depart-
ment to provide NSC staff member Oliver L. North 
with a passport in the name of William P. Goode for 
use in "a sensitive operation in Europe in connection 
with our hostages in Lebanon." 99 On August 27, the 
Government of Iran transferred $1,217,410 to Ghor-
banifar's Swiss account. On August 29, Ghorbanifar 
repaid Khashoggi the $1 million loaned by Khashoggi 
on August 7."0? Khashoggi told the Israelis that, be-
cause he had been repaid for the first loan, he would 
agree to loan $4 million to permit Ghorbanifar to 
purchase an additional 400 TOWs from the Israe-
lis.'" 
400 More TOWs for 1 Hostage 
On September 4 and 5, Ledeen met in Paris with 
Ghorbanifar and members of the Israeli team. Since 
no hostages had been released despite the delivery of 
the 96 TOWs on August 20, severe arguments oc-
curred at the meeting.'" Ghorbanifar indicated that 
one hostage would be released provided the Israelis 
sold Iran an additional 400 TOW missiles. We are 
satisfied from our review of all the evidence that the 
President was informed and approved of the transac-

Chapter 9 
tion in the hope that the hostages would be released. 
The second shipment was approved by Prime Minis-
ter Peres and Defense Minister Rabin on September 
9.103 On September 10, Khashoggi ordered the trans-
fer of $4 million into an Israeli intermediary's account 
to finance Ghorbanifar's purchase of the 400 
TOWs."4 The money reached the Israeli account on 
September 13 and Ghorbanifar repaid Khashoggi that 
$4 million the following day.'" 
The aircraft used to transport the second shipment 
of TOWs to Iran arrived in Israel on September 14. 
The DC-8 was loaded with 408 missiles (bringing the 
total of TOWs shipped to 504), and, early the next 
morning, it flew to Tabriz to make delivery. On 
board was Ghorbanifar's Iranian assistant, Mahadi 
Shahista. Tabriz, rather than Tehran, was used as the 
Iranian delivery point to prevent this shipment from 
falling into the hands of the Revolutionary 
Guards.1?6 
The Iranians made it clear that this was an arms-
for-one-hostage bargain. They gave McFarlane the 
choice of any hostage other than Buckley.'" Ghor-
banifar told the Israelis that Buckley was too ill to be 
released.'" In fact, Buckley had died in June of a 
pulmonary condition brought on by prolonged inter-
rogation, torture, and mistreatment. 
On September 15, American hostage Reverend 
Benjamin Weir was released near the U.S. Embassy in 
Beirut.1?9 
On September 17, the Israeli intermediary's account 
received an additional $290,000 from Ghorbanifar for 
the expense of transporting the 504 TOWs to Iran,' '? 
and on September 18, Iran transferred $5 million to 
Ghorbanifar's Swiss account for the additional TOWs. 
Despite the fact that all the TOWs were delivered, 
only one hostage had been produced, not the group 
that Ghorbanifar originally had promised. Still, the 
President continued to receive optimistic reports on 
the initiative. However, no other hostages were re-
leased for the 504 TOWs. 
NSC Staff Limits Distribution of 
Intelligence 
At the NSC, North was charged with making the 
necessary arrangements in the event that any hostages 
were released as the result of the September 15 TOW 
delivery. North had been briefed on the initiative ear-
lier."' 
On September 12, North contacted Director Casey 
for assistance in obtaining intelligence on Ghorbanifar 
(who was then using an alias) and the Second Iranian. 
Casey put North in touch with CIA's National Intelli-
gence Officer for Counter-Terrorism, Charles Allen, 
who arranged for intelligence support.'12 At McFar-
lane's instruction, North told Allen to distribute the 
intelligence only to McFarlane, Vice Admiral A. S. 
Moreau, Jr. of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Casey, and 
North."3 Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger were 
not to receive the intelligence. (Weinberger later 
found out about?and demanded?this intelligence.) 
Denied access to the intelligence, the State Depart-
ment was not told of the Israeli TOW shipment, was 
not advised of the linkage of Weir's release to arms 
shipments, and was not informed of the President's 
decision or the U.S. Government's involvement. 
Replenishment 
McFarlane assured the Israelis that the TOWs 
shipped to Iran would be replenished at a price to be 
determined. But, McFarlane emphasized, the linkage 
between the Israeli sale to Iran and the U.S. sale to 
Israel could not be obvious."4 
On September 19, Ledeen sent a message to 
McFarlane regarding replenishment of Israeli TOW 
stocks in September: "Issue of replacements: The 
people who sold the soap for us want to replenish 
their supply." "5 
The Initiative Continues: The Ante Is 
Upped 
Despite Ghorbanifar's failure to secure the release 
of the four or five hostages originally promised, dis-
cussions of further arms deals continued. In late Sep-
tember, Ghorbanifar met with members of the Israeli 
team and Ledeen in Paris. This time, Ghorbanifar 
asked for antiaircraft missiles, including a new 
HAWK missile to attack high-flying aircraft. (The 
HAWKs do not have that capability, but apparently 
none of the participants was aware of this.) Ledeen 
reportedly consented to a HAWK transaction with 
Iran, but demanded that the hostages be released."6 
Ledeen recalls that McFarlane approved the sale of 
HAWKs before November, but Ledeen could not 
recall when."7 Nor could he recall this Paris meet-
ing."8 
In the meantime, North had received information 
that another U.S. hostage, allegedly Buckley, would 
be released between October 3 and 5.1" However, 
the Islamic Jihad in Lebanon announced, on October 
3, that it planned to execute Buckley. North asked 
Ledeen to arrange for Ghorbanifar to come immedi-
ately to the United States to discuss the hostages. On 
October 8, Ghorbanifar arrived in Washington, ac-
companied by Schwimmer and Nimrodi, and met 
with Ledeen at the Old Executive Office Building.120 
At the meeting, Ledeen reportedly stated that the 
trading of arms for U.S. hostages was a bad idea that 
should be stopped. Ghorbanifar agreed."' Nonethe-
less, the Iranian continued to press for a variety of 
weapons for Iran.122 
At a subsequent meeting with North and McFar-
lane, Ledeen maintains that he again expressed his 
reluctance to be involved with this arms-for-hostages 
arrangement; preferring to pursue a strategic, not an 
arms, relationship with Iran.'" McFarlane, on the

Chapter 9 
other hand, has stated that Ledeen was the person 
who communicated the most outrageous arms propos-
als to him, and that he, McFarlane, is the one who 
was "consistently against arms-for-hostages." 124 
Ledeen kept his reports ora1,122 and there is no writ-
ten record from the fall of 1985 in which Ledeen or 
McFarlane protest arms sales. Whatever McFarlane's 
and Ledeen's own views may have been, arms were 
the currency for the Iran initiative, and McFarlane 
authorized Ledeen to go to Geneva in late October 
for a meeting that was to strike the deal for the Israeli 
HAWK shipment in November.126 
Meeting in Europe, October 1985 
According to Ledeen, the purpose of the late Octo-
ber meeting was not to strike an arms-for-hostages 
deal with the Iranians, but rather to approach the 
U.S.-Iranian initiative from the strategic, geopolitical 
perspective. Ledeen testified that he and the First 
Iranian discussed ways to improve U.S./Iranian rela-
tions without trading arms for hostages. In fact, 
Ledeen maintained that like himself, this Iranian was 
"vociferously opposed to what had been done in pro-
viding weapons to the Iranian regime over the course 
of the past couple of months, said that all we could 
achieve by sending arms to Iran was to strengthen the 
Khomeini regime, which was the opposite of what he 
thought we were about."27 It was Ledeen's belief 
that "so long as the Iranians are able to obtain weap-
ons from the United States as a result of [a] dialogue 
with us, they will say anything and they will do 
anything in order to continue to get these weapons, 
and so long as that pipeline of weapons functions, we 
will never be able to evaluate their real inten-
tions."128 
Ledeen stated that upon his return from Europe, he 
reported to McFarlane that the First Iranian thought 
he could have his people occupy "key positions in the 
170 
[Iranian] government" if the United States would help 
by providing a quantity of "small arms and training." 
By other accounts, however, such political discus-
sions are not all that transpired at the late October 
meeting. According to one of the Israeli intermediar-
ies, the Iranian official emphasized that efforts must 
be continued for the release of the four remaining 
hostages in exchange for arms, particularly HAWK 
missiles. Also according to the Israeli intermediary, 
Ledeen was pressing, on behalf of the U.S. President, 
for all four hostages to be released as soon as possible 
and all at once, and he promised that following their 
release the U.S. would assist Iran as far as it could.' 29 
This appears to have been the last meeting among 
Iranian, Israeli, and American representatives before 
the shipment of HAWK missiles to Iran in late No-
vember 1985. 
The Lessons of the First Arms 
Shipment 
The August-September 1985 TOW transaction set the 
pattern for the entire Iran initiative: 
?A promise by the Iranians to release the hostages in 
exchange for an agreed quantity of weapons. 
?The breach of that promise after delivery of the 
weapons. 
?The delivery of more weapons in response to new 
demands by the Iranians. 
?The release of a single hostage as an enticement to 
further arms transfers. 
The lesson to Iran was unmistakable: All U.S. posi-
tions and principles were negotiable, and breaches by 
Iran went unpunished. Whatever Iran did, the U.S. 
could be brought back to the arms bargaining table by 
the promise of another hostage.

48. Id In early June 1985, Khashoggi advised the Israelis 
that Khashoggi would deal directly with Ghorbanifar and 
the Israelis, to the exclusion of Hashemi. Israeli Historical 
Chronology. When, in June, Khashoggi excluded Hashemi, 
Hashemi reacted by trying to market Ghorbanifar to the 
CIA, through one of Director Casey's close friends, John 
Shaheen. 
On or about June 16, 1985, Shaheen called Casey and 
relayed a message from Hashemi offering to set up a meet-
ing in Europe with a high-ranking Iranian official to discuss 
Iran's interest in acquiring U.S. TOW missiles and Iran's 
ability to help obtain the release of American hostages held 
in Lebanon. Before talking to Casey, Shaheen had dismissed 
part of Hashemi's proposal, telling him, "no weapons, no 
Da'was." Casey Memo, 6/17/85, to CIA Chief of the Near 
East Division: Subj: Release of the Hostages, C 8965-66. 
Hashemi had tried to deal with Casey before without 
success. However, this time, Casey agreed to Shaheen's 
proposition, and directed the Chief of the Near East Divi-
sion of the CIA's Operations Directorate to pursue the 
matter. The State Department was told that Casey was 
"very anxious to move ahead on a proposal" for a meeting 
with an Iranian representative; but, as outlined in a memo-
randum to Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost, the 
proposal made no mention of any arms sales. By June 24, 
Armacost had approved a plan by which a meeting would 
be set up between foreign intermediaries and the Iranian 
contact to be produced by Hashemi. Richard Murphy

tact, S 3812-13.

Minister of Iran, and Manucher Ghorbanifar, described by 
Hashemi as a ranking Iranian intelligence officer. CIA

Arms to Iran: A Shipment of HAWKs 
Ends in Failure 
An Israeli-American plan to sell HAWK missiles to 
Iran in exchange for American hostages crystallized 
in November 1985. The plan?which grew out of the 
late October meeting in Geneva among Michael 
Ledeen and Iranian and Israeli officials and interme-
diaries?ultimately led to a shipment of 18 HAWK 
antiaircraft missiles by a CIA airplane from Israel to 
Tehran on November 24 and 25. As the plan evolved, 
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane had 
contacts with senior Israeli officials, brought aspects 
of the plan to the attention of the President, Chief of 
Staff Donald Regan, and the Secretary of State, and 
gave Oliver North increasing responsibility for over-
seeing the plan's implementation. The planning and 
execution of the operation did not proceed smoothly, 
and in the end, no hostages were released. 
Ledeen Brings Home a Plan 
NSC consultant Michael Ledeen returned to Wash-
ington from the Geneva meeting at the end of Octo-
ber 1985. He told North and McFarlane of the Na-
tional Security Council Staff of the proposal by Man-
ucher Ghorbanifar and the other Iranians that the 
United States provide specified missiles in return for 
the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon. On October 
30, 1985, Ledeen first met alone with North and then 
with both North and McFarlane.' In the first meet-
ing, Ledeen said that the "First Iranian," a highly 
placed Iranian official who acted as a go-between in 
the arms sales negotiations, "wants to be U.S. ally?
has support in Tehran." Ledeen spelled out the Irani-
ans' demands for securing the American hostages' 
freedom. He told North that, "to get hostages out," 
the Iranians wanted a "blanket order" of 150 HAWK 
missiles, 200 Sidewinder missiles, and 30 to 50 Phoe-
nix missiles. The proposal contemplated that the hos-
tages would be released in three groups, with separate 
arms deliveries to Iran to occur before the second and 
third releases. Ledeen raised the unresolved problem 
of U.S. replenishment of the 500 TOWs withdrawn 
from Israeli reserves and shipped to Iran in August 
and September 1985 prior to the release of hostage 
Benjamin Weir. Ledeen said Israeli Defense Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin was "complaining about" the United 
States' failure to make good on its promise to replace 
those items.2 
North and Ledeen met with McFarlane later that 
day to continue the discussion. Ledeen, claiming that 
improved U.S.-Iranian relations could follow an 
agreement, advocated cooperation with the Israelis 
"to bring out credible military and political leaders" 
in Iran. McFarlane expressed skepticism even about 
the existence of moderate elements in Iran, let alone 
their ability to come to power. Nevertheless, he did 
not oppose renewing arms shipments to Iran. McFar-
lane instructed North and Ledeen that "not one single 
item" of armaments should be shipped to Iran without 
the release of "live Americans."3 McFarlane, Deputy 
National Security Adviser John Poindexter, and other 
senior American officials often repeated this instruc-
tion over the next several months, but it was consist-
ently disregarded. 
Ledeen's meeting with the First Iranian in Geneva 
led to meetings between the Americans and Israelis in 
early November 1985. The Iranians had significantly 
increased their demands for weapons. Moreover, the 
Israelis still sought replenishment of the TO`,Vs they 
had sold to Iran. 
On November 8, David Kimche, the Director Gen-
eral of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, met in Washing-
ton with McFarlane, North, and Ledeen.4 This was 
one of a series of meetings that McFarlane had with 
Kimche in the fall of 1985.5 Ledeen arranged this 
session in the hope of keeping the Iran initiative 
moving: 
I asked Kimche to talk to McFarlane because I 
was convinced that McFarlane was getting ready 
to resign, and was in a bad psychological state 
and was planning to abandon the entire Iranian 
initiative. I urged to Kimche to talk to McFar-
lane to ask him, first, not to resign; and second, 
not to abandon the political initiative with regard 
to Iran.6 
North-Nir Dialogue Begins 
North and Amiram Nir, the Israeli Prime Minister's 
Adviser on Combatting Terrorism, met in Washington 
on November 14.7 Although they apparently did not 
discuss arms sales to Iran, they did set the foundation

Chapter 10 
for a variety of future Israeli-U.S. covert operations. 
North jotted notes indicating that this operation could 
require at least a million dollars a month "for near 
term and probably mid-term rqmts [requirements]." 
North's notes list several unanswered questions: 
? How to pay for 
? How to raise $ . . . 
? Use Israelis as conduit? 
? Go direct? 
? Have Israelis do all work w/U.S. pay? 
? Set up joint/Israeli cover op 8 
On November 19, North and Nir discussed two 
code-named covert operations, "T.H. 1," the one they 
had discussed on November 14, and "T.H. 2." North's 
notes reflect that the second operation would also 
require a source of "op[erational] funds."9 In mid-
November, North did not have answers to the fund-
ing question. But, according to North, within a few 
months, he and Nir had solved the problem: they 
would use the Iran arms sales profits." Planning for 
the privately funded joint covert activities began. 
McFarlane Briefs CIA 
On November 14, after a regular weekly meeting 
attended by Director of Central Intelligence William 
Casey, his deputy, John N. McMahon, and Poin-
dexter, McFarlane told Casey of "the Israeli plan to 
move arms to certain elements of the Iranian military 
who are prepared to overthrow the government." 
McMahon said McFarlane provided this information 
casually as the meeting was breaking up. Casey relat-
ed this information to McMahon on the drive back to 
Langley." McMahon recalled that this information 
left him with the impression that the NSC staff was 
merely monitoring an ongoing Israeli effort." 
McFarlane Gives Rabin the Go-Ahead 
The following day, Israeli Defense Minister Rabin 
met with McFarlane at the White House and told him 
that Israel was about to make another arms shipment 
to Iran and would need replenishment from the 
United States." Rabin wanted "to reconfirm that the 
President of the United States still endorsed this con-
cept of Israel negotiating these arms sales." McFar-
lane replied that the President's authorization for 
Israel to sell arms to Iran subject to replenishment by 
the United States was still in effect, and that this was 
"based upon recent questions and reaffirmation by the 
President that I had received."" Rabin also sought 
reassurance that the matter was indeed a joint project 
between the United States and Israel. McFarlane re-
plied that while the United States supported Israel's 
176 
activities, it was going along with Israel on this 
matter.'6 
Rabin raised the still unresolved question of the 
U.S. commitment to replenish the 504 TOW missiles 
sent to Iran in August and September. McFarlane 
replied that he was aware of the difficulties and that 
within two weeks he would be sending North to 
Israel to find a technical means of achieving the re-
placement. '7 
McFarlane Briefs the President 
McFarlane told the President about the developing 
plans for the HAWK transaction shortly before they 
left on November 17 for a summit meeting with 
Soviet leaders in Geneva. Regan, who was present, 
said it was: 
Must a momentary conversation, which was not 
a detailed briefing to the President, that there [is] 
something up between Israel and Iran. [McFar-
lane said] [i]t might lead to our getting some of 
our hostages out, and we were hopeful. . . .18 
McFarlane did not stress that what he and Rabin saw 
as Ghorbanifar's unreliability was adding to the risks 
of the operation. Instead, McFarlane merely made "a 
passing reference here or there" about these concerns, 
and did not discuss them at length with the President 
at the time." The President's reaction was "cross 
your fingers or hope for the best, and keep me in-
formed."26 
The November HAWK Shipment 
By the third week of November, the Israeli interme-
diaries and the Americans believed they had reached 
an agreement with Ghorbanifar on a plan that would 
gain release of all the hostages by Thanksgiving. The 
plan was, in essence, a straight swap: U.S.-made mis-
siles in Israeli stocks would be sold to Iran in ex-
change for American hostages. As the exchange date 
approached, many details remained unresolved. They 
were only hammered out in separate and frantic long-
distance negotiations among the Israeli intermediaries 
and Ghorbanifar, Ghorbanifar and his contacts in the 
Iranian Government, and Israeli Government officials 
and NSC officials. 
How Many Missiles? 
One critical component of the plan was unsettled 
until the eleventh hour?the number and type of mis-
siles that the Israelis would ship to Iran. As evidenced 
by their late October proposal, the Iranians wanted to 
purchase immediately hundreds of millions of dollars 
worth of sophisticated U.S.-made missile systems for 
use in their war with Iraq. The Israelis were con-
cerned about depleting their stocks. The Americans, 
who had not found a solution to the replenishment

Chapter 10 
requirements arising out of the August and September 
missile shipments, sought an agreement involving 
smaller quantities of missiles shipped over time. The 
middlemen in the transaction?Ghorbanifar and Al 
Schwimmer and Yaacov Nimrodi, Israeli arms dealers 
also involved in the negotiations?had substantial 
monetary incentives to negotiate a deal in which large 
quantities of weapons and money would change 
hands. 
By Sunday, November 17, the planners had decided 
on an initial shipment of 80 HAWK missiles.2' This 
shipment was to be just the start of a much larger, 
phased transaction. 
On November 18, North called Schwimmer, who 
was in direct contact with Ghorbanifar. They dis-
cussed a sale of 600 HAWKs to Iran in groups of 100 
spread out over the next 3 or 4 days. Schwimmer told 
North that the first shipment of 100 missiles had been 
"approved" in Tel Aviv and that it was to be fol-
lowed by the release of five "boxes," the code name 
for the American hostages.22 After the call, North 
wrote in his Notebook: "Schwimmer to P/U [pick up] 
HAWKs in U.S."23 That day, an Israeli official told 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres that the Americans 
were willing for 500 HAWK missiles to be supplied, 
but it was proposed that Israel supply 80 HAWKs.24 
There is other evidence of plans for a very large 
weapons shipment to Iran: In mid-November a Euro-
pean broker sought an air carrier to transport immedi-
ately 10 planeloads of armaments in long crates from 
the capital of Country 15 to Tehran.25 An airline 
owned by the CIA became aware of the shipment." 
This CIA airline proprietary learned that "[t]he cargo 
is declared to be medicine but is in reality ammunition 
etc." 27 When this same proprietary was called in 
about 10 days later by CIA officials to move HAWK 
missiles, the company's manager concluded that the 
cargo was the same as what the European broker had 
offered earlier.28 
By November 20, the plan?as reported by North 
to Poindexter?had moved away from one involving 
500 to 600 HAWKs toward one that included these 
components: First, 80 HAWKs from Israeli stocks 
were to be moved to Iran on Friday, November 22, 
on three planes spaced apart by 2 hour intervals. 
After the planes were launched, but before they 
landed in Iran, five American and possibly one 
French hostage would be released. After the hostages 
were freed, 40 more HAWKs would be moved to 
Iran. The United States would replenish Israel's 
stocks promptly by sale at a mutually agreed price." 
North's notes from the same day confirm that the 
initial delivery was to be 80 items, but indicate a key 
difference from what he had reported to Poindexter: 
the American hostages would not to be freed all at 
once in advance of the arrival of any HAWKs, but 
rather would be released sequentially after each ship-
ment. After referring to the total of 80 HAWKs, 
North wrote: 
?One 27-2 
27-3 
26-1 
6+1 French 3? 
This notation appears to mean that 2 hostages were to 
be released after a first shipment of 27 missiles, 3 
hostages were to be released after a second shipment 
of the same amount, and 1 hostage would be released 
after a third shipment of the remaining 26 items. In 
fact, within a few days, an initial load of HAWKs 
arrived in Tehran without any prior hostage release. 
McFarlane's instruction not to ship weapons with-
out the prior release of the hostages thus was not 
followed. From this point on, the Iranians would 
always insist on sequential delivery of weapons, fol-
lowed by the release of hostages. On November 20, 
North wrote in his notebook: "120 HAWKs = 1) 5 
Amcits, 2) Guarantee that no more." 31 
North's notes also suggest that although the initial 
shipment quantity had been reduced from 600 
HAWKs, additional arms shipments to Iran were con-
templated after the shipment of 120 HAWKs. Follow-
ing a description of the sequence of delivery for the 
first 80 HAWKs and the hostage releases, North 
wrote: "After-40 more HAWKs, 200 SW [Sidewind-
er] missiles, 1900 TOWs." 32 
McFarlane Puts North in Charge 
While McFarlane was at the Geneva summit with 
the President, North became immersed in the details 
of the HAWK transaction. North testified that he was 
"thrown into this on the night of November 17," in 
almost simultaneous telephone calls from Rabin and 
McFarlane.33 Rabin told North that the plan called 
for Israel to move 80 HAWK missiles by November 
20. He said that Israel was unwilling to commence the 
shipment without satisfactory arrangements for re-
plenishment by the United States.34 According to 
North's notes, McFarlane told North to solve Rabin's 
replenishment problem, and "to keep orders under 
$14M" each?the threshold figure for reporting for-
eign military sales to Congress." After the calls from 
McFarlane and Rabin, North "flew up immediately 
[to New York] to talk with Mr. Rabin." In New 
York, he met with officials of the Israeli Ministry of 
Defense Procurement Mission, who wanted to ar-
range replenishment sales to Israel of 508 TOWs and 
120 HAWK missiles.36 
The next day, North or Poindexter asked Lt. Gen. 
Colin Powell, then military assistant to Secretary of 
Defense Casper Weinberger, about the availability 
and price of HAWKs and TOWs, and the legality and 
method of transferring such missiles. The requester 
initially sought information on a proposed transfer of 
500 HAWKs, but, in accordance with the evolving 
plan, soon cut the number to 120. Powell understood

that the ultimate destination of the weapons would be 
Iran and that Israel was acting as an intermediary." 
After receiving this request, Powell contacted Noel 
Koch, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for International Security Affairs, who in turn 
asked Henry Gaffney, Director of Plans, Defense Se-
curity Assistance Agency (DSAA), to find out how 
many HAWKs were available for immediate transfer. 
DSAA is the entity within the Department of De-
fense that is primarily responsible for arms sales to 
other governments. Koch asked Gaffney to prepare a 
Point Paper examining the requirements for notifica-
tion of Congress and whether the ultimate destination 
of the weapons might be concealed.38 
Gaffney testified that he understood from his supe-
riors that the Point Paper should cast a negative view 
of the transaction to reflect Secretary Weinberger's 
presumed opposition to arms transfers to Iran." He 
completed his paper, entitled "HAWK Missiles for 
Iran," on November 22 or 23 and submitted it to 
Powell. Powell testified that he gave the paper to 
Secretary Weinberger,4? who did not, however, 
recall receiving it.4 
Gaffney's Point Paper included important informa-
tion about the price and availability of HAWKs: 164 
missiles were available for foreign sale at that time; 
the missiles cost the United States approximately 
$300,000 per unit; and replacement cost would be as 
much as $437,700 per unit. Transportation and admin-
istration charges would have to be added. Seventy-
nine of the missiles were available for immediate ship-
ment. This state of the inventory may be one reason 
why the number of HAWKs planned for immediate 
shipment from Israel to Iran?and therefore the 
number which the United States would have to quick-
ly replenish?was set at 80. Gaffney's Point Paper 
also described political drawbacks of a weapons trans-
fer to Iran.42 
Gaffney testified that under the Arms Export Con-
trol Act, Iran was not an eligible country for direct 
sales from the United States, and that, in his view, 
even if Iran were to become eligible, the contemplat-
ed sales of HAWKs could not be made directly or 
indirectly (through Israel or otherwise) unless the 
President notified Congress. In addition, Gaffney tes-
tified that if the transfer were to be made by Israel, 
U.S.-Israeli agreements require advance, written U.S. 
consent. U.S. law mandates that the President cannot 
give that consent without certain conditions being 
met in advance, including obtaining assurance from 
Iran that it would use the weapons only for self-
defense and would comply with U.S. restrictions on 
retransfer to another country. These were conditions 
that Iran could not or would not meet.43 
178 
McFarlane Informs the President and the 
Secretary of State 
While they were still in Geneva, McFarlane updat-
ed the President and Chief of Staff Donald Regan on 
the status of the HAWK shipment and the anticipated 
hostage release.44 McFarlane informed them that the 
Israelis were about to ship the weapons, and ex-
pressed hope" that the hostages would come out by 
the end of the week." McFarlane specifically told 
the President that Israel was about to deliver 80 
HAWK missiles to Iran via a warehouse in Country 
15, and that Israel wanted the United States to re-
place those missiles.47 
McFarlane testified that he simply told the Presi-
dent that the Israelis were about to act, but did not 
ask for specific approval: 
[T]he President provided the authority in early 
August for Israel to undertake, to sell arms to 
Iran, and to then come to the United States for 
replenishment, to buy new ones. That didn't re-
quire then the Israelis to come back to us on each 
occasion and get new approval.48 
The President asked McFarlane to arrange a meeting 
at which the President and his top advisers would 
review the initiative after the summit." 
At about the same time, McFarlane also told Secre-
tary of State George Shultz of the impending arms-
for-hostages swap." McFarlane called Secretary 
Shultz by secure phone "out of the blue, about a 
hostages release and arms sales to Iran." 51 McFar-
lane explained that Israel was about to ship 100 
HAWKs to Iran through Country 15, that the ship-
ment would occur only if the hostages were released, 
and that the United States would sell replacements to 
Israel." Secretary Shultz understood it as "a straight-
out arms-for-hostages deal." He expressed his opposi-
tion, and rebuked McFarlane for not informing him 
about it earlier: "I told him I hoped that the hostages 
would get out, but I was against it, and I was upset 
that he was telling me about it as it was just about to 
start so there was no way I could do anything about 
it." 53 When asked about Secretary Shultz' account, 
McFarlane testified: "I don't recall it that way." 54 
Even as McFarlane was filling in Shultz on the 
broad outline of the plan, his NSC subordinates took 
steps to keep the Department of State hierarchy in 
the dark about the complex diplomatic problems 
caused by the operation. For instance, Secretary 
Shultz was not told of the back-channel communica-
tions and actions of State Department officials, taken 
at the behest of CIA and NSC officials, to support the 
HAWK shipment.85 
North Recruits Secord 
As McFarlane had explained to the President and 
Secretary Shultz, the plan was to move 80 HAWKs

from Tel Aviv to the capital of Country 15, transfer 
them to other planes, and then ship them on to Iran. 
The planners chose this circuitous routing because 
direct flights from Israel to Iran would draw attention 
given the poor relations between Israel and Iran.56 
Because the cargo was arms, special clearances had to 
be obtained from the government of Country 15. As 
the pilot who ultimately flew the HAWKs to Iran 
stated: 
Everybody can fly [in Europe] without clear-
ances unless you have . . . sensitive stuff like 
arms aboard, and then you have to have diplo-
matic clearance.57 
A problem developed on November 18: The gov-
ernment of Country 15 was unwilling to grant the 
special clearances. On that day, North asked Richard 
Secord?his confederate in the covert operation sup-
porting the Contras?to fly to Country 15 to "see 
what he could do to straighten out the mess."58 
Secord said this was when he learned of the Iran arms 
initiative." North explained the secret operation to 
Secord, indicating that it had been sanctioned by the 
United States, that it had run into difficulties in Coun-
try 15, and that there was "quite a bit of urgency" to 
get Secord to go there. According to Secord, North 
"knew that we had?my organization had had exten-
sive deals with the armament [industry]" in Europe 
and "wondered if I could arrange for this transship-
ment."66 
The next day, North gave Secord a letter on White 
House stationery, signed by North "for" McFarlane, 
stating 
Your discrete [sic] assistance is again required in 
support of our national interests. At the earliest 
opportunity, please proceed to [the capital of 
Country 15] and other locations as necessary in 
order to arrange for the transfer of sensitive ma-
teriel being shipped from Israel. 
As in the past, you should exercise great caution 
that this activity does not become public knowl-
edge. You should ensure that only those whose 
discretion is guaranteed are involved." 
McFarlane testified he was not aware that North 
was providing this letter to Secord, and that his per-
mission was not sought to send it out." 
Secord arrived in Country 15 on November 20.63 
He and his associate Thomas Clines, who Secord said 
"had really been handling all of the matters for the 
Enterprise" in Europe, together started "to work the 
problem . . . through our colleagues in the armament 
industry . . .9964 
Million-Dollar Deposit to Lake Resources 
On November 18?the same day that he brought 
Secord into the deal?North began to arrange for a 
$1-million transfer from Israeli intermediaries to the 
account of Lake Resources,65 a Panamanian company 
controlled by Secord and referred to by North as 
"our Swiss Co[mpany]."66 Lake Resources and its 
account at Credit Suisse in Geneva had been estab-
lished by North and Secord in May 1985 "to receive 
monies in support of the covert operations."67 Prior 
to this deposit, which was made on November 20,68 
Secord and North had used the company exclusively 
for supporting the Contras. 
The purpose for this $1-million deposit is unclear. 
North and Secord testified that the payment was for 
chartering planes to move the 80 HAWKS to Iran." 
The Israeli Historical Chronology affirms this expla-
nation.70 North and Secord, however, were unable to 
explain why they were asking for transportation ex-
penses on November 18 when, according to Secord, 
his original assignment was only to help obtain land-
ing clearances for planes already chartered by 
Schwimmer.7' It was not until November 22, when 
Schwimmer's charter unexpectedly fell through, that 
Secord's role was expanded." At that time, the 
amount Secord expected to pay for chartering planes 
was less than $1 million.73 
Some evidence suggests that Secord made, or con-
templated making, expenditures in Country 15. One of 
the persons with whom Secord was working, an offi-
cer of a European arms company, reportedly attempt-
ed to bribe an official of the government of Country 
15 to obtain the necessary clearances,74 and there are 
references to Secord having spent substantial sums in 
Country 15.75 However, bank records do not show 
any such payments out of the Lake Resources ac-
count. 
Whatever the initial purpose of the deposit, the 
Committees have ascertained its use. Secord used ap-
proximately $150,000 to pay for air charters relating 
to the HAWK shipment, and the remaining $850,000 
was spent to support the Contras and to make profit 
distributions to Secord and his business associates, 
Albert Hakim and Thomas Clines.76 North testified 
that in early 1986 he told the Israelis that the money 
had been used "for the purpose of the Contras" and 
that they acquiesced.77 The first "diversion" to the 
Contras of money received in connection with the 
Iranian arms sales had occurred. 
Confusion in Country 15 
The plan to ship the HAWKs through Country 15 
faced collapse because the government there refused 
to grant the necessary clearances. Upon arriving in 
Country 15, Secord and his associates?the European 
businessman and Clines?tried to overcome this prob-
lem.78 All three were fully aware that the cargo to be 
moved was HAWK missiles." Because their efforts 
were outside normal diplomatic channels and in con-
tradiction to stated U.S. policy, they were not well-
received by the government of Country 
15.80

Chapter 10 
The European businessman may have tried to solve 
the problem even before Secord arrived. The Deputy 
Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy in Country 15 
recalled learning on November 23 that about one 
week earlier the European businessman had ap-
proached an official of Country 15 and offered what 
the official considered to be a bribe to assist in the 
transit of a shipment involving the United States, 
Israel, and Iran.8' If this approach occurred around 
November 16, as the evidence suggests, then it draws 
into question Secord's testimony that he was not 
brought in until November 18. 
On November 20, the European businessman called 
an official of Country 15's Foreign Ministry and ex-
pressed the hope that the Foreign Ministry would 
grant permission for two aircraft carrying weapons 
from Israel for Iran to transit the country. To the 
official, the businessman appeared to be "acting as a 
broker for the arms deal." The European businessman 
referred to an "American general," presumably 
Secord, involved in the undertaking. The foreign gov-
ernment was disturbed by the businessman's approach, 
and the next day another official asked the American 
Embassy for "information about this strange case." 
The Embassy, unaware that the U.S. Government 
supported this shipment of weapons to Iran, told the 
Foreign Ministry that the shipment was not author-
ized by the United States and was contrary to U.S. 
Government policy strongly opposing arms sales to 
Iran.8 2 
Contributing to the confusion of the government of 
Country 15 was another incident on November 21. 
"Anonymous people claiming to 'represent the Ameri-
can administration'" attempted to intercept the coun-
try's Foreign Minister and Prime Minister at the air-
port of the capital of Country 15 following their 
return from the European Economic Summit in Brus-
sels." A CIA cable reporting this incident stated that 
this approach, while unsuccessful, was "particularly 
upsetting" to the foreign government because it 
"aroused both attention and suspicion."84 
North Updates Poindexter 
As the operation faltered on November 20, North 
reported to Poindexter and portrayed a mission well 
under control. He made no mention of the obstacles 
faced in Country 15: 
The Israelis will deliver 80 Mod HAWKS to [the 
capital of Country 151 at noon on Friday 22 Nov. 
These 80 will be loaded aboard three chartered 
aircraft, owned by a proprietary which will take 
off at two hour intervals for Tabriz, [Iran]. The 
aircraft will file for overflight through the [cap-
ital of Country 16] FIR enroute to Tabriz [from 
Country 15]. Appropriate arrangements have 
been made with the proper. . . [Country 16] air 
control personnel. Once the aircraft have been 
launched, their departure will be confirmed by 
180 
Ashghari [a pseudonym for Ghorbanifar] who 
will call [the Second Iranian official] who will 
call [an Iranian in Damascus] who will direct 
[another Iranian in Beirut] to collect the five rpt 
five Amcits [American citizen hostages] from 
Hizballah and deliver them to the U.S. Embassy. 
There is also the possibility that they will hand 
over the French hostage who is very ill. 
There is a requirement for 40 additional weaps of 
the same nomenclature for a total requirement of 
120. $18M in payment for the first 80 has been 
deposited in the appropriate account. No acft will 
land in Tabriz until the AMCITS have been de-
livered to the embassy. The Iranians have also 
asked to order additional items in the future and 
have been told that they will be considered after 
this activity has succeeded. All transfer arrange-
ments have been made by Dick Secord, who 
deserves a medal for his extraordinary short 
notice efforts. 
Replenishment arrangements are being made 
through the MOD [Israeli Ministry of Defense] 
purchasing office in NYC. There is, to say the 
least, considerable anxiety that we will somehow 
delay on their plan to purchase 120 of these 
weapons in the next few days. IAW [in accord-
ance with] your instructions I have told their 
agent that we will sell them 120 items at a price 
that they can meet. I have further told them that 
we will make no effort to move on their purchase 
LOA [Letter of Offer and Acceptance] request 
until we have all five AMCITS safely delivered. 
In short, the pressure is on them." 
This PROF message is clear evidence that North in-
formed Poindexter in detail of the HAWK transac-
tion?including the involvement of Secord and the 
replenishment arrangements?well in advance of the 
shipment. 
North Asks the CIA for Assistance 
Secord and the European businessman were unable 
to budge the government of Country 15. With only 
hours left before an Israeli plane carrying 80 HAWKs 
was to depart for the capital of Country 15, North 
urgently sought assistance from McFarlane, the CIA, 
and the State Department. North called McFarlane 
on the evening of November 21; they discussed 
whether McFarlane should call Country 15's Prime 
Minister or Foreign Minister in the morning.88a 
Informed by Secord of the difficulties in Country 
15, North immediately asked CIA official Duane 
Clarridge to assist in obtaining clearances for the 
plane going there." Clarridge said Secord should 
contact the CIA Chief in Country 15, whose name 
North then relayed to Secord.87 At the same time, 
Clarridge sent "flash" cables instructing the CIA

Chapter 10 
Chief in Country 15 and his deputy to report immedi-
ately to the office for a "special assignment."88 
The next morning, November 22, Secord, using his 
Copp pseudonym, called the CIA Chief and said that 
he urgently needed clearance for an El Al charter 
flight scheduled to leave Tel Aviv in 20 minutes and 
fly to the capital of Country 15. Secord urged the 
CIA Chief to call an official of Country 15 and em-
phasize the urgency of obtaining the clearance. At 
this point, the CIA Chief suggested enlisting the help 
of the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy 
in Country 15.89 
North Brings State Into the Operation 
At about this time, North pressed to involve the 
U.S. Embassy directly in the efforts to obtain the 
clearances. North accurately told Robert B. Oakley, 
then Director of the Office of Counterterrorism and 
Emergency Planning at the Department of State, that 
Israel had encountered problems obtaining clearances 
in Country 15 for a transshipment of HAWK missiles 
for Iran. In contrast, North falsely told Oakley that 
he had learned of the shipment when "'one of his 
people' went to an arms warehouse [in Country 15] to 
obtain arms for the Nicaraguan Resistance, and 
learned that the Israelis had been obtaining arms from 
the same source for shipment to Iran." In any event, 
Oakley gave North permission to tell the Embassy in 
Country 15 that the State Department was "aware" of 
the unfolding operation and that the Embassy "could 
request clearances." 90 Thereafter, the CIA Chief was 
instructed to insure that if the Deputy Chief of Mis-
sion felt compelled to communicate with the State 
Department, he should use only the CIA channel." 
The NSC also involved Oakley and the State De-
partment in another capacity. On November 21, 
Oakley notified the CIA's counterrorism component 
that "information from the NSC indicated that one or 
more U.S. hostages would soon be released in Leba-
non." Oakley reported that a team was departing for 
Wiesbaden, West Germany, to await the arrival of the 
hostages. The team arrived in Wiesbaden the follow-
ing day, and remained there until November 27.92 
On November 22, Oakley reported to Secretary 
Shultz (who had returned from Geneva) and others at 
the State Department "that the hostages would be 
released that afternoon in exchange for 120 HAWKs 
at $250,000 each?worth $30 million in all." Secretary 
Shultz and his advisers, Deputy Secretary John C. 
Whitehead and Undersecretary Michael Armacost, 
shared their apprehension about the endeavor. The 
Secretary, who "regarded it as a $30 million weapons 
payoff," told his deputies: "Bud [McFarlane] says he's 
cleared with the President."93 
The next day, Secretary Shultz was told that no 
hostage had been released and that the deal had col-
lapsed.94 That was false. The operation was still 
being actively pursued, and the movement of 18 
HAWKs was yet to occur. 
Jumbo Jet Departs for Country 15 
Transit Point 
Although the clearance for landing in Country 15 
had not been authorized on the morning of November 
22, the El Al 747 carrying the 80 HAWK missiles 
was ordered to take off for that country's capital. As 
the plane neared its "go?no go point," frantic efforts 
were underway to change the country's government's 
position. Clarridge cabled the CIA Chief in Country 
15 and ordered him to "pull out all the stops" to 
solve the problem.95 Secord called an official in 
Country 15's foreign ministry, who said that the gov-
ernment had decided to withhold permission based 
upon the U.S. Embassy's previous statement that the 
United States did not concur in the shipment." 
Hoping to reverse this position, the Deputy Chief of 
Mission made hurried phone calls attempting to 
summon the Country 15 Foreign Minister out of a 
cabinet meeting; and Secord told the CIA Chief that 
"McFarlane was being pulled out of [a] meeting with 
[the] Pope" to call the Foreign Minister.97 
All these efforts were in vain. By early afternoon, 
Secord, who was in radio contact with the El Al 
plane,98 telephoned North and informed him that the 
government of Country 15 had refused permission. 
He said the aircraft had been ordered back to Tel 
Aviv.93 
North and Clarridge Bring in a CIA 
Airline 
Due to the delays, the El Al plane, which the 
Israelis had reserved for this operation for only a 
limited time, was no longer available.'" Clarridge, 
North, and Secord scrambled to find other ways to 
transport the HAWK missiles to Iran. Within hours, 
Clarridge met with the Chief of the CIA's air branch 
and told him "we [have] a very sensitive mission in 
the Middle East and we need a 747 aircraft right 
away." The branch chief could not locate such a 
large aircraft on short notice, but suggested that a 
CIA airline proprietary might be able to move the 
cargo.'" At 4 p.m. on November 22, an air branch 
official called the CIA project officer for the proprie-
tary, and asked whether its Boeing 707 cargo planes 
were available to move 80 pieces of "sensitive hi 
priority cargo" from Tel Aviv to the capital of Coun-
try 15. The project officer reported that at least one 
of the airline proprietary's planes was available.'" 
Clarridge's actions resulting in the involvement of 
the air proprietary were at North's request and with 
the authority of CIA Associate Deputy Director of 
Operations, Edward Juchniewicz. "3 Juchniewicz 
spoke with both Clarridge and North on November 
22, and told them he had no objection to giving

48 hours, Clarridge and CIA air branch personnel 
closely managed the proprietary's flight activities in 
support of this covert operation.'" Before the oper-
ation was over, the proprietary's project officer also 
became directly involved in coordinating matters.'" 
Clarridge Brings in Another CIA Chief 
Even as the problems in Country 15 remained unre-
solved, Clarridge, on the evening of November 22, 
moved to obtain clearances from another country, 
Country 16, for overflight rights into Iran.'" Clar-
ridge cabled the CIA Chief in Country 16 proposing 
that he ask Government authorities for "overflight 
clearances for three commercial DC-8 aircraft (or 
similar aircraft) flying on a chartered basis from 
[Country 15] to Tabriz and then retracing their 
route." Clarridge explained that this was "a National 
Security Council initiative and has the highest level of 
USG [United States Government] interest." The CIA 
Chief was to explain that "the purpose of the flight is 
humanitarian in nature and is in response to terrorist 
acts." Clarridge specifically instructed that the U.S. 
Ambassador to Country 16 "should not be in-
formed." 108 
Schwimmer's DC-8 Charter Falls Through 
On the evening of November 22, Schwimmer 
called North to say the charter of the DC-8s for the 
Country 15-to-Iran leg of the mission had fallen 
through. In a PROF note to Poindexter, North updat-
ed the situation as of 7:00 p.m.: 
Unbelievable as it may seem, I have just talked to 
Schwimmer, in TA [Tel Aviv,] who advises that 
they have released their DC-8s in spite of my call 
to DK [David Kimche] instructing that they be 
put on hold until we could iron out the clearance 
problem in [the capital of Country 15]. Schwim-
mer released them to save $ and now does not 
think that they can be re-chartered before 
Monday. ?9 
Within minutes of Schwimmer's call, North and 
Secord discussed a substitute method of transporting 
the missiles from Country 15 to Iran. Secord suggest-
ed that the European businessman's company try to 
find some planes."? North wrote to Poindexter that 
Secord would solve the problem by diverting a plane 
from the Contra operation to the Iran operation: 
Advised Copp of lack of p/u [pick up] A/C 
[aircraft]. He has advised that we can use one of 
our LAKE Resources A/C which was at [the 
capital of Country 15] to p/u a load of ammo for 
UNO [United Nicaraguan Opposition]. He will 
have the a/c repainted tonight and put into serv-
ice nit [no later than] noon Sat so that we can at 
182 
least get this thing moving. So help me I have 
never seen anything so screwed up in my life. 
Will meet with Calero tonite to advise that the 
ammo will be several days late in arriving. Too 
bad, this was to be our first direct flight to the 
resistance field . . . inside Nicaragua. The ammo 
was already palletized w/ parachutes attached. 
Maybe we can do it on Weds. or Thurs. 
More as it becomes available. One hell of an 
operation.1' 
In fact, it appears that Lake Resources had no planes 
at this time. Nevertheless, this PROF note reveals 
that North was beginning to meld the two operations 
he was overseeing and to recognize that the Lake 
Resources enterprise could operate in a variety of 
settings. 
Over the next 12 hours, Secord and others tried to 
hire a cargo carrier for the Country 15-to-Iran leg. 
They unsuccessfully sought to convince officials of a 
European national airline to take on the assign-
ment."3 By the morning of November 23, Secord 
had identified an aircraft to make the flight,"4 but 
this plane was never used. 
Clarridge's Office Becomes the 
Command Post 
By November 23, Clarridge's office at Langley had 
become the command post for coordinating the 
HAWK transport. North was there most of the 
day.115 Also present and assisting were the CIA air 
branch chief, an intelligence officer, and Charles E. 
Allen.'" Numerous problems with aircraft and flight 
clearances continued to crop up. As the situation de-
teriorated, Clarridge sent cables to the far-flung CIA 
stations involved, and North stayed in continuous 
contact with Secord in Country 15 and Schwimmer 
in Israel. 
Clarridge's superiors, specifically Juchniewicz and 
McMahon, were aware of at least some aspects of the 
activity being directed from Clarridge's office. Juch-
niewicz's office received all of the cables being sent to 
and from Clarridge on the operation."7 In a memo-
randum for the record written 2 weeks later, McMa-
hon stated: 
On Saturday, 23 November 1985, Ed Juch-
niewicz asked me if I was aware of all the activi-
ty transpiring on the effort to get the hostages 
out. He showed me a cable to [the capital of 
Country 15] asking that we pass a message to the 
[Deputy Chief of Mission] from the Deputy As-
sistant to the President for National Security Af-
fairs [Poindexter]. The message assured the 
[Deputy Chief of Mission] that only the Secre-
tary of State and Ambassador Oakley were aware 
of the operation. I told Juchniewicz that I was 
unaware of the specifics of the operation but due

to the sensitivity of the operation, it was appro-
priate that we pass correspondence between the 
NSC and the ambassadors overseas, but only 
communications, that we could not be involved 
without a Finding."8 
McMahon testified that he did not know then that the 
CIA's airline proprietary had been brought into the 
operation."9 
Allen also learned that day of the CIA role in the 
operation. North called him in the morning and asked 
him to deliver to Clarridge intelligence data on the 
Iran initiative. Allen showed the materials to Clar-
ridge, who told him that North "had requested some 
assistance in obtaining a name of a reliable charter 
airline," that he was considering using the Agency's 
airline proprietary, and that he was trying to obtain 
landing and transit clearances in Country 15.120 
The Oil-Drilling Equipment Cover Story 
During the planning of the HAWK missile ship-
ment, the Israeli and American participants agreed to 
keep the true nature of the operation secret. They 
would use a false "story line" that the cargo to Iran 
was oil-drilling equipment."' Several American offi-
cials who knew of the operation were advised of this 
cover story but understood that it was false and knew 
that the cargo was missiles. 
At the time, the President and Regan knew that the 
cargo comprised HAWK missiles and were specifical-
ly told of the false story before the shipment was 
made, presumably by McFarlane. Regan testified: "I 
recall that that was to have been a cover story if 
discovered, it was to have been said that these were 
oil-drilling parts. 
9'122 
The government of Country 15 also was aware that 
the clearances being sought by Secord and others 
were for moving missiles through its capital and into 
Iran as part of an effort to gain the release of Ameri-
can hostages. Secord understood that both the Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister were informed. Indeed, 
Secord testified that it was not possible to ship 
HAWKs through the foreign capital without the host 
country knowing, because special handling of the 
weapons was required at the airport."3 
North claims he used the cover story when he 
brought Clarridge and Allen into the operation. As he 
later testified, "I lied to the CIA because that was the 
convention that we had worked out with the Israelis, 
that no one else was to know."124 Allen testified that 
North "stated emphatically" that the cargo was oil-
drilling equipment, but that he (Allen) had "serious 
doubts" about whether this was true."3 
If Clarridge did not know the contents of the cargo 
at the start, he soon learned it. In Country 15, late in 
the morning of November 23, Secord gave the CIA 
Chief a full accounting of the mission. Their meeting 
occurred in a car in a hotel parking lot. Secord re-
vealed his identity, explained he was formally associ-
ated with the NSC, and specifically told the officer 
that the planned flight would contain HAWK missiles 
being sent to Iran in exchange for hostages.'26 
The CIA Chief testified that he returned to his 
office and sent two cables to Clarridge through the 
"Eyes Only" privacy channel he was using on the 
HAWK project. The first cable contained a general 
report, mentioning the discussion with Secord but not 
setting forth the substance of the conversation.127 
The second cable reported that the flights would con-
tain HAWK missiles sent to secure the release of the 
hostages.128 The Committees' investigation did not 
locate this cable. But the CIA Chiefs subsequent tes-
timony about its existence was corroborated in testi-
mony by the CIA Deputy Chief '29 and by the 
Deputy Chief of Mission?who at the time either read 
the cable or was told about it by the CIA Chief.13? 
In addition, the CIA communicator, who transmitted 
the cable from Country 15, vividly recalls being 
shocked when he read the message and learned that 
the United States was sending arms to Iran."' 
Clarridge received additional information that re-
vealed that the cargo was HAWKs: North testified 
that shortly after the shipment occurred, if not before, 
he had told Clarridge the true nature of the cargo.132 
Moreover, on November 23, Allen showed Clarridge 
a report that, according to Allen, would cause "one 
[to] think that this initiative had involved arms in the 
past."33 Allen suspected that the November ship-
ment also involved arms and "couldn't help but be-
lieve that [Clarridge] suspected that. Particularly he 
could see the [report] as clearly as I, and he leafed 
through [its contents] . . . I left the folder with him 
and then picked it up later."34 After the shipment, 
Clarridge received additional information that made 
clear that the cargo was missiles."5 
Clarridge insisted in testimony before these Com-
mittees that he had no recollection of having learned 
that the cargo was missiles prior to early 1986.136 
This testimony conformed to the false story certain 
Administration officials put out in November 1986 
when they were trying to conceal the advance knowl-
edge in the U.S. Government of the shipment of 
HAWK missiles. 
The Committees are troubled by the fact that the 
cable informing Clarridge of Secord's detailed ac-
count of the operation, and an earlier cable Clarridge 
sent to the CIA Chief at the outset of the oper-
ation,'" are inexplicably missing from an otherwise 
complete set of 78 cables sent by CIA officials during 
the operation.138 
Country 15 Routing is Abandoned 
By the afternoon of November 23, the plan to 
transship the missiles through Country 15 was aban-
doned. The previous evening, McFarlane had called 
the country's Foreign Minister and believed he had 
received a "green light" for the flights."9 However,

Chapter 10 
the foreign government still insisted that the United 
States provide a diplomatic note setting forth the 
nature of the cargo and the shipping route, and stat-
ing that the release of American hostages was the 
purpose of the shipment.'" The foreign government 
wanted this documentation because it saw the oper-
ation as "so directly in conflict with known U.S. 
policy and [its own] policy."141 The American plan-
ners balked,'" apparently out of a concern about 
creating a formal paper record of the true nature of 
the operation. Later that day, the Deputy Chief of 
Mission, on instructions from Poindexter, handed the 
Foreign Minister a terse diplomatic note stating that 
the U.S. Embassy "expresses regret that the Govern-
ment of [Country 15] was unable to fulfill the request 
of the Government of the United States for the hu-
manitarian mission."43 Clarridge cabled the CIA 
Chief in the capital of Country 15 that in light of the 
diplomatic message, "it is obvious . . . that we are 
closing down [the Country 15] aspect of this oper-
ation.9,144 
As the Country 15 transit plan was falling through, 
North and Clarridge sought a substitute transit point. 
Clarridge cabled the CIA Chief in the capital of an-
other country, Country 18, to request assistance in 
obtaining landing rights in that country for "5 sorties" 
by a CIA airline proprietary 707 airplane between Tel 
Aviv and Tabriz, the first to occur "in the next 12 
hours or so . . . and likely result in the release of the 
hostages."145 
Meanwhile, still on November 23, Israeli military 
personnel began to load the HAWKs into the CIA 
proprietary airplane at the Tel Aviv airport. If they 
had not already been told, the proprietary's crew sur-
mised from the appearance of the crates that their 
cargo was missiles and reported this to the airline 
manager.146 
Later that day, the participants decided to move 
the shipment directly from Tel Aviv to Iran, without 
transiting a third country. Under the new plan, one of 
the proprietary's planes would make a series of flights 
to move the 80 HAWKs.147 After dismissing one 
route, the planners selected a shorter?but more dan-
gerous?route across Country 16.148 But obtaining 
overflight clearances from Country 16 remained a 
problem, so Clarridge once again cabled the CIA 
Chief there.'" Several hours later, the CIA Chief 
replied that the Government of Country 16 was sup-
portive, but needed "some idea of what the aircraft 
would carry as presumably they would not be 
empty."'" Late that night, Clarridge sent two more 
increasingly urgent cables to the CIA Chief in Coun-
try 16. In conformity with the cover story, these 
cables told the CIA Chief to advise the government 
of Country 16 that "the aircraft are carrying sophisti-
cated spare parts for the oil industry" and that the 
five flights would be spread over a number of 
days.151 
184 
North and Clarridge, working with Schwimmer, 
continued to coordinate the flight activity on Sunday, 
November 24. At the last minute, they decided that, 
at least on the first sortie, the plane should land at a 
transit point in another country, Country 17, to dis-
guise the fact that the shipment was moving from 
Israel to Iran.152 While this decision was being made, 
the CIA Chief in Country 16 informed Clarridge that 
the government there had approved the five over-
flights, but that "incoming flight cannot come directly 
from [Country 17]."153 
CIA Airline Proprietary Moves the 
Missiles 
On November 24, the CIA proprietary aircraft car-
rying 18 HAWK missiles flew from Tel Aviv to the 
transit point in Country 17. Because Schwimmer had 
sent the plane without a cargo manifest, the pilot 
lacked the documentation required by customs offi-
cials at the transit point, who wanted to inspect the 
cargo.'" Simultaneously, Schwimmer and the propri-
etary manager, along with North and Clarridge, fran-
tically discussed how to solve this. While there is 
evidence to the contrary, it seems the pilot simply 
talked his way out of the problem.155 
After getting out of the transit point in Country 17, 
the pilot ran into trouble while flying over Country 
16. According to the airline manager's report, 
nothing was prepared for overflight in [Country 
16] and [the pilot] had again to talk his way 
through. Since they [the Country 16 ground con-
trollers] repeatedly insisted on a diplomatic clear-
ance number, he made one up which was not 
accepted after long negotiations and then he fili-
bustered one hour and 30 min his way through 
[Country 16], using different altitudes, positions 
and estimates that he told [Country 16's] Military 
with whom he was obviously in radio con-
tact . . . 
However, radar realized his off-positions which 
gave additional reason for arguments and time 
delays.'56 
Cables the next day from the CIA Chief in Country 
16 to Clarridge suggested several reasons why the 
pilot encountered these difficulties. For example, the 
destination of the plane was changed at the last 
minute from Tabriz to Tehran, which "provoked 
query" from Country 16 because it did not square 
with the clearance request.'" Other discrepancies 
caused outright anger: 
[An official of Country 16 was] quite upset over 
multiple flight plans received, fact first flight 
came directly from [the transit point in Country 
17] and did not request clearance beforehand and 
conflicting stories about plane's cargo. [The CIA

Chapter 10 
Chief] told [the official] it was oil industry spare 
parts, telex from carrier stated medical supplies 
and the pilot told ground controllers he was car-
rying military equipment. . . . 
Bottom line is that [the government of Country 
16] still wants to assist but has developed a little 
cynicism about our interaction with them on the 
matter.'" 
Ironically, the pilot reportedly told the flight control-
lers the true nature of the cargo even while Clarridge 
was spreading the cover story to high level officials 
of Country 16.169 
The only part of the operation that went smoothly 
was the flight into Tehran. The Second Iranian Offi-
cial and Ghorbanifar, who were in Geneva, passed 
word to officials in Tehran to prepare to receive the 
plane. The plane landed in Tehran early in the morn-
ing.160 After an encounter with a military officer 
who apparently was unaware of the operation, "a 
civilian with a submachine gun on his back" arrived 
at the aircraft."' The pilot understood that this 
person was a member of the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard. He instructed the pilot not to disclose to 
anyone at the airport that the flight had originated in 
Israel, arranged for the unloading of the plane by 
military personnel, and got the crew to a hotel?
formerly the Sheraton?in downtown Tehran.162 
Fourteen hours later, after a warm send-off that 
included caviar, the plane departed Tehran at 12:15 
p.m. E.S.T., on Monday, November 25.163 The air-
line proprietary crew expected they would return 
shortly with more missiles and told the Iranian at the 
airport, "Don't worry, we [will] come back.99164 
However, the airline manager radioed them after they 
were airborne and instructed them not to return to 
Israel.162 Problems surfacing in both Washington and 
Iran put an end to the CIA proprietary airline's role. 
Within a few days, Secord, using funds from the Lake 
Resources account, wired a $127,700 payment to the 
proprietary.166 
Aftermath of the HAWK Flight 
The Failure Sinks In 
On November 25, with the Americans still enter-
taining the hope that one or more hostages might be 
released, senior White House and CIA officials were 
informed about the weekend's activities. Poindexter 
told the President at his regular 9:30 a.m. briefing that 
a shipment of arms to Iran had just taken place.'" 
At 7 a.m. that morning at CIA headquarters, 
Edward Juchniewicz told McMahon that Secord and 
"those guys" at the NSC had "used our proprietary 
to send over some oil supplies" to Iran. McMahon's 
reaction was anger: 
I said goddam it, I told you not to get involved. 
And he [Juchniewicz] said, we're not involved. 
They came to us and we said no. And they asked 
if we knew the name of a secure airline and we 
gave them the name of our proprietary. I said, 
for Christ's sake, we can't do that without a 
Finding.168 
McMahon said that at the time he accepted Juch-
niewicz's report that the cargo had been oil-drilling 
equipment: "[M]y focus was that we had done some-
thing wrong . . . and I didn't care what was on that 
airplane." McMahon's view was that any use of the 
CIA airline proprietary at the direction of CIA but 
without a Presidential Finding was illegal.' 68a 
Shortly after talking to Juchniewicz, McMahon 
went to Deputy Director for Operations Clair 
George's office where several staffers were discussing 
the weekend's activities. McMahon told them "that 
they weren't going to do anything more until we got 
a Finding."169 That same morning, North sent word 
to Schwimmer that the operation was to be put on 
hold.179 
McMahon also moved quickly to contact CIA Gen-
eral Counsel Stanley Sporkin on the matter of the 
airline proprietary's activity." McMahon testified 
that "during the day I called Sporkin several times 
and I told him that I wanted a Finding and I wanted 
it retroactive to cover that flight."172 Sporkin re-
called that McMahon simply asked him to look into 
the legal aspects of the activity, but did not declare 
that a Finding was necessary.'" 
Late in the day, two officers from the Operations 
Directorate, an air branch officer and his group chief, 
were directed to brief Sporkin on the proprietary's 
flight.'" The CIA officials most involved in the op-
eration?Clarridge, Allen, and the chief of the air 
branch?were not selected to do the briefing. At 
Sporkin's request, his deputy, J. Edwin Dietel, sat in 
on the briefing.175 
The participants' accounts of the briefing of Spor-
kin differed significantly. The air branch subordinate 
officer said that the meeting lasted about 45 minutes 
and that he and his superior explained to the lawyers 
that the airline proprietary?acting at the direction of 
the NSC staff and with the approval of Juch-
niewicz?had moved some cargo from Israel to Iran. 
He testified that as of November 25, he knew nothing 
about the cargo other than its weight and dimensions 
and that that was the only information about the 
cargo that was discussed at the briefing. He recalled 
that the lawyers exhibited no curiosity about the 
nature of the cargo and that there was no mention 
that the cargo was either oil-drilling equipment or 
military equipment. He also testified that nothing was 
said to indicate that the proprietary's flight was relat-
ed to an effort to free hostages.176

Chapter 10 
The CIA group chief said he did not even know of 
the activity being scrutinized until that morning. He 
stated in an interview that he and the subordinate 
explained that a CIA proprietary plane, acting in a 
strictly commercial capacity, had carried "commercial 
cargo" into Iran. The subject- of weapons being 
aboard the plane did not arise, he said. He added that 
at this point he understood that the cargo might have 
been farm equipment and that the shipment was not 
part of an NSC staff operation. '77 
Notwithstanding these divergent accounts from of-
ficials of the Operations Directorate, it is clear that 
the briefers told Sporkin that missiles had been trans-
ported, and the shipment was part of an effort to free 
the hostages. Sporkin testified: "What they told me 
indicated an involvement in a shipment of arms to 
Iran."78 Sporkin's deputy, Deitel, specifically re-
called that the briefers said the cargo was missiles.'79 
Sporkin testified that the briefers probably specified 
the exact type of missiles being shipped.'" 
During the briefing, Sporkin tentatively concluded 
that a covert action Finding was necessary to author-
ize the previous activity."' He stated that there 
should be no more flights to move the rest of the 
cargo in Israel until the matter could be looked into 
further.'82 After the briefers left, two senior staff 
attorneys, whom Sporkin had enlisted earlier and who 
were waiting for the briefing to end, were called into 
the room. Sporkin related to them that a shipment of 
"military equipment or missiles" from Israel to Iran 
had just occurred and that more flights were contem-
plated.' 8 3 ? 
Sporkin then dictated a draft Finding that author-
ized the CIA to assist in "efforts being made by 
private parties" to obtain the release of hostages 
through the provision of "certain foreign materiel and 
munitions" to the Government of Iran. The draft 
stated that Congress would not be notified of the 
operation "until such time as [the President] may 
direct otherwise" and that the Finding "ratifies all 
actions taken by U.S. Government officials in further-
ance of this effort."84 Sporkin directed one of the 
lawyers, Bernard Makowka, to stay late and work on 
the Finding.'85 Later that night, Sporkin informed 
McMahon "that a Finding would be required, not so 
much from the airlift standpoint, but from our in-
volvement in influencing foreign government officials 
to assist the mission."86 Sporkin aryl his deputies met 
on the morning of November 26, and worked up a 
final draft of the Finding.'" In its entirety, the Find-
ing stated: 
Finding Pursuant to Section 662 of The Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, As Amended, Concerning 
Operations Undertaken by the Central Intelligence 
Agency in Foreign Countries, Other Than Those 
Intended Solely for the Purpose of Intelligence Col-
lection. 
186 
I have been briefed on the efforts being made by 
private parties to obtain the release of Americans 
held hostage in the Middle East, and hereby find 
that the following operations in foreign countries 
(including all support necessary to such oper-
ations) are important to the national security of 
the United States. Because of the extreme sensi-
tivity of these operations, in the exercise of the 
President's constitutional authorities, I direct the 
Director of Central Intelligence not to brief the 
Congress of the United States, as provided for in 
Section 501 of the National Security Act of 1947, 
as amended, until such time as I may direct oth-
erwise. 
SCOPE: Hostage Rescue?Middle East 
DESCRIPTION 
The provision of assistance by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency to private parties in their attempt 
to obtain the release of Americans held hostage 
in the Middle East. Such assistance is to include 
the provision of transportation, communications, 
and other necessary support. As part of these 
efforts certain foreign materiel and munitions 
may be provided to the Government of Iran 
which is taking steps to facilitate the release of 
the American hostages. 
All prior actions taken by U.S. Government offi-
cials in furtherance of this effort are hereby rati-
fied.188 
The draft Finding referred to no objective of opening 
a diplomatic channel with Iran. Yet, this was the 
justification for the arms deals that the Administration 
offered after they were exposed in November 1986. 
Rather, the Finding depicted a straight swap of arms 
for hostages. 
Sporkin sent the proposed Finding to Casey on 
November 26.189 That morning, Clair George 
phoned North to tell him that Sporkin had deter-
mined a Finding was necessary.'" Later that day, 
after Casey called McFarlane and Regan "to ascertain 
that indeed this had Presidential approval and to get 
assurances that a Finding would be so signed," Casey, 
who agreed a Finding was needed,'" delivered the 
text to Poindexter.192 Poindexter did not immediately 
present it to the President. Over the next several days, 
Casey, McMahon, and George made repeated inquir-
ies to Poindexter and other "NSC personnel" and 
"continuously receive[d] reassurances of the Presi-
dent's intent to sign the Finding."93 
The President Renews His Approval 
On the day the CIA sent the proposed Finding to 
the White House, November 26, the President author-
ized continuing the arms-for-hostages transaction.'"

North's notes indicate that he was so informed by 
Poindexter at an hour-long meeting: 
0940-1050. Mtg w/JMP. RR directed op[eration] 
to proceed. If Israelis want to provide diff model, 
then we will replenish. We will exercise mgt 
over movmt if yr side cannot do. Must have one 
of our people in on all activities.195 
Later that day, North related to an Israeli official 
that the Americans wanted to carry on even if the 
supply of additional arms was needed and even if the 
weapons had to come from the United States."6 But 
events not within the control of the American side 
prevented immediate progress in accord with the re-
newed authorization of the President. 
The Iranians Feel Cheated 
After midnight on November 26, Allen learned that 
officials in Iran were upset that the wrong model of 
HAWKs had been delivered.'" The Iranians also 
complained through Ghorbanifar that the missiles had 
Israeli markings, which "the Iranians took to be a 
prov[o]cation." '98 
On November 25 or 26, Ghorbanifar, "on the very 
edge of hysteria," called NSC consultant Michael 
Ledeen, and said "the most horrible thing had hap-
pened. . . . [T]hese missiles had arrived and they were 
the wrong missile."199 Ghorbanifar gave Ledeen an 
urgent message from the Prime Minister of Iran for 
President Reagan: "We have done everything we said 
we were going to do, and you are now cheating us, 
and you must act quickly to remedy this situation." 
Ledeen conveyed this to Poindexter.20? 
At this point, North dispatched Secord to Israel. 
During meetings with Kimche and Schwimmer, 
Secord quickly deduced the source of Iran's displeas-
ure: according to him, Schwimmer and Nimrodi had 
promised Ghorbanifar that the missiles being provided 
could shoot down high-flying Soviet reconnaissance 
planes and Iraqi bombers. The I-HAWK missiles that 
were provided, like all HAWKs, had no such capabil-
ity.2" The Iranians were insisting that "these embar-
rassing missiles" be removed from Tehran.202 
Money Flows Back and Forth 
In advance of the HAWK shipment, on November 
22, Iran made two transfers?one of $24.72 million, 
the other of $20 million?to bank accounts in Switzer-
land to which Ghorbanifar had access.203 Iran appar-
ently understood that the larger transfer was its pur-
chase price for 80 HAWKs, at a unit cost of approxi-
mately 
$300,000.204 
On November 22, Ghorbanifar transferred to an 
Israeli intermediary's account $18 million and $6 mil-
lion.205 According to an Israeli intermediary, the $18 
million was the purchase price paid by Ghorbanifar 
for 80 HAWKs and the $6 million was to be held in 
trust by the Israeli intermediary at Ghorbanifar's re-
quest. Later, it was to be paid back to Ghorbanifar, 
with Ghorbanifar intending to keep $1 million for 
himself and use the remainder for payments to certain 
Iranians.206 North was aware of the $18 million de-
posit. On November 20, he wrote in his notebook: 
"18M Deposited Covers 80H 225K." 207 
Around the time that the Israeli intermediary re-
ceived these funds from Ghorbanifar, he transferred 
$1 million to Lake Resources on North's demand.208 
On November 22, the Israeli intermediary paid the 
Israeli Ministry of Defense $11.2 million for the 80 
HAWKs at a price of $140,000 per missile.209 Thus, 
the Israeli intermediary had received from Ghorbani-
far $11.8 million more than his total payments to 
Israel and Lake Resources. According to the Israeli 
intermediary as reported in the Israeli Financial Chro-
nology, $6 million of this residual was held in trust by 
the Israeli intermediary for Ghorbanifar and the re-
maining $5.8 million was to cover shipping and other 
expenses for the rest of the operation.2" The Chro-
nology indicates that Ledeen and North agreed with 
the Israeli intermediary that this money be kept in the 
Israeli intermediary's account for these purposes.211 
Israel intended to purchase replacement HAWKs 
with the sum received from the Israeli intermediary. 
It was doubtful whether the amount received?
$140,000 per missile?would be enough to purchase 
replacements at standard U.S. prices. On November 
19, North and the head of the Israeli Procurement 
Mission in New York discussed replenishment, and 
North's notes of the conversation refer to a price of 
"$220K/230K each for Hawks." 212 However, Poin-
dexter had instructed North, and North had told the 
Israelis, "that we will sell them [Israel]" replacement 
HAWKs "at a price that they can meet." 213 
When the HAWK deal collapsed in late November, 
the Israelis and Ghorbanifar reversed the flow of 
funds. On November 27, the Israeli Ministry of De-
fense returned $8.17 million to the Israeli interme-
diary. This was $3.03 million less than the Israelis had 
paid to the Ministry of Defense. The difference, ac-
cording to the Israeli Chronology, represented the 
prorated charge for the 18 missiles delivered to Iran 
at $140,000 per item and a deduction of $510,000 for 
expenses incurred by the Ministry of Defense in the 
HAWK transaction and in previous transactions.2" 
Also on November 27, the Israeli intermediary 
transferred to Ghorbanifar the sum of $18.6 million. 
This represented a prorated refund of Iran's purchase 
price for the 62 HAWKs that had not been deliv-
ered.2" Thus, at the end of November 1985, the 
Israelis held more than $5 million in residuals from 
the failed transaction, most of which was repaid to 
Ghorbanifar by the Israeli intermediary and to the 
Israeli Ministry of Defense after Iran returned 17 
HAWKs to Israel in early 1986.2"

Chapter 10 
Conclusion 
The shipment of HAWKs to Iran was bad policy, 
badly planned and badly executed. In contradiction to 
its frequently emphasized public policy concerning 
the Iran-Iraq war and nations that support terrorism, 
the United States had approved the sale of arms to 
Iran. The United States had agreed to a sequential 
release of hostages following successive deliveries of 
weapons; thereafter, this departure from policy 
became the norm. This precedent, established in No-
vember 1985, gave the Iranians reason to believe that 
the United States would retreat in the future from its 
demand for the release of hostages prior to any weap-
ons shipments. 
188 
The planning and execution of the operation were 
also flawed. By the time the U.S. Government 
became directly involved, official disclaimers by un-
witting State Department officials had already com-
plicated the foreign relations aspect of the project. 
And the mission itself jeopardized the security of the 
CIA airline proprietary's operation.21 7 
Finally, the cover story that was used by certain 
NSC and CIA officials in November 1986 was first 
employed in November 1985 for purposes of oper-
ational security. The President, Secretary Shultz, 
McFarlane, Poindexter, North, and various CIA offi-
cials, however, were fully aware in November 1985 
that Israel was shipping HAWKs to Iran?not oil-
drilling equipment?with U.S. approval and assistance 
to obtain the release of the American hostages.

ed as follows: 
The modalities for sale to Iran present formida-
ble difficulties: 
Iran is not currently certified for sales, including 
indirectly as a third country, per Sec. 3 of the 
AECA. 
Congress must be notified of all sales of $14 
million or more, whether it is a direct sale or 
indirect to a third country. The notice must be 
unclassified (except for some details), and the sale 
cannot take place until 30 days after the notice. 
The 30 days can be waived for direct sales, but the 
third country transfer has no such provision, and 
notice must still be given in any case. 
Thus, even if the missiles were laundered 
through Israel, Congress would have to be noti-
fied. 
It is conceivable that the sale could be broken 
into 3 or 4 packages, in order to evade Congres-
sional notice. While there is no explicit injunction 
against splitting up such a sale (subject to check 
. . .), the spirit and the practice of the law is 
against that, and all Administrations have observed 
this scrupulously.

Clearing Hurdles: The President Approves A 
New Plan 
The difficulties with the November 1985 HAWK 
shipment and the failure to secure the release of more 
hostages did not end the arms-to-Iran initiative. 
Having already traveled down the path of bargaining 
for the hostages' lives, the President and his NSC staff 
were reluctant to turn back. North quickly began to 
plan another arms deal, and the President signed the 
Finding that Stanley Sporkin prepared immediately 
after the HAWK shipment. North claimed repeatedly 
in December that reversing course would cause the 
radical captors to kill the hostages. 
North had another motivation for continuing the 
arms deals. As he explained to Israeli officials in early 
December, he wanted to divert profits to benefit the 
Contras he was supporting in Nicaragua. 
In December 1985 and January 1986, the Secretar-
ies of State and Defense argued aggressively to the 
President against trying to trade arms for hostages. 
Among other things, they asserted that this initiative 
was illegal and contrary to longstanding U.S. public 
policy against providing arms to terrorist states and 
bargaining with terrorists. 
Secretary Weinberger and Secretary Shultz' argu-
ments, together with a first-hand assessment by 
McFarlane that the Iranian intermediary was the 
"most despicable man" he had ever encountered, 
caused the initiative to lose momentum in December. 
However, in early January the Israelis approached 
Poindexter?who had replaced McFarlane as National 
Security Adviser?with a new plan that Poindexter 
and North quickly embraced. The President decided 
to go forward. He signed an expanded Finding and 
directed that the covert activity not be reported to 
Congress. 
Unlike the 1985 transactions, the President decided 
that the weapons for Iran would now come directly 
from U.S. stocks. The NSC staff took charge of the 
initiative, relegating the Israelis to a secondary role. 
Secord was designated as the agent of the U.S. Gov-
ernment in the future transactions. This created the 
opportunity to generate profits on the arms sales that 
the Enterprise could use for its other covert 
projects?including support of the Contras. 
The Players Change 
John Poindexter?soon to be elevated to National Se-
curity Adviser?and Oliver North met on November 
27, 1985, to devise a new plan. Poindexter directed 
North to have Richard Secord or Israeli official 
David Kimche deliver a message to soothe the Irani-
ans' feeling of having been cheated because the 
HAWKs delivered three days earlier did not meet 
their expectation. North and Poindexter also discussed 
a "change of team" on the operation. North's notes of 
the meeting indicate that the United States was pre-
pared to deliver 120 items (probably a new version of 
HAWKs) in exchange for all the hostages after the 
first delivery and a commitment by Iran of no future 
terrorism.' 
The change in team included removing Michael 
Ledeen, the NSC terrorism consultant, as an interme-
diary. When Ledeen gave Poindexter the message 
that the Iranians felt cheated, Poindexter told him, 
"We're going to take you off this thing for awhile 
because we need somebody with more technical ex-
pertise."2 This was the last time Ledeen spoke to 
Poindexter on the Iran initiative, "since from the time 
[Poindexter] became National Security Adviser, 
[Ledeen] was unable to get an appointment with 
him." 3 
In late November, Secord, Iranian go-between 
Ghorbanifar, Kimche, and Israeli arms dealers Al 
Schwimmer and Yaacov Nimrodi met in Paris.4 Ac-
cording to notes North took when Secord briefed him 
on the meeting, Ghorbanifar was "angry," apparently 
because the Iranians wanted "something to deal w[ith] 
Soviet Recon[naisancer ?such as Phoenix or Har-
poon missiles?rather than the HAWKs that were 
delivered.5 Ghorbanifar advanced a set of proposals 
that "blatantly" called for the swapping of arms for 
hostages.6 The first proposal, as later related to North 
by Secord, provided for a phased exchange of 3200 
TOW missiles for hostages: 
600 TOWs = 1 release 
H ? 6 hrs later = 2000 TOWs = 3 release 
H+ 23 hrs = 600 TOWs -= 1 release7 
The other options were variations in which other 
armaments?such as Maverick air-to-surface missiles,

Dragon surface-to-surface missiles, Improved-HAWK 
missiles, spares for F-4 air planes, ground artillery, 
and bombs?would be substituted for some or all of 
the TOWs. Ghorbanifar's proposal also contemplated 
arms deliveries beyond the initial swap.9 The Paris 
group agreed to meet with U.S. representatives in 
London on December 6 to pursue these proposals.9 
North Looks for Weapons 
During the first few days of December, North had 
separate meetings with Assistant Secretary of Defense 
Richard L. Armitage and Israeli Ministry of Defense 
officials.' ? The purpose of these sessions was to estab-
lish liaison between the Pentagon and the Israelis and 
to identify methods of obtaining weapons to ship to 
the Iranians or to replenish Israeli stocks following 
Israeli shipments." One of the Israeli officials met 
Armitage at the Pentagon on December 2." Armi-
tage testified that he could not recall whether he met 
with the official or what they discussed." Armitage 
testified that he warned North of resistance to the 
plan within the Defense Department, noting that Sec-
retary Weinberger would be "appalled" if he knew 
North was dealing with Iranians." Nonetheless, after 
this meeting, Armitage asked Dr. Henry Gaffney, Di-
rector of Plans, Defense Security Assistance Agency 
(DSAA), to prepare a paper on I-HAWKs and I-
TOWs and directed Glenn A. Rudd, Deputy Director 
of DSAA, to prepare a paper on the legal methods 
for transferring TOW and HAWK missiles to Iran." 
Rudd's two-page paper, entitled "Possibility for 
Leaks," discussed legal methods of selling HAWKs 
and TOWs to Iran and outlined the inherent risks of 
Congressional disclosure or discovery by the security 
assistance community. Rudd concluded there was no 
way to transfer the weapons, whether directly to Iran 
or through Israel to Iran, under the Arms Export 
Control Act without notifying Congress; nor, he said, 
was there any way to prevent the security assistance 
community of bureaucrats, diplomats, and arms manu-
facturers and dealers from learning of the transfers." 
When he received Rudd's paper, Armitage instruct-
ed Rudd to treat the matter as very confidential and 
destroy all drafts. Armitage kept the sole copy in his 
personal office safe.'7 When Armitage briefed Wein-
berger prior to a December 7, 1985, meeting at the 
White House, they reviewed "all the arguments that I 
[Armitage] had laid out, plus the legal arguments 
which I had mentioned in passing, and that he had 
absorbed." '8* 
*Weinberger did not recall such a meeting, but did not dispute 
that it had occurred. Weinberger Test., Hearings, 100-10, at 97. In 
any event, at the White House meeting on December 7, he was 
well-prepared to attack the plan on a variety of legal and policy 
grounds. 
194 
North Lays Out A Plan 
On December 4, North wrote a PROF message to 
Poindexter setting out the current situation and pro-
posing a new arms-for-hostages transaction. He de-
scribed the "extraordinary distrust" the Iranians de-
veloped because Schwimmer and Ledeen had prom-
ised that the missiles shipped in November could fly 
high enough to stop Soviet reconnaissance flights. He 
said, "None of us [Kimche, Meron, Secord] have any 
illusions about the cast of characters we are dealing 
with on the other side. They are a primitive, unso-
phisticated group who are extraordinarily distrustful 
of the West in general and the Israelis/U.S. in particu-
lar."19 
While acknowledging "a high degree of risk" in 
continuing the operation, North emphasized, "we are 
now so far down the road that stopping what has 
been started could have even more serious repercus-
sions." He exhorted Poindexter to press on in a way 
that suggested the United States was already subject 
to Iranian extortion: 
If we do not at least make one more try at this 
point, we stand a good chance of condemning 
some or all [of the hostages] to death and a 
renewed wave of Islamic Jihad terrorism. While 
the risks of proceeding are significant, the risks of 
not trying one last time are even greater.2? 
North outlined the proposal slated for the upcom-
ing meeting in London. He said the "package" would 
comprise deliveries from Israel of "50 I HAWKs w/ 
PIP (product improvement package) and 3300 basic 
TOWs" and reported that the Iranians had already 
deposited $41 million to pay for these items and that 
this sum was "now under our control."2' The sched-
ule that North laid out made plain that this would be 
an unadulterated swap of arms for hostages: 
H-hr: 1 707 w/300 TOWs = 1 AMCIT 
H+ 10hrs: 1 707 (same A/C) w/300 TOWs = 1 
AMCIT 
H+16hrs: 1 747 w/50 HAWKs & 400 TOWS =-
2 AMCITs 
H+20hrs: 1 707 w/300 TOWs = 1 AMCIT 
H+24hrs: 1 747 w/2000 TOWs = French Hos-
tage22 
As it had been previously, the schedule was set up so 
that the Americans had to deliver weapons before the 
Iranians would produce any hostages. 
North also reported to Poindexter that "replenish-
ing Israeli stocks" is "probably the most delicate 
issue." He proposed that the Israelis purchase replace-
ments with cash, rather than with Foreign Military 
Sales credits. However, he ignored the legal question 
about third-country transfers under the Arms Export 
Control Act. Lastly, North told Poindexter that be-

Chapter 11 
sides themselves, only National Security Adviser 
Robert McFarlane and Duane Clarridge of the CIA 
had a complete understanding of the full plan.23 Clar-
ridge has denied that he and North discussed this 
plan, and said that the appearance of his name in 
North's PROF message is probably due to North's 
"tendency to use my name with McFarlane and Poin-
dexter because if I said it was a good idea, then they 
tended to think it was a good idea."24 
The following day, North put the proposal into an 
unsigned, unaddressed memorandum. This memoran-
dum made clear that all 3,300 TOWs and all 50 Im-
proved HAWK missiles would come from Israel's 
"prepositioned war reserve."25 North's memorandum 
proposed not only that Congress not be notified about 
the operation and replenishment, but also that there 
be a cover story to explain why Israel needed to buy 
weapons: 
The Israelis have identified a means of transfer-
ring the Iranian provided funds to an Israeli De-
fense Force (IDF) account, which will be used 
for purchasing items not necessarily covered by 
FMS. They will have to purchase the replenish-
ment items from the U.S. in FMS transaction 
from U.S. stocks. Both the number of weapons 
and the size of the cash transfer could draw at-
tention. If a single transaction is more than 
$14.9 M, we would normally have to notify Con-
gress. The Israelis are prepared to justify the large 
quantity and urgency based on damage caused to 
the equipment in storage.26 
Although the Finding CIA Counsel Stanley Sporkin 
drafted in November contemplated delayed Congres-
sional notification, North's proposal represented an 
entirely different approach: structuring the transaction 
so as to evade Congressional reporting altogether. 
As North was putting together his plan for a new 
arms-for-hostages deal, the CIA stood by to provide 
support for more flights into Iran. In the days after 
the HAWK shipment, Clarridge and CIA stations in 
Countries 16 and 18 exchanged numerous cables relat-
ing to clearances for anticipated flights from Israel to 
Iran transiting at Country 18 and overflying Country 
16.27 On November 27, Clarridge told the stations 
that the "operation is still on but we have encoun-
tered delays" and that "whatever was supposed to 
happen after the first sortie did not happen and we 
are regrouping." 2 8 On December 3, he reported to 
them: "We are still regrouping. Key meetings of prin-
cipals will take place this weekend with earliest possi-
ble aircraft deployments sometime mid to late week of 
December 8."29 Clarridge left the United States on 
other business in early December. However, before 
leaving he told his deputy to expect another flight to 
Iran on a project being run by the NSC for which the 
CIA would be asked to obtain clearances.30 (For an 
organizational chart of the CIA in 1985, see Figure 
11-1.) 
The President Signs a Finding 
McFarlane returned to his office on December 3 for 
the first time after the Geneva summit. He had al-
ready told the President of his decision to resign, and 
he tendered his resignation the following day." On 
December 3 and 4, McFarlane had several lengthy 
meetings with Poindexter. However, he does not 
recall any discussion of the status of the covert action 
Finding3 2?which CIA Director William Casey had 
delivered to Poindexter with a recommendation that 
the President sign it and about which McMahon had 
been anxiously pestering Poindexter for days.33 
On December 5, in one of his first acts as National 
Security Adviser, Poindexter presented the Finding to 
the President at his daily national security briefing. 
The President signed it.34 Poindexter's notes of his 
daily briefing of the President refer to the Finding.35 
Chief of Staff Donald Regan was present at this brief-
ing, but testified that he has no recollection of the 
Finding or the President's signing it: 
I have racked my brains since I've read about it 
in the press, that you have had testimony to that 
effect. I've checked with my members of the 
staff, the White House staff who were working 
with me at the time, as to whether they remem-
ber it. No one can remember seeing that docu-
ment.3 6 
Poindexter testified that he was never happy with 
the Finding because it failed to mention any objec-
tives other than trading arms for hostages. He said he 
submitted it to the President without the staffing and 
review that normally accompanies a Finding. In fact, 
other than Casey and McMahon?who both urged 
that the Finding be signed?Poindexter did not recall 
discussing it with anyone else.37* 
*McMahon recalled that Sporkin told him he was going to con-
sult with the Department of Justice and the White House counsel 
before finalizing the Finding. (McMahon Dep., 9/2/87, at 52) 
North testified that he believed that Meese had "seen and ap-
proved" this Finding before it was signed. However, he based this

Chapter 11 
Poindexter testified that, to him, the primary signifi-
cance of the Finding was its retroactivity?a feature 
that was highly unusual, if not unique.* He said, 
"There really wasn't a forward-looking aspect to the 
Finding."38 However, at the time that the Finding 
was signed, Poindexter was considering the detailed 
plan that North had presented for further arms sales, 
and this was the subject of a meeting two days later 
with the NSC principals. 
The original of the signed Finding was kept in Paul 
Thompson's safe at the NSC.38 Contrary to normal 
practice, the CIA and other agencies were not given 
a copy. Indeed, no copies were made. McMahon said 
that he knew of no other occasion when this oc-
curred.4? 
When the Iran initiative was unraveling almost a 
year later, Poindexter destroyed this Finding. He be-
lieved that if the Finding came to light it would cause 
"significant political embarrassment" to the President 
because it would reinforce the emerging picture that 
the United States had traded arms for hostages.'" In 
addition, the Finding was evidence of the Administra-
tion's contemporaneous knowledge of the HAWK 
shipment, a fact that Poindexter, Casey, North, and 
others sought to conceal in November 1986. 
Poindexter Briefs Shultz 
The same day the President signed the Finding, 
Poindexter briefed Secretary of State George Shultz 
by telephone on the status of the Iran initiative. The 
briefing?Shultz's first from Poindexter on the sub-
ject?was not complete: Poindexter did not even men-
tion the Finding. Not knowing he was hearing only 
part of the story, Shultz commented at the time to an 
aide, "he [Poindexter] told me more than I had 
known before of what went on in the latter half of 
1985 and I felt this was a good thing and we were off 
to a good start."42 Shultz told Poindexter that the 
Iran initiative was a "very bad idea"" and that "[w]e 
are signaling to Iran that they can kidnap people for 
profit." 4 4 
That same day, December 5, CIA Deputy Director 
John McMahon convened a meeting with several top 
CIA officials, including Robert Gates, Edward Juch-
niewicz, and Chief of the Near East Division (C/NE). 
McMahon said that a meeting with the President was 
slated for the weekend to "take stock" of U.S. efforts 
to free hostages and expand ties with Iran. He re-
quested that various facts relating to Iran's military 
strength and the status of the Iran-Iraq war be pulled 
together. Someone at the meeting reviewed what had 
* Poindexter testified that he could recall only "one or possibly 
two other findings that had a retroactive nature to them. I, frankly, 
was always uncomfortable with that, because I thought it didn't 
particulary make a lot of sense." (Poindexter Test., Hearings, 100-8 
at 18) In Executive Session, Poindexter testified that after further 
thought, he could not recall any other retroactive Findings. (Poin-
dexter Test., Executive Session, 8/6/87, at p. 
already happened, including the November 24 ship-
ment and the preparation and signing of the Finding, 
and the planning for more shipments, including 
North's chartering of planes and his upcoming trip to 
London for more talks." 
North Raises Contra Diversion with 
Israelis 
On the day after the President signed the Finding, 
December 6, North remarked during a meeting with 
Israeli officials that the United States wanted to use 
profits from the upcoming arms sale to Iran to fund 
U.S. activity in Nicaragua. The meeting, which was 
held in New York, concerned replenishment of Israeli 
TOWs. One of the Israeli officials made handwritten 
notes of this meeting on December 12, 1985. Accord-
ing to these notes, the Israelis were told by North 
that not only did the United States have no budget to 
pay for the 504 TOW missiles (and planned on the 
Israeli Government's receiving this money from the 
Israeli intermediaries), but that in the future the 
United States wanted to generate profits from this 
transaction in order to finance part of its activity in 
Nicaragua. According to the Israeli Historical Chro-
nology, North had a position paper with him at the 
meeting that he said was to be presented to the Presi-
dent at a meeting the following day.48** 
North testified that he recalled no such conversa-
tion, though he could not rule it out: 
My recollection was that the first time it [the 
diversion] was specifically addressed was during 
a [later] meeting with Ghorbanifar. It may well 
have come up before, but I don't recall it.47 
North testified that his "clearest recollection" was 
that the notion of using the residuals for the Contras 
was first suggested by Ghorbanifar in January 1986.48 
North flew from New York to London on Decem-
ber 6 and met with Secord, Ghorbanifar, Kimche, 
Schwimmer, and Nimrodi to discuss the 50-HAWK, 
3,300-TOW proposal that North had previously pre-
sented to Poindexter." Ghorbanifar acknowledged 
that the Iranians were having increasing difficulty 
maintaining control over the Hizballah captors and 
pressed vigorously for a quick renewal of arms ship-
ments.8? 
The President and His Advisers Review 
the Initiative 
While North was moving full-steam ahead in the 
negotiations, the President and his top national securi-
ty advisers debated the Iranian initiative at an infor-

did not take notes, did not recall the remarks of North recorded by

Chapter 11 
mal meeting on the morning of Saturday, December 
7, in the White House residence. Present were the 
President, Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger, McMa-
hon (sitting in for Casey, who was out of town), 
McFarlane, Poindexter, and Regan.5' According to 
McFarlane, the purpose of the meeting was "to 
review what has taken place since the President's 
approval of August and the negative viewpoints of 
the Secretaries of State and Defense to the effect that 
we hadn't achieved our purpose, and [that the initia-
tive] was degenerating into an arms for hostage ar-
rangement."52 The discussion that ensued "was now 
more specific than it had been in August, and it was 
about a specific plan" to trade weapons for hos-
tages.53 
Secretary Shultz, Secretary Weinberger, and Regan 
all voiced strong opposition to the initiative. Secre-
tary Shultz advanced multiple policy reasons for not 
pursuing it. His "talking points" for the session stated 
that the initiative would "negate the whole policy" of 
not making "deals with terrorists"; that he doubted it 
would buy the United States influence with moderates 
in Iran; that it would undoubtedly become public and 
"badly shakeir moderate Arabs when they learned 
that the United States was "breaking our commitment 
to them and helping the radicals in Tehran fight their 
fellow Arab Iraq"; and that U.S. allies would be 
"shocked if they knew we were helping Iran in spite 
of our protestations to the contrary."54 
Secretary Weinberger also forcefully voiced oppo-
sition, including on legal grounds. He said the pro-
posed arms deal would violate both the U.S. embargo 
against the shipment of arms to Iran and the restric-
tions on third-country transfers of U.S.-provided arms 
in the Arms Export Control Act. He later testified: 
"[T]here was no way in which this kind of a transfer 
could be made if that particular Act governed."55 
Secretary Weinberger also pressed many of the ar-
guments made by the Secretary of State: 
I ran through a whole group [of specific objec-
tions] and raised every point that occurred to me, 
including the fact that we were at the same time 
asking other countries not to make sales of weap-
ons to Iran, that there was no one of any reliabil-
ity or, indeed, any sense with whom we could 
deal in Iran and the government, and that we 
would not have any bargain carried out, that if 
we were trying to help get hostages released, 
why there would be a real worry that the matter 
would not be held in any way confidential, that 
we would be subjected to blackmail, so to speak, 
by people who did know it in Iran and else-
where, and that we had no interest whatsoever in 
helping Iran in any military way, even a minor 
way, and that in every way it was a policy that 
we should not engage in and most likely would 
not be successful.56 
198 
Secretary Weinberger told the President that the initi-
ative "wouldn't accomplish anything, and that they 
[the Iranians] would undoubtedly continue to milk 
us."57 McMahon argued that the long-range rationale 
of the arms transactions?to bring about a more mod-
erate regime in Iran?was unfounded. 
I said that I was unaware of any moderates in 
Iran, that most of the moderates had been slaugh-
tered by Khomeini, that whatever arms we give 
to these so-called moderates they will end up 
supporting the present Khomeini regime and they 
would go to the front and be used against the 
Iraqis and that would be bad." 
McMahon "was convinced that all of this was an 
arms for hostage arrangement, no matter what you 
called it. . . ."33 There is evidence that McMahon 
also argued that Ghorbanifar was unreliable.60 
The President, along with McFarlane and Poin-
dexter, spoke in favor of continuing the initiative.6" 
According to Secretary Shultz: 
The President, I felt, was somewhat on the fence 
but rather annoyed at me and Secretary Wein-
berger because I felt that he sort of?he was very 
concerned about the hostages, as well as very 
much interested in the Iran Initiative.62 
Secretary Shultz testified that the President was 
"fully engaged" in the conversation and frustrated 
with the situation.63 
In response to Weinberger's legal objections, Shultz 
recalls that the President responded: "'Well, the 
American people will never forgive me if I fail to get 
these hostages out over this legal question,' or some-
thing like that." Weinberger replied: "'[B]ut visiting 
hours are Thursday', or some such statement."64" 
The participants left the meeting with different 
views about whether the initiative would proceed. 
According to Poindexter, the President wanted to 
pursue every means of trying to get the hostages 
back.65 But McFarlane recalled that the President, 
with disappointment and frustration, approved the po-
sition of no more arms sales to Iran, at least pending 
the London meeting." McMahon said that no deci-
sion was made, and that the President left the meeting 
to do his Saturday afternoon radio broadcast, telling 
his advisers to "talk more on this and see what ought 
to be done."67 Secretary Weinberger testified that he 
believed the initiative had been put to rest once and 
for all. Indeed, he returned to the Pentagon after the

Secretary Weinberger did not have the tone of the President advo-
cating violating the law, but rather "was the kind of statement that 
I am sure we all make sometimes when we are frustrated." Shultz

meeting and told his military aide that "this baby had 
been strangled in its cradle, that it was finished."'" 
And Secretary Shultz "wasn't sure" where things 
stood after the meeting, but believed that he and 
Secretary Weinberger had prevailed.69 
A striking aspect of the December 7 meeting was 
what was not discussed: According to McMahon and 
Weinberger, neither the November shipment of 
HAWK missiles, nor the Finding that was signed just 
two days earlier, came up.70 
Despite varying impressions of the meeting, the 
President directed McFarlane to go to London to 
meet with Ghorbanifar and others. Poindexter testi-
fied that the purpose was to "check out" the Israeli 
channel to Iran so that the President could have first-
hand information on which to base a decision."* 
McFarlane testified that his purpose was to stress to 
Ghorbanifar that the United States was open to politi-
cal discourse with Iran but no arms sales." But there 
is evidence of a more specific purpose: McFarlane 
was to try to talk Ghorbanifar into arranging a release 
of the hostages outside the framework of an arms 
deal, or at least before any more arms deliveries." 
Poindexter proposed at one point during the meeting 
that McFarlane also have authority, if the Iranians 
rejected this approach, to inquire whether the British 
Government would perform the replenishment sales 
to Israel that Weinberger had argued the United 
States could not make.74 There is no evidence that 
such an approach was made. 
McFarlane Meets Ghorbanifar in 
London 
On December 8, McFarlane joined Kimche, Secord, 
North, Nimrodi, and Ghorbanifar in London." 
McFarlane presented an agenda that focused on a 
political opening with Iran and on areas of possible 
common interests between the United States and Iran. 
In contrast, Ghorbanifar wanted to talk only about 
specified numbers of TOW missiles for each hos-
tage.76 Ghorbanifar explained that the Iranians were 
very angry over receiving the wrong kind of HAWK 
missiles. McFarlane responded: "[G]o pound sand, 
that is too bad."77 McFarlane was "revolted" by the 
bargaining and found Ghorbanifar to be a "borderline 
moron." 7 8 
North's view of the meeting was slightly different. 
He thought McFarlane was telling Ghorbanifar that 
there could be no more arms sales until after the 
hostages were released, not that McFarlane was pre-
cluding arms sales.79 Once again, as the initiative 
began to come apart, North raised the specter of the 
death of the hostages in retaliation for a U.S. decision 
to break off the negotiations. In a memorandum to 
*In fact, the United States already had substantial first-hand in-
formation on Ghorbanifar from both CIA officials and Ledeen. 
McFarlane and Poindexter, he wrote: "[A]ll it would 
take for the hostages to be killed is for Tehran to 
'stop saying no' [to the captors]."" 
McFarlane, North, and Secord flew back to Wash-
ington together on December 9. On the way back, 
McFarlane said he was very unhappy with Ghorbani-
far's arms-for-hostages pitch. He viewed Ghorbanifar 
as a businessman interested only in profit and "one of 
the most despicable characters he had ever met."" 
North was unhappy with McFarlane's negative re-
action" and that day wrote an "eyes only" memoran-
dum to McFarlane and Poindexter entitled "Next 
Steps." In it, North reviewed options that he saw as 
necessary "[i]f we are to prevent the death or more of 
the hostages in the near future."'" After reviewing 
the problems of Ghorbanifar's untrustworthiness, 
Schwimmer's arrangement of previous deals that an-
gered the Iranians and left Israel with inadequate 
funds for replenishment, and the United States' "lack 
of operational control over transactions with Ghor-
banifar," North initially set out four options: the arms-
for-hostage swap discussed in London, an Israeli de-
livery of 4.00 to 500 TOWs to Iran to restore "good 
faith," a military raid, and "do nothing." North sum-
marily rejected the "do nothing" approach: 
Very dangerous since U.S. has, in fact, pursued 
earlier Presidential decision to play along with 
Gorbanifahr's plan. U.S. reversal now in mid-
stream could ignite Iranian fire?hostages would 
be our minimum losses." 
North testified that Casey shared his view that termi-
nating the negotiations would lead to the death of the 
hostages. 8 5 
At the end of the memo, North described a "fifth 
option": the United States would directly sell arms to 
Iran, acting pursuant to a Presidential Finding and 
using Secord as an operational "conduit."'" The Iran 
initiative was restructured over the next few weeks to 
closely resemble this "fifth option." Moreover, using 
the Enterprise as a conduit for the arms sales pro-
ceeds facilitated the diversion of funds to the Contras 
that North had mentioned to the Israelis only a few 
days earlier.** 
McFarlane Briefs the President on the 
London Meeting 
On December 10, McFarlane briefed the President 
on the London meeting. Also present were Casey, 
**On the same day that North prepared this "Next Steps" memo-
randum, he also met with the General Counsel of the CIA, Stanley 
Sporkin. (North Calendar, 12/9/85, N336) Sporkin recalls that 
McMahon was to attend this meeting as well and that the purpose 
was to discuss McMahon's desire that the CIA's role in the Iran 
initiative be eliminated or reduced. Sporkin Test., Hearings, 100-6,

Chapter 11 
Poindexter, North, and Regan.87* McFarlane empha-
sized that Ghorbanifar lacked integrity and that the 
initiative was unlikely to bear fruit if he remained the 
channel to the Iranians." At the same time, McFar-
lane or North said that abandoning the initiative 
would risk the lives of the hostages." The President 
seemed influenced by this concern." 
No decision was reached about the future of the 
initiative, and again there were differing perceptions 
about what would happen. The President continued 
to hope that its continuation might lead to freedom 
for the hostages. McFarlane recalled that the Presi-
dent asked, 
[W]hy couldn't we continue to let Israel manage 
this program, and was expressing and searching 
for, I think understandably, ways to keep alive 
the hope for getting the hostages back, and it is 
quite true that the President was profoundly con-
cerned for the hostages." 
Casey left the meeting with "the idea that the Presi-
dent had not entirely given up on encouraging the 
Israelis to carry on with the Iranians."82 
I suspect he would be willing to run the risk and 
take the heat in the future if this will lead to 
springing the hostages. It appears that Bud 
[McFarlane] has the action." 
Poindexter testified that the President was disappoint-
ed that Ghorbanifar appeared to be so unreliable, but 
was reluctant to abandon the project." In contrast, 
State Department officials were left with the impres-
sion that the initiative was dead. Under Secretary of 
State Michael Armacost reported to Shultz, who was 
in Europe, that "Bud's recommendation, upon return-
ing from his latest discussions, was to drop the enter-
prise. That has now been agreed."88 
Late that evening, Clarridge's deputy, who was the 
acting Chief of the CIA's European Division in Clar-
ridge's absence, cabled CIA stations in Countries 16 
and 18 to inform them that there would be no more 
flights, at least in the short run. He wrote: 
As late as last night the negotiating was still 
going on. We have just received word now that 
the deal is apparently all off. Don't know why 
yet or whether there is a possibility that it will 
revive in the future. . . . [F]or now it looks like 
we are standing down." 
Poindexter to North: Keep Trying 
Following the briefing, Poindexter had the clear im-
pression that the President wanted to continue the 
program, and he moved to put it "on a sounder foot-
Some of the participants place Weinberger at this meeting, but 
he has no recollection of it. 
200 
ing."87 Casey too was "a very strong advocate of 
proceeding."88 Poindexter told North to continue his 
efforts to keep the Iran initiative moving forward." 
This involved at least three steps: first, preparing a 
fully staffed and more comprehensive covert action 
Finding; second, substituting a new team?to be lead 
by North and Israeli Amiram Nir?to replace Ledeen, 
Schwimmer, and Nimrodi; and third, finding a legal 
way to sell arms to Iran. On this last point, Poin-
dexter asked North to work with "the appropriate 
people at CIA and in [Attorney General] Ed Meese's 
office, if not Ed Meese himself.99100 
The CIA Evaluates Ghorbanifar 
Ledeen, with North's approval, aggressively urged 
the CIA to establish an intelligence relationship with 
Ghorbanifar. In early December, Ledeen met with 
the CIA's Duane Clarridge and Charles Allen. He 
told Allen the history of the Iran initiative, including 
the HAWK missile debacle. He then explained why 
he believed Ghorbanifar had contacts that could help 
the CIA gain insights into the Iranian regime and 
assist its counterterrorism efforts. Ledeen said Ghor-
banifar was "a good fellow who is a lot of fun" and 
"praised [him] to the hilt."1?1** Allen passed the 
information to the CIA's Near East Division for eval-
uation.102 
After meeting with Ghorbanifar in mid-December 
in Switzerland, Ledeen met with Casey on December 
19 and repeated his arguments for dealing with the 
Iranian. Casey reacted favorably but indicated a need 
to clear up the controversy over Ghorbanifar's poor 
record with the CIA.'" 
Casey called Deputy Director for Operations Clair 
George and instructed him to arrange a new evalua-
tion of Ghorbanifar.'" On December 22, the Chief 
of the Iran branch at the CIA interviewed Ghorbani-
far at Ledeen's home. Ledeen and Allen were there 
and North showed up near the end. Ledeen told the 
Chief of the Iran branch that Ghorbanifar is "a won-
derful man . . . almost too good to be true." The 
conversation focused on terrorism and leading person-
alities in Iran.108 
The Chief of the Iran branch reported to his CIA 
superiors that he was "only further convinced of the 
untruthfulness or lack of trust that we could put in 
Mr. Ghorbanifar." They decided that Ghorbanifar 
should be given a polygraph test, and Ghorbanifar 
agreed.1" After hearing the briefing on Ghorbanifar, 
Casey sent the President an "eyes only" letter stating 
that one of the ongoing initiatives to free the hostages 
was a plan involving Ghorbanifar. Casey wrote of 
**At this time, Ledeen also outlined Ghorbanifar's proposal for 
an anti-Libyan "sting" operation in which the assassination of a 
leading opponent of Qadhafi would be staged and later revealed to 
be faked. Ledeen Dep., 6/22/87, at 167, 172-74.

Ghorbanifar: "He has 3 or 4 scenarios he would like 
to play out." ?7 
The decision to consider continued reliance on 
Ghorbanifar was remarkable. Previously, Agency offi-
cials had found his information so marked by deceit, 
lies, and self-serving proclamations that it had issued a 
"burn notice" warning the U.S. intelligence communi-
ty that he could not be trusted and should not be 
dealt with.'" Moreover, the information Ghorbanifar 
was providing was almost impossible to corroborate. 
He alone was explaining the Iranian position on the 
hostage issue. The last deal he had helped arrange, 
the November HAWK shipment, had been a com-
plete disaster. 
Acceleration of the Initiative: 
January 1986 
Israelis Add a New Element to the 
Negotiations: The Southern Lebanon 
Army Prisoners 
In mid-December, 1985, Amiram Nir, adviser to the 
Prime Minister of Israel, became involved in the Iran 
operation; he later became the liaison to the Ameri-
cans and Ghorbanifar. Nir, who reportedly was un-
aware of the secret Iranian arms deals prior to this 
time, had spent the last month exploring whether 
American hostages in Lebanon would be released if 
the Southern Lebanon Army freed Shiite prisoners. 
Nir proposed to his superiors that he discreetly get 
the reaction of the Americans to a hostage release 
initiative along these lines.'03 
After being briefed on the U.S.-Israeli Iran oper-
ation, Nir began work on a plan linking that operation 
with his own plan. He presented to high-ranking Is-
raeli officials a proposal that included: (1) a direct sale 
of TOWs out of Israeli arsenals to Iran and the simul-
taneous release of American hostages; (2) a purchase 
by Israel from the United States of replacement arms, 
using the proceeds from the Iran sale; (3) exerting 
Israeli influence to obtain the release of prisoners held 
by the Southern Lebanon Army; (4) the handling of 
all logistics by the Israelis to enable the Americans to 
deny any involvement; and (5) the construction of a 
convincing cover story to explain the release of the 
hostages and the prisoners."? Nir then went to 
London in late December to meet, for the first time, 
with Ghorbanifar and one of the Israeli intermediar-
ies. The three hammered out a detailed?but tenta-
tive?plan embodying these elements. The Israeli 
Government authorized Nir to present this plan to the 
United States but made clear that the transaction 
could occur only with U.S. agreement to the entire 
concept and that Israel would assist in whatever way 
the Americans requested, but not play a leading 
role.''' 
Nir Comes to Washington 
On January 2, 1986, Nir flew to Washington to 
meet with Poindexter and North at the request of 
Prime Minister Peres."2 In an opening meeting with 
North in a hotel, Nir said that he had an idea about 
how to improve the progress of the Iranian oper-
ation. 113 Nir met later that morning with Poindexter, 
North, and Don Fortier, Poindexter's deputy, and laid 
out his plan."4 The central features of the proposal 
were recorded by Poindexter in his notes: the Israelis 
would ship to Iran 4,000 "unimproved TOWs"; after 
the delivery of the first 500, all five American hos-
tages would be released; simultaneously the Southern 
Lebanon Army would release "20-30 Hizballah pris-
oners who don't have blood on their hands."' " If the 
American hostages were released, Israel would ship 
to Iran the other 3,500 TOWs and Iran would "con-
firm" its agreement for "no more hostages [and] 
terror."116 Under the plan, the United States would 
replace the TOWs only if the hostages were released. 
If the hostages were not released, replenishment was 
not required and Israel would have lost 500 TOWs. If 
they were freed, then the United States would replace 
the 4,000 TOWs, plus the 500 TOWs the Israelis had 
shipped in 1985." 7 
Rapid replacement of the TOWs was of particular 
concern to Nir. He emphasized that the number of 
TOWs would decrease Israel's arsenal when tension 
with Syria increased the urgency to keep Israel's arse-
nal at full strength. To address Israel's concerns about 
readiness, Nir called for the United States to "preposi-
tion" substitute TOWs near Israel as soon as possible 
in case a sudden need for them occurred. Thereafter, 
the United States was to proceed with "regular steady 
replacement" of the TOWs by sale to Israel. The 
Israelis also wanted a U.S. commitment that, if the 
operation were exposed, the United States would say 
it knew of the operation and did not object.'" 
Nir and North Discuss Use of Residuals 
Nir's proposal included another feature: generating 
profits that could be diverted to other covert projects. 
This was not a new concept: Nir and North had 
talked generally about joint covert operations in No-
vember, and North had told other Israelis in Decem-
ber that the United States wanted to use profits from 
the arms sale under discussion at that time to finance 
U.S. activities in Nicaragua. 
Poindexter recalled that at either the January 2 
meeting or another meeting with Nir a few days later, 
"[t]here also was a very brief, general discussion 
about some other cooperative activities." North?
who talked alone with Nir several times during the 
first days of January?testified to a more specific dis-
cussion about uses for the "residuals":

Chapter 11 
I recall that we met New Year's day or the day 
after . . . and it was his [Nir's] proposal at that 
point to use the profits by the arrangement they 
envisioned, selling Israeli TOWs at a profit, re-
plenishing them with part of that money, using 
part of that money for other operations. . . . I do 
not believe he mentioned contras at that meeting, 
but my recollection is we began to talk in early 
January about other joint U.S.-Israeli, and in 
some cases unilateral Israeli operations of a cer-
tain kind. . . .120 
A New Finding Is Prepared 
Poindexter realized from the start that if the United 
States embraced the Nir proposal for revitalizing the 
Iranian initiative, a new covert action Finding would 
be essential. In notes that he wrote on a flight to join 
the President in California immediately after the Janu-
ary 2 meeting he jotted: "Covert Finding?already 
pregnant for 500."121 Poindexter testified that the 
"500" was a reference to the TOWs that Israel had 
already shipped to Iran with U.S. approval but with-
out a Finding.122 
On the same day that Nir advanced his new pro-
posal, North contacted Sporkin to set in motion the 
drafting of a new covert action Finding to authorize 
the activity. North told Sporkin he wanted a more 
expansive Finding than the one Sporkin prepared in 
November. He said it should "cover certain other 
activities, that there was a broader concept to the 
relationship that was being considered with 
A first draft of the new Finding, prepared by a 
CIA staff lawyer who was told nothing of the No-
vember Finding,124 did not mention the objective of 
gaining the release of American hostages. It did au-
thorize shipment of arms to Iran. This draft included 
the standard provision calling for the Director of 
Central Intelligence to report the activity to the Intel-
ligence Committees of Congress.125 
On January 3, Sporkin edited the draft Finding, 
making several significant changes. First, he put the 
provision calling for Congressional notification in 
brackets, and above it inserted new language directing 
that the Director instead "refrain from reporting . . . 
until I [the President] otherwise direct." Sporkin 
made this change to present squarely to the President 
the alternatives on notification. Sporkin also changed 
the description section of the Finding. He apparently 
sent this draft to North during the day on January 
3.126 The draft contained no references to hostages. 
North asked Sporkin to meet with him that night to 
work on the Finding. Before agreeing to this, Sporkin 
tracked down Casey?who was vacationing in Flori-
da?and asked if he should do so. Casey told Sporkin 
that he knew nothing about what was going on, but 
that Sporkin should meet North and keep Casey in-
127 
202 
At the meeting, North showed Sporkin another 
draft of the Finding.'" The preamble of the North 
draft included only the nonnotification alternative, a 
modification that Poindexter, and?North assumed?
the President, approved.'" Among other changes 
were inclusion of a reference to "third parties" and a 
reference to "USG" (U.S. Government)?rather than 
just the CIA?as the entity authorized by the Finding 
to act.'" Sporkin understood "third parties" to refer 
"to the people that were working with Iran, Ghor-
banifar," as well as the Israelis who, Sporkin learned, 
were involved in the initiative in November."' The 
North draft, like the Sporkin draft, contained no ref-
erence to the central quid pro quo for the arms 
sales?the hostages. 
Later that evening or the following day, North 
called Casey, and Casey's reaction to the renewed 
initiative was positive. North then reported to Poin-
dexter that Casey "thought the Finding was good and 
that this is probably the only approach that will 
work."32 
The next day, North drafted a cover memorandum 
for Poindexter to send to the President with the Find-
ing. North wrote JIM Nir had proposed a plan "by 
which the U.S. and Israel can act in concert to bring 
about a more moderate government in Iran." He said 
that under the plan, this goal was to be achieved by 
providing "military materiel, expertise and intelli-
gence" to "Western-oriented Iranian factions." Pro-
viding such items to moderates would enable them to 
come to power by "demonstrat[ing] their credibility 
in defending Iran against Iraq and in deterring Soviet 
intervention," North said.133 
North's draft cover memorandum described the 
role to be played by the United States under the plan: 
As described by the Prime Minister's emissary 
[Nir], the only requirement the Israelis have is an 
assurance that they will be allowed to purchase 
U.S. replenishments for the stocks that they sell 
to Iran. Since the Israeli sales are technically a 
violation of our Arms Export Control Act em-
bargo for Iran, a Presidential Covert Action 
Finding is required in order for us to allow the 
Israeli sales to proceed and for our subsequent 
replenishment sales.134 
North's memorandum thus makes plain that he under-
stood that, without a Finding, the sale of U.S.-made 
weapons by Israel to Iran would violate the Arms 
Export Control Act. 
The memorandum also stated that if the plan were 
approved and the Finding signed, Israel would "uni-
laterally" commence delivery of TOW missiles to 
Iran in January, the United States would replenish 
Israeli stocks in less than 30 days, and five American 
hostages in Beirut would be released.'" The memo-
randum made no reference to Nies proposal regard-
ing release of dozens of prisoners held by the South-

em Lebanon Army, nor to the plan to use profits for 
other covert operations. 
On Sunday, January 5, North, Sporkin, and Casey 
met at Casey's home to discuss the new plan and the 
draft Finding. Casey read the draft Finding along 
with a draft cover memorandum and voiced his ap-
prova1.136 Sporkin, however, felt uncomfortable 
about omitting the hostage release objective from the 
Finding and raised this concern with Casey. Accord-
ing to Sporkin, North explained to Casey that the 
State Department did not want this in the Finding 
because it would create an appearance of a "hostage-
for-arms shipment" and therefore would not "look 
right." Sporkin argued that the hostage release 
aspect of the Finding was a "very important element" 
that "ought to be in there." Casey agreed.'" 
Apparently around this time, North also revised the 
cover memorandum to the President. He deleted the 
statement that the contemplated Israeli sales were a 
"technical violation" of the Arms Export Control Act 
and included a sentence expressly recommending that 
"you exercise your constitutional p[r]erogative to 
withhold notification of the Finding to the Congres-
sional oversight committees until such time that you 
deem it to be appropriate."138 
On Monday, January 6, North hand-carried the 
draft Finding and cover memorandum to Attorney 
General Meese for his review. North discussed it with 
the Attorney General and his deputy, D. Lowell 
Jensen. Attorney General Meese approved the Find-
ing and the "procedures we were using," according to 
North.139 Attorney General Meese does not recall 
the meeting, but is "satisfied that it took place.',140 
Jensen testified that North presented the papers for 
"informational" purposes only, and that the Attorney 
General was not asked for, and did not offer, any 
opinion.14 
The President and Advisers Consider the 
New Proposal 
At the morning national security briefing on Janu-
ary 6, Poindexter told the President of the Nir pro-
posal.'" The Vice President, Regan, and Don For-
tier were also present.'" The President "indicat[ed] 
he was in general agreement" with the proposal and 
decided there would be a full NSC meeting the fol-
lowing day on the proposal and the Finding. Poin-
dexter presented the President with the January 6 
draft of the Finding at this briefing. Poindexter did 
not intend that it be signed at this point because it had 
not yet been "fully staffed" and discussed among the 
President's national security advisers. But the Presi-
dent, not realizing that the Finding was only a pro-
posal for discussion, read it and signed it, reflecting 
his agreement.144 
? Secretary of State Shultz, in fact, had argued at the December 
7 meeting against any arms-for-hostages trade. 
At the full NSC meeting on January 7 were the 
President, the Vice President, Secretaries Shultz and 
Weinberger, Attorney General Meese, Casey, Poin-
dexter, and Regan.'" While Secretaries Weinberger 
and Shultz continued to object strenuously, all others 
favored the plan or were neutral.'" Secretary Wein-
berger, who said he had no advance knowledge about 
the subject, found it to be "very much a re-run" of 
the December meeting, except that now the President 
decided to go forward with the plan: 
I made the same points, George Shultz made the 
same points. Bill Casey felt that there would be 
an intelligence gain, and there was also talk of 
the hostages as one of the motivating 
factors, . . . but the responses of the President 
seemed to me to indicate he had changed his 
view and had now decided he wanted to do 
this.147 
There is no record that the Vice President expressed 
any views. 
At the meeting, Attorney General Meese provided 
a legal opinion that the arms sales could be done 
legally with Israel making the sales and the United 
States replenishing Israel's stocks.'" Secretary Wein-
berger again objected that the proposed transaction 
would violate the Arms Export Control Act; the At-
torney General responded that there were mecha-
nisms outside the AECA through which the operation 
could proceed legally, including "the President's in-
herent powers as Commander in Chief, the President's 
ability to conduct foreign policy. . . ."149 Meese 
referred to a 1981 written legal opinion by Attorney 
General William French Smith stating that the CIA 
could legally sell to third countries weapons obtained 
from the Defense Department under the Economy 
Act. On this authority, he "concurred with the view 
of Director Casey that it would be legal for the Presi-
dent to authorize arms transfers pursuant to the Na-
tional Security Act."156 
Secretary Shultz felt that it was very clear that the 
President wanted to go forward with the plan. To the 
Secretary of State, the lack of opposition "almost 
seemed unreal," and he left the meeting "puzzled, 
distressed."5' What Secretary Shultz did not know 
was that the President had signed a Finding on Janu-
ary 6. That act, an indication of the President's re-
solve, was not mentioned. 
North Proceeds With Plans for 
Replenishment 
That day, North called Nir in Israel and said that 
the United States was prepared to proceed with Nir's 
plan, subject to certain conditions. North said that 
both the President and Secretary Weinberger had 
agreed to the plan. North gave Nir this encoded mes-
sage:

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 11 
1. Joshua [President Reagan] has approved pro-
ceeding as we had hoped. 
2. Joshua and Samuel [Secretary Weinberger] 
have also agreed on method one [replenishment 
by sale, as opposed to "method two," replenish-
ment by prepositioning]. 
3. Following additional conditions apply to 
Albert [Code name for operation?]. 
A. Resupply should be as routine as possi-
ble to prevent disclosure on our side. May 
take longer than two months. However, 
Albert says if crisis arises Joshua promises 
that we will deliver all required by Galaxie 
[apparently C 5A cargo plane] in less than 
eighteen hours. 
B. Joshua also wants both your govt and 
ours to stay with no comment if operation is 
disclosed. 
4. If these conditions are acceptable to the 
Banana [Israel] th[e]n Oranges [U.S.] are ready to 
proceed.152 
Neither of the "additional conditions" proposed by 
the U.S. side dealt with the substance of the oper-
ation. North's notes reflect that the purpose for "rou-
tine" resupply spread over a period of months was to 
enable the purchases by Israel to be broken "into lots 
of less than Cong[ressional] limit" and to avoid "rais-
ing eyebrows."153 The "no comment" proposal 
would enable the United States?even after the oper-
ation was publicly exposed?to avoid acknowledging 
its central role. 
Nir and North also discussed terms for replenish-
ment sales.'" By this time, the Chief of the Israeli 
Procurement Mission in New York and Noel Koch, 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
International Security Affairs, had been designated as 
the Israeli and American contacts for hammering out 
the details.155 Nir told North that Israel could not 
use the money the Iranians had paid for the 504 
TOWs shipped in 1985 to buy replacements because 
this money was not available. On this point, North's 
notes state: "Regarding the first 504, it was agreed 
that the $ was used for other purposes."156 Over the 
next few days, Nir told North that Israel could pay 
only $5,000-$5,500 per missile and that the Depart-
ment of Defense, using a replacement cost figure, was 
demanding that Israel pay more.'" 
On January 9, Nir and North discussed how to use 
the money Iran would pay for the TOWs. North 
jotted the following calculation: 
$10M total 
2.5 to Ops 
1.5 to Gorba 
$6M avail for 4500'59 
204 
The note indicates that Israel was to receive $10,000 
per TOW from Iran, or $10 million for the first 1,000 
TOWs. From this sum, $2.5 million was to be divert-
ed to "Ops,"159 which North testified were the joint 
Israeli-U.S. covert operations previously discussed 
with Nir.16? Another $1.5 million was to go to Ghor-
banifar. The remaining $6 million would be available 
to pay the United States for the replacement TOWs. 
If this scheme were followed for each of the four 
planned shipments of 1,000 TOWs, $10 million would 
go for other covert operations and Israel would have 
$24 million to spend on replacement TOWs?enough 
to purchase 4,000 missiles at $6,000 each, or 4,500 
missiles at a price of $5,333 each. 
The next day, January 10, Koch and North con-
ferred about replacement of the Israeli TOWs. 
North's notes reflect that one option they considered 
was selling Israel Improved TOWs "at cos[t]."161 
The reference to Improved TOWs is significant be-
cause Israel was planning to send basic TOWs to 
Iran. Thus, the proposed transaction would substan-
tially upgrade Israel's arsenal at no cost to that coun-
try. The possibility that this might be an objective of 
the operation had caused some CIA lawyers discom-
fort.162 
After this conversation, Koch queried DOD 
Deputy Director Rudd about TOW prices. He appar-
ently asked if it would be possible to ship 4,000 Basic 
TOWs to Israel or Iran for $12 million, or at a price 
of $3,000 per TOW. Rudd later told Koch that while 
this quantity was available, the lowest price at which 
basic TOWs had previously been sold was $6,800 per 
missile.163 
In addition to the price, Koch was concerned about 
secrecy and Congressional notification. He knew that 
if the total value of the purchase exceeded $14 mil-
lion, a Congressional notification would be required. 
Rudd told Koch a notification that the Israelis were 
buying 4,000 basic TOWs would be tantamount to 
announcing that the missiles were intended for an-
other purchaser; informed persons would know the 
Israelis would have no use for more basic TOWs than 
it already had.164 
Rudd counseled that the best way to get missiles 
secretly from the Defense Department to Iran would 
be to "go black"?that is, make it a covert operation 
with Defense selling the missiles to the CIA under an 
Economy Act transfer and the CIA transferring them 
to Iran pursuant to an intelligence Finding. Koch 
conveyed this conclusion to North and Weinberger's 
military aide, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell.'" "Going 
black" appeared to overcome two difficulties in the 
replenishment issue: (1) maintaining secrecy and 
avoiding Congressional notification, and (2) avoiding 
the strictures of the AECA. 
On January 12, Koch met the head of the Israeli 
Procurement Mission at National Airport in Washing-
ton to continue negotiations on price. Koch reported

Chapter 11 
on this meeting to North and to Powell, who suggest-
ed that Koch meet with Secretary Weinberger. Koch 
met with the Secretary the next day. He described the 
Secretary as "generally agitated over this" and be-
lieved "this thing . . . was a very foolish undertak-
ing." Koch commented to Secretary Weinberger, 
"Do we have a legal problem with this? Is somebody 
going to go to jail?' and [the Secretary's] response 
was in the affirmative. But I did not take that serious-
ly."166 
In a subsequent conversation with Koch, North ap-
parently expressed a hope that the matter could be 
solved and the initial steps of the operation finished in 
time for the President to refer to the freeing of the 
hostages in his State of the Union message later in 
January. North jotted in his notes: "Try to get results 
by State of Union."167 
Legal Problems Identified With 
Replenishment Approach 
While North continued to work with the Israelis on 
the replenishment problem, CIA lawyers were raising 
legal objections. One prepared a memorandum for 
Sporkin identifying the restrictions and various notifi-
cation requirements that the Arms Export Control 
Act and Foreign Assistance Act placed on third-coun-
try transfers.188 The lawyers concluded that weapons 
that had earlier been acquired from the United States 
under either of these acts could not be sold to Iran 
without "U.S. consent, notice to Congress, and the 
eligibility of the third country recipient for U.S. 
aid."189 Because the planners had determined there 
would be no notice and because Iran's terrorist activi-
ties rendered it ineligible, the Israeli sale/U.S. replen-
ishment approach was not feasible."? However, the 
lawyers concluded that a sale of weapons from DOD 
stocks to the CIA under the Economy Act, followed 
by a CIA sale to Israel or Iran, would be legal. A 
Presidential Finding would be required.'" 
Ghorbanifar Fails Polygraph 
Ghorbanifar returned to Washington in January for 
his new polygraph. The examination was conducted 
at the CIA on January 11 and lasted five hours."2 
The CIA polygraph operator concluded that Ghor-
banifar lied on 13 of 15 items on which he was ques-
tioned."3 According to George, "The only questions 
he passed were his name and his nationality."174 
After the test, a CIA officer reported in a memo-
randum to Casey, McMahon, and Clair George: 
"Ghorbanifar is a fabricator who has deliberately de-
ceived the U.S. Government concerning his informa-
tion and activities. It is recommended that the 
Agency have no dealing whatsoever with Ghorbani-
far."'" Afterwards, Ghorbanifar showed up at Le-
deen's house "furious" and "hurting" because the 
questioning was more expansive than he had expected 
and because he claimed to be physically injured by 
the examination techniques.176 
The following day, the Chief of the CIA's Iran 
branch briefed George and the Chief of the Near East 
Division (C/NE) on the negative results. They in-
structed him to have no further contact with Ghor-
banifar or Ledeen."7 George viewed the polygraph 
results as confirming his view of Ghorbanifar and 
declared to Casey that the Operations Directorate 
would have nothing more to do with the Iranian. He 
told North of this decision on January 13.178 A few 
days later, the Operations Directorate disseminated a 
notice saying the CIA would do no more business 
with Ghorbanifar.179 
Ghorbanifar's polygraph failure, however, did noth-
ing to squelch his relationship with Casey and the 
NSC staff. Indeed, North?who "wanted" Ghorbani-
far to pass180?had braced himself for a negative 
result. He told Ledeen beforehand that the CIA 
would make sure Ghorbanifar flunked because they 
did not want to work with him.181 Casey, notwith-
standing Clair George's advice to terminate the Ghor-
banifar relationship, found a way to deal with Ghor-
banifar outside the normal Operations Directorate 
headed by George. Casey ordered Charles Allen, who 
was the CIA's senior antiterrorism analyst, to meet 
with Ghorbanifar "to determine and make a record of 
all the information that he possessed on terrorism, 
especially that relating to Iranian terrorism?just take 
another look at this individual."82 In George's view, 
Allen virtually became the case officer for Ghorbani-
far.'" To George, there could not have been a 
"better mismatch" between Allen?who had no expe-
rience managing an agent?and Ghorbanifar?who 
was especially "complex" and difficult to control.'" 
Allen spent five hours with Ghorbanifar at Le-
deen's home on January 13 "to assess Subject's access 
to Iranian Government leaders" and to obtain infor-
mation from him on terrorists. Ghorbanifar set out 
several areas in which he wished to work with the 
U.S. Government and the CIA, including the ongoing 
White House effort to gain the release of the hostages 
in Lebanon; the blunting of Iranian-, Libyan-, and 
Syrian-sponsored terrorism; and assisting in the over-
throw of Qadhafi.183 Allen thought some of Ghor-
banifar's specific proposals worth pursuing, but he 
considered several of them outlandish, not worthy of 
exploration, and "very, very filled with hyperbo-
le."188 
During this session, Ghorbanifar told Allen that 
funds generated through the projects he was discuss-
ing could be used for "011ie's boys in Central Amer-
ica."87 Allen recorded this remark in his handwrit-
ten notes of the meeting as "can fund Contras."88 
He did not, however, refer to it in his memorandum 
to Casey and others on the session.189 He later ex-
plained that at the time he did not "consider it impor-
tant or even relevant to my particular mission," that

Chapter 11 
he did not discuss it with anyone else, and that he 
"promptly forgot it."195 
On January 14, Allen briefed Casey on his session 
with Ghorbanifar. He told Casey that Ghorbanifar 
was "very hard to pin down," "very flamboyant," 
"very clever, cunning." Indeed, Allen called him a 
"con man," to which Casey jokingly responded: 
"Maybe this is a con man's con man then." For the 
moment, Allen said, he was given no further assign-
ment concerning Ghorbanifar.'91 
Restructuring the Deal 
In mid-January, the plan for the operation was re-
structured in two significant respects. First, weapons 
to be shipped to Iran would come from U.S.?not 
Israeli?stocks. Second, at the direction of Poindexter, 
Casey, and North, Richard Secord was brought into 
the operation as a "commercial cut-out": a conduit for 
the money to be paid by Iran to the United States for 
the missiles. This latter change enabled the "diver-
sion" of funds to support the Contras, which had 
already begun in November with the use of a part of 
the Israelis' $1 million deposit to Lake Resources, to 
continue in a more direct manner. 
A one-page, unsigned memorandum dated January 
13, 1986, updated Casey on the "TOW for Hostage 
deal." The memorandum shows that legal obstacles 
and the high cost of Improved TOW missiles were 
pushing the planners toward transforming the deal 
into one in which the Iranians would receive basic 
TOWs sold by DOD to CIA under the Economy 
Act. After a review of the problems with other meth-
ods, the memorandum stated: 
Therefore they want to use the second option 
under which CIA would buy 4,000 basic TOWs 
from DOD for $21 million. As far as Defense is 
concerned these purchases would be for general 
CIA uses. . . . The money for the Iranian ac-
count would be transferred to the Israelis. The 
Israelis would transfer that money to a CIA ac-
count to pay for this purchase of the Tows from 
DoD, the shippers would move the Tows to the 
Israelis who would then move them on to the 
Iranians.192 
North met with Ledeen and Ghorbanifar that 
evening to discuss the plan. Ghorbanifar proposed 
that he would buy the TOWs from the United 
States?rather than from Israel?for $10,500 each. He 
said this was the same price he had paid the Israelis 
for the 504 TOWs in 1985. Ghorbanifar stated that he 
had "officially offered" the same rate to the Israelis 
for this deal, but that they now were asking for differ-
ent terms. Ghorbanifar said that he had $4.0 million 
for the 4,000 TOWs, and that out of that sum he 
expected to receive?or at least wanted?$500,000. 
Ghorbanifar also explained that the total deal, negoti-
ated with Nir before Christmas, called for the Israeli-
206 
U.S. side to provide 4,000 TOWs, the release of 100 
Hizballah prisoners held by the Southern Lebanon 
Army, and intelligence.193 
After this meeting, North called Koch and raised 
the idea of designating Secord as the person to whom 
the United States would sell the TOWs. North's notes 
suggest that DOD would sell missiles directly to 
Secord with no involvement of the CIA and that 
Secord would deliver the TOWs to the Israelis.'" 
On the morning of January 14, North received a call 
back from Koch who expressed concern about how 
Secretary Weinberger would react to using Secord. 
North's notes of the call state: "Secretary will 
blanch." 95 
Both Poindexter and Casey, however, approved Se-
cord's pivotal role in the operation. According to 
Secord, Poindexter invited him to the White House, 
told him the President had approved a renewed arms 
transaction with Iran, and asked for his assistance."6 
On January 14, Casey told North, according to 
North's notes, that "Secord Op [is] 0.K."127 
North met with Poindexter that evening. They dis-
cussed inserting Secord into the transaction as an 
"agent for the CIA. . . ."198 Under this arrangement, 
the Iranians would receive missiles from Israeli 
stocks; and Secord, acting as an agent for the CIA, 
would simultaneously buy basic TOW missiles from 
DOD and sell and ship them to Israel as replace-
ments. The CIA would not actively participate in the 
operation. Poindexter directed North to discuss this 
approach with Casey.122 This plan called for the pri-
vate North/Secord enterprise in lieu of the CIA. The 
CIA would have a role in name only. The Economy 
Act authorized intergovernmental transfers of weap-
ons, but would not permit DOD to sell directly to 
Secord unless he were designated an "agent" of the 
CIA. 
The barrier to the plan was Secretary Weinberger. 
Although Casey was on board, Secretary Weinberger 
continued to raise objections both to the plan and to 
Secord's involvement. In a PROF message to Poin-
dexter on January 15, North wrote: 
Casey believes that Cap [Weinberger] will contin-
ue to create roadblocks until he is told by you 
that the President wants this to move NOW and 
that Cap will have to make it work. Casey points 
out that we have now gone through three differ-
ent methodologies in an effort to satisfy Cap's 
concerns and that no matter what we do there is 
always a new objection. As far as Casey is con-
cerned our earlier method of having Copp 
[Secord] deal directly with the DoD as a pur-
chasing agent was fine. He did not see any par-
ticular problem w/ making Copp an agent for the 
CIA in this endeavor but he is concerned that 
Cap will find some new objection unless he is 
told to proceed.20?

Chapter 11 
In the same PROF message, North indicated that 
the "most recent proposal" to use Secord as an agent 
for the CIA depended on the Israelis' agreeing to pay 
a higher price than they were then offering the 
United States. The message suggests that North, 
knowing that Ghorbanifar was willing to pay $10,000 
a TOW to the Israelis, was seeking to have more of 
the residual profit flow to the American side rather 
than to Schwimmer and Nimrodi. 
Minutes after writing this PROF message, North 
met with Sporkin to discuss Secord's role."' Sporkin 
interrupted this meeting to telephone one of his staff 
lawyers, George Clarke, to discuss whether there 
would be any "problems or reporting requirements" 
with the North/Poindexter proposal to use Secord as 
an "agent" of the CIA but to otherwise leave the 
CIA out of the operation.202 North came on the line 
to exhort Clarke to endorse this approach.203 Ac-
cording to a "memorandum for the record" written 
by Clarke, the conversation went as follows: 
1. At approximately 1420 hours today I received 
a secure line telephone call from the General 
Counsel. He wanted to discuss whether I saw 
any problems or reporting requirements with a 
proposal to have DoD provide weapons to a 
CIA "agent" who would pay for the weapons 
with money supplied by a friendly third country. 
The agent would then supply the weapons to the 
intended recipient country. The agent would 
have no connection with CIA other than to act 
as a "middle man" with our authority. 
2. I told the General Counsel that I would feel 
more comfortable if CIA were directly involved 
in the activity and that it would be essential that 
we act in furtherance of a traditional covert 
action objective. . . . 
3. Despite repeated urgings to concur in vari-
ations that would have DoD provide the weap-
ons without other than token CIA involvement, I 
did not do so. . . .203a 
Sporkin recalled an "argument with one of my 
people" about whether there was a way to structure 
the transaction without the CIA's getting involved. 
"The answer was no way.19 2 0 4 
After this meeting, Sporkin prepared a paper for 
Casey. He advised that the "preferred way to handle 
the proposal" was for the CIA to take control of the 
materiel through an Economy Act transfer from 
DOD before it was moved to the Middle East. Spor-
kin wrote that he could find no precedent for the 
purchase of materiel from DOD by someone acting as 
a CIA "agent," where the CIA had no other role in 
the transaction. Sporkin's paper did not address 
whether the CIA, after acquiring the arms from 
DOD, could deal with an intermediary, such as 
Secord, rather than directly with the foreign country 
recipient.205 One of Sporkin's main concerns was the 
question of notifying Congress: 
The key issue in this entire matter revolves 
around whether or not there will be reports made 
to Congress. Each of the Acts involved?the 
Foreign Assistance Act, the Arms Export Con-
trol Act, and indeed the National Security Act as 
amended?have certain reporting provisions in 
them. While the National Security Act provides 
for a certain limited reporting procedure, it is my 
view that there may be other ways of making a 
suitable report by exercise of the President's con-
stitutional prerogatives. 
One such possibility would be not to report the 
activity until after it has been successfully con-
cluded and to brief only the chairman and rank-
ing minority members of the two Oversight Com-
mittees. This would maximize the security of the 
mission and reduce the possibility of its prema-
ture disclosure.206 
Later that afternoon, North spoke again with Sporkin, 
who urged that the "final proposal" be "run by" the 
Attorney Genera1.207 
At 2:30 p.m. that day, North received a call from 
Nir. The conversation again focused on the financial 
aspects of the transaction. North's notes refer to a 25 
percent cut to be paid to "other Iranians" and a 15 
percent cut to "accountant," the code name for 
Schwimmer. Most significantly, the two discussed Se-
cord's receiving more for the TOWs than he would 
have to pay to DOD. North wrote: "7500 each to 
Copp. 5300 each to DOD.'9208 Using these figures, 
and assuming that the deal would involve 4,000 
TOWs, Secord would receive $8.8 million over his 
cost of buying the missiles from DOD. 
The next day, January 16, North continued to try 
to find a way to start the part of the operation that 
would lead to the release of the American hostages, 
namely, the shipment of 1,000 TOWs to Iran. At 
Poindexter's request, North first contacted McFarlane 
to find out what the understanding had been on re-
plenishment of the first 504 TOWs, an issue that con-
tinued to be a sticking point for Israel. McFarlane 
replied that the United States had undertaken to sell, 
over time, "requisite TOWs to replace the TOWs that 
they sent for Weir."2" In his notes of this phone call, 
North wrote: "The objection in law [is] based on 
Arms Export Control Act."2" North passed this in-
formation to Poindexter, along with an explanation 
that replenishment had been blocked because the Is-
raelis lacked sufficient funds to purchase Improved-
TOWs and because bureaucratic problems had pre-
vented a purchase of basic TOWs.2" 
North came up with a modified plan to get the 
operation moving. He proposed to Poindexter that 
Nir deal directly with Ghorbanifar and receive $10

million for the first 1,000 TOWs to be shipped by 
Israel. Schwimmer and the Iranian officials would be 
"cut-out" from the expected profits, and a much 
larger sum would be available to Nir for replenish-
ment or other uses. North also proposed that Secord 
purchase 504 TOWs from the United States and ship 
them to Israel as replenishment for the 1985 transac-
tions.21 2 
That same afternoon, Poindexter convened in his 
office a meeting of senior administration officials to 
discuss the structuring of the transaction, the continu-
ing objections of Secretary Weinberger, and the pro-
posed Finding.2" Present were Secretary Weinberg-
er, Casey, Attorney General Meese, Sporkin, and pos-
sibly North.2 14* The Attorney General said Israel 
should not ship weapons out of its stocks and recom-
mended that the United States instead sell directly to 
the Iranians. Restructuring the operation in this way, 
he explained, would avoid the restrictions of the 
Arms Export Control Act, including Congressional 
reporting requirements.21 5 
Sporkin recalled that no decision was made at the 
meeting and that Secretary Weinberger wanted addi-
tional time to examine the revised structure of the 
plan: 
[A]s we were breaking up, the Secretary of De-
fense said that I want to review all this. I want to 
have my lawyers look at it and to see if that 
analysis is correct. And so the meeting broke up 
without there being any decision made. 
The next day, I received a call from the Direc-
tor?I think it was the next day?in which he 
said that he received a call from the?from the 
Secretary of Defense, who said that his people 
have looked it over and they agree with the 
analysis and they have signed off on the 
project.21 6 
Secretary Weinberger was unable to recall, or find 
anyone at the Defense Department who had per-
formed, any such legal review. 
President Signs A New Finding 
Poindexter now arranged to get the President to 
sign the Finding. At the January 17, 1986 national 
security briefing attended by the President, the Vice 
President, Regan, Poindexter, and Fortier, Poindexter 
discussed the plans and referred to a new cover 
memorandum. The President did not read the memo-
randum, but he signed the Finding. To indicate the 
President's decision, Poindexter wrote "RR per JMP" 
? Poindexter recalled that Shultz was also present. Poindexter 
Test., Hearings, 100-8, at 35. Shultz testified that he was not, Shultz 
Test., Hearings, 100-9, at 33, and Sporkin testified that he was told 
Shultz had been invited but could not make it. Sporkin Test., 
Hearings, 100-6, at 149. Weinberger had no recollection of attend-
ing this meeting. Weinberger Test., Hearings, 100-10, at 141. 
208 
on the approval line of the memorandum. At the 
bottom of the memorandum, he also wrote: "Presi-
dent was briefed verbally from this paper. VP, Don 
Regan and Don Fortier were present."217 
The January 17 Finding was almost identical to the 
draft Finding presented to the President on January 6. 
The only change was the insertion of the words 
"third parties" in the list of entities to be assisted by 
the CIA.218 The Committees have received from 
NSC files a copy of the January 6 version of the 
Finding that bears Sporlcin's handwritten insertion of 
this phrase.2" Sporkin testified that this change was 
made merely to make the first paragraph of the Find-
ing symmetrical with the second, which already con-
tained a reference to "third parties." He said that the 
term did not refer to Secord but to Ghorbanifar and 
other Iranian intermediaries.2 2 
The cover memorandum, which North prepared 
and Poindexter signed, contained the same summary 
of the Nir proposal that North had included in his 
January 4 draft cover memorandum. However, the 
new memorandum stated that for legal reasons the 
operation should not be conducted as Nir proposed 
and should instead proceed with sales of arms from 
the CIA through an agent directly to Iran. Following 
the advice Attorney General Meese had provided the 
previous day, the memorandum stated: 
We have researched the legal problems of Israel's 
selling U.S. manufactured arms to Iran. Because 
of the requirement in U.S. law for recipients of 
U.S. arms to notify the U.S. government of trans-
fers to third countries, I do not recommend that 
you agree with the specific details of the Israeli 
plan. 
The memorandum outlined the new plan to make 
direct sales from the CIA to Iran through Secord, 
who was identified only as "an authorized agent": 
The objectives of the Israeli plan could be met 
if the CIA, using an authorized agent as neces-
sary, purchased arms from the Department of 
Defense under the Economy Act and then trans-
ferred them to Iran directly after receiving ap-
propriate payment from Iran. 
This new method was to accomplish the 4,000-TOW 
transaction that Nir had originally proposed. The 
memorandum stated: 
Therefore it is proposed that Israel make the 
necessary arrangements for the sale of 4000 TOW 
weapons to Iran. Sufficient funds to cover the 
sale would be transferred to an agent of the CIA. 
The CIA would then purchase the weapons from 
the Department of Defense and deliver the weap-
ons to Iran through the agent. If all the hostages 
are not released after the first shipment of 1000 
weapons, further transfers would cease.221

Chapter 11 
As was the case with North's earlier draft, the 
cover memorandum to the President from Poindexter 
stated that "[t]he Israelis are very concerned [about] 
Iran's deteriorating position in the war with Iraq" and 
"believe it is essential that [Israel] act to at least 
preserve a balance of power in the region." In fact, 
Secretaries Weinberger and Shultz and Deputy Direc-
tor McMahon all subsequently testified that this as-
sessment of the state of the Iran-Iraq conflict was 
contrary to U.S. intelligence estimates. Secretary 
Weinberger stated: 
I certainly did not have the view that Iraq was 
winning or anything of that kind. Quite to the 
contrary. As a matter of fact, it was basically 
Iraqi military strategy not to pursue any kind of 
decisive military end. . 
Secretary Shultz said that while there was an intelli-
gence estimate in mid-1985 suggesting that the Iranian 
position was deteriorating, he and others in the State 
Department had objected to it and by early 1986 
there was a "reassessment" to the effect that Iran was 
viewed as "very much the aggressive country in the 
war."223 McMahon made the same point: "I don't 
have the vaguest idea where Poindexter got the idea 
that the Iraqis were about to take over Tehran. It just 
wasn't in the cards. 
9,224 
The cover memorandum also gave the President a 
lineup of the varying positions of his advisers on the 
proposed operation: 
You have discussed the general outlines of the 
Israeli plan with Secretaries Shultz and Wein-
berger, Attorney General Meese and Director 
Casey. The Secretaries do not recommend you 
proceed with this plan. Attorney General Meese 
and Director Casey believe the short-term and 
long-term objectives of the plan warrant the 
policy risks involved and recommend you ap-
prove the attached Finding.226 
Defense Secretary Weinberger testified to the Com-
mittees that he was unaware that a Finding had been 
signed.226 However, he recalled that around January 
18, Poindexter told him the President had decided to 
sell 4,000 TOW missiles to Iran and instructed him to 
make the missiles available.227 
Secretary of State Shultz testified he was unaware 
even of the Presidential decision to sell the weapons. 
He recalled a luncheon with the President's other top 
advisers on January 17, during which he expressed 
opposition to what he thought was still an unap-
proved plan to sell weapons to Iran.228 
According to the Tower Board, in his diary entry 
for January 17, 1986, the President wrote: "I agreed 
to sell TOWs to Iran."226 
Conclusion 
With the signing of the Finding, the Administration 
was embarked on an arms-for-hostages initiative with 
Iran in which the United States?not Israel?would 
play the lead role. The President set this course over 
the continued objections of his Secretaries of Defense 
and State, and notwithstanding the CIA's renewed 
determination that the Iranian intermediary, Ghorban-
ifar, could not be trusted. 
In a change from the 1985 arms deals, Poindexter, 
Casey, and North had structured the transactions 
planned for 1986 in a manner that would leave the 
United States in possession and control of the large 
"residuals" that would flow from the sales. Secord 
and the Lake Resources Enterprise were established 
as a conduit for the money paid for the missiles by 
Iran. North and Nir had several ideas about how 
these profits would be used. Foremost in North's 
mind was the potential for diversions to the Contra 
effort.

Chapter 12 
Arms Sales to Iran: The United States Takes 
Control 
The President's decision to sign the Finding on 
Friday, January 17, 1986, marked the beginning of 
U.S. control over the Iran arms sales initiative. In 
November 1985, the United States had acted as a 
necessary and supporting player to the Israeli plan to 
ship weapons; the January 17 Finding established that 
weapons from U.S. stocks would be transported and 
sold under U.S. control. 
The Finding also brought the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) into the initiative in a more substantial 
way than it had been in the prior shipment. Yet de-
spite the Finding, the CIA would continue to play 
only a supporting role to the National Security Coun-
cil (NSC)-sponsored initiative. While providing logis-
tic and technical support?and a mechanism for get-
ting the weapons from the Department of Defense 
(DOD) under the Economy Act?the CIA deferred 
to the NSC staff in evaluating the reliability of the 
intermediaries and the likelihood of success of the 
initiative. 
Over the next few months, negotiations among the 
Iranian representatives, the intermediary, and the 
American officials continued. The pattern established 
in the 1985 sales would continue. In February, the 
United States sold 1,000 TOW missiles to Iran and no 
hostages were released. Instead, the Iranians insisted 
on the sale of HAWK spare parts and the United 
States agreed. 
Although the arms sales were a failure in achieving 
the goals set forth in the Finding, they were success-
ful in another way. The Iranians were willing to pay 
substantially more for the military goods than they 
cost, and part of the excess filled the bank account of 
the Enterprise. As North testified, the possibility of 
using these profits to aid the Contras provided addi-
tional incentive to pursue the Iranian initiative. 
The Finding Is Implemented 
On January 18, CIA General Counsel Stanley Spor-
kin, CIA Deputy Director for Operations Clair 
George, and the CIA Deputy Chief of the Near East 
Division (DC/NE) met in the White House Situation 
Room with National Security Adviser John Poin-
dexter, Oliver North, and Richard Secord to define 
the Agency's responsibilities. Poindexter and North 
told the CIA representatives that the Finding had 
been signed and discussed with them the CIA's role in 
the arms sales initiative. The CIA's "point man," DC/ 
NE, was to arrange for the Agency to acquire 4,000 
TOW missiles from the DOD for sale to Iran. He was 
also instructed to establish a CIA account through 
which funds could be delivered to the Department of 
Defense for purchase of the missiles.' Although the 
Finding was directed to the CIA, the Agency's re-
sponsibilities as outlined at the meeting put it in a role 
of lending logistic support for the NSC staff, which 
would be principally conducting the negotiations. 
DC/NE recalled that the group discussed a provi-
sion in the Finding that instructed the CIA Director 
not to notify Congress of the covert activity: 
I think Admiral Poindexter did say that this was 
a very sensitive undertaking . . . and that the 
President felt very strongly that the Congress 
would not be notified until a later date. I took 
that later date to mean after the hostages were 
released . . . that after the delivery of the first 
shipment of TOWs the hostages would be re-
leased, meaning all of the American hostages in 
Lebanon. So we were looking at this . . . as a 
fairly short-termed thing.2 
At the January 18 meeting, George met Secord for 
the first time when Secord was introduced as a con-
sultant to the NSC.3 George knew of Secord's past 
association with Edwin Wilson, the former CIA offi-
cer who was then serving time in a Federal prison for 
a variety of offenses. George was concerned about 
Secord's involvement and following the January 18 
meeting advised Director Casey of his opinion.4 
George cautioned Casey: "If they are going to ship 
arms to Iran for hostages . . . don't use Secord."5 
George expressed even greater disapproval when 
he discovered that Iranian intermediary Manucher 
Ghorbanifar was to be involved. The exact point at 
which George became aware of Ghorbanifar's role in 
the Iran initiative is unknown, although he implied in 
testimony that he knew either as a result of, or short-
ly following, the January 18 meeting. Shortly after 
Ghorbanifar failed a CIA polygraph test on January

Chapter 12 
11, 1986, George issued a "field notice"* to senior 
CIA officials in Europe instructing them to avoid 
dealing with Ghorbanifar. Only a few days later 
while in the White House, George was "given the 
Finding to which, surprise, surprise, the guy I am 
going to be dealing with or supporting the National 
Security Council to deal with, is Ghorbanifar."6 
Prior to the signing of the January 17 Finding, 
George advised North of Ghorbanifar's polygraph 
test results. He also recalled warning Casey against 
dealing with Ghorbanifar, but "before I could go 
through one more fight about Mr. Ghorbanifar, [the 
CIA] received a Presidential order which . . . ended 
up meaning we were dealing with Mr. Ghorbanifar." 
Eventually, Casey designated Charles Allen to over-
see Ghorbanifar's activities.7 
North told the CIA officers that the arms sales 
were imminent. DC/NE moved quickly to implement 
the plan: on January 20, he instructed the CIA Direc-
tor of Finance to designate a Swiss bank account that 
could be used immediately for a large deposit. The 
finance officer identified a Swiss account number, 
which DC/NE later forwarded to the NSC. A 
"clean," or unused, account was originally requested 
to avoid commingling funds from the sale of TOWs 
with those used for other Agency purposes. Because 
the Agency's finance officers needed several days to 
open a clean account, DC/NE decided to use an 
existing CIA account customarily available for large 
transactions. 8 
DC/NE told his finance officers to expect a deposit 
of $30 million. He based this figure on an estimate he 
had received from DOD of approximately $6,000 per 
TOW and indicated that the deposit would come 
from a "private source." 
DC/NE asked North for a contact at DOD with 
whom he could arrange to obtain the TOWs. North 
told DC/NE to contact Secretary Weinberger's mili-
tary aide, then-Maj. Gen. Colin Powell. When DC/ 
NE telephoned Powell several days later, the general 
explained that he was aware of the sensitivity of the 
operation, knew where the weapons were to be deliv-
ered, and knew the covert activity was supported by 
a Finding. Powell named Lt. Gen. Vincent M. Russo 
as the CIA's contact at 
Russo told DC/NE originally that the price would 
be around $6,000 per TOW, a price with which 
North had problems. DC/NE recalled North's reac-
tion to that figure: 
The initial price was precisely?it was Russo tell-
ing me it was going to be something around 
6,000 per. And I recall telling North that and he 
recalled?it doesn't make any difference to me 
[DC/NE] whether they charge three or six or 
*A "field notice" is a fabricator warning issued to specific CIA 
stations, as opposed to a "burn notice," which receives world-wide 
CIA distribution. 
214 
nine?I recall North saying, 'well, that is too 
high, they must be giving you a brand new mis-
sile replacement cost figure, and they should be 
charging for the oldest model TOW in stock. We 
don't care if these things in fact work real well. 
Tell the Army that we want the oldest thing they 
can find in the warehouse.' So I went back to 
Russo and said, let me make clear that we don't 
need the very best, latest thing right off the fac-
tory line. 
The eventual price was approximately $3,400 per 
TOW, including freight costs." 
North's attitude that he did not "care if these things 
in fact work real well" is inconsistent with the goals 
of opening a broader initiative with Iran and freeing 
the hostages. Demonstrably antiquated or unworkable 
merchandise most likely would promote distrust; 
indeed, the controversy over the November 1985 
HAWK shipment had been caused in part by the 
Iranians' claim that the 18 HAWKs did not meet their 
expectations. 
DC/NE next directed a CIA logistics officer to 
coordinate through the Defense Department for the 
TOW purchases. DC/NE told the officer that the 
weapons transfer was a direct arms-for-hostages ex-
change that would occur soon. The officer stated that 
the proposed price of the TOWs?$6,000 each?was a 
reasonable cost for the improved version of the mis-
sile. Upon contacting Russo, however, he learned that 
the CIA could obtain the basic TOW, the oldest one 
in the Army's stocks, for approximately $3,400 per 
missile.' 2 
On January 20, North noted: "Price must be firm 
for Defense [Department]?Must be less than 6K." 
Under the figure showing 4,504 TOWs, North jotted, 
"Nir knows 10K upper limit?Dick [Secord] arrange 
w/Nir"." The notes suggest that Nir and North had 
agreed that the TOWs sold to Iran must not exceed 
$10,000 per unit but that the CIA would not pay 
more than the original DOD price of $6,000 per 
TOW. In the plan to sell 1,000 of the missiles to Iran 
in February, North and Nir were expecting to obtain 
$4 million above the cost of the missiles. When North 
learned he could obtain the basic TOW for substan-
tially less, the anticipated profit for the Enterprise 
increased. 
The Army Executes the Tasking 
On January 18, Powell telephoned Gen. Maxwell 
R. Thurman, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, with a 
secret, "close hold" assignment for the Army: to pre-
pare 4,000 basic TOW missiles to be shipped to the 
CIA." Within a week, the number was increased to 
4,508 to cover the 508 missiles" Israel had shipped in 
September that McFarlane had agreed to replenish. 
Thurman, who was not told the ultimate destination

of the missiles or the purpose of the shipment, dele-
gated the responsibility down the chain of com-
mand" and ultimately to Maj. Christopher Simp-
son.' 7 
The instructions were to maintain a degree of secre-
cy unusual even for weapon transfers to the CIA: no 
notes; communications only by secure telephone or 
face to face; and the number of people privy to the 
operation kept to a minimum. The imposition of such 
extraordinary secrecy led the Army to bypass its 
normal system for interagency transfers, with that sys-
tem's safeguards against underpricing, depleting stock-
piles, and affecting defense readiness." Even though 
the secrecy guidelines were strictly observed, an ap-
parently accidental error in the price became crucial. 
By inadvertently using the wrong stock number for 
the TOW, the Army underpriced the missile and cre-
ated a price differential broad enough to generate a 
significant surplus of funds for the Enterprise. 
Pricing the TOW Missiles 
Simpson went directly to the TOW Project Manag-
er at the Army Missile Command at Redstone Arse-
nal in Huntsville, Alabama. Powell had been asked to 
provide a "basic," or "vanilla," TOW?one that had 
not been manufactured since 1975. The basic TOW, 
however, had experienced mechanical problems that 
required the Army to make design modifications." 
The TOW Deputy Project Manager informed Simp-
son he had sufficient basic TOWs to meet the order 
but that the TOWs needed the safety modification, 
which would add to the expense.2? 
Simpson set about pricing the TOWs in what 
seemed to be a logical manner?he checked the 
Army's catalogue of inventoried items, complete with 
national stock numbers and prices. Simpson found the 
price to be $3,169 for a basic TOW, to which he 
estimated an additional $300 for the safety modifica-
tion?a total of $3,469 per missile. Simpson quoted 
that price to the CIA.21 
There were, however, eight different models of 
TOWs listed in the catalogue. Unknown to Simpson, 
when safety modifications became a required feature, 
the Army created a new stock number for the basic 
TOW with the modification and a corresponding 
new, and much higher, price. Using the correct stock 
number, the Army should have provided the CIA a 
cost of $8,435 per missile.22 
Although Simpson's testimony is inconsistent on the 
question of whether he was aware that the Army 
catalogue price for the basic TOW with modifications 
was $8,435, there are indications that some officials in 
the Army became aware of the erroneous price. The 
original paperwork providing for the transfer of the 
TOWs from their storage depot carried the correct 
price, $8,435, not the $3,469 price that Simpson had 
computed. As the TOWs traveled from the depot to 
Redstone Arsenal, the price was dropped from the 
accompanying documentation. By the time the CIA 
received the first shipment of missiles, the receipt 
reflected Simpson's price of $3,469. Indeed, while the 
transfer documents accompanying the first and third 
shipments from the Army and the CIA carried the 
Simpson price, the receipts for the second shipment 
did not reflect any price. Testimony from Army offi-
cials about the changing prices in these documents has 
been inconsistent and inconclusive. 
Amid the pricing confusion, the CIA received a 
better missile than it had bargained for. While the 
Army had basic TOWs in stock, it did not have 
sufficient parts to perform the safety modification. It 
tried to sell the CIA a more expensive and later 
version of the TOW, the improved TOW, or "I-
TOW," which did not require modification. However, 
the CIA would not pay more than the quoted price of 
$3,469. As a result, the Army had to alter the TOW 
package, selling the I-TOW launch motor with the 
basic TOW warhead, which produced a superior 
product.2 3 
Army officials included in these pricing decisions 
have denied any intent to lower the price of the 
TOWs, and the Committees have found no evidence 
to the contrary. What is apparent, however, is that in 
fulfilling the CIA request for TOWs in early 1986, the 
Army bypassed its usual method of obtaining, pricing, 
and transferring weapons. The emphasis on keeping 
the transaction secret, even from those involved in 
the process, led to a significant pricing error, one that 
North exploited to the advantage of the Enterprise. 
Without this pricing error, there would have been a 
much smaller difference between the $10,000 per 
TOW Ghorbanifar was willing to pay and the actual 
cost of the TOWs?and the diverted profits to the 
Enterprise would have been minimal. 
The London Meeting 
Armed with a low, firm price for the TOWs, 
North, Secord, and Amiram Nir, an adviser to Israeli 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, met with Ghorbanifar 
in London on January 22, their first meeting follow-
ing the President's approval of the Finding. North 
expressed reservations about the operation, explaining 
that the United States desired a more moderate Irani-
an regime, a cessation of terrorism by Iran, and the 
return of the American hostages. In his notes of that 
date, North recorded a plan that included, in addition 
to TOWs and intelligence, the release of Hizballah 
prisoners held by the Southern Lebanon Army for 
hostages:

Hizb[allah] Prisoners from [Southern Lebanon 
Army] -= hostage release.24 
North testified that he was dissatisfied with the 
notion of selling weapons to Iran until this meeting 
with Ghorbanifar.25 North's stated reluctance is in-
consistent with the testimony of Sporkin and others, 
who described North as a strong advocate for the 
plan and a leader in getting it adopted by the Presi-
dent." Nevertheless, according to North, the induce-
ment that caused him to embrace the plan was a 
suggestion by Ghorbanifar to divert profits from the 
arms sales to the Contra forces. 
North described his conversation with Ghorbanifar 
during a lull in the London meetings: 
Mr. Ghorbanifar took me into the bathroom and 
Mr. Ghorbanifar suggested several incentives to 
make that February [TOW] transaction work, 
and the attractive incentive for me was the one 
he made that residuals could flow to support the 
Nicaraguan resistance. He made it point blank 
and he made it by my understanding with the full 
knowledge and acquiescence and support, if not 
the original idea of the Israeli intelligence serv-
ices, the Israeli Government . . . I think you have 
seen it in my messages to my superiors, I was not 
entirely comfortable with the arrangements that 
had been worked in the summer of 1985 and in 
the autumn and winter of 1985. I made it very 
clear. I was after all the person who had the 
responsibility for coordinating our counterterror-
ist policy. I had written for the President's 
words, "We will not make concessions to terror-
ists." For the very first time in January, the 
whole idea of using U.S. weapons or U.S.-origin 
weapons or Israeli weapons that had been manu-
factured in the United States was made more 
palatable. I must confess to you that I thought 
using the Ayatollah's money to support the Nica-
raguan resistance was the right idea and I must 
confess to you that I advocated that.27 
The tape recording of that meeting does not reflect 
the private conversation which North described. In-
stead, it reveals that Ghorbanifar discussed assisting 
the Contras openly, in the presence of North, Nir, 
and Secord: 
GHORBANIFAR: "I think this is now, 011ie, 
the best chance because we never would have 
found such a good time, we never get such good 
money out of this. [Laughingly] We do every-
thing. We do hostages free of charge; we do all 
terrorists free of charge; Central America for you 
free of charge; American business free of charge; 
[First Iranian Official] visit. Everything free." 
NORTH: "I would like to see, . . . some point 
this, uh, idea, and maybe, y'know, if there is 
some future opportunity for Central America. 
216 
You know that there is a lot of Libyan, a lot of 
Libyan and Iranian activity with the Nicara-
guans." 2 8 
McFarlane had been disgusted with Ghorbanifar's 
direct linkage of hostages to arms in the December 
1985 London meeting. The trading was even more 
explicit in January 1986. The tape reflects that Ghor-
banifar demanded that 100 prisoners held by the 
Southern Lebanon Army be released as part of the 
quid pro quo for the American hostages. When Nir 
explained that the Southern Lebanon Army held 
fewer than 50 prisoners, Ghorbanifar demanded that 
50 be released even if more prisoners had to be taken 
in order to release that number." 
Poindexter declared that he first learned of the pos-
sibility of diverting arms sales proceeds from North in 
early February 1986. He said that following North's 
meetings in London, North briefed him on progress 
being made domestically by CIA and DOD in pro-
curing TOW missiles. Poindexter recalled North casu-
ally mentioning, "Admiral, I think I have found a 
way that we can provide some funds to the democrat-
ic resistance [Contras] through funds that will accrue 
from the sale of arms to the Iranians." Poindexter 
claimed that he considered the diversion to be "a 
very good idea" that he approved orally after only a 
few minutes conversation.30 
Poindexter stated that the diversion was merely an 
implementation of the President's policy and a deci-
sion Poindexter had authority to make without con-
sulting the President. Nevertheless, Poindexter admit-
ted knowing that public revelation of the diversion's 
approval by him would result in his leaving the Ad-
ministration, although he said that he "probably un-
derestimated" the effect public knowledge of the op-
eration would eventually have on the Administra-
tion." Poindexter stated that he made the diversion 
decision without consulting the President in order to 
give the President "deniability." He acknowledged, 
however, that he had never acted that way before 
and that he had a reputation for keeping his superiors 
informed.3 2 
What had begun as an initiative to obtain the re-
lease of the American hostages had now assumed a 
second, inherently conflicting goal. The Finding set 
forth a policy of selling weapons in order to obtain 
the release of hostages and to secure an opening to 
Iran. Use of the arms sales to aid the Contras created 
an incentive to charge the highest price the Iranians 
would pay while selling the least expensive equip-
ment, a policy unlikely to win Iranian confidence or 
the hostages' freedom. 
On January 24, North prepared a sophisticated "no-
tional timeline" for Poindexter under the name "Oper-
ation Recovery," which proposed the transfer of 
TOW missiles and intelligence information to Iran in 
exchange for the release of the American hostages.

Chapter 12 
"Operation Recovery" reflected the ambitions of the 
planners who recently met in London. An agreement 
was reached that the TOWs were to be shipped to 
Iran in four increments of 1,000 missiles, with an 
additional 508 TOWs delivered to Israel as replenish-
ment for that country's stocks. On February 8, the 
Southern Lebanon Army was to release 25 Hizballah 
prisoners after Iran received the first 1,000 TOWs. On 
February 9, "all U.S. Hostages [were to be] released 
to the U.S./British or Swiss Embassy" and "a second 
group of Hizballah [was to be] released by [the South-
ern Lebanon Army]." The following day, as prepara-
tions were underway to deliver the second increment 
of TOWs to Iran, Hizballah was to release certain 
other hostages. The notional timeline also made refer-
ence to another ambition of the planners: "February 
11, Khomeini steps down." Following this sequential 
release of prisoners for arms, the United States would 
deliver the final two increments of missiles. The last 
deliveries were to be in exchange for hostages of 
other nationalities and the recovery of hostage Wil-
liam Buckley's remains.33 
Logistical arrangements for the TOW shipment 
soon began to materialize: North communicated with 
DC/NE about DOD pricing, and Secord evaluated 
technical requirements for the Southern Air Transport 
707s for transporting the arms to Israel. On January 
27, North received confirmation of a TOW price 
from DC/NE which covered the shipment of 1,000 
TOW missiles: "$3,469 per item for all units?load out 
cost: for all costs: $3,700,000."34 
On the evening of January 29 in the Old Executive 
Office Building, North held his first meeting of indi-
viduals involved in the Iran initiative: Noel Koch of 
DOD, Allen and DC/NE of CIA, and Richard 
Secord. DC/NE had thought he was the sole CIA 
contact in the NSC operation, but he learned at the 
meeting that another CIA officer, Allen, was already 
involved. The discussion turned to logistical require-
ments. The CIA was responsible for transporting the 
TOWs from domestic storage facilities to Kelly Air 
Force Base in Texas, where Secord would accept 
delivery and fly them via Southern Air Transport in 
two separate shipments to Israel. Secord would ar-
range for Southern Air Transport personnel to fly the 
cargoes on Israeli chartered aircraft from Tel Aviv to 
Bandar Abbas, Iran, as originally agreed with the 
Government of Iran." 
Both North and Secord described Secord's role as a 
"commercial cut-out." As North testified, Secord: 
. . . negotiat[ed] prices, delivery schedules, ar-
rangements, and General Secord then became the 
person who went back and paid the Government 
of the United States, through the CIA, exactly 
what the Government of the United States 
wanted for the commodities that it provided . . . 
General Secord was an outside entity who had 
been established as an outside entity many, many 
months before in order to support the Nicaraguan 
resistance.3 6 
DC/NE agreed with using Secord as the cut-out 
because "I wasn't particularly anxious for an Israeli 
Government entity to know what my account was." 
But DC/NE said that he did not know that using the 
"cut-out" created an opportunity for siphoning funds 
to unrelated projects.37 
The February Shipment 
In the delivery schedule agreed upon in the London 
meeting, North noted, "10 days from money - move 
TOWs." The same schedule indicated that a deposit 
of $10 million would occur on January 29.38 The 
deposit was not made, and on January 31, DC/NE 
and Secord met with North to develop another sched-
ule based on an anticipated bank transfer to the CIA 
account on February 4.38 However, on that day, 
North jotted in his notes, "Gorba going to bank to 
make transaction tomorrow," indicating another delay 
in the transaction.4? 
On February 10, $1,850,000 was wire-transferred to 
the CIA Swiss account from the Enterprise's Credit 
Suisse account, Lake Resources. The following day, 
another $1,850,000 was wire-transferred to the CIA 
account "by the order of one of our clients" without 
further explanation or identification. CIA headquar-
ters then arranged through the Treasury Department 
to pay $3,700,000 to DOD for 1,000 TOW missiles.'" 
On February 13, North sent a PROF note advising 
Poindexter of the transfer of 1,000 TOWs to Kelly 
Air Force Base. He also discussed the final arrange-
ments for delivering arms in exchange for American 
hostages, who were expected to be released on Febru-
ary 23: 
Operation RESCUE is now under way. 1000 
items are currently enroute from Anniston Ala-
bama. Copp is enroute to Ben Gurion Apt [air-
port] to conduct final briefing for his flight crews 
who arrived today and commenced fam flights 
on the two Israelis 707s. All 1000 items will lift 
off from Kelly AFB at 1400 on Saturday. 500 
will be delivered to Bandar Abbas to arrive at 
dawn on Monday. The meeting we had wanted 
to pass the second set of intel has now been 
slipped to Weds by Gorba. ** Second 500 will go 
to Bandar Abbas on Friday vice Thurs. ** If all 
goes according to plan, [the Southern Lebanon 
Army] will release 25 Hizballah shortly after ** 
hopefully on Friday. This will keep our schedule 
for releasing the Americans on for Sunday, Feb. 
23. Something to pray for at church that day.42 
The PROF note reviewed two aspects of the plan: 
first, that there would be a shipment of weapons to 
Iran prior to the release of any hostages; and second,

Chapter 12 
that part of the plan included the release of 25 Hizbal-
lah prisoners held by the Southern Lebanon Army. 
Possession of the 1,000 TOWs was transferred from 
DOD to CIA once DOD received notice that CIA 
had the money to cover the cost of the TOWs. 
Thereafter, on February 15 and 16, separate flights of 
Southern Air Transport aircraft departed Kelly Air 
Force Base, each carrying 500 TOWs to Tel Aviv. 
Upon arriving in Israel, the cargo was unloaded from 
the planes and stored by Israeli military officials for 
transshipping to Iran. On February 17, the first Israeli 
charter plane delivered 500 TOWs to Bandar Abbas. 
Before departing Iran, the aircraft was loaded with 17 
I-HAWK missiles which had been rejected by Iranian 
Defense officials following the November 1985 ship-
ment. The Israeli aircraft returned on the next day to 
Tel Aviv.4 3 
That day, Secord transmitted a KL-43 message to 
North describing the delivery and noting a recent 
conversation with Ghorbanifar. North quickly pre-
pared a memorandum for Poindexter: 
MEMORANDUM FOR JOHN M. POIN-
DEXTER 
FROM: OLIVER L. NORTH 
SUBJECT: Operation Recovery 
The following is text of encrypted message from 
Copp at 0830 this morning: 
Aircraft returned safely to Ben Gurion this morn-
ing at 0730 EST. Seventeen missiles aboard. 
Gorba called one hour ago. [The Second Iranian 
Official] will head Iranian side of meeting in Ger-
many along with five others. Iranians will pro-
vide all names after we give names and titles to 
them through Gorba. . . Iranians have asked for 
second delivery of 500 TOWs on Friday a.m. 
They say they will release all hostages, if repeat, 
if intelligence is good. They say we will get 
hostages Friday or Saturday. They envision a 
future meeting in Iran with us to consider next 
steps while we are delivering balance of TOWs 
(3,000). Gorba repeatedly stressed need for good 
current intelligence. . . .They want focus on cur-
rent fighting. We have already rejected embassy 
as meeting site. . . . 
. . . Based on the above, the CIA (Clarridge) has 
been asked to produce documents identifying 
Adams as DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] to 
avoid having Copp use his own passport. To 
date, CIA has refused to provide him with any 
alias documentation. Albert Hakim is VP of one 
of the European companies set up to handle aid 
to resistance movements. He is fluent in farsi and 
218 
would need one time alias documentation as a 
DIA official. 
It is recognized that there is a significant problem 
with the intelligence issue in general. However, 
we appear to be much closer to a solution than 
earlier believed. [The Second Iranian Official's] 
attendance at the Frankfurt meeting tends to sup-
port our hope that this whole endeavor can suc-
ceed this week, if we appear to be forthcoming. 
RECOMMENDATION 
That you urge Director Casey to provide [intelli-
gence] on Thursday in Frankfurt.44 
Based on his meetings with Ghorbanifar, DC/NE 
understood that upon the delivery of 1,000 TOWs to 
Iran, all American hostages would be released. Ses-
sions with Iranian delegates would follow, and these 
could lead to a strategic U.S.-Iran meeting in a neu-
tral location. After the strategic meeting, the remain-
ing 3,000 TOWs would be delivered.45 All of these 
arrangements had been made using Ghorbanifar as the 
interlocutor. Despite having shipped 18 HAWK mis-
siles and 1,004 TOWs, North and Secord had yet to 
meet an Iranian official. Rather, they had relied solely 
on Ghorbanifar to present the Iranian demands and to 
convey the U.S. response. The American understand-
ing?that delivery of 1,000 TOWs would cause the 
release of all the hostages?was contrary to the 
advice of the CIA professionals. As Clair George 
later told these Committees: "Under no conditions 
would the Government of Iran ever allow all the 
hostages to be released . . . because the only leverage 
that those who held the hostages have is the hostages, 
so why would they give them up.?4 6 
The First Frankfurt Meeting 
On February 19, 1986, the U.S. delegation arrived 
in Frankfurt, West Germany, for what was to be its 
first opportunity to meet with a representative of the 
Iranian Government. When the Second Iranian Offi-
cial failed to appear, Ghorbanifar began to offer ex-
cuses for his absence. Nevertheless, North decided to 
return to the United States until the Second Iranian 
Official arrived in Frankfurt.47 
Albert Hakim, Secord's associate, had joined the 
U.S. delegation from Geneva. Earlier in February, 
Secord had told Hakim that his translating skills 
would be required at a meeting with Ghorbanifar and 
an Iranian Government official. Hakim said that 
Ghorbanifar, when he learned of Hakim's participa-
tion, objected violently and branded Hakim "an 
enemy of the State.? Hakim said he eventually joined 
the meeting in disguise and under the name "Ibrahim 
Ibrahim" without Ghorbanifar knowing his true iden-
tity.4 8

Chapter 12 
On the return trip to the United States from the 
aborted Frankfurt meeting, North announced that 
Hakim would be the translator because he distrusted 
Ghorbanifar. When DC/NE objected to the use of so 
many "outsiders" for a covert activity, North pro-
fessed his trust in both Secord and Hakim and attested 
to their expertise. DC/NE later ordered a name trace 
on Hakim, which revealed allegations of illegal for-
eign sales of U.S. equipment.4 9 
The Meeting With An Iranian Official 
On February 25, the Second Iranian Official arrived 
in Frankfurt at the Airport Sheraton Hotel and the 
U.S. delegation promptly returned for the meeting. 
The first session with him "was a disaster."5? Hakim 
said the discussion began to deteriorate when Ghor-
banifar misled both the Iranian and the Americans in 
his translation of conversation. After several minutes 
of discussion, Hakim knew that the two sides were on 
"different frequencies," with little hope of successful-
ly communicating. Ghorbanifar tried to placate both 
sides, even though their objectives were entirely dif-
ferent.51 
DC/NE similarly noticed the different expectations 
each side had brought to the meeting. While the 
Second Iranian Official pressed for the purchase of a 
specific missile, North argued for an arrangement to 
gain the release of hostages: 
[T]he Iranian said . . .`Mr. Ghorbanifar has told 
me that you promised to deliver a lot of Phoenix 
missiles.' The Phoenix is an air-to-air missile. I 
had never heard that before, that Phoenix missiles 
had ever been raised. Colonel North said that he 
had never heard anything about Phoenix mis-
siles.? 2 
The delegations met again the following day in the 
Second Iranian Official's hotel suite at the Sheraton. 
The Iranian continued to argue for the purchase of 
Phoenix missiles, advising the Americans that if Phoe-
nix missiles were made available, "then we will start 
on the hostages . . . you might not get them all 
immediately, but we will at least start on it." The 
parties eventually agreed that the delivery of 1,000 
TOWs would be immediately followed by the release 
of "a couple of hostages." The remaining hostages 
would be released after a meeting among high-level 
officials at Kish Island off the coast of Iran. When the 
hostage "problem" was resolved, the United States 
would deliver the remaining 3,000 TOWs.53 
Following the Frankfurt meeting, the Second Irani-
an Official asked Hakim to advise the President of the 
United States that "money was no problem" if certain 
weapons would be sold through him to Iran. Hakim 
attributed this bribe offer to the Iranian's ignorance 
that the accepted custom of "baksheesh," or kick-
backs, in Iran did not apply in the United States. 
Hakim said that he and Secord found the offer of 
"baksheesh" to President Reagan to be quite amusing, 
but Hakim could not recall conveying the message to 
any Government official because Hakim never took 
the offer seriously.54 
With their first meeting with the Second Iranian 
Official behind them, certain members of the NSC 
staff felt they had established formal communications 
with Iran. This line of communication consisted of the 
Second Iranian Official as the representative of Iran's 
government and Ghorbanifar as the intermediary for 
the two governments. Nir remained an active partici-
pant in the first channel proceedings, particularly in 
monitoring Ghorbanifar's activities. 
The Second Installment Of TOWs Is 
Delivered 
On February 27, North and DC/NE met with 
Casey, Poindexter, and George at the Old Executive 
Office Building to report on the meeting with the 
Second Iranian Official. They anticipated the immi-
nent release of as many as two hostages and arrange-
ment for a strategic Iran-U.S. conference. Ghorbani-
far's unreliability, which had been noted by the 
Second Iranian Official as well as the Americans in 
Frankfurt, was discussed. DC/NE noted that Hakim 
telephoned the Iranian following the Frankfurt meet-
ing in an attempt to exclude Ghorbanifar from future 
negotiations.? 5 
DC/NE later complained to George about using 
Secord and Hakim as U.S. negotiators. DC/NE rec-
ommended replacing Hakim as a translator with 
George Cave, a former CIA officer still on contract 
with the Agency and whose knowledge of Iran and 
command of the Farsi language were well-known. In 
a second effort to remove "outsiders" from political 
negotiations, DC/NE urged George to propose that 
Secord be eliminated from any future meetings with 
Iranian officials.5 6 
Also on February 27, Israeli charter aircraft deliv-
ered the second load of 500 TOW missiles from Tel 
Aviv to Bandar Abbas. Again, Secord coordinated 
the flight using a Southern Air Transport crew.57 In 
a KL-43 message, Secord discussed a meeting he at-
tended with Hakim, Ghorbanifar, and the Second Ira-
nian Official after all other Frankfurt participants had 
departed. Secord revealed that, once again, a ship-
ment of weapons would not gain the release of any 
hostages. Instead, a new condition?the meeting at 
Kish Island?would first have to be met: 
Met with Nir and Gorba this a.m. . . . Subse-
quently I met with the [Second Iranian Official] 
for about one hour. . . . the [Second Iranian 
Official] emphasized need for quick meeting at 
Kish and said he would possibly, repeat, possibly 
surprise us by getting some hostages released

tingency plan to accommodate early release (i.e., 
as early as Sunday). So, bottom line is on to Kish 
ASAP to seize the potential opening now cre-
ated. Regards, Richard.58 
North reported on his Frankfurt meeting with the 
Second Iranian Official to McFarlane, who had re-
mained interested in the arms sales initiative following 
his departure from the National Security Council in 
December 1985. McFarlane had agreed earlier to 
meet with Iranian Government officials at a designat-
ed location, possibly Kish Island. First, North as-
sessed the meeting: 
Just returned last night from mtg w/[Second Ira-
nian Official] in Frankfurt. If nothing else the 
meeting serves to emphasize the need for direct 
contact with these people rather than continue 
the process by which we deal through interme-
diaries like Gorbanifahr. . . . 
Throughout the session, Gorbanifahr intentional-
ly distorted much of the translation and had to be 
corrected by our man on occasions so numerous 
that [Second Iranian Official] finally had Albert 
translate both ways. Assessment of mtg & agree-
ment we reached as follows:?[Second Iranian 
Official] has authority to make his own decisions 
on matters of great import.?He does not have to 
check back w/Tehran on decisions take.?The 
govt. of Iran is terrified of a new Soviet threat.?
They are seeking a rapprochment but are tilled 
w/fear & mistrust.?All hostages will be released 
during rpt during the next meeting.?They want 
next mtg urgently and have suggested Qeshm Is. 
off Bandar Abbas.?They are less interested in 
Iran/Iraq war than we originally believed.?
They want technical advice more than arms or 
intelligence.?Tech advice shd be on commercial 
& military maintenance?not mil tactics?They 
committed to end anti-U.S. terrorism.?They 
noted the problems of working thru intermediar-
ies & prefer dir. contact-[the Second Iranian Offi-
cial] noted that this was USG/GOI contact in 
more than 5yrs. Vy important?[the Second Ira-
nian Official] recognizes risks to both sides - 
noted need for secrecy.?[the Second Iranian Of-
ficial] stressed that there were new Soy. moves/ 
threats that we were unaware of. While all of this 
could be so much smoke, I believe that we may 
well be on the verge of a major breakthrough?
not only on the hostages/terrorism but on the 
relationship as a whole. We need only to go to 
this meeting which has no agenda other than to 
listen to each other to release the hostages and 
start the process. Have briefed both JMP and 
Casey?neither very enthusiastic despite [DC/ 
NE] North summary along lines above. Believe 
that you shd be chartered to go early next wk or 
220 
maybe this weekend?but don't know how to 
make this happen. Have not told JMP that this 
note is being sent. Help. Pls call on secure yr 
earliest convenience. Warm, but fatigued regards, 
North.59 
McFarlane replied: 
Roger 011ie. Well done?if the world only knew 
how many times you have kept a semblance of 
integrity and gumption to US policy, they would 
make you Secretary of State. But they can't 
know and would complain if they did?such is 
the state of democracy in the late 20th century. 
But the mission was terribly promising. As you 
know I do not hold Gorbanifar in high regard 
and so am particularly glad to hear of [the 
Second Iranian Official's] apparent author-
ity . .60 
That evening, North sent a message to McFarlane 
detailing his success in winning support for the con-
tinuation of the initiative: 
NOTE FROM: OLIVER NORTH 
Subject: Exchanges 
Since the missive of this morning, met w/Casey, 
JMP, [DC/NE], Clair George and all have now 
agreed to press on. Believe we are indeed headed 
in the right direction. Just finished lengthy ses-
sions w/JMP he indicated that he has passed 
substance to you and has given me dates that you 
are not avail. 
Will endeavor to sched. mtg so that these do not 
conflict but noted to JMP that it was their call as 
to date of mtg. Just rec'd msg fm Secord via 
secure device we are using. [Second Iranian Offi-
cial] has again reaffirmed that once we have set a 
date we shall have a very pleasant surprise. Dick 
[Secord] & I believe that they may be preparing 
to release one of the hostages early. Dick also 
indicated that yr counterpart at the mtg wd be 
Rafsanfani. Nice crowd you run with! God will-
ing Shultz will buy onto this tomorrow when 
JMP brief him. With the grace of the good Lord 
and a little more hard work we will very soon 
have five AMCITS [American Citizens] home 
and be on our way to a much more positive 
relationship than one which barters TOWs for 
lives. 
I value our friendship and confidence very highly 
and did not mean to infer that you had revealed 
these exchanges. By asking that you not indicate 
some to JMP I was only informing that I had not 
told him anything of it so as not to compromise 
myself at a point in time when he needs to be 
absolutely certain that this can work. He is, as

only you can know, under tremendous pressure 
on this matter and very concerned that it go 
according to plan. My part in this was easy com-
pared to his. I only had to deal with our enemies. 
He has to deal with the cabinet. Many thanks for 
yr trust. Warm regards, North." 
McFarlane's reply records his impressions of the 
Cabinet level response to the initiative: 
No sweat GI. I just sent a separate note about 
not sharing with John because I had forgotten to 
put it in the other note. And I fully understand 
the narrow path he is trying to walk between 
those who want to go balls out for the wrong 
reasons (Regan) and those who don't want to do 
it at all (GPS and Cap). So play it any way you 
must. . . .62 
As these messages make plain, within one month of 
the Finding's approval, the assumption behind that 
document had been discarded. The memorandum to 
the President accompanying the Finding had stated 
that the initiative was to terminate if the United States 
delivered 500 TOWs and no hostages were released. 
Yet, North and his colleagues continued to develop 
contact with the Iranian and hoped to meet on Kish 
Island while Americans were still held hostage. 
In February, it was apparent that the hostage prob-
lem would not be resolved quickly. In mid-February, 
the United States had shipped 500 TOWs to Iran. The 
Second Iranian Official, however, did not attend the 
first scheduled meeting. Several days later, when he 
did meet with the Americans, he promised to release 
hostages only after a meeting among high-level offi-
cials at some unspecified time in the future. On that 
promise alone, the United States immediately sent an 
additional 500 TOWs to Iran. 
The American participants could attribute the fail-
ure to obtain the release of any hostages after the 
November 1985 HAWK transaction to the Iranians' 
apparent anger over the outdated missiles they re-
ceived. No similar justification could explain the lack 
of action by the Iranians after they received 1,000 
TOWs. The Americans kept their part of the bargain 
and shipped the weapons; the Iranians broke their 
promise and delivered no hostages. Instead, the 
United States received only another promise, not of 
hostages, but of another meeting. 
The Diversion Continues 
The sale of the 1,000 TOWs was successful in one 
respect. The "attractive incentive" that North had 
seen in the arms sales materialized?profits to be used 
for the Contras. 
The February TOW shipment had generated a $10 
million payment to Secord. After Secord paid $3.7 
million to the CIA's Swiss account, North discussed 
the use of residuals with Secord: "I described for 
General Secord the purposes to which I thought that 
money ought to be applied . . . . There were points in 
time when we discussed these activities. I had to tell 
him what the government was going to charge for 
various commodities, but ultimately the decision (pric-
ing) was his."63 North said that the purpose of the 
residuals was "to sustain the Iranian operation, to 
support the Nicaraguan resistance, to continue other 
activities which the Israelis very clearly wanted, and 
so did we, and to pay for a replacement for the 
original Israeli TOWs shipped in 1985."64 The Janu-
ary 17 Finding, however, made no mention of support 
to the Contras or of other intelligence activities as 
goals of the covert action. 
North said that residuals intended for the Contras 
were a small segment of a larger, comprehensive 
covert activity support plan. The decision on how to 
apply the residuals was stated by North: ". . . residu-
als from those transactions would be applied to sup-
port the Nicaraguan Resistance with the authority 
that I got from my superiors, Admiral Poindexter, 
with the concurrence of William J. Casey and, I 
thought at the time, the President of the United 
States."" Those superiors, according to North, also 
approved the use of Iranian arms sales proceeds to 
compensate Secord: 
The arrangement that I made with General 
Secord starting in 1984 recognized that those 
who were supporting our effort were certainly 
deserving of just and fair and reasonable compen-
sation . . . . It was clearly indicated [by] Mr. 
McFarlane and Admiral Poindexter and in fact 
almost drawn up by Director Casey, how these 
would be outside the U.S. Government, and that 
I told them right from the very beginning that 
those things that he (Secord) did deserved fair 
and just compensation.66 
Poindexter recalled no such authorization. Al-
though he felt that Secord was deserving of "reasona-
ble compensation," Poindexter testified that the sub-
ject "never came up." Poindexter was unaware of any 
particular profits Secord and others realized from the 
arms sales.67 
North left further definition of "fair and just com-
pensation" up to Secord. He claimed that he did not 
review the records of the Enterprise, rarely knew 
how much money had actually been transferred for 
the Contras, and never knew how much of the profits 
had gone to Secord and Hakim." Secord and Poin-
dexter also testified that they were unaware of 
Hakim's method of controlling the accounts." 
The Initiative Continues 
Even though the sale of 1,000 TOWs had not pro-
duced a single hostage, the initiative went forward. 
But Nir became concerned that he would be excluded

from further meetings and that Israeli interests would 
be ignored. Within days after the meeting with the 
Second Iranian Official in Frankfurt, Israeli Prime 
Minister Peres wrote to President Reagan summariz-
ing the results of the Frankfurt meeting and discussing 
the next steps.7? 
The February decision to supply U.S. intelligence 
information to the Iranian delegation concerned CIA 
officials. The NSC staff forwarded to the CIA the 
Iranians' request for a map depicting Iraqi battle posi-
tions at its border with Iran. When CIA Deputy Di-
rector John McMahon learned of this request, he 
cabled Casey who was traveling overseas: 
1. A new dimension has been added to this pro-
gram as a result of meeting held in London be-
tween North and Ghorbanifar. We have been 
asked to provide a map depicting the order of 
battle on the Iran/Iraq border showing units. 
Troops, tanks, and what have you. . . 
3. Everyone here at Headquarters advises against 
this operation not only because we feel the prin-
cipal involved is a liar and has a record of deceit, 
but, secondly, we would be aiding and abetting 
the wrong people. I met with Poindexter this 
afternoon to appeal his direction that we provide 
this intelligence, pointing out not only the fragili-
ty in the ability of the principal to deliver, but 
also the fact that we were tilting in a direction 
which could cause the Iranians to have a success-
ful offense against the Iraqis with cataclysmic 
results. I noted that providing defensive missiles 
was one thing but when we provide intelligence 
in the order of battle, we are giving the Iranians 
the wherewithal for offensive action. 
4. Poindexter did not dispute our rationale or our 
analysis, but insisted that it was an opportunity 
that should be explored. He felt that by doing it 
in steps the most we could lose if it did not reach 
fulfillment would be 1,000 TOWs and a map of 
order of battle which is perishable anyway. 
6. I have read the signed Finding dated 17 Janu-
ary 1986 which gives us the authority to do what 
the NSC is now asking. Hence, in spite of our 
counsel to the contrary, we are proceeding to 
follow out orders as so authorized in the find-
ing.71 
Casey did not order McMahon to do otherwise. 
Once again, concerns voiced by career officials at the 
CIA were brushed aside and the intelligence was pro-
vided. 
As the Americans prepared for the trip to Kish 
Island, North received discouraging signals from Iran 
222 
through Secord and Hakim. The Iranians were stall-
ing on the meeting while pushing again for the pur-
chase of Phoenix missiles. North's notebook on March 
2 reflected, "Meeting w/Secord & Albert [Hakim]. 
Albert talked to [the Second Iranian Official] . . . 
situation is not right for meeting in Kish . . . [the 
Second Iranian Official] wants Phoenix [missiles]." 
North's response was, once again, to direct Nir to 
contact Ghorbanifar and urge him to "pull out all 
stops." 7 2 
By early March, career officials at the CIA were 
pressing their doubts that Ghorbanifar and his princi-
pals could deliver on their promises to free the hos-
tages. Iran had not demonstrated any ability to gain 
release of hostages since early September 1985, nearly 
six months earlier. On March 7, DC/NE expressed 
his doubts in a memorandum to his supervisor, the 
Chief of the Near East Division in the Operation 
Directorate: 
Ghorbanifar insisted on another meeting after 
which the Keesh Island matter will be set. North 
is prepared to stonewall in Paris. There will be 
no more "slices of salami" handed out. However, 
our other friend, NEER [sic], will also be 
present. We sense strongly . . . that he is unilat-
erally providing additional arms as an incentive 
to the Keesh Island. I have briefed Ed Juch-
niewicz on the above. I tried to get into McMa-
hon, but he did not have time. I will be back 
Saturday PM and will give you a ring. What we 
may be facing is evidence that [the Second Iranian 
Official] does not have the authority in Tehran to 
make it work.73 [Emphasis added.] 
Cave Joins the Team 
By March 5, the CIA prevailed in its bid to have 
intelligence professional George Cave replace Hakim 
as the interpreter. At CIA Headquarters that day, 
Cave was briefed by DC/NE, George, and Allen. 
DC/NE asked Cave if he would travel to Tehran to 
translate during a meeting with the Iranian Speaker of 
Parliament, Rafsanjani. Cave had prior experience 
with Ghorbanifar and had been involved in the 1984 
decision to issue a worldwide "burn notice" on him. 
Cave was appalled that a sensitive operation would 
depend so heavily on a man with a long record of 
self-serving lies and distortions. Cave was equally 
concerned that the Israelis had such a prominent role 
in the affair, because Israeli and American goals in the 
region were not always compatible.74 
Nevertheless, Cave agreed to participate. He con-
sidered the initiative to be a high-risk operation and 
strongly recommended against the CIA involving 
"serving officers" in the operation. Cave noted that, 
as an annuitant, he avoided jeopardizing his career 
should the operation fail. Cave quickly replaced DC/ 
NE as the CIA's operational "point man," reporting

Chapter 12 
on his activities to DC/NE and "in many cases direct-
ly to Director Casey."75 
North, DC/NE, and Cave flew to Paris on March 
7 to meet with Ghorbanifar and Nir. Ghorbanifar told 
the Americans that the Second Iranian Official's inter-
nal political position had not been improved by the 
Frankfurt meeting. Upon examining their military 
stockpiles, Iranian military representatives felt that 
they needed no additional TOWs; instead, they 
wanted the Americans to sell them 240 types of spare 
parts to repair the HAWK missiles in Iran's stocks. 
Nir encouraged the U.S. delegation to pursue this 
avenue, contending that such a sale would result in 
the release of all American hostages.76 Before con-
cluding the Paris meeting, Ghorbanifar told the 
Americans that the Kish Island site was unacceptable 
to the Iranians, who would agree only to meet in 
Tehran.77 The altered meeting site created further 
delays. 
North's notes of the Paris meeting reflect fear that 
his channel to Iran might be seriously flawed. He 
commented that all prior effort focused on the pur-
chase of arms rather than political change and that 
"we cannot verify that there is anyone else in G.O.Ir 
[Iran] aware or even interested in talking to USG."78 
In spite of these concerns, North continued to pursue 
the plan. 
In a report for Casey after the Paris meeting, Cave 
addressed several points raised by Ghorbanifar during 
the meeting. The last paragraph set forth Ghorbani-
far's suggestion to divert profits from the sale of arms 
to Iran to aid the Contras: "He also proposed that we 
use profits from these deals and others to fund [other 
operations]. We could do the same with Nicara-
gua."79 Charles Allen read Cave's memorandum, but 
dismissed the statement as a typically expansive 
remark by Ghorbanifar.8? Yet, this was not the first 
time that Allen had learned that Ghorbanifar was 
attempting to use North's interest in the Contras to 
"sweeten the pot" for the Americans. During a meet-
ing between Allen and Ghorbanifar in January, 1986, 
Ghorbanifar had mentioned the possibility of using 
monies generated from various projects to aid "011ie's 
boys in Central America."81 
New Doubts About Ghorbanifar 
Several PROF notes between North and McFar-
lane indicated North's frustration following his Paris 
meeting with Ghorbanifar: 
Per request from your old friend Gorba, met w/ 
him in Paris on Saturday. He started w/a long 
speech re how we were trying to cut him out. 
How important he is to the process and how he 
cd deliver on the hostages if only we could 
sweeten the pot w/some little tidbits?like some 
arms, etc. After his speech I allowed as how he 
was not getting the message, but that I wd reiter-
ate: 
?The hostages are a serious impediment to seri-
ous govt-to-govt discussions and this must be re-
solved before we can discuss any further transac-
tions.?We remain ready to go to Kish or any-
where else to discuss issues of mutual concern as 
long as the hostages are going to be released 
during or before this meeting. 
In a late-night response, McFarlane offered his 
opinion on continuing with Ghorbanifar: 
Gorba is basically a self-serving mischief maker. 
Of course the trouble is that as far as we know, 
so is the entire lot of those we are dealing with 
. . . . But it is going to take some time to get a 
feel for just who the players are on the contem-
porary scene in Teheran. So the sooner we get 
started the better.83 
North's return PROF reveals that he was not opti-
mistic that the initiative had reached Iranian officials 
who cared about anything other than arms sales and 
personal financial gain: 
In re the Gorba prob: He is aware of the Kish 
mtg and is basically carrying our water on the 
mtg since he is still the only access we have to 
the Iranian political leadership. It wd be useful, I 
believe, for you to talk w/George Cave, the 
Agency's Iran expert. He shares our concern that 
we may be dealing only w/those who have an 
interest in arms sales and their own personal fi-
nancial gain and believes the "Russians are 
coming" approach is about the only way to 
broaden the perspective.84 
The NSC staff had advocated arms sales as a way 
of creating an opening with Iran as well as obtaining 
the release of the hostages. By mid-March, though, 
arms sales by the United States had produced no 
hostages. Further, NSC staff members were not even 
sure they were dealing with anyone who was interest-
ed in a broader initiative. 
Allen had also recommended continuing to work 
with Ghorbanifar on terrorism issues "regardless of 
whether we find his information at this stage credi-
ble."85 Despite this concern, Allen argued that Ghor-
banifar was the only channel available to Iran 86 
Secord commented that a new channel should be 
sought because the Ghorbanifar channel was "obvi-
ously flawed."87 Cave's view of Ghorbanifar re-
mained unchanged: 
The Israelis, particularly Nir, insisted on Ghor-
banifar, for one thing. I was at the other end, 
insisting he couldn't be trusted. There were other 
people that felt you had to keep him in . . . 
because he would blow the whole thing. He was

investing a lot of money in this operation, so that 
he had to be kept in it. I was more concerned 
that, knowing Ghorbanifar, that Ghorbanifar 
worked for Ghorbanifar, period, which is basical-
ly what we found when we got to Tehran.88 
Ghorbanifar realized that the meeting between the 
Americans and the Second Iranian Official had ren-
dered him superfluous. After the Frankfurt meeting in 
late February, Hakim had called the Iranian official to 
recommend that Ghorbanifar be bypassed in further 
negotiations. As a result, at the early March meeting 
in Paris, Ghorbanifar had continually emphasized to 
the Americans that he was essential, a position he 
would continually restate. 
To placate Ghorbanifar, North invited him to 
Washington in late March. In a telephone call several 
days prior to Ghorbanifar's arrival, Nir told Allen of 
Ghorbanifar's concerns and advised that any attempt 
to eliminate Ghorbanifar from the negotiations was 
"unwise . . . because of the hold that [Ghorbanifar] 
has over the [Second Iranian Official]."89 
While Nir was promoting Ghorbanifar to the CIA, 
Nir and North were discussing how to divide up the 
profits from the sale of HAWK spare parts. An entry 
in North's notebooks related a conversation with Nir: 
"price data on 240 . . . timing per acquisition . . . 
need to know residuals on?price per unit ($6068), 
price in Aaron's place, how much is left for use by 
Israelis."90 "Aaron" was the code name for DOD 
official Noel Koch; "Aaron's place" was, presumably, 
the Pentagon. The conversation reflects the Israelis' 
desire to know how much of the residuals would be 
available to finance the Israelis' purchase of the 504 
replacement TOWs.9' 
Ghorbanifar Visits Washington 
On April 2, 1986, Ghorbanifar and an Israeli official 
met in London to discuss financial arrangements for 
shipping the HAWK spare parts.92 Ghorbanifar flew 
to Washington the next day and met with the CIA 
Chief of the Near East Division (C/NE)* Cave, and 
North at a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. They discussed 
the availability of the HAWK spare parts on the list 
that Ghorbanifar had earlier supplied. CIA logistics 
personnel then attempted to locate the items, many of 
which were not in production or not available. 
C/NE remembered Ghorbanifar saying that the Ira-
nians had agreed to release all American hostages as 
soon as the U.S. delegation arrived in Tehran. Based 
on Ghorbanifar's prior performance, the CIA officers 
were skeptical." Two days later, Cave drove Ghor-
banifar to Dulles International Airport outside Wash-
ington. During the drive, Cave reminded Ghorbanifar 
that all hostages had to be released before any of the 
*DC/NE was promoted in May 1986 and thereafter continued to 
participate in only a support role. 
224 
HAWK spare parts would be delivered. Cave said 
that Ghorbanifar "took the statement under advise-
ment."94 
Cave's report after the meeting shows that despite 
his contempt for Ghorbanifar, he hoped that the Ira-
nian might yet deliver: 
we discussed the schedule in some detail. we 
proposed arriving about 7-8 days after the money 
is deposited. this would give us time to have the 
plane load of spares positioned in europe. we 
then haggled for hours about what was included 
and what would be negotiated in tehran. we 
stuck to our position that once the release takes 
place we would order plane to launch and it 
should arrive in bandar abbas with 8 hours. it 
would then turn around and bring in the rest of 
the spares. we are tentavilye [sic] committed to 
deliver the $3,000 volswagons [sic] [3,000 TOWs] 
about 30 days later. gorba pressed for new addi-
tions . . . gorba kept' insisting that we bring 
some of spares with us and we kept insisting that 
we wouldn't although a small sample is an 
option. 
6. possibly the best indication that we might be 
getting somewhere is that towards the end, gorba 
began discussing his cut. goode [North] told him 
that he could add on whatever he thinks right for 
his cut to the final price, he said that he had 
spent 300,000 dollars already to grease the skids 
etc. it would appear that he now feels that the 
deal is entering its final stages. 
8. gorba claims that the iranian side is devot-
ing considerable time to this. the whole thing 
is being masterminded by rafsenjani behind the 
scenes . . .95 
Following the April meeting with Ghorbanifar, 
North and Nir continued to discuss the arms sales and 
the use of the residuals. On April 7, North received 
an update on Nir's most recent contact with the 
Second Iranian Official and Ghorbanifar. Without fur-
ther explanation, North jotted in his notebook on that 
date, "Merchant [Ghorbanifar] needs $1.5M from 
HAWKs." Nir commented that the Second Iranian 
Official did not trust Ghorbanifar and trusted the 
United States even less. Nir was still concerned that 
he might be left out of the negotiations. North noted: 
"Nir very upset that Israel might be 'cut out' of the 
Iran trip . . . very bad blood if cut out . . . If this 
deal falls through Israel will sell HAWK parts to 
finance (illegible)"." Israel remained concerned about 
how the replenishment of the 504 TOWs would be 
financed.

Chapter 12 
Planning The Tehran Mission 
During March and April, U.S. planners considered 
dispatching an advance U.S. party to meet with Irani-
an officials equivalent to NSC staff representatives. 
Specifically, Casey, Poindexter, and others contem-
plated Cave and North traveling with Ghorbanifar to 
Iran in advance of the McFarlane visit. Even before 
the meeting had been moved from Kish Island to 
Tehran, Cave believed that an advance trip was a 
practical step. He pointed out, "With all my Iranian 
experience and my distrust for Ghorbanifar, I thought 
there was an awful lot of personal risk in us going in 
[to Tehran without an advance trip]."97 
Secord later reflected that a trip without advance 
work was a mistake: 
It was strongly recommended by three of us?
Nir, myself, and North?were all recommending 
that a preparatory meeting take place. There was, 
after all, as far as I knew, no agenda agreed to 
for this meeting (McFarlane's), and so it seemed 
to me at least?and I think to the others?to be 
not well organized. In fact, I have been to many, 
many international meetings, and I don't think I 
have ever been to one where there wasn't some 
preparatory work done in advance. However, the 
position was taken that there would be no ad-
vance preparatory meeting, that the terms and 
conditions that had been agreed to in Frankfurt 
were sufficient . . . and that the Iranian side 
would simply have to deal with that, and so there 
was no advance meeting and that was a big mis-
take.9 8 
Poindexter ruled out the possibility of an advance 
trip by North and others, claiming "that was more 
dangerous and that if we had a more senior person 
there with the group that there was less risk to the 
whole group."99 According to North, Poindexter's 
view was echoed by Director Casey, who argued: 
This advance trip is so hidden, we are going to 
use non-U.S. Government assets throughout, Eu-
ropean or Middle Eastern airlines, no U.S. Air 
registration, air flights. You might never be heard 
from again. The Government might disavow the 
whole thing. '?? 
North's Diversion Memorandum 
Around April 4, 1986, North prepared an extensive 
report for Poindexter entitled "Release of American 
Hostages in Beirut."?' In the memorandum, North 
summarized the Iran initiative, beginning with a June 
1985 meeting between certain "private American and 
Israeli citizens." Under the report's subheading, "Cur-
rent Situation," North detailed the agreement reached 
at the most recent meeting between Ghorbanifar and 
U.S. officials: 
Subject to Presidential approval, it was agreed to 
proceed as follows: 
?By Monday, April 7, the Iranian Government 
will transfer $17 million to an Israeli account in 
Switzerland. The Israelis will, in turn, transfer to 
a private U.S. corporation account in Switzerland 
the sum of $15 million. 
?On Tuesday, April 8 (or as soon as the transac-
tions are verified), the private U.S. corporation 
will transfer $3.651 million to a CIA account in 
Swizterland. CIA will then transfer this sum to a 
covert Department of the Army account in the 
U.S. 
?On Wednesday, April 9, the CIA will com-
mence procuring $3.651 million worth of HAWK 
missile parts (240 separate line items) and trans-
ferring these parts to [a CIA storage facility]. 
This process is estimated to take seven working 
days. ? 2 
The "Current Situation" section included a timetable 
that placed McFarlane and his team of negotiators in 
Tehran on April 19 to meet with Rafsanjani. It also 
forecast that all of the American hostages would be 
released sometime following sequential arms deliveries 
to Iran. ? 3 
Under a second subheading, "Discussion," North 
listed nine points to be discussed with the Iranian 
Government through Ghorbanifar. The ninth topic 
follows: 
?The residual funds from this transaction are 
allocated as follows:

Chapter 12 
North transmitted a PROF message on April 7 to 
McFarlane stating that North had prepared the 
memorandum at Poindexter's request for "our boss": 
Met last week w/ Gorba to finalize arrangements 
for a mtg in Iran and release of hostages on or 
about 19 Apr. This was based on word that he 
had to deposit not less than $15M in appropriate 
acct. by close of banking tomorrow . . . Per re-
quest of JMP have prepared a paper for our boss 
which lays out arrangements. Gorba indicated 
that yr counterpart in the T. mtg wd be Rafsan-
jani. If all this comes to pass it shd be one hell of 
a show.10 5 
During her testimony, Fawn Hall, North's secre-
tary, expressed familiarity with the early April memo-
randum. She recalled typing it as North stood behind 
her and dictated.'" She also believed that one of the 
drafts of this memorandum was edited by Poindexter 
and returned to her for typing correction.'" She 
testified that Poindexter never suggested that the 
memorandum was improper in any fashion nor did he 
ever suggest the outlined policy not be pursued.'" 
Further, Hall stated that her understanding of the 
phrase "our boss" in the April 7 PROF referred to 
President Reagan."9 Poindexter testified that he did 
not recall seeing any memorandums discussing the 
diversion of funds to the Contras until the day before 
he resigned in late November 1986.110 
In testifying about the diversion of funds, North 
stated that he believed his superiors had approved all 
his actions during the Iran initiative. He said that he 
may have written as many as five or six memoran-
dums in which he asked for the President's approval 
for the diversion of profits from the sale of weapons 
to Iran. North explained that each of the memoran-
dums was prepared for Presidential approval when a 
proposed sale of weapons to Iran neared its final 
stage. "1 
Even though North said he prepared "diversion" 
memorandums for five or six transactions, there were 
only three successful shipments of arms during the 
initiative: "It is my recollection I sent each one up the 
line, and that on the three where I had approval to 
proceed, I thought that I had received authority from 
the President." North stressed that, unlike other mem-
orandums he had submitted for Presidential approval, 
he never saw a memorandum about diversion reflect-
ing the President's initials in the "Approval" space. 
He denied receiving instructions from Poindexter to 
discontinue the drafting of such memorandums.' 12 
North initially said that he could not recall Poin-
dexter specifically asking him to prepare a "diver-
sion" memorandum for the President's approval."3 
When shown his April 7 PROF message to McFar-
lane, however, North remembered that Poindexter re-
quested drafting of the April memorandum about di-
version. North also said that the words, "our boss," 
226 
used in the PROF message was his phrase for the 
President.' " 
Poindexter's recollection differed sharply. He said 
that North first discussed with him the idea of using 
the proceeds of the arms sales to support the Contras 
in late January or early February 1986. He could not 
remember ever receiving a written memorandum call-
ing for the President's approval and never directed 
North to prepare such a memorandum."5 According 
to Poindexter, he directed North to put nothing in 
writing about the diversion,'" a direction North 
denied receiving.117 Poindexter admitted leading 
North to believe that the President had approved the 
plan, but he denied ever discussing it with the Presi-
dent. 
Poindexter testified that his decision not to tell 
North that he had hidden the diversion from the 
President was risky in light of his "plausible deniabi-
lity" plan. Without Poindexter's knowledge, North 
told both McFarlane and Casey about the diversion. 
North's associate, Robert Earl, also knew. Not know-
ing of Poindexter's supposed plan to give the Presi-
dent "plausible deniability," any of them may have 
spoken to the President about the diverted funding for 
the Contras. "8 
The diversion to the Contras was not the only use 
of funds that North had in mind in April. On April 
15, he received a call from Nir about joint covert 
operations to be conducted by the Americans and the 
Israelis. According to North, the operations?named 
TH-1 and TH-2?were to be financed out of the pro-
ceeds of the arms sales. None of them progressed 
beyond the planning stages, but North was prepared 
to dedicate funds from the Enterprise to those covert 
operations." 9 
Complications 
Around April 22, 1986, CIA officers reviewed in-
formation noting that Ghorbanifar complained bitterly 
of his arrest by Swiss police. Ghorbanifar had alleged-
ly funded a transaction that violated certain U.S. Fed-
eral laws and was coordinated by Cyrus Hashemi, an 
Iranian arms dealer.'" This incident was the first 
these CIA officers knew of a U.S. Customs "sting" 
operation targeting a group of individuals who had 
allegedly attempted to sell U.S. arms to Iran. Allen 
avoided discussing the subject with Ghorbanifar. 
However, Allen believed that the arrest would have 
little effect on the NSC operation: 
This was a separate activity. It was viewed as 
Mr. Ghorbanifar perhaps being involved in an-
other financial deal. It appeared that he had other 
deals under way with a variety of elements. So 
the fact that he might have been involved in 
some form of arms transaction with Cyrus Ha-
shemi certainly was not beyond question and we 
were not surprised.' 2 1

Chapter 12 
Pricing the HAWK Parts 
Near the end of April, the CIA received authority 
from the NSC staff to forward 508 TOWs to Israel to 
replenish stock sent in 1985 to Iran. George Cave 
recalled that CIA costs for procurement, packaging, 
security, and transportation of the missiles, plus simi-
lar expenses for the 240 HAWK spare parts, boosted 
the Defense Department price to $6 million instead of 
the $4 million originally quoted by the CIA logistics 
office. Cave maintained that North was solely respon-
sible for forwarding the DOD cost of the shipment to 
Nir. However, he denied knowing of North's involve-
ment in suggesting a price to be charged Ghorbanifar 
or the Iranian Government. '22 
Cave denied knowing of pricing specifics for the 
240 spare parts until after the Tehran trip, even 
though he routinely reviewed all reports regarding 
the initiative. Beginning in early April, it was report-
ed that the Iranians were supposed to pay nearly five 
times the amount CIA was to receive for the 240 
spare parts. On three separate occasions prior to the 
Tehran trip, reports reviewed by Cave specifically 
indicated that the Government of Iran was to pay 
Ghorbanifar $22,471,000 for "spare parts," for which 
the CIA later received approximately $4,500,000.'23 
Yet Cave claimed that he was unaware that the trans-
action would yield a huge profit for the middlemen?
Ghorbanifar and Secord.'24 
New Demands 
In late April and early May, Allen continued to com-
municate with Ghorbanifar to gauge any changes in 
Iran's position on the long-promised meeting in 
Tehran. Following the February delivery of 1,000 
TOWs, the Second Iranian Official had promised that 
the hostages would be released if the Americans 
agreed to a meeting with top-level Iranian officials. 
By mid-April, the requirement of a sale of HAWK 
spare parts was added. On April 14, Ghorbanifar 
called Allen with new demands. In that conversation, 
Ghorbanifar relayed an Iranian proposal for the se-
quential release of hostages following the arrival of 
the Americans in Tehran and the delivery of the spare 
parts. The Iranians were withdrawing their original 
promise to release the American hostages upon the 
arrival of the American delegation and instead de-
manded additional arms sales. During his conversation 
with Allen, Ghorbanifar recommended that North 
reject the Iranian proposal.125 
The following day, Allen prepared a memorandum 
outlining what he perceived to be obstacles in the 
initiative and his own recommendations. Allen recog-
nized that unless the United States was willing to 
provide additional weapons, it had no alternative but 
to wait, a decision that would lead to "additional 
hostages and threat of exposure." He cautioned, 
"Every day that passes, raises the risk of embarrassing 
disclosures." Allen also suggested "sweetening the 
pot" by an act of U.S. omission, that is, permitting the 
Israelis to become an arms supplier to Iran, a position 
the Israelis were "anxious" to take because "they 
would like to see Iran prevail." 126 Allen recognized 
that without a sweetener, the Iranians had little moti-
vation to fulfill their bargain to release the hostages. 
Poindexter responded sharply to the new Iranian 
proposal, purporting to communicate the President's 
own frustrations with the operation. In a PROF mes-
sage to North written shortly before a meeting in 
Frankfurt among North, Cave, Nir, Ghorbanifar, and 
the Second Iranian Official, Poindexter issued North 
specific instructions: 
You may go ahead and go [to the meeting in 
Frankfurt], but I want several points made clear 
to them. There are not to be any parts delivered 
until all the hostages are free in accordance with 
the plan that you layed (sic) out for me before. 
None of this half shipment before any are re-
leased crap. It is either all or nothing. Also you 
may tell them that the President is getting very 
annoyed at their continual stalling. He will not 
agree to any more changes in the plan. Either 
they agree finally on the arrangements that have 
been discussed or we are going to permanently 
cut off all contact. If they really want to save 
their asses from the Soviets, they should get on 
board. I am beginning to suspect that [the Second 
Iranian Official] doesn't have such authority.'" 
Poindexter later sent a similar note to McFarlane, 
who was still awaiting his trip to Tehran: 
Here is the update we discussed on Saturday. 
[The Second Iranian Official] wants all of the 
parts delivered before the hostages are released. I 
have told 011ie that we can not do that. ? The 
sequence has to be 1) meeting; 2) release of hos-
tages; 3) delivery of HAWK parts. The President 
is getting quite discouraged by this effort. 
This will be our last attempt to make a deal with 
the Iranians. Next step is a Frankfurt meeting 
with Gorba, [The Second Iranian Official], North 
and Cave. Sorry for the uncertainty.128 
McFarlane agreed: "Roger John. Your firmness 
against the recurrent attempts to up the ante is cor-
rect. Wait them out; they will come around. I will be 
flexible."29 
The Israelis also came to believe that the Ghorbani-
far channel might be doomed. Secord conveyed this 
message to North: "I talked to Adam [Nir] this a.m. 
He [is] quite pessimistic re Gorba/[Second Iranian 
Official] cabal. He know[s] time is nearly over."30 
In mid-April, North wrote in his notebooks that he 
had received "1st acknowledgement that Iranians are 
227 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 12 
committed."31 While this encouraged North, it sug-
gested that the American demands would not be met. 
In light of Poindexter's concern that the Second Irani-
an Official might lack sufficient authority, the Ameri-
cans could not be certain that the Iranian delegation 
would be able to secure the release of the hostages. 
Allen's April 15 memorandum noted that one of 
Ghorbanifar's efforts to have the Americans "sweeten 
the pot" for Iran included the sale to Iran of two 
U.S.-made radar systems. Even though the radars 
were a subject of prior negotiations, North had treat-
ed them as separate from the spare parts sale. In a 
PROF note on April 29, North sought Poindexter's 
approval to sell the radars during the upcoming 
Frankfurt meeting. In the process, North pressured 
Poindexter for an immediate decision on this addition-
al concession to the Iranian demands.' 3 2 
On May 2, Nir telephoned Allen to discuss his most 
recent contact with Ghorbanifar. Nir stated that he 
had advised Ghorbanifar of the U.S. desire to proceed 
to Tehran without a preliminary meeting. Nir told 
Allen that in his opinion it was essential for both sides 
to have complete assurance regarding the "terms of 
the arrangements" prior to the primary meeting.133 
With no advance meeting, the Americans would have 
to rely even more heavily upon Ghorbanifar as an 
intermediary. 
In contrast to North, Allen was pessimistic about 
progress made by the Second Iranian Official and 
Ghorbanifar toward the release of American hostages. 
In a formal memorandum to Casey on May 5, Allen 
detailed his interpretation of events in Iran: 
1. [Most recent information] suggests that the 
White House initiative to secure release of Amer-
ican hostages in Lebanon remains dead in the 
water. We surmise . . . that [the Second Iranian 
Official] is unable to provide the assurances and 
to make the arrangements demanded by our side. 
Ghorbanifar has not deposited the funds neces-
sary to move the spare parts. 
2. We believe that the Iranian government has 
not been able to convince the holders of the 
hostages to release them to Iranian custody. This 
belief is fortified by the experience of [another 
government]. Ghorbanifar's failure to deposit the 
necessary funds indicates that he has doubts 
about [the Second Iranian Official's] ability to 
obtain the release of the hostages. Ghorbanifar is 
in a bind and he knows that once he deposits the 
money he cannot get it back. He also is aware 
that we have insisted that the spare parts will [be] 
delivered eight hours after the release of the hos-
tages and only after the release of the 134hos-
tages. 
Allen's memo must have been alarming. He ques-
tioned whether the Iranian Government had the abili-
ty to convince those who held the hostages to release 
228 
them. In doing so, he cited the experience of another 
government. Although it is clear that U.S. officials 
were increasingly concerned with the Iranian govern-
ment's inability to release the hostages, there is no 
indication that this concern was communicated to the 
President. 
The State Department Hears Rumors 
While North and CIA operatives were wrestling 
with details of the meetings and hostage exchange, 
other U.S. Government officials were conferring 
about the broader goals and policy. On February 28, 
Poindexter had briefed Secretary of State George 
Shultz on the hostage situation. Poindexter told 
Shultz that the Iranians "wanted a high-level meeting, 
and if there were a proper high-level meeting discuss-
ing our future relationships, that would be the occa-
sion in which the hostages would be released."35 
Poindexter said that the White House had selected 
Robert McFarlane to conduct the high-level meet-
ing.'" Secretary Shultz responded that although the 
Iranian position "sounds almost too good to be true," 
he would favor the meeting, providing McFarlane 
acted under written instructions. Secretary Shultz was 
subsequently shown such written instructions (or 
"terms of reference"), which he "thought were fine" 
because they mentioned arms sales as only a future 
prospect, in the event of a new relationship between 
the United States and Iran, an "end to the Iran-Iraq 
war and an end to terrorism coming from Iran and so 
on.""37 
Poindexter did not inform Secretary Shultz that the 
agenda for the proposed meeting between McFarlane 
and the Iranians would include current deliveries of 
U.S. arms; and the written instructions reinforced 
Secretary Shultz's view that the meeting would in-
clude no such agenda.'" Poindexter also did not tell 
the Secretary that only one day before their conversa-
tion the United States had completed a shipment of 
1,000 TOWs to Iran. 
By March 11, Poindexter called Secretary Shultz 
and told him that the proposed high-level meeting 
"was off" as was the Iran initiative itself.139 Yet, an 
event in London among a group of international arms 
dealers 2 months later showed that the meeting and 
the initiative were very much "on" and that Poin-
dexter had been less than truthful with the Secretary. 
In early May, Saudi businessman Adnan Kha-
shoggi, Nir and Ghorbanifar met with Tiny Row-
lands, a British entrepreneur, and sought to enlist him 
in a plan to sell arms and other materials to Iran, a 
plan they maintained had been endorsed by the U.S. 
Government. According to Rowlands, Nir described 
a program to transfer large amounts of grain, military 
spare parts, and weapons to Iran. Nir proposed that 
Rowland's company, Lonrho, serve as an umbrella 
for managing future sales to Iran. Khashoggi exhibit-

Chapter 12 
ed receipts of large-scale transfers of cash to Swiss 
banks, indicating that large amounts of money were 
involved in the transaction. Moreover, in attempting 
to recruit Rowlands, Nir and Khashoggi told him that 
not only were a number of businessmen already in-
volved in the deals, but also that the sales "had been 
cleared with the White House" and that Poindexter 
was the "point man." Rowlands learned that "only 
four people in the U.S. Government are knowledgea-
ble about the plan [and that] the State Department 
[had] been cut out.9,140 
Following this meeting, Rowlands reported what 
had transpired to a U.S. Embassy official in London, 
and Ambassador Charles H. Price was promptly in-
formed. The Ambassador reported the incident to 
Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost, and later 
briefed Poindexter by secure phone in Tokyo, where 
Poindexter was attending the economic summit.'" 
Poindexter acknowledged "a shred of truth" in Nir's 
allegation of White House involvement in the plan 
but contended that the involvement was minimal and 
that, in effect, Nir was "up to his own games." Poin-
dexter told Ambassador Price that the U.S. Govern-
ment had become involved the previous year when it 
"caught the Israelis red-handed delivering arms to 
Iran." He maintained that the story Price had heard 
was "all out of perspective" and advised that Row-
lands be told to stay out of the plan. Poindexter 
assured Ambassador Price that he would "put things 
back the way they should be."142 
The same day, Secretary Shultz, who was also at-
tending the economic summit, received a cable from 
Armacost which detailed the Rowlands information. 
Shultz "expressed strong opposition on legal and 
moral grounds, as well as concern for the President" 
and the potential damage to his credibility that would 
result from exposure of the plan.'" 
Upon receiving the cable, Shultz immediately 
sought out Poindexter. Unable to find him, he con-
fronted White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan 
and objected strongly to any such plan going 
toward.'" Regan expressed alarm and promised to 
raise the matter with the President.'" When Secre-
tary Shultz found Poindexter, Poindexter denied any 
U.S. Government involvement in the deal, saying, 
"We are not dealing with these people. This is not 
our deal." Poindexter further said he had informed 
Ambassador Price that there was "only a smidgen of 
truth" in the report he had heard from Tiny Row-
lands.'" Regan later reported to Secretary Shultz 
that the President became upset when learning of the 
matter. As a result, the Secretary concluded that 
whatever transaction had been discussed with Row-
lands, "this is not our deal," meaning that "the repre-
sentations [that] this is something that has been explic-
itly endorsed by the U.S. Government were 
wrong.,,147 
When Poindexter denied to Secretary Shultz that 
the United States was selling arms to Iran, he avoided 
telling the Secretary of State that McFarlane's pro-
posed meeting with "high level" Iranians had been 
rescheduled for Tehran. Neither did he mention that 
plans for the meeting were rather well-advanced, nor 
that it would include a shipment of HAWK spare 
parts.148 
On the same day that Armacost cabled Secretary 
Shultz, Poindexter sent a PROF message to North, 
informing him of Ambassador Price's phone call 
about the Rowland-Nir-Ghorbanifar-Khashoggi meet-
ing. Poindexter blasted Nir, telling North, "We really 
can't trust those SOB's.1,149 
In his reply to Poindexter, North agreed, "We 
cannot trust anyone in this game." North recalled that 
he had briefed Poindexter a year before on efforts to 
get Rowlands involved. At that time, Rowlands had 
reported back to Casey that the entire matter 
"smelled very badly." '5? North then informed Poin-
dexter that the story he had heard from Ambassador 
Price was "the one made up by Nir to cover the 
transaction" and that it had been reported to North a 
few weeks before by Clair George. North concluded, 
as a result of the disclosure by Ambassador Price, that 
the "bottom line" was that "this typifies the need to 
proceed urgently to conclude this phase of the oper-
ation before there are further revelations. We all 
know that this has gone on too long and we do not 
seem to have any means of expediting the process 
short of going to Iran."181 
As these events occurred, North was preparing to 
meet Ghorbanifar in London. On May 5, 1986, the 
day after Poindexter told Secretary Shultz there was 
no truth to the report from the U.S. Embassy in 
London, Poindexter ordered North not to let anyone 
know he was going to London and not to have any 
contact with the U.S. Embassy there.152 In reply to a 
May 17 PROF note from North questioning whether 
Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger and Director 
Casey should be involved in a "quiet meeting" with 
the President and McFarlane before McFarlane's trip 
to Tehran, Poindexter stated that he did not want 
such a meeting.153 By that decision, Poindexter en-
sured that Secretary Shultz would remain in the dark 
about the Tehran mission, and that McFarlane would 
fly to Iran for an expected high-level meeting with 
the Iranians without any consultation with the Secre-
tary of State. 
Another Meeting In London 
On May 6, North, Nir, Cave, and Ghorbanifar met 
at the Churchill Hotel, London. The meeting focused 
on pricing of the spare parts shipment. Cave denied 
discussing the issue, noting that North, Nir, and 
Ghorbanifar were always careful to exclude him from 
such conversations.'" 
In discussing the upcoming meetings in Tehran, 
Ghorbanifar named Iranian Government representa-

tives whom the Second Iranian Official said would 
meet the American delegation: Prime Minister 
Musavi, Speaker Rafsanjani, and President Khameni, 
with a possible visit by the Imam's son, Ahmed 155Kho-
meini. 
Cave had his first telephone conversation with the 
Second Iranian Official while he was in London. He 
described a "major snag" that arose regarding the 
sequence of the spare parts delivery. The Second Ira-
nian Official was allegedly adamant that all the parts 
be delivered simultaneously with the arrival of 
McFarlane in Tehran. The Second Iranian Official 
finally agreed that when the American delegation ar-
rived in Tehran with as many spare parts as the 
aircraft could hold, an Iranian delegation would be 
dispatched to Lebanon to barter for the release of the 
hostages. When the hostages were released, the re-
maining spare parts were to be delivered. An Israeli 
present during the meeting later confirmed this agree-
ment.' 5 6 
Once again, the American position had slipped. 
Poindexter's firm resolve only weeks earlier to refuse 
to deliver any parts until the hostages were released 
had eroded. The Iranians were insisting on complete 
delivery and the American negotiators began to 
157relent. 
North recorded many details of the London negoti-
ation, and his notes reflect the pricing of both the 
spare parts and the radars. The first set of figures 
came from pricing suggestions by Nir, North, and 
Ghorbanifar:

Cave Becomes Concerned About Pricing 
Several days following the London meeting, Cave 
received information that he claimed was the first 
time he had heard of price manipulation by Ghorbani-
far. Cave recalled his shock when he learned of 
Ghorbanifar's exorbitant price. Concerned that such 
pricing could jeopardize the operation, Cave ap-
proached North. Cave said that North expressed 
alarm at the price and may have indicated that he 
would speak to Nir about it.160 
According to Cave, Ghorbanifar's pricing of the 
May shipment was confusing. During the May meet-
ing in London, Ghorbanifar complained about having 
spent $1 million of his own money to support the 
NSC operation. This complaint, coupled with CIA's 
knowledge of Ghorbanifar's legal concerns following 
his arrest and probable loss of funds through the U.S. 
Customs "sting" operation, caused some CIA partici-
pants to conclude that Ghorbanifar was simply trying 
to raise as much money as possible from the transac-
tion.161 C/NE rationalized that the price of the 
radars, an additional $6.2 million, could have account-
ed for the inflated figure. According to their testimo-
ny, neither C/NE, Cave, nor Allen associated the 
inflated price with an effort by North and others to 
obtain profits in support of Contra activities. 
During March and April the intelligence informa-
tion gathered on the initiative was available to a re-
stricted group at the CIA. Cave routinely examined 
the information, which was controlled by National 
Intelligence Officer Charles Allen. Casey, Gates, Clair 
George, C/NE, and the Chief/Iran Branch were 
among others to whom the intelligence reports were 
disseminated.162 At least three reports showed that 
the Iranians were paying an exorbitant price for the 
spare parts. Information showed an attempt by the 
Second Iranian Official and Ghorbanifar to raise $21 
million to purchase the two radars and over $20 mil-
lion for the spare parts. Seven highly placed CIA 
officials thus had access to information that showed a 
huge mark up in the price of the spare parts and radar 
shipments. Yet all of them denied suspecting a diver-
sion of funds until much later.

The Meeting Is Set 
By May 6, North told Poindexter that he had 
achieved what Poindexter demanded?all hostages 
would be released before the parts were delivered. He 
reported this to Poindexter in a hopeful PROF note: 
I believe we have succeeded. Deposit being made 
tomorrow (today is a bank holiday in Switzer-
land). Release of hostages set for 19 May in se-
quence you have specified. Specific date to be 
determined by how quickly we can assemble req-
uisite parts. Thank God?he answers prayers. 
V/R, North.163 
Following the London meeting, North and North's 
deputy, Robert Earl, met with Clair George, C/NE, 
and Cave of the CIA to review the status of the 
initiative. From that meeting, North produced a 
memorandum setting forth the unresolved issues. The 
memo specifically noted that Clair George "wanted 
to ensure that Secretary Weinberger, Casey, and Sec-
retary Shultz would all be briefed on the project."64 
As a first step in moving the HAWK parts, Secord 
was to receive $15 million in Iranian funds. Only then 
would Secord transfer Enterprise funds to the CIA 
and begin acquiring parts. But Ghorbanifar had diffi-
culty in transferring the money. Instead of receiving 
$15 million in deposit, Secord had to settle for $10 
million as the first step. Secord sent a KL-43 message 
to North on May 14: 
1. We have just received 10M in the lake via a 
contorted process but our lawyer says it is good 
and he is now moving it out of the lake to an-
other acct. Still no sign of the remaining 5M but 
I assume it is enroute. 
2. I will advise Adam ASAP. 
On May 12, C/NE had advised the CIA Office of 
Finance that they should expect a deposit of $13 
million to the CIA account in Switzerland. The de-
posit would allow the CIA to purchase the 240 
HAWK spare parts and two radars from DOD.'" 
Two days later, C/NE changed the amount the 
Office of Finance should expect to $10 million. Final-
ly, on May 16, 1986, the CIA Swiss account received 
a deposit of $6.5 million from "Hyde Park 
Square."67 C/NE advised North of the deposit and 
recalled North's comments: "Yes, 6.5. is in and the 
remaining 6.5 is going to come later [for the 
radars]."168 Iranian funds were never sent for the 
radars. Additionally, C/NE was not certain of ar-
rangements to pay for the 508 TOWs and had as-
sumed that the Israeli Government handled that ex-
pense in a separate transaction."9 
The National Security Planning Group 
Meeting 
Also on May 16, Poindexter and North attended a 
National Security Planning Group meeting chaired by 
the President. They discussed solicting financial sup-
port from third countries to support the Nicaraguan 
Resistance. Poindexter recalled that Secretary of State 
Shultz said that Congress would probably not renew 
funding for the Contras as early as Administration 
officials had hoped. To develop "bridge funding" for 
the Contras, Poindexter asked Secretary Shultz to 
prepare a list of countries for the President to consid-
er for solicitation.170 
Following the meeting, Poindexter received a 
PROF message from North declaring, "There is now 
$6M available to the resistance forces." 171 This mes-
sage was sent the same day one of the Enterprise's 
Swiss accounts received a deposit toward the pur-
chase of spare parts. Poindexter testified that he un-
derstood the $6 million had come from the diver-
sion;172 however, the National Security Adviser 
claimed he did not tell the President of the sudden 
availability of "bridge funds." Generally, according to 
Poindexter, when opportunities arose for him to dis-
cuss the diversion with President Reagan, he avoided 
doing so in order to permit the President to be able to 
deny knowledge of the issue. Poindexter claimed that 
he never volunteered to the President that diverted 
funds were available to "bridge" the Contra financial 
requirements.173 
Final Planning for Tehran 
With the 1-week delay in receiving the deposit 
from Ghorbanifar, participants in the initiative adjust-
ed their schedules. North notified Poindexter on May 
17 of travel plans for the Americans going to Tel 
Aviv and Tehran. Additionally, he requested a mili-
tary aircraft for the trip to Israel and a last-minute 
meeting among McFarlane, the President, Casey, 
Shultz, and Weinberger."4 Poindexter opposed both 
ideas: 
I have problems with this plan. An A/C request 
is too closely linked to what is happening. I don't 
see how we can use a military A/C. Why do you 
have to stay so long in Israel? I had in mind you 
would travel separately, rdvu[rendezvous] in 
Israel at a covert location, and proceed to Iran. I 
don't want a meeting with RR, Shultz, and Wein-
berger.175 
North's reply was a comprehensive schedule of 
events that detailed the American travel itinerary 
with the commercial delivery of military materials for 
Iran. Even though the delegation's flight arrange-
ments were later altered, the military arms were 
shipped as noted below:

cial 707 (#2) to IAF 707 (#B)1" 
The final travel itinerary was eventually outlined 
by North. After Poindexter asked North to consider 
using a CIA proprietary for a segment of the flight to 
Israel, North responded that he would make arrange-
ments that did not include military aircraft. His final 
recommendation included the use of a Democracy, 
Inc. aircraft to fly the delegation to Rhein Main, 
Germany.1" 
On May 22, a Southern Air Transport 707 airplane 
delivered 13 pallets of HAWK missile spare parts to 
Israel. The following day, Southern Air Transport 
flight crews arrived in Israel for the trips to 
Tehran.' 7 8 
On May 24, a second 707 arrived in Israel with 508 
TOW missiles to replace the Israeli arms issued to 
Iran in 1985. After an examination by Israeli Defense 
Force personnel, the weapons were judged to be in 
"poor condition" and were rejected.'" One pallet of 
HAWK parts and the Tehran delegation departed on 
May 25 aboard a disguised Israeli Government air-
craft. Another Israeli plane loaded with the remaining 
12 pallets of HAWK spare parts was ready for imme-
diate departure to Tehran.18? 
U.S. War Readiness Suffers 
The CIA obtained the 13 pallets of HAWK missile 
spare parts using much the same procedures employed 
to obtain the TOWs a few months earlier. Once again, 
the usual method of dealing with CIA requests for 
weapons from DOD was ignored. Bypassing the 
system in February created a large enough pricing 
error to make the diversion of excess profits feasible. 
Bypassing the system in obtaining the HAWK spare 
232 
parts was equally serious, this time affecting U.S. war 
readiness. 
When the Army received from the CIA the list of 
HAWK spare parts the Iranians were demanding, 
Major Simpson began to fill the order. But the Irani-
ans had prepared the list using outdated documents 
and obsolete stock numbers, making it difficult for the 
Army to identify the parts; indeed, HAWK Project 
officials could not identify 11 of the items on the list. 
Out of 148 items, only 99 existed in the Army's 
stocks in sufficient quantities such that the transfer to 
Iran would have no readiness impact.18' In the case 
of 15 items, Army stocks would be completely deplet-
ed if the Army provided all quantities requested. Sup-
plying 11 items would have depleted more than half 
the available stocks.' 8 2 
Simpson was able to adjust the quantities on many 
of the items requested. On April 23, however, he 
instructed his subordinates to ship all of the items on 
the revised list.183 Readiness impact remained critical 
for 10 to 12 of the parts.'" The parts were ordered 
to be shipped even though U.S. HAWK missile bat-
teries would be deficient if they were needed.185 
The availability of one part was particularly acute. 
The Iranians had requested a quantity of one particu-
lar part used in the HAWK radar. If the part fails, the 
system does not work; if there are no replacements, 
the system remains useless.186 The Army had only a 
limited supply of this part. Shipping the parts would 
put the readiness impact in the "high risk" category. 
Simpson protested to his superiors that the Army's 
stock of this part could not be depleted. The CIA 
insisted on delivery, and all of the parts were 
shipped.'" U.S. readiness was thus adversely affect-
ed.188 
Conclusion 
The President's decision to sign the Finding in mid-
January 1986 carried with it a decision not to notify 
Congress of the covert operation. As the participants 
recalled, the scheme contemplated a quick sale of 
weapons and an immediate release of all the hostages. 
Indeed, the memorandum accompanying the Presiden-
tial Finding provided that the initiative would be 
closed down if the hostages were not released after 
the first 1,000 TOWs were sold.'89 
By the end of May, the Americans had seen one 
pledge after another evaporate. When the first sales 
took place in mid-February they were not followed 
by a hostage release. Iran was subsequently rewarded 
with the promise of the sale of HAWK parts, but the 
Americans insisted that all the hostages first had to be 
released. That American demand was abandoned as 
well, however, as the McFarlane delegation prepared 
for their trip to Tehran in an airplane containing a 
quantity of HAWK spare parts.

Chapter 12 
While freedom for American hostages had not ma-
terialized, a funding mechanism to support various 
clandestine programs was flourishing. By the time 
McFarlane and North were preparing for their jour-
ney to Tehran, part of the profits obtained from the 
sale to Iran of both the TOW missiles and the 
HAWK spare parts had been diverted to support the 
Nicaraguan Resistance movement. The remainder of 
the profits were stored in secret Swiss bank accounts 
to support "off-the-shelf" clandestine operations.

told McFarlane in a PROF message that he had turned to 
Hakim after the CIA had refused to provide an interpreter; 
the decision to use Hakim as a translator developed: "Be-
cause CIA would not provide a translator for the sessions, 
we used Albert Hakim, an AMCIT (American Citizen) who 
runs the European operation for our Nicaraguan resistance 
support activity. DC/NE accompanied so that I would

157. The second area in which the United States resolved 
not to give in to additional Iranian demands concerned the 
HAWK radars. The radars were separately offered for sale 
during the negotiations because of a technical quirk involv-
ing the Department of State. The radars, valued at approxi-
mately $6.3 million by DOD, had been purchased by the 
Government of Iran during the Shah's reign. Having been 
undelivered prior to the fall of the Shah, the radars re-
mained in a Pennsylvania warehouse, under State Depart-
ment control, as property to be negotiated between the U.S. 
and Iran. The Iranian Government was unaware that the 
NSC intended to sell Iran radars previously paid for by the 
Shah. Again acting through DOD, the CIA managed to 
obtain permission to purchase the radars without the State 
Department knowing of the true customer's identity. Even 
though an avenue to purchase the radars had been opened, 
the CIA eventually discontinued its efforts when Iranian 
funding failed to materialize. (DC/NE Dep., at 148)

185. In April, the CIA asked the Army for two HAWK 
radars. The Army viewed the request as distinct from the 
request for HAWK spare parts for one major reason: the 
request for the parts came from the White House; the re-
quest for the radars came only from the CIA. As a result, 
the Army handled the request through the usual proce-
dures. 
The results were dramatically different. The Army de-
termined that they had insufficient information to make a 
competent legal review and that, regarding three of the line 
item repair parts requested along with the radars, to supply 
everything requested would entirely deplete available 
stocks. The Army General Counsel was notified, and she 
recommended that the Secretary of the Army decline to 
transfer the items.

188. Administration statements of record do not agree 
with this conclusion regarding the adverse readiness impact 
of the HAWK parts transfer. The Department of Army 
Inspector General's Report, for example, concluded: "The 
sale of HAWK ground support equipment repair parts to 
the CIA did not reduce the readiness of U.S. Army air 
defense forces." [DOA Inspector General Report, 2/5/87, 
at 45.] A careful reading of the Report, however, suggests 
Army investigators may have been unaware of the actual 
status of Army stocks regarding one critical common use 
236 
part used in the HAWK radar. Moreover, while one Army 
official involved in the process testified that there was 
"some discussion" with Army investigators about the readi-
ness impact of the HAWKs, he told the Committees "they 
didn't ask as many detailed or probing questions as we've 
had [during the deposition] today. . . ." [Chapman Dep., 
8/10/87, at 21.] 
When Admiral Crowe learned of the transfers in mid-
1986, he did examine the readiness question, but confined 
his review to the TOWs, not the HAWK repair parts, 
because he "really didn't feel that the HAWK parts were 
going to be that crucial or critical one way or another." 
[Crowe Dep., 6/18/87, at 18.] Upon being apprised of 
HAWK repair part readiness data in his deposition, Crowe 
conceded those data had not been brought to his attention, 
and had they been, it would have been "a rather significant 
finding." [Id., at 38.] General John A. Wickham, Jr., then-
Chief of Staff of the Army, testified that had he known the 
facts as presented to him during his deposition, it would 
have concerned him, adding, "And that is the kind of thing 
that we would have gone to Will Taft about it and said, 
look, we've got a requirement here you've laid on us, but 
now we have some serious implications and we recommend 
strongly against it. [Wickham Dep., 8/14/87, at 46.] 
Finally, Secretary Weinberger testified publicly that 
there was no adverse readiness impact from the arm sales to 
Iran, but his testimony was confined solely to TOWs. When 
first asked about readiness, the Secretary testified: "We had 
a very, very large stocks of those old obsolete TOW mis-
siles . . . so that there would not be any appreciable effect 
on our readiness." [Weinberger Test., Hearings, 100-10, at 
399-400.] Later in his testimony Weinberger referred to the 
TOWs as "obsolete weapons . . . our stocks were perfectly 
sufficient," [Id., at 219], but he never addressed himself to 
the question of readiness vis-a-vis the HAWK repair parts 
transfer.

Chapter 13 
Deadlock in Tehran 
The Presidentially approved McFarlane mission to 
Tehran in the spring of 1986, was intended to crown 
a 9-month effort to free the hostages and establish a 
dialogue with Iran. McFarlane likened the mission to 
Henry Kissinger's historic secret meeting with Pre-
mier Chou En-lai that paved the way to U.S.-China 
reconciliation.' Eight years after an Iranian Prime 
Minister, Mehdi Bazargan, was dismissed for meeting 
with President Carter's National Security Adviser, 
McFarlane was to meet with Speaker Rafsanjani, 
Prime Minister Musavi, and President Khamenei, the 
three most powerful leaders in Iran under Ayatollah 
Khomeini.2 What is more, McFarlane believed that 
the hostages were to be released upon his arrival and 
that the HAWK parts were not to be delivered until 
the hostages were safe. Hopeful of success, North 
arranged logistical support for the return of the hos-
tages and prepared a press kit for the White House.3 
North added his own flourish: He ordered a choco-
late cake from an Israeli baker as a gift for the Irani-
ans.4 
The Iranians had very different ideas?centering on 
arms and Da'wa prisoners. As a result, the Tehran 
mission ended in acrimonious confrontation with the 
hostages still in captivity. 
Preparing for the Mission 
The American delegation consisted of McFarlane, 
North, former CIA official George Cave, then-NSC 
staff member Howard Teicher, Amiram Nir, adviser 
to the Israeli Prime Minister on combatting terrorism, 
and a CIA communicator who was to remain on the 
plane and forward messages via secure means to Poin-
dexter in Washington and Secord in Tel Aviv. 
McFarlane included Nir at the request of the Israelis 
who viewed this as a joint U.S.-Israeli operation. All 
members of the delegation used aliases and Nir passed 
himself off as an American.6 
The delegation took one pallet of HAWK parts 
with them in the aircraft. The remaining 11 pallets of 
parts were left in Israel with Secord, who was poised 
to deliver them upon the release of the hostages.6 
The Tehran trip was both an extraordinarily heroic 
and a very foolish mission for McFarlane and his 
companions. As the immediate predecessor of the Na-
tional Security Adviser, McFarlane knew many of the 
Nation's most sensitive secrets. North was privy to 
some of them as well, as was Teicher. Yet, the plan 
called for them to go to Tehran under false passports 
and pseudonyms without even safe conduct docu-
ments from the Iranian Government. Ghorbanifar and 
the Second Iranian arranged the visit. Ghorbanifar 
was a private citizen and the Second Iranian, was, 
according to Ghorbanifar, the person responsible for 
the kidnapping of CIA agent William Buckley.7 The 
Iranian government had demonstrated during the U.S. 
Embassy seizure that it could not prevent the holding 
of diplomats as hostages by its Revolutionary Guards. 
The State Department was unaware of the mission 
because Poindexter had told Shultz back in March 
that a proposed high-level meeting between McFar-
lane and the Iranians had been cancelled, never in-
forming Shultz that it had been rescheduled.8 Fur-
ther, Poindexter had rejected North's suggestion that 
Shultz, Poindexter, and McFarlane meet before the 
trip.3 And friendly governments with embassies in 
Iran were not alerted. McFarlane and his party were, 
in effect, on their own in Tehran?even subject to 
legitimate arrest for entering under false passports and 
with missile parts. 
Moreover, the plan contemplated that after the hos-
tages were freed, McFarlane and the delegation 
would remain in Tehran until the promised HAWK 
parts were delivered." The former National Security 
Adviser and ranking members of the NSC staff were, 
in effect, to substitute themselves for the hostages. In 
fact, the delegation had cause for concern during the 
negotiations when the Iranians repeatedly delayed re-
fueling the aircraft." The original plan for the mis-
sion entailed less risk. It called for the meeting to be 
on Kish Island within reach of U.S. naval forces." 
Even some of the proponents of the Iran initiative 
thought the mission to Tehran was premature. Secord 
testified that there should have been a preliminary 
meeting between McFarlane and the Iranians to pre-
pare a realistic agenda for Tehran; 13 he believed that 
misunderstandings were creating false expectations on 
both sides. Nir also favored a preliminary meeting." 
Cave believed that he and North should have under-
taken a preliminary mission to Tehran before McFar-
lane went." Poindexter testified that he considered a

Chapter 13 
preliminary mission to be too dangerous and thus 
ruled it out.' 6 
Even the timing of the trip was wrong. As North 
and McFarlane soon discovered, the trip took place 
during a holy period in the Islamic calendar, and 
Muslim officials were not fully available. The Iranian 
officials had to fast throughout the negotiations." 
Arrival in Tehran 
The mission arrived in Tehran on the morning of 
May 25 and the first signs of failure were evident 
almost immediately. McFarlane expected to be greet-
ed at the airport by Speaker Rafsanjani or some other 
high official. The Americans waited more than an 
hour, but no one showed up to greet them." Then, 
only Ghorbanifar and the Second Iranian arrived." 
McFarlane described his reactions in a cable he sent 
soon after arrival: 
It may be best for us to try to picture what it 
would be like if after nuclear attack, a surviving 
tailor became Vice President; a recent grad stu-
dent became Secretary of State; and a bookie 
became the interlocutor for all discourse with 
foreign countries. While the principals are a cut 
above this level of qualification, the incompe-
tence of the Iranian government to do business 
requires a rethinking on our part of why there 
have been so many frustrating failure[s] to deliver 
on their part.2? 
As events proved, however, the Iranians were 
tough, competent negotiators. 
Under the pre-Tehran timetable, no HAWK parts?
including the pallet on the plane?were to be deliv-
ered until the hostages were freed.2' But even before 
the American delegation left the airport, the Iranians 
had removed the pallet.22 The Iranians were never-
theless disappointed, for the Second Iranian had told 
his superiors that at least 50 percent?not merely 1 
out of 12 pallets2 3-of the parts would be delivered. 
The Misunderstanding 
The McFarlane delegation went from the airport to 
the Independence Hotel (the Hilton in pre-Revolution 
days), where the entire top floor was assigned to 
them.24 In 4 days of talks, virtually the only points on 
which the Americans and the Iranians could agree 
were generalities such as the United States' accept-
ance of the Iranian Revolution and Iran's sovereignty, 
and common fear of the Soviet Union, including their 
intervention in Afghanistan. On concrete issues such 
as the hostages and arms sales, the parties were poles 
apart. 
In accordance with his instructions and the agree-
ment that he believed had been made with the Irani-
ans in Frankfurt, McFarlane insisted that the hostages 
be released before the HAWK parts were delivered. 
238 
The Iranians took the opposite position: The HAWK 
parts had to be delivered first and then the release of 
the hostages would be negotiated. The Iranians main-
tained that they had not agreed in Frankfurt to a 
release of the hostages upon the arrival of the McFar-
lane delegation.25 Yet Poindexter had rejected the 
Iranian position before the President authorized the 
mission and had so instructed McFarlane: 
[The Iranian official] wants all the HAWK parts 
delivered before the hostages are released. I have 
told 011ie that we cannot do that. The sequence 
has to be (1) meeting; (2) release of hostages; (3) 
delivery of HAWK parts. The President is get-
ting quite discouraged by this effort. This will be 
our last attempt to make a deal with the Irani-
ans. 2 6 
The Americans made contemporaneous notes and 
reports of the discussions that provide a full account 
of what happened at Tehran. The key points are sum-
marized here. 
Days 1 and 2?Marking Time 
For the first 2 days, May 25 and 26, no high-level 
Iranian official appeared. The Second Iranian and 
other "third and fourth level officials" in the Prime 
Minister's office represented Iran.27 With no Iranian 
decisionmaker present, the discussions consisted 
mainly of exchanges of platitudes, a "diatribe" by the 
Iranians against the Americans for not bringing 
"enough" HAWK parts, and protests by McFarlane 
about the Iranians' failure to produce the hostages." 
Ghorbanifar tried to reassure the U.S. delegation that 
the hostages would be released," but the Americans 
had lost confidence in his promises. McFarlane's 
anger flared. McFarlane regarded the meeting with 
low-level Iranians as a waste of time and a degrading 
breach of protocol. He stated that he had come to 
"meet with Ministers." The Second Iranian promised 
to produce an official at the sub-Minister level but 
McFarlane was still dissatisfied, saying: 
As I am a Minister, I expect to meet with deci-
sion-makers. Otherwise, you can work with my 
staff. 3 
True to his word, McFarlane withdrew from the 
discussion and left the staff to meet with the Iranians, 
including the Prime Minister's designee, a member of 
the Majlis and foreign affairs adviser to Rafsanjani 
(the "Adviser") who arrived at 9:30 p.m. on the 
second day and became the leader of the Iranian 
delegation. Because the Adviser had not attended any 
prior meetings, North reiterated the U.S. position: 
If your government can cause the release of the 
Americans held in Beirut 10 hours after they are 
released, aircraft will arrive with the HAWK

Chapter 13 
missile parts. Within 10 days of deposit [of 
money], two radars will be delivered. After that 
delivery, we would like to have our logistics and 
technical experts sit down with your experts to 
make a good determination of what is needed." 
If the initial discussions hinted at the misunder-
standing about the terms of the meeting, the Second 
Iranian made it unambiguous. He rebuffed North's 
request for a meeting between McFarlane and minis-
ters, saying "We did not agree to such meetings for 
McFarlane."32 He added that McFarlane would meet 
with no higher official than the Adviser; and the 
Adviser stressed to North that the immediate delivery 
of the HAWK parts and other arms was crucial to the 
success of the mission: 
There is a $2.5 billion deal . . . we want TOWs, 
especially with technicians. Easier to operate 
than MILAN. We would appreciate your advice 
on F/14 phoenix and harpoon missiles.33 
He stated that the: 
Iman has said we are ready to establish relations 
with all the world except Israel. But you have to 
remove the obstacles. . . . Speed up what has 
been agreed. . . . A few 747's can carry a lot in 
one day. We would be very pleased to discuss 
our specific needs.34 
From the first discussions with the Iranians in De-
cember, the Americans had described the hostages as 
the "obstacles" to better relations. Now the Iranians 
borrowed the term. In their view, the failure of the 
United States to ship the rest of the HAWK parts and 
to sell more arms were the obstacles both to a mean-
ingful dialogue and to the release of the hostages. The 
different meanings that each side gave to the word 
obstacles symbolized their different objectives; for the 
Iranians it meant arms, for the Americans, the other 
hostages. As the discussions with the Adviser and his 
colleagues ended on the second day, North said he 
would urge McFarlane to meet the Adviser the next 
day.3 5 
North reported to McFarlane that evening. In a 
message sent to Poindexter that night describing the 
day's events, McFarlane, relying on North's assess-
ment, stated that the Adviser was "a considerable cut 
above the Bush Leaguers we had been dealing with." 
He went on to assure Poindexter that: 
. . . with regard to the hostages, we have and 
will continue to make clear that their release is 
the sine qua non to any further steps between us 
and if that has not happened by tomorrow night, 
they are aware that we will leave and that the 
balance of the shipment will not be delivered.36 
The Final Days?McFarlane Remains 
Firm 
For the American delegation and the Iranian repre-
sentatives, May 27 was a long day. The discussions, 
termed "marathon" by Cave, lasted from 10 a.m. until 
2:10 a.m. on May 28. They began with North, Cave, 
and Teicher holding a preliminary meeting with the 
Adviser and the other Iranians. The Adviser deliv-
ered bad news about the hostages: 
Our messenger in Beirut is in touch with those 
holding the hostages by special means. They 
made heavy conditions. They asked for Israel to 
withdraw from?the Golan Heights and South 
Lebanon. Lahad must return to East Beirut, the 
prisoners in Kuwait must be freed, and all the 
expeses paid for hostage taking. They do not 
want money from the U.S. Iran must pay this 
money.37 
The Adviser, held out hope, however, particularly 
if the HAWK parts were delivered. He told North 
that the Iranians were negotiating to scale down the 
captors' demands. However, "only a portion of the 
240 spare parts had been delivered. The rest should 
come. This is an important misunderstanding."38 
McFarlane then met with the Adviser, one on one, 
for 3 hours. He sent a message to Poindexter immedi-
ately afterward that included the following: 
He [the Adviser] reported that Hizballah had 
made several preconditions to the release: (1) 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan; (2) Israeli 
withdrawal from Southern Lebanon; (3) Lahad 
movement into East Beirut; and (4) someone (un-
defined) to pay the bills the hostages have accu-
mulated. How's that for Chutzpa. . . . He hur-
riedly added [before I unloaded on him] that 
these demands are not acceptable and we are 
negotiating with them and believe that the only 
real problem is when you deliver the items [the 
HAWK parts and the radar] we have requested. 
* * * * * 
I then carefully recounted . . . that he [the Presi-
dent] had only reluctantly agreed to this meeting 
under a very clear and precise understanding of 
the arrangements. I then went over in detail what 
those arrangements were: 1. the U.S. would send 
a high-level delegation to Tehran. They would 
bring with them a portion of the items they had 
requested and paid for (which we had done); 2. 
upon our arrival, they had agreed to secure the 
release of the hostages promptly, upon release of 
the hostages to our custody, we would call for-
ward the balance of items that had been paid for 
239

11 1

Chapter 13 
and those that had not been paid for would be 
dispatched as soon as payment had been received. 
* * * * * 
At this point he became somewhat agitated want-
ing to know just who had agreed to these terms. 
(I fingered Gorba and the Second Iranian). He 
stated that these were not the terms as he under-
stood them. The basic difference was that they 
expected all deliveries to occur before any release 
took place. 
He was obviously concerned over the very real 
possibility that his people (Gorba and the Second 
Iranian) had misled him and asked for a break to 
confer with his colleagues. I agreed noting that I 
had to leave tonight. (Actually I don't have to 
leave tonight but recognizing that we have been 
here for three working days and they have not 
produced I wanted to try to build a little fire 
under them. . . . ) 
I tend to think we should hold firm on our inten-
tion to leave and in fact do so unless we have 
word of release in the next six or seven hours. I 
can imagine circumstances in which if they said 
tonight that they guarantee the release at a pre-
cise hour tomorrow. We would stand by but not 
agree to any change in the terms or call the 
aircraft forward. 
My judgment is that they are in a state of great 
upset, schizophrenic over their wish to get more 
from the deal but sobered to the fact that their 
interlocutors may have misled them. We are stay-
ing entirely at arms length while this plays out. 
We should hear something from them before 
long.3 9 
McFarlane's threat to leave had its intended effect. 
Several hours later, the Adviser reported that the 
Hizballah had dropped all their demands except for 
the release of the Da'wa terrorists held prisoner in 
Kuwait: 
The only remaining problem is Kuwait. We 
agreed to try to get a promise from you that they 
would be released in the future.4? 
The request for U.S. intervention with Kuwait flew 
in the face of U.S. policy. The Da'wa had been con-
victed in Kuwait for a number of terrorist acts, in-
cluding the bombing of the U.S. Embassy. Kuwait 
had stood up to threats of reprisal from Da'was for 
imprisoning the terrorists, and the U.S. had supported 
240 
Kuwait. The United States wanted other countries to 
follow Kuwait's example. American policy was clear: 
Terrorists should be punished?not freed, as the Irani-
ans were now asking. 
Accordingly, McFarlane offered no hope of U.S. 
intervention with Kuwait on behalf of the convicted 
Da'wa prisoners, saying that U.S. policy was to re-
spect the judicial policies of other nations.41 
McFarlane adhered to his instructions. The Adviser 
then tried to cajole McFarlane to send the other 
HAWK parts prior to any hostage release: 
Since the plane is loaded why not let it come. 
You would leave happy. The President would be 
happy. We have no guilt based on our under-
standing of the agreement. We are surprised now 
that it has been changed. Let the agreement be 
carried out. The hostages will be freed very 
quickly. Your President's word will be honored. 
If the plane arrives before tomorrow morning, 
the hostages will be freed by noon. We do not 
wish to see our agreement fail at this final 
stage.4 2 
McFarlane responded, "We delivered hundreds of 
weapons. You can release the hostages, advise us, and 
we will deliver the weapons."43 Given McFarlane's 
firmness, the Adviser suggested another way of break-
ing the impasse: the U.S. and Iranian representatives 
should meet without McFarlane to try to formulate 
an agreement on the hostages and HAWK parts, 
which could be presented to both sides. McFarlane 
consented with the caveat that "staff agreements must 
be approved by our leaders."44 
The NSC staff and the Iranians met for several 
hours until near midnight. The group hammered out a 
proposal that provided that Secord's aircraft with the 
remaining HAWK parts would take off for Tehran 
but turn around in midflight if the hostages were not 
released by morning: 
(1) The United States Government will cause a 
707 aircraft to launch from a neutral site at 0100 
in the morning to arrive in Tehran, Iran at 1000 
on the morning of May 28 the seventh day of 
Khordad. This aircraft will contain the remainder 
of the HAWK missile parts purchased and paid 
for by the Government of Iran, a portion of 
which was delivered on May 24. 
(2) The Iranian Government, having recognized 
the plight of the hostages in the Lebanon, and in 
the spirit of humanitarian assistance, agrees to 
cause the release and safe return of the living 
American hostages and the return of the body of 
the deceased American and that this release will 
be completed not later than 0400 Tehran time. 
(3) It is further agreed by both sides that if by 
0400 Tehran time, the hostages are not safely in

the hands of U.S. authorities the aircraft with the 
HAWK missile parts will be turned around and 
will not land in Iran and the U.S. delegation will 
depart Tehran immediately. If, however, the hos-
tages are released at 0400, as indicated above, the 
U.S. delegation will remain in Tehran until 1200 
Noon on May 28, 1986. 
(4) The Government of the United States com-
mits to deliver to Bandar Abbas, Iran, two phase 
one IHIPIR radar sets, fully compatible with the 
HAWK missile system now in the possession of 
the Iranian government. This delivery to take 
place after the arrival of the hostages in U.S. 
custody and within ten days after the receipt of 
payment through existing financial channels for 
these radar systems. It is further agreed that the 
government of the United States will make every 
effort to locate and identify those items from the 
original list of 240 parts which were not immedi-
ately available, and to provide those available as 
soon as possible after payment is received and the 
hostages are in U.S. custody. 
(5) Both Governments agree to a continuation of 
a political dialogue to be conducted in secrecy 
until such time as both sides agree to make such a 
dialogue public. It is agreed by both sides that 
this dialogue shall include discussions on the 
Soviet threat to Iran, the situation in Afghanistan, 
Nicaragua, and other political topics as many be 
mutually agreed. Both sides agree in advance that 
these discussions will include consideration of 
further defense needs of Iran. 
(6) Both Governments recognize that the lack of 
a clear channel of communications has contribut-
ed to misunderstanding and confusion in the past 
and agree that this problem is best resolved by 
having the United States provide a secure chan-
nel of communications between our two govern-
ments by placing a secure satellite communica-
tions team, and appropriate equipment secretly in 
Tehran. The Government of Iran agrees that the 
U.S. communicators will be accorded normal dip-
lomatic privileges and immunity on an informal 
basis and without attribution.45 
The Adviser pressed North for concessions on the 
Da'wa. North, more flexible than McFarlane, pro-
posed a statement such as: 
The U.S. will make every effort through and 
with international organizations, private individ-
uals, religious organizations and other third par-
ties in a humanitarian effort to achieve the release 
of and just and fair treatment for Shi'ites held in 
confinement as soon as possible.46 
The Iranians had another problem. The Adviser 
said that Iran could not arrange the release of the 
hostages by 4 a.m. He pleaded with McFarlane for 
more time. McFarlane was in no mood to compro-
mise. However, he gave the Adviser until 6:30 a.m. to 
arrange for the release of the hostages. If the Iranians 
did not guarantee their freedom by then, the U.S. 
delegation would leave Tehran.47 
Departure 
Prior to the 6:30 a.m. deadline, the Second Iranian 
returned to the hotel with an eleventh-hour compro-
mise. He offered to release two hostages immediately 
and two more after the HAWK parts were delivered. 
McFarlane refused, strictly observing his instructions 
that all the hostages had to be released before any 
parts could be delivered." 
Eager to keep the Iran initiative alive, North rec-
ommended that McFarlane accept the two-hostage 
compromise. He testified that McFarlane overruled 
him, and that he "saluted smartly and carried it 
out."" McFarlane testified that North was so deter-
mined to accept a compromise that, while McFarlane 
was asleep, North violated McFarlane's orders and 
directed Secord to send the plane from Israel with the 
remaining HAWK parts.5? Upon awakening, McFar-
lane ordered the plane, midway in its voyage, to 
return to Israel.51 North denied this allegation, and 
contended that McFarlane had approved sending the 
plane subject to its recal1.52 Secord testified that it 
was always part of the plan to send the plane." Cave 
testified that he was unaware that the plane had taken 
off.54 In any event, the 6:30 a.m. deadline passed 
without any indication that any hostages had been 
released. 
The Iranians made last-minute efforts to sell the 
compromise and obtain the HAWK parts. At 8 a.m., 
just before the delegation left the hotel, the Adviser 
arrived and repeated the two-hostage proposal. 
McFarlane rejected it out of hand: "You are not 
keeping the agreement. We are leaving."55 
Even at the Tehran airport, the Second Iranian 
tried to persuade McFarlane to change his mind. But 
there was no reprieve. McFarlane had come to 
Tehran with instructions and on the understanding 
that no more HAWK parts would be delivered unless 
all of the hostages were freed. He had expected the 
hostages' release upon his arrival. He had allowed the 
Iranians to temporize for 3 days. He once again re-
jected the last-minute compromise and ordered the 
plane airborne. As McFarlane left, he asked the 
Second Iranian to tell his "superiors that this was the 
fourth time that they had failed to honor an agree-
ment. The lack of trust will endure for a long 
time." 5 6 
The plane left Tehran at 8:55 a.m. and landed in 
Tel Aviv several hours later. During the layover 
there, North consoled McFarlane with the news that 
the efforts with Iran had produced one benefit: some 
of the proceeds of the arms sales were being used for

the Contras.57 McFarlane assumed that Poindexter 
had approved this use of the money,58 and that, be-
cause of the magnitude of the decision, it was not 
something that Poindexter would have undertaken on 
his own authority." McFarlane testified that he, 
therefore, never raised the "diversion" with Poin-
dexter or the President when he reported on the 
trip. 6 0 
Why the Tehran Mission Failed 
The participants had different explanations for why 
the Tehran mission failed. Secord testified that 
McFarlane, who had demonstrated firmness, was re-
sponsible for the failure by insisting on release of all 
the hostages: 
But as far as I know and this will surprise some 
people I guess, but as far as I know, there was no 
Iranian agreement to produce all the hostages at 
the time of the meeting in Tehran . . . I don't 
know how exactly that expectation got into 
McFarlane's head.'" 
Hakim, who had been the interpreter at Frankfurt, 
agreed: 
I cannot recall any time that was spoken that all 
hostages would be released. That must have been 
[a] misconception by someone at sometime some-
where.8 2 
McFarlane testified that he was "surprised" at Se-
cord's statement: "[I]n talking to my own staff at the 
time, Colonel North and others, all of them recon-
firmed, yes, we do expect and have all along the 
complete release of the hostages." 63 And North's 
messages and reports to Poindexter before the Tehran 
mission confirm that the President and Poindexter 
shared that understanding." Indeed, in conveying the 
242 
President's approval for the mission, Poindexter made 
clear to North that he would tolerate no more back-
ing down on the conditions. He wrote North more 
than a month before the trip: 
You may go ahead and go, but I want several 
points made clear to them [the Iranians]. There 
are not to be any parts delivered until all the 
hostages are free in accordance with the plan that 
you layed out for me before. None of this half 
shipment before any are released crap. It is either 
all or nothing. Also you may tell them that the 
President is getting very annoyed at their contin-
ued stalling. 6 5 
North and Cave blamed the misunderstanding, and 
the consequent failure of the mission, on Ghorbanifar. 
North testified that "it turns out that the Iranians did 
not" agree to the release of all the hostages, even 
though Ghorbanifar said they had." In his report on 
the trip, Cave stated that Ghorbanifar was a "dishon-
est interlocutor," who "gave each side a different 
picture of the structure of the deal." But Cave was 
confident that greed would overcome the problems, 
and he favored continuing the initiative: "Since both 
Gorba and the Second Iranian stood to make a lot of 
money out of the deal, they presumably will work 
hard to bring it off."87 
Based on long experience with Iranians, Cave was 
not wholly optimistic. He detected in the Tehran dis-
cussions a new dimension to the problem. He con-
cluded that the Kuwaitis held the key to the impasse, 
and that the American hostages would not be released 
until Kuwait released the Da'wa prisoners." He 
grounded his conclusion on the independence of the 
hostage-holders in Lebanon." Until then, he believed 
that the Hizballah would not release all the hos-
tages.7? The Iran initiative now threatened to move 
from an arms-for-hostage exchange to an arms-and-
prisoners-for-hostages trade.

Chapter 14 
"Taken to the Cleaners": 
The Iran Initiative Continues* 
The United States had taken a firm position in 
Tehran. Although offered two hostages, McFarlane 
had refused to deliver the remaining HAWK parts 
unless all the hostages were released first. But this 
was to be the last show of toughness by the United 
States: just 2 months later, the United States delivered 
the same HAWK parts after obtaining the release of 
only one hostage. 
The Iran initiative continued until public reaction 
following its exposure in November 1986 forced its 
cancellation. Before then, some of the players had 
changed: a new channel to Iran (the "Second Chan-
nen' with a new Iranian emissary was found; Nir 
was cut out of the negotiations; and Secord and 
Hakim took his place. More missiles were sent to 
Iran, where they went to the radical Revolutionary 
Guard. But fundamental problems remained, and the 
Second Channel turned out to represent the same 
Iranian leaders as did the First Channel. In the end, 
the United States secured the release of another hos-
tage but three more were seized, at least one allegedly 
at the instigation of one of the Iranians with whom 
the U.S. negotiators had dealt earlier. Despite this, 
however, the U.S. negotiators agreed not only to se-
quential release of the hostages but also to seeking the 
freedom of the convicted Da'wa terrorists from 
prison in Kuwait. 
The Bartering Continues 
The deadlock in Tehran did not end Manucher Ghor-
banifar's role as an intermediary. A strange interde-
pendence had developed among the parties: Iran still 
wanted the remaining HAWK parts and other high 
technology weapons from the United States; the 
United States wanted the hostages; Israel wanted 
direct or indirect relations with Iran; and Ghorbanifar 
wanted to be paid. 
Ghorbanifar had borrowed $15 million from Saudi 
entrepreneur Adnan Khashoggi to finance the 
HAWK parts shipment and Khashoggi, in turn, had 
borrowed the money from his financiers. But only 
one pallet of HAWK parts had been delivered in 
*"Our guys . . . they got taken to the cleaners." Secretary of 
State, George P. Shultz, testifying at the public hearings, 7/23/87, at 
184. 
Tehran and Iran refused to pay. Ghorbanifar could 
repay his debt to Khashoggi only by inducing the 
United States to ship the rest of the parts. 
Only days after the Tehran mission ended, Ghor-
banifar was on the phone with an Israeli official seek-
ing a meeting. Ghorbanifar blamed the failure of the 
Tehran trip on internal rivalries within the Iranian 
Government and complained about Robert McFar-
lane's refusal to accept the offer to release two hos-
tages for the HAWK parts. The Israeli official restat-
ed the U.S. position: there could be no further discus-
sions unless .all the hostages were released first.2 
Shortly afterward, CIA consultant George Cave 
-was in communication with the Second Iranian, who 
also wanted the remaining HAWK parts delivered. 
The Second Iranian claimed that Iran controlled the 
hostages and that if all the parts were delivered, two 
hostages would be released. When the HAWK radars 
were delivered, the two remaining hostages would be 
freed.3 The parts, however, would have to be deliv-
ered first and the hostages would follow?the mirror 
image of the U.S. position. Cave rejected this proposi-
tion?all the hostages would have to be released 
before any of the parts could be delivered.4 The par-
ties remained far apart. 
Iran Discovers the Overcharge 
By the end of June, Iran had raised another reason for 
refusing to pay Ghorbanifar and release the hostages: 
The Iranians had obtained a "[m]icrofiche of factory 
prices" that "does not compare w/ prices charged."5 
On June 30, Cave spoke by telephone to the 
Second Iranian who complained that the Iranians had 
a microfiche price list showing the true price of the 
HAWK parts and that they had been overcharged by 
600 percent.6 The same day, Ghorbanifar called CIA 
official Charles Allen and told him that while he was 
being blamed for the overcharge, his markup was 
only 41 percent.7 
The sensitivity of the Iranians to overcharging had 
been known to the Americans for some time. In a 
December 4, 1985 PROF note to John Poindexter, 
Oliver North warned that the Iranians were unlikely 
to release the hostages in a "single transaction" be-
cause they had been "'scammed' so many times in the 
245

Chapter 14 
past that the attitude of distrust is very high on their 
part."8 
Trying for an Independence Day 
Present 
Since the Iranians' complaints rested on the micro-
fiche list, Cave asked for proof of the overcharge. In 
the meantime, Ghorbanifar and an Israeli official at-
tempted to keep the initiative alive. The Israeli hoped 
to gain the release of at least one hostage in time for 
the July 4 Independence Day celebration of the 
Statue of Liberty's 100th anniversary.9 Ghorbanifar 
told the Israeli that he could deliver" and, on July 2, 
Amiram Nir, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon 
Peres on combatting terrorism, called North and pre-
dicted the release of an American hostage in time for 
the celebration." North immediately dispatched an 
interagency team to Wiesbaden. But when the release 
did not occur, Poindexter criticized North for falsely 
raising expectations and North, in frustration, let it be 
known to Nir that he would not take any more calls 
from him until further notice.12 
In July, North received a copy of a letter purport-
edly from Ghorbanifar to the Second Iranian." The 
letter, dated July 8, complained that the Iranians had 
missed an opportunity by failing to release a hostage 
in time for the July 4 celebration. Using statistics of 
deaths in America from a variety of causes, the letter 
warned that Americans would lose interest in the 
hostages and, consequently, the Iranians would lose 
their leverage.14 
The letter concluded by proposing two alternative 
arms-for-hostages transactions. As a third option, it 
recommended that if the Iranians were not serious 
about pursuing such transactions with the United 
States, they should terminate the whole matter imme-
diately. In this fashion, it stated, ". . . we can pretend 
nothing happened, as if no camel arrived and no 
camel left.' "15 
On July 26, Ghorbanifar and the Israelis registered 
a success: Reverend Lawrence Jenco was released. 
The Israeli intermediary had forced the issue, telling 
Ghorbanifar after the July 4 disappointment that the 
initiative was over unless a hostage was released. 
Shortly thereafter, Ghorbanifar announced that Jenco 
would be freed." Although welcome, the release of 
Father Jenco generated confusion and concern; it was 
unclear what Ghorbanifar had promised to gain his 
release. 
The next day North and Cave met in Frankfurt 
with Ghorbanifar and an Israeli official to clarify mat-
ters. Ghorbanifar described the arrangements he had 
made with the Iranians to obtain the release of Rev. 
Jenco. These included the sequential release of the 
hostages and the delivery of arms to Iran. Ghorbani-
far also told the group that, on his own accord, he 
had promised the Iranians that if they could prove the 
246 
claim that they had been overcharged by $10 million 
for the HAWK spare parts, the United States would 
make up for it by giving Iran 1,000 free TOWs." 
In a July 29 memorandum to Poindexter, North set 
forth Ghorbanifar's 6-step plan for the sequential re-
lease of the hostages in exchange for the remaining 
HAWK parts, 2 HAWK radars and 1,000 TOWs. 
Step 1: One hostage released and $4M to Ghor-
banifar for items removed from the aircraft in 
Tehran during the May visit (Ghorbanifar re-
ceived the $4M on July 28) 
Step 2: Remainder of 240 parts plus full quota of 
electron tubes (item 24 on Iranian parts list) and 
500 TOWs delivered to Iran. 
Step 3: Second hostage released and Ghorbanifar 
paid for remainder of 240 parts. 
Step 4: 500 TOWs and 1 HIPAR [HAWK] radar 
delivered. 
Step 5: Third hostage released and Ghorbanifar 
paid for one radar. 
Step 6: Meeting in Tehran to discuss future fol-
lowed by release of the last hostage and delivery 
of second HIPAR radar. 
We believe that the mixture of HAWK parts and 
TOWs was designed to satisfy both the military 
and the Revolutionary Guards in Iran." 
The proposed terms left the United States in an 
awkward position. McFarlane had withdrawn his del-
egation from Tehran when the Iranians had failed to 
produce all four remaining hostages in exchange for 
the 12 pallets of HAWK spares sitting on the ground 
in Israel. They had also discussed the HIPAR radars 
in Tehran but they, too, were to be delivered only 
after the radars were paid for and all of the hostages 
were released. 
Poindexter had described the problem to McFar-
lane in a July 26 note: "Gorga (sic) has cooked up a 
story that if Iran would make a humanitarian gesture 
then the United States would deliver the rest of the 
parts. Of course, we have not agreed to any such 
plan."19 Poindexter recognized, however, that the re-
lease of Jenco left the United States with a very real 
dilemma: "[t]he problem is that if the parts aren't 
delivered, Gorba will convince [his Tehran contact] 
that we welched on the deal."2? 
North repeatedly warned that one of the hostages 
might be killed if the HAWK parts were not deliv-
ered. In his July 29 memorandum to Poindexter, 
North predicted that "[it is entirely possible that if 
nothing is received, [the Second Iranian] will be killed 
by his opponents in Tehran, Ghorbanifar will be 
killed by his creditors . . . and one American hostage

Chapter 14 
will probably be killed in order to demonstrate dis-
pleasure."2 1 
North recommended that Poindexter brief the 
President and "obtain his approval for having the 240 
HAWK missile parts shipped from Israel to Iran as 
soon as possible, followed by a meeting with the 
Iranians in Europe."22 Poindexter noted on the 
memorandum: "7/30/86 President approved."23 
The decision in Tehran not to ship the parts unless 
all the hostages were released first had been reversed. 
On August 4, 1986, the HAWK parts were flown into 
Iran. Secord provided the crew and Israel provided 
the airplane.24 
The Da'wa Prisoners 
The Adviser, the member of the Iranian Parliament 
who met with the McFarlane delegation, had told 
McFarlane and North in Tehran that the freeing of 
the Da'wa prisoners in Kuwait was essential to the 
release of all the United States hostages. The demand 
was taken seriously and North closely monitored the 
status of the Da'wa prisoners. North saw signs of 
hope, both that the captors of the Americans would 
relent on this condition and that Kuwait might, on its 
own, release the Da'wa prisoners. 
After the release of Rev. Jenco, North wrote to 
Poindexter that "[a]lthough the Da'wa 17 in Kuwait 
continue to be mentioned as the ultimate demand on 
the part of the hostage-holders, . . . we have not seen 
reference to this issue since our meeting in Tehran."25 
On August 5, North discussed the Da'wa prisoners at 
a meeting of the Operations Sub-Group of the Terror-
ist Incident Working Group. The participants specu-
lated that Kuwait might "releas[e] the Da'wa 17 and 
[about] the conditions that would lead to that action 
(Le., protected borders with Iran)."26 
Crowe Is Apprised 
At a meeting of the Terrorist Incident Working 
Group (TIWG) chaired by North in late June or 
early July, an allusion was made to the Iranian arms 
sales. One of the members of the TIWG was Lt. 
General John Moellering, then-Special Assistant to 
Admiral William J. Crowe, Jr., Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs had not been in-
formed of the sales and Moellering was perplexed by 
the reference to arms sales.27 Later, Assistant Secre-
tary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who had been 
at the TIWG meeting, briefly explained the Iranian 
arms sales to Moellering." 
Moellering relayed what he had learned from Ar-
mitage to Admiral Crowe, a 40-year veteran who 
served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam." 
Crowe, though Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, had not 
been consulted or informed about the decision to ship 
weapons to Iran, or the McFarlane mission to 
Tehran.3? Crowe was "startled" by the "nature of the 
transaction" because it was "contrary to our 
policy."31 
Crowe confronted Defense Secretary Weinberger 
and asked him to explain why the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff had been excluded from the decisionmaking 
process.32 Weinberger offered no defense of the initi-
ative. Instead, he merely told Crowe that the decision 
had been made by the Commander in Chief; that "he 
(the President) can do what he wants to do;"33 and 
that "consultation with others below the Commander 
in Chief level would not have perhaps been very 
fruitful."24 
For the first time, at Crowe's direction, the military 
focused on the effect that the previous sales to Iran 
had had on the strategic balance in the Middle East 
and the defense capability of the United States. Given 
Iran's avowed hostility to the United States, and to 
U.S. allies in the region, such a study by military 
experts should have been completed before any sales 
were authorized. The obsession with secrecy and the 
desire to avoid possible criticism led to the conceal-
ment of the sales not only from Congress but from 
the President's principal military advisers. Only after 
determining how the TOWs were actually being de-
ployed was Crowe able to conclude that the arms 
sales did not significantly affect United States military 
interests.35 
The Vice President Is Briefed 
At North's request, Nir briefed Vice President 
George Bush during his visit to Jerusalem on July 29, 
shortly before the HAWK parts shipment. Craig 
Fuller, the Vice President's Chief of Staff, was 
present and prepared a memorandum of the meeting. 
According to Fuller, Nir "described the details of the 
efforts from last year through the current period to 
gain the release of the United States hostages."36 Nir 
stated that one of the open issues was whether to 
agree to a sequential release of the hostages or to 
remain insistent on the prior release of all before any 
weapons were delivered.37 
Nir described the initiative as "having two layers?
tactical and strategic." The tactical layer was an 
effort "to get the hostages out." The strategic layer 
was designed "to build better contact with Iran and 
to insure we are better prepared when a change (in 
leadership) occurs."38 Nir told the Vice President 
that Iran was using the retention of the hostages as 
leverage: "the reason for the [Iranians] delay [in re-
leasing the hostages] is to squeeze as much as possible 
as long as they have assets."" But the Iranians were, 
Nir stated, arranging to release one hostage with an-
other to follow. In return, the Iranians wanted 
HAWK spare parts and TOWs. 
Nir then framed the issues awaiting decision:

Should we accept sequencing? What are alterna-
tives to sequencing? They fear if they give us all 
hostages they won't get anything from us. If we 
do want to move along these lines we'd have to 
move quickly. It would be a matter still of sever-
al weeks not several days, in part because they 
have to move the hostages every time one is 
released . . . . It is important that we have assets 
there 2 to 3 years out when the change occurs. 
We have no choice other than to proceed.4? 
Nir also told the Vice President that "we are dealing 
with the most radical elements." 
The Vice President did not comment except to 
thank Nir "for having pursued this effort despite 
doubts and reservations throughout the process."4' 
A New Deal in London 
The August 4 delivery of the HAWK parts did not 
satisfy the Iranians. They continued to protest the 
high price of the HAWK parts. Moreover, to gain the 
release of Father Jenco, Ghorbanifar had promised 
the Second Iranian that the United States would pro-
vide 1,000 TOWs in addition to the HAWK parts if a 
hostage was freed. 
Shortly before the HAWK parts were sent to Iran, 
North and Nir discussed the next steps in the initia-
tive. North noted that he would instruct Cave to 
explain to the Second Iranian that some of the terms 
that Ghorbanifar had promised had not been author-
ized by the United States. North planned to ask Cave 
to convey the United States recognition of the Irani-
ans' unhappiness.42 At the same time, Cave was to 
note that, "if there is no payment" to Ghorbanifar, 
the United States would have to stop selling arms 
because "those who loaned the merchant (Ghorbani-
far) the money will make the whole thing public."'" 
To address these unresolved issues, North planned a 
meeting with the Iranians in Europe.44 
On August 8, in what proved to be North's last 
face-to-face meeting with Ghorbanifar, North, Nir, 
and Ghorbanifar met in London. The meeting pro-
duced a plan, which North described in his note-
books: 
Proposed next step: 
1. 40 Tubes [HAWK Radar Parts] 
500 TOWs 
2. [Hostage] 
3. 500+ HP[HAWK Radar] 137 missing items 
4. [Hostage] 
5. Meeting 
6. Remaining for disc: 
?[Hostage] 
?HP 
?[William] Buckley location 
?Pay us $15.5 M 
for 1000 TOWs 
248 
177 missing units 
40 Tubes 
2 HPs45 
Although North apparently agreed to the proposal, 
he told Ghorbanifar that it was subject to approval in 
Washington." The plan incorporated the principle of 
sequential delivery of hostages and arms?a position 
the United States had rejected since November 1985. 
North's notes of the London meeting suggest one 
reason, attributed to the Speaker of the Iranian Parlia-
ment Rafsanjani, for accepting the sequential process: 
"'If all the Americans are released at once, everyone 
knows that a deal was made w/ Iran.' "47 But this 
does not explain why arms deliveries had to intervene 
between each release.48 In fact, North never opposed 
sequential delivery of arms and the release of the 
hostages. He recommended it as early as December 4 
in a PROF note to Poindexter, and he was disappoint-
ed when McFarlane did not accept the two hostage 
deal in Tehran.49 
The Microfiche Arrives 
The dispute about overcharging remained unresolved. 
By August 6, the Israelis had received the microfiche 
list from Iran.5? It consisted of pages showing prices 
as of November 1, 1985, and was authentic.5' The 
Iranians had clear evidence that they had been grossly 
overcharged. But North never considered a refund, 
even though the Enterprise had more than enough 
money to mollify the Iranians. North had no intention 
of eliminating the markup on future shipments. At 
North's instruction, Robert Earl, North's National Se-
curity Council colleague, was calculating prices on 
possible future shipments using a 3.7 multiplier against 
cost. 52 
North's solution to Iran's complaint was to ask the 
CIA to prepare a phony price list to justify the prices 
charged Iran." According to Allen, this effort failed 
because the CIA's Office of Technical Services 
proved incapable of preparing a credible forged list.54 
As a further complicating factor, when the Iranians 
inspected the HAWK parts shipped in August, they 
rejected many of the parts and found the shipment 
incomplete. By August 20, Iran had identified 177 
items that it had originally ordered and had not been 
included in the shipment. Iran had also determined 
that 63 of the items that had been sent were defective 
and asked that they be returned.55 
Ghorbanifar was thus left in difficult straits; pur-
sued on the one hand by his creditors and criticized, 
on the other, by Iran for participating in a scam. 
Ghorbanifar complained hysterically to Allen." Even 
after Iran paid Ghorbanifar $5 million for the HAWK 
parts it received on August 4, Ghorbanifar claimed he 
was still $10 million short of meeting his obligations 
to his creditors. From North's point of view, an alter-

Chapter 14 
native to Ghorbanifar, with all his financial problems, 
was needed. 
The Search for a New Channel 
Ghorbanifar had never been a popular emissary with 
the Americans. McFarlane in December 1985 had, 
according to Secord, found him "one of the most 
despicable characters [he] had ever met . . . . "57 
After the February meeting in Frankfurt, North 
complained that Ghorbanifar had deliberately distort-
ed the translations.58 The CIA's Deputy Chief of the 
Near East Division soon to become Chief of that 
division (C/NE), said that Ghorbanifar had "lied to 
both sides" to get them to the Frankfurt negotia-
tion." When George Cave joined the Iran initiative, 
he was "a little bit horrified" when he was informed 
of Ghorbanifar's involvement.80 
On February 27, North wrote of the need to "get 
Gorba out of the long range picture ASAP."81 By 
the time of the Tehran meeting in May therefore, 
Ghorbanifar was in jeopardy. When the Americans 
attributed the failure of the McFarlane mission to 
Ghorbanifar's misrepresentations to both sides, his re-
placement was certain. 
Shortly after the Tehran breakdown, Poindexter au-
thorized North to seek a new opening to Iran for 
continued negotiations?a "Second Channel." 6 2 
Hakim testified that he believed that the idea for a 
second channel originated with his associate, Richard 
Secord." Hakim took the lead in finding the appro-
priate contacts while keeping North and Secord in-
formed.84 
Hakim thus had the opportunity to promote his 
business interests and to serve both his newly adopted 
country, the United States, and his native country, 
Iran." Hakim estimated the trade market between the 
United States and Iran to be worth $15 billion." He 
hoped that his role in renewing relations between the 
two countries would win him a part of this market. 
Hakim and Secord intended to use part of the surplus 
from the Iranian sales to invest for their own benefit 
in commercial opportunities in Iran." 
Hakim contacted an Iranian expatriate (the "First 
Contact") whom he had employed in the past. At 
least twice in 1983 Hakim had brought the First Con-
tact to the attention of the CIA as a possible source of 
information, but the CIA did not use him." The First 
Contact came to the United States to meet with 
Hakim and Cave, on July 10 and 11. The meetings 
focused on the First Contact's connections in Iran and 
how the trade door to Iran might be opened. He was 
also tested by a private polygraph examiner." 
Hakim and Cave told the First Contact that the 
U.S. Government wanted to resume trade to re-estab-
lish relations with Iran and that they planned to "cap-
italize" on this trade by using their contacts in the 
U.S. Government. Hakim told the First Contact that 
he would pursue the Iranian-American trade market 
no matter what "we" (the United States) finally de-
cided. 7 
The First Contact made it clear that he expected to 
be paid for his work. In Cave's presence, Hakim as-
sured him that "if anything goes through" he would 
realize a "good commission."" The demand for re-
muneration was no surprise to Hakim. Transactions in 
the Middle East frequently call for "baksheesh"?a 
payoff to intermediaries. He had made such payoffs in 
the past.72 Hakim would draw the money for bak-
sheesh from the profits of the arms deals with Iran.'" 
With the promise of a payoff, the First Contact 
turned to a fellow Iranian businessman (the "Second 
Contact") with direct connections to the Iranian Gov-
ernment. How many others helped open the new 
channel is unclear. But, by the time it was in use, 
Hakim had obligated for payoffs an indefinite portion 
of $2 million set aside for such expenses from the Iran 
profits.7 4 
The Second Channel's Debut 
The First and Second Contacts quickly found another 
avenue into Iran. North first got reports that an emis-
sary from the "Second Channel" had been identified 
in late July. By July 31, the emissary's relationship to 
a leading Iranian official had been verified.75 On 
August 19, North learned that the emissary would 
meet with Secord and Hakim in Brussels, Belgium.'" 
The meeting occurred on August 25. Both the First 
and Second Contacts were present. Thereafter, the 
First and Second Contacts ordinarily did not attend 
the meetings between the Americans and the emis-
sary. 
The emissary ("the Relative") was an Iranian, who 
had distinguished himself in the ranks of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Corps in the war with Iraq. 
The Relative impressed Secord. In a message to 
North after the Brussels meeting, Secord described 
the discussions as a "comprehensive tour de force" 
covering matters ranging from Soviet activities to the 
conduct of the Iran-Iraq war. Arms, however, re-
mained the currency for dealing with Iran. The Rela-
tive recited an extensive list of weapons that "[t]hey 
badly need[ed]," including "air defense items, armor 
spares, TOWs, gun barrels, helo spares, and tactical 
intelligence." Secord responded that "all things 
[would be] negotiable if we can clear the hostage 
matter quickly." 7 7 
The Relative knew of the efforts of Ghorbanifar 
and his contacts. He described Ghorbanifar as a 
"crook," but promised not to interfere in that channel. 
He offered to help Ghorbanifar win the release of 
more hostages. Secord reported to North on August 
26, "[m]y judgment is that we have opened up a new 
and probably much better channel into Iran."78

Chapter 14 
Two Trains Running 
Ghorbanifar was not immediately dropped. North and 
the CIA still pressed for the approval of the deal that 
North, Nir, and Cave had negotiated with Ghorbani-
far in London on August 8. On September 2, North 
submitted a memorandum to Poindexter reviewing 
the initiatives under way to free the hostages. Ghor-
banifar, the Relative, and some efforts by another 
country were all mentioned. In his memorandum," 
North summarized the terms proposed at the London 
meeting with Ghorbanifar. 
Deliver 500 TOWs and the 39 electron tubes for 
the HAWK system previously requested. 
[Hostage] released. 
Deliver 500 TOWs and one of the HAWK radars 
previously requested. 
[Hostage] released. 
Meeting in Tehran to discuss broadened relation-
ship, Soviet intelligence, etc. 
Deliver remaining radar and 100 TOWs while we 
are in Tehran. 
[Hostage] released and Buckley's body deliv-
ered.80 
North favored the plan and asserted that others in the 
CIA did also: "[The] CIA concurs that [the Second 
Iranian]-Ghorbanifar connection is the only proven 
means by which we have been able to effect the 
release of any of the hostages."8' 
Having posed the question on sequential release to 
Poindexter, North then worked for a quick response. 
In a PROF note dated September 3, he advised 
McFarlane that "[w]e still have no response fm (sic) 
JMP re proceeding w/ the sequential release proposal 
outlined to you some time back. Have now undertak-
en to have Casey raise same w/ JMP tomorrow at thr 
(sic) weekly meeting. The things one must do to get 
action."82 North's notebooks also show a meeting 
with Poindexter on September 4, in which the entry 
appears: "Go/No Go on sequential deliveries."'" The 
entry mentioned the need to talk to "Joshua," North's 
code name for President Reagan." 
On September 8, North updated his September 2 
memorandum to Poindexter. North noted that enough 
HAWK spare parts had been located to "entice the 
Iranians to proceed with the sequential release pattern 
proposed in the London meetings." According to 
North's notes dated that same day, Cave reported to 
North that the Second Iranian was "rabid" for the 
arrival of additional HAWK parts,85 and Charles 
Allen called North to say that Casey planned to call 
Poindexter and that Deputy CIA Director Robert 
Gates was "supportive."8 6 
250 
At that point, news from Iran caused a change in 
plans and a reevaluation of Ghorbanifar's influence: 
North told Poindexter of a telephone conversation in 
which the Second Iranian told Cave that his "boss" in 
the Iranian Government approved of the planned 
meeting between the Relative and the Americans. 
North added that the Second Iranian's prompt trans-
mission of the Prime Minister's approval was inter-
preted by the CIA as "confirmation that Rafsanjani 
may be moving to take control of the entire process 
of the United States relationship and the hostages."87 
Second Channel Out Front 
On September 9,88 Poindexter met with President 
Reagan. The Second Channel was on the agenda.89 
Another American, Frank Reed, had been kidnapped 
that day, and North worried that the incident might 
scuttle the initiative.90 He expressed concern in his 
notebook that "Paul" would stop everything." 
After Poindexter's meeting with the President, 
North told Allen that Poindexter had given him "new 
guidance" on the hostage issue. North was to contin-
ue working to develop the Second Channel, and 
Ghorbanifar was to be eliminated from all future ship-
ments, "if at all possible."92 In a memorandum to 
Director Casey, which was also sent to Gates, Allen 
observed that, to banish Ghorbanifar, North would 
have to raise "a minimum of $4 Ghorbani-
far was not to be abandoned altogether, however. 
North was instructed that "[i]f there is no other chan-
nel for financing future arms shipments, then Ghoban-
ifar (sic) will be used as a last resort."94 Allen said 
North was "greatly relieved" by the guidance.95 
Poindexter's instructions evidenced a strong commit-
ment to continuing the Iran initiative?even the 
flawed Ghorbanifar could continue as a backup if the 
Second Channel failed. 
Secord/Hakim Ascending 
The opening of the Second Channel reversed roles 
for Secord-Hakim and Israel. The Israelis had devel-
oped the Ghorbanifar channel and they had assured 
the Americans that they knew how to deal with 
Ghorbanifar.96 Even after the United States had 
taken over the initiative in January 1986, Nir had 
taken the risk?considerable for an Israeli?of accom-
panying McFarlane and North to Tehran.97 Secord 
called the initiative a "joint venture" between the 
United States and Israel.98 
Secord and Hakim had had little to do with the 
negotiations with the First Channel. According to 
Secord, his relationship with Ghorbanifar, whom he 
had met in the aftermath of the November 1985 
HAWK fiasco, withered when Secord told him in an 
"acid" conversation in February that Ghorbanifar was 
going to recommend that Ghorbanifar be "terminat-

Chapter 14 
ed." Secord said that Ghorbanifar "took it the wrong 
way."" 
After the February 25 and 26 meetings in Frank-
furt, Secord was reduced to a behind-the-scenes advis-
er and logistician. Hakim's role was even smaller. 
Persona non grata to the Iranians, Hakim had to use a 
pseudonym, Ibrahim Ibrahamian?and wig?to serve 
as an interpreter at the Frankfurt meetings.'" 
All this changed with the opening of the Second 
Channel. Hakim, not the Israelis, developed the 
Second Channel. From August through November, 
Hakim and Secord were at all meetings with the 
Relative. Secord acted as a negotiator for the United 
States, presenting?and sometimes formulating?the 
views of the United States and offering military guid-
ance to the Iranians. On one key occasion, North left 
Hakim, a private citizen, by himself to complete nego-
tiations on behalf of the United States.' ?' 
Nir Suspects 
Initially unaware of the dialogue with the Relative, 
Nir had continued to promote a new meeting between 
the Second Iranian and North. On August 24, he 
called North to urge a meeting as soon as possible."2 
By late August, however, Ghorbanifar had advised 
Nir that the Americans were seeking a new channel 
into Iran and that at least one meeting had already 
occurred between the new contact and the United 
States. Nir decided to come to Washington and press 
the Ghorbanifar channel personally. In a September 3 
PROF note, North wrote to McFarlane that Nir was 
arriving the following week, and "will raise enough 
hell to move it [the Ghorbanifar proposal] if it hasn't 
all fallen apart by then." ? 3 
North prepared "Talking Points" for Poindexter's 
September 10 meeting with Nir. At the meeting, 
among other things, Poindexter told Nir that the 
United States would continue seeking the release of 
the hostages held in Lebanon; that the United States 
developed the Second Channel; that the Second 
Channel was connected with Speaker Rafsanjani; and 
that the President had approved proceeding with a 
meeting with the Rafsanjani representative.'" 
Nir left the United States on September 15. Before 
departing, he met again with Poindexter and 
North."5 North's notes indicate that Nir stated that 
Ghorbanifar was trying to finance a deal large enough 
to entice the Iranians into gaining the release of all 
the hostages simultaneously. Two days after he left, 
Nir reported to North that Ghorbanifar was having 
little luck financing the deal. Appeals to the Second 
Iranian for the release of the hostages were likewise 
unsuccessful.' 06 
On the heels of his first meeting with the Relative, 
Secord learned from the Relative that an independent 
TOW transaction involving Iran might be under way. 
Secord reported this to North on August 27."7 In his 
message, Secord warned North that "our groups (sic) 
credibility with the Iranians is at stake here."'" He 
added that the Relative was worried that this TOW 
transaction would "thwart a new beginning on the 
relationship with USG." ? 9 
Hakim advised Allen that Ghorbanifar and Kha-
shoggi were likely involved in the transaction."? At 
North's request, Allen reported the matter to United 
States Customs.' " Concerns about this independent 
transaction are reflected in North's notebooks as late 
as October 22.112 
In "Great Satan's" Parlor 
North's notes show that, throughout the Nir visit, he 
was preparing for the Relative to visit Washing-
ton." 3 
North complained about the CIA's resistance to 
arranging the visit and urged Poindexter to "call 
Casey and tell him to get on with moving the guy 
[the Relative] in so that we don't embarass (sic) the 
hell out of ourselves w/ Rafsanjani.99114 At another 
point, he complained of yet another delay: 
Why Dick [Secord] can do something in 5 min. 
(sic) that the CIA cannot do in two days is 
beyond me?but he does." 
Secord summarized for North the Relative's proba-
ble agenda in the upcoming meetings. He predicted 
that the Relative and "his group are attaching more 
importance to a long-term relationship than to any 
short-term quick fix, such as a few thousand TOWs." 
But Secord warned that the Relative would "have a 
list of needed items and will no doubt suggest some 
kind of shipment to clear the hostage matter and to 
firmly establish direct USG to GOI transactions and 
to eliminate the Gorbas and [the Second Iranian]." 
Secord also expected that the Relative would ask for 
intelligence information and a means of securely re-
ceiving more intelligence." 6 
To get the relationship off to a good start, there-
fore, Secord said "the CIA must deliver the goods 
[intelligence] and come up with suitcase secure phone 
device." 7 
Secord arranged for the Relative to be flown to 
Washington for a 2-day visit on September 19. The 
first day the Relative met with North, Secord, and 
Cave in North's office in the Old Executive Office 
Building. Hakim attended part of the meeting. On the 
second day, the group met at the headquarters of 
Stanford Technology Trading Group International in 
Vienna, Virginia." 8 
Secord's forecast of the Relative's agenda was cor-
rect. Each side assured the other that its objective 
was a long-term relationship and a common defense 
against Soviet aggression. But arms, hostages, the 
Da'wa?and a new subject, the status of Iraq's Presi-
dent, Saddam Hussein?dominated the discussion. The 
key points of those meetings follow.

Chapter 14 
Arms: The Relative brought an extensive arms 
"wish list." It included previously requested items, 
such as HAWK spare parts and radars, and many 
other items, including offensive weapons, critical to 
their war effort. To operate the equipment, Iran also 
could use "minimum levels of technological assist-
ance" from the United States.119 
North reviewed the list and told the Relative that, 
"in principle, to the extent that the items are available 
either here or elsewhere, there isn't a particular prob-
lem.,,120 North singled out only the request for 
10,000 175 RAP rounds as "not a reasonable request." 
He counseled patience: The President had authorized 
only the shipment of defensive arms, and, even if the 
new weapons were approved, the wait would be long 
since "most of these items would have to come by 
ship . . . . [T]hey are very big and heavy and only a 
few could come by aircraft.'1121 North promised, 
however, that the TOWs and HAWK spares would 
be shipped as soon as the hostage issue was re-
122 
On the cost of weapons, North explained that 
Ghorbanifar had to be charged the market price, not 
cost. He suggested that, once the "obstacles" of the 
hostages were removed, the price to Iran could be 
reduced. In the meantime, North urged that Iran pay 
Ghorbanifar what it owed him to keep him and his 
financiers quiet.123 
Hostages: North pressed for the release of all the 
hostages, not only as a condition of arms sales but as 
the first step toward a normal relationship with Iran. 
According to Secord's notes, North said: 
With respect to the document we prepared in 
Teheran, you will note a considerable emphasis 
on hostages. We consider them to be an obstacle. 
An obstacle to the understanding of the Ameri-
can people. The widespread perception here in 
America is that Iran is basically responsible for 
these hostages. The issue of hostages and terror-
ism must be dealt with since it is a political obsta-
cle. On the other hand, you should realize that 
52,000 people in the United States died last year 
in automobile accidents and 130,000 died from 
lung cancer. Five United States hostages rarely 
make the newspapers or the television, but be-
cause this is a democracy, if the President is 
found to be helping Iran with this obstacle still in 
the way, it would be very difficult to explain to 
our people.124 
North reminded the Relative that the United States 
had to get the hostages "behind us" in order to ship 
weapons,125 and he reiterated, "We are prepared to 
continue to provide to Iran items which will help in 
her defense but wish to see the hostage issue behind 
us so that we can move forward."26 The Relative 
responded that he was "confident" the hostage issue 
"would be resolved."127 
252 
The Da'wa Prisoners: Less that two weeks before 
the meeting with the Relative, Allen had observed 
that "[m]ore and more, we suspect that some Hizbal-
lah leaders would be willing to settle for the release 
of the [hostages] for Shia prisoners held by [the] the 
Southern Lebanese Army."123 
Cave agreed with this analysis. He believed that the 
families of the Southern Lebanese Army prisoners 
might place enough pressure on the Hizballah to force 
an exchange of the American hostages for the Lahad 
prisoners.129 
Despite these assessments, the Da'wa prisoners 
were discussed at the meeting with the Relative. 
North said the United States could not intervene in 
Kuwait.'" He predicted, however, that Kuwait 
would free the prisoners in phases "if the Govern-
ment of Iran goes privately to Kuwait and promises 
them no terrorism."3' North said that the Kuwaiti 
position "seem[ed] reasonable" and advised the Irani-
ans to approach Kuwait. Later, when the parties pre-
pared a summary of the two days of meetings, North 
himself added "the point about the Da'wa hostages 
and Kuwait and Kuwait's desire for a guarantee 
against terrorism" to the list.132 
Saddam Hussein: The Relative also sought to enlist 
the support of the United States in the removal of 
Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein. The Relative said 
the Gulf countries, friendly to the United States, 
should end their support for Hussein. North respond-
ed that the United States could "make no commit-
ment about getting rid of Hussein," even though 
"[w]e agree that there is a need for a non-hostile 
regime in Baghdad."33 The Relative was not satis-
fied with this response. He returned to the issue the 
next day. He said that "he knows we can bring our 
influence to bear with certain friendly Arab nations 
and it is 'within the power of the Arab nations to get 
rid of Sadam (sic) Hussein.' "134 
Other Issues: The Relative asked that the United 
States join Iran in trying to raise the price of oil.135 
North did not address this proposal at the time but 
later he observed that the oil market was "naturally 
depressed."36 He also stated that the United States 
and Iran had "similar interests with respect to oil."37 
The Relative said that the Second Iranian had 
"played a role" in the kidnapping of Frank Reed to 
put "additional pressure on the United States to send 
the next shipment [of weapons]."138 
The Relative also stated that William Buckley "was 
not killed; . . . he died of natural causes; . . . he had 
three heart attacks."39 According to Cave, the 
Americans challenged the Relative's assertion that 
Buckley had died a natural death.'" They also ques-
tioned the Relative on the complicity of the Revolu-
tionary Guards in Buckley's interrogation and torture, 
but the Relative denied it. Cave nevertheless conclud-
ed that the Revolutionary Guards had interrogated 
Buckley.141

Chapter 14 
Joint Commission: The Relative proposed a joint 
commission of Iranians and Americans to develop the 
relationship between the countries, and North ap-
pointed Secord, Cave, and himself as the American 
representatives.142 
North also promised the Relative that President 
Reagan would signal his appreciation for Iran's with-
holding of landing rights for a hijacked Pan American 
flight.'" 
The Intermediaries: The Second Contact accompa-
nied the Relative to the United States. In the midst of 
the negotiations, he raised with Hakim the question of 
his compensation for participating in the opening of 
the Second Channel. Hakim returned to the room 
and, with North, Secord, Cave, and the Relative 
present "made sure" that the subject of "financial 
remuneration" for himself and the other Iranians 
"would not be forgotten.9,144 
When the first day of talks had concluded, North 
and Hakim led the Relative from the Old Executive 
Office Building to the White House and conducted a 
guided tour.'" Hakim said the tour covered "every 
corner of the White House," including the Oval 
Office.'" 
During the tour, North paused before the portrait 
of President Theodore Roosevelt and told the Rela-
tive of Roosevelt's arbitrating an end to the Russo-
Japanese War of 1904-05, for which Roosevelt won 
the Nobel Peace Prize. He said that the United States 
would be willing to arbitrate an end to the Iran-Iraq 
conflict. North repeated the same theme in reports to 
Poindexter the following day during and after the 
talks: 
Talks going extremely well. They and we want 
to move quickly beyond the "obstacle" of the 
hostages. Sincerely believe that RR can be instru-
mental in bringing about an end to Iran/Iraq 
war?a la Roosevelt w/ Russo-Japanese war in 
1904. Anybody for RR getting the same 
prize?'47 
You can brief RR that we seem to be headed in a 
vy positive direction on this matter and have 
hopes that the hostage resolution will lead to a 
significant role in ending the Iran/Iraq war.'" 
Preparations for Frankfurt 
At the Washington talks, the Relative had suggested 
another meeting. In the meantime, the Relative kept 
in touch with North through Secord and Hakim. 
North advised Poindexter in an October 2 memo-
randum that the Relative reported that there was now 
an "internal consensus on how to proceed with regard 
to the hostages 'obstacle,'" and that, at the next meet-
ing, he would bring one of the officials who had been 
involved in the discussions with McFarlane in 
Tehran.'" The Relative also asked for a "definitive 
sampling of intelligence."'" North said the Relative 
gave the intelligence a "higher priority . . . than any 
other assistance we could provide."151 He also re-
ported that the Relative was bringing a Koran for the 
President. 
The memorandum recommended that: 
?North be authorized to meet again with the 
Relative. 
?The President inscribe a Bible with an appro-
priate inscription from Galatians, 3:8 to be given 
to the Relative.152 
?Poindexter prohibit anyone other than North, 
Cave, and Secord from having contacts with Ira-
nian intermediaries. 
?The United States provide intelligence to 
Iran.153 
North explained how intelligence could be provided 
without giving Iran an advantage in the war. He 
suggested that a "mix of factual and bogus informa-
tion could be provided at this meeting which will 
satisfy their concerns about 'good faith' . . 
In conclusion, North observed that: 
A memo from you to the President has not been 
prepared for obvious reasons. It is hoped that 
between now and 3:00 p.m. Friday you will have 
an opportunity to privately discuss this with the 
President and obtain his approvals/signatures on 
the steps indicated above. '55 
North did not explain the "obvious reasons" for not 
preparing a memorandum for the President. By giving 
the Iranians a Bible signed by the President, North 
provided Iran with proof that was used as evidence of 
the President's involvement. 
North reported to Poindexter that Nir and the 
Second Iranian were besieging North and Cave with 
phone calls inquiring about the status of the Second 
Iranian's request for the additional HAWK parts and 
TOWs discussed at the London meeting in August. 
North noted that, although Nir was in a "supporting 
role rather than acting as a primary source of con-
trol" in the Second Channel, continued Israeli partici-
pation was desirable for political and operational rea-
sons.156 North recommended that Secord be sent to 
Israel to "ameliorate Nir's angst over his 'new 
status'."157 
With Poindexter's approval, Secord met Nir on Oc-
tober 5 in Israel. He delivered a letter from President 
Reagan to the Israeli Prime Minister thanking him for 
his efforts in furthering the Iran initiative and lauding 
Nir's work. Secord assured Nir that he would contin-
ue to be consulted, and he conveyed the President's 
reaffirmation of his commitment to the Prime Minister

Chapter 14 
that the Iran initiative continued to be a joint venture 
project.158 North's enthusiasm for the Second Chan-
nel was shared by others. On October 3, Poindexter 
sent McFarlane a PROF note attributing much of the 
success with the Second Channel to McFarlane him-
self and saying that a "group release" of the hostages 
was still the objective: 
Your trip to Tehran paid off. You did get 
through to the top. They are playing our line 
back to us. They are worried about Soviets, Af-
ghanistan, and their economy. They realize that 
the hostages are obstacle (sic) to any productive 
relationship with us. They want to remove the 
obstacle. [The Relative has been in Beirut, says 
he has good news for Frankfort (sic). We shall 
see. Still insisting on group release. If this comes 
off may ask you to do a second round after the 
hostages are back. Keep your fingers crossed.159 
McFarlane wrote a PROF note back to Poindexter 
the next day saying, "[i]f you think it would be of any 
value, I might be able to take a couple of months off 
and work on the problem. 
"160 
This optimism continued even though more Ameri-
cans were kidnapped in Lebanon shortly before the 
meeting with the Relative in Washington. Reed was 
seized on September 9, and Joseph Ciccipio was taken 
hostage three days later. In an attachment to his Oc-
tober 2 memo, North attributed the Ciccipio kidnap-
ping to the Second Iranian but blamed Reed's abduc-
tion, which the Relative had fixed on the Second 
Iranian, on another group.161 And on October 21, 
just before the second set of October meetings in 
Germany, Edward Tracy was kidnapped. 
Chasing the Horizon Frankfurt, 
October 6-8 
The U.S. negotiating position suffered dramatic ero-
sion in Frankfurt. The concessions made included 
mainstay principles of American policy on the Middle 
East and terrorism. In his testimony, when questioned 
about these concessions, North asserted that he had 
"lied every time [he] met the Iranians."162 
The meetings began on October 6. North, Secord, 
Hakim, and Cave represented the United States. The 
Relative appeared for the Iranians, along with a Rev-
olutionary Guard intelligence officia1.163 The intelli-
gence officer was not a new face for North, Secord, 
and Hakim. He had attended the first meeting with 
Ghorbanifar and the Second Iranian in Frankfurt on 
February 25-26, and was given a briefing there on 
U.S. intelligence by Secord. He had also participated 
in the negotiations with the McFarlane party in Tehe-
ran in May. 
Because of his persistently negative positions and 
his insistence on concessions to Iran, the Americans 
called him "the monster."164 Hakim, for his part, saw 
254 
the man as "the engine" because he was the "heart" 
behind the Iran initiative.165 To Hakim, this man was 
the key to an agreement. 
In the negotiations, the Engine described himself as 
the "extraordinary representative of the cooperative 
that has been assigned to deal with the relationship 
with the United States"166 He made clear, however, 
that there was no unanimity within the Government 
of Iran on establishing a relationship with the United 
States. 
The agenda at Frankfurt was the familiar one: 
Arms and Intelligence: Speaking for the Americans, 
Secord told the Iranians that the President had ap-
proved the transfer of HAWK parts, high-powered 
radars, 500 TOWs, and three pallets of free medical 
supplies.167 
North went further by dropping the restriction 
against offensive weapons. The "only" limitation was 
that the sales not include items that would "allow or 
encourage" the Army or the Revolutionary Guards to 
seize Baghdad.168 The Relative had candidly admit-
ted in Washington that he wanted artillery to make 
Iranian infantry attacks more successful.169 
The only "problem" North cited with providing 
the howitzers and the 500 howitzer barrels requested 
in Washington was that the numbers involved would 
force the Americans to open a production line. 
Secord suggested that Iran go to a friendly third 
country for the artillery, and the United States would 
"look the other way."7? North assured the Iranians 
that ". . . all of this and more can be done, but we 
need to fireproof our President by removing the ob-
stacle." North then provided the Iranians with what 
he described as "very sensitive intelligence . . ." 
North added that, "[i]f it ever became known that we 
have done this, we would be finished in terms of 
credibility as long as President Reagan is Presi-
dent."171 Cave described the intelligence that he had 
brought172?some of which contained erroneous in-
formation. '' 
Hostages: North and Secord said that only the hos-
tages stood in the way of a great era of Iranian-
American relations, a period that would include arms 
transfers involving the Foreign Military Sales Pro-
gram from the United States to Iran and great finan-
cial support for rebuilding the war-torn economy. 
The hostages were the "obstacles," the term used to 
describe them throughout the meetings. 
The Engine insisted that the Iranians did not hold 
the hostages and that, if they did, they would have 
resolved the problem as they had the Embassy hos-
tages.174 Iran could not guarantee that the Lebanese 
would listen "100 percent" to Iranians on hostage 
matters, he said.175 
The Engine added that there was no full agreement 
in Iran on the release of the hostages. He explained 
that his role was to ". . . gain the Iranian confidence 
and the Lebanese confidence." Turning to North, he

Chapter 14 
asked the Americans to "[p]lease, show me the way" 
to resolve the impasse.'" North responded that the 
Americans sympathized with the Iranians' problems in 
gaining the release of the hostages. 
Saddam Hussein: In Frankfurt, the Americans ac-
cepted the Iranians' position on Hussein. Poindexter 
testified that the matter was not discussed with the 
President.'" The President told the Tower Board 
that the statements made by the American negotiators 
were "absolute fiction."178 
North said that the United States sought peace in a 
way that "it becomes very evident to everybody that 
the guy who is causing the problem is Saddam Hus-
sein." North said that Iran was no threat to the other 
countries in the region, and he repeated that Hussein 
prevented peace.'" The Engine asked North, "[D]o 
you really believe this?"18? North replied that he did 
and that the "inner circle of our Government knows 
that." 
North purported to convey the President's view of 
President Hussein: "Sadam Hussein is a [expletive]." 
Hakim, acting as interpreter, demurred at the harsh-
ness of the expletive, but North urged a faithful trans-
lation saying, "Go ahead. That's his [the President's] 
word, not mine."181 
As the negotiations continued, North returned to 
the fate of President Hussein. He declared that "[w]e 
also recognize that Saddam Hussein must go," and 
North described how this could be accomplished.182 
The Da'wa Prisoners: When the Engine asked North 
to "show me the way" to gain the confidence of the 
Lebanese captors and his fellow Iranian officials, 
North provided two quick answers: First, he said, 
"[1]et me give you some ammunition for your guns." 
Then he brought up the Da'wa prisoners.'" 
North said he recognized the desire of the Shi'ite 
captors to obtain the release of their "brethren who 
are held in Kuwait as convicted terrorists.'9184 He 
assured the Iranians, that, although the United States 
had told Kuwait that the Da'wa prisoners were "their 
business," the United States would not criticize 
Kuwait should Kuwait release them.'" The United 
States had recently conveyed this position to Kuwait, 
North added. Although a North notebook entry indi-
cates that he and Poindexter had met with the Kuwai-
ti Foreign Minister on October 3,188 the Committees 
have been unable to determine what was discussed. 
What is indisputable is that at various meetings with 
the Second Channel, representatives of Iran?a nation 
classified by the United States as a supporter of ter-
rorism?North offered assistance in gaining the re-
lease of Da'wa terrorists. Whether that assistance con-
sisted of not protesting the release, or more, it was 
contrary to U.S. policy against terrorism. 
Thus, North claimed to the Iranians that the Ku-
waiti position was "simple": Kuwait would release the 
prisoners over time in exchange for a promise from 
"somebody in authority" that there would be no more 
attacks on the Amir of Kuwait.'" 
Cave told the Committees that the Americans em-
phasized that they distinguished between the Da'wa 
prisoners given relatively brief prison terms and those 
who received longer sentences. Cave said the Ameri-
cans also made it clear that they would not intervene 
on behalf of the three Da'wa prisoners sentenced to 
death.188 The transcripts of the Frankfurt meetings 
do not show such distinctions, and North testified to 
none. Although the transcripts are not complete, they 
contain considerable discussion on the Da'wa. But 
even if the distinction was drawn, any intervention 
was against U.S. policy. 
Peace Broker: From time to time North discussed 
President Reagan's interest in resolving the Iran-Iraq 
war on "honorable" terms. North even created a fan-
ciful meeting between himself and the President at 
Camp David in which he showed the President the 
Relative's arms list. According to North, President 
Reagan then ordered North to "[s]top coming in and 
looking like a gun merchant." At this point, he said, 
President Reagan struck the table and declared, "I 
want to end the war."189 
As North presented the Bible inscribed by the 
President, he created another apocryphal session with 
the President. President Reagan was depicted as 
having returned from a weekend of prayer for guid-
ance on whether to authorize North to tell the Irani-
ans that "[w]e accept the Islamic Revolution." North 
said that the President gave him the passage that he 
later inscribed in the Bible with the observation: 
"This is a promise that God gave to Abraham. Who 
am Ito say that we should not do this?"18? 
Starting Points: North presented a handwritten list 
of seven points that he said the President had author-
ized. 
1. Iran provides funds for 500 TOWs and remain-
der of HAWK parts. 
2. Within 9 days we deliver [HAWK] parts and 
TOWs (500) plus medical supplies. 
3. All American hostages released. 
4. Iran provides funds for 1500 TOWs. 
5. Within 9 days we will deliver: 
*1500 TOWs 
*Technical support for HAWKs 
*Updated intelligence on Iraq 
*Communications team 
6. Iran will then: 
*Release [John] Pattis 
*Provide body of [William] Buckley 
*Provide copy of Buckley debrief 
7. United States will then:

Chapter 14 
*Identify sources for other items on [the Rela-
tive's arms] list. . . 
*Iran will then work to release other hos-
tages.' 92 
Counterpoints: The next day, the Engine responded 
with his own list: 
1. The United States would establish a timetable 
for the delivery of the arms on the Relative's list, 
thus committing itself to providing offensive and 
defensive arms. 
2. One hostage would then be released. 
3. A timetable and a location would be estab-
lished for the exchange of intelligence; and the 
United States and Iran would evaluate the Rus-
sian, Afghanistan, and Iraq situation. 
4. Iran would "only promise" to gain the release 
of the remaining two American hostages but this 
was to be linked to American progress on the 
Da'wa prisoners. The Engine made clear that the 
release of the Americans and the Da'was would 
have to "wash." "They would have to coincide 
or have some other logical correlation."193 
5. Shipment of the eight items on the Relative's 
list would proceed based upon mutually agreed-
upon priorities and quantities. Iran would try?
but not promise?to locate and arrange the re-
lease of the other two hostages. 
6. The United States would contact Kuwait to 
make sure that there are no problems with the 
release of the Da'wa prisoners. 
7. The United States and Iran would agree to 
work within the framework of the Hague settle-
ment process to provide Iran with military items, 
such as F-14 spare parts, that Iran had paid for 
under the Shah's rule but that had been embar-
goed after the Embassy seizure.'" 
By way of "clarification," the Engine added two 
other points to his list: John Pattis, a United States 
citizen, who had been arrested in Tehran as an al-
leged spy, would not be considered in this round of 
discussions, and the status of the Shi'ite prisoners held 
by the Southern Lebanese Army in Lebanon would 
be left to the Lebanese themselves to resolve."5 
Ambassador Extraordinaire 
The Engine presented his counterproposals to an anx-
ious group. North had to return to Washington, and 
all parties were worried that their prolonged discus-
sions might attract the attention of local authorities. 
As North prepared to leave, he told the Iranians that 
their differences were so great that Iran and the 
United States would "pass each other like ships in the 
256 
night."126 The Relative, in turn, accused the Ameri-
cans of maintaining that they were pursuing long-term 
relations with Iran while focusing on the hostages as 
"the only thing that is being discussed."97 
North was not prepared to give up and suggested 
to the group, "[W]hy don't you guys hold this discus-
sion after I'm gone, OK?" He left his seven-point 
proposal behind, saying "[t]his list was given to me by 
the President of the United States of America. And 
there's no way on God's green earth that I'm going to 
violate my instructions. . . . That's the President's 
authorized list. That's all he authorized . . . . In fact, 
he told me 'don't give away more than you have 
to'?that is everything he authorized me to talk 
about."' 98 
North then was gone. Secord, too, left to attend to 
business in Brussels. Cave also departed. North had 
said that, if by the time he reached Washington there 
was no acceptable proposal, he would report to Poin-
dexter that the meeting was unsuccessful and that the 
Second Channel would have to be closed.'" 
Hakim testified that North left him to negotiate 
with the Iranians. 299 
Q: Did you feel like you had been the Secretary 
of State for a day? 
A: I would not accept that position for any 
money in the world, sir. 
Q: Well, you had it better than the Secretary of 
State in some sense. You didn't have to get con-
firmed; correct? 
A: I still believe that I have it better than the 
Secretary . . . . I can achieve more, too. 
Q: And if this initiative had succeeded, did you 
ever make any calculation as to how much you 
and General Secord would make? 
A: In what period of time, sir? 
Q: People tend to think in terms of three-to-five 
year plans. 
A: Many millions. 
Q: Did it bother you at all that here you?and I 
say it respectfully?a private citizen was left with 
this kind of task of negotiating an agreement in 
which if it succeeded, you stood to benefit very 
substantially? 
A: What bothered me was that we didn't have 
the competence within the government to do 
what I could do. That still bothers me.201 
Hakim's negotiating guidelines were North's hand-
written seven-point plan.202 This same sheet of paper 
also contained Secord's handwritten addition: "We 
understand S. Hussein must go?believe we can help

Chapter 14 
(after obstacles go) with diplomacy in the Arab world 
. . .?continued military pressure OK." 
Hakim completed the negotiations by the time 
North arrived in Washington. In his public testimony, 
Hakim stated that he would be "honored" if the 
agreement was known as the "Hakim Accords."203 
The agreement's nine-point plan differed sharply 
from North's seven-points. Under his grant of immu-
nity, Hakim produced the original version in Farsi. As 
translated by the Library of Congress, this version 
provides: 2 ? 4 
1. Iran provides funds to Mr. Hakim for 500 
TOWs and, if willing, Iranians will provide for 
the HAWK spare parts which remain from the 
previous agreement. 
2. Nine working days from now the 500 TOWs 
and the HAWK spare parts (if accepted by Iran) 
and the gifted medicines will be delivered to 
Iran. 
3. Before executing Item 4 below, Albert will 
provide the plan for the release of the Kuwaitis 
(17 persons). 
4. 11/2 (1 definitely and the 2nd with all effective 
possible effort) American hostages in Lebanon, 
through the effort of Iran, will be released by the 
Lebanese. 
*5. Using the Letter of Credit method, (three to 
four days after delivery of shipment stipulated in 
Item 2) additional 500 TOWs (together with a 
maximum of 100 launchers), within four days 
after the execution of Item 4 above, will be deliv-
ered to Iran. The method of Letter of Credit will 
be reviewed between Albert and [ .] by tomor-
row night. Iran will pay the funds for 1500 
TOWs (the 500 TOWs mentioned above plus an 
additional 1000 TOWs) and the 1000 TOWs will 
be delivered to Iran within nine days. 
6. The United States will start with the technical 
support of the HAWKs (material and know-
how), update of the military intelligence and 
maps, establishment and commissioning of the 
special communication link, and will prepare the 
chart related to the items (provided by Mr. [ ]) 
indicating price and delivery to Iran. 
t 7. Before the return of Mr. [ ] to Tehran, the 
subject of the Moslem prisoners (Shia) in Leba-
* The Letter of Credit will be opened in favor of Mr. [ ] and he 
will make the money for the 500 TOWs available by using 80% of 
the Letter of Credit. 
t After discussion between Mr. Secord and Mr. [ ], it was agreed 
regarding the Moslem prisoners that the sentence (text) will be 
written in the following manner: [end of text].205 
non and the manner of their release by the in-
volved parties will be reviewed by Mr. Secord. 
8. Iran will continue its effort for creating the 
grounds for the release of the rest of the hos-
tages. 
9. The steps for delivery of items referred to in 
the second part of Item 6 above will start. 
The Hakim Accords contain a number of conces-
sions. These include the release of only 1 1/2 hostage; 
the delivery of 500 TOWs before any release and a 
promise to supply 1,000 more TOWs; technical sup-
port for the HAWKs; updated intelligence; and prices 
for the other weapons Iran had listed. In negotiating 
the nine-point agreement, Hakim felt under intense 
pressure from North. In addition to the short deadline 
to complete the agreement, Hakim testified North also 
told him that the President wanted a hostage back by 
Election Day. 2 0 6 
Transmission and Approval: Hakim testified that 
when Secord returned from Brussels he transmitted a 
translation of the nine-point plan to North by secure 
communications device.207 Hakim said he learned 
quickly from North that the President had approved 
the plan.2138 It was distributed on the same day to the 
CIA which noted on its copy: "[T]his is the first draft 
of nine points. There were subsequent refinements 
which are only available at the NSC."2" 
The only subsequent draft with "refinements" 
found by the Committees at the NSC is in an October 
10, 1986, PROF note from North to Poindexter.21? 
Unlike the Hakim version, the PROF note plan in-
cludes Hakim's price for the TOWs, and provides that 
only "some," not all, of the 17 Da'wa prisoners would 
be released: 
1. They [the Iranians] pay $3.6m next week. 
2. We deliver 500 TOWs (no HAWK parts) 9 
daysafter (sic) payment. 
3. Copp & Sam help prepare a plan for approach-
ing the Kuwaitis to guarantee no more terrorism 
against the Amir and by which the Amir will use 
a religious occasion to release some of the Dawa. 
They will take this plan to the Hizballah as their 
idea (face saving gesture w/ the Hizb.) 
4. Two hostages (if possible, but no less than one) 
released w/in four days of TOW delivery. If 
only one hostage released, whole process stops

on the original list provided by [the Relative] in 
Washington mtg. 
7. Iran does utmost to secure release of remaining 
hostage(s).211 
The plan represented a retreat for the United 
States. The Iranians' position on sequential deliveries 
had been accepted, and the plan did not expressly 
provide a mechanism for the release of all three of the 
remaining American hostages kidnapped before 1986. 
Iran had agreed to release only one hostage. 
Moreover, the U.S. position on the Da'wa prisoners 
was bargained away by promising to develop a plan 
for the release of some of the 17 prisoners. The 
United States had criticized allies who, fearing repris-
als, had freed terrorists. It had cited Kuwait as an 
example of a nation with courage: a nation that, al-
though small and vulnerable to terrorism, was none-
theless willing to imprison terrorists. As the Secretary 
of State testified: "And here was little Kuwait, very 
vulnerable, standing up to it [terrorism]. So we have 
to support them. They are much more vulnerable 
than we. If they can stand up for it, dog-gone it, so 
should we."212 
There were other concessions: a $2,400 reduction in 
price for each of the 500 TOW missiles; an agreement 
to prepare a list showing the price and delivery 
schedule of the items on the Relative's long weapons 
list; and an abandonment of the demand for the return 
of William Buckley's remains and the transcript of his 
interrogation. The fate of Pattis was left for another 
day. The Americans seized in September 1986 were 
not mentioned. 
Secretary Shultz said of the plan at the public hear-
ings: "Our guys. . . they got taken to the clean-
ers."213 
Nevertheless, North reported to Poindexter that 
Cave and Secord had told him that his "donkey act" 
with the Iranians had had "quite an effect." He said 
that the Engine had confided to Secord that if he had 
returned to Iran "without the hope of further help. . . 
he would be sent back to the front. 
"214 
In recommending that Poindexter approve the plan, 
North minimized his concessions. He asserted that the 
"[o]nly changes from my proposal is sequential nature 
of their plan and lack of mention of Buckley body & 
transcript of interrogation." The release of the Da'wa 
and the contemplated supply of artillery, he said, 
could be managed "w/o any great complications." He 
stated that Cave, Director Casey, and the Chief of the 
Near East Division all believed that the plan was the 
"best and fastest way to get two more out?probably 
within the next 14 days." He added, as the Division 
Chief had reported, "the situation in Lebanon is get-
ting much worse and we may be getting close to the 
end of the line for any further movement."215 
North concluded that the agreement was a bargain: 
the United States would get two more hostages out 
258 
for "nothing more than the two sets of 500 TOWs." 
As for the future, North recommended to Poindexter 
that "we shd push them to include the Buckley re-
mains and transcript and then get on with it."216 
Poindexter testified, "I discussed those with the Presi-
dent, and he approved the ones that applied to the 
U.S. Government.217 
Poindexter and North had different rationales for 
approving the concessions on the Da'was. North testi-
fied that, sooner or later, Kuwait would release the 
prisoners "as sure as I'm sitting here"218 and so "the 
United States might as well get something for 
them."219 
Poindexter maintained that since Secord, a private 
citizen, was to develop the plan to facilitate the re-
lease of the Da'wa prisoners, his actions would not 
compromise U.S. policy against concessions to terror-
ists.220 Poindexter held to this position even though 
Secord represented the United States in the negotia-
tions and North had appointed him, with Poindexter's 
approval, to the joint U.S.-Iran commission suggested 
by the Relative.221 Cave stated that he understood 
that the United States approach to the Kuwaitis 
would be official but that the United States would not 
seek relief for the three Da'wa prisoners who had 
been sentenced to death.222 
Whatever the rationale, any intervention to free the 
Da'wa prisoners conflicted with official U.S. policy, 
which was being publicly proclaimed at the very time 
the secret negotiations with the Second Channel were 
under way. In response to an article in Newsweek 
magazine speculating on a trade of Da'wa prisoners 
for the American hostages, the White House prepared 
a "press guidance" sheet dated October 14, which 
reiterated long-standing U.S. policy:223 
The question is not whether we would seek the 
release of 3 or 17 prisoners. We will not negoti-
ate the exchange of innocent Americans for the 
release from prison of tried and convicted mur-
derers held in a third country, nor will we pres-
sure other nations to do so. To make such con-
cessions would jeopardize the safety of other 
American citizens and would only encourage 
more terrorism.224 
Arms Transfer Preparations 
Shortly after the meeting in Frankfurt, North and 
Secord began to implement the nine-point plan. They 
advised Nir that the Iranians would deposit money 
for the shipment of the 500 TOWs. Secord also told 
Nir that the United States would charge significantly 
less for these TOWs than it had in the earlier transac-
tions. This caused Nir concern. He warned Secord 
that the low price could cause Ghorbanifar or his 
financiers to protest and expose the operation. He

Chapter 14 
recommended charging the old price, so the excess 
could be used to pay Ghorbanifar's financiers.225 
But the price quoted to the Second Channel was 
part of the deal for the hostages and could not be 
renegotiated. Instead, Nir and North discussed in-
structing Secord to tell the Relative that the low 
price was an "undercharge" that would have to be 
increased on the next shipment.228 
North, Secord, and an Israeli official met in Geneva 
on October 22 to iron out the details of the next arms 
shipment to Iran. They agreed that the 500 TOWs 
sent to Iran would be taken from the 508 sent to 
Israel in May and rejected as inadequate by the Israeli 
Defense Forces, and that the United States would 
supply Israel with another 500 replacement mis-
siles.227 
On October 27, the flight crew that Secord had 
retained arrived in Israel. The next day, an Israeli 
plane delivered the substitute 500 TOWs to Iran.228 
Under step 4 of the nine-point plan, at least one hos-
tage was to be released 4 days later. 
The switch of TOWs, which North approved, was 
not without risk. The Relative had already com-
plained to North that the TOWs the United States 
had sent earlier had misfired in battle. Secord said in 
his testimony that he had heard the Iranians complain 
that the TOWs had gone "ballistic."228 
Secord testified that he did not participate in the 
decision to switch the TOWs. 
Q: Do you think that was consistent with trying 
to build the moderate power base for the Iranians 
if you are sending them old weapons after . . . 
they've complained before about the quality of 
weapons? 
A: It may not have been, but that was the deci-
sion that was taken by the Government. 
Q: Well, did the Government make the decision, 
our Government make the decision to allow the 
Israelis to make the switch? 
A: Oh, yes. 
Q: Did you participate in that decision? 
A: Not at al1.23? 
Arming the Guards 
As the Americans knew, both the Relative and the 
Engine were members of the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guards Corps. The Revolutionary Guard is the mili-
tary arm of the most radical elements in Iran. As 
Cave explained, "they were the executive arm of the 
revolution."2" The Revolutionary Guard was com-
peting with and trying to replace the regular Iranian 
Army.232 
Early in the Iran initiative, the Americans were on 
notice that the weapons sent to Iran might go to the 
Revolutionary Guards. Ghorbanifar had, in fact, con-
tended that the first shipment of TOWs in August of 
1985 had been seized by the Guards when it arrived 
at Tehran.233 
According to Cave, the Relative told the Ameri-
cans that the February shipment of TOWs had gone 
to the Revolutionary Guards.234 In November, the 
Engine shared with North his hope to build an air 
wing for the Guard.235 
Although the arms were sent to the Revolutionary 
Guard, the January Finding had a different purpose: 
to "facilitat[e] efforts by third parties and third coun-
tries to establish contact with moderate elements 
within and outside of the Government of Iran . . 
(emphasis supplied). The goal approved by the Presi-
dent was to supply arms to the moderate elements to 
assist them "in their effort to achieve a more pro-
United States government in Iran by demonstrating 
their ability to obtain requisite resources to defend 
their country against Iraq and intervention by the 
Soviet Union." 
To the best of the Committees' information, the 
President was never told that the United States was 
arming the Revolutionary Guard. Cave stated that he 
recalled no discussion of whether arming the Guard 
was consistent with the Finding.238 In his last inter-
view with the Committees, Cave still characterized 
the Second Channel as "middle roaders."237 
Mainz Meeting 
North, Secord, Hakim, Cave, the Relative, and the 
Engine met in Mainz, Germany, south of Frankfurt, 
on October 29, 1986, to discuss the promised release 
of one or two hostages and the implementation of the 
rest of the nine points. 
The Mainz discussions began with ominous news. 
The Relative reported that dissension in Iran over the 
initiative had prompted students associated with a po-
litical faction to publish "five million copies" of pam-
phlets describing the McFarlane visit to Iran.238 
Moreover, although the Hizballah was "basically 
under the control of the Iranian Government," a fac-
tion of Hizballah radicals had published an account of 
the negotiations between the United States and Iran 
for distribution in Lebanon.238 These events almost 
prevented the Engine and Relative from coming to 
the meeting.240 
The information in the leaflets and the Hizballah 
publication had not reached the United States. Secord 
later in the meeting observed that, "[I]f it was blown, 
it was only blown inside."241 
The Relative then insisted that North tell him who 
in the U.S. Government supported the Iran initiative. 
North said the President, the Vice President, Poin-
dexter, Casey, and Regan were in favor, and Secretar-
ies Shultz and Weinberger opposed. "No one else

Chapter 14 
counts," and Congress would not be told "until we 
get the hostages out. ,9 242 
North reaffirmed the nine-point plan, saying that he 
wanted to be able to "assure his boss that the plan he 
approved is indeed being carried out."243 North then 
provided the Iranians with a report on steps the 
United States had purportedly taken since the meeting 
in Frankfurt to implement the nine-point plan and to 
otherwise assist Iran. The Committees could not de-
termine whether North's claims were factual. 
North told the Iranians that the United States had 
persuaded another Western government to terminate 
arms shipments to Iraq. The United States also alleg-
edly had private discussions with certain Arab gov-
ernments. When the Engine stated that an Arab gov-
ernment had agreed to put pressure on Iraq, North 
said "That's us doing that."244 The Committees have 
no evidence that North's statement of U.S. pressure 
was true. North testified, though not with reference 
to this, that "I lied every time I met the Iranians."245 
Hostages: North expressed bewilderment that the 
Iranians did not simply "exercis[e] every possible 
amount of leverage they've got to get those people 
out." He found this particularly confounding because 
4. . . we agree that as soon as they're out, we can do 
all kinds of good things." North included on the list 
of "good things," foreign military sales contracts and 
the "formal relationship that McFarlane had held out 
in Teheran."246 "The big problem I've got," North 
said, "is the whole damn appearance of bartering over 
. . . bodies."247 
In discussing the plan for the release of the hos-
tages, North divulged to the Iranians classified materi-
al of particular sensitivity.248 
Arms, Intelligence, Assistance: The prospect of 
American military assistance to Iran if more hostages 
were released dominated the Mainz meetings. The 
Relative informed the Americans that Rafsanjani had 
taken a personal interest in restoring inoperable Phoe-
nix missiles.249 The Relative held out the hostages as 
bait: "I'll tell you what I'll do. You send that techni-
cian to help us with the Phoenixes, I will personally 
get the third guy out, and I could tell you where the 
rest of the guys are. I will learn where they are."25? 
The Phoenix was a complicated missile that re-
quired several technicians to repair.251 The Ameri-
cans expressed concern that if the United States sent 
technicians, their presence might be discovered by 
America's allies. North explained, "If there is a visible 
effort made by the United States Government when 
there's a long list of hostages being held in Lebanon, 
this President is going to get stoned by" U.S. allies. 
To this, Secord added: "[A]nd by his own 
people." 2 5 2 
Secord told the Iranians that he had located the 
man "wl'o ran the HAWK system in Iran for Me,"263 
and could provide them with technical assistance. But 
the hostages were the obstacle. Secord said ". . . [if] 
after Sunday we will still have at least one hostage 
260 
that we score or count against Iran?at least one. I 
think its highly unlikely that we would be allowed to 
send technicians into Iran, to Isfahan."254 On the 
other hand, "if he [an Iranian leader] just goes out 
tomorrow or the next day and grabs those three guys 
out of Lebanon, we'll go back in and rebuild his 
goddamn air force. I built it once, I'll go back in and 
build it again. That was my baby; I built that air 
force?four and half years on it."2" 
Secord estimated that, with his help, the Iranians 
would find in their own depots "a billion dollars 
worth of stuff they don't know they've got?in two 
weeks." 256 
North added that if the Iranians were to get the 
hostages out, the United States would send them "a 
million" TOWs. In fact, he said, the United States 
would "open up an FMS [Foreign Military Sales] 
account and you'd get a better price on them."257 
The Relative added a request for 22 Chinook heli-
copters, then under embargo,259 reconnaissance cam-
eras for the RF-4,259 and the return of $20 million 
which the Relative said had been adjudicated as be-
longing to Iran but which the F.B.I. continued to 
hold.2 6 
The Da'wa: North emphasized to the Iranians that 
he had "already started" on the Da'wa plan. He 
claimed that he had "already met with the Kuwaiti 
Foreign Minister, secretly. In my spare time between 
blowing up Nicaragua."
261 (North, in an aside to the 
American participants, stated that he had spent 7 days 
putting together a plan on the Da'wa.)26 2 However, 
when asked about the particulars of North's seven 
days of effort, Cave said he never heard about it. 26 3 
The Interlocutors: Ghorbanifar was not the only Ira-
nian intermediary demanding money. The Relative 
told Secord and Cave that he had received "ten calls 
from [the Second contact] asking where his money 
was."264 Secord responded that the financial straits of 
the Second Contact were "our responsibility; we'll 
take care of it."26 The discussion then turned to 
Albert Hakim. The Relative complained that Hakim 
was "trying to push this [the whole relationship] too 
fast.9926 6 Secord explained that "we have placed 
Albert [Hakim] under pressure on the hostages." He 
later returned to Hakim's defense by saying: 
Now, Albert told me at the beginning?he told 
all of us?he did not want to be involved in these 
political discussions. He said, 'I'm a businessman, 
I don't want to be involved in political discus-
sions.' Because of his language capability and be-
cause of his association with me?Sam [Cave] 
can't be everywhere all the time?we have to use 
Albert. He has not wanted to be in this role. And 
he's not comfortable in this role.297 
Secord promised that "[a]s soon as the President tells 
us to move ahead, I'm sure that Sam and I can get the 
right people involved in this.9,268

Chapter 14 
Secord's description of Hakim as a businessman and 
a reluctant participant in the Iran initiative contrasted 
with other explanations of Hakim's role. At the Wash-
ington meeting, North had described Hakim as a 
"consultant to our government on Iranian affairs from 
time to time."269 In Mainz, just a short time before 
Secord made his remarks, North told the Relative 
that Hakim was a "consultant" who worked for 
North "in the President's office," that he held this 
position for 4 or 5 years and that he handled North's 
Farsi translations.27? 
Joint Commission: As the United States shifted from 
the First Channel to the Second, there were strong 
indications that, notwithstanding the change, the 
United States was dealing with the same political con-
sortium in Iran. 
This was confirmed at Mainz, when the Relative 
explained the composition of the Iranian factions sup-
porting the initiative. The Relative said, "[w]hen [the 
First Channel] raised the issue of establishing relations 
with the United States he [Rafsanjani, to whom the 
Second Channel reported] was in favor of it, but for 
his own politics he decided to get all the groups 
involved and give them a role to play."271 The Rela-
tive observed that this politically astute maneuver by 
the Iranian official meant that if the initiative "would 
be a failure and all parties are involved so there 
would not be an internal war."272 
The Relative then announced the Iranian member-
ship on the "joint commission." The appointees were 
the Engine, a participant in meetings held under the 
auspices of both channels; the Adviser, who negotiat-
ed with McFarlane in Tehran; a member of the Irani-
an Parliament, the Majlis; and the Second Iranian,273 
the primary Iranian official in the First Channel and 
the man who the Relative had said was responsible 
for Reed's kidnapping.274 The Americans did not 
object even though the composition of the Commis-
sion, including the Second Iranian, "really blew our 
minds."276 The Commission membership demonstrat-
ed to the Americans the true breadth of the political 
union with which they had been dealing all along. 
Saddam Hussein: The removal of Iraqi President 
Hussein from power remained on the Iranian list. 
Secord said that "we" would talk to another country 
in the region.276 He added, "It's going to take a lot 
of talk, a lot of talk."277 
The Release of Jacobsen 
When the negotiators in Mainz disbanded, North re-
ported to Poindexter through Lt. Col. Robert Earl. 
Earl advised Poindexter that the Relative "assures us 
we will get 2 of 3 US hostages held by Hizballah in 
next few days?probably Fri or Sat but NLT [not 
later than] Sunday."278 North proposed that he and 
Secord go to Lebanon to coordinate the release of the 
hostages and to brief the American Ambassador on 
both the third hostage and the "remaining three . . . 
when we get info from Rafsanjani on loca-
tions . . . ." North also wanted to arrange to pick up 
a Soviet tank that Iran had promised.279 
So that the President would get credit for the re-
lease, North urged that the President announce the 
hostages' release "after the AMCITS are in USG 
hands" but "before CNN knows it has happened." 
North hoped that under this arrangement, President 
Reagan would be "seen to have influenced the 
action . . . ./9280 
North voiced the same thought to Poindexter via 
Earl in a PROF note: "This is the damnedest oper-
ation I have ever seen. Pis let me go on to other 
things. Wd very much like to give RR two hostages 
that he can take credit for and stop worrying about 
these other things.1,281 
Secord reported to North that Hakim had spoken 
to the Engine and that the Iranians were caucusing on 
a statement to be made by Speaker Rafsanjani. The 
initiative was in doubt, but the Engine gave it an "80 
percent chance." At the same time, the Engine report-
ed that a second hostage would soon be released and 
asked for another "500 TOWs ASAP." Secord added 
that he did not know whether the second hostage and 
the 500 TOWs were linked.282 
On Sunday, November 2, two days before the mid-
term elections, David Jacobsen was released. 
Exposure 
The next day, the initiative was exposed. The source 
was neither Ghorbanifar nor his financiers, who had 
made earlier threats to do so, but the Lebanese maga-
zine, Al-Shiraa. It had picked up the story that had 
been circulating in the Hizballah broadsides. On No-
vember 4, Rafsanjani addressed the Iranian Parliament 
and acknowledged that an American delegation had 
visited Tehran. After the speech, the Relative con-
veyed to North that the Iranians still wished to con-
tinue the initiative. 
The Americans also wished to continue. Howard 
Teicher of the NSC staff wrote to Poindexter that the 
revelation of the initiative "coming on the heels of 
high-level Iranian visits to Damascus, are the clearest 
possible signals we could receive that the succession 
struggle is underway and United States-Iranian rela-
tions are likely to play an important role in the strug-
gle." He advised that ". . . we must not let this 
opportunity to assess the consequences in Iran of 
these revelations slip through our fingers." He then 
"strongly urge[d] [Poindexter] to discuss our options 
with Shultz and Casey. At a minimum, we need to 
determine how best, other than parts, etc., to signal 
the Iranians in a productive manner."283 
North continued to seek the release of another hos-
tage in return for concessions on the Da'wa. North's 
notebooks show entries about his desire to resolve

quickly the "Kuwaiti United States Da'wa problems 
and the hostages."284 
North's notebooks reflect his belief that the goal of 
securing the release of the hostages justified the initia-
tive, and that the public would approve once the facts 
were out. Noting this, he wrote his conclusion and 
included a notable misstep: "Ultimately on side of 
angles [sic]."285 
Taking Stock in Geneva 
On November 8, 1986, Cave, North, Secord, and 
Hakim met with the Engine in Geneva.256 
By now, each side had its own acute problems. The 
Engine worried that Ghorbanifar, whom the Iranians 
now suspected of being an Israeli agent, might cause 
trouble. He asked Cave's advice on how to "appease" 
him.257 North, on the other hand, stated that the 
burgeoning publicity surrounding the initiative made 
it all the more imperative that the hostages be re-
leased. North assured the Iranians he was "here at the 
order of the President and we still have the same 
objectives as explained in Washington and Frank-
furt."255 The Engine made it clear that the freeing of 
the Da'wa prisoners was a prerequisite to the release 
of the "other two hostages." Once the Da'wa prison-
ers were released, there would be "no problem" with 
the two hostages.289 
The Americans responded that "we had done all 
that was humanly possible by talking dsirectly (sic) to 
the Kuwaitis . . ."290 The Americans concluded by 
strongly recommending that the Iranians send a dele-
gation to Kuwait with the assurance that it would be 
"warmly received."291 
Release of the hostages had, from the beginning, 
been linked to arms sales. Now it was officially linked 
to the Da'wa as wel1,292 even though the Iranians 
had receded from their demand that all the prisoners 
be released. North wrote in his notebooks that the 
Engine said that if "some" of the Da'wa prisoners 
were released, "then something may be possible."293 
On November 9, North and Secord met with Nir. 
They told Nir that the Lake Resources account had 
been closed because some of the Iranian funds had 
become "mixed" with funds for Nicaragua. North's 
notes of this meeting show that Nir told North and 
Secord that Ghorbanifar was asserting that the United 
States was spending Iranian money in Nicaragua.294 
When North returned from Geneva, he briefly 
acted, at Hakim's suggestion, as a ghostwriter for 
Rafsanjani. The Iranians were contemplating making 
a public statement in the light of the exposure of the 
initiative in Iran. On November 11, Hakim asked 
North to "create something for Rafsanjani to say."295 
North drafted a statement that he sent Hakim by KL-
43 computer to be transmitted to the Engine. North 
added instructions that the statement be issued "from 
Iran." He said that it would "help with the Kuwaiti 
situation on which we are now working."296 
262 
In North's proposed statement, Iran proclaimed 
"the enduring reality of its Islamic Revolution," its 
interest in peace, and "His Holiness297 the Imam['s] 
. . . gracious[ ] command[ ] that acts of terrorism are 
not acceptable to advance the aims of the Islamic 
Revolution." North asked that the Engine "carry this 
message for me as a personal favor for the cause we 
both believe in . . . ."298 
The Circle Opens 
The Secretary of State testified that he did not re-
ceive confirmation of the arms sales that had been 
reported in Al-Shiraa until November 10, when he 
attended a meeting in the Oval Office with the Presi-
dent and principals of the NSC. He feared the arms 
sales would continue. He saw the Administration's 
statement?that the arms embargo would remain in 
effect "as long as Iran advocates the use of terror-
ism"?as a license to ship arms to Iran by pretending 
that it was no longer supporting terrorism.299 
On November 14, a day after the President's tele-
vised speech on the issue, Secretary Shultz, at his 
regular weekly meeting with the President, urged him 
not to sell any more arms to Iran. The President did 
not commit himself. Shultz then tried another ap-
proach. The next day, he submitted a proposal to 
Chief of Staff Regan permitting the State Department 
to take control of U.S./Iran policy. This would have 
given State the authority to block further sales. Regan 
said he favored this step, but the President was un-
willing to adopt it.30? 
Shultz appeared on "Face the Nation," a televised 
news program, on November 16. He acknowledged 
that, while he opposed further arms sales to Iran, he 
did not have authority to speak for the Administra-
tion. Not until the diversion of money to the Contras 
was discovered and Poindexter's resignation was re-
quested did the President agree on November 24 that 
the State Department should assume control of the 
Iran initiative.301 
In the meantime, North pursued it. His notebooks 
show continued discussions about the Da'wa prisoners 
and other aspects of the initiative. One note stated his 
intention to seek the support of the American-Israel 
Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to attempt to 
quiet growing concern among Congressional Demo-
crats about the arms sales.302 The Committees have 
no information that North did contact AIPAC. 
North called Nir on November 23 and informed 
him that he had been interviewed by Attorney Gener-
al Meese. North said that Meese had asked him about 
the diversion of some of the Iran arms money to 
Nicaragua. North then asked Nir to have Israel 
accept responsibility for the plan but Nir rejected the 
request. North's notes quote Nir as saying: "I cannot 
back this story."303

Chapter 14 
The Finale 
In early December, Cave asked Hakim to set up an-
other meeting with a representative of the Second 
Channel. Hakim did so and, on December 12, Under 
Secretary of State Michael Armacost and Director 
Casey met to discuss ground rules for the meeting. 
They agreed that the Iranians would be informed that 
the channel would, henceforth, be used only for intel-
ligence purposes between the two countries. 
In a memorandum to Casey that day, Allen warned 
that the Second Channel would effectively shut it 
down if limited in this manner. Allen argued that it 
was "imperative" to change the ground rules to 
permit exchanges "broader than intelligence."304 
The following day, Casey met alone with Regan 
and succeeded in reversing the ground rules. Under 
the new decision, the Second Channel could be used 
for policy purposes as well as intelligence ex-
changes.305 Secretary Shultz learned of this change 
only after the fact. He observed: "Nothing ever gets 
settled in this town." 3 6 
The meeting with the Engine took place in Frank-
furt on December 13. Before the meeting Cave told 
Charles Dunbar, the State Department representative 
and a Farsi speaker, that Hakim would attend only if 
his attorney was also present. Cave declined the con-
dition and Hakim left. Dunbar reported to his superi-
ors that, "[i]t is just as well that Hakim is out of the 
circle. The last thing we need is another five per-
center involved." 3 7 
Once the meeting was underway, the Engine told 
Cave and Dunbar that, despite the press revelations, 
Iran was ready to proceed within the "already estab-
lished framework." He noted that "[m]uch had been 
accomplished by North, Secord, and Cave."308 
He then proceeded to lay out the four issues on 
Iran's agenda. The first was the Iran-Iraq war. The 
Engine said that Iran had "some ideas" on this topic 
but that the "key and non-negotiable demand . . . is 
that Saddam 'and his organization' must go."3" 
The second issue was the delivery to Iran of all 
Iranian-purchased military equipment held by the 
United States. The Engine said that senior Depart-
ment of Defense officials had admitted that these 
goods belonged to Iran, and the Iranians wanted 
them.3'? 
Third, the Engine asked for the new weapons that 
had been "promised" by the United States. He listed 
1500 TOWs and 100 launchers as the items prom-
ised.3" 
Fourth was the Da'wa prisoners in Kuwait whom 
the Engine described as "an important issue for the 
Lebanese." As he had in Geneva, the Engine said that 
if the Da'wa prisoners were released, the Lebanese 
would "be more flexible" on the hostages. He prom-
ised that, in this event, Iran would apply "whatever 
limited influence it has."312 (Cave later told State 
Department Official Charles Dunbar that he believed 
that Poindexter had met recently with the Foreign 
Minister of Kuwait and had urged the release of the 
Da'wa prisoners.) 
The Engine brought up the nine-point plan, saying 
that five or six of the points had been executed. This 
was the first that Dunbar or the State Department 
had heard of the nine points, and Cave had to confirm 
to Dunbar that there was such a plan.313 Cave told 
the Committees that the State Department did not act 
on his invitation to brief Dunbar, and as a result, 
Dunbar was not well prepared for the meeting.314 
When he spoke, Dunbar conveyed the new ground-
rules for the Iranian-American dialogue. He told the 
Engine that arms from the United States would no 
longer be a part of the initiative, and the Engine, in a 
quiet and unemotional voice, responded that that 
"would bring us back to zero." He suggested that 
Dunbar must be mistaken and that he should return to 
Washington for a full briefing.315 
When Dunbar told Secretary Shultz of the nine-
point plan, the Secretary was shocked. He insisted on 
immediately telling the President about it in 
person.3'6 
Poindexter testified that the President had approved 
the nine-point plan as it applied to the U.S. Govern-
ment. Poindexter contends that the deal with Secord 
and Kuwait was private.317 North told Cave of the 
President's approval.318 Secretary Shultz testified, 
however, that when he told the President of the plan, 
the President gave no indication that he was familiar 
with it, but "reacted like he had been kicked in the 
belly." 3 1 9 Shultz continued: 
And I told the President the items on this 
agenda, including such things as doing something 
about the Dawa prisoners, which made me sick 
to my stomach that anybody would talk about 
that as something we could consider doing. And 
the President was astonished, and I have never 
seen him so mad. He is a very genial, pleasant 
man and doesn't?very easy going. But his jaws 
set and his eyes flashed, and both of us, I think 
felt the same way about it, and I think in that 
meeting I finally felt that the President under-
stands that something is radically wrong here.32? 
The President's meeting with Secretary Shultz laid 
the Iran initiative to rest. The President authorized 
Shultz to tell Iran that the United States repudiated 
the nine-point plan and unequivocally rejected further 
arms sales. Further, Secretary Shultz sent a cable to 
Kuwait affirming strong U.S. support for Kuwait's 
refusal to yield on the Da'wa prisoners."' The Iran 
initiative was over.

Although the United States had long before concluded that 
Buckley was dead and, in earlier meetings with Ghorbani-
far, had sought the return of his body, the Relative added a 
new dimension. He stated that Buckley had been subjected 
to a "debriefing" by his captors and that a transcript of the 
interrogation was held by the Iranians. It allegedly ran to 
over 400 pages and contained 200 to 300 "sensitive names." 
Other than trying to assess the damage such a transcript 
might cause, the CIA never systematically attempted to 
determine whether these assertions were true. Cave Int., 9/ 
29/87, at 76-78. Neither the Committees nor the CIA have 
any evidence that a transcript of the debriefing exists.

waiti government of conducting a series of large-scale ter-
rorist attacks in Kuwait on December 12, 1983. Bombing 
attacks were carried out against the U.S. and French Em-
bassies, a U.S. housing compound, an airline terminal, an oil

Accords." Poindexter Test., 7/21/87, at 144. 
204. Hakim provided a translation of his own Farsi copy 
of the nine-point plan to the Committees. It differs in a 
couple of respects from the translation of the same Farsi 
document by the Library of Congress. One point at which 
the two documents differ is in point 4. The Library of 
Congress translation states that the "one and one-half" hos-
tages are to be released three or four days after the delivery 
of the 500 TOWs to Iran. This, however, appears inconsist-
ent with the requirement in both the Hakim and Library of 
Congress version of point 3 which provides that Hakim 
must produce a plan for the release of all of the 17 Da'wa 
prisoners before the hostages are to be released.

Chapter 15 
The Diversion 
The term "diversion" entered the vocabulary of 
American history on November 25, 1986, when the 
media, covering Attorney General Edwin Meese's 
press conference, reported a "diversion of funds" for 
the Contras from the Iran arms sales. The diversion 
immediately became the focus of the public's atten-
tion: Whose idea was it? Who approved it? When? 
Who knew of it? How much was diverted? 
The Committees were able to answer these ques-
tions, but only partly, because of contradictions in the 
record, the destruction of evidence, and apparent for-
getfulness by officials. 
Lt. Col. Oliver North, Vice Admiral John Poin-
dexter, and Richard Secord all vigorously rejected 
the term diversion, because it implies that the arms 
sales proceeds were earmarked for the U.S. Govern-
ment, and were misappropriated. To North, Poin-
dexter, and Secord, providing assistance to the Con-
tras was only one of a number of intended uses of 
those proceeds. North named several projects that he 
was planning to finance from the proceeds.' Indeed, 
Poindexter saw the generation of money for the Con-
tras from the arms sales as no more exceptional than 
raising money from foreign countries, which the NSC 
staff had been doing with the President's approval for 
18 months. Thus, for North, Poindexter, and Secord, 
the "diversion" was no diversion. But that was one of 
the few things upon which they agreed. 
Whose Idea? 
The generation of profits for covert uses from the sale 
of arms was not a novel idea when North first seized 
upon it. Sophisticated weapons bring premium prices 
in the international grey market for arms, and can 
thereby create slush funds for improper covert activi-
ties that could not be financed through appropriated 
money. 
General John Singlaub had presented such a pro-
posal in a memorandum to North and Director of 
Central Intelligence William J. Casey during 1985. 
The memorandum, prepared by Singlaub's associate, 
Barbara Studley, defined the "problem": 
With each passing year, Congress has become 
increasingly unpredictable and uncooperative re-
garding the President's desire to support the 
cause of the Freedom Fighters despite growing 
Soviet oppression. The funds have not been 
forthcoming to supply sufficient arms necessary 
for the Freedom Fighters to win.2 
The "objective" was "to create a conduit for main-
taining a continuous flow of Soviet weapons and tech-
nology, to be used by the United States in support of 
Freedom Fighters in Nicaragua, Angola, Cambodia, 
Ethiopia, etc." 3 
The memorandum proposed a three-way trade in 
which the United States would provide high technol-
ogy equipment to another country, that country 
would deliver from its stockpiles military equipment 
of equal value to a third country, and the third coun-
try would export Soviet-compatible arms to a trading 
company at the direction of the United States. "The 
United States," the memorandum observed, would 
then be able to dispense the arms to "Freedom Fight-
ers worldwide, mandating neither the consent or 
awareness of the Department of State or Congress." 
The memorandum diagrammed the plan (see Figure 
15-1).4 
North acknowledged receiving this memorandum, 
but dismissed its significance.5 * The Singlaub-Studley 
plan was not implemented, but the idea of using so-
phisticated U. S. weapons to finance arms for anti-
Communist insurgents was known to those working 
to support the Contras before any proceeds from U.S. 
sales of arms to Iran were first received. 
While Studley was developing her proposal, the 
Israelis were acting on a different plan. According to 
the Israelis, North proposed in early October 1985 
using the excess funds from the TOW missile sales to 
support pragmatists in Iran.6 North testified, howev-
er, only that he had reason to suspect that the Israelis 
were using excess funds for covert purposes.7 
By the end of November 1985, the Enterprise re-
ceived a portion of the arms sales proceeds. At 
North's request, the Israeli intermediaries paid the 
Lake Resources account $1 million from the proceeds 
of its August-September TOW shipments. According 
When Secretary Shultz was shown the Singlaub-Studley plan at 
the hearings, he responded that, "[t]his is not in line with what was 
agreed to in Philadelphia. This is a piece of junk and ought to be 
treated that way." Shultz Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/23/87, at 192.

to North and Secord, the money was to cover the 
Enterprise's expenses in arranging five shipments of 
HAWKs to Iran. But when the deliveries were halted 
after one shipment, the Enterprise held $800,000 in 
unexpended funds. North received the Israelis' per-
mission to use the $800,000 for "whatever purpose we 
wanted," and he directed Secord to spend the money 
for the Contras.8 
Thus, by early December, the notion that the Iran 
sales could be used as a vehicle for financing the 
Contras was firmly planted in North's mind. On De-
cember 6, 1985, North remarked to Israeli Ministry of 
Defense officials that he needed money and that he 
intended to divert profits from future Iranian transac-
tions to Nicaragua.8 * On December 9, North recom-
mended to Poindexter that the United States take

control of the arms sales from Israel, and use "Secord 
as our conduit to control [Iranian intermediary] Ghor-
banifar and the delivery operation." 10 This mecha-
nism was adopted in the President's January 17, 1986, 
Finding, thereby avoiding the Arms Export Control 
Act requirement of Congressional notification for 
Israel to continue sales to Iran of the U.S. weapons. 
The mechanism allowed the CIA to sell arms to Iran 
directly or through a "third party," although it did not 
authorize or even mention the generation of profits. 
Nevertheless, by permitting the CIA to sell through a 
third party, the Finding created an opportunity for 
profits to be generated and placed in the hands of the 
third party?an opportunity that would not have ex-
isted if the CIA sold the arms directly. So far as the 
record shows, this possibility was never suggested to 
the CIA attorneys who drafted the Finding, nor did 
Poindexter discuss it with the President in connection 
with the President's execution of the January 17 Find-
ing.

Chapter 15 
In January 1986, the idea that excess money could 
be generated by arms sales to Iran surfaced in another 
way. The Israelis had been promised replenishment of 
the TOWs they shipped in August-September 1985, 
but the United States had delayed action on Israel's 
request. When National Security Adviser Robert 
McFarlane resigned, North found no agreement on 
the price Israel was to pay for the replacements. 
Some Israelis thought that McFarlane had agreed to 
replenish the TOWs for nothing. NSC consultant Mi-
chael Ledeen had quoted a low price," even though 
certain U.S. Government officials wanted the full 
price for the more expensive, improved TOWs that 
Israel wanted. The price for those improved TOWs 
exceeded the proceeds remaining from Israel's sale of 
older model TOWs to Iran. According to North, 
Amiram Nir, the adviser to Israeli Prime Minister 
Shimon Peres, proposed in January 1986 that Israel 
use some of the profits from selling additional TOWs 
to pay for replenishment of the original 504 
TOWs. '2 * 
When the United States decided in January to sell 
the additional TOWs through the Enterprise (not 
through Israel), North and Poindexter agreed that 
part of the profits would be set aside to pay for the 
replacement of Israel's previously shipped TOWs." 
Thus, the plan to divide up the proceeds of the U.S. 
arms sales to Iran was in place when the January 17 
Finding was signed. 
North testified, however, that the proposal to sup-
port the Contras from arms sales proceeds was first 
suggested by Ghorbanifar in late January 1986. He 
did not recall discussing the idea in December 1985 
with Israeli Ministry of Defense officials, although he 
said the "subject may well have come up before [late 
January], but I don't recall it." 14 According to 
North, during a meeting abroad with Nir and Ghor-
banifar relating to the February 1986 TOW shipment 
to Iran, "Ghorbanifar took me into the bathroom and 
. . . suggested several incentives to make that Febru-
ary transaction work, and the attractive incentive for 
me was . . . that residuals could flow to support the 
Nicaraguan resistance." 15 
The tape of the meeting shows that the idea of 
assisting the Contras was, in fact, discussed, not alone 
with North in the bathroom, but with the whole 
group present. This fact does not negate earlier con-
sideration by North. Indeed, Ghorbanifar does not 
seem to have been referring to using the sales pro-
ceeds, but rather to Iran's assisting U.S. interests in 
Central America in return for receiving U.S. military 
assistance: 
GHORBANIFAR: 
(Laughingly) 
*According to the Israeli Financial Chronology, it was North, 
not Nir, who made this proposal. 
And we do everything. We do with the hostages 
for free of charge; we do all terrorists free of 
charge; Central America for you free of charge; 
American business free of charge; [First Iranian 
Official] visit; . . . Everything we do. 
NORTH: 
I would like to see that, that at some point this 
idea . . . and maybe, y'know, if there is some 
future opportunity for Central America. You 
know that there is a lot of Libyan, a lot of 
Libyan and Iranian activity with the Nicara-
guans. 
Regardless of its origin, North believed that using 
the funds from the arms sales for the Contras was a 
"neat idea," and he advocated it to Poindexter." He 
testified that he sought Poindexter's approval upon 
returning from the meeting with Ghorbanifar and Nir, 
and that Poindexter pondered the decision for at least 
several weeks." Poindexter testified, however, that 
he approved the diversion idea after thinking about it 
for only a few minutes.' 8 
Who Else Knew ?a Study in 
Contradictions 
Presidential Knowledge 
Although both Poindexter and North testified that 
they never told the President about the diversion, the 
substance of their testimony diverges from there. 
Poindexter testified that he made "a very deliberate 
decision not to ask the President" about the diversion 
in order to "insulate [the President] from the decision 
and provide some future deniability for the President 
if it ever leaked out." Although Poindexter asserted 
that the President would have approved of the diver-
sion as an "implementation" of his policies, he never-
theless chose to protect the President from knowledge 
of the diversion because it was a "politically volatile 
issue." 19 Poindexter testified as to the success of his 
efforts to provide the President with "future deniabi-
lity" of the diversion. When Poindexter was ques-
tioned about the White House statement (issued the 
day after his initial hearing testimony) that the Presi-
dent would not have authorized the diversion, Poin-
dexter responded: "I understand that he [the Presi-
dent] said that, and I would have expected him to say 
that. That is the whole idea of deniability." 20 
Poindexter testified that he considered the diversion 
so controversial that he understood he would have to 
resign if it ever were exposed.2' Nevertheless, he also 
testified that, in approving the diversion, he did not 
consult Casey, a political expert who had managed 
the 1980 Reagan campaign, and that, only 2 months 
after taking office as National Security Adviser, he 
made this decision on his own. Poindexter had been

Chapter 15 
commended in the Navy for keeping his superiors 
informed." He testified that he had never before 
withheld information from any of his commanders in 
order to give them deniability." Moreover, McFar-
lane, for whom Poindexter had worked for 2 years, 
assumed that Poindexter would have informed the 
President." Preempting a decision by the President 
to provide political deniability?which Poindexter tes-
tified that he did?was totally uncharacteristic for a 
naval officer schooled in the chain of command. 
Poindexter testified at his deposition that "I told 
Colonel North repeatedly not to put anything in writ-
ing on the transfer of funds to the Contras and not to 
talk to anybody about it." 25 * Poindexter could not 
recall any memorandum that referred to the diversion, 
stating that he was surprised on November 24, 1986, 
to learn that a written document showing the diver-
sion had been found." He claimed that he never saw 
the early April diversion memorandum before then, 
although North's secretary Fawn Hall recalled that 
Poindexter had returned a draft of that memorandum 
with changes.27 ** Even when confronted with a 
PROF message, dated April 7, 1986, from North to 
McFarlane, which referred to the memorandum and 
stated that Poindexter had asked North to "lay out 
arrangements for our boss," Poindexter maintained 
that he never asked North to prepare the docu-
ment." *** Consistent with this testimony, Poin-
dexter did not recall North ever telling him in No-
vember 1986 or any other time that all memorandums 
referring to the use of the arms sales proceeds to 
support the Contras had been destroyed." 
In essence, Poindexter's story on Presidential 
knowledge of the diversion was that he had con-
structed a situation whereby only he and the Presi-
dent would know whether the President had been 
advised of the diversion.30 In this regard, Poindexter 
testified that he never told North that the President 
was not privy to the diversion decision.3' 
In contrast, North testified that he always "assumed 
that the President was aware of [the diversion] and 
had, through my superiors, approved it." 32 North 
estimated that he prepared as many as five or six 
memorandums in final form referring to the use of the 
arms sales proceeds for the Contras. These memoran-
dums went "up the line" to Poindexter and covered 
each actual or proposed arms transaction for which 
*In his public testimony?after North's public appearance?Poin-
dexter attempted to retreat from this definitive statement in his 
deposition. He testified publicly that he did not recall telling North 
not to put anything in writing on the diversion. Poindexter Test., 
Hearings, 100-8, 7/15/87, at 44.

testimony somewhat by stating that "Lilt appears that it is possible 
that I saw one [diversion] memo. . . ." Poindexter Test., Hearings, 
100-8, 7/17/87, at 135; 7/20/87 at 282. 
?**He speculated, however, that North might have prepared

ing trip to Tehran in May. Poindexter Test., Hearings, 100-8, 7/15/

272 
payment would be received.33 The use of proceeds 
was described in only one paragraph in each memo-
randum. North's memorandums concluded with the 
recommendation that Poindexter brief the President 
to secure approval for the transfer and provided lines 
on which someone could indicate whether the trans-
fer had been "approved" or "disapproved." 34 North 
further testified that he did not recall any instruction 
from Poindexter or anybody else not to write and 
send such memorandums, adding that "had I been 
given [such an instruction], I would have followed 
it." 35 Instead, North created records such as the sur-
viving copies of the April diversion memorandum 
that called for Presidential briefings and approval.* 
North was unequivocal that the April 7 PROF mes-
sage referred to the diversion memorandum prepared 
by him in early April 1986 and uncovered by the 
Justice Department in November." North also testi-
fied that Poindexter had communicated approval 
either orally or in writing on at least three of the 
diversion memorandums, and that he believed that 
he "had received authority from the President." 37 
Finally in this regard, he testified that early on No-
vember 21, 1986, he assured Poindexter that all docu-
ments referring to the use of proceeds for the Contras 
had been destroyed.38 
North assumed without asking Poindexter explicitly 
that the President knew and approved of the diver-
sion. North had worked under three National Securi-
ty Advisers. Based on that experience, he concluded 
that a decision of this magnitude would be taken only 
with Presidential approval"?a view that McFarlane 
shared.4? 
North told Secord that he had conversations with 
the President about the irony that the Ayatollah's 
money was being used to support the Contras. Secord 
testified that North did not convey these conversa-
tions "in a way that I took it as a joke." 41 North 
testified that he had no such conversation with the 
President, but told Secord otherwise in an effort to 
lift Secord's spirits.42 There is no evidence that North 
did tell the President about the diversion; according 
to White House records, he never met alone with the 
President.

zimski, the NSC's System IV Control Officer in 1985 and through 
October 1986, recalled two such North memorandums to Poin-
dexter discussing the diversion?one in late 1985, the other in mid-
April 1986. Radzimski recalled also that the April memorandum 
attached a proposed memorandum from Poindexter to the Presi-
dent. Radzimski Dep., 4/29/87, at 54-57, 68-74. The Committees 
directed an exhaustive search of White House files and computer 
entries, in which the FBI participated, but no evidence was found 
to corroborate Radzimski's testimony. Further, Radzimski's own 
document log did not support his recollection. Radzimski Dep., 8/ 
11/87, Ex. 3. Accordingly, the Committees recalled Radzimski for 
further deposition, where he testified that there was a "distinct 
possibility" his recollection "is not completely accurate." Radzimski 
Dep., 8/11/87, at 33.

Chapter 15 
North said that he continued until November 21, 
1986, to assume that the President had approved the 
diversion. He testified that, on or about that day, he 
asked Poindexter directly, "does the President 
know?" He told me [the President] did not." 43 North 
testified that the President confirmed this lack of 
knowledge on November 25 when the President told 
him by telephone that, "I just didn't know." 44 
Robert Earl, North's aide, testified that North had 
told him that the President had said "it is important 
that I not know." 45 Lt. Cmdr. Coy, the third office-
mate, who was also present, did not recall any con-
versation about the President's knowledge.46 Fawn 
Hall testified that North told her that the President 
had "called him an American hero" and said that "he 
[the President] just didn't know." 47 
Except for the April memorandum, the memoran-
dums that North claimed he sent Poindexter are gone. 
North testified that he destroyed them. Three drafts 
of the April memorandum were found in various loca-
tions in North's files. They are identical except for the 
precise date of the Israeli September 1985 TOW ship-
ment on the first page." 
Memorandums for the February, May, and October 
1986 shipments, describing the use of the proceeds, do 
not exist. If they were prepared, they were destroyed. 
Casey's Knowledge 
Discrepancies about Casey's knowledge of the di-
version also abound. Poindexter testified that he "pur-
posely" did not discuss the subject with Casey." 
Poindexter's reasoning was that Casey frequently had 
to testify before Congress and he did not want to 
place Casey in a position of having to lie." Poin-
dexter further testified that he had no indication that 
Casey was aware of the diversion aspect of the arms 
sales operation.6' 
North, on the other hand, testified that he "had 
consulted very carefully with Director Casey [about 
the diversion], and he . . . was very enthusiastic 
about the whole program." 52 He stated that he had 
told Casey of the plan to use the proceeds for the 
Contras before the fact, and that he had reviewed 
with Casey (probably in February 1986) at least one 
memo referring to the diversion before sending it "up 
the line" for Presidential approval." 
While still at the NSC, North made inconsistent 
statements about Casey's knowledge. He told Earl in 
the spring of 1986 that Casey knew." But on No-
vember 23, when questioned by the Attorney Gener-
al, North omitted Casey from the list of persons privy 
to the diversion. According to North, this omission 
occurred after Casey had suggested a "fall guy plan" 
in which North and, if necessary, Poindexter would 
take the blame." 
Another CIA official, Charles Allen, became aware 
as early as January or February 1986 of the possibility 
of a diversion. Allen effectively acted as Ghorbani-
far's CIA case officer from their first meeting in Janu-
ary 1986. Allen's notes record that, early in their 
relationship, Ghorbanifar told him that money could 
be generated from the arms sales to support the Con-
tras and other activities. Allen found Ghorbanifar's 
statements so "far-fetched" and "trivial" that, al-
though he recorded them in his notes, he did not 
report them to his superiors." * 
By the end of August, Allen had focused on the 
inflated pricing of the arms sold to Iran and the possi-
bility that money might have been diverted to the 
Contras." Allen shared his concerns that same month 
with Richard Kerr, the CIA's Deputy Director of 
Intelligence, who had succeeded Robert Gates. Ac-
cording to Kerr, Allen told him that the United States 
had overcharged Iran in the sale of HAWK parts and 
that the excess money had possibly been diverted to 
assist the Contras." Kerr said that, as best he could 
recall, Allen did not explain why he believed that 
funds might have been diverted to the Contras. Kerr 
told Allen to monitor the situation and keep him 
apprised of further developments. 
Kerr recalls that he recounted Allen's diversion 
speculation to Gates, who told Kerr that he also 
wanted to be kept informed about the matter. Kerr 
took no further steps." ** 
Allen remained "very troubled in September that 
the operation was to spin out of control." 60 On Sep-
tember 9, he met with North following a meeting 
between North and Poindexter on the Iran initiative. 
North told Allen that the First Channel into Iran was 
to be shut down, and that the Second Channel had 
"flourish[ed] into full bloom." 
Allen was surprised by this information." He re-
turned to the CIA "very nonplussed because I 
couldn't figure out why we would so abruptly shut 
down the first channel unless we had a very good 
plan for shutting it down in a way that Ghorbanifar 
and other creditors of Ghorbanifar would feel as-
suaged . . . ." 62 Nevertheless, the next day Allen 
reported this conversation to Casey matter-of-factly 
and without comment, including a flat, unexplained 
observation that "[t]o cut Ghorbanifar out, 011ie will 
have to raise a minimum of $4 million." 63 
On October 1, Allen took his worries to Gates. He 
told Gates that the Ghorbanifar channel was a "run-
ning sore," and that he was concerned that the Iran 
initiative was "going to be exposed if something isn't 
done." 64 He also told Gates that "perhaps the money 
has been diverted to the contras." 65 According to 
*Later in the year, George Cave of the CIA grew suspicious 
when he learned that the Iranians were paying significantly more 
for the U.S. arms than the CIA was receiving, and heard specula-
tion of a diversion to the Contras. Cave stated in his deposition that 
he did not report these concerns. Cave Dep., 4/17/87, at 158-59. 
**Gates told the CIA Inspector General that he could not recall 
the meeting in which Kerr apprised him of Allen's suspicions. Kerr

Chapter 15 
Allen, Gates was "deeply disturbed by that and asked 
me to brief the Director." 66 When Allen briefed 
Casey a week later, he found that Roy Furmark?a 
business associate of Saudi entrepreneur Adnan Kha-
shoggi's and former client of Casey's?had been there 
before him. 
As discussed more fully in Chapter 18, Furmark 
and Casey met on October 7.67 Although Furmark 
knew of Ghorbanifar's speculation about the diver-
sion, it is not clear that he shared this speculation 
with Casey. Furmark's testimony before the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence is somewhat incon-
sistent on this point." North testified that Furmark 
had told Casey in early October about the speculation 
surrounding the diversion to the Contras." 
In any event, according to North, the meeting with 
Furmark triggered Casey to instruct North "that this 
whole thing was coming unravelled and that things 
ought to be 'cleaned up' . . ." In response, North 
testified that he "started cleaning things up"; he 
"started shredding documents in earnest after [this] 
discussion with Director Casey in early October 
"70 
When Allen and Gates met with Casey on October 
7, Casey did not mention that funds might have been 
diverted to the Contras.7' According to Gates, how-
ever, "Allen shared his speculation with the Director 
about the possibility that some of the money was 
being diverted to the Contras. The Director told him 
to put all of that down on paper." 72 
Allen's October 14 memorandum did not expressly 
allege that the profit from the arms deals might have 
gone to the Contras. Instead, the memorandum re-
corded Ghorbanifar as stating that, "some of . . . 
[the] profit was redistributed to other projects of the 
US and of Israel." 73 
At Casey's direction, Allen and Furmark met on 
October 16. However, it was not until a subsequent 
meeting on October 22 also at the CIA, among Allen, 
George Cave (also of the CIA), and Furmark that 
Furmark raised, for the first time with Allen, the 
possibility that funds might have been diverted to the 
Contras.74 Allen and Cave reported the substance of 
this latter meeting to Casey, who appeared "deeply 
disturbed" by what he was told.76 
Allen and Cave then jointly prepared a memoran-
dum for Casey to send to Poindexter. This memoran-
dum referred to Ghorbanifar's accusation, which Fur-
mark had repeated, that some of the "bulk of the 
original $15 million price tag was earmarked for Cen-
tral America." 76 The memorandum "laid out starkly 
. . . that Ghorbanifar had made allegations of diver-
sion of funds to the Contras." 77 
Although Casey spoke to Poindexter by secure tele-
phone about the October 22 meeting, the Allen-Cave 
274 
memorandum never reached Poindexter. According 
to Allen, the memorandum "fell into the wrong 
outbox," and was not discovered until November 
25.72 
Allen and Furmark met once more, on November 
6. By this time, the publicity of the Iran initiative had 
occurred. The following day, Allen prepared a 
memorandum for Casey which reported, among other 
things, that Furmark had again alerted Allen to the 
link between the overcharges on the HAWK spare 
parts and the diversion." On this point, Allen con-
cluded reassuringly that "much of what they know is 
speculation and cannot be proven." 80 
At Furmark's request, Casey met with him again on 
November 24 at CIA headquarters. Furmark and 
Casey reviewed the finances of the Iran arms transac-
tions, and established that the transactions had result-
ed in excess money. Casey told Furmark that he did 
not know where the excess had gone." 
Before Casey suffered a stroke on December 15, 
1986, he maintained that he had not known of the 
diversion prior to the Attorney General's press con-
ference." He died on May 6, 1987. 
How Much Was Diverted? 
Even the amount of arms sales profits that were used, 
and that were intended to be used, for the Contras is 
the subject of contradictory testimony. The Commit-
tees have concluded that at least $3.8 million of the 
$16.1 million in arms sales profits were used for 
Contra assistance." Poindexter testified that he be-
lieved the entire surplus was used for that purpose." 
In contrast, North testified that the surpluses were to 
be used for a number of other covert projects, and 
that Secord and his partner, Albert Hakim were enti-
tled to a fair profit." 
Secord and Hakim testified that no agreement exist-
ed on how much of the money would be used for the 
Contras: it was within their discretion whether to 
accept or reject any request for expenditure by North. 
North and Poindexter were both surprised that the 
Enterprise still has more than $8 million. Poindexter 
was repeatedly told by North that Secord was losing 
money, and he assumed that all of the Enterprise's 
funds had been spent." 
Whatever the amount or expectations, the diversion 
did occur. Money generated by arms sales authorized 
by a Presidential Finding for only one covert pur-
pose?the Iranian initiative?was used for a wholly 
different covert purpose?Contra support. Arms-for-
hostages also became arms-for-Contras, a purpose that 
was not authorized by any Finding and that was pro-
scribed by the Boland Amendment for appropriated 
funds.

Chapter 16 
Summary: The Iran Initiative 
It was not a mistake for the President to seek an 
opening to Iran. Nor was it an error for the President 
to seek the release of kidnapped American citizens. 
What was wrong with the Iran initiative was the way 
in which the Administration tried to achieve these 
objectives. 
The Administration had pledged that the United 
States would not bargain with terrorists. This Nation 
would not make concessions in exchange for Ameri-
can hostages, because such concessions could only 
encourage more kidnapping. Painful as the conse-
quences might be, the Administration had recognized 
that the United States could not undermine its foreign 
policy to win the freedom of its captive citizens?for 
otherwise, the entire Nation would be held hostage. 
Similarly, the Administration had recognized that it 
was not in the Nation's interest to prolong the Persian 
Gulf War and strengthen the hand of the Ayatollah 
against Iraq. The Administration had therefore 
pledged that the United States would not arm either 
side, but would maintain a policy of strict neutrality, 
and would urge U.S. allies and friends to do the same. 
The Iran initiative broke both of these pledges and 
violated both of these policies. 
It is true, of course, that policies are subject to 
change. Foreign policy is not immutable. But when 
policies are thought ripe for change, established proc-
esses exist in the U.S. Government for making in-
formed judgments. These processes are not mere for-
malities. They are intended to draw on the knowledge 
and expertise of accountable officials, and to produce 
reasoned determinations. In the Iran initiative, those 
processes were deliberately bypassed, and deception 
replaced consultation. 
The President undertook the arms initiative in 1985 
against the advice of his own Secretaries of State and 
Defense, without obtaining the views of intelligence 
community professionals, and without adequate analy-
sis. Secretary of State Shultz warned that the pro-
posed initiative amounted to trading arms for hos-
tages. Secretary of Defense Weinberger warned in 
1985 that it violated the law. Both Cabinet officers 
rejected the notion that the United States could use 
the leverage of arms sales to open a new relationship 
with Iran. A draft National Security Decision Direc-
tive proposing the new arms policy was dropped. 
And the Central Intelligence Agency warned that the 
proposed interlocutor of the new relationship, Man-
ucher Ghorbanifar, was a talented fabricator. There 
was, in short, no adequate basis for reversing U.S. 
policy against arms sales to Iran or concessions to 
terrorists. Yet the plan proceeded. 
The manner in which the President made his deci-
sion epitomized the larger problem. His decision was 
at once too casual and too influenced by emotional 
concern for the hostages. It constituted a major shift 
in U.S. policy, yet it was not recorded in any writing. 
Public knowledge of the original decision comes 
almost entirely from Robert McFarlane, whose recol-
lection has fluctuated. Reasoned analysis was sacri-
ficed for the sake of secrecy and deniability. The 
President's decision was therefore never fully exposed 
to the members of the National Security Council 
itself. Secretary Shultz, for example, argued against 
the proposed policy in December 1985 and January 
1986 at three White House meetings, unaware that the 
President had signed Findings authorizing the arms 
sales prior to each of those meetings. Secretary Wein-
berger believed during 1986 that the United States 
would ship no more than 500 TOWs unless and until 
all the hostages were released, unaware that the 
United States had in fact shipped 1,500 TOWs plus 
HAWK spare parts to obtain the release of just two 
hostages. 
The results in these circumstances were predictable. 
Indeed, given the manner in which the Iran initiative 
was conceived and conducted, there is no mystery in 
why it failed, only in why it continued, particularly 
when promise after promise was broken by the Irani-
an side: 
? At least four hostages were to be released in 
September 1985 after Israel shipped the 504 
TOWs. But only one was. 
? All of the hostages were to be released in 
November after Israel shipped the HAWK mis-
siles. But none was. 
? The Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hof-
shan Rafsanjani, was to meet McFarlane during 
his Tehran trip. But Rafsanjani never appeared.

Chapter 16 
? All of the hostages were to be released when 
the United States completed the delivery of the 
HAWK parts in 1986. But only one was. 
? The Iranians were to release one hostage and 
to exert best efforts to release another after the 
United States shipped 500 more TOWs in Octo-
ber 1986. But only one was released, while the 
Iranians demanded additional weapons before 
they made any effort to release a second. 
As Secretary Shultz testified, lo]ur guys, . . . they 
got taken to the cleaners." 1 Indeed, by the end of the 
initiative, the Administration had yielded to virtually 
every demand the Iranians had ever put on the table. 
Concessions that the Administration was unwilling 
even to consider in 1985, it made in 1986. No price 
seemed too high to North and Poindexter, not even 
promises to help overthrow the Government of Iraq 
or to pressure Kuwait into releasing the murderous 
Da'wa terrorists. And in the meantime, three more 
Americans were kidnapped in Lebanon. 
The record affords some explanation of why the 
Administration persisted?and capitulated?when the 
Iranians repeatedly reneged: the decisionmakers were 
moved by different objectives in hopeless conflict 
with one another. The goals of freedom for the 
American hostages and better relations with Iran re-
quired that the United States create trust in Tehran. 
But generating surpluses for the Contras and other 
secret operations required that the United States over-
charge the Iranians. Stinging the Ayatollah may have 
provided some ironic laughter in the Old Executive 
Office Building, as North testified, but it was no basis 
for building an improved relationship with Iran or for 
gaining release of the hostages. North boasted that, "I 
lied every time I met the Iranians." 2 But the Iranians 
North was so willing to deceive were the same people 
the Administration was depending on to foster a new 
relationship with Tehran. 
With these thoughts in mind, the Committees now 
examine the record in greater detail for the reasons 
that the President and his advisers continued the Iran 
initiative long after the handwriting was on the wall. 
The Attorney General's Advice 
Attorney General Edwin Meese advised the President 
that he did not have to notify Congress before selling 
arms to Iran.3 The Attorney General based this 
advice on an opinion of his predecessor, William 
French Smith, who concluded that the President 
could export arms pursuant to a Finding, without 
complying with the Arms Export Control Act.4 But 
Attorney General Smith's opinion explicitly stated 
that the President should notify the Intelligence Com-
mittees before the arms were actually exported.5 
Meese took this advice one step further and approved 
the sales without advance notification. 
278 
In taking this aggressive position, the Attorney 
General, out of concern for secrecy, did not consult 
with the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice De-
partment or with any of his aides. He did no research 
on legislative history, and his advice was not reduced 
to writing.6 The Attorney General appears to have 
done little more than to express his "concurrence 
with the CIA view." 7 
The sale of arms pursuant to a Presidential Finding 
without prior notification to the Intelligence Commit-
tees or Congress itself was, so far as the Committees 
can determine, unprecedented. The President was en-
titled to more careful legal advice from the Attorney 
General before the President approved the sales. The 
Committees believe that sound analysis and judgment 
would have led Attorney General Meese, like his 
predecessor, to advise the President that the Intelli-
gence Committees had to be notified.8 Had the Presi-
dent been required to take this step, he may well not 
have proceeded with the sales, and the President and 
the country would have been spared serious embar-
rassment. 
The Attorney General served as a member of the 
NSC by appointment of the President. There is only 
one reason to have an Attorney General on the NSC: 
to give the President independent and sound advice. 
That did not happen in the Iran Affair, and the Presi-
dent was poorly served. 
The Hostage Objective 
In his address to the Nation on August 12, 1987, the 
President stated: 
[O]ur original initiative got all tangled up in the 
sale of arms, and the sale of arms got tangled up 
with the hostages . . . . I let my preoccupation 
with the hostages intrude into areas where it 
didn't belong. 
The record supports this candid self-criticism. 
Freeing the hostages was a primary objective for 
the President in the Iran initiative. It was foremost in 
his mind. Yet the President failed to see that, by 
pursuing this objective through the sale of arms, the 
Administration was violating its own basic principles, 
and putting all the cards in the terrorists' hands. The 
Administration, in effect, was creating an incentive 
for the Iranians to continue escalating their demands, 
and worse, to continue kidnapping Americans. 
The President seems to have been vulnerable to the 
pleas of the hostage families. His aides sought to keep 
those families from meeting with him. But this quar-
antine ended in June 1985, when the President held 
the first of several meetings with the hostage families. 
Although the President was also undoubtedly inter-
ested in promoting moderation of Iranian policies and 
opening a new relationship with that regime, his pri-
mary focus throughout the venture was on the hos-

Chapter 16 
tages. Indeed, North told the Attorney General in 
November 1986 that, with the President, "it always 
came back to the hostages." 9 And to be sure, from 
the very outset in the summer of 1985, the NSC staff 
stressed that the initiative could lead to the release of 
the hostages. 
Perhaps the best expression of the President's con-
cern was his statement at the December 7, 1985, 
meeting with members of the NSC. There, as recalled 
by Secretary Shultz, the President brushed aside argu-
ments that the arms sales might violate the Arms 
Export Control Act with the statement that "the 
American people will never forgive me if I fail to get 
these hostages out over this legal question." 10 
The Iranians preyed on the President's vulnerability 
with threats to kill the hostages if the arms sales 
stopped. North's reports of these threats?which he 
may well have exaggerated?came at crucial mo-
ments. For example, after McFarlane's trip to London 
in December 1985, McFarlane thought the initiative 
was dead. He discounted Ghorbanifar's warning that 
the Iranians might kill the hostages if the Americans 
refused to sell additional arms unless the hostages 
were first released. McFarlane's response was to rec-
ommend against further dealings with Ghorbanifar. 
North, however, reported the threat to Washington 
and recommended more arms sales. The President 
directed that the initiative proceed. 
Eight months later, in August 1986, after the Irani-
ans had reneged on additional promises, North 
warned again that the hostages might be killed if the 
United States did not deliver the remaining HAWK 
parts. With the suggestion that the blood of the hos-
tages would be on his hands, the President ordered 
delivery of the remaining HAWK parts. Tragically, 
and ironically, the lives of the captive Americans had 
now become hostage to an initiative that was intended 
to free them. The United States was now providing 
arms not only to obtain the freedom of the hostages, 
but also to keep harm from befalling them. 
The President's concern for the hostages was trans-
lated by North into political terms. For example, ac-
cording to Noel Koch of the Defense Department, 
North told him in the fall of 1985 that the President 
was "driving [North] nuts" to get the hostages "out 
by Christmas." " Although North testified that he 
did not recall such a conversation with Koch or the 
President, he said that "it was clear that the President 
wanted as many hostages home, all of them home, as 
fast as possible." 12 Also, North wrote in his note-
book that the hostages should be released in time for 
the President's 1986 State of the Union message.' 2a 
Then, North wrote of achieving a release in time for 
the President's July 4 appearance at the Statue of 
Liberty Centennial.' 2b And Hakim testified that, 
before he negotiated the infamous nine points, North 
told him that the President wanted the hostages home 
by election day." North admitted that he may have 
made this statement to Hakim, but said that the Presi-
dent had never made any such statement to North." 
The Committees do not fault the President for his 
concern about the hostages. It is a testament to the 
values of this Nation that the leader of the greatest 
power on Earth would devote so much energy and 
thought to the fate of six citizens. But when funda-
mental foreign policy decisions are sacrificed in the 
hope of freeing six hostages, then the Nation itself 
becomes the victim. Every American who travels 
abroad becomes a potential hostage, and U.S. policy 
can be dictated by hostage-takers. 
As the President himself now recognizes, emotion 
must never be allowed to substitute for judgment in 
the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. The stakes are 
simply too great. 
The Position of Israel 
Israel's sponsorship of the Iran initiative, and of 
Ghorbanifar as an intermediary, carried great weight 
with the President and his advisers. Israel has taken a 
strong stand against international terrorism; and Israe-
li intelligence services are among the most respected 
in the world. McFarlane turned to Israel in the spring 
of 1985 for intelligence on Iran because of dissatisfac-
tion with CIA capabilities. 
The Israelis strongly advocated the initiative, view-
ing it as a joint U.S.-Israel operation, and were will-
ing to give the United States deniability?so long as it 
did not subject them to criticism by Congress and the 
Secretary of State was fully informed. McFarlane and 
Poindexter discussed with the Israelis at various times 
in 1985 the Administration's view that, since Israel?
and not the United States?was selling to Iran, U.S. 
policy was not being violated. 
Moreover, the Israelis made a particularly attrac-
tive proposal in January 1986 when Nir told Poin-
dexter that if the hostages were not released after the 
delivery of another 500 TOWs, Israel would bear that 
loss and the United States would not have to replen-
ish the Israeli inventory. Even after this "no lose" 
proposition was rejected in favor of the United States 
selling to Iran through Secord, Amiram Nir continued 
to urge the initiative. 
Yet, the President was under no illusion that the 
interests of the United States and Israel were synony-
mous. As early as June 1985, Secretary Shultz had 
pointed out to McFarlane that Israel had little to lose 
by promoting the initiative: it had no policy against 
arms sales to Iran, and, given the hostility of most of 
its neighbors, Israel was more willing to gamble on 
the prospect of changes in the Iranian Government. 
No foreign state can dictate the conduct of U.S. 
foreign policy. Superpowers make their own deci-
sions. And the United States did so in this instance. 
Nevertheless, Israel's endorsement of the Iran initia-

Chapter 16 
tive cannot be ignored as a factor in its origin or in its 
continuation. 
The Contra Objective 
If Israel had its own interests in promoting the initia-
tive, and if the President was preoccupied with the 
hostages in pursuing the initiative, North was ob-
sessed with the Contras. From North's first substan-
tive involvement with the arms sales in the fall of 
1985, the initiative produced money for the Contras. 
Thus, the Israelis paid the Enterprise $1 million for 
the cost of delivering 120 HAWKs in November 
1985. When only 18 were delivered at a cost of ap-
proximately $200,000, the Enterprise had $800,000 left 
in the bank. With the Israelis' permission to use this 
money as the United States wished, North directed 
Secord to spend the $800,000 on Contra support. 
In late November 1985, Secord learned during his 
visit to Israel that the earlier TOW sales had generat-
ed proceeds that Nimrodi and Schwimmer, the Israeli 
arms dealers, used for purposes other than purchasing 
the HAWKs. The idea was catching. One month 
later, on December 6, North told Israeli officials that 
the United States expected to generate a profit on 
future arms sales to be used in Nicaragua. 
After the Enterprise became the selling agent for 
the CIA in January 1986, North set prices to create a 
surplus for the Contras. He and Secord used a 
markup of more than 200 percent. And when the 
Tehran mission failed, North sought to cheer up 
McFarlane with the news that the arms sales had at 
least achieved some benefit?they were subsidizing 
the Contras. 
It is not necessary, however, to rely on inference 
for the effect of profits on North's recommendations 
to continue the weapons sales. North testified that 
when he was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the 
initiative in January 1986, he found the opportunity to 
support the Contras from the proceeds of future sales 
an "attractive incentive" to continue. 
North's promotion of the initiative continued to the 
end, as he drafted memorandums to Poindexter for 
the President, always recommending that the initiative 
proceed, warning that the hostages might be killed if 
it ended, and predicting ultimate success in retrieving 
the hostages if the United States stayed the course. 
There is no evidence that North ever saw or under-
stood that gouging the Iranians on behalf of the Con-
tras was at cross purposes with gaining freedom for 
the hostages. Arms-for-hostages and profits-for-
280 
Contra-support were conflicting goals that could not 
be reconciled. 
The Profit Objective 
While North sought profits for the Contras (and other 
covert operations), Albert Hakim sought profits for 
himself. He made no secret of his personal motive to 
North or to George Cave of the CIA in promoting 
the Second Channel as a means of continuing the 
collapsing initiative. 
Above all, Hakim was a businessman. He candidly 
testified that he saw an opportunity to make a 3 
percent piece of the annual $15 billion Iranian market 
if the Second Channel initiative succeeded. While 
Hakim saw no conflict between his personal interests 
and those of the United States, he negotiated the nine-
point agreement as if basic principles were commod-
ities open for trade. This unappointed diplomat was 
willing to bargain away the most fundamental pre-
cepts of U.S. foreign policy to open the doors for 
business with Iran. 
The fault, however, does not lie with Hakim. He 
was left by North to negotiate the agreement; his plan 
was approved by North and Poindexter, and accord-
ing to Poindexter, by the President (who was not told 
that Hakim had negotiated it); and his ulterior pur-
poses were well known. 
Arms-for-profit thus entered the list of colliding 
objectives in the Iran initiative. Privatization of for-
eign policy had its costs. 
* * * * * 
Too many drivers?and never the right ones?
steering in too many different directions took the Iran 
initiative down the road to failure. In the end, there 
was no improved relationship with Iran, no lessening 
of its commitment to terrorism, and no fewer Ameri-
can hostages. 
The Iran initiative succeeded only in replacing 
three American hostages with another three, arming 
Iran with 2,004 TOWs and more than 200 vital spare 
parts for HAWK missile batteries, improperly gener-
ating funds for the Contras and other covert activities 
(although far less than North believed), producing 
profits for the Hakim-Secord Enterprise that in fact 
belonged to the U.S. taxpayers, leading certain NSC 
and CIA personnel to deceive representatives of their 
own Government, undermining U.S. credibility in the 
eyes of the world, damaging relations between the 
Executive and the Congress, and engulfing the Presi-
dent in one of the worst credibility crises of any 
Administration in U.S. history.

Chapter 17 
Exposure and Concealment: Introduction 
The covert operation to support the Contras had been 
functioning for over a year when, on October 5, 1986, 
one of the resupply planes was shot down in Nicara-
gua with Eugene Hasenfus on board?and the secret 
program began to unravel. 
Administration officials denied both publicly and in 
testimony to Congress that the U.S. Government had 
any connection to the Hasenfus flight. Nonetheless, 
investigations were commenced by the FBI and the 
Customs Service, which, if continued uninterrupted, 
might have uncovered both the Contra and Iran 
covert actions and Secord's Swiss bank accounts. 
North and Poindexter moved promptly to delay and 
narrow those investigations. 
At about the same time, a threat of exposure came 
from a different quarter. Roy Furmark, a business 
associate of Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi and a 
former client of CIA Director Casey, told Casey that 
Khashoggi and two Canadian investors had lost $10 
million on the Iran arms sales. He warned Casey that 
the Canadians might sue for return of the $10 million, 
claiming that the money had been used by the U.S. 
Government for activity in Central America. Accord-
ing to North, Casey advised him at about this time to 
destroy documents relating to the covert Contra sup-
port operation. 
Then, on November 2, 1986, David Jacobsen was 
released from captivity in Lebanon?the last of the 
three Americans to be released as part of the Iran 
initiative. His release was announced and applauded 
by the White House on November 3, 1986. 
On the same day, a Lebanese magazine, Al-Shiraa, 
reported that the United States had sold arms to Iran, 
and that Robert McFarlane had visited Tehran. This 
report soon surfaced in the American press, evoking 
strong criticism from all quarters. The President was 
accused of making concessions to terrorists and of 
violating the law in selling arms to Iran. 
The Administration's first response to the disclo-
sures was silence. Encouraged by Poindexter and 
others on the NSC staff, the President told his advis-
ers that comment should be withheld so as not to 
jeopardize release of the hostages. 
Silence proved infeasible, however, and the Presi-
dent was forced to comment. The President's first 
public statement was to assert that the press reports of 
arms sales to Iran had "no foundation." Shortly there-
after, on November 13, 1986, the President conceded 
publicly that arms had been sold to Iran, but branded 
as "wildly false" the charge that he had traded arms 
for hostages.* The President also denied on Novem-
ber 13, 1986 that the sales violated any laws. 
A preliminary Justice Department analysis written 
on or about November 13, 1986 concluded the sales 
were lawful because they were done pursuant to an 
Intelligence Finding signed by the President on Janu-
ary 17, 1986. But the writer of the analysis was un-
aware that the United States had been involved in 
shipments of U.S. arms by Israel in 1985 prior to any 
Finding. 
The President's advisers discussed the legal prob-
lems raised by the pre-Finding Israeli shipments on 
November 18 and 19, 1986, while preparing for the 
President's press conference scheduled for the 
evening of November 19. When the President was 
asked about the pre-Finding shipments at his press 
conference, he denied that the United States was in 
any way involved. 
In fact, however, the United States had approved 
the 1985 Israeli shipments, and a CIA proprietary 
airline had actually carried a November 1985 ship-
ment of HAWK missiles to Iran. 
Nonetheless, in the two days following the press 
conference, North and McFarlane prepared a false 
chronology, Poindexter and Casey gave misleading 
statements and testimony, respectively, to Congres-
sional committees, and McFarlane gave a false state-
ment to the Attorney General, denying in each case 
that the United States knowingly participated in the 
pre-Finding Israeli shipments. In the afternoon on No-
vember 21, 1986, Poindexter destroyed a key docu-
ment?a Presidential Finding?which would have ex-
posed these statements as false. 
Not all Administration officials participated in this 
effort to rewrite history. Secretary Shultz argued re-
peatedly for prompt and full disclosure of the facts. 
He warned the President directly on November 19 
*The President maintains this position today. He stated in a 
recent interview that the Iran arms initiative "was not trading arms 
for hostages" (The New Republic, 10/26/87, at 10) despite his 
concession on March 4, 1987 (in response to the Tower Board 
findings) that "what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorat-
ed in its implementation into trading arms for hostages."

and 20 that certain of his subordinates were giving 
out inaccurate information. Abraham Sofaer, Legal 
Adviser to the State Department, warned the White 
House and the Justice Department that a false story 
was being put forward regarding the November 1985 
HAWKs shipment. Provided with this information, 
the Attorney General sought and received authority 
from the President to commence an inquiry on No-
vember 21. 
Shortly after learning of the Attorney General's 
inquiry, both North and Poindexter destroyed docu-
ments. North also altered documents relating to the 
NSC staffs Contra support operation, and he assured 
Poindexter that all documents relating to the use of 
proceeds from the Iran arms sales to support the 
Contras had been destroyed. 
Notwithstanding North's efforts, Justice Depart-
ment investigators found a memorandum on Novem-
ber 22 that referred to the diversion; and on Novem-
ber 25, the Attorney General and the President made 
public the fact that arms sales proceeds had been used 
for the Contras. 
286 
The existence of the Enterprise, however, remained 
a secret until the public hearings of these Committees. 
North concealed the Enterprise?Secord's companies 
and Swiss bank accounts?even while admitting to 
the diversion. He falsely told the Attorney General 
on November 23, 1986 that the Iran arms sales pro-
ceeds had gone directly from the Israelis into ac-
counts set up by Contra leader Adolfo Calero, and 
omitted any reference to Secord's accounts in which 
the funds had actually been placed. The Attorney 
General repeated this incorrect account of the diver-
sion to the public on November 25. 
The disclosures made by the Attorney General on 
November 25 precipitated the President's request for 
appointment of an Independent Counsel, the establish-
ment of the Tower Board, an investigation by the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and the cre-
ation of these Committees; and the secret "off-the-
shelf' companies used in both the Iran and Contra 
covert operations were eventually exposed.

October 1986 Exposure Threatened 
The Hasenfus Plane is Shot Down 
On October 5, 1986, a C-123 aircraft carrying ammu-
nition, uniforms, and medicine for the Contras was 
shot down over Nicaragua.' One crew member, 
Eugene Hasenfus, survived and was captured by the 
Sandinistas. Documents on board the airplane con-
nected it to Southern Air Transport (SAT), a former 
CIA proprietary charter airline based in Miami, Flori-
da.2 
The U.S. Government denied involvement, but sev-
eral investigations by Government agencies, as well as 
the press, commenced shortly thereafter. A CIA Sta-
tion Chief in Central America, Tomas Castillo, sent a 
secret message to Robert Dutton, Secord's top aide in 
the Contra resupply operation, alerting him that the 
"situation requires we do necessary damage control."3 
North Tries to Slow the FBI Investigation 
of SAT 
Within days of the Hasenfus crash, FBI agents 
began interviewing SAT employees.4 They sought to 
determine whether arms or combatants had been sent 
from the United States to support insurrection in 
Nicaragua, in violation of the Neutrality Act. Before 
the FBI agents could obtain any subpoenas, North 
called FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver 
Revell on October 8 and told him he was concerned 
about the SAT investigation.5 North assured Revell 
that SAT was not involved in illegal activities. North 
also indicated to Revell that SAT was involved in the 
arms sales to Iran. North had earlier told Revell about 
the Iran arms sales in late July 1986 during an Oper-
ations Sub Group meeting.6 North told Revell that he 
did not know anything about the C-123 that was shot 
down.7 North said that SAT was still flying arms 
shipments to Iran, and those missions would inevita-
bly be disclosed if SAT was investigated.8 
Revell contacted the Miami FBI office and asked 
for a written briefing on the investigation,? but he did 
not slow it down. Instead, he obtained authority from 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mark Richard to 
begin an official investigation on October 10, 1986.10 
North Tries to Slow the Customs 
Investigation of SAT 
The U.S. Customs Service also began an investiga-
tion after the crash. Upon tracing the purchase of the 
C-123 to SAT, Customs agents served a broad admin-
istrative subpoena on SAT." A full-scale investiga-
tion would have revealed payments for both the Iran 
flights and for arms shipments to the Contras from 
the Enterprise's Lake Resources and Hyde Park 
Square accounts in Switzerland." In fact, during the 
May 1986 Tehran mission, the SAT crew stopped in a 
European country on their return flight, loaded arms, 
and flew them to a base in Central America for the 
Contra resupply operation. One wire transfer from 
Hyde Park Square paid for both missions.' 
On October 9, 1986, North called U.S. Customs 
Assistant Commissioner for Enforcement William Ro-
senblatt and said he was concerned about the SAT 
subpoena. North told Rosenblatt that the SAT people 
were "good guys" who had done nothing illegal. 
North denied that the SAT airplane contained arms 
when it left the United States." Relying on North's 
assurances, Rosenblatt took steps to narrow the focus 
of the investigation to the airplane itself, and whether 
arms or ammunition were being exported without a 
license.1 5 
On October 17, David Major, an FBI agent on 
assignment to the NSC, sent a PROF note to Alton 
Keel stating that the FBI investigation should be 
ending. The note continued: 
However, Customs is going after this case like a 
dog in heat. They have a task force investigating 
violations of (1) foreign asset laws (2) Nicaragua 
trade embargo and (3) illegal export laws. Treas-
ury is running . . . hard on this investigation and 
will most likely trip over legal but very sensitive 
cover CIA operations not related to Nicaragua." 
In the same time period, North called Rosenblatt and 
again assured him that he had "double-checked" and 
there were no arms aboard the C-123 airplane." Ro-
senblatt, who had by then received similar informa-
tion from the Customs agent in charge of the investi-
gation, told North once again that Customs was con-
centrating the investigation on the airplane itself to

see whether special licensing requirements had been 
violated.' 8 
After Customs served a new subpoena on SAT on 
October 29, Craig Coy, one of North's assistants, tele-
phoned to tell Rosenblatt that he had spoken to North 
and that they were concerned about the Customs 
agents being "all over" SAT." Rosenblatt then called 
North, who asked why the Customs agents were at 
SAT, telling Rosenblatt, "We are right in the middle 
of a lot of sensitive business here, I am trying to get 
some packages [hostages] out of here. . . .99 20 Ro-
senblatt told North that the investigation of the C-123 
was going forward and other agencies were investi-
gating as well. North told Rosenblatt to call Coy and 
tell him to take care of the other agencies, which 
Rosenblatt did." Rosenblatt took no steps, however, 
to terminate the Customs investigation, and he had no

Investigations 
Shortly thereafter, Poindexter called the Attorney 
General and asked him to delay the investigations of 
SAT by the FBI and Customs.23 According to the 
Attorney General, Poindexter told him that the SAT 
employees were needed for the Iran initiative.24 At-
torney General Meese also mentioned the Customs 
investigation briefly to Treasury Secretary James 
Baker, but did not rePall discussing it any further with 
him thereafter.25 Meese told Associate Attorney Gen-
eral Steven Trott to ask FBI Director Webster to 
delay the SAT investigation for 10 days." On Octo-
ber 30, Trott called Webster and asked him to delay 
all nonurgent investigative activity regarding SAT,2 7 
telling him that, without the delay, the investigation 
could compromise "sensitive hostage negotiations."28 
FBI headquarters checked with their Miami office 
and was told the investigation could be delayed for 10 
days. After more than 10 days had passed, Trott 
raised the matter with the Attorney General at the 
FBI's request, and several days later Attorney Gener-
al Meese told him the FBI could proceed." 
House Committee Seeks independent 
Counsel to Investigate Hasenfus Crash 
On October 17, 13 days after the Hasenfus crash, a 
majority of the Democratic members of the House 
Judiciary Committee asked the Attorney General to 
appoint an Independent Counsel to investigate North, 
Casey, Poindexter, and others regarding their alleged 
involvement with the Contras.3? The request cited 
the Hasenfus crash and prior allegations by Senator 
John F. Kerry and others regarding activities by Ad-
ministration officials in support of the Contras. The 
Attorney General referred the letter to the Criminal 
Division of the Justice Department, where it was in 
turn referred to the Public Integrity Section. 
288 
Once a request for an Independent Counsel is re-
ceived from Congress, the Justice Department has 30 
days to report back. The Justice Department's Public 
Integrity Section began by asking the other sections 
of the Justice Department, and the FBI and Customs, 
to identify any cases that might involve Administra-
tion officials in the Contra operation." The Public 
Integrity Section learned that the Fraud Section was 
investigating allegations of improper use of humani-
tarian aid through the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Aid 
Office program to provide weapons to the Contras." 
The Public Integrity Section also learned that the FBI 
and U.S. Attorney's office in Miami were investigat-
ing claims that North, Robert Owen, and others were 
providing military aid to the Contras.33 
Customs and FBI officials promised to provide syn-
opses of pending cases. The FBI provided no infor-
mation prior to the appointment of an Independent 
Counsel in December 1986.34 Customs wrote a letter 
on November 14, 1986, which did not mention 
North's requests to narrow subpoenas.35 
Furmark Visits the CIA: Talk of 
"Diversion" 
While the investigations precipitated by the Hasenfus 
downing threatened to expose the covert Contra sup-
port operation, another event in October 1986 threat-
ened to expose the diversion: Roy Furmark, a busi-
ness associate of Adnan Khashoggi warned the CIA 
that, unless certain investors in the Iran arms sales 
were repaid, they would publicly disclose what they 
knew of the arms sales and the use of arms sales 
proceeds for the Contras. 
Furmark?who was also a former law client of 
Director Casey?met with Casey, at Khashoggi's re-
quest, on October 7 in Casey's office. Furmark said 
that Khashoggi and two Canadian investors had sup-
plied financing for the Iran arms sales." They 
claimed to have lost their $10 million advance when 
the United States overcharged and then abandoned 
the First Iranian Channel in favor of dealing with the 
so-called Second Channe1.37 Khashoggi wanted Fur-
mark to see if Casey could get the U.S. Government 
to make good on this loan. 
At their October 7 meeting, Furmark informed 
Casey of Khashoggi's role, discussed the financial 
problems that had arisen, and said that Khashoggi 
was under pressure from the two Canadians who had 
participated in the $10 million financing. Furmark 
warned Casey that Manucher Ghorbanifar?the initial 
go-between for the United States with the Iranians?
was also upset and was threatening to tell members of 
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) 
about the arms sales.38 When Casey suggested that 
the transaction sounded like an Israeli arrangement, 
Furmark told Casey that North was directing the

Chapter 18 
Although Furmark had known for some time of 
Ghorbanifar's speculation that Iran arms sales pro-
ceeds had been diverted to the Contras, it is not clear 
that he shared this speculation with Casey during 
their October 7 meeting. Before the SSCI, Furmark 
initially testified that he "probably alluded" to the 
possibility that some of the money might have gone 
to Nicaragua. He stated later, however, that he did 
not believe that he had referred to the names of any 
countries.40 North testified that Furmark had told 
Casey in early October about the speculation sur-
rounding the diversion to the Contras.'" 
In the meantime, Charles Allen of the CIA had 
heard from North in early September that the First 
Channel was being shut down and that the Second 
Channel had "flourished into full bloom."'" Allen 
was disturbed by this news, "because I couldn't figure 
out why we would so abruptly shut down the first 
channel unless we had a very good plan for shutting 
it down in a way that Ghorbanifar and these creditors 
of Ghorbanifar would feel assuaged."'" Allen shared 
his concerns with Robert Gates of the CIA on Octo-
ber 1. Gates, too, was disturbed and asked Allen to 
brief the CIA Director.44 
Allen and Gates arrived in Casey's office together 
on October 7, after Furmark had departed. Allen told 
Casey of his misgivings. Casey rejoined that he had 
just met with Furmark, who had described Khashog-
gi's financial problems with other investors whom 
Allen understood to be Canadian. Casey did not men-
tion that funds might have been diverted to the Con-
tras.4 5 
In his appearance before the Tower Board, Gates 
recalled that "Allen shared his speculation with the 
Director about the possibility that some of the money 
was being diverted to the Contras. The Director told 
him [Allen] to put all of that down on paper." * 
A few days later, on October 9, North, back from 
the Frankfurt negotiations with the Iranians, briefed 
Casey and Gates on the status of the Iran initiative. It 
does not appear that, in the presence of Gates, Casey 
shared with North Allen's suspicions about the diver-
sion to the Contras.** 
Allen's October 14 memorandum provided a 
lengthy account of the Iran initiative, including a brief 
summary of the recently concluded meetings in 
Frankfurt, the status of Ghorbanifar's financial situa-
tion, and a summary of information that Ghorbanifar 
might expose. The memorandum did not expressly 
allege that the profit from the arms deals might have

ted the requested memorandum to Casey. 
** Gates, Tower Test., at 22-23. Gates did take advantage of the 
opportunity presented by the meeting with North to ask whether 
the CIA was involved in private fundraising for the Contras. North 
responded that the Agency was "clean." In exonerating the CIA, 
North offered a "cryptic comment about Swiss accounts and the 
Contras." No one pursued the comment and the meeting conclud-
ed. 
gone to the Contras; rather, it recorded Ghorbanifar 
as stating that, "some of. . . [the] profit was redistrib-
uted to other projects of the US arifi of Israel."* 
Gates and Casey met with Poindexter the following 
day, October 15.46 Poindexter read Allen's memoran-
dum.47 Although Poindexter acknowledged in his tes-
tiony that the memorandum contained the news that 
Ghorbanifar or his financiers were saying that their 
money went to Central America, and although Poin-
dexter and Casey met alone, Poindexter testified that 
he and Casey did not discuss the diversion. Casey 
simply recommended, according to Poindexter, that 
Poindexter seek the advice of White House Counsel 
with respect to disclosure of the initiative. Poindexter, 
however, did nothing because he did not trust the 
White House Counsel." 
After meeting with Poindexter, Gates and Casey 
directed Allen to meet with Furmark the next day, 
October 16.49 Allen met Furmark, and sent a memo-
randum of the meeting to Casey. Allen's memoran-
dum recited Furmark's account of the origins of the 
Iran arms transactions and Ghorbanifar's current fi-
nancial condition. Furmark recommended that the 
United States consider yet another arms transaction to 
maintain credibility with the Iranians and to provide 
Ghorbanifar with enough capital to make a partial 
repayment to Khashoggi's creditors. As with Allen's 
October 14 memorandum, this memorandum con-
tained no specific reference to a diversion of funds to 
the Contras. According to Allen, he wished to pro-
tect himself from any indiscriminate use of the memo-
randum.6? 
In his meeting with Allen on October 16, Furmark 
gave Allen a rundown of the transactions to date. He 
claimed the shipment of HAWK spare parts in May 
1986 resulted in the release of U.S. hostage Father 
Lawrence Jenco." Furmark warned Allen that the 
Canadians would go public with the "back-channel" 
arms sales unless the United States shipped additional 
weapons through Ghorbanifar so that Khashoggi 
could be repaid." 
The meeting with Allen was cut short so that Fur-
mark and Allen could join Casey and his wife on an 
airplane to New York. En route, Furmark and Casey 
again discussed the arms sales in general." Casey still 
did not acknowledge that the United States had any 
responsibility for the arms sales, but indicated he was 
working on the problem." Furmark suggested, as he 
had to Allen, that Casey promote another arms sale to 
'N 10. Gates found the terseness of the Allen memorandum 
noteworthy. In testimony before the SSCI, Gates stated: "And in 
fact, in the [Allen] memorandum of six or seven or eight pages?I 
don't recall how long it is?single-spaced there is only one sentence 
that refers to possible diversion of funds . . . . There is no mention 
in the memorandum specifically of a diversion to the Contras. That 
reference to me was oral on the 1st [of October] and repeated again 
to the Director on the 7th." Gates apparently believed this news 
was relegated to such obscurity because it was based on "shaky 
stuff." Gates Test., SSCI, at 22, 34.

help Ghorbanifar financially. Casey was noncommit-
tal, but promised to get back to Furmark.55 
North's notebooks show that Furmark's recommen-
dation to generate funds to pay Khashoggi's creditors 
received serious consideration. North wrote of a con-
versation with Israeli official Amiram Nir on October 
22: "Best way to recoup funds to pay off Furmark, et 
al is to overcharge on subsequent deliveries."58 
On October 22, Charles Allen, George Cave, and 
Roy Furmark met in New York. In the course of that 
meeting, Furmark raised, for the rust time with Allen, 
the possibility that funds used to finance the arms 
sales might have been diverted to the Contras.57 
Allen and Cave reported their discussion with Fur-
mark to Casey, who appeared "deeply disturbed" by 
what he was told. Allen and Cave then jointly pre-
pared a memorandum for Casey to send to Poin-
dexter. Allen's testimony dated the Casey memoran-
dum at October 23.58 
This Allen-Cave memorandum set forth detailed ac-
counts (attributed to Furmark) of the early stages of 
the Iran initiative and the financing of the HAWK 
spare parts transaction. It also referred to Ghorbani-
far's accusation, which Furmark had repeated, that 
some of the "bulk of the original $15 million price tag 
was earmarked for Central America."58 The memo-
randum "laid out starkly . . . that Ghorbanifar had 
made allegations of diversion of funds to the Con-
tras,"" but it did not offer an assessment by Casey, 
Cave, Allen, or any other CIA official, of the accura-
cy of Ghorbanifar's charges. Furthermore, as with the 
previous memorandums, the memorandum made no 
reference to Allen's own suspicions that the Ameri-
cans had inflated the price and directed some of the 
money to the Contras. 
Although Casey spoke to Poindexter by secure tele-
phone about the Allen-Cave briefing on the Furmark 
meeting, the memorandum never reached Poindexter. 
According to Allen, the memorandum "fell into the 
wrong outbox;" it was not discovered until November 
25; and Casey was "deeply upset" when he discov-
ered that he had not signed or sent it." 
Allen and Furmark met once more on November 6. 
By this time the feared publicity of the Iran initiative 
had occurred. Allen prepared a memorandum for 
Casey the following day, which reported that the 
Canadian investors?having been deprived of the 
threat of exposing the initiative?were now threaten-
ing a lawsuit over their failure to be paid. The memo-
randum also showed that Furmark again alerted Allen 
to the remaining trump card in the investors' deck: 
linking the overcharges on the HAWK spare parts to 
the diversion." Furmark also told Allen of his dis-
covery that Secord was involved in both the arms 
sales and the Contra resupply operation." 
Allen reported to Casey that Furmark was most 
interested in prompting another arms deal so that 
Ghorbanifar could recoup his money, and that unhap-
py investors could make some "nasty allegations 
290 
against the US Government and key officials" if the 
matter went unresolved. On the latter point, however, 
Allen added reassuringly that "much of what they 
know is speculation and cannot be proven."'" 
At Furmark's request, Casey met with him again on 
November 24 at CIA headquarters. Furmark and 
Casey reviewed the finances of the Iran arms transac-
tions beginning in February 1986. This review estab-
lished that the transactions had resulted in excess 
funds; Casey told Furmark that he did not know 
where that money had gone." 
In Furmark's presence, Casey unsuccessfully tried 
to reach the President's Chief of Staff, Donald Regan. 
He then called North and said "there's a guy here 
says you owe him $10 million . . . ." North reportedly 
responded: "[T]ell the man that the Iranians or the 
Israelis owe them the money." 6 6* 
Once Casey learned that Furmark and Ghorbanifar 
surmised that profits from the Iran arms sales had 
gone to the Contras, he advised North. North testified 
that this occurred in early October after the Hasenfus 
crash." According to North, the meeting with Fur-
mark triggered Casey to instruct North "that this 
whole thing was coming unravelled and that things 
ought to be 'cleaned up' . . . ." In response, North 
testified, he "started cleaning things up;" he "started 
shredding documents in earnest after [this] discussion 
with Director Casey in early October . . . ."** 
The Travelers Check Ledger 
As set out in Chapter 2, North received from Contra 
leader Adolpho Calero a large number of travelers 
checks for distribution to Contra leaders and for a 
variety of other programs. North asserted that he 
maintained "meticulous records" of the receipt and 
disbursement of these checks in a ledger provided by 
Casey." Fawn Hall and Robert Owen testified to 
seeing North make entries in such a ledger." 
North destroyed this ledger, according to his testi-
mony, at the direction of Casey to protect sensitive 
names and information. North told the Committees 
that Casey had instructed him sometime between Oc-
tober 13 and November 4 to "'get rid of that book 
because the book has in it the names of everybody, 
the addresses of everybody. Just get rid of it and 
clean things up.' "7 
* After the Attorney General announced the discovery of the 
diversion on November 25, 1986, Furmark called Casey after being 
subpoenaed by Congress. Casey told him to "just follow us." Fur-
mark Dep., 7/22/87, at 170. 
** North Test., Hearings, 100-7, Part I, 7/7/87, at 19. Notably, at 
a meeting with the Second Channel in Europe on October 29-30, 
attended by North, Cave, Secord, and Secord associate Albert 
Hakim, North stated that he did not care if Ghorbanifar was paid, 
but that "what I'm more interested in is that the people to whom 
he owes money get paid." Cave stated that Ghorbanifar owed 
those people "10 Million." C 298.

Chapter 18 
North's explanation of why he destroyed the ledger 
is inconsistent with other of his actions. For example, 
North preserved his notebooks, which also recorded 
the names of those helping the Contras and included 
numerous references to payments made to them, as 
well as other highly sensitive and classified matters. 
When he was dismissed from the NSC staff, North 
took these notebooks with him and kept them in a 
nonsecure environment, at the same time that he was 
destroying the ledger which had been maintained in 
an NSC vaulted office. 
As a result of this destruction, no written record 
exists to verify North's testimony that checks he 
cashed for his personal use actually were reimburse-
ments for his out-of-pocket expenses on behalf of the 
Contras.7' 
The Fall Guy Plan 
Throughout the events of the Iran-Contra Affair, de-
ception was viewed as a necessary component. At the 
same time, according to North's testimony, Casey rec-
ognized the need for an ultimate coverup in the event 
of public disclosure.* 
As far back as the early spring of 1984, North said 
he and Director Casey had discussed a "fall guy 
plan."72 Their discussion took place in the context of 
Congress' impending cutoff of U.S. aid for the Con-
tras (the Boland Amendment). According to North, 
when "we eventually decided to pursue availing our-
selves of offers from foreign governments [to fund the 
Contras], it was seen that there would need to be 
someone who could . . . take the fall" in the event of 
public disclosure. The idea was to provide North's 
superiors with "plausible deniability"?although in 
this instance, that term meant avoiding accountability 
to the U.S. Government rather than avoiding disclo-
sure to U.S. adversaries.73 
As North's operational role expanded to the Iran 
arms sales and the diversion of proceeds derived 
therefrom, he testified, he volunteered to be the "fall 
guy" for both the Contra support and the arms sales 
operations. In his words, "I'm not sure Director 
*As noted earlier, North's testimony attributing knowledge and 
statements to Casey after Casey's death should be viewed with 
caution, particularly insofar as such testimony, albeit under oath, 
tends to exculpate North. 
Casey ever said, 'It has to be you, 011ie.' It was 
probably 011ie saying, 'Well, when that [disclosure] 
happens, it will be me.' "74 
North made no secret among his colleagues that he 
was to be a "scapegoat" or "fall guy" if the Iran or 
Contra support activities became public. He made this 
comment to at least Poindexter, Robert Earl (one of 
North's aides), and Owen.78 
Disclosure of the arms sales in early November 
1986 triggered discussions about implementing the fall 
guy plan. According to North, shortly after the initial 
November disclosures, Casey told him that he [North] 
might not be "big enough" to be the "fall guy." 
Casey indicated that "it's probably going to go 
higher," and he suggested that "Poindexter might 
have to be a fall guy."78 Although North did not 
recall a conversation with Poindexter about this spe-
cific aspect of the plan for "plausible deniability," he 
did recall that he and Poindexter discussed in early 
November the likelihood that both of them would 
have to bear the blame.77 
North testified that he previously had discussed 
both the fact and necessity of the "fall guy plan" with 
Poindexter and McFarlane (as well as with Casey), 
and that he did not recall any discussion with any-
body about the legal propriety of this plan." Poin-
dexter testified, however, that he "was not a party to 
any plan to make Colonel North or to make me, for 
that matter, a scapegoat."'" He nevertheless admitted 
that "[periodically] 011ie would indicate that he was 
'willing to take the rap.' "80 McFarlane flatly denied 
that any "fall guy plan" ever existed." 
North testified that, but for the criminal investiga-
tion of the Iran-Contra Affair, he was prepared to go 
through with the "plan, resign in disgrace, and take 
the heat for the President."82 (There is no evidence 
that the President was aware of or condoned the "fall 
guy" plan.) Nevertheless, when an Independent Coun-
sel was appointed and North was the only person 
specifically named in the order of investigation, 
North, who by then had retained counsel, changed his 
mind and decided to protect himself.* North testified 
that he did not tell Casey or Poindexter of this 
change in attitude." 
* North testified that, "I never in my wildest dreams or night-
mares envisioned that we would end up with criminal charges."

Chapter 19 
November 1986: Concealment 
The Administration's Initial 
Response to the Arms Sales 
Disclosures 
The reports of U.S. arms sales to Iran in early No-
vember 1986 generated conflict within the Govern-
ment. Some officials, including Members of Congress 
and the Secretary of State, demanded prompt and full 
disclosure. Several individuals on the inside of the 
Administration, however, insisted on maintaining tight 
control of the information. The President, denying 
any arms-for-hostages trade, wanted to say no more 
than that. Members of the National Security Council 
(NSC) staff and the Director of Central Intelligence 
knew that the report from Beirut was only the tip of 
the iceberg. Accordingly, their first move was to ex-
ploit the President's desire to protect the hostages 
through silence as a way of concealing the truth. 
The conflict manifested itself almost at once in an 
exchange between Secretary of State George Shultz 
and National Security Adviser John Poindexter short-
ly after the news broke. 
The Shultz/Poindexter Cables 
The Secretary of State was largely without knowl-
edge concerning the Iran initiative. Among other 
things, Secretary Shultz testified that he did not know 
prior to November 1986 that the United States had 
made direct sales of arms to Iran during 1986 or that 
the President had signed a Finding authorizing such 
sales. He did know, after the fact, that McFarlane had 
travelled to Tehran in May, but not that the McFar-
lane mission had carried weapons with it, or that 
additional weapons had been delivered thereafter. 
Moreover, so far as the Secretary of State was ad-
vised, the failed McFarlane mission had signaled an 
end to the Administration's effort to find an opening 
to Iran.' 
Thus, the report in Al-Shiraa was news to the Sec-
retary of State. He was then in Europe and found 
himself peppered with questions from the press about 
the revelations in Beirut. The Secretary reported 
these questions in a cable to Poindexter, informing 
Poindexter that "[t]he big story the press is after is to 
establish that the U.S. violated its own policy by 
cutting a big secret arms deal with Iran in order to 
get our hostages released." Secretary Shultz further 
informed Poindexter that, "[i]n accordance with the 
agreed guidance," he had refused to answer any relat-
ed questions, stating that all such inquiries should be 
directed to the White House.2 
The Secretary went on to say that he had been 
"racking my brains all day to figure out a way to help 
turn this situation in the best possible direction." To 
this end, Secretary Shultz recommended that "the 
best way to proceed is to give the key facts to the 
public." In addition, apparently based on the arms 
shipment reported by Al-Shiraa, the Secretary sug-
gested that "[w]e could make clear that this was a 
special, one-time operation based on humanitarian 
grounds and decided by the President within his Con-
stitutional responsibility to act for the service of the 
national interest?and that our policies toward terror-
ism and toward the Iran/Iraq war stand." 3 
Poindexter, who knew the true facts, rejected Sec-
retary Shultz's proposal. In a return cable Poindexter 
stated, "I do not believe that now is the time to give 
the facts to the public," although he asserted that 
"when we do lay out the facts that it will be well 
received since it is a good story." Poindexter advised 
Secretary Shultz that he had spoken that day with the 
Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, and the 
Director Casey, and that they all agreed that no state-
ment should be made.4 
Poindexter further advised Secretary Shultz that he 
had asked the NSC staff to prepare messages to U.S. 
allies explaining that U.S. policy toward the Iran-Iraq 
war had not changed, and that the Administration 
would not comment on the reported arms sales be-
cause of potential danger to the hostages.5 
The Administration did, however, issue a statement 
on November 4, asserting that "as long as Iran advo-
cates the use of terrorism, the United States arms 
embargo will continue." This portion of the White 
House statement had been drafted by Poindexter, and 
implied that the United States had not sold arms to 
Iran!' When the Secretary of State subsequently re-
viewed this statement, he found it "the kind of tricky 
and misleading statement that looks great on the sur-
face, but then you start looking at it more carefully

Chapter 19 
and you see it is going in a different direction entire-
ly." 7 
The Public Denials Continue 
The issue of public comment on the arms sales was 
discussed during Poindexter's morning meetings with 
the President on November 6 and 7. The President 
agreed that "no comment" was the best policy given 
his hope, bolstered by Poindexter, that additional hos-
tages would yet be freed. According to notes of the 
briefings taken by Rodney McDaniel of the NSC 
staff, the President said that "[n]o way can comment 
without further damage to chances of getting hostages 
out." 8 
Accordingly, on November 6, at an unrelated bill-
signing ceremony, the President stated in response to 
a reporter's question that, "the speculation, the com-
menting and all, on [the Al-Shiraa] story" had "no 
foundation," although his comments fell short of an 
outright repudiation of that story. The President fur-
ther stated that the speculation about arms transac-
tions between the United States and Iran "is making it 
more difficult for us to get our other hostages free." 9 
On November 7, McFarlane sent a PROF note to 
Poindexter complaining that he had heard that Chief 
of Staff Regan had spoken with the press and "laid 
the entire problem at [McFarlane's] feet." In reply, 
Poindexter told McFarlane that he had spoken to 
Regan that morning, and that Regan "agreed that he 
would keep his mouth shut." Poindexter concluded 
that "[w]e have a damned good story to tell when we 
are ready. Right now would be an absolutely stupid 
time for the Administration to say anything." 10 
The November 10 Meeting at the 
White House 
Notwithstanding Poindexter's analysis, it soon became 
clear that the Administration's preference for total 
silence could not be sustained. Pressure was mounting 
in the public, the press, and in the Government itself 
for an explanation of what had happened. The Presi-
dent would have to make a statement. 
On November 10, the President convened a meet-
ing at the White House to establish guidelines for that 
statement. The Vice President, Secretary Shultz, Sec-
retary Weinberger, Attorney General Meese, Casey, 
Regan, Poindexter and Alton Keel, then Deputy Na-
tional Security Adviser attended." The President 
said there was a need for a public statement, but he 
instructed his advisers to "stay away from detail." 12 
*N 7501, PROF from McFarlane to Poindexter, 11/7/86, 
20:30:32. After voicing this complaint, McFarlane's note went on to 
set forth the so-called "truth" about the Iran initiative. But McFar-
lane made no mention of the November 1985 HAWK shipment. 
See Section, "The NSC Staff's Chronologies," infra. 
294 
Keel and Regan made notes during the November 
10 meeting; Secretary Weinberger wrote a subsequent 
memorandum; and Secretary Shultz dictated his recol-
lections of the meeting to his Executive Assistant, 
Charles Hill. These records contain no material differ-
ences. They all show that the meeting was marked by 
a number of misleading statements and significant 
omissions by Poindexter as he purported to lay out 
the facts of the Iran initiative. 
For example: 
? Poindexter discussed only the January 17, 
1986, Finding, omitting any mention of the earlier 
Finding signed by the President on December 5, 
1985, or of the January 6, 1986, superseded Find-
ing. 
? Poindexter claimed, falsely, that the Iran initia-
tive had begun when the United States stumbled 
upon an Israeli arms warehouse in Europe while 
attempting to learn whether the Israelis were 
shipping arms to Iran.* 
? Poindexter asserted that the first 500 TOW 
missiles were shipped from Israel to Iran in 
August and September 1985, without U.S. per-
mission, even though the Administration had ap-
proved this shipment.** 
? Poindexter stated that the total number of 
TOW missiles sold to Iran during the initiative 
was 1,000, when the actual number was 2,004. 
? Poindexter indicated that the last 500 TOWs 
sent in October 1986, had been shipped by Israel 
rather than the United States. But in fact, Israel 
had acted at the NSC staff's request because the 
U.S. shipment was delayed, and the United States 
had replenished the Israeli TOWs within days 
after the shipment." 
In other words, as late as November 10, and in the 
presence of the President and senior Cabinet officers, 
Poindexter either was confused or purposely dissem-
bled. Despite the fact that the President had opened 
the meeting by declaring the need for a public state-
*Oakley Aff., 7/2/87; Ex. GPS-55. This same story had been told 
by North to Ambassador Oakley in November 1985 when North 
enlisted Oakley's aid in causing a U.S. Embassy in Europe to 
intercede with its host government to provide flight clearance for 
the HAWK shipment. It was repeated by North in a memorandum 
dated December 5, 1985, prior to the December 7 meeting of the 
President's top advisers. However, according to the evidence, the 
Iran initiative actually began and went forward through the efforts 
of McFarlane conducted to a considerable extent without informing 
the Secretary of State. When the Secretary of State heard the 
warehouse story at the November 10, 1986 meeting, he considered 
it "cock and bull." Shultz Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/23/87, at 30. 
**McFarlane testified that the President approved the August-
September 1985 shipments. McFarlane Test., Hearings, 100-2, 5/11/ 
87, at 49. Based on all of the evidence, the Committees believe that 
the President did so.

Chapter 19 
ment, Poindexter continued to argue that "no state-
ment [is] needed, news has peaked, no hearings until 
Jan[uary], so [we] should not say anything." 14 
As the group continued to discuss the proposed 
public response, Secretary Weinberger noted his sur-
prise that more than 500 TOW missiles had been 
shipped. He said he had understood that no more than 
500 TOWs would be sent unless all the hostages were 
released. Poindexter responded that it "just always 
came back to Pres[ident], he agreed to go for-
ward." 18 In this connection, Secretary Shultz ex-
pressed his amazement that he was not informed of 
the January Finding until November." When Poin-
dexter told the group that the weapons shipped were 
in "minuscule" amounts, Secretary Shultz responded 
that "[i]t is ransom . . . [we] must not gild lily," and 
that he was "afraid of technically correct statements 
that are not fully descriptive." 17 
The meeting concluded as it began, when, accord-
ing to Regan's notes, the President had outlined the 
type of statement he wanted: 
We have not dealt directly w[ith] terrorists, no 
bargaining, no ransom. Some things we can't dis-
cuss because of long-term consideration of people 
w[ith] whom we have been talking about the 
future of Iran.18 
The President, Attorney General Meese and Casey 
all agreed that the statement would emphasize the 
strategic component of the arms sales and downplay 
efforts to release the hostages." 
Later that afternoon, Poindexter and Meese re-
viewed a draft White House statement prepared by 
Casey.* This draft asserted that U.S. policy "has been 
and continues to be to restrain shipments of arms to 
either [Iran or Iraq] that could alter the balance or 
prolong the war . . . [and] not to reward hostage 
takers by meeting their demands." 20 Regan's notes of 
the review session indicate that certain information in 
the proposed statement was eliminated by unnamed 
NSC staffers due to ongoing conversations with the 
Iranians in Geneva, leading to the "possible release of 
2 [hostages], maybe all 5." The notes further reflect 
that Poindexter obtained "sign offs" on the statement 
from Secretary Weinberger, Attorney General Meese, 
Casey, and the President. He was unable to contact 
Secretary Shultz, who was en route to South Amer-
ica.21 
Secretary Shultz received the draft statement 
during his trip and advised Poindexter that he object-
ed to the portion that asserted there had been "unani-
mous support for the President's decisions." 22 By 
cable, Secretary Shultz told Poindexter that this char-
N 8995-96. Prior to this meeting, Poindexter and Casey ex-
changed drafts of a proposed Presidential statement. Casey de-
scribed Poindexter's draft as doing "little more than say we re-
viewed the matter and discovered that we didn't break the law," 
stating that his own draft "says a little more." 
acterization was simply inaccurate; he had always 
supported the President, but he had opposed the 
policy. At Secretary Shultz's insistence, Poindexter 
changed the statement to read that there had been 
"unanimous support for the President" among his 
senior advisers." Secretary Shultz was not "altogeth-
er comfortable" with this change, although he agreed 
to the statement as revised.24 
Phase 2 of the Administration 
Response: Limited Disclosure 
Preparing for the President's Address to 
the Nation 
After November 10, the White House began prepar-
ing a formal statement for the President to deliver 
personally to the Nation. This statement was dis-
cussed at the daily national security briefing between 
Poindexter and the President, both of whom ex-
pressed continued hope that more hostages would be 
released that coming weekend. They agreed that the 
President's upcoming statement would focus on the 
legality of the arms initiative and emphasize that the 
arms sales did not constitute ransom.25 
On the same day, McFarlane sent a PROF message 
to Poindexter in which he stated that "the only 
way?the only way?the Administration can expect 
to come out of this with any element of credibility is 
for there to be some evidence that it was worth it to 
try to engage moderates in Iran." This required, ac-
cording to McFarlane, a statement from Iran. He rec-
ommended that the United States concentrate all ef-
forts on convincing the Iranians to change their rhet-
oric immediately. McFarlane told Poindexter that he 
had "drafted up some words and left them with 011ie 
to be sent to Iran." 26 
McFarlane also produced and sent to Poindexter a 
draft statement for the President, focusing on the 
effort to open a political dialogue with Iranian moder-
ates.27 Poindexter wrote back that he had reviewed 
the draft with North and that they had agreed there 
was a need to show the final product to George Cave 
of the CIA in order to "get an 'Iranian reaction' on 
it." 28 
On November 12, the day before the President was 
to address the Nation, he presided over a national 
security briefing of Congressional leaders on the arms 
sales. The executive branch attendees included the 
Vice President, Secretary Shultz, Secretary Wein-
berger, Attorney General Meese, Casey, Regan, Poin-
dexter, and appropriate staff. Senate Leaders Robert 
Dole and Robert Byrd and House Majority Leader 
Jim Wright and Representative Dick Cheney repre-
sented Congress. The President opened the meeting 
by stating that no laws were broken, no ransom paid 
for hostages, and no officials or agencies within the 
U.S. Government bypassed."

Chapter 19 
Poindexter conducted the briefing itself. Once 
more, he omitted certain material facts and was af-
firmatively misleading on others. Poindexter contin-
ued to talk in terms of only one Finding, omitting any 
reference to the other two signed by the President. 
He continued to discuss the transfer of only 1,000 
TOWs and 240 HAWKs parts, omitting any reference 
to the additional 1,004 TOWs or the November 1985 
HAWK shipment. Moreover, Poindexter continued to 
intimate that the 1985 Israeli arms shipments to Iran 
had been without U.S. authorization or prior knowl-
edge.30 
At the morning security briefing the next day, No-
vember 13, there was discussion of the elements of 
the President's upcoming statement, including that the 
arms shipments had not altered the balance in the 
Iran-Iraq war; that the arms sold were defensive in 
nature; and that there would be no additional ship-
ments. There was discussion, too, of whether the total 
arms shipped to Iran would have fit in one 747 or C-5 
cargo plane. The President also stated, according to 
notes of the meeting, that the Administration "should 
have gone public sooner." 31 
Poindexter briefed reporters "on background" (not 
for attribution) the same day, November 13. Although 
Poindexter initially told the reporters that any ship-
ments made prior to January 1986 were undertaken 
without any U.S. role "either condoning, winking, 
encouraging, or anything of that nature," he acknowl-
edged later in the briefing that "there was one ship-
ment that was made not by us, but by a third country 
prior to the signing of [the January 17 Finding]." 
Poindexter did not confirm that the shipment was 
made by Israel, but did state that the shipment was 
made in "our interests." When asked about the exist-
ence of relevant Presidential Findings, Poindexter did 
not mention the Finding signed by the President in 
December 1985, but instead told reporters that the 
President "signed a document that has authorized this 
project" in January 1986.32 
The President Addresses the Nation 
The President addressed the Nation on November 
13. He disclosed that the diplomatic initiative with 
Iran had been underway for some 18 months. The 
purposes of this initiative, he said, were (1) to forge a 
new relationship with Iran, (2) to bring an honorable 
end to the Iran-Iraq war, (3) to eliminate state-spon-
sored terrorism, and (4) as part of the new relation-
ship, to attain the safe return of the American hos-
tages held in Lebanon.33 
The President stated that he had authorized "the 
transfer of small amounts of defensive weapons and 
spare parts. . . . These modest deliveries, taken togeth-
er, could easily fit into a single cargo plane." He 
elaborated that the weapons shipped "could not, taken 
together, affect the outcome of the 6-year war be-
tween Iran and Iraq nor could they affect in any way 
296 
the military balance between the two countries." He 
asserted that since the initiative had commenced, 
there had been no evidence of Iranian complicity in 
acts of terrorism against the United States. The Presi-
dent also emphasized that the arms initiative was con-
ducted in full compliance with the law, and that all 
appropriate Cabinet officers "were fully consulted." 
He attacked "the wildly speculative false stories about 
arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments." The 
President concluded by stating that "[w]e did not?
repeat?did not trade weapons or anything else for 
hostages nor will we." 34 
The President thus committed himself categorically 
to the proposition that there had been no trade of 
arms for the hostages and no violations of law. Cer-
tain members of the NSC staff and of the CIA, in 
turn, committed themselves to creating a version of 
the facts for internal and public consumption that 
would sustain this proposition. 
Events Between November 13 and 
the November 19 News 
Conference 
The Secretary of State testified that, throughout the 
first weeks of November after the Beirut report, he 
believed that the President was being misled and mis-
informed by his staff, particularly Poindexter. Secre-
tary Shultz said he repeatedly argued to the President 
and Poindexter that nobody looking at the record 
would credit the assertion that the initiative did not 
involve arms-for-hostages, and that it was critical 
there be no tinkering with the facts. It was, the Secre-
tary said, a "battle royal" to get out the truth." 
Secretary Shultz also pressed for a definitive state-
ment that the United States would not under any 
circumstances sell any more arms to Iran. He met 
with the President on November 14 to urge that he 
make precisely that statement, and he repeated this 
recommendation in a draft paper delivered to Regan 
on November 15.36 But the statement was not made, 
nor was Secretary Shultz assured that the arms ship-
ments would be halted. Consequently, when Secre-
tary Shultz appeared on Face The Nation on Novem-
ber 16 and expressed the view that the United States 
should not sell additional weapons to Iran, he felt 
constrained to answer in response to a question that 
he, the Secretary of State, did not have authority to 
speak for the Administration on this point." 
The next day the White House stated definitively 
that there would be no further arms sales to Iran. The 
White House also reaffirmed that the Secretary of 
State spoke for the Administration on matters of for-
eign policy.38 
Meanwhile, at the Attorney General's request, 
Charles J. Cooper, Assistant Attorney General for the 
Office of Legal Counsel, had been looking into the

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 19 
legal issues surrounding the Iranian arms sales.* On 
November 12, 1986, Cooper sent a legal memorandum 
to the Attorney General that concluded, among other 
things, that so long as there was a Finding pursuant to 
the Hughes-Ryan Amendment, the arms sales did not 
violate the law.39 In a meeting with Poindexter and 
Thompson that same day, Cooper had been shown 
only the January 17 Finding and had been left with 
the impression that this Finding predated any arms 
shipments to Iran.4? 
On November 17, Cooper received a draft chronol-
ogy of events in the Iran initiative prepared by the 
NSC staff. In reviewing this chronology, Cooper 
learned for the first time that arms had been trans-
ferred by Israel to Iran prior to the January 17, 1986, 
Finding.4' Cooper informed the Attorney General, 
who said that he, too, had been unaware of any arms 
shipped to Iran prior to the January Finding.42 
On the following day, November 18, North re-
ceived calls from Alton Keel, Deputy National Secu-
rity Adviser, Poindexter, and Richard Armitage, As-
sistant Secretary of Defense, all concerning the legal 
problems raised by the pre-Finding arms shipments to 
Iran. 
In the morning on November 18, an executive 
branch general counsels' meeting was held in the 
office of White House Counsel Peter Wallison. This 
meeting was attended by NSC general counsel 
Thompson, Cooper, CIA general counsel David Do-
herty, and State Department Legal Adviser Abraham 
Sofaer. Sofaer and Wallison expressed concern at the 
meeting when Thompson refused to provide them 
with all of the facts surrounding the Iran arms sales. 
Sofaer pressed on this point, and Thompson replied 
that he was acting on instructions from Poindexter. 
He said that the Congressional leaders would be given 
all the information they needed to know, but that 
there was no need for the President's counsel or the 
State Department's Legal Adviser to know any more 
than Thompson was saying.'" 
Thompson asserted that, from a political standpoint, 
matters "seemed calm and the [Congressional Intelli-
gence] Committees seem to be accepting the position 
of the White House." Sofaer did not accept this expla-
nation and told Wallison that Thompson's refusal to 
give them a full briefing was "extremely serious." 
Wallison agreed and stayed behind at the end of the 
meeting to talk with Thompson. Later that day, 
Sofaer was notified that Poindexter would brief him 
and Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost at 
6:00 p.m.44 
At the 6:00 p.m. briefing, Poindexter laid out more 
of the facts to Sofaer and Armacost than Thompson 
''Cooper Test., Hearings, 100-6, 6/25/87, at 227. Cooper had 
received this assignment from the Attorney General on November 
7, and had been advised at the same time that his NSC point of 
contact would be Paul Thompson, the NSC's general counsel. 
Meese Dep., 7/8/87, at 53-54. 
had disclosed earlier in the day?but still not all of 
the facts. For example, Poindexter made no reference 
to the pre-January 17 Findings or to the November 
1985 HAWK shipment. Sofaer left the meeting highly 
concerned that he still did not have the whole 
story.45 
During the same day, November 18, Poindexter 
and Casey spoke by secure telephone. A transcript of 
their conversation indicates that they discussed meet-
ing to prepare for their Congressional briefings and 
for Casey's scheduled November 21 testimony on 
Capitol Hill. Poindexter told Casey that the NSC staff 
had been "putting together all the chronologies and 
all the facts that we can lay our hands on . . . 46 
With respect to the proposed preparation meeting, 
Casey asked whether Poindexter intended to have 
many people present, specifically mentioning "State" 
and "Defense." Poindexter responded, "I'd like to 
spend some time just the two of us. . . . Ed Meese 
indicated . . . he should want to be helpful and so he 
would like to be in at least one of the meetings." 47 
Meanwhile, at North's request, McFarlane re-
viewed the draft opening statement to be used by the 
President at the news conference scheduled for the 
next evening. According to McFarlane, the statement 
seemed "to be incomplete in a number of respects," 
and McFarlane sent suggested changes to Poindexter 
by PROFs computer. In the proposed changes, 
McFarlane denied United States approval of any pre-
Finding shipments.48 
Later the same day, November 19, McFarlane 
stopped at Poindexter's office to pick up a copy of 
the President's opening statement for the press confer-
ence. With at least NSC staffer Howard Teicher and 
North present (Keel and Poindexter may also have 
been there), McFarlane told North that a problem 
remains over "the channeling of money to the Con-
tras." There is no evidence that anyone overheard 
McFarlane's statement to North.49 
The President's November 19 
News Conference 
On November 19, the President vouched for facts 
that were wrong. In his nationally televised news 
conference, the President made the following asser-
tions?all of which were incorrect: 
? The President denied any involvement by a 
third country in the arms sales. When asked if he 
could explain the Israeli role, he replied, "No, 
because we, as I say, have had nothing to do 
with other countries or their shipment of arms or 
doing what they're doing." 
? When asked whether he was saying that "the 
only shipments with which we were involved 
were the one or two that followed your January

17 Finding and that . . . there were no other 
shipments which the United States condoned," 
the President responded, "That's right. I'm 
saying nothing, but the missiles we sold . . . ." 
? The President asserted that 1,000 TOW mis-
siles were transferred (in fact, 2,004 were trans-
ferred), and that the 1,000 transferred TOWs 
"didn't add to any offensive power on the part of 
Iran." 
? The President stated that "everything that we 
sold [Iran] could be put in one cargo plane, and 
there would be plenty of room left over." 
In addition, the President repeated his assertion that 
the United States had not traded arms for hostages, 
relying on the distinction that the Iranian Govern-
ment itself did not hold the hostages. 
Although the President denied any third-country 
involvement in the sales and said he could not explain 
the role of Israel, the Israeli role had been discussed 
prominently in the cover memorandum on the basis of 
which the President signed the January 17, 1986, 
Finding permitting the sales to go forward. Further, 
while the President also stated at his news conference 
that the United States had not been involved with or 
condoned any shipments prior to the January 1986 
Finding, he told the Secretary of State that day that 
he had known of the November 1985 shipment of 
HAWK missiles to Iran by Israel.* 
After the press conference, Charles Cooper tele-
phoned Paul Thompson to initiate a correction of the 
President's obvious misstatement that no third coun-
try had been involved in the arms sales. Thompson 
assured Cooper that the NSC staff was already aware 
of this error and was planning to correct it." A 
correction was issued from the White House 20 min-
utes later. Even this correction, however, left the 
record inaccurate. The correction conceded that a 
third country had been involved, but did not state 
that the United States had been involved in the sales 
by that country prior to the January 17, 1986, Find-
ing.6 
Commenting on the numerous errors at the press 
conference, Regan testified that Poindexter and his 
staff had spun so many stories in preparing the Presi-
dent that "this sort of confused the Presidential mind 
as to what he could say and couldn't say and what he 
should say and shouldn't say." 52 
The Secretary of State, who had watched the press 
conference, sought an immediate meeting with the 
President.63 
*Shultz Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/23/87, at 44; Ex. GPS-C. Ac-
cording to contemporaneous notes made by Shultz's Executive 
Assistant, the President made this statement to Shultz on November 
19, 1986 prior to the press conference. 
298 
The President and Secretary of 
State Meet on November 20 
When he asked the President for a meeting, Secretary 
Shultz said that he could demonstrate that a number 
of facts had been misstated at the press conference." 
In Secretary Shultz's view, the President's skillfulness 
as a communicator was being exploited by the NSC 
staff for its own purposes?to spread inaccurate infor-
mation.65 
The Secretary and the President met on November 
20. Donald Regan was also there. It was, Secretary 
Shultz testified, a "long, tough discussion. Not the 
kind of discussion I ever thought I would have with 
the President of the United States." 56 
According to Secretary Shultz, he reviewed with 
the President the factual errors at the press confer-
ence.* The President "corroborated" the facts con-
cerning his approval of various arms shipments?in-
cluding the November 1985 HAWK shipment." The 
President said, however, that "what he expected to 
have carried out was an effort to get an opening of a 
different kind to Iran and the arms and the hostages 
were ancillary to that, that was not his objective." 58 
Shultz replied, "Well I recognize that, Mr. President, 
and that is a good objective, but that isn't the way it 
worked." 59 
The Secretary also asserted that the President was 
being given wrong information, including "informa-
lion that suggested that Iran was no longer practicing 
terrorism." 60 He testified that his message overall to 
the President was: "You have got to look at these 
facts." 61 
The NSC Staff's Chronologies 
Information was in fact being prepared by the NSC 
staff in the form of "chronologies," documents setting 
forth key events relating to the Iran initiative in 
chronological order. The NSC staff had begun pre-
paring a chronology shortly after the disclosure of the 
Iran arms sales. The chronology started out as a one-
or two-page outline. As time passed, however, the 
chronology was transformed into a 17-page single-
spaced document containing background information 
and rationales for the various events and decisions. 
Although a number of persons worked on the NSC 
staff chronologies, not all participated in falsifying the 
facts. That was the province of North, McFarlane, 
and Poindexter. North testified that the three had 
purposefully misrepresented significant events in the 
chronologies.62 
*Shultz Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/23/87, at 44. A paper prepared 
for Shultz's meeting with the President detailed the facts that were 
at odds with public statements from the White House. Ex. GPS-45;

Chapter 19 
Poindexter acknowledged only that he had instruct-
ed North to omit any reference to the diversion.63 
Otherwise, both Poindexter and McFarlane claimed 
that they tried to paint a true picture in the chronolo-
gies, and that any failures were the result of faulty 
memory or, in the case of McFarlane, an effort to 
"gild" the facts.64 The record refutes this claim?for 
the "errors" in the chronologies were not simply in-
correct dates or imperfect renditions of meetings, but 
wholesale distortions of key events. Moreover, it was 
McFarlane himself who supplied narratives containing 
the most extreme misrepresentations, with Poin-
dexter's approval and North's assistance. 
The most glaring misrepresentations concerned the 
Israeli shipments made before the President's January 
1986, Finding?the August-September 1985 shipments 
of 504 TOW missiles and the November 1985, ship-
ment of 18 HAWK missiles from Israel to Iran. The 
initial versions of the chronology, prepared by North 
on November 7 included fairly accurate references to 
those shipments." McFarlane then sent a PROF mes-
sage to Poindexter on November 7 suggesting that 
"[i]t might be useful to review what the truth is." But 
McFarlane's version was not the "truth": 
? He asserted that the August-September TOW 
shipments occurred when the Israelis "went 
ahead on their own" after McFarlane had disap-
proved; and 
? He made no mention at all of the November 
1985 HAWK shipment. 66 
McFarlane's "truth" set the stage for what was to 
come. Subsequent versions of the chronology, on No-
vember 12 and 13, picked up the theme of "no prior 
U.S. approval" of the 1985 Israeli shipments and 
claimed that the United States "acquiesced" in Israel's 
TOW shipment only after the release of hostage Ben-
jamin Weir on September 14, 1985. No reference was 
made to any Presidential approval of those shipments 
or to any of the prior discussions between Israel and 
the United States from June through September; nor 
was there any reference to the November 1985 
HAWK shipment.67 
In the November 17, 5:00 p.m. edition of the chro-
nology, the authors declared falsely that the United 
States was "not aware of the [August-September 
TOW] shipment at the time it was made." 68 Howev-
er, this version of the chronology did contain an 
accurate reference to the November 1985 HAWK 
shipment, except that it was silent on the question of 
U.S. knowledge and approval.68 
Then, three separate discussions occurred on No-
vember 18, between North and Keel, Poindexter, and 
Armitage, concerning the legality of the 1985 sales.7? 
At 10:30 a.m., Keel and North reviewed the questions 
the President might be asked at the press conference 
on November 19. Two of the questions were, "Did 
Israeli shipments on our behalf violate the law?" and, 
"Did this violate the Arms Export Control Act?" At 
5:30 p.m., North spoke to Poindexter, who referred to 
the pre-Finding period and told North that the "big 
issue then was legality." Then, at 6:00 p.m., Armitage 
called and told North that lawyers were asking him 
about the Israeli shipments in 1985 and wanted to 
know whether the United States knew about them.71 
Following these conversations, another version of 
the chronology was drafted at 7:30 p.m. on Novem-
ber 18. It denied prior U.S. knowledge of the August-
September 1985 TOW shipments and expressly stated 
that the November 1985 HAWK shipment was not an 
"authorized" exception to U.S. policy. It also con-
tained an augmented misrepresentation of the TOW 
shipments. It stated that: 
? When informed by Israeli official David 
Kimche of a possible transfer of TOWs, the 
United States, via McFarlane, refused to acqui-
esce in the transfer or to guarantee replacement 
of the TOWS. 
? When the United States learned after the fact 
of the TOW transfers, a decision was made not 
"to expose this Israeli shipment," so that the 
United States could exploit the Israeli channel to 
Iran to further its own strategic initiative." 
Later in the evening on November 18, McFarlane 
sent Poindexter a lengthy PROF message suggesting 
deletions to the November 17 draft chronology and 
an insert relating principally to the 1985 shipments. 
He recommended that the chronology add that, after 
authorizing a "dialogue" with Iran in July 1985, the 
President rejected two separate Israeli proposals for 
arms transfers (one for a direct sale, the other for 
shipment by Israel), and, further, that "[w]e subse-
quently learned in late August the Israelis had trans-
ferred 508 TOW missiles to Iran." 73 North incorpo-
rated McFarlane's insert virtually verbatim in the next 
versions of the chronology, prepared on November 
19 at 11:00 a.m. and November 20 at 1:00 p.m. and 
8:00 p.m.74 
The final two editions included two additional mis-
statements contributed by North: (1) that the Israelis 
"told us that they undertook the action, despite our 
objections, because they believed it to be in their 
strategic interests," and (2) that "[a]fter discussing this 
matter with the President, it was decided not to 
expose this Israeli delivery . . . 
As noted, the November 1985 HAWK shipment 
first appeared in a straightforward way in North's 
initial November 7 chronology." It next appeared in 
the November 17, 3:00 p.m. version of the chronolo-
gy, where it was presented as an Israeli shipment of 
*The "decision not to expose" fabrication first appeared, as dis-
cussed earlier, in the Nov. 18, 7:30 p.m. version of the chronology. 
It dropped out of the Nov. 19, 11:00 a.m, edition, and reappeared in 
the Nov. 20 versions with a reference to the President.

18 HAWKs which resulted from "urgent entreaties 
from the Iranians" and "raised U.S. concerns that we 
could well be creating misunderstandings in 
Tehran." 76 The 5:00 p.m. edition on November 17 
kept the same description but added that "[t]hese mis-
siles were subsequently returned to Israel in February 
1986, with U.S. assistance."* On November 18, the 
chronology recited that the return of the HAWKs 
was "by mutual agreement of all three parties." 77 
However, following the three conversations North 
had on November 18 with Alton Keel, Poindexter, 
and Richard Armitage regarding the legality of the 
1985 shipments, the story began to change. On No-
vember 18, the chronology asserted that the HAWK 
shipment was "not an authorized exception to [U.S.] 
policy," and was retrieved "as a consequence of U.S. 
intervention." 78 North conceded in his testimony 
that these changes in the chronology were an attempt 
to _deal with the Arms Export Control Act problems 
that had been brought to his attention in his earlier 
conversations.79 
After McFarlane's lengthy PROF message of No-
vember 18,80 the HAWK shipment reference disap-
peared from the chronology and was replaced in its 
entirety with the precise language recommended by 
McFarlane?which made no reference to arms at all: 
Later in the fall, other transfers of equipment 
were made between Israel and Iran although 
some of the items were returned to Israel.8' 
The November 19, 11:00 a.m. edition of the chronolo-
gy added that, in a December 1985 meeting with an 
Israeli official, McFarlane "made clear our strong ob-
jection to the Israelis shipment of HAWK mis-
siles." 82 
On November 20, North and others turned to the 
proposed testimony that Casey was to give Congres-
sional Intelligence Committees the next day. They 
faced the problem that a CIA proprietary airline had 
actually carried the HAWK missiles to Iran in No-
vember 1985, but the President had denied U.S. in-
volvement in that weapons shipment at his press con-
ference the day before. Certain members of the NSC 
staff developed what Regan later termed a "cover 
story:" that the U.S. Government had been told by 
the Israelis that the November 1985 shipment carried 
by the proprietary was "oil drilling equipment," not 
arms. 
The "oil drilling equipment" cover story first ap-
peared in the chronology on November 20 at 1:00 
p.m., shortly before North, Poindexter, Casey, and 
others met to discuss Casey's testimony. It contained 
the following misstatements: 
'N 9368. These statements were true as far as they went; but the 
chronology remained silent on whether the United States had ap-
proved the shipment. 
300 
? In mid-November 1985, the Israelis said they 
were nearing a breakthrough and asked a U.S. 
official for an airline that could discreetly deliver 
passengers and "cargo" to Iran. 
? Since the United States "had expressed so 
much displeasure over the earlier TOW ship-
ment," the Israelis assured the U.S. Government 
that the cargo was "oil drilling parts." Only then 
did the U.S. pass the name of a "proprietary" 
airline to haul the shipment. 
? Not until January 1986 did the United States 
learn that "the Israelis, responding to urgent en-
treaties from the Iranians, had used the proprie-
tary aircraft to transport 18 HAWK missiles to 
Iran." 
? The U.S. Government's "belated awareness" 
of this shipment "raised serious concerns that 
these deliveries were jeopardizing our objective 
of arranging a direct meeting with high-level Ira-
nian officials." So Poindexter "noted our strin-
gent objections to the HAWK missile shipment" 
to the Israelis and indicated that the United 
States would have to act to have them returned, 
as was done in February.83 
Following the November 20 meeting to prepare 
Casey's testimony, and the subsequent objections to 
the proposed Casey testimony raised by the State 
Department, the cover story was amended?in what 
is believed to be the last version of the chronology?
to delete all references to oil drilling equipment. The 
U.S. authorization of the November 1985 shipment, 
however, was still denied.84 
The fictional accounts in the chronologies were not 
limited to the 1985 shipments. For example, the chro-
nologies omitted the President's December 1985 Find-
ing (which retroactively "authorized" the November 
shipment that the United States had supposedly ob-
jected to); affirmatively misrepresented that there had 
been consultation with "all appropriate" or "relevant" 
Cabinet officers during the initiative; and baldly as-
serted that all arms sales were "within the limits of 
established policy and in compliance with all U.S. 
law." 
All of this was not the result of any memory lapse. 
The consequences of this exercise in falsifying the 
facts were severe. As North testified, by creating an 
erroneous version of the facts in the chronologies, 
those responsible were "committing the President of 
the United States to a false story."88 
On November 20 and 21, Poindexter and Casey 
would take further steps in the same direction.

Casey and Poindexter Prepare for 
Congress 
On November 21, Casey was scheduled to testify 
before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, 
and Poindexter was to brief delegatons of the same 
Committees. On November 20, a meeting was held in 
Poindexter's office to review a CIA draft of Casey's 
proposed testimony and coordinate it with Poin-
dexter's upcoming briefing. In attendance were Casey, 
Attorney General Meese, Poindexter, North, Cooper, 
Thompson, and Robert Gates of the CIA.86 The CIA 
brought a proposed insert dealing with the November 
1985 HAWK shipment. It said that the CIA had been 
told the shipment was oil drilling equipment.87 
During discussion of the insert, North suggested 
changing it to say that "no one in the U.S. Govern-
ment" knew at the time that the November 1985 
shipment contained arms. According to Cooper, 
North also stated at the meeting that the United 
States had to force Iran to return the 18 HAWKs that 
Israel had delivered in November, after learning a 
few months after-the-fact that arms had been 
shipped.88 Both Meese and North made handwritten 
notes of North's points on the draft insert." North's 
version was accepted. 
The meeting lasted approximately 2 hours. Attor-
ney General Meese had to leave early to make a 
speech that evening at West Point. After the meeting 
ended, Cooper was asked to come to White House 
Counsel Wallison's office. He went there with NSC 
general counsel Thompson. Wallison, Counsel to the 
President, strenuously objected to not having been 
included in the just-concluded meeting." 
During this session in Wallison's office, State De-
partment Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer telephoned 
Wallison, and indicated that there was a problem with 
Casey's proposed testimony. At Cooper's suggestion, 
Wallison returned Sofaer's call on a secure line. 
Sofaer advised Wallison that Secretary Shultz recalled 
a conversation with McFarlane in November 1985, in 
which McFarlane made specific reference to the ship-
ment of HAWK missiles from Israel to Iran. Sofaer 
testified that he had also spoken with Deputy Attor-
ney General Arnold Burns earlier in the day to ap-
prise him of the discrepancy between Casey's draft 
testimony and Secretary Shultz's recollection. Burns 
told Sofaer that Attorney General Meese had been 
advised of this problem, and was aware of facts that 
would explain everything.* 
Wallison advised Cooper and Thompson of Sofaer's 
report. Cooper then asked Thompson to contact 
North and McFarlane to get the facts straight. 
Cooper reminded Thompson of North's statement at 
Sofaer Dep. at 38-41. Burns barely recalls the conversation, and 
Attorney General Meese has no recollection of talking to Burns 
about Sofaer's call. Meese Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/28/87, at 221; 
Meese Dep., 7/8/87, at 70; Burns Int., 7/7/87. 
the meeting earlier in the day that no one in the U.S. 
Government knew that the November 1985 shipment 
contained arms. Thompson agreed to contact North 
and McFarlane.8' 
Cooper then returned to his office, spoke by tele-
phone to Sofaer, and asked if Secretary Shultz was 
certain of his November 1985 conversation with 
McFarlane. Sofaer replied that the State Department 
had a contemporaneous note written by Secretary 
Shultz's Executive Assistant, Charles Hill, of a con-
versation between McFarlane and Shultz on Novem-
ber 18, 1985, which contained the word "HAWKS." 
Sofaer told Cooper that if Casey's testimony were 
given in its current form, "he [Sofaer] would leave 
the Government," to which Cooper replied, "We may 
all have to." 92 
Cooper then telephoned Thompson, who said that 
North and McFarlane each stuck by his earlier story, 
that they had no contemporaneous knowledge that 
arms were shipped to Iran in November 1985. Cooper 
did not know who was right or wrong. Moreover, 
Sofaer told Cooper that if Casey testified that no one 
in the U.S. Government knew of the weapons ship-
ment, Undersecretary Armacost would have to testify 
otherwise, 3 
Cooper then placed a secure call to? Attorney Gen-
eral Meese at West Point, and the two agreed that the 
problem language should be deleted from Casey's 
proposed testimony. Attorney General Meese agreed 
also with Cooper's suggestion that he return immedi-
ately to Washington and take responsibility for "get-
ting his arms around this. . . ." 94 
Cooper next spoke directly to Poindexter (who al-
ready had heard from Thompson), and Poindexter 
agreed that they would have to refrain from making 
the incorrect statement. Poindexter said he had at-
tempted to discuss the issue with Casey, but that 
Casey was half-asleep when Poindexter called." Ac-
cordingly, Cooper called CIA General Counsel David 
Doherty to advise him that the problem statement 
should be deleted. Doherty told Cooper that he al-
ready had changed Casey's testimony in that 
regard.86 
In his public testimony, North conceded that the oil 
drilling equipment cover story agreed to at the meet-
ing on November 20, 1986, was false. He played 
down his role in preparing Casey's testimony, howev-
er, and claimed that he acted promptly in a later 
private meeting with Casey to correct it. He testified 
that he corrected the proposed testimony even though 
"there are a lot of heroes walking around that have 
claimed credit" for causing the correction." 
Cooper's testimony conflicts with North's. Accord-
ing to Cooper, it was North who pushed strongly for 
the oil drilling equipment cover story and the claim 
that "no one in the U.S. Government" knew that 
missiles rather than oil drilling equipment were being 
shipped in November 1985. A one-page draft insert in

Chapter 19 
North's handwriting corroborates Cooper's testimo-
ny." So does the fact that the oil drilling equipment 
cover story was inserted into the NSC staffs chronol-
ogy by North at 1:00 p.m. on November 20 shortly 
before the meeting with Casey." Moreover, what-
ever efforts North made later to "correct" Casey's 
testimony, Casey told the oil drilling cover story to 
both Congressional Intelligence Committees the next 
day, modified so as to make it literally true but com-
pletely misleading. 
The record makes clear that North, Poindexter, 
Casey, and others were engaged in a deliberate at-
tempt to falsify the facts concerning the November 
1985 HAWKs shipment. This point was illustrated in 
Donald Regan's testimony to the Committees. Regan 
testified that, although he was Chief of Staff, he was 
never consulted about the President's knowledge of 
the November 1985 shipment during the frantic effort 
to prepare a statement for Casey's testimony and 
Poindexter's Congressional briefing on what the U.S. 
Government knew.'" When asked at the hearing 
about the assertion that the U.S. Government believed 
that the November shipment contained oil drilling 
equipment?Regan dubbed that claim, "the cover 
story." 10' 
Poindexter, Casey, and the 
Intelligence Committees: 
November 21 
November 21 was the day that Casey and Poindexter 
appeared before the Intelligence Committees of Con-
gress?the event for which they had attempted to 
coordinate their statements on November 20. Their 
efforts continued on Friday morning, November 21, 
beset by the fact that their plan to present a well-
orchestrated ."cover story" about the November 1985 
HAWK shipment had broken down. 
At approximately 8:00 a.m., Cooper arrived at the 
CIA to ensure that the disputed language regarding 
the November HAWK shipment had been deleted 
from Casey's Congressional testimony. Cooper met 
with Casey. Casey accepted the revisions without 
comment.'" After the meeting, CIA Associate Gen-
eral Counsel Jameson whispered to Cooper that 
during the November 1985 shipment, one of the pilots 
had radioed to the ground that the cargo was weap-
ons.10 3 
Poindexter was the first to brief members of the 
House and Senate Intelligence Committees. He relat-
ed the cover story, not the actual facts. According to 
the memorandums of that meeting, Poindexter main-
tained that: 
? The United States only learned of the August-
September 1985 TOW shipments after the fact, 
whereupon the President expressed both his dis-
pleasure at the arms transfer and his appreciation 
302 
for the subsequent release of hostage Benjamin 
Weir. 
? The United States did not learn until January 
1986 that Israel had transferred 18 HAWK mis-
siles to Iran in November 1985, and the United 
States persuaded the Iranians to return the mis-
siles to Israel in February 1986. 
? He (Poindexter) had learned only the day 
before that there may have been prior U.S. 
knowledge concerning the November 1985 ship-
ment. 
? Finally, Poindexter promised the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee that he would check into the 
facts and report back.104 
Poindexter attempted to explain away his false 
statements by claiming during the hearings that he 
had forgotten all about the November 1985 arms ship-
ment at the time of this Congressional briefing.'" 
But Poindexter had been personally involved in this 
extraordinary shipment of HAWK missiles to Iran. 
North had written PROF notes and memorandums/ 
to Poindexter both before and after the November 
1985 shipment explaining the problems in arranging it 
as well as the reason the Iranians had immediately 
rejected the HAWKs. Moreover, according to his 
testimony, on the first day that Poindexter served as 
National Security Adviser, December 5, 1985, he had 
obtained the President's signature on a Finding specif-
ically designed to authorize, retroactively, and with-
out notification to Congress, the U.S. Government's 
assistance with the November shipment and the at-
tempted hostage trade?a Finding Poindexter de-
stroyed only hours after he promised the Congres-
sional Committees he would check into the facts and 
report back.1? 6 
Casey testified next as part of a panel including 
Undersecretary of State Armacost and Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense Armitage. In his opening statement, 
Casey testified that the CIA was asked in November 
1985 to recommend a proprietary to transport "bulky 
cargo." The crew was told, he said, that the cargo 
consisted of spare parts for the oil drilling fields in 
Tehran. The phrase "no one in the U.S. Government 
found out that our airline had landed HAWK missiles 
into Iran until mid-January" had been deleted from 
his opening statement. But Casey gave no indication 
that the CIA and NSC staff knew that the shipment 
was arms, not oil drilling equipment.'" 
Under questioning by Senate Committee Members, 
Casey, like Poindexter, reverted to the cover story: 
SENATOR LEAHY: . . . On November 25th a 
plane owned by a CIA proprietary . . . delivered 
18 HAWK missiles from Israel to Iran. I dis-
cussed this at some length with Admiral Poin-
dexter this morning. You referred to it here. The

Chapter 19 
Admiral did not have many details on it. I think 
he said that he learned of this only yesterday, this 
shipment by a CIA proprietary of these HAWK 
missiles. Now, did the CIA know what was on 
that aircraft, the November 25th '85 aircraft? 
MR. CASEY: There is some question about that. 
I was told yesterday the CIA didn't know it until 
later on. 
SENATOR LEAHY: Did not know until later 
on? 
MR. CASEY: Did not know until later on. Did 
not know until the Iranians told them some time 
in January by way of complaining about the inad-
equacy of whatever was delivered. 
SENATOR LEAHY: But my concern is that the 
NSC says now that they didn't know what was 
going on and that it just found out that the CIA 
sent that flight over, and they are trying to figure 
out why nobody knew what was on it, and now 
the CIA says well, we did this because the NSC 
requested it, and we didn't know exactly what 
they wanted. Do you understand why somebody 
raised the questions wondering whether there 
was just plausible deniability being set up here. 
MR. CASEY: Hadn't thought about it. I hadn't 
thought about it. 
SENATOR LEAHY: The question I ask, and I 
would hope that the Agency will give me a very 
full, clear, specific answer, is did they know- at 
the time, and if they didn't know at the time, 
why not? 
MR. CASEY: Well, I have inquired into that 
myself, and have been told, and as far as I can 
find out, the Agency did not know what it was 
handling at the time. Now, I am still going to 
inquire further into that." 108 
Before the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence, Casey's testimony concerning the No-
vember HAWK shipment was similarly misleading. 
When asked if the Israelis had made any shipments to 
Iran requiring advance notification or permission, 
Casey referred only to the August-September 1985 
TOW shipments.109 
Casey went out of his way on three occasions 
during his House Committee testimony to say that the 
NSC staff was "guiding and active in the private 
provision of weapons to the Contras." 110

Chapter 20 
November 1986: The Attorney General's 
Inquiry 
The Attorney General's Inquiry Is 
Launched 
When Attorney General Edwin Meese returned to 
Washington on the morning of November 21, he im-
mediately convened his top advisers to discuss the 
Administration's conflicting versions of what had ac-
tually happened in November 1985. Present were 
Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, John Rich-
ardson (the Attorney General's Chief of Staff), Wil-
liam Bradford Reynolds (Assistant Attorney General 
for the Civil Rights Division), and Charles Cooper 
(Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal 
Counsel).' Cooper briefed the group on the discrep-
ancies between the proposed Casey testimony and the 
facts as recalled by others in the Administration. The 
Attorney General decided to propose to the President 
that he be commissioned to gather the facts so that 
the Administration would be speaking with one 
voice. 2 
At 9:22 a.m., the Attorney General called Poin-
dexter on a secure telephone and told him to arrange 
a meeting among themselves, the President, and 
Donald Regan.3 According to Regan, Attorney Gen-
eral Meese met with him before they went to see the 
President on the morning of November 21. Attorney 
General Meese told Regan he was having trouble 
getting the facts in one place, and that a full investiga-
tion should be made.4 
At approximately 11:30 a.m., Attorney General 
Meese, Regan, and Poindexter met with the President. 
According to Attorney General Meese, he told the 
President that the Administration did not have a co-
herent picture of the Iran initiative because the oper-
ation was so heavily compartmentalized. Attorney 
General Meese suggested that he be authorized to 
gather the facts to present an accurate overview for 
the President and the public. The President acceded. 
It was agreed that over the weekend the Attorney 
General would try to gather the facts in time for the 
previously scheduled National Security Planning 
Group (NSPG) meeting on Monday, November 24. 
Attorney General Meese testified that when he em-
77-026 0 - 87 - 11 
barked on this effort he was acting as "legal adviser 
to the President." * 
Meanwhile, at 11:00 a.m., Ledeen and McFarlane 
met at Ledeen's home to discuss the extent of the 
arms sales transactions. McFarlane said he was clear 
on everything except the November 1985 shipment.5 
North appeared at Ledeen's home about 12:30 p.m., 
"in some distress" according to McFarlane.6 Ledeen 
testified that both North and McFarlane referred to 
meetings with the Attorney Genera1.7 McFarlane 
agreed to drive North back downtown. During the 
drive, North told McFarlane that he was concerned 
Ledeen may have made money on the arms transac-
tions, a concern that North denied in his public testi-
mony.8 North also told McFarlane that he was going 
to have a "shredding party that weekend." McFarlane 
testified that he responded, "011ie, look, you have 
acted under instruction at all times and I'm confident 
that you have nothing to worry about. Let it all 
happen and I'll back you up." 9 North denied using 
the term "shredding party," but recalled telling 
McFarlane that all key documents already had been 
destroyed.1? 
Meese arrived back at the Justice Department at 
12:45 p.m. and advised Reynolds, Cooper, and Rich-
ardson that the President had authorized him to "get 
his arms around the Iranian initiative." "** Meese 
then met with FBI Director William Webster on an 
unrelated matter. When Webster brought up the con-
fusion surrounding the Iran arms sales, Attorney Gen-
eral Meese advised that the President had asked him 
to conduct a factual inquiry because different partici-
pants had different pieces of knowledge to be recon-
ciled. Attorney General Meese declined an offer of 
FBI assistance from Webster, stating that he saw 
nothing criminal in the arms sales. Webster agreed 
that absent evidence of a crime, the FBI should not

of "friend" of the President, not Attorney General. North Test.,

role as a "special adviser," Id. 
**The Attorney General instructed Richardson to keep a log of 
all meetings the Attorney General had during this inquiry, includ-
ing the time of the interviews, meetings and those in attendance.

be involved." Attorney General Meese did not relate 
the details surrounding Casey's testimony or the possi-
ble violations of the Arms Export Control Act arising 
from the 1985 shipments." The Attorney General 
also testified that he did not bring in the FBI because 
he and Webster concluded that it would not be "ap-
propriate." 14 
According to North's deputy, Robert Earl, North 
came to his office during the afternoon of November 
21 and told Earl that he had just attended a meeting 
at the White House, and that the Attorney General 
was sending a Justice Department team to the Nation-
al Security Council because the Congressional brief-
ings had raised questions. According to Earl, North 
said he had asked Attorney General Meese, "Can I 
have or will I have 24 or 48 hours" and Meese re-
sponded that he did not know whether North would 
have that much time." The Attorney General re-
called no such conversation with North; North denied 
it; and there is no other evidence that North met with 
the Attorney General that day." Earl testified fur-
ther that North asked for Earl's Iran file, remarking 
that "It's time for North to be a scapegoat." Earl 
stated that, when he gave his file to North, he could 
tell that he would never see it again. Earl was right." 
That afternoon, Attorney General Meese selected 
his factfinding team. He chose two political appoint-
ees and one person from his personal staff. He select-
ed Cooper because he was already looking into the 
matter as head of the Office of Legal Counsel, which 
provides advice to the executive branch on various 
legal matters, including national security. Richardson 
was the Attorney General's Chief of Staff. Reynolds 
was assigned because, in addition to his responsibil-
ities as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, 
he coordinated certain national security matters and 
was Counselor to the Attorney General." 
Meese testified that he never considered assigning 
attorneys from the Office of Intelligence Policy and 
Review, whose job it is to review covert action find-
ings and applications for intelligence surveillance ac-
tivities. Nor, according to the Attorney General, did 
he consider assigning additional attorneys to assist 
with the formidable tasks of document review and 
witness interviews. No members of the Criminal Divi-
sion were included, even though William Weld (As-
sistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal 
Division) told Cooper and Reynolds at a staff meeting 
that morning that he thought the Criminal Division 
should be involved." Meese testified that it was his 
view at the time that there was no reason to believe 
any crime had been committed or that any criminal 
investigation was required.2? 
At their meeting on Friday afternoon, the factfind-
ing team formulated a list of witnesses to be inter-
viewed. It included McFarlane, North, Secretary 
Shultz, Secretary Weinberger, the Vice President, 
Paul Thompson, Stanley Sporkin, John McMahon, 
Charles Allen, the CIA's Deputy Director for Oper-
306 
ations, the CIA Deputy Chief Counsel, and CIA op-
erations officers. Meese listed items that needed 
action, including contacting Poindexter to gather doc-
uments and Casey to arrange interviews of Sporkin 
and McMahon. The focus of the inquiry was to be the 
November 1985 HAWKs shipment.2' 
The NSC Staff Responds by Altering and 
Destroying Evidence 
Once those at the center of the Iran arms sales 
were alerted to the Attorney General's inquiry, they 
took steps, in Colonel Earl's words, to "close down 
the compartment"?destroy all the documentary evi-
dence. 2 2 
North met with Poindexter at 1:30 p.m. and then 
again at 2:25 p.m. on November 21.23 Sometime that 
same afternoon, North instructed his secretary, Fawn 
Hall, to alter a series of official action memorandums 
that he had written during the previous year to then-
National Security Adviser McFarlane. These memo-
randums related to North's activities in raising funds 
and arranging military assistance for the Contras 
during the period of the Boland Amendment. McFar-
lane had told North a year earlier, during the 1985 
Congressional inquiry, that these memorandums raised 
significant problems under the Boland Amendment.24 
McFarlane had given North a handwritten list con-
taining the NSC's "System IV" identification numbers 
of the problem documents.* North kept McFarlane's 
list taped to his desk near the computer terminal 
during the ensuing year.25 
Sometime on November 21, 1986, North requested 
the originals of the documents on McFarlane's list 
from the System IV security officer, who found and 
provided North with all but one.** There is no evi-
dence that the System IV security officer knew of 
North's purpose in requesting these documents. 
North then proceeded to alter the original System 
IV documents by hand. The gist of his alterations was 
to eliminate references to the funds raised for the 
Contras from third countries during the Boland 
cutoff, and also to eliminate or obscure passages in 
the documents that showed the NSC staffs active 
role in facilitating the provision of military intelli-
*Hall Test., Hearings, 100-5, 6/8/87, at 478-79; North Test., Hear-
ings, 100-7, Part I, 7/8/87, at 173. Ex. FH-1. The NSC maintains a 
document tracking and filing system that includes assigning discrete 
numbers to documents prepared by the NSC staff. "System IV" is 
utilized for the most sensitive, intelligence-related documents. 
**Ex. FH-1A; Ex. OLN-71. The one document that the security 
officer could not find (System IV # 40124), he presumed to have 
been destroyed and so advised North. In fact, the document, which 
had been written in December 1984, was in the files, but the 
security officer had checked only the files for 1985. This December 
1984 document which North had sought to alter recounted a meet-
ing that North had held with an official of Country 4 to solicit 
lethal assistance for the Contras. Ex. GJS-1. The document was 
provided to the Committees during the Committees' investigation.

gence and other lethal assistance for the Contras 
during the sameripe od. 26 
North gave the doctored documents to Hall and 
instructed her to prepare new originals containing 
North's changes. Hall testified that she followed 
North's instructions without paying attention to the 
nature of the alterations or asking their purpose. She 
admitted, however, that she did not feel comfortable, 
but assumed North had a valid reason. She stated also 
that she did not then know that the Attorney General 
had commenced an investigation or that his represent-
atives would shortly be reviewing NSC documents." 
After making the alterations, Hall destroyed the 
original documents and was preparing to replace her 
file copies of the original versions of the documents 
with copies of the altered originals when she was 
distracted by North's shredding of documents and 
volunteered to help.* 
The document shredding involved North, Hall, and 
Earl. North pulled documents from his safe; Hall 
shredded them. Earl brought documents down from 
his office, and these, too, were shredded.28 Hall asked 
North if she should shred his telephone logs, and he 
agreed. Hall also shredded PROF notes and KL43 
messages.** She could not recall what other types of 
documents went into the shredder. But the quantity 
was large?approximately one and one half feet of 
documents. Indeed, so many documents were de-
stroyed that the shredding machine actually jammed 
and Hall needed assistance from the Crisis Manage-
ment Center to reactivate it. Hall testified that, al-
though documents were normally shredded in North's 
office, never before had there been such an organized 
program of document destruction or such a large 
volume of documents destroyed." 
Although Hall stated that, when she participated in 
the shredding?as in the alteration of documents?she 
did not know of the Attorney General's inquiry, 
North and Earl certainly knew. Yet they both main-
tained in their testimony that the document destruc-
tion was justified to protect the security of the covert 
action or, as Earl put it, "the compartment." 3? But in 
fact, the investigators from whom North and Earl 
were suppressing this evidence were officials of their 
own Government who had been directed to investi-
gate by the President. 
*Hall Test., Hearings, 100-5, 6/8/87, at 499-502. Because Hall 
ultimately did not complete the alteration process (by substituting 
copies of the altered documents for her file copies of the originals), 
both versions of the documents were found in the NSC files and 
provided to the Committees during the Committees' investigation. 
Exs. FH-2 through FH-6A. 
**When these PROF notes were destroyed, North and others 
apparently believed that those messages were gone forever. They 
did not know that, unless messages were deleted from the computer 
memory itself, the messages still could be retrieved for a time. Such 
retrieval took place, and that is why the Committees were able to 
obtain at least some PROF messages that North and others believed 
to have been destroyed. 
Poindexter, too, destroyed evidence. At aproxima-
tely 3:00 p.m. on November 21, the Attorney General 
telephoned Poindexter and requested that he make 
available for review all documents relating to the Iran 
initiative." Poindexter then ripped up the only signed 
copy of the President's December 1985 Finding, 
which retroactively authorized U.S. participation in 
the November 1985 arms shipment. Poindexter admit-
ted at the public hearings that he destroyed this Find-
ing because it described the Iran initiative as unambig-
uously arms-for-hostages, and therefore would have 
been politically embarrassing to the President." It 
also would have stripped away the cover story con-
cocted by the NSC staff. It would never reach the 
investigators. 
Since the President had obviously been aware of 
the December 1985 Finding when he signed it, Poin-
dexter could not explain why he thought that destroy-
ing of this Presidential record would nullify its exist-
ence 33?unless he somehow felt confident that the 
President would either fail to recall the Finding or 
deny that he had ever signed it. As recently as a week 
before Poindexter's public testimony, the White 
House announced that "[o]ur position is that [the 
Finding] never went to the President, period." 34 
Poindexter's participation in destroying evidence 
did not stop with the Finding. He also tore up certain 
PROF notes possibly used to brief the President, 
which had been stored with the Finding. Although 
Poindexter said he could not recall their content, 
these documents were of sufficient importance to be 
locked with the original Finding in Poindexter's 
secure safe.35 
In addition, during the afternoon of November 21, 
North came to Poindexter with his 1985 spiral note-
book which contained North's contemporaneous notes 
regarding the November 1985 HAWK shipment. se 
Those notes showed that North and others in the U.S. 
government were involved with that shipment." 
Like the Finding, the notes belied Poindexter's state-
ment to Congress earlier that day that the United 
States did not learn of the true contents of the ship-
ment until after it was made. Moreover, although 
Poindexter testified at the public hearings that North's 
notes did not reflect that the President had approved 
the HAWK shipment," in fact, North's notes of No-
vember 26, 1985 actually read: "R.R. directed oper-
ation to proceed. If Israelis want to provide different 
model, then we will replenish." 39 Poindexter did not 
object to North's announced intention to destroy the 
notebook.4? 
North, Poindexter, and their aides were not the 
only persons involved in the Iran-Contra Affair to 
destroy evidence in November 1986. Documents were 
also shredded at the offices of Secord's company, 
Stanford Technology Trading Group International 
(STTGI). According to the testimony of Secord's Ad-
ministrative Assistant, Shirley Napier, the documents

Chapter 20 
destroyed at STTGI included steno books, telephone 
logs, and telexes. The destruction continued over a 
period of days. The participants were Secord, Robert 
Dutton, Napier, and an STTGI secretary.4' 
Napier originally testified that the shredding activi-
ty occurred early in December 1986.42 Several weeks 
after her deposition, Napier submitted an affidavit 
changing her testimony, based on refreshed recollec-
tion, to place the shredding during the week of No-
vember 17, 1986, "probably the 19th through the 
21st"?the same week as the shredding in the White 
House.* 
North and McFarlane took other actions on No-
vember 21 in response to the Attorney General's in-
vestigation. At 3:15 p.m., North met again with 
Ledeen, this time in North's office, and discussed the 
November 1985 HAWK shipment. North knew that 
Ledeen could testify to U.S. involvement. He asked 
how Ledeen would respond to questions regarding 
the shipment. Ledeen replied that he would say he 
was aware of the shipment but did not know who 
authorized it or how or when the authorization took 
place. North said that was fine. North stated also that 
he had been saving things for "his grandchildren" 
which he would now have to shred.** 
The Attorney General's investigation went forward 
later that afternoon with an interview of McFarlane 
by Meese and Cooper. Attorney General Meese urged 
McFarlane to tell the whole truth, assuring him this 
was in the President's interest. McFarlane said he 
believed that the November 1985 shipment contained 
oil drilling equipment until he was told otherwise in 
May of 1986.43 When asked if he had told Secretary 
Shultz in 1985 about the HAWK shipment, McFar-
lane said he could not recall, but did not dispute it. 
Cooper testified that neither he nor the Attorney 
General told McFarlane that Secretary Shultz had a 
contemporaneous note indicating that McFarlane had 
told him about the HAWK shipment before it oc-
curred.44 But McFarlane testified that he learned of 
the note from the Attorney General at that same 
interview.45 McFarlane's version is corroborated by 
the fact that he called the State Department right 
*Napier Aff., 5/11/87, at Par. 7. Dutton maintained at the hear-
ing that the document destruction at STTGI was undertaken be-
cause "[wle had a great concern about the security of the office. . . 
It was General Secord's desire that we don't have any superfluous 
material laying around the office." But since Dutton also testified 
that the only records of his that were shredded were supposedly 
duplicates, he could not explain how destruction of only the dupli-
cates preserved operational security. In any event, Dutton did not 
testify that the numerous other documents shredded at STTGI 
were only duplicates. Dutton Test., Hearings, 100-3, 5/27/87, at 
251. 
**Ledeen Dep., 6/19/87, at 22. Ledeen also recalled in his depo-
sition that, prior to November 21, North had told him that the 
Justice Department was investigating the possibly illegal sale of 
HAWK missiles in 1985 and suggested that Ledeen retain an attor-
ney. North told Ledeen that he also had been advised by someone 
from the Justice Department to get an attorney. Id. at 9-10, 27. 
308 
after the interview asking for a copy of the note." 
The note, of course, was highly significant, because it 
was the only existing document known to McFarlane 
that indicated that U.S. officials did indeed know of, 
approve, and had participated in, the HAWK ship-
ment. North and Poindexter apparently believed they 
had destroyed or otherwise removed all other such 
documentary evidence. 
During the Attorney General's interview, McFar-
lane did not volunteer anything about the document 
shredding comment from North earlier in the day. 
Nor did McFarlane volunteer that he knew that pro-
ceeds of the Iran arms sales had been diverted to the 
Contras.47 McFarlane testified that he should have 
told the Attorney General, but it did not occur to him 
to mention these facts." 
At the conclusion of the interview, after Cooper 
had left, McFarlane stayed behind to speak privately 
to Meese. He told Attorney General Meese that al-
though he had taken full responsibility in a speech 
delivered the night before to "protect the President," 
he wanted Meese to know that the President was 
"four square" behind the Iran initiative." According 
to McFarlane, the Attorney General said it was pref-
erable legally if the President had authorized the early 
shipments. 5 
Immediately after leaving the Attorney General's 
office, McFarlane used a pay telephone outside of the 
Justice Department to call North." North's notes of 
that call indicate that McFarlane said he was told that 
the Arms Export Control Act was not a problem and 
that "RR" [Reagan] would be supportive of a "mental 
finding." McFarlane sent Poindexter a PROF note 
later that evening similarly describing his meeting 
with the Attorney General. In that note he stated: 
[I]t appears that the matter of not notifying [Con-
gress] about the Israeli transfers can be covered if 
the President made a 'mental finding' before the 
transfers took place. Well in that sense we ought 
to be OK because he was all for letting the Israe-
lis do anything they wanted at the very first 
briefing in the hospital. Ed [Meese] seemed re-
lieved at that.52 
While the Attorney General and Cooper met with 
McFarlane, Reynolds, and Richardson spent Friday 
afternoon at the Justice Department doing routine 
work and reading the NSC staff's chronologies.53 At-
torney General Meese testified that he did not send 
anyone to review the NSC documents on Friday 
afternoon, despite the short reporting deadline of 
Monday afternoon, because "there was no urgency to 
it." 54 It was midafternoon anyway and the NSC staff 
needed time to prepare their documents for review.55 
After the McFarlane interview, Meese, Cooper, 
Reynolds, and Richardson made plans to meet the 
next morning. Sometime in the early evening, Secre-
tary Shultz called to tell Meese that he was available

Approved For Release 2011/05/25 CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 20 
for an interview the following morning. Meese also 
called Secretary Weinberger,56 who told Meese that 
he could be reached that weekend at the hospital to 
which his wife had been admitted. Subsequently, At-
torney General Meese spoke to Secretary Weinberger 
over the weekend and, although he could not recall 
what Secretary Weinberger said, he remembered con-
cluding that Secretary Weinberger had no useful in-
formation.5 7 
On November 21, Attorney General Meese called 
Casey to let him know about the inquiry and what he 
would be doing at the CIA. Meese also mentioned he 
wanted to meet with Casey over the weekend." 
Later that evening, Cooper made arrangements for 
John McGinnis, an attorney from the Justice Depart-
ment's Office of Legal Counsel, to review intelligence 
reports regarding the Iran arms sales. McGinnis re-
viewed these reports overnight and reported back to 
Cooper that they indicated that the U.S. was involved 
in the 1985 Israeli shipments.59 According to the At-
torney General's statement during his November 25 
press conference, these reports also indicated that 
excess profits from the sale had been made available 
for some other purpose.6? 
As the day drew to a close, North remained late in 
his office to meet with Richard Miller, a private fund-
raiser for the Contra cause, who arrived at North's 
office as North was packing his briefcase. North 
asked Miller to drive him to Dupont Circle. Either 
during that drive, or the day before, North told 
Miller that the Attorney General had advised him to 
get an attorney. The Attorney General denied telling 
North to get an attorney; and North testified that it 
was Casey who so advised him." Miller dropped 
North at the office building of North's attorney.62 
November 22: Diversion is 
Discovered 
With the first McFarlane interview behind them, At-
torney General Meese and Cooper began their inter-
view schedule in earnest early Saturday morning. At 
8:00 a.m. they interviewed Secretary Shultz and his 
assistant Charles Hill at the State Department." Re-
garding the November 1985 shipment, Secretary 
Shultz said that on November 18, 1985, McFarlane 
told him that Israel was going to send HAWK mis-
siles to Iran in a trade for the release of U.S. hostages. 
Secretary Shultz also informed Meese and Cooper 
that the President had told him earlier that week that 
he [the President] had contemporaneous knowledge of 
the November 1985 HAWK shipment.64 Meese and 
Cooper asked Hill for the notes of the Shultz/McFar-
lane conversation, which Hill provided on Monday 
morning, November 24.65 
Secretary Shultz testified that, during his interview, 
he expressed concern that the Iran arms sales might 
be connected to the Contras. Secretary Shultz said in 
his testimony he based this concern on the fact that 
Southern Air Transport's name had come up in the 
Contra resupply operation and also in the Iran arms 
transactions.66 Secretary Shultz's version of this event 
is corroborated by Hill's contemporaneous notes of 
Meese's interview of Shultz. Those notes reflect that 
Secretary Shultz told Meese: "Another angle worries 
me. Could get mixed up with help for freedom fight-
ers in Nicaragua. One thing may be overlapping with 
another. May be a connection." 67 
During his public testimony, Attorney General 
Meese initially denied that Secretary Shultz had ever 
mentioned any connection between the Iran arms 
sales and the Contras. When Hill's notes were shown 
to the Attorney General at the hearings, Meese 
denied that the notes were made at the interview, and 
stated they were notes of a later meeting at the State 
Department between Shultz and State Department 
Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer." During his next 
day of testimony, Meese stated that the reference to a 
connection between the Iran arms sales and the Con-
tras was only to "a political connection that enemies 
of the administration would love to wrap together" 
(which also appears in Hill's notes). Attorney General 
Meese denied that Secretary Shultz was referring to 
any actual connection between the Iran arms sales 
and the Contras.69 
Secretary Shultz's version is corroborated by Hill's 
contemporaneous notes of Shultz's interview with 
Meese. Moreover, on November 23, the day after 
Secretary Shultz's interview with Meese, Sofaer told 
Cooper that he was concerned that the surplus of 
funds from the Iran arms sales had possibly been used 
by Southern Air Transport to subsidize the Contra 
resupply efort.7? 
After Secretary Shultz's interview, the factfinding 
team decided that Reynolds and Richardson should 
go to the NSC to review documents. They were to 
look in particular for documents that would indicate 
whether the 1985 shipments were authorized by the 
U.S. Government.7' 
After Reynolds and Richardson left for the NSC, 
Attorney General Meese and Cooper interviewed 
Stanley Sporkin, former General Counsel to the 
CIA." Sporkin told them that he drafted a Finding 
in November 1985 after he learned that the CIA had 
assisted in arranging transportation of the HAWK 
missiles to Iran.73 
Reynolds and Richardson arrived at the West Wing 
of the White House sometime after 11:00 a.m. NSC 
General Counsel Paul Thompson escorted them to 
North's office in the Old Executive Office Building, 
where they met Earl. The Justice Department offi-
cials told Earl they only wanted to see documents 
relating to the Iran initiative. Earl pulled out accor-
dion-style brown folders from the shelves behind 
North's desk and placed them on the table.74

Chapter 20 
Richardson also asked for documents from Poin-
dexter's and Thompson's files. Thompson replied that 
they did not have any because as soon as they had 
read the documents, they sent them back to the origi-
nating office. 75 
Reynolds and Richardson began to review the doc-
uments on the table at approximately noon. Accord-
ing to Reynolds, sometime during the first hour of 
their review, Reynolds came across an undated, un-
signed memorandum describing the particulars of a 
proposed Iran arms transaction to take place in early 
April 1986. He read the memorandum and put it back. 
He saw another version of the memorandum with 
additional information describing an upcoming ship-
ment of arms to Iran including a financial breakdown 
of the transaction. Reynolds did not set aside either of 
these memorandums for copying. He recalled that 
neither version included any section setting forth the 
diversion of arms sales funds to the Contras. To the 
best of the Committees' knowledge, these versions 
have never been recovered.76 
Reynolds continued his document review of a 
folder containing intelligence reports. In the back of 
this folder was a white folder stamped with a red 
White House label which contained what appeared to 
be a third version of the memorandum he had seen 
earlier. He quickly flipped through it. He noted that 
page 5 included a paragraph stating that $12 million 
worth of residual funds from the arms sales would be 
used to purchase supplies for "the Nicaraguan Demo-
cratic Resistance Forces." This materiel was needed 
to "bridge" the gap between current shortages and 
"when Congressionally approved lethal assistance . . . 
can be delivered." 77 
Reynolds was shocked. He passed the memoran-
dum to Richardson. Richardson read it and was also 
surprised. Reynolds intentionally did not clip the doc-
ument so as not to draw attention to it, but returned it 
to the file where he could later find it. He continued 
reviewing other documents." 
At approximately 1:45 p.m. Reynolds and Richard-
son broke for lunch with Cooper and Attorney Gen-
eral Meese. On the way out, they met North. Reyn-
olds told North they had not seen any 1985 files, and 
North promised to produce them.79 
During lunch at the Old Ebbitt Grill, Reynolds told 
Attorney General Meese and Cooper he had found a 
memorandum which indicated that $12 million gener-
ated from the Iran arms sales may have gone to the 
Contras. Attorney General Meese and Cooper ex-
pressed great surprise. There was discussion of wheth-
er North wrote the memorandum. The remainder of 
the lunch was devoted to a discussion of the 1985 
shipments and the data collected by McGinnis. There 
was no discussion of securing documents.8? 
The Attorney General's methodology for conduct-
ing the inquiry changed at this point. Before discov-
ery of the diversion memorandum, all interviews were 
conducted by the Attorney General with another Jus-
310 
tice Department official and notes were taken. There-
after, with the exception of the North interview, all 
interviews conducted by Meese were one-on-one, 
with no notes taken?including interviews of Casey, 
McFarlane, Poindexter, Regan and the Vice Presi-
dent.* 
After Reynolds and Richardson had left the NSC 
for lunch on November 22, North reviewed more 
documents and selected some for shredding. North's 
office shredder was jammed, however, and other 
likely locations in the Old Executive Office Building 
were not open. Later, Earl saw North with a file full 
of documents standing beside Paul Thompson. North 
indicated he was going to the White House Situation 
Room to use the shredder there." 
North testified that he was actually shredding docu-
ments in his office while Reynolds and Richardson 
were present.82 However, Reynolds and Richardson 
denied this, and Earl, as noted, testified that North's 
office shredder was jammed." 
While the Attorney General's team was meeting at 
the Old Ebbitt Grill, Casey and Poindexter were also 
having lunch together. They were joined by North. 
In his testimony, Poindexter recalled very little about 
that 2-hour lunch other than that it was initiated by 
Casey and that Casey discussed his testimony before 
the House and Senate Intelligence Committees the 
day before. 84 
Reynolds and Richardson returned to the NSC at 
approximately 3:30 p.m. where they found North and 
Earl. Richardson testified that everything appeared to 
be as they had left it." 
While Reynolds and Richardson reviewed docu-
ments, North worked at this desk and spoke on the 
telephone. Richardson took notes of some of these 
calls. He overheard North speak to an Israeli using 
various code words, including "Beethoven" in refer-
ence to Poindexter. North told the Israeli that a lot 
had come out about the Iran initiative already, but the 
most sensitive information had not been exposed." 
During that afternoon, North sat down with Reyn-
olds and Richardson and told them he was ready to 
answer their questions. They responded that they 
were there only to review documents and the Attor-
ney General would interview North later.87 Accord-
ing to Richardson, North said "he knew he would not 
be long for this job." 88 
Reynolds and Richardson reviewed documents 
until approximately 7:15 p.m., at which time they and 
North left North's office. Reynolds and Richardson 
made plans to complete their review Sunday morn-
ing.89 
*Meese Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/29/87, at 78-81. Meese testified 
that the reason he did not take notes of his interviews with Casey, 
McFarlane, Poindexter, Regan or the Vice President was that he 
was not attempting to solicit a great deal of information, but merely 
trying to confirm what North had said. Id. at 331-34.

Chapter 20 
North called Attorney General Meese at 3:40 p.m. 
that afternoon to arrange the interview.90 Meese 
asked to interview North on Sunday morning, but 
North said he wanted to attend church and take his 
family to lunch first. Meese agreed to set the inter-
view for 2:00 p.m.91 
Six minutes after North spoke to Meese on Novem-
ber 22, Casey called Meese and said there were mat-
ters he wanted to discuss with him.92 The two met at 
Casey's home at 6:00 p.m." By the time of this meet-
ing, Attorney General Meese had reason to believe 
that the CIA's version of Casey's proposed testimony 
was almost certainly false. Indeed, by then Attorney 
General Meese had interviewed Secretary Shultz, 
who had contemporaneous documentation for his 
recollection of the November 1985 HAWKs ship-
ment, and former CIA General Counsel Sporkin, who 
had been told by Casey's subordinates in November 
1985 that missiles were shipped. On another issue, the 
Attorney General had strong reason to believe there 
was a connection between the arms sales (in which 
the CIA had been involved) and the Contras: the 
diversion memorandum. 
Despite Casey's obviously central position in any 
investigation of these matters, Attorney General 
Meese chose to meet Casey alone. He took no notes 
of the meeting, nor was the meeting otherwise re-
corded. The Committees' information about the meet-
ing is thus derived solely from Attorney General 
Meese's testimony. 
According to Meese, Casey said that he had been 
contacted in October 1986 by a former business asso-
ciate named Roy Furmark. Furmark told Casey that 
certain Canadians who had financed the Iran arms 
sales had not been repaid and were therefore threaten-
ing to expose the arms sales. Furmark had represented 
that the Canadians would claim that the proceeds had 
been used for "Israeli or United States Government 
projects." 9 4 The Attorney General explained that 
Casey said he had not told him about the Furmark 
visit earlier because, before the factfinding inquiry 
began, there was no reason to tell the him.95 
In testimony before the Senate and House Intelli-
gence Committees in December 1986, Attorney Gen-
eral Meese was not specifically asked about, and he 
did not volunteer any reference to, proceeds being 
diverted to Israeli or U.S. projects." 
Attorney General Meese has consistently claimed 
that he did not tell Casey about the diversion memo-
randum, or ask him about the diversion, even though 
Meese recognized it as a bombshell as soon as his staff 
reported it to him. The reason Attorney General 
Meese gave for not asking Casey about the diversion 
memorandum was that he thought it inappropriate to 
do so until North was questioned. Attorney General 
Meese also testified that, despite the fact that Casey 
mentioned a claim that proceeds had been diverted to 
U.S. projects, Attorney General Meese did not feel 
the conversation could logically have led to questions 
regarding a diversion of those proceeds to the Con-
tras without revealing to Casey what Meese knew. 
Attorney General Meese testified that, "I felt it was 
not appropriate to discuss this with anyone, even as 
good a friend as Mr. Casey, until I found out what it 
was all about." So, in a meeting that lasted between 
30 minutes and an hour, Meese, according to his testi-
mony, avoided the subject.97 
While Casey and Meese were meeting, Cooper and 
Associate Deputy Attorney General William McGin-
nis were at the CIA interviewing attorneys from the 
CIA General Counsel's office and operations officers 
regarding the events surrounding the November 1985 
HAWK shipment and subsequent Finding." Cooper 
purposely did not ask questions at the CIA about the 
diversion for fear it would get back to North.99 
Cooper did not mention the diversion memo to 
McGinnis. 
November 23: Investigation and 
Obstruction Continue 
The Attorney General's investigation continued to 
build on Sunday, November 23 toward the afternoon 
interview with North. From 9:00 a.m. to noon, 
Cooper and McGinnis completed more interviews at 
the CIA. Reynolds and Richardson returned to the 
NSC to continue their document review, although 
they apparently never did complete it."? 
At the CIA, Cooper and McGinnis interviewed 
Charles Allen, Duane Clarridge, George Jameson, 
and David Doherty. McGinnis interviewed Clarridge, 
who told him that the CIA's involvement in Novem-
ber 1985 was limited to providing to North the name 
of a proprietary airline to fly oil drilling equipment to 
Iran. Clarridge also explained that he made arrange-
ments for flight clearances.* 
Meanwhile, North, who had told the Attorney 
General he was not available for an interview until 
the afternoon because he wanted to go to church, 
called McFarlane Sunday morning and asked to meet 
with him. McFarlane was getting ready to leave for 
church himself and told North to meet him at his 
office at noon. North said he would bring his attor-
ney."' North arrived alone at McFarlane's office at 
12:30 p.m.. North told McFarlane everything was on 
track except for one thing that could be a problem: 
the diversion. According to McFarlane, he asked 
*Cooper Dep., 6/22/87, at 180. Evidence before the Committees 
shows that Clarridge was sent a cable from a CIA Chief in Country 
15 on or about November 23, 1985, reporting the HAWKs-for-
hostages November deal. Notably, the cable is missing from the 
CIA's files. Hearings, 6/24/87, at 260-73; CI-C27. The missing 
cable, if found, would have punctured any claim that no one at the 
CIA was aware in November 1985 prior to the HAWK shipment 
that the flight clearance problems and the use of a CIA proprietary 
airline involved the shipment of weapons to Iran. Id. This episode 
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.

Chapter 20 
North if the diversion had been approved and North 
replied that he would not do anything that was not 
approved. North said that the diversion was a matter 
of record in a memorandum he had written for Poin-
dexter. North did not explain to McFarlane why he 
thought the diversion could be a problem in light of 
his belief that all documents relating to the diversion 
had been destroyed.102 On the other hand, North 
testified that he recalls only assuring McFarlane that 
all diversion documents had been destroyed; he ex-
pressly did not recall telling McFarlane that there 
was a memorandum describing the diversion that 
might cause a problem. 
At that point, attorney Thomas Green arrived at 
McFarlane's office. Green told McFarlane he had 
been an Assistant U.S. Attorney and had dealt with 
problems of this kind before. Green advised McFar-
lane and North to state the story truthfully and let the 
chips fall where they may.'" Not long thereafter, 
Richard Secord arrived as well, but by that time, 
McFarlane had to leave for an appointment. 
From approximately 12:45 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., Attor-
ney General Meese, Reynolds, Cooper, and Richard-
son met to discuss the upcoming interview of 
North.104 North arrived, alone, at approximately 2:15 
p.m. Meese did most of the questioning. Richardson 
and Reynolds took notes.105 
The Attorney General began by telling North he 
wanted all the facts, and did not want North to 
coverup to protect himself or the President. He then 
asked North to explain the arms sales from the begin-
ning. North replied with a combination of fact and 
fiction. All the while he knew that the Attorney Gen-
eral was acting under orders from the President and 
that the Attorney General's findings would be report-
ed back to the President.'" 
North said he was unaware of the first shipment of 
504 TOWs until after it occurred. Regarding the No-
vember 1985 HAWK shipment, North said he re-
ceived a call from McFarlane in Geneva who told 
him to contact Israeli Defense Minister Rabin to help 
Israel move something to Iran. North then claimed 
that Defense Minister Rabin told him it was oilrelated 
equipment. North sent Secord to help with the ship-
ment. North also called Duane Clarridge at the CIA 
to get a CIA proprietary to fly the equipment. When 
Secord saw the shipment in Israel, he told North the 
cargo was 18 or 19 HAWK missiles. The implication 
in North's statements?that he was unaware until in-
formed by Secord that the flight was to contain 
HAWK missiles?was false. As North subsequently 
admitted in his public hearing testimony, he knew the 
nature of the cargo from his first involvement in the 
November shipment.107 
North also claimed, falsely, that Poindexter knew 
nothing of the November 1985 HAWK shipment. 
North stated, again falsely, that when he discovered 
from Secord that there were HAWKs on the plane he 
notified someone at the CIA, possibly Casey.'" 
312 
While lying to the Attorney General about other 
aspects of the November 1985 HAWK shipment, 
North admitted that his statements about that ship-
ment in the NSC chronology and at the November 
20, 1986, meeting to review Casey's draft testimony 
were false. As discussed above, North had claimed in 
the chronology and at the meeting that the United 
States had to force the Iranians to return the HAWK 
missiles. In his interview with the Attorney General, 
North admitted that it was the Iranians who were 
dissatisfied and demanded their money back.'" 
Attorney General Meese then asked North to de-
scribe the money flow. Again, North lied. North said 
the money passed from the Iranians to the Israelis 
who in turn paid into a CIA account which reim-
bursed the Army for the weapons. North made no 
mention of Secord or the Lake Resources account 
through which the money had actually passed." ? 
Then the Attorney General showed North the di-
version memorandum. The first page referred to U.S. 
acquiescence in the August 1985 TOW shipment. 
Meese asked North to explain if this was an armsfor-
hostages deal. North asserted that, although he dis-
cussed the strategic opening of Iran with President 
Reagan, with the President "it always came back to 
the hostages." North said the President was drawn to 
the linkage between arms and hostages and it was a 
terrible mistake to say the President wanted the stra-
tegic relationship with Iran, because the President 
wanted the hostages.' " 
After that exchange, the Attorney General turned 
to the diversion. He directed North's attention to the 
section of the memorandum describing how the "re-
siduals" would go to the Nicaraguan Resistance. 
North appeared to be "visibly surprised." He asked if 
they had found a "cover memo." Reynolds said that 
none had been found?without first questioning North 
as to whether he recalled a cover memo, or to whom 
it had been directed, or what it said. After Reynolds 
informed North that no cover memo had been found, 
the Attorney General asked North if they should 
have found a cover memo, and North said "no." 112 
The Attorney General asked North if he had dis-
cussed the diversion with the President. North replied 
that Poindexter was the point of contact with the 
President.113 
Attorney General Meese pointed out that if the 
President had approved the diversion, North probably 
would have a record of it. North agreed and said he 
did not think it was approved by the President. The 
Attorney General asked whether other files might 
contain a document indicating Presidential approval, 
and North said he would check."4 
The Attorney General asked North if there was 
anything more. North said that only the February 
1986 shipment and the second shipment had produced 
residuals to the Contras. North also said that only 
three people in the Government knew of the diver-

Chapter 20 
sion?Poindexter, McFarlane, and himself. North said 
the CIA did not handle the "residuals" and, though 
some in the CIA may have suspected a diversion, he 
did not think anyone at the CIA knew.115 If North's 
testimony at the public hearings was truthful, then 
these statements, too, were lies. At the hearings, 
North testified that Casey knew, approved, and was 
enthusiastic about the diversion as early as February 
1986. 
And of course, North was aware when he spoke to 
the Attorney General that Earl knew of the diver-
sion.* 
North claimed that the diversion was an Israeli 
idea, probably Nir's?another lie refuted by documen-
tary evidence.116 He said the money went straight 
from the Israelis into three Swiss bank accounts 
opened by FDN leader Calero."7 In fact, the divert-
ed funds were deposited to the Swiss account main-
tained by Secord and Hakim. North claimed that the 
October 1986 shipment of TOWs did not produce 
residual funds because North, over Nir's objection, 
charged much less for the weapons. He did this, he 
said, because the Contras had $100 million in U.S. aid 
and North did not want to create the impression of 
private profit."8 
The Attorney General asked North if there were 
any other items he had not told them about and 
North responded negatively. However, North volun-
teered that if the diversion were kept quiet,, the only 
other problem would be the November 1985 HAWK 
shipment, which someone ought to say was author-
ized. The Justice Department officials made no 
reply."9 
Attorney General Meese then confirmed to North 
that he had to share this information with the Presi-
dent and determine if he was aware of it. Meese again 
asked North about other problem areas, including 
complaints from people who financed the deals and 
lost money. North responded only that Ghorbanifar 
had lost money in a "sting." 120 
At this point in the interview, the Attorney General 
left to pick up his wife at the airport."' Cooper 
continued further questioning North regarding author-
ity for the 1985 shipments. Cooper asked North if he 
believed at the time that the November shipment con-
tained oil drilling equipment. North replied that he 
really thought it was munitions, but boasted that he 
could nevertheless pass a lie detector test on whether 
he thought it was oil drilling equipment.122 
North also volunteered that Southern Air Trans-
port (SAT) hauled the 1986 arms shipments and that 
SAT was being investigated by the Justice Depart-
ment for its involvement in the Contra resupply oper-
ation.123 
''North Test., Hearings, 100-7, Part I. 7/8/87, at 139-40. Indeed, 
North had told Earl during the spring of 1986 that Casey knew of 
the diversion. Earl Dep., 5/2/87, at 37. 
The North interview concluded at 5:55 p.m. as the 
Attorney General was returning. North was not told 
what would happen next.124 Although the Justice 
Department officials noticed North's surprise that 
they had a copy of the diversion memorandum North 
had written, no one asked North if he had shredded 
or otherwise disposed of documents, nor did the Jus-
tice Department officials take any steps to secure 
North's remaining documents. 
Later that night, Sofaer called Cooper to find out 
the status of the investigation. Cooper asked the basis 
of Sofaer's earlier concern about the possibility of 
surplus funds being generated from the Iran arms 
sales. Sofaer explained that he thought there may 
have been a difference between the purchase price 
and cost price. Sofaer also volunteered that he sus-
pected that SAT may have been given excess profits 
from the Iran arms sales to finance the Contra resup-
ply operation. Cooper did not mention the diversion 
memorandum or North's interview.125 
That evening, North called McFarlane and Poin-
dexter.126 Afterwards, North shredded additional 
documents at his office until at least 4:30 a.m., when a 
security guard noticed that North's office had not 
been secured for the day. North responded to the 
officer's security report by claiming that when the 
officer checked the office, North was in the bath-
room.127 
November 24: Informing the 
President 
Early Monday morning, November 24, McGinnis 
called George Jameson of the CIA to ask certain 
limited questions, and Cooper researched possible 
criminal violations. Attorney General Meese planned 
to meet with the President, the Vice President, 
McFarlane, Poindexter, and Regan.'" 
McGinnis continued to speak that morning with 
CIA personnel about the money flow. During one of 
his conversations, he was told of a rumor at CIA that 
the surplus funds had been diverted to the Con-
tras.'" McGinnis told Cooper of this rumor. Cooper 
then told McGinnis about the diversion memorandum 
and the North interview.'" 
Cooper went to the State Department Monday 
morning to obtain Hill's notes relating to the Novem-
ber 1985 HAWK shipment. At first Hill was reluctant 
to surrender them. He agreed, however, only when 
Sofaer told him they were needed for a criminal in-
vestigation.131 
The Attorney General called the head of the Jus-
tice Department's Criminal Division, William Weld, 
at 9:55 a.m. On the previous Friday in an early morn-
ing staff meeting attended by Reynolds and Cooper 
among others, Weld had urged that the Criminal Di-
vision should be involved in the weekend inquiry. He 
had argued, for example, that the Criminal Division

Chapter 20 
had already made representations to a court denying 
any U.S. Government involvement in arms sales to 
Iran, and that the Criminal Division should know the 
facts.* Attorney General Meese told Weld during 
their Monday morning call that the Criminal Division 
was being left out of the Iran investigation on purpose 
and not as a result of negligence. Weld inferred that 
the Attorney General had been informed that Weld 
had argued for Criminal Division involvement. Weld 
told Meese that he had registered a concern at the 
Friday meeting about Meese's personal involvement 
in the investigation, warning: "If you tried to carry 
too much water here some might spill on you." 132 
Early Monday morning, Attorney General Meese 
called McFarlane to arrange a second interview.** 
They met alone at the Justice Department and no one 
took notes. '33 Meese asked if McFarlane knew about 
the diversion. McFarlane responded that he learned of 
it from North during the Tehran mission in May 1986. 
McFarlane told Attorney General Meese that North 
claimed to have approval for the diversion. 
McFarlane testified that the only other question 
Attorney General Meese asked was whether he had 
told anyone else about the diversion. Meese, however, 
could not recall asking that.'34 Meese never asked 
McFarlane if the President had approved the diver-
sion, nor did he show McFarlane the diversion memo-
randum. Meese did not ask McFarlane why he had 
not told him about the diversion during their Friday 
interview. McFarlane did not mention that he had 
spoken to Poindexter and North after North's inter-
view with the Attorney General."35 
Attorney General Meese went to the White House 
at 11:00 a.m. to meet with the President and Regan 
pursuant to an appointment he had made earlier that 
morning. Meese testified that he told the President 
that his team had found a memorandum at the NSC 
which included plans to divert excess funds from the 
Iran arms sales to the Contras. Attorney General 
Meese also said that North and McFarlane had con-
firmed this diversion. The President, Meese said, was 
very surprised. Meese told the President there was 
more factfinding to do before he could give him a full 
report at the National Security Planning Group 
(NSPG) meeting. '36 
Regan had a different recollection of the morning 
events. Regan testified that Attorney General Meese 
told him about the diversion prior to meeting with the 
President. Regan described his own reaction to news 
of the diversion as "horror, horror, sheer horror." 137 
*Weld Dep., 7/16/87, at 13-14. Cooper and Reynolds each testi-
fied that he had no recollection of such a conversation. Cooper 
Dep., 6/22/87, at 123; Reynolds Dep., 8/27/87, at 31-32. However, 
Richardson not only recalled the Weld statement, but took notes.

spoke to Poindexter prior to his meeting with the Attorney Gener-
al. Right after speaking to McFarlane, Poindexter spoke to North 
on a secure telephone. See Poindexter logs. 
314 
According to Regan, Attorney General Meese told 
him that North had done the diversion, and Regan 
said the President needed to be immediately informed. 
Attorney General Meese said he did not want to tell 
the President until he could nail down some other 
things. They went to see the President, but told him 
only that the factfinding inquiry had uncovered some 
serious problems and that they would need to meet 
later that afternoon. They set a meeting for 4:15 
p.m.138 
No one took notes of the Attorney General's morn-
ing meeting with the President. Regan recalled that 
Meese had papers with him from which he seemed to 
be reading. However, according to Regan, Attorney 
General Meese never told him there actually was a 
memorandum spelling out the diversion. Regan testi-
fied that Meese "kept using the phrase, 'I have got a 
few last-minute things to button up before I can give 
you the details.'" '39 
Attorney General Meese returned to the White 
House for the 2:00 p.m. NSPG meeting. Richardson's 
notes indicate that prior to that, the Attorney General 
met briefly with the Vice President at 1:40 p.m.140 
Attorney General Meese, however, testified that this 
meeting occurred after 4:00 p.m.141 Continuing the 
pattern, Meese met with the Vice President alone and 
no notes were taken. Meese reported that the Vice 
President was unaware of the diversion.142 
Back at the Department of Justice, Reynolds and 
Cooper had arranged to meet at 2:00 p.m. with attor-
ney Tom Green.'" Green and Reynolds had a long-
standing professional relationship, so Green ap-
proached Reynolds for a meeting.144 
Reynolds and Cooper both understood that Green 
had spoken to North after North's Sunday interview 
with the Attorney General.* Yet Green's version of 
the events differed sharply from what North had told 
them. First, Green said the idea to divert funds to the 
Contras originated with Albert Hakim, while North 
had tagged Amiram Nir with originating the plan. 
Green claimed there were no illegalities because the 
diverted money did not belong to the United States. 
Green urged that the facts not be made public be-
cause it would risk the lives of contacts in Iran as 
well as the hostages.' 46 
Green also recounted other facts which differed 
from what North had said the day before. In contrast 
to North's version of the money flow, Green ex-

purposes of that meeting. Cooper Test., Hearings, 100-6, 6/25/87, at 
279-82. Eventually, Cooper decided that if Green represented 
anyone, it was Albert Hakim, because Green referred to a long-
standing business relationship with Hakim. Id.; CJC-19. It was 
Reynolds' impression, however, that Green did not represent any 
particular individual during the meeting. Reynolds Dep., 9/1/87, at 
37.

Chapter 20 
plained that the diversion was accomplished by rout-
ing the money through Hakim's financial network. 
Green said that Hakim told the Iranians that in order 
to foster good relations, the Iranians should make a 
contribution for the use of the Contras or of the 
United States. Green also claimed North felt he was 
doing the "Lord's work." 146 
Sometime on Monday, Reynolds told Meese what 
Green had said about the diversion.147 Attorney 
General Meese, however, testified that he recalled no 
mention of the fact that money went through Hakim's 
financial network and concluded from what Reynolds 
told him that Green "added nothing particularly 
new . . . .9, 148 
At the White House, the NSPG met from 2:00 p.m. 
to 3:45 p.m. Present were the President, the Vice 
President, Poindexter, Casey, Attorney General 
Meese, Secretary Weinberger, Secretary Shultz, 
Regan and George Cave. Although the sole topic at 
the meeting was the Iran initiative, neither Attorney 
General Meese nor Regan mentioned the diversion, 
nor did either ask any one present about it.149 
Meese's notes of the meeting indicate that at one 
point Regan asked about the November 1985 HAWK 
shipment, and specifically, who had authorized it, 
who knew of it, and whether the President was told 
of it. Poindexter implied that McFarlane had handled 
the Iran initiative by himself from July to December 
1985. Poindexter told the group that there was "no 
documentation" of the shipment.15? 
After the NSPG meeting, Attorney General Meese 
met with Poindexter from 4:15 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. to 
find out what he knew of the diversion. Although 
North had told the Attorney General that Poindexter 
was the point of contact with the President, the At-
torney General chose to meet alone with him and to 
take no notes.'51 
Poindexter told Attorney General Meese that 
North had given him only enough hints about the 
diversion to know what was going on, but that he had 
not inquired further. Poindexter testified that the At-
torney General never asked him if the President knew 
of the diversion.'" Although Meese testified at his 
deposition that he thought he had asked that question, 
he stated at the public hearings that he had not asked 
so direct a question, but only whether anyone else in 
the White House knew.'" Poindexter testified that 
he did not tell the Attorney General he actually ap-
proved the diversion, because he wanted the Presi-
dent and his staff to retain deniability.154 
Poindexter told the Attorney General that he knew 
that when the diversion became public he would have 
to resign, and would defer to the Attorney General's 
judgment on the timing of his resignation.155 Attor-
ney General Meese asked no further questions be-
cause he needed to meet with the President at 4:30 
p.m. as scheduled.'" The Attorney General, howev-
er, never went back to Poindexter to obtain additional 
details after meeting with the President. 
Attorney General Meese met alone with the Presi-
dent and Regan. According to Meese, he told the 
President that Poindexter had confirmed the fact of 
the diversion.'" According to Regan, Meese was 
informing the President for the first time of the diver-
sion of funds from the arms sales into Swiss bank 
accounts controlled by the Contras.'" Regan said 
the President appeared crestfallen. The Attorney 
General told the President that the person primarily 
responsible was North, but that Poindexter had some 
inkling of the diversion and let it happen.159 
According to Regan, the conversation then turned 
to making the information public. Regan suggested 
they establish a commission to investigate the facts as 
soon as possible. Regan also suggested that the Presi-
dent announce the situation at the press conference 
and turn questions over to Meese.'" The President 
said they should think about the matter overnight and 
decide how it should be handled."' 
Attorney General Meese testified that they dis-
cussed the possibility of Poindexter's resignation that 
afternoon with the President, and later Meese and 
Regan met separately.'" Regan said he stayed 
behind with the President after Meese left and dis-
cussed the possibility of Poindexter's resignation. 
Regan told the President that they would have to 
take steps to "clean up the mess," including asking 
Poindexter to resign. The President was silent, ac-
cording to Regan, because he "never comments on 
something of that nature." By virtue of the President's 
silence, Regan inferred that the President had con-
sented to his soliciting Poindexter's resignation.'" 
During the late afternoon, a meeting took place at 
the CIA between Roy Furmark and Casey.'" Fur-
mark described to Casey in detail the financing ar-
rangement of the arms sales. Casey produced for Fur-
mark the CIA bank account information which dem-
onstrated the flow of funds in and out of the CIA 
accounts. Casey had questions about Lake Resources 
because he had concluded there was only $30,000 left 
in the account. Casey called North, in Furmark's 
presence, and asked North who actually owed Saudi 
financier Khashoggi the money he claimed to have 
lost in financing the arms sales. North told Casey that 
? the Israelis and Iranians owed Khashoggi the 
money.165 
Casey then called Cooper and asked him if he ever 
heard of "Lakeside Resources." Cooper responded 
that it sounded vaguely familiar but could not recall 
specific reference to it in their inquiry.'" 
After Meese left the White House, Regan returned 
a call he had received earlier that day from Casey. 
Casey told Regan he wanted to see him and suggested 
he stop at Casey's office on his way home. There they 
met for 20-25 minutes. No one else was present, and 
neither Casey nor Regan took notes. Regan told 
Casey that the Attorney General had informed the 
President that arms sales profits had been diverted to

the Contras. Regan said the White House would an-
nounce it publicly the next day and he asked Casey to 
keep it quiet until then. Casey did not express surprise 
at news of the diversion, but he warned Regan of the 
potential consequences of going public, such as the 
cutoff of Congressional funding for the Contras. 
Casey also said that contacts with Iran would be 
severed when the Iranians realized they had been 
overcharged and the profits diverted. Finally, Casey 
expressed concern about the reaction in the Middle 
East if the Israeli role were revealed.'" 
November 25: The Public Learns of 
the Diversion 
By Tuesday morning, November 25, the Attorney 
General's investigation was largely over. What had 
started as an effort to resolve differing testimony over 
the November 1985 HAWK shipment had led to the 
discovery of an illicit connection between the Iran 
initiative and the secret Contra support activities. Evi-
dence had been destroyed; false statements had been 
made; important questions had been skirted or avoid-
ed. Nevertheless, the secret of the diversion had been 
uncovered. On this day, the American people would 
find out. 
Attorney General Meese's day began with a 6:30 
a.m. call from Casey, whom the Attorney General 
had not yet interviewed about the diversion. Casey 
told the Attorney General that Regan had advised 
him of the diversion, and asked Meese to drive by his 
house on the way to work.'" The Attorney General 
arrived at 6:45 a.m., with Richardson in the car. Rich-
ardson did not go into Casey's house. Richardson 
testified that he never sat in on meetings between 
Casey and the Attorney General.'" Meese once 
again held a crucial meeting without witnesses or 
notes. 
Attorney General Meese testified that, at this meet-
ing, Casey was adamant that the diversion needed to 
be publicly announced as quickly as possible.'" This 
description of Casey's position is substantially differ-
ent from Casey's position the day before when he met 
with Regan." 1 
While the Attorney General was at Casey's house, 
Regan called to speak to him. Regan told the Attor-
ney General he wanted to meet with Poindexter at 
8:00 a.m. to accept Poindexter's resignation.'" 
Meese returned to his car and called Poindexter, 
who was just arriving at the White House. He asked 
Poindexter to meet him at the Department of Justice, 
where they spoke privately for 15 minutes before 
Poindexter met with Regan. The Attorney General 
told Poindexter the time had come to submit his resig-
nation. Poindexter agreed to resign. They then dis-
cussed North's transfer back to the Marine Corps. 
Attorney General Meese told Poindexter he did not 
think North had done anything illegal.'" 
316 
Poindexter returned to the White House and was 
eating breakfast in his office when Regan came in and 
told him to have his resignation ready for the regular 
9:30 a.m. meeting with the President. Regan then 
asked Poindexter how the diversion could have hap-
pened. Poindexter replied he had thought something 
was going on with North. Regan asked why he never 
looked into it; Poindexter replied, according to 
Regan: 
I knew it would hurt the Contras, and the way 
those guys on the Hill are jerking around, . . . I 
was afraid it would hurt them too much, so I 
didn't look into it.174 
In Poindexter's testimony, however, he did not recall 
Regan asking him about the diversion.'" Both Regan 
and Poindexter agree that Regan never asked Poin-
dexter whether the President knew.'" 
Attorney General Meese met briefly with Cooper 
and Richardson.'" He told Cooper that Poindexter 
was going to resign, and instructed Cooper to meet 
with White House Counsel Wallison to draft the 
President's statement. He asked Richardson to have 
Thompson check the White House files to verify that 
no documents mentioning the diversion had actually 
reached the President."78 
Richardson asked Thompson to do a file search of 
all relevant documents that went to the President, and 
the public announcement was delayed pending its 
completion. Thompson returned with some docu-
ments Richardson had not seen before. Richardson 
reviewed the documents provided by Thompson from 
his own and Poindexter's files, including memos re-
garding the arms shipments and the original January 6 
and 17 Findings. Thompson did not explain why he 
had not presented those documents during the initial 
document review the previous Saturday. No PROF 
notes were included. Richardson found nothing perti-
nent to his inquiry. '79 
At 9:30 a.m., the Vice President, Regan, Meese, and 
Poindexter met with the President. Poindexter told 
the President that he was aware of the plan to divert 
funds to the Contras, and he tendered his resignation 
in order to give the President "the necessary latitude 
to do whatever you need to do." 180 The President 
told Poindexter that it was in the tradition of a Naval 
officer to take responsibility. Poindexter then shook 
hands with those present and left. Poindexter testified 
that he did not tell the President that he had actually 
approved the diversion, because matters were in flux 
and he wanted more time to think about it.'81 
After Poindexter left the meeting, those remaining 
discussed North's fate. It was agreed that North 
should be immediately reassigned to the Marine 
Corps. A resignation was not necessary because 
North was not a Presidential appointee. No one in-
formed North that he would be reassigned. He 
learned of it for the first time while watching the

Chapter 20 
President's statement and Meese's press conference on 
television at noon that day.182 
Sometime that morning Poindexter called North 
and, according to North's notes, discussed the disclo-
sure of the Contra connection. North's notes contain a 
reference to "put it off on Ghorbanifar." 183 
At 10:15 a.m. the President met with the National 
Security Council to brief them on developments.'" 
From 11:00 a.m. to noon, the President, Regan, Secre-
tary Shultz, Attorney General Meese, and Casey 
briefed Congressional leaders. Attorney General 
Meese began by telling them about the diversion. 
Meese said North was involved with possibly one or 
two other NSC staff or consultants. The President 
said that this was the only incident of this kind and 
that Poindexter, although not a participant, had 
known of it and had therefore resigned.'" 
House Majority Leader Jim Wright then asked if 
the diversion was done with knowledge or approval 
of anyone in the U.S. Government. Attorney General 
Meese answered that North had approved it. Repre-
sentative Wright asked about Poindexter, and Meese 
responded that Poindexter knew the money was 
going to the Contras but did not know the details. 
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd then asked if 
Poindexter's resignation was requested. The President 
responded that Poindexter volunteered to resign, in 
the Navy tradition.186 
Senator Nunn expressed concern about NSC staff 
involvement in covert operations. The President re-
plied that the NSC staff had served the country well, 
citing the opening to China as an example. Senator 
Nunn replied that he drew a distinction between a 
diplomatic initiative and a covert operation.'" 
Representative Wright then asked if the CIA knew 
of the diversion. Casey responded, "No, I didn't." 
Casey then volunteered that McFarlane learned of the 
diversion in April or May 1986.188 
Representative Wright noted that it strained credu-
lity that the Israelis thought up the diversion on their 
own. Meese explained that there was no question that 
North or others set it up. Senate Majority Leader 
Robert Dole then asked how it was determined there 
was an overcharge for the arms sold. Meese replied 
that the United States got "dollar-for-dollar" for its 
weapons and equipment. He related, however, that 
the exact amount of the diversion was not clear.'" 
Just before the President's announcement, Richard 
Secord received word from North's office that Poin-
dexter and North were resigning. Secord called Poin-
dexter and urged him not to quit but to "stand in 
there and fight" to get it all straightened out. Poin-
dexter told Secord it was too late because he had 
already resigned. Secord demanded to speak to the 
President but Poindexter told him it was too late, 
"they had already built a wall around the Presi-
dent." 190 
November 25, 1986: The Attorney 
General's Press Conference 
The Presidential statement and subsequent press 
conference by the Attorney General began at noon 
and lasted approximately 45 minutes. Attorney Gener-
al Meese began the press conference with a disclaimer 
of sorts, stating that the inquiry was not yet complete 
because "all information was not yet in." Nonetheless, 
his responses contained several purported conclusions. 
Meese was asked how the diversion came to his 
attention. He responded that, through a review of 
reports and other materials, there was a hint that 
some money was available to be used for another 
purpose. He elaborated that the diversion had ac-
counted for some $12 million to $30 million. Meese 
was asked if the CIA knew of the diversion. He 
responded that none of the statutory members of the 
National Security Council knew, including Casey." 
Later, in describing the money flow, Meese said the 
money went directly from the Israelis into bank ac-
counts held by the Contras. This version of events, 
although consistent with North's statements, was con-
tradicted by the diversion memorandum, which de-
scribed how the money would be transferred by the 
Israelis into an account maintained by "a private 
United States corporation" and then transferred to the 
Contras.192 
Meese was asked about arms shipments prior to the 
January 1986 Finding. He responded that there was 
one transaction in which Israel shipped weapons with-
out authorization from the United States, and that the 
weapons so shipped were returned to Israel. Attorney 
General Meese added that the AugustSeptember and 
November 1985 shipments were between Israel and 
Iran and "did not involve, at that time, the United 
States." '93 
Attorney General Meese specifically stated that the 
President had not known about the November 1985 
HAWK shipment until February 1986. Thus the At-
torney General said: The President was informed gen-
erally that there had been an Israeli shipment of 
weapons to Iran sometime during the late summer, 
early fall of 1985, and then he later learned in Febru-
ary of 1986 details about another shipment that had 
taken place in November of 1985, which had actually 
been returned to Israel in February of 1986.1" 
These statements were contrary to what he and 
Cooper had learned regarding CIA participation in 
the November 1985 HAWK shipment and regarding 
McFarlane's conversation with Shultz on November 
18, 1985. Attorney General Meese's statements were 
also contrary to the information Meese had received 
from Secretary Shultz on November 22 that the Presi-
dent had told Shultz 3 days earlier that he (the Presi-
dent) had known of the November 1985 HAWK ship-

ment at the time.195 Attorney General Meese did not 
tell these facts to the press.* 
When asked whether the diverted funds were owed 
to the United States, Meese responded that all money 
owed to the United States had been paid to the 
United States. Meese said, "We have no control over 
that money. It was never United States funds, it was 
never property of the United States officials, so we 
have no control over that whatsoever." 796 Meese 
later testified that a good case could be made that 
such funds were held in "constructive trust" for the 
United States, that is, that all profits reaped belong in 
the U.S. Treasury. '97 
Attorney General Meese also stated at the press 
conference that, to the best of his knowledge, no 
American was present for, or participated in, negotiat-
ing the price of the arms to Iran. Meese's source for 
this statement is also unclear.199 
FBI Director William Webster watched the Attor-
ney General's press conference on television, and 
thereby learned of the diversion. After the press con-
ference, Webster walked across the street to the De-
partment of Justice and told Meese that a criminal 
investigation was warranted. The Attorney General 
stated that he had turned the inquiry over to the 
Criminal Division to determine which, if any, statutes 
were violated.199 Webster then raised the problem of 
securing NSC records. Attorney General Meese as-
sured Webster that the Justice Department would 
take the appropriate steps to secure the records. Web-
ster went back to the FBI and told his Assistant 
Director to gear up for the anticipated investiga-
tion.299 
At approximately 2:00 p.m., Meese met with Burns, 
Reynolds, Cooper, Richardson, and Kenneth Cribb 
(Counselor to the Attorney General). Associate At-
torney General Trott joined them midway through 
the meeting.201 The group discussed possible viola-
tions of laws, including the Boland Amendment, the 
Arms Export Control Act, and the Neutrality Act, 
and possible misappropriation of U. S. funds.202 They 
also discussed involving the Internal Security Section 
of the Criminal Division in the investigation. They 
discussed the possibility of granting immunity, al-
though neither North nor Poindexter had refused to 
talk to the Attorney General. The Attorney General 
instructed Deputy Attorney General Burns to call 
Wallison to ensure that documents belonging to 
North and Poindexter were secured.2" They agreed 
to meet again at 5:45 p.m. 
When they actually did meet, at 6:40 p.m., Meese 
asked Burns if he had secured the White House docu-

lieved that Secretary Shultz should resign for not supporting the 
Iran initiative. Meese stated, "any member of the Administration

ments. Burns indicated he had not done so and left 
the room to make the cal1.2" As it turned out, Burns 
did not get through to Wallison until the next after-
noon, November 26. Wallison told him the documents 
had in fact already been secured by the NSC security 
officer.205 A letter requesting segregation of the doc-
uments was not sent until November 28, 1986, 6 days 
after discovery of the diversion memorandum.2" 
Sometime that afternoon, Secord, after being be-
sieged by the press at his office, went to a hotel to 
consult with Tom Green. North joined them. North 
received two phone calls at the hotel. One was from 
the Vice President calling to express his regrets about 
North's dismissal. The other was from the President. 
North stood at attention while the President spoke to 
him.207 There is some dispute about the substance of 
this conversation. North testified that the President 
told him, "I just didn't know," which North under-
stood to be a reference to the diversion.2" Earl testi-
fied that, when North returned to the office, North 
had told him that the President had called and said, 
"It is important that I not know." 209 North testified 
that perhaps he told Earl that the President felt it was 
important that North know that he, the President, did 
not know of the diversion.21? Craig Coy, who was 
present when North related the Presidential conversa-
tion to Earl, testified that he did not recall North 
saying anything about the President's statements con-
cerning his knowledge.2" Hall testified that North 
told her that President had said, "I just didn't 
know." 212 
There is no dispute, however, that during the 
phone call the President told North that he was "a 
national hero." 273 Indeed, the President has publicly 
acknowledged making this statement.214 
At 4:40 p.m., Meese was called by Israeli Prime 
Minister Peres. The Prime Minister told Meese that 
the Government of Israel was concerned about 
Meese's claims in his press conference and was about 
to issue a statement. Prime Minister Peres said the 
Israelis had transferred "defensive arms" at the re-
quest of the United States. He also told Meese that 
the Israelis had not paid anything to any Contra ac-
count. The Prime Minister explained that the Iranians 
paid directly into an account in Switzerland main-
tained by an American company. He indicated that 
Israel?which had been asked by U.S. officials early 
on to take the rap if the arms sales became public?
was not going to take the blame for the diversion.215 
Amiram Nir made the same point in a call to 
North. North's notes of that call show that Nir com-
plained about Meese's statements and asked what basis 
Meese had for making them. Nir pointed out that, far 
from ever telling him that any funds were diverted, 
North had always told him there was a shortage of 
funds. Indeed, Nir questioned why the Israelis had 
been made to pay for replacement weapons if there 
was an excess of funds. Nir told North he could not

Chapter 20 
back his story. He said that statements made by the 
Attorney General regarding Israeli deposits to Contra 
accounts and other matters were simply false.2" 
At the time of these events on November 25, 
McFarlane was in London for a speaking engage-
ment. He heard a news account of the Attorney Gen-
eral's press conference and, after finishing his speech, 
called North. North told McFarlane he had met with 
the Attorney General and Regan, and, based on that 
meeting, he assumed he would be allowed to resign. 
North said he learned from watching the press confer-
ence on television that he had been "dismissed." 217 
McFarlane had written a statement for the press that 
he read first to North. The statement said that he had 
been led to believe the diversion had been approved. 
North confirmed to McFarlane that the diversion had 
been approved.218 
During the afternoon of November 25, the NSC 
staff secured North's office. In reviewing her files at 
the time, Fawn Hall discovered that she had not 
substituted the copies of the documents she had al-
tered on November 21 for the copies of unaltered 
versions of the documents in North's files. She also 
found PROF notes that were similar to those shred-
ded Friday night, along with minutes of the Tehran 
meeting in May 1986 that she had saved to read. Hall 
knew that the NSC security staff soon would be clos-
ing the office, so she called North and told him to 
come back to the office, indicating to him the urgen-
cy of her request and signalling that it involved a 
problem with documents. North said that he and his 
attorney would come back to the office.219 
Before they arrived, Hall took the documents up-
stairs and placed copies of the altered documents 
inside her boots, inexplicably leaving the originals of 
the altered versions on her desk. She then went to 
Earl's office and solicited his help in pulling the 
PROF notes from he pile of remaining documents. 
Earl was going to put the PROF notes in his jacket, 
but Hall told him she would do it. She then told him 
to watch the open entrance to his office while she hid 
the PROF notes under her clothes. Earl assured her 
that the documents were not visible.220 
North and his attorney then arrived at North's 
office, where North took a phone call in his private 
office with only Hall present. Hall asked North if he 
could detect anything against her back, and he said he 
could not. Hall left the office with North and the 
attorney. Their briefcases were inspected by the NSC 
security staff, and they were allowed to pass. In the 
hallway, Hall indicated to North that she wanted to 
give him the documents. He told her to wait until 
they were outside.221 
Hall, North, and the attorney walked outside. Hall 
made a motion to North (she was planning to pass the 
documents), but the attorney said, according to Hall, 
"No, wait until we get inside the car." Once in the 
car, Hall pulled out the documents, gave them to 
North, and told North that she had not finished sub-
stituting the altered documents for the originals. The 
attorney drove them to their cars and, according to 
Hall, asked her what she would say if asked about the 
shredding. Hall replied that she would say "We shred 
every day," to which the attorney said, "Good." 222 
There is no evidence as to whether the attorney 
knew in advance that Hall had documents on her 
person. That evening, the attorney withdrew from 
North's representation.223 Subsequently, North's new 
attorney returned documents to the NSC. 
November 26: Criminal 
Investigation Underway 
By Wednesday morning, November 26, Meese was 
prepared for the investigation to enter a new phase. 
At 9:15 a.m., he met with Justice Department attor-
neys Burns, Trott, Reynolds, Cooper, Bolton, Cribb, 
Korten, Weld, and Richardson. The Attorney Gener-
al began the meeting by announcing to Weld that this 
was the day for the handoff of the investigation to the 
Criminal Division. Weld said he wanted to assign the 
investigation to two experienced attorneys in the 
Public Integrity Section, which typically handles 
prosecutions of public officials and Independent 
Counsel inquiries.224 Attorney General Meese stated 
he also wanted Deputies Mark Richard and John 
Keeny to participate. 
Attorney General Meese then assigned Cooper as 
an additional member of the prosecution team. Attor-
ney General Meese explained that he wanted to be 
kept informed. Richardson instructed the group that if 
anything came up that was "hot," they were to tell 
the Attorney General immediately.223 However, the 
Attorney General testified before the Tower Board 
that he did not request briefings because he felt this 
case should be referred to an Independent Coun-
se1.228 Attorney General Meese also testified, to the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, that he sug-
gested from the start that an Independent Counsel be 
appointed.227 Yet the relevant Justice Department of-
ficials do not recall when the Attorney General took 
that position.228 In fact, there was much discussion of 
appointing a "special counsel," who, unlike an Inde-
pendent Counsel, would have been under the control 
of the Attorney Genera1.229 
At approximately 11:00 a.m., Meese spoke with 
Webster and requested that the FBI enter the case. At 
2:45 p.m., the Attorney General called a meeting at 
the Justice Department, that included representatives 
of the Criminal Division and the FBI. The Attorney 
General described the weekend inquiry and answered 
questions. The Attorney General also designated the 
criminal investigation team members.23?

November 27: A Thanksgiving 
Phone Call 
November 27 was Thanksgiving. Fawn Hall received 
a telephone call at home from Jay Stephens, an attor-
ney on the White House Counsel's staff.23' Press 
reports had appeared claiming that documents perti-
nent to the Iran-Contra Affair had been shredded at 
the NSC. Stephens asked Hall whether those reports 
were true. Hall told Stephens exactly what she had 
earlier told North's attorney her response would be to 
such a question: "we shred everyday." Hall admitted 
during the public hearings that she misled Stephens to 
believe that nothing unusual had occurred.232 
Final Steps 
The NSC security officer had secured North's office 
on Novmeber 25. The FBI took over joint custody of 
the documents at the NSC on Friday, November 
28.233* 
Also on November 28, Hall went to the office of 
North's new attorney to deliver messages that North 
had received.234 When Hall returned to the NSC, 
Craig Coy introduced her to FBI agents, who asked 
to interview her over the weekend. Hall left her new 
office that evening with NSC aide Robert Earl, and 
they agreed not to tell the FBI about the removal of 
documents from the NSC offices. The next day, after 
learning that Earl had retained an attorney, Hall ar-
ranged for one as wel1.235 
On Monday, December 1, William Reynolds had 
plans to meet alone with Tom Green again. When 
Weld and Richard heard of this, they opposed the 
meeting because Reynolds was no longer supposed to 
be involved in the investigation. They also pointed 
out that Reynolds might be a fact witness and should 
therefore not be negotiating with defense counsel. 
Weld called Reynolds to express his opposition, but 
Reynolds insisted on meeting with Green. He did, 
however, agree to have William Hendricks (Deputy 
Chief of the Public Integrity Section of the Justice 
Department) present. Weld consulted with Trott, who 
said that so long as Hendricks was present, the situa-
tion should be "survivable." ** 
'Mark Richard had advocated serving subpoenas on the NSC 
staff and others. His concern was that, if documents were altered or 
destroyed, a prosecutor might be unable to charge obstruction of 
justice because the defendant could claim that he or she was not 
aware of any investigation and therefore did not intend to obstruct 
justice. Richard Dep., 8/19/87, at 176-77. Indeed, as noted earlier, 
during their public hearing testimony, both North and Poindexter 
made a point of saying they believed Meese was acting as a friend 
of, or counselor to, the President, as opposed to acting as Attorney 
General, during the factfinding inquiry. North Test., Hearings 100-
7, Part I, 7/7/87, at 19; Poindexter Test., Hearings, 100-8, 7/16/87, 
at 133. 
"Weld Dep., 7/16/87, at 40. Reynolds, however, maintains that 
he never intended to meet with Green alone and that it was he who 
320 
During the meeting, Green said he knew 93 percent 
of the story and did not feel the President would be 
embarrassed if the whole truth came out. Green made 
clear now that he represented Secord. Green said that 
Secord preferred to tell his story to the Justice De-
partment rather than to Congress.236 
Green wanted immunity for Secord. He argued that 
if the Justice Department did not grant immunity and 
Secord's story did not come out, the press would feed 
on the situation and create the suspicion that the 
President and Regan knew more than they claimed 
they did.2 3 7 
Reynolds and Hendricks asked Green about the 
1985 arms shipments. Green responded that the Presi-
dent authorized the first shipment and that McFarlane 
probably authorized the second shipment. Turning to 
the January 1986 Finding, Green said it was broad 
enough to authorize the "commercial activity in this 
enterprise." 238 
Going back to the November 1985 shipment, Green 
said McFarlane did not impart to others the truth 
about the cargo. He said CIA "subordinates" were 
told the cargo was oil drilling equipment.236 Con-
cerning the Contra resupply operation, Green said 
that only unappropriated funds were used and that 
private individuals were used to raise and collect 
money to support the airlift operation.24? 
Hendricks asked Green about the possibility that 
the U.S. sale of arms was used as leverage against 
third countries to force them to send money to the 
Contras. Green said he knew nothing of that. Green 
said that the residuals to the Contras were an "unex-
pected result" that emerged from the arms sales, 
rather than being "cooked up" by the operation.241 
Hendricks suggested that because Secord was such 
a "great American," he should come forward without 
immunity. Green rejected that idea. Hendricks re-
sponded that there were problems in granting Secord 
immunity, and noted the prior criminal investigation 
against Secord. 2 4 2 
Reynolds asked how many people Green thought 
should be immunized. Green said it should be limited 
to Secord, North, and Hakim. Green said he could 
secure the approval of Hakim's and North's lawyers. 
Green assured them that he did not want to embarrass 
the President and was not trying to "snooker" 
anyone. 243 
Hendricks noted that it would be inappropriate to 
immunize anyone while there was an ongoing prelimi-
nary inquiry for an Independent Counsel appointment. 
Green asserted that Secord, North, and Hakim were 
not covered under the law that grants jurisdiction to 
the Independent Counsel. Green predicted that if an 
Independent Counsel were appointed, all the princi-
insisted that someone from the Criminal Division be present. Reyn-
olds Dep., 9/1/87, at 67.

pals would "clam up." Green noted that time was of 
the essence. The meeting ended at 12:15 p.m.244 
At 2:20 p.m., Meese met with Burns, Cooper, 
Bolton, Cribb, Weld, Hendricks, and Richard to dis-
cuss the investigation. This meeting focused on 
whether to apply for an Independent Counsel. There 
was concern that North and Poindexter might not be 
persons covered by the Independent Counsel statute. 
The consensus, however, was that sufficient evidence 
of a conflict of interest existed that the Justice De-
partment should apply for an Independent Counsel. 
Weld took it upon himself to draft the application that 
night. Weld mentioned only North in the application 
as a possible target because he felt there were insuffi-
cient facts to name others.245 
On December 19, an Independent Counsel was ap-
pointed.

Chapter 21 
Introduction to the Enterprise 
By the summer of 1986, the organization that Richard 
Secord ran at Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's direction 
controlled five aircraft, including C-123 and C-7 
transports.1 It had an airfield in one country, ware-
house facilities at an airbase in another, a stockpile of 
guns and military equipment to drop by air to the 
Contras, and secure communications equipment ob-
tained by North from the National Security Agency 
(NSA). 2 
Flying the planes were veteran pilots and crew, 
many experienced in covert operations. At any given 
time, about 20 airmen were paid consultants to a 
Panamanian corporation formed by Secord and 
Albert Hakim at North's direction; their salaries were 
paid from secret Swiss accounts controlled by Secord 
and Hakim.9 
In Robert Dutton, a recently retired U.S. Air Force 
lieutenant colonel, the organization had an expert in 
special operations.4 Dutton was reporting to an NSC 
official, Oliver North, and a retired Air Force gener-
al, Richard Secord, both of whom indicated that the 
operation was authorized by the President of the 
United States.5 This private air force was but a part 
of the organization that Secord and Hakim called the 
"Enterprise." 
This part of the Report explores the activities of 
the Enterprise and addresses questions such as: Where 
did the Enterprise get the money? How did it spend 
it? Who profited? What amount of the Iranian arms 
sales proceeds was spent on the Contras (the so-called 
"diversion")? What happened to the $10 million that 
Brunei contributed? What other covert operations did 
the Enterprise conduct or plan? 
Witnesses testifying before the Committees could 
not easily define the Enterprise. To Hakim, Secord's 
partner, the Enterprise was a covert organization with 
a chain of command headed by North; it was also a 
business with a chain of Swiss accounts that he set up 
and partially owned.6 Secord first described the En-
terprise as the group of offshore companies that car-
ried out the Iran and Contra operations, but later 
testified that it was fair to describe the Enterprise as 
his own covert operations organization formed at the 
request of North and Poindexter to carry out all of 
the operations described in his testimony.7 Secord 
declared that he "exercised overall control" over the 
Enterprise, but acknowledged that he depended upon 
North's support.9 
North described Secord's network of offshore com-
panies as a private commercial organization, but he 
also stated that it was the starting point for the cre-
ation of an organization that would conduct activities 
similar to those of the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA), including counterterrorism.9 Poindexter never 
defined the Enterprise, but stated that he found attrac-
tive the idea of a "private organization properly ap-
proved, using nonappropriated funds in an approved 
sort of way." o 
Secord consistently turned to the same group of 
individuals in order to accomplish the tasks that 
North assigned to him. Albert Hakim, an Iranian-born 
American citizen, was his partner and, by agreement, 
Secord and Hakim were to share equally in any En-
terprise profits. Hakim controlled the Enterprise's 
bank accounts." Rafael Quintero, a Cuban exile for-
merly associated with the CIA, handled the logistics 
of arms deliveries from various locations in Central 
America." Glenn Robinette, a former CIA officer-
turned-consultant, investigated those who made accu-
sations about operations of the Enterprise and per-
formed other tasks, among them, installation of a se-
curity system at North's residence.13 Thomas Clines, 
a former CIA official-turned-investor and consultant, 
served as the primary broker for the Enterprise's arms 
transactions.' 4 
The relationships were not new. Secord had been in 
contact with the group throughout his career; appar-
ently he trusted these individuals and they trusted 
him." Secord, as an Air Force officer, and Clines, as 
a CIA officer, worked together in the late 1960s when 
both were assigned to the CIA station in Laos, and 
developed a close relationship.16 
When Secord returned from Laos he was stationed 
at the Pentagon. Clines took the opportunity to intro-
duce him to a number of Clines' CIA associates, in-
cluding Quintero.17 Clines also introduced Secord to 
Edwin Wilson, a former CIA officer who had become 
enormously successful in international business deal-
ings." In the mid 1970s, Secord was stationed in Iran

given, an interest in one of Hakim's companies and 
Wilson became "acquainted" with Hakim's "Iranian 
operations." 20 Hakim's Iranian operations included, 
among other things, an effort to sell electronic intelli-
gence systems to the Iranian Government.2' The op-
erations also involved payoffs to Iranian Air Force 
and Army Generals through "bearer letters" and 
numbered Swiss accounts.22 Hakim and Secord 
claimed that they first met on unfriendly terms in 
1976 or 1977 when Secord recommended against a 
contract that Hakim proposed to the Iranian Govern-
ment. 2 3 
After Secord returned from Iran, his relationship 
with Wilson became more involved.24 In 1981, 
Secord and Clines became subjects of a Department 
of Justice conflict-of-interest and bribery investigation 
stemming from their relationship with Wilson. In ad-
dition, in 1982, Clines became a target of a Depart-
ment of Justice investigation concerning fraudulent 
overbillings of the U.S. Government by the Egyptian 
American Transport Company (EATSCO), 49 per-
cent of which was owned by Clines.25 
Secord retired from the Air Force in May 1983 
because the Wilson story and the ongoing Justice 
Department investigation had placed a cloud over his 
military career." Two months later, EATSCO plead-
ed guilty to criminal and civil overbilling charges. 
Clines, on behalf of the corporate entity that held his 
328 
49 percent interest, paid a $10,000 criminal fine and a 
$100,000 civil fine as part of the settlement. In July 
1984 the Justice Department closed the EATSCO 
case and in January 1986, it closed the conflict-of-
interest and bribery investigation of Secord and 
Clines.27 No indictments or other prosecutorial action 
followed. 
Hakim kept in communication with Secord after 
Secord left Iran. When Hakim learned that Secord 
was considering retirement, he tried to recruit Secord 
as a partner to revive his security sales company, 
Expantrade. By offering security systems to foreign 
governments, Hakim believed that "you have a deep 
penetration in that government and therefore you can 
do a lot of business." 28 
Secord agreed with the concept and in May 1983, 
immediately upon his retirement, joined Hakim. 
Secord became Hakim's equal partner in a new com-
pany, Stanford Technology Trading Group Interna-
tional (STTGI), headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, 
outside of Washington, D.C. STTGI, relying on Se-
cord's contacts, tried to develop contracts in the secu-
rity field in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere." In 1984, 
when North recruited Secord to help with arms 
supply to the Contras, Hakim and Secord found a 
major project that would steadily grow more com-
plex?as the ensuing chapter shows.3?

Chapter 22 
The Enterprise 
Almost $48 million flowed into the Enterprise. It 
came from contributions directed to the Enterprise by 
North from Carl "Spitz" Channell and Richard 
Miller, third countries, and others. It came from the 
sales of arms to the Contras and missiles to Iran. It 
came from the sale of weapons to the CIA. The total 
would have been at least $10 million greater had the 
Brunei contribution not been misdirected. 
All of the Enterprise's money went into Swiss bank 
accounts managed by an expert in handling money, 
Willard Zucker, and was protected by the world's 
most stringent secrecy laws. But the Enterprise did 
not rely solely on Swiss law to preserve the confiden-
tiality of its operation. Zucker created a maze of com-
panies through which money could be passed without 
trace. The corporate operations of the Enterprise 
were befitting of its covert charter. 
One of the main objectives of the Committees was 
to penetrate this secrecy?to find out where the 
money came from, and where it went; and thus, to 
learn about the operations and organization of the 
Enterprise. 
In the financial records of the Enterprise, the Com-
mittees found that: 
?The plan?which North attributed to Casey?to 
create a worldwide private covert operation organiza-
tion, with significant financial resources, was being 
implemented through a network of offshore compa-
nies administered in Switzerland. 
?The Enterprise took in nearly $48 million during 
its first 2 years. Its income-generating capacity came 
almost entirely from its access to U.S. Government 
resources and connections: the contributions directed 
to it by North, the missiles sold to Iran, and the 
brokering of arms to the Contras as arranged by 
North. 
?The Enterprise generated a substantial amount of 
its income from the sale of arms to Iran. Before its 
operations came to a halt, the Enterprise managed to 
divert at least $3.8 million from the Iran arms sale 
profits to the Contras. 
?The Enterprise spent almost $35.8 million. It used 
its resources to finance covert operations not reported 
to Congress as required by law and, in some in-
stances, not disclosed to the President. 
?The income of the Enterprise exceeded its ex-
penditures by $12.2 million. 
?Secord, Hakim, and Clines took self-determined 
"commissions" from the $12.2 million surplus to 
reward themselves for their work on arms deliveries 
to the Contras and the CIA. The commissions totaled 
approximately $4.4 million, with an average markup 
of about 38 percent over the cost of the arms?not 20 
percent as asserted by Secord. 
?Contrary to their testimony that they only took 
"commissions" out of the Enterprise accounts, Hakim 
and Secord also took approximately $2.2 million from 
the $12.2 million surplus for personal business ven-
tures and personal use. One of these business ventures 
involved plans to sell weapons to the Contras at sub-
stantial profits; another called for the sale of weapons 
to Iran. 
?$5.6 million of the $12.2 million surplus was left 
in Enterprise accounts managed in Switzerland when 
the Enterprise ceased its operations in November, 
1986. An additional $2.2 million from earlier commis-
sion payments and profit distributions remained in 
separate accounts managed in Switzerland for the 
benefit of the individual members of the Enterprise. 
In the following seven sections, the Committees 
describe these findings in detail. The first section de-
scribes the Enterprise's records and explains the net-
work of companies and bank accounts through which 
the Enterprise operated. The second traces the 
sources of the Enterprise's funds and North's role in 
generating them. The third describes the Enterprise's 
expenditures. The fourth examines the diversion. The 
fifth shows what happened to the "surplus," the 
excess ($12.2 million) of revenues over expenditures, 
and discusses Hakim's efforts to pass money to North. 
The sixth section describes where the Enterprise 
funds are now, and the seventh tells the story of what 
happened to the misdirected Brunei contribution.

Chapter 22 
Section 1: The Swiss Connection, 
the Secret Accounts and 
Companies, and the Covert Charter 
The Swiss Connection 
The Enterprise's records were maintained by Com-
pagnie de Services Fiduciaries (CSF). CSF is a Swiss 
fiduciary company,' owned and administered on a 
daily basis by Willard I. Zucker, a U.S. citizen and 
former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) lawyer who 
has resided in Switzerland for 20 years.2 CSF estab-
lishes tax haven offshore companies to hold the funds 
of its clients, satisfying the necessary formalities and 
keeping the books. It also accepts its clients' funds, 
keeping them in its name with a bank or investment 
house. 
A Swiss fiduciary company has no exact counter-
part in the United States. The client employing a 
Swiss fiduciary such as CSF?which uses Panamanian 
or Liberian companies, Swiss bank accounts, and off-
shore trust accounts?buys a triple layer of secrecy, a 
formidable barrier against identification of the loca-
tion of money.3 
Starting in 1971, Zucker provided banking-type 
services to Hakim.4 The Zucker-Hakim relationship 
continued into the 1980s; thus, Zucker's services were 
available when Secord became Hakim's partner in 
1983. As early as June 1984, Zucker visited the 
United States and met with Secord about a Hakim-
Secord business project that involved supplying mili-
tary equipment to an unnamed resistance group.3 
Zucker was a discreet, efficient, and rapid channel 
for moving money. By merely telephoning Zucker in 
Switzerland, Hakim, and later Secord,6 could order 
the movement of funds from Swiss bank accounts to 
the destination of their choice without a paper trace 
to either of them. With bank accounts in international 
tax havens and financial centers, CSF would simply 
issue a check from the most appropriate location.7 
When necessary, Hakim could direct Zucker to set up 
a new Swiss bank account and an offshore shell com-
pany to act as the nominal owner of the account. If 
Secord or Hakim wanted $50,000 in cash that could 
not be traced to a Swiss account, Zucker could ar-
range for that, too; Zucker would call upon business 
associates and other U.S. contacts to provide the cash 
and Zucker, in turn, would reimburse his sources.8 
Thus, Zucker?who had a license to practice law in 
the United States, all the powers of a Swiss fiduciary, 
an inside knowledge of the IRS, and experience in 
meeting the needs of clients such as Hakim?was a 
covert operator's model banker, accountant, lawyer, 
and money manager. 
The Secret Records 
Zucker kept track of Enterprise funds on a series of 
ledgers, referred to herein as the CSF Ledgers. After 
332 
being granted limited use immunity, Hakim provided 
the Committees with copies of the CSF Ledgers for 
the period from December 1984 until May 1986. 
Hakim also provided the Committees with copies of 
certain supporting documentation, including bank 
statements from Swiss banks, bank wire transfer 
records, incorporation documents, and fiduciary 
agreements. 
For the most part, accountants for the Committees 
were able to verify the data contained in the CSF 
ledgers provided by Hakim. Methods employed in-
cluded extensive analysis of the Swiss banking records 
provided by CSF through Hakim, corroboration by 
independent third parties, and analysis of relevant 
documentation obtained from banks in the United 
States.? 
Zucker maintained three types of ledgers for the 
Enterprise. A "General Ledger" showed expenditures 
and receipts for each of the Enterprise's companies. 
"Capital Ledgers" tracked the distributions from En-
terprise bank accounts to several individuals, includ-
ing Hakim, Secord, and Clines. "Fiduciary ledgers" 
accounted for funds held by CSF (in its own bank 
accounts) in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the 
Enterprise and various individuals, including Secord 
and Hakim.1? 
Secord and Hakim testified that they reviewed 
parts of the CSF Ledgers on several occasions. They 
were thus able to keep track of Enterprise income, 
expenditures, and "capital" distributions (which 
Zucker called profit distributions), despite the com-
plexity of the banking structure." 
The Covert Charter 
North testified that as early as 1984 Casey wanted 
to establish an offshore entity capable of conducting 
operations in furtherance of U.S. foreign policy that 
was "stand-alone"?financially independent of appro-
priated funds and, in turn, Congressional oversight." 
During the first half of 1985, the Enterprise simply 
purchased arms and resold them to the Contras at a 
profit, which was distributed to its partners. It had no 
continuing assets of its own and conducted no oper-
ations apart from selling arms to the Contras. During 
this period, North steered contributions from Country 
2 to accounts controlled by Contra leader Adolfo 
Calero in Miami. Calero transferred over $11 million 
to an Enterprise company named Energy Resources, 
Inc.' 3 Energy Resources paid approximately $9 mil-
lion for arms which were delivered to the Contras, 
and the profit of over $2 million was distributed to 
Secord, Hakim and Clines. 
Starting in July of 1985, however, the donations 
raised by North were no longer sent to Calero's ac-
count, but were sent directly to accounts of the En-
terprise. Using these funds, the Enterprise then begun 
to take shape as the "stand-alone" self-financed entity 
capable of conducting covert actions for the U.S.

Chapter 22 
Government which Casey, according to North, had 
envisioned. In April and mid-May 1985, three new 
companies were established: Lake Resources, Gulf 
Marketing, and Udall Research Corp; and in Septem-
ber 1985, Albon Values and Dolmy Inc. were added 
to the roster." Most of the funds from Energy were 
eventually moved to Lake. Lake became the funnel 
for contributions to the expanded Enterprise organiza-
tion. 
As the network of companies and accounts grew, 
North asked Secord to produce a chart setting forth 
the organization of the Enterprise as envisioned by 
Casey. As North put it: 
A: Director Casey had in mind, as I understood 
it, an overseas entity that was capable of con-
ducting operations or activities of assistance to 
U.S. foreign policy goals that was a stand-
alone?
Q: Self-financed? 
A: That was self-financing, independent of appro-
priated monies and capable of conducting activi-
ties similar to the ones that we had conducted 
here. . . . 
Q: Did I understand you to say . . . that the 
chart that you had drawn by Hakim, which is 
Exhibit [OLN] 328, was a chart to reflect that 
concept? 
A: . . . that chart was something that I had 
asked General Secord for. 
Q: Was it intended to reflect the concept as de-
scribed by Director Casey? 
A: Yes.' 5 
Hakim testified that in February 1986, with the 
assistance of CSF, he had the chart drawn on a com-
puter and then gave it to Secord." (See figure 22-1) 
The chart was the blueprint for the off-the-shelf 
covert organization that Casey envisioned. It depicts 
three types of companies: collecting companies, treas-
ury companies, and operating companies (collectively 
the "Enterprise Companies"). Hakim stated that the 
idea was that each collecting company would serve as 
the sole receiver of funds for the Enterprise for a 
period of time. When the first collecting company 
became too visible it could be cast aside and the next 
company would be taken off the "shelf" and brought 
into use. Thus, secrecy would be preserved." 
The treasury companies show the global scope of 
the plan. Each treasury company was responsible for 
holding funds for operations in a distinct region of the 
world: South America, the Middle East, and 
Africa." Africa was included because, according to 
Hakim, Secord said?allegedly in jest?"who knows, 
if we do a good job, the President may send us to 
Angola."19 
Each of the regional treasury companies, Hakim 
explained, would supply funds to "operating compa-
nies" within their respective regions. Each operating 
company would perform specific operations, and thus, 
the exposure of any single company would not bring 
down the entire network. For example, Toyco was to 
be used for the purchase and sale of weapons?euphe-
mistically called "toys"?for the Contras, while Udall 
was to be used to run the air resupply operations.2? 
The final element of the chart, the section for re-
serves marked with an "R," reflects the plan for con-
tinuing operations?the essential ingredient for an 
"off-the-shelf," "self-sustaining" organization. Hakim 
stated that the "R" stood for the "Reserves" that 
were to hold the capital necessary for the Enterprise 
to become self-sufficient." Appropriately, the chart 
provides that the reserves would be held by CSF 
Investments Ltd., the Bermuda branch of CSF that 
invests and manages funds of CSF clients.22 
The financial records of the Enterprise show that 
Hakim and Secord attempted to follow the frame-
work set forth in the chart. Time pressures, however, 
sometimes led to the use of a company for a different 
purpose from the one intended.23 
Lake Resources served as the collecting company 
for the Enterprise starting in the summer of 1985.24 
Gulf Marketing was supposed to replace Lake as a 
collecting company when Lake became too visible. 
But these plans were interrupted by the exposure of 
the Iran initiative in November and the closing down 
of the entire Enterprise. 
Gulf did serve, however, as an intermediate ac-
count through which funds were passed to operating 
companies.23 Dolmy was never put into use as a 
collecting, company; rather, when the orders came 
from North to purchase a ship for a covert operation, 
Hakim pulled Dolmy off the shelf because he did not 
have another operating entity available. He explained: 
I was always hit with surprises. These surprises 
created a lot of headache and difficulty in the 
total system, gave a lot of difficulty to CSF and 
its staff. The requirement was to purchase a ship. 
They wanted things done always yesterday. 
There was not enough time." 
In Central America, where activity was the most 
intense, the Enterprise fully developed the network of 
companies set forth on the blueprint. Albon Values, 
the Central American treasury company, directed $4.3 
million of its funds to two Central American operat-
ing companies: Toyco S.A. and Udall Research Cor-
poration. 2 7 Performing their operational roles, 
Toyco28 purchased arms for the Contras and made 
payments to Contra leaders, while Udall, among other 
things, bought and operated the aircraft for the resup-
ply operation. Udall also leased land in Costa Rica,

where it built an emergency airstrip for the aircraft 
dropping supplies in Nicaragua." 
In short order, Zucker could create or dissolve a 
corporation as circumstances required. When the air-
strip was publicly denounced by the newly-elected 
government in Costa Rica, and it was revealed that 
Udall owned the airstrip and that "Olmstead" was its 
agent, North wrote to Poindexter: 
[Last night, the Minister of Costa Rica an-
nounced that] authorities had discovered a secret 
airstrip . . . which had been built and used by a 
Co. called Udall Services for supporting the Con-
tras . . . . Damage assessment: Udall Resources, 
Inc. SA, is a proprietary of Project Democracy 
[North's euphemism for the Enterprise]. It will 
cease to exist by noon today. There are no USG 
fingerprints on any of the operations and Olm-
stead is not the name of the agent?Olmstead 
does not exist.3? 
Hyde Park Square served as a switching point be-
tween the Iranian and Contra operations. Beginning 
on April 17, 1986, proceeds from the Iranian transac-
tions were moved through Lake into Hyde Park 
Square, and then transferred to other accounts for the 
Contras and other covert operations. As a result, 
Hyde Park Square, shown on the chart as a Middle 
East treasury company, also became a collecting com-
pany that fed other accounts." 
Hakim and Secord also carried out the last step of 
the chart: the creation of "Reserves" totaling $4.2 
million. As contemplated in the chart, the Reserves 
were held by CSF Investments Limited, Zucker's 
Bermuda subsidiary. Like a brokerage house, CSF 
Ltd. invested the Reserves in short-term deposits and 
in stocks. Pursuant to a written agreement, CSF was 
required to invest and spend the money in any 
manner directed by Hakim.32 The Reserves are dis-
cussed in greater detail below, as is a special compa-
ny, Defex SA, that does not show up on Hakim's 
chart. 
Section 2: Income Generation 
Table 22-1 and Figure 22-2 summarize the sources of 
the Enterprise income, from December 1984 to De-
cember 1986. 
The details of each of these income-raising efforts 
are set forth in other chapters of this Report. The 
summary here demonstrates that every single source 
of Enterprise income involved North and the use of 
U.S. Government resources. Indeed, Secord flatly ac-
knowledged this connection.33 
Initially, North arranged for Calero to receive con-
tributions and to purchase arms from Secord.34 Later, 
the Enterprise received Contra contributions directly 
and used them to buy arms for the Contras." Then

' Poindexter and North agreed to use the Enterprise as 
the agent for the Iranian initiative," with North pric-
ing the sales at a markup that generated excess funds 
for the Contra resupply operation and other Enter-
prise activities.37 Through a conduit, the CIA became 
a source of funds for the Enterprise when it pur-
chased weapons originally destined for the Contras." 
Indeed, North tried to get the CIA to provide more: 
When the Boland Amendment expired and Congres-
sional funding for the Contras resumed, he tried to 
persuade the CIA to purchase the Enterprise's aircraft 
and airstrip." The only money the Enterprise was 
able to earn on its own was about $254,000 in invest-
ment income on the money that came from its U.S. 
Government connections. 
North helped generate the Enterprise's revenues, 
and, in turn, Secord and Hakim accommodated 
North's requests for funds and services. At North's 
request, the Enterprise bought a ship, sent radios to a 
foreign political party, and provided money to Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents for a 
covert operation.4? Hakim testified that, as a result of 
these kinds of demands, he was not sure who was 
making the decisions about the use of the Enterprise's 
funds?North acting as an official of the U.S. Gov-
ernment, or he and Secord.41 As Hakim put it: "who-
ever designed this structure, had a situation that they 
could have their cake and eat it too. Whichever they 
wanted to have, a private organization, it was private; 
when they didn't want it to be a private organization 
it wasn't.,42

The Cash Balances 
The Enterprise companies built up substantial cash 
balances, which totaled almost $5.5 million by the 
time the operations came to a halt in December 
1986.43 Table 22-2 summarizes the ending monthly 
cash balances for the Enterprise companies and the 
Reserves. Hakim testified that he understood that 
North wanted a pool of funds available in Switzerland 
for the Contras and any other purpose he might des-
ignate.44 Secord testified that he was "generating 
money to keep the Enterprise going."'" Later, in an 
interview, he elaborated: 
The majority of the money was in [the Enterprise 
accounts] to provide operating capital for a very, 
very large enterprise which owned a ship, and 
which was preparing to buy a two million dollar 
707, and which was preparing to set up perma-
nent headquarters in Europe for a joint Iranian-
American commercial venture.4 6

Chapter 22 
When asked about the cash balances, North testified 
that Casey wanted the Enterprise to become a self-
sustaining operation so that "there [would] always be 
something there which you could reach out and 
grab . . . at a moment's notice."47 But North also 
said that he was surprised by the size of the balance, 
adding, "I am not willing at this point to accuse 
anybody?"48 He also acknowledged that he had been 
told in September 1986?even though the cash bal-
ances were then approximately $5.3 million?about a 
shortage of money available for the Second Channel 
Iranian initiative.49 
Throughout 1985 and the first half of 1986, Enter-
prise cash surpluses, including the Reserves, were in-
creasing. They reached their height in May 1986. As 
of May 1, 1986, the funds in the accounts of the 
collecting companies, treasury companies, operating 
companies (collectively the "Enterprise companies") 
and the Reserves, contained approximately $10.8 mil-
lion. 
In October 1986, at the same time New York busi-
nessman Roy Furmark was threatening to expose the 
initiative if the Iran arms financiers were not paid, 
the Enterprise companies and the Reserves still had a 
total cash balance in the vicinity of $6.1 million. 
Central American Expenditures 5 ? 
In the beginning, the Enterprise simply sold arms to 
the Contras. Its Contra arms-brokering operation?
complete with an offshore company and an offshore 
account?was only the first stage for the full-service 
covert organization that, according to North, Casey 
envisioned.5' 
From December 1984 through July 1985, Calero 
transferred $11.3 million to Secord.52 Secord used the 
money to provide five arms shipments, described by 
Secord as Phases I through IV (one of the five ship-
ments was a supplement to a previous one).53 Secord 
spent a total of $9.4 million for the arms he sold to 
Calero, including transportation costs; however, the 
total cost?including commissions for Secord, Hakim, 
and Clines?exceeded $11.3 million; the shortfall was 
made up with other Enterprise funds, including dona-
tions from the private fund-raising network.54 
From February until May 1986, the Enterprise pur-
chased approximately $3.1 million of military equip-
ment from Defex, a Portuguese arms supplier.55 It 
delivered some of the arms, paid for largely by the 
Iranian weapon sales and third-country contributions, 
in three airlifts which took place in March, April, and 
May 1986 (described by Secord as phases V through 
VII).56 Additional arms purchased during the same 
338 
period (the "stranded shipment") never reached the 
Contras.57 
In addition, the Enterprise spent approximately $5.9 
million for air resupply operations, which had been 
planned by North, Secord, Clines, and Quintero in 
July 1985. It acquired an air force, purchasing two C-
123 cargo aircraft, two Caribou aircraft, and three 
Maule aircraft.58 
More than $1.5 million (out of the $5.9 million) was 
transferred by the Enterprise to various vendors 
through Amalgamated Commercial Enterprises 
(ACE), a Panamanian company established by Rich-
ard Gadd to pay for the Caribous, air crews and other 
expenses associated with the resupply operation. Ac-
cording to Gadd, he was originally told by Secord 
that he, Gadd, would own the aircraft through ACE, 
but Secord later changed his mind and the Enterprise 
retained ownership through its Udall Corporation." 
Operating the airplanes was expensive: the Enter-
prise paid Corporate Air Services a total of $437,688, 
directly and indirectly, for the crews used in the 
resupply operation. Southern Air Transport received 
approximately $2 million for aircraft spare parts, fuel, 
and other services in connection with the resupply 
operation.6? Eagle Aviation Services and Technolo-
gy, Inc. (EAST), another Gadd company, received 
$657,804 for providing other air services." 
David Walker, a British expert in guerrilla warfare 
recruited by North, received $110,000 for his services 
on May 5, 1986.62 Secord noted that during the July 
meeting in Miami it was decided that the resistance 
needed "to get into some of the urban areas." 63 
North testified that in 1985, he authorized Walker to 
perform military operations "in Managua and else-
where in an effort to improve the perception that the 
Nicaraguan resistance could operate anywhere that it 
so desired."64 Later, Walker provided two techni-
cians to help carry out a military operation in Nicara-
gua.65 Secord and Hakim testified that in 1986 
Walker provided air crews for the resupply oper-
ation.66 
The Enterprise acquired land for an airstrip in 
Costa Rica for a down payment of $125,000 and a 
purchase money mortgage of $4,875,000. A Central 
American contractor who constructed the airfield, re-
ceived payments totaling $192,233 from February 
through July 1986.67 
The Enterprise disbursed funds to a number of 
Contra leaders. It paid $50,000, $155,000, and $59,500, 
respectively, to three Contra leaders, and $400,000 to 
Calero and his broker for food supplies and other 
expenses." North may have had even more complex 
plans for payments to the Contras." Figure 22-4 
summarizes expenditures related to the Contras.

The Mideast: Expenditures for the Iran 
Operations 70 
The Enterprise was involved in every NSC-con-
nected shipment of weapons to Iran from November 
1985 on. The net surplus generated by these transac-
tions for the benefit of the Enterprise was $16.1 mil-
lion. 
The first transaction, the Israeli November 1985 
HAWK shipment, generated a net surplus of 
$850,317. The transaction began when an Israeli inter-
mediary deposited $1,000,000 into the Lake Resources 
account on November 20, 1985. Eighty Israeli owned 
HAWKs were to be transported by the Enterprise to 
Iran in four separate shipments. Only 18 HAWKs 
were delivered, however, before the Iranians termi-
nated the transaction. The Enterprise incurred charter 
expenses of $127,700 for the delivery of the 18 
HAWKs, and $21,983 for a private jet for Secord. 
This left the Enterprise with $850,317. According to 
Secord, the Israelis told North that the extra money 
could be used for "whatever purpose we wanted."71 
After discussing the matter with North, Secord 
agreed to use the money for the Contras and testified 
that he did so.72 
The Enterprise's role in the next transaction?the 
sale of the 1,000 TOWs in February?was more 
active. The Enterprise was the "commercial cut-out" 
for the CIA, receiving the money for the missiles 
from Ghorbanifar, paying the CIA for them, and de-
livering them to Iran. The net surplus from this trans-
action was approximately $5.5 million. As it did with 
the Calero arms sales, the Enterprise received pay-
ment to cover the cost of the arms before the arms 
were purchased. Between February 7 and 18, 1986, 
Khashoggi (who was financing Ghorbanifar) trans-
ferred a total of $10 million to the Lake Resources 
account for the shipment. On February 10 and 11, 
Secord directed a total payment of $3.7 million to the 
CIA for the TOWs. In addition, payments totaling 
$484,000 were made to Southern Air for the delivery 
of missiles from the United States to Israel; one pay-
ment of $185,000 was made to the Israeli Ministry of 
Defense to transport the TOWs from Israel to Iran; 
another payment of $100,000 was made to the Israeli 
Ministry of Defense for other related activities; and 
$31,500 was paid to an Israeli bank for miscellaneous 
expenses. 
The Enterprise's role was the same in the third 
transaction?the deliveries of the HAWK replacement 
parts to Iran in May and August 1986, and the ship-
ment of TOWs to Israel to replenish the TOWs sold 
to Iran in September 1985. The net surplus from this 
transaction was approximately $8.3 million. 
Khashoggi financed the May transaction for Ghor-
banifar, transferring $15 million to the Lake Re-
sources account on May 14 and 16, 1986, for the 
HAWK parts. On May 15 and 16, the Israeli Ministry 
of Defense transferred a total of $1,685,000 to the 
Lake Resources account for the TOWs." After Kha-
shoggi's first payment was received, Secord directed 
the Enterprise to pay $6.5 million to the CIA to 
cover the cost of the HAWK spare parts and the 
TOWs. In order to pay for the delivery of the 
HAWK parts, the TOWs, and McFarlane's trip to 
Iran, the Enterprise paid $667,000 to Southern Air 
and $447,250 to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. 
Dutton received $40,000 to cover the cost of the 
crew and other expenses on the Israel-to-Iran leg of 
the mission. Secord also appears to have received 
$260,000 which was apparently related to the Iran 
transactions.74 
Finally, the Enterprise paid $205,015 for expenses 
of chartering corporate aircraft for Secord and North 
in connection with their negotiations with the Irani-
ans. 
The fourth and final transaction consisted of the 
shipment of 500 TOWs from U.S. stocks to Iran 
through the Second Channel. The net surplus was 
$1.4 million. The Second Channel advanced $3.6 mil-
lion to Hyde Park Square on October 29, 1986, for 
the TOWs. Hyde Park, in turn, paid the CIA 
$2,037,000 for the missiles and incurred other ex-
penses aggregating $161,240. 
Worldwide Projects 
The Enterprise's expenditures were not limited to 
Central America and the Middle East. In May 1986, 
North directed Secord to purchase a ship for other 
covert operations. Accordingly, the Enterprise spent 
$743,409 on the purchase and operation of a Danish 
vessel named the Erria." 
North directed a project with DEA agents to try to 
free certain hostages which contemplated paying 
bribes and, indirectly, a $2 million ransom to their 
captors. North turned to businessman and philanthro-
pist H. Ross Perot, who agreed to provide $2 million 
for the project. In addition, North called upon the 
Enterprise which paid $30,150 to the DEA agents for 
their expenses.76 
At North's request, the Enterprise paid $100,000 for 
radios supplied to a political party of a foreign 
nation.77 Another project involved an attempted 
propaganda effort in a foreign country. North dis-
closed to the Committees in an executive session that 
a number of other projects were in the planning 
stages.78 
The North Residence Security System 
Another Enterprise expense was a home security 
system, which cost approximately $16,000, for the 
residence of Oliver North. As early as September 
1985, North reported harassment which he attributed 
to anti-Contra demonstrators, including damage to 
part of the fence around his home and one of his 
cars." In the spring of 1986, the press reported that

Chapter 22 
Abu Nidal, the international terrorist and assassin, had 
placed North on his "hit" list. When the FBI advised 
North that it was not authorized to provide protec-
tion, North made a request to Poindexter for assist-
ance. Poindexter did not follow up on the matter.8? 
According to the Marine Corps, North did not re-
quest protection for his home from the Corps, an 
option that was available to him." North told Secord 
about the problem and Secord offered to help." 
Secord asked Glenn Robinette, an ex-CIA officer 
with experience in electronic surveillance and securi-
ty, for assistance. Secord had hired Robinette in late 
March to do investigative work related to the Avir-
gan and Honey lawsuit, at a fee of $4,000 a month 
plus expenses. Robinette examined the North resi-
dence and met first with Mrs. North, then with North 
and Secord. Robinette proposed a security system de-
signed primarily to provide protection from trespass-
ers, not terrorists, at a cost of $8,500. According to 
Robinette, North responded to the effect, "Please try 
to keep it along those lines. Remember, I am a poor 
lieutenant colonel." 83 
Robinette paid the installers of the system, which 
included a remote control electronic gate, approxi-
mately $13,900?$6,000 in May and roughly $7,900 on 
July 10th when the installation of the system was 
complete. At the time of each payment, Robinette 
reported to Secord, rather than North, for reimburse-
ment because he was "working for Secord." Secord 
reimbursed Robinette for his time and expenses with 
$7,000 in cash and a $9,000 check drawn by Zucker 
from Enterprise funds and mailed to Robinette at Se-
cord's request.84 
On August 6, 1986, at a meeting in the White 
House, North told Members of the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, who were inquiring 
about his involvement with the Contras, that he had 
installed, at his own expense, a security system to 
protect his family from anti-Contra demonstrators.85 
North testified that a bill never came for the securi-
ty system and that he assumed that "an accommoda-
tion was worked between Mr. Robinette and General 
Secord to make a gift out of [the] security system." 86 
Secord, in an interview, denied that he made the gift 
or approved it. From Secord's viewpoint, there was a 
misunderstanding: Robinette asked for his expenses 
and Secord never realized that those expenses were 
for the security system rather than for investigative 
work.87 Robinette testified as follows: 
Q: When you went to General Secord to seek 
reimbursement [for the final payment to the secu-
rity company], you told him what you were seek-
ing reimbursement for, didn't you? 
A: Yes, sir. 
Q: He knew he was paying you for the security 
system, didn't he? 
342 
A: That would be my understanding, sir. I usual-
ly told him what I was asking to be paid for. 
Q: There is no question about it, is there? 
A: No, sir, there is no question about it.88 
In December 1986, North realized that the gift of 
the security system "just didn't look right." 89 By that 
time, North had been named in the Justice Depart-
ment application for the appointment of an Independ-
ent Counsel. North called Robinette and asked him to 
send a bill." Since the system had already been paid 
for, Robinette assumed that North wanted to make it 
appear that he (North) had actually paid the bill. 
Robinette, who told Secord that he was going to send 
North a bill, sent North two back-dated bills of pay-
ment due, dated months earlier but actually written 
and delivered at the same time in December 1986." 
North, in turn, wrote two back-dated letters, de-
signed to fit with Robinette's bills, which told a false 
story about financial arrangements relating to the se-
curity system. In the first, dated May 18, 1986, but 
written in December 1986, North stated that it was 
his understanding that he could pay for the system 
either through 24 monthly installments or by making 
his house a demonstration unit. North concluded the 
letter by informing Robinette that he was selecting 
the second option. In the second letter, dated October 
1, 1986, but also written in December, North apolo-
gized for the delay in responding to the first and 
second notices and reminded Robinette that he 
wished to pay for the system by making his home 
available as a demonstration unit." In his testimony, 
North stated that he typed at least one of the letters 
on a demonstration typewriter in a typewriter store, 
rather than using a home typewriter." 
On the morning of March 16, 1987, as Robinette 
went out to get his morning paper, he was inter-
viewed by a reporter about the driveway gate which 
was part of the North security system. Robinette 
stated that he installed the gate for North at no 
charge, hoping that North "might steer business his 
way" and that he would be able to put in gates for 
North's neighbors." Later in the day, North called 
Robinette, asking to meet with him on the following 
day at his lawyer's office, and requesting that Robin-
ette bring copies of the back-dated letters." 
Robinette gave the letters to North's attorneys, but 
did not say they were spurious. Robinette then went 
to see Secord who, upon learning that Robinette had 
sent North a bill for the security system, stated, "You 
did the right thing." That same afternoon Robinette 
received a call from North's attorney, who told him 
not to protect North, and to "tell the truth, tell the 
truth, tell the truth." He also advised Robinette to get 
an attorney. Robinette did so. Later, after receiving 
immunity, he related the above-described events to 
the Independent Counsel and the Committees."

Chapter 22 
North testified that in fabricating the letters in De-
cember 1986, "I did probably the grossest misjudg-
ment that I have made in my life."97 He added that 
he had acted, in accepting the system, to protect his 
family and told the Committees, "If it was General 
Secord who paid the bill. . . you guys ought to write 
him a check, because the Government should have 
done it to begin with." 98 North offered no explana-
tion as to why he also created the false record, other 
than that the gift "just didn't look right."99 
Unexplained Cash Expenditures 
The CSF ledgers record expenditures of approxi-
mately $902,110 during the period from March 1985 
to October 1986 without identifying their specific pur-
pose. Two transactions accounted for the bulk of 
these funds. The first involved a $260,000 cash dis-
bursement on May 21, 1986.1" In the second transac-
tion, $310,000 was withdrawn from the Hyde Park 
account on July 18, 1986.1" The ledgers state that in 
both cases, the funds were "in transit," but where 
they went is unknown. In addition, the Enterprise 
transferred $152,200 to an account called Codelis.'" 
Finally, Hakim, Secord, and Clines received cash to-
taling $179,610 from various Enterprise accounts; 
these transactions were listed as "business expenses," 
and were in amounts of up to $50,000 
Section 4: The Diversion How 
Much?'" 
The Iran arms sales generated a $16.1 million surplus 
for the Enterprise. The Enterprise managed to spend 
part of that money, $3.8 million, for the Contras 
before its operations were stopped. 
As of November 19, 1985, the day before the first 
money from the Iran arms transactions was deposited 
into the Enterprise, the Enterprise had a cash balance 
of approximately $1 million. From November 20, 
1985 through December 1986, the Enterprise received 
an additional $2.4 million in donations for the Con-
tras. During the same period, the Enterprise spent 
approximately $7.2 million on behalf of the Con-
tras.' ?5 The shortfall?$3.8 million?was diverted 
from the Iran arms sale surplus.'" 
The diversion did not take place by accident. In 
fact, North helped set the price of the arms so that a 
surplus would be created which could be used for the 
Contras.'" According to Secord, North consistently 
instructed him to use the surpluses generated from the 
Iranian arms sales for the Contra project.'" North 
apparently thought that at least $6 million of the Iran 
surplus from the May transaction alone would be used 
for the Contras. He sent Poindexter a PROF note on 
May 16, saying that the Enterprise had "more than $6 
million available for immediate disbursement."'" 
Poindexter testified that he believed that the Enter-
prise was giving the Contras all of the surplus from 
the Iran arms 
Section 5: Profits Who Made 
What 
Breaking the Code Names 
Hakim was both a promoter and a salesman: The 
Enterprise was a great opportunity to make a great 
deal of money and, he said, at the same time, to serve 
both his new country, the United States, and his 
native country, Iran. Hakim added: 
I never pretended to undertake the tasks I was 
asked to perform for philanthropic purposes and 
I made that clear to all of those with whom I 
[w]as involved?including General Secord, Lieu-
tenant Colonel North, the CIA, and the Irani-
ans.111 
The Enterprise fulfilled Hakim's objective: without 
risking any of its own or Hakim's money, the Enter-
prise made extraordinary profits through weapons 
sales. Its revenues of $48 million exceeded its expenses 
by $12.2 million. Secord preferred to speak of this 
money as "residuals" or "surplus" rather than profit 
because he did not want to be called a "profiteer."112 
Not only was the structure and operation of the 
Enterprise cloaked in secrecy, so was the distribution 
of its profits. The CSF records indicate that $6.8 
million of the $12.2 million "surplus" was distributed 
as profits directly or indirectly to five entities: 
"Albert Hakim, Korel Assets, C. Tea, Scitech, and 
Button.""3 In addition, $4.2 million was transferred 
to CSF to be held in a fiduciary capacity for the 
Enterprise as "Reserves."114 The balance, $1.2 mil-
lion, remained at the end of 1986 as undistributed cash 
in the Enterprise's operating companies."5 
Each of the five entities had a Capital Ledger. 
Each time funds were distributed from Enterprise ac-
counts to one of the five entities, the date and the 
amount of the transfer were recorded in that ledger. 
Generally, the funds were wired from Enterprise ac-
counts either to a bank account controlled by one of 
the five entities or CSF, where at least four of the 
five entities had entered into individual fiduciary 
agreements. The fiduciary agreements provided that 
CSF would manage the money of each entity and 
return all or part of the money to the entity or its 
representative upon demand. Hakim produced records 
of a CSF fiduciary fund for Korel, Hakim, Scitech, 
and Button, including ledgers for each fund.116 
Only Hakim's Capital Ledger was in his own 
name.117 Hakim stated that C. Tea was the code 
name for Thomas Clines," g who handled the Contra 
arms procurement for the Enterprise."9 The records 
bear that out.'2? Hakim testified that Scitech was the

offshore arm of the Secord/Hakim firm STTGI and 
that it was equally owned by Secord and Hakim. The 
records also support that statement.'" Hakim also 
testified that Korel stood for Secord, and Button 
stood for North.122 
Korel Assets 
Hakim testified that Korel Assets was a corporation 
that held Secord's profit share.'" The records of the 
Enterprise support Hakim's testimony. Profit distribu-
tions to Korel match, often to the last dollar, distribu-
tions to Secord's equal partner, Hakim. 
According to the CSF Ledgers, $1.62 million was 
transferred out of the Enterprise accounts for the 
benefit of "Korel Assets." Most of this money was 
distributed to the Korel Assets Fiduciary Fund where 
it remained unspent. However, $269,000 was trans-
ferred either directly from the Enterprise accounts or 
indirectly through the Korel Fiduciary Fund to the 
U.S. or elsewhere. The Committees have traced most 
of this money to: Secord's personal bank account (in-
cluding payments for a personal airplane) ($74,600); 
payments for Secord's Porsche ($31,825); payments 
for a stay by Secord at a health farm ($3,075); and 
cash withdrawals where Secord signed the withdraw-
al slips ($33,000).124 An additional $126,492 went for 
other purposes.126 
Secord testified that he was unaware that Korel 
Assets stood for him and that it held his profit 
share.126 He claimed that the money he personally 
received from Switzerland came through Hakim as 
personal loans or as payments for work unrelated to 
the Enterprise. Hakim never mentioned Korel to 
Secord. As far as Secord was concerned, the money 
for the Porsche was a loan from Hakim (even though 
Secord signed no note and paid no interest), and the 
money for the airplane was Secord's share of a con-
sulting fee.127 Hakim denied that the money for a 
Porsche was a loan and indicated that in both cases 
he took the money from Secord's profit share.'" 
Secord testified that he was originally an equal 
profit participant with Hakim in the Enterprise, and 
that the same 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement ap-
plied to any profits from any Enterprise company, 
including Korel Assets.'" According to Secord, CSF 
initially held his profits under his name. Then, some-
time in July or August 1985, he orally foreswore his 
interest in any profits of the Enterprise.13? He stated 
that after he foreswore his profits, he "left to Hakim 
to do with [them] as he wished." If Hakim placed the 
money in a CSF fiduciary fund called Korel Assets 
for him, Secord was unaware of it. In addition, 
Secord asserted that Hakim calculated profits on the 
Contra arms deals, and that Secord had no specific 
knowledge about the profit distributions.'" 
Hakim confirmed part of what Secord said. Hakim 
stated that Secord orally relinquished his interest in 
any profits, not in mid-1985, but in "early to mid 
344 
1986."132 Hakim noted, however, that he ignored 
Secord's oral waiver and he continued to treat the 
money held by Korel Assets as Secord's profit share 
that Secord could claim at any time.' 33 Secord, 
Hakim declared, was not a good businessman who 
could keep track of money; rather, "he was born a 
general and will die a general."34 
Hakim denied that he was the one ultimately re-
sponsible for profit distributions and indicated that 
Secord was aware of Korel and its function. Hakim 
testified that Secord was the final authority on profit 
distributions (commissions were distributed to Korel, 
Hakim and C. Tea through August 1986).132 And, 
according to Hakim, Secord inspected the profit en-
tries of the Enterprise books, including those of Korel 
Assets, as late as May 1986.'36 Hakim also stated that 
Secord's profits were distributed to Korel Assets with 
Secord's specific approval so as "to eliminate personal 
contact to those funds."137 
Except in a few cases,'" Secord's name does not 
appear on the CSF documents produced by 
Hakim.139 
"Button" 
On May 20, 1986, the Enterprise transferred 
$200,000 to "B. Button." The money was wired out 
of an Enterprise account to CSF, which agreed to 
hold the funds for "B. Button" under a CSF fiduciary 
agreement. The transfer was recorded in the Button 
Capital Ledger as a distribution for the benefit of 
Button.149 
Hakim's explanation of the Button money changed 
during his deposition. He initially testified that the 
Button fund was set up to pay death benefits for the 
pilots in the Contra air operation and that Button 
meant "Button up or something."141 When told of a 
handwritten note by Zucker referring to "Mrs. Belly 
Button," Hakim said that Button meant "bellybutton" 
and gave an almost incomprehensible explanation.142 
Hakim, who denied that Button stood for anyone's 
name, failed to explain why "Button" had a Capital 
Ledger, as if it were sharing profits. 
Two days later, Hakim stated that the $200,000 was 
a death benefit for Mrs. North and her family in the 
event of North's death. The Capital Ledger "Button" 
referred to distributions for the benefit of North. 
Shortly thereafter, Hakim produced the "B. Button" 
fiduciary agreement which showed that $200,000 was 
being held by Zucker for B. Button. And after being 
shown the reference to "Mrs. Bellybutton," Hakim 
admitted that it was the code name for Mrs. North. 
(Button was short for North's codename?Bellybut-
ton.) 
Hakim testified that he had proposed to Secord that 
a $500,000 death benefit be set up in connection with 
North's trip to Tehran in May 1986, but that Secord 
had rejected the proposal telling Hakim that he did 
not "understand a soldier's life." Hakim then pro-

Chapter 22 
posed $200,000, and Secord acquiesced.'" Hakim 
said that his motive was humanitarian: he had become 
extremely fond of North (whom he had met only 
once) and wanted to relieve North's anxieties about 
his family. He asserted he never told North about the 
Button Fund, but did say if North did not return from 
Tehran "as long as one of us is alive you need not 
worry about your family.9,144 
The death benefit for North had not emerged in 
Secord's prior interviews and public testimony. When 
asked about Hakim's testimony, Secord acknowledged 
that Hakim told him of the need for "insurance cover-
age" for North. Secord claimed that he told Hakim 
that they "couldn't set up an insurance coverage for 
011ie North," but that North could be covered by the 
$200,000 death benefit fund which had been set up in 
November 1985 for the pilots involved in the resup-
ply operation.'" He recalled opposing the notion of 
a $500,000 fund.146 
North offered a third version. He testified that in 
early March, just after he met Hakim, Hakim told 
him, "If you don't come back, I will do something for 
your family.99 1 47 
The matter did not end with the creation of the 
Button Fund. Hakim also testified that he sought a 
way to give money to Mrs. North for the education 
of the North children, after he learned from Secord 
that North was worried about college costs. Hakim 
testified that he decided to offer Mrs. North $15,000, 
representing the annual interest on the $200,000 
Button account, and that he asked Zucker to try to 
pass money to Mrs. North in a "legal, proper way." 
According to Hakim, Zucker telephoned Mrs. North 
directly, and told her that he was representing an 
anonymous admirer of her husband who wanted to 
help her family financially and that he wished to meet 
with her in Philadelphia.146 
Secord gave a different version. He testified that 
Hakim never said anything to him about giving 
money to Mrs. North, but had mentioned only that 
Zucker was a "wizard" at making money for other 
people, and that he might be able to advise Mrs. 
North on investments.'" Secord stated that he told 
Hakim that the Norths did not have any money to 
invest, and that you could not make "chicken soup 
out of chicken feathers."'" Although Secord consid-
ered it a "bad idea," Hakim insisted that he ask 
North.15' Secord called North at least twice about 
the matter.'" In particular, Hakim spoke to Secord 
about the "requirement" to put a North child in col-
lege. As a result, Secord testified, Mrs. North met 
with Zucker when he came to Philadelphia in the 
spring.'" North testified that he sent his wife to 
Philadelphia for the meeting with Zucker, but that 
Nile purpose, as I understood it, of that meeting 
was that my wife would be in touch with the 
person who would, if I didn't return, do some-
thing for my family.'" 
There are three reports, all second hand accounts, 
of the meeting between Mrs. North and Zucker. (Mrs. 
North, invoking her spousal privilege, declined to tes-
tify, and Zucker refused to meet with the Commit-
tees.)155 According to Hakim, Zucker reported that 
he looked at the North family structure to see if there 
would be a legal way to pass money, but was unable 
to identify a family member to serve as the con-
duit.'" Secord testified that North told him that "the 
trip to Philadelphia had been a waste of time and a 
train ticket and his wife was more confused now than 
she normally was."157 North testified that Zucker's 
meeting with his wife focused on "a general descrip-
tion of my family," and that Zucker telephoned Mrs. 
North in June: "The lawyer called again and asked 
for the name of an adult executor for our family." 
North said he told his wife not to call back.159 
Hakim, however, continued to pursue the matter. 
He testified that he "started to really focus on this" in 
the fall of 1986.159 Hakim testified that Zucker came 
up with the idea of having a client of his, a real estate 
developer, employ Mrs. North. Hakim stated that he 
told Zucker, "if the guy doesn't have an opening, 
cannot pay for it, we will pay for it. In other words 
we [would have] paid the guy to pay her so she 
would work."'" In September, Zucker called a 
Washington lawyer, David Lewis. Lewis testified that 
he visited Zucker in Geneva on October 10, 1986. 
Zucker asked Lewis if he had a client who could pass 
money to the wife of a White House official disguised 
as compensation for her services in a real estate trans-
action. The money, Zucker explained, was due her 
husband. The husband's name, to the best of Lewis' 
recollection, was Lt. Col. North."' Zucker said that 
Lewis' client would be reimbursed through a Swiss 
account, or any other account in the world.'" Lewis 
demurred. He reported this attempt to the Commit-
tees and the Independent Counsel in February 1987 
after he realized the significance of the conversation. 
Secord testified that he knew nothing about this 
effort.16 3 
No money, so far as the Committees can determine, 
was ever passed to the Norths by Zucker or Hakim. 
$15,000 was transferred, however, to STTGI on May 
5, 1986. The transmittal instructions contained the no-
tation, in Zucker's writing, "Mrs. Bellybutton."164 
There is no evidence that North knew of the effort 
to pass money to his family through Lewis. Hakim 
stated, "I put a wheel into motion and then if North's 
family wanted to open the door . . . they could. If 
they wanted to close the door . . . they also could do 
that."'" 
The Surplus 
The $12.2 million in Enterprise surplus was distrib-
uted in a number of ways. (See Figure 22-5, Break-
down of $12.2 million surplus). The CSF ledgers indi-
cate that Secord, Hakim, and Clines took part of the

surplus as commissions on arms sales to the Contras. 
But Secord and Hakim did not stop with the self-
determined commissions. The ledgers also indicate 
that they took part of the $12.2 million as seed money 
for risky personal business ventures, for personal ex-
penditures, and for the Button fund. Finally, Secord 
and Hakim transferred part of the surplus to CSF to 
be held as Reserves for future projects by Hakim, 
Secord, and North. 
The Commissions 
Approximately $4.4 million of the Enterprise profits 
went to Secord, Hakim, and Clines as commissions on 
arms sales to the Contras and the CIA?even though 
North testified that he did not intend to make anyone 
a rich man from the sales.166 Apparently, Secord and 
Hakim never negotiated with Calero167 or anyone 
else for these commissions; they simply took what 
they wanted out of the general pool of money in the 
Enterprise accounts. Hakim described the basic ar-
rangement in his testimony as follows: 
Q: Your gross income comes from third parties, 
contributions from third countries, private contri-
butions, profits on the sale of arms to Iran. 
So really as far as the profit that you take or the 
leftover in the enterprise you really negotiate 
with yourself as to the amount of profits, do you 
not? 
A: That is correct. 
Q: And that makes it very flexible for you as to 
whether or not you want to claim 75 percent or 
50 percent or 30 percent, isn't that basically the 
situation? 
A: You are correct, sir. . . . 
Q: You simply negotiate with yourself? 
A: Yes.168 
As noted, Secord described each arms shipment as 
a separate phase, Phases I-VII. The final shipment for 
the Contras, purchased in August of 1986, never made 
it to the Contras and thus Secord did not describe it 
as a "Phase"; here, it is referred to as the Stranded 
Shipment.' 6 9 
The CSF ledgers indicate that on Phases I through 
IV, Secord and Hakim allocated themselves and 
Clines a total of approximately $2.7 million, equal to 
31.6 percent of the cost of the arms alone and 28.7 
percent of the cost of arms including delivery.'" 
Calero testified that he received the impression 
from Secord that there were no such commissions, 
and considered it a "revelation" when he heard 
Secord testify.'" North testified that under Casey's 
plan those involved in the Enterprise were entitled to 
"reasonable compensation."' 7 2 
On Phases V through VII and the stranded ship-
ment, once again, Secord and Hakim allocated com-
missions to themselves and Tom Clines from funds in 
the Enterprise accounts. The CSF ledgers indicate 
that the commissions totalled $1.7 million, which was 
equal to 56 percent of the cost of the arms alone and 
49 percent of the cost of arms and delivery to Central 
America.' 7 3 
Secord testified that the Enterprise's mark up on its 
arms sales to the Contras, excluding transportation, 
ranged between 20 and 30 percent and "averaged out 
almost exactly to 20 percent."174 According to CSF 
ledgers, the commissions on all the arms purchased 
for the Contras averaged 38 percent when transporta-
tion costs are excluded.' 7 5

Chapter 22 
Hakim arranged for several commissions and profit 
distributions to be made through an off-the-chart 
company, Defex SA, which did not appear on the 
CSF chart in North's safe. The choice of name was 
not random. Defex (Portugal) was a major arms 
dealer from whom the Enterprise bought weapons. 
Defex SA was owned by the Enterprise and, accord-
ing to Hakim and Secord, had no connection with 
Defex (Portugal). Hakim testified that when he trans-
ferred funds to Defex SA, "people" would think that 
the funds were being used to purchase arms from 
Defex (Portugal)."6 Secord testified that Defex SA 
was a "cover mechanism" set up by Hakim to dis-
guise the source of money paid to arms dealers.'" 
Hakim could not remember exactly whom he was 
trying to confuse-maybe Eastern bloc arms dealers, 
he suggested. The ledgers indicated that one of the 
main uses of Defex SA was for distributing profits. 
Often, commissions were moved into the Defex SA 
account, creating wire records and ledger entries that 
looked like payments to Defex. Then the profits were 
wired out of Defex SA to members of the Enter-
prise.' 7 8 
The final commission distribution was for the 
"stranded shipment." In August 1986, the restrictions 
of the Boland Amendment were about to be lifted and 
the CIA wigs to resume its role as arms supplier to the 
Contift. Haim and Clines decided that they should 
have one last distribution. They made it a large one. 
The purchase price of the weapons was about $2.2 
million.'" The weapons were purchased, but deliv-
ery to the Contras was never completed. Hence, the 
weapons were known as the "stranded shipment" and 
were ultimately sold for a $1 million loss to an inter-
mediary who later sold the weapons to the CIA.'8? 
But the loss was not limited to $1 million. Hakim 
testified that he and Clines proposed that the group 
reward itself for their work with a fee of $861,327, 
which is equal to 39 percent of the cost of the weap-
ons. According to Hakim, Secord approved the com-
mission and the division of profits among the group. 
The profits were split on a 30/30/30/10 basis: 
$258,398 each to Hakim, Korel Assets, and Clines, 
and $86,133 to Scitech. 8 1

2 Profit distributions for Phases I-III were paid in lump sums and cannot be accurately divided among phases. Shown here is the total sum of money 
distributed to Korel, Hakim, C. Tea, and STTGI/Scitech during the period from February 1985 to mid-December 1985. That sum falls into the 40/40/20 ratio 
described by Secord (when the Scitech/STTGI share is divided among Secord and Hakim), and is substantially verified by Secords's estimated total profit for 
Phases I-III ($2,239,114). The last distribution for this period, which went to Hakim, was paid on 12/17/85; the CSF ledger entry for this 12/17/85 
distribution reads "Bal. Acc. Phases 
Secord described the Phase IV profit as an December shipment with a total profit of $252,000; accordingly, the May 20, 1986, distribution which totaled 
$252,000 has been allocated to Phase IV. 
4 Hakim testified that the February 7, distribution was a profit distribution (Hakim, Dep. 5/22/87, at 122-24). The Committees have allocated the 
February 7, 1986, distribution to Phase V by process of elimination-all of the other distributions fit with other phases. 
5Secord described Phase VI as an April shipment with a total profit of $88,303. Thus, the May 20, 1986, distribution which totaled $88,303 has been 
allocated to Phase VI. The Committees have assumed that the April 22, distribution was a profit distribution because it fails into a 40/40/20 ratio described by 
Secord (when the STTGI/Scitech share is allocated equally among Korel and Hakim). The Committees have assumed that the April 22, 1986, distribution was 
part of the Phase VI profit because the distribution occurred in April (the date of the shipment, according to Secord). 
6 Secord reported a total profit of $301,194 on Phase VII (a May shipment according to Secord). Since the June 3, 1986, and June 20, 1986 distribution 
total this amount, they have been categorized as Phase VII shipments. 
Secord did not report the amount of profit for the stranded shipment; however, Hakim was shown the ledgers and stated that the August 27, 1986, 
profit distribution was for work done on the Stranded Shipment.

In most cases, the CSF Capital Ledgers did not 
specifically identify the reasons for particular distribu-
tions. The ledgers simply tracked the distribution of 
348 
money in Enterprise accounts to Secord, Hakim, 
Clines, and other persons. A total of $6.6 million was 
distributed to Secord, Hakim, and Clines, while Table

Chapter 22 
22-5 shows only $4.4 million in commissions. The 
difference is additional profit distributions which 
Secord and Hakim took from Enterprise accounts for 
business ventures and personal use. To distinguish 
commission withdrawals from personal and business 
venture withdrawals, the Committees relied on a 
number of factors, including notations in the ledgers, 
Hakim's testimony, information provided by Secord, 
and a careful analysis of distributions.182 
Other Profit Distributions'83 
In addition to commissions, the partners took more 
than $2.1 million in profit distributions from the En-
terprise accounts. Apparently, $420,000 of this money 
was used by Secord, Hakim, and Clines for personal 
and other purposes. The balance, approximately $1.7 
million, was invested in a variety of business ven-
tures.184 
While most of these business ventures had no con-
nection to the Enterprise, one venture involved pro-
posed sales of military equipment to the Contras and 
another contemplated sales of military equipment to 
the Iranians. Zucker played an active role in the ven-
tures as an adviser.195 In at least one case, he was 
also a potential partner. This section describes these 
business ventures in greater detail. 
A. Tri-American Partnership'86 
In the spring of 1986, $150,000 was transferred 
from Albon Values to Tri-American Arms, a partner-
ship among Secord (representing Hakim's interest as 
well as his own), Larry Royer, and Dan Maros-
tica.197 Secord and Hakim each participated in the 
development of ambitious plans for Tri-American.199 
Initially, they planned four projects requiring sever-
al million dollars in venture capital. They included 
the manufacture of submachine guns, a biotechnology 
speculation, a real estate investment, and the "bulk 
manufacturing of opium alkaloids."89 
To explain the source of the venture capital, Hakim 
and Secord put out a cover story?an organization 
called the Arab Development Project would be back-
ing Stanford Technology Trading Group in the ven-
tures. In fact, as Hakim testified, the funds were to 
come out of the Enterprise.190 
Royer and Marostica testified that the initial phase 
of the machine gun project called for manufacturing 
4,000 guns for the Contras; the projected cost of the 
weapons was $3 million and the projected profit to 
Tri-American was $4.2 million."' Secord flatly 
denied, however, that one of the purposes of Tri-
American was to sell weapons to the Contras."92 
The real estate investment involved the purchase of 
timber property in the Northwest. After cutting Mar-
ostica out, Secord, Hakim, and Royer pursued the 
project through a company bearing the initials of 
their last names, SRH, Inc. According to Royer, the 
project called for purchasing land for $5.7 million and 
a $1 million down payment to obtain financing for the 
purchase. In addition, Royer stated that the project 
required $5 million in working capita1.193 Hakim tes-
tified that CSF was planning to extend a multimillion 
dollar loan to SRH, Inc., for the project?and that 
the loan was to be collateralized by Enterprise funds. 
The project was abandoned after the Iran-Contra 
story appeared in the press.'" 
B. Stanford Technology Trading Group, Inc. 
Secord and Hakim ran a great deal of their business 
activities out of the offices of Stanford Technology 
Trading Group, their jointly-owned company. As 
noted, Hakim and Secord founded the company with 
the purpose of developing security contracts in for-
eign countries. They did not have much success. The 
Enterprise supported the entire budget of the compa-
ny, which ran up bills (including salary) of more than 
$500,000 from the summer of 1984 to the fall of 1986. 
A total of $582,206 (including commissions of 
$214,000 and $50,000 for the laser sight described 
below) was distributed from the Enterprise's oper-
ating accounts to Stanford Technology Trading 
Group from February 1985 through November 
1986.195 Secord drew a salary of $6,000 a month, 
Hakim drew $5,000 a month, Dutton received $3,283 
a month, and rent was $3,868 a month.'" Keith 
Phillips, whom Secord hired to pursue security con-
tracts in Saudi Arabia, received $37,000 from Enter-
prise accounts.197 
Secord acknowledged that Stanford Technology 
Trading Group received approximately $400,000 to 
$500,000 from Switzerland, but claimed that these 
were loans from CSF arranged by Hakim.'" Hakim 
testified that disbursements to Stanford Technology 
Trading Group started out as loans from CSF but 
that the loans were repaid by the Enterprise; in effect, 
"money was pumped from the Enterprise into 
STTGI."199 
C. The Scitech Fund 
Hakim described Scitech as an offshore company that 
would use its capital to further Secord/Hakim busi-
ness projects.20? CSF held a fiduciary fund for Sci-
tech with $271,984 from commissions on arms sales 
and an additional $250,000 from Enterprise ac-
counts."' A $100,000 down payment for the SRH, 
Inc., real estate deal came from the Scitech fund.202 
D. Laser Sight 
In the fall of 1986, Hakim, apparently with Secord's 
assistance, attempted to market a laser night-vision 
sight for military use. Hakim approached Forways, 
Inc., a manufacturer of military spare parts, to see if 
the company could produce the sight. Zucker, a 25 
percent owner of Forways, had brought Forways to 
Secord's attention as early as June of 1984. In August 
349

. . I? 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 22 
of 1986, after a Hakim visit to Forways for a demon-
stration of the laser sight, the Enterprise wired 
$50,000 as "seed money" to Forways for the manufac-
ture of the sights. But the money was not used by 
Forways. Instead, it was immediately sent to Stanford 
Technology Trading Group.20 3 
E. Forways 
Throughout 1986, Zucker experienced problems 
with one of his Forways partners, Jacob Farber.204 
According to Hakim, in the fall of 1986, he and 
Secord made plans to purchase most of Farber's inter-
est in Forways so that they would obtain a one-third 
interest in the company. At the same time, as negotia-
tions were ongoing with the Second Channel, Hakim 
gave a set of Forways catalogues to the Second 
Channel negotiators and told them "once things get 
going, then we will be able to sell directly from 
Forways."205 Hakim denied that he mentioned any 
specific product.2" The records of Forways show 
that from the fall of 1985 through the fall of 1986, the 
company attempted to buy?and apparently succeed-
ed in some cases?quantities of HAWK spares parts 
in Europe. 2 7 
In early October, Farber sold his shares to Zucker 
for $750,000. Shortly thereafter, Zucker wrote a 
memorandum to the officers of Forways stating that 
Secord and Hakim would probably buy the bulk of 
the Farber shares, thereby obtaining a one-third inter-
est in Forways. Zucker also stated in the memoran-
dum that he expected Forways to have record-break-
ing sales and profits in the coming year?at levels 
inconceivable to the new officers of Forways.208 
In early November, $760,000 of Enterprise money 
was apparently transferred to CSF: on November 5, 
1986, $500,000 moved out of Hakim's fiduciary fund 
to an unknown location and, on November 10, 1986, 
$260,000 moved out of one of the operational compa-
nies to an unknown location. The $500,000 block of 
funds had been previously earmarked for a joint 
Hakim/Secord investment. The $260,000 transfer was 
recorded in the ledgers with the notation "CSF In 
vest.?Forways." 2 9 
Hakim denied that the Secord-Hakim purchase of 
the Farber shares was ever completed, and in March 
of 1987, Zucker wrote a note to an officer and direc-
tor of Forways indicating that after the Iran/Contra 
story broke, he stopped the Hakim-Secord part of the 
transaction.2" However, there is no record of the 
$760,000 ever being returned to the Enterprise or any 
of the fiduciary funds. 
F. The Iranian Market 
The amounts distributed to Hakim and Secord do 
not tell the full story of their ambitions, which Hakim 
made no effort to hide. Hakim saw the Iranian market 
as providing spectacular opportunities for wealth. He 
testified that he hoped to obtain for Secord and him-
350 
self at least a 3 percent share of the annual $15 billion 
Iranian market if commercial relations with the 
United States could be renewed. By using money 
from the Enterprise, including the reserves to 
"grease" the way with the Second Channel, and by 
proposing compromises to North and Iran, Hakim 
was not only promoting a solution to the impasse 
over the hostages, but also pursuing his and Secord's 
own commercial interests. The ultimate goal, as 
Hakim admitted, was not the millions he actually took 
from the Enterprise during 1985 and 1986, but the $15 
billion-a-year Iranian market.2" 
The Reserves 
The Enterprise transferred $4.2 million to CSF to 
be held in three fiduciary accounts referred to as the 
"Reserves.19212 A large part of the Reserve monies 
appear to have come from the proceeds of the Iranian 
arms sales. 
According to the CSF fiduciary agreements, Hakim 
was the owner of the Reserves; Secord testified, how-
ever, that the Enterprise was the beneficial owner of 
the Reserves and Hakim acknowledged that the Re-
serves were treated as the Enterprise's money.2" 
Table 22-6, Distributions to Reserves, shows the 
amount of each Reserve, the operational company 
from which the monies were taken, and the date each 
Reserve was established.

Hakim testified that Reserve 2, containing 
$2,000,000, was to be used to pay money to persons 
associated with the Second Channel. According to 
Hakim, if the Second Channel initiative was success-
ful, the money was to be invested for those persons in 
the joint Iranian-U.S. venture which was being 
planned; if the Second Channel was unsuccessful, it 
would be used as baksheesh.215 Reserve 1, containing 
an additional $2,000,000, was to be used for any pur-
pose, including "operational purposes.99216 
The CSF fiduciary agreement governing Reserve 
1?the one for covert operations?provided that 
should Hakim die, Secord would have direct control 
over it and should Secord die, North would have 
direct control. Should North die, the remaining por-
tion of the Reserve would be divided equally among 
the estates of all three men. The instructions to CSF 
were irrrevocable without the consent of all the bene-
ficiaries.2" Hakim said that in setting up Reserve 1, 
he simply followed the structure of the Enterprise 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7

Chapter 22 
from top to bottom as he understood it?with North 
on the top.2' 8 
The CSF fiduciary agreement governing Reserve 
2?dedicated to the commercial venture with the Ira-
nians?provided that upon the death of Hakim, 
Secord would control the Reserve, and if Secord 
should die, the remaining portion of the Reserve 
would be divided among the estates of Hakim and 
Secord. Again, the instructions to CSF were irrevoca-
ble without the consent of Secord.219 
Initially, Secord testified that the two $2,000,000 
Reserves established as insurance for Israeli aircraft 
were largely restricted to that use.22? In fact, the 
Israelis did demand a guarantee against loss of $2 
million for each airplane used in the Iranian arms 
transfers?a guarantee which was explicitly released 
on August 3, 1986.22' Later, Secord indicated that 
the Reserves were used for all of the Enterprise's 
operations. One of the continuing operations named 
by Secord was "a joint Iranian-American commercial 
venture."222 
North testified that he specifically requested that 
some Reserve funds be put aside for a number of 
special activities.223 Those activities included recov-
ering military equipment, setting up a propaganda op-
eration in foreign countries, and influencing domestic 
politics in foreign countries.224 
Secord and North testified briefly about the origin 
of the Hakim "wills"?the provisions for continuing 
control over the Reserves in the event of Hakim's 
death. Secord told the Committees that he knew 
Hakim had made arrangements to cover a catastrophe 
but professed ignorance of the details.225 North 
claimed to have been totally in the dark as to the 
arrangements. He noted, however, that at one point 
he asked Secord what would happen to the money if 
"both you guys go down on some airplane flight." 
According to North, Secord responded, "Don't 
worry, arrangements will be made so that these oper-
ations can continue. "226 Hakim claimed that he told 
North that if he, Hakim, died, North would be in 
total control. 227 
Neither Secord nor Hakim had a clear recollection 
of the purpose of Reserve 3 containing $200,000. 
Hakim suggested that it might have been set up to 
cover "death benefits" for those working on the re-
supply operation, or as a set aside for a Secord-Hakim 
business venture. Secord remembered setting aside 
$200,000 for death benefits. He insisted, however, that 
there was only one such fund and it was converted 
into the Button fund. The purpose of Reserve 3 re-
mains a mystery.228 
Section 6: Where Is The Money 
Now229 
The Enterprise generated a surplus of $12.2 million. 
Some of this surplus went directly to Secord, Clines, 
and Hakim. Substantial funds, $7.8 million, however, 
remained under management in Switzerland when the 
Enterprise ceased its operations. This money was ap-
parently frozen by Swiss authorities at the request of 
the Justice Department. 
Of the $7.8 million, approximately $2 million is held 
in CSF fiduciary accounts for the benefit of Hakim, 
Korel Assets and Scitech. Approximately $200,000 re-
mains in the Button account and another $4.2 million 
is held as reserves for the Enterprise by CSF. The 
balance, $1.2 million, is in the Enterprise's Swiss bank 
accounts, unallocated for any purpose. Table 22-7 
shows the location of the $7.8 million.

The participants have different ideas of what should 
happen to the money. Secord testified that the money 
belongs to the Enterprise and that is up to Hakim, as 
the owner of the Enterprise, to decide what to do 
with it. He would recommend to Hakim that the 
money, after expenses, be donated to the William 
Casey Fund for the support of the Contras.23? 
Likewise, North testified that he would send "that 
money, every nickel of it, to the Nicaraguan Resist-
ance, which was indeed the original purpose of set-
ting up all those non-U.S. government entities."231 
Hakim said that he was entitled to, and promised a 
substantial interest in, the Enterprise funds.232 Hakim 
recognized that North's view of who owned the funds 
differed from his but realized he would benefit either 
way?either he would profit from opening the trade 
door to Iran, or he would fight North for a share of 
the money. Hakim declared that if the United States 
had tried to end the Iran initiative, "I guarantee you 
that I would have put up a big fight to get as much as 
I could from that money before letting it g0."233 
Hakim also testified that "obligations" were still out-
standing to the Iranians who helped open the Second 
Channe1.234 
Section 7: Brunei Contribution 
If not for a typographical error, the Enterprise would 
have received an additional $10 million generated by 
U.S. Government efforts: the misdirected contribution 
from the Sultan of Brunei. 
In December 1985, Congress amended Boland to 
provide explicitly that solicitation by the State De-
partment of humanitarian aid for the Contras from 
third countries was not precluded. Solicitation of 
lethal assistance was not addressed.238 The National 
Security Planning Group decided to pursue such 
third-country funding at a meeting with the President 
on May 16, 1986. These funds would bridge the gap 
until the anticipated resumption of U.S. aid in the 
fal1.236 
The Administration estimated that the earliest that 
aid could be made available to the Contras through 
the normal appropriations channels was August or 
September 1986. In the face of continued House op-
position and the likelihood of a filibuster in the 
Senate, Secretary Shultz advocated seeking aid from 
third countries as the course of least resistance. He 
believed that it was highly improbable that Congress 
would support a reprogramming of some money from 
the Department of Defense for non-military aid to the 
Contras and he argued that it would be desirable to 
approach other countries.237 Secretary Shultz was 
asked to draw up a list of possible donors.288 
In discussions at the State Department following 
the National Security Planning Group meeting, Secre-
tary Shultz ruled out any countries receiving U.S. aid 
352 
or whose political relationship with the United States 
was otherwise delicate. The Secretary's criteria elimi-
nated all the obvious candidates, including nations in 
the Middle East.238 In early June, Assistant Secretary 
Elliott Abrams recommended the Sultanate of 
Brunei?a tiny, oil-rich nation on the northwest coast 
of Borneo?and the Department agreed.24? Abrams 
described how the selection was made: 
Take a list of countries in the world and exclude 
those with insufficient resources to make a hu-
manitarian contribution. Exclude further those 
which are right-wing dictatorships, or which are, 
if you will, on the other side, allied with the 
Soviet Union. Then exclude those . . . over 
which we can be said to have some leverage. 
You are left essentially with oil producers. Then 
look for non-Arab?since I had been to Ambassa-
dor Murphy already, non-Middle East non-Arab 
oil producers. Venezuela, I thought, would not 
do this. You are down to Brunei.241 
Since Secretary Shultz planned to travel to Asia in 
June 1986, Abrams was tasked with getting an appro-
priate account number in the event of a successful 
solicitation of Brunei for a contribution to the Con-
tras. Abrams approached North, who, with Poin-
dexter's concurrence, gave Abrams the number of the 
Enterprise's Lake Resources account in Switzerland. 
Abrams was not told that this was an account con-
trolled by North, Hakim, and Secord for disbursing 
lethal (not humanitarian) aid to the Contras.242 
But either North or his secretary made a mistake. 
In writing down the account number or in typing it, 
North or his secretary apparently inverted the first 
two digits, so that the correct account number at 
Credit Suisse, 386-430-22-1, became 368-430-22-1.243 
North gave Abrams a typed card containing the erro-
neous number and Abrams gave it to the Secretary of 
State.244 The Secretary of State was informed by 
Abrams that the account belonged to the Contras; 
Abrams said he had received that information from 
North.245 
The State Department then decided that Brunei 
would not be approached during the Secretary's June 
trip, although the Secretary carried with him to Asia 
the card containing the wrong number.248 
On August 5, Secretary Shultz directed Abrams to 
make contact with Brunei.247 Around this time, 
Abrams obtained a second account number from the 
Chief of the CIA Central American Task Force.248 
Abrams could not explain why he asked for this 
second account number.248 But once he obtained it, 
he had the problem of deciding which account to use, 
the one provided by the CIA or North. Charles Hill, 
Secretary Shultz's Executive Assistant, recommended 
that Abrams use the number from North because it

Chapter 22 
probably was cleaner.250 Ironically, the account 
Abrams received from the CIA was a Contra account 
established specifically to receive the expected contri-
bution. Had that account been used, the Contras 
would have received an additional $10 million. 
Abrams, carrying North's account number and 
using the cover name "Mr. Kenilworth," met with an 
official of Brunei in London on August 9, 1986, and 
successfully solicited a $10 million contribution for 
humanitarian aid. Abrams gave the Bruneian official 
the Swiss account number from North.25' 
On September 15, Brunei confirmed to the State 
Department that "arrangements have been consum-
mated." 252 But North advised Abrams three days 
later that no funds had been received.253 The State 
Department went back to Brunei and was told that 
transferring the funds would require the U.S. to "wait 
for a short while before the transaction is complet-
ed." 254 
By November, the funds still had not arrived in the 
Lake Resources account. This remained true as of 
November 25, when the Attorney General announced 
discovery of the diversion. On December 1, Secretary 
Shultz instructed Charles Hill to brief the State De-
partment's Legal Adviser, Abraham Sofaer, on the 
circumstances surrounding the solicitation. According 
to Sofaer, this was the first time he learned about the 
Brunei contribution. 255 
When he was informed of the Brunei contribution, 
Sofaer directed the U.S. Ambassador to advise the 
Brunei Government that if the funds were still under 
its control, they should be frozen.256 But on Decem-
ber 4, 1986, Brunei informed the State Department 
that it had sent the funds to the designated account in 
August and could not withdraw the transfer. Sofaer 
testified that on December 4, he received the approv-
al of officials at the Justice Department and the White 
House to approach the Swiss Ambassador in Wash-
ington with a request that all accounts related to Lake 
Resources and Oliver North be frozen. Simultaneous-
ly, he ordered a cable sent to the U.S. Ambassador in 
Switzerland instructing that the same request be 
made. The request became effective the following 
morning.257 The problem, however, was that nobody 
in Washington?not even Oliver North?knew where 
the Brunei funds had gone. A diplomatic coup had 
become a diplomatic fiasco. The fiasco continued into 
1987. 
With the assistance of Swiss authorities aided by 
the State Department, the Committees determined 
that the Brunei funds had ended up in the Credit 
Suisse account of a person described by the Swiss as a 
wealthy Swiss businessman involved in the shipping 
business who alleged that the $10 million flowed into 
his account in connection with a shipping transaction. 
The account-holder had withdrawn the $10 million 
transfer shortly after it arrived at Credit Suisse and 
placed it in a certificate of deposit at another Swiss 
bank in Geneva, where it had been collecting inter-
est.258 
In May 1987, the matter was placed in the hands of 
a Swiss Magistrate, who, with the Committees' en-
couragement, froze the certificate of deposit. The 
Government of Brunei was notified by the State De-
partment and asserted its claim. The Committees un-
derstand that, as of this writing, the $10 million has 
been returned to Brunei, but the interest remains 
frozen. 
Swiss authorities have declined to reveal the identi-
ty of the individual who received the funds. The 
Committees were assured by the Swiss Magistrate, 
however, that the individual is neither a principal in 
the investigation, nor related to any of the principals.

Chapter 22 
1. Hakim Dep., 5/22/87, at 66; Secord Test., Hearings, 
100-1, 5/7/87, at 166-67. CSF was established in September 
1971. According to a report by Credit Suisse dated October 
14, 1985, the wife of Willard Zucker holds all of the capital 
shares. The Credit Suisse report also states: "The company's 
goal is to give all advice on fiscal, financial, judicial and 
economic matters and handle all financial goods of the 
customer . . . The company would also take part or partici-
pate in any financial and real estate actions or enterprises." 
Among the officers of CSF are: Jean De Senarclens, Alfred 
Stohler, Willard Zucker and Roland Farina. CSF Invest-
ments, Ltd, a Bermuda Co. is an affiliate. EN 36-38. 
2. Zucker, living in Switzerland under the protections and 
obligations of Swiss secrecy law, refused to talk to the 
Committees. 
3. The Lake account provides an example. CSF estab-
lished the "Lake" bank account with a Swiss bank on July 
19, 1985. The account was opened in the name of Lake 
Resources Inc. Lake Resources Inc. was incorporated in 
Panama on May 14, 1985. The initial officers were three 
Swiss citizens associated with CSF. Thus, Lake Resources 
could perform all the functions of a corporation without 
giving any indication of its true owners. Summary of CSF 
Incorporation Records, 10/12/87, H6942-56. Even the 
names of the shareholders were protected. Apparently, CSF 
typically held the shares of the companies it manages pursu-
ant to a written agreement with the true owner. Summary 
of CSF Incorporation Records, H6954. 
4. Hakim Dep., 5/22/87, at 65; Wood Int., 8/12/87; Cas-

"[CSF's] association with STTGI, its associated and prede-
cessor companies, dates back to 1971." STG9141. 
5. Clark and Zink Dep., 7/6/87, at 29-34, 83. Through a 
brochure, STTGI claimed that it had a European office and 
that it could provide the type of services that CSF offered. 
In fact, the office address, telephone number, and telex 
number for the European office were CSF's and the serv-
ices offered appear to have been CSF's too, STGI34452-53. 
6. Hakim Dep., 5/23/87, at 97-99, 239; Secord memoran-
dum to Zucker, Subj: movement of funds, H1670; Secord 
Dep., 6/10/87, at 76. The STTGI phone records show calls 
to CSF which correspond with the movements of Enter-
prise funds through the CSF-managed Swiss accounts. Staff 
Memorandum Summarizing STTGI Phone Records, 10/6/ 
87, EN73-96. 
7. The Enterprise did not use conventional checks. If 
checks were required, wire transfers were made from the 
Enterprise network of accounts to a CSF account which in 
turn issued a check in CSF's name to the payee. See, e.g., 
Robinette Test., Hearings, 100-6, 6/23/87, at 12. The 
records supplied by Hakim indicate that CSF had bank 
accounts in the United States, Bermuda, Paris, and Brussels, 
and that CSF also held accounts in brokerage firms in 
several countries. CSF's account in the U.S. was maintained 
at Republic Bank of New York. 
8. Hakim indicated that on three occasions he was in-
volved in arrangements to pick up sums of $50,000 in cash 
in New York which he brought to Secord. Hakim was 
under the impression that Secord routed the money onward 
to the Contras. Hakim Dep., 5/23/87, at 166-67. Two 
Zucker business associates have indicated, through their 
lawyers, that Zucker arranged for them to drop off Contra-
354 
bound cash in amounts of $50,000 to Hakim, and a Hakim 
courier. Staff Memorandum on Zucker Cash Operations, 8/ 
13/87, EN56-68. Hakim also utilized his own sources. For 
example, Owen testified that he picked up cash from a store 
owner in New York which apparently was for the Contras. 
Owen, Test., Hearings, 100-2, 5/19/87, at 353. The store 
owner, who Hakim said was a friend of his, was reimbursed 
through a CSF check. Hakim Dep., 5/23/87, at 149. CRF

statements and credit advices, H6338-62. Hakim failed to 
provide a complete set of invoices from arms dealers, 
making it difficult to determine whether expenditures shown 
on the bank account statements -- and accounted for in the 
ledgers as weapons purchases -- were actually for weapons. 
Secord said he shredded some telexes related to Defex 
transactions sometime in November of 1986 as a security 
procedure. Secord Test., Hearings, 100-1, 5/7/87, at 197.

apparently inactive until it was used by the Enterprise. The 
company's first bank account was opened on December 21, 
1985 at Credit Suisse; the second account was opened on 
March 13, 1985, at Banco Portuguese in London; and the 
third account on April 19, 1985, at Banque Suisse. The

sales totaled "several hundred thousand dollars" and were 
held by CSF in his name. Secord Test., Hearings, 100-1, 5/ 
7/87, at 154, 164-65. The ledgers show that on 4/4/85, 
approximately $220,000 was transferred for "RVS" to CSF, 
and that in May 1986, CSF moved approximately the same 
sum into Korel Assets. Thus, it appears that the "RVS" 
marked money -- Secord's initial profits -- were moved into 
Korel Assets. General Ledger, H967; Fiduciary Ledger, 
H03076; Wire Records, H373, H372. Case 2: The bank 
account ledgers show a transfer marked "transfer RVS." 
The transfer can be traced directly to Korel Assets. Fiduci-

think it had to do with the family of the possible victims 
that somebody had to wiggle their bellybuttons . . . It is not 
referring to anyone's name . . . I said [to Zucker] somebody 
needs to go and wiggle the bellybutton of the families, the

to verify arms purchases, there is no doubt that payments 
described as commissions on the arms transactions were

bers of the Enterprise. Through a series of ledgers, fiduciary 
agreements, and wire records, CSF documented the distri-
bution of funds to members of the Enterprise.

the commissions distributed for the stranded shipment, 
Hakim did do so. Secord Letter, SC04081-105; Hakim Dep., 
5/23/87, at 19. The profit estimated by the Committees for 
these shipments is $300,000 higher than that estimated by 
Secord/Hakim.

178. See Table 22-5, Commissions on Arms Sales to the 
Contras; Hakim Dep., 5/22/87, at 88-89. Exactly whom 
Hakim was trying to confuse and what he was trying to 
accomplish is not clear. On the CSF books, payments to 
Defex SA (the fake arms account) would appear to depress 
profits that the Enterprise actually made on the arms sales 
and thus mislead an uninformed reader. 
179. Hakim Test., Hearings, 100-5, 6/5/87, at 20-21. 
Secord claimed that the cost of the weapons was about $2.4 
million. Secord letter, SC04184. Committee accountants 
could only identify $2.2 million in weapons costs for the 
stranded shipment in the CSF ledgers. 
180. Secord Test., Hearings, 100-1, 5/7/87, at 191; Hakim 
Dep., 5/22/87, at 156-62; Id. at 161.

52-56. 
182. See Table 22-4, Mark-Up on Arms Purchased For 
the Contras According to CSF Ledgers. Secord testified 
that commissions were distributed in a 40/40/20 ratio 
(Secord, Hakim, Clines) and Hakim indicated that on the 
later arms shipments the ratio was 30/30/30/10 (Secord, 
Hakim, Clines, and Scitech); Secord Test., Hearings, 100-1, 
at 53; Hakim Dep., 5/22/87, at 147-48. 
The ledgers show that the total sum of money distributed 
to Korel, Hakim, and C. Tea during February 1985 to mid-
December 1985 equaled a 32/33/21/14 ratio among Korel, 
Hakim, C. Tea and Scitech/STTGI, which is equivalent to 
a 39/40/21 ratio when one splits the STTGI/Scitech distri-
bution among Korel and Hakim. While most of the relevant 
ledger entries describing the distributions simply stated 
"transfer," the last distribution in the period contained a 
notation "Bal. of Act. for Phases 
On December 17, 1985, there was a simultaneous distribu-
tion, marked in the ledgers as "Profit Distribution Phase 
IV," to Korel, Hakim, and Clines, in a 40/40/20 ratio; in 
addition, there were four other simultaneous 1986 distribu-
tions: May 20, June 3, June 20, and August 27, all of which 
fell in the 30/30/30/10 pattern described by Hakim. A Feb-
ruary 7, 1986, distribution was made in basically a 50/50 
ratio between Korel and Hakim. Hakim indicated that this 
was a commission payment. 
The balance of the distributions shown in the ledgers 
from December 17, 1985, to the end of the active days of 
the Enterprise -- $2.1 million -- did not fall into any pattern, 
and, except for some very minor amounts, did not include 
Clines. 
Secord told the Committees the total amount of profit the 
Enterprise made on each arms shipment and roughly the 
date of each arms transaction. Using this information, the 
Committees correlated the commission distribution to each 
arms shipment.

237. At a White House interagency meeting the week of 
May 12, the group (comprised of officials of the CIA, 
Defense, and State), recommended that the Administration 
consider an immediate reprogramming of $15M from De-
fense to CIA for non-military assistance to the Contras 
($5M per month through August, 1986). Contrary to the 
conclusion reached by Secretary Shultz on May 16, the 
group concluded there was "a reasonable likelihood of suc-
cess" of securing the support of the Senate and House 
Intelligence Committees for the reprogramming option.

Chapter 23 
Other Privately Funded Covert Operations 
Under the plan that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North attrib-
uted to Director of Central Intelligence William 
Casey, profits from the Iran arms sales were to fund 
not just the Contras, but other covert operations of 
the Enterprise as well. Before the Iran arms sales 
became public, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North had begun 
implementing certain projects he and Casey believed 
the Enterprise could perform. 
"We always assumed," North said later "that there 
would come a time again, as indeed it did, where the 
Congress would make available the moneys necessary 
to support the Nicaraguan freedom fighters." When 
that happened, the Enterprise, functioning free of 
government scrutiny and with ample funds, could 
carry out other covert projects; many were intended 
"to be conducted jointly [with] . . . other friendly 
intelligence services" while others would be limited 
to activities conducted by North, Secord and Hakim.2 
Even before the Enterprise was formed, however, 
North was operating with non-appropriated funds on 
another project that the Government could not do 
because it was contrary to United States policy?the 
ransom of the hostages. 
The DEA Ransom Operation 
Before the Iran initiative was conceived, the NSC 
staff was working on a plan to ransom the hostages. 
Confronted with the policy of the U.S. Government 
of not paying for the hostages release, North found a 
loophole by using private funds. 
Edward V. Hickey, Jr., an Assistant to the Presi-
dent, attended a meeting of the Terrorist Incident 
Working Group (TIWG) in January 1985. Hickey 
noted that the area in Lebanon, where the hostages 
were held, was a known area of narcotics trafficking. 
Hickey had a personal interest in the hostages. He 
had known William Buckley, the CIA Chief of Sta-
tion in Beirut who had been kidnapped on March 16, 
1984. 
Hickey asked his long-time friend, a DEA Special 
Agent (Agent 1), if DEA could help to locate Buck-
ley and the other hostages. Agent 1 reported that 
another DEA Special Agent (Agent 2) had contacts 
in the Middle East who might be able to help. Shortly 
thereafter, Agents 1 and 2 met with Hickey and Hick-
ey's military aid General Matthew Caulfield. Agent 2 
told Hickey that he had an excellent source with 
impressive contacts in Lebanon.3 
Following this meeting, Hickey met with Deputy 
National Security Adviser John Poindexter and en-
couraged him to include the DEA in the Hostage 
Locating Task Force (HLTF).4 On February 13, 
1985, National Security Adviser McFarlane notified 
the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice and 
the CIA that the Task Force would report to the 
TIWG and it would include the DEA.6 The DEA 
was to be represented on the Task Force by Abraham 
Azzam, an Arabic speaking agent of Lebanese herit-
age.6 Funding for the Task Force would come from 
the CIA.7 
With the approval of DEA Administrator Mullen, 
the DEA provided Agents 1 and 2 with $20,000 for 
travel, expenses and for payments to their sources for 
information on the hostages.8 If the DEA's sources 
were productive, they were to be turned over to the 
CIA for further operational handling. Agents 1 and 2 
were instructed to report to Azzam, who in turn was 
to report to DEA Deputy John Lawn.3 
Agents 1 and 2 were not to be involved operation-
ally in securing the release of the hostages; their func-
tion was to assist in obtaining intelligence information 
regarding the location of the hostages.' ? According 
to Lawn, he gave these instructions because Federal 
law provides that DEA's responsibility is for oper-
ations that concern drug-related law enforcement." 
(See Figure 23-1.) 
In February 1985, Azzam, Agent 1, and Agent 2 
met with Agent 2's source in Geneva and in New 
York. The source claimed that he had contacts who 
could arrange to pay off individuals in Lebanon who 
had enough influence over the captors to arrange for 
the release or escape of the hostages. He added that 
$50,000 was needed to begin operations," and that 
the hostages could be released if the United States 
sold weapons, tanks, airplanes, and other military 
equipment to those controlling the holders of the hos-
tages. Oliver North, the NSC staff member responsi-
ble for terrorism issues, later told the agents the 
United States could not sell weapons."

Chapter 23 
Under the Task Force authorization, the CIA was 
to pay for hostage information. But the CIA was 
reluctant to do so without proof that Agent 2's source 
was legitimate and would produce valuable informa-
tion. Agent 1, Agent 2, Hickey, and Caulfield then 
met with Poindexter to explain their need for funds. 
Poindexter told them he would look into the 
matter.' 4 
In early March 1985, Hickey arranged a meeting 
among North, Agent 1, Agent 2, Azzam, and Caul-
field. At the meeting, the agents explained their ef-
forts to North and informed him that the CIA was 
reluctant to provide the money." In a follow-up 
phone call to North on March 12, 1985, Caulfield said 
the DEA's efforts were "not very sophisticated."16 
He explained that the plan now called for four hos-
tages to be released in exchange for $1 million per 
hostage, once the $50,000 was paid to the source." 
North's notes of the conversation reflected his own 
reaction: "fundamental decision: Do we pay 
ransom?"" North answered his own question with 
his actions: he became the operational leader of the 
project.' 9 
Soon thereafter, the DEA agents arranged for two 
CIA officers to meet Agent 2's source in New York. 
The two officers were sufficiently convinced of the 
value of the source to authorize the $50,000 expendi-
ture from the CIA." Agent 1 received the money on 
March 18 from a CIA officer and signed a form 
acknowledging that he was responsible to account for 
it." Agent 1 paid the money to the source in two 
installments: $20,000 on March 19, and $30,000 on 
April 20, after the source had returned from a trip to 
Lebanon. 22 
On May 2, 1985, upon the source's return from 
another trip to Lebanon, he told the agents that he 
now needed to give $200,000 to his contact, who 
would locate Buckley and obtain proof that he was 
still alive. After that payment, the source said, it 
would take an additional $1 million per hostage to 
secure their release. 
Azzam became concerned when he learned that the 
source's contact was known to the DEA as a narcot-
ics trafficker and a thief." 
Azzam voiced his concerns to CIA officials who 
agreed that the $200,000 should not be paid until the 
source produced proof that his contacts had access to 
Buckley. The proof was to consist of photographs of 
the hostage with current newspapers, or similar items, 
showing the date of the proof." 
North told Azzam he could get the ransom money 
of $1 million per hostage. When Azzam asked North 
where he would get it, North asked him not to in-
quire." Azzam surmised correctly that North was 
planning to get the money from H. Ross Perot, a 
Texas industrialist." Azzam told this to the CIA offi-
cers. The next day, North called Azzam to express his 
anger that Azzam had told the CIA. Azzam could not 
understand North's anger. He believed that the CIA 
was to be a full partner given that DEA could not 
legally have any operational capabilities." Reported-
ly, Perot was upset that his role had been compro-
mised and complained to Poindexter and McFarlane. 
In early May 1985, the source went to Lebanon to 
obtain the required proof while Agents 1 and 2 
waited in Cyprus. The source produced a document 
that allegedly was proof of access to Buckley." 
Azzam directed Agent 1 to bring the document to 
him for verification by expert analysts from the CIA 
and FBI laboratories. Despite these instructions, 
Agent 1 presented the "proof' first to North, a signal 
in Azzam's eyes that Agents 1 and 2 regarded North 
as their principal supervisor." 
On May 14, 1985, Azzam and Agent 1 took the 
document to the CIA. The Agency found the evi-
dence unacceptable.3? The CIA and FBI technical 
reports which were produced two weeks later were 
inconclusive.3' 
Because the first evidence the source produced was 
at best inconclusive and at worst fabricated, the CIA 
developed a series of questions to the hostages only 
they could answer." When the source refused to 
return to Lebanon and submit the questions, the CIA 
and Azzam declined to authorize the $200,000.33 Ac-
cording to the CIA's Deputy Director for Operations, 
Clair George, the plan was a "scam, a fake" nothing 
more than "hocus pocus." 34 
North Continues the Initiative 
Notwithstanding this account of their source, 
Agents 1 and 2 urged North to continue working 
with them." On May 22, 1985, according to North's 
notes, the two Agents assured North that their source 
could produce the hostages if given $200,000 for pay-
ments to officials in Lebanon and $2 million for two 
hostages." The agents explained that they needed to 
change their operating procedures: they wanted to 
report directly to the NSC staff to get the DEA "off 
their backs." 37 They advised North to contact DEA 
Administrator Lawn or Attorney General Meese di-
rectly to ensure that they could proceed without in-
terference.38 
On June 7, 1985, in a memo to McFarlane, North 
detailed the DEA operation. He wrote that, "at the 
request of the two DEA officers who originated the 
contact in Lebanon, I met with their asset [source] in 
Washington . . ." 29 North informed McFarlane that 
the $2,200,000 would be provided by a "donor," but 
that "travel arrangements and operational costs are 
currently being financed from funds normally avail-
able to the Nicaraguan resistance." He added that 
"our normal point-of-contact of these matters is not 
yet aware." 40 North's disclosure that private money 
raised for the benefit of the Contras was available to 
support the DEA operation is consistent with a state-
ment he made at the time to Clair George, who 
recalled:

Chapter 23 
011ie North always sort of implied when we 
were talking about the hostages that if I ever 
thought that I needed money and that policy 
dictated it, but I didn't want to take it from CIA 
funds because they are Congressionally con-
trolled, he could get money.4' 
Finally, North recommended in the memorandum 
that McFarlane approve the plan and ask the Attor-
ney General to detail Agents 1 and 2 to the NSC for 
30 days. McFarlane initialed the "approve" line at the 
bottom of the memo. McFarlane handwrote just 
under the approve line, "North to follow up 6/10 
with AG." 42 
McFarlane testified that he did not realize the full 
meaning of North's memorandum regarding his use of 
funds "normally available" to the Contras. "To tell 
you the truth," McFarlane testified, "it is my own 
oversight. . . . If I had been careful about reading 
[North's memorandum] I would have [understood its 
true significance]." 43 McFarlane testified that he 
never asked North whether he was getting money 
from Calero to assist in the release of the hostages. "I 
didn't, but I should have, and I just missed this. 
That's all," he explained. "I thought it was all coming 
from a private U.S. citizen." 44 Poindexter, however, 
knew the source of the funds. He stated that North 
told him the money was coming from Calero con-
trolled funds that had been contributed to the Con-
tras.45 
Around June 10, North prepared a memorandum 
for Attorney General Meese describing how the DEA 
agents would deposit the $200,000 and open an ac-
count for the remaining $2 million, which was to be 
provided by the "donor to bribe those in control of 
the hostages." North asked the Attorney General to 
assign the DEA agents to "this organization [NSC 
staff] for a period not to exceed 30 days." 46 Attorney 
General Meese complied with North's request.47 That 
assignment would last for over one year. 
Once the DEA agents were assigned to North, they 
reported directly to him, except for occasional, curso-
ry briefings to Lawn." They wrote no reports of 
their activities and made no entries in the DEA in-
formant files regarding contacts with their sources. 
Further, they immediately destroyed their notes after 
orally reporting to North.49 
The agents embarked on the operation as planned. 
In late May, Jay Coburn, an employee of H. Ross 
Perot, had delivered $200,000 in cash to North and 
Agent 1 without obtaining a receipt.5? North placed 
the money in his office safe and told Agent 1 that a 
nongovernmental employee would have to handle the 
money." Agent 1 suggested his brother, who had 
experience in security matters.52 The plan called for 
Agent 1 and his brother to meet with their source on 
Cyprus and for the brother to give him the money. If 
everything went well, they would arrange for the $2 
million to be deposited and available for "contacts," 
364 
who would arrange the release and transportation of 
two hostages. 
True to the plan, North gave the brother the 
$200,000 in cash and $11,000 in Calero traveler's 
checks for expenses.53 Agent 1 and his brother trav-
elled to Cyprus in late June of 1985, where the broth-
er gave the source the $200,000 to take to Lebanon. 
Two unrelated events then intervened: the hijack-
ing on June 14, 1985, of TWA flight 847 by Lebanese 
terrorists, and in early June the death of one of the 
source's contacts in Lebanon.54 As a result, the DEA 
source claimed to be leery about approaching anyone 
associated with the hostage holders. The source, after 
a trip to Lebanon, reported that the hostages possibly 
could be freed in exchange for arms.55 The agents 
concluded that this was not feasible." Ironically, this 
same course was about to be pursued by the United 
States in the Iran initiative. 
Late 1985 and Early 1986: North 
Presses On 
In December 1985, Charles Allen of the CIA 
became Chairman of the Hostage Location Task 
Force.57 Allen already was involved in the Iranian 
initiative. North also recruited an Army Major of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, who had an intelligence 
background in the Middle East. North or Allen then 
picked the Major to serve as "team leader or chief of 
staff, organizer, et cetera." 58 
The first meeting of the Task Force took place on 
December 23, 1985, and included were Allen, North, 
the Major, and others representing various federal 
agencies and departments." Agents 1 and 2 were not 
made an official part of the Task Force, but North 
advised the Task Force that Agents 1 and 2 
would be useful sources for "intelligence and special 
projects." 60 
The Major described Agents I and 2 as "street 
toughs in camel hair coats," 61 who were "street-
smart but not very knowledgeable of other federal 
agencies . . . outside their own, nor knowledgeable 
certainly in any way, shape or form, about Middle 
East or international relations or politics or the mili-
tary." 62 At their first meeting, the DEA agents told 
the Major and Allen that they did not want to deal 
with the Operations Directorate at the CIA; Allen 
told them that the Major would be their CIA con-
tact.63 
On January 14, 1986, Agent 1 and the Major went 
to New York to meet with and evaluate a new DEA 
"source," who, if acceptable, would be paid from 
CIA funds." On January 28, 1986, the Major report-
ed to North his reservations about the source and the 
whole operation. North said that he liked the DEA 
agents because they were "action oriented." From 
that point on, the Major sensed that North was delib-
erately keeping him uninformed." Allen testified that 
he believed the DEA agents were working only to

Chapter 23 
obtain intelligence information and were not involved 
operationally in hostage-release activities.66 
In January 1986, the Major expressed to Allen his 
concern regarding the propriety of using money to 
gain the hostages' release. Allen replied that North 
had told him that the President had said he would 
"go to Leavenworth if necessary" to free the hos-
tages.67 The Major also recalled that in March 1986, 
while Allen and the Major were generally discussing 
how to finance efforts to free the hostages, Allen 
commented that, "011ie was already into his Contra 
money for the hostages. . . ." 68 The Major did not 
pursue this remark.6 9 
In late April 1986, the Major submitted a paper to 
North analyzing a range of options to gain the release 
of the hostages.7? When the Major met with North to 
present his paper, he urged North to abandon any 
effort to gain the release of the hostages by providing 
arms to Iran." Indeed, his paper warned that a fac-
tion in Iran might leak such a sale "simply to embar-
rass the present Administration." 72 North was non-
committal and "made no comment on [the Major's] 
noting that it was against official U.S. policy . . . 
[and] encouraged terrorism." 7 3 In late May 1986, the 
Major left the Task Force.74 
The DEA Agents Become Operational 
Again 
In May 1986, at the very time that North was 
preparing to accompany McFarlane to Tehran, he 
continued to work with the DEA agents to ransom 
the hostages for $1 million each. When the plan final-
ly was executed, it occurred simultaneously with the 
McFarlane mission to Tehran.'" 
In May, Agent 1 was in Cyprus working on a 
hostage rescue plan with the new DEA source. He 
called Agent 2 in the United States and requested 
more money: $20,000 for the source and $10,000 for 
Agent l's expenses.76 Agent 2 asked North, who then 
turned to the Enterprise. North gave Agent 2 the 
telephone number of Albert Hakim, Secord's associ-
ate, in Geneva. 
A DEA Agent ("Agent 3") called upon Hakim in 
Switzerland. He gave Agent 3 $30,000 cash in bills 
wrapped in Credit Suisse bands, without a receipt.77 
Agent 3 gave the money to Agent 1, who took it to 
Cyprus." The DEA agents were to rent speed boats 
as a diversion and North was to obtain assistance 
from the U.S. Sixth Fleet." 
According to the new plan, certain Lebanese ele-
ments would be paid $1 million to rescue each hos-
tage. Once the hostages were freed, it was decided 
they would be taken by the Enterprise ship Erria to 
Cyprus. While the Enterprise provided the expense 
money, North turned once again to H. Ross Perot for 
funding of the ransom. In June 1986, Jay Coburn, 
Perot's aide, flew to Cyprus in a private plane. 
Coburn was to provide $2 minium upon the release of 
the hostages." After Coburn arrived, Clines appeared 
in Cyprus with the Erria, but the plan collapsed: the 
contacts demanded the money before releasing the 
hostages, but the DEA agents refused to pay until the 
hostages were freed.81 
Soon after the June 1986, DEA mission failed, 
North told McFarlane that Perot had complained that 
he lost his money on the operation, and that North 
had failed to keep him informed. North asked McFar-
lane to mollify Perot. McFarlane eventually saw 
Perot and asked him "not to be too hard on 011ie." 82 
In addition, a letter was addressed to Perot from the 
President, dated June 11, 1986, stating: 
I have been briefed on your effort over the past 
several weeks on behalf of our Americans ab-
ducted in Beirut. On behalf of the American 
people, I want to thank you for your discreet 
assistance in this regard. My hope is that we may 
yet succeed in reuniting these men with their 
families and loved ones. Thanks again and God 
bless you. 82 a 
In August and September 1986, Agent 1 called 
North about two possible sources on the hostages. 
North told Agent 1 he could not "touch them" and 
referred him to Dewey Clarridge at the CIA. On 
October 14, 1986, North met with Lawn. North ex-
pressed his appreciation for the DEA agents' efforts, 
but acknowledged that their efforts had failed." With 
that, U.S. efforts to ransom the hostages ended." 
The Attorney General's Role 
Throughout the DEA operation, private funds 
were used to pay the expenses of the agents and to 
provide the ransom money. Yet, as discussed in Chap-
ter 27, the use of nonappropriated funds to finance 
Government operations is inconsistent with the provi-
sions of the Constitution requiring that all monies 
spent by the Government be appropriated by Con-
gress. Numerous statutes and governmental account-
ing rules implement this principle. A government offi-
cial receiving money for the government from any 
source must deposit it in the Treasury;" government 
agencies may not accept gifts of money absent specif-
ic statutory authorization;" and government employ-
ees may not receive private funds for the performance 
of their governmental duties." To violate these laws 
creates an obvious conflict of interest for the agents as 
well as privatizing governmental functions. The use of 
private money to finance the DEA operation broke 
each of these rules. 
The evidence points toward the conclusion that the 
Attorney General approved the use of private funds 
for the ransom/resource operations. According to 
McFarlane, North was informed by the Attorney 
General that it was acceptable for Perot to contribute 
money to be used to bribe public officials and other

individuals in Lebanon. McFarlane stated that Attor-
ney General Meese explicitly had approved this 
action and told him he was "keeping an eye on it." 88 
North's testimony confirms McFarlane's account. 
North stated that he understood from the Attorney 
General that "we couldn't use U.S. Government 
monies for those purposes [but] we could use outside 
monies." North also recalled informing the Attorney 
General of the source of the money." Attorney Gen-
eral Meese, however, maintained that he was not 
aware of a "plan to use private funds to ransom 
people in foreign countries," 90 nor did he recall ad-
dressing the issue of using appropriated or unappro-
priated funds to conduct the activity." 
McFarlane testified that Attorney General Meese 
had advised that while Government funds could not 
be used, private monies could be used to bribe foreign 
officials to free the hostages.92 Agent 2 testified that 
Lawn told him that the Attorney General had person-
ally approved Agent 2's participation in the NSC 
hostage effort.93 Agent 2 told the Committees that 
Lawn had given him instructions that the DEA 
agents not handle the private money personally.94 
Agent 1 stated that North gave him the money-han-
dling instructions and attributed them to the Attorney 
Genera1.96 
The Attorney General denied knowing of the spe-
cifics of Perot's involvement in the plan,97 although 
his telephone logs reflect some contact with Perot 
during 1985. Then, on November 26, 1986, after the 
diversion became public, the Attorney General tele-
phoned Perot. A note taken by Meese's aide on De-
cember 3, 1986, reflects an instruction by the Attor-
ney General to call Perot to check on whether he 
would respond that the Attorney General knew of or 
authorized the payments.98 
Administrator Lawn's testimony regarding his 
knowledge of using private money to ransom the hos-
tages also contradicted documentary evidence. Lawn 
at first testified that he was never told that the money 
would be paid by a private donor.99 Lawn was then 
shown a copy of his handwritten notes of a briefing 
of the plan by Agent 2 which reads, in part: "donor 
money, not CIA;" "facilitators will not handle funds;" 
and "contact with donor." 100 Lawn then admitted 
that "obviously I was told that there was donor 
money and I was obviously told that it was not CIA 
money. I don't recall hearing that. I don't recall re-
cording that. But this obviously is my handwrit-
ing." 101 As to the notations that the agents would 
not themselves handle the private funds but only fa-
cilitate the delivery of the funds, Lawn admitted: "I 
assume that I was told. I am sorry, I just don't recol-
lect having been told." 102 
Policy Considerations Were ignored . 
President Reagan repeatedly has stated since 1981 
that the United States would not pay ransom to ter-
366 
rorists who kidnapped Americans,'" a policy ad-
hered to by Administrations of both parties over the 
years. There are practical reasons for such a policy. 
Clair George, the Deputy Director for Operations, 
stated: "You don't trade for hostages . . . because now 
everybody is going to sell them for something." 104 
Former Deputy Director of the CIA, John McMahon 
stated that ransom payments could become a source 
of funds for terrorists. When they "run out of funds, 
they would kidnap the nearest U.S. businessman, get a 
ransom and then they'd fill their coffers for a year. 
When they needed more, they would ransom another 
one." 105 
The DEA operation had all these shortcomings 
plus an additional one: it was inconsistent with the 
simultaneous effort to gain the release of the hostages 
through the Iran initiative. It is reasonable to believe 
that the Lebanese hostage holders would be less likely 
to release the hostages at the request of Iran, at the 
same time as they were being offered $1 million per 
hostage in the DEA initiative. 
There was little consideration of these factors. The 
DEA initiative was not discussed at a meeting of the 
NSC; there were no policy papers; and no consulta-
tion with the Secretaries of Defense and State.1" 
Secord summed up the process when he testified that 
"it did not occur to me at the time that these two 
[efforts] clashed," but he acknowledged that "they 
could have collided." 107 Some on the NSC staff 
characterized the payments to the hostages holders as 
"bribes" not ransom, and the operation as a rescue, 
not a payoff. 
The Other Operations 
Israel 
During the 1985-1986 winter, North set into motion a 
series of projects involving Israel. These took advan-
tage of the close working relationship North had de-
veloped with his counterpart in the Israeli Govern-
ment, Amiram Nir, Adviser to Prime Minister Peres 
on combatting terrorism. 
North and Nir had similar backgrounds in working 
for their respective governments: both believed in un-
orthodox tactics when dealing with terrorism. Ac-
cording to North, Nir broached the idea for joint 
operations during a trip to the United States in Janu-
ary 1986. Nir carried a proposal, according to North, 
that the profits Israel would generate from the Iranian 
arms sales would be used, in part, for a series of 
covert operations.'" These would include gathering 
intelligence on terrorist groups, seeking the release of 
hostages, initiating and financing propaganda efforts 
that would be operated covertly.'" North recorded 
in his notebooks that Nir had suggested on January 9 
that, from the sale of the first 1,000 TOWs to Iran for 
$10 million, $2.5 million would be dedicated for

Chapter 23 
"Ops." "? Each project received a code name in the 
sequence TH-1, TH-2, and so on. North told the 
Committees that the projects had not progressed 
beyond the planning stage and, therefore, he did not 
seek a Presidential Finding authorizing any of these 
operations.'" 
North testified that he discussed the Enterprise's 
role in these projects with Poindexter, but Poindexter 
said he did not recall such a conversation."2 The 
only evidence that the President knew of these sensi-
tive projects appears in a September 15, 1986, memo-
randum from North to Poindexter. North asked Poin-
dexter to brief the President on certain initiatives, 
including one of the proposed joint U.S.-Israeli covert 
operations. An attachment to the memorandum which 
North suggested should be briefed to Casey stated 
that "covert funds could be made available" for this 
operation, but the source of the funds was not dis-
closed.113 Poindexter noted on the memorandum that 
he approved North's recommendation to brief the 
President on these operations and that it was "done." 
Poindexter testified that he did not know or tell the 
President that the covert funds referred to by North 
were coming from the Enterprise."4 
The Lebanese Operation 
Another initiative undertaken by North involved 
the use of DEA and Israeli contacts to fund and equip 
a force in Lebanon. North described the proposed 
force as part of a "long term operation" to give the 
United States some future military leverage on the 
ground in Lebanon.115 
North sent Poindexter a PROF note in June 1986 
about Secord's progress in working with a Lebanese 
group on a hostage rescue operation: "After the CIA 
took so long to organize and then botched the Kil-
burn effort, Copp [Secord] undertook to see what 
could be done through one of the earlier DEA devel-
oped [Lebanese] contacts. Dick [Secord] has been 
working with Nir on this, and now has three people 
in Beirut and a 40-man . . . force working for us. 
Dick rates the possibility of success on this operation 
as 30% but that's better than nothing." 116 In closed 
testimony before the Committees, North indicated 
that the project was never carried out even though 
"we spent a fairly significant amount of money 
on . . . [this additional] DEA operation." "7 
Peter Kilburn, a 60-year-old librarian at the Ameri-
can University in Beirut, was kidnapped on Novem-
ber 30, 1984. U.S. sources believed that, unlike the 
other hostages, Kilburn was being held by a criminal 
faction in Lebanon. At one point in the fall of 1985, 
North had contemplated allocating Enterprise funds 
to support an operation intended to free him."5 The 
plan was terminated when Kilburn was murdered al-
legedly by agents of Mu'ammar Qaddafi shortly after 
the American air raid on Libya in April 1986. 
Other Countries 
Other projects contemplated by North involved 
aiding anticommunist resistance groups around the 
world. North told the Committees that he and Direc-
tor Casey "had several discussions about making what 
he called off-the-shelf, self-generating activities that 
would be able to do a number of these things. He had 
mentioned specifically an ongoing operation." In addi-
tion, North testified, "I concluded within my own 
mind the fact that it might require [other ongoing] 
operations [as well]." 119 In testimony before the 
Committees, North explained his motivation for assist-
ing resistance groups. "We cannot be seen . . . in the 
world today as walking away and leaving failure in 
our wake. We must be able to demonstrate, not only 
in Nicaragua, but . . . elsewhere where freedom 
fighters have been told, we will support you, we must 
be able to continue to do so." 120 
In April 1986, North asked Secord and his partner 
Albert Hakim to use $100,000 from the Lake Re-
sources Swiss accounts to purchase conventional 
radio phone equipment for donation to a political 
party in a foreign country. On April 29, two repre-
sentatives of a U.S. manufacturer met in Miami with 
Secord and one of Secord's associates, and the pur-
chasing agent for the political party. At the meeting, 
the purchasing agent agreed to buy $100,000 of the 
radio equipment, and Secord?upon North's request?
arranged for the Enterprise to wire this amount to the 
manufacturer. 
The Erria 
Another of North's projects involved the purchase 
by the Enterprise of the M/V Erria, a small coastal 
freighter of Danish registry used to transport goods 
between Europe and the Middle East. The Erria, built 
in 1973, was small, only 163 feet long, and weighed 
710 tons.12' Before its purchase, the Erria was owned 
by its captain, Arne Herup.122 
In 1984 and 1985, the Erria was used to run weap-
ons to the Persian Gulf and then to Nigeria and 
Central America. Because of its Danish registry, the 
Erria, was able to escape the scrutiny of customs 
officials.122 a "When we ended up needing a ship to 
perform a certain task," recalled North, "there was 
nowhere to get one on short notice, and so this orga-
nization [the Enterprise] produced it practically over-
night." Poindexter testified that Secord offered the 
ship because the Department of Defense could not 
provide a ship suitable for the covert operation.'" 
According to North, Casey said "we can't find one 
anywhere else, get a ship. It didn't cost the taxpayers 
of the United States a cent." 124 The money came 
from the Iran arms sales and other Enterprise funds. 
The Erria first came to the attention of the Enter-
prise in April 1985, when it carried arms purchased 
through Secord to the Contras. En route to Central

Chapter 23 
America, the Erria came under surveillance by an 
unidentified "fishing boat" which Captain Herup as-
sumed was Cuban.123 Herup took evasive action and 
brought the cargo successfully to a Central American 
country.126 Herup's actions impressed Secord's asso-
ciate, Thomas Clines, and when North needed a ship 
in April 1986, for covert operations, Clines suggested 
to Hakim that the Enterprise purchase the Erria from 
Herup, and keep him as Captain. 
Hakim bought the ship for $312,000 through 
Dolmy Business, Inc., one of the Panamanian compa-
nies owned by the Enterprise, on April 28, 1986.127 
Herup was asked to remain as captain for at least six 
months, with Danish agent Tom Parlow of SA Char-
tering continuing as the ship's agent. Hakim and 
Clines told Herup that they were working for the 
CIA and that at some future date they might ask him 
to transport technical equipment for covert oper-
ations. They promised that when the project was fin-
ished, the ship would be returned to Herup at no cost. 
The Proposed Charter to the CIA for a 
Covert Operation 
The first mission North contemplated for the Erria 
was for an extended covert operation. On April 28, 
1986, Secord sent a KL-43 message to North propos-
ing that the CIA charter the vessel for that purpose: 
44. . ? Abe [Hakim] still in Copenhagen with our 
lawyer finalizing purchase of ship. Deal has been 
made after three days of negotiation. The Danish cap-
tain is up and eager for the mission?he now works 
for us. We are asking . . . [of the CIA] for firm fixed 
price contract of $1.2 million for six months. He will 
probably balk at this price . . .09127a 
As Secord predicted, the Agency felt the rate was 
excessive (several times the prevailing rate for similar 
assets) and it balked at chartering the ship. In addi-
tion, the CIA informed North that it was not interest-
ed on technical grounds and that it did not feel that 
security could be maintained because of the ship's 
previous use by North's associates to ferry arms to 
Central America. The Agency indicated that Tom 
Clines' involvement was a negative factor of major 
proportions.128 
North persisted in his efforts to have the CIA lease 
the ship. He then enlisted Poindexter's help. In a May 
14 memorandum, Vincent M. Cannistraro of the SC 
staff urged Poindexter to take the matter up with 
Casey: 
Status of 011ie's Ship. 011ie has offered the use of 
a Danish vessel for [a covert operation]. He first 
offered CIA a six month lease. CIA told me that 
they thought it was too expensive, and the cost 
and time involved in refitting the vessel for [the] 
mission made the alternative option . . . more 
attractive. 011ie then offered to [perform the mis-
sion] using his own resources. [C/NE] has told 
368 
me that because of the alleged involvement of 
one Tom Clines (who was involved with Wilson 
and Terpil), CIA will have nothing to do with 
the ship.129 
In the end, Casey supported Clair George's deci-
sion that the ship was not suitable for Agency use. 
The Odyssey of the Erria 
On May 9, 1986, the Erria commenced its oper-
ations under its new owners, the Enterprise. The ship 
was to travel to pick up technical equipment for a 
covert operation. 
On May 16 Herup was ordered to abort the mission 
and return to Larnaca, Cyprus. The new plan for the 
ship was to pick up any American hostages released 
as a result of the DEA initiative. En route to Lar-
naca, Herup received instructions to take up a posi-
tion off the coast of Lebanon and to await further 
directions.139 
As described earlier in this Chapter, the DEA hos-
tage ransom plan failed. Accordingly, after a 48-hour 
wait, Hakim ordered the ship to sail on to Larnaca. 
On June 5, Herup received instructions to head for 
Gibraltar, but at the last moment the ship was divert-
ed to Cagliari, Sardinia. From there, he was told to 
take the ship to Setubal, Portugal, to await an arms 
cargo from Defex. The cargo at Setubal was not 
ready for loading, and Herup was instructed to return 
to Copenhagen, where he arrived on July 4.13' 
The Erria then was ordered to Szczecin, Poland, 
where it arrived on July 10. The cargo it picked up 
was marked "machine parts," but actually consisted of 
158 tons of Communist-bloc weapons, including AK-
47 assault rifles, hand grenades, mortars, and a variety 
of ammunition.132 The shipment was consigned to 
Energy Resources International, an Enterprise compa-
ny. 
The Erria's next stop was Setubal, Portugal, where 
on July 19, it loaded an additional 222 tons of arms 
from Defex Portugal in the presence of Parlow and 
Clines.133 Herup was told to set his course for a 
Central American port. According to Hakim, the total 
cargo, which he called the "stranded shipment," cost 
$1.7 million;134 Secord placed the cost at about $2.4 
million.'" En route to Central America, Parlow 
called Herup and told him to stop the ship: Congress 
was in the process of repealing the Boland Amend-
ment. The vessel sat in the water for 4 days. Captain 
Herup then was ordered to return to Portugal, where 
he was met by Clines.' 36 
The Enterprise decided to find a buyer for the 380-
ton cargo of arms now on board the Erria. Defex sold 
the arms to an intermediary for $1.2 million. The 
intermediary, in turn, sold the cargo for $2,156,000 
(including transportation),137 to the CIA, which did 
not want to deal with the Enterprise because of 
Clines' involvement. The arms were transferred from

Chapter 23 
the Erria to another ship on September 20 for deliv-
ery to the CIA.'" 
Hakim and Secord continued their efforts. Herup 
was ordered to take the now-empty Erria to Haifa, 
Israel, where it was to receive a new shipment of 
arms. So as not to run afoul of the Arab boycott, the 
name of the ship was altered to read, "Ria," and false 
entries were placed in the Captain's log. On October 
13, at Haifa, Herup loaded a crate containing eight 
tons of Eastern Bloc arms that Nir had promised for 
the Contras. The captain also had been told he was to 
pick up pharmaceuticals for Iran. No pharmaceuticals 
were loaded. 
Herup was then ordered to go to Fujairah in the 
Gulf of Oman. The Iranians had promised North two 
Soviet T-72 tanks, but after the Erria waited 6 weeks 
in the Gulf, the plan failed to materialize. On Decem-
ber 9, Herup was ordered to open the Israeli crate. 
He found only 600 well-used AK-47 assault rifles and 
15 cases of ammunition?valued at approximately 
$100,000?a cargo not worth transporting to Central 
America.' 3 9 
After the revelations of the Iran-Contra covert op-
erations in November 1986, Clines or Hakim ordered 
the Erria on December 14 to return to Eilat, Israel, 
where the crate of weapons that had been received in 
Haifa were unloaded. 
The Erria returned to Denmark later in December. 
Its missions on behalf of the Enterprise were at an 
end. 
Conclusion 
The Erria was in a sense a metaphor for the other 
operations of the Enterprise?ventures that began 
with ambitious expectations but accomplished noth-
ing. But the fate of these ventures cannot obscure the 
danger of privatization of covert operations or the 
fact that the participants in the Enterprise had auda-
cious plans for covert operations. Had the architects 
of the other operations been emboldened by success, 
and not frustrated by failure, the Committees can only 
conjecture, with apprehension, what other uncon-
trolled covert activities on behalf of the United States 
lay in store.

ransom. Agent 2 Dep., 8/12/87, at 188. He stated that the 
large payments were "bribes" and could not be ransom 
because "[a] ransom has to be solicited." (Id. at 193). In 
discussing the $1 million per hostage figure that was con-
templated for the May 1986, rescue effort (see below), 
Agent 2 maintained that this money was intended only for 
those who were "corruptible." (Id. at 196). Agent 2 also 
testified, however, that he could not be sure that some of 
these monies would not be given to the individuals were 
responsible for the kidnappings. (Id. at 194). Agent 2 testi-
fied that the possibility that the payment of monies would 
create an incentive for more kidnappings was discussed and 
it was concluded that "[w]e'd just have to take our shot."

47. Yet, when asked by the House Judiciary Committee 
on March 5, 1987, if he knew of the plan, the Attorney 
General testified he knew only that the DEA agents were 
collecting information. (Meese Test., House Committee on 
the Judiciary, March 5, 1987, Ex. EM-5, at 54-55.) Howev-
er, in testimony at the Joint Hearings, Meese claimed he 
was unaware only of any "ransom" plan as opposed to 
plans to bribe foreigners. (Meese Test., 7/29/87, at 222-23.) 
Meese repeated his prior testimony that he was not aware 
of the operational role of the DEA agents, although the 
memo he received from North stated that the agents would 
rent a safehouse and open a bank account. (Id.) The Attor-
ney General did not consider such activities to be oper-
ational, although the head of the DEA, John Lawn, does.

57. The Hostage Location Task Force is to be distin-
guished from the Hostage Locating Task Force referred to 
earlier. The former was a short-term entity headed by 
Charles Allen and included staff members on loan from 
other agencies. Some of these staff members worked full-
time and were physically located at CIA. Its purpose was to 
define the options available to deal with the hostages held 
in Lebanon. (DIA Major Dep., 7/2/87, at 48). The Hostage 
Locating Task Force, by contrast, was an interagency 
group that met only periodically. Its purpose was to share 
information relating to hostages. (Id. at 8).

79. Agent 1 Dep., 8/28/87, at 147. In an apparent refer-
ence to the Sixth Fleet, Agent 1 speaks erroneously of 
North obtaining assistance from "The Seventh Fleet or 
something like that." 
80. North had pursued a similar course in an attempt to 
obtain the release of Peter Kilburn, an American citizen 
who was the librarian at the American University in Beirut. 
Kilburn was kidnapped on November 30, 1984, by a differ-
ent group. A source indicated in the summer of 1985, that 
he could gain access to Kilburn in exchange for cash. North 
turned to Perot to provide $100,000 in cash and eventually 
$1 million to obtain Kilburn's release. This time, Coburn 
provided $100,000 in cash, all of which was eventually 
given to the intermediary. Kilburn was killed by his captors 
after the U.S. bombing raid on Libya on April 15, 1986, 
before the rescue attempt could be carried out.

84. The DEA agents had other experiences with people 
involved with North's network. Sometime in 1986, Fawn 
Hall asked Agents 1 and 2 to meet with Michael Ledeen. 
They met at Ledeen's office. Ledeen told them he was a 
very good friend of North's. Ledeen said he had a $30,000 
contract with Continental Airlines and he wanted to know 
how he could stop DEA from seizing their airplanes if 
cocaine was discovered on board. (Id. at 170.) The agents 
arranged for Ledeen to meet the DEA regional director in 
Miami regarding the problem. Robinette told them, on an-
other occasion, that he was retained by Clines to investigate 
a civil suit filed against Clines and others alleging assassina-
tion plots and drug dealing in Central America. (Id. at 158.) 
Agent 1 told him he knew very little about the drug situa-
tion down there. Later, Robinette called him to ask him to 
check out Ted Shackley. Agent 1 referred him to his broth-
er for investigative work. In December 1986, Albert Hakim 
called Agent 3 in Switzerland. Hakim told Agent 3 that he 
had an Iranian business associate who was in the hospital 
construction business who had to accompany him to the 
United States on business. (Agent 3 Dep., 5/13/87, at 60.) 
Hakim asked if Agent 3 could assist this Iranian in getting a 
visa to the United States. Agent 3 said he could not. Agent 
3 asked Hakim if he was working for any government 
agencies, and Hakim said he was still working with the 
CIA. (Id.) Agent 3 suggested that in that case he should 
seek CIA assistance in getting his associate travel papers.

Chapter 24 
Covert Action in a Democratic Society 
The Iran-Contra Affair raises fundamental and trou-
blesome questions about the secret intelligence oper-
ations of the U.S. Government. Can such operations, 
and particularly covert action, be authorized and con-
ducted in a manner compatible with the American 
system of democratic government and the rule of 
law? Is it possible for an open society such as the 
United States to conduct such secret activities effec-
tively? And if so, by what means can these operations 
be controlled so as to meet the requirements of ac-
countability in a democratic society?1 
These questions became the center of public debate 
in the mid-1970s, after revelations of controversial 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activities and ex-
tensive investigations by a Presidential Commission 
and Select Committees of the House and the Senate.2 
The result of those inquiries was a concerted effort 
by the executive and legislative branches to adopt 
laws and procedures to control secret intelligence ac-
tivities, including covert actions, and to ensure that 
they would be conducted only with the prior authori-
zation of the President and timely notice to Congres-
sional committees specially constituted to protect the 
secrecy necessary for effective operations. 
Experience has shown that these laws and proce-
dures, if respected, are adequate to the task. In the 
Iran-Contra Affair, however, they often were disre-
garded. The flexibility built into the legislation and 
rules to allow the executive branch to deal with ex-
traordinary situations was distorted beyond reasonable 
bounds. Laws intended to reflect a spirit of comity 
between the branches were abused when that commit-
ment to cooperation was abandoned. 
The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
William J. Casey, and other Government officials 
showed contempt for the democratic process by with-
holding information that Congress was seeking and by 
misrepresenting intelligence to support policies advo-
cated by Casey. 
What is Covert Action? 
The term "covert action" refers to a specific type of 
clandestine activity that goes beyond the collection of 
secret intelligence.3 It is an attempt by a government 
to influence political behavior and events in other 
countries in ways that are concealed. 
Covert action is not defined in statute. Executive 
Order 12333, however, issued by President Reagan in 
1981, refers to covert action as special activities 
which are defined as: 
Special activities mean activities conducted in 
support of national foreign policy objectives 
abroad which are planned and executed so that 
the role of the United States government is not 
apparent or acknowledged publicly, and func-
tions in support of such activities . . . .4 
This definition excludes diplomatic activities, the 
collection and production of intelligence, or related 
support functions. The Executive order also provides 
that the authorized special activities may not include 
activities that are "intended to influence United States 
political processes, public opinion, policies, or 
media."5 
Peacetime covert action became an instrument of 
U.S. foreign policy in response to the expansion of 
Soviet political and military influence following 
World War II. The overt U.S. policies at that time 
included the commitment of military assistance under 
the Truman Doctrine, the surge of economic aid 
through the Marshall Plan, the efforts to establish a 
democratic regime in West Germany, and the dramat-
ic airlift to break the Soviets' Berlin blockade. Ac-
companying the overt policies were covert actions 
designed to counter Soviet political influence and to 
prepare for behind-the-lines resistance in case of a 
Soviet invasion of Europe. When a Communist-orga-
nized coup overthrew the Government of Czechoslo-
vakia in February 1948, and a series of general strikes 
orchestrated by Communist-controlled labor unions 
swept Western Europe, U.S. officials decided that this 
covert political action and support should be intensi-
fied to reinforce the still-fragile free institutions of the 
postwar world.? 
In this atmosphere, President Truman directed the 
development of a covert action capability. A 1948 
National Security Council Directive, NSC 10/2, de-
fined covert actions to be:

propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct 
action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demoli-
tion and evacuation measures; subversion against 
hostile states, including assistance to underground 
resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee lib-
eration groups, and support of in digenous anti-
communist elements.' 
Since 1948, U.S. covert actions have included most of 
these activities. 
What makes such activities "covert" is not their 
effect, but their implementation in a manner permit-
ting "plausible denial," a concept that NSC 10/2 also 
codified. U.S. action in support of indigenous groups 
were to be: 
so planned and executed that any U.S. govern-
ment responsibility for them is not evident to 
unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the 
U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim any re-
sponsibility for them.8 
This concept was an important element in the meas-
ures which the Truman and Eisenhower Administra-
tions implemented to strengthen democratic trade 
unions, the fledgling postwar political parties, and the 
free press in the war-ravaged parts of the world. For 
American support had its own danger: it might have 
tainted the recipients and exposed them to charges of 
being in the service of "Yankee imperialism." Means 
had to be found to camouflage the American connec-
tion. Financing and other support, in case of unwel-
come publicity, was to be nonattributable to the U.S. 
Government, and allegations about such support were 
to be deniable in a plausible manner. 
As originally defined in NSC 10/2, "plausible 
denial" meant concealing the U.S. Government's role 
from unauthorized inquiry?not avoiding responsibil-
ity and accountability to other agencies of the Gov-
ernment, including Congress. One of the main issues 
identified by Congressional investigations in the mid-
1970s, however, was the misuse of "plausible denial." 
Covert Action and the Law 
Covert action operations pose challenges for the polit-
ical processes of the United States. As with other 
secret intelligence programs and more sensitive de-
fense projects, appropriations and expenditures of 
these operations must necessarily be kept from the 
public domain. Thus, covert assistance to foreign gov-
ernments and groups does not receive the open debate 
other assistance programs do. 
Paramilitary covert actions are in the "twilight 
area"" between war, which only Congress can de-
clare, and diplomacy, which the President must 
manage. This type of activity is especially trouble-
some as a constitutional separation of powers issue. 
While covert actions can be legitimate instruments 
of foreign policy, they can, if inconsistent with the 
376 
national policy, undermine U.S. interests abroad. 
Even if the covert action is consistent with U.S. 
policy, disclosure sometimes can be harmful to U.S. 
interests.11 
The executive and legislative branches have agreed 
that covert actions must be subject to specific legal 
controls. Statutes, executive orders, and national secu-
rity directives establish a framework for the authori-
zation and conduct of these activities. The system was 
intended to insure careful review and accountability 
and to meet the practical need of securing political 
support. 
The National Security Act of 194712 created both 
the National Security Council (NSC) and the Central 
Intelligence Agency. The law authorized the CIA to 
advise the NSC on intelligence matters, to correlate 
and evaluate intelligence, and "to perform such other 
functions and duties related to intelligence affecting 
national security as the National Security Council 
may from time to time direct." While Congress has 
never provided specific authority for the CIA or any 
other elements of the Government to conduct covert 
actions, it has continued to appropriate funds for these 
activities. 
When Secretary of Defense James Forrestal asked 
the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) in 1947 
whether the CIA was empowered to conduct covert 
activities, the Director replied that the CIA could do 
so if the NSC approved the activities and Congress 
appropriated funds to carry them out." 
A CIA's legal counsel put it in similar terms: 
If the President gave us a proper directive and 
Congress gave us the money, we had the admin-
istrative authority to carry out [covert actions]." 
In 1948, NSC 10/2 established the first administra-
tive mechanism for the approval of covert actions at a 
senior interagency level, with the participation of offi-
cials from the White House, the State Department, 
the Defense Department, and the CIA. 
The Eisenhower Administration tightened and for-
malized procedures for control of covert action by 
creating the "5412" Committee for the review and 
supervision of covert activities. The Department of 
Justice was to review covert action proposals before 
they were submitted to the NSC. 
The "5412" Committee of the Eisenhower era 
became the "303" Committee of the Johnson Admin-
istration and the "40" Committee under President 
Nixon" but the essential procedures remained the 
same: a proposal for covert action was reviewed and 
analyzed by an interagency committee, resulting, if 
approved, in an NSC directive from the President and 
the review of the expenditure by a Congressional 
committee. 
Congressional oversight was by consensus. A series 
of personal relationships developed between the direc-
tors of the CIA and the chairmen of the Congression-

Chapter 24 
al Committees dealing with Appropriations and Armed 
Services." There was trust and mutual respect along 
with a bipartisan agreement across a broad spectrum 
of foreign policy, although since the mid-1950s there 
were pressures from within and outside Congress to 
establish more clearly defined forms of Congressional 
oversight for intelligence activities. 
After public allegations of CIA efforts to "destabi-
lize" the Allende regime in Chile," Congress sought 
to insure Presidential accountability for covert actions 
and notification of all appropriate Congressional com-
mittees, including those on foreign affairs. The 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment of 1974 provided: 
No funds appropriated under the authority of this 
chapter or any other Act may be expended by or 
on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency for 
operations in foreign countries, other than activi-
ties intended solely for obtaining necessary intelli-
gence, unless and until the President finds that 
each such operation is important to the national 
security of the United States." 
The Hughes-Ryan Amendment also required the 
President "to report, in a timely fashion, a description 
and scope of such operations to the appropriate com-
mittees of Congress." There were six such committees 
at that time. 
Further allegations of CIA involvement in unlawful 
domestic activities prompted President Ford to estab-
lish a commission, chaired by Vice President Rocke-
feller, to evaluate certain past CIA practices.19 In 
January 1975, President Ford indicated "off the 
record" that he had discovered CIA involvement in 
assassination conspiracies that "would blacken the 
reputation of every President after Harry Truman."2? 
The story did not stay off the record for long and 
there was a public outcry. Shortly thereafter, the 
Senate established a temporary Select Committee to 
Study Governmental Operations with Respect to In-
telligence Activities (the Church Committee),2' and 
the House of Representatives created its own tempo-
rary Select Committee on Intelligence (the Pike Com-
mittee). 2 2 
The investigations by the Church Committee in 
1975 and 1976 failed to turn up proof that Presidents 
had ordered assassinations of foreign officials, but 
some senior officials indicated it was their belief that 
some Presidents had secretly approved such activi-
ties.23 Many in Congress felt that the problem was 
not so much that the CIA was undertaking covert 
action without the proper authority, but that Execu-
tive approval had been given in a deliberately ambig-
uous manner. 
Congress responded with the Hughes-Ryan Amend-
ment24 which altered the approval process of CIA 
covert action operations. By requiring that the Presi-
dent personally approve all covert actions as impor-
tant to the national security, Congress sought to make 
the President responsible for all covert operations. 
The U.S. Government might still be able to deny 
publicly the responsibility for specific actions, but 
within the Government there would be an accounta-
ble source of authority?the President.25 
By 1977, both Houses of Congress established per-
manent select committees for intelligence oversight. 
This increased from six to eight the number of "ap-
propriate committees" to be notified under the terms 
of the Hughes-Ryan Amendment." The resolution 
establishing the Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence expressed the sense of the Senate that the Com-
mittee should be notified of "significant anticipated 
intelligence activities." The term was intended to 
ensure that notice of Presidential Findings under the 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment would occur prior to the 
implementation of the operation. 
The Executive branch also established new proce-
dural controls over covert action operations. Presi-
dent Ford's Executive Order 1190527 set up an NSC 
Committee to review covert action proposals prior to 
their submission to the President and to conduct 
"periodic reviews of programs previously considered" 
by the Committee." The Committee was composed 
of the NSC principals, the National Security Adviser, 
the Attorney General, and the Director of the 
Budget, or their representatives. 
An Intelligence Oversight Board was created to 
assess reports of illegality and impropriety in the ac-
tivities of the intelligence community and to report its 
evaluations directly to the President. The CIA was 
authorized to carry out covert actions as directed by 
the President only when these were "within the limits 
of applicable law." 
President Carter carried forward similar procedures 
in his Executive Order 12036, issued in 1978.29 The 
Carter Order added the provision that designated the 
CIA as the sole agency to carry out covert action 
unless the President directed otherwise. It also re-
quired that the Congressional oversight committees be 
kept informed of - "significant anticipated intelligence 
activities" in a manner consistent with constitutional 
authorities and duties of the executive and legislative 
branches. 
In 1980, Congress replaced the notification provi-
sions of the Hugherctkan Amendment by amending 
the National Stew* Act of 1947 to add a new sec-
tion 501 on Corigressional oversight of intelligence 
activities.3? For the first time, the language on notice 
of "significant anticipated intelligence activities" was 
written into law. 
Under the new law, notification had to be given 
only to the Intelligence Committee of each house, 
rather than to eight committees. Moreover, in extraor-
dinary circumstances affecting the national interests of 
the United States, the President may choose to limit 
prior notice to the chairmen and ranking minority 
members of the Intelligence Committees and the ma-

Chapter 24 
jority and minority leaders of the two Houses, a total 
of eight Members. 
The law provided that the Committees were to be 
notified in a "timely fashion" of any covert action for 
which prior notice was not given." The 1980 report 
on this provision by the Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee states: 
The Senate Select Committee and the Executive 
Branch and the intelligence agencies have come 
to an understanding that in rare, extraordinary 
circumstances if the President withholds prior 
notice of covert operations, he is obliged to 
inform the two Oversight Committees in a timely 
fashion of the action and the reasons for with-
holding such prior notice." 
According to the Committee report, the law was a 
compromise intended to codify the "practical relation-
ship" that "the Executive Branch and the intelligence 
oversight committees had developed based on comity 
and mutual understanding, without confrontation" 
and thus to "carry this working relationship forward 
into statute." 3 3 
Although the law gave the President some flexibil-
ity on notification, there was no exception from the 
requirement for a Presidential Finding as a precondi-
tion to all covert action operations. Presidential ac-
countability remained the cornerstone of the system 
of control over covert actions. 
When President Reagan took office, he pledged to 
revitalize U.S. intelligence and to dispel the "suspi-
cion and mistrust . . . [that] can undermine this na-
tion's ability to confront the increasing challenge of 
espionage and terrorism." 3 4 
As part of the effort to restore confidence, the 
President issued Executive Order 1233335 in which 
he eased some of the restrictions on CIA activities. 
The new order pledged continued obedience to the 
law and retained the provision that only the CIA 
could conduct covert actions in peacetime unless the 
President designated another agency to do so. The 
Executive Order also applied the Hughes-Ryan 
Amendment's Finding requirement to all covert ac-
tions, not just to those of the CIA." 
In keeping with standard American political proc-
esses, a basic structure of covert action procedures 
evolved within the law. A system of interlocking stat-
utes, executive orders, and national security directives 
had been established by three successive Administra-
tions. 
Despite occasional problems, this system has 
proved workable. The Administration has notified the 
oversight Committees of its proposals including those 
of great sensitivity in which lives might be in danger 
in event of disclosure. In fact, "the Committees have 
received advance notification of every presidential 
finding but for the two involving the attempted 
rescue of our hostages in Iran in 1979-80 and the NSC 
378 
initiative in 1985 and 1986."37 The President and 
senior intelligence officials have indicated to Congress 
their satisfaction with the Oversight Committees' role 
and with the prevailing procedures, which also pro-
tect the CIA from charges that its actions are unau-
thorized. Indeed, the procedures implemented by the 
Executive and by Congress preclude the possibility 
that the intelligence agencies would be blamed for 
activities for which elected officials might wish to 
deny responsibility. 
These mechanisms were a significant achievement 
of bipartisan, interbranch cooperation. But they re-
quired continuing adjustment in light of experience 
with existing procedures. One such adjustment oc-
curred in 1984 following public disclosure of the 
mining of the Nicaraguan harbors. The Intelligence 
Committees had not been adequately briefed by the 
CIA on the anticipated escalation of U.S. involvement 
in Nicaragua." This subsequently led to an agree-
ment between the Senate Intelligence Committee and 
the Director of Central Intelligence, known as the 
Casey Accords, formalizing the requirement that the 
Director report any significant anticipated intelligence 
activity, including instances in which the activity 
would be part of an ongoing program." The agree-
ment also institutionalized various reporting require-
ments to ensure more substantive briefings, improve 
oversight of broad Findings and bring potential treaty 
and legal repercussions to the attention of the Mem-
bers. 
For the goals of this system of accountability and 
oversight to be fulfilled, several steps had to be taken. 
First, the President had to approve specifically, and 
accept responsibility for, each covert action by sign-
ing a Finding before the operation proceeded. 
Second, the Congressional Intelligence Committees 
had to be notified either before the operation began 
or in a "timely fashion" thereafter. Third, for over-
sight of intelligence activities to be meaningful, intelli-
gence officials had to respond candidly to Congres-
sional inquiries and provide Congress and officials in 
the executive branch with objective intelligence anal-
yses so that proposed actions could be evaluated ob-
jectively.40 
In the Iran-Contra Affair, the principles of this 
process of accountability and oversight would get 
their severest test. 
Misuse of Findings 
The Findings process was circumvented. Covert ac-
tions were undertaken outside the specific authoriza-
tions of Presidential Findings. At other times, covert 
actions were undertaken without a Presidential Find-
ing altogether. Actions were undertaken through enti-
ties other than the CIA, including foreign govern-
ments and private parties. There were claims that the 
Findings could be used to override provisions of the 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 24 
law. The statutory option for prior notice to eight key 
congressional leaders was disregarded throughout, 
along with the legal requirement to notify the Intelli-
gence Committees in a "timely fashion." 
"Stretching" Findings 
On December 1, 1981, President Reagan signed a 
Finding that authorized certain covert action pro-
grams in Central America, particularly in Nicara-
gua." The Finding is directed toward the Cuban 
presence in Nicaragua and Central America generally. 
This conflicts with the Administration's explanation of 
the Finding which emphasized its purpose as the 
interdiction of arms from Nicaragua to the leftist in-
surgents in El Salvador. Yet, under the aegis of this 
Finding, the CIA provided assistance to Eden Pas-
tora's rebel forces in the south of Nicaragua, far from 
El Salvador. The stated goal of these forces was the 
overthrow of the Sandinista Government.42 
Destabilizing the Sandinistas in Nicaragua was a 
different goal from arms interdiction to El Salva-
dor." Director Casey, however, declined to seek a 
new Finding that properly distinguished between 
these two objectives. 
If a Finding signed by the President and presented 
to the Intelligence Committees for one purpose can be 
used for another, the Finding and notification process-
es become meaningless. In fact, while Casey was Di-
rector of Central Intelligence, CIA personnel attempt-
ed to craft Findings in terms so broad that they 
would not limit the CIA's freedom to act.44 Judge 
Sporkin, the General Counsel of the CIA, analogized 
the formulation of Findings to the preparation of a 
securities prospectus where the corporate purposes 
are broadly stated to give management discretion to 
carry out a wide range of activities.45 Viewed in this 
way, a Finding becomes a blank check for the intelli-
gence agency and defeats the notion of Presidential 
accountability under the Hughes-Ryan law. At this 
point, it ceases to be a self-limiting document confined 
to a specific program. 
Dispensing with Presidential Findings 
In reaction to the adoption of the second Boland 
Amendment in October 1984, the NSC staff took an 
increasingly active role in support of the Contras. The 
NSC staff raised money for the Contras and, with 
Richard Secord's assistance, created an organization 
outside the Government to procure arms and resupply 
the Contras." While the President has said that sup-
porting the Contras was his own idea,47 he told the 
Tower Board that he was unaware that the NSC staff 
was directly assisting the Contras." In any event, 
there was no Presidential Finding authorizing these 
activities. National Security Adviser Robert C. 
McFarlane testified that he was unaware of the mag-
nitude of Oliver North's operation" although both 
North and Admiral John M. Poindexter disputed 
McFarlane's denials.5? 
Efforts coordinated by North to ransom hostages 
constituted another instance in which the legal re-
quirements for a Finding were dispensed with. This 
was in contravention of the President's own directive, 
Executive Order 12333, which provided specifically 
that all covert actions be contained in Presidential 
Findings. Not only was a Finding dispensed with, but 
funds to support the operation were raised from pri-
vate sources. The operation was pursued despite the 
objection of CIA and some DEA officials, and Con-
gress was not notified. 
There was also no written Finding when the CIA 
became involved in the covert shipment of arms to 
Iran in 1985. As McFarlane subsequently expressed, 
"Nile President was all for letting the Israelis do 
whatever they wanted to do."51 In November 1986, 
McFarlane asserted that the Attorney General had 
opined that U.S. participation in the initial Israeli 
shipments could be justified on the grounds that the 
President had made a "mental Finding."52 The Attor-
ney General testified to his view that the President's 
concurrence was tantamount to an oral Finding and 
thus sufficient legal authorization for the program." 
The December 1985 Finding sought to authorize 
retroactively the CIA-assisted shipment of arms in 
November 1985. It was drafted after the shipment was 
made; presented to the President at the request of 
Casey and urging of CIA Deputy Director John 
McMahon; and then signed by the President without 
the normal full staffing of relevant senior Administra-
tion officials.54 This process ignored a central pur-
pose of the Finding requirement which is to ensure 
that the President fully authorizes a covert action 
before it begins and is accountable for its implementa-
tion.55 Further, the "unless and until" language of the 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment clearly required a Finding 
before the CIA could proceed. 
The use of Findings to ensure Presidential responsi-
bility for covert action operations also was disregard-
ed in the diversion of money from the Iran program 
to the Contras, which itself was never authorized by a 
Finding. Neither the January 17, 1986, Finding relat-
ing to the Iran arms sales, nor any Finding relating to 
assistance to the Contras authorized the diversion of 
funds. Poindexter testified that he believed the diver-
sion would become politically controversial if ex-
posed, so he decided not to tell the President in order 
to give him "deniability."56 
Poindexter testified that he destroyed the only 
signed copy of the December 1985 Iran Finding in 
November 1986 to spare the President political ern-
barrassment.57 However, when the President signed 
that Finding?which was written as a straight arms-
for-hostages operation?he accepted responsibility for 
his decision. Along with that responsibility came the 
risk that the public might disapprove of the decision if 
379

Chapter 24 
it were ever revealed. In destroying the record of the 
President's post hoc approval of the November 1985 
shipment, Poindexter also sought to destroy the proof 
of Presidential accountability that the law seeks to 
achieve. 
Using Findings To Avoid Laws 
At times, certain members of the Administration 
used Findings to avoid legal requirements. A project 
to stockpile weapons for the Contras is a case in 
point. 
In the summer of 1983, the CIA feared that Con-
gress might refuse to appropriate funds for the Con-
tras in the next fiscal year 1984. The Agency thus 
devised a way of bypassing the appropriations proc-
ess: the Department of Defense (DOD) would secret-
ly transfer military equipment to the CIA without 
charge. The Agency would then dispense the equip-
ment to the Contras in the following fiscal year even 
if Congress cut off aid. To justify its request, the CIA 
pointed to the broad Presidential Finding authorizing 
assistance to the Contras even though nothing was 
said in that Finding about a donation of DOD materi-
el to the Contras through the CIA. 
The Finding that was supposed to enhance control 
over covert action operations was invoked to justify 
an evasion of one of the Constitution's most funda-
mental safeguards, the dependence of the executive 
branch upon Congress for specific appropriations. In 
the end, the proposal was not implemented because 
DOD would not transfer the equipment to the CIA 
free of charge. 
In the Iran initiative, the Administration also used 
the Finding to avoid compliance with the laws regu-
lating the export of arms. When the January 17, 1986, 
Iran Finding was under consideration, CIA, DOD, 
and Justice Department lawyers addressed the ques-
tion of whether the Finding could authorize CIA 
arms transfers without regard to the restrictions on 
arms transfers under the Foreign Assistance Act and 
the Arms Export Control Act. In 1981, Attorney 
General William French Smith had taken the posi-
tion?based on an analysis by the State Department 
Legal Adviser?that the restrictions of those statutes 
applied only to transfers undertaken pursuant to them; 
the President, however, could approve a transfer 
"outside the context of those statutes" by utilizing the 
Economy Act and the National Security Act.58 
Nonetheless, the Smith opinion recognized the Con-
gressional reporting requirements applicable in any 
event, and specifically concluded that "the House and 
Senate Intelligence Committees should be informed of 
this proposal and the President's determinations."'" 
When the Smith opinion was considered in the con-
text of the Iran Finding in January 1986, its require-
ment of at least some form of prior Congressional 
notification was ignored. Instead, a memorandum 
from Poindexter to the President describing the Find-
380 
ing characterized that opinion as concluding "that 
under an appropriate finding you could authorize the 
CIA to sell arms to countries outside of the provisions 
of laws and reporting requirements for foreign mili-
tary sales."'" Poindexter's memorandum recommend-
ed to the President "that you exercise your statutory 
prerogative to withhold notification . . . to the Con-
gressional oversight committees until such time as you 
deem it to be appropriate."81 
Later in 1986, after the Iran Finding was executed, 
the Arms Export Control Act was amended to ban all 
arms exports under the Act to countries that support-
ed terrorism, unless there was a Presidential waiver 
and a report to Congress." Administration officials, 
however, continued to rely on the Finding as the 
controlling authority, despite the fact that Iran was a 
designated terrorist country. 
The former General Counsel of the CIA testified 
that under the Administration's interpretation, a Find-
ing would justify arms transfers that occurred even 
after the 1986 amendment. 
Q. "The impression was left somehow that if we 
decided to go 'black' or covert, we don't have to 
comply with other provisions of the law. Would 
that be your interpretation as well?" 
A. "Well . . . they give the President an oppor-
tunity to, through a different regime, to do it that 
way, so that you can avoid the other problems. 
Yes. I think that is an accuracy." 
Q. "I have some difficulty with that interpreta-
tion because there is nothing in the Hughes-Ryan 
Act which suggests that somehow [a Finding] 
would preempt the other provisions of the law. 
. . . If we had the Arms Export Control Act, 
had a flat prohibition on the sale of arms to 
countries who sponsor terrorism and we listed 
Iran as one of those countries that sponsor terror-
ism, could the President legally sign a covert 
action [finding] permitting the CIA to ship arms 
to Iran?" 
A. "I think that is what we said in this case. 
. . . I mean that was the interpretation that you 
could have that, that [it] could be done. That is 
what covert action is, Senator. It is an ability of 
the Government. You see you are not defeating 
anything because the system requires there be no-
tification to Congress."" 
It is unreasonable, however, to interpret the Smith 
opinion as providing a justification for avoiding all of 
the various requirements of the Arms Export Control 
Act and the National Security Act. Moreover, Execu-
tive Order 12333 does not, and legally could not, 
authorize U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct activi-
ties in violation of the laws of the United States." 
The argument that covert action pursuant to a Find-
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 24 
ing may proceed without regard to certain statutory 
restrictions applicable to other Government programs 
is not the same as an argument for exemption from all 
Federal statutes. 
Moreover, the Administration also used the January 
17 Iran Finding to override statutory Congressional 
notification provisions. As explained above, the Presi-
dent was informed that this new Finding could justify 
arms transfers without any prior notification to Con-
gress, including the limited notification to the chair-
men and ranking minority members of the Intelligence 
Committees and the majority and minority leaders of 
the two Houses. At best, the President was given 
misleading advice. Findings were intended to subject 
covert action to the accountability of the constitution-
al system, not to supplant law. 
Not Playing It Straight With 
Congress 
The concept of Presidential responsibility was not the 
only principle undercut during the Iran-Contra initia-
tive. Accountability to Congress for intelligence oper-
ations also was ignored. For Congress to exercise its 
constitutional and statutory responsibility for over-
sight, it must first be notified of significant intelli-
gence activities and then be given truthful and com-
prehensive information about them. 
Misleading Testimony 
Congress was not notified of either the Iran initia-
tive or the NSC staffs covert operation in support of 
the Contras. Senior intelligence officials, including the 
Director of Central Intelligence, misled Congress, 
withheld information, or failed to speak up when they 
knew others were giving incorrect testimony. 
For example, Clair George (CIA Director for Op-
erations), the CIA's Chief of Central America Task 
Force (C/CATF), and Elliott Abrams (Assistant Sec-
retary of State), testified in October 1986, before the 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
(HPSCI) on the shooting down of the Hasenfus flight. 
Abrams testified that the U.S. Government was not 
involved in the Hasenfus operation.65 George and the 
C/CATF knew that the testimony was incorrect, but 
neither corrected Abrams. George later apologized to 
the Select Committees: 
I was surprised that Abrams made that statement. 
It was so categorical. The question is, should I 
step up and say "hold it, Elliott, what about?
excuse me, all you members of the HPSCI, but 
Elliott and I are now going to discuss what we 
know about" and I didn't have the guts to do it 
or I didn't do it.66 
George's own testimony to the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee also was inaccurate. Unaware of 
the activities of one of his field officers, he stated that 
the CIA was not involved "directly or indirectly in 
arranging, directing, or facilitating resupply missions 
conducted by private individuals in support of the 
Nicaraguan democratic resistance."67 Similarly, the 
C/CATF told the Select Committees that his testimo-
ny at the same was "narrowly defined,"68 thus rein-
forcing the impression that U.S. officials had no role 
in the private resupply operation. He explained that 
he: 
could have been more forthcoming to the [Senate 
Foreign Relations] Committee, but I frankly was 
not going to be the first person to step up and do 
that . . . so long as others who knew the details, 
as much as I, who knew more than I, were keep-
ing their silence on this, I was going to keep my 
silence. 6 9 
He elaborated: "I was a member of the team, I was 
a member of the Administration team . . . my frame 
of mind was to protect, was to be a member of the 
team . . . and to do it without lying, try to go 
through as best we could."7? While the C/CATF 
maintained that he was able to give technically cor-
rect answers, he conceded that he knew that the 
testimony of George and Abrams was mistaken. He 
testified that his loyalty to the Administration pre-
vented him from correcting the record when the 
Committees suggested that he place his allegiance 
above his responsibilities as a professional intelligence 
officer. The C/CATF explained that Congress' re-
quest for information put him in a "giant nutcracker" 
between the Administration, to which he felt a pri-
mary duty, and Congress, which counted on the CIA 
to provide objective information." 
A pattern developed in the CIA of not seeking 
information that could cause problems for Administra-
ton policy if it had to be revealed to Congress. When 
CIA stations abroad reported on General Singlaub's 
efforts to purchase arms and ammunition for the Con-
tras, North reported to McFarlane on February 6, 
1985, that "[two countries] have indicated . . . that 
they want to help in a 'big way'. Clair George (CIA) 
has withheld the dissemination of these offers and 
contacted me privately to assure that they will not 
become common knowledge."72 
Deputy Director Gates told the Senate Intelligence 
Committee: "Agency people . . . from the Director on 
down, actively shunned information. We didn't want 
to know how the Contras were being funded . . . we 
actively discouraged people from telling us things. 
We did not pursue lines of questioning."73 When 
Gates first heard Charles Allen's suspicions that a 
diversion of funds had taken place, his "first reaction 
was to tell Mr. Allen that I didn't want to hear any 
more about it." 7 4 
Thus, when witnesses appeared before the Intelli-
gence Committees, they could deflect inquiries be-

edge. This turned upside down the CIA's mission to 
collect all intelligence relevant to national security. 
Such behavior is both self-destructive and corrosive 
of the democratic process. It is self-destructive be-
cause the intelligence agencies are dependent on Con-
gressional support, which is undermined by a lack of 
candor. It is corrosive of the democratic process be-
cause Congress is prevented by such activity from 
obtaining the information necessary to fulfill its con-
stitutional oversight functions. As Clair George point-
ed out, once members of the intelligence agencies 
begin to deceive others in the Government, "the de-
struction of a secret service in a democracy" must 
follow. He added, "I deeply believe with the com-
plexities of the oversight process in the relationship 
between a free legislative body and a secret spy serv-
ice, that frankness is the best and only way to make it 
work."7 5 
Misuse of Intelligence 
The democratic processes also are subverted when 
intelligence is manipulated to affect decisions by elect-
ed officials and the public. This danger is magnified 
when a Director of Central Intelligence, like Casey, 
becomes a single-minded advocate of policy. Al-
though Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, John 
McMahon testified that no such intelligence manipula-
tion took place, there is evidence that Director Casey 
misrepresented or selectively used available intelli-
gence to support the policy he was promoting, par-
ticularly in Central America. 
For example, in the first week in January 1986, an 
all-source CIA analysis stated that while problems 
with supplies were hampering the Contras' strategy of 
forcing the Sandinistas to fight on more than one 
front, "[t]he insurgents have adequate weapons and 
ammunition and . . . problems with food supplies 
appear to have eased since U.S. funding [is] available 
to buy and transport food locally."76 But that posi-
tive evaluation of the Contras' position was not raised 
during a January 9, 1986, "NSC Pre-Brief."77 In addi-
tion, notes taken during that meeting reflect that Di-
rector Casey chose to ignore the CIA assessment and 
said, he "wants to make the insurgency choice stark?
either we go all out to support them or they'll go 
down the drain."78 
Intelligence misrepresentations for policy purposes 
occurred in the spring of 1986, when the Sandinistas 
pursued Contra fighters into Honduras. Such raids 
had periodically occurred since mid-1985. Neither 
Honduras nor the United States made an issue of 
these incursions because they were limited in scope 
and aimed at the Contras. At that time, the Sandinista 
raid was considered routine by the CIA Intelligence 
Directorate which noted, "[t]he Sandinistas probably 
believed that there would, as usual, be no Honduran 
reaction to the incursions and that their forces could 
quickly move out and return to Nicaragua."79 
382 
The White House response ignored this assessment, 
blamed Congress for encouraging the raid, and used 
the incident to authorize emergency military aid to 
Honduras. Press spokesman Larry Speakes stated at 
the daily White House briefing on March 25, 1986: 
Within 48 hours of the House rejection of aid to 
the Nicaraguan resistance, Sandinista military 
units crossed into Honduras in a large scale effort 
to attack UNO and FDN camps." 
Actually, the first Sandinistas crossed the border on 
March 20, the same day as the House action, and 
began to retreat across the border by March 24, 
before Speakes gave his briefing.8' They were back 
in Nicaragua before President Reagan signed the au-
thorization for emergency military assistance to Hon-
duras. 
Casey, however, wanted CIA analysts to highlight, 
rather than minimize, the raid's significance in 
Agency reports. In an April 3 memorandum, Casey 
instructed the Deputy Director of Intelligence to use 
the available material on the Sandinista incursion: 
to alert the world that the Sandinistas were pre-
paring and trying to knock the Contras out while 
we debated in the U.S. and can have another 
bigger try if we debate another two weeks.82 
The Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence replied 
on the same date: 
Pursuant to your note this a.m., DI and DO 
redrafted the blind memo on the Sandinista 
Military Actions and Intentions. . . . DIA [Defense 
Intelligence Agency] wanted to prepare a dissent. 
DIA has not yet formally submitted its position, but 
we have been led to understand that its approach will 
be that the incident represented more a target of 
opportunity for the Sandinistas rather than being 
representative of any clear strategy. Also, you should 
know that in the past we have had some difficulty in 
coordinating pieces on the fighting with INR (of 
State Department) which has estimated lower num-
bers of troops involved in recent operations.83 
Casey subsequently expressed his dissatisfaction 
with the revised CIA assessment in a memorandum to 
the C/CATF on April 3: 
[the DDI material] still does not make the point 
that this is what is trying to be represented as a 
target of opportunity and the incursion appears to 
us to be a long-planned effort designed to knock 
out the Contra forces quickly. . . .84 
Casey then suggested that alternatively his point be 
incorporated into a memorandum which should be 
used for the following purposes:

Chapter 24 
a. In Latin American countries "[i]t should be taken 
to the highest level of government available in the 
hope that it would either influence those governments 
to be supportive of the Contra program and upcom-
ing debate or at least refrain from undercutting its 
cause up here."85 
b. "A fully sanitized version should be made avail-
able to 011ie North, Pat Buchanan and Elliott Abrams 
for their purposes here. I'll leave it up to you to get 
the materials on to Elliott, Pat and 011ie."86 
Subsequent developments in Honduras confirmed 
that the Honduras "emergency" was mainly in Wash-
ington. On Tuesday, March 25, when President 
Reagan ordered the emergency military aid, the U.S. 
Commander in Chief, South, General John Galvin, 
arrived in Tegucigalpa to assess the situation and pro-
vide intelligence and advice to the Honduran govern-
ment, President Azcona of Honduras left the capital 
for a seaside vacation.87 
Another example of the selective misuse of intelli-
gence occurred in November 1986, after Casey had 
meetings in several Central American capitals. The 
local CIA station chiefs attended those meetings and 
cabled reports of the meetings to the C/CATF, who 
was to use these cables as the basis for a draft report 
on the Director's trip. 
One of the Central American Presidents was criti-
cal of U.S. policies, particularly those supporting the 
Nicaraguan armed Resistance. The U.S. Ambassador 
in that country told Casey that most Latin American 
countries opposed U.S. policy in Central America. 
Yet, the remarks critical of U.S. policy were omitted 
from the draft trip report prepared for Casey by the 
C/CATF.88 
On November 23, Director Casey discussed his trip 
to Central America in a letter to President Reagan: 
"On Thursday, I returned . . . from . . . Central 
America. I found the commandantes and the fighting 
men of the FDN in high spirit and ready to go. In 
stark contrast, the leaders [of Central American coun-
tries] were scared to death that we would not stay the 
course . . . .In fact, one of the leaders refused to 
meet with Casey, and another was critical of U.S. 
policies. Casey chose to give the President a distorted 
picture of the attitudes of the Central American presi-
dents effectively reinforcing his own view of what 
U.S. policy should be. 
Misrepresentation of intelligence also occurred in 
the Iran initiative. In memorandums recommending 
the January Findings, Poindexter told the President 
that Iran was in danger of losing the war with Iraq. 
According to Poindexter, Casey, agreed with this as-
sessment. Yet, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Defense, and Clair George all testified that the intelli-
gence community was of the opposite view?that Iran 
had the upper hand in the war. 
Secretary Shultz asserted that in connection with 
the Iran initiative, the intelligence "he [the President] 
was getting . . . was faulty about terrorism."'" The 
reason, according to Shultz, was that there was a 
problem of keeping "intelligence separated from 
policy and control over policy was very much in play 
and the Director of Central Intelligence wanted to 
keep himself very heavily involved in this policy 
which he had been involved in apparently all 
along."9 1 
The misuse of intelligence was a subject ancillary to 
the mandate given the Committees by Congress. The 
Committees included these examples because the seri-
ous implications they pose for decisionmaking. This 
misuse of intelligence by a Director of Central Intelli-
gence, the National Security Advisor, or any Senior 
Intelligence official, frustrates the ability of those 
within the executive branch and Congress to arrive at 
decisions based upon sound national policy judge-
ments. 
Conclusions 
Out of necessity, covert activities are conducted, and 
nearly all are approved and monitored, in secret. Be-
cause they are not subject to public debate and scruti-
ny, they must be examined carefully within the practi-
cal constraints imposed by the need for operational 
security. It has been the United States' historic 
achievement to develop a system of law, using stat-
utes, executive orders, regulations, notification proce-
dures, that provides this scrutiny and protection. The 
Committees conclude: 
(a) Covert operations are a necessary component of 
our Nation's foreign policy. They can supplement, not 
replace, diplomacy and normal instruments of foreign 
policy. As National Security Adviser Robert McFar-
lane testified, "it is clearly unwise to rely on covert 
action as the core of our policy."'" The government 
must be able to gain and sustain popular support for 
its foreign policy through open, public debate. 
(b) Covert operations are compatible with demo-
cratic government if they are conducted in an ac-
countable manner and in accordance with law. Laws 
mandate reporting and prior notice to Congress. 
Covert action Findings are not a license to violate the 
statutes of the United States. 
(c) As the Church Committee wrote more than a 
dozen years ago. "covert actions should be consistent 
with publicly defined United States foreign policy 
goals."'" But the policies themselves cannot be secret. 
(d) All Government operations, including covert 
action operations, must be funded from appropriated 
monies or from funds known to the appropriate com-
mittees of the Congress and subject to Congressional 
control. This principle is at the heart of our constitu-
tional system of checks and balances. 
(e) The intelligence agencies must deal in a spirit of 
good faith with the Congress. Both new and ongoing 
covert action operations must be fully reported, not

Chapter 24 
cloaked by broad Findings. Answers that are techni-
cally true, but misleading, are unacceptable. 
(f) Congress must have the will to exercise over-
sight over covert operations. The intelligence commit-
tees are the surrogates for the public on covert action 
operations. They must monitor the intelligence agen-
cies with that responsibility in mind. 
(g) The Congress also has a responsibility to ensure 
that sensitive information from the executive branch 
remains secure when it is shared with the Congress. A 
need exists for greater consensus between the Legisla-
tive and executive branches on the sharing and pro-
tection of information. 
(h) The gathering, analysis, and reporting of 
intelligence should be done in such a way that there 
can be no question that the conclusions are driven by 
the actual facts, rather than by what a policy advo-
cate hopes these facts will be. 
It has been observed that a country without en-
emies has no need of an army or an intelligence 
agency.9 4 
The United States of America, as a great power 
with worldwide interests, will continue to have to 
deal with nations that have different hopes, values, 
and ambitions. These differences will inevitably lead 
to conflicts. History reflects that the prospects for 
peaceful settlement are greater if this country has 
adequate means for its own defense, including effec-
384 
tive intelligence and the means to influence develop-
ments abroad. 
Organized and structured secret intelligence activi-
ties are one of the realities of the world we live in, 
and this is not likely to change. Like the military, 
intelligence services are fully compatible with demo-
cratic government when their actions are conducted 
in an accountable manner and in accordance with 
law. 
This country has been fortunate to have a military 
that is sensitive to the constraints built into the Con-
stitution and to the necessity of respecting the Con-
gress' responsibilities. This attitude of the military has 
won the trust of the American people, as George C. 
Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army during 
World War II, explained to one of his officers: 
But we have a great asset and that is that our 
people, our countrymen, do not distrust us and 
do not fear us. Our countrymen, our fellow citi-
zens, are not afraid of us. They don't harbor any 
ideas that we intend to alter the government of 
the country or the nature of this government in 
any way. This is a sacred trust. . . . 
Like the military, the intelligence services can func-
tion only with the trust and support of their country-
men. If they are to earn that trust, they must heed 
Marshall's words.9 5

report to the Senate: "Non-attribution to the United States 
for covert operations was the original and principal purpose 
of so called doctrine of plausible denial." Evidence before 
the Committee clearly demonstrates that this concept, de-
signed to protect the United States and its operatives from 
the consequences of disclosures, has been expanded to mask 
decisions of the President and his senior staff members. A 
further consequence of the expansion of this doctrine is that 
subordinates, in an effort to permit their superiors to 'plausi-
bly deny' operations, fail to fully inform them about those 
operations. 'Plausible denial' has shaped the process for 
approving and evaluating covert actions. For example, the 
40 Committee and its predecessor, the Special Group, have 
served as 'circuit breakers' for Presidents, thus avoiding 
consideration of covert actions by the Oval Office. 'Plausi-
ble denial' can also lead to the use of euphemism and 
circumlocution, which are designed to allow the President 
and other senior officials to deny knowledge of an operation 
should it be disclosed." U. S. Congress. Senate. Alleged

Powers of Congress and the President in the 
Field of Foreign Policy 
Under our Constitution, both the Congress and the 
Executive are given specific foreign policy powers. 
The Constitution does not name one or the other 
branch as the exclusive actor in foreign policy. Each 
plays a role in our system of checks and balances to 
ensure that our foreign policy is effective, sustainable 
and in accord with our national interests. 
Key participants in the Iran-Contra Affair had seri-
ous misconceptions about the roles of Congress and 
the President in the making of foreign policy. Poin-
dexter testified, referring to his efforts to keep infor-
mation about the covert action in support of the Con-
tras from the Congress, "I simply did not want any 
outside interference." 1 North testified, "I didn't want 
to show Congress a single word on this" same covert 
action.2 In Poindexter's and North's view, Congress 
trespassed on the prerogatives and policies of the 
President and was to be ignored or circumvented 
when necessary. If Congress denied the President 
funds to implement his foreign policy, they believed 
that the President could and should seek funds from 
private parties and foreign governments. If Congress 
sought to investigate activities which were secretly 
taking place, they believed executive branch officials 
could withhold information to conceal operations. 
These practices were required, in their judgment, to 
promote the President's policies. 
In Part IV, these Committees set forth the record 
of the misrepresentations, half-truths, and concealment 
employed by some within the executive branch to 
prevent Congress from learning about the NSC staffs 
covert activities. Here, we note that the attitude that 
motivated this conduct was based on a view of Con-
gress' role in foreign policy that is without historical 
or legal foundation. 
The argument that Congress has but a minor role in 
foreign policymaking is contradicted by the language 
of the Constitution, and by over 200 years of history. 
It is also shortsighted and ultimately self-defeating. 
American foreign policy and our system of govern-
ment cannot succeed unless the President and Con-
gress work together. 
The Witnesses' Position at the 
Hearings 
During the public hearings, both Poindexter and 
North characterized Congress as meddlers in the 
President's arena. Both asserted that their actions in 
providing covert support to the Contras were lawful 
despite the prohibitions contained in the Boland 
Amendment. 3 In light of that position, Poindexter 
was specifically asked "why it was when the NSC 
was carrying out military support for the Contras, 
you felt it necessary to withold information from the 
Congress." 4 In his responses, Poindexter said in part 
that the covert action in Central America was an 
implementation of the President's policy, and that 
"we didn't want more restrictive legislation intro-
duced in some new form of the Boland Amend-
ment." 5 Characterizing such legislation as "outside 
interference," Poindexter responded to questions: 
Q. Now, the outside interference we are talking 
about was Congress, and I take it the reason they 
were inquiring about Colonel North's activities, 
the Government's activities in support of the 
Contras, was precisely so that they could fulfill 
with information their constitutional function to 
pass legislation, one way or the other. Isn't that 
true? 
A. Yes, I suppose that is true. 
Q. And that you regarded as outside interfer-
ence? 
A. The point was, and still is, that the President 
has the constitutional right and, in fact, the con-
stitutional mandate to conduct foreign policy. His 
policy was to support the Contras.6 
North also repeatedly stated his view that "it was 
within the purview of the President of the United 
States to conduct secret activities . . . to further the 
policy goals of the United States." 7 North claimed 
that the President had the power under the Constitu-
tion to conduct "secret diplomacy" because "the 
President can do what he wants with his own staff." 8 
He stated that the President had a "very wide man-

Chapter 25 
date to carry out activities, secretly or publicly, as he 
chooses." 9 
The Constitutional Framework 
The Constitution itself gives no support to the argu-
ment that the President has a mandate so broad. The 
words "foreign policy" do not appear in the Constitu-
tion, and the Constitution does not designate the 
President as the sole or dominant actor in foreign 
policy. 
The only foreign policy powers expressly granted 
to the Executive in the Constitution are the powers to 
nominate Ambassadors, to negotiate treaties, and to 
direct the Armed Forces as Commander-in-Chief. 
Two of these powers are specifically conditioned on 
Senate approval: the Senate, through its power of 
advise and consent, can confirm or reject Ambassa-
dors and ratify or reject treaties. 
On the other hand, the Constitution expressly 
grants Congress the power to regulate foreign com-
merce, to raise and support armies, to provide and 
maintain a navy, and to declare war. Congress is 
given the exclusive power of the purse. The Execu-
tive may not spend funds on foreign policy projects 
except pursuant to an appropriation by Congress. 
Judicial Decisions Recognize a Shared 
Power 
Judicial decisions have not found in the Constitu-
tion any exclusive Presidential power to conduct for-
eign affairs. Questions involving foreign policy are 
infrequently litigated. But on those occasions where 
opinions are on point, the courts routinely have de-
scribed the conduct of foreign policy as a shared 
power between Congress and the President. 
Only last year, the Supreme Court, in discussing its 
own role in a case involving "this Nation's foreign 
relations," recognized "the premier role which both 
Congress and the Executive play in this field." 10 
Similarly, in 1948 the Supreme Court declined to take 
jurisdiction of a case turning on a foreign policy issue, 
noting that such issues "are wholly confided by our 
Constitution to the political departments of the gov-
ernment, Executive and Legislative." " In a 1979 
case, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals noted that 
Congress' role in foreign policy stems from its power 
of the purse and its authority to investigate the Ex-
ecutive's faithful execution of the law: "The legisla-
ture's powers, including prominently its dominant 
status in the provision of funds, and its authority to 
investigate the Executive's functioning, establish au-
thority for appropriate legislative participation in for-
eign affairs." 12 
In 1977, the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument 
that the Executive had "absolute discretion in the area 
of national security." 13 The Court noted that the 
Constitution assigns each branch powers "equally in-
388 
separable from the national security." 14 Finally, the 
Court dismissed the executive branch's claim that it 
could prevent Congress from obtaining information 
that might impact on national security since the Ex-
ecutive's concern with secrecy "conflicts with an 
equally legitimate assertion of authority by Congress 
to conduct investigations relevant to its legislative 
functions." 15 
Congress's role in obtaining and protecting confi-
dential information relating to foreign policy has also 
been recognized in judicial opinions. In United States 
v. Nixon, the Supreme Court recognized that "mili-
tary, diplomatic, or sensitive national security se-
crets" 16 may be entitled to specially privileged status 
in certain contexts, but went on specifically to state 
that the case had nothing to do with the balance 
between the President's "generalized interest in confi-
dentiality . . . and congressional demands for informa-
tion." 17 And, as Justice Black noted in his concur-
rence in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, "Nile guard-
ing of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense 
of informed representative government provides no 
real security for our Republic." 18 
The D.C. Circuit has also underscored that the 
duty of protecting national security secrets is shared 
jointly by Congress and the President: "There is Con-
stitutional power, under the Necessary and Proper 
Clause, in the federal government to keep national 
security information secret. This is typically a govern-
ment power, to be exercised by the legislative and 
executive branches acting together." 19 
Judicial opinions, thus, have consistently recognized 
that Congress shares with the President powers in the 
conduct of foreign policy and also shares with him 
the right of access to, and the duty to protect, sensi-
tive national security information. 
The Curtiss-Wright Case 
In urging a broad interpretation of presidential 
power, various witnesses before these Committees in-
voked the Supreme Court's 1936 decision in United 
States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation.20 Their 
reliance on this case is misplaced. 
In Curtiss-Wright, Congress, by statute, had delegat-
ed to the President the power to prohibit the sale of 
arms to countries in an area of South America if the 
President believed the prohibition would promote 
peace. The Curtiss-Wright Corporation claimed that 
the power to make this determination was a legisla-
tive power that Congress could not delegate to the 
President. 
Witnesses at the hearings misread this case to justi-
fy their claim that the President had broad inherent 
foreign policy powers to the virtual exclusion of Con-
gress. Curtiss-Wright did not present any such issue. 
The case involved the question of the powers of the 
President in foreign policy where Congress expressly 
authorizes him to act; it did not involve the question

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 25 
of the President's foreign policy powers when Con-
gress expressly forbids him to act. 
In Curtiss-Wright, the Court upheld broad delega-
tions by Congress of power to the President in mat-
ters of foreign affairs. Writing for the Court, Justice 
Sutherland said that legislation within "the interna-
tional field must often accord to the President a 
degree of discretion and freedom from statutory re-
striction which would not be admissible were domes-
tic affairs alone involved." 21 
In language frequently seized on by those seeking 
to claim that the President's role in foreign policy is 
exclusive, Justice Sutherland noted that the President 
was acting not only with a delegation of power by 
the legislature, but also with certain powers the Con-
stitution gave directly to him: 
It is important to bear in mind that we are here 
dealing not alone with an authority vested in the 
President by an exertion of legislative power, but 
with such an authority plus the very delicate, 
plenary and exclusive power of the President as 
the sole organ of the federal government in the 
field of international relations?a power which 
does not require as a basis for its exercise an act 
of Congress, but which, of course, like every 
other governmental power, must be exercised in 
subordination to applicable provisions of the 
Constitution.22 
Some have tried to interpret this passage as stating 
that the President may act in foreign affairs against 
the will of Congress. But that is not what it says. As 
Justice Jackson later observed, the most that can be 
drawn from Justice Sutherland's language is the inti-
mation "that the President might act in external af-
fairs without congressional authority, but not that he 
might act contrary to an Act of Congress." 23 More 
recently, in Dames & Moore v. Regan," the Supreme 
Court cautioned that the broad language in Curtiss-
Wright must be viewed only in context of that case. 
Writing for the majority, Justice (now Chief Justice) 
Rehnquist expressed the Court's view of the appropri-
ate relationship between the executive and the legisla-
tive branches in the conduct of foreign policy: 
When the President acts pursuant to an express 
or implied authorization from Congress, he exer-
cises not only his powers but also those delegated 
by Congress. In such a case the executive action 
'would be supported by the strongest presump-
tions and widest latitude of judicial interpretation, 
and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily 
upon any who might attack it.' . . . When the 
President acts in the absence of congressional 
authorization he may enter a 'zone of twilight in 
which he and Congress may have concurrent au-
thority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.' 
. . . In such a case, the analysis becomes more 
complicated, and the validity of the President's 
action, at least so far as separation-of-powers 
principles are concerned, hinges on a consider-
ation of all the circumstances which might shed 
light on the views of the Legislative Branch 
toward such action, including 'congressional iner-
tia, indifference or quiescence.' . . . Finally, 
when the President acts in contravention of the 
will of Congress, 'his power is at its lowest ebb' 
and the Court can sustain his actions "only by 
disabling the Congress from action on the sub-
ject." 25 
Similarly, in 1981, the D.C. Circuit cautioned 
against undue reliance on the quoted passage from 
Curtiss-Wright: "To the extent that denominating the 
President as the 'sole organ' of the United States in 
international affairs constitutes a blanket endorsement 
of plenary Presidential power over any matter extend-
ing beyond the borders of this country, we reject that 
characterization." 26 
In calling the President the "sole organ" of the 
Nation in its relations with other countries, Justice 
Sutherland quoted from a speech by John Marshall in 
1800 when Marshall was a Member of the House of 
Representatives: "As Marshall said in his great argu-
ment of March 7, 1800, in the House of Representa-
tives, 'The President is the sole organ of the nation in 
its external relations, and its sole representative with 
foreign nations.' Annals, 6th Cong., col. 613." 27 
The reader might assume from this passage that 
Marshall advocated an exclusive, independent power 
for the President in the area of foreign affairs, free 
from legislative control. When his statement is placed 
in the context of the "great argument of March 7, 
1800," however, it is clear that Marshall regarded the 
President as simply carrying out the law as estab-
lished by statute or treaty. The House had been debat-
ing a decision by President John Adams to turn over 
to England a person charged with murder. Some 
members thought the President should be impeached 
for encroaching upon the judiciary, since the case was 
already pending in court. Marshall replied that Presi-
dent Adams was executing a treaty approved by the 
Senate that had the force of law. Here is the full 
context of Marshall's "sole organ" statement: 
The case was in its nature a national demand 
made upon the nation. The parties were the two 
nations. They cannot come into court to litigate 
their claims, nor can a court decide on them. Of 
consequence, the demand is not a case for judi-
cial cognizance. 
The President is the sole organ of the nation in 
its external relations, and its sole representative 
with foreign nations. Of consequence, the 
demand of a foreign nation can only be made on 
him.

Chapter 25 
He possesses the whole Executive power. He 
holds and directs the force of the nation. Of 
consequence, any act to be performed by the 
force of the nation is to be performed through 
him. 
He is charged to execute the laws. A treaty is 
declared to be law. He must then execute a 
treaty, where he, and he alone, possesses the 
means of executing it. 
The treaty, which is a law, enjoins the per-
formance of a particular object. The person who 
is to perform this object is marked out by the 
Constitution, since the person is named who con-
ducts the foreign intercourse, and is to take care 
that the laws be faithfully executed. The means 
by which it is to be performed, the force of the 
nation, are in the hands of this person. Ought not 
this person to perform the object, although the 
particular mode of using the means has not been 
prescribed? Congress, unquestionably, may pre-
scribe the mode, and Congress may devolve on 
others the whole execution of the contract; but, 
till this be done, it seems the duty of the Execu-
tive department to execute the contract by any 
means it possesses." 
Moreover, as Professor Corwin?a respected schol-
ar on the American Presidency?has written, al-
though Marshall referred to the President as the "sole 
organ of the nation in its external relations," 
"[c]learly, what Marshall had foremost in mind was 
simply the President's role as instrument of communi-
cation with other governments." 39 
While the President is not confined to acting 
merely as an "instrument of communication with 
other governments," neither does the President enjoy 
absolute or exclusive power in matters affecting for-
eign affairs. The Curtiss- Wright opinion itself notes 
that the President's authority in foreign affairs "must 
be exercised in subordination to the applicable provi-
sions of the Constitution." 30 
At the hearings, North cited to the circumstances 
surrounding Senate consideration of the Jay Treaty 
during the presidency of George Washington as sup-
port for his claim that the President had the power to 
withhold information from Congress. There, President 
Washington "refused to accede to a request to lay 
before the House of Representatives the instructions, 
correspondence and documents relating to the negoti-
ation of the Jay Treaty." 31 
Reliance on President Washington's position with 
respect to information about the Jay Treaty is errone-
ous. President Washington did not argue that he had 
the power to withhold documents from Congress. As 
the opinion in Curtiss- Wright makes clear, President 
Washington only withheld these "correspondence and 
documents" from one House of Congress, not from 
the entire legislative branch. He gave the documents 
390 
to the Senate; he withheld them from the House be-
cause the documents related to a treaty negotiation, 
and the power to ratify or reject treaties is reserved 
under the Constitution to the Senate. 
Circumvention of Congress' 
Constitutional Power of the Purse 
In testifying before these Committees, North and 
Poindexter indicated their view that whatever power 
Congress may have in foreign policy derived solely 
from its power of the purse. They reasoned that so 
long as public money was not expended, Congress 
had no role and the President was free to pursue his 
foreign policy goals using private and third-country 
funds. 
North said the President "was fully within his 
rights to send us off to talk to foreign heads of state, 
to seek the assistance of those foreign heads of state 
to use other than U.S. Government monies, and to do 
so without a Finding." 32 Poindexter supported the 
concept of circumventing Congressional opposition to 
the President's foreign policy by using nonappropriat-
ed funds: 
Congress has put some restrictions on the use of 
proposed funds. Those restrictions didn't apply to 
private funds. They didn't apply to third-country 
funds. 
And the restrictions in the Boland Amendment, 
as I have said, did not apply to the NSC staff.33 
These claims by North and Poindexter strike at the 
very heart of the system of checks and balances. To 
permit the President and his aides to carry out covert 
actions by using funds obtained from outside Congress 
undermines the Framer's belief that "the purse and 
the sword must never be in the same hands." 
These Committees have rejected these claims in 
Chapter 27. Suffice it to say here that, under the view 
of North and Poindexter, a President whose appro-
priation requests were rejected by Congress could 
raise money from private sources or third countries 
for armies, military actions, arms systems, and even 
domestic programs. That is the path to dictatorship. 
Besides usurping Congress' power of the purse, the 
use of foreign funds has another, equally dangerous, 
effect on our democratic processes. That effect was 
explored by a Member of the panel during McFar-
lane's testimony about the solicitation of Country 3 
for assistance to the Contras: 
Q: In October 1985 when the State Department 
was scheduling an appointment for Colonel 
North to meet with one of these countries that 
later contributed $2 million, I was involved in a 
tough legislative battle in this House. On October 
12, I believe, of 1985, this House passed a textile

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 25 
bill, very controversial. At that very time, Colo-
nel North apparently was soliciting, from a 
nation that was impacted by this bill, funds se-
cretly and that country later delivered $2 million, 
according to the testimony. 
The President vetoed that bill in December 
1985 and between December 1985 and August 
1986, when the Congress decided to sustain the 
President by an eight-vote margin, there were 
entreaties apparently made to many other nations 
that were impacted by this legislation. . . . 
So this is the type of thing that is extremely 
dangerous from a perception standpoint, is it not? 
A: I agree with that, yes. 
Q: I think I could go back into my District or 
around this country and say while I was fighting 
for this bill, unbeknownst to me one of the na-
tions that was severely impacted was secretly 
giving millions of dollars to the executive branch 
that later vetoed the bill, that ought to be disturb-
ing to me, don't you think? 
A: I agree sir.34 
It is a mistake for the United States to engage in 
what Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams 
called "tin cup" diplomacy. It is unseemly for a 
global superpower to ask other nations to finance its 
foreign policy. Moreover, allowing foreign policy to 
be conducted with funds supplied by private parties 
and foreign governments is likely to create the expec-
tation by the donor nations that they can expect 
something in return for their largesse. These concerns 
were, of course, raised by Congressional actions when 
in August 1985 it allowed the Administration to solic-
it humanitarian assistance for the the Contras from 
third countries. But since this decision was made 
openly and in accordance with the normal processes 
of government, the reward for any donor nation 
could also be openly considered and agreed upon by 
the executive and legislative branches. There would 
be no need to hide the help, and no reason to hide the 
reward. 
But by seeking private and third-country aid for the 
Contras without Congressional notification?much 
less approval?the Administration did more than 
engage in an unfortunate fundraising effort that 
opened the door to expectations of secret return 
favors. This clandestine financing operation under-
mined the powers of Congress as a coequal branch 
and subverted the Constitution. 
Foreign Policy as a Shared Power 
The sharing of power over foreign policy requires 
consultation, trust, and coordination. As President 
Reagan told a joint session of Congress on April 27, 
1983: "The Congress shares both the power and the 
responsibility for our foreign policy." 
In the aftermath of the Vietnam war, Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger observed: 
The decade-long struggle in this country over 
executive dominance in foreign affairs is over. 
The recognition that the Congress is a coequal 
branch of government is the dominant fact of 
national politics today. The executive accepts 
that the Congress must have both the sense and 
the reality of participation; foreign policy must be 
a shared enterprise." 
The need for such a cooperative relationship was 
stressed in the testimony received by these Commit-
tees from Secretary of State George Shultz and Sec-
retary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Each recog-
nized that both Congress and the Executive had fun-
damental duties in the area of foreign policy. 
Secretary Shultz rejected the notion that there is a 
need "to lie and cheat in order to be a public servant 
or to work in foreign policy." 36 He emphasized that 
Congress and the President must work cooperatively 
on foreign affairs: 
[W]e have to respect the fundamental duties of 
our colleagues on the Hill, but we have to expect 
them to respect ours and what that means is . . . 
while we have a system of separation of powers 
in the way it is constituted, it inevitably means 
we also have a system of sharing powers . . . . 
You have to have a sense of tolerance and re-
spect and a capacity to work together and a 
desire to do it, for us to share information, for 
you to put forward your ideas, not to keep telling 
us all the time how to run things. But keep tabs. 
To have a way of interacting . . . .37 
Secretary Weinberger was asked at the hearings 
whether frequent consultation with Congress on for-
eign policy issues was a valuable opportunity for the 
President. He replied: 
Indeed, yes, sir. Not only because it is very 
useful to have the advice . . . but I also think that 
it is important for the longer-range success of any 
kind of activity, because I have frequently made 
the point in private meetings that we can't fight a 
war on two fronts. 
We can't fight with the enemy, whoever it may 
be, and we can't fight with the Congress at the 
same time.

Chapter 25 
We need to have the United States Government 
unified if any kind of activity is going to succeed 
over the long run and we have a very different 
governmental system than most other countries. 
We deliberately divided authority and power to 
keep government ineffective and weak, that is 
what the Founders had in mind. They considered 
it to a considerable extent, but we can work 
within that. But we do have to do it in a way 
that gets as much general acceptance of a course 
before we embark on it whenever we possibly 
can as soon thereafter as we can.38 
Questioned further whether clandestine undertakings 
needed the support of the Congress, he replied: 
I think without any question, sir, because you 
frequently with clandestine activities, which we 
have to do in this kind of world, you are not able 
to have public support. 
So you certainly need to have Congressional un-
derstanding, Congressional approval wherever it 
can be obtained, and that is done through consul-
tation . . . .39 
In remarks to Poindexter near the end of Poin-
dexter's testimony before these Committees, a Repub-
lican Member of the House Select Committee high-
lighted the need for honest consultation where the 
392 
Constitution divides power among brandies of gov-
ernment: "The reason for not misleading the Congress 
is a practical one. It is stupid. It is self-defeating 
because while it may, in fact, allow you to prevail in 
the problem of the moment, eventually you destroy 
the President's credibility.'t40 
Conclusion 
The questions before these Committees concerning 
the foreign policy roles of Congress and the President 
are not abstract issues for legal scholars. They are 
practical considerations essential to the making of 
good foreign policy and the effective functioning of 
government. The theory of the Constitution is that 
policies formed through consultation and the demo-
cratic process are better, and wiser, than those formed 
without it. 
The Constitution divided foreign policy powers be-
tween the legislative and executive branches of gov-
ernment. That division of power is fundamental to 
this system, and acts as a check on the actions of each 
branch of government. Those who would take short-
cuts in the constitutional process?mislead the Con-
gress or withhold information?show their contempt 
for what the Framers created. Shortcuts that bypass 
the checks and balances of the system, and excessive 
secrecy by those who serve the President, do not 
strengthen the President. They weaken the President 
and the constitutional system of government.

Chapter 26 
The Boland Amendments and The NSC Staff 
Beginning in 1983, Congress responded to the Presi-
dent's policy toward the Contras principally through 
its power over appropriations?one of the crucial 
checks on Executive power in the Nation's system of 
checks and balances. Because the President's program 
depended upon providing financial assistance to the 
Contras, appropriations bills became the forum for 
debating what the Nation's policy should be. 
Aid to the Contras was controversial from the be-
ginning. The Kissinger Commission,' unanimous on 
virtually all other recommendations about Central 
America, could not agree on the Contras. The Ad-
ministration's justifications for aid to the Contras were 
sometimes contradictory. The President publicly 
denied that his goal was to overthrow the Sandinista 
Government. Yet the Contras pursued only one 
goal?to topple the Sandinistas. 
In Congress, the two Chambers found themselves 
at odds, with the House generally denying or restrict-
ing and the Senate generally supporting aid for the 
Contras. Votes in each Chamber were often decided 
by razor-thin margins. 
Ultimately, restrictions on assistance to the Contras 
were embodied in the Boland Amendments, named 
after their chief sponsor, Representative Edward P. 
Boland. While Congress applied various requirements 
to support for the Contras in each of the six fiscal 
years from October 1, 1982, to September 30, 1987, 
the legislation for fiscal years 1983, 1985, and 1986 
embodied the most important restrictions and will be 
designated Boland, I, II, and III, respectively. 
The Boland Amendments were compromises be-
tween supporters of the Administration's programs 
and opponents of Contra aid. As compromises, they 
were written not with the precision of a tax code, but 
in the language of trust and with the expectation that 
they would be carried out in good faith. None expect-
ed the Administration to secretly seek loopholes, or to 
lead Congress to believe that support was not being 
given to the Contras when, in fact, it was. 
This Chapter focuses on how the Boland Amend-
ments evolved2 and on how one element within the 
White House?the National Security Council staff?
discharged its trust under the Boland Amendments. 
Boland I: September 27, 1982, to 
December 7, 1983 
As has been noted in other chapters, the Administra-
tion's efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan resistance 
began not long after the Administration began. By the 
end of 1981, as required by law, the Administration 
was advising the Intelligence Committees in both 
chambers of Congress about the Central Intelligence 
Agency's involvement in Nicaragua, which was then 
funded out of the CIA's contingency reserve.2 Ac-
cording to the Administration, its covert activities 
were intended to interdict the flow of arms from 
Nicaragua to rebel forces opposing the government of 
El Salvador.4 Ultimately, both Intelligence Commit-
tees sought to curtail, or at least channel, the CIA's 
activities in the region by restricting the CIA's use of 
its contingency reserve funding. The first such restric-
tion was embodied in a classified annex to the intelli-
gence authorization bill for fiscal year 1983, which 
became effective September 27, 1982.5 
In late 1982, the American press began to report 
accounts of the Administration's "secret war" in 
Nicaragua.6 On December 8, 1982, Representative 
Tom Harkin offered an amendment to the pending 
Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1983 
stating: 
None of the funds provided in this Act may be 
used by the Central Intelligence Agency or the 
Department of Defense to furnish military equip-
ment, military training or advice, or other sup-
port for military activities, to any group or indi-
vidual, not a part of a country's armed forces, for 
the purpose of assisting that group or individual 
in carrying out military activities in or against 
Nicaragua. 7 
Soon thereafter, Representative Boland, Chairman 
of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelli-
gence, sponsored a substitute?referring explicitly to 
the overthrow of the Government of Nicaragua?that 
was to become Boland I: 
None of the funds provided in this Act may be 
used by the Central Intelligence Agency or the 
Department of Defense to furnish military equip-

ment, military training or advice, or other sup-
port for military activities, to any group or indi-
vidual, not a part of a country's armed forces, for 
the purpose of overthrowing the government of 
Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange be-
tween Nicaragua and Honduras.8 
Representative Boland said that this substitute was 
substantively identical to the restriction contained in 
the classified annex to the earlier enacted Intelligence 
Authorization Act and that it had been accepted by 
the Administration. "They do not like it," he said, 
"but it is agreeable to them." 9 
Representative Harkin countered almost immediate-
ly with a substitute of his own, which differed primar-
ily from Representative Boland's by focusing on the 
intent of the recipients of CIA assistance: 
None of the funds provided in this Act may be 
used by the Central Intelligence Agency or any 
agency of the Department of Defense to furnish 
military equipment, military training or advice, or 
other support for military activities, to any indi-
vidual or group which is not part of a country's 
armed forces and which is already known by that 
agency to have the intent of overthrowing the gov-
ernment of Nicaragua or of provoking a military 
conflict between Nicaragua and Honduras." 
Representative Harkin's substitute was defeated; 
Boland I prevailed by a vote of 411 to 0. 
In the Senate, a similar debate took place, but with 
a different outcome. On December 18, 1982, by a 
vote of 58 to 38, that body tabled a proposal spon-
sored by Senator Christopher J. Dodd that would 
have made a "policy declaration" that "no funds 
should be obligated or expended, directly or indirect-
ly, after January 20, 1983, in support of . . . paramili-
tary groups operating in Central America." 11 
Ultimately, the conference committee incorporated 
Boland I into the Defense Appropriations Act for 
fiscal year 1983, which became effective on Decem-
ber 21, 1982.12 Boland I was the law at least until 
October 1, 1983.13 
Within a few months of the enactment of Boland I, 
however, a dispute arose between the Administration 
and some Members of Congress, including Represent-
ative Boland, over the scope of the prohibition. Rep-
resentative Boland and others in Congress contended 
that the intent of the recipients of the aid governed 
the permissibility of assistance. No group that intend-
ed to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government could 
receive U.S. assistance, they said." 
The Administration took a more constricted view: 
as long as the United States itself was not seeking to 
overthrow the Sandinista Government, the objectives 
of the Contras to replace the Nicaraguan Government 
were irrelevant." As support for its position, the 
Administration pointed to the defeat of the second 
Harkin amendment, which would have barred assist-
396 
ance to the Contras because of their intent to over-
throw the Nicaraguan Government. While subsequent 
changes in the Boland amendments ultimately would 
render moot this particular dispute, the Administra-
tion's willingness, indeed eagerness, to exploit ambigu-
ities in Boland I presaged its attitude toward the later 
Congressional efforts to limit Administration support 
for the Contras. In addition, the aggressive approach 
by the Administration to this ambiguity helps to ex-
plain why the Boland Amendments evolved toward 
more restrictive formulations. 
Limited Funding: December 8, 
1983, to October 3, 1984 
As fiscal year 1983 progressed with Boland I in place, 
the Administration's support for the Contras contin-
ued. In addition, the Administration began to expand 
its justifications for the program beyond the interdic-
tion of arms to include bringing the Sandinistas to the 
bargaining table and forcing free elections.' 6 
As a result, on May 13, 1983, the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence reported out H.R. 
2760, a bill to amend the Intelligence Authorization 
Act for the then-current fiscal year that would have 
foreclosed funding for the Contras. In language that 
foreshadowed Boland II, that bill provided: 
None of the funds appropriated for the Central 
Intelligence Agency or any other department, 
agency, or entity of the United States involved in 
intelligence activities may be obligated or ex-
pended for the purpose or which would have the 
effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, mili-
tary or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by 
any nation, group, organization, movement, or 
individual.' 7 
The Senate never voted on H.R. 2760." Thus, 
Boland I continued to govern the Administration's 
relationship with the Contras through the remainder 
of fiscal year 1983.'? 
While H.R. 2760 was under consideration, howev-
er, both the House and the Senate were working on 
intelligence authorizations and defense appropriations 
for fiscal year 1984. As reported out by the House 
Intelligence Committee, the Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Bill, H.R. 2968, contained the same provisions 
cutting off funding for the Contras as did H.R. 
2760.2? 
Fiscal year 1984 was well under way before H.R. 
2968 reached the floor of the House.21 Again mem-
bers extensively debated the proper policy toward 
Nicaragua, and again voted to cut off covert aid, 243 
to 171.22 
On the Senate side, the intelligence authorization 
legislation was reported out of committee without any 
unclassified restriction on support for the Contras. On

Chapter 26 
November 3, 1983, after debate over the Administra-
tion's policies toward Nicaragua, the Senate approved 
an intelligence authorization bill that did not restrict 
assistance for the Contras.23 
The conference on the conflicting versions of the 
legislation was a pivotal point in the history of aid to 
the Contras. After the conference, Representative 
Boland explained the opening positions and the out-
come to his colleagues in the House: 
As you know, I believe [the Central Intelligence 
Agency's] paramilitary action in Nicaragua is ille-
gal, unwise, counterproductive, and against the 
best interest of the United States. 
I, and a majority of the House conferees, would 
have preferred that the covert action be stopped. 
This was the position of the House of Represent-
atives. 
Just as clearly, it was the position of the Senate 
conferees and of the Senate that the action 
should be permitted to continue and that when 
appropriated funds ran out, the Central Intelli-
gence Agency could utilize the reserve for con-
tingencies unless both Intelligence Committees 
disapproved. 
We could have forced a deadlock and killed both 
the Intelligence Authorization Bill and the De-
fense Appropriations Bill. 
But the Central Intelligence Agency would still 
have been able to fund the covert action from the 
Continuing Resolution and from the reserve for 
contingencies?and would have had available to 
it much more than $24 million. Instead, we 
agreed to a compromise?a $24 million cap on 
funding from whatever source.24 
The key to this compromise from the House's 
standpoint was the amount of aid provided, enough to 
carry the Contras "at present rate of expenditure" 
only through June 1984.25 At that point, according to 
Representative Boland, the Administration would 
have to terminate its covert program or come "back 
to both Houses of Congress and request additional 
funds. . . .,, 26 
The conference language, included in both the In-
telligence Authorization Act (Public Law 98-212) and 
the Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 98-215) 
for fiscal year 1984, read: 
During fiscal year 1984, not more than $24 mil-
lion of the funds available to the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, the Department of Defense, or 
any other agency or entity of the United States 
involved in intelligence activities may be obligat-
ed or expended for the purpose or which would 
have the effect of supporting, directly or indirect-
ly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicara-
gua by any nation, group, organization, move-
ment, or individual.27 
Significantly, these pieces of legislation, which 
became effective on December 8 and December 9, 
1983, included within the $24 million cap all funds 
expended to assist the Contras from the beginning of 
the fiscal year on October 1, 1983. Thus, by the time 
these enactments became law, there was already less 
than $24 million that could be provided by the cov-
ered agencies. 
Boland II: October 3, 1984, to 
December 3, 1985 
The period between October 12, 1984 (the effective 
date of Boland II), and August 8, 1985 (the effective 
date of the legislation providing for "humanitarian 
aid"), was the high-water mark of restrictions on as-
sisting the Contras. During this period, the covered 
agencies and entities were proscribed from expending 
any funds whatsoever to support, directly or indirect-
ly, those resistance forces. 
But Boland II was itself a compromise. As will be 
seen, even as Congress shut off aid at the beginning of 
fiscal year 1985, the Senate insisted on providing a 
procedure that might expedite support for the Contras 
after February 28, 1985, upon the passage of a joint 
resolution." An important question would also arise 
after the Committees began their investigation as to 
the application of Boland II to the NSC and its staff. 
As before, an examination of the events leading to this 
version of the Boland Amendment is essential to its 
understanding. 
The Evolution of Boland ll 
A major factor in the formulation and passage of 
Boland II was the revelation regarding the mining of 
Nicaraguan harbors. On April 6, 1984, The Wall 
Street Journal reported the CIA's involvement in that 
mining. Additionally, the CIA's role in military at-
tacks on Nicaraguan oil facilities at the port of Cor-
into was soon thereafter revealed." 
Many Members of Congress expressed astonishment 
at these revelations. A dispute arose as to whether 
CIA Director Casey had adequately notified the Intel-
ligence Committees. Senator Goldwater, Chairman of 
the Senate Committee, protested to Casey.3? National 
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane responded that 
Congress had been adequately briefed about the 
mining. In support of Senator Goldwater's position, 
his vice-chairman, Senator Moynihan, resigned from 
that post, only to be persuaded to stay on." Both the 
Senate and the House ultimately voted to condemn 
the CIA's involvement in the incident.32 The revela-
tions also produced an intense negative international 
reaction, particularly when Nicaragua sued the United

Chapter 26 
States in the International Court of Justice alleging, 
and ultimately proving to the satisfaction of that 
court, that the United States violated international 
law.33 
As the end of fiscal year 1984 approached, the 
House considered an Intelligence Authorization Bill 
(H.R. 5399), and a Continuing Appropriations Bill 
(H.J. Res. 648), both of which prohibited the use of 
any funds available to the CIA, DOD, or any entity 
involved in intelligence activities to support "directly 
or indirectly" military or paramilitary operations in 
Nicaragua. The prohibitory language was identical to 
that contained in H.R. 2760, the House's earlier, un-
successful attempt to amend the Intelligence Authori-
zation Act for fiscal year 1983. The House debated 
this version of the Boland Amendment on August 2, 
1984, and passed it by a vote of 294 to 118.34 
On the Senate side, the majority once again defeat-
ed an effort to include a parallel prohibition in that 
Chamber's version of intelligence authorization legis-
lation. The vote, which took place after lengthy 
debate on October 3, 1984, was 42 in favor of includ-
ing such a prohibition and 57 against.35 
The conferees ultimately agreed to adopt the House 
prohibition, but to couple it with an explicit promise 
to revisit the issue in another 4 months. As finally 
enacted, Section 8066 of Public Law 98-473, the Con-
tinuing Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1985, read: 
(a) During fiscal year 1985, no funds available to 
the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department 
of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the 
United States involved in intelligence activities 
may be obligated or expended for the purpose or 
which would have the effect of supporting, di-
rectly or indirectly, military or paramilitary oper-
ations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organi-
zation, movement, or individual. 
(b) The prohibition concerning Nicaragua con-
tained in subsection (a) shall cease to apply if, 
after February 28, 1985?
(1) the President submits to Congress a report?
(A) stating that the Government of Nicaragua is 
providing material or monetary support to anti-
government forces engaged in military or para-
military operations in El Salvador or other Cen-
tral American countries; 
(B) analyzing the military significance of such 
support; 
(C) stating that the President has determined that 
assistance for military or paramilitary operations 
prohibited by subsection (a) is necessary; 
(D) justifying the amount and type of such assist-
ance and describing its objectives; and 
398 
(E) explaining the goals of United States policy 
for the Central American region and how the 
proposed assistance would further such goals, in-
cluding the achievement of peace and security in 
Central America through a comprehensive, veri-
fiable and enforceable agreement based upon the 
Contadora Document of Objectives; and 
(2) a joint resolution approving assistance for 
military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua 
is enacted. 
According to the conferees, up to $14 million in aid 
to the Contras could be made available upon passage 
of the joint resolution described in Section 8066(b).36 
Representative Boland reported to his colleagues 
that: 
the compromise provision [Section 8066] clearly 
ends United States support for the war in Nicara-
gua. Such support for the war can only be re-
newed if the President can convince the Con-
gress that this very strict prohibition should be 
overturned.3 7 
Responding to an inquiry from another Member, Rep-
resentative Boland specified "there are no exceptions 
to the prohibition."35 Representative Boland plainly 
viewed the conference compromise as terminating all 
U.S. Government assistance of any kind until Con-
gress revisited the issue. 
On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate empha-
sized that the prohibition was not necessarily perma-
nent. As Senator Ted Stevens described it, the com-
promise did not cut the Contras' lifeline, but rather 
"[put] off the decision until next year." Reacting to a 
pessimistic assessment from Senator John P. East, he 
continued: 
Under these circumstances, I do believe the Sena-
tor would be unwise to send a message to the 
Sandinistas that we have abandoned completely 
support for the Contras. We have set in motion a 
process by which the President can once again 
trigger support for the Contras should the Sandi-
nista government persist [in exporting revolu-
tion]. 
I say to my friend we did not win and we did not 
lose. . . what we are saying to the Sandinistas is, 
"we have a period of time here because of our 
internal process and our process of selecting our 
leader for the next four years . . . and you are 
put on notice that if the President asks for this 
money on February 28 . . . we can approve 
it." 3 9 
In the interim, according to Senator Stevens, the Con-
tras would be able to tap other sources of support:

Chapter 26 
The Contras [already] are supporting themselves 
with assistance they are getting from elsewhere 
in the world. Having that assistance out there to 
be made available on March 31 will encourage 
that assistance from other sources to the Contras 
during this period.40 
Thus, while House conferees hailed Boland II as a 
victory in the effort to end U.S. involvement in Ni-
caragua's civil war, the Senate conferees billed it as a 
draw or, at worst, a temporary setback to be over-
come after the Presidential election. But not even 
Senator Stevens suggested that entities within the 
U.S. Government could continue covert support for 
the Contras after enactment of Boland II. 
As it turned out, Congress never approved the $14 
million allocation. President Reagan made the neces-
sary certification under Section 8066 early in April 
1985.4' The Senate approved the joint resolution on 
April 23, 1985, by a vote of 53 to 46.42 The measure 
failed in the House, however, by a vote of 180 to 
248.43 As a result, no funds should have been expend-
ed by covered entities to support the Contras from 
the exhaustion of the $24 million appropriation some-
time in June, 1984, to the effective date of legislation 
providing humanitarian aid, August 8, 1985. 
Boland ll and the NSC Staff 
Unlike Boland I, which applied by its terms solely 
to the CIA and the DOD, Boland II also applied to 
"any other agency or entity . . . involved in intelli-
gence activities." After this investigation began, mem-
bers of the Administration asserted that Boland II did 
not apply to the NSC staff. The Committees disagree, 
and note that this assertion never was made publicly 
prior to this investigation. 
By its terms, Boland II reached any agency "in-
volved in intelligence activities." Thus, Boland II did 
not put just the CIA out of the Contra support busi-
ness; it prevented other government agencies from 
covertly taking the CIA's place. 
The Administration has asserted that Boland II did 
not apply to the NSC staff because: (1) the NSC does 
not traditionally engage in intelligence activities; and 
(2) the phrase "agency involved in intelligence activi-
ties" is a statutory term of art which does not include 
the NSC. These post hoc arguments are not persua-
sive for a number of reasons. 
The statutory language is clear on its face: if an 
agency is "involved in intelligence activities," then it 
cannot engage in the proscribed conduct of assisting 
the Contras. That Boland II did not specifically men-
tion the NSC is of no consequence. The statute men-
tioned by name those agencies which Congress knew 
would be engaged in intelligence activities, and in-
cluded a "catch-all" provision to describe all other 
agencies that were intended to fall within Boland II's 
reach. This "catch-all" provision is no statutory term 
of art. Rather, the phrase used by Congress?"any 
other agency or entity . . . involved in intelligence 
activities"?is descriptive. For instance, had the NSC 
staff remained true to the NSC's traditional statutory 
functions of coordination and oversight, Boland II 
would not have applied to its activities. 
Thus, the law could not be evaded by assigning the 
prohibited activities or the persons engaged in those 
activities to a government agency that typically did 
not engage in "intelligence activities." Any other in-
terpretation would have rendered the law meaning-
less. The target of Boland II was not the CIA, but 
any covert operation supporting the Contras, directly 
or indirectly. Shifting responsibility from the CIA to 
the NSC staff would have accomplished nothing, 
other than to change the personnel running the 
Contra support operation. 
North and Poindexter, however, both testified that 
there was discussion among the NSC staff after 
Boland II was adopted that it did not apply to the 
NSC staff. No documentary evidence exists, however, 
to suggest that this interpretation was ever put for-
ward before August 1985. On the contrary, North's 
memos and McFarlane's and Poindexter's responses in 
late 1984 and early 1985 reflect a sensitivity that, at 
least for the record, the NSC staff had to comply 
with Boland. McFarlane in his public testimony 
scoffed at the view that Boland II did not apply to 
the NSC staff 44?even though, because McFarlane 
had not sought immunity, it was in his interest to 
deny Boland's applicability. 
If North and Poindexter had any doubt about the 
reach of Boland II, they could have obtained legal 
opinions. The Office of Legal Counsel of the Depart-
ment of Justice exists to provide legal opinions to the 
executive branch. The Counsel to the President also 
renders legal opinions on statutory interpretation; and 
the Attorney General issues both informal and formal 
opinions from time to time. But the Justice Depart-
ment, the Counsel to the President, and the Attorney 
General were never asked for legal opinions on 
whether Boland II applied to the NSC staff." 
North testified that Professor John Norton Moore 
of the University of Virginia gave him an opinion that 
Boland II did not apply to the NSC.48 Moore is a 
distinguished professor of law who has written exten-
sively on Executive power. His opinion would carry 
weight. But Moore has denied that he had ever been 
asked for or given an opinion on the applicability of 
Boland 11.47 No written evidence of such an opinion 
exists. 
Because McFarlane headed the NSC staff as Na-
tional Security Adviser at the time Boland II was 
enacted, his contemporaneous interpretation of the ap-
plicability of Boland II to that staff carries consider-
able weight. According to McFarlane: 
. . . [T]he law expressly foreclosed even a liaison 
role for the CIA, or for the Defense Department.

Chapter 26 
I interpreted it as well that the NSC was not to 
itself get involved in military or paramilitary ac-
tivities or replicating the CIA function in those 
domains.48 
Indeed, McFarlane acted on this interpretation.49 
Such a contemporaneous reading carries the most 
weight when, as in this matter, the official making the 
interpretation informed Congress of it." McFarlane's 
correspondence with Representative Lee H. Hamil-
ton, Representative Michael D. Barnes, and Senator 
David Durenberger all reflected his understanding." 
Legal analysis available at the time reached the 
same conclusion. An undated memorandum prepared 
by the Congressional Research Service of the Library 
of Congress in response to an inquiry dated August 
13, 1985, found "strong, if not conclusive evidence 
that the [language] was intended to apply to the Na-
tional Security Council."" Similarly, a staff memo-
randum prepared for Representative Henry J. Hyde, 
which the FBI later found in North's files, explained 
that the "NSC is clearly a U.S. entity involved in 
intelligence activities, subject to the Section 8066(a) 
prohibition." 53 
The opposing view, that the Boland prohibition did 
not apply to the NSC staff, found its only contempo-
raneous expression in an opinion by Bretton Sciaroni, 
counsel to the Intelligence Oversight Board." During 
Sciaroni's testimony, however, questions were raised 
about his qualifications to render this opinion. He had 
never practiced law before becoming the Board coun-
sel." This written opinion was his first on legisla-
tion.96 
More importantly, Sciaroni based his opinion on 
certain key factual premises that turned out to be 
incorrect. Addressing the statute's language, Sciaroni 
admitted in his opinion that, "on the face of it the 
NSC would appear to be an agency or entity of the 
United States covered by the amendment."97 He con-
cluded that the NSC was not an agency or entity 
"involved" in intelligence activities from the factual 
premise that "it is a coordinating body with no oper-
ational role," so that the NSC "does not function as 
an operational unit."58 
North, however, confirmed that he had been con-
ducting the "full-service covert operation," depicted 
in extensive evidence before the Committees. By 
itself, this assertion put the NSC within Boland II's 
coverage of "any agency or entity of the United 
States Government involved in intelligence activi-
ties." 
Asked at the hearings, "[were you] told at that time 
that [the NSC staff] was, in fact, involved in intelli-
gence operations?" Sciaroni responded, "No, I was 
not told that."99 He explained more fully: 
Q: Well, I am simply asking you, sir, isn't it true 
that the conclusion [of your opinion] was based 
on failure to communicate information to you? 
400 
A: True. 
Q: You didn't have the facts? 
A: That is true. 
Q: And it was the incorrect facts in part upon 
which your opinion was based? 
A: That is absolutely correct." 
In any event, the Sciaroni opinion was not unveiled 
until long after North's activities began to unravel. 
Poindexter acknowledged his reason for keeping its 
conclusion under wraps: fear that if Congress learned 
that the NSC staff was even entertaining the notion 
that it was exempt from Boland II, Congress would 
act to eliminate any such misconception." Instead, 
Congress was told that the NSC staff was observing 
the letter and spirit of Boland. 
In August 1985, the House and Senate Intelligence 
Committees and the House Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee each inquired about the activities of the NSC staff 
and of North. McFarlane replied that the NSC was 
complying with the letter and spirit of the law." 
Poindexter denied that he saw this response at the 
time, although the record shows that he assembled 
the team to handle the response and that he was sent 
a draft for comment." He claimed that, when he 
finally saw the McFarlane draft in the Tower Review 
Board Report, he was surprised by its language." 
But, in the summer of 1986, the House Intelligence 
Committee would conduct another inquiry of North, 
an inquiry Poindexter deflected by noting that 
McFarlane had previously certified that "the actions 
of the National Security Council staff were in compli-
ance with both the spirit and the letter of the law 
regarding support of the Nicaraguan resistance."" 
The message to Congress was clear and consistent: 
Boland II did not need clarification. It covered the 
NSC, which "was complying." Indeed, no one ex-
pressed this more forcefully than McFarlane at the 
public hearings: 
And I think also that the evidence that surely I 
did believe that the Boland Amendment applied 
to the NSC staff is expressed in the fact that 
otherwise why would we have worked so hard 
to get rid of it after it was passed? If we felt that 
we were not covered, what was I doing? What 
were we doing coming up here day after day 
trying to get rid of it? 66 
Even by its terms, the Sciaroni opinion did not give 
North?or Poindexter?a clean bill of health. Sciaroni 
noted that if North's salary was borne by the DOD, 
an entity expressly named in Boland II, he could be 
subject to its restrictions. This, in fact, was the case." 
Referring to this caveat in Sciaroni's opinion, Poin-
dexter testified in his deposition that, "we were will-

Chapter 26 
ing to take some risks in order to keep the Contras 
alive. . .?,, 68 
The Meaning of "Indirect" Support 
Boland II prohibited the obligation or expenditure 
of appropriated funds "for the purpose or which 
would have the effect of supporting" the Contras 
"directly or indirectly." Viewed narrowly, this statute 
forbade only the provision of government money or 
material to the Contras. 
Representative Boland, on the other hand, read his 
amendment more broadly at the time of its enactment 
so as to give meaning to the phrase "directly or 
indirectly": 
Let me make very clear that this prohibition ap-
plies to all funds available in fiscal year 1985 
regardless of any accounting procedure at any 
agency. It clearly prohibits any expenditure, in-
cluding those from accounts for salaries and all 
support costs. The prohibition is so strictly writ-
ten that it also prohibits transfers of equipment 
acquired at no cost.69 
Opinions issued by the Comptroller General of the 
United States in other contexts would seem to con-
firm Representative Boland's interpretation.70 More-
over, McFarlane candidly told the Committees that, 
during his tenure as National Security Adviser, he 
understood that Boland II precluded any assistance by 
the NSC staff to the Contras." 
Once again, North took a position contrary to that 
of his former boss. After describing his "full-service 
covert operation,"" North agreed on the one hand 
that the Boland Amendment applied to "U.S. Govern-
ment funds": 
And my understanding?and I have not read 
Boland, the Boland amendments in some time, 
but my understanding then was that what we 
could not do is take and expend funds which had 
been made available to the CIA and the DOD, et 
cetera, for the purpose of providing direct or 
indirect support for military and paramilitary op-
erations in Nicaragua. 
That is a memory that is over seven months old, 
but I think that was what the intent was. 
Certainly the way we pursued it and we made 
every effort not to expend U.S. Government 
funds to support the Nicaraguan resistance. . . .73 
On the other hand, North did not count fixed operat-
ing costs, such as his appropriated salary, as covered 
by the Boland II prohibition: 
Q: You were aware, I take it, that salaries were 
included in the Boland Amendment? 
A: No?not mine.74 
But, as noted above, Representative Boland clearly 
considered salaries within the ambit of the legislation 
he sponsored. 
The historical background provides the reason for 
Boland II's comprehensive coverage. Boland II had 
emerged in reaction to the revelation of the CIA's 
role in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors. At that 
time, the CIA had allegedly exceeded the $24 million 
limit in conducting that operation. According to re-
ports, the CIA had attempted to obscure this overrun 
by charging to its overall operating budget the $1.2 
million cost of a vessel deployed during the mining of 
the harbors." Representative Boland's explanation 
that the amendment "clearly prohibits any expendi-
ture, including those from accounts for salaries and all 
support costs" anticipated and rejected use of a ra-
tionalization similar to North's by which costs 
charged to an "overall operating budget" were ig-
nored for determining compliance with a funding cut-
off. The prohibition against the CIA funds "available" 
to it precluded that agency from using its contingency 
reserve or any funds at its disposal. 
In the Committees' view, Boland II had a discerni-
ble purpose: to end covert support for the Contras by 
the United States. Once the NSC staff became in-
volved in intelligence operations and continuing 
covert, albeit quasi-private, assistance to the Contras, 
both the letter and spirit of Boland II were violated. 
Humanitarian Aid: August 8, 1985, to 
March 31, 1986 
The day after rejecting the joint resolution required 
by Boland II to "unfence" the $14 million in military 
aid, the House?by a vote of 213 to 215?rejected an 
amendment that would have released that amount as 
"humanitarian assistance." 76 
Six weeks later, in June 1985, the Senate consid-
ered, and the House reconsidered, the concept of hu-
manitarian aid to the Contras. In both Chambers, pro-
ponents stressed the Contras' needs for food, clothing, 
and medical supplies." In both Chambers, opponents 
suggested that the provision of humanitarian assist-
ance to a fighting force was a Trojan horse conceal-
ing military assistance." 
The Senate approved its version of this legislation 
on June 6, by a vote of 52 to 42. In addition to 
unfencing the previously appropriated $14 million, it 
authorized an additional $24 million, with the entire 
$38 million to be spent solely on humanitarian aid.79 
Thereafter, a major reversal occurred in the House. 
On June 12, that Chamber voted 248 to 184 to include 
$27 million in humanitarian aid in a supplemental ap-
propriations bill." This change may have been attrib-
utable, at least in part, to a highly publicized trip 
made by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to 
Moscow shortly before that vote." 
During consideration of this legislation, some atten-
tion was focused on which agency would administer 
401

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 26 
the humanitarian assistance. The Senate bill included a 
provision allowing "the National Security Council to 
monitor the use of funds."82 This approach would 
have given the NSC staff a legal role in managing 
funds for the Contras. Proposals for a CIA role were 
also made. On the other hand, the House, opposed 
any statutory role for DOD or CIA." 
In the end, the conferees declined to include the 
NSC in the administration of the humanitarian aid 
program.84 Instead, the Nicaraguan Humanitarian As-
sistance Office (NHAO) was created in the Depart-
ment of State to administer the humanitarian aid. Sig-
nificantly, the NHAO appropriation retained the pro-
hibitions of Boland II except for that relaxation neces-
sary to authorize the humanitarian aid itself. In addi-
tion, related legislation included: 
?The "Pell Amendment," a prohibition against 
the United States "enter[ing] into any arrange-
ment conditioning, expressly or implicitly, the 
provision of assistance under [the International 
Security and Development Act] or the purchase 
of defense articles and services under the Arms 
Export Control Act upon the provision of assist-
ance by a recipient" to the Contras;85 and 
?The "Kerry Amendment," which prohibited 
the use of any funds to support, "directly or 
indirectly, activities against the government of 
Nicaragua which have not been authorized by, or 
pursuant to law, and which would place the 
United States" in violation of international law.86 
All these provisions became effective on August 8, 
1985. 
Exchange of Intelligence 
One week later, the President signed a Supplemen-
tal Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1985, Public 
Law 99-88, that included another provision relevant 
to the Committees' inquiry. After incorporating by 
reference the prohibitions contained in Boland II and 
suspending those prohibitions only insofar as neces-
sary to distribute the humanitarian aid authorized a 
week earlier, the Act provided: 
Nothing in this Act [or Boland II] shall be con-
strued to prohibit the United States government 
from exchanging information with the Nicara-
guan democratic resistance.87 
The conference report accompanying the earlier 
legislation providing humanitarian assistance similarly 
prescribed that, "none of the prohibitions on the pro-
vision of military or paramilitary assistance to the 
democratic resistance prohibits the sharing of intelli-
gence information with the democratic resistance."88 
Beginning with the enactment of Boland II, debate 
had arisen over the permissibility and desirability of 
providing the Contras with intelligence information. 
402 
Keyed as it was to the expenditure or obligation of 
funds, including salaries and support costs, Boland II 
prohibited any significant transfer of intelligence in-
formation or resources to the Contras. This conclu-
sion is bolstered by the legislative history of H.R. 
2760, the textually similar but unapproved amendment 
to the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 
1983.89 
The breadth of Boland II's original prohibition had 
raised concern in the intelligence community about 
the handling of "defensive" intelligence, that is, intel-
ligence that, if provided to the Contras, could prevent 
needless loss of life. 
Responding to this perceived problem, the CIA had 
proposed guidelines, which met resistance from the 
House Intelligence Committee, that would have al-
lowed it to pass intelligence: 
on a case by case basis where: 
(1) the lives of U.S. persons are at stake either 
inside or outside Nicaragua; 
(2) the lives of third country non-combatants are 
at stake either inside or outside Nicaragua; or 
(3) a holocaust-type situation may occur involv-
ing substantial loss of life, or threatening the con-
tinued existence of the opposition groups (for ex-
ample, ambush or imminent attack)." 
Ultimately, the CIA agreed to notify the Intelli-
gence Committees each time they invoked these 
guidelines to transfer intelligence, and to justify that 
action fully as a humanitarian necessity." 
While textual support in Boland II for a distinction 
between offensive and defensive intelligence is diffi-
cult to discern, the abstract utility of defensive intelli-
gence had some appeal. Speaking against an amend-
ment to provide a more explicit exception allowing 
for the exchange of intelligence, Representative 
Boland pointed to the CIA's guidelines: 
[W]hat about a situation where a large concentra-
tion of Contras?perhaps unarmed or in a sanctu-
ary along the border?is about to be attacked by 
the Sandinistas in their new Soviet helicopters. 
Can't the Central Intelligence Agency warn 
them? 
Well, Mr. Chairman, they can. 
Now, where do I get that interpretation? 
I get it, Mr. Chairman, from the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. 
They have told the Intelligence Committee that it 
is their interpretation of the present limitation 
that it does not prohibit the provision of intelli-
gence?so called defensive intelligence?to the

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 26 
Contras to prevent a massacre or a holocaust-
type of situation. 
They say they can't provide intelligence to sup-
port military activities in the field, but they can 
provide humanitarian warning of catastrophic at-
tacks. 
So, Mr. Chairman, my amendment [which would 
have continued the Boland II prohibitions] does 
permit?as the intelligence community tells us?
the provision of intelligence in extraordinary cir-
cumstances where the real prospect of a substan-
tial loss of life exists.92 
The legislation that became effective August 15, 
1985, provided that nothing in Boland II or the Inter-
national Security and Development Act would there-
after prohibit "exchanging information" with the Con-
tras. As the legislative history makes clear, moreover, 
the "information" that could be exchanged included 
intelligence." Representative Hyde, a supporter of 
the exception, suggested that the exception would 
allow the transfer of intelligence, not only in support 
of humanitarian aid, but also "so [the Contras] can 
defend themselves against the helicopter gunships."94 
Representative Joseph P. Addabbo, an opponent of 
the exception, cited its ambiguity as a reason to reject 
it: 
Under Section 102 . . . the current prohibition 
. . . is interpreted to allow the United States 
government to exchange information with the 
Contras. I am not sure anybody can tell me the 
effect of this interpretation but, of course, this 
would mean that the Central Intelligence Agency 
involvement with the Contras would be started 
again. What type of information will be ex-
changed is limited only by your imagination. In 
addition to intelligence information, could train-
ing procedures for the Contras be exchanged, 
could instruction in terrorist activities be ex-
changed, could instruction on the planting of 
bombs or ships be exchanged? Who would define 
the type of information to be exchanged? Nobody 
knows, is the answer.95 
The Permissibility of Solicitation 
Boland II did not contain a provision specifically 
addressing third-country solicitation. But the subject 
had not been overlooked either in Congress or in the 
executive branch. 
In 1984, before Boland II was adopted but as 
Contra funding was running out, third-country fund-
ing became the focus of a legal debate within the 
Administration. At a National Security Planning 
Group meeting in June 1984, Secretary of State 
Shultz conveyed the concern of White House Chief 
of Staff James A. Baker, III, who was not present, 
that solicitation and control of third-country funding 
for the Contra program was an "impeachable of-
fense." Others at the meeting asserted that if the 
United States did not serve as a conduit for the funds, 
third country solicitation was permissible. The follow-
ing day, Attorney General William French Smith 
orally expressed his opinion to Casey that solicitation 
was lawful as long as there was no quid pro quo." In 
October 1984, Congress complicated the legal picture 
further by passing Boland II with its prohibition of 
expending funds to provide support, "directly or indi-
rectly." 
After Boland II was in place, the State Department 
agreed in early 1985 that the legislation barred solici-
tation or encouragement of contributions to the Con-
tras. In March 1985, appearing before the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations, Assistant Secretary 
of State for Inter-American Affairs, A. Langhorne 
Motley?Elliott Abrams' predecessor?was asked for 
assurances that the Administration knew, and agreed, 
that solicitation of funds from third countries was 
prohibited; he agreed with that interpretation and 
gave those assurances. Motley stated, "even if today 
we wanted to go to third countries to encourage or 
solicit, we could not because there is a prohibition." 
Senator Christopher J. Dodd asked, "all I am 
asking from you is, and from the administration more 
directly, is whether or not we can have an assurance 
that there will be no indirect efforts made to finance 
the Contra operation through third party 
nation . . . ." Motley responded: "I think that was 
one thing that was loud and clear with us when I 
started. I told you that we understood what it means, 
direct and indirect, including third party." 
After being asked again, and giving that same assur-
ance (Senator Dodd: "We have that assurance, then?" 
Motley: "That is right. . . . I think that is an easy 
assurance to give, Senator. . . ."), Motley described 
Boland II's prohibition this way: 
Nobody is trying to play games with you or any 
other Member of Congress. That resolution 
stands, and it will continue to stand, and it says 
no direct or indirect. And that is pretty plain 
English; it does not have to be written by any 
bright, young lawyers. And we are going to con-
tinue to comply with that.97 
The State Department gave the same interpretation 
and assurance in at least one other hearing." The 
CIA also took the position that Boland II prohibited 
it from engaging in any third-country solicitation.99 
McFarlane took a similar position with respet to 
the NSC and, according to his testimony, so instruct-
ed his staff.'" He specifically told Congress that the 
NSC staff was not soliciting funds.'" North denied 
receiving any such instruction, but nevertheless pre-
faced every meeting with potential contributors with 
a disclaimer that he was not soliciting.102

Chapter 26 
Indeed, North wrote a memorandum to McFarlane 
outlining the options for financing the Contras. He 
noted that Boland II was silent on third-country fund-
ing but that Congress would regard it as an evasion of 
the law. He therefore concluded that third-country 
solicitation could be safely undertaken only upon con-
sultation with Congress and with the risk that it might 
say no.'" At the time North wrote the memoran-
dum, he was secretly involved in trying to raise 
money from Far Eastern countries, and a Middle 
Eastern country had already contributed $32 million. 
On August 8, 1985, with the enactment of the Pell 
Amendment, U.S. officials were prohibited from 
agreeing, "expressly or implicitly," that foreign aid or 
military assistance would be contingent upon assist-
ance to the Contras. In their report on that legislation, 
the conferees attempted to draw a distinction between 
discussing U.S. policies in Central America and agree-
ing on a quid pro quo: 
The purpose of the [Pell Amendment] is to pro-
hibit the United States from furnishing economic 
or military assistance or selling United States 
military equipment on the condition, either ex-
pressly or implicitly, that the recipient or pur-
chaser provide assistance to insurgents involved 
in the struggle in Nicaragua. This section does 
not prohibit United States government officials 
from discussing United States policy in Central 
America with recipients of United States assist-
ance or purchasers of United States military 
equipment.10 4 
The conferees specified that the legislation did not 
prohibit "recipients of United States assistance from 
furnishing assistance to any third party on their own 
volition and from their own resources."105 
Thus, at least as of August 8, 1985, while Congress 
acknowledged that Administration officials were per-
mitted to discuss Central American policy with for-
eign countries, and that those foreign countries could 
"on their own volition" contribute their own funds to 
the Contras, it clearly proscribed any quid pro quo, 
expressed or implied, for any contribution by a for-
eign country.106 A question not addressed by the 
conferees was whether Administration officials could, 
consistent with Boland II, solicit contributions from 
foreign countries. In the Committees' judgment, how-
ever, any such solicitation by a covered entity, includ-
ing the NSC staff, would have been prohibited by 
Boland II because it would have involved, at a mini-
mum, salaried employees. 
Boland III: December 4, 1985, to 
October 17, 1986 
Boland III was embodied in various statutory provi-
sions covering aid to the Contras during the period 
from December 4, 1985 to October 17, 1986, particu-
404 
larly in Public Law 99-169, Section 105, and Public 
Law 99-190, Section 8050. Public Laws 99-88 and 99-
83, which approved humanitarian assistance, extend 
into this period but are considered in the previous 
section of this chapter. 
Public Law 99-169, enacted on December 4, 1985, 
reads: 
Funds available to the Central Intelligence 
Agency, the Department of Defense, or any 
other agency or entity of the United States in-
volved in intelligence activities may be obligated 
and expended during fiscal year 1986 to provide 
funds, materiel, or other assistance to the Nicara-
guan democratic resistance to support military or 
paramilitary operations in Nicaragua only as au-
thorized in section 101 and as specified in the 
classified Schedule of Authorizations referred to 
in section 102, or pursuant to section 502 of the 
National Security Act of 1947, or to section 106 
of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1985 
(Public Law 99-88). Nothing in this section pre-
cludes?(1) administration, by the Nicaraguan 
Humanitarian Assistance Office established by 
Executive order 12530, of the program of human-
itarian assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic 
resistance provided for in the Supplemental Ap-
propriations Act, 1985, or (2) activities of the 
Department of State to solicit such humanitarian 
assistance for the Nicaraguan democratic resist-
ance. 
Public Law 99-190, Section 8050, became effective 
on December 19, 1985, and reads: 
None of the funds available to the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, the Department of Defense, or 
any other agency or entity of the United States 
involved in intelligence activities may be obligat-
ed or expended during fiscal year 1986 to provide 
funds, materiel, or other assistance to the Nicara-
guan democratic resistance unless in accordance 
with the terms and conditions specified by sec-
tion 105 of the Intelligence Authorization Act 
(Public Law 99-169) for fiscal year 1986. 
A classified amount was appropriated to the CIA to 
provide the Contras with communication equipment 
and related training. An additional classified amount 
was allocated to bolster intelligence-gathering in the 
region. Thus, Boland III permitted covered agencies 
to support the Contras only in particular ways, specif-
ically by the provision of communications equipment, 
related training, and intelligence "information and 
advice." 
Exchange of Intelligence 
The Administration's ability to offer intelligence to 
the Contras, first acknowledged in August 1985, con-

Chapter 26 
tinued with the enactment of Boland III. In addition, 
specific, classified appropriations were made to en-
hance the exchanges of intelligence. But ambiguities 
as to the scope of the exception persisted. 
The CIA, for example, believed that it was not 
authorized to provide specialized logistics training.'" 
The President's Intelligence Oversight Board, on the 
other hand, interpreted the legislation as allowing 
military training, "so long as such training does not 
amount to the participation in the planning or execu-
tion of military or paramilitary operations in Nicara-
gua.,9 os 
Solicitation 
Section 105(bX2) of Public Law 99-169 explicitly 
stated that "nothing in this section 
precludes . . . activities of the Department of State 
to solicit . . . humanitarian assistance for the Nicara-
guan democratic resistance." The Administration had 
sought this exception, but notably did not ask for 
permission to solicit lethal aid. The House conferees, 
moreover, specified that Boland III was intended to 
prohibit any solicitation that it did not authorize ex-
plicitly: 
[The] State Department may solicit, through its 
normal diplomatic contacts, humanitarian assist-
ance of the same type as is authorized by the 
Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 
1985. No other department or agency involved in 
intelligence activities may engage in any type of 
solicitation for the Contras.109 
Renewed Assistance: October 18, 1986,

By mid-1986, the mood of Congress had shifted 
back in favor of supporting the Contras. Ultimately, 
Congress would provide $100 million for the Nicara-
guan opposition, of which $70 million could be used 
for non-humanitarian purposes. 
This swing began on March 27, 1986, when the 
Senate approved S.J. Res. 283 to provide $100 million 
for the anti-Sandinista forces. Senator Lugar spon-
sored an amendment that contained no restrictions on 
the use of the CIA; it passed by a vote of 53 to 47.110 
Amendments offered by Senators Edward M. Kenne-
dy and Jim Sasser seeking to prevent funds from 
being used for military purposes were rejected.11' 
On June 25, 1986, the House approved an amend-
ment offered by Representative Don Edwards, which 
became Title II of the Military Construction Appro-
priation Act for Fiscal Year 1987, by a vote of 221 to 
209.112 Under this legislation, $100 million of unobli-
gated DOD funds for fiscal year 1986 could be used 
for the Nicaraguan opposition."3 On August 13, 
1986, the Senate adopted the House position and sub-
sequently approved the entire bill. Title II was ulti-
mately incorporated into Public Law 99-500, which 
became effective on October 18, 1986.114 
The Boland Amendments Were 
Violated in Letter and Spirit 
Boland II forced the CIA to withdraw from its role 
of fmancing, arming, training, _clothing, feeding, and 
supervising the Contras. But the vacuum was quickly 
filled. Acting to carry out ,the President's direction to 
keep the Contras together "body and soul," North, 
with the express approval of Poindexter and at least 
the acquiescence of McFarlane, took over where the 
CIA left off. With North as the action officer, the 
NSC staff raised funds from third countries, directed 
whether those funds should be sent to Secord or 
Calero, recruited the Enterprise to handle the logis-
tics, helped the Enterprise run the resupply operation 
for the men in the field, and gave the ultimate direc-
tions to Secord and his aides on how to conduct the 
operation. Even an ambassador, Lewis Tambs, took 
orders from North on opening a front against the 
Sandinistas. 
An isolated act of assisting the Contras may have 
presented a close question of law under Boland II and 
III. But the NSC staff's activities were not so limited. 
Its support for the Contras was systematic and perva-
sive. As the CIA had done before Boland II, the NSC 
staff now ran the Contra insurgency. According to 
Poindexter, North "was the switching point that made 
the whole system work . . . . I viewed 011ie as the 
kingpin to the Central American opposition once the 
CIA was restricted." 5 
Moreover, while the NSC staff started its support 
of the Contras at least in part with private funds, the 
diversion gave it control over funds that belonged to 
the United States. The profits that were skimmed 
were generated by the sale of weapons belonging to 
the United States. North, sometimes with the assist-
ance of Earl, fixed the mark-up to ensure that there 
would be money to divert. The Secord-Hakim Enter-
prise was not only brought into the sales as the "agent 
of the CIA," but, according to Hakim's and Secord's 
testimony, functioned at North's direction. 
Because Boland II and III both prohibited direct or 
indirect use of the United States funds, the diversion 
was a flagrant violation of those proscriptions. 
Even the amendment to Boland III, authorizing the 
State Department to solicit humanitarian funds for the 
Contras, was abused by the NSC. When Brunei 
agreed to transfer $10 million, North gave Abrams 
the account number of Lake Resources. According to 
Abrams, North represented that this account was one 
of Calero's and that the money would be used for 
non-lethal expenditures. But, in fact, it was controlled 
by the Enterprise and was used to pay for arms for 
the Contras, to pay their leaders, and to finance the 
military airlift. Giving Abrams the Lake Resources

account was a deliberate effort to divert funds solicit-
ed for humanitarian purposes to lethal ends, and was 
foiled only because of an error in the account 
number. 
The Administration only recently has asserted that 
Congress lacked the authority to restrict the Presi-
dent's options in Nicaragua in the manner it did. As in 
the case of the Sciaroni opinion, at no time prior to 
public disclosure of alleged violations of the Boland 
Amendments did the Administration come forward to 
challenge their constitutionality. On the contrary, 
Congress and the American people were routinely 
being assured that the statutes were being observed, 
"in letter and in spirit." As President Reagan himself 
stated during a press conference on April 14, 1983, 
"But what I might wish or our government might 
wish still would not justify us violating the law of the 
land."" 6 
Surely an Administration should identify in a timely 
fashion those laws it claims a constitutional preroga-
tive to ignore or subvert. But even beyond the aura of 
disingenuousness, the attack on the constitutionality of 
the Boland Amendment falls, in the Committees' col-
lective opinion, far short of the mark. 
The analysis must begin, of course, with an appro-
priate statement of what is, and is not, in issue. Some 
have attempted, for example, to cast the Boland 
Amendments as violative of the Supreme Court's 
famous dictum in United States v. Curtiss-Wright 
Export Corp.,117 referring to: 
the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of 
the President as the sole organ of the federal 
government in the field of international rela-
tions?a power which does not require as a basis 
for its exercise an act of Congress . . ." 
But one does not have to be a proponent of an 
imperial Congress to see that this language has little 
application to the situation presented here. We are not 
confronted with a situation where the President is 
claiming inherent constitutional authority in the ab-
sence of an Act of Congress. Instead, to succeed on 
this argument the Administration must claim it retains 
authority to proceed in derogation of an Act of Con-
gress?and not just any act, at that. Here, Congress 
relied on its traditional authority over appropriations, 
the "power of the purse," to specify that no funds 
were to be expended by certain entities in a certain 
fashion. 
Bearing this in mind, the Committees believe a 
more instructive decision than Curtiss-Wright is Dames 
& Moore v. Reagan."8 There, the Supreme Court 
upheld Executive Orders issued by President Carter 
to govern the treatment of claims against Iran after 
resolution of the hostage crisis 1979 and 1980. Chief 
Justice Rehnquist, then an associate justice, wrote for 
the Court and quoted portions of a concurring opin-
406 
ion filed by Justice Jackson in the Steel Seizure 
Case."9 According to Chief Justice Rehnquist: 
When the President acts pursuant to an express 
or implied authorization from Congress, he exer-
cises not only his powers but also those delegated 
by Congress. In such a case the executive action 
"would be supported by the strongest presump-
tions and widest latitude of judicial interpretation, 
and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily 
upon any who might attack it." When the Presi-
dent acts in the absence of congressional authori-
zation he may enter a "zone of twilight in which 
he and Congress may have concurrent authority, 
or in which its distribution is uncertain." In such 
a case, the analysis becomes more complicated, 
and the validity of the President's action, at least 
so far as separation-of-powers principles are con-
cerned, hinges on a consideration of all the cir-
cumstances which might shed light on the views 
of the Legislative Branch toward such action, 
including "congressional inertia, indifference or 
quiescence." Finally, when the President acts in 
contravention of the will of Congress, "his power is 
at its lowest ebb" and the Court can sustain his 
actions "only by disabling the Congress from 
action on the subject." 120 
As the Committees have already noted, the Admin-
istration's activities in support of the Contras were 
conducted in direct contravention of the will of Con-
gress. It follows, then, that the President's constitu-
tional authority to conduct those activities was "at its 
lowest ebb." 
It strains credulity to suggest that the President has 
the constitutional prerogative to staff and fund a mili-
tary operation without the knowledge of Congress 
and in direct disregard of contrary legislation. To 
endorse such a prerogative would, in the language of 
Dames & Moore, "[disable] the Congress from action 
on the subject" and leave the Administration entirely 
unaccountable for such clandestine initiatives. 
In Federalist 75, Alexander Hamilton cautioned 
against granting the President too much authority 
over foreign affairs: 
The history of human conduct does not warrant 
that exalted opinion of human virtue which 
would make it wise in a nation to commit inter-
ests so delicate and momentous a kind as those 
which concern its intercourse with the rest of the 
world to the sole disposal of a magistrate, created 
and circumstanced, as would be a president of 
the United States. 
While each branch of our Government undoubtedly 
has primacy in certain spheres, none can function in 
secret disregard of the others in any sphere. That, in 
essence, was the Administration's attempt here.

Chapter 26 
Congress must be able to depend upon the Presi-
dent for the execution of laws. It cannot be thrust into 
an adversarial role in which it must treat representa-
tions from the President's staff with skepticism and 
incredulity. If the President believes that a law has 
provisions that are unconstitutional, he must either 
veto it or put Congress on notice of his position?as 
he did with portions of Gramm-Rudman. The one 
option the executive branch does not have is to pre-
tend that it is executing the law when it is, in fact, 
evading it. 
The American system works well only when its 
branches of government trust one another. The Iran-
Contra Affair is a perfect example of how to destroy 
that trust.

President with respect to the integration of domestic, for-

security. . . ." Section 402(c) states: "the Council shall

them down?and you're just the man to do it?
d'you really think you could stand upright in the 
winds that would blow then? 
?A Man For All Seasons by Robert Bolt 
Too many laws were "cut down" in the Iran-
Contra Affair by officials who, like Roper, decided 
that the laws inhibited pursuit of their goals. 
This process began when members of the National 
Security Council staff decided "to take some risks" 
with the law, in John Poindexter's words, in order to 
continue support for the Contras. At the end, as 
Oliver North acknowledged, they were engaging in 
conduct such as lying to Congress that they knew 
was plainly "wrong." 
The Committees were charged by their Houses 
with reporting violations of law and "illegal" or 
"unethical" conduct,2 and if the Committees are to be 
true to their mandates, they cannot hesitate to draw 
the inevitable conclusions from the conduct these offi-
cials displayed during this affair. 
The judgments of these Committees are not the 
same as those required of the Independent Counsel. 
He must decide whether there was criminal intent 
behind any violation, whether there are any extenuat-
ing circumstances, and whether prosecution is in the 
public interest. The Committees express no opinions 
on these subjects and our comments in this section are 
purposefully general so as not to prejudice any indi-
vidual's rights. Our focus is not on whether the tech-
nical and demanding requirements of criminal statutes 
have been met, but on whether the policy underlying 
such statutes has been frustrated. Moreover, the list of 
statutes implicated by the Iran-Contra Affair is not 
exhaustive. 
Because of the importance of the Boland Amend-
ment to this investigation, this Report considers the 
applicability of that Amendment to the NSC in a 
separate chapter. The only issue under the Boland 
Amendment that is addressed in this chapter is the 
legality of the diversion. The Boland Amendment 
aside, however, the Committees find that activities in 
the Iran-Contra Affair, including the diversion, were 
conducted and later covered up by members of the 
NSC staff in violation of the Constitution and of ap-
plicable laws and regulations. 
Use of Donated Funds to Evade 
Congress' Power of the Purse 
Overview 
The Committees find that the scheme, taken as a 
whole, to raise money to conduct a secret Contra-
support operation through an "off-the-shelf" covert 
capacity (the Enterprise) operating as an appendage 
of the NSC staff violated cardinal principles of the 
Constitution. 
Several witnesses at the public hearings contended 
that the covert action to support the Contras did not 
violate the Boland Amendment because it was fi-
nanced by contributions, not appropriated funds. The 
Boland Amendment by its terms, they maintained, 
only prevented the President from spending appropri-
ated funds to support the Contras. But that ignores a 
greater principle. The Constitution contemplates that 
the Government will conduct its affairs only with 
funds appropriated by Congress. By resorting to funds 
not appropriated by Congress?indeed funds denied 
the executive branch by Congress?Administration of-
ficials committed a transgression far more basic than a 
violation of the Boland Amendment. 
The power of the purse, which the Framers vested 
in Congress, has long been recognized as "the most 
important single curb in the Constitution on Presiden-
tial Power." 3 The Framers were determined not to

combine the power of the purse and the power of the 
sword in the same branch of government. They were 
concerned that if the executive branch had both the 
power to raise and spend money, and control over the 
armed forces, it could unilaterally embroil the country 
in war without consent of Congress, notwithstanding 
Congress' exclusive power to declare war. 
When members of the executive branch raised 
money from third countries and private citizens, took 
control over that money through the Enterprise, and 
used it to support the Contras' war in Nicaragua, they 
bypassed this crucial safeguard in the Constitution. As 
Secretary of State George Shultz testified at the 
public hearings: "You cannot spend funds that the 
Congress doesn't either authorize you to obtain or 
appropriate. That is what the Constitution says, and 
we have to stick to it."4 
The Power of the Purse and the 
Constitution 
Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution, 
the appropriations clause, provides: 
No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but 
in consequence of appropriations made by law. 
The appropriations clause was intended to give Con-
gress exclusive control of funds spent by the Govern-
ment, and to give the democratically elected repre-
sentatives of the people an absolute check on Execu-
tive action requiring expenditure of funds. 
The Framers viewed Congress' exclusive power of 
the purse as intrinsic to the system of checks and 
balances that is the genius of the United States Consti-
tution. 
James Madison, the principal architect of the Con-
stitution, explained: 
The House of Representatives alone can propose 
the supplies requisite for the support of govern-
ment. They, in a word, hold the purse. . . . This 
power of the purse may, in fact, be regarded as 
the most complete and effectual weapon with 
which any constitution can arm the immediate 
representatives of the people for obtaining a re-
dress of every grievance, and for carrying into 
effect every just and salutary measure.5 
Col. George Mason, another Constitutional Conven-
tion delegate, stated, ". . . the purse and the sword 
ought never to get into the same hands, whether 
legislative or executive 
This concept has been a guiding constitutional prin-
ciple for 200 years. As President Reagan stated at an 
October 22, 1987, press conference: "The President of 
the United States cannot spend a nickel. Only Con-
gress can authorize the spending of money."7 
Congress' exclusive control over the expenditure of 
funds cannot legally be evaded through use of gifts or 
donations made to the executive branch. Were it oth-
412 
erwise, a President whose appropriation requests were 
rejected by Congress could raise money from private 
sources or third countries for armies, military actions, 
arms systems, and even domestic programs. 
The Government may, of course, receive gifts.9 
However, consistent with Congress' constitutionally 
exclusive power of the purse, gifts like all other "mis-
cellaneous receipts" must, by statute (31 U.S.C. Sec-
tion 484) be placed directly into the Treasury of the 
United States,9 and may be spent only pursuant to a 
Congressional appropriation.10 * 
The Constitutional process that lodges control of 
Government expenditures exclusively in Congress is 
further enforced by the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 
U.S.C. Section 1341) which prohibits an officer of the 
United States from authorizing an expenditure that 
has not been the subject of a Congressional appropria-
tion, or that exceeds the amount of any applicable 
appropriation. Thus it provides: 
An officer or employee of the United States 
Government may not make or authorize an ex-
penditure or obligation exceeding an amount 
available in an appropriation or fund for the ex-
penditure or obligation; or involve [the] govern-
ment in a contract or obligation for the payment 
of money before an appropriation is made unless 
authorized by law. 
Violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act are made 
crimes by 31 U.S.C. Section 1350. ** 
*The significance of this proposition is explained in a major 
General Accounting Office publication on Appropriations Law, 
which serves as a guide for Government officials: 
Once money is deposited into a "miscellaneous receipts" ac-
count, it takes an appropriation to get it back out. E.g. 3 
Comp. Gen. 296 (1923); 2 Comp. Gen. 599,600 (1923). Thus, 
the effect of 31 U.S.C. Section 484 is to ensure that the execu-
tive branch remains dependent on the Congressional appropria-
tions process. . . [it] emerges as another element in the statuto-
ry pattern by which Congress retains control of the public 
purse under the separation of powers doctrine. 
See 51 Comp. Gen. 506,507 (1972). (Principles of Federal Appro-
priations Law, United States General Accounting Office, Office of 
General Counsel, pp. 5-65). 
"Use by the Executive of gifts to pay for programs not funded 
by Congress is also prohibited by the doctrine against augmentation 
of appropriations, which the GAO also explained: 
The prohibition against augmentation is a corollary of the 
separation-of-powers doctrine. . . . To permit an agency to 
operate beyond [its appropriation] with funds derived from 
some other source without specific congressional sanction 
would amount to a usurpation of the congressional prerogative. 
Restated, the objective of the theory against augmentation of 
appropriated funds is to prevent a government agency from 
undercutting the congressional power of the purse by circu-
itously exceeding the amount Congress has appropriated for 
that activity . . . .

Chapter 27 
Use of the Enterprise to Mask the Fact 
that the U.S. Government Had Taken 
Control of the Donations 
The constitutional scheme, which these laws ampli-
fy, is thus a simple one. Congress is dependent upon 
the executive branch to execute the law it passes; and 
the executive branch is dependent upon Congress to 
appropriate the funds to carry on its activities. This 
mutual dependence is at the heart of the system of 
checks and balances. 
The Constitutional plan did not prohibit the Presi-
dent from urging other countries to give money di-
rectly to the Contras." But the Constitution does 
prohibit receipt and expenditure of such funds by this 
Government absent an appropriation. This prohibition 
may not lawfully be evaded by use of a nominally 
private entity, if the private entity is in reality an arm 
of the Government and the Government is able to 
direct how the money is spent. 
The law with respect to when a nominally private 
company is an arm of the Government such that 
expenditure of its funds is governed by rules applica-
ble to expenditure of Government funds is summa-
rized in Motor Coach Industries, Inc. v. Dole, 725 F.2d 
958, 964-65 (4th Cir. 1984). There, the Court articulat-
ed a multifactor approach for resolving when an os-
tensibly private entity like a trust is a Federal entity: 
We must consider, at a minimum, the purposes 
for which the trust was established; the public or 
private character of the entity spearheading the 
trust's creation; the identity of the trust's benefici-
ary and administrators; the degree of control ex-
ercised by the public agency over disbursements 
and other details of administration; and the 
method by which the trust is funded." 
Lake Resources, the flagship of the Enterprise, was 
created by Richard Secord and Albert Hakim at 
North's request in July 1985. North did not like the 
way Contra leader Adolpho Calero was spending the 
donations received earlier, and he wanted more con-
trol over expenditures. By North's own admission, 
Lake Resources was to be an "off-the-shelf" company 
to conduct a "full service covert action" in support of 
the Contras and other governmental projects. North 
referred to it in his PROF messages to Poindexter as 
"our Lake Resources company." 
North was responsible, directly or indirectly, for 
virtually all the income of Lake Resources and the 
other companies in the Enterprise, and he had the 
power to direct its expenditures. North instructed 
Secord to spend money for airplanes, an airstrip, and 
munitions for the Contras and Secord did. He in-
structed Secord to spend money on radios for a politi-
cal party in a foreign country and Secord did. He 
instructed Secord to spend its money for a ship to 
conduct an intelligence operation and Secord did. He 
instructed Secord to spend cash in support of a Drug 
Enforcement Agency operation to free U.S. hostages 
and Secord did. 
North had secure communication devices in his 
office and those of all principal operatives in the 
covert action. Using these devices, North was able to 
maintain control of the most minute details of the 
operation. On one occasion, he even instructed pilots 
on the coordinates to be used in a weapons drop to 
the Contras inside Nicaragua. 
Lake Resources was created for the very purpose 
of conducting Government operations while evading 
the Congressional appropriations power. In describing 
Director of Central Intelligence William Casey's plan 
for an off-the-shelf covert capacity, North testified: 
Q: Do you remember giving testimony about the 
fact that Director Casey wanted something that 
he could pull off the shelf and that is why he was 
excited about the fact that you were now able to 
generate some surpluses That could be used? 
A: That is correct. 
Q: Why don't you give us a description of what 
he said, or as you understood it, what he meant 
by pulling something off the shelf? 
A: Director Casey had in mind, as I understood 
it, an overseas entity that was capable of con-
ducting operations or activities of assistance to 
U.S. foreign policy goals that was a stand-alone. 
Q: Self-financed? 
A: That was self-financing, independent of appro-
priated monies and capable of conducting activi-
ties similar to the ones that we had conducted 
here.' 3 (Emphasis added.) 
The concept of an off-the-shelf covert company to 
conduct operations with funds not appropriated by 
Congress is contradictory to the Constitution. The 
decision to use the Enterprise to fight a war with 
unappropriated funds was a decision to combine the 
power of the purse and the power of the sword in 
one branch of government. 
Referring to the concept of having independently 
financed entities conduct covert actions to avoid Con-
gressional review, Secretary Shultz said: "This is not 
sharing power, this is not in line with what was 
agreed to in Philadelphia. This is a piece of junk and 
it ought to be treated that way."14 
As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger re-
cently wrote with particular reference to the use of 
the proceeds of the Iranian arms sales: 
On the formal level the case is obvious. The 
Executive branch cannot be allowed?on any 
claim of national security?to circumvent the 
Congressional prerogative over appropriations by

raising its own funds through the sale of govern-
ment property.' 5 
Legal Advice 
The President may have received support for use of 
third country funds from a decision at the June 1985 
National Security Policy Group meeting, which he 
attended, to seek the advice of Attorney General Wil-
liam French Smith before any funds were obtained 
from third countries. 
At that meeting, Secretary Shultz warned that so-
licitation of third-country funds that the Government 
could control might be an "impeachable offense," at-
tributing this opinion to Chief of Staff James Baker. 
Casey disagreed and offered to obtain an opinion 
from Attorney General Smith.' 6 
When Casey approached the Attorney General the 
following day, however, he drew the question nar-
rowly, asking only whether Nicaragua's neighbors 
could be urged to help the Contras. The Committees 
have received evidence that Attorney General Smith 
gave an oral opinion that this would not be unlawful. 
As noted above, the Constitution does not prohibit a 
President from urging foreign countries and private 
citizens to give money to causes which the President 
supports, so long as this Government does not take 
control of the money. 
But no representatives of the Justice Department 
were ever asked to express an opinion that it was 
constitutional for members of the executive branch to 
do what they did here?raise money from third coun-
tries and private parties, put the money in an entity 
controlled by the Executive, and direct its expendi-
ture for projects of the executive branch. Nor did any 
legal officer of the Government ever suggest that it 
was lawful or constitutional to divert proceeds from 
the sale of U.S. property for purposes forbidden by 
the Congress. 
The oral, on-the-spot advice of Attorney General 
Smith to Casey that Central American countries 
could be approached may in the transmission have 
been given a broader interpretation. The Committees 
simply do not know. But the Iran-Contra Affair 
cannot stand as a precedent for bypassing the consti-
tutional requirement for appropriations. Securing 
funds, without Congressional authorization, to fund 
Government programs run by Government officials, 
is a direct violation of the Constitution that cannot be 
condoned. 
Section 501 of the National 
Security Act and Related 
Regulation 
The Committees find that the failure to notify the 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of 
the covert action to support the Contras violated the 
414 
Congressional notice provisions of Section 501 of the 
National Security Act; and that the delay in notifying 
Congress of the Iran arms sales abused whatever flexi-
bility Congress built into the statute. 
Section 501 of the National Security Act requires 
that Congress be notified of all covert actions con-
ducted by any agency of Government. The statute 
provides: 
The Director of Central Intelligence and the 
heads of all departments, agencies and other entities 
of the United States involved in intelligence activities 
shall: 
(1) keep the Select Committee on Intelligence of 
the Senate and Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence of the House of Representatives 
(hereinafter in this section referred to as the "In-
telligence Committee") fully and currently in-
formed of all intelligence activities which are the 
responsibility of are engaged in by or are carried 
out for or on behalf of any department, agency, or 
entity of the United States, including any signifi-
cant anticipated intelligence activity. (Emphasis 
added.) 
There are only two exceptions or qualifications to 
the requirement of prior notice. First, the relevant 
head of a department, in lieu of notifying both Intelli-
gence Committees, may notify the two ranking Mem-
bers of each Intelligence Committee, and the two 
ranking Members of each House of Congress. This 
requires a personal decision by the President of the 
United States. 
Second, the Act recognizes that there are circum-
stances under which the President may not have pro-
vided any prior notice to Congress. In such a case, he 
must "fully inform the Intelligence Committees in a 
timely fashion" with a "statement of the reasons for 
not giving prior notice." This also requires a personal 
decision by the President.17 
The notification provision of Section 501 serves 
vital purposes for both Congress and the executive 
branch. First, the required notification allows for ben-
eficial congressional input in decisions that may affect 
important national interests. As former Director of 
Central Intellience William E. Colby said during con-
sideration of the Act, discussion with Congressional 
officials of planned covert actions "enables the Execu-
tive to get a sense of Congressional reaction and 
avoid the rather clamorous repudiation which has oc-
curred in certain cases. . . . I think that is a helpful 
device."' 8 
Second, notification enables Congress to fulfill its 
constitutionally mandated role of monitoring Execu-
tive actions in the area of national defense and foreign 
policy lest covert actions entangle the country in 
overt hostilities. As a mechanism for consultation be-
tween the executive and legislative branches, notifica-

Chapter 27 
tion helps to address the anomaly of formulating plans 
for secret action within a democracy. 
The language of Section 501, as well as its legisla-
tive history, was the product of a delicate compro-
mise between Congress and the executive branch. The 
purpose of the compromise was to avoid a confronta-
tion with President Carter, who maintained there 
might be situations in which he should not be re-
quired to give prior notice, and that a statute requir-
ing such disclosure in every case would interfere with 
his constitutional responsibilities. After lengthy con-
sultation with the Administration, the statute was 
crafted so as to permit the Congress and the President 
to continue to disagree. This was done by the inclu-
sion of a preamble that states that the notice require-
ments apply "to the extent consistent with all applica-
ble authorities and duties, including those conferred 
upon the executive and legislative branches of the 
Government," and by recognizing that there might be 
circumstances where prior notice is not given. 
Deferral of notice was intended to be the exception, 
not the rule. For example, Senator Dee Huddleston, 
the lead sponsor of the bill, stated: 
I myself believe that the only constitutional basis 
for the President to withhold prior notice of a 
significant intelligence activity would be exigent 
circumstances when time does not permit prior 
notice; in such a case the committee could be 
notified as soon as possible." 
Similarly, Senator Daniel Inouye said during consid-
eration of the Conference Report on the Intelligence 
Oversight Act: 
I am of the firm belief that the only time the 
President has the constitutional authority to with-
hold prior notice to the intelligence committees 
would be in matters of extreme exigency. In my 
experience as chairman of the Intelligence Com-
mittee and as a continuing member of that com-
mittee, and after 4 years of reviewing the covert 
operations of our intelligence system, I cannot 
conceive of any circumstance which would re-
quire the withholding of prior notice except 
where the nation is under attack and the Presi-
dent has no time to consult with Congress before 
responding to save the country.2? 
The Administration's conduct in the Iran-Contra 
Affair was inconsistent with these standards. 
The Contra Covert Operation 
Under Section 501, the President alone can make a 
determination to delay notice of a covert operation. 
The President did not make a personal determination 
that notice of the NSC staffs Contra support activity 
should either be delayed or limited. Indeed, he has 
publicly disclaimed knowledge of the covert action. 
Thus, prior notice to Congress of the covert action by 
the NSC staff was required. 
No notice of any kind was ever sent to Congress 
concerning the Contra covert action conducted by 
the NSC staff. On the contrary, the NSC staff took 
every step to keep Congress from discovering its ac-
tivities. The covert action was carried out in violation 
of the Congressional notice provisions of the National 
Security Act. 
The Iranian Arms Sales 
The President did know of the Iran arms sales, and 
he made a deliberate decision not to notify Congress. 
Thus, Congress did not learn of direct arms sales to 
Iran, approved by the Finding of January 17, 1986, 
until the press reported it in November 1986. Con-
gress did not learn of the December 5, 1985, Finding 
approving U.S. participation in the Israeli shipments 
until Poindexter's testimony was compelled under a 
grant of immunity. As a consequence of the Presi-
dent's decisions not to notify Congress, the operation 
continued for over a year through failure after failure, 
and when Congress fmally did learn, it was not 
through notification by the Administration, but from a 
story published in a Beirut weekly. 
The flexibility afforded the President for providing 
notice to Congress was abused by this delay. The 
reason cited for not notifying Congress was not that 
there was insufficient time to notify Congress?the 
only reason recognized in the legislative history justi-
fying absence of prior notice?but that leaks might 
result and could endanger the hostages. There was no 
evidence to support such a rationale. The hostages 
had value to their holders only while they were 
alive.21 The Intelligence Committees frequently are 
entrusted with information about covert operations in 
which disclosure would put American lives at risk. 
Moreover, the information the Administration with-
held from Congress was given at various times to an 
Iranian intermediary who failed several CIA lie detec-
tor tests, officials of the Government of Iran, officials 
of the Government of Israel, officials of the Govern-
ment of a European country, private Israeli business-
men, and private U.S. citizens who did not have secu-
rity clearances, such as Hakim. 
It is a fair conclusion, therefore, that the Adminis-
tration chose not to notify Congress of the arms-for-
hostages initiative precisely because it anticipated 
Congress' objections and knew that the Secretaries of 
State and Defense would not defend the initiative. 
Indeed, the Iran initiative was contrary to longstand-
ing national policies and to common sense, and the 
Administration might have abandoned the plan rather 
than disclose it to Congress. 
All covert actions can be supported by strong argu-
ments for secrecy. If the Administration can use these 
arguments as reasons to withhold notice where its 
plans are most suspect, Section 501 of the National

Chapter 27 
Security Act is all but nullified. It is precisely when a 
covert action is suspect and potentially embarrassing 
that Congressional notice is most important. It is also 
then that the Administration is most in need of inde-
pendent evaluations and criticism of proposed poli-
cies. And it is then when Congress, the representative 
of the people, must be given at least the opportunity 
to be heard in secret before action that could be 
calamitous for the Nation is carried out. 
The DEA Hostage Rescue Operation 
In 1985 and 1986, the NSC used DEA agents to 
conduct a covert operation designed to free the hos-
tages. The details of this operation are described in 
Chapter 23 of this Report. Congress must be notified 
of such operations under Section 501 of the National 
Security Act. 
No notice of any kind was provided to Congress 
about this operation, and no decision was ever made 
by the President that prior notice should be withheld 
or delayed. Thus, failure to notify Congress of the 
DEA covert operation violated the law. 
Executive Order 12333, and NSDD 
159 
The procedures applicable to covert actions are gov-
erned not only by statutes, but by executive orders 
and National Security Decision Directives (NSDDs). 
These are written regulations signed by the President 
of the United States, and are binding on the entire 
executive branch until they are rescinded or changed 
by the President. They, too, were violated. 
Executive Order 12333 issued by the President pro-
vides that "no agency except the CIA . . . may 
conduct any special activity (elsewhere defined to 
include covert actions overseas) unless the President 
determines that another agency is more likely to 
achieve a particular objective." 
There was no Presidential determination that the 
NSC staff should conduct the Contra covert oper-
ation, and thus the NSC staff's covert action in sup-
port of the Contras violated the President's executive 
order. 
Similarly, National Security Decision Directive 
159, promulgated by the President, provides that no 
covert action overseas may be conducted by any 
agency of Government unless it is authorized by a 
written Finding signed by the President. 
There was no written Finding signed by the Presi-
dent approving the covert action by the NSC staff in 
support of the Contras. Thus the NSC staff's activity 
violated this directive. 
416 
Violations of 18 U.S.C. Section 
1001 
We have described elsewhere (Part IV) the elaborate 
efforts by Government officials to conceal their 
Contra-support activities from Congress. 
It is enough to say here that, among other things, 
Congress was told by an Administration official orally 
and in writing in 1985 that the NSC staff was not 
engaged in fundraising or arranging military support 
for the Contras. Congress was personally told by 
North in 1986 that he was not engaged in fundraising 
or giving military advice to the Contras. Congress 
was told in testimony by Administration officials in 
October 1986 that the Government had no connection 
to the plane carrying Eugene Hasenfus. And Congress 
was told in testimony by Administration officials in 
October, November, and December 1986 that the Ad-
ministration was not involved in raising funds for the 
Contras from foreign countries, including specifically 
funds from Country 2. 
These statements were all untrue. They were made 
by officials who had varying degrees of knowledge 
about the facts they discussed. Some of the statements 
may have been unintentionally misleading and made 
by officials who were themselves deceived; others 
were outright falsehoods. 
Most of these statements were not under oath. But 
for the branches to operate in a cooperative relation-
ship, Congress must be able to rely on statements 
even if unsworn. Congress and the executive branch 
are partners, not adversaries. 
The law recognizes this, and the false statement 
statute, 18 U.S.C. 1001, provides felony criminal pen-
alties for knowingly false, fictitious, and fraudulent 
statements to Congress,22 even if not made under 
oath.2 3 
Some officials claimed they were forced to choose 
between making false statements and revealing infor-
mation they believed should remain secret. Govern-
ment officials may claim any valid privilege including 
executive privilege, as a basis for refusing to answer 
questions or provide documents, and thus set in 
motion procedures for lawfully resolving the claim. 
But under the U.S. legal system, public officials do 
not have the option of making false statements to 
Congress. 24 
The Diversion Boland 
Amendment 
The Committees find that the diversion of arms sales 
proceeds to the Contras' war effort was an evasion of 
the Boland Amendment no matter how narrowly that 
noncriminal statute is construed. 
The Boland Amendment provides that "no funds 
available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the De-

Chapter 27 
partment of Defense, or any other agency or entity 
involved in intelligence activities" may be spent for 
military support of the Contras. (Emphasis added.) 
The missiles that were sold to Iran in 1986 came 
from Department of Defense stocks. The missiles had 
been purchased with money appropriated for the De-
partment of Defense by Congress, and the missiles 
belonged to the Department of Defense. The Depart-
ment of Defense sold the missiles to the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, and the Central Intelligence Agency 
sold the missiles to Iran. 
The memorandum to the President dated January 
17, 1986, outlining the arms sales the President ap-
proved that day spells this out very clearly. It states 
that the CIA would purchase the missiles from DOD 
and would sell the missiles "directly" to Iran, using 
an "agent"?i.e., the various Enterprise companies?
to handle the actual transactions. 
Iran paid $28.5 million for those weapons. In the 
ordinary course, the purchase price is paid to the 
seller, i.e., the CIA. In this case, however, National 
Security Adviser Poindexter decided, on North's rec-
ommendation, that only a portion of the money 
should go to the CIA, with the rest remaining in the 
custody of Secord's companies before being used to 
support the Contras. Thus, Poindexter testified: 
Q: Who decided how that money would be used? 
A: The?my guidance to Colonel North what he 
requested and I approved, was that those funds 
should be used for support of the contras in Cen-
tral America so they could keep pressure on the 
Sandinistas. 
Q: So the decision?and I think you said earlier 
in your testimony, "the buck stops here"?the 
decision as to how that money was to be used 
was made by you? 
A: Was my decision; that is correct.25 
Poindexter could also have decided that all of the 
purchase price be remitted to the CIA. North testified 
as follows: 
Q: The question was, if those higher-ups in the 
U.S. Government from whom you sought ap-
proval decided that the $10 million [residue] 
should not, any part of it, be sent to the contras 
but should all come back to the U.S. Treasury, 
that is what would have happened isn't it? 
A: Yes." 
Given the Enterprise's status as an agent, and the 
NSC staffs control over the pricing and the proceeds 
of the arms sales, the full purchase price was available 
to the CIA. These funds, generated from the sale of 
U.S. weapons, could no more be diverted to the Con-
tras than the weapons themselves. 
Proceeds of Arms Sales Funds of 
the United States 
The Committees find that the full proceeds of the 
arms sales to Iran belong to the U.S. Government. 
Consequently, these funds are governed by statutes 
applicable to Government funds, including statutes 
prohibiting conversion of U.S. Government funds to 
unauthorized purposes. 
As already noted in the previous section, Secord's 
Enterprise received the purchase price for the missiles 
in its capacity as agent for the United States. This 
conclusion is strongly supported by the documentary 
and testimonial evidence. The President approved the 
arms sales based on the January 17, 1986, memoran-
dum, which states that the purchase price "would be 
transferred to an agent of the CIA," and that the CIA 
would "deliver the weapons to Iran through the 
agent." That memorandum is consistent on this point 
with other documents in the Committees' possession.* 
Moreover, as noted above, the Enterprise conducted 
itself in a manner consistent with its status as an agent 
of the United States, spending money for Government 
purposes?for the Contras, for a foreign country, for 
a ship, and for a DEA operation?all at the direction 
of Government officials.27 The Enterprise's profits 
from the Iran arms sales were not the result of entre-
peneurial risks or skills. The Government determined 
the price which the Enterprise paid for the missiles 
and approved and negotiated the price at which the 
missiles were sold to Iran. 
Government funds include not only funds in the 
physical possession of the Government, but funds 
that, although in the possession of another, are under 
the Government's control." When an agent of the 
Government collects money owed to the Government 
by a customer of the Government, the money belongs 
to the Government and cannot be converted to some 
other use. Arbuckle v. United States, 146 F.2d 657 
(D.C. Cir. 1944). 
The chief legal officer of the United States appears 
to be in agreement with the Committees on this point. 
The Attorney General of the United States took the 
position in an official request for assistance to the 
Central Authority of Switzerland, dated December 
12, 1986, that the full proceeds of the arms sales were 
funds of the United States; and gave similar testimony 
to these Committees. Thus, referring to these funds he 
? Other memorandums confirm the Enterprise's role as agent in 
the Iran arms sales. The proposal to sell missiles directly to Iran 
first appeared in a December 9, 1985, memorandum from North to 
Poindexter, suggesting "using Secord as our conduit." A memoran-
dum by CIA General Counsel Stanley Sporkin dated January 15, 
1986, makes three separate references to an "agent" who would 
supply the weapons to Iran and "act as a middleman with our 
authority." And the January 17, 1986, Memorandum to the Presi-
dent makes the final proposal to have the CIA transfer the weapons 
"directly" to Iran "using an authorized agent as necessary."

said: "I would say that as a general matter, it is highly 
probable that those funds should be on a constructive 
trust theory or agency theory the property of the 
United States." 29 
Government funds coming into the hands of an 
officer or agent of the United States must be paid 
immediately into the Treasury (31 U.S.C. Sections 
484, 3302) and may not be applied to some other use 
(18 U.S.C. Section 641). Consequently, it is the Com-
mittees' judgment that all funds derived from the pro-
ceeds of the sale of arms to Iran currently in the 
custody of the Enterprise or its representatives belong 
to the United States and by law should be returned to 
the United States Treasury forthwith. 
Iran Arms Sales: Arms Export 
Control Act 
The Committees find that the Administration's ap-
proval of the transfer of weapons to Iran by Israel 
violated the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).3? 
All the HAWKS and TOWs that Israel transferred 
to Iran in 1985 had earlier been obtained from the 
United States under the AECA. Agreements between 
this country and Israel prohibited Israel from transfer-
ring the arms to any third country without first ob-
taining written consent of the United States.31 
Under the AECA, the President may not provide 
that consent unless: (1) the United States itself would 
transfer those arms to that country; (2) the transferee 
country (here Iran) agrees in writing that it will not 
further transfer the items without obtaining the con-
sent of the President; and (3) the President notifies 
Congress of the transfer (22 U.S.C. Section 
2753(a)).32 
The President's authorization of the 1985 Israeli 
transfers to Iran were made without even a pretense 
of compliance with the AECA or Israel's written 
agreements with the United States. No written con-
sent was sought or given; and even if Israel had 
sought a written consent, this Government could not 
have given it without changing its own regulations. 
This is so because Iran, which was considered a ter-
rorist nation by the United States and which was the 
subject of a U.S. arms embargo, was not eligible for 
direct sales.33 No written Iranian retransfer assur-
ances were obtained nor could they have been. Final-
ly, no notice was given to Congress. 
In 1985, the Secretary of Defense stated vigorously 
to the President that he believed the sales were ille-
gal. He restated his belief before these Committees in 
1987: 
A: But my feeling about that was, as I've men-
tioned to you earlier, that the Export Control 
Act doesn't permit a blanket approval in advance 
or anything of that kind and does not permit 
exports, did not permit exports to Iran, neither 
that Act nor some others, and did not permit the 
418 
Israelis to export anything we hadn't specifically 
authorized. 
Q: So if Israel had earlier purchased arms from 
the United States under the Arms Export Control 
Act and not pursuant to an intelligence activity, 
your position was that the law forbade them to 
transfer them to any third country without going 
through varius kinds of waivers and reporting 
requirements? 
A: Yes. Right.34 
Later he testified: 
Q: So it would have been?you're saying it 
would have been a violation of law for Israel to 
have?? 
A: I don't know of anything that would have 
taken it out of the normal course. I haven't re-
searched the problem and had a legal opinion on 
it. My view is that our Arms Export Control Act 
would make that kind of transaction illegal, yes. 
That is just my own conclusion." 
The Administration takes the position that the CIA 
may transfer weapons as part of an intelligence oper-
ation, outside the context of the AECA, by using the 
President's powers under the National Security Act. 
That is the approach the President used in 1986 re-
garding his January 17, 1986, Finding. However, no 
such Finding existed for the sale of 504 TOWs; only a 
retroactive Finding existed for the November 1985 
HAWKs sale; and the weapons transferred by Israel 
to Iran were governed by the AECA having been 
earlier transferred to Israel pursuant to that Act." 
The Department of Justice, in a legal opinion on 
December 17, 1986, concluded that the 1985 Israeli 
shipments did not violate the AECA.37 In reaching 
this conclusion, the opinion assumed that Israel was 
acting solely as a "conduit" in a direct sale by the 
United States to Iran; that the United States promptly 
replenished all Israeli weapons with identical weap-
ons; that the Israelis had no financial interest in the 
transaction; and that the United States asked Israel to 
engage in these transfers as an accommodation to the 
United States." The opinion also recognized that its 
conclusion depended on the correctness of these as-
sumptions. 
The assumptions are, in fact, incorrect. It was the 
Israelis who first suggested and engaged in the arms 
sales. Israel was more than a conduit. The initiative 
was considered a joint venture by the United States 
and Israel; Israel ended with newer TOWs than it 
started with; and the prolonged negotiations over re-
plenishment reveal the financial interest Israel had in 
the transaction. Since its assumptions were incorrect, 
the legal conclusion of the Department of Justice 
opinion must be discounted. Moreover, even if the

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 27 
assumptions were correct, it is not clear that the De-
partment of Justice legal opinion is correct. 
Violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1505 
and the Presidential Records Act 
The destruction or alteration of documents39 or the 
giving of false testimony4? to frustrate a Congression-
al inquiry is a felony if done with "corrupt" intent?
i.e., the purpose of impeding an inquiry (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1505).41 
Even if a subpoena has not been issued, an individ-
ual on notice of a planned Congressional inquiry 
cannot lawfully alter or destroy documents for the 
purpose of preventing Congress from developing the 
facts if he knows such documents may be subpoenaed 
or requested. E.g., see United States v. Vesich, 724 
F.2d 471 (5th Cir. 1984); United States v. Tallant, 407 
F.Supp. 878, 888 (N.D. Ga. 1975). 
Starting at least as early as November 10, 1986, the 
Administration was put on notice that various Con-
gressional committees planned inquiries into the sale 
of arms to Iran. Both the House and Senate Intelli-
gence Committees told the White House of the inquir-
ies and arranged for Poindexter and Casey to appear 
before them on Friday, November 21, 1986. Thereaf-
ter, several Administration officials took actions 
which had the effect of concealing this Government's 
participation in the Israeli shipments that violated the 
Arms Export Control Act. 
On November 18, 1986, 3 days before the sched-
uled appearance of Casey and Poindexter, Presidential 
aides began to focus on the legal problems attending 
U.S. involvement in the Israeli shipments made prior 
to the January 17, 1986, Finding. Then during the 
next 3 days, several Administration officials involved 
in the pre-Finding shipments told conforming stories 
denying U.S. involvement in these shipments, at times 
using a false cover story that the United States had 
been told that the Israelis were shipping oil-drilling 
equipment, not arms. These officials wrote this false 
cover story into NSC chronologies; they told the 
false cover story in one version or another to Con-
gress and to the Attorney General; and they de-
stroyed documents that would have revealed the 
truth. 
The full facts concerning this effort, in the face of 
imminent Congressional probes, to alter the historical 
record, are described in Part IV. Whether or not any 
of the individuals had the requisite criminal intent to 
violate 18 U.S.C. Section 1505, their conduct violated 
the very thrust of that law?to ensure that Congress' 
access to the truth would not be obstructed. 
Iran: The Presidential Records Act 
Government employees do not have the discretion to 
destroy or alter embarrassing or incriminating docu-
ments. The Presidential Records Act was enacted 
after Watergate for the very purpose of ensuring that 
official records would be preserved. The Act has no 
criminal penalties but it was willfully violated by 
Poindexter in destroying the December 1985 Finding. 
Conclusion 
Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution directs that 
the President "shall take care that the laws be faithful-
ly executed." 42 The "take care" clause was derived 
from the English Bill of Rights, which forbade the 
King from suspending laws that he did not like. As 
Justice Jackson stated, the "take care" clause signifies 
"that ours is a government of laws, not of men." 43 
The "take care" clause embodies the principle of 
accountability. As Gouverneur Morris, one of the 
Constitutional Convention delegates, stated, the Fram-
ers were quite cognizant that "without . . . ministers 
the Executive can do nothing of consequence."44 At 
the same time, however, they understood that a gov-
ernment of the people could not function unless the 
elected chief executive was responsible for the actions 
of his appointed subordinates. In 1789, Madison wrote 
that "[N]o principle is more clearly laid down in the 
Constitution, than that of responsibility."45 The "take 
care" clause so unpretentious in its wording, made 
accountability compatible with delegation. Although 
they recognized that executive power must be exer-
cised by subordinate departments, the Framers never-
theless required the President to superintend the ac-
tions of those departments, thus correcting the tend-
ency of "plurality in the executive . . . to conceal 
faults and destroy responsibility." 46 
The President's responsibility to supervise his ap-
pointees was vigorously debated in the first session of 
Congress when the President's power to remove Cab-
inet officers was questioned. Many of the members 
had been delegates to the Constitutional convention 
or the ratifying conventions, and they had firsthand 
knowledge of the Framers' intent. One Member of 
Congress, Fisher Ames, stated, "The executive 
powers are delegated to the President with a view to 
have a responsible officer to superintend, control, in-
spect, and check the officers necessarily employed in 
administering the laws."47 "If anything in its nature" 
is executive, James Madison explained, "it must be 
that power which is employed in superintending and 
seeing that the laws are faithfully executed." Repre-
sentative Lee answered his own rhetorical question, 
"Is not the President responsible for the Administra-
tion? He certainly is."49 
In modern government, with its hundreds of thou-
sands of employees, a President obviously cannot per-
sonally supervise the acts of all who act in his name. 
But if the "take care" clause has any vitality, it in-
vests in a President the responsibility for cultivating a 
respect for the Constitution and the law by his staff

and closest associates. When the President's National 
Security Adviser, who had daily contact with the 
President, can assume that he is carrying out the 
President's wishes and policy in authorizing the diver-
sion; when- NSC staff members believe that the de-
struction of official documents is appropriate and the 
420 
deception of Congress is proper; and when laws like 
the Boland Amendment can be treated as if they do 
not exist, then clearly there has been a failure in the 
leadership and supervision that the "take care" clause 
contemplated.

an "impeachable offense," attributing this opinion to Chief 
of Staff James Baker. Casey said that they could ask the

the opinion of Attorney General Smith, who gave oral 
advice that it was lawful for the President to urge Nicara-

This testimony was largely contradicted by Hakim, the doc-
umentary record, the conduct of the parties, and common-
sense. The Committees do not find Secord's testimony to be 
credible.

Chapter 28 
Recommendations 
It is the conclusion of these Committees that the Iran-
Contra Affair resulted from the failure of individuals 
to observe the law, not from deficiencies in existing 
law or in our system of governance. This is an impor-
tant lesson to be learned from these investigations 
because it points to the fundamental soundness of our 
constitutional processes. 
Thus, the principal recommendations emerging 
from the investigation are not for new laws but for a 
renewal of the commitment to constitutional govern-
ment and sound processes of decisionmaking. 
The President must "take care" that the laws be 
faithfully executed. This is both a moral and legal 
responsibility. 
Government officials must observe the law, even 
when they disagree with it. 
Decisionmaking processes in foreign policy matters, 
including covert action, must provide for careful con-
sideration of all options and their consequences. Op-
posing views must be weighed, not ignored. Unsound 
processes, in which participants cannot even agree on 
what was decided (as in the case of the initial Iranian 
arms sale) produce unsound decisions. 
Congress' role in foreign policy must be recog-
nized, not dismissed, if the benefit of its counsel is to 
be realized and if public support is to be secured and 
maintained. 
The Administration must not lie to Congress about 
what it is doing. Congress is the partner, not the 
adversary of the executive branch, in the formulation 
of policy. 
Excessive secrecy in the making of important 
policy decisions is profoundly antidemocratic and 
rarely promotes sound policy decisions. 
These recommendations are not remarkable. They 
embody the principles on which this country's success 
has been based for 200 years. What is remarkable is 
that they were violated so freely and so repeatedly in 
the Iran-Contra Affair. 
Congress cannot legislate good judgment, honesty, 
or fidelity to law. But there are some changes in law, 
particularly relating to oversight of covert operations, 
that would make our processes function better in the 
future. They are set forth below: 
1. Findings: Timely Notice 
The Committees recommend that Section 501 of 
the National Security Act be amended to require that 
Congress be notified prior to the commencement of a 
covert action except in certain rare instances and in 
no event later than 48 hours after a Finding is ap-
proved. This recommendation is designed to assure 
timely notification to Congress of covert operations. 
Congress was never notified of the Iranian arms 
sales, in spite of the existence of a statute requiring 
prior notice to Congress of all covert actions, or, in 
rare situations, notice "in a timely fashion." The Ad-
ministration has reasoned that the risks of leaks justi-
fied delaying notice to Congress until after the covert 
action was over, and claims that notice after the 
action is over constitutes notice "in a timely fashion." 
This reasoning defeats the purpose of the law. 
2. Written Findings 
The Committees recommend legislation requiring 
that all covert action Findings be in writing and per-
sonally signed by the President. Similarly, the Com-
mittees recommend legislation that requires that the 
Finding be signed prior to the commencement of the 
covert action, unless the press of time prevents it, in 
which case it must be signed within 48 hours of 
approval by the President. 
The legislation should prohibit retroactive Findings. 
The legal concept of ratification, which commonly 
arises in commercial law, is inconsistent with the ra-
tionale of Findings, which is to require Presidential 
approval before any covert action is initiated. 
The existing law does not require explicitly that a 
Presidential Finding approving a covert operation be 
in writing, although executive orders signed by both 
Presidents Carter and Reagan required that they be in 
writing. Despite this requirement, a PROF note by 
McFarlane suggested that the initial arms sales to Iran 
were approved by a "mental finding," and there is 
conflicting testimony about whether certain actions 
were orally approved by the President. The require-
ment of a written Finding will remove such uncer-
tainties in the future.

Chapter 28 
3. Disclosure of Written Findings to Congress 
The Committees recommend legislation requiring 
that copies of all signed written Findings be sent to 
the Congressional Intelligence Committees. 
Since existing law does not require that covert 
action Findings be in writing, there currently is no 
requirement that written Findings be disclosed to 
Congress. The existing practice has been not to pro-
vide the Intelligence Committees with a signed writ-
ten Finding. 
4. Findings: Agencies Covered 
The Committees recommend that a Finding by the 
President should be required before a covert action is 
commenced by any department, agency, or entity of 
the United States Government regardless of what 
source of funds is used. 
The existing statutes require a Presidential Finding 
before a covert action is conducted only if the covert 
action uses appropriated funds and is conducted by 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). By executive 
order and National Security Decision Directive 
(NSDD), Presidential Findings are required before 
covert actions may be conducted by any agency. 
Nonetheless, both the National Security Council 
(NSC) and the Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA) became engaged in covert actions without 
Presidential Findings fully authorizing their involve-
ment. 
The executive order requirement is sound. In the 
Committees' judgment, Presidential Findings for 
covert actions conducted by any agency should be 
required by law. Experience suggests that Presidential 
accountability, as mandated by the Finding require-
ment, is equally as important in the case of covert 
actions conducted by agencies other than the CIA. 
The Committees also believe the Finding require-
ment should apply regardless of the source of funding 
for the covert action. 
5. Findings: identifying Participants 
The Committees recommend legislation requiring 
that each Finding should specify each and every de-
partment, agency, or entity of the United States Gov-
ernment authorized to fund or otherwise participate in 
any way in any covert action and whether any third 
party, including any foreign country, will be used in 
carrying out or providing funds for the covert action. 
The Congress should be informed of the identities of 
such third parties in an appropriate fashion. 
Current law does not require a Finding to state 
what agencies, third parties, or countries will be uti-
lized in conducting a covert action. The Iran-Contra 
investigation demonstrates that disclosure of what 
U.S. agencies (such as the NSC), private parties, or 
foreign countries will be engaged in covert actions 
424 
are matters of considerable importance if Congress is 
to fulfill its oversight responsibilities adequately. 
The record of the Iran-Contra investigation reflects 
repeated efforts by the executive branch to obtain 
funds from third countries for covert operations and 
for other causes the Administration supports. 
These actions raise concerns of two kinds. First, 
there is a risk that foreign countries will expect some-
thing in return. Second, in an extreme case such as 
that presented by the record of these hearings, the use 
of third country or private funds threatens to circum-
vent Congress' exclusive power of the purse. 
6. Findings: The Attorney General 
The Committees recommend that the Attorney 
General be provided with a copy of all proposed 
Findings for purposes of legal review. 
The first Iranian arms Finding of December 5, 
1985, was not reviewed by the Attorney General. The 
Attorney General did give oral advice on the January 
17 Finding but did not do the analysis or research 
that a written opinion would have entailed. The Presi-
dent, the intelligence community, and Congress are 
entitled to a review by the country's chief legal offi-
cer to ensure that planned covert operations are 
lawful. 
7. Findings: Presidential Reporting 
The Committees recommend that consistent with 
the concepts of accountability inherent in the Finding 
process, the obligtion to report covert action Findings 
should be placed on the President. 
Under current law, it is the head of the intelligence 
entity involved which has the obligation to report to 
Congress on covert action. Yet policy choices are 
inherently part of the Findings process and it is the 
President who must authorize covert operations 
through the signing of Findings. 
8. Recertification of Findings 
The Committees recommend that each Finding 
shall cease to be operative after one year unless the 
President certifies that the Finding is still in the na-
tional interest. The executive branch and the Intelli-
gence Committees should conduct frequent periodic 
reviews of all covert operations. 
9. Covert Actions Carried Out by Other Countries 
The Committees believe that the definition of 
covert action should be changed so that it includes a 
request by an agency of the United Sttes to a foreign 
country or a private citizen to conduct a covert 
action on behalf of the United States.

Chapter 28 
10. Reporting Covert Arms Transfers 
The Committees recommend that the law regulat-
ing the reporting of covert arms transfers be changed 
to require notice to Congress on any covert shipment 
of arms where the transfer is valued at more than $1 
million. 
Under current law, the Administration must report 
covert arms transfers involving any single item valued 
at more than $1 million. Since a TOW or a HAWK 
missile is individually worth less than $1 million, this 
reporting requirement did not apply to the Iranian 
arms sales even though two shipments involved $10 
million in arms or more. It is the value of a transfer, 
not the value of each component of a transfer, that 
matters. 
11. NSC Operational Activities 
The Committees recommend that the members and 
staff of the NSC not engage in covert actions. 
By statute the NSC was created to provide advice 
to the President on national security matters. But 
there is no express statutory prohibition on the NSC 
engaging in operational intelligence activities. 
12. NSC Reporting to Congress 
The Committees recommend legislation requiring 
that the President report to Congress periodically on 
the organization, size, function, and procedures of the 
NSC staff. 
Such a report should include a list of duties for 
each NSC staff position from the National Security 
Adviser on down, and whether incumbents have been 
detailed from a particular department or agency. It 
should include a description of the President's guide-
lines and other instructions to the NSC, the National 
Security Adviser, and NSC staff for their activities. 
Particular attention should be paid to the number and 
tenure of uniformed military personnel assigned to the 
NSC. 
13. Privatization 
The Committees recommend a strict accounting of 
all U.S. Government funds managed by private citi-
zens during the course of a covert action. 
The record of the Iran-Contra hearings reflects use 
of private parties to conduct diplomatic missions and 
covert actions. Private parties can be of considerable 
use to the Government in both types of ventures and 
their use should be permitted. However, the record 
reflects that funds generated during a covert action 
are subject to abuse in the hands of a private citizen 
involved in conducting a covert action. 
14. Preservation of Presidential Documents 
The Committees recommend that the Presidential 
Records Act be reviewed to determine how it can be 
made more effective. Possible improvements include 
the establishment of a system of consultation with the 
Archivist of the United States to ensure complete 
compliance with the Act, the creation of a program 
of education of affected staff as to the Act's provi-
sions, and the attachment of criminal penalties for 
violations of the Act. 
During the Iran-Contra hearings, Oliver North, 
John Poindexter, Fawn Hall, and others admitted to 
having altered and destroyed key documents relating 
to their activities. Such actions constitute violations of 
the Presidential Records Act, which was intended to 
ensure the preservation of documents of historical 
value that were generated by the Chief Executive and 
his immediate staff. 
15. CIA Inspector General and General Counsel 
The Committees recommend that a system be de-
veloped so that the CIA has an independent statutory 
Inspector General confirmed by the Senate, like the 
Inspectors General of other agencies, and that the 
General Counsel of the CIA be confirmed by the 
Senate. 
The CIA's internal investigation of the Iran-Contra 
Affair?conducted by the Office of the Inspector 
General?paralleled those of the Intelligence Commit-
tees and then the Iran Committees. It contributed to, 
and cooperated with, the Tower Board. Yet, the 
Office of the Inspector General appears not to have 
had the manpower, resources or tenacity to acquire 
key facts uncovered by the other investigations. 
The Committees also believe the General Counsel 
plays an important role in these matters and accord-
ingly should be confirmed by the Senate. 
16. Foreign Bank Records Treaties 
The Committees recommend that treaties be negoti-
ated with foreign countries whose banks are used to 
conceal financial transactions by U.S. citizens, and 
that these treaties covering foreign bank records 
specify that Congress, not just the Department of 
Justice, has the right to request, to receive, and to 
utilize such records. 
Many of the important records relating to the Iran-
Contra Affair were generated by foreign banks that 
were used by the Enterprise for the covert arms sales 
to Iran and the Contra supply operation. The Inde-
pendent Counsel has sought access to these Swiss 
bank records pursuant to a treaty with Switzerland. 
But the Independent Counsel and the Justice Depart-
ment do not believe the Congressional Committees 
are entitled under the terms of the treaty to receive 
these records. New treaties should assure Congress of 
access to such records and should streamline the 
process for obtaining them. The Independent Counsel 
had not received all of the Swiss bank records after 9 
months of waiting. Given the use of foreign banks by 
drug dealers, terrorists, and others involved in unlaw-

Chapter 28 
ful activity, it is more essential than ever that binding 
secrecy not be a shield for serious criminal conduct. 
17. National Security Council 
The Committees recommend that all statutory 
members of the National Security Council should be 
informed of Findings. 
18. Findings Cannot Supercede Law 
The Committees recommend legislation affirming 
what the Committees believe to be the existing law: 
that a Finding cannot be used by the President or any 
member of the executive branch to authorize an 
action inconsistent with, or contrary to, any statute of 
the United States. 
19. Improving Consistency in Dealing with 
Security Breaches 
The Committees recommend that consistent meth-
ods of dealing with leaks of classified information by 
government officials be developed. 
The record of these hearings is replete with expres-
sions of concern by executive branch officials over 
the problem of unauthorized handling and disclosure 
of classified information. The record is also replete 
with evidence that high NSC officials breached secu-
rity regulations and disclosed classified documents to 
unauthorized persons when it suited their purposes. 
Yet no steps have been taken to withdraw or even 
review clearances of such people. 
20. Review of Congressional Contempt Statutes 
The Committees recommend that the Congressional 
contempt statutes be reviewed by the appropriate 
Committees. 
There is a need, in Congressional investigations, for 
a swift and sure method of compelling compliance 
with Congressional orders for production of docu-
ments and the obtaining of testimony. These investiga-
tions raised questions about the adequacy of existing 
statutes. 
In addition, new legislation should make clear that 
a Congressional deposition, including one conducted 
by staff, is a "proceeding" at which testimony may be 
compelled under the immunity statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec-
tion 6001 et. seq. 
21. Review of Special Compartmented 
Operations Within the Department of Defense 
The Committees recommend that oversight by In-
telligence and Armed Services Committees of Con-
gress of special compartmented operations within the 
Department of Defense be strengthened to include 
systematic and comprehensive review of all such pro-
grams. 
426 
22. Review of Weapons Transfers by Chairman 
of Joint Chiefs of Staff 
The Committees recommend that the President 
issue an order requiring that the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff should be consulted prior to any 
transfer of arms by the United States for purposes of 
presenting his views as to the potential impact on the 
military balance and on the readiness of United States 
forces. 
23. National Security Adviser 
The Committees recommend that Presidents adopt 
as a matter of policy the principle that the National 
Security Adviser to the President of the United States 
should not be an active military officer and that there 
should be a limit placed on the tour of military offi-
cers assigned to the staff of the National Security 
Council. 
24. InteHigence Oversight Board 
The Committees recommend that the Intelligence 
Oversight Board be revitalized and strengthened. 
25. Review of Other Laws 
The Committees suggest that appropriate standing 
Committees review certain laws for possible changes: 
a. Should restrictions on sales of arms to certain 
countries under the Arms Export Control Act 
("AECA") and other statutes governing overt 
sales be made applicable to covert sales? 
b. Should the Hostage Act be repealed or amend-
ed? 
c. Should enforcement or monitoring provisions 
be added to the AECA so that we better control 
retransfers of U.S.-manufactured arms by coun-
tries to whom we sell them? 
26. Recommendations for Congress 
a. The Committees recommend that the oversight 
capabilities of the Intelligence Committees be 
strengthened by acquisition of an audit staff. 
b. The Committees recommend that the appropriate 
oversight committees conduct review of sole-source 
contracts for potential abuse. 
c. The Committees recommend that uniform proce-
dures be developed to ensure that classified informa-
tion is handled in a secure manner and that such 
procedures should include clear and strengthened 
sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of national secu-
rity secrets or classified information which shall be 
strictly enforced.

27. Joint Intelligence Committee 
The Committees recommend against consolidating 
the separate House and Senate Intelligence Commit-
tees into a single joint committee. We believe that 
such consolidation would inevitably erode Congress' 
ability to perform its oversight function in connection 
with intelligence activities and covert operations. 
Congress has structured its system for effective over-
sight in this area to meet the need for secrecy that 
necessarily accompanies intelligence activities and the 
creation of a single oversight committee would simply 
add nothing to this effort.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
President Reagan and his staff made mistakes 
in the Iran-Contra Affair.* It is important at 
the outset, however, to note that the Presi-
dent himself has already taken the hard step 
of acknowledging his mistakes and reacting 
precisely to correct what went wrong. He 
has directed the National Security Council 
staff not to engage in covert operations. He 
has changed the procedures for notifying 
Congress when an intelligence activity does 
take place. Finally, he has installed people 
with seasoned judgment to be White House 
Chief of Staff, National Security Adviser, 
and Director of Central Intelligence. 
The bottom line, however, is that the mis-
takes of the Iran-Contra Affair were just 
that?mistakes in judgment, and nothing 
more. There was no constitutional crisis, no 
systematic disrespect for "the rule of law," 
no grand conspiracy, and no Administration-
wide dishonesty or coverup. In fact, the evi-
dence will not support any of the more hys-
terical conclusions the Committees' Report 
tries to reach. 
No one in the government was acting out 
of corrupt motives. To understand what they 
did, it is important to understand the context 
within which they acted. The decisions we 
have been investigating grew out of: 
?Efforts to pursue important U.S. inter-
ests both in Central America and in the 
Middle East; 
?A compassionate, but disproportionate, 
concern for the fate of American citizens 
held hostage in Lebanon by terrorists, in-
cluding one CIA station chief who was 
killed as a result of torture; 
*See "Our View of the Iran-Contra Affair," below at 442 if. 
?A legitimate frustration with abuses of 
power and irresolution by the legislative 
branch; and 
?An equally legitimate frustration with 
leaks of sensitive national security secrets 
coming out of both Congress and the execu-
tive branch. 
Understanding this context can help explain 
and mitigate the resulting mistakes. It does 
not explain them away, or excuse their 
having happened. 
The Committees' Report and the 
Ongoing Battle 
The excesses of the Committees' Report are 
reflections of something far more profound. 
Deeper than the specifics of the Iran-Contra 
Affair lies an underlying and festering insti-
tutional wound these Committees have been 
unwilling to face. In order to support rhetor-
ical overstatements about democracy and the 
rule of law, the Committees have rested their 
case upon an aggrandizing theory of Con-
gress' foreign policy powers that is itself part 
of the problem. Rather than seeking to heal, 
the Committees' hearings and Report betray 
an attitude that we fear will make matters 
worse. The attitude is particularly regretta-
ble in light of the unprecedented steps the 
President took to cooperate with the Com-
mittees, and in light of the actions he already 
has taken to correct past errors. 
A substantial number of the mistakes of 
the Iran-Contra Affair resulted directly from 
an ongoing state of political guerrilla warfare 
over foreign policy between the legislative 
and executive branches. We would include 
in this category the excessive secrecy of the 
Iran initiative that resulted from a history 
437

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 1 
and legitimate fear of leaks. We also would 
include the approach both branches took 
toward the so-called Boland Amendments. 
Congressional Democrats tried to use vague-
ly worded and constantly changing laws to 
impose policies in Central America that went 
well beyond the law itself. For its own part, 
the Administration decided to work within 
the letter of the law covertly, instead of 
forcing a public and principled confrontation 
that would have been healthier in the long 
run. 
Given these kinds of problems, a sober 
examination of legislative-executive branch 
relations in foreign policy was sorely needed. 
It still is. Judgments about the Iran-Contra 
Affair ultimately must rest upon one's views 
about the proper roles of Congress and the 
President in foreign policy. There were 
many statements during the public hearings, 
for example, about the rule of law. But the 
fundamental law of the land is the Constitu-
tion. Unconstitutional statutes violate the 
rule of law every bit as much as do willful 
violations of constitutional statutes. It is es-
sential, therefore, to frame any discussion of 
what happened with a proper analysis of the 
Constitutional allocation of legislative and 
executive power in foreign affairs. 
The country's future security depends 
upon a modus vivendi in which each branch 
recognizes the other's legitimate and consti-
tutionally sanctioned sphere of activity. Con-
gress must recognize that an effective foreign 
policy requires, and the Constitution man-
dates, the President to be the country's for-
eign policy leader. At the same time, the 
President must recognize that his preemi-
nence rests upon personal leadership, public 
education, political support, and interbranch 
comity. Interbranch comity does not require 
Presidential obsequiousness, of course. Presi-
dents are elected to lead and to persuade. 
But Presidents must also have Congressional 
support for the tools to make foreign policy 
effective. No President can ignore Congress 
and be successful over the long term. Con-
gress must realize, however, that the power 
of the purse does not make it supreme. 
438 
Limits must be recognized by both branches, 
to protect the balance that was intended by 
the Framers, and that is still needed today 
for effective policy. This mutual recognition 
has been sorely lacking in recent years. 
Why We Reject the Committees' 
Report 
Sadly, the Committees' Report reads as if it 
were a weapon in the ongoing guerrilla war-
fare, instead of an objective analysis. Evi-
dence is used selectively, and unsupported 
inferences are drawn to support politically 
biased interpretations. As a result, we feel 
compelled to reject not only the Committees' 
conclusions, but the supposedly "factual" 
narrative as well. 
We always knew, of course, that there 
would be differences of interpretation. We 
had hoped at the start of this process, how-
ever, to arrive at a mutually agreeable state-
ment of facts. Unfortunately, that was not to 
be. The narrative is not a fair description of 
events, but an advocate's legal brief that 
arrays and selects so-called "facts" to fit pre-
conceived theories. Some of the resulting 
narrative is accurate and supported by the 
evidence. A great deal is overdrawn, specu-
lative, and built on a selective use of the 
Committees' documentary materials. 
The tone of the Report flows naturally 
from the tone of the Committees' televised 
hearings. We feel strongly that the decision 
to air the hearings compromised some intelli-
gence sources and methods by broadcasting 
inadvertent slips of the tongue. But one thing 
television did do successfully was lay bare 
the passions that animated too much of the 
Committees' work. Who can forget the mas-
sive displays of travelers' checks being 
shown to the country to discredit Col. 
North's character, weeks before he would be 
given a chance to reply? Or the "j'accuse" 
atmosphere with which witnesses were con-
fronted, beginning with the first week's pros-
ecutorial confrontation with General Secord, 
as Members used the witnesses as objects for 
lecturing the cameras? These tactics had

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 1 
little to do with factfinding, or with a careful 
review of policies and institutional processes. 
But we shall not dwell on the hearings at 
this stage. The respected constitutional 
scholar, John Norton Moore, has written an 
excellent article about them. We have at-
tached the article, "The Iran-Contra Hear-
ings and Intelligence Oversight in a Democ-
racy," along with other material Professor 
Moore sent the Committees, as an appendix 
to our Report. Suffice it to say that we agree 
with Moore completely. We mention the 
hearings now only to note that the same 
spirit, not surprisingly, has dominated the 
written Report. 
Our reasons for rejecting the Committees' 
Report can best be understood by sampling a 
few of its major conclusions. By presenting 
these examples, we hope to alert conscien-
tious readers?whether they agree with our 
interpretations or not?to take the narrative 
with a very large grain of salt. Regrettably, 
readers seeking the truth will be forced to 
wade through a mass of material to arrive at 
an independent judgment. 
The President's Knowledge of the 
Diversion 
The most politically charged example of the 
Committees' misuse of evidence is in the 
way it presents the President's lack of 
knowledge about the "diversion"?that is, 
the decision by the former National Security 
Adviser, Admiral John Poindexter, to au-
thorize the use of some proceeds from Iran 
arms sales to support the Nicaraguan demo-
cratic Resistance, or Contras. This is the one 
case out of thousands in which the Commit-
tees?instead of going beyond the evidence 
as the Report usually does?refused instead 
to accept the overwhelming evidence with 
which it was presented. The Report does 
grudgingly acknowledge that it cannot refute 
the President's repeated assertion that he 
knew nothing about the diversion before At-
torney General Edwin Meese discovered it 
in November 1986. Instead of moving for-
ward from this to more meaningful policy 
questions, however, the Report seeks, with-
out any support, to plant doubts. We will 
never know what was in the documents 
shredded by Lt. Col. Oliver L. North in his 
last days on the NSC staff, the Report says. 
Of course we will not. That same point 
could have been made, however, to cast un-
supported doubt upon every one of the Re-
port's own conclusions. This one seems to be 
singled out because it was where the Presi-
dent put his own credibility squarely on the 
line. 
The evidence shows that the President did 
not know about the diversion. As we discuss 
at length in our chapter on the subject, this 
evidence includes a great deal more than just 
Poindexter's testimony. Poindexter was cor-
roborated in different ways by the Presi-
dent's own diaries and by testimony from 
North, Meese, Commander Paul Thompson 
(formerly the NSC's General Counsel), and 
former White House Chief of Staff Donald 
Regan. The conclusion that the President did 
not know about the diversion, in other 
words, is one of the strongest of all the infer-
ences one can make from the evidence 
before these Committees. Any attempt to 
suggest otherwise can only be seen as an 
effort to sow meritless doubts in the hope of 
reaping a partisan political advantage. 
The Idea for the Diversion and the 
Use of Israeli Evidence 
In the normal course of the narrative's hun-
dreds of pages, the lack of objectivity stems 
more from the way it selects, and makes 
questionable inferences, from a scarcity of 
evidence, rather than a deliberate decision to 
ignore what is available. This becomes most 
obvious when we see a witness dismissed as 
being not credible for one set of events, and 
then see the same witnesses' uncorroborated 
testimony become the basis for a major set of 
assertions about other events. If these flip-
flops could be explained by neutral rules of 
evidence, or if they were random, we could 
treat them more lightly. But something quite 
different seems to be at work here. The nar-
rative seems to make every judgment about 
the evidence in favor of the interpretation 
439

Chapter 1 
that puts the Administration in the worst 
possible light. Two examples involving 
North will make the point clearly. The first 
has to do with when he first got the idea for 
a diversion. 
North testified that he first got the idea for 
diverting some of the Iran arms sale pro-
ceeds to the Contras from Manucher Ghor-
banifar at a London hotel meeting in late 
January 1986. He acknowledged that the 
subject of using the residuals to replenish 
Israeli weapon supplies, and for related oper-
ations, came up in a discussion with Amiram 
Nir, an Israeli official, in late December or 
early January. North specifically said, how-
ever, that the Nir conversation had nothing 
to do with the Contras.2 
The Committees also received a chronolo-
gy from the Israeli Government, however, 
that claimed North told Israeli supply offi-
cials in New York on December 6 that the 
Contras needed money, and that he intended 
to use proceeds from the Iran arms sales to 
get them some. When North was asked 
about the December 6 meeting, he reiterated 
that he did not recall discussing the Contras 
with anyone involved in the Iran initiative 
before the late January meeting with Ghor-
banifar. 3 
The Committees' Report has used the Is-
raeli chronology, and the timing of North's 
alleged December 6 conversation, to suggest 
that the idea of gaining funds for the Nicara-
guan Resistance was an important consider-
ation that kept the Iran arms initiative alive, 
more than a month before the President 
signed the Finding of January 17. The prob-
lem with making this important inference is 
that we have no way of knowing whether 
the Israeli chronology is accurate. It may be, 
but then again it may not. The Government 
of Israel made its chronology available to 
the Committees fairly late in our investiga-
tions, and consistently refused to let key Is-
raeli participants give depositions to the 
Committees' counsel. 
We have no quarrel with the fact that 
Israel, or any other sovereign nation, may 
refuse to let its officials and private citizens 
440 
be subject to interrogation by a foreign legis-
lature. The United States, no doubt, would 
do the same. But we do object vehemently 
to the idea that the Committees should use 
unsworn and possibly self-serving informa-
tion from a foreign government to reject 
sworn testimony given by a U.S. official?
particularly when the U.S. official's testimo-
ny was given under a grant of immunity that 
protected him from prosecution arising out 
of the testimony for any charge except perju-
ry. 
Even if North did mention the Contras to 
the Israeli supply officials in early Decem-
ber, however, the inference made from the 
timing would be unfair. The Committees 
have no evidence that would give them any 
reason to believe that anyone other than 
North even considered the Contras in con-
nection with the Iran arms sales before the 
January Finding. Poindexter specifically tes-
tified that he first heard of the idea when 
North asked him to authorize it in Febru-
ary.4 North testified that he first mentioned 
the idea to the Director of Central Intelli-
gence, William J. Casey, at about the same 
time, in late January or early February, after 
the post-finding London meeting.5 More im-
portantly, North and Poindexter both testi-
fied that no one else in the U.S. Government 
was told about a diversion before this time. 
What that means is that the diversion cannot 
possibly have been a consideration for 
people at the policymaking level when the 
President decided to proceed with the Iran 
initiative in January. 
Off-the-Shelf, Privately Funded 
Covert Operations 
Paradoxically, the Committees seem to have 
had no difficulty swallowing North's testi-
mony that Director Casey intended to create 
a privately funded, off-the-shelf covert oper-
ations capability for use in a variety of un-
foreseen circumstances.6 This is despite the 
fact that two people close to Casey at the 
CIA, Deputy Director of Central Intelli-
gence John M. McMahon and Deputy Di-
rector for Operations Clair George, both

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 1 
denied Casey would ever have countenanced 
such an idea. "My experience with Bill 
Casey was absolute," said George. "He 
would never have approved it." 7 
We have to concede the possibility, of 
course, that Casey might have discussed 
such an idea speculatively with North with-
out mentioning it to others at the CIA.* As 
with so many other questions, we will never 
know the answers with certainty. Casey's 
terminal illness prevented him from testifying 
between December 1986 and his death in 
May 1987. Nevertheless, it is interesting to 
note how much the majority is willing to 
make of one uncorroborated, disputed North 
statement that happens to suit its political 
purpose, in light of the way it treats others 
by North that are less convenient for the 
narrative's thesis. 
The Allegation of Systematic 
Cover-up 
The Report also tries to present the events 
of November 1986 as if they represent a sys-
tematic attempt by the Administration to 
cover up the facts of the Iran initiative. The 
reason for the alleged coverup, it is suggest-
ed, was to keep the American people from 
learning that the 1985 arms sales were "ille-
gal." 
There can be no question that the Admin-
istration was reluctant to make all of the 
facts public in early November, when news 
of the arms sales first came out in a Lebanese 
weekly. It is clear from the evidence that 
this was a time when covert diplomatic dis-
cussions were still being conducted with 
Iran, and there was some basis for thinking 
more hostages might be released. We consid-
er the Administration's reticence in the early 
part of the month to have been completely 
justifiable. 
However, as November 1986 wore on, 
Poindexter and North did falsify the docu-
mentary record in a way that we find de-
plorable. The outstanding fact about the late 
We use the word "speculatively" here because North testified, 
at the same time as he introduced the idea, that it never was put 
into effect. 
November events, however, is that Attorney 
General Meese understood the importance of 
getting at the truth. Working on a very tight 
schedule, Meese and three others from the 
Department of Justice managed to uncover 
the so-called "diversion memorandum" and 
reported it to the President. The President 
immediately removed Poindexter and North 
from the NSC staff. Shortly afterwards, he 
asked for an Independent Counsel to be ap-
pointed, appointed the Tower Board, and 
supported the establishment of select Con-
gressional investigative committees, to which 
he has given unprecedented cooperation. 
The Committees' Report criticizes Meese 
for not turning his fact-finding operation into 
a formal criminal investigation a day or two 
earlier than he did. In fact, the Report 
strongly tries to suggest that Meese either 
must have been incompetent or must have 
been trying to give Poindexter and North 
more time to cover their tracks. We consider 
the first of these charges to be untrue and 
the second to be outrageous. We shall show 
in a later chapter that Meese worked with 
the right people, and the right number of 
them, for a national security fact-finding in-
vestigation. Whatever after-the-fact criticism 
people may want to make, it is irresponsible 
to portray the Administration, in light of 
Meese's behavior, as if it were interested in 
anything but learning the truth and getting it 
out as quickly as possible. 
The "Rule of Law" 
Finally, the Committees' Report tries?
almost as an overarching thesis?to portray 
the Administration as if it were behaving 
with wanton disregard for the law. In our 
view, every single one of the Committees' 
legal interpretations is open to serious ques-
tion. On some issues?particularly the ones 
involving the statutes governing covert oper-
ations?we believe the law to be clearly on 
the Administration's side. In every other 
case, the issue is at least debatable. In some, 
such as the Boland Amendment, we are con-
vinced we have by far the better argument. 
In a few others?such as who owns the

Chapter 1 
funds the Iranians paid Gen. Richard Secord 
and Albert Hakim?we see the legal issue as 
being close. During the course of our full 
statement, we shall indicate which is which. 
What the Committees' Report has done 
with the legal questions, however, is to issue 
a one-sided legal brief that pretends the Ad-
ministration did not even have worthwhile 
arguments to make. As if that were not 
enough, the Report tries to build upon these 
one-sided assertions to present a politicized 
picture of an Administration that behaved 
with contempt for the law. If nothing else 
would lead readers to view the Report with 
extreme skepticism, the adversarial tone of 
the legal discussion should settle the matter. 
Our View of the Iran-Contra 
Affair  
The main issues raised by the Iran-Contra 
Affair are not legal ones, in our opinion. 
This opinion obviously does have to rest on 
some legal conclusions, however. We have 
summarized our legal conclusions at the end 
of this introductory chapter. The full argu-
ments appear in subsequent chapters. In our 
view, the Administration did proceed legally 
in pursuing both its Contra policy and the 
Iran arms initiative. We grant that the diver-
sion does raise some legal questions, as do 
some technical and relatively insubstantial 
matters relating to the Arms Export Control 
Act. It is important to stress, however, that 
the Administration could have avoided every 
one of the legal problems it inadvertently 
encountered, while continuing to pursue the 
exact same policies as it did. 
The fundamental issues, therefore, have to 
do with the policy decisions themselves, and 
with the political judgments underlying the 
way policies were implemented. When these 
matters are debated as if they were legal?
and even criminal?concerns, it is a sign that 
interbranch intimidation is replacing and de-
basing deliberation. That is why we part 
company not only with the Committees Re-
port's answers, but with the very questions it 
identifies as being the most significant. 
442 
There are common threads to what we 
think went wrong with the Administration's 
policies toward Central America and Iran. 
Before we can identify those threads, how-
ever, we will give a very brief overview of 
the two halves of the Committees' investiga-
tions. For both halves, we begin with the 
context within which decisions were made, 
describe the decisions, and then offer some 
judgments. After taking the parts separately, 
we will then be in a position to talk about 
commonalities. 
Nicaragua 
The Nicaraguan aspect of the Iran-Contra 
Affair had its origins in several years of 
bitter political warfare over U.S. policy 
toward Central America between the 
Reagan Administration and the Democratic 
House of Representatives. The United States 
had supported the Sandinistas in the last 
phase of the dictatorial regime of Anastasio 
Somoza and then gave foreign aid to Nicara-
gua in 1979 and 1980, the first years of San-
dinista rule. By 1980, however, the Sandinis-
tas had shed their earlier "democratic re-
former" disguise and begun to suppress civil 
liberties at home and export revolution 
abroad. As a result, the United States sus-
pended all aid to Nicaragua in the closing 
days of the Carter Administration. 
During the early years of the Reagan Ad-
ministration, the Soviet Union and its allies 
dramatically increased their direct military 
support for Nicaragua, and their indirect 
support, through Nicaragua, of Communist 
guerrillas in El Salvador. The Reagan Ad-
ministration decided to provide covert sup-
port for the Nicaraguan democratic Resist-
ance in late 1981, and Congress agreed. By 
late 1982, however, Congress adopted the 
first of a series of so-called "Boland Amend-
ments," prohibiting the CIA and Defense 
Department from spending money "for the 
purpose of overthrowing the Government of 
Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange 
between Nicaragua and Honduras." The 
House voted for this "limitation" by a

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 1 
margin of 411-0, in large part because every-
one understood that the Administration 
could continue to support the Resistance as 
long as the purpose of the support was to 
prevent the revolution from being exported 
to El Salvador. 
This approach left many unsatisfied. Some 
within the Administration wanted a broader 
attack on the Sandinista regime. Some within 
Congress wanted to end all support for the 
Contras and begin moving back toward the 
1979-80 policy of providing economic assist-
ance to the Sandinistas. Neither side of the 
policy debate was politically strong enough 
to prevail. Instead, during the course of the 
next several years, Congress and the Admin-
istration "compromised" on a series of am-
biguous formulas. 
Meanwhile, the Soviet buildup acceler-
ated, and Sandinista support for the insur-
gents in El Salvador continued. In May 
1983, the House Intelligence Committee, 
chaired by Representative Edward P. 
Boland, reported: 
It is not popular support that sustains 
the insurgents [in El Salvador]. As 
will be discussed later, this insurgency 
depends for its lifeblood?arms, am-
munition, financing, logistics and com-
mand-and-control facilities?upon out-
side assistance from Nicaragua and 
Cuba. This Nicaraguan-Cuban contri-
bution to the Salvadoran insurgency is 
long standing. It began shortly after 
the overthrow of Somoza in July, 
1979. It has provided?by land, sea 
and air?the great bulk of the military 
equipment and support received by 
the insurgents.8 
Despite this finding, House Democrats 
succeeded in late 1983 in limiting appropri-
ated support for the Resistance to an amount 
intentionally calculated to be insufficient for 
the full fiscal year. The funds ran out by late 
spring or summer 1984. By October, the 
most stringent of the Boland Amendments 
had taken effect. Paradoxically, Congress' 
1983-85 decisions came in a context in 
which it was continuing to pass laws that 
accused the Sandinistas of violating the non-
aggression provisions of the charter of the 
Organization of American States?a viola-
tion that the OAS charter says calls for a 
response by other member nations, including 
the United States.* 
Actions 
By the late spring of 1984, it became clear 
that the Resistance would need some source 
of money if it were to continue to survive 
while the Administration tried to change 
public and Congressional opinion. To help 
bridge the gap, some Administration officials 
began encouraging foreign governments and 
U.S. private citizens to support the Contras. 
NSC staff members played a major role in 
these efforts, but were specifically ordered to 
avoid direct solicitations. The President 
clearly approved of private benefactor and 
third-country funding, and neither he nor his 
designated agents could constitutionally be 
prohibited from encouraging it. To avoid po-
litical retribution, however, the Administra-
tion did not inform Congress of its actions. 
In addition to encouraging contributions, 
the NSC's North, with varying degrees of 
authorization and knowledge by National Se-
curity Advisers Robert C. McFarlane and 
Admiral John Poindexter: 
?Helped coordinate or facilitate actions 
taken by private citizens and by certain U.S. 
*Despite the fact that the Committees announced that their hear-
ings were to be neither "pro-Contra nor anti-Contra," the fact is 
that the Committees' staff left no stone unturned in its efforts to 
obtain information that might be politically damaging to the Resist-
ance, even if irrelevant to the Committees' mandates. The Commit-
tees' investigators reviewed major portions, if not all, of the Con-
tras' financial records; met with witnesses who alleged the Resist-
ance was involved in terrorism or drug-running; investigated the 
financial conduct of the NHAO program, and so on. The fact is, 
however, that the Committees received no credible evidence of 
misconduct by the Resistance. It comes as little surprise, of course, 
that the Committees' majority does not explicitly acknowledge this. 
To give but one example of the Committees' findings, investigators 
produced a detailed memorandum concerning allegations of drug 
running, and concluded that the allegation had no substance. This 
memorandum was included in the Committees' record and is re-
printed as Appendix E to the Minority Report. For this reason, 
suggestions that the Committees have not investigated such matters, 
and other Committees of Congress should, ought to be seen for 
what they are: political harassment by Congressional opponents of 
the Resistance.

or supplies from private U.S. citizens or for-
eign governments to the Nicaraguan Resist-
ance; 
?Provided the Resistance with expert 
military judgment or advice to assist in the 
resupply effort; and 
?Together with others in Government, 
provided the Resistance with intelligence in-
formation that was useful in the resupply 
effort. 
Poindexter and North testified that they both 
believed these activities were legally permis-
sible and authorized. They also said that the 
President was kept generally informed of 
their coordinating role. The President has 
said, however, that he was not aware of the 
NSC staffs military advice and coordination. 
Because the Boland Amendment is an ap-
propriations rider, it is worth noting that 
there is no evidence that any substantial 
amounts of appropriated taxpayer funds were 
used in support of these efforts. In addition, 
the NSC staff believed?as we do?that the 
prohibition did not cover the NSC.9 At no 
time, in other words, did members of the 
President's staff think their activities were 
illegal. Nevertheless, the NSC staff did make 
a concerted effort to conceal its actions from 
Congress. There is no evidence, however, to 
suggest that the President or other senior 
Administration officials knew about this con-
cealment. 
Judgments 
The effort to raise foreign government and 
private funds for the Resistance raised about 
$35 million between mid-1984 and mid-
1986?virtually all of it from foreign coun-
tries. In addition, the much discussed and 
unauthorized diversion orchestrated by 
North and Poindexter contributed about $3.8 
million more. Without this support, accord-
ing to uncontroverted testimony the Com-
mittees received, there can be no question 
that the Resistance would have been annihi-
lated. In other words, the support clearly did 
make an important strategic difference in the 
2 years it took the Administration to per-
444 
suade Congress to reverse its position. The 
short-term benefits of the effort are therefore 
undeniable. The long-term costs, however, 
seem not to have been adequately consid-
ered. 
We do believe, for reasons explained in 
the appendix to this introductory chapter 
and in our subsequent chapters on Nicara-
gua, that virtually all of the NSC staffs ac-
tivities were legal, with the possible excep-
tion of the diversion of Iran arms sale pro-
ceeds to the Resistance. We concede that 
reasonable people may take a Contrary view 
of what Congress intended the Boland 
Amendments to mean. But we also agree 
with a letter from Prof. John Norton Moore, 
which appears as Appendix B to our Report, 
that to the extent that the amendment was 
ambiguous, "well recognized principles of 
due process and separation of powers would 
require that it be interpreted to protect Ex-
ecutive Branch flexibility." 10 
Notwithstanding our legal opinions, we 
think it was a fundamental mistake for the 
NSC staff to have been secretive and decep-
tive about what it was doing. The require-
ment for building long-term political support 
means that the Administration would have 
been better off if it had conducted its activi-
ties in the open. Thus, the President should 
simply have vetoed the strict Boland 
Amendment in mid-October 1984, even 
though the Amendment was only a few 
paragraphs in an approximately 1,200 page-
long continuing appropriations resolution, 
and a veto therefore would have brought the 
Government to a standstill within 3 weeks of 
a national election. Once the President decid-
ed against a veto, it was self-defeating to 
think a program this important could be sus-
tained by deceiving Congress. Whether tech-
nically illegal or not, it was politically fool-
ish and counterproductive to mislead Con-
gress, even if misleading took the form of 
artful evasion or silence instead of overt mis-
statement. 
We do believe firmly that the NSC staff's 
deceits were not meant to hide illegalities. 
Every witness we have heard told us his

Chapter 1 
concern was not over legality, but with the 
fear that Congress would respond to com-
plete disclosure with political reprisals, prin-
cipally by tightening the Boland Amend-
ments. That risk should have been taken. 
We are convinced that the Constitution 
protects much of what the NSC was doing?
particularly those aspects that had to do with 
encouraging contributions and sharing infor-
mation. The President's inherent constitu-
tional powers are only as strong, however, 
as the President's willingness to defend them. 
As for the NSC actions Congress could con-
stitutionally have prohibited, it would have 
been better for the White House to have 
tackled that danger head on. Some day, Con-
gress' decision to withhold resources may 
tragically require U.S. citizens to make an 
even heavier commitment to Central Amer-
ica, perhaps one measured in blood and not 
dollars. The commitment that might elimi-
nate such an awful future will not be forth-
coming unless the public is exposed to and 
persuaded by a clear, sustained and princi-
pled debate on the merits. 
Iran 
The Iran arms sales had their roots in an 
intelligence failure. The potential geopolitical 
importance of Iran for the United States 
would be obvious to anyone who looks at a 
map. Despite Iran's importance, the United 
States was taken by surprise when the Shah 
fell in 1979, because it had not developed an 
adequate human intelligence capability there. 
Our hearings have established that essentially 
nothing had been done to cure this failure by 
the mid-1980's. Then, the United States was 
approached by Israel in 1985 with a proposal 
that the United States acquiesce in some 
minor Israeli arms sales to Iran. This propos-
al came at a time when the United States 
was already considering the advisability of 
such sales. For long term, strategic reasons, 
the United States had to improve relation-
ships with at least some of the currently im-
portant factions in Iran. The lack of adequate 
intelligence about these factions made it im-
portant to pursue any potentially fruitful op-
portunity; it also made those pursuits inher-
ently risky. U.S. decisions had to be based 
on the thinnest of independently verifiable 
information. Lacking such independent intel-
ligence, the United States was forced to rely 
on sources known to be biased and unreli-
able. 
Well aware of the risk, the Administration 
nonetheless decided the opportunity was 
worth pursuing. The major participants in 
the Iran arms affair obviously had some 
common and some conflicting interests. The 
key question the United States had to ex-
plore was whether the U.S. and Iranian lead-
ership actually felt enough of a common in-
terest to establish a strategic dialogue. 
Actions 
To explore the chance for an opening, the 
President agreed first to approve Israeli sales 
to Iran in 1985, and then in 1986 to sell U.S. 
arms directly. The amounts involved were 
meager. The total amount, including all of 
the 1985 and 1986 sales combined, consisted 
of 2004 TOW antitank missiles, 18 HAWK 
antiaircraft missiles, and about 200 types of 
HAWK spare parts. 
There was a strong division of opinion in 
the Administration about the advisability of 
these arms sales, a division that never abated. 
Unfortunately, this served as a pretext for 
Poindexter's decision not to keep the Secre-
taries of State or Defense informed about the 
detailed progress of the negotiations between 
the United States and Iran. One reason for 
the failure to inform appears to have been a 
past history in which some Administration 
officials may have leaked sensitive informa-
tion as a way to halt actions with which 
they disagreed. Poindexter's secretive incli-
nations were abetted by Secretary Shultz, 
who all but invited Poindexter not to keep 
him informed because he did not want to be 
accused of leaking. They also were abetted 
by Secretary Weinberger, who?like 
Shultz?was less than vigorous about keep-
ing himself informed about a policy he had 
good reason to believe was still going for-
ward.

Chapter 1 
The first deals with the Iranian Govern-
ment were flawed by the unreliability of our 
intermediary, Manucher Ghorbanifar. For all 
of his unreliability, however, Ghorbanifar 
helped obtain the release of two U.S. hos-
tages and did produce high Iranian officials 
for the first face-to-face meetings between 
our governments in 5 years. At those meet-
ings, one of which was held in Tehran in 
May 1986, U.S. officials sought consistently 
to make clear that we were interested in a 
long-term strategic relationship with Iran to 
oppose the Soviet Union's territorial inter-
ests. As concerned as the President had 
become personally for the fate of the hos-
tages?including the CIA's Beirut station 
chief, William Buckley, who was repeatedly 
tortured until he died?the hostages were 
always presented in these negotiations as ob-
stacles to be overcome, not as the reason for 
the initiative. But Ghorbanifar appeared to 
have misled both sides, and the Iranian offi-
cials seemed to be interested only in weap-
ons, and in using the hostages for bargaining 
leverage. 
After the Tehran meeting, the United 
States was able to approach a very high Ira-
nian official using a Second Channel ar-
ranged by Albert Hakim and his associates. 
There is little doubt about Hakim's business 
motives in arranging these meetings; there is 
equally little doubt that this channel repre-
sented the highest levels of the Iranian Gov-
ernment. Discussions with this channel began 
in the middle of 1986 and continued until 
December. They resulted in the release of 
one further hostage and U.S. officials expect-
ed them to result in some more. Perhaps 
more importantly, these discussions appear 
to have been qualitatively different from the 
ones conducted through the First Channel 
arranged by Ghorbanifar, and included some 
talks about broad areas of strategic coopera-
tion. 
As a result of factional infighting inside 
the Iranian Government, the initiative was 
exposed and substantive discussions were 
suspended. Not surprisingly, given the nature 
of Iranian politics, the Iranian Government 
446 
has publicly denied that significant negotia-
tions were underway. Congress was not in-
formed of the Administration's dealings with 
Iran until after the public disclosure. The 
failure to disclose resembled the Carter Ad-
ministration's similar decisions not to disclose 
in the parallel Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-
81. President Reagan withheld disclosure 
longer than Carter, however?by about 11 
months to 6. 
Judgments 
The Iran initiative involved two govern-
ments that had sharp differences between 
them. There were also very sharp internal 
divisions in both Iran and the United States 
about how to begin narrowing the differ-
ences between the two countries. In such a 
situation, the margin between narrow failure 
and success can seem much wider after the 
fact than it does during the discussions. 
While the initial contacts developed by Israel 
and used by the United States do not appear 
likely to have led to a long-term relationship, 
we cannot rule out the possibility that nego-
tiations with the Second Channel might have 
turned out differently. At this stage, we 
never will know what might have been. 
In retrospect, it seems clear that this initia-
tive degenerated into a series of "arms for 
hostage" deals. It did not look that way to 
many of the U.S. participants at the time. 
Nevertheless, the fact that the negotiations 
never were able clearly to separate the long-
term from the short-term issues, confirms our 
instinctive judgment that the United States 
should not have allowed arms to become the 
currency by which our country's bona fides 
were determined. There is no evidence that 
these relatively minor sales materially altered 
the military balance in the Iran-Iraq war. 
However, the sales damaged U.S. credibility 
with our allies, making it more difficult, 
among other things, for the Administration 
to enforce its preexisting efforts to embargo 
arms sales to Iran. 
The decision to keep Congress in the dark 
for 11 months disturbs all Members of these 
Committees. It is clear that the Reagan Ad-

Chapter 1 
ministration simply did not trust the Con-
gress to keep secrets. Based on the history of 
leaks we shall outline in a later chapter, it 
unfortunately had good reason to be con-
cerned. This observation is not offered as a 
justification, but as an important part of the 
context that must be understood. To help 
remove this concern as an excuse for future 
Administrations, we are proposing a series of 
legislative and administrative recommenda-
tions to improve both Congress' and the ex-
ecutive branch's ability to maintain national 
security secrets and deter leaks. 
Diversion 
The lack of detailed information-sharing 
within the Administration was what made it 
possible for Poindexter to authorize the di-
version and successfully keep his decision to 
do so from the President. We have already 
indicated our reasons for being convinced 
the President knew nothing about the diver-
sion. The majority Report says that if the 
President did not know about it, he should 
have. We agree, and so does the President. 
But unlike some of the other decisions we 
have been discussing, the President cannot 
himself be faulted for this one. The decision 
was Admiral Poindexter's, and Poindexter's 
alone. 
As supporters of a strong Presidential role 
in foreign policy, we cannot take Poin-
dexter's decision lightly. The Constitution 
strikes an implicit bargain with the President: 
in return for getting significant discretionary 
power to act, the President was supposed to 
be held accountable for his decisions. By 
keeping an important decision away from the 
President, Poindexter was acting to undercut 
one foundation for the discretionary Presi-
dential power he was exercising. 
The diversion also differs from the basic 
Nicaragua and Iran policies in another im-
portant respect: we can find nothing to justi-
fy or mitigate its having occurred. We do 
understand the enthusiasm North displayed 
when he told the Committees it was a "neat 
idea" to use money from the Ayatollah, who 
was helping the Sandinistas, to support the 
Contras. But enthusiasm is not a sufficient 
basis for important policy decisions. Even if 
there were nothing else wrong with the di-
version, the decision to mix two intelligence 
operations increased the risk of pursuing 
either one, with predictably disastrous reper-
cussions. 
Unlike the Committees' majority, we be-
lieve there are good legal arguments on both 
sides of the question of whether the proceeds 
of the arms sales belong to the U.S. Govern-
ment or to Secord and Hakim. For that 
reason, we think it unlikely, under the cir-
cumstances, that the funds were acquired or 
used with any criminal intent. Nevertheless, 
the fact that the ownership seems unclear 
under current law does not please us. We do 
believe that Secord and Hakim were acting 
as the moral equivalents of U.S. agents, even 
if they were not U.S. agents in law. 
The diversion has led some of the Com-
mittees' Members to express a great deal of 
concern in the public hearings about the use 
of private citizens in covert operations in 
settings that mix private profits with public 
benefits. We remain convinced that covert 
operations will continue to have to use pri-
vate agents or contractors in the future, and 
that those private parties will continue to 
operate at least partly from profit motives. If 
the United States tries to limit itself to deal-
ing only with people who act out of purely 
patriotic motives, it effectively will rule out 
any worthwhile dealing with most arms 
dealers and foreign agents. In the real world 
of international politics, it would be foolish 
to avoid working with people whose motives 
do not match our own. Nevertheless, we do 
feel troubled by the fact that there was not 
enough legal clarity, or accounting controls, 
placed on the Enterprise by the NSC. 
The Uncovering 
It is clear that officials of the National Secu-
rity Council misled the Congress and other 
members of the Administration about their 
activities in support of the Nicaraguan Re-
sistance. This occurred without authorization

Chapter 1 
from outside the NSC staff. It is also clear 
that the NSC staff actively misled other Ad-
ministration officials and Congress about the 
Iran initiative both before and after the first 
public disclosure. The shredding of docu-
ments and other efforts at covering up what 
had happened were also undertaken by NSC 
staff members acting on their own, without 
the knowledge, consent, or acquiescence of 
the President or other major Administration 
officials, with the possible exception of 
Casey. 
In the week or two immediately after the 
Iran initiative was disclosed in a Lebanese 
weekly, the President did not tell the public 
all that he knew, because negotiations with 
the Second Channel were still going on, and 
there remained a good reason for hoping 
some more hostages might soon be released. 
Once the President learned that not all of the 
relevant facts were being brought to his at-
tention, however, he authorized the Attor-
ney General immediately to begin making 
inquiries. Attorney General Meese acted 
properly in his investigation, pursuing the 
matter as a fact-finding effort because he had 
no reason at the time to believe a crime had 
been committed. Arguments to the contrary 
are based strictly on hindsight. In our opin-
ion, the Attorney General and other Justice 
Department officials did an impressive job 
with a complicated subject in a short time. 
After all, it was their investigation that un-
covered and disclosed the diversion of funds 
to the Contras. 
Common Threads 
The different strands of the Iran-Contra 
Affair begin coming together, in the most 
obvious way, on the level of personnel. Both 
halves of the event were run by the NSC, 
specifically by McFarlane, Poindexter, and 
North. With respect to Nicaragua, the 
Boland Amendment just about ruled all 
other agencies out of the picture. With re-
spect to Iran, the other parts of the executive 
branch?from the State and Defense Depart-
ments to the CIA?seemed more than happy 
to let the NSC be in charge. 
448 
It is ironic that many have looked upon 
these events as signs of an excessively pow-
erful NSC staff. In fact, the NSC's roles in 
the Iran and Nicaragua policies were excep-
tions rather than the rule. The Reagan Ad-
ministration has been beleaguered from the 
beginning by serious policy disagreements 
between the Secretaries of State and De-
fense, among others, and the President has 
too often not been willing to settle those 
disputes definitively. The press accounts 
written at the time Poindexter was promoted 
to fill McFarlane's shoes saw his selection as 
a decision to have the National Security Ad-
viser play the role of honest broker, with 
little independent power." This image of 
the NSC lasted almost until the Iran arms 
initiative became public. Poindexter was seen 
as a technician, chosen to perform a techni-
cal job, not to exercise political judgment.12 
Once the NSC had to manage two oper-
ations that were bound to raise politically 
sensitive questions, it should have been no 
surprise to anyone that Poindexter made 
some mistakes. It is not satisfactory, howev-
er, for people in the Administration simply 
to point the finger at him and walk away 
from all responsibility. For one thing, the 
President himself does have to bear personal 
responsibility for the people he picks for top 
office. But just as it would not be appropri-
ate for the fingers to point only at Poin-
dexter, neither is it right for them only to 
point to the top. 
Everyone who had a stake in promoting a 
technician to be National Security Adviser 
should have realized that meant they had a 
responsibility to follow and highlight the po-
litical consequences of operational decisions 
for the President. Even if the Cabinet offi-
cials did not support the basic policy, they 
had an obligation to remain engaged, if they 
could manage to do so without constantly 
rearguing the President's basic policy choice. 
Similarly, Chief of Staff Donald Regan may 
not have known, or had reason to know, the 
details of the Iran initiative or Contra resup-
ply effort. But he should have known that 
North's responses to Congressional inquiries

Chapter 1 
generated by press reports were too impor-
tant politically to be left to the people who 
ran the NSC staff. 
The discussion of personnel ultimately gets 
around to the importance of political judg-
ment. We can be more precise about what 
that means, however, if we consider the 
common threads in the decisions we have 
already labelled as mistakes. These have in-
cluded: 
?The President's decision to sign the 
Boland Amendment of 1984, instead of veto-
ing it; 
?The President's less-than-robust defense 
of his office's constitutional powers, a mis-
take he repeated when he acceded too read-
ily and too completely to waive executive 
privilege for our Committees' investigation; 
?The NSC staffs decision to deceive 
Congress about what it was doing in Central 
America; 
?The decision, in Iran, to pursue a covert 
policy that was at odds with the Administra-
tion's public expressions, without any warn-
ing signals to Congress or our allies; 
?The decision to use a necessary and con-
stitutionally protected power of withholding 
information from Congress for unusually sen-
sitive covert operations, for a length of time 
that stretches credulity; 
?Poindexter's decision to authorize the 
diversion on his own; and, finally, 
?Poindexter and North's apparent belief 
that covering up was in the President's polit-
ical interest. 
We emphatically reject the idea that 
through these mistakes, the executive branch 
subverted the law, undermined the Constitu-
tion, or threatened democracy. The Presi-
dent is every bit as much of an elected repre-
sentative of the people as is a Member of 
Congress. In fact, he and the Vice President 
are the only officials elected by the whole 
Nation. Nevertheless, we do believe the mis-
takes relate in a different way to the issue of 
democratic accountability. They provide a 
good starting point for seeing what both 
sides of the great legislative-executive branch 
divide must do to improve the way the Gov-
ernment makes foreign policy. 
Congress 
Congress has a hard time even conceiving of 
itself as contributing to the problem of 
democratic accountability. But the record of 
ever-changing policies toward Central 
America that contributed to the NSC staffs 
behavior is symptomatic of a frequently re-
curring problem. When Congress is narrow-
ly divided over highly emotional issues, it 
frequently ends up passing intentionally am-
biguous laws or amendments that postpone 
the day of decision. In foreign policy, those 
decisions often take the form of restrictive 
amendments on money bills that are open to 
being amended again every year, with new, 
and equally ambiguous, language replacing 
the old. This matter is exacerbated by the 
way Congress, year after year, avoids pass-
ing appropriations bills before the fiscal year 
starts and then wraps them together in a 
governmentwide continuing resolution 
loaded with amendments that cannot be 
vetoed without threatening the whole Gov-
ernment's operation. 
One properly democratic way to amelio-
rate the problem of foreign policy inconsist-
ency would be to give the President an op-
portunity to address the major differences 
between himself and the Congress cleanly, 
instead of combining them with unrelated 
subjects. To restore the Presidency to the 
position it held just a few administrations 
ago, Congress should exercise the self-disci-
pline to split continuing resolutions into sep-
arate appropriation bills and present each of 
them individually to the President for his 
signature or veto. Even better would be a 
line-item veto that would permit the Presi-
dent to force Congress to an override vote 
without jeopardizing funding for the whole 
Government. Matters of war and peace are 
too important to be held hostage to govern-
mental decisions about funding Medicare or 
highways. To describe this legislative hos-
tage taking as democracy in action is to turn 
language on its head.

Chapter 1 
The Presidency 
The Constitution created the Presidency to 
be a separate branch of government whose 
occupant would have substantial discretion-
ary power to act. He was not given the 
power of an 18th century monarch, but nei-
ther was he meant to be a creature of Con-
gress. The country needs a President who 
can exercise the powers the Framers intend-
ed. As long as any President has those 
powers, there will be mistakes. It would be 
disastrous to respond to the possibility of 
error by further restraining and limiting the 
powers of the office. Then, instead of seeing 
occasional actions turn out to be wrong, we 
would be increasing the probability that 
future Presidents would be unable to act de-
cisively, thus guaranteeing ourselves a per-
petually paralyzed, reactive, and unclear for-
eign policy in which mistake by inaction 
would be the order of the day. 
If Congress can learn something about 
democratic responsibility from the Iran-
Contra Affair, future Presidents can learn 
something too. The Administration would 
have been better served over the long run by 
insisting on a principled confrontation over 
those strategic issues that can be debated 
publicly. Where secrecy is necessary, as it 
often must be, the Administration should 
have paid more careful attention to consulta-
tion and the need for consistency between 
what is public and what is covert. Inconsist-
ency carries a risk to a President's future 
ability to persuade, and persuasion is at the 
heart of a vigorous, successful presidency. 
A President's most important priorities, 
the ones that give him a chance to leave an 
historic legacy, can be attained only through 
persistent leadership that leads to a lasting 
change in the public's understanding and 
opinions. President Reagan has been praised 
by his supporters as a "communicator" and 
criticized by his opponents as an ideologue. 
The mistakes of the Iran-Contra Affair, iron-
ically, came from a lack of communication 
and an inadequate appreciation of the impor-
tance of ideas. During President Reagan's 
terms of office, he has persistently taken two 
450 
major foreign policy themes to the American 
people: a strong national defense for the 
United States, and support for the institu-
tions of freedom abroad. The 1984 election 
showed his success in persuading the people 
to adopt his fundamental perspective. The 
events since then have threatened to under-
mine that achievement by shifting the agenda 
and refocusing the debate. If the President's 
substantial successes are to be sustained, it is 
up to him, and those of us who support his 
objectives, to begin once again with the task 
of democratic persuasion. 
Afterword: Summary of Legal 
Conclusions 
Nicaragua 
The main period under review during these 
investigations was October 1984 through Oc-
tober 1986. During this period, various ver-
sions of the Boland Amendment restricted 
the expenditure of appropriated funds avail-
able to agencies or entities involved in intel-
ligence activities from being spent directly or 
indirectly to support military or paramilitary 
operations in Nicaragua. In August 1985, the 
State Department was authorized to spend 
$27 million to provide humanitarian assist-
ance to the Nicaraguan democratic Resist-
ance. In December 1985, the CIA was au-
thorized to spend funds specifically appropri-
ated to provide communications equipment 
and training and to provide intelligence and 
counterintelligence advice and information to 
assist military operations by the Resistance. 
On October 18, 1986, $100 million in direct 
military support for the Contras was made 
available for fiscal year 1987. Our under-
standing of the effect of these prohibitions 
rests on both statutory and constitutional in-
terpretations. 
(1) The Constitution protects the power of 
the President, either acting himself or 
through agents of his choice, to engage in 
whatever diplomatic communications with 
other countries he may wish. It also protects 
the ability of the President and his agents to

Chapter 1 
persuade U.S. citizens to engage voluntarily 
in otherwise legal activity to serve what 
they consider to be the national interest. 
That includes trying to persuade other coun-
tries to contribute their own funds for causes 
both countries support. To whatever extent 
the Boland Amendments tried to prohibit 
such activity, they were clearly unconstitu-
tional. 
(2) If the Constitution prohibits Congress 
from restricting a particular Presidential 
action directly, it cannot use the appropria-
tion power to achieve the same unconstitu-
tional effect. Congress does have the power 
under the Constitution, however, to use ap-
propriations riders to prohibit the entire U.S. 
Government from spending any money, in-
cluding salaries, to provide covert or overt 
military support to the Contras. Thus, the 
Clark Amendment prohibiting all U.S. sup-
port for the Angolan Resistance in 1976 was 
constitutional. Some members of Congress 
who supported the Boland Amendment may 
have thought they were enacting a prohibi-
tion as broad as the Clark Amendment. The 
specific language of the Boland Amendment 
was considerably more restricted, however, 
in two respects. 
(a) By limiting the coverage to agen-
cies or entities involved in intelligence 
activities, Congress chose to use lan-
guage borrowed directly from the In-
telligence Oversight Act of 1980. In 
the course of settling on that language 
in 1980, Congress deliberately decided 
to exclude the National Security 
Council (NSC) from its coverage. At 
no time afterward did Congress indi-
cate an intention to change the lan-
guage's coverage. The NSC therefore 
was excluded from the Boland 
Amendment and its activities were 
therefore legal under this statute. 
(b) The Boland prohibitions also were 
limited to spending that directly or 
indirectly supported military or para-
military operations in Nicaragua. 
Under this language, a wide range of 
intelligence-gathering and political 
support activities were still permitted, 
and were carried out with the full 
knowledge of the House and Senate 
Intelligence Committees. 
(c) Virtually all, if not all, of the 
CIA's activities examined by these 
Committees occurred after the De-
cember 1985 law authorized intelli-
gence sharing and communications 
support and were fully legal under the 
terms of that law. 
(d) If the NSC had been covered by 
the Boland Amendments, most of 
Oliver North's activity still would 
have fallen outside the prohibitions 
for reasons stated in (b) and (c) above. 
Iran 
The Administration was also in substantial 
compliance with the laws governing covert 
actions throughout the Iran arms initiative. 
(1) It is possible to make a respectable 
legal argument to the effect that the 1985 
Israeli arms transfers to Iran technically vio-
lated the terms of the Arms Export Control 
Act (AECA) or Foreign Assistance Act 
(FAA), assuming the arms Israel transferred 
were received from the United States under 
one or the other of these statutes. However: 
(a) Covert transfers under the Na-
tional Security Act and Economy Act 
were understood to be alternatives to 
transfers under the AECA and FAA 
that met both of these latter acts' es-
sential purposes by including provi-
sions for Presidential approval and 
Congressional notification. 
(b) The requirement for U.S. agree-
ment before a country can retransfer 
arms obtained from the United States 
is meant to insure that retransfers con-
form to U.S. national interests. In this 
case, the Israeli retransfers occurred 
with Presidential approval indicating 
that they did so conform.

Chapter 1 
(c) The Israeli retransfer and subse-
quent replenishment made the deal es-
sentially equivalent to a direct U.S. 
sale, with Israel playing a role funda-
mentally equivalent to that of a mid-
dleman. Since the United States could 
obviously have engaged in a direct 
transfer, and did so in 1986, whatever 
violation may have occurred was, at 
most, a minor and inadvertent techni-
cality. 
(2) A verbal approval for covert transac-
tions meets the requirements of the Hughes-
Ryan Amendment and National Security 
Act. Verbal approvals ought to be reduced 
to writing as a matter of sound policy, but 
they are not illegal. 
(3) Similarly, the President has the consti-
tutional and statutory authority to withhold 
notifying Congress of covert activities under 
very rare conditions. President Reagan's de-
cision to withhold notification was essential-
ly equivalent to President Carter's decisions 
in 1979-1980 to withhold notice for between 
3 and 6 months in parallel Iran hostage oper-
ations. We do not agree with President Rea-
gan's decision to withhold notification for as 
452 
long as he did. The decision was legal, how-
ever, and we think the Constitution man-
dates that it should remain so. If a President 
withholds notification for too long and then 
cannot adequately justify the decision to 
Congress, that President can expect to pay a 
stiff political price, as President Reagan has 
certainly found out. 
Diversion 
We consider the ownership of the funds the 
Iranians paid to the Secord-Hakim "Enter-
prise" to be in legal doubt. There are re-
spectable legal arguments to be made both 
for the point of view that the funds belong 
to the U.S. Treasury and for the contention 
that they do not. If the funds do not belong 
to the United States, then the diversion 
amounted to third-country or private funds 
being shipped to the Contras. If they did 
belong to the United States, there would be 
legal questions (although not, technically, 
Boland Amendment questions) about using 
U.S.-owned funds for purposes not specifi-
cally approved by law. The answer does not 
seem to us to be so obvious, however, as to 
warrant treating the matter as if it were 
criminal.

Chapter 2 
The Foreign Affairs Powers and the Framers' 
Intentions 
Judgments about the Iran-Contra Affair ultimately 
must rest upon one's views about the proper roles of 
Congress and the President in foreign policy. There 
were many statements during the public hearings, for 
example, about the rule of law. But the fundamental 
law of the land is the Constitution. Unconstitutional 
statutes violate the rule of law every bit as much as 
do willful violations of constitutional statutes. It is 
essential, therefore, to frame any discussion of what 
happened with a proper analysis of the Constitutional 
allocation of legislative and executive power in for-
eign affairs. 
One point stands out from the historical record: the 
Constitution's Framers expected the President to be 
much more than a minister or clerk. The President 
was supposed to execute the laws, but that was only 
the beginning. He also was given important powers, 
independent of the legislature's, and these substantive-
ly were focused on foreign policy. 
Our analysis will cover three chapters. The first 
will be about the debates in and around the Constitu-
tional Convention of 1787 and will show the particu-
lar importance of what Alexander Hamilton called 
"energy in the executive" in this policy arena. The 
second reviews historical examples. It shows that, 
throughout the Nation's history, Congress has accept-
ed substantial exercises of Presidential power?in the 
conduct of diplomacy, the use of force and covert 
action?which had no basis in statute and only a gen-
eral basis in the Constitution itself. The third consid-
ers the applicable court cases and legal principles. 
Taken together, the three chapters will show that 
much of what President Reagan did in his actions 
toward Nicaragua and Iran were constitutionally pro-
tected exercises of inherent Presidential powers. How-
ever unwise some of those actions may have been, the 
rule of law cannot permit Congress to usurp judg-
ments that constitutionally are not its to make. It is 
true that the Constitution also gives substantial for-
eign policy powers to Congress, including the power 
of the purse. But the power of the purse?which 
forms the core of the majority argument?is not and 
was never intended to be a license for Congress to 
usurp Presidential powers and functions. Some of the 
statutes most central to the Iran-Contra Affair contain 
a mixture of constitutionally legitimate and illegit-
imate prohibitions. By the end of the three chapters, 
we will be in a position to start sorting them out. 
"Necessary and Proper" and the 
"Invitation to Struggle" 
In order to sort out constitutional from unconstitu-
tional exercises of power, however, one first must 
have a basis, or a set of principles, to guide the 
sorting. It is a commonplace to note that foreign 
policy was meant to be shared between the branches. 
The two branches' respective powers clearly were 
meant to overlap somewhat, with each branch having 
different means for addressing parallel policy issues. 
This overlap led the respected Presidential scholar, 
Edward S. Corwin, to describe the Constitution as 
"an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing 
American foreign policy." 1 
But to acknowledge the existence of a struggle is a 
far cry from seeing the Constitution as if it permits 
any branch to go after another's powers, without 
bounds. The boundless view of Congressional power 
began to take hold in the 1970's, in the wake of the 
Vietnam War. The 1972 Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee's report recommending the War Powers 
Act, and the 1974 report of the Select Committee on 
Intelligence Activities (chaired by Senator Frank 
Church and known as the Church Committee), both 
tried to support an all but unlimited Congressional 
power by invoking the "Necessary and Proper" 
clause. That clause says Congress may "make all 
Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carry-
ing into Execution the foregoing [legislative] Powers, 
and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in 
the Government of the United States, or in any De-
partment or Officer thereof" The argument of these 
two prominent committees was that by granting Con-
gress the power to make rules for the other depart-
ments, the Constitution meant to enshrine legislative 
supremacy except for those few activities explicitly 
reserved for the other branches.2 
One must ignore 200 years of constitutional history 
to suggest that Congress has a vast reservoir of im-
plied power whose only limits are the powers explicit-
ly reserved to the other branches. It seems clear, for 
example, that Congress could not legislate away the 
Supreme Court's power of judicial review, even 
457

Chapter 2 
though judicial review is not mentioned explicitly in 
Article III. The same applies to the Presidency. The 
Necessary and Proper clause does not permit Con-
gress to pass a law usurping Presidential power. A 
law negating Presidential power cannot be treated as 
if it were "necessary and proper for carrying" Presi-
dential powers "into Execution." To suggest other-
wise would smack of Orwellian Doublespeak. 
The issue for this investigation, therefore, is not 
whether Congress and the President both have a le-
gitimate role in foreign policy. Clearly, both do. 
Rather, the question is how to interpret the powers 
the two branches were given. All three of the Gov-
ernment's branches were given both express and im-
plied powers. Congress does not have the authority to 
arrogate all of the implied power to itself. What we 
need to determine is whether these implied powers all 
fall into an undefined war zone, or whether there are 
theoretical and historical principles that allow one to 
decide when powers are more properly exercised by 
one branch or another. 
Separation of Powers 
One commonly held, but mistaken view of the separa-
tion of powers sees its whole function as having been 
preventive. Justice Louis D. Brandeis, for example, 
wrote that the "doctrine of separation of powers was 
adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote 
efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary 
power." 3 His statement has been accepted in some 
Congressional quarters as if it holds the force of con-
ventional wisdom,4 but it misses half of the historical 
truth. 
The fallacy of Brandeis' statement becomes appar-
ent when one considers the defects of the U. S. Gov-
ernment before the Constitution. The Constitutional 
Convention, among other things, was taking the exec-
utive from being under the legislature's thumb, not 
the legislature from being under the executive's. After 
suffering through the Articles of Confederation (and 
various state constitutions) that had overcompensated 
for monarchy, the 1787 delegates wanted to empower 
a government, not enfeeble it. Brandeis was partly 
right to point out that the Framers did not want 
power to be used arbitrarily, and that checks and 
balances were among the means used to guard against 
arbitrariness. But the principles underlying separation 
had to do with increasing the Government's power as 
much as with checking it.5 
For the Government to overcome the Articles' 
problems, the executive and judiciary had to act, di-
rectly upon citizens throughout the far-flung new 
nation. As Charles Thach said in his classic study, 
"the delegates' chief concern was thus to secure an 
executive strong enough, not one weak enough." 6 
The delegates did not want a monarchy, but felt they 
had no reason to fear such a threat as long as Mem-
bers of Congress retained their independent political 
458 
connection to the people. The problem was to make 
sure the other branches were not drawn, to use James 
Madison's word, into the legislature's "vortex." 7 
Constitutional Convention 
The need for a strong Executive was not seen or 
articulated clearly at the beginning of the Constitu-
tional Convention by all of the delegates. On June 1, 
1787, in the first debate on the subject, Connecticut's 
Roger Sherman said "he considered the Executive 
magistracy as nothing more than an institution for 
carrying the will of the Legislature into effect." 8 For 
that reason, Sherman supported the original Virginia 
Plan's provisions for the office. As submitted on the 
first day of the convention's substantive business on 
May 29, these included election by the legislature, no 
reeligibility for reelection and a short list of powers. 
The Presidency grew considerably in stature be-
tween June 1 and September 17, the convention's last 
day. The leading strong Executive proponents, includ-
ing James Wilson of Pennsylvania and Gouverneur 
Morris of New York, persuaded their colleagues to 
borrow key provisions from the New York State 
Constitution, whose independently powerful governor 
stood out from the much weaker executives in the 
other states. By the time the convention had finished, 
the Presidency (like the governorship of New York) 
was to be unified in one person who had an electoral 
base independent from the legislature's, who was al-
lowed to run for reelection and who was given a 
qualified veto over legislative bills. With those 
changes in place, the delegates insured that the Presi-
dency would not be the subservient clerkship original-
ly envisioned by Sherman. 
The President's enumerated powers were not dis-
cussed until the second half of the Constitutional Con-
vention. For a week after the July 16 Great Compro-
mise on legislative representation, the delegates debat-
ed the Presidency without reaching final conclusions. 
On July 26, they recessed to let a Committee of 
Detail work on a draft Constitution. At this point, the 
convention had only given the President the power to 
enforce laws, appoint officers, and exercise a qualified 
veto over legislation. 
The Committee of Detail's report of August 6 listed 
specific powers for all three branches, significantly 
expanding the ones for the President. To the ones 
listed on July 26, the committee added the ability to 
recommend legislation, to receive ambassadors, to 
communicate with other heads of state and to act as 
commander in chief.9 
Beyond these powers, however, the committee did 
not yet see the President as being preeminent in for-
eign policy. Reflecting the stake that small state dele-
gates felt they had in the Senate, the committee gave 
the Senate the power to make treaties and appoint

Chapter 2 
ambassadors and judges, and gave the full Congress 
the power to make war. 
Over the next several weeks, all of these foreign 
policy decisions were modified to increase the Presi-
dent's power. On August 17, "Mr. Madison and Mr. 
Gerry moved to insert 'declare', striking out [Con-
gress's power to] 'make' war; leaving the Executive 
the power to repel sudden attacks." 10 This sentence 
is sometimes read by advocates of Congressional 
power as if the President was to be left only with the 
power to repel sudden attacks." The next sentence 
muddies this interpretation substantially, however. 
Roger Sherman?the same delegate who was so suspi-
cious of Executive power?said he would oppose the 
change because he interpreted it to mean the Presi-
dent was being given the power "to commence war." 
Oliver Ellsworth joined Sherman's reasoning, and 
Madison's notes (much skimpier for September than 
earlier) made George Mason's remarks inscrutable." 
The motion was adopted, but an honest reading of 
these contradictory interpretations compels the con-
clusion that the scope of Executive power on this 
point was not settled. The President clearly was being 
given some discretion to use force without a declara-
tion of war, but how much would have to be worked 
out in subsequent practice. 
The treaty power was debated on August 23, but 
left unresolved." On September 4, a Committee of 
Eleven reported a provision that said, "the President 
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, 
shall have power to make Treaties; and he shall nomi-
nate and by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate shall appoint ambassadors", other public Min-
isters, judges and other officers not otherwise provid-
ed for in the Constitution. The votes of two-thirds of 
the Senators present were to be needed to ratify a 
treaty." The provision for treaties was adopted with 
little recorded debate on September 7. James Wilson 
did move to require ratification to be shared by the 
House of Representatives, but the motion was defeat-
ed 1-10 after Sherman said "the necessity of secrecy 
in the case of treaties forbade a reference of them to 
the whole Legislature." 15 The delegates reduced the 
two-thirds requirement for advice and consent to a 
simple majority for treaties of peace, but reversed 
themselves the next day." As with the war power, 
shifting the power to make treaties away from the 
Senate clearly was meant to expand the President's 
role?this time to take the lead in international negoti-
ations. This expansion would parallel the President's 
sole authority to receive ambassadors and his author-
ity to nominate ambassadors with advice and consent 
of the Senate. Once again, however, the exact scope 
of the relationship implied by the treaty power was 
left to be worked out in practice. 
The Federalist Analysis of Political 
Principles 
Although the convention left a great deal unsettled, 
that does not mean the Framers considered the distri-
bution of foreign policy powers to be unimportant. 
"Problems of security and diplomacy were among the 
dominant preoccupations of the men who met at 
Philadelphia," wrote one legal scholar, "and first 
among their arguments for Union." 17 John Jay's four 
papers on foreign affairs come first in the Federalist 
and more than half of the papers in one way or 
another involve national security or foreign policy. In 
fact, one of the main differences between Federalists 
and Anti-Federalists during the whole ratification 
period turned on the Federalists' insistence that a 
strong national government was needed to meet for-
eign threats." So the issues were aired at some 
length. 
If we begin with the discussions about governmen-
tal institutions that were not specifically focused on 
foreign policy, we can see that there were some prin-
ciples underlying the way powers were allocated to 
the various branches of government. There was some 
overlap, to be sure. "Unless these departments be so 
far connected and blended, as to give each a constitu-
tional controul over the others," Madison wrote in 
Federalist No. 48, no checking or balancing could 
occur." But the core of each branch's power cen-
tered upon tasks it was supposed to be best suited to 
perform.2? 
The primary concern the Framers had for the Con-
gress was to create a body whose members?naturally 
concerned with the immediate concerns of their own 
districts?would be encouraged to debate and deliber-
ate in the name of the national interest.21 If delibera-
tion was the key word for designing the legislature, 
energy, the ability to act, was the central concept for 
the Presidency. In describing the delegates' decision 
to have a single Executive and a numerous legislature, 
Alexander Hamilton wrote: "They have, with great 
propriety, considered energy as the most necessary 
qualification in the former, and have regarded this as 
most applicable to power in a single hand; while they 
have, with equal propriety, considered the latter as 
best adapted to deliberation." 22 
The need for an effective foreign policy, it turned 
out, was one of the main reasons the country needs an 
"energetic government," according to Alexander 
Hamilton in Federalist Nos. 22 and 23. Madison made 
the same point in No. 37: "Energy in Government is 
essential to that security against external and internal 
danger, and to that prompt and salutary execution of 
the laws, which enter into the very definition of good 
Government." 23 The relevance of these observations 
about the government's power is that the Framers saw 
energy as being primarily an executive branch charac-
teristic.

Chapter 2 
Energy is the main theme of Federalist No. 70 
("energy in the executive is a leading character in the 
definition of good government.") It is said to be im-
portant primarily when "decision, activity, secrecy, 
and dispatch" were needed. These features are "essen-
tial to the protection of the community against for-
eign attacks." "In the conduct of war . . . the energy 
of the executive is the bulwark of national securi-
ty." 24 
But war was not the only aspect of foreign policy 
described as being more appropriate for the executive 
than legislative branch. "The actual conduct of for-
eign negotiations, . . . the arrangement of the army 
and navy, the direction of the operations of war; these 
and other matters of a like nature constitute what 
seems to be most properly understood by the adminis-
tration of government." 25 On negotiations, Hamilton 
went further to say that the Executive is "the most fit 
agent" for "foreign negotiations." 26 
In all of the quotations above, the Federalist was 
not treating powers as if they were randomly distrib-
uted. "Separated powers are not separated arbitrar-
ily," writes one constitutional scholar.27 "They are 
divided on principle, and not according to the pru-
dential considerations of the moment," concludes an-
other." The responsibilities given each branch were 
the ones most suited to its composition. Activities 
requiring discussion and deliberation formed the heart 
of the legislature's job; those calling for "decision, 
activity, secrecy and dispatch" were the heart of the 
Executive's. The distribution of these characteristics 
among the branches would not by itself settle a dis-
pute over the separation of powers. One could not, 
for example, challenge the existence of Congressional 
intelligence committees by saying that the Federalist 
called secrecy more of an Executive than a legislative 
trait. The analysis does show, however, that the 
Framers had solid reasons for placing the deployment 
and use of force (but not declarations of war), togeth-
er with negotiations, intelligence gathering," and 
other diplomatic communications (but not treaty rati-
fication) at the center of the President's foreign policy 
460 
powers. The principles underlying this distribution of 
powers should therefore be respected in constitutional 
interpretation, except where there are compelling rea-
sons to suppose the Framers intended a different 
result. 
We would be remiss if we failed to note that Feder-
alist No. 70 gave two reasons for supporting unity in 
the Executive. So far, our discussion has concentrated 
on the first: the need for energy in the Executive. No 
government, democratic or otherwise, could long sur-
vive unless its Executive could respond to the uncer-
tainties of international relations. But energy in the 
Executive seemed frightening to some people. To 
them, the Federalists made two responses. The first 
was that the Executive could not maintain a standing 
army, equip a navy, or engage in a large-scale use of 
force, without spending appropriated funds provided 
and controlled by the Congress.3? 
The second was that an independent, single Execu-
tive?in addition to being more energetic?would also 
be more responsible politically. It would be much 
easier to hold one person accountable than a commit-
tee." In other words, giving the President some inde-
pendent, inherent power was not seen as being un-
democratic. The President and Congress both were 
considered to be representatives of the people. The 
Congress produced a more fitting result when the 
primary need was to moderate internal factional de-
mands through discussion and deliberation before pro-
ducing general rules. But foreign policy is dominated 
by case-by-case decisions, not general rules, and the 
aim is not to moderate internal pressures through de-
liberation, but to respond to external ones quickly and 
decisively. For these kinds of situations, multiple 
bodies?like Congress?are inherently unable to 
accept blame or responsibility for mistakes. Thus, de-
spite the majority's contentions to the contrary, put-
ting such decisions in the hands of the Congress was 
considered to be less democratic than giving them to 
the President, because there would be no way for the 
people to hold any one person accountable for a legis-
lative decision.

Chapter 3 
The President's Foreign Policy Powers in 
Early Constitutional History 
Our review of the Constitutional Convention conclud-
ed that the original document left a great deal to be 
worked out in practice. The Federalist does not 
change this conclusion. It does give us a theoretical 
basis, however, for seeing that the subsequent histori-
cal development of the President's foreign policy 
powers was no aberration. This is evident in the early 
development of diplomatic power, in presidential de-
ployments of force, and in the use of secret agents for 
intelligence and covert activities. 
Diplomacy 
The major uncertainties affecting the President's abili-
ty to hold the initiative in negotiations and diplomatic 
communications were settled early. The President's 
role as the "sole organ" 1 of international communica-
tions was asserted unequivocally on October 9, 1789, 
when George Washington answered a letter that the 
King of France had addressed "to the President and 
Members of the General Congress" by saying that the 
task of receiving and answering such letters "has de-
volved upon me." Washington's interpretation was 
not based on the explicit words of Article II. Con-
firming this assertion, the Senate twice rejected mo-
tions to request the President to communicate mes-
sages on behalf of the United States.2 
The related issue of whether the President may be 
required to give all requested information to Congress 
arose in a variety of foreign policy contexts during 
the Washington Administration. According to Abra-
ham Sofaer's definitive study of the first forty years' 
practice under the Constitution, Washington repeated-
ly asserted, and Congress just as repeatedly accepted, 
a presidential right to withhold information the Presi-
dent thought should be kept secret. In 1794, for exam-
ple, the Senate requested copies of the correspond-
ence between our ambassador to France and the 
French Republic. Attorney General William Bradford 
wrote that "it is the duty of the Executive to with-
hold such parts of the said correspondence as in the 
judgment of the Executive shall be deemed unsafe 
and improper to be disclosed." Washington's response 
to the Senate clearly indicated that he was withhold-
ing some material, but the Senate took no further 
action.3 
A year later, the Senate asked President Washing-
ton for John Jay's negotiating instructions and dis-
patches relating to the controversial Jay Treaty, "the 
first truly significant treaty completed under the new 
Constitution." 4 The issue here had to do not with the 
President's right to be the sole negotiator of treaties, 
but with what information Congress could insist on, 
after the fact, as a matter of right. Despite some 
advice to the contrary within his cabinet, Washington 
decided to give all requested information to the 
Senate. Thomas Jefferson, Washington's Secretary of 
State, made it clear later, however, that he considered 
the decision to have been a matter of political pru-
dence rather than an acquiescence in a Senatorial 
right of advance consultation.5 
When it was time for the House to consider imple-
menting legislation for the Jay Treaty, Washington 
refused the same information?an action that pro-
voked more than 300 pages of debate in the Annals of 
Congress. The President said he was refusing the re-
quest because the House had no role in ratifying trea-
ties. The Cabinet, however, had also discussed a 
second reason for refusing to answer: the President's 
inherent power to decide what could, with safety, be 
shared. In a subsequent House debate, James Madison 
argued that the President should not be allowed to 
judge what was in the House's power, but supported 
the idea that the President could withhold papers if 
"in his judgment, it might not be consistent with the 
interest of the United States at this time to disclose." 
In other words, Madison was saying that each branch 
was the proper judge of its own constitutional 
powers. According to Sofaer, the debate showed 
"that members widely shared the view that the Presi-
dent had discretion to decline to furnish information 
requested. . . . Only one member . . . claimed that 
the House had an absolute right to obtain information it 
sought." 6 
In addition to negotiating treaties, and sharing in-
formation about them with Congress, there was a 
major dispute during the Washington Administration 
about subsequent interpretation and implementation. 
After war broke out between France and England in 
1793, Washington decided to issue his famous Procla-
mation of Neutrality. Public sentiment was in favor of 
having the United States support France, a course

Chapter 3 
that arguably would have been consistent with a 1778 
Treaty of Alliance between the United States and 
France. Washington was convinced, however, that 
taking sides in the war would be disastrous. He took 
the position that it was up to him, as President, to 
interpret the country's treaty obligations when he felt 
those obligations did not require him to ask Congress 
for a declaration of war. For eight months, Washing-
ton implemented his policy without asking Congress 
to convene for a special session. 
One of the truly remarkable aspects of the decision 
was that, in addition to its assertion of the President's 
unilateral power to set policy, Washington claimed 
that he could use military force, if necessary, to pre-
vent violations of the policy outside the United States 
by privateers and by people who helped outfit them, 
and that he could treat violations within the United 
States as criminal acts under the common law. Al-
though unrelated concerns about common law crimes 
and the difficulty of winning jury convictions led to 
the first Congressional Neutrality Act, there was 
never any doubt about Washington's authority to en-
force his policy of neutrality abroad. 
Washington's proclamation also occasioned one of 
the great public debates over executive power in the 
Nation's history. About two and a half months after 
the proclamation, Hamilton published the first of a 
series of papers under the pseudonym of Pacificus. 
The main constitutional issue of the day was whether 
Congress' power to declare war carried with it the 
power to declare peace, or to determine whether U.S. 
treaty obligations with France required supporting 
that country in its war with England. Hamilton 
argued that these powers must "of necessity belong to 
the Executive Department." 7 His reasoning was as 
follows: 
It appears to be connected to that department in 
various capacities, as the organ of intercourse be-
tween the Nation and foreign Nations?as the 
interpreter of the National Treaties in those cases 
in which the Judiciary is not competent, that is 
between Government and Government?as that 
Power, which is charged with the Execution of 
the Laws, of which treaties form a part?as that 
Power which is charged with the application of 
the Public Force. 
That view of the subject is so natural and obvi-
ous?so analogous to general theory and prac-
tice?that no doubt can be entertained of its just-
ness, unless such doubt can be deduced from 
particular provisions of the Constitution.8 
At this point, Hamilton turned his attention to the 
texts of Articles I and II, and particularly to the 
general clauses introducing each of them. 
The second Article of the Constitution of the 
United States, section 1st, establishes this general 
464 
Proposition, That "The EXECUTIVE POWER 
shall be vested in a President of the United States 
of America." 
The same article in a succeeding Section pro-
ceeds to designate particular cases of Executive 
Power. . . . 
It would not consist with the rules of sound 
construction to consider this enumeration of par-
ticular authorities as derogating from the more 
comprehensive grant contained in the general 
clause, further than as it may be coupled with 
express restrictions or qualifications . . . . Be-
cause the difficulty of a complete and perfect 
specification of all the cases of Executive author-
ity would naturally dictate the use of general 
terms?and would render it improbable that a 
specification of particulars was designed as a sub-
stitute for those terms, when antecedently used. 
The different mode of expression employed in the 
constitution in regard to the two powers the Leg-
islative and the Executive serves to confirm this 
inference. In the article which grants the legisla-
tive powers of the Governt. the expressions are?
"All Legislative powers herein granted shall be 
vested in a Congress of the United States;" in that 
which grants the Executive Power the expres-
sions are, as already quoted, "The EXECUTIVE 
PO[WER] shall be vested in a President of the 
United States of America". . . . 
The general doctrine then of our constitution is 
that the EXECUTIVE POWER of the Nation is 
vested in the President; subject only to the excep-
tions and qu[a]lifications which are expressed in 
the instrument . . . . 
This mode of construing the Constitution has 
indeed been recognized by Congress in formal 
acts, upon full consideration and debate. The 
power of removal from office is an important 
instance.8 
Thomas Jefferson, Washington's Secretary of State, 
joined the other members of the Cabinet in supporting 
the President's proclamation. He became upset, how-
ever, at Pacificus' arguments for executive power, 
and urged his friend, James Madison, to write a reply. 
The results were published under the pseudonym of 
Helvidius. 
To see the laws faithfully executed constitutes 
the essence of the executive authority. But what 
relation does it have to the power of making 
treaties and war, that is, of determining what the 
laws shall be with regard to other nations? 
By whatever standard we try this doctrine, it 
must be condemned as no less vicious in theory 
than it would be dangerous in practice . . . .

Chapter 3 
Whence can the writer have borrowed it? 
There is but one answer to this question. 
The power of making treaties and the power of 
declaring war, are royal prerogatives in the British 
government, and are accordingly treated as execu-
tive prerogatives by British commentators. 10 
Interestingly, a letter Madison wrote to Jefferson 
shows that he was extremely reluctant to take on the 
task." On an earlier occasion when he was support-
ing the removal power, Madison had described the 
executive power in terms much closer to Hamilton's. 
The constitution affirms that the executive power 
shall be vested in the president. Are there excep-
tions to this proposition? Yes, there are. The con-
stitution says that, in appointing to office, the 
senate shall be associated with the president, 
unless in the case of inferior officers, when the 
law shall otherwise direct. Have we [in Congress] 
a right to extend this exception? I believe not. If 
the constitution has invested all the executive 
power in the president, I venture to assert, that 
the legislature has no right to diminish or modify 
his executive authority." 
Whatever one may want to say about Madison's 
narrow construction of Presidential power in the role 
of Helvidius, there can be little doubt that the history 
of the years and decades immediately following 
Washington's assertions of broad power, developed 
more along lines envisioned by Pacificus. Sofaer's 
review of the Washington administration ended by 
observing that "the framework for executive-congres-
sional relations developed during the first eight years 
differs more in degree than in kind from the present 
framework." 13 At least as important as the first eight 
years, however, was the fact that this framework was 
maintained by Jefferson and his successors, despite 
their public identification during the years the Feder-
alists held power with the Helvidius view of the Presi-
dency. 
One constitutional dispute early in the Jefferson 
Administration was over the Louisiana Purchase. 
What would the party whose adherents had insisted 
on a Senate role in negotiating the Jay Treaty say 
about the President's power to negotiate the Pur-
chase? Jefferson's Secretary of State Albert Gallatin 
supported the Louisiana Purchase by saying that the 
purchase eventually would have to be ratified by 
treaty and that its negotiation therefore belonged to 
the President under the Constitution. Jefferson did not 
embrace Gallatin's constitutional argument. Instead, 
the President decided to go through with the Pur-
chase, without abandoning his view that the Constitu-
tion severely limited the President, by asserting an 
inherent, extraconstitutional prerogative power for the 
Executive that was more sweeping than anything 
Hamilton had ever put forward. Jefferson justified his 
decision this way: 
A strict observance of the written law is doubt-
less one of the high duties of a good citizen, but 
it is not the highest. The laws of necessity, of 
self-preservation, of saving our country when in 
danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our 
country by a scrupulous adherence to written 
law, would be to lose the law itself . . . absurdly 
sacrificing the end to the means." 
One of the remarkable aspects of Jefferson's asser-
tion is the stark way in which it poses a fundamental 
constitutional issue. Chief Executives are given the 
responsibility for acting to respond to crises or emer-
gencies. To the extent that the Constitution and laws 
are read narrowly, as Jefferson wished, the Chief Ex-
ecutive will on occasion feel duty bound to assert 
monarchical notions of prerogative that will permit 
him to exceed the law. Paradoxically, the broader 
Hamiltonian ideas about executive power?by being 
more attuned to the realistic dangers of foreign 
policy?seem more likely to produce an Executive 
who is able and willing to live within legal bound-
aries. Thus, the constitutional construction that on the 
surface looks more dangerous seems on reflection to 
be safer in the long run. 
After Jefferson, the notion of executive prerogative 
was put on the shelf. Instead, Jeffersonian Presidents 
began asserting Hamiltonian ideas about executive 
power. Although we will discuss the use of force 
separately below, Sofaer's comment on the post-Jef-
fersonians bears quotation here: 
Although Presidents during this period claimed 
no inherent authority to initiate military actions, 
Madison [departing from the theory of the Helvi-
dius papers] and particularly Monroe secretly 
used their powers in ways that could have been 
justified only by some sweeping and vague 
claim?such as the right to use the armed forces 
to advance the interests of the United States." 
The reason such inherent presidential power was 
exercised in this period, and later, was not mysterious. 
The exercise grew out of the character of foreign 
policy and of the offices the Constitution had created. 
As Gary Schmitt put it in an article about Jefferson: 
To some extent, the enumerated powers found in 
Article II are deceiving in that they appear un-
derstated. By themselves, they do not explain the 
particular primacy the presidency has had in the 
governmental system since 1789. What helps to 
explain this fact is the presidency's radically dif-
ferent institutional characteristics, especially its 
unity of office. Because of its unique features, it 
enjoys?as the framers largely intended?the ca-
pacity of acting with the greatest expedition, se-

crecy and effective knowledge. As a result, when 
certain stresses, particularly in the area of foreign 
affairs, are placed on the nation, it will "natural-
ly" rise to the forefront." 
These stresses are particularly evident when it is time 
to use force or engage in secret diplomacy or covert 
actions. 
We close this section on diplomacy by relating it to 
some of the issues of the Iran-Contra investigation. 
Some Members of these Committees seem to have 
taken the positions (1) that Congress can require the 
President to notify it whenever the President prepares 
or begins to conduct secret negotiations or covert 
operations, whatever the circumstances, and/or (2) 
that Congress may constitutionally use its appropria-
tions power to prohibit certain forms of communica-
tion between the President (or the President's employ-
ees in the White House and State Department) and 
other governments or private individuals. We consid-
er negotiations and communications with foreign gov-
ernments or individuals to be Presidential powers pro-
tected by the Constitution, without reservation. They 
fall comfortably within precedents established during 
the Washington Administration which have never 
been successfully challenged since. The constitutional 
validity of withholding information about sensitive, 
covert operations involves additional considerations 
that will be discussed separately later. 
Use of Force 
We do not intend to turn this report into an argument 
about war powers. We have no doubt that we dis-
agree with some of our esteemed colleagues on this 
issue, but there is no point in getting sidetracked. 
Nevertheless, we consider it important to say some-
thing about the power Presidents traditionally have 
exercised under the Constitution, to use force with 
and without prior congressional authorization. This 
history clearly supports our basic contention that the 
Constitution expected the President to be much more 
than a clerk. It will also provide a context for discuss-
ing the less drastic projections of U.S. power that fit 
under the rubric of covert action. 
In its 1973 hearings on the War Powers Resolution, 
the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on National 
Security Policy and Scientific Developments pub-
lished a list of 199 U.S. military hostilities which 
occurred abroad without a declaration of war.17 (The 
five declarations of war in the Nation's history were 
for the War of 1812, Mexican War, Spanish-American 
War, World War I, and World War II.) The list was 
a revision of one published the year before in a law 
review article by J.T. Emerson." Of the 199 listed 
actions, only 81 could be said under any stretch of the 
imagination to have been initiated under prior legisla-
tive authority. The 81 included 51 undertaken under 
treaties, many of which left substantial room for inter-
466 
pretation. In addition, many of the remaining actions 
were undertaken with only the vaguest statutory au-
thority. President Jefferson's five-year campaign 
against the Barbary States, for example, was justified 
by the claim that Congress' general decision to pro-
vide a navy carried with it the authority to deploy 
the navy whereever the President wished, including a 
theater in which the President had every reason to 
expect hostilities. 
The point here is not to quibble about the 81 occa-
sions the subcommittee described as having had prior 
congressional authorization. Rather, it is to show that 
the list made every effort to include all examples for 
which some kind of prior congressional authorization 
could arguably have been claimed. That leaves an 
extremely conservative number of 118 other occasions 
without prior legislative authorization. What follows 
is a sampler of the 118 actions taken solely on execu-
tive authority. The descriptive language below is 
paraphrased from the subcommittee exhibit cited 
above. 
?In 1810, Governor Claiborne of Louisiana, on the 
sole order of the President, used troops to occupy 
disputed territory east of the Mississippi. 
?During the "First Seminole War," 1816-18, U.S. 
forces invaded Spanish Florida on two occasions. In 
the first action they destroyed a Spanish fort. In the 
second they attacked hostile Seminole Indians, occu-
pying Spanish posts believed to have served as 
havens. President Monroe assumed responsibility for 
these acts. 
?In 1818, the U.S.S. Ontario landed at the Colum-

also claimed by Russia and Spain. 
?In 1844, President Tyler deployed forces to pro-
tect Texas against Mexico, anticipating Senate ap-
proval of a treaty of annexation. The treaty was later 
rejected. 
?In 1846, President Polk ordered General Scott to 
occupy disputed territory months before a declaration 
of war. The troops engaged in battle when Mexican 
forces entered the area between the Nueces and Rio 
Grande Rivers. The fighting occurred three days 
before Congress acted. 
?In 1853-54, Commodore Matthew C. Perry led 
an expedition to Japan to negotiate a commercial 
treaty. Four hundred armed men accompanied Perry 
and landed with him at Edo Bay in July, 1853, where 
he stayed ten days after being told to leave. He then 
sailed south and took possession of the Bonin Islands. 
In March 1854, he returned to Edo Bay with 10 ships 
and 2,000 men. He landed with 500 men and signed a 
treaty after a six-week campaign. The whole cam-
paign was on executive authority. 
?In late 1865, General Sherman was sent to the 
Mexican border with 50,000 troops to back up the 
protest made by Secretary of State Seward to Napole-
on III that the presence of 25,000 French troops in

Mexico "is a serious concern." The troops remained 
until February 1866, when Seward demanded a defi-
nite date for French withdrawal and France com-
plied. 
?In 1869-71, President Grant sent a naval force to 
the Dominican Republic to protect it from invasion 
while the Senate considered a treaty of annexation. 
The Senate rejected the treaty, but the naval force 
stayed in place for months afterwards. 
?Between 1874 and 1915, U.S. forces were put 
ashore on 29 different occasions to protect American 
lives or interests in places as diverse as Hawaii, 
Mexico, Egypt, Korea, Argentina, Chile, Nicaragua, 
China, Colombia (Panama), Dominican Republic, 
Syria, Abyssinia, Morocco, Honduras, Turkey and 
Haiti. 
?Between 1915 and 1934, the United States placed 
Haiti under U.S. military and financial administration. 
The occupation was sanctioned by a treaty ratified by 
the Senate in February 1916, but the first months of 
the occupation were on Executive authority. 
?In February 1917, President Wilson asked Con-
gress for authority to arm U.S. merchant vessels. 
Congress refused and Wilson acted on his own au-
thority to provide the ships with guns. 
?In 1918-20, after signing the Armistice for World 
War I, U.S. troops participated in Allied anti-Bolshe-
vik military actions in Russia. 
?Between 1926 and 1933, 5,000 U.S. troops were 
in Nicaragua at the request of the government during 
the period of Sandino's attempted revolution. Con-
gressional Democrats opposed President Coolidge's 
decisions but did not question his authority. 
?On September 3, 1940, President Roosevelt in-
formed Congress that he had agreed to deliver a 
flotilla of destroyers to Great Britain in return for a 
series of military bases on British soil along the West-
ern Atlantic. 
?In April 1941, after the German invasion of Den-
mark, the U.S. Army occupied Greenland under 
agreement with local authorities. The action appears 
to have been contrary to an express congressional 
limitation. 
?On July 7, 1941, U.S. troops occupied Iceland. 
Congress was notified the same day but was not con-
sulted in advance. The Reserves Act of 1940 and the 
Selective Service Act of 1940 both provided that U.S. 
troops could not be used outside the Western Hemi-
sphere. 
?By July 7, 1941, President Roosevelt had ordered 
U.S. warships to convoy supplies sent to Europe to 
protect military aid to Britain and Russia. By Septem-
ber, the ships were attacking German submarines. 
?In July 1946, during an Italian-Yugoslav border 
dispute in the Trieste area, President Truman ordered 
U.S. Naval units to the scene. After the Yugoslays 
shot down U.S. transport planes in August, Truman 
ordered U.S. troops and air forces to be augmented. 
Five thousand U.S. troops remained in Trieste as late 
as 1948. 
?Between 1948 and 1960, U.S. forces were de-
ployed to evacuate, protect or be ready to protect 
U.S. lives in or near Palestine, China, Egypt, Indone-
sia, Venezuela, and Cuba. 
?In October 1962, President Kennedy ordered a 
naval "quarantine" of Cuba during the Cuban Missile 
Crisis. 
?On April 24, 1965, a revolt broke out in the 
Dominican Republic, and on April 28 President John-
son sent American troops. The announced purpose 
was to protect American lives. At the peak of the 
action, 21,500 U.S. troops were in the Dominican 
Republic. An Inter-American Peace Force began ar-
riving on May 21 and stayed through the year. 
?On September 17, 1970, King Hussein of Jordan 
moved against the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Syria sent 300 tanks across the Jordanian border and 
President Nixon ordered the United States Sixth Fleet 
to deploy off the Lebanese-Israeli coast. The United 
States apparently was prepared to intervene to pre-
vent Hussein's overthrow. Syrian tanks began with-
drawing on September 22 and Hussein and PLO 
leader Yassir Arafat agreed to a cease-fire on Septem-
ber 25. 
As should be obvious from all of these examples, 
Presidents from the earliest history of the United 
States have not limited themselves to a Roger Sher-
man-like limited conception of their job. Neither have 
they felt, as they have deployed force without con-
gressional authorization, that their actions had to be 
limited to hot pursuit, repelling attacks or protecting 
American lives. Until recently, the Congress did not 
even question the President's authority. 
The relevance of these repeated examples of the 
extensive use of armed force, therefore, is that they 
indicate how far the President's inherent powers were 
assumed to have reached when Congress was silent, 
and even, in some cases, where Congress had prohib-
ited an action. We shall show later that most of the 
Reagan Administration's actions in Central America 
in fact were not covered by statute. They therefore 
fall constitutionally under the heading of unauthor-
ized, but also unprohibited actions. As shown above, 
Presidents historically have had not only the power 
to negotiate and communicate, but also to deploy 
force overtly?sometimes for major campaigns in-
volving significant losses of life?without Congres-
sional approval. The Reagan Administration did not 
even come remotely close to this level of activity in 
its support of the democratic resistance in Nicaragua. 
Intelligence and Covert Actions 
We end this review of historical precedent with a 
brief overview of intelligence and covert actions au-
thorized by past Presidents. That history begins in the

Chapter 3 
earliest days of the Nation. As Representative Hyde 
mentioned during Admiral Poindexter's testimony on 
July 17," the Continental Congress?which did not 
have a separate executive branch?set up a Commit-
tee of Secret Correspondence made up of Benjamin 
Franklin, Robert Morris, Benjamin Harrison, John 
Dickinson and John Jay. On October 1, 1776, Frank-
lin and Morris were told that France would be will-
ing to extend credit to the revolutionaries to help 
them buy arms. They wrote: 
Considering the nature and importance of [the 
above intelligence,] we agree in opinion that it is 
our indispensable duty to keep it a secret from 
Congress. . . . As the court of France has taken 
measures to negotiate this loan in the most cau-
tious and secret manner, should we divulge it 
immediately we may not only lose the present 
benefit but also render the court cautious of any 
further connection with such unguarded people 
and prevent their granting other loans of assist-
ance that we stand in need of.2? 
In a subsequent chapter on leaks, we shall discuss 
the methods this committee used to protect secrets, 
some of which should be revived today. 
The Federalist also recognized the important role 
intelligence might play under the new Constitution. 
Federalist No. 64, about treaties, was written by Jay, 
an experienced diplomat as well as a former member 
of the Committee on Secret Correspondence. He said: 
It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, 
of whatever nature, but that perfect secrecy and 
immediate dispatch are sometimes requisite. There 
are cases when the most useful intelligence may 
be obtained, if the person possessing it can be 
relieved from apprehensions of discovery. Those 
apprehensions will operate on those persons 
whether they are actuated by mercenary or 
friendly motives; and there are doubtless many of 
both descriptions who would rely on the secrecy 
of the President, but who would not confide in 
that of the Senate, and still less in that of a large 
popular assembly. The convention have done 
well therefore in so disposing of the power of 
making treaties, that although the President must 
in forming them act by the advice and consent of 
the senate, yet he will be able to manage the 
business of intelligence in such manner as pru-
dence may suggest.2' 
Beginning with George Washington, almost every 
President has used "special agents"?people, often 
private individuals, appointed for missions by the 
President without Senate confirmation?to help gain 
the intelligence about which Jay wrote, and to engage 
in a broad range of other activities with or against 
foreign countries. The first such agent was Gouver-
neur Morris, who was sent to Great Britain in 1789 to 
468 
explore the chances for opening normal diplomatic 
communications.22 At the same time, Britain sent a 
"private agent" to the United States who communi-
cated outside normal channels through Secretary of 
Treasury Alexander Hamilton instead of through the 
Francophile Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson." 
Washington's agents were paid from a "secret serv-
ice" fund he was allowed to use at his discretion, 
without detailed accounting. 24 
The early examples that are most interesting for 
these investigations are ones in which the President 
used his discretionary power to authorize covert ac-
tions. ("Covert action" is an inexact term generally 
recognized to include covert political action, covert 
propaganda, intelligence deception, and covert para-
military assistance.) In the period of 1810-12, for ex-
ample, Madison used agents to stimulate revolts in 
East and West Florida that eventually led to an overt, 
Congressionally unauthorized military force to gain 
U.S. control over territories held by a country with 
which the United States was at peace. Even more 
telling, however, is the following example from the 
Madison Administration. 
Madison [in 1810] sent Joel R. Poinsett, secretly 
and without Senate approval, to South America 
as an agent for seamen and commerce. Poinsett 
did some commercial work, but he broadly con-
strued instructions from Secretaries of State 
Smith and Monroe, and worked intimately with 
revolutionary leaders in Argentina and Chile, 
suggesting commercial and military plans, helping 
them obtain arms, and actually leading a division 
of the Chilean army against Peruvian loyalists. 
Nothing in Poinsett's instructions specifically au-
thorized these activities. But he had kept the ad-
ministration advised of most of his plans and re-
ceived virtually no directions for long periods of 
time, and no orders to refrain in any way from 
aiding the revolutionaries . . . . Poinsett was 
given broad leeway to advance the republican 
cause, without any commitment from the admin-
istration. He was told to write in code, and all his 
important communications were withheld from 
Congress.22 
In other words, Poinsett made Oliver North look 
like a piker. 
In 1843, President Tyler secretly sent Duff Green 
to Great Britain to engage in secret propaganda ac-
tivities relating to the U.S. desire to annex Texas. At 
one point, Green had a letter published in a newspa-
per without using his own name. This raised a furor 
among members of Congress, several of whom de-
manded to know his identity. Because Green was paid 
out of the President's contingency fund, Congress 
made the fund an issue during the subsequent adminis-
tration of President Polk. Polk refused to disclose his 
expenditures in a statement that openly acknowledged

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 3 
they were being used for more than intelligence gath-
ering: 
In no nation is the application of such funds to be 
made public. In time of war or impending danger 
the situation of the country will make it neces-
sary to employ individuals for the purpose of 
obtaining information or rendering other important 
services who could never be prevailed upon to act 
if they entertained the least apprehension that 
their names or their agency would in any contin-
gency be revealed.26 
One early example of a covert action brought to an 
end through a leak is described in Edward Sayle's 
article on the history of U.S. intelligence: 
President Pierce, as Polk, made extensive use of 
agents and covert action. One of the most inno-
vative plans was to acquire Cuba from Spain. 
Spain had refused to part with the troublesome 
island, and a scheme was devised to force them 
to sell. It called for cooperative European 
money-lenders to call in their loans to the Span-
ish Crown, pressuring Madrid to sell Cuba to the 
United States as a means to raise the needed cash. 
The plan went well until leaked to the New York 
Herald. 2 7 
Examples like these are legion. During the coun-
try's first century, Presidents used literally hundreds 
of secret agents at their own discretion. Congress did 
give the President a contingency fund for these 
agents, but never specifically approved, or was asked 
to approve any particular agent or activity. In fact, 
Congress never approved or was asked to approve 
covert activity in general. The Presidents were simply 
using their inherent executive powers under Article II 
of the Constitution. For the Congresses that had ac-
cepted the overt presidential uses of military force 
summarized in the previous section, the use of Execu-
tive power for these kinds of covert activities raised 
no constitutional questions. 
Conclusion 
Presidents asserted their constitutional independ-
ence from Congress early. They engaged in secret 
diplomacy and intelligence activities, and refused to 
share the results with Congress if they saw fit. They 
unilaterally established U.S. military and diplomatic 
policy with respect to foreign belligerent states, in 
quarrels involving the United States, and in quarrels 
involving only third parties. They enforced this 
policy abroad, using force if necessary. They engaged 
U.S. troops abroad to serve American interests with-
out congressional approval, and in a number of cases 
apparently against explicit directions from Congress. 
They also had agents engage in what would common-
ly be referred to as covert actions, again without 
Congressional approval. In short, Presidents exercised 
a broad range of foreign policy powers for which 
they neither sought nor received Congressional sanc-
tion through statute. 
This history speaks volumes about the Constitu-
tion's allocation of powers between the branches. It 
leaves little, if any, doubt that the President was ex-
pected to have the primary role of conducting the 
foreign policy of the United States. Congressional ac-
tions to limit the President in this area therefore 
should be reviewed with a considerable degree of 
skepticism. If they interfere with core presidential for-
eign policy functions, they should be struck down. 
Moreover, the lesson of our constitutional history is 
that doubtful cases should be decided in favor of the 
President. 2 8

Chapter 4 
Constitutional Principles In Court 
The historical examples given in the preceding section 
point the way toward a proper understanding of the 
Executive's foreign policy powers as those powers 
have evolved under the Constitution. The assertion by 
Presidents, and the acceptance by Congress, of inher-
ent presidential powers in foreign policy were the 
normal practice in American history before the 1970s, 
not an aberration. The history therefore creates a 
strong presumption against any new constitutional in-
terpretation that would run counter to the operative 
understanding in the legislative and executive 
branches that has endured from the beginning. 
The Supreme Court has used history in just such a 
presumptive way. In the Opinion of the Court in the 
"flexible tariff" delegation case of Field v. Clark, Jus-
tice Harlan wrote: 
The practical construction of the Constitution, as 
given by so many acts of Congress [involving 
similar delegations], and embracing almost the 
entire period of our national existence, should not 
be overruled unless upon a conviction that such 
legislation was clearly incompatible with the law 
of the land.' 
The point of this quotation is not that historical usage 
must slavishly be followed. Rather, it is that historical 
precedents?especially ones that began almost imme-
diately, with the support of many who participated in 
the 1787 Convention?carry a great deal of weight in 
any discussion about what the Constitution was sup-
posed to mean in the real world of government. 
The historical examples clearly undermine the posi-
tion of the staunchest proponents of Congressional 
power: that Presidents were intended to be ministerial 
clerks, whose only authority (except for subjects ex-
plicitly mentioned in Article II) must come from Con-
gress. But that still leaves two other possibilities that 
must be considered when judging the constitutional 
validity of executive action. One is that a particular 
exercise of presidential power may have been accepta-
ble in the past only because Congress had not yet 
spoken on the subject. The other is that at least some 
exercises of implied power (i.e., power not explicitly 
stated in Article II) are so central to the office that 
they remain beyond the constitutional reach of legisla-
tive prohibition. The Supreme Court precedents dis-
cussed below show that many of the major Iran-
Contra actions undertaken by President Reagan, his 
staff, and other executive branch officials, fall into the 
constitutionally protected category. 
The Steel Seizure Case and 
Inherent Presidential Power 
Justice Robert Jackson's concurring opinion in the 
Steel Seizure Case (Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. 
Sawyer) is often used as a basis for outlining the logi-
cally possible constitutional relationships between leg-
islative and executive power. In the case's most 
famous dictum, Jackson wrote: 
We may well begin by a somewhat over-simpli-
fied grouping of practical situations in which a 
President may doubt, or others may challenge, 
his powers, and by distinguishing roughly the 
legal consequences of this factor of relativity. 
1. When the President acts pursuant to an ex-
press or implied authorization of Congress, his 
authority is at its maximum, for it includes all 
that he possesses in his own right plus all Con-
gress can delegate. . . . 
2. When the President acts in absence of either 
a congressional grant or denial of authority, he 
can only rely upon his own independent powers, 
but there is a twilight in which he and Congress 
may have concurrent authority, or in which its 
distribution is uncertain. . . . 
3. When the President takes measures incom-
patible with the express or implied will of Con-
gress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he 
can rely only upon his own constitutional powers 
minus any constitutional powers of Congress 
over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive 
presidential control in such a case only by dis-
abling the Congress from acting upon the sub-
ject.2 
The major issues in the Iran-Contra investigation 
have to do with incidents about which Congress os-
tensibly has spoken. In other words, putting aside

Chapter 4 
issues of statutory construction to be argued in later 
chapters, they all fall into Jackson's third category, 
the one where presidential power is supposedly at its 
weakest. Even in this category, however, Jackson 
conceded that Congress is "disabled" from interfering 
with some matters. 
Later in the same opinion, Jackson distinguished 
between situations in which an exercise of power is 
turned outward, as it is in most pure foreign policy 
matters, and those on which it is turned inward, as it 
was in the labor-management dispute involved in the 
Steel Seizure Case: 
I should indulge the widest latitude of interpreta-
tion to sustain his [the President's] exclusive func-
tion to command the instruments of national 
force, at least when turned against the outside 
world for the security of our society. But, when 
it is turned inward, not because of rebellion but 
because of a lawful economic dispute between 
industry and labor, it should have no such indul-
gence.3 
Jackson's opinion was cited with approval by a 
unanimous court in Dames & Moore v. Regan, a case 
that grew out of a claim against Iranian assets frozen 
by President Carter during the hostage crisis of 1979-
81.4 In the same Dames & Moore opinion, however, 
Justice Rehnquist was careful to say: "We attempt to 
lay down no general 'guidelines' covering other situa-
tions not involved here." Immediately after this 
statement, and just before the reference to Jackson, 
Rehnquist also quoted with approval a famous pas-
sage from the 1936 case of US. v. Curtiss-Wright 
Export Corp.: 
[W]e are dealing here not alone with an authority 
vested in the President by an exertion of legisla-
tive power, but with such an authority plus the 
very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the 
President as the sole organ of the federal govern-
ment in the field of international relations?a 
power which does not require as a basis for its 
exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, 
like every other governmental power, must be 
exercised in subordination to the applicable pro-
visions of the Constitution.6 
Taken together, therefore, the Steel Seizure Case, 
Dames & Moore v. Regan and US. v. Curtiss-Wright 
stand for the following propositions: The President 
does not have plenary power to do whatever he 
wants in foreign policy; Congress does have some 
legislative powers in the field. However, there are 
some foreign policy matters over which the President 
is the "sole organ" of government and Congress may 
not impinge upon them. 
472 
The Holding of the Curtiss-Wright 
Decision 
Before we apply these general constitutional princi-
ples to the events in these investigations, we should 
first expand upon the authority of US. v. Curtiss-
Wright. That case involved a challenge to a congres-
sional resolution that specified criminal penalties to be 
invoked against arms merchants if the President 
should determine and proclaim that prohibiting arms 
sales would promote peace in a conflict in the Chaco 
in Bolivia. Because Congress had passed a resolution 
specifying what would happen if, and only if, the 
President issued a proclamation, the case is sometimes 
dismissed as if its statements confirming inherent pres-
idential power in foreign affairs were obiter dicta 
having no value as precedent. 
This misreading of Curtiss-Wright is based on a mis-
understanding of the importance of the main issue of 
the case in the legal history of the New Deal. The 
Curtiss-Wright Corporation had challenged the law as 
permitting criminal penalties to be based on an execu-
tive action, a proclamation, that was not guided by 
clear standards specifying the conditions under which 
the proclamation should or should not be issued. The 
challenge, in other words, was that the law involved 
an excessively broad, standardless delegation by Con-
gress of its own legislative power.* 
Delegation was very much of a live issue at the 
time of Curtiss-Wright. In the two years before this 
case, the Supreme Court in three separate decisions?
and for the only three times in the country's history 
before or since?used the concept of excessive, stan-
dardless delegation to declare some of the main pieces 
of New Deal legislation to be unconstitutional.7 Be-
cause the joint resolution concerning Bolivia con-
tained no more precise standards than the ones in the 
statutes the Court had just overturned, there was no 
way for the Court to uphold the Bolivian resolution 
without either abandoning its recently adopted tough 
stance on delegation, or somehow distinguishing this 
case from the others. The Court's statements about 
the President's inherent foreign policy powers there-
fore were crucial to its final decision. 
The differences between the President's and Con-
gress's powers over domestic and foreign policy made 
up the bulk of Justice Sutherland's opinion for the 
Court in Curtiss-Wright. When it came time to show 
the relevance of these differences for the delegation 
issue, Sutherland used a quotation from Chief Justice 
Hughes's Opinion of the Court in the first of the three 
*Because it has been fifty years since the Supreme Court over-
turned an act of Congress solely because of excessive delegation, 
people today tend to overlook the issue's past importance. The 
doctrine remains on the books, but in the words of administrative 
law specialist Kenneth Culp Davis, it has become a collection of 
words "without practical effect." See Kenneth Culp Davis, Admin-
istrative Law and Government (2d ed., 1975) at 39.

preceding delegation decisions, Panama Refining Co. 
v. Ryan. In the Panama Refining case, the Court in-
validated a major New Deal law, the National Indus-
trial Recovery Act, by saying that the NIRA in-
volved an excessively broad delegation. In order to 
support the decision, however, the Court felt that it 
had to distinguish the NIRA from a string of earlier 
statutes, beginning with the Neutrality Act of 1794, 
that had been upheld despite seeming to contain simi-
larly broad delegations. What the Court said in 
Panama Refining was that the Neutrality Act and the 
other previously upheld statutes had "confided to the 
President, for the purposes and under the conditions 
stated, an authority which was cognate to the conduct 
by him of the foreign relations of the government."8 
By saying this, the Court was indicating that the lack 
of inherent and "cognate" constitutional powers in 
the sphere of domestic policy meant that the Court 
should apply a more rigorous delegation standard that 
it had for foreign policy. 
In Curtiss-Wright, the Court was saying that Presi-
dent Roosevelt had his own, inherent power to issue a 
statement of neutrality in the Bolivian conflict, and 
even use force to implement it abroad, just as Wash-
ington had in 1794. If the President wanted to go 
beyond proclamations to impose criminal law sanc-
tions on U.S. citizens for domestic acts, however, 
congressional authority would be needed.* 
The need for legislation before criminal sanctions 
could be imposed for domestic activity in turn brought 
the delegation issue into play. In Curtiss-Wright, the 
court held that solely because the President is the sole 
organ of the country's foreign relations, Congress 
does not have to spell out the conditions under which 
a Presidential proclamation may invoke criminal sanc-
tions with the same precision as it must to meet con-
stitutional standards in a case of domestic policy. The 
underlying premises about the President's foreign 
policy powers thus were essential to the holding in 
Curtiss-Wright, and have never been challenged or 
abandoned by subsequent Supreme Courts. Justice 
Jackson's recognition in The Steel Seizure Case that 
some areas of Presidential authority are beyond Con-
gress's reach, and the 1981 Supreme Court invocation 
of both Curtiss-Wright and Jackson in the previously 
mentioned Dames & Moore case make this abundantly 
clear. 
*The Supreme Court in an unrelated matter in 1812 had held that 
federal courts could no longer impose criminal penalties based 
simply on the common law. U.S. v. Hudson & Goodwin 11 U.S. (7 
Cranch) 32 (1812). For contrast, see Chief Justice Jay's charge to 
the jury in Henfield's Case, in which Jay stated his reasons why the 
government could impose a common law criminal sanctions to 
support President Washington's Neutrality Proclamation. 11 Fed. 
Cas. 1099 (C.C.D.Pa., 1793) (No. 6,360). 
The President as the "Sole Organ" 
for Diplomacy 
We have shown that the Constitution gives the Presi-
dent some power to act on his own in foreign affairs. 
What kinds of activities are set aside for him? The 
most obvious?other than the Commander-in-Chief 
power and others explicitly listed in Article II?is the 
one named in Curtiss-Wright: the President is the "sole 
organ" of the government in foreign affairs. That is, 
the President and his agents are the country's eyes 
and ears in negotiation, intelligence sharing and other 
forms of communication with the rest of the world. 
This view has a long and until recently unchal-
lenged history. As was mentioned in the earlier histor-
ical section, the phrase originated in Alexander Ham-
ilton's Pacificus papers of 1793 and was used by John 
Marshall in a House floor debate in 1800. The 1860 
lower court decision of Durand v. Hollins described 
the President as "the only legitimate organ of the 
government, to open and carry on correspondence or 
negotiations with foreign nations, in matters concern-
ing the interests of the country or of its citizens." 
Justice Jackson also referred to the concept in an 
opinion written just four years before the Steel Seizure 
Case. In C. & S. Air Lines v. Waterman Corp., a case 
involving a Civilian Aeronautics Board decision to 
deny an airline a license to serve foreign countries, 
Jackson said: 
Congress may of course delegate very large 
grants of its power over foreign commerce to the 
President. [Citation omitted.] The President also 
possesses in his own right certain powers con-
ferred by the Constitution on him as Command-
er-in-Chief and as the Nation's organ in foreign 
affairs. For present purposes, the order draws 
vitality from either or both sources." ? 
Finally, to complete this brief history, the passage 
from Curtiss-Wright with the "sole organ" reference 
was quoted and reaffirmed in Dame & Moore v. 
Regan in 1981. 
The "Sole Organ" and the Boland 
Amendments 
What are the implications for the Iran-Contra investi-
gation of characterizing the President as the "sole 
organ" of foreign policy? For one thing, it is beyond 
question that Congress did not have the constitutional 
power to prohibit the President from sharing informa-
tion, asking other governments to contribute to the 
Nicaraguan resistance, or entering into secret negotia-
tions with factions inside Iran. Such conversations are 
paradigms of what Chief Justice John Marshall said in 
Marbury v. Madison: "The President is invested [by 
the Constitution] with important political powers in 
the exercise of which he is to use his own discre-
473 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
. I I I

Chapter 4 
tion."" In addition, as Marbury made clear, these 
powers do not stop with the President. To make them 
effective, the President may exercise his own discre-
tion through agents of his own choice. 
To aid him in the performance of these duties, he 
is authorized to appoint certain officers who act 
by his authority and in conformity with his 
orders. In such cases, their acts are his acts; and 
whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner 
in which executive discretion may be used, still there 
exists, and can exist, no power to control that discre-
tion. . . . 
The conclusion from this reasoning is, that 
where the heads of departments are the political 
or confidential agents of the executive, merely to 
execute the will of the president, or rather to act 
in cases in which the executive possesses a consti-
tutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more 
perfectly clear than that their acts are only politi-
cally examinable.' 2 
What follows from Chief Justice Marshall's opinion 
in Marbury is that if Congress cannot prevent the 
President from exercising discretion over a particular 
matter, neither may it prevent the President's personal 
staff on the National Security Council, the Depart-
ments of State and Defense, the Intelligence Commu-
nity, or the President's ad hoc personal representa-
tives, from performing the same tasks on the Presi-
dent's orders and in his own name. 
Many, if not all, of the actions by representatives of 
the U.S. government that have been alleged to run 
counter to the Boland amendments were essentially 
forms of information sharing and diplomatic commu-
nication. To the extent that such activities by the 
NSC staff, CIA, State Department or Defense De-
partment were covered by the amendments?and we 
shall argue that many were not?we believe the ac-
tivities were constitutionally protected against limita-
tion by Congress. The executive was not bound to 
follow an unconstitutional effort to limit the Presi-
dent's powers. 
Protecting American Citizens 
Abroad 
One inherent presidential power particularly relevant 
to the Iranian side of this investigation is the power to 
protect the lives and interests of American citizens 
abroad. Our earlier summary of presidential uses of 
force without prior congressional authorization 
showed the many occasions for which this was the 
justification. One example was left off the earlier list 
to be used here. 
In July 1854, U.S. Navy Commander George S. 
Hollins demanded reparations from Nicaragua after a 
U.S. official was injured during a riot. When he failed 
474 
to receive satisfaction, Hollins ordered his ships to 
bombard San Juan del Norte, otherwise known as 
Greytown. Calvin Durand then sued Hollins in the 
Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York 
for damages the bombardment had caused to his prop-
erty. In its opinion denying Durand's claim, the court 
said: 
As the executive head of the nation, the president 
is made the only legitimate organ of the general 
government, to open and carry on correspond-
ence or negotiations with foreign nations, in mat-
ters concerning the interest of the country or of 
its citizens. It is to him, also, the citizens abroad 
must look for protection of person and of proper-
ty, and for the faithful execution of the laws 
existing and intended for their protection. For 
this purpose, the whole executive power of the 
country is placed in his hands, under the constitu-
tion, and the laws passed in pursuance thereof. 
. . . 
Now, as it respects the interposition of the 
executive abroad, for the protection of the lives 
or property of the citizen, the duty must, of ne-
cessity, rest in the discretion of the president. 
Acts of lawless violence, or of threatened vio-
lence to the citizen or his property, cannot be 
anticipated and provided for; and the protection, 
to be effectual or of any avail, may, not infre-
quently, require the most prompt and decided 
action. . . . 
The interposition of the president abroad, for 
the protection of the citizen, must necessarily rest 
in his discretion; and it is quite clear that, in all 
cases where a public act or order rests in execu-
tive discretion neither he nor his authorized agent 
is personally civilly responsible for the conse-
quences.' 3 
Several times during the public hearing of these 
Committees, Republican Members referred to the 
1868 Hostage Act. This act, which says that a Presi-
dent should take all steps necessary to secure the 
release of Americans held illegally by a foreign 
power, is discussed later, in the section of our Iran 
chapter about the Americans held hostage in Leba-
non. Interestingly, the Durand v. Hollins decision af-
firming the President's discretionary power came 
eight years before the Hostage Act changed a discre-
tionary power into an obligation. Even without that 
act, the Durand case stands for the proposition that 
the President has the discretion to take whatever steps 
may be necessary, short of a full scale war, to protect 
American citizens. The Supreme Court reiterated this 
point in its analysis of the privileges and immunities of 
U.S. citizens in The Slaughter-House Cases:

Chapter 4 
Another privilege of a citizen of the United 
States is to demand the care and protection of the 
Federal government over his life, liberty, and 
property when on the high seas or within the 
jurisdiction of a foreign government. Of this 
there can be no doubt." 
This privilege of citizenship was specifically en-
dorsed again by the Supreme Court in the 1890 case 
of In re Neagle. Referring to the President's obligation 
to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed," the 
Court said: 
In the view we take of the Constitution of the 
United States, any obligation fairly and properly 
inferrible from that instrument, or any duty . . . 
to be derived from the general scope of his duties 
under the laws of the United States, is "a law" 
within the meaning of this phrase. . . . 
Is this duty limited to the enforcement of acts 
of Congress or of treaties of the United States 
according to their express terms, or does it in-
clude the rights, duties and obligations growing 
out of the Constitution itself, our international 
relations, and all the protection implied by the 
nature of the government under the Constitu-
tion?' 5 
In answering its own question, the Court referred 
the 1853 Austrian seizure of Martin Koszta, a Hungar-
ian native who had declared his intention to become a 
U.S. citizen. Captain Ingraham trained his ship's guns 
on an Austrian ship to gain Koszta's release to France 
during diplomatic negotiations. The action "met the 
approval of the country and of Congress, who voted 
a gold medal to Captain Ingraham for his conduct in 
the affair," the Court noted. "Upon what act of Con-
gress then existing can any one lay his finger in sup-
port of the action of our government in this 
matter?"' 6 
After reviewing these cases, Borchard's 1915 trea-
tise on protecting citizens abroad concluded: 
Inasmuch as the Constitution vests in Congress 
the authority to 'declare war' and does not em-
power Congress to direct the President to per-
form his constitutional duties of protecting Amer-
ican citizens on foreign soil, it is believed that the 
Executive has unlimited authority to use the 
armed forces of the United States for the protec-
tive purposes abroad in any manner and on any 
occasion he considers expedient.' 7 
Quincy Wright's classic 1922 treatise on the control of 
U.S. foreign relations quoted this passage from Bor-
chard and endorsed it "with the sole qualification that 
'the manner' may not amount to a making of war."" 
Underlying Borchard's, Wright's and the 19th century 
Supreme Court's interpretation of the President's dis-
cretionary power is the Hamiltonian notions in the 
Pacificus papers. We noted earlier that Hamilton had 
rested part of his argument on the difference in lan-
guage between Article I and II. Article I gives Con-
gress "all legislative powers herein granted," but Arti-
cle II gave the President all of "the executive power" 
without qualification. What the 19th century decisions 
did, in pure Hamiltonian fashion, was to look at the 
inherent character of the executive power and then 
look to Article I only to see if there were explicit 
exceptions carved out for Congress. When no such 
exceptions were found, the Presidential actions were 
upheld. 
The Constitutional Limits to 
Congressional Restrictions 
All of these court decisions demonstrate that the 
President was meant to have a substantial degree of 
discretionary power to do many of the kinds of things 
President Reagan did in Iran and Central America. 
They do not suggest that a President can do anything 
he wants. Congress and President were given differ-
ent resources and different modes of influencing the 
same policy arenas. Both President and Congress can 
sway the U.S. posture toward Nicaragua or Iran, for 
example, but each have their own characteristic tools 
to bring to bear on the subject. What the Constitu-
tional separation of powers protects is not the Presi-
dent's or Congress's precise sway over particular 
events. That is for the individual occupants of each 
branch to earn. But the Constitution does prevent 
either branch from using its own powers, or modes of 
activity, to deprive the other branch of its central 
functions. 
The Iranian arms sales, for example, involved sales 
of U.S. assets. As such, the sales were governed either 
by the Arms Export Control Act, or by the Economy 
Act and National Security Act. These laws clearly 
affect one method a President may wish to use to 
protect American lives abroad. Nevertheless, the con-
stitutionality of the legislation seems assured both by 
Congress's power to regulate foreign commerce (Arti-
cle I, Sec. 8) and, perhaps, by Congress's power to set 
rules for disposing of U.S. property." More impor-
tantly, the legislation would withstand constitutional 
challenge because Congress acted to pursue an explic-
it grant of legislative power without undermining or 
negating the President's equally important inherent 
power to protect American lives and safety. 
Similarly, we grant without argument that Congress 
may use its power over appropriations, and its power 
to set rules for statutorily created agencies, to place 
significant limits on the methods a President may use 
to pursue objectives the Constitution put squarely 
within the executive's discretionary power. For exam-
ple?although we shall show later that the Boland 
amendments, as actually written, permitted the NSC 
staff to continue providing certain types of military

Chapter 4 
and operational advice to the Nicaraguan Democratic 
Resistance?we have no doubt that Congress has the 
constitutional power to enact a statute that would cut 
off all military and financial aid to the Resistance, 
except those that fall under the constitutionally pro-
tected rubric of information-sharing and diplomatic 
communication. 
The question thus is not whether Congress has any 
power overlapping the President's, but what bound-
aries the Constitution places on congressional at-
tempts to limit the President. The most obvious limit 
is that just as Congress cannot tell the President to do 
something unconstitutional, neither can it impose an 
unconstitutional requirement as a condition for grant-
ing a privilege.20 It therefore may not insist that the 
President forego some of his constitutionally protect-
ed power to get appropriations. The most recent 
major case on this point is the "legislative veto" deci-
sion of INS v. Chadha, in which the Supreme Court 
held that Congress cannot demand that the President 
give up his power to sign, or refuse to sign, legislative 
decisions?even if the President agreed to the original 
bill that set up the procedure to bypass the so-called 
"presentment" requirement.21 
Power of the Purse 
These basic rules apply to appropriations as much as 
to any other kinds of laws. As Louis Fisher wrote in 
a 1979 study for the Congressional Research Service, 
the Constitution "does not distinguish between appro-
priation and authorization."22 One recent court case 
on this point involved an amendment on a Health, 
Education and Welfare (HEW) Department appro-
priation bill prohibiting the department from using 
any of its funds, including salaries, to impose manda-
tory school busing plans on local communities to pro-
mote racial desegregation. The U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia ruled in 1980 that in 
order to preserve the statute's constitutionality, it 
would be construed to prohibit HEW from cutting off 
federal funds to a school district that refused to imple-
ment a busing plan. The statute could not, however, 
constitutionally prohibit HEW from seeking other 
ways to promote desegregation. In addition, if HEW 
believed a particular school district needed busing to 
enforce the requirements of the Constitution, the law 
could not be read to prohibit HEW from recommend-
ing that the Justice Department bring a suit in the 
federal courts. 2 3 
In other words, Congress may not use its control 
over appropriations, including salaries, to prevent the 
executive or judiciary from fulfilling Constitutionally 
mandated obligations. The implication for the Boland 
amendments is obvious. If any part of the amend-
ments would have used Congress's control over sala-
ries to prevent executive actions that Congress may 
not prohibit directly, the amendments would be just 
476 
as unconstitutional as if they had dealt with the sub-
ject directly. 
There is one other important way the Constitution 
circumscribes legislative limitations on the executive. 
To explain the way it works, it is easiest to begin with 
a quotation from the 1893 case of Swaim v. U.S.: 
Congress may increase the Army, or reduce the 
Army, or abolish it altogether; but so long as we 
have a military force Congress cannot take away 
from the President the supreme command. . . . 
Congress can not in the disguise of 'rules for the 
government' of the Army impair the authority of 
the President as commander in chief.24 
The same argument extends by analogy to all of the 
President's inherent powers under Article II. Con-
gress does not have to create a State Department or 
an intelligence agency. Once such departments are 
created, however, the Congress may not prevent the 
President from using his executive branch employees 
from serving as the country's "eyes and ears" in for-
eign policy. Even if Congress refuses to fund such 
departments, it may not prevent the President from 
doing what he can without funds to act as the nation's 
"sole organ" in foreign affairs. Even the final report 
of the Church committee acknowledged this point.25 
In the same vein, Congress does not have to appro-
priate any funds for covert operations. Or, it may 
decide to give funds only for specified operations one 
at a time. Since 1789, however, Congress has chosen 
to give the President a contingency reserve fund for 
secret agents and operations. The existence of such a 
fund is obviously crucial, because without it Congress 
would have to make individual appropriations for 
each action and thereby harm the country's ability to 
respond to breaking events during a fiscal year with-
out compromising the secrecy of the operation. Nev-
ertheless, even though a contingency fund is an essen-
tial tool for foreign policy, there is nothing in the 
Constitution requiring Congress to set one up. Once 
Congress makes the decision to establish such a fund, 
therefore, it may as a quid pro quo set rules for its 
use. 
However, there are some limits to the rules Con-
gress may thereby impose. For example, Congress 
may not insist, and has never insisted upon giving 
advance approval to covert operations because such a 
requirement would be the functional equivalent of a 
legislative veto. Similarly, Congress may not condi-
tion an authorization or appropriation upon any other 
procedural requirements that would negate powers 
granted to the President by the Constitution. What 
Congress grants by statute may be taken away by 
statute. But Congress may not ask the President to 
give up a power he gets from the Constitution, as 
opposed to one he gets from Congress, as a condition 
for getting something, whether money or some other 
good or power from Congress.

Chapter 4 
Notifying Congress 
This observation bears directly on the legal require-
ments for notifying Congress. Before we explain how, 
another "implied powers" analogy is in order. In the 
1821 case of Anderson v. Dunn, the Supreme Court 
upheld Congress's contempt power by finding that 
even though the power was not explicitly mentioned 
in the Constitution, it was clearly necessary to imple-
ment other powers that were. 
There is not in the whole of that admirable in-
strument, a grant of powers which does not draw 
after it others, not expressed, but vital to their 
exercise; not substantive and independent, indeed, 
but auxiliary and subordinate. 
The idea is utopian that government can exist 
without leaving the exercise of discretion some-
where. Public security against the abuse of such 
discretion must rest on responsibility, and stated 
appeals to public approbation. . . . 
If there is one maxim which necessarily rides 
over all others, it is, that the public functionaries 
must be left at liberty to exercise the powers 
which the people have entrusted to them. The 
interests and dignity of those who created them, 
require the exertion of the powers indispensable 
to the attainment of the ends of their creation. 
.2 6 
. .  
Using this line of reasoning, the Court argued that 
even though courts were vested with the contempt 
power by statute, they would have been able to exer-
cise that power without the aid of a statute. For the 
same reason, the court held, Congress must have in-
herent authority to exercise a similar power." Later 
cases tried to circumscribe Congress's contempt 
power, but the power itself was always held to be a 
necessary adjunct to Congress's legislative functions 
and therefore to rest on an implied constitutional 
foundation. 2 8 
The argument that a power must be implied by the 
Constitution because it is essential to some other con-
stitutional power, is what lay behind the claims of 
President Carter's and President Reagan's Justice De-
partments that Congress may not constitutionally re-
quire the President to give advance notification, or 
even notification to a limited number of members 
within 48 hours, of all covert operations. Some oper-
ations, by their very nature, may make notification 
within 48 hours impossible. The situations are rare, 
but they clearly exist. 
According to Admiral Stansfield Turner, who was 
the Director of Central Intelligence at the time, there 
were three occasions, all involving Iran, in which the 
Carter Administration withheld notification during an 
ongoing operation. By contrast, the CIA's general 
counsel has told the House Intelligence Committee 
that the Iran arms sales were the only time President 
Reagan withheld notice during his two terms." In 
the Carter examples, notification was withheld for 
about three months until six Americans could be 
smuggled out of the Canadian Embassy in Teheran. 
As Representative Norman Mineta pointed out in tes-
timony following Turner's, the Canadian government 
made withholding notification a condition of their 
participation.3? Notification was also withheld for 
about six months in two other Iranian operations 
during the hostage crisis. Said Turner: "I would have 
found it very difficult to look . . . a person in the eye 
and tell him or her that I was going to discuss this life 
threatening mission with even half a dozen people in 
the CIA who did not absolutely have to know".31 In 
these situations, President Carter thought his constitu-
tional obligation to protect American lives could not 
have been fulfilled if he had been required to notify 
Congress within 48 hours. As the Canadian example 
makes clear, the choice is sometimes put on us by 
people outside U.S. control between not notifying or 
not going ahead at all. 
These examples show that the situations under 
which notification may have to be withheld depends 
not on how much time has elapsed, but on the charac-
ter of the operation itself. In the very rare situation in 
which a President believes he must delay notification 
as a necessary adjunct to fulfilling his constitutional 
mandate that decision must by its nature rest with the 
President. As the Supreme Court has said: "In the 
performance of assigned constitutional duties, each 
branch of the government must initially interpret the 
Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by 
any branch is due great respect from the others."32 
The President obviously cannot consult with Con-
gress about whether to consult. Any other conclusion 
would be logically absurd. 
In some respects, requiring notification within a 
specific time period might look like other Congres-
sional report-and-wait requirements imposed on the 
executive branch that the Supreme Court has explicit-
ly endorsed.33 There is one important difference, 
however. The report and wait requirements the Court 
has upheld have all been in domestic policy matters 
over which the President has no inherent power to 
act without statutory authorization. In foreign rela-
tions, Congress can use statutes to deprive Presidents 
of the means necessary to conduct an effective policy, 
but it cannot use its control over the means to deprive 
the President of his underlying authority or its essen-
tial adjuncts. 
Some people in Congress worry that the power to 
withhold notification may be abused, as we think it 
was in 1985-86 in the Iran arms sales. To avoid abuse, 
Representatives Stokes and Boland have introduced a 
bill that would require advance notification in most 
cases, and notification within 48 hours for all of the 
rest. We are convinced this approach would be un-
477

constitutional. Equally importantly, we think it is not 
needed. The constitutional basis for withholding noti-
fication can only be invoked credibly, by its own 
terms, in very rare circumstances. A generalized fear 
that Congress might leak would not by itself suffice, 
because the same fear could be invoked equally for all 
covert actions and therefore would not be credible. 
The members who think they need new legislation 
underestimate the political leverage they now have to 
insure that a President will not abuse his inherent 
power. The oversight rules already in place assure 
that Congress eventually will find out about any oper-
ation. Once that happens, Congress's control over the 
purse, and its power to investigate, give it ample 
means to exact a severe political price on a President 
whom it feels has overstepped proper bounds. The 
Iran-Contra investigations have made this abundantly 
clear to President Reagan. We cannot believe any 
future President will miss the point. 
Conclusion 
The Constitution gives important foreign policy 
powers both to Congress and to the President. Nei-
478 
ther can accomplish very much over the long term by 
trying to go it alone. The President cannot use the 
country's resources to carry out policy without con-
gressional appropriations. At the same time, Congress 
can prohibit some actions, and it can influence others, 
but it cannot act by itself, and it is not institutionally 
designed to accept political responsibility for specific 
actions. Action or implementation is a peculiarly ex-
ecutive branch function. 
The Constitution's requirement for cooperation 
does not negate the separation of powers. Neither 
branch can be permitted to usurp functions that 
belong to the other. As we have argued throughout, 
and as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 1983, "the 
powers delegated to the three branches are functional-
ly identifiable."34 The executive branch's functions 
are the ones most closely related to the need for 
secrecy, efficiency, dispatch, and the acceptance by 
one person, the President, of political responsibility 
for the result. This basic framework must be pre-
served if the country is to have an effective foreign 
policy in the future.

Chapter 5 
Nicaragua: The Context 
It is impossible to understand the motivations for the 
Administration's actions without first understanding 
the strategic and political context within which it was 
operating. In describing these circumstances, it is nec-
essary to begin with the fact that the Sandinista Gov-
ernment in Nicaragua is a Communist regime that 
openly espouses the expansionist, Leninist doctrine of 
"revolution without borders." Because of this, and 
because the Sandinistas have behaved in a manner 
consistent with the doctrine by supporting Commu-
nist insurgencies elsewhere in Central America, 
Nicaragua has become a direct threat to the stability 
of the governments of its neighbors and to U.S. secu-
rity interests. 
In 1979, in the belief that it was supporting a turn 
toward a more pluralistic, more democratic path in 
Nicaragua, the United States decided, with bipartisan 
support, to cut off all military aid to the corrupt 
predecessor dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, sup-
ported its removal, and provided $118 million in eco-
nomic aid to the new regime in its first 18 months. 
That bipartisan support included some of us who are 
among the more conservative Members of these Com-
mittees. Indeed, a clear majority in Congress accepted 
the Carter Administration's arguments that the Sandi-
nista-led revolution should be judged by its actions. In 
short, the U.S. Government wanted to believe that 
the incoming revolutionary government would honor 
its mid-1979 pledge to the Organization of American 
States of implementing democratic reforms. 
It was not too long, however, before it became 
apparent that once again the United States had been 
fooled by Marxists masquerading as democrats, much 
as the Sandinistas' mentor, Fidel Castro, had done 20 
years before. By April of 1980, the Nicaraguan Coun-
cil of State was packed with Sandinista adherents 
who were more attuned to policies of internal repres-
sion than to fulfilling the dashed promises that had led 
Social Democrats to join the revolutionary cause. 
That turn of events prompted the resignation of Al-
fonso Robelo and led him ultimately to join the lead-
ership of the Nicaraguan resistance. Nevertheless, 
United States assistance continued. 
But Sandinista repression goes beyond packing the 
key governmental forums. Consider these remarks by 
Resistance leader Adolfo Calero in our hearings: 
The Sandinistas are systematic breakers of human 
rights. There is no habeas corpus in Nicaragua. If 
people are not brought over to tribunals they are 
kept in jails at Sands, the secret jails. Their secret 
jails are spread throughout the country. There is 
torture going on. While I was living in Nicaragua 
I was personally told of experiences of one of my 
drivers, driver salesman of the Coca Cola. I re-
member he was put into a freezer and when he 
was about to die, and started to?I don't know 
what you call?the last reaction that people have 
when they are about to die?somebody heard 
him and took him out.' 
What ultimately turned the course on aid to Nicara-
gua was not only the change in the Sandinista's be-
havior inside Nicaragua, however, but its growing 
importance in the global competition between the 
U.S. and the Soviet Union. The 1979 Foreign Assist-
ance Act giving aid to the Sandinistas contained a 
provision, authored by Rep. C.W. "Bill" Young of 
Florida, that required the aid to be terminated if the 
President could not certify that Nicaragua was not 
exporting or supporting violence and terror in neigh-
boring Central American nations. By September 1980, 
some Members of Congress began to question Presi-
dent Carter's certification on this point. 
Representative Young, then a Member of the House 
Intelligence Committee, was disturbed by President 
Carter's certification of Sandinista compliance with 
democratic procedures and with its pledges to the 
OAS. As a Member of the intelligence panel, Young 
was privy to information that contradicted what the 
President was saying. On September 30, 1980, he de-
cided to voice his concerns in public testimony before 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee 
on Inter-American Affairs. Young had this to say 
about the main substantive point at issue: 
I am very concerned about the President making 
the certification that the government of Nicara-
gua is not involved in the exporting of terrorism 
or in supporting the overthrow of other duly 
constituted governments in Central America, 
since I have access to the intelligence information 
of the Central Intelligence and Defense Intelli-
gence Agencies concerning this matter. While I

Chapter 5 
cannot quote classified information in this open 
session, I can tell you that the intelligence reports 
confirm in overwhelming detail that the Sandi-
nista clique that rules Nicaragua is engaged in the 
export of violence and terrorism. 
Young's testimony did not stop at this point, how-
ever. It seems that the Democratic Administration 
was less than forthcoming about giving the legislative 
branch the information it needed to fulfill its policy 
responsibilities. Young said: 
I feel that you should also know about the diffi-
culties that we have recently had in obtaining the 
classified information on this subject from the 
Executive Branch. 
As I previously noted, the staff of the Subcom-
mittee on Evaluation has had an ongoing study of 
intelligence on Nicaragua which began in late 
1978. As part of that responsibility the staff often 
makes visits to the CIA to talk with analysts and 
periodically requests studies produced by the 
CIA and other intelligence agencies in Washing-
ton, and in general has paid attention to what is 
going on. 
On 12 August of this year, the staff made a rou-
tine request to talk with an analyst at CIA's Na-
tional Foreign Assessment Center about Nicara-
gua. The staff was told that they would not be 
able to talk with the analyst at CIA since there 
was "a Presidential Embargo" on talking about 
Nicaragua. I was unaware of this at the time 
since this took place during the recess, but the 
staff was quite concerned. The Chairman of the 
Committee, Mr. Boland, sent a letter to the Di-
rector of Central Intelligence on this matter, on 
August 22. To date the CIA has not responded to 
that letter. 
I would further note that the staff was notified 
via telephone on September 10 that the embargo 
had been lifted and that discussions could be held 
with CIA analysts. Two days later, the President 
made his certification that Nicaragua is not ex-
porting terrorism and/or acting as a conduit for 
arms or sanctuary for revolutionaries in other 
Central American countries. 
It is very disturbing that the Central Intelligence 
Agency was directed to not provide an answer to 
the Chairman of the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence to the questions that 
he asked in his letter of August 22. 
The conclusion Young drew from this was very 
serious. It mirrors one particular charge we have 
heard in the Iran-Contra hearings, but from a much 
firmer base. 
484 
What we have is a case of the intelligence com-
munity being manipulated by the Executive 
Branch to protect a political sensitivity. What 
dismays me is the political misuse of the intelli-
gence community, which rightfully has a reputa-
tion for objectivity. The intelligence community 
must be free of political bias so that our decision 
makers can use their reports to reach decisions 
based on the facts of the matter, and not on 
desired political outcomes.2 
Following Young's testimony, the Carter Administra-
tion slowed down its aid to Nicaragua. It was not 
until January, however, in the final days of his Presi-
dency, that President Carter decided to suspend aid. 
The Reagan Administration quickly decided to con-
duct a careful review of available intelligence regard-
ing Nicaraguan subversive, extraterritorial activities. 
In April 1981, the Administration determined that the 
Sandinistas were furnishing logistical and political as-
sistance to the rebels in El Salvador. By November 
1981, the Sandinista armed forces had grown from an 
armed force of only 5,000 2 years before, to about 
40,000 troops supported by Soviet tanks, artillery, and 
armored personnel carriers.3 Some 2 years later, the 
House Intelligence Committee, chaired by Represent-
ative Boland, corroborated this finding when it de-
clared that: 
[T]his (Salvadoran) insurgency depends for its 
life-blood, arms, ammunition, financing, logistics 
and command-and-control facilities, upon outside 
assistance from Nicaragua and Cuba. This Nica-
raguan-Cuban contribution to the Salvadoran in-
surgency is longstanding. It began shortly after 
the overthrow of Somoza in July, 1979. It has 
provided, by land, sea and air, the great bulk of the 
military equipment and support received by the in-
surgents. 4 
During the period between January 1982 and Janu-
ary 1985, while Congress was vacillating and pinching 
pennies, the Soviet Union and its allies provided 
about $500 million in military aid alone to Nicaragua. 
By early 1985, at the time of the cutoff of U.S. tax-
payer military assistance to the Resistance, the Sandi-
nista armed forces included 62,000 troops. Their arse-
nal also included nearly 150 tanks (of which more 
than 110 were T-55 Soviet battle tanks that were 
clearly superior to any other tank in the region), 200 
other armored vehicles (mostly machine-gun-armed 
BTR-60 and BTR-152 personnel carriers that can 
carry an infantry squad), 300 missile launchers, 45 
airplanes, and 20 helicopters, including the deadly 
Soviet MI-24 HIND-D "flying tanks" that General 
Singlaub described as "the most effective people kill-
ing machine[s] in the world." 5 
During 1985, the already high level of aid acceler-
ated. According to publicly available material provid-

Chapter 5 
ed by the State Department, the Soviet Union, Cuba, 
and Eastern Bloc countries gave Nicaragua another 
$150 million in military aid in 1985. (In addition to the 
Soviet Union and Cuba, Nicaragua is receiving aid 
from Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Libya, and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, among others.6) 
That figure for military aid jumped to $580 million 
for 1986 alone. Between December 1982 and October 
1986, according to Defense Intelligence Agency esti-
mates discussed in these Committees' public hearings, 
the same countries gave $1.34 billion in military aid 
and another $1.8 billion in economic aid to the Nicara-
guan Government.7 The net result is that Nicaragua 
has far and away the largest armed force in all of 
Central America, and that does not even take into 
account approximately 2,500 to 3,000 advisers from 
the Soviet Union, Cuba, and other Soviet bloc coun-
tries.8 In contrast, all U.S. humanitarian and military 
aid to the Resistance during the entire 1980s amount-
ed to approximately $200 million, $100 million of 
which came in the fiscal year from October 1, 1986 to 
September 30, 1987. 
These numbers only begin to give a picture, how-
ever, of the reasons for viewing Nicaragua as a threat 
to the region. According to former National Security 
Advisor Robert C. McFarlane: 
The danger is not Nicaraguan soldiers taking on 
the United States, it is that country serving as a 
platform from which the Soviet Union or other 
surrogates like Cuba can subvert neighboring re-
gimes and ultimately require the United States to 
defend itself against a Soviet threat, whether by 
spending more dollars on defense that we didn't 
need to, to worry about our southern border, 
whether we need to worry more about the 
Panama Canal now that Russians are here, 
whether we need to be concerned about the half 
of our oil imports that come from refineries in 
the Caribbean within MIG range of Nicaragua, 
and we have not had to think about these things 
for a long time, 
The danger, it should be obvious from what McFar-
lane said, is not simply that posed to other Central 
American countries by Nicaragua's own armed forces. 
According to information presented during General 
Singlaub's testimony, the Nicaraguans are building a 
10,000-foot-long airstrip at Punta Huete. As Repre-
sentative Hyde observed, the runway is "capable of 
accommodating any Soviet aircraft in their inventory. 
That includes the Backfire bomber, the Bear-D recon-
naissance aircraft, and it's strictly a military facility 
with antiaircraft guns deployed around the air-
field." 10 Singlaub agreed, and said that what made 
the airfield significant was that it would accommodate 
intercontinental as well as short-range aircraft. 
Nor is this all. The Soviet Union has an intelligence 
collection facility at Lourdes near Havana, Cuba, that 
is able to monitor maritime, military and space com-
munications as well as telephone conversations in the 
Eastern portion of the United States. A similar base in 
Nicaragua would mean a similar capability for the 
Pacific and West Coast." Finally, the Nicaraguans 
are building the Corinto port facility that is being 
made into a deep water port able to accommodate 
submarines." The Soviet presence in Nicaragua, in 
other words, when combined with its presence in 
Cuba, could mean a Soviet base on both ends of the 
Caribbean as well as the only Soviet port in the 
Pacific outside the Soviet Union itself. The latter, 
Singlaub said, "would give them for the first time a 
base from which they could threaten the West Coast 
of the United States." 13

Chapter 5 
So there is plenty of reason for a President of the 
United States to think the Nicaraguan Government is 
not merely unfortunate for its own people, but a dis-
tinct threat to the security of the region and, ultimate-
ly, to the United States. This is no speculative threat. 
In 1983, the Congress found that: 
By providing military support (including arms, 
training, and logistical, command and control, 
and communications facilities) to groups seeking 
to overthrow the government of El Salvador and 
other Central American governments, the Gov-
ernment of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua 
has violated article 18 of the Charter of the Orga-
nization of American States which declares that 
no state has the right to intervene, directly or 
indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the in-
ternal or external affairs of any other state.14 
This finding was not repealed by the Boland Amend-
ment the following year. In fact, in the International 
Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 
the Congress found that Nicaragua: 
Has committed and refuses to cease aggression in 
the form of armed subversion against its neigh-
bors in violation of the Charter of the United 
Nations, the Charter of the Organization of 
American States, the Inter-American Treaty of 
Reciprocal Assistance, and the 1965 United Na-
tions General Assembly Declaration on Interven-
tion.15 
The legal significance of these findings can be found 
in the charter of the Organization of American States. 
The specific clause of the treaty Congress charged 
Nicaragua with violating was the one that said: "No 
State or group of States has the right to intervene, 
directly or indirectly, in the internal affairs of any 
other State." 16 By defining Nicaragua's behavior as 
aggression, the Congress also, knowingly, was bring-
ing another clause of the treaty into play: 
Every act of aggression by a State against the 
territorial integrity or the inviolability of the ter-
ritory or against the sovereignty or political inde-
pendence of an American State shall be consid-
ered an act of aggression against the other Amer-
ican States.17 
Finally, by invoking these clauses, Congress also was 
involving a third that fundamentally distinguishes 
U.S. actions from Nicaragua's: "Measures adopted for 
the maintenance of peace and security in accordance 
with existing treaties do not constitute a violation of 
the principles as set forth in Articles 18 and 20." 18 
What all of this means is that when President 
Reagan sought to bring pressure on the Nicaraguan 
Government by aiding the Resistance, he was doing 
something more than merely furthering his own 
policy goals. According to the findings of the Con-
gress of the United States and the terms of the OAS 
charter, the President was obliged to do what he 
could to act against Nicaragua's aggression against its 
neighbors. The finding would not have permitted the 
President to violate laws that explicitly prohibited the 
use of appropriated funds for a particular purpose. 
Beyond these explicit prohibitions, however, the 
President was not only permitted by his inherent for-
eign policy powers under the Constitution, but was 
positively obliged to do whatever he could, within 
the law, to respond to Nicaragua's behavior. 
Because of this obligation, it is not proper to assert 
that the President should have gone out of his way to 
avoid any actions that some of the Boland Amend-
ment's sponsors might arguably have wished to pro-
hibit. Although no President is required to so inter-
pret a law on any subject within his constitutional 
authority, such a response might have made sense as 
an act of prudence and comity if Congress had only 
passed a prohibition. The fact, however, is that Con-
gress put two sets of obligations on the President, one 
mandating action and the other restricting it. Under 
the circumstances, the President had a duty to try to 
satisfy both of the mandates, to whatever extent he 
could possibly do so.

Chapter 6 
The Boland Amendments 
People listening to the public hearings on the Iran-
Contra Affair heard many statements about the "spirit 
of the Boland Amendments." Everyone knows, the 
argument goes, that Congress wanted to cut off all 
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan resistance. Congress did 
not anticipate that anyone on the National Security 
Council staff would support private and third-country 
fundraising or give advice to and help coordinate the 
private resupply effort. Col. North's activities were a 
clear attempt, the argument concludes, to circumvent 
the law. 
There are three basic problems with this line of 
reasoning. First, as previously discussed, the Constitu-
tion does not permit Congress to prevent the Presi-
dent or his designated agents from communicating 
with the Nicaraguan resistance or from encouraging 
other countries and private citizens to support the 
resistance. Second, as Justice Frankfurter said in Ad-
dison v. Holly Hill Co., "Congress expresses its mean-
ing by words . . . . It is no warrant for extending a 
statute that experience may disclose that it should 
have been made more comprehensive." One of the 
reasons there was so much discussion of the "spirit of 
the law" at the hearings is, as we shall show, that it is 
difficult to argue the letter of the law had been violat-
ed. Finally, even this last statement concedes too 
much. The fact is that Congress was not animated by 
a single "spirit" when it passed the Boland Amend-
ments. It is necessary, therefore, to take account of 
the political history in the first part of this chapter as 
well as the statutory history in the rest. 
The "Spirit" of October 1984 
We have already noted that at the same time Con-
gress was denying appropriations for the anti-Sandi-
nista resistance, it was also declaring the Sandinista 
Government to be in violation of a provision of the 
OAS Charter that calls for a response by the Presi-
dent. In addition, Congress has changed its collective 
mind virtually every year over policy toward Nicara-
gua. The United States gave aid to the Sandinistas in 
fiscal 1980, took aid away from the Sandinistas at the 
end of 1980 for fiscal year 1981, and then gave covert 
support to the democratic resistance in 1981 for fiscal 
year 1982. For fiscal 1983, Congress denied aid "for 
the purpose of overthrowing the government," a re-
striction that was all but meaningless and therefore 
adopted by the House unanimously. For fiscal year 
1984, Congress removed the language about purpose 
but limited the amount of assistance to a level that it 
knew would not last for the full year. Then, the 
strictest version of the Boland Amendment was 
adopted for fiscal 1985?partly, it is often said, be-
cause Congress was upset at allegedly not having 
been informed about the CIA's role in connection 
with the mining of Nicaraguan harbors.* 
*Much has been written about whether the late Director of 
Central Intelligence, William Casey, adequately informed the 
Senate Intelligence Committee about the mining of Nicaraguan 
harbors in 1984. A review of the record indicates that while Casey 
could have been more expansive, he did clearly tell the Committee 
on March 8, and again on March 13, that mines were being placed 
in the Nicaraguan harbors of Corinto and El Bluff, as well as at the 
oil terminal at Puerto Sandino. See Bob Woodward, Veil: The 
Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987 (1987), Chapter 16, 319-338; also 
McMahon Dep., 9/2/87, at 32-41. 
On the House side, the Intelligence Committee, chaired then by 
Edward Boland, received a mining briefing on January 31, 1984, 
more than two months before these activities became a public 
controversy, and approximately three weeks after the first mines 
were deployed. The CIA had been discussing the possibility of 
mines being employed in Nicaragua with the House panel as far 
back as the summer of 1983. 
In essence, what appears to have happened in the Senate is that 
following disclosures in the media in early April 1984 about these 
operations, a number of Senators feigned ignorance of these activi-
ties. In fact, they had known about them for some time. Senator 
Leahy was one who had known for some time and scolded his 
colleagues for their hypocrisy. Reportedly, some Senators who 
knew about the mining when they voted for additional assistance 
for the Contras turned around after the media disclosures and voted 
for a resolution condemning and prohibiting the mining. As Leahy 
put it, "There were Senators who voted one way the week before 
and a different way the following week who knew about the 
mining in both instances and I think were influenced by public 
opinion, and I think that's wrong and that is a lousy job of legisla-
tive action." (See Henry J. Hyde, Can Congress Keep a Secret?, 
National Review, Aug. 24, 1984, pp. 46-61; also, Bernard Gwertz-
man, Moynihan to Quit Senate Post in Dispute on CIA, New York

April 17, 1984; McFarlane Test., Hearings, 100-2, 5/13/87, at 230-

During this period, Casey's deputy was John McMahon. His 
recollection of this matter is consistent with Leahy's. He indicates

Chapter 6 
The way the majority treats the mining incident is 
symptomatic of its entire pre-history of the Boland 
Amendment. The basic argument is that Congress had 
an open mind about Nicaraguan policy, but that the 
Administration offered shifting rationales for the 
policy, misled Congress as to its intentions and ac-
tions, and finally justified a cutoff of funds by failing 
to notify Congress adequately about the mining of the 
harbors in Nicaragua. This is, of course, a totally 
subjective, hence fundamentally misleading account of 
the political history, to the limited extent that the 
facts it cites are accurate. First, the majority thesis 
utterly ignores what the Soviets and Sandinistas were 
that on the March 12, 13 Appropriations Committee Senators were 
briefed, and on the following day, "Casey was back to the Senate 
Intelligence Committee" to remind Members of what he had told 
them previously about the mining. After that session, McMahon 
recalls: 
[There was] still not a word. We then, on March 28, got a letter 
from Senator Pell in Foreign Relations saying, "Tell me about this 
mining." So we prepared a written response, sent it to Senator Pell 
through Barry Goldwater, who was then Chairman of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence. Not munh happened until the 
latter part of the first week, in April, when there was a great deal 
of furor in the press, which generated in Europe, about the mining 
of the harbors, was picked up by the Post and Times here and a lot 
of noise, and suddenly amnesia struck Capitol Hill, no one remem-
bered hearing about the mining. . . Barry Goldwater sent a letter 
to Casey telling him he was "pissed." When I got this letter I went 
in to Casey and said, "What the hell is he talking about, where has 
he been for the last two months?" (See McMahon Dep. 9/2/87 at 
35-37.) 
Subsequently, according to McMahon, Casey confronted Gold-
water regarding the mining notification. McMahon recalls: 
[Casey] showed him then the transcript from the hearings on the 
8th and on the 13th of March, and Barry [Goldwater] said, "You 
know, I don't know, I just don't remember." And it's my under-
standing that Barry wanted to send a letter of apology to the 
agency but was urged not to do so?because the Senate apologizes 
to no one. 
McMahon added that as far as he was concerned, "there was no 
intent by the agency to keep the mining of the harbors from the 
committees. We did everything we possibly could to tell them 
about it and tell them about it in a timely fashion." (McMahon 
Dep., 9/2/87 at 36-38.) 
Interestingly, Senator Goldwater, who excoriated Casey for al-
legedly not properly informing the Senate Intelligence Committee 
on the mining, voted on April 10, 1984, against the resolution 
condemning the mining. (See Congressional Record, April 10, 1984, 
p. S4205.) 
Ultimately, Casey felt the politically expedient thing to do was to 
"apologize" to the Senate Intelligence Committee and get this 
brouhaha behind him. When he finally did so, Senator Jake Garn 
reportedly became enraged because he believed there had been 
adequate notification. In his new book, Veil, Bob Woodward claims 
Garn underscored his fury by screaming: 
"You're all [expletive deleted's?the whole Congress is full of 
[expletive deleted's, all five hundred thirty-five Members are 
[expletive deleted's" . . . . Members stood up, including Moyni-
han, who wanted to prevent a further confrontation. "Smile," 
Moynihan said, "when you call me an [expletive deleted]." Garn 
later wrote to Goldwater and apologized for disrupting the Com-
mittee. (See Woodward, Veil, at 33.) 
Garn subsequently confirmed most of this story, saying only that 
the incident occurred after the committee meeting was over and 
that he did not apply the expletive to the full Senate. See Around 
the Hill, Roll Call, October 25, 1987, p. 13. 
490 
doing during the same period to escalate the conflict 
and consolidate the Marxist regime in Managua.* 
Second, it ignores the fact that many Members of 
Congress, almost all Democrats, opposed U.S. policy 
in Nicaragua almost from the beginning, and that 
most of the votes in both the House and the Senate 
during the relevant periods, including the votes on 
the various contested versions of the Boland Amend-
ments, were almost completely straight party-line 
votes. 
One key result of its remarkably distorted account 
is that the majority often confuses cause and effect. 
This is almost self-evident in its treatment of the 
mining of Nicaraguan harbors. In October 1983, Con-
gress decided to limit funding for the Contras to $24 
million for fiscal year 1984, an amount deliberately 
calculated to fall considerably short of the Contras' 
needs for that period. This was the handwriting on 
the wall, that the Contras might well be cut off com-
pletely if there was a slight change in the climate of 
opinion. The Contras knew it; the Sandinistas knew it; 
and the U.S. Government knew it. The mining was 
therefore an effort to bring the Sandinistas to the 
table before Congress cut off support. In short, it was 
an effect of the Congressional decision, not the cause 
of a later decision. But this reversal of cause and 
effect is typical of the majority's amateur psychohis-
tory. Unfortunately for them, in many other parts of 
the world psychohistory is correctly not regarded as 
a useful tool in foreign relations. 
The strictest of the Boland Amendments was in 
effect for only eight months when Congress decided 
to allow some humanitarian aid to the resistance. 
Then, a few months into the fiscal year, Congress also 
permitted communications assistance and advice. Fi-
nally, for fiscal 1987, Congress resumed full funding 
for the resistance at a level of $100 million. As 
McFarlane said to Representative Courter during tes-
timony, "It is absolutely out of the question to have a 
coherent policy with that kind of a change in the 
legal framework." 2 
Congress's ambivalence expressed itself not only 
from year to year, but within years as well?including 
the year of the strictest Boland prohibition. If all we 
were talking about was a clear expression of Congres-
sional intent in the form of a strict prohibition, that 
clear statement would have to govern for as long as it 
stayed in effect. The fact, however, is that Congress 
was of more than one mind?even within the statute 
that contained the strictest Boland prohibition. 
The most stringent Boland Amendment was part of 
a continuing appropriations resolution that included 9 
of the 13 appropriations bills needed to fund the Gov-
alt is one of the curious facts of the Majority Report that the 
first acknowledgement of the communist nature of the regime 
comes on page 11 of the Executive Summary while the first politi-
cal description of the Sandinistas comes on page 3.

Chapter 6 
ernment for fiscal 1985.3 The fiscal year started on 
October 1, 1984. President Reagan had already vetoed 
one continuing resolution because of its spending 
levels; Government workers even had to be fur-
loughed at one point. By the time a reworked funding 
bill reached the floor on October 10 and 11, there was 
a great sense of political urgency. Election Day was 
only 3 weeks away, the resolution contained a large 
number of contentious water and public works 
projects important for individual districts, and mem-
bers of the House and Senate were all eager to get 
home to campaign. 
All year long, passage of the Intelligence Authori-
zation and Department of Defense Appropriations 
Acts had been stalemated between the staunch oppo-
nents of aid for the resistance, who made up a majori-
ty in the House, and the equally staunch supporters of 
aid, who formed a majority in the Senate. In the 
compressed, highly politicized pre-election timetable 
of October, the two groups were willing to work out 
a compromise. The final defense appropriations bill 
included the famous Boland prohibition quoted below, 
together with a series of expedited procedures that 
would let Congress vote on a new, $14-million aid 
package for the Contras any time after February 28. 
Some supporters of aid for the resistance, such as 
Senator John East of North Carolina, criticized the 
Senate Republican leadership for agreeing to the deal. 
"What I think we have done in this conference report 
is exchange the aid to the Contras and other impor-
tant defense-related items . . . for water projects," 
East said.4 Senator Ted Stevens, who was the Assist-
ant Majority Leader and, as Chairman of the Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Defense, was the floor 
manager of this portion of the conference report, was 
the other main speaker on the Senate floor at the 
same time as East. Stevens said that: 
[East's position] is counterproductive to his point 
of view. There is money in this bill for assistance 
to the Contras. There is $14 million . . . . I can 
tell the Senator that it would take less than 31 
days to pursue that subject under this report, in 
terms of fast-tracking both the House and Senate, 
a resolution to approve the President's certifica-
tion. 
That money is in the bill and it can be used. 
The money that was provided the Contras ran 
out in August. The Contras are still supporting 
themselves with assistance they are getting from 
elsewhere in the world. Having that assistance 
out there to be made available on March 31 will 
encourage that assistance from other sources to 
the Contras during this period.3 
Representative Boland's explanation of the conference 
agreement took note of the same compromise lan-
guage, albeit in terms that emphasized the importance 
of the prohibition he had been so strongly supporting. 
Representative Boland did say: 
This prohibition applies to all funds available in 
fiscal year 1985 regardless of any accounting pro-
cedure at any agency. 
It clearly prohibits any expenditure, including 
those from accounts for salaries and all support 
costs. 
The prohibition is so strictly written that it also 
prohibits transfers of equipment acquired at no 
cost. 6 
In the same speech, however, Boland also said: 
The compromise which we have worked out on 
Nicaragua preserves the House position with one 
important proviso. 
No funds may be spent on the secret war in 
Nicaragua until February 28, 1985 . . . . 
Only if Congress affirmatively provides for a re-
newal of funding for the war could any funds be 
used for that purpose.7 
Representative Boland, in other words, essentially 
was confirming Senator Stevens' interpretation of the 
compromise. The Senate supporters of Contra aid 
were willing to agree to the conference report, and 
the President was willing to sign the bill, only be-
cause there was a general understanding that a second 
vote would be forthcoming after the 1984 elections 
were out of the way. Clearly, that understanding 
would have made no sense unless the resistance con-
tinued to exist. Thus, President Reagan's instructions 
to his staff to do whatever they could within the law 
to keep the democratic resistance alive, and the ac-
tions he took that were consistent with Congress's 
findings about the OAS charter, all were entirely in 
keeping with the full spirit?the spirit expressed by all 
of the participating Members of Congress?of even 
the strictest Boland prohibition. 
The Words of the Boland 
Amendment 
The real legal issue turns, therefore, on the exact 
words of the Boland Amendment.* Before turning to 
*The majority criticizes the only contemporaneous executive 
branch legal opinion on the issue, from the President's Intelligence 
Oversight Board, which concluded that the NSC was not covered 
by the Boland Amendment. The majority asserts that the drafter 
was not given all the facts needed for his opinion, but ignores the 
fact that the drafter specifically testified at the hearings that having 
the additional facts then before the Committees would not have 
changed his key legal conclusions. (Sciaroni Test., Hearings, 100-5, 
6/8/87, at 12.) The majority also criticizes the credentials of the

Chapter 6 
those words, however, it is important to bear in mind 
that they were a rider, or a limitation amendment, to 
an appropriations bill. The Boland Amendment was 
not, for example, like the Hatch Act, which prohibits 
specific (political) activities by civil servants whether 
they are on the job or off. s Nor is it like the Neutrali-
ty Act, which also prohibits defined activities and 
makes them criminal.9 An appropriations rider, even 
if it reaches salaries, is nothing more than a limitation 
on the way Federal funds may be used. It does not 
reach a person's whole life and does not make activi-
ties criminal. 
What were the precise "funds available," to use Mr. 
Boland's words, whose use was prohibited? The rele-
vant language read as follows: 
During fiscal year 1985, no funds available to the 
Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of 
Defense, or any other agency or entity of the 
United States involved in intelligence activities 
may be obligated or expended for the purpose or 
which would have the effect of supporting, di-
rectly or indirectly, military or paramilitary oper-
ations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organi-
zation, movement or individual." 
The terms of this prohibition apply to funds made 
available to specific arms of the executive branch. 
The fiscal 1983 prohibition of aid "for the purpose of 
overthrowing the government" applied only to funds 
available to the Department of Defense and Central 
Intelligence Agency. The fiscal 1985 law broadens the 
prohibition to include "any other agency or entity of 
the United States involved in intelligence activities." 
The obvious question, given Col. North's activities in 
behalf of the democratic resistance, is whether the 
staff of the National Security Council (NSC) is an 
"agency or entity" covered by the act. 
Comparing the Boland Language With 
Broader Prohibitions 
The phrase "agency or entity involved in intelligence 
activities" is surely an odd one that needs explaining. 
Some Members of Congress may have thought they 
were enacting an absolute prohibition in 1984, and 
that feeling may help explain the vehemence of their 
reaction to what the NSC staff did. But if that is the 
result Congress wanted to achieve, it chose very bad 
language for doing so?language that, as we shall 
show soon, carried a legislative history that specifical-
ly excluded the NSC from its coverage. 
If Congress had simply wanted to prohibit all U.S. 
activity that might help the resistance, there were 
plenty of easier ways available for it to have done so. 
drafter, but ignores the fact that Committee testimony proves the 
opinion was approved and issued after review by a Board which 
includes Charles Meyers, former Dean of the Stanford Law School, 
as one of its three members. (Id.) 
492 
All it needed to do was look at another very well 
known and similar law, the Clark Amendment, that 
cut off support to the resistance fighters in Angola in 
1976. That language read as follows: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no as-
sistance of any kind may be provided for the 
purpose, or which would have the effect, of pro-
moting or augmenting, directly or indirectly, the 
capacity of any nation, group, organization, 
movement or individual to conduct military or 
paramilitary operations in Angola." 
Congress obviously knows how to write an airtight 
prohibition when it wants to. As in this example, it 
does not write about agencies or entities, but simply 
bars "assistance of any kind" from any source. 
Virtually every year, appropriations bills contain 
prohibitions worded more broadly than the Boland 
Amendment. The continuing resolution for 1986, for 
example, says that "none of the funds available in this 
or any other Act shall be made available for the pro-
posed Woodward light rail line in the Detroit, Michi-
gan area" unless certain conditions are met." If this 
example seems too far-fetched, consider the Hughes-
Ryan Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1981, an amendment that anyone responsible for the 
Boland Amendment would know in detail: "No funds 
appropriated under the authority of this or any other 
Act may be expended by or on behalf of the Central 
Intelligence Agency" for foreign operations unless the 
President finds the action to be important to the na-
tional security and reports a description of the oper-
ation to Congress in a timely fashion.' 3 
The absence of the phrase "any other Act" from 
the Boland Amendment is important for considering 
whether the NSC was covered by that act. The fiscal 
1985 continuing resolution containing the Boland 
Amendment stitched together nine appropriations bills 
and a comprehensive crime control bill. The major 
sections of the resolution followed the wording of the 
original appropriations bills by designating each of the 
original bills as a separate "act," each with its own 
preamble and title." That each "act" within the con-
tinuing resolution was treated as a separate legal 
entity is shown by the fact that several of them con-
tained prohibitions against using the money "in this 
act" for lobbying, but each of the lobbying provisions 
was worded differently, prohibiting different kinds of 
behavior for different departments." The Boland 
Amendment was not contained in the same appropria-
tions bill that provides funds for the NSC. The De-
partment of Defense Appropriations, for example, in-
cludes traditional elements of the intelligence commu-
nity. The National Security Council, in contrast, is 
and traditionally has been funded together with the 
rest of the White House in an entirely separate appro-
priations bill for Treasury, Postal Service, and Gener-
al Government that is considered by a separate appro-

priations subcommittee.' 6 If Congress had intended to 
cover the funds made available to the NSC staff for 
salaries, in other words, it could easily have followed 
the broad language of the Clark Amendment, the 
Arms Export Control Act, or words often used to 
extend appropriation riders to funds made available in 
"any other act." 
The Boland Amendment's Language in 
Other Intelligence Law 
What accounts for the narrowness of the language 
of the Boland Amendments? The phrase "agency or 
entity involved in intelligence activities" did not origi-
nate with these particular prohibitions. The history of 
its use in intelligence legislation begins with the at-
tempts during the late 1970s to pass a comprehensive 
charter for the intelligence community. 
On February 8, 1980, the last version of the broad 
charter bill was introduced in the Senate. It contained 
the following definition: 
The terms "intelligence community" and "entity 
of the intelligence community" mean 
(A) the office of the Director of National Intelli-
gence [the bill's successor to the Director of Cen-
tral Intelligence]; 
(B) the Central Intelligence Agency; 
(C) the Defense Intelligence Agency; 
(D) the National Security Agency; 
(E) the offices within the Department of Defense 
for the collection of specialized national intelli-
gence through reconnaissance programs; 
(F) the intelligence components of the military 
services; 
(G) the intelligence components of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation; 
(H) the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in 
the Department of State; 
(I) the foreign intelligence components of the De-
partment of Treasury; 
(J) the foreign intelligence components of the 
Department of Energy; 
(K) the successor to any of the agencies, offices, 
components or bureaus named by the clauses (A) 
through (J); and 
(L) such other components of the departments 
and agencies, to the extent determined by the 
President, as may be engaged in intelligence ac-
tivities.' 7 
Later, the same bill said that "the entities of the 
intelligence community [defined above] are authorized 
to conduct intelligence activities, under the direction 
and review of the National Security Council, but only 
in accordance with the provisions of this Act."18 The 
bill, in other words, clearly and intentionally did not 
treat the NSC as an "entity of the intelligence com-
munity." 
At least one staff consultant to the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence was concerned that the bill 
would not require the NSC to report any covert 
operations it might undertake. William R. Harris was 
directly involved in the deliberations that led to the 
statutory language we have been analyzing. Because 
of his expertise on the subject, House Chairman Lee 
Hamilton and Ranking Minority Member Dick 
Cheney wrote a letter to the former Senate consultant 
asking him "for any observations or recollections that 
relate to the concept of an 'intelligence agency' or 
'intelligence entity' as traditionally understood by 
Congress or the Chief Executive." Harris responded 
on September 25, 1987, with a 14-page statement that 
is reprinted as Appendix A to this Minority Report. 
In his position as consultant, Harris urged the Com-
mittee to write language that would include the NSC: 
It was my position that, unless the mandatory 
reporting duties included the NSC and its staff, 
there was a foreseeable risk of the NSC manag-
ing covert operations through the NSC itself, 
without a specific duty to report on such activi-
ties to the oversight committees of the Congress. 
The Charter and Guidelines Subcommittee staff-
ers indicated that the President would not author-
ize this change in customary practice, precisely 
because, upon discovery, the Congress would 
enact legislation requiring mandatory reporting 
by the National Security Council or the President 
regarding its activities. 
At this point (on a day in February 1980 that I 
cannot ascertain from my records), I took the 
issue to the staff director of the Senate Select 
Committee, William G. Miller. Any change of 
the nature I was proposing would reopen consti-
tutional issues of concern to the Attorney Gener-
al and the Counsel to the President. Mr. Miller 
reminded me that both Vice President Mondale 
and David Aaron, the Deputy Special Assistant 
to the President for National Security Affairs, 
served with the committee. The President would 
not permit, I was advised, the conduct of covert 
operations by the NSC staff itself. I reminded the 
staff director that intelligence charters must be 
designed to function under changed and partly 
unforeseen circumstances, well beyond the serv-
ice of officials who knew the precise reasons for 
legislative action.' 9

Chapter 6 
Harris' position was that if Congress wants to pro-
hibit or require the President and the NSC to do 
something?as he thought it should?then Congress 
should say so clearly and not rely on the political 
sympathy of a current Vice-President and NSC staff-
er. We agree with this position wholeheartedly. As 
Justice Frankfurter said in the quotation we used at 
the beginning of this chapter, "Congress expresses its 
meaning by words." 2 ? 
One month later, the Committee staff produced a 
draft that partly addressed Harris's concern, not by 
expanding the definition of the intelligence communi-
ty, but by adding language that would have made it 
more difficult for the NSC and other parts of the 
Government to conduct covert operations.21 The 
Congress did not enact this language, however, and 
decided to concentrate strictly on the subject of over-
sight. 
The Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 started out 
as one section of the charter bill. After some change, 
it was enacted as an amendment to the National Secu-
rity Act of 1947. The shorter version omits the origi-
nal bill's long definition of the intelligence community 
to require reports of intelligence activities to Congress 
from: 
The Director of Central Intelligence and the 
heads of all departments, agencies, and other enti-
ties of the United States involved in intelligence 
activities. 2 2 
In this version, the language is almost identical to the 
jurisdictional language of the Boland Amendment. 
Given the statutory history, the phrase appears simply 
to be a shorthand substitute for items (C) through (L) 
on the long itemized list in the proposed charter. 
The fact that the Oversight Act was an amendment 
to the National Security Act is instructive. The Na-
tional Security Act created the National Security 
Council, which has only four statutory members: the 
President, Vice President, Secretary of State, and Sec-
retary of Defense, with the President clearly put at 
the head. In order to believe that the phrase "agencies 
and other entities involved in intelligence activities" 
applied to the NSC, one would have to accept the 
entirely preposterous idea that the 1980 law contem-
plated the head of the NSC, that is, the President, 
personally reporting any "significant anticipated intel-
ligence activity"?including any of a purely informa-
tion-gathering character?to the Intelligence Commit-
tees. Even if Congress had wanted to engage in the 
constitutional confrontation such a reading would 
imply, it is difficult to imagine Congress specifically 
mentioning the Director of Intelligence in the Over-
sight Act, and then reaching the President by indirec-
tion without even bothering to say so. 
The point that Congress did not intend to treat the 
President as the head of an "intelligence agency or 
entity" is strengthened when one realizes that the 
494 
Oversight Act also amended a sentence that appears 
immediately after the one in the Hughes-Ryan Act, 
which does require Presidential Findings for covert 
CIA operations. There is no way the Members of 
Congress could have amended one sentence without 
considering its relation to the other. As the words of 
Hughes-Ryan make clear, when Congress wants to 
place a requirement on the President, it does so di-
rectly. 
There is no way to avoid the conclusion that the 
text of Oversight Act imposes. Even though many 
people today seem to assume that this law imposes a 
reporting requirement directly on the President, the 
fact is that it does not. The Oversight Act's reporting 
requirements cover the Director of Central Intelli-
gence and the heads of all other agencies or entities 
involved in intelligence activities. It deliberately did 
not cover the NSC or its head, the President. It 
knowingly exempted the NSC, even though the NSC 
staff had engaged in many activities during the 1970s 
that were well known to Congress and would have 
called for a required report under the 1980 act if the 
NSC had been covered. In fact, no one even hinted in 
1980 that the NSC or its staff should be covered by 
the Oversight Act. It is fanciful to maintain that Con-
gress intended to break almost 40 years of complete 
deference to the President's use of the NSC without 
provoking some extended discussion or controver-
sy. 2 3 
Harris concludes that Congress adopted language in 
1980 that deliberately stepped back from earlier pro-
posals for Government-wide reporting requirements 
to narrower language that excluded the NSC. He 
wrote: 
In the period 1975-1978, Congressional investiga-
tions of intelligence activities encompassed enti-
ties of the entire federal government, and propos-
als for mandatory reporting to the Congress mir-
rored that broad jurisdictional concern. 
Commencing in 1978, the intelligence oversight 
committees adopted the procedure of enacting 
separate intelligence authorization acts for all en-
tities of the "intelligence community" engaged in 
national intelligence or counterintelligence. Con-
currently, from 1978 onwards, draft legislation 
proposing mandatory self-reporting by heads of 
intelligence departments, agencies, or entities en-
compassed expressly specified departments and 
agencies and other "entities" that performed clas-
sified missions within the "intelligence communi-
ty." Proposals in 1980 to extend the scope of 
"entities" to include the National Security Coun-
cil and its staff were expressly rejected in the 
course of streamlining what became the Intelli-
gence Oversight Act of 1980.24

Chapter 6 
Once again, we agree completely with Harris' con-
clusions. His words, we should point out, gain credi-
bility from the fact that he wanted the NSC to be 
covered, over the opposition of President Carter's 
White House. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that a 
statement from a former Senate staff aide has no com-
pelling legal weight as legislative history. What gives 
the interpretation its real weight is that it is the only 
one that can make sense of the words Congress used 
in the various bills it considered and the final law it 
enacted. 
After the Oversight Act 
To complete this line of analysis, President Reagan 
issued Executive Order 12333 on December 4, 1981, 
defining the intelligence community essentially along 
the lines of the charter bill. This language was meant 
to be a definition of the phrase "agencies or entities 
involved in intelligence activities" that appeared in 
the Oversight Act. The principal NSC staff coordina-
tor for the executive order was Kenneth DeGraffen-
reid, who had worked on the staff of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence at the time the 
Oversight Act was enacted.25 The relevant section 
read as follows: 
The Intelligence Community and agencies within 
the Intelligence Community refer to the following 
agencies or organizations: 
(1) The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); 
(2) The National Security Agency (NSA); 
(3) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); 
(4) The offices within the Department of Defense 
for the collection of specialized national foreign 
intelligence through reconnaissance programs; 
(5) The Bureau of Intelligence and Research of 
the Department of State; 
(6) The intelligence elements of the Army, Navy, 
Air Force, and Marine Corps, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of 
the Treasury, and the Department of Energy, 
and; 
(7) the staff elements of the Department of 
Energy. 
It is worth noting that missing from this enumeration 
is the charter bill's elastic provision, which could po-
tentially expand the list. 
It is also worth noting that the enumeration is fol-
lowed in Intelligence Authorization Acts, including 
the specific one for fiscal 1985 that contained the 
same prohibitory Boland Amendment as the continu-
ing resolution. The previous year, the House had 
adopted a version of the Boland Amendment that also 
would have reached "any other agency or entity of 
the United States involved in intelligence activi-
ties."26 The Senate refused to agree and $24 million, 
or enough to fund the resistance for about half a 
year, was finally adopted as a compromise. During 
the House's consideration of the bill, however, Repre-
sentative Boland offered the following description of 
what the Authorization Act covered: 
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2968, the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for fiscal year 1984 authorizes 
funds for all the activities of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; 
The National Security Agency; other intelligence 
components of the Department of Defense and 
the Departments of the Army, Navy and Air 
Force; the Bureau of Intelligence and Research 
at the Department of State; the Intelligence Divi-
sions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; in-
telligence elements of the Departments of Treas-
ury and Energy, and of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration; and the intelligence community 
staff of the Director of Central Intelligence. 
Generally, these activities are divided into two 
categories. The first is intelligence activities?that 
is to say, national intelligence activities?which 
produce intelligence for important policy-makers 
of the Government?the President, the Cabinet, 
the National Security Council and the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff.2 7 
Representative Boland, in other words, adopted the 
traditional distinction of the Oversight Act and Exec-
utive Order 12333 between the intelligence communi-
ty, on the one hand, which produces intelligence, and 
the National Security Council, which is not an agency 
"involved in intelligence activities" but a consumer. 
He made it clear that the authori7ation bill did not 
apply to the NSC. 
The authorization acts follow the jurisdiction, or 
power to legislate, that the rules of the House and 
Senate give to the Intelligence Committees. The 
White House and NSC staff authorizations clearly and 
exclusively fell within the jurisdictions of other com-
mittees at the time of the Boland Amendment, as they 
do now. The importance of this fundamental fact of 
legislative history may be lost unless one has a sense 
of the jealousy with which committees traditionally 
guard their own jurisdictions. If Congress had intend-
ed to cover staffs that fall within the jurisdictions of 
two committees, the procedure virtually always 
adopted.. would have been for the second committee 
to ask for, and get, a multiple referral of the bill. 
Committees normally insist on multiple referral even 
when they are in complete agreement with what a bill 
is trying to do, because they want to preserve their 
own jurisdictional claims for the future.

Chapter 6 
To summarize, the Oversight Act, the Executive 
Order, and the typical intelligence authorization act 
do not cover the President or the National Security 
Council.* To quote Harris again, this history "estab-
lishes a presumption that only 'intelligence communi-
ty' entities are intended to be covered by other intelli-
gence-related legislation utilizing the phrasing."Harris 
does acknowledge that "the presumption may be re-
butted by evidence of actual legislative intent to the 
contrary" and says that he does not know the specific 
legislative history of the 1984 and subsequent Boland 
Amendments." We have searched that history, how-
ever, and there is no evidence of an intention to 
change a well-known term of art that excluded the 
NSC into one that included it.** 
The Spirit Redux 
Some members of these Committees have tried to 
argue, without addressing the legislative history just 
presented, that the Boland Amendment should be 
read not to cover a specific list of agencies, but any 
agency or entity that might in the future become 
involved with intelligence activities. Any other read-
ing, it is said, would render the law meaningless by 
letting the President get around its provisions by put-
ting agents in any of the Government's departments 
outside the intelligence community, including the De-
partment of Agriculture.2 9 
We consider this argument to be completely mistak-
en. For one thing, as we have just demonstrated, the 
term "agency or entity involved in intelligence activi-
ties" was not made up by the Boland Amendment out 
of whole cloth. If the phrase is to have any meaning, 
it must be the same in the Boland Amendment and 
Oversight Act. But the argument that an interpreta-
tion of Boland which excludes the NSC would be a 
"slippery slope" is also wrong because the slope is not 
*A technical question exists about whether North was covered 
by the Boland Amendment as an individual because his salary 
apparently was paid from the Department of Defense appropria-
tion. Because North's salary could just as easily have been paid or 
reimbursed from the NSC appropriation, and because the functions 
he performed on detail to the NSC were clearly NSC duties unre-
lated to his DOD assignment, our basic point is unaffected. 
**We note that the Department of Justice has concluded that 
language in section 403(b)(1) of the Intelligence Authorization Act 
reaches the NSC because it covers "any agency or entity involved 
in intelligence or intelligence-related activities." See U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice, Memorandum for the Attorney General, "Legal 
Authority for Recent Covert Arms Transactions to Iran," Decem-
ber 17, 1986, p. 5, n. 10. 
Given the history we have discussed, the accuracy of the Justice 
Department's conclusion is clearly open to question. Even assuming 
its correctness, arguendo, Attorney General Meese made, the point 
in his testimony that the underlined phrase does not appear in the 
Boland Amendment and therefore makes this phrase broader than 
the one in that amendment. Therefore, Meese said, this language is 
clearly distinguishable from the definitional language of the Boland 
Amendment, which appears in a separate section of the same bill. 
See Meese Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/29/87, at 421-22. 
496 
in fact slippery. Arguments about the NSC staff do 
not automatically apply to other departments and 
agencies. The NSC staff is the President's personal 
foreign policy staff; the Department of Agriculture is 
not. The NSC is therefore authorized to conduct, and 
historically has conducted, activities directly related 
to the President's Contra policy that others may not 
conduct without explicit statutory authority. 
If the language of the Boland Amendment did not 
cover the NSC, can the Administration fairly be said 
to have evaded the law through Oliver North's ac-
tions to help the democratic resistance? On the most 
obvious level, no one is evading the law if he or she 
continues to do something the law permits, or fails to 
prohibit. But to leave the matter there makes it look 
as if the Administration was faced with a clear Con-
gressional mandate. In fact, as we have shown, the 
mandate was two-sided. 
Part of what Congress wanted in 1984 was to cut 
off U.S. financial aid to the Contras. That objective 
was fulfilled. During fiscal 1984, Congress appropri-
ated $24 million to support the resistance, and permit-
ted the full infrastructure of the CIA, Defense De-
partment, and other intelligence agencies to back up 
the expenditure of the money. When the Boland 
Amendment went into effect, the CIA's financial and 
infrastructure support was eliminated. The entire Na-
tional Security Council appropriation, for all salaries 
and all worldwide activities, was between $4 million 
and $5 million during the mid-1980s. The most the 
NSC staff could do would be to spend a part of a few 
people's salaries to encourage activities that did not 
spend U.S. funds. At its most ambitious, the NSC 
staff's activity would therefore represent a minuscule 
fraction of the U.S. Government's support for the 
resistance before the prohibition. 
This judgment is strongly reinforced by the facts 
disclosed by the record of these Committees' public 
hearings. During the period of the Boland Amend-
ment, a very small number of NSC staff officials had 
responsibilities that related to the resistance. These 
responsibilities included, among other things, main-
taining political contact with the resistance, exchang-
ing information with it, and providing it with guid-
ance and political advice. No one?especially not 
anyone familiar with U.S. intelligence?would main-
tain that the Boland Amendment outlawed these ac-
tivities. At the same time, the NSC staff engaged in 
more controversial activities, such as giving the resist-
ance expert assistance on arms procurement, helping 
to coordinate the operational details of military resup-
ply, and persuading other countries to give financial 
support to the resistance. If one tried to keep a diary 
of the NSC staffs time, however, it would quickly 
become clear that any expenditure of NSC staff sala-
ries on activities that might have been outside the law 
if the NSC were covered, was clearly incidental to 
expenditures for activities that remained clearly legal

Chapter 6 
during the time of the most stringent Boland Amend-
ment. 
There were no other significant expenditures of ap-
propriated funds to support the resistance during the 
period of the Boland Amendment?no " diverted" 
tanks or planes, for example. In short, the appropria-
tions limitation purposes of the Boland Amendment in 
fact were met. Even though the NSC staff did sup-
port the resistance in the ways just described, the 
level of U.S. support dropped to just a trickle of 
personal advice. In addition, we must reiterate that 
Congress' full intention involved more than just the 
limitation provision. Congress assumed there would 
be a future vote on the resistance, and that the resist-
ance would continue to exist as a viable force until 
that vote with funds from private and non-U.S. 
sources. Satisfying Congress's full intention, therefore, 
would almost seem to require some form of NSC staff 
involvement. 
Oliver North and John Poindexter testified that 
they attempted to comply with the law.3? We have 
seen that the NSC was not covered by the law's 
language. But even if the NSC had been covered, 
virtually all, if not all, of North's and Poindexter's 
activities in behalf of the democratic resistance would 
still have been lawful. This point can be best under-
stood by looking at the different interpretations 
placed on the law from the beginning, and at the 
changes Congress began making to the Boland prohi-
bitions within months of its adoption. 
Sharing Information and 
Intelligence Under the Boland 
Amendment 
A review of the legislative history of the Boland 
Amendment and related subsequent amendments 
makes clear that it was lawful for Col. North and 
others to provide intelligence to the resistance leader-
ship. The legislative history also makes clear that it is 
reasonable to view the Boland Amendment as allow-
ing the type of information transfer, advice, and co-
ordination that Col. North and others provided to the 
Contra resupply effort. 
On December 19, 1984, Director of Central Intelli-
gence William J. Casey wrote to Representative 
Boland, Chairman of the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, to describe some activities 
the CIA considered to be consistent with the prohibi-
tion bearing the Chairman's name. Casey's letter did 
not discuss normal information and intelligence-shar-
ing because, as a still classified exhibit to Col. North's 
testimony makes clear," Members of Congress al-
ready knew about, and approved, such communica-
tion between the resistance and CIA. Rather, Casey's 
letter was about providing specific, detailed intelli-
gence that might be useful operationally. Casey 
wrote: 
We are contemplating providing defensive intelli-
gence to the FDN . . . . This intelligence would 
be furnished exclusively for the purpose of pre-
cluding hostile actions against the FDN. We 
would ensure that the information provided does 
not contain the specific details requisite for the 
planning/launching of offensive operations. 
We are fully aware of the current restrictions 
pertaining to Agency support for insurgent 
forces. It is our belief, however, that provision of 
this information is consistent with our long-estab-
lished practice of providing intelligence as appro-
priate to prevent loss of life." 
On January 14, 1985, Casey's letter was answered by 
Boland and Representative Lee Hamilton, who was 
soon to succeed Boland as chairman. According to 
their response: 
The thrust of the public debate [over the Boland 
Amendment] . . . was clearly directed at the 
complete severance of all intelligence community 
connections with the Contras and the end of all 
support for anti-Sandinista military activity. 
Therefore, your stated intention to provide "de-
fensive intelligence" to the FDN is trou-
bling . . . . 
It is our opinion that, at a minimum, section 8066 
prohibits the provision of intelligence information 
to the FDN on any systematic or continuing 
basis, particularly if such information will enable 
a FDN force to avoid tactical contact with the 
enemy and thus be in a better position to contin-
ue military operations of its own. 
On the other hand, the unplanned for, isolated 
provision of incidentally acquired information to 
a person threatened by imminent assassination 
would seem reasonable. 
In any event, on the basis of the imprecise infor-
mation given to us, we are unable to approve or 
disapprove any contemplated CIA activity. Some 
examples of intelligence you would provide to 
the FDN could, in our view, violate the law, yet 
not every example seemed illegal . . . . 
If your decision is to proceed, we ask that you 
provide the Committee with the guidelines under 
which your General Counsel will approve or dis-
approve the furnishing of intelligence to the 
FDN.33 
In the first of the sentences quoted above, Hamilton 
and Boland clearly went beyond both the letter and 
spirit of the Boland Amendment by suggesting that its 
purpose was to eliminate "all intelligence community 
connections with the Contras." Those connections 
were continuing throughout the period with the

Chapter 6 
Chairmen's full knowledge and acquiescence, as we 
indicated above. However, there remained a valid dis-
pute over exactly how detailed such intelligence shar-
ing could be. Hamilton and Boland took the view that 
tactical information of a militarily useful sort was 
prohibited, even if it were for defensive purposes. 
Two months later, the CIA responded to the Chair-
men's request to provide Congress with detailed 
guidelines. On March 18, 1985, Casey wrote to Ham-
ilton and to Senator David Durenberger, Chairman of 
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: 
This is in response to questions raised by the 
Committee regarding the Agency's plans to pro-
vide certain defensive intelligence to opposition 
groups in Nicaragua . . . . We do not intend to 
provide intelligence on any systematic or con-
tinuing basis. Our goal is humanitarian in nature 
and any intelligence we would pass would be 
strictly limited, on a case-by-case basis, to infor-
mation which in general affects the lives of U.S. 
persons or third country noncombatants or which 
suggests that a holocaust-type situation involving 
substantial loss of life may occur.34 
Casey thus indulged Hamilton and Boland temporari-
ly on the specific issue, but presented the CIA's 
guidelines as the Agency's statement about what it 
would do, without conceding the House Chairmen's 
interpretation of what the law required. Until the 
CIA was able to get the law clarified, it behaved in a 
manner consistent with its own guidelines, which 
were drafted, as shown below, to be stricter than the 
law itself. 
Five months later, on August 8, 1985, Congress 
resolved the interpretation dispute in the CIA's favor. 
In the Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal 
1985, Congress said: 
Nothing in this Act, section 8066(a) of the De-
partment of Defense Appropriations Act, 1985 
(as contained in section 101 of Public Law 98-
473), or section 801 of the Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 1985 (Public Law 98-
618) shall be construed to prohibit the United 
States from exchanging information with the Nic-
araguan democratic resistance.35 
Congress did not say it was creating new authority. 
The phrase, "nothing in this act . . . shall be con-
strued to prohibit," is the kind of language Congress 
uses when it is indicating its interpretation of what a 
past law has always meant. The report of the House 
conferees made this abundantly clear: 
The conference committee discussed, and the In-
telligence Committees have clarified, that none of 
the prohibitions on the provision of military or 
paramilitary assistance to the democratic resist-
498 
ance prohibits the sharing of intelligence informa-
tion with the democratic resistance." 
This point was made again in December 1985, 
when Congress again addressed the subject of intelli-
gence sharing. In the Intelligence Authorization and 
Department of Defense Authorization Acts of 1986,37 
Congress permitted the intelligence community to 
provide communications equipment and related train-
ing, and to exchange information with and provide 
advice to the democratic resistance. The conference 
report explained the provision this way: 
The conferees note that under current law and the 
restriction contained in Section 105 of this Con-
ference Report, the intelligence agencies may 
provide advice, including intelligence and coun-
terintelligence information, to the Nicaraguan 
democratic resistance. Section 105 does not 
permit intelligence agencies to engage in activi-
ties, including training other than the communi-
cations training pursuant to Section 105, that 
amount to participation in the planning or execu-
tion of military or paramilitary operations in 
Nicaragua by the Nicaraguan democratic resist-
ance, or to participation in logistics activities inte-
gral to such operations." 
As with the August statute, the statutory history con-
tains a clear reference to words that interpret what 
the law has been and not just what it will be. It is 
clear, therefore, that the law allowed Col. North and 
others to pass intelligence of military value to the 
resistance. 
Advice for and Coordination of the 
Resupply Operation 
The language and legislative history of the Boland 
Amendment, as modified by the "communications" 
and "advice" provisions, also make clear that Col. 
North and other U.S. Government officials could le-
gally provide general advice, coordination, and infor-
mation with respect to the Contra resupply operation 
that began in late 1985. 
The Boland Amendment provides that: 
No funds . . . may be obligated or expended for 
the purpose or which would have the effect of 
supporting, directly or indirectly, military or para-
military operations in Nicaragua. [Emphasis 
added.] 
This language does not prohibit all support, but only 
support of a specific kind. The question that always 
arose, however, was what kind of support would con-
stitute indirect support of a military operation inside 
Nicaragua? After the "communications" and "advice" 
provisions were enacted in 1985, the Chairmen of the 
House and Senate Intelligence Committees disagreed

Approved For Release 2011/05/25 : CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 6 
about their meaning?particularly as they might apply 
to a resupply operation, as opposed to specific mili-
tary or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. 
Rep. Hamilton, in a December 4, 1985, letter, took 
the position that the law prohibited advice about "lo-
gistical operations upon which military or paramili-
tary operations depend." 3 9 Senator Durenberger, in a 
letter dated the next day, however, said that he be-
lieved the law meant to allow just such advice. Faced 
with these conflicting interpretations, the CIA, after a 
careful analysis of the legislative history, chose to 
accept the position that most clearly represented a 
harmonization of the points of difference between the 
two Chambers: 
The legislative history, therefore, seems to draw 
distinctions between, on the one hand, participa-
tion, planning, and providing advice (which 
would not be permitted in support of paramilitary 
operations) and, on the other hand, information 
sharing, including advice on the delivery of sup-
plies . . . . There is no clear indication that Con-
gress intended to prohibit the CIA from giving 
advice on supply operations, and some indication 
that it did intend to distinguish between mere 
information-sharing and actual participation in 
such operations. Furthermore, there would 
appear to be a valid distinction between permissi-
ble, general military resupply operations and op-
erations in the context of specific military oper-
ations, which were not authorized . . . . 
Merely passing intelligence on Sandinista gun or 
radar placements, weather conditions, flight vec-
tors, and other information to assist in the deliv-
ery of supplies for general maintenance of the 
forces in the field would not seem to be prohibit-
ed, both because this would not constitute "par-
ticipation," and because this would not be "inte-
gral" to a "paramilitary operation" as contem-
plated by Congress." 40 
We agree with the legal conclusions reached in this 
memorandum. Based on these conclusions, we would 
argue that virtually all, if not all, of Col. North's 
activities in support of the democratic resistance 
would have been legal even if the Boland Amend-
ment had applied to the NSC. By extension, we be-
lieve that virtually all, if not all, of the activities of 
employees of other executive branch agencies and 
entities that were covered were also legal. The worst 
that can be said of all of these people is that they 
adopted one side of a reasonable dispute over inter-
pretation. In that dispute, the opinions of the Senate 
are every bit as much of a valid indicator of Con-
gress's intention as the House's. There is no way, 
therefore, that behavior undertaken in reliance on the 
Senate's legislative record can fairly be interpreted as 
an intentional flouting of the law.

Chapter 7 
Who Did What To Help The Democratic 
Resistance? 
The public hearings of these Committees presented a 
confusing picture of U.S. assistance to the Nicaraguan 
democratic Resistance during the period of the 
Boland Amendments. The overall impression the 
Committees' majority tried to create was that the 
government was engaged in a massive effort to sub-
vert the law. A careful review shows, however, that 
this simply was not the case. The NSC staff's activi-
ties fell into two basic categories. Some were the 
kinds of diplomatic communication and information 
sharing that Congress may not constitutionally pro-
hibit, even if Congress had intended the Boland 
Amendment to apply to the NSC. Others, with the 
possible exception of the diversion, were in accord-
ance with the law, as we have analyzed it in the 
preceding section. 
Given the nature of the strategic threat in Central 
America, we also believe President Reagan had more 
than a legal right to pursue this course of assistance to 
the Contras. We believe he was correct to have done 
so. The mixed signals Congress was giving indicates 
that many members agreed. Our only regret is that the 
Administration was not open enough with Congress 
about what it was doing. 
We have no intention here of trying to present all 
of the evidence the Committees received about what 
each person did. If we did, our dissent would have to 
be as long as the Committees' narrative. Frankly, we 
believe the mind-numbing detail in that narrative ob-
scures as much as it reveals, leaving readers with 
some fundamentally mistaken impressions. In the fol-
lowing few pages, therefore, we will limit our com-
ments to a broad factual overview to indicate why we 
reach the conclusions we do. 
The President 
President Reagan gave his subordinates strong, clear 
and consistent guidance about the basic thrust of the 
policies he wanted them to pursue toward Nicaragua. 
There is some question and dispute about precisely the 
level at which he chose to follow the operational 
details. There is no doubt, however, about the overall 
management strategy he followed. The President set 
the U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, with few if any 
ambiguities, and then left subordinates more or less 
free to implement it. 
The first crucial step was the President's decision to 
back a December 1981 Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) proposal for covert action. Within a year, the 
policy was covert in name only and Congress began 
passing the first of the Boland Amendments. Never-
theless, when the Kissinger Commission recommend-
ed a more overt policy of support for the Resistance 
in 1984, former National Security Adviser Robert C. 
McFarlane testified that the recommendation was ig-
nored by the President and by Congress.' 
The Administration was aware as early as mid-1984 
that Congress would probably cut off funds to the 
Resistance; the mining incident served as either a 
reason or as a convenient pretext for the cutoff, de-
pending upon one's point of view. The President in-
structed the NSC staff, according to both McFarlane 
and Col. North, as early as the spring of 1984 to keep 
the "body and soul" of the Resistance together until 
Congress could be persuaded to resume support for 
them.2 North testified that he understood this to mean 
specifically, among other things, that he was to keep 
the Contras together in the field as a fighting force.3 
Although McFarlane appears to have interpreted the 
President's desires somewhat more narrowly, McFar-
lane said that the President repeatedly made his gen-
eral desire to support the Resistance known both pri-
vately and publicly.4 
McFarlane and his successor, Admiral John Poin-
dexter, both portrayed the President as having been 
generally aware that the Resistance was receiving 
funds from third countries and from private parties, 
but not of the details of Contra expenditures.6 There 
is no evidence that the President authorized or direct-
ed McFarlane or the NSC staff to contact third coun-
tries in 1984 or 1985 to raise funds for the Resistance. 
There also is no evidence that the President personal-
ly solicited such funds from foreign heads of state, 
and the President has denied having done so.6 How-
ever, it is clear that the President knew such funds 
had been given to the Resistance during 1984-85,7 and 
that he did not tell the NSC staff not to encourage 
such foreign political or financial support. In addition, 
Poindexter said the President considered contributions 
from third countries to be entirely acceptable and

Chapter 7 
thought they should be encouraged.8 But whatever 
the President's precise knowledge or direction of the 
NSC staff's role in encouraging contributions, we are 
firmly convinced that the Constitution protects such di-
plomacy by the President or by any of his designated 
agents?whether on the NSC staff State Department or 
anywhere else. 
The President also knew that some private U.S. 
citizens were giving money to help the democratic 
Resistance?another activity that was perfectly lega1.8 
In 1986, after Congress specifically stated that third 
country solicitations by the State Department were 
not precluded, the President did authorize such a so-
licitation in a National Security Planning Group meet-
ing. That decision that eventually led Secretary of 
State George Shultz and Assistant Secretary Elliott 
Abrams to solicit the Government of Brunei. 
The President's exact knowledge of other aspects of 
the NSC staff's support for the Resistance is less 
clear. The President knew North was the main staff 
officer acting as liaison to the Resistance. The Presi-
dent was briefed by Poindexter about the construction 
of an emergency air field in a neighboring country 
that was to be used for the private Southern Front 
resupply operation," and, according to McFarlane, 
he personally intervened with the head of state of a 
Central American country to obtain release of an 
arms shipment for the Resistance that had been seized 
immediately after a vote in Congress to reject an 
effort to resume Contra funding." On most other 
aspects of the resupply operation and North's military 
advice to the Resistance, the President seems not to 
have been informed of what McFarlane and Poin-
dexter considered to be "details," many of which 
McFarlane denied knowing himself. Again, whatever 
the President's precise level of information, it is clear 
that matters about the President's knowledge of 
which these Committees can be sure?including the 
ones just cited?all fall within the sphere of constitu-
tionally protected diplomatic communication or the 
equally protected speech and encouragement of legal ac-
tivity by U.S. citizens. 
The Vice President 
There is no evidence that Vice President George 
Bush knew about either the Contra resupply effort or 
the diversion of funds to the democratic Resistance. 
The Vice President's staff does acknowledge having 
learned about General Secord's resupply operation 
from Felix Rodriguez in August 1986. The staff mem-
bers informed the relevant agencies, but said they did 
not think the issue warranted informing Bush at the 
time. The testimony all says the subject was not dis-
cussed with the Vice President. Two April scheduling 
memoranda did use the word "resupply" in connec-
tion with one Rodriguez visit to the Vice President's 
office, but there is no reason to infer from a single 
502 
phrase that the Vice President's staff had full knowl-
edge of a subject the NSC staff was deliberately keep-
ing from them. 
Felix Rodriguez 
The one point of connection between the Vice 
President, his staff, and the resupply effort, was Felix 
Rodriguez (also known as Max Gomez) a retired CIA 
officer and personal friend of Donald P. Gregg, the 
Vice President's Assistant for National Security Af-
fairs. Rodriguez was a significant figure in North's 
resupply operation as the facilitator/coordinator of 
private benefactor flights. He had three short personal 
meetings with the Vice President during this time 
period. According to his testimony, all three related 
to his counter-insurgency efforts in Central Amer-
ica.' 2 
The second of these meetings took place on May 1, 
1986, some eight months after Rodriguez began work-
ing with North on the resupply effort and a few 
months after that effort became active.* According to 
his testimony, Rodriguez was fed up with the oper-
ation and was planning to quit." Neither Watson nor 
Gregg had been told about his role at this time, Ro-
driguez said." He had purposely kept that informa-
tion from all others at North's request," and asserted 
that he did not intend to inform the Vice President or 
* The majority in Chapter 3 claims that North employed the 
assistance of other U.S. officials in order to obtain approval from a 
Central American country to serve as the host for the resupply 
operation air base. Thereafter, it strongly suggests that Col. James 
Steele and Donald Gregg, the Vice President's National Security 
Adviser, were those other officials and that very matter was dis-
cussed by the three of them at a meeting on September 10, 1985. 
The reference to a meeting on September 10, 1985, is based 
exclusively on ambiguous notes contained in Col. North's note-
books. Since Col. North was never asked about that meeting or 
those notes, we cannot tell when they were made, let alone wheth-
er they were accurate or reflect a meeting which actually occurred. 
Moreover, despite being subject to lengthy depositions and being 
totally cooperative with these Committees, neither Col. Steele nor 
Mr. Gregg has been asked whether such a meeting ever took place 
and if so, whether the quoted material was discussed. In short, 
there is simply no credible evidence against which the meaning or 
accuracy of these notes has been tested. 
Indeed, the evidence before the Committees, to date, suggests the 
contrary. North recruited Rodriguez to perform the function of 
obtaining support for the use of the Central American country's air 
base, and that he did so, with permission to use North's name. 
North directed Rodriguez not to inform Gregg and his office about 
this (Rodriguez's) involvement, and he didn't. Moreover, the major-
ity's own account of events indicates that Rodriguez was first 
considered by North as a possible source of assistance when Col. 
Steele suggested that. idea on September 16, 1985; 6 days after this 
supposed meeting between North, Steele, and Gregg. Therefore, 
there is no evidence to suggest that North's private resupply oper-
ation was discussed on September 10. And finally, the reference 
made in Chapter 3 to Gregg not knowing about a resupply oper-
ation prior to the summer of 1986 is not even accurate. A close 
reading of the very pages cited by the majority to Gregg's deposi-
tion indicates that he admitted to knowing in early 1986 about an 
informal, non-lethal, supply operation funded by American citizens.

Chapter 7 
his staff about the effort on May 1.16 Nevertheless, a 
scheduling proposal dated April 6, and a very short 
April 30 briefing memorandum, described the purpose 
of the meeting as being, in part, to provide a briefing 
about "resupply of the Contras." 7 It is not clear how 
this language got into these documents.* Whatever 
the explanation, the people present at the meeting?
former Senator Nicholas Brady, Gregg, Colonel 
Samuel J. Watson III (Gregg's deputy), and Rodri-
guez?all said they were certain resupply never was 
discussed with the Vice President," and the Commit-
tees have no reason to doubt these statements. Neither 
do the Committees have any reason to suspect that 
Watson or Gregg knew about North's involvement at 
this time. 
Let us shift focus now to August 1986.** On 
August 8, Rodriguez met with Gregg and Watson and 
told them about North's involvement with the resup-
ply operation and possible profiteering by Secord and 
his associates.*** Rodriguez's disclosures on the 
eighth of August, and Gregg's ensuing conversations 
with North's deputy, Robert Earl, prompted Gregg to 
call a multi-agency meeting on August 12 to alert the 
agencies of the problems Rodriguez felt deserved 
their attention." In other words, when Bush's staff 
became aware that some aspects of the resupply effort 
might be harmful to the Resistance, the staff met with 
the appropriate agencies (State, CIA and Defense) 
and told them of the potential problem. Gregg did 
not, however, bring the matter to the Vice President's 
personal attention. 
? Phyllis Byrne, the secretary in the Vice President's offices who 
typed these memos, testified that after Rodriguez had requested the 
appointment, she asked Colonel Watson about the visit's purpose. 
She said that Watson gave her the language she used for the 
"purpose" section of the scheduling proposal when she typed it on 
April 14. Two weeks later she simply reused the same language for 
the Vice President's scheduling memorandum. (Byrne deposition, 
June 16, pp. 12-13.) Colonel Watson has testified not only that he 
has no recollection of providing Ms. Byrne with that information, 
but reiterated that he would have had no reason at that time to 
connect Rodriguez with resupply at all. Furthermore, Watson said 
that he had no recollection of reviewing the scheduling memoran-
dum either alone or with Rodriguez before the meeting. (Watson 
deposition, June 16, pp. 27-40.) Similarly, Gregg does not remem-
ber reading that language at either the proposal or memorandum 
stages, and says he would never have phrased such a discussion in 
that manner. (Gregg deposition, May 18, pp. 32-33.) 
**Watson's notes, which were exhibits to his deposition, indicate 
that three times during the first week of August 1986, either North 
or Earl made resupply-related references to Watson regarding Ro-
driguez's activities in Central America. Each time, according to 
Watson, he asked about the statements, only to be rebuffed. 
(Watson Dep., 6/16/87, at 43-55.) Ironically, the apparent purpose 
of these asides, according to Watson, was to get him (and Gregg) 
to "admonish" Rodriguez about whatever it was he was supposedly 
doing to harm the resupply effort. 
***According to all three, however, Rodriguez did not outline 
his own resupply role until December 1986, weeks after North had 
been reassigned. (Rodriguez Test., Hearings, 100-3 5/27/87, at 315; 
Rodriguez Dep., 5/1/87 at 43; Watson Dep., 6/16/87 at 34; Gregg 
Dep., 5/18/87 at 81. 
National Security Council Staff 
Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter appear to 
have had different views of what the President 
wanted, and what the law would allow, the NSC staff 
to do. It is important to be clear, however, that with 
the possible exception of some small fraction of NSC 
staff salaries, overhead, and small amounts of travel 
expenses?all of which could legitimately have been 
used in any event to maintain contact by the NSC 
staff with the Resistance leadership and others?no 
appropriated funds were devoted to the efforts dis-
cussed below. 
Robert McFarlane testified that he believed (1) that 
the NSC staff was covered by the Boland Amend-
ment, and (2) that one of the principal purposes of the 
amendment was to prevent the government from rais-
ing funds in support of the Resistance.2? He testified 
that he took this position for political reasons, not on 
the basis of an analysis of the law.2' It should be 
noted, however, that although McFarlane says he was 
quite vocal on the point of NSC coverage, Command-
er Paul Thompson, formerly the NSC's legal counsel, 
has a different recollection. Thompson said that he 
remembers a discussion in which he and McFarlane 
considered whether the NSC might conceivably be 
covered and then decided that the issue was moot 
because nothing the NSC staff was doing would be a 
violation even if it were covered.22 Thompson also 
remembered a conversation with Bretton Sciaroni, the 
counsel for the Intelligence Oversight Board. 
I told him that we at NSC Staff had already 
determined that the NSC Staff was not an intelli-
gence agency under that definition. But the real 
message I left with him was that McFarlane had 
already represented to the members of Congress 
that whether or not we were subject to the 
Boland Amendment, we considered ourselves 
subject to it, or words to that effect. The reason 
being that Mr. McFarlane had already made the 
determination that we had not violated the 
Boland Amendment, so it was almost a moot 
argument to make." 
Whatever McFarlane's contemporaneously ex-
pressed view of the Boland Amendment might have 
been, he testified that his understanding of the role of 
the NSC staff was that it was limited to providing 
political support and direction for the Resistance 
movement, and did not include fundraising.24 He also 
specifically denied that the President intended him to 
provide military assistance to the Contras." Poin-
dexter testified, however, that he was familiar with, 
and approved the details, of North's work as a 
"switching point" for activities related to the demo-
cratic Resistance advice.26 Poindexter also said that 
the President was generally aware of North's role, 
503

I I II 1

Chapter 7 
and that he believed the President had implicitly au-
thorized the NSC staff's efforts." 
Whatever the differences in their understandings, 
McFarlane and Poindexter both chose North to carry 
out their instructions. North claimed his activities 
throughout were fully authorized. McFarlane claimed 
that several of North's actions during his tenure were 
not authorized, but Poindexter said that he had gener-
ally authorized North's actions. 
During McFarlane's tenure as National Security 
Adviser and after the previously appropriated funds 
had been used up in or about June of 1984, the Na-
tional Security Council Staff engaged in a series of 
activities described below. 
Fundraising From Third Countries 
Beginning in June of 1984, Country Two provided 
what ultimately amounted to $32 million for support 
of the Resistance; the support was provided at the 
level of $1 million per month in 1984, and then in a 
lump sum of $25 million in early 1985. It is clear from 
the hearing record that the NSC staff was engaged in 
an effort to encourage Country Two, and other third 
countries, to support the Contra cause, both political-
ly and financially. Even though McFarlane and North 
both claim not to have "solicited" funds, McFarlane 
personally encouraged contributions, unsuccessfully 
from Country One and successfully from Country 
Two. North, occasionally using Gaston Sigur who 
was then on the NSC staff, General Secord and Gen-
eral Singlaub, encouraged contributions from several 
other countries as well. It is important to note, how-
ever, that there is no evidence of any kind in the 
records of the Committees which suggests that any 
quid pro quo was sought or received in return for any 
third country contribution to the Resistance. 
Raising Private Funds in Support of the 
Resistance 
Beginning in the spring of 1985, a group of private 
individuals began to raise funds to support the Contra 
cause. North met with the fundraisers and their poten-
tial contributors, alone and in small and larger groups, 
and helped acquaint these groups with the 
humanitarian and military needs as well as the politi-
cal and military situation of the Resistance. In addi-
tion, North helped to arrange White House briefings 
for certain groups of contributors on a few occasions; 
the President spoke at some of these briefings. The 
President believed, and was consistently briefed, that 
the private groups were using their funds to purchase 
television advertising to promote the Contra cause 
and to engage in other such public awareness pro-
grams on behalf of Administration policies. There is 
no evidence that North was aware of people using the 
promise of such meetings to obtain contributions of a 
certain minimum amount. Generally, North did not 
personally solicit funds from contributors, although 
504 
the record is clear that he was acting in general 
concert with individuals who were soliciting funds 
and that he did direct the disposition of some of the 
funds so raised. From the record, it also appears that 
the nature of North's presentations to groups was that 
he tried to present the reasons behind the President's 
policy of support for the democratic Resistance and 
opposition to the Sandinistas. These presentations ap-
parently were similar, if not identical to ones he gave 
to many other groups of noncontributors to persuade 
them to support the President's policy. 
Assisting in Arms Purchases and Humanitarian 
Supplies 
During McFarlane's tenure as NSC Adviser, North 
asked General Secord, by then a private citizen, to 
assist the Contras in their arms procurements. North 
met with Secord and, on other occasions, with Gener-
al Singlaub to obtain their assistance as private citi-
zens. The arms were purchased with third country or 
private funds. It seems clear that Colonel North dis-
cussed the proposed procurements with Resistance 
leaders, and also made his own suggestions for appro-
priate procurements. 
North appears to have had detailed knowledge 
about what was being shipped, and the shipment de-
tails necessary to coordinate air drops with the Resist-
ance. In fact, there is evidence that North intervened 
on at least one occasion with officials of a foreign 
country to persuade them to allow a proposed ship-
ment of arms which had been purchased with private 
funds to proceed." McFarlane testified during his 
second appearance that he did not regard these activi-
ties as having been authorized by him." 
Giving Military Advice to the Democratic 
Resistance 
In addition, during McFarlane's tenure and during 
the period of the most restrictive Boland Amendment, 
North appears to have given strategic military advice 
to the democratic Resistance. Secord testified that 
North actively participated in a "program review" 
meeting in Miami in July 1985, a principal purpose of 
which was to discuss the overall military situation of 
the Resistance and to decide how their military effort 
should be reoriented.30 North provided military 
advice of a general nature to the Resistance on the 
other occasion as well." McFarlane claimed he was 
not informed of the Miami "program review" meeting 
by North, or of other specific occasions on which 
North gave military advice, although he also testified 
that he did not regard such advice as central to the 
Boland Amendment's restrictions." North specifical-
ly denied having given tactical military advice on 
specific military operations.33

Chapter 7 
Giving Intelligence to the Democratic Resistance 
During the entire period of the Boland Amend-
ment's restrictions, both the CIA and the NSC were 
expected to continue obtaining information about the 
activities of the democratic Resistance as part of their 
normally assigned duties. Obtaining detailed 
knowledge about the Resistance by all normal intelli-
gence gathering methods, including direct conversa-
tions with Contra leaders, was clearly consistent with 
the law at all times. 
During McFarlane's tenure, North provided intelli-
gence to the Resistance by conveying information 
provided to him by certain officials of the Central 
Intelligence Agency who testified they did not know 
North was passing it to the Contras. Some of the 
information was principally of military significance, 
and was provided for defensive purposes, while other 
information could have been used for humanitarian 
purposes as well. The CIA could not have passed the 
information directly, under the agency's own cease 
and desist order, which, as we indicated earlier, went 
well beyond the requirements of the Boland Amend-
ment. North also developed an informal intelligence 
source of his own in the person of Robert Owen, 
whom he used as a secret courier and transfer agent 
for cash and intelligence. 
Private Air Resupply Network 
In the fall of 1985 after the "program review" 
meeting in Miami, North approached Secord to devel-
op a privately funded private air resupply network to 
support the Resistance. General Secord proceeded to 
establish this network during late 1985 and ran it 
through early October 1986, when a resupply airplane 
carrying Eugene Hasenfus was shot down over Nica-
ragua. This air resupply network delivered both lethal 
and humanitarian cargo to Contra forces operating 
within Nicaragua. The air resupply network was 
funded by private contributions, the Iran arms sales 
and some third country funds. 
As part of the development of the resupply net-
work, North, through other U.S. officials in Central 
America, such as CIA station chief "Tomas Castillo" 
and Ambassador Lewis Tambs, sought the creation of 
an emergency airstrip in a neighboring Central Amer-
ican country. It appears that this was done with Ad-
miral Poindexter's approval; McFarlane, who had es-
sentially left the NSC by then, claimed he did not 
know about the airstrip or about instructions to Am-
bassador Tambs to open a "Southern Front." 
34McFarlane testified that North did not tell him 
about Secord's involvement in this resupply network, 
though he stated that North did indicate that "occa-
sionally" air deliveries were made to the Resistance. 
McFarlane denied he had authorized North to direct 
the air resupply of arms to the Contras.35 Poindexter 
said he was aware of the air resupply network. He 
regarded it as a byproduct of Colonel North's other 
efforts for the Resistance, within the scope of the 
President's direction to the NSC staff.36 In the course 
of the resupply effort, North provided some people 
with KL-43 encryption devices. This occurred after 
the law was changed to permit intelligence agencies 
to provide communication assistance and information 
to the Resistance. 
Conclusion 
In sum, the NSC's activities, aside from its normal 
duties, generally fell into two categories. One in-
volved information sharing with the democratic Re-
sistance and encouraging contributions that?with the 
possible exception of the diversion?were perfectly 
legal. Activities such as these could not constitutional-
ly have been prohibited by statute. The second cate-
gory involved North's military advice to the Resist-
ance and detailed coordination of the resupply effort. 
Since the NSC was not covered by the Boland 
Amendment, these activities were clearly legal. But 
even if one assumes the NSC were covered, we 
showed earlier that the amendment did not prohibit 
general military advice and resupply coordination. 
Some of these latter activities, however, perhaps 
could have been reached by Congress without violat-
ing the Constitution. It was to protect these unpopu-
lar, but legal activities from possibly being made ille-
gal that we believe the NSC staff misled Congress. 
There is no evidence that the President knew more 
than general information about this side of North's 
activities, or anything at all about the deceptions of 
Congress. 
State Department 
Little or no evidence surfaced during these hearings 
to suggest that the State Department was used wit-
tingly or unwittingly to circumvent the Boland 
Amendment. Individuals such as Louis Tambs (Am-
bassador to Costa Rica) and Robert Owen (who had a 
contract relationship with UNO under a grant agree-
ment with the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance 
Office, or NHAO) did assist North with the resupply 
effort, but this was done without the knowledge and 
blessing of their superiors at the Department. Owen's 
assistance arguably took place during his "off" hours, 
but Tambs' assistance with the establishment of the 
Point West airfield was clearly done in the course of 
his long, ambassadorial day. Even Tambs' activities, 
however, fell within the normal, legal and constitution-
ally protected scope of activity for an ambassador. His 
error was to bypass his superiors in the State Depart-
ment by reporting outside channels to North.* That

is, the error?like that of a CIA station chief, "Tomas 
Castillo"?was a matter of violating his own depart-
ment's policy rather than violating the law. 
Robert Owen's activities received a great deal of 
attention during the early days our public hearings. 
The examination of his role during the period of his 
NHAO contract seem to proceed upon two suspi-
cions: (1) that North had placed Owen in the NHAO 
program to be his eyes and ears in Central America; 
and (2) that North had also done this to gain access to 
NHAO facilities to assist the covert resupply effort. 
The major problem was how to reconcile his "off-
hours" assistance with lethal aid drops, with the hu-
manitarian purposes NHAO was designed to accom-
plish. The Boland Amendment clearly would have 
prohibited the use of NHAO resources for lethal as-
sistance, and Owen did not step over that line. As a 
limitation on appropriations, the Boland Amendment 
does not cover a person's private time. However, 
Owen's contract with NHAO reads as if it may well 
have prohibited such off-hours activity, even if the 
Boland Amendment did not.37 In any event, Owen 
was not totally forthright with the State Department 
about the assistance he gave North. In that respect, he 
joins a long list of people whom North persuaded to 
work outside normal channels. 
Elliott Abrams 
The main State Department focus of the Nicaragua 
side of the Committees' investigation, however, was 
Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-
American Affairs. Abrams was the main spokesman 
for the Contra program.38 As chairman of the Re-
stricted Interagency Group (RIG), Abrams therefore 
was a natural object of suspicion for those opposed to 
Contra aid. 
The theory that seemed to structure the investiga-
tion of Abrams' role was that he either knowingly 
assisted and advised North, or that he realized what 
North was doing but ignored it to let North keep the 
Resistance alive while the Administration fought for 
renewed Congressional aid. There was a third possi-
bility testified to by Abrams, however: that North 
effectively kept Abrams in the dark. The evidence 
more clearly substantiates what Abrams said than 
either of the other, more conspiratorial theories. In 
this respect, Abrams was more of a victim than a co-
conspirator. He was deliberately kept uninformed by 
North and Poindexter, just as were the President, 
Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger, the Intelligence 
Oversight Board's Bretton Sciaroni, and the United 
States Congress. 
Abrams was not engaged in any conduct that even 
remotely qualified as a violation of the Boland prohi-
saw to it that troops were sent to the embassy in Colombia to 
protect Tambs when his life was threatened by drug dealers. Tambs

bitions or of any other law.* Indeed, on the one 
occasion he was presented with information about the 
activities of the CIA's Tomas Castillo, he immediately 
went to the Secretary of State". This happened 
about three weeks after Hasenfus's airplane had been 
shot down. During this period, Abrams appears to 
have been misled by North and by CIA officials. As a 
result, he repeatedly informed Congress, the press and 
the Secretary, to his later chagrin, that there was no 
Government involvement with the resupply effort.4? 
As he himself said during our hearings, his statements 
were "completely honest and completely wrong"41. 
So convincing was Abram's testimony on this point in 
our hearings that Senators Rudman and Mitchell, and 
House Vice Chairman Fascell, characterized Abrams 
as having been hung out to dry.** 
An even better barometer of the extent to which 
Abrams had been kept in the dark by North was his 
testimony regarding his knowledge of critical key 
players and their involvement in the resupply effort 
and in the Southern Front. With regard to the resup-
ply, Abrams testified that he did not know General 
Secord, Robert Dutton, Richard Gadd, Rafael Quin-
tero or Felix Rodriguez, let alone what role they 
were playing in the resupply effort.'" He stated cate-
gorically that neither he nor anyone else at State 
knew that Owen, in his "off-hours", was assisting 
North in coordinating lethal drops to the Resistance. 
He asserted that if he or anyone at State had known 
this, Owen would have been fired immediately.43 
There is no evidence to challenge those assertions, 
nor were they challenged by the Committees. 
Some on these Committees questioned whether 
Abrams lived up to the instructions Secretary Shultz 
gave him to "Monitor 011ie".44 Underlying the ques-
tions seems to have been an assumption that Abrams 
knowingly averted his glance. To reach this conclu-
sion, however, one has to believe that everyone in 
government always should act on the assumption that 
his or her colleagues are potential liars. Business 
would then be conducted through investigative tech-
* A clear indication of the extent to which the State Department 
attempted to comply with the Boland Amendment is the level of 
debate within the NHAO program over what constituted humani-
tarian aid. As Elliott Abrams testified: 
"This was not something we did carelessly. I remember . . . 
Ambassador Deumling coming to a RIG meeting and saying 
the Contras have asked for wrist watches, can I pay for wrist 
watches. . . . This was deadly serious because of the legal 
restrictions. We actually debated. Of course, wrist watches 
weren't lethal aid, but were they humanitarian aid? . . . We 
ultimately decided . . . wrist watches were okay." Abrams

chapter 7 of the Majority Report, Assistant Secretary Abrams is 
quoted as having admmitted to these Committees that certain state-
ments that had been made by him were "completely wrong." For 
some reason, the majority failed to point out that Abrams preceded 
that admission by noting that while the statements were completely 
wrong, they were "completely honest." Id. at 65.

niques rather than through normal comity. Congress 
does not apply this standard when it looks at Admin-
istration presentations to Congressional Committees, 
nor should it apply it to relationships inside the Ad-
ministration. Abrams?like Secretaries Shultz and 
Weinberger on the Iran initiative, and like several 
Committees of Congress that asked about North's 
Contra assistance?proceeded on the assumption that 
his colleagues were telling him the truth. If they were 
not, the blame surely belongs more to the deceiver 
than the deceived. 
The other major area of inquiry regarding Abrams 
was his November 25, 1986 testimony before the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the clear-
ly lawful solicitation of funds from Brunei. With 
regard to the solicitation itself, the only problem that 
seemed to raise any concern during the hearings was 
the fact that Abrams gave the Brunei representative a 
mistyped Swiss bank account number that was pro-
vided by Colonel North instead of using another 
number supplied by the Chief of the CIA's Central 
American Task Force. The account number North 
intended to give Abrams was one controlled by Gen-
eral Secord and Albert Hakim. However, despite 
theories and suspicions to the contrary, Abrams' se-
lection of that account, on the advice and with the 
blessing of his superiors at State, was based on his 
belief that it was an account controlled by the Resist-
ance. His selection of that account was not part of a 
clandestine venture calculated to assist Lake Re-
sources and the Secord-Hakim enterprise.45 
There is no question that Abrams exercised very 
poor judgment in his SSCI testimony by attempting 
to answer questions regarding third country fundrais-
ing in a technically correct, but misleading, manner to 
protect the confidence of Brunei. Abrams himself de-
scribed it as an indefensible and foolish act that he 
greatly regretted." He surely could have asked the 
Senators to let him refrain from answering the ques-
tion until he had a chance to discuss the matter with 
the Secretary. Ultimately, Abrams apologized to the 
Senate Intelligence Committee for his error, six 
months before these hearings began.47 
The CIA's Role 
The Central Intelligence Agency was not a major 
player in the Administration's efforts to help the Nic-
araguan Resistance during the period of the prohibito-
ry Boland Amendments. That was partly because the 
amendments explicitly limited the CIA and other in-
telligence agencies. In addition, the CIA, as an 
agency, wanted to avoid even coming close to the 
edge of the law. As Admiral Poindexter said in our 
public hearings, "They wanted to be careful and Di-
rector Casey was very sensitive to this, they wanted 
to keep hands-off as much as they could." 48 
Of course, the agency could not simply keep hands 
off. For one thing, it was expected throughout this 
period to continue intelligence gathering and political 
support for the Resistance. At the same time, the CIA 
felt it had to be responsive both to Congress's man-
date and to the Administration's strong support for 
the Contras. The result was an extremely difficult 
situation for career professionals who had to imple-
ment policy at the operational level. The Chief of the 
Central American Task Force described his feelings 
this way: 
I knew almost from the beginning that I was 
caught between the dynamics of a giant nutcrack-
er of the Legislative on the one hand and the 
Executive on the other, and I was in the center 
of a very exposed position.49 
The agency had been traumatized during the post-
Vietnam Congressional investigations of the 1970s. 
The Latin American division was traumatized once 
again when five reprimands were issued as a result of 
the agency's role in helping to prepare a manual for 
the Resistance that some interpreted as talking about 
assassination,50 a technique the U.S. was explicitly 
prohibited from using. As a result, the CIA was very 
concerned throughout this period with protecting 
itself, and the government's future intelligence capa-
bility, from political retaliation." Two different ef-
fects flowed from this. First, as a matter of internal 
policy, the CIA regularly issued extremely conserva-
tive guidelines that avoided taking legally defensible 
actions for political reasons. Second, we believe this 
posture, and Director Casey's own protective feelings 
toward the agency, contributed to Casey's decision to 
work closely with Col. North. 
Because of their efforts to avoid both sides of the 
nutcracker, four of the CIA's career civil servants 
find themselves the subject of persistent reports sug-
gesting that their careers may now be on the line. The 
four include (1)"Tomas Castillo" (a pseudonym), who 
was chief of station in a Central American country, 
(2)the Chief of the Central American Task Force, 
("C/CATF") (3)Duane (Dewey) Clarridge and 
(4)Clair George, the deputy director for operations 
(DD0). Castillo is now on duty pending a final deter-
mination of his status. The others have been the sub-
ject of press reports. We discuss the major allegation 
about Clarridge in our section on the legal issues 
raised by the Iran initiative. For the others, the main 
questions all grow out of the CIA's relationship with 
the Nicaraguan democratic Resistance during the time 
of the Boland Amendments. 
There is substantial conflict in the testimony we 
have received, particularly between Castillo and Task 
Force Chief. It is impossible for us to resolve all of 
these conflicts in our own minds. Our bottom line 
judgments, however, are as follows:

Chapter 7 
?The CIA tried as an organization to work within 
the Boland Amendment, and succeeded. 
?The essential dispute between Task Force Chief 
and Castillo is whether Task Force Chief's policy 
guidelines were clearly articulated, whether Castillo 
overstepped those guidelines, and whether Castillo 
properly informed his superiors of what he was doing. 
?The policy guidelines themselves, which should 
have been written more clearly, were issued for politi-
cal reasons, and not because Task Force Chief 
thought Castillo had overstepped the CIA's legal au-
thority.52 
?Finally, we do not believe these individuals de-
serve to pay with their own careers for the political 
guerrilla warfare that was going on over Nicaragua 
between the President and a vacillating Congress. 
We will not dwell on the legal issues here. At the 
end of the Boland Amendment chapter, we discussed 
an internal CIA legal memorandum with which we 
agree. That memorandum, it will be remembered, 
argued that it was legal for the CIA to: 
provide information involving safe delivery sites, 
weather conditions, hostile risk assessments and 
the like to assist the Nicaraguan Resistance in 
their resupply activities where the CIA's role did 
not amount to participating in the actual delivery 
of material or in planning, directing, or otherwise 
coordinating deliveries during the course of or in 
the context of specific military engagement." 
This legal opinion should have been written in early 
1986, instead of a year later.54 But it was not, and 
people had to make judgments on the ground. We 
believe their judgments were legally correct. Never-
theless, a few of them have been controversial. 
In judging the agency's activities to support the 
Resistance, it is important to keep the level of assist-
ance in perspective. Tomas Castillo was the CIA offi-
cial who worked most directly with the Resistance's 
private resupply network. He apparently was far 
more active in this respect, for example, than the 
passive stance of the CIA elsewhere in Central Amer-
ica. Despite this, he has testified that he spent only 
about one-tenth of one percent of his time in 1986 
facilitating the resupply effort.55 
The Task Force Chief was a member of the Re-
stricted Interagency Group, or RIG, along with 
Abrams and North. In this capacity, he had plenty of 
opportunity to see how North had become the "point 
man" for the Administration's Contra policy. Accord-
ing to the Task Force Chief, constant feuding among 
RIG members before Abrams became Assistant Secre-
tary, eventually led to a situation in which power 
gravitated toward North." In addition, North man-
aged to develop a relationship with Castillo,* in 
* As with Tambs, North developed a personal friendship with 
Castillo. The North and Castillo families vacationed together in 
February 1986. See Castillo Test., Hearings, 100-4, 5/29/87, at 8. 
508 
which Castillo?like Ambassador Tambs?was willing 
to work with North outside of normal channels. Cas-
tillo said he disagreed with the Task Force Chief on 
various policy matters and hoped he could get his 
voice heard through North.57 North claimed that 
Casey knew Castillo reported to North." 
The relationships between Castillo, North and the 
Task Force Chief obviously led to some misunder-
standings and missed communications. The main 
issues on which these Committees focused were the 
development of an emergency airfield and Castillo's 
role in passing useful overflight intelligence to the 
private suppliers. The last issue also has led to a 
dispute over the Task Force Chiefs instructions to 
Castillo and Castillo's response. 
Southern Front Air Strip 
Castillo and the Task Force Chief corroborate each 
other, and the other evidence we have seen, on the 
absence of a significant CIA role in conjunction with 
the construction of a privately owned, emergency 
landing strip to help the Southern Front resupply 
effort. Castillo did admit that he was "probably" the 
first to have the idea that the air strip should be 
built.59 Castillo testified that a resupply operation was 
a logistical necessity to supply the insurgents he 
wanted to see moved out of a neighboring country 
into Nicaragua. He considered the move to be impor-
tant politically, because the Resistance's presence in 
the other country was causing resentment in that 
other country." The airstrip was in turn required for 
the success of the resupply operation. 
Castillo himself, upon specific instructions from the 
CIA," took no concrete steps to assist in the plan to 
construct an airstrip, other than to visit potential sites 
on one occasion, on his own decision, as an observer 
with Robert Owen." Castillo specifically denied that 
he instructed Ambassador Tambs to seek authoriza-
tion for the airstrip from local officials." He testified 
that Ambassador Tambs' goals with respect to cre-
ation of a Southern Front were based on instructions 
Tambs received from Oliver North, but Castillo 
denied North asked for the airstrip." Castillo felt his 
role was "passively [to] monitor" the activities of the 
private benefactors with respect to the airstrip; he 
knew those activities were being coordinated by 
North. 6 5 
The Task Force Chiefs testimony parallels Castil-
lo's on these points. There is no evidence to indicate 
that the Task Force Chief, on his own or on behalf of 
the Agency, instructed or suggested to anyone, that 
Castillo should establish a Southern Front for the 
Contras. He categorically denied (as did Elliott 
Abrams) ever knowing about, let alone agreeing to, 
North's alleged discussion with Tambs and Castillo 
about the necessity for opening a Southern Front." 
Indeed, the first time he can recall learning about the 
airstrip was in a brief conversation with Castillo at a

Chapter 7 
meeting on December 9, 1985. The Task Force 
Chiefs best recollection was that he was "worried 
and concerned" when Castillo indicated that it was 
being built and that Castillo did not mention who was 
doing the building. He simply assumed that it was 
being built by the private benefactors and the Task 
Force Chief cautioned Castillo to make sure that 
whatever he was doing was legal." 
Several months afterward, when North started 
showing pictures of the work being done on the air-
strip at the conclusion of a meeting of Administration 
officials, the Task Force Chief had to pull him aside 
to caution him about the wisdom of showing such 
pictures. It was at that point that the Task Force 
Chief became concerned that North might not only 
be exceeding the boundaries of the politically accepta-
ble in his dealings with this highly controversial pro-
gram, but flaunting it before others. He realized he 
did not have the power to control North. "I was 
going to keep the agency and myself within the 
bounds of propriety and legality," but "there were 
things that were beyond my powers." 68 
Providing Intelligence for Air Resupply 
In February 1986, General Secord complained to Di-
rector Casey that the air resupply effort was not get-
ting any help from the Central American Task 
Force." At about this same time, in February, North 
distributed KL-43 communications encryption de-
vices that he had obtained from the National Security 
Agency to Secord, five people in Secord's resupply 
network and Castillo. North also kept one for him-
self.70 It should be noted that these devices were 
distributed after Congress, in December 1985, passed 
a law specifically authorizing intelligence agencies to 
share intelligence with the Resistance, and to spend 
money to help the Resistance with communications. 
Castillo testified that he received a KL-43 machine 
from North, through Rafael Quintero, in order to 
relay drop zone information between the Southern 
Front Commanders to the private benefactors." 
From this point forward, Castillo was described by 
both General Secord and Robert Dutton as having 
been very helpful?Dutton used the word "critical"?
to the resupply effort.72 Castillo's facilitation of the 
efforts of the resupply operation involved the passing 
of information such as the location of proposed drop 
zones and times back and forth from the southern 
front commanders to the private benefactors." 
During the Spring, Castillo also requested intelligence 
such as hostile risk assessments and flight vectors 
from the CIA to support the flight activities, and filed 
intelligence reports concerning the results of these 
activities.74 Castillo specifically denied that he was 
involved in the planning of any of the resupply 
flights." He also denied, in response to a point made 
by Dutton, that there was any United States Govern-
ment involvement in obtaining permission for the re-
fueling of two resupply flights at a Central American 
country airport. 7 6 
Castillo testified that the Chief of the Latin Ameri-
can Division ("Division Chief') and the Task Force 
Chief knew of his activities,77 and the above cited 
cable traffic from the Spring would bear him out. The 
first successful lethal air drop was in April, and was 
supported by cabled intelligence from headquarters. 
No one in the operations directorate knew, however, 
about the KL-43 until the Division Chief designate's 
maiden visit to the country in April 1986.78 Castillo 
testified that he asked the new Division Chief for 
assurance that relaying information with the KL-43 
between the private benefactors and the Resistance 
was legal under the Boland Amendments. He said 
that the Division Chief designate assured him he 
would look into it upon returning to Washington." 
The Task Force Chief testified that his superior, the 
Division Chief, never informed him of this discussion 
with Castillo.8? The Task Force Chief also said that 
he did not know about Castillo's direct contact with 
the private benefactors until a May 1986 CIA offi-
cials' meeting that he, Castillo and the Division Chief 
attended. He said he was surprised to learn at that 
meeting how closely Castillo had been dealing with 
the private benefactors." At the meeting, Castillo 
said that he let it be known that he thought the fact 
that he was the communications link between head-
quarters, the Resistance and the supply operation, pre-
sented a "problem." He suggested, therefore, that the 
agency train someone from the Resistance to take 
over that role.82 
On May 28, the Task Force Chief sent Castillo the 
following message: 
[Headquarters] wishes to reaffirm with . . . 
guidelines that no repeat no . . . materiel or 
monetary support can be provided to UNO/FDN 
or UNO/South representatives. . . . can provide 
advice and commo [communication] equipment 
as approved by hqs. and can engage in intelli-
gence exchange as approved by hqs.83 
After this cable, the agency worked to find and 
train an UNO communicator. At this point, the Presi-
dent's $100 million aid package was going through 
the Congress. On June 24, a Resolution of Inquiry 
into North's support of the Resistance was filed in the 
House, in a move whose timing was obviously meant 
to influence floor votes. The next day the House, in a 
major reversal, voted an aid package for the Contras. 
On July 12, just 17 days after the House vote, the 
Task Force Chief sent a vaguely worded, confusing 
cable that read, in part, as follows: 
Headquarters has reviewed our commitment to 
provide secure communications. . . . We have 
taken a second look at the commo link. To date 
we have maintained our distance from the private

benefactors (PB) who are providing assistance to

all of the allegations floating around are 
false. . . . We have come too far at this time to 
let the solid operations that [deleted] has built to 
be jeopardized by elements which we are unable 
to contro1.8 4 
The Task Force Chief and Castillo have very dif-
ferent interpretations of this cable. The Task Force 
Chief says it was a "cease and desist" order, especial-
ly in light of the one he had sent in the end of May.85 
It is interesting to note, however, what it was he was 
supposed to cease and desist doing. The Task Force 
Chief describes the cable as telling Castillo, in effect, 
to break all contact with the private benefactors." 
Based on his own testimony, the Task Force Chief 
assumed Castillo would still continue to get informa-
tion to the resupply operation, but would work di-
rectly with the Resistance rather than the private 
benefactors.87 
Castillo, in contrast, saw it as saying that what he 
was doing "to date" was acceptable. The outstanding 
feature of the cable, from his point of view, was that 
headquarters was telling him he was not going to get 
a communicator, but seemed to expect him to contin-
ue to be ready to get intelligence information to the 
resuppliers. "They were satisfying their situation, but 
not mine," Castillo said.88 
As we read the cable, in context, the following 
points seem to stand out: (1) Headquarters was con-
cerned primarily about the current legislative situation 
in Congress, and with representations that had been 
made to Congress. The concern, in other words, was 
political rather than legal. (2) Castillo had to address 
a tough set of problems on the ground. (3) The cable 
was not written clearly, if the intent was "cease and 
desist." Cease and desist orders can be, and often are, 
written simply without all of this cable's ambiguities. 
(4) If the Task Force Chief was trying to tell Castillo 
to use an UNO "cutout" to pass information to the 
resuppliers, he should have said so clearly. Of course, 
there would have been no legal difference between 
working directly with the suppliers or indirectly, 
through the Resistance. The difference, as seen by the 
Task Force Chief, was a domestic U.S. political one. 
We want to make clear, as we interpret the cable, 
that we are not disputing the Task Force Chiefs 
statements about his intentions. If we assume both the 
Task Force Chief and Castillo are telling the truth, as 
seems likely to us, it would mean that the Chief sent a 
poorly worded cable that let the sender and receiver 
reach different conclusions, with each reading his 
own problems and preferences into its meaning. The 
510 
problem, in other words, appears to us to have been 
one of missed communications. That would not be the 
first time this has happened, nor will it be the last. 
Administrative errors such as these should not force 
the end of a career. 
Congressional Testimony of October 
1986 
In September, when the Task Force Chief learned of 
the final airdrops coordinated by Castillo, he assumed 
that Castillo must have somehow found a way to 
assist without being in the middle of the operation 
and thereby placing the Agency at political risk." 
The political problem came to a head in mid-October, 
after Eugene Hasenfus' airplane was shot down, when 
one of the Agency's people learned that Castillo had 
used a KL-43. Upon relaying that information to the 
Task Force Chief and Division Chief, an internal in-
vestigation was instituted. 
Assistant Secretary of State Abrams was informed, 
on October 23, of this potential U.S. Government 
involvement in this network." Abrams immediately 
informed the Secretary of State about this surprise 
turn of events which potentially undercut his prior 
Congressional testimony and media statements that 
there was no United States Government involvement 
with Hasenfus or with the resupply effort. This may 
have been particularly surprising to Abrams, because 
the Task Force Chief and the Deputy Director for 
Operations, Clair George, had been sitting next to 
him when he gave that unqualified testimony. Ques-
tions about George's statements, and the Task Force 
Chiefs silence in the face of the Assistant Secretary's 
blanket denials, became a third major focus of the 
Committees' inquiry into the CIA's role. 
George had advised the House Intelligence Com-
mittee on October 14, 1986, that the CIA was not 
involved in "arranging, directing, or facilitating" the 
private resupply missions." Significantly, George 
stated that he could not speak for the rest of the U.S. 
Government." Abrams spoke after George and ex-
panded the claim, without knowing its falsity, to 
cover the whole government. The Task Force Chief 
stayed silent. The Task Force Chief knew Castillo 
had been "facilitating" the resupply effort in the 
spring, but may have thought Castillo had not done 
so in September. 
In testimony before these Committees, George 
stated that his denial was based on incomplete infor-
mation, that the CIA did not organize or conduct the 
resupply operations, and that he wanted to protect the 
CIA. He apologized for the problems caused by his 
testimony." The Task Force Chief also said that he 
regretted his silence in response to Clair George's 
unqualified denial of any CIA involvement, and Sec-
retary Abram's denial of any U.S. Government in-
volvement in the Hasenfus flight."

Chapter 7 
One should not underestimate our concern over 
misleading testimony. We are satisfied, however, that 
this was not a byproduct of an orchestrated conspira-
cy to keep Congress in the dark. 
Conclusion 
The CIA had to work under difficult, politically 
charged circumstances. To protect the agency, its 
personnel steered a wide berth around the prohibi-
tions of the law. This was particularly difficult to do 
in an environment in which people were dying for a 
cause the Administration and the agency supported. 
There were misunderstandings in management, and 
errors in judgment, particularly in Congressional testi-
mony. But the blame for this situation must rest upon 
unclear laws, and a vacillating Congressional policy, 
at least as much as it does upon the career profession-
als who were faced with the Herculean task of imple-
menting the law. 
Private Fundraising 
The private fundraising activities in support of the 
Contras conducted by Carl R. (Spitz) Channell and 
Richard Miller received considerable attention in the 
news reports surrounding the Iran-Contra affair. The 
fundraising efforts were also the focus of early crimi-
nal prosecutions by the Independent Counsel, and 
were explored somewhat during our public hearings. 
They have also received significant attention in the 
Majority's Report, where it is portrayed in a lengthy 
chapter as a project devoid of proper purposes. 
We cannot agree with the analysis and conclusions 
of the Majority Report. We agree that a private fund-
raising effort organized and conducted by Mr. Chan-
nell raised funds for the Nicaraguan democratic Re-
sistance; and we agree that the manner in which the 
fundraising activities were carried out can be criti-
cized. We are in particular concerned that a rather 
sizable portion of the donated funds appears not to 
have actually gone to the Contras. But we disagree 
with the majority's theme that the fundraising activi-
ties represented an illegal conspiracy imbued through-
out with criminal intent and improper motivations. 
Based on the evidence, we see the private contribu-
tors as being worthy of praise rather than scorn. For 
the most part, their actions represented good faith 
activities of well-intentioned American citizens moti-
vated by a genuine?and completely legal?desire to 
do what they could to help the Contras in a time of 
need. The private actions, especially those of the 
donors, were patriotic responses in harmony with the 
policies of the President that were designed to rebut 
the growing spread of Soviet communism in North 
America. Our basic conclusions are as follows: 
?Channell developed the private fundraising orga-
nizations and controlled their solicitations. Colonel 
North did not solicit money. He did not conspire with 
Channel] to commit tax fraud. Any suggestion that 
North deliberately created or nurtured the fundraising 
network to provide tax write-offs, tax expenditures, or 
backdoor Federal financing for the Contras, is wholly 
without support from the evidence. 
?President Reagan had nO specific knowledge of 
the private fundraising efforts. He generally believed 
the persons he met with had donated to a media 
campaign designed to generate support for further 
Contra funding by Congress. 
?President Reagan met with individuals in the 
White House to thank them for their long term sup-
port for his policies, not for a particular contribution 
to Channell's organization. 
?This investigation unfairly chastised conservative 
fundraising efforts that supported foreign policy goals 
inconsistent with those of the majority of Congres-
sional Democrats. However, the Committees failed to 
investigate parallel fundraising efforts by organiza-
tions that support the Communist forces in Central 
America, and use Members of Congress in their fund-
raising. 
?Finally, the private fundraising investigation of 
our Committees needlessly harassed private citizens 
whose political views happen to be contrary to the 
views held by the majority, by asking them questions 
that intruded on their privacy and were irrelevant to 
the Committees' investigation. 
The Channell-Miller Network 
The Channell-Miller fundraising network developed 
as a result of common interests and chance occur-
rences. The Committees have not uncovered evidence 
that Colonel North sought to establish a private fund-
raising group or that he motivated any individuals 
such as Channel] and Miller to operate the necessary 
organizations. The evidence demonstrates that Chan-
nell was the primary force behind the private fund-
raising organizations. Colonel North was a relatively 
minor participant.9 5 
When Channell left the National Conservative Po-
litical Action Committee (NCPAC) in 1982 he pos-
sessed a valuable asset?a relationship with contribu-
tors willing to donate large sums of money to political 
causes. He formed a network of organizations, one of 
which was the National Endowment for the Preserva-
tion of Liberty (NEPL), incorporated in 1984 as a 
501(c)3 tax exempt corporation. According to section 
501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code, a tax exempt 
organization must be "organized and operated exclu-
sively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for 
public safety, literary or educational purposes." 
Channell also formed several non-charitable organizations 
around this time period. He formed the American Conservative 
Trust (ACT) in 1984 as a Federal election political action commit-
tee. He also formed the American Conservative Trust State Elec-

Chapter 7 
NEPL was the major organization Channell used for 
his fundraising in support of the Resistance, and it is 
the one whose tax exempt status later became of inter-
est to the Independent Counsel. 
Raising Funds for the Resistance 
The idea of raising money for the Resistance was 
Channell's. He identified the Nicaraguan Refugee 
Fund Dinner held in Washington, D.C. on April 15, 
1985 as the event that inspired him." Following 
President Reagan's speech at this dinner, Channell 
recognized that his contributors were enthusiastic sup-
porters of the Administration's Central American pro-
gram. Channell initially intended to raise money for 
an educational media program designed to win Con-
gressional support for U.S. aid to the freedom fight-
ers. He deviated from his original idea, however, 
when he realized that his contributors would be inter-
ested in donating directly to the freedom fighters in-
stead of to a media campaign. Individuals working 
closely with Channell believed he chose the content 
of his fundraising themes for the purpose of drawing 
out the resources of his wealthy contributors." 
There has been an impression created that Channell 
was working at North's behest. But Channell solicited 
money for the freedom fighters (from John Ramsey of 
Wichita Falls, Texas) two months before he even met 
Colonel North." Colonel North attempted to dis-
courage Channell from raising money for lethal mate-
riel for the Contras on at least two occasions." Chan-
nell ignored this advice and directly approached 
Adolfo Calero, leader of the FDN. It was after learn-
ing of the Channell-Calero discussions that Colonel 
North directed the funds to their most efficient pur-
pose.100 
Channell's Control 
Another sign of Channell's control over his fund-
raising operation was his relationship with his many 
consultants. Channell surrounded himself with con-
sultants who had substantive expertise and access to 
influential political leaders. In March or April of 
1985, he retained Richard Miller and his consulting 
firm, International Business Communications (IBC). 
Miller and his partner had a contract with the State 
Department in which they worked closely with the 
leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance and with mem-
bers of the Reagan Administration. Channell used 
tion Fund (ACT-SEF) as a state political action committee to take 
advantage of state laws allowing corporate contributions to such 
entities. In 1983, he formed Sentinel to lobby Congress under the 
terms of Section 501(c) 4 of the Federal tax code. In the Spring of 
1986, Channell formed the Anti-Terrorist American Committee as a 
federal political action committee to focus on Congressional atti-
tudes towards terrorism. During this time period (1984-1986) Chan-
nell also formed other, less active organizations, including the 
Channell Corporation which was his original for-profit consulting 
corporation. See Channel! Dep., 9/1/87, at 62-65. 
512 
IBC to work on practically every aspect of fundrais-
ing efforts for many issues. Channell also retained the 
services of David Fischer,* Dan Kuykendall, Penn 
Kemble, Bruce Cameron, Miner and Fraser, the 
Robert Goodman Agency, Martin Artiano, Eric 
Olson and others. 
Channell perceived a division of responsibility 
among his associates in the fundraising organization. 
Channell was the creative force and developed the 
fundraising concepts for his various projects, not all 
of which related to the Nicaraguan Resistance. Daniel 
Conrad handled the administrative matters. Miller, 
Kuykendall, Fischer and the other consultants provid-
ed advice. 1?1 The clear indication from the record is 
that Channell?not North or anyone else?was thor-
oughly in charge of the Channell network of organi-
zations. 
White House Role 
Although Channell was in charge of his network, two 
kinds of questions have been raised about his relation-
ship with the Administration. One is whether the 
President was using the power of his office to help 
Channell raise funds for the Resistance. The other 
deals with the level and legality of North's role. 
President Reagan 
Channell used White House briefings and photo 
opportunities with the President as a way to thank 
contributors for their support of Administration 
02 The individuals who had a photo opportu-
nity with the President, however, were not being 
thanked for a single contribution to Channell's organi-
zations. Rather, the President thanked them for their 
long-term support of his policies. As Channell said, "I 
don't know of anybody who was thanked by the 
President solely because of a single act." 103 Channell 
denies ever telling contributors they could meet with 
the President if they made a large contribution to his 
organization.** He did not believe he had any control 
* David Fischer, a former special assistant to President Reagan, 
was instrumental in arranging several meetings at the White House 
for Channell's contributors. The Majority Report suggests that 
Fischer and his colleagues, Martin Artiano and Richard Miller, 
were involved in selling meetings with the President for a set fee. 
While the evidence suggests that Channell viewed his consulting 
payments to IBC, Fischer and Artiano as fees for White House 
meetings, it appears that Fischer himself is as unaware of Channell's 
view. Fischer's retainer agreement with IBC was based on 
Fischer's understanding that he would provide consulting advice on 
a large variety of Channell's public education projects, including 
most notably a project regarding the strategic defense initiative, 
and a series of messages celebrating the bicentennial of the U.S. 
Constitution. Fischer's efforts to arrange meetings at the White 
House represented a small percentage of his work for IBC. 
**During the public hearings, one contributor, William B. 
O'Boyle said that Channell told him he could meet with the Presi-
dent if he contributed $300,000. See Coors, Garwood and O'Boyle 
Test., Hearings, 100-3, 5/21/87, at 119. During the same day's

over photo opportunities with the President and in 
fact several requested meetings were not agreed to by 
the White House.1?4 
Colonel North 
North briefed Channell's potential contributors and 
directed the disposition of funds after Miller received 
them. He did not solicit money from contributors and 
made it his practice not to be present when money 
was solicited by others. He made speeches to and met 
with people from whom Channell was trying to raise 
money.105 North would brief potential contributors 
on the weapons needs of the Contras and Channell 
often would followup by asking for funds directly 
related to Colonel North's briefing. At times, North 
also prepared lists of humanitarian and military needs 
of the freedom fighters that he turned over to Chan-
nell. We have not received any evidence to suggest 
that the items North briefed contributors about were 
actually purchased. Channell never knew if weapons 
were ever purchased with the money he sent to 
Conclusions 
It is fully legal for private individuals to raise 
money for weapons, and then send that money to 
bank accounts controlled by the Nicaraguan demo-
cratic Resistance. The information to which Channell 
pled guilty was not about raising money for lethal aid 
for the Contras per se, but about using a tax exempt 
corporation, NEPL, to do so. Channell formed sever-
al entities in his fundraising network to respond to the 
hearing, Joseph Coors said he had given money to what he thought 
was a Swiss bank account controlled by the Contras to buy an 
airplane for them. The account actually was owned by Lake Re-
sources, a Secord-Hakim company. In addition, in the same hear-
ing, Ellen C. Garwood said that Channell produced a list of weap-
ons, in North's presence, that could be purchased with a contribu-
tion from her. We have no reason to believe these kinds of requests 
were typical. During the hearing, Rep. McCollum made the follow-
ing statement, which was not challenged by anybody: 
It might appear to the casual observer that the three who 
are here with us . . . are typical contributors to the Spitz 
Channell organizations or, in the case of Mr. Coors, more 
directly to the Contras. But from my understanding of the 
depositions and various taking of testimony that went on and 
efforts to get statements from folks before, many many contrib-
utors were interviewed and deposed and not asked to testify 
because they did not have a list like was involved with Mrs. 
Garwood or they didn't have an occasion where they were 
suggested to them that they might see the President if they 
gave money and they didn't give to the Lake Resources ac-
count. 
I just simply want to make that clear to everybody who is 
involved?and I think it needs to be?that these three wit-
nesses are not the typical contributors, and in fact, many others 
gave more money to Mr. Channell's organization. 
No list was found in those cases. Nobody else was told that 
they had to see the President or could see the President if they 
gave money and no other private contributor, at least that we 
discovered, received or sent his money to Lake Resources. See 
Id. at 146. 
complicated tax laws covering charitable and political 
activities. There is no evidence that indicates North 
knew about the tax problem, much less conspired 
with Channell and Miller. This conclusion is support-
ed by the fact that Channell did not know of any 
contributors who donated money because NEPL was 
tax exempt who would not have donated if NEPL 
were not tax exempt.'" As for Colonel North's other 
activities, there is no evidence that North instructed 
Channell to use NEPL to raise money for the Con-
tras.'" In addition, he did not solicit money from 
contributors.'" There can be no question that North 
knowingly conveyed the impression that he favored 
what Channell was trying to do, but there is nothing 
wrong with the White House openly endorsing pri-
vate activities in support of Administration policy. 
Left Wing Private Fundraising 
Conservative fundraising organizations have been 
criticized during this investigation because they have 
raised money to support policy goals that a majority 
of the Democratic Members of Congress did not sup-
port. Clearly, it is permissible under current law to 
raise money for foreign political movements, includ-
ing military activities. If there were any question 
about this, the Committees should?for the sake of a 
balanced, fair record?have devoted similar resources 
investigating organizations that support left-wing 
forces in Central America opposed to United States 
foreign policy that use Members of Congress in their 
fundraising. 
Several organizations have opposed United States 
policy in Central America by sending money and 
supplies to El Salvador. The most notable is the Com-
mittee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador 
(CISPES) which Assistant Secretary Abrams de-
scribed as an organization that "essentially serves as a 
front for the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador".110 
According to a 31 page set of State Department 
cables about these groups that was introduced by 
Rep. Bill McCollum as a Committee exhibit, CISPES 
was founded in 1980 by the leader of the Salvadoran 
Communist Party, Shafik Handal.111 This Washing-
ton, D.C. based organization coordinates efforts of a 
major U.S. support network. CISPES activities are 
said to include, among other things, a program to 
send material aid to Central American struggles and 
"creative harassment" at public appearances and 
speaking engagements of individuals who support 
U.S. policy.112 
New El Salvador Today (NEST) is an organization 
that has worked closely with CISPES on fundraising, 
volunteer training, and other activities."3 NEST has 
raised funds for projects in areas of El Salvador con-
trolled by the Communist insurgents."4 
There have been allegations, included in the State 
Department cables, to the effect that much of the 
money received by organizations such as these ends 
513

Chapter 7 
up in the coffers of guerrilla groups, or being used to 
provide welfare services that help the FMLN's politi-
cal program in areas the FMLN controls. According 
to a State Department interview with former Salva-
doran leftist guerrilla leader, Miguel Castellanos, the 
Western Democracies became the largest source of 
cash for the guerrillas during the 1980s. Castellanos 
served on the finance committee of the Popular 
Forces of Liberation (PFL) in 1978 and defected in 
1985. He stated that the guerrilla groups set up insti-
tutions to collect donations from leftist humanitarian 
organizations and use that money without concern for 
its original purpose. Approximately 70% of the 
money which purported to go for humanitarian assist-
ance actually went for the purchase of arms. 
Senator McClure introduced an exhibit which is a 
fundraising letter for CISPES purportedly written 
over the signature of a Member of Congress." 5 An-
other exhibit is purportedly from another Member 
which states that "NEST is a non-profit, tax-exempt 
foundation which is sending humanitarian aid to those 
whose lives are most affected by the violence of the 
U.S. supported war." 116 The same two Members 
also hosted a reception for NEST in Washington D. 
C. on July 10, 1986." 7 
By repeating Castellanos' general statement and 
mentioning the fundraising role played by two Mem-
bers of Congress, we do not mean to suggest that we 
have evidence to prove (1) that Castellanos' general 
allegation applies specifically to CISPES or NEST or 
(2) if it applies, that the two Members of Congress 
knew about the allegation. The point is that we can 
neither confirm nor deny the allegation because the 
Committees did not review the subject in its investi-
gation. 
The similarities between the conservative and liber-
al fundraising efforts for Central American groups are 
striking: both used politicians to support their respec-
tive causes, both used tax-exempt organizations, both 
may have donated money which was ultimately used 
to buy weapons, both supported foreign policy goals 
inconsistent with the declared Congressional policy. 
The primary difference between these two fundraising 
efforts is that the Committees have publicized the 
conservative fundraising efforts in an attempt to em-
barrass the President. If one set of groups was worthy 
of investigation, then so surely was the other. 
Overstepping the Bounds 
With the time it saved not investigating groups on the 
left, the private fundraising investigation has needless-
ly harassed private citizens who happen to hold con-
servative foreign policy views. Witnesses were forced 
to travel long distances and testify concerning money 
which they legitimately gave to political organiza-
tions."" Committee attorneys questioned witnesses 
about their political activity,"" religious affili-
ations,12? educational backgrounds,'21 employment 
514 
history,122 political lineage,123 roommate's political 
contributions,124 social associations,' 25 and more. 
The subpoenas issued to many of Channell's contribu-
tors required tax returns, correspondence related to 
Nicaragua, documents concerning political contribu-
tions and other broad categories of personal papers, 
without any apparent effort being made to limit the 
material to items that fell within the Committees' le-
gitimate mandate to investigate governmental activi-
ties. 
The Committee used its subpoena powers, and the 
wedge of a reasonable inquiry into private fundrais-
ing, to go on a wide-ranging fishing expedition into 
irrelevant political issues. For example, counsel asked 
Martin Artiano if he knew who stole the 1980 Carter 
debate manuals.'" David Fischer, who was responsi-
ble for Corazon Aquino's very successful American 
tour, was asked several questions to determine wheth-
er he prevented Aquino from meeting with liberal 
groups at the Kennedy Library in Boston.'" Counsel 
inquired of several witnesses whether they had any 
knowledge of Ambassador Faith Whittlesey's dinner 
to honor Sir James Goldsmith.'" Counsel also asked 
about Roy Godson's efforts to counter Soviet disin-
formation in Europe.'" Finally, Carl Channell was 
asked about President Reagan's Strategic Defense Ini-
tiative.130 
Many other examples could be cited, but these are 
enough to make the point.* These Committees had 
*Unfortunately, even the non-partisan reputation of the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) has been tarnished during this phase of 
the investigation. The incident does not quite fit in with this list of 
outrageous questions asked of witnesses, but is too important to 
Congress for us to let it pass without comment. The Comptroller 
General of the United States sent a letter on September 30, 1987 to 
Reps. Jack Brooks and Dante Fascell which concluded that the 
State Department violated a restriction on the use of appropriated 
funds for publicity. Unlike its normal procedure with a final opin-
ion or report, the GAO issued this letter in time to be used in this 
report, before its audit was complete and without giving the head 
of the relevant office or his deputy a chance to hear and reply to 
the allegations. The opinion fails even to mention, let alone respond 
to, documentary evidence that conflicts with the conclusions it 
presents as "facts." We are in no position to say whether the 
pressure for "timely" publication was generated inside GAO or 
externally. In any case, the preliminary opinion was then given to 
the press by counsel in a release with an October 5 embargo date in 
the name of the two House Democrats who had asked for the 
audit. See GAO Letter of September 30, 1987 to Reps. Brooks and 
Fascell, B-229069. 
In a letter to Representatives Lee Hamilton and Dick Cheney, 
Lawrence L. Tracy, Colonel, U.S. Army (Ret.), disputes the factual 
basis for the GAO Report. Tracy worked for the Office of Public 
Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean from 1984-1986. 
Col. Tracy believes that Jonathan Miller's memo discussing "white 
propaganda" was probably an exaggeration intended to curry favor 
with the White House. In a thoughtful analysis, Col. Tracy com-
pares the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the 
Caribbean to the public diplomacy campaign conducted by the 
Carter Administration on the Panama Canal Treaty. "Although 
many in this country disagreed with the Carter policy, I do not 
recall anyone in Congress calling on the GAO to investigate a

legitimate reasons to ask about private fundraising. If 
Congress wants to be worthy of trust as an institution, 
however, it has to restrain itself. Just as the President 
ultimately has to accept responsibility for the actions 
of any one subordinate who zealously steps over the 
line, so too must these Committees bear the responsi-
bility for the actions of one of its own staff, even if?
or especially because?they were not typical of the 
Committees' work as a whole. 
Conclusion 
Our analysis of the past two chapters has largely been 
about legal questions. It has shown the Administration 
did stay within the law. By giving the Administration 
a clean bill of legal health, however, we do not intend 
to be endorsing the wisdom of everything it was 
doing. Notwithstanding our legal opinions, we think it 
was a fundamental mistake for the NSC staff to have 
been secretive and deceptive about its actions. The 
requirement for building long term political support 
means that the Administration would have been better 
off if it had conducted its activities in the open. Thus, 
the President should simply have vetoed the strict 
Boland Amendment in mid-October 1984, even 
though the amendment was only a few paragraphs in 
an approximately 1,200 page long continuing appro-
'propaganda' effort. The public was well-served by the national 
debate that ensued, for the American people came to understand 
both the costs and the benefits of the Treaty, and were better able 
to advise their representatives in Congress of their position on the 
issue. That is the essence of democracy." (See Appendix D to the 
Minority Report for Col. Tracy's letter.) 
priations resolution, and a veto therefore would have 
brought the Government to a standstill within three 
weeks of a national election. Once the President de-
cided against a veto, it was self-defeating for anyone 
to think a program this important could be sustained 
by deceiving Congress. Whether technically illegal or 
not, it was politically foolish and counterproductive 
to mislead Congress, even if misleading took the form 
of artful evasion or silence instead of overt misstate-
ment. 
We do believe firmly that the NSC staff's deceits 
were not meant to hide illegalities. Every witness we 
have heard told us his concern was not over legality, 
but with the fear that Congress would respond to 
complete disclosure with political reprisals, principal-
ly by tightening the Boland Amendments. That risk 
should have been taken. 
We are convinced that the Constitution protects 
much of what the NSC staff was doing?particularly 
those aspects that had to do with encouraging contri-
butions and sharing information. The President's in-
herent constitutional powers are only as strong, how-
ever, as the President's willingness to defend them. As 
for the NSC actions Congress could constitutionally 
have prohibited, it would have been better for the 
White House to have tackled that danger head on. 
Some day, Congress's decision to withhold resources 
may tragically require U.S. citizens to make an even 
heavier commitment to Central America, perhaps one 
measured in blood and not dollars. The commitment 
that might eliminate such an awful future will not be 
forthcoming unless the public is exposed to and per-
suaded by a clear, sustained, and principled debate on 
the merits.

Chapter 8 
The Iran Initiative 
Simple plots make for stirring fiction. Sometimes, 
amateur historians fall into the temptation of present-
ing events as if all lines inevitably and always pointed 
toward the already known conclusion. That is not the 
way events happen in the real world. The Iran chap-
ters of the majority report create the impression that 
its authors have fallen into the amateur historian's 
trap. The narrative tries to simplify events and moti-
vations for the sake of a story line. That does a 
disservice to history. The record ought to reflect the 
complex motives of the participants in these oper-
ations. The motives may be difficult to determine, but 
papering the difficulties over will not help future gen-
erations learn from what happened. 
The majority report seems alternately to be torn 
between two theses about the Iran Initiative: that it 
was strictly an arms-for-hostages deal or that, starting 
in December 1985 or January 1986, it was driven by a 
desire to provide funds for the Contras. Additionally, 
the Iran sections of the report continue the majority's 
portrayal of the Administration as a gang of law-
breakers who would do virtually anything to achieve 
their objectives, while invoking an exaggerated fear 
of leaks to keep the truth about activities from Con-
gress. 
This portrayal is patently absurd. The hostages 
were important to President Reagan. He probably did 
fall victim to his own compassion, and let their per-
sonal safety weigh too heavily on him. But it is clear 
from all the evidence we have that the initiative was 
pursued primarily for strategic reasons. We may dis-
agree with the underlying assumptions, or with the 
decision to sell arms, but any honest review of the 
evidence must acknowledge these intentions, and with 
the fact that strategic considerations played an impor-
tant part in the discussions conducted through the so-
called Second Channel. 
Similarly, the use of residuals to benefit the Contras 
was certainly seen as a plus?a "neat idea"?by North 
and Poindexter. But Contras funding never drove the 
Iran initiative. A sober look at the amount of money 
involved would make that clear to anyone. At most, 
the residuals were seen as a peripheral benefit from a 
policy whose justification lay elsewhere. 
We shall show in this section of our report that the 
Administration did, in fact, substantially comply with 
the legal requirements. Moreover, the decision not to 
notify Congress was not based on an anti-democratic 
obsession with secrecy, but was based on the same 
sound reasoning that led the Carter Administration to 
the identical decision not to report operations during 
the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 and 1980. 
Summary Overview 
The United States was taken by surprise when the 
Shah fell in 1979, because it had not developed an 
adequate human intelligence capability in Iran. Our 
hearings have established that little had been done to 
remedy the situation by the mid-1980's. The United 
States was still without adequate intelligence when, in 
1985, it was approached by Israel with a proposal that 
the United States acquiesce in Israeli sales of U.S.-
origin arms to Iran. This proposal came at a time 
when the NSC was already circulating a recommen-
dation that the United States consider the advisability 
of such sales to Iran. Long term strategic consider-
ations dictated that the United States try to improve 
relations with at least some of the important factions 
in Iran. The lack of adequate intelligence about the 
situation inside Iran made it imperative to pursue any 
potentially fruitful opportunity; it also made those 
pursuits inherently risky. United States decisions of 
necessity had to be based on the thinnest of independ-
ently verifiable information. Lacking such independ-
ent intelligence, the United States was forced to rely 
on sources known to be biased and unreliable. Well 
aware of the risk, the Administration nonetheless de-
cided that the opportunity was worth pursuing. 
To explore the chance for an opening, the President 
decided to sell arms to Iran.* Some suggest that this 
decision stemmed from little more than the President's 
ignorance, the NSC staff's foolhardiness, and private 
*It is important at the outset to note the small amounts involved. 
The total arms sold included 2004 TOW anti-tank missiles, 18 
Hawk antiaircraft missiles, and some 200 or so types of spare parts 
for Hawk batteries. Some of the missiles were sold from Israeli 
stocks with U.S. approval. The remaining materiel came from U.S. 
stocks. A small amount of perishable intelligence information was 
also transferred to the Iranians. The amounts involved were trivial, 
compared to the world arms trade with Iran, which Secretary 
Weinberger estimated at $10 billion. For the last point, see Wein-
berger Test., Hearings, 100-10, 7/31/87, at 166.

Chapter 8 
greed. We completely reject this interpretation. The 
initiative was controversial. We disagree with the de-
cision to sell arms, and we wish that the whole initia-
tive had proceeded with more caution. But despite 
these reservations, we remain convinced that the deci-
sion to pursue some such initiative was not an 
inherently unreasonable one. 
The major participants in the Iran arms affair obvi-
ously had some common and some conflicting inter-
ests. The key question the United States had to ex-
plore was whether the U.S. and Iranian leadership 
actually felt enough of a common interest to establish 
a strategic dialogue. No one can deny the common 
U.S. and Iranian interest in opposing Soviet expan-
sion. But how much would that community of interest 
be felt, acknowledged and acted upon? Iran and the 
United States have compatible goals in Afghanistan. 
The question was whether such isolated examples 
could be broadened into something more substantial. 
The initial dealings with the Iranian government 
were undermined by the unreliability of the interme-
diary, Manucher Ghorbanifar. Nevertheless, Ghorban-
ifar did help obtain the release of two U.S. hostages 
(Rev. Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco) 
and he did also produce high Iranian officials for the 
first face to face meetings between our governments 
in five years. At those meetings, U.S. officials sought 
consistently to make clear that we were interested in 
a long-term strategic relationship with Iran to oppose 
Soviet expansionism. The hostages issue was present-
ed as an obstacle to an enhanced relationship that 
would have to be overcome, not as the objective of 
the initiative. Colonel North made an extensive pres-
entation to this effect in February 1986; former Na-
tional Security Adviser McFarlane made a similar 
presentation in Tehran in May 1986. But the Iranian 
officials brought by Ghorbanifar seemed to be inter-
ested only in weapons, and in using the hostages for 
bargaining leverage. The full extent of the difference 
between these approaches finally was made obvious 
to the United States at the meeting in Tehran, which 
North, McFarlane and others attended at great per-
sonal risk. Ghorbanifar appears to have misled both 
sides in the preparations for that meeting. Afterwards, 
the United States suspended discussions arranged by 
Ghorbanifar, except to complete the transactions al-
ready underway. 
After the Tehran meetings, the United States was 
able to approach a very high-ranking Iranian official 
using a second channel arranged by Albert Hakim 
and his associates. Clearly, Hakim had business mo-
tives in arranging these contacts. Whatever his mo-
tives, he did produce contacts at the highest levels of 
the Iranian government. Discussions with this channel 
began in the middle of 1986 and continued until De-
cember. They resulted in the release of one further 
hostage (David Jacobsen), and U.S. officials expected 
them to result in the release of more hostages. Per-
haps more importantly, these discussions appear to 
520 
have considered the possibility of broad areas of stra-
tegic cooperation. However, as a result of factional 
infighting inside the Iranian government, the initiative 
was exposed * and substantive discussions were sus-
pended. Not surprisingly, given the nature of Iranian 
politics, the Iranian government has publicly denied 
that significant negotiations had taken place. 
The Reagan Administration's Iran initiative repre-
sented an attempt to narrow the differences stemming 
from the Iranian revolution and the intervening years 
of hostility. Both sides confronted sharp internal divi-
sions over the issue of rapprochement. In such a situa-
tion, the margin between success and failure looms 
much larger in retrospect than it may seem while 
events are unfolding. While the initial contacts devel-
oped by Israel and used by the United States do not 
appear likely to have led to a long-term relationship, 
we cannot rule out the possibility that negotiations 
with the second channel might have turned out differ-
ently. At this stage, we never will know what might 
have been. 
In retrospect, it seems clear that this initiative de-
generated into a series of "arms for hostage" deals. 
But it did not look that way to many of the U.S. 
participants at the time. In our view, it is simply 
wrong, therefore, to reduce the complex motivations 
behind these events to any one simple thesis. Clearly, 
the participants from different countries, and even 
those within each country, had different, and some-
times conflicting, motives. Without endorsing or 
agreeing with the use of arms sales as a tactic, we 
believe that U.S. officials made a risky, but neverthe-
less worthwhile effort. To explain why, we shall 
begin by outlining the strategic importance of Iran. 
The Strategic Context 
Iran is the largest country in the Persian Gulf region, 
an area of vital economic importance to the United 
States and its allies. It is in a strategic position poten-
tially to dominate the world's largest proven oil re-
serves and threaten the vulnerable pro-Western states 
of the Gulf littoral. 
The most complete public information about this incident ap-
peared in a September 29, 1987 New York Times article about the 
execution of Mehdi Hashemi. The article identified Hashemi as the 
former director of the office of Ayotollah Hussein Montazeri, 
"Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini's personal choice as his successor 
in the post of supreme religious guide." The Times also said, (1) 
Montazeri and Speaker of the Parliament (or Majlis) Hashemi Raf-
sanjani were factional rivals, (2) Hashemi was arrested in October 
1986, and (3) the Montazeri/Hashemi faction was responsible for a 
story that appeared in the Lebanese weekly Al Shiraa in early 
November 1986 describing a May meeting in Tehran between Mr. 
McFarlane and Rafsanjani. That was the story that led to the Iran 
arms initiative's unraveling. See John Kifner, "Aide to Khomeini 
Heir Apparent Is Reported Executed in Tehran," The New York 
Times, Sept. 29, 1987, pp. Al, A13.

For the same reasons, Iran is of critical interest to 
the Soviet Union which, in addition to seeking access 
to and control of the West's oil supplies, continues in 
its historic quest for a warm water port. The United 
States has long recognized these critical and compet-
ing interests. At the end of the Second World War, 
President Truman was willing to threaten military 
action to force the Soviet Union to withdraw from 
areas of Northern Iran it had occupied during the 
war. In defense of its interests, the United States has 
maintained a naval presence in the Persian Gulf since 
1949.

Chapter 8 
Iran dominates the entire eastern shore of the Per-
sian Gulf; it controls the Strait of Hormuz and can 
threaten the free flow of oil from the Gulf to the 
industrial economies of the West. In 1987, as part of 
its effort to disrupt non-Iranian shipping traffic in the 
Gulf, Iran has used anti-ship missiles and other muni-
tions to attack neutral oil tankers, and laid mines 
throughout the Gulf. U.S. and allied warships have 
been deployed in the Gulf to ensure that the flow of 
oil is not impeded. Although less than six percent of 
U.S. oil consumption transits the Gulf, 24 percent of 
Western Europe's oil and almost half of Japan's total 
oil consumption must pass through the Strait of 
Hormuz. Iran alone supplies some five percent of 
Western Europe's and Japan's oil. Increased oil pro-
duction elsewhere in the world, and the opening of 
new pipelines to take oil through Turkey, Iran and 
Saudi Arabia have somewhat reduced the Gulfs rela-
tive importance.' Even so, Iran remains able to be a 
seriously disruptive force to the world's economy. 
In addition to its importance to oil supplies and oil 
routes, Iran, whose population of about 45 million is 
larger than the other Gulf states combined, is in a 
position to dominate or destabilize the small, weak, 
pro-Western countries of the Western Gulf coastal 
region. Recent Iranian policy toward Kuwait exempli-
fies the pressure Iran can exert on its neighbors. An 
aggressive Iran can promote anti-Western Shiite fun-
damentalism throughout the Middle East, threatening 
key U.S. allies such as Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. 
Events of the last decade have raised the strategic 
stakes in the Persian Gulf region and given the Soviet 
Union the chance to expand its influence in an area 
where it historically has had little. The fall of the 
Shah, the installation of a revolutionary Islamic 
regime in Tehran, and the Iran-Iraq war have given 
the Soviet Union strong incentives to try to improve 
its position in Iran and the entire Gulf region. 
A Soviet-dominated Iran would pose an even great-
er threat to Western interests than the current radical 
regime. Such a development, for example, would give 
Moscow direct land access to warm water ports on 
the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. The Soviet Navy's 
home ports on the Soviet mainland are frequently ice 
bound in winter, or provide limited access to the open 
ocean, making it easier for U.S. and allied navies to 
contain the Soviet fleet. Soviet land access to a warm 
water port in this region would seriously endanger 
U.S. security interests in the entire Indian Ocean 
region, from the Indian subcontinent to Eastern 
Africa. 
On Iran's eastern border, the Soviet aggression in 
Afghanistan has further skewed the unstable strategic 
balance of the region, unsettled Iran's neighbor Paki-
stan, and left the Soviet Union better-placed to 
meddle in post-Khomeini Iran. In response to events 
in the Gulf, the Carter Administration developed a 
Rapid Deployment Force to demonstrate an increased 
U.S. resolve to defend U.S. and Western interests 
there. It was against this background that the Reagan 
Administration conceived its policy opening to Iran. 
On May 17, 1985, just before the United States 
decided to pursue the Iran initiative, Graham Fuller, 
the CIA's National Intelligence Officer for Near East 
and South Asia, produced a memorandum, "Toward 
a Policy on Iran," reporting that the intelligence com-
munity was learning of signs of significant internal 
unrest in Iran and was monitoring "Soviet progress 
toward developing significant leverage in Tehran".2 
By the end of 1985, the intelligence community took a 
less worried view which was reflected in a new esti-
mate published in February 1986.3 
By mid-1987, however, press reports were begin-
ning to suggest that Fuller's original concern might 
have been well founded. These reports involved pos-
sible Soviet intelligence sites in Iran and a pipeline 
and railroad through Iran to its long sought after 
Persian Gulf warm water port.4 Should these ac-
counts prove true, the 1985-86 initiative might even-
tually be seen as a farsighted attempt to prevent seri-
ously troublesome developments that could occur 
after the factional struggle everyone expects to begin 
when the aged Ayotollah Khomeini dies, if it has not 
already begun. 
Strategic Opening, Or Only An 
Arms-For-Hostages Deal? 
The majority report systematically downplays the im-
portance of strategic objectives in the Iran initiative. 
We believe, to the contrary, that the record is unam-
biguous on the following facts: (1) that strategic ob-
jectives were important to the participants at all 
times; (2) that the objectives were credible, (3) that 
they were the driving force for the initiative at the 
outset, and (4) that without such a strategic concern, 
the initiative would never have been undertaken. 
One of the most disappointing forms of evidence-
slanting throughout the majority's narrative is that it 
refuses adequately to present the key witnesses' ac-
counts of their own motives, in their own words, 
from the hearing record. That failure is most glaring 
in connection with the witnesses' statements about the 
strategic motives behind the Iran policy. We have no 
intention of trying to recite all of the evidence here. 
We are convinced, however, that anyone who reads 
the material we cite will recognize the bias involved 
in presenting what purports to be any analysis of the 
arms sales without including the participants' own 
explanations of their motivations. The majority may 
not agree with the Administration's strategic reason-
ing, but it is simply unfair to ignore it. 
The President's words are probably the most im-
portant here. Dale Van Atta, a reporter, knew the 
essential facts of the initiative in February 1986. The 
President was willing to talk to him on February 24, 
on the condition that the information not be used until

Chapter 8 
the hostages came home. Van Atta asked the Presi-
dent about the hostages. Instead of answering in kind, 
the President spoke about strategic matters. 
All right. The Iranian situation. We have to re-
member that we had a pretty solid relationship 
with Iran during the time of the Shah. We have 
to realize also that that was a very key ally in 
that particular area in preventing the Soviets 
from reaching their age old goal of the warm 
water ports, and so forth. And now with the 
take-over by the present ruler, we have to be-
lieve that there must be elements present in Iran 
that?when nature takes its inevitable course?
they want to return to different relationships . . . 
We have to oppose what they are doing. We at 
the same time must recognize we do not want to 
make enemies of those who today could be our 
friends.5 
The President's own statements were supported by 
senior officials in his Administration testifying before 
these committees. For simplicity's sake, we will cite 
this material by grouping the references under the 
substantive topics covered. These included: 
?establish a new U.S. relationship with Iran, thus 
strengthening the U.S. strategic posture throughout 
the Persian Gulf region;6 
?counter Soviet influence in Iran;7 
?lessen Iran's dependence on the Soviet Union and 
other communist nations as arms suppliers;8 
?open a channel to pragmatic Iranian officials;9 
?wean the Iranian regime away from terrorism;" 
?encourage a negotiated settlement of the Iran-
Iraq war;"' 
?protect the northern tier countries?Pakistan, 
India and their neighbors?and encourage their inter-
est in supporting the Afghan resistance forces;" 2 
?protect the southern tier countries?Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Israel and Egypt; '3 
?improve U.S. intelligence capabilities in Iran;" 
and 
?discourage Iranian arms exports to Nicaragua." 
As we said earlier, one need not agree with these 
strategic goals, or agree that arms sales were a good 
way to achieve them, to recognize their importance 
to the key players. The Administration felt it was 
crucial to begin making some inroads into Iran, before 
that country became embroiled in a succession crisis. 
The last thing we wanted was to abandon the field to 
the Soviets. It was important to keep looking for 
opportunities. Unfortunately, our ignorance of the sit-
uation in Iran was such that we had few realistic 
ways to do so. 
524 
U.S. Intelligence Weaknesses in 
Iran 
Although the motives were clearly present for trying 
to develop a new relationship with Iran, the means 
were not. In an important respect, the Iran initiative 
had at least one of its roots in an intelligence failure. 
There are two different intelligence issues raised by 
the Iran initiative. One is that intelligence gaps or 
weaknesses influenced U.S. decisions. We agree with 
this point. The other is that intelligence was "cooked" 
to match the preconceived conclusions of policy 
makers. We strongly disagree with this charge, to the 
extent that it relates to the information generated by 
the executive branch. We do believe, however, that 
some officials?most notably, Admiral Poindexter and 
Director Casey?failed adequately to present the U.S. 
intelligence community's assessment to the President 
at a crucial moment of decision. 
Let us begin with the issue of intelligence gaps. 
Gary Sick, who worked on the National Security 
Council staff during the Carter Administration, de-
scribed the state of U.S. intelligence in Iran when the 
Shah fell in 1979: 
I had written a briefing paper for [National Secu-
rity Adviser Zbigniew] Brzezinski noting that 
"the most fundamental problem at the moment is 
the astonishing lack of hard information we are 
getting about developments in Iran." I comment-
ed that "this has been an intelligence disaster of 
the first order. Our information has been ex-
tremely meager, our resources were not posi-
tioned to report accurately on the activities of 
the opposition forces, on external penetration, the 
strike demands, the political organization of the 
strikers, or the basic objectives and political ori-
entation of the demonstrators." "6 
General Secord, who became Deputy Commander of 
the hostage rescue task force in 1980 after the unsuc-
cessful Desert I operation, confirmed that the lack of 
intelligence was the reason why his combat-ready task 
force never made a second effort to rescue the hos-
tages.' 7 
Faced with the loss of the Tehran embassy and its 
intelligence secrets, the flight or execution of pro-
Western officials and agents, a ruthless secret police 
network and restrictions on travel to Iran, U.S. intelli-
gence efforts had to start again from scratch. Accord-
ing to new reports, efforts to rebuild our intelligence 
capability were further devastated by the 1983 bomb-
ing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed many 
of the CIA's leading Middle East experts, and by the 
abduction of the post-bombing Beirut station chief, 
William Buckley. Before his death as a result of tor-
ture, Buckley was allegedly forced to reveal his ex-

Chapter 8 
tensive knowledge of CIA anti-terrorism and other 
operations in the Middle East. 
There was near unanimity inside the government on 
the weakness of U.S. intelligence in Iran. Director 
Casey reportedly conceded the point, and his former 
deputy, John McMahon, agreed." Casey believed 
that the need for intelligence was one of the main 
reasons for going ahead with the initiative." Robert 
McFarlane and John Poindexter both lamented the 
dearth of intelligence on internal Iranian politics and 
Iranian support for terrorism, which left them vulner-
able and "flying blind". In particular, U.S. policy 
makers lacked the information necessary to assess the 
influence and bona fides of the Iranian officials with 
whom they were dealing.20 
The core problem was a lack of well-placed human 
agents within Iran.2' The CIA's Deputy Director for 
Operations, Clair George, is responsible for clandes-
tine human intelligence collection. He freely acknowl-
edged that the Directorate was not collecting the 
information necessary to influence or deal with Iran. 
In the opinion of some intelligence professionals the 
CIA's weakness of human intelligence collection re-
flects a long-term shift toward a greater reliance on 
more exotic, technical collection methods, which are 
considered "clean" and safe compared to the messy 
business of running human spies. As Admiral Poin-
dexter said: 
The problem is that with technical means of col-
lection, there is no way that you can find out 
about intent as to what the people are planning 
or doing. The only way you can get that is 
through human intelligence. A satellite will tell 
you how many divisions or how many tanks or 
how many airplanes, but it won't tell you what 
they are planning to do with that.22 
One problem with human intelligence is that it 
often requires the use of individuals of dubious rep-
utations. Despite criticism of the use of Ghorbanifar 
in the Iran initiative, U.S. intelligence may have no 
choice but to rely on questionable individuals in 
future operations. As George told the Committees: "If 
we only served and dealt with the honest and fair, we 
would be out of business fairly fast." 23 Poindexter 
made essentially the same point: "Human intelligence 
is messy, because you have to deal with people. You 
don't always know if they are telling you the truth or 
not . . . . [You] have to deal with pretty despicable 
characters if you are going to get penetration of these 
organizations". 24 
Faced with this frustrating lack of intelligence, it 
appears that Admiral Poindexter adopted the view 
that the Israelis had better information on the situa-
tion in Iran. Poindexter was so convinced of this that 
he even accepted the Israeli view that Iraq gradually 
was acquiring a battlefield advantage in the war with 
Iran," even though he knew U.S. intelligence held a 
contrary view," and the issue would have been open 
to independent verification. 
The Issue of "Cooked" Intelligence 
One of the many dramatic charges Secretary Shultz 
made about his own Administration involved this as-
sessment of the Iran-Iraq war. Responding to Senator 
Inouye, Shultz said that the failure to separate "the 
functions of gathering and analyzing intelligence from 
the function of developing and carrying out 
policy" 27 resulted in the Administration getting 
faulty information on which to base its judgments and 
decisions. 
I hate to say it, but I believe that one of the 
reasons the President was given what I regard as 
wrong information, for example about Iran and 
terrorism was that the agency or the people in 
the CIA were too involved in this. So that is one 
point. And I feel very clear in my mind about 
this point. And I know that long before this all 
emerged, I had come to have great doubts about 
the objectivity and reliability of some of the intel-
ligence I was getting." 
Despite Secretary Shultz's statement, these commit-
tees have found absolutely no evidence to support 
allegations of intelligence bias within the CIA. As 
Deputy CIA Director Gates has observed, one of the 
best guarantees against an intelligence bias is the 
widespread circulation of CIA analyses on Capitol 
Hill, particularly the intelligence committees' scrutiny 
of virtually everything the CIA and intelligence com-
munity produces." With the exception of one contro-
versial 1982 report, neither committee has exhibited 
any concern over the objectivity of analysis within 
Casey's CIA, despite the committees' often stormy 
relationship with the Director.* Shultz is also refuted 
by former Deputy CIA Director McMahon who, in 
response to a deposition question regarding the Secre-
tary's assertions, said: "It wouldn't happen. This is 
just so [expletive deleted] outrageous, I can't stand it. 
That is just so damn false, and I think George Shultz 
got away with murder on that one." McMahon also 
said he asked Director Webster "why the hell he 
didn't challenge Shultz on that." Webster, according 
The 1982 exception provoked the resignation of Admiral (Ret.) 
Bobby Inman as a consultant to the House committee. Specifically, 
Inman?a former director of NSA and a former Deputy Director 
of Central Intelligence and one of the intelligence community's 
most respected alumni?gave as his reason for leaving the fact that 
he had not been consulted on a Congressional subcommittee report 
criticizing intelligence analyses on Central America. Inman felt that 
the report, which focused on El Salvador, was "put out on party 
lines." Inman also underscored, in his resignation statement, that 
Congressional oversight of intelligence agencies had to be nonpo-
litical to earn public credibility. He added that "if the country 
doesn't establish a bipartisan approach to intelligence, we are not 
going to face the problems of the next fifty years." See Washington 
Post, October 15, 1982.

to McMahon, said he did ask Shultz, but "I guess he 
hasn't heard from Shultz yet."3? 
Admiral Poindexter's reliance on an Israeli assess-
ment that Iran's position was deteriorating in the war 
with Iraq was particularly controversial. White House 
Chief of Staff Donald Regan's notes of a November 
10, 1986 meeting of top advisers makes it clear that 
the President was still using the assessment as a justifi-
cation for his decision the previous January to sell 
arms to Iran.3' Poindexter acknowledged, however, 
that the assessment differed from that of the U.S. 
intelligence community. Poindexter had the option, of 
course, of agreeing with such an assessment over the 
one he was getting from U.S. intelligence. But he and 
Director Casey should have felt an obligation to high-
light that disagreement at the time it was being used 
to buttress the proposed January 1986 finding. It is 
clear from Poindexter's testimony that he did not 
remind the President at the time that this view dif-
fered from the majority view within the intelligence 
community. The evidence seems to suggest strongly, 
in other words, not that intelligence was "cooked" by 
U.S. intelligence, but that the views of U.S. intelli-
gence were not properly passed up the line and high-
lighted to the President. 
The Israeli Connection 
The Administration's reliance on Israeli intelligence 
has raised questions about Israel's role in the Iran 
initiative. That role probably will never be fully un-
derstood. The Tower Commission Report," supple-
mented by some new material in the majority narra-
tive, lays out the basic outline. We have too little 
confirmed evidence, however, and too many conflict-
ing theories, to sort it all into neat packages. 
The immediate background to the Iran arms initia-
tive had two separate strands in 1984. One strand 
begins with Ghorbanifar's desire to sell arms; the 
other with an independent review of U.S. policy 
toward Iran conducted by the NSC. The two strands 
came together in mid-1985. 
Ghorbanifar began trying to approach the United 
States in June 1984 with the story that he had access 
to some important figures in the Iranian government 
who wanted to improve relations with the West. The 
CIA polygraphed Ghorbanifar, he failed (not for the 
first time) and the agency issued a "burn notice" to its 
field personnel and other U.S. intelligence services 
warning them to treat Ghorbanifar as a known liar. 
Clair George told the Committees: "You have to 
work at it pretty hard to get a burn notice out of the 
Operations Directorate at the CIA." 33 
Over the next several months, Ghorbanifar and 
Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi arms dealer, reportedly 
made several attempts to develop a U.S.-Iran arms 
relationship.34 One of the approaches they made in 
1984, according to the Tower Commission, was 
through a former CIA officer, Theodore Shackley. In 
526 
that approach, the arms dealers specifically linked 
weapons to Americans held hostage in Lebanon: 
Shackley, a former CIA officer, reported that, in 
a meeting November 19-21, 1984, in Hamburg, 
West Germany, General Manucher Hashemi, 
former head of SAVAK's Department VIII 
(counterespionage), introduced him to Manucher 
Ghorbanifar. Hashemi said Ghorbanifar's con-
tacts in Iran were "fantastic." Ghorbanifar was 
already known to the CIA, and the Agency did 
not have a favorable impression of his reliability 
or veracity. Shackley reported that Ghorbanifar 
had been a SAVAK agent, was known to be an 
international deal maker, and generally an inde-
pendent man, difficult to contro1.35 
Shackley's report went to the State Department but 
the department was not interested. 
By January 1985, Ghorbanifar was discussing a po-
tential arms relationship that would have involved the 
United States, Iran and Israel. Participating in these 
discussions with Ghorbanifar were Adolph Schwim-
mer, an Israeli arms dealer who had been an adviser 
to Prime Minister Peres since September 1984, 
Amiram Nir, Peres' Adviser on Counterterrorism, and 
Yaacov Nimrodi, another arms dealer who had been 
an Israeli defense attache and then an unofficial "con-
sultant" in Tehran for a total of 24 years." At least 
one of these meetings included Roy Furmark, a busi-
ness associate of Khashoggi's and an acquaintance of 
Casey's.37 Israel and the United States were major 
arms suppliers to the Shah's Iran during the 1970s, 
and a classified State Department document says 
Israel had sold some arms to the Khomeini regime in 
1981 and 1982.* The arms dealers in the 1985 group 
had an obvious stake in resuming such sales. 
At roughly the same time, beginning in early 1984, 
the NSC staff was beginning to rethink the U.S. pos-
ture toward Iran. The net effect of the 1984 efforts 
was to conclude that the United States neither knew 
enough about, nor was in a position to have much 
influence over, future developments in that country. 
"Early in 1985," the Tower board wrote, "the NSC 
* According to a November 1986 classified State Department 
document, in 1981 and 1982, prior to the initiation of Operation 
Staunch, the Government of Israel asked the United States to 
approve shipment of certain military items under U.S. control to 
Iran. Israeli representatives made many of the same points that 
were made in the 1985 arms sale proposals, including that such 
transfers would improve access and influence with "moderate ele-
ments" and could lead to progress in securing the release of U.S. 
hostages. The United States stated that certain types of U.S. con-
trolled items could be shipped if specific U.S. Government approv-
al were obtained, but no shipment of such items was ever ap-
proved. In May 1982, Israeli officials acknowledged publicly that 
Israel had sold substantial quantities of U.S. origin military supplies 
to Iran. U.S. Department of State, Memorandum from Richard W. 
Murphy to Secretary of State Shultz, "U.S.-Israel Discussions on 
Arms Sales to Iran-1980-82," November 21, 1986, S3547. See also

staff undertook actions aimed at least to improve the 
government's knowledge about Iran"." 
One person who got involved with that job was 
NSC consultant Michael Ledeen. When Ledeen was 
in Europe in March or April of 1985, an official of a 
West European country told Ledeen that the situation 
in Iran was more fluid than it had been in the past. If 
Ledeen wanted to know more about Iran, the official 
said that Israel had the best intelligence there of any 
country in the Western world." Ledeen visited Israel 
in early May where he met alone for about 45 min-
utes with Prime Minister Peres to express the U.S. 
interest in learning more about Iran. The hostages 
were not part of this discussion, Ledeen said. Accord-
ing to Ledeen, Peres said that Israeli information was 
not all that outstanding, but Peres urged Ledeen to 
meet with Shlomo Gazit, President of Ben Gurion 
University and a former director of military intelli-
gence. In that subsequent meeting, Ledeen was asked 
to carry a request back to McFarlane asking for per-
mission for Israel to sell some artillery to Iran.4? 
During May and June, the NSC staff continued to 
work on a draft National Security Decision Directive 
(NSDD). At the end of its analysis of the United 
States' long and short term goals in Iran, a June 11 
draft NSDD recommended "provision of selected 
military equipment as determined on a case-by-case 
basis". McFarlane circulated the NSDD draft to 
Shultz, Weinberger and Casey. Shultz responded on 
June 29 by saying he disagreed "with the suggestion 
that our efforts to reduce arms flows to Iran should 
be ended." Weinberger's July 16 answer was sharper. 
"This is almost too absurd to comment on," he wrote. 
"This is roughly like inviting Qadhafi over for a cozy 
lunch." Only Casey endorsed the "thrust of the 
draft," but his July 18 response said nothing about 
arms sales.4' The draft NSDD was never brought to 
the President's attention and was not adopted. 
The two separate strands came together in the 
weeks after the draft NSDD was circulated and 
before all the answers were in. On July 3, McFarlane 
met with David Kimche, Director General of the 
Israeli Foreign Ministry. According to McFarlane, 
Kimche wanted to know "the position of our govern-
ment toward engaging in a political discourse with 
Iranian officials," and thought the Iranians would ulti-
mately need something, namely arms, to show for the 
meetings.4 2 
About July 11, Schwimmer came to see Ledeen. 
Ledeen testified that Schwimmer claimed he and his 
colleagues: 
had been introduced a short time before by 
Adnan Khashoggi to a very interesting Iranian 
by the name of Ghorbanifar, and that Ghorbani-
far had a lot of very interesting things to say 
both about Iran and about the intentions of the 
leading figures in the Government of Iran.43 
We do not intend to produce a full recitation of 
events here, but it is worth pausing at Schwimmer's 
reported statement that he had just been introduced to 
Ghorbanifar. The clear implication of the statement, 
as it was understood by Ledeen, was that Ghorbanifar 
was a new source of information for the Israelis, even 
though Ghorbanifar had been meeting with them 
since January. There is a dispute over Ghorbanifar's 
exact relationship with Israel, but no one seems to 
think the relationship was new. North, Poindexter, 
George and Hakim have said they thought Ghorbani-
far was an Israeli agent or asset.44 Hakim specifically 
said he thought someone working for Nimrodi had 
recruited Ghorbanifar years before in Tehran.45 
Shackley, however, described him as "an independent 
man" with SAVAK connections (Hakim had also 
mentioned SAVAK.) The view of Ghorbanifar as 
being essentially independent would be consistent 
with his having had a past relationship with Israel, 
but with different connotations on the extent to which 
Israel could have controlled Ghorbanifar. The inter-
pretation that stresses Ghorbanifar's independence 
gains some support from the sheer number and varie-
ty of methods Ghorbanifar tried to use to approach 
the United States Either way, however, Ghorbanifar 
and Nimrodi knew each other during Nimrodi's quar-
ter century of service in Tehran. Schwimmer's al-
leged representation to Ledeen that he was a new 
source therefore seems disingenuous, to say the least. 
So, Israel was more than a passive message bearer 
at the outset of the initiative. In addition, it weighed 
in to help keep the initiative on track at several points 
later. These included, among other things, an August 
2, 1985 visit Kimche paid to McFarlane to seek au-
thorization for the first Israeli TOW transfer;46 Nir's 
January 1986 proposal to keep the initiative moving 
forward at a time when U.S. interest appeared to be 
flagging,47 and Peres' February 1986 letter to 4 and 
September 1986 communication with President 
Reagan.4 9 
Shultz V. Shultz Suckers or Big Boys? 
The question that arises out of all this is whether 
Israel was playing on U.S. ignorance to draw the 
United States into the Iran arms transactions. At a 
November 10, 1986 meeting between the President 
and his top advisors, Secretary Shultz said, according 
to Donald Regan's notes, that he "Thinks Israeli [sic] 
suckered us into this so we can't complain of their 
sales." 50 Shultz apparently expanded on this point in 
a private meeting he held with the President ten days 
later. A briefing paper Shultz brought with him to 
that meeting stated: 
Much if not all of the incentive on the Israeli side 
of the project may well have been an Israeli 
"sting" operation. The Israelis used a number of 
justifications to draw us into this operation?in-

telligence gains, release of hostages, high strate-
gic goals, . . . Israel obviously sees it in its na-
tional interest to cultivate ties with Iran, includ-
ing arms shipments. Any American identification 
with that effort serves Israeli ends, even if Amer-
ican objectives and policies are compromised." 
We are inclined to agree with Shultz that Israel 
was actively promoting the initiative because the initi-
ative suited Israel's own national interest. We dis-
agree, however, with the idea that the United States 
was being played for a sucker. We believe the U.S. 
Government responsibly made its own judgments, and 
its own mistakes. 
To show the extent to which U.S. eyes were open, 
it is worth reviewing a few more items in the Com-
mittees' records. In McFarlane's July 13 cable to 
Schultz about his own meeting with Kimche and Le-
deen's meeting with Schwimmer, McFarlane seemed 
to be more aware than Ledeen that the relationships 
being described were not new ones. McFarlane said 
that in the course of his conversation with Kimche it 
"became clear that [their access to Iranian officials] 
has involved extensive dialogue for some time." His 
cable also mentioned Ghorbanifar.52 On the same 
day, Assistant Secretary Richard Armacost sent a 
cable to Shultz saying that the U.S. Government con-
siders Ghorbanifar to be "a talented fabricator." 53 
Shultz told the Tower Commission he read this cable 
on July 16.54 From early in the initiative, in other 
words, the U.S. Government had good reason to be 
wary of Ghorbanifar. 
Why, then, did the NSC want to pursue this chan-
nel at all? North's answer is persuasive. 
I knew, and so did the rest of us who were 
dealing with him, exactly what Mr. Ghorbanifar 
was. I knew him to be a liar. I knew him to be a 
cheat, and I knew him to be a man making enor-
mous sums of money. He was widely suspected 
to be, within the people I dealt with at the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency, an agent of the Israeli 
Government, or at least one of, if not more, of 
their security services. 
That is important in understanding why we con-
tinued to deal with him. We knew what the man 
was, but it was difficult to get other people in-
volved in these kinds of activities. I mean, one 
can't go to Mother Theresa and ask her to go to 
Tehran . . . . I know there is a lot of folks who 
think we shouldn't have dealt with this guy, but 
at the bottom we got two Americans out that 
way and we started down a track I think we 
could have succeeded on. As bad as he was, he 
at least got it started there.55 
The United States also went into the initiative 
knowing full well that there was far from an identity 
of interests between the U.S. and Israel. McFarlane 
528 
mentioned in his cable to Shultz at the start of the 
initiative, that the risks of failure would be different 
for the United States than for Israel: "Surely we 
ought to expect that Israel's fear over any Arab (as 
opposed to Iranian) fallout would not necessarily co-
incide with our own." 56 Shultz's cable of the next 
day also mentioned that "Israel's interests and ours 
are not necessarily the same".57 
As for the character of the difference between U.S. 
and Israeli interests toward Iran, several witnesses 
testified that the United States would like to see a 
quick end to the Iran-Iraq war, but Israel, at a mini-
mum, might find its interests served by prolonged 
fighting between the two countries.58 This key differ-
ence was said by McFarlane to have been openly 
discussed in his July 3, 1985 meeting with Kimche: 
[Kimche] said, "Obviously Israel's interests are 
very different from your own," and pointed out 
that they have an interest in sustaining the con-
flict. We don't. 
I stressed all of our policy points . . . . They are 
different in many respects from Israel's. But that 
was clear on both sides, going in, eyes open. The 
President was very conscious of that." 
Another major point of difference was that Israel, 
like most West European and many other countries, 
reportedly was selling arms to Iran. The United States 
was trying to stop the flow of such arms. For that 
reason, the specific method for trying to establish a 
relationship, involving arms and hostages, was a par-
ticularly risky one for U.S. policy interests. Once 
again, however, this point was thoroughly argued 
within the Administration. 
The point of all this is that Israel had good reasons 
for wanting the United States to get involved, but the 
U.S. had its own reasons for listening. The United 
States decided the initiative was worth pursuing, for 
all of the reasons we have already noted. To be sure, 
the U.S. did make important errors of judgment. It 
was overeager. On occasion, it did listen too uncriti-
cally to Israeli advice. But the warning flags were 
there, and McFarlane at least paid lip service to 
noting their presence. Any U.S. mistakes, therefore, 
can be laid only at our own country's feet. As Secre-
tary Shultz said before our Committees, "We are big 
boys and we have to take responsibility for whatever 
it is we do. We can't say that well, somebody else 
suggested it to us, therefore it is their fault." 
Hostages and the Iran Initiative 
We are convinced, as we have argued, that the Iran 
initiative started as a desire to pursue a strategic op-
portunity, and that these considerations always re-
mained important. At the same time, there can be no 
question?as the President himself acknowledged?

Chapter 8 
that the President's personal concern for the hostages 
added a sense of urgency that skewed our negotiating 
tactics, and helps explain the imprudently wishful 
thinking that led Poindexter and Casey to proceed 
despite repeated disappointments. 
It is important to note that the President has an 
affirmative duty under U.S. law to do everything in 
his power to secure the release of Americans illegally 
imprisoned or held hostage abroad. Under the 1868 
Hostage Act, invoked by President Carter during the 
Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-81: 
Whenever it is made known to the President that 
any citizen of the United States has been unjustly 
deprived of his liberty by or under the authority 
of any foreign government, it shall be the duty of 
the President forthwith to demand of the govern-
ment the reasons of such imprisonment; and if it 
appears to be wrongful and in violation of the 
rights of American citizenship, the President shall 
forthwith demand the release of such citizen, and 
if the release so demanded is unreasonably de-
layed or refused, the President shall use such 
means, not amounting to acts of war, as he may 
think necessary and proper to effectuate the re-
lease; and all the facts and proceedings relative 
thereto shall as soon as practicable be communi-
cated by the President to Congress." 
Under the Hostage Act, the President has a posi-
tive, legal obligation to take whatever steps may be 
necessary and proper, short of war, to secure the 
release of American citizens. Even without the act, 
however, we observed in our chapters on the Consti-
tution that the President has a duty to protect the 
lives and liberty of Americans abroad. 
Unfortunately, the duty to protect lives does not 
always give clear guidance about what to do in spe-
cific cases. Taking the wrong steps to save an individ-
ual hostage can make hostage taking seem profitable 
to terrorists. The methods used to save one hostage, 
in other words, may threaten countless other Ameri-
cans traveling or living abroad. We have to acknowl-
edge, however, that it is easier to put advice on a 
piece of paper than to implement the advice in the 
face of a constant barrage of public criticism, and 
direct pressure from the hostages' families. 
As hard as it may be to let any American remain 
hostage, one was a special case: William Buckley, the 
Beirut Station Chief. Buckley was rebuilding the 
CIA's Lebanon station after the disastrous embassy 
car bombing of 1983. When he was taken hostage, he 
knew a great deal about U.S. sources and methods in 
the Middle East and U.S. officials strongly suspected 
that he was being tortured to force him to divulge 
those secrets. 
Mr. CHENEY. I would assume partly on the 
basis that he was literally one of our own, a man 
in service to the nation, that there were special 
feelings on the part of Director Casey for Mr. 
Buckley as well? 
Mr. NORTH. It was my understanding that 
there was not only a professional relationship be-
tween Mr. Buckley and Director Casey but a 
personal one, and that Director Casey felt very 
strongly about William Buckley. To the very 
end, Director Casey was anxious to get the body 
of Bill Buckley home, and certainly the tortured 
confession. 
Mr. CHENEY. Would it be fair to say that the 
situation of the hostages, and especially Mr. 
Buckley, had an impact at least upon the policy 
decisions we have been talking about here in 
connection with the opening to Iran, the decision 
to ship weapons to the Ayatollah? 
Mr. NORTH. I believe it did. . . . One of the 
most difficult things that I experienced in this 
rather lengthy ordeal, and I am sure it was the 
same for Mr. McFarlane and Admiral Poindexter 
and the President, was to see the pictures that we 
were able to obtain, the videotapes particularly, 
of Bill Buckley as he died over time, to see him 
slowly but surely being wasted away.62 
This testimony from North certainly makes it easier 
to understand how concern for the hostages could 
come to have played too prominent a role in the Iran 
initiative. 
DEA Activities 
We shall digress briefly from the Iran initiative at this 
point to discuss another effort the Administration un-
dertook to gain the release of the hostages in Leba-
non. This one involved Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration (DEA) agents and began in early 1985. The 
majority is highly critical of this effort in its report. 
This is puzzling to us, because if the DEA operation 
had succeeded, there would have been no temptation 
to mix concern for the hostages with the strategically 
more important talks with Iran. 
The majority repeatedly describes the DEA activi-
ties, which were under North's direction, as an overt 
attempt to pay ransom for the hostages. Indeed, a 
number of the points made by the majority depend on 
the ransom theme. The importance of this claim, to 
the overall thesis of the majority report is that, if true, 
it would show a predisposition toward paying ransom 
that would tend to confirm an interpretation of the 
Iran initiative as an arms-for-hostages deal. We too 
would be troubled if ransom were being contemplat-
ed. But, according to the evidence received in the 
Committees' investigation, the DEA rescue plans con-
templated bribes as the means to gain the hostages'

Chapter 8 
release. There was no attempt to pay ransom to the 
captors. 
The majority discounts the testimony of one of the 
two DEA agents involved, whom we shall call Agent 
1. The agent clearly stated that the plan was to offers 
bribes to certain individuals, and not to pay ransom to 
those who had directed the capture of the hostages. 
The agent emphasized that none of the captors had 
solicited ransom. Rather, money was to be delivered 
as bribes to those who could effect the release of the 
hostages, not to the people who actually controlled 
the terrorist organization. The idea was to find indi-
viduals who could be paid off without the knowledge 
of those in control. The money was intended to go 
directly to these individuals.63 
The majority also ignores the account of the De-
fense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Major who served 
on the Hostage Locating Task Force in 1985 and 
1986. In January 1986, the DIA Major met with the 
other DEA agent involved in hostage activities, 
whom we shall call Agent 2, and with two sources 
who were assisting the DEA agents. The DIA Major 
observed that one of the two sources was more prom-
ising because of his contacts and superior access to 
the hostage takers." The DIA Major prepared a 
memorandum of these meetings, and he testified to its 
accuracy." According to the memorandum, the more 
promising of the two sources suggested bribery to 
free the hostages.66 
Furthermore, Agent 2 testified that when one 
source suggested that the Lebanese hostage takers 
would release the hostages in exchange for weapons, 
the agent dismissed the suggestion. Asked whether 
the subject of weapons was ever raised again, the 
agent replied: "No, because I think we had told the 
source that forget it, you know. It has got to be a 
bribe situation, not a ransom, but a bribe situation".67 
In fact, the questions from the majority's own counsel 
clearly recognized that the plan involved bribery.* 
A prime example of the majority's attempt to char-
acterize the DEA plans as ransom plans is their analy-
sis of activities in May and June of 1985. The majori-
ty alleges that the plan in that time-frame was to pay 
ransom money of $1 million per hostage. On the con-
trary, three memorandums on the issue, written by 
Col. North, all clearly described a plan to bribe indi-
viduals other than the hostage takers. The bribe 
money was to be paid to individuals with access and 
to those who would arrange transportation and safe 
passage for the hostages. None of these memoran-
dums mentioned any ransom payments to the hostage 
? The counsel stated during the deposition: "You were trying to 
bribe these people with money at the same time they were trying to 
get weapons from North" See Agent 2 Dep., 8/28/87, at 61. Later, 
the same counsel asked: "How were these people to be released? In 
other words, was it to be a forcible extraction. Was it to be a 
bribing. . . to look the other way?" The agent responded: "Brib-
ing. It was always bribing. May not even be bribing. It may be they 
go shoot all the guards." See Agent 2 Dep., 8/28/87, at 109. 
530 
takers." North's superior, Robert McFarlane, similar-
ly described the plan as one of bribery." 
The majority also claims that the DEA activities 
were inconsistent with the simultaneous effort to gain 
the release of the hostages through the Iran initiative. 
Such a claim is based on the majority's view that at 
the same time North was arranging to sell weapons to 
the Iranians to induce them to influence the Hizballah 
captors to release the hostages, North was offering 
direct ransom payments to the captors. As shown 
above, the majority's ransom notion conflicts with the 
facts. Also, the majority's theme of inconsistent chan-
nels for release of the hostages ignores the fact that 
the DEA activities, which commenced in early 1985, 
were in existence months before the first sale of arms 
to Iran in August and September 1985. In any event, 
the fact is that, notwithstanding the DEA plans as 
well as other plans for hostage release, the Iran initia-
tive did lead to the release of three hostages. Any 
alleged conflict or inconsistency is based on specula-
tion. Given the majority's inclination to criticize 
every perceived or misperceived activity of the Ad-
ministration in its effort to free the American hos-
tages, the case can be made that if North had not 
pursued alternatives to the Iranian arms sales, the 
majority would have found fault with such failure to 
find better ways to free the hostages. 
The last important majority contention is that the 
activities of the DEA agents were "operational" 
rather than intelligence-related, and that such activi-
ties therefore required that Congress be notified. The 
facts show that the DEA agents gathered intelligence, 
planned several operations to free the hostages, and 
took some preparatory steps for these operations. 
However, the actual operations to free the hostages 
did not take place, to a large extent because of events 
in the Middle East beyond the control of the agents. 
The participants should, however, have paid closer 
attention to accounting, funding, and reporting re-
quirements, in order to ensure full compliance with 
the applicable rules and regulations. 
In the final analysis, the DEA efforts to free the 
hostages must be viewed in perspective. The Presi-
dent was personally committed to do all that he could 
to bring the hostages home, and there was intense 
national pressure to do so. Accordingly, the Adminis-
tration initiated several alternative programs, includ-
ing the plan to use DEA assets in Lebanon. DEA 
efforts ultimately failed, and in hindsight these efforts 
could have been better implemented. Nonetheless, the 
facts show that many involved in these activities 
acted at great personal risk and with the best of 
intentions. Moreover, the Administration deserves 
recognition for its efforts to explore every promising 
avenue for the release of the hostages.

The Second Channel 
It is tempting, knowing Buckley's fate and the depth 
of the President's feeling, to portray U.S. policy as 
having become "hostage to the hostages." The hos-
tages did become too prominent. Negotiations con-
ducted through the First Channel, arranged by Ghor-
banifar, never got off the arms-for-hostages track, de-
spite repeated U.S. efforts. Once discussions began 
through the Second Channel, however, they began to 
take in broader geopolitical issues. Some aspects 
might potentially have been promising. Others, such 
as the Da'wa prisoners, should have been turned off 
from the beginning. 
The "First Channel" talks between Iran and the 
United States, from late 1985 through the May 1986 
Tehran trip, were arranged and principally conducted 
by representatives of the Iranian prime minister, who 
has ties to the more radical elements of the govern-
ment. Representatives of the so-called "middle of the 
road" Rafsanjani faction also appear to have attended 
some of these meetings. Rafsanjani, generally regard-
ed as the number two official in Iran,7? is the Speaker 
of the Majlis or Parliament and has principal responsi-
bility for foreign affairs and the conduct of the war. 
These early meetings used an unreliable intermediary, 
Ghorbanifar, who misled both sides and who thereby 
frustrated the progress of the discussions. 
The discussions during the Fall of 1986, on the 
other hand, generally referred to as the "Second 
Channel" meetings, were sought, arranged and con-
ducted by representatives of Speaker Rafsanjani. Raf-
sanjani proposed that representatives of the other fac-
tions be included in the joint commission that was to 
be established to pursue the normalization of rela-
tions." These changes in the leadership of the negoti-
ations appear to have corresponded with an increas-
ingly serious willingness on the part of the Iranian 
leadership to consider renewed strategic cooperation 
with the United States, although the leadership did 
not abandon its interest in acquiring arms in return for 
hostages. 
The Ayatollah Montazeri, a prominent religious 
leader who is virulently anti-American and a support-
er of radical fundamentalist violence in Saudi Arabia 
and elsewhere, was excluded from both sets of discus-
sions. It was later determined that Ghorbanifar had 
leaked information concerning the First Channel 
meetings, including the secret participation of Israeli 
representatives, to the Montazeri faction. This faction 
was responsible for disclosing the U.S.-Iran negotia-
tions in the Fall of 1986 in retaliation for the arrest of 
several of its leaders. After the disclosure, factional 
warfare within Iran and the U.S. public's response 
effectively ended the discussions. Since then, they 
have been overtaken by events in the Gulf. 
Negotiations 
The initial meetings with the second channel took 
place secretly in Washington, D.C. over two days in 
September, 1986. Detailed contemporaneous notes 
have been made available to the Committees. They 
show that Colonel North, accompanied by George 
Cave, a CIA expert on Iran, engaged in two-way 
discussions of the elements of a new relationship in a 
way that had not apparently been of interest to the 
previous channel. The discussions moved from broad, 
strategic objectives to a number of sensitive and 
highly specific points. According to the notes, these 
included the following: 
?U.S. and Soviet interests in Iran; 
?U.S. and Iranian interests in Afghanistan; 
?Iran's objectives in the Iran-Iraq war; 
?Soviet objectives in the Iran-Iraq war; 
?Intelligence information about deceased hostage 
William Buckley; and 
?Establishing secure communications between the 
two governments to avoid compromise by hostile 
third governments. 
The negotiators also raised the possibility of an ex-
panded military supply relationship, but the U.S. par-
ticipants made it clear that such a relationship presup-
posed resolution of the hostage situation, which was 
also discussed extensively.7 2 
The next significant meetings were held in October 
1986 in Frankfurt, West Germany. The U.S. partici-
pants were North, Cave, Secord and Hakim. The 
Iranians made it clear that they wanted the relation-
ship to go beyond a "merchant" or "trading" relation-
ship.73 The U.S. and Iranian representatives discussed 
common geopolitical interests extensively, and com-
pared available information. The discussion then 
turned to the extent to which the United States was 
willing to supply additional weapons to Iran. U.S. 
negotiators made clear that the weapons Iran had 
requested could be supplied if the hostage issue was 
resolved first.74 The U.S. and Iranian negotiators also 
discussed the Iran-Iraq war, the meaning of an honor-
able "victory" for Iran, the status of Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein. 7 5 
North then left the meeting after stating that his 
"Seven Point" proposal 76 was the full limit of his 
authority.* The Iranians made a counterproposal. 
Hakim and Secord were left with authority to try to 
come to an agreement with the Iranians, subject to 
approval by the U.S. Government. After some addi-
tional discussion, Hakim and Secord reached a new 
"Nine Point" agreement.77 It provided in substance 
for the release of one hostage, with a promise to 
attempt to obtain another, in return for the shipment 
of some U.S. weapons, instead of insisting on all of 
* He had to leave suddenly because he had learned that the 
airplane carrying Eugene Hasenfus had been shot down over Nica-
ragua. See North Test., Hearings, 100-7, Vol. II, at 6.

the hostages as North's original proposal had done. It 
also included a plan that might result in direct Irani-
an-Kuwaiti negotiations over release of the infamous 
Da'wa prisoners.** The agreement was reviewed by 
North and Poindexter and Poindexter claims to have 
briefed the President.78 The evidence indicates, how-
ever, that the President was not told about the Da'wa. 
When he learned about the Da'wa part of the talks 
later, the President found it repugnant." So do we. 
It is hard to reach a definitive judgment about the 
Second Channel meetings. Consider this exchange be-
tween Representative Hyde and Admiral Poindexter 
from the public hearings: 
Mr. Hyde: The conventional wisdom is that the 
Iran overture was a policy disaster. Is that not 
too precipitous a judgment? Shouldn't the jury 
still be out on that? Because if we do lack good 
intelligence, we don't really know whether we 
were getting somewhere or not on the hostage 
issue or the strategic opening. Is that a fair state-
ment? 
Mr. Poindexter: I think that is a very fair state-
ment. I think it is possible if the present people 
working this problem in government go about it 
properly, I think it is still possible. One of the 
interesting things is that we maintained contact 
with the second channel right up until the day I 
left the White House and we were alerting the 
channel as to what we were getting ready to do 
so that the President's speech, so that his press 
conference didn't surprise them. 
We got the Iranian Government to have their 
ambassador at the U.N. make a statement which 
referred to the United States in terms that are 
more favorable than ever had been made public 
by this particular Iranian Government, because I 
truly believe that with the second channel that 
we had established, we were in contact with 
some people that really wanted to bring about 
some changes in the Iranian Government that 
would be much to the benefit of the United 
States. 
I am not talking about returning to a situation in 
Iran that was the same as when the Shah was 
there, but turning the government around to a 
direction where we could indeed have a con-
structive relationship with them. 
**At the meeting in Frankfurt, North specifically told the Iranian 
representatives not what the United States would be willing to do 
to release the prisoners, but what the Iranians would have to do 
before the Kuwaitis would release them. See C378. North did not 
promise then or later to take any affirmative steps on behalf of the 
United States to seek the release of the Da'wa prisoners. George 
Cave testified to this effect as well. See Cave Dep., 9/29/87, at 
152-53. See also Id. at 56.

I think it is still possible that that may come 
about." 
In some respects, the actual results of the Second 
Channel negotiations?a small shipment of arms, the 
release of one hostage?were similar to the earlier 
agreements conducted through the First Channel. 
Two elements of the Second Channel meetings were 
different, however. First, although some of the same 
people participated in meetings held through both of 
the channels, the Second Channel meetings involved a 
different, more powerful leadership. Second, the Ira-
nians this time clearly seemed to recognize that if the 
hostage problem could be finally resolved, the United 
States and Iran had important, mutually compatible 
interests that might well sustain a substantially in-
creased level of cooperation. 
The precise elements of the strategic relationship 
being discussed were decidedly mixed, however. 
Some were beneficial to the United States, such as the 
exchanges of information over mutual geopolitical in-
terests in the region. Others, such as proposed Da'wa 
release, were not. North may have been correct in 
saying that the position he endorsed on the Da'wa did 
not exactly contradict publicly stated U.S. policy." 
This technical accuracy does not begin to account, 
though, for the way such a position would have un-
dermined U.S. credibility. It is another example of the 
NSC staff thinking about literal compliance, without 
adequately considering the long term political conse-
quences. 
Conclusion: The Role of the NSC 
Staff, and Others 
The Tower Commission concluded that the Iran initi-
ative was pursued with a flawed decision process 
managed by the NSC staff, and suggested that the 
procedural flaws were responsible for some of the 
initiative's substantive errors.82 The Tower board, we 
believe, underestimated the extent to which major 
issues were aired and argued before the President 
from November 1985 through January 1986. But the 
board was right to say that the lack of regular proce-
dures, fostered by an excessive concern for secrecy, 
short-circuited the process of periodic review and 
evaluation?both of the substantive desirability of 
continuing the initiative, and of the decision not to 
notify Congress. 
To describe what happened simply in terms of the 
process, however, leaves some important questions 
unanswered. It is true that good organization can help 
make sound decisions more likely. But organization, 
at best, is a tool. The real flaw in the NSC's Iran 
negotiations, as well as in the NSC's deceptions of 
Congress over Nicaragua, came from errors in judg-
ment. The question, therefore, is: what can an admin-
istration do to ensure that people with the appropriate

Chapter 8 
breadth and depth of judgment are fully involved in 
the process at the appropriate stages? The majority 
report seems to want to get at this issue by legislating 
organization for the executive branch down to the 
finest detail. We are convinced, however that no one 
formula will work best for all Presidents. 
It is important not to let the record be closed with 
a naked criticism of the NSC staff, such as the one 
with which we closed our review of the Second 
Channel negotiations. The NSC's weakness, and the 
way the Iran initiative and Contra support programs 
gravitated toward the NSC, point to issues that go 
beyond this particular NSC and the specifics of this 
investigation. The NSC staff operated within a con-
text that was also a part of the problem. 
Presidents can use their NSC staffs in a variety of 
different, and equally valid, ways. One President 
might prefer a staff that filters and summarizes. An-
other might want a more active, more politically at-
tuned and more powerful NSC staff. Like the Tower 
Commission, we do not think it is appropriate to tell 
Presidents how to arrange the people who work for 
them. The best organization is the one that works best 
for the elected official who bears final responsibility. 
But an administration's style, overall, has to be one 
that fits together in all of its parts. If the NSC staff is 
to operate primarily as an honest broker, that imposes 
responsibilities on cabinet officers chosen for their 
judgment. If the cabinet officers fail to meet those 
responsibilities, they end up leaving policy initiation, 
oversight, substantive review and political review to 
people who may not have those tasks as their primary 
strengths. 
The Reagan Administration has been beleaguered 
from the beginning by serious policy disagreements 
between the Secretaries of State and Defense, among 
others. That in itself in not unusual. The perspectives 
of those two departments often produce disagree-
ments, under many Presidents. One reason Presidents 
need an NSC staff is precisely to help the President 
benefit from the differences within his administration, 
and not suffer from them. We have learned in our 
hearings that President Reagan has been willing to act 
decisively to settle policy differences when they are 
presented to him. He has not been as successful, how-
ever, in ensuring that all such important differences 
are brought to his personal attention. In addition, he 
has not taken a strong hand in settling issues on 
which policies, personnel conflicts and turf battles 
merge. One result has been that some people in the 
Administration have had an interest in seeing the 
NSC staff play the role of honest broker, and not 
being an independent source of power. Their interest 
coincided with President Reagan's own preference for 
cabinet government, and for a less independently 
powerful NSC staff than those of his predecessors. 
It is ironic that many have looked upon the Iran-
Contra Affair as a sign of an excessively powerful 
NSC staff. In fact, the staff's role in the Iran and 
Nicaragua policies were the exceptions of the Reagan 
years rather than the rule. When Robert McFarlane 
resigned in December 1985, both Chief of Staff 
Donald Regan and Secretary Shultz were wary of a 
strong successor. Passing over some widely discussed, 
and independently powerful people, such as Jeane 
Kirkpatrick, the President chose McFarlane's deputy, 
Admiral Poindexter. Press accounts written at the 
time saw Poindexter's selection in precisely these 
terms, as a decision to have the National Security 
Adviser play the role of honest broker.83 This image 
of the NSC lasted almost until the moment the Iran 
arms initiative became public.84 Poindexter was seen 
as a technician, chosen to perform a technical job, not 
to exercise political judgment. 
Poindexter is a talented man. In addition to his 
skills as a naval officer, he is highly intelligent, 
knowledgeable about international relations, and expe-
rienced with procedures in the Reagan White House. 
He was not the sort of man, however, who normally 
sought to initiate policy or engage in jurisdictional 
battles. On the other side of this same character trait, 
he had little feel for the "people" side of domestic or 
international political strategy. That would not be a 
problem, however, as long as he managed to stay in 
the role of honest broker. 
Of all people, White House Chief of Staff Donald 
Regan surely should have known of Poindexter's 
strengths and weaknesses. He should not have tried to 
second-guess everything the National Security Advis-
er did, but his job in the White House did require him 
to take note of when issues were likely to cause the 
President political problems. Even if Regan were not 
an expert in the substance of the international issues, it 
was his job to stay on top of the political implications 
of the NSC staff's activities. That alone should have 
led him to see red warning flags, and to make a 
careful check, when North was asked to testify about 
support for the Nicaraguan democratic Resistance 
after press accounts and a formal Resolution of In-
quiry. He should have had a similar reaction when 
the NSC never reviewed the decision not to notify 
Congress about the January 17 finding. 
One way of looking at Poindexter's mistakes is to 
say that they were just waiting to happen. Once the 
NSC staff had to manage two operations that were 
bound to raise politically sensitive questions, Poin-
dexter was not well equipped to handle them. It is not 
satisfactory, however, for people in the Administra-
tion simply to point the finger at him and walk away 
from all responsibility. For one thing, the President 
himself does have to bear personal responsibility for 
the people he picks for top office. But the problem 
here may not have been who was picked. Instead, it 
may be that a person chosen to do one kind of a job 
as National Security Adviser suddenly was thrust into 
a very different kind of a situation. The question,

Chapter 8 
therefore, is: how did it happen that the NSC came to 
play so prominent a role in the Iran-Contra Affair? 
There is no mystery why the NSC staff became so 
important for U.S. policy toward Nicaragua. North's 
powerful personality, and disputes within the Restrict-
ed Interagency Group before Abrams became Assist-
ant Secretary of State, both contributed to North's 
growing power. But the fundamental reason for the 
NSC's prominence, beginning in 1984, was the Boland 
Amendment. Once that amendment was passed, the 
CIA and State Department were all but read out of 
the picture. The NSC staff was able to operate under 
the restriction, and it did. 
The evolution of the NSC's role in the Iran initia-
tive was more accidental. David Kimche brought Is-
rael's proposal to McFarlane in August 1985, instead 
of to the State Department, because he knew McFar-
lane well, because the State Department had rejected 
similar overtures in the past, and because he knew the 
issue would have to be decided by the President. The 
NSC staff was asked for flight assistance, instead of 
State, in November 1985, for essentially the same rea-
sons. In January 1986, Amiram Nir saw Poindexter 
and North partly because Nir and North were their 
respective governments' counterparts on counterter-
rorism and had worked closely together in that capac-
ity, partly because the hostages made this a 
counterterrorism issue, partly because the initiative 
had already started in the NSC, and partly, or mostly, 
because Secretries Weinberger and Shultz were 
strongly opposed to the arms sales. 
In addition, the CIA was more than happy not to 
be managing the operation itself. It was content, as 
former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John 
McMahon has said, to play a support role." Clair 
George, the Deputy Director for Operations, ex-
pressed even stronger feelings, as did his whole direc-
torate, because Ghorbanifar was being used as the 
intermediary. After having issued a burn notice on 
Ghorbanifar once before, Casey asked George to re-
evaluate him. The agency reinterviewed Ghorbanifar 
in late December 1985 and gave him a second poly-
graph in January 1986.66 George told North how 
poorly Ghorbanifar had done, and then told Casey: 
"Bill, I am not going to run this guy any more,' which 
means in our language, 'I will not handle him; he is a 
bum.' " 87 
There were a number of reasons peculiar to the 
particular operation, in other words, that explain why 
the NSC staff ended up running the Iran initiative. It 
is important to remember, however, that this function 
was an aberration. But the NSC lacked not only a 
person at the top who was picked for policy judg-
ment; it also lacked operational experience.* There 
? However, the NSC played an operational role in a series of 
risky foreign activities during the Reagan Administration: the raid 
on Libya, the freeing of the American students on Grenada, and 
the capture of the Achille Lauro seajackers. Admiral Poindexter 
534 
were people with such experience in the line agencies, 
but their Secretaries were vehemently opposed to the 
initiative. 
In the best of all textbook worlds, the department 
secretaries and other political appointees would ac-
knowledge the President's decision and work hard to 
make sure the decision is implemented professionally. 
As George Shultz said in his testimony, however, 
issues never seem to be settled in Washington." Con-
cern was rampant throughout the government that 
trusting anyone to run a policy he or she opposed 
vigorously was an open invitation to having the 
policy undermined, through leaks or otherwise. The 
situation helps explain why the NSC staff, when run-
ning a dangerous operation during which hostages 
could easily be killed, decided to be secretive. 
There can be no question that the NSC denied 
Secretaries Shultz and Weinberger some information 
they should have had. However, if one looks at the 
record presented in testimony, it is also clear both of 
the Secretaries had many indications of what was 
happening. Weinberger did not push as hard he might 
have done to insist on a policy review, but we do not 
accept the Tower Commission's conclusion that he 
simply distanced himself from what was going on. On 
the other hand, the Tower Commission's assessment 
of Shultz seems more accurate. He does seem to have 
distanced himself, and then complained loudly after-
ward about what had happened. 
Let us begin with Weinberger. During our hear-
ings, the Secretary of Defense described himself as 
having been "pretty horrified" at a November 10, 
1986 White House meeting, when he heard Poin-
dexter give what the Secretary described as Poin-
dexter's first general exposition and report on the 
initiative." In contemporaneous notes, Weinberger 
also said he was surprised to learn that the President 
had signed a finding for the initiative in January 
1986.9? It would be misleading to treat Weinberger, 
however, as if he were left in the dark. For example, 
even though Weinberger did not know the President 
had signed a finding on January 17, he did attend a 
meeting at which the finding was discussed the day 
before, and he did know the Defense Department was 
shipping weapons to the CIA for Iran in February. 
He also learned about McFarlane's trip to Tehran 
from reports even though he had not been told about 
it in advance by Poindexter, and he knew about the 
pointed out that nobody (Congress and press included) ever com-
plained about the NSC's role in these successful operations. It was 
not until the problems with the Iran initiative and the Contra 
assistance program (both highly controversial foreign policy initia-
tives) that the NSC's operational role was questioned. Poindexter 
Test., Hearings, 100-8, 7/17/87, at 167-168. This raises a serious 
question as to whether the NSC should be legislatively prohibited 
from ever playing an operational role to assist the President with 
sensitive and risky activities that the State and Defense Depart-
ments bureaucraties might be too cumbersome to react to effective-
ly.

October 1986 shipment." When he did not see all of 
the hostages come out, he could have said it was time 
to see how the policy was working. In fact, Wein-
berger said that he did make the point "all through 
that year" to Admiral Poindexter. 
I talked to Mr. Poindexter so many times, and I 
don't remember whether the President was 
present at some of those meetings or not. I think 
he may well have been, but I am not sure of that. 
But the continued objection was made all 
through that year with repeated?my repeatedly 
calling attention to the fact that it wasn't work-
ing.92 
Weinberger was repeatedly told by Poindexter, 
however, that the President had made up his mind 
and it was useless to keep rearguing the point." 
Weinberger probably could have insisted on a review 
anyway. Poindexter's past record, however, led 
others, mistakenly on this one issue, to see him as a 
person who (a) carried cabinet level messages faithful-
ly and (b) was not an inordinate risk-taker. We have 
to surmise from Weinberger's behavior, therefore, that 
he accepted Poindexter's characterization and con-
cluded that the issue was not important enough to 
him to be worth repeated pushing. Other battles, over 
arms control for example, must have been of higher 
priority. 
Shultz is more open: to criticism than Weinberger, 
in our view. For one thing, the Iran initiative directly 
went against Operation Staunch and other State De-
partment programs He had more reason bureaucrati-
cally to insist on an active role, and more solid rea-
sons than Weinberger to think the initiative might be 
running counter to the positions he and his depart-
ment were charged with enforcing. 
Secretary Shultz submitted a chronology to the 
Committees that listed an impressive number of occa-
sions on which he was led by Poindexter to think that 
the United States was not contemplating or engaged 
in arms sales to Iran.94 Nevertheless, there are also a 
significant number of occurrences that would have 
given a more engaged Secretary, or one who wanted 
to be more engaged, an opportunity to insist upon 
being fully informed. 
For example, on December 5, 1985 Shultz was 
briefed by Poindexter on Iran. In that briefing, Shultz 
complained about the State Department being cut out 
of distribution on certain reports. Despite the com-
plaint, the reports did not start coming to him.95 
From the very beginning of Poindexter's tenure as 
National Security Adviser, therefore, Shultz was 
given a strong signal that he would have to be very 
aggressive to stay on top of all of the relevant infor-
mation he would need to know. Then, in January, 
Shultz all but told the secretive Poindexter that he 
would let him be the judge of what he thought Shultz 
should be told about Iran: 
What I did say to Admiral Poindexter was that I 
wanted to be informed of the things I needed to 
know to do my job as Secretary of State. 
But he didn't need to keep me posted on the 
details, the operational details of what he was 
doing. That is what I told him. 
Now, the reason for that was?I'm not?this is 
the gist of what I told him. I don't remember the 
exact words, but that was about it. The reason 
for that was that there had been a great amount 
of discussion of leaks in the Administration, justi-
fiably so. . . . I felt it would probably leak, and 
then it wouldn't be my leak." 
Shultz insisted that he intended and expected to be 
informed about major issues. But he did leave it to 
Poindexter to decide which issues were which. 
On January 7, 1986, the President held a meeting to 
discuss Amiram Nir's proposal to resume the arms 
sales with Iran. Shultz, Weinberger, Meese, Casey, 
Regan and Poindexter were there. Shultz and Wein-
berger opposed selling arms to Iran, as they had in 
past meetings. Unlike other meetings, Shultz said, "it 
seemed to me that as people around the room talked, 
that Secretary Weinberger and I were the only ones 
who were against it." 97 
Then, on January 16, Shultz attended a cabinet 
meeting at the White House. After the meeting, he 
was invited to come back later in the afternoon for a 
meeting about Iran. Shultz said he could not attend 
because he had another engagement. In our hearings, 
Shultz made a point of complaining that he did not 
know the meeting was to discuss what became the 
January 17 finding." But he must have known, after 
the January 6 meeting, that arms sales and hostages 
were on the agenda. Weinberger, Meese, Casey, Spor-
kin and others attended the meeting, which was held 
in Poindexter's office. The finding was discussed ex-
tensively. Weinberger could have begged off on the 
same grounds as Shultz, by saying that the President 
was aware of his view. But the Defense Secretary 
attended and heard a thorough discussion of the find-
ing. Shultz stayed away, did not send a stand-in, and 
never asked for, let alone insisted upon, a briefing on 
what had happened. After this sequence, one could 
certainly understand how Poindexter got the impres-
sion that Shultz did not really care to be informed. If 
this meeting did not give off every signal of a major, 
policy event, it is hard to know what would. And if 
Shultz chose not to come or to inquire afterwards, 
what should Poindexter have been expected to con-
clude about how much to tell the Secretary? 
On February 28, Poindexter told Shultz that hos-
tages would be released the following week and that 
Iranians wanted a higher level meeting, but even after 
the January meeting Shultz did attend, this news did 
not prompt Shultz to ask about arms. Shultz also

Chapter 8 
approved the Terms of Reference for McFarlane's 
trip to Tehran on February 28. The trip was delayed 
repeatedly. Then, on May 3, Shultz received a cable 
while he was attending a summit meeting with the 
President in Tokyo. The cable said that the U.S. Am-
bassador to Great Britain had learned that a British 
businessman, Tiny Rowlands, had been approached 
by Nir to take part in an arms transaction with Iran 
that had White House approval and included Ghor-
banifar and Khashoggi. 
Don Regan . . . told me that the President was 
upset and this was not anything he knew about, 
and Admiral Poindexter told me, I think his 
words were something like "We are not dealing 
with these people. This is not our deal." 
He told Ambassador Price, who called him, that 
there was, I think his words were, "only a smid-
gen of truth in it," something like that.99 
It is puzzling to us how Shultz could have been 
reassured by what Poindexter told him in Tokyo. The 
phrases "this [as opposed to something else?] is not 
our deal" and "smidgen of truth" should invite skepti-
cism. 
What is the point of reviewing Shultz's record of 
disengagement? Shultz and Weinberger left the im-
pression in our hearings, whenever they were asked 
about the subject, that the main reason to have asked 
for an NSC review of how the Iran policy was being 
implemented would have been to reargue the Presi-
dent's basic decision. But surely, that is not the only 
obligation a cabinet secretary owes to his President. 
Full NSC members have a responsibility to remain 
engaged to make sure (1) that the President's policies 
are being implemented correctly, with a proper eye 
for consequences not noted by an agency running an 
operation, and (2) to insist that the President periodi-
cally review important policy decisions, so all power 
is not left in the hands of the people most committed 
to pushing forward. 
If a top official cannot honestly serve his President 
in this way, raising questions about implementation 
even when disagreeing with the underlying policy 
decision, then it is time to think about resigning. 
Presidents need the judgment and support, even if it is 
536 
honestly skeptical support, of their top appointees. If 
the appointees find the policy so repugnant that they 
can only distance themselves from it, then they are 
not doing their best to serve. Weinberger did make 
sure that the Defense Department aspects of the oper-
ation were implemented properly. Shultz simply failed 
to find out about the aspects of the negotiations that 
directly affected his own department's responsibilities. 
Everyone who had a stake in promoting a techni-
cian to be National Security Adviser should have 
realized that meant they had a responsibility to follow 
and highlight the political consequences of operation-
al decisions for the President. Even if the cabinet 
officials cannot support the basic policy, they have an 
obligation to remain actually involved, if they could 
manage to do so without constantly rearguing or un-
dermining the President's basic policy choice. That is 
an essential corollary of a system of cabinet govern-
ment, with a relatively weak National Security Coun-
cil staff. If the NSC staff is not expected to provide 
independent judgment, somebody else must do so. 
It is at least theoretically possible that the idea of a 
strong cabinet government, with a weak NSC staff, 
will not meet any President's needs in today's interna-
tional climate. That is, with the constant pressure of 
events and the inevitability of interdepartmental dis-
agreement, it is possible that future Presidents will 
decide that some important issues over the course of a 
full term inevitably will require them to have some-
thing more than an honest broker as National Security 
Adviser. If the need is inevitable, Presidents would be 
well advised to choose people who are known for 
their independent skills at understanding the strategic 
politics of international relations, both domestically 
and abroad. President Reagan certainly reached this 
conclusion when he picked Frank Carlucci to replace 
Poindexter, and we expect that General Powell will 
also turn out to be a person with the requisite sense of 
judgment. But Presidents should not simply assume 
that the Iran-Contra affair automatically proves the 
inevitable need for an independently powerful NSC 
staff. President Reagan's approach toward governing 
automatically requires something from the cabinet 
that was not supplied in this case. The model, in other 
words, was never given much of a chance.

Iran: The Legal Issues 
These Committees' hearings and the majority report 
have trivialized important disagreements over interna-
tional policy, and the political relationships between 
the legislative and executive branches. In an attempt 
to gain partisan advantage, the majority has focused 
upon legal disputes, trying to portray the Committees' 
role as that of prosecutor. We have indicated several 
times that we have some policy disagreements with 
the Administration's actions of 1984-86. We disagree, 
for example, with the decision to sell arms to Iran and 
to withhold notification to Congress for as long as the 
President did in this case. We also think it was a 
political mistake for the President not to have con-
fronted Congress over the Boland Amendment in 
1984. In neither case, however, do we think the Ad-
ministration made serious legal missteps. Our reason-
ing with respect to the Boland Amendment was laid 
out in an earlier chapter. Here, we examine the major 
legal points raised by the majority in criticism of the 
Iran initiative. We conclude that the Administration 
was in subtantial compliance with the law throughout 
the Iran initiative. 
Introduction 
The Iran arms sales involved two different kinds of 
transactions. The 1985 shipments involved sales, from 
Israel to Iran, of arms Israel had purchased from the 
United States. The President gave his verbal approval 
for these sales,* and the U.S. assured Israel that the 
weapons could be replenished from U.S. stocks. The 
August-September 1985 TOW missile sales took place 
without any direct U.S. participation. A shipment 
problem in November 1985 brought General Secord 
into the picture. Ultimately, the CIA also became 
involved in a minor, peripheral way, because (1) 
Secord used a CIA proprietary, at commercial rates, 
to ship the missiles and (2) because CIA personnel 
became involved in trying to help arrange transship-
ment through a European country. Because of the 
CIA's participation, the CIA's General Counsel, Stan-
ley Sporkin, drafted a written Presidential Finding 
within days of the event that was signed by the Presi-
* For the dispute over this point, see Tower, B-19-23. These 
Committees have developed no important new evidence on the 
point. 
dent about December 5, 1985. This is the Finding 
Admiral Poindexter said he destroyed in November 
1986.1 A draft of the Finding has been entered into 
the Committees' record as an exhibit.2 The 1986 ship-
ments, in contrast, all involved the shipment of U.S. 
arms through a commercial cutout, the Secord-Hakim 
"Enterprise." All of these shipments were adequately 
described and fully covered by a written Presidential 
Finding signed January 17, 1986. 
The basic law governing most sales of U.S. arms to 
other countries is the Arms Export Control Act 
(AECA).3 Under the AECA, the President is re-
quired to notify Congress of covered arms sales, and 
Congress has an opportunity to pass a joint resolution 
prohibiting major sales, if it can get the President's 
signature or a two-thirds veto override vote. The 
AECA also requires special waivers if a sale is to be 
made to a country, such as Iran, that has been named 
by the Secretary of State as one that supports interna-
tional terrorism.4 Finally, the AECA requires any 
country that receives arms under the terms of the act, 
such as Israel, to notify the President of any proposed 
transfers to third parties or countries, and to limit 
such transfers to countries or organizations otherwise 
eligible to receive arms under the terms of the act. 
Under this provision, transfers from Israel to Iran 
would be governed by the same notification and 
waiver requirements as direct sales or transfers from 
the United States. Similar restrictions apply to the 
retransfer of arms given to another country under the 
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961.5 Under the 
AECA and the FAA, sales of munitions valued at less 
than $14 million are not subject to the formal report-
ing requirements outlined in 22 U.S.C. 2753 (d). Arms 
sales may also proceed covertly under the National 
Security Act,6 with prices set under the terms of the 
Economy Act.7 The National Security Act does con-
tain rules requiring notification of Congress,8 and the 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment to the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 limits the use of appropriated funds to 
support CIA foreign operations, to ones for which the 
President finds the operation to be important to the 
national security.3 The legal issues raised by the arms 
sales to Iran may therefore be summarized as follows: 
(1) Did the arms sales of 1985, from Israel to Iran, 
violate the terms of the AECA or FAA?

Chapter 9 
(2) Did the 1985 Israeli sales to Iran violate the 
requirements for Presidential authorizations or Find-
ings under the terms of the National Security Act and 
the Hughes-Ryan Amendment? 
(3) Did the 1986 sales violate the National Security 
Act's requirements for notifying Congress? 
Our answer to each of these questions is no. We 
conclude that the Administration was in substantial 
compliance with the law during each of the Iran 
transactions. 
Export Controls and the 1985 
Shipments 
All of the arms transfers before January 17, 1986?
that is, the transfers of August, September, and No-
vember 1985?were accomplished by Israel's ship-
ment of weapons from its own supplies. These weap-
ons were originally obtained from the United States 
and were sent to Iran with the understanding that the 
United States eventually would replenish Israeli 
stocks. 
It is reasonable to assume that the weapons Israel 
shipped to Iran in 1985 were originally supplied under 
the AECA or FAA. These two statutes do permit the 
President or the Secretary of State to consent to re-
transfers, provided that certain conditions are satis-
fied. Under the Arms Export Control Act, these con-
ditions are that the United States itself must be able to 
sell weapons to the third country directly; that the 
third country transferee must agree in writing not to 
retransfer without U.S. permission; and that Congress 
must be notified. ? The Foreign Assistance Act con-
tains provisions similar to the first two above, but no 
notification provision." It should be noted that while 
the Letter of Offer and Acceptance" Israel signed in 
receiving arms in the first instance required it to re-
ceive written authorization from the U.S. for re-
transfer of weapons to a third party, neither the 
AECA nor the FAA require a written authorization. 
In these instances, Israel received oral authorization 
for the retransfers. Because each of these transactions 
involved less than $14 million, compliance with the 
formal reporting requirements of the AECA and 
FAA is not required.' 3 
The retransfer restrictions of the AECA and FAA 
were intended to cover situations in which the trans-
ferring country, rather than the United States, is the 
sole source of the retransfer request. The laws seek to 
ensure that such retransfers foster the national securi-
ty interests of the United States. But in the case of the 
Iran arms sales, the Israeli shipments were made with 
the agreement of American authorities, and Israel was 
promised and later was given substantially identical 
replacements. Clearly, the Iran arms sales were pre-
mised on U.S. views about America's own national 
security interests. In short, the substantive purposes of 
the AECA and FAA were met. 
540 
An Alternative Route 
The National Security Act provides an alternative 
legal route to using the AECA or FAA. Like the 
AECA and FAA, the National Security Act presup-
poses some kind of Presidential determination. Specifi-
cally, the determination must be that an action?in 
this case a retransfer?would "affect" the national 
security." If the CIA is involved, the so-called 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment requires a more emphatic 
Presidential determination. Instead of saying an activi-
ty must "affect" national security, Hughes-Ryan says 
it must be "important." More significantly, this deter-
mination must be made personally by the President, 
and reported in a "timely fashion" to Congress. 
We believe that the terms under which the Presi-
dent may use the National Security Act in fact meet 
all of the underlying purposes of the AECA and 
FAA, and that is why Congress has been satisfied to 
let the one approach be a substitute or alternative 
route to the other.* The fact is that the 1985 Israeli 
transactions essentially?and legally?were equivalent 
to ones in which the United States sold the weapons 
directly to Iran. 
The evidence indicates that Israel participated in 
the 1985 transactions in reliance on U.S. assurances, 
provided by the NSC staff with the President's ap-
proval, that the U.S. would not oppose the transac-
tions, and that the U.S. would replenish the arms 
Israel sent to Iran. The same arms could have been 
supplied lawfully, however, directly from American 
stocks. Indeed, the transactions of 1986 did proceed 
directly, under the authority of the National Security 
Act and the Economy Act. Assistant Attorney Gener-
al Cooper pointed out in his December 17 memoran-
dum to the Attorney General: 
[I]t is apparent that the real nature of the 1985 
transactions was a bilateral sale by the United 
States to Iran, with Israel serving solely as a 
conduit or facilitator in the execution of that sale. 
We see no reason to treat the legality of Israel's 
participation differently than we would treat the 
participation of any other party that served as a 
conduit in a lawful covert operation. Had the 
United States consigned weapons from American 
stocks to Israel for shipment to Iran, Israel's role 
would have been exactly equivalent to the role 
that common carriers and public warehouses play 
in overt transactions. Because, so far as we know, 
the weapons that Israel shipped to Iran in 1985 
and received from the United States were com-
pletely fungible, a similar equivalence is present-
ed here. Just as an illegal sale of arms to Iran 
* There are differences in the formal reporting requirements, to 
be sure. In some circumstances, we might imagine that such differ-
ences could be significant. In this particular retransfer, they were 
not.

Chapter 9 
would not be made legal by using Israel as a 
conduit, so too a legal transaction could not be 
made illegal by Israel being used in the same 
way.15 
The Laws Governing Covert Action 
We turn now to the laws governing covert operation, 
which were the ones under which the Administration 
was operating. In our earlier chapter on the Constitu-
tion, we argued that the President has the inherent 
authority to use special agents and to encourage or 
order covert activities. Once the President begins 
using appropriated funds, however?including salaried 
personnel?Congress can put strings on the use of 
such funds. Congress can, for example, tie the Presi-
dent's hands in knots by appropriating money for only 
one specified operation at a time. For any number of 
important national security reasons, we noted in the 
Constitution chapter, the Congress has recognized 
that the President needs a contingency reserve fund 
to meet changing conditions during the course of a 
fiscal year. Once Congress gives the President a con-
tingency reserve, there are lines of inherent Presiden-
tial authority that Congress may not properly cross. 
Those lines come into play most importantly in the 
extremely rare circumstance when the President has 
legitimate reason to believe that reporting must be 
withheld. We shall discuss this issue below. For any 
circumstances outside the extreme, however, Con-
gress has put a number of requirements on the Presi-
dent that seem to us to pass constitutional muster. 
For most of the country's history, covert activities 
were conducted by giving the President a contingen-
cy fund, without any additional, explicit statutory au-
thorization. The first law codifying this power was 
the National Security Act of 1947. That law estab-
lished the National Security Council and gave it the 
power, among others, to perform "such other func-
tions as the President may direct . . . .In the 
polite language of the post-World War II diplomatic 
world, in which covert activities were not acknowl-
edged publicly by governments, everyone understood 
this term to give broad authority to the President to 
use the NSC as he saw fit. Another title of the same 
law, however, created the CIA as the government's 
main body for conducting such activities: 
It shall be the duty of the Agency, under the 
direction of the National Security Council . . . to 
perform, such other functions and duties related 
to intelligence affecting the national security as 
the National Security Council may from time to 
time direct.17 
Historically, this language has been understood to au-
thorize a wide range of foreign covert activities, in-
cluding arms transfers. 
Covert Transactions 
The position that covert arms sales could proceed 
without triggering the requirements of the AECA 
was expressed as the Administration's interpretation 
of the law in October 1981. In conjunction with one 
covert transaction that year, Davis R. Robinson, 
Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State, wrote: 
It seems clear that Congress has not regarded the 
FAA and the AECA as an exclusive body of law 
fully occupying the field with respect to U.S. 
arms transfers. There are several illustrations 
where Congress, having been made aware of 
transfers to foreign countries outside that body of 
specific authorities, has reacted by enacting limit-
ed restrictions or reporting requirements rather 
than by prohibiting such transfers altogether." 
Robinson noted that if Congress had thought the 
AECA and FAA completely covered the field, it 
would not have passed the Clark Amendment of 1976, 
prohibiting covert aid to Angola, or the Hughes-Ryan 
Amendment establishing separate fmding and notifica-
tion requirements for CIA covert operations. 
Three days after the Robinson memo was written, 
Attorney General William French Smith forwarded a 
copy to Director Casey. Smith wrote: 
We have been advised by the State Department's 
Legal Adviser that the Foreign Assistance Act 
and the Arms Export Control Act were not in-
tended, and have not been applied, by Congress 
to be the exclusive means for sales of U.S. weap-
ons to foreign countries and that the President 
may approve a transfer outside the context of 
those statutes." 
The Attorney General concurred with this opinion, 
and Congress was well aware of this fact. 
Congressional awareness is shown most clearly in a 
provision of the Intelligence Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1986. This provision, which became a 
new section to the National Security Act, reads as

junction with an intelligence or intelligence-relat-
ed activity); or 
(B) the transfer--(i) is being made pursuant to 
authorities contained in part II of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, [or] the Arms Export 
Control Act . . . .20 
This act makes it clear, beyond any doubt, that 
Congress intended some covert arms transfers to 
occur outside normal AECA channels. It was precise-
ly for this reason that it put in a threshold to trigger 
the reporting requirements under the provisions gov-
erning reporting and Congressional oversight of intel-
ligence. 
The General Accounting Office agreed with this 
conclusion. In a March 1987 report on the direct U.S. 
arms sales to Iran, the GAO said: 
Since Congress has explicitly recognized that in-
telligence activities may include the secret trans-
fer of arms (Intelligence Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 1986, section 403 [quoted above as 
section 503 of the National Security Act]), the 
CIA is authorized by the Economy Act to turn 
to other agencies for that equipment. Therefore, 
we believe that the decision to use the Economy 
Act to provide support for this covert transaction 
was proper. 
Transfers of equipment by the CIA and others, 
including foreign governments, are governed by 
applicable laws relating to intelligence and spe-
cial activities, rather than the Arms Export Con-
trol Act, which ordinarily governs overt arms 
transfers overseas. Consequently, we consider 
those transfers to be subject to the requirements 
pertaining to the conduct of intelligence and spe-
cial activities. As a general rule, those transfers 
would not be subject to the pricing or reporting 
restrictions applicable to overt arms transfers 
conducted under the Arms Export Control 
Act.2 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment 
The direct statutory regulation of special activities 
began only recently, in 1974. In that year, Congress 
passed the Hughes-Ryan Amendment to the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961. As amended by the Intelli-
gence Oversight Act of 1980, Hughes-Ryan reads as 
follows: 
No funds appropriated under the authority of this 
or any other Act may be expended by or on 
behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency for op-
erations in foreign countries, other than activities 
intended solely for obtaining necessary intelli-
gence, unless and until the President finds that 
each such operation is important to the national 
security of the United States. [The following was 
542 
added in 1980 to replace earlier "timely notifica-
tion" language.] Each such operation shall be 
considered a significant anticipated intelligence 
activity for the purpose of section 501 of the 
National Security Act of 1947. [Section 501 is the 
1980 Oversight Act] 22 
As pathbreaking as Hughes-Ryan was at the time, 
its omissions are at least as important as its coverage 
for analyzing the Iran arms sales. Hughes-Ryan ap-
plies only to those covert operations involving the 
expenditure of appropriated funds by or on behalf of 
the CIA. 
August-September 1985 Transactions 
Specifically, the omissions of Hughes-Ryan mean that 
the Israeli's TOW transfers to Iran in August and 
September 1985?which did not in any way involve 
the CIA?did not require a covert action Finding 
under the terms of the law.* In fact, no written Find-
ing was made at that time. Nonetheless, there is evi-
dence indicating that the August-September and No-
vember 1985 shipments were carried out pursuant to 
the oral authorization of the President. In fact, the 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment contains no requirement 
that this Finding be reduced to writing or that it be 
articulated in any particular form. The main purpose 
of the Presidential finding requirement is to ensure 
that the President himself decides, before each such 
operation, whether the national security justified its 
being carried out. An oral authorization therefore sat-
isfies the Hughes-Ryan finding requirement.** 
We do believe it would be better to reduce covert 
action Findings to written form, so as to memorialize 
the undertaking and to avoid any confusion in imple-
mentation and notification. Certainly, all of the 1985 
arms shipments should have been preceded by a writ-
ten Finding or Findings. Paying more attention to 
* It should be noted that Executive Order No. 12333 on United 
States Intelligence Activities (Dec. 4, 1981, 46 Fed.Reg. 59941) 
extended the finding requirements of Hughes-Ryan to the "intelli-
gence community." As we have already pointed out in the Boland 
Amendment chapter, however, this language, and the earlier lan-
guage of the Oversight Act of 1980, were crafted deliberately to 
exclude the NSC, which was the only U.S. government agency 
involved in even tangentially in the August-September shipments. 
** This is the position taken by Assistant Attorney General 
Cooper in, Cooper Memorandum, "Legal Authority . . . ", n. 15 
infra, at 7-8. In the President's National Security Decision Direc-
tive (NSDD) 159, dated January 18, 1985, there is a provision 
stating that the appropriate procedure for Presidential approval of 
covert actions is a written Presidential Finding. (See Ex. BGS-15, 
Hearings, 100-5.) However, this procedure, having been instituted 
for the internal use of the President and his intelligence advisers, 
cannot be considered to be legally binding on the President. Writ-
ing about Executive Order 12333, which if anything must have 
greater binding authority than a classified NSDD, Cooper said: 
Activities authorized by the President cannot 'violate' an executive 
order in any legally meaningful sense, especially in a case where no 
private rights are involved, because his authorization creates a valid 
modification of, or exception to, the executive order. Id. at 14.

formalities could have eliminated a number of legal 
issues which have been raised. But this criticism of 
the White House's past administrative practices is not 
intended to suggest that the shipments themselves did 
not meet the legal requirements. 
November 1985 Transaction 
One difference between the summer and the Novem-
ber shipments in 1985 was that the CIA did play a 
role, albeit a minor one, in November. It should be 
emphasized that this shipment consisted of a mere 18 
HAWK missiles, and the CIA did not pay for their 
transportation. CIA officials merely referred North 
and Secord to a CIA proprietary airline, and this 
airline transported these missiles in a single plane as a 
strictly commercial transaction with full payment by 
Secord's enterprise to the airline. No CIA funds fi-
nanced the shipment. The CIA's only direct role in 
this shipment was to facilitate overflight clearances 
from foreign governments. Thus, the CIA provided 
logistical support for a secret initiative conducted by 
the NSC staff. 
There has been an inordinate amount of attention 
paid to the CIA's role in the November 1985 ship-
ments. The underlying. theory seems to have been (a) 
that the CIA and others in the Administration knew 
the November 1985 shipment was illegal and (b) that 
attempts to "cover up" the 1985 "illegalities" explain 
the altered chronologies, shredding and other events 
of November 1986. We consider both the theory and 
the underlying premise to be unfounded. For one 
thing, we do not consider the November 1985 ship-
ments to have had legal problems, except possibly 
ones of a technical, minor sort. 
Allegations that the CIA covered up an illegal 
action have been fueled by the mysterious disappear-
ance of a cable Duane (Dewey) Clarridge allegedly 
sent to Country 15 on November 22 and one alleged-
ly sent back to him from the same country the next 
day. The officer sending the second cable has said it 
informed headquarters that he had learned from Gen. 
Secord that the flight would contain HAWK mis-
siles." There have been questions about what hap-
pened to these cables. Clarridge specifically denies 
ever having received the second one, and said that so 
do the Deputy Director for Operations and others in 
the DDO's office who would normally have received 
a copy. 24 Clair George, the DDO, confirmed this 
testimony." Moreover, Clarridge said, he did not 
think the difference between HAWKs and oil-drilling 
parts was all that significant from the agency's point 
of view, since both were embargoed items." 
We do not believe that support of this sort rises to 
the level of a CIA covert action that would require a 
Finding under Hughes-Ryan. The action, at most, 
should be treated as being de minim& In any event, 
there is evidence that the President orally approved 
this HAWK shipment from Israel to Iran, and a writ-
ten Finding was made within days. Then-CIA Gener-
al Counsel, and now U.S. District Judge, Stanley 
Sporlcin, who had as much experience interpreting 
Hughes-Ryan as any other federal official, testified 
that when CIA Deputy Director John McMahon told 
him to draft a Finding to cover the CIA's involve-
ment, Sporlcin thought a Finding was not required by 
law in this instance, even though he agreed it was 
prudent.27 According to John Poindexter, who in 
early December 1985 succeeded Robert McFarlane as 
Assistant to the President for National Security Af-
fairs, the President signed the Finding, probably on 
December 5, 1985.28 By its terms, the Finding ratified 
the prior actions that the US. government took to 
obtain the release of the American hostages. 
The November-December 1985 Finding reflected in 
written form that the President had been briefed 
before the shipments on the efforts made to obtain the 
release of the hostages, and that the President himself 
had found that these efforts were important to the 
national security of the United States. Therefore, in 
both the oral Findings referred to earlier, and the 
written Finding itself, the President accordingly rati-
fied all prior actions and directed further actions to be 
taken. 
As for the 1986 arms transfers, the President's writ-
ten Finding of January 17, 1986 clearly and obviously 
satisfied Hughes-Ryan for all of them. These Findings 
covered both the U.S. sales to Iran, and the portion of 
the May 1986 transaction that replenished Israeli 
stocks for the 1985 transfers. 
Timely Notification 
Our closing pages on the Constitution contained an 
extensive analysis of why Presidents have the inherent 
power, under exceptional circumstances, to defer noti-
fying Congress of a covert operation. Congress wisely 
recognized this fact when it passed the Intelligence 
Oversight Act of 1980. 
The Oversight Act was an outgrowth of the the 
proposed intelligence charters of the 1970s, which we 
outlined in our chapter on the Boland Amendments. 
In this chapter, we shall concentrate on one aspect of 
that law, the requirement for Administration reports 
to Congress about intelligence activities. That law 
appears in the statute books as a new section 501 of 
the National Security Act." Under section 501(a), 
the Director of Central Intelligence or the heads of 
other agencies or entities involved in intelligence ac-
tivities,* are required to keep the intelligence commit-
tees of Congress "fully and currently informed of all 
intelligence activities," including "any significant an-
* We showed in the Boland Amendment chapter that the lan-
guage in the Oversight Act deliberately excluded the NSC from 
these requirements.

ticipated intelligence activity." However, section 
501(a) further provides: 
[I]f the President determines that it is essential to 
limit prior notice to meet extraordinary circum-
stances affecting vital interests of the United 
States, such notice shall be limited to the chair-
man and ranking minority members of the intelli-
gence committees, the Speaker and minority 
leader of the House of Representatives, and the 
majority and minority leaders of the Senate. 
This is the provision that permits an Administration 
to limit advance notification to a so-called "Gang of 
Eight." The law also specifically contemplates a situa-
tion, however, in which notifying the Gang of Eight 
might be too risky. Consider this wording from sec-
tion 501(b): 
The President shall fully inform the intelligence 
committees in a timely fashion of intelligence op-
erations in foreign countries, other than activities 
intended solely for obtaining necessary intelli-
gence, for which prior notice was not given under 
subsection (a) and shall provide a statement of the 
reasons for not giving prior notice. [Emphasis 
added.] 
While we agree with the majority that the idea of 
"timely" notification almost always envisioned a short 
time period, the rare conditions under which prior 
notification has been withheld could not possibly have 
been defined in calendar or other precise statutory 
terms. As a result, the decision not to notify must of 
necessity rest on Presidential discretion. 
The constitutional basis for withholding notification 
was recognized in, but, of course, does not depend 
upon, the "preambular" language of section 501: 
To the extent consistent with all aprflicable au-
thorities and duties, including those conferred by 
the Constitution upon the executive and legisla-
tive branches of the Government, and to the 
extent consistent with due regard for the protec-
tion from unauthorized disclosure of classified in-
formation and information relating to intelligence 
sources and methods . . . [the intelligence com-
mittees are to be kept informed of various intelli-
gence activities]. 
Thus, section 501 acknowledges that reporting re-
quirements cannot limit the constitutional authority of 
either the executive branch or the legislative branch, 
and further recognizes the need to protect sensitive 
information from disclosure. 
The legislative history of the Oversight Act firmly 
supports our interpretation of its language. Consider 
the following explanation of the pending conference 
report on the Oversight Act by Rep. Boland, then the 
Intelligence Committee chairman: 
544 
When prior notice is not given to the committees 
or to the smaller group of eight, the conference 
report makes clear that the full Intelligence Com-
mittees must receive reports on the covert oper-
ation "in a timely fashion."3? 
Clement J. Zablocki, then Chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee as well as a member of 
the Intelligence Committee, pointed out: 
In addition, the legislation makes the fundamental 
recognition that in extraordinary circumstances 
advance information on covert operations might 
be withheld from the Select Committees on Intel-
ligence, provided the President informs the com-
mittees in a timely fashion and provides a state-
ment of the reasons for not giving prior notice. 
Mr. Speaker, this recognition of the need for 
limited exceptions to prior reporting of covert 
operations is fully consistent with the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs amendment to Hughes-Ryan. 
I therefore welcome its inclusion in the confer-
ence report. Such exceptions are absolutely essen-
tial to a strong intelligence community and im-
portant for U.S. security. 
Such exceptions will also help the American in-
telligence community to maintain the extraordi-
nary secrecy necessary in intelligence activities 
and promote cooperation from the intelligence 
communities of friendly countries.31 
William Broomfield, Ranking Republican on the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, observed: 
Henceforth, in extraordinary circumstances af-
fecting vital national interests?the President will 
be allowed to defer reporting to Congress on 
CIA covert action operations abroad. The key 
word here is defer. The President is not excused 
forever from letting us know about such activi-
ties. This is not an abdication of our oversight 
responsibility. We are just allowing him to post-
pone his reporting in those rare instances where, 
for example, prior disclosure would jeopardize 
the lives of the personnel or the methods em-
ployed in a particular covert action activity. As 
the conference report notes?"If prior notice of a 
covert operation is not given, the President must 
fully inform the select committees in a timely 
fashion and provide a statement of the reason for 
not giving prior notice." 
Is that unreasonable? It seems to me common 
sense dictates that we allow the President this 
flexibility so that he can effectively discharge his 
constitutional responsibility to conduct foreign 
policy. In this connection, let us not forget that 
covert action is an important and sometimes vital 
aspect of foreign policy and has been utilized by

Chapter 9 
Presidents all the way back to George Washing-
ton. 
A number of my colleagues have expressed con-
cern about how often a President might invoke 
the deferred reporting option provided by this 
measure. A look at the record to date is illumi-
nating in this regard. Since the passage of the 
Hughes-Ryan Amendment in 1974, there has 
been only one known covert action that was not 
reported to Congress prior to its initiation. Our 
committee was subsequently briefed on that 
action and learned that the reason for the de-
ferred reporting was because the President felt 
such prior notification could jeopardize the lives 
of the personnel involved in that action. More-
over, participants in this successful operation?
which we all applauded when we became aware 
of it?agreed to participate in the action only 
after being assured that there would be no prior 
disclosure to Congress.3 2 
Essentially the same interpretation was put on the 
bill by Rep. Les Aspin, who was then a member of 
the Intelligence Committee. What makes Aspin's 
statement particularly important is that it came from a 
member who was unhappy with what he perceived as 
the bill's "vague" language. After describing, and 
complaining about, the provision to limit notification 
to the chairmen, Aspin then went on to note: "There 
is, second of course, the possibility, and I guess the 
statutory possibility that the Administration can, in 
effect, just waive the whole thing".33 
There can be no question from the legislative histo-
ry, in other words, that the statute contemplated situ-
ations in which the President would not give prior 
notification. The remaining question is, how long is 
"timely"? We would maintain that the answer must 
vary with circumstances. To weigh circumstances re-
quires one to use discretion; that function, therefore, 
must, belong to the President. 
Was 11 months too long for President Reagan to 
have withheld notification of the Iran arms sales? We 
think so; he could have purchased what Rep. Henry 
Hyde has described as some good political "risk insur-
ance" early by coming to Congress and getting Con-
gress on board.* On the other hand, we are also well 
aware that President Carter withheld notification for 
about six months in a parallel hostage crisis. In fact, 
President Carter, in his four years in office, withheld 
notification two or three times?about the same 
number of times and for roughly the same kind of

waiting period as President Reagan.** In any event, 
whenever it finally comes time to notify, the Presi-
dent will have to pay a significant political price if 
Congress is not persuaded by the reasons the Presi-
dent gives for having withheld notice. 
Conclusion 
We conclude that the Administration was in substan-
tial compliance with the law during each of the Iran 
arms transactions. The arms sales of 1985 from Israel 
to Iran did not violate the terms of the AECA or 
FAA. It is reasonable to assume that the weapons 
Israel shipped to Iran in 1985 were originally supplied 
under AECA or FAA. These two statutes permit the 
President or the Secretary of State to consent to re-
transfers. In these instances, oral authorization was 
given for the transfers. Moreover, the formal report-
ing requirements do not apply because each of these 
transactions involved munitions valued at less than 
$14 million. The AECA and FAA seek to ensure that 
such retransfers foster the national security interests 
of the United States. The Israeli shipments were made 
with the agreement of American authorities and were 
premised on U.S. views about America's own national 
security interests. The substantive purposes of the 
AECA and FAA were met. 
Moreover, the 1985 Israeli sales to Iran did not 
violate the requirements for Presidential authoriza-
tions or Findings under the National Security Act and 
the Hughes-Ryan Amendment. The National Security 
Act provides an alternative route apart from the 
AECA and FAA under which the Administration 
was in compliance with the law during the 1985 trans-
actions. The terms under which the President may use 
the National Security Act meet all of the underlying 
purposes of the AECA and FAA. Therefore, Con-
gress has been satisfied to let the one approach be a 
substitute or alternative route to the other. 
The Hughes-Ryan Amendment contains no require-
ment that Presidential Findings be reduced to writing. 
The November-December 1985 Finding reflected in 
written form that the President had been briefed 
before the shipments on the efforts made to obtain the 
release of the hostages, and that the President himself 
had found these efforts were important to the national 
security of the United States. Therefore, in both the 
oral Findings of 1985, and the written November-
December 1985 Finding, the President accordingly 
ratified all prior actions and directed further actions 
to be taken. With regard to the 1986 transactions, the 
President's January 17, 1986, Finding clearly satisfied 
the Hughes-Ryan Amendment. 
** These examples were discussed previously in the closing sec-
tion of chapter 4. As was there pointed out, in one of the cases 
Canadian participation was conditioned on a U.S. agreement not to 
notify Congress until Americans hidden in the Canadian Embassy 
were safely out of Iran.

Chapter 9 
Finally, the 1986 arms sales did not violate the 
National Security Act's requirements for notifying 
Congress. Certainly, the National Security Act re-
quires agencies involved in intelligence activities to 
keep the intelligence committees of Congress "fully 
and currently informed of all intelligence activities." 
However, the law specifically contemplates situations 
in which notifying the appropriate Congressional 
members might be too risky. The act requires that in 
instances in which the President has not given prior 
notice of intelligence operations, he must inform the 
intelligence committees in a "timely" fashion. 
The decision not to notify must rest on Presidential 
discretion. The reporting requirements of the National 
546 
Security Act cannot limit the constitutional authority 
of the President to withhold prior notification of 
covert activities in exceptional circumstances. In this 
case, the lives of hostages were at stake such that 
premature notification was extraordinarily dangerous 
to the lives of American citizens. We conclude that, 
in circumstances such as these, the President must 
have the discretion to determine when notification is 
"timely." If Congress, after the fact, disagrees. with 
the way in which the President has exercised his 
discretion, the appropriate remedy is a political and 
not a legal one.

Chapter 10 
The Use or "Diversion" of the Iran Arms Sales 
Proceeds 
"What did the President know, and when did he 
know it?" That was Senator Howard Baker's famous 
crystallizing question about President Nixon from the 
Senate Watergate hearings of 1973. Political tensions 
were heightened in the Iran-Contra Affair when the 
same question was asked about the so-called "diver-
sion" of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicara-
guan democratic resistance. The very term "diver-
sion," given currency by Attorney General Edwin 
Meese's press conference of November 25, 1986, had 
the sound of illegality. 
Beginning with the first public revelations about the 
Iranian arms sales in early November 1986, reaction 
in the United States was a mixture of curiosity, puz-
zlement, And controversy. The Attorney General's 
press conference added a new dimension to the furor. 
The prospect that money had been sent to the Con-
tras during the period of the Boland Amendments 
greatly intensified the scrutiny the Iran initiative re-
ceived in the media. Speculation ran unchecked. The 
Attorney General put the amount that might have 
been diverted at $10 million to $30 million.1 Members 
of the Congressional investigating committees sug-
gested that the amount might have been as high as 
$50 million.2 Ultimately, the diversion received more 
scrutiny than any other aspect of the Iran-Contra 
Congressional investigations. 
The evidence is overwhelmingly clear, however, 
that the President did not in fact know about the 
diversion, despite Democratic wishes to soft-peddle 
the point by attacking Adm. Poindexter's credibility. 
In addition, the use of the word "diversion" itself 
assumes that the funds belong to the United States. 
We shall show later in this chapter that the legal 
questions surrounding the ownership of the proceeds 
from the Iran arms sales are by no means settled. 
Before we can reach these points, however, it is first 
necessary to explain what the diversion was, how it 
came about, and how much was transferred. 
What Was The Diversion? 
What has dome to be called the diversion was simply 
a transfer of a portion of the proceeds of the Iranian 
arms sales to the private Contra resupply operation 
under the direction of Gen. Secord. The funds came 
from two different sources. The initial diversion ap-
pears to have been from Israeli funds. In late 1985, 
after the sale of HAWK missiles by Israel to Iran, 
North informed Secord that the Israelis would not ask 
for the return of the unused transportation expense 
and that Secord could use it for other purposes. 
Secord testified that he used it for the Contra project 
and so informed North.3 
After the United States began selling Iran its own 
arms in February 1986, the transfers took place out of 
the portion of the Secord-Hakim funds that were left 
after the so-called "Enterprise" paid the U.S. Govern-
ment all that it was owed under Economy Act 
prices,* and after other immediate, operational ex-
penses. This remaining money has been referred to as 
the "excess," the "profits," or the "residuals," with 
each characterization resting on a different point of 
view about the ownership of the funds. 
The American arms sales to Iran were carried out 
under a January 17, 1986, Finding signed by the 
President. Sales purposely were not organized as a 
direct government-to-government transfer. Rather, 
the operation was dependent on middlemen. Col. 
North, Gen. Secord, Albert Hakim, Adm. Poindexter, 
Clair George of the CIA, Attorney General Meese, 
and all others associated with the initial planning of 
the Iranian covert operation described it in the same 
manner: the United States would sell arms to Gen. 
Secord, acting as a commercial cut-out, who would in 
turn sell the arms to Manucher Ghorbanifar, who 
would in turn sell the arms to the Iranians. From the 
American standpoint, the organizational structure was 
desirable for several reasons. It gave the U.S. Gov-
ernment some distance from the operation, which 
would provide maximum protection and plausible 
deniability. It also satisfied the Attorney General's 
and Secretary Weinberger's legal concerns about pro-
ceeding under the terms of the Arms Export Control 
Act. 
The Economy Act established the basis on which 
the Department of Defense, in February 1986, sold 
the CIA 1000 TOWs for $3.7 million dollars, or 
$3,700 per TOW. The price to be paid by the Iranians

Act.

was not statutorily limited, however. Ghorbanifar ap-
parently offered $10,000 per TOW as early as August 
1985. This price eventually became the purchase price 
Ghorbanifar paid to Secord in late February 1986. It 
should be noted that $10,000 per TOW was not an 
exorbitant price. The replacement cost in 1986 of the 
TOW missiles utilized in the arms sales was approxi-
mately $8,000.* Under these arrangements, there was 
an obvious surplus. Ghorbanifar had paid Secord, the 
commercial middleman, the agreed-upon price of 
$10,000 per TOW, and Secord had paid the CIA the 
Economy Act price of $3,700 per TOW. The surplus 
on the February transaction after transportation and 
other expenses was on the order of $6.3 million. 
How Did The Diversion Happen? 
The concept of transferring a portion of the excess 
proceeds from an arms sale to another project was 
not a new one. Gen. Singlaub explained that he and 
North had discussed this concept in connection with 
arms sales to an entirely different country in early 
1985.** When the Israeli arms sales to Iran begin in 
1985, the U.S. was aware that the Iranians were 
paying relatively high prices for the arms compared 
to what Israel had paid for them. This meant that the 
United States could reasonably conclude that some 
funds were being put to other uses by Israel. 
Secord and North were both aware that the Con-
tras needed money. By late 1985, they had both been 
involved in obtaining funds and arms for the Resist-
ance. The specific decision to transfer a portion of 
Iranian arms sales proceeds to the air resupply oper-
ation was the result of a number of factors, one of 
which was General Secord's involvement in both op-
erations. 
The first time a possible surplus came to North's 
attention was after the November 1985 sale of 
*U.S. General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairmen, 
Senate and House Select Committees Investigating Iran Arms 
Sales, Iran Arms Sales, DOD's Transfer of Arms to the Central 
Intelligence Agency, March 1987, p. 11. The replacement cost is 
difficult to calculate with specificity. The basic TOWs sold in 
February were obsolete and were to be replaced by an improved 
model. 
"Singlaub Test., Hearings, 100-3, 5/20/87, at 76. Typical of the 
majority's tendentious treatment of the evidence in its diversion 
chapter is how much it tries to make out of the so-called "Singlaub-
Studley" plan for transferring arms sales proceeds to anti-commu-
nist insurgents. Yet, after a three page discussion of this plan, the 
majority states: "The Singlaub-Studley plan was not implemented. 
. . ." The majority continues " . . . but the idea of using sophisti-
cated U.S. weapons to finance arms . . . was known to those 
working to support the Contras before any proceeds from U.S. 
sales of arms to Iran were first received." A careful reader will 
note that the majority is thereby admitting that the first diverted 
funds, those obtained by Israeli sales of arms to Iran, were received 
before the Singlaub-Studley plan was tabled in December, 1985. 
One can only wonder why the majority is intent on glossing over 
this aspect of the history which the majority itself develops, and 
instead assigning another intellectual patrimony to the diversion.

HAWK missiles from Israel to Iran. Secord had been 
provided with $1 million by the Israelis to cover 
transportation for the missiles from Israel to Iran. 
When the Iranians expressed dissatisfaction with the 
initial delivery, further deliveries were stopped, and 
Secord had spent only $200,000 of his retainer. 
Secord testified that the $800,000 surplus was eventu-
ally spent on the Contra resupply project.4 Hence, 
the initial diversion appears to have occurred with 
Israeli funds. It set the pattern for the future. 
Secord testified that he had not viewed the Iranian 
operation as generating any profits for him or his 
partners. His foremost concern, he said, was having 
sufficient capital reserves to ensure continued oper-
ations.5 When, as it turned out, the sales generated 
money in excess of that needed for adequate reserves, 
he was more than receptive to the suggestion that he 
send the excess funds to the resupply operation. Col. 
North had a similar divergence of interests. As strong 
as his commitment was for the success of the Iranian 
operation, it was equally strong for the Contras. 
When surpluses were available, he was unmistakably 
motivated to advise Secord to use them for the Nica-
raguan democratic resistance. 
According to Col. North's public testimony, the 
idea of sending the Contras some of the surplus gener-
ated by the direct U.S. to Iran arms sales was offered 
by Ghorbanifar in late January. Earlier that month, or 
perhaps in late December, North had discussed with 
Nir the possibility of using excess funds for joint U.S.-
Israeli operations, but said that this discussion never 
involved using the money for the Nicaraguan resist-
ance.6 North testified that during a January meeting 
in London, Ghorbanifar spoke with North in a hotel 
bathroom and specifically suggested using the surplus 
for the Nicaraguan resistance.7 North saw an excel-
lent opportunity to get the Khomeini regime, which 
was openly supporting the Sandinistas, to unwittingly 
arm the Contras. He thereafter set prices sufficient to 
create a surplus and encouraged Secord to send all 
available surpluses to the Resistance. After the end of 
our hearings, the Committees received an unsworn, 
unverified, and unverifiable document purporting to 
show that North first conceived of a diversion to the 
Contras by early December. An Israeli chronology 
claimed that North told Israeli supply officials in New 
York on December 6 that the Contras needed money, 
and that he intended to use proceeds from the Iran 
arms sales to get them some. When North was asked 
about the December 6 meeting, he reiterated that he 
did not recall discussing the Contras with anyone 
involved in the Iran initiative before the late January 
meeting with Ghorbanifar.8 
We are inclined to believe North in this dispute, 
largely because his testimony was sworn and he was 
granted immunity from all charges arising out of the 
testimony except that of perjury. Ultimately, howev-
er, this dispute is of little importance because even if

Chapter 10 
the idea was expressed in early December, it never 
went beyond North until after the January London 
meeting. Poindexter testified that he first heard of the 
idea when North asked him to authorize it in Febru-
ary.9 North testified that he first mentioned the idea 
to the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. 
Casey, at about the same time, in late January or early 
February, after the post-finding London meeting." In 
addition, North and Poindexter both testified that no 
one else in the U.S. Government was told about a 
diversion before this time. What that means is that the 
diversion cannot possibly have been a consideration 
for people at the policymaking level before North's 
January London meeting with Ghorbanifar.? 
How Much Was Diverted? 
The most reasonable calculations show that approxi-
mately $3.8 million of proceeds from the Iran arms 
transactions was spent for the support of the Nicara-
guan Resistance.* During the period that the "Enter-
prise" received income from the Iranian transaction 
(November 1985 through November 1986), it also had 
other funds available for support of the Resistance 
that totaled $3.4 million. Much of this money came 
from foreign and private domestic donations specifi-
cally earmarked for the Contras. During that same 
period of time, the "Enterprise" spent approximately 
$7.2 million in support of the Contras. If one subtracts 
the $3.4 million in non-Iran funds designated for the 
Resistance, then the remainder of the $7.2 million, or 
$3.8 million, was the total amount of the diversion.** 
? The Committees have, indeed, received evidence that the Janu-
ary 17 Finding was revised several times in January 1986 to reflect 
U.S. strategic goals more clearly. In addition, hearing testimony 
specifically showed that the "commercial cutout" arrangement was 
designed to mirror the previous Israeli arms sales structure for 
security reasons, after the U.S. had decided to make direct sales to 
avoid legal questions under the Arms Export Control Act. In short, 
both the Finding and the transactions were restructured for reasons 
unrelated to the diversion, which could still have been accom-
plished just as readily even if Israel had continued to be either the 
seller or had been the intermediary. 
*The partners in the "Enterprise" also paid themselves $1.2 mil-
lion in "commissions" out of the Iranian proceeds. That sum can be 
considered to have been "diverted," but it is hard to see it as an 
expenditure for the benefit of the Contras and the Committees have 
not done so. 
"The majority's statements about the amount of money diverted 
represent what appears to be an amusing political compromise. The 
majority says that "at least" $3.8 million . . . in arms sales profits 
were used for the Contras. Yet the reader is given no factual basis 
whatsoever for the conclusion that more than $3.8 million was 
diverted, a fact apparently indicative of the continuing disagree-
ment between parts of the majority about what the Committee's 
records show. Since we accept the $3.8 million number as a maxi-
mum, the majority view of the Committee actually is that $3.8 
million was diverted. 
Who Authorized The Diversion? 
The diversion was authorized by Poindexter. The 
Committees were careful when taking testimony on 
this point to make sure that the principal witnesses 
would testify in private session before they had a 
chance to hear the crucial public testimony of this 
particular point. Thus, Poindexter testified in private 
session, before North's closed session or public testi-
mony, that he had authorized the diversion at North's 
request." North corroborated this point in his own 
executive session testimony before he could have 
known anything about what Poindexter had said.f 
Poindexter also testified that he believed he had the 
authority to make the decision on his own to approve 
the use of the Iranian arms sales surplus for the Nica-
raguan Resistance11 He said that because he had 
worked for the President for a number of years, he 
felt he knew what the President would want to have 
done in this situation. Poindexter stated that to him, 
the diversion appeared to involve the use of what 
could be considered either third-country funds, or 
private funds, to support the Contras, and that he 
believed the President favored the use of such private 
or third-country funds to support them. Therefore, in 
his view, the President would have agreed to the use 
of surplus funds in such a manner. However, Poin-
dexter said, because he thought it would be politically 
(as opposed to legally) controversial to use the funds 
to support the Contras, he decided not to inform the 
President of it so the President could truthfully deny 
knowledge if the diversion were revealed." 
The President has stated, however, that he would 
not have consented to the diversion had he known 
t North Dep., 7/1/87, at 7. The majority purports to show a 
conflict between Poindexter and North over the question of the 
time lapse between when North requested approval of the diversion 
and when Poindexter approved it. Obviously, the majority is con-
ceding here that North did request approval from Poindexter, and 
that Poindexter gave it. Moreover, even a casual reader of North's 
testimony will see that North had no specific recollection of how 
long it was before Poindexter got back to him. North said, "I don't 
recall specifically on this case?but my normal modus operandi on 
making a proposal such as that would be to go over and sit down 
with the Admiral . . . . Normally the Admiral would like to think 
about it . . . . (North Test., Hearings, 100-7, Vol. I, 7/10/87, p. 297, 
emphasis added). Counsel then asked: "Did you?do you recall how 
long after you first told him about this orally he got back to you?" 
North responded: "No, I don't. I guess it was a matter of weeks?or 
days or weeks certainly, because by February, we did it." (Id. at 
298, emphasis added). Curiously, the majority ignores this testimo-
ny, which would conflict with its preordained conclusion. 
tt North also testified in private session that he assumed until 
November 21, 1986, that the diversion had the President's approval. 
On November 21, he said, he learned from Poindexter that it did 
not. See North Dep., 7/1/87, at 7, 25. Poindexter testified in private 
session, before North's, that he had specifically decided not to tell 
North that the President had not approved the decision. Poindexter 
thus corroborates North on the essential point, although he did not 
recall the November 21 conversation to which North testified. See 
Poindexter Dep., 5/2/87, at 72; 7/2/87, at 17.

about it. He has also stated that in his opinion, Admi-
ral Poindexter did not have the authority to make the 
decision without the President's approval. 
The Committees have received no documentary 
evidence or testimony which shows that any other 
U.S. Government official approved or in any other 
way was involved in agreeing to the diversion. Col. 
North testified that Director Casey knew about, and 
was supportive of, the diversion, but North did not 
suggest that Casey's approval was either sought or 
required.' 3 
The President Knew Nothing About 
The Diversion 
The evidence available to these Committees shows 
that the President did not know about the diversion. 
The President has made this point repeatedly. The 
Committees have received sworn testimony support-
ing the President on this point from four individuals 
with first-hand knowledge, and from another individ-
ual who directly corroborates some of this key testi-
mony. The plain fact of the matter is that the Com-
mittees have no testimony or documentary evidence 
to the contrary. 
Poindexter 
Adm. John Poindexter stated under oath, in executive 
session and during the public hearings of the Commit-
tees, that he had not told the President about the 
diversion." He did so even though he knew that he 
had thereby deprived himself of an important defense 
against possible criminal prosecution." Poindexter 
also testified that he was certain that the "April 4" 
diversion memorandum, the only surviving memoran-
dum that documents the proposed diversion, did not 
go to the President." The Committees have received 
no testimony or documentary evidence that contra-
dicts Poindexter's testimony on these points.* 
*The striking thing about the majority's deeply flawed effort to 
impeach Poindexter's testimony on the President's knowledge of 
the diversion is that it not only adduces no evidence to contradict 
that testimony, it completely ignores directly relevant corrobora-
tive evidence (provided by Paul Thompson and presented below). 
Lacking hard evidence, the majority baldly speculates that it was 
"totally uncharacteristic" for Poindexter not to have told the Presi-
dent about the diversion and that therefore, the majority implies 
but is apparently afraid to state, Poindexter must have done so and 
lied to the Committees. The majority selectively uses evidence 
concerning Poindexter's background and character. To suggest that 
Poindexter was new in the job, and would therefore not have made 
this decision by himself, the majority states that the "diversion 
decision" was made "only two months" after Poindexter became 
National Security Adviser. The reader is not told of Poindexter's 
directly relevant testimony that he had served first on the NSC 
staff and then as deputy national security adviser for a total of 51/2 
years, and therefore felt confident that he knew how the President 
felt about Contra policy and private and third country fundraising, 
of which Adm. Poindexter considered the diversion an example. 
This, he explained, made him confident he knew what the President 
would approve without being asked. (Poindexter Dep., 5/2/87, at 
552 
Thompson 
The Committees have also received sworn testimony 
which directly corroborates Poindexter's testimony. 
Cmdr. Paul Thompson, formerly the NSC General 
Counsel and assistant to Adm. Poindexter, testified in 
an executive session deposition as follows: 
Q: Were you ever asked by Admiral Poindexter 
to do any legal research relating to the question 
of the use of proceeds of sales of United States 
weapons? 
A: No. 
Q: Have I made that question general enough so 
you would construe it to include any aspect of 
the law related to a diversion such as the one we 
believe actually occurred? 
A: Yes, that's sufficiently broad. I asked the Ad-
miral that same question myself on November 
25th (1986), why he didn't ask me to do legal 
research on that issue. 
Q: What did he say? 
A: He said he didn't want me, to involve me in 
that aspect of the operations. 
Q: Did you have any further discussion on that 
with him? 
A: No. Well, I did. I asked him whether he told 
the President or not. 
Q: What did he say? 
A: No. 
After the questions about researching the law, the 
deposition turned to who authorized the diversion. 
Q: Did you ask him whether or not he had au-
thorized the diversion? 
A: No. I didn't ask him in those concrete terms. I 
asked him, after I asked if he had told the Presi-
dent and he said no, he went on to say the reason 
he didn't tell the President he said he felt confi-
70-71, 75.) The majority also makes a "chain of command" argu-
ment, suggesting that Poindexter would be unlikely to have acted 
outside of that chain. Yet the majority ignores the fact that Poin-
dexter testified under immunity, in private before North appeared, 
that he alone approved the diversion as a command decision and 
that he gave this testimony knowing full well, as he said, that he 
had thereby deprived himself of an important defense against per-
sonal criminal liability. (Poindexter Dep., 5/2/87, at 72-75.) Finally, 
the majority's character argument utterly ignores the fact that Poin-
dexter was clearly the single most secretive witness the Committees 
heard from, a man for whom keeping secrets from long time col-
leagues and associates was a matter of habit. In short, Poindexter 
was just about the most likely witness, from a character point of 
view, to have made a decision to keep the diversion from the 
President.

dent the President would approve it. But it was 
an interesting few moments because he had for 
himself as the naval officer and as the command-
ing officer of the ship, whatever you want to call 
it, he had a standard of what we call inescapable 
responsibility in the Navy which means you are 
inescapably responsible for what any member of 
your, staff does. I was unable to tell whether or 
not he was just generally aware of the diversion 
and North's knowledge of the diversion or 
whether he was more extensively aware of 
it. . . . 
Q: But you apparently were concerned enough 
about it to ask him both why he hadn't told you 
and whether or not he had ever asked you to do 
any legal work that might have borne on the 
subject; am I right? 
A: Well, sure. I was?I saw that as a prime 
reason for his resignation or his request to be 
transferred and one of my missions was to help 
him out in all areas, and I was really just asking 
the question why didn't you ask for my help in 
this area.

course of that week . . . I guess it was the

Lt. Col. Oliver North also testified that he had not 
told the President of the diversion. North testified 
further that he did not have any indication that the 
memorandums he had written to seek approval for 
the diversion had ever been forwarded to the Presi-
dent. (The memorandums were written to Poindexter 
and not to the President.*) North testified that none 
The majority gives an incomplete account of the testimony of 
James Radzimski. All available physical evidence and testimony 
either fails to support or directly contradicts Radzimski's testimony, 
as the majority correctly notes. But the majority ignores the fact 
that Radzimski clarified his account of certain key events in his 
second deposition. Radzimski specifically admitted then that he had 
no independent recollection of any cover memorandum from Poin-
dexter to the President being part of any April diversion memoran-
dum on the Iran initiative, a point the majority appears to have 
forgotten. See Radzimski Dep., 8/11/87 at 71-72. Radzimski also 
admitted that, if any such document had ever existed, three sepa-
rate actions, involving at least two different secure systems to 
which different groups of individuals have access, would all have 
to have been taken to remove all record of its existence. See Id. at 
73-77. Nor could Radzimski explain why he would have seen, as he 
claimed, "non-log" NSC documents such as the diversion memo-
randum which never would have entered the NSC document con-
trol system in the first place. The fact is that Radzimski's testimony 
was not deemed credible by the Committees, and he was therefore 
not called to testify despite a premature announcement that he 
would be so called. 
of the memorandums returned to him on this subject 
had any indication that they had been seen or ap-
proved by the President. North said: 
I did not send them (the memorandums) to the 
President, Mr. Nields. This memorandum [refer-
ring to the April 4 diversion memorandum, ex-
hibit OLN-1] went to the National Security Ad-
viser, seeking that he obtain the President's ap-
proval. There is a big difference. This is not a 
memorandum to the President." 
I want to make it very clear that no memoran-
dum ever came back to me with the President's 
initials on it, or the President's name on it or a 
note from the President on it. None of these 
memorandums [seeking approval of the diversion, 
written to Poindexter]. I do have, as you know, 
in the files that you have of mine, many, many of 
my memorandums do have the President's initials 
on them, but none of these had the President's 
initials on them.' 9 
Col. North admitted at the hearings that he had 
misled Gen. Secord when he told him that the Presi-
dent was aware of the diversion in order to enhance 
the General's enthusiasm for the project.2? North also 
admitted that he had made a comment about the di-
version to Poindexter once as they were leaving a 
meeting with the President, but stated that he be-
lieved the President had not heard the remark.** 
Diversion Memorandums 
Although their accounts of how the diversion was 
authorized were consistent, North and Poindexter had 
different recollections about the extent to which the 
diversion had been documented. North said he be-
lieved he had written five memorandums seeking ap-
proval of diversions, but that he had later destroyed 
them. Poindexter said he did not recall seeing most of 
these memorandums, although he thought it was pos-
sible that he had seen the original of the surviving 
April diversion memorandum and then had destroyed 
the section that dealt with the diversion." However, 
the references to the diversion apparently usually oc-
cupied one or two paragraphs in a multipage docu-
ment. Given the amount of paper normally flowing 
through the National Security Adviser's office, it 
**Id. Through what is a surprising oversight, to put it mildly, the 
majority's account of North's testimony about the President's tele-
phone call to him on November 25, as it relates to the diversion, 
completely omits North's testimony about Earl's statements about 
that telephone call. North testified that he did not recall having 
said to Earl that the President had said "It is important that I not 
know." North continued: "I am sure that what I said (to Earl) was 
basically what I told you yesterday . . . [I] wouldn't have charac-
terized it the way you have just indicated [Earl testified], I don't 
believe." (North 7/8/87, at 93). In short, North's first hand account 
disagreed with Earl's hearsay testimony, and North denied having

would not be surprising if Poindexter had simply for-
gotten or overlooked these references.* 
In any event, the Committees have no evidence to 
suggest that any of these North memorandums, which 
were addressed to Poindexter, ended up going to the 
President. The Committees actually have some docu-
mentary evidence supporting the testimony that they 
did not go to the President. Poindexter's practice on 
some occasions was to brief the President orally with 
respect to what he considered to be the key points of 
lengthy memorandums, such as the one supporting 
the January 17 Finding.22 That is probably what he 
did with the April diversion memo, using the "Terms 
of Reference" portion that did not contain a reference 
to the diversion." 
Regan and Meese 
The case for the view that the President did- not 
know about the diversion does not rest solely on the 
corroborated, sworn testimony of Poindexter and 
North. The Committees also have sworn testimony 
from former Chief of Staff Donald Regan and Attor-
ney General Edwin Meese concerning the President's 
reaction when he was told of the diversion. 
According to Regan's graphic description, the 
President's reaction was: 
Deep distress, deep distress. You know, the ques-
tion has been asked, I've seen it in the paper time 
and time again: did the President know? Let me 
put it this way. This guy I know was an actor, 
and he was nominated at one time for an Acade-
my Award, but I would give him an Academy 
Award if he knew anything about this when you 
watched his reaction to express complete surprise 
at this news on Monday the 24th. He couldn't 
have known it." 
At his deposition, Regan testified as follows: 
Q: And do you recall what the President's reac-
tion was [to learning about the diversion]?" 
A: Horror again, and?thinking back on it, it is 
hard to?it is like a person was punched in the 
The majority makes a strained effort to fabricate a conflict 
between Poindexter and North over whether North was told not to 
create written records of the diversion. To do this, the majority 
must ignore Poindexter's testimony at his private deposition, given 
before North's appearance, that he might have seen the diversion 
memorandum at or about the time it was written. (Poindexter Dep. 
5/2/87, at 178-179; see also Poindexter Test., Hearings, 100-8, 7/16/ 
87, at 111-113). Further, at the hearings, as the majority also fails to 
note, Poindexter stated: "I do recall telling (North) when I took the 
decision the first time that I didn't want anybody else to know 
about it. I don't recall telling him not to put it on paper, but . . . I 
thought (Colonel North) understood from earlier discussions with 
him, to limit the amount of paper that he prepared . . . . (Id. at 
114, emphasis added). Poindexter testified further that North "prob-
ably" prepared the diversion memorandum at his request. (Id. at 
114-115).

stomach. I mean, the air goes out of him, crest-
fallen. You know, a slumping in the chair sort of 
thing. A real blow had been delivered here that 
not only was there this possibility [of a diver-
sion], but that they?people responsible were pri-
marily 011ie North, for whom the President had 
high regard as a staff person, and the Attorney 
General told the President that Admiral Poin-
dexter had some type of inkling of this and 
should have investigated but didn't.25 
Attorney General Meese testified at his deposition: 
Q: And what was the President's response [to 
being told about the diversion]? 
A: Well, he was very much surprised. I would 
say shocked, as was Don Regan. 
Q: Do you recall what he said, the President? 
A: I can't remember exactly, but it was some 
expression of surprise.26 
Meese's testimony at the Committees' public hearings 
on this point was to much the same effect.27 
Conclusion 
From all of this evidence, it is clear the President did 
not know about the diversion. A contrary conclusion 
would have to be based on the view that a series of 
individuals, including the President, decided to 
engage in a criminal conspiracy to cover up the Presi-
dent's knowledge and then to lie about it in a well-
coordinated manner in sworn testimony, much of it 
given under grants of immunity protecting the witness 
from use of the testimony against him for anything 
except a perjury prosecution. The Committees have 
no evidence of any kind that would lend the slightest 
support to this contrary view. 
Who Else In The Government 
Knew About The Diversion? 
Col. North testified that he told Robert McFarlane 
about the diversion at the end of the trip to Tehran in 
May 1986. McFarlane was by then a private citizen, 
and there is no indication he participated in, planned, 
or authorized the diversion. McFarlane has corrobo-
rated North's testimony on this point. In addition, 
North testified, and Robert Earl agreed, that Earl 
knew about the diversion." 
North also testified that Director Casey knew about 
the diversion. Casey denied knowledge of the diver-
sion to Members of Congress shortly before he en-
tered the hospital. In addition, when Director Casey 
learned that there was a possibility that someone had 
diverted funds from the Iran arms sales to the Con-
tras, Col. North assured Director Casey and Deputy

Chapter 10 
Director Robert Gates that the CIA was not involved 
in the diversion. Finally, Casey tried to alert Poin-
dexter to the possible problems that were presented 
by such a diversion and suggested he seek legal coun-
sel to deal with the situation. These can either be seen 
as efforts indicating that Casey did not know about 
the diversion, or as efforts to convey an understand-
ing to Gates and others suggesting that he did not 
know about it in order to conceal the fact that he did. 
Whether or not Casey knew, and we are inclined to 
believe that he did, one thing is clear. Casey's knowl-
edge, or lack thereof, is not in any way indicative of 
what the rest of the CIA may have known about the 
diversion, since it is quite clear that Casey had infor-
mation that he shared with no one else there. The 
Committees have no substantial evidence that other 
CIA personnel did know about the diversion. The 
CIA analysts and operatives who were involved in 
the Iran operation did have reason to know that there 
was a spread between the cost of the weapons pur-
chased from the Government and the price being 
charged the Iranians for them. However, their evi-
dence on this point was equivocal and made it diffi-
cult for them to know how large this spread was in 
some of the transactions. In addition, the fact that 
there were several intermediaries meant that even 
though they knew there was a potential for a "diver-
sion," in the sense that there would be excess funds, 
they did not know where the excess funds were 
going. In this connection, it is important to remember 
that the National Security Council, not the CIA, actu-
ally managed the Iran arms sales operation. There-
fore, the CIA did not have reason to follow the 
details in the way they would have done had they 
had been managing the transaction themselves. We 
have no reason to disbelieve the consistent, unequivo-
cal denials of CIA personnel that they did not become 
aware of any possible diversion of funds to the Con-
tras until very late in the day, and did not know that 
NSC personnel were involved in the diversion of 
funds. 
Finally, the Committees have no evidence to sug-
gest that other U.S. Government officials were aware 
of the diversion. 
Did The Diversion Cause Or 
Interfere With The Iran Initiative? 
The Iranian government clearly paid higher prices for 
U.S. weapons than the United States would have 
charged other governments. From this, some have 
drawn the conclusion that the diversion must inher-
ently have interfered with the Iran initiative, because 
better relations between the two countries could not 
be based on higher than necessary prices for U.S. 
weapons.* In addition, some have suggested that gen-
erating surplus funds for the Nicaraguan Resistance 
was the main motive for moving ahead with the sales. 
The question of motive was considered at length in 
the previous chapter. What we have just shown about 
the diversion only strengthens what was said there. In 
our view, the record supports neither of these posi-
tions. Since there is no evidence that the President or 
any other major U.S. government decisionmaker 
knew about the diversion through the time of the 
January 1986 Finding, it would make no sense to 
argue that their thinking was influenced by this con-
sideration. 
The previous chapter also gives the lie to the idea 
that the diversion, or "overcharging," adversely af-
fected the success of the Iran initiative. If the Second 
Channel representatives were upset at the prices, ne-
gotiations would hardly have proceeded as we have 
described. In fact, Gen. Secord specifically testified 
that he was told by Iran that the price was not an 
important issue for the Second Channel." As we 
have already noted, the price was not much higher 
than the replacement cost. In any case, the Iranians 
were in a war, they needed the weapons, and there 
was no other place to buy them. As Adm. Poindexter 
pointed out, the Iranians had already paid Israel es-
sentially the same premium price the United States 
charged. He therefore did not think they would be 
concerned about the U.S. price.30 North's testimony 
corroborated this point: 
The fact is that we knew that the Iranians would 
pay even more than we charged, from intelli-
gence that we had gathered. We knew that 
during the first channel, for example, Mr. Ghor-
banifar had a little frolic and diversion of his own 
going in which he had pocketed at least some for 
himself, if not for others, a considerable sum. 
And that even the prices we charged, he further 
inflated. 
And so we judged that risk [the risk to the hos-
tages from overcharging] to be minimum given 
that they would be?basically pay whatever they 
could to get these items or weapons from the 
source that?whatever source they could." 
For these reasons, both Poindexter and North re-
jected the idea that the diversion materially affected 
the prospect of achieving a new relationship with the 
Iranian Government.32 The concern the Iranians ex-
pressed about overcharging in connection with the 
Hawk shipment is not necessarily to the contrary. 
*Interestingly, some of the same people who make the argument 
that the diversion hurt the chance for the Iran initiative's success, 
also want to say that the initiative had no chance for success in the 
first place. It is as if they know the policy must be bad for some 
reason, so why not offer some inconsistent reasons to see if any can 
be supported.

Chapter 10 
They were concerned that their own representative, 
Ghorbanifar, was profiting from the overcharging. 
This does not mean that the United States could not 
have continued to charge these same prices, since the 
Iranians had no practical alternative but to pay 
them.3 3 
Some Legal Questions Growing 
Out Of The Diversion 
The technical legal questions surrounding the diver-
sion appear to us to turn on the issue of ownership.* 
If the money was rightfully the property of Gen. 
Secord and Albert Hakim, then it follows that they 
were free to donate the excess proceeds to the Resist-
ance, or use it in any other legal manner that they 
wished. They may have felt a moral obligation to use 
the money as suggested by North, but they would 
have been under no legal obligation to do so. 
If, however, the funds belonged to the United 
States, it follows that the money should have gone 
into the Treasury of the United States and could only 
be sent to the Nicaraguan Resistance under the terms 
of an authorized disbursement. Sending the money to 
the Contras would not technically have been a viola-
tion of the Boland Amendment even under these con-
ditions, because the funds were not appropriated. But 
if the funds were technically the property of the 
United States, then the Executive had no authority to 
direct how it would be spent, except under an appro-
priation or some other legal authorization. 
Substantial legal arguments can be made to support 
and oppose each of the conclusions about who owns 
the Enterprise's funds. In support of the view that the 
funds belonged to the United States, it can be argued 
that Secord was acting as an agent of the United 
States. The facts that the price to Iran for the arms 
was set in consultation with North, that the United 
States selected Iran as the ultimate buyer, that the 
United States anticipated that the sales would trigger 
Iranian help in the release of American hostages held 
in Lebanon, that Secord and Hakim represented them-
Three transactions are at issue. In February 1986, Ghorbanifar 
provided Khashoggi with four postdated checks for $3 million 
each. Khashoggi deposited $10 million in the Lake Resources ac-
count controlled by Hakim and Secord. The CIA then received its 
contract price of $3.7 million for 1,000 TOWs and certified the 
availability of the funds to DOD. The certification and payment of 
the amount to DOD initiated the transfer of the TOWs to the 
custody of Secord, who arranged for their transportation and deliv-
ery to Iran. Thereafter, Iran transferred $7.85 million to the Lake 
Resources account, which was supplemented by $5 million from 
Israel stemming from the abortive HAWK missile shipment in 
November 1985. Khashoggi was repaid $12 million from Lake 
Resources, leaving a profit for the Enterprise of $6.3 million, less 
the cost of transportation of the TOWs. The same general method 
of financing was employed in the transfer of 1,008 TOWs and 
HAWK spare parts in May 1986, August 1986, and October 1986. 
The aggregate surplus to the Enterprise in dispute approximates 
$8.5 million. 
556 
selves as spokesmen for the United States at various 
times, that Secord did not expect to make a profit 
from his services, and that North and Secord both 
expected that any surpluses would be used to further 
U.S. interests, all support the contention that Secord 
was an agent and that the surplus funds were the 
property of the United States." 
On the other hand, there are substantial facts to 
support the conclusion that Secord was purely an 
independent contractor, with his own risks of profit 
and loss. Secord was never designated formally, in 
writing or otherwise, as a U. S. agent. Any argument 
that they were agents has to be based on a theory of 
constructive trust, rather than from some facts that 
will show an explicit, written trust relationship. In 
addition, Secord claims that although North gave him 
suggestions and he listened, he made all the decisions 
and therefore had the control." 
One relevant fact that would support the conclu-
sion that the United States did not have an automatic 
claim to the funds would be the fact that the CIA and 
DOD were paid the full amount the law requires for 
the arms, and refused to transfer the weapons until 
full payment was received. That fact would not settle 
the issue, however, because the price the Defense 
Department set was based on the knowledge that the 
first buyer was another Government agency, the CIA. 
The real question of ownership does not turn on the 
relationship between Defense and CIA, but between 
the CIA or NSC, on the one hand, and the Enter-
prise, on the other. 
It does seem relevant, on Secord's side of this argu-
ment, that the Enterprise assumed all of the major 
financial risks of the operation. For example, if the 
arms were destroyed during the shipment because of 
an air crash or otherwise, there was no agreement 
that the CIA would restore to the Lake Resources 
account the payment previously received. Similarly, if 
Iran was dissatisfied with the arms and refused to 
pay?as occurred with the transfer of Israeli arms in 
November 1985?there was no understanding that the 
CIA would repurchase the arms for the amount previ-
ously paid.3 6 
We have not attempted to resolve this legal ques-
tion of ownership, because it is not within the charter 
or province of the Congressional Investigation Com-
mittees to do so. It is a matter for the courts to 
decide. We do, however, believe that even if Secord 
and Hakim were not agents under the technical terms 
of the law, they nevertheless received the arms sale 
proceeds only because there was an expectation be-
tween themselves and North, based on trust, that they 
would put the money toward mutually agreed-upon 
public ends. Whether legally required to do so or not, 
therefore, they ought to feel some moral obligation to 
turn the surplus over to the United States, after de-
ducting reasonable costs and compensation for serv-
ices.

Chapter 10 
Conclusion 
The diversion has led some of the Committees Mem-
bers to express a great deal of concern in the public 
hearings about the use of private citizens in covert 
operations in settings that mix private profits with 
public benefits. We remain convinced that covert op-
erations will continue to have to use private agents or 
contractors in the future, and that those private par-
ties will continue to operate at least partly from profit 
motives. If the United States tries to limit itself to 
dealing only with people who act out of purely patri-
otic motives, it effectively will rule out any worth-
while dealing with most arms dealers and foreign 
agents. In the real world of international politics, it 
would be foolish to avoid dealing with people whose 
motives do not match those of the United States. 
Nevertheless, we do feel troubled by the fact that 
there was not enough legal clarity, or accounting 
controls, placed on the Enterprise by the NSC. 
Whether viewed with foresight or hindsight, and 
regardless of its legal status, the decision to use part 
of the proceeds of the Iran arms sales for the benefit 
of the Contras was extremely unwise. Even if the 
diversion is determined by the courts to have been 
legally permissible, it was the result of poor judgment 
on the part of U.S. Government officials. The deci-
sion to proceed with the Iran arms sales was itself 
fraught with great potential for controversy and dis-
agreement. There was no sound basis whatsoever for 
adding to the political risks of the operation by bring-
ing into it another hotly debated aspect of American 
foreign policy. 
It was equal folly not to tell the President of the 
planned use of the proceeds of the arms sales. The 
question of legality aside, the President should have 
been given the opportunity to exercise his own good 
judgment to instruct the participants not to allow the 
diversion. 
The diversion decision was not the first time an 
unwise operation has been undertaken in the conduct 
of American foreign affairs, and, unfortunately, it un-
doubtedly will not be the last. At a minimum, the 
decision should generate a fuller awareness in the 
executive branch of the serious negative ramifications 
of risky and short-range decisions that have not had a 
full airing in the Presidential office, let alone in the 
halls of Congress. 
The decision also serves to underscore the tremen-
dous pressures placed on the Chief Executive and his 
staff in carrying out an effective and coherent foreign 
policy in Central America or elsewhere when Con-
gress unnecessarily and unwisely abuses its power of 
the purse to manage foreign affairs with an inconsist-
ent on-again, off-again policy. Congress needs to learn 
that to be an effective participant in the field of for-
eign affairs, it must afford Presidents from either 
party the latitude to plan and implement an effective 
foreign policy based on clear decisions that are free 
from annual change. When Congress learns this, the 
world will be more stable for us and our allies.

Chapter 11 
From the Disclosure to the Uncovering 
On Tuesday, November 4, 1986 the New York Times 
carried a front page story disclosing a portion of the 
Iran initiative.' Only three weeks later, on November 
25, 1986, the Attorney General of the United States 
announced that officials of his department had discov-
ered a diversion of funds from that initiative to the 
use of the Nicaraguan resistance. This chapter de-
scribes our view of the events of November 1986. 
We reach three principal conclusions. First, the 
President's decisions about how much to disclose 
were motivated by his effort to balance the need for 
protection of hostages and secret diplomatic discus-
sions with the public's need for information. Second, 
once the President decided that the Administration 
did not have a complete picture of the Iran initiative, 
the Attorney General undertook an aggressive effort 
to obtain the facts. He then made the information 
available promptly to the President and to the public. 
Third, the President and the Attorney General discov-
ered and disclosed the essential facts, despite efforts 
on the part of certain members of the NSC staff and 
others to cover up certain events, including the diver-
sion. There is no evidence that the President directed, 
encouraged, or in any way condoned this coverup, a 
point the majority spares no effort to gloss over. In 
our opinion, the Attorney General and his associates 
did an impressive job with a complicated subject in a 
very short time. Far from being inept, or parties to a 
cover up, the Department of Justice was responsible 
for uncovering the diversion of Iran arms sale pro-
ceeds to the Contras. 
Early November 
The Iranian initiative was disclosed for political rea-
sons by high level dissident Iranian religious officials. 
The New York Times report was based on a report 
from a Lebanese weekly, Al-Shiraa. Its report was in 
turn based on a politically inspired leak from Iranian 
dissidents bent on retaliation for efforts by the Iranian 
Government to curb their support for wide scale ter-
rorism and possibly to reach an accommodation with 
the United States. At least one of the key dissidents 
has recently been executed by that Government.* 
For more details see asterisk in Chapter 8, at 520. 
American officials had learned of the pending dis-
closure of McFarlane's May trip to Tehran at a secret 
meeting in Europe a week before the disclosure ap-
peared in the press. Their immediate concern was for 
the lives of remaining American hostages. They also 
wanted to continue the secret discussions, as did offi-
cials of the Government of Iran. In addition, there 
were serious questions about the impact of the disclo-
sures on a significant American ally, Israel. 
During the week after the New York Times story, 
there were vigorous disagreements within the Admin-
istration about what, if anything, the Administration 
should disclose about the Iran initiative. As the situa-
tion was later described by former Chief of Staff 
Donald Regan: 
I recall discussing with other members of the 
staff, "The cover is blown here. We have got to 
go public with it. We have got to tell the Con-
gress, we have got to tell the American public 
exactly what went on so they were aware of it." 
Mr. Smilijanich. What did Admiral Poindexter 
recommend? 
Mr. Regan. [His recommendation was] Absolute-
ly not. It was later reported in local papers here 
that we had a shouting match. . . [W]e did have 
a difference of opinion?a strong one. . . . His 
reasoning was a good one, that Jacobsen had just 
come out as a hostage, North was preparing to 
go to London and actually did go to London that 
first weekend in November?what was it, the 8th 
or 9th, in through there [to meet with Iranian 
officials]?and there's a possibility of two more 
prisoners coming out, two of the original ones, 
and maybe even the additional three, the later 
ones. And why blow that chance? We got to 
keep the lid on this, we got to deny it, we're 
endangering their lives. 
And then I might add here, a very dramatic 
thing happened. I recall it vividly. Jacobsen had 
a Rose Garden ceremony welcoming him back. 
He had said in his remarks he had cautioned the 
media about discussing this. On the way back, as 
the President and he were mounting the steps to

the colonnade to go back into the Oval Office, 
there were shouted questions from the media 
about, "What are you going to do about the 
hostages, what about the others that are there?? 
And Jacobsen turned and very emotionally said, 
"For God's sake, don't talk about that, that is 
exactly what I have been saying, you are endan-
gering lives of the people I love, these are my 
friends." That made quite an impression on the 
President. And even though that same day I 
urged him again to get this story out, he said, 
"No, we can't Don,' he said, "We can't endanger 
those lives." And he didn't.2 
Regan's testimony shows the Administration's con-
cern for the hostages. North's notes of a meeting with 
Iranian representatives on November 7, three days 
after the New York Times story, show both the desire 
to continue the negotiations and a concern for the 
hostages: 
?"Holding to no comment-
-We recog.(nize) that public statement, RR admit-
ting mtgs. w/ [2d Channel] wd be dangerous for you 
and Speaker 
?Need to know WTF going on 
? Press release 
? [Second Channel] told in Frankfurt 2 host (two hos-
tages)." 
November 10-20 
Public pressure for an account of the Administration's 
dealings with Iran led during November to meetings, 
a speech and press conference by the President, and 
testimony by various Administration officials before 
Congressional committees. Questions were raised both 
inside and outside the Administration about the Ad-
ministration's compliance with civil statutes governing 
Executive-Legislative branch relations in the conduct 
of covert activities and arms transfers. The President 
and his advisers continued to grapple with the ques-
tion of how to balance the diplomatic concerns just 
described with the need for public disclosure.* 
According to Regan's notes of a November 10 
meeting, the President opened the discussion with a 
statement to the effect that "as a result of media, etc. 
must have a statement coming out of here. . . . Some 
things we can't discuss because of long term consider-
ations of people with whom we have been talking 
about the future of Iran." 3 
At that same meeting, Poindexter made a presenta-
tion on the history of the Iran initiative, that omitted 
*It is interesting to note that while the President and his staff 
were wrestling with the question whether to disclose the mission 
and thereby jeopardize the hostages, the leader of the Government 
of a close ally in that part of the world had a senior aide call North 
to ask the President and Poindexter to flatly deny that there had 
been an operation such as the one reported about McFarlane in 
Tehran. Earl Dep., 5/30/87, p. 74-75. 
562 
or misstated certain facts. Poindexter also noted cor-
rectly the fact that the Iranians wanted to continue 
contacts despite news reports.4 Poindexter noted that 
North had met with Iranian representatives the previ-
ous weekend, that "Iranians happy with our no com-
ment. Raf will have to speak out due to world press 
comments." 5 At a later point, the President noted: 
"We should put out statement. . . but cannot get into 
q & a re hostages so as not to endanger them." 6 
In the period between November 10 and November 
21, the Administration continued to try to balance its 
concern for the hostages and the Iranian initiative 
with the need for public disclosure. The President 
addressed the nation on November 13, and then 
agreed to answer questions concerning this matter on 
November 19. The drafting of the speech, and the 
Presidential press conference preparation on these 
issues, were done by the National Security Council 
staff acting under Admiral Poindexter's direction. 
Some of the information provided during those events 
was incorrect. However, the speech, and the Presi-
dent's answers at the press conference, provided basic 
information concerning the initiative from the Presi-
dent's point of view while attempting to withhold 
certain information in order to protect diplomatic sen-
sitivities such as the role of the Israeli Government.7 
There is evidence that the President and most re-
sponsible Administration officials were trying to keep 
the public record accurate. For example, the White 
House issued an immediate correction with respect to 
one factually incorrect statement the President made 
at the November 19 press conference. Regan testified 
that this inaccurate statement resulted from the Presi-
dent's confusion about what information could be re-
vealed without causing national security problems.8 
By this time, however, Secretary Shultz had conclud-
ed?based on the November 13 speech and November 
19 press conference answers?that the President was 
being misled on some key facts by certain members of 
the NSC staff, and sought a meeting with the Presi-
dent to explain this to him in detail. The meeting 
occurred on November 20. 
During Shultz's meeting with the President, they 
reviewed what Shultz believed were a number of 
inaccurate or misleading statements the President had 
made concerning the Iran initiative.* The State De-
Regan Test., Hearings, 100-10, 7/30, at 23-25. The majority's 
effort to show that the President made inaccurate statements at his 
press conference completely ignores the fact that Israel's involve-
ments in U.S. sales of arms and direct sales of arms were then 
regarded as diplomatic secrets which should be concealed to pro-
tect Israel's security. Several of the President's other arguably inac-
curate statements made then were clearly based directly on infor-
mation given to the President by certain members of the NSC staff. 
4'The majority makes much out of the Secretary's "battle royal" 
with the NSC to get out the true facts. It is worth noting in this 
connection how much of the disagreement at the time rested on 
matters such as differing interpretations of intelligence reports, stra-

partment briefing paper prepared for this occasion 
went through these matters in considerable detail, in-
cluding comments on such matters as the legality of 
various arms transactions, possible political connec-
tions which might be drawn between Iran and Nicara-
gua, and so on.9 The points in Shultz's briefing paper 
were designed to give the President what Shultz be-
lieved to be a more accurate picture of the political 
history and rationale for the Iran arms deal. Shultz 
described the meeting as "a long, tough discussion, 
not the kind of discussion I ever thought I would 
have with a President of the United States. But it was 
bark off all the way." 10 
Testimony and Chronologies 
The need for additional, detailed information on the 
Iran initiative was intensified by the need to testify 
before the Intelligence Committees on November 21. 
It became clear that the Administration had only an 
incomplete "institutional memory" on the origin and 
conduct of that highly compartmented initiative and 
that different participants had conflicting memories of 
certain key 1985 events. 
The events surrounding the creation of false and 
misleading chronologies have been discussed in detail 
during the hearings and there is no need to review the 
matter here. These chronologies misstated the fact of 
the President's authorization for the 1985 arms ship-
ments, the Israeli participation in those shipments, and 
contemporaneous knowledge by United States Gov-
ernment officials of the nature of those shipments. It 
is sufficient to note that the preparation of these mate-
rials was almost exclusively the work of then present 
and former members of the NSC staff, particularly 
North and McFarlane. Their false presentation of 
these events appears to have been acquiesced in, 
either knowingly or unknowingly, by Casey and 
Poindexter. 
The later versions of the chronologies, and the dis-
cussions of draft Congressional testimony, led some 
Justice Department officials to realize that they did 
not know some of the significant facts about the initia-
tive. (The Department had been involved only tan-
gentially in the initiative and in responding to issues 
raised by the public disclosure.) The Department offi-
cials also realized that certain other facts concerning 
the 1985 arms sales were disputed among the partici-
pants. In response to these Justice Department con-
cerns, Casey altered the draft testimony he had pre-
tegic motives and similar matters of judgment. Only with hindsight 
is it clear that concerted efforts to slant the facts, rather than 
honest differences of recollection or judgment, were involved in 
many cases. This is a fact that a dispassionate student of events 
would be well advised to consider. 
pared for November 21 to omit false statements that 
might otherwise have been made.* 
Justice Department Investigation 
On the late evening of November 20, 1986, Justice 
Department officials alerted Attorney General Meese 
about the factual dispute between various participants 
in the Iran initiative on certain key events surround-
ing the 1985 arms sales. They indicated "that a lot of 
people had different recollections and that the situa-
tion was pretty well fouled up because of that." 
There was no suggestion of intentional wrongdoing, 
and Meese did not think that was the situation de-
scribed to him then. The majority report agrees.** 
On the morning of November 21, Meese suggested 
to President Reagan that the President should author-
ize Meese to conduct an investigation to pull together 
an account of all the facts. The reason was to support 
a review of the initiative at a meeting of the National 
Security Planning Group scheduled for Monday, No-
vember 24, 1986. Accordingly, the investigation was 
conducted over the weekend of November 21-24, 
1986.12 
At that time, the Attorney General had no reason 
to believe that any crime had been committed.t The 
simple fact is that the statutes that might possibly 
have been bypassed by the arms sales were not crimi-
nal statutes.if For those who would argue that the 
investigation should have been a criminal one from 
the first, it is worth noting that a Justice Department 
Criminal Division memorandum?prepared independ-
ently and dated November 22, 1986?reviewed these 
*The majority are at some pains to show that North attempted to 
falsify this Casey testimony. North claimed his proposed changes 
were a reaction to CIA drafts, and that he and Casey made changes 
to remove affirmatively untrue statements before the Department of 
Justice intervened. We are uncertain whether to believe North on 
this point or not, but note that exhibits OLN-28, OLN-29, and 
OLN-30 tend to support his version of events. 
**"Cooper did not know who was right or wrong. (Maj. Rept., 
Ch. 19)." The majority states that Meese had been apprised of the 
specifics of this dispute earlier on Nov. 20 by Deputy Attorney 
General Burns after Burns had been informed of the problem by 
State Department Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer. The facts are 
otherwise. Meese and Burns spoke on an unsecured car telephone 
line while Meese was en route to the airport. Burns was very 
general in describing the problem while Meese was equally general 
in assuring him that as a result of the meeting he had just left 
problems had been resolved. (Meese Dep., 7/8/87 at 174-175) 
Meese was not given specific information showing the inaccuracy 
of the proposed testimony at that point. In any event, within a few 
hours, Justice Department officials who stayed involved in the 
process discovered the conflict and informed Meese, who decided 
that the Casey testimony should be altered. See Meese Test., Hear-
ings, 100-9, 7/28/87, at 266-267. 
f The Attorney General has extensive criminal investigation and 
prosecution experience. See Meese Test, Hearings, 100-9, 7/28/87, 
at 263. 
11 Indeed, the Attorney General discussed the matter with FBI 
Director Webster on Friday afternoon and both agreed it would be 
premature to involve the FBI in an investigation at that point.

statutes and reported no basis for criminal prosecution 
based on information then available.*** 
The Attorney General's brief investigation received 
exhaustive scrutiny during the course of the hearings, 
both during his own testimony and that of Assistant 
Attorney General Charles Cooper. That investigation 
has been criticized on a number of points. We think 
the criticisms are without merit. The Attorney Gener-
al assembled a team of competent attorneys, two of 
whom in addition to him had been confirmed for their 
jobs by the United States Senate, and all of whom 
had directly relevant responsibilities within the De-
partment of Justice for national security matters, to 
conduct the fact finding inquiry." 
On November 21, the Attorney General personally 
requested that the National Security Council make 
available to his staff all relevant documents concern-
ing the Iran initiative." The investigating team pro-
ceeded to interview all material witnesses with re-
spect to the 1985 arms sales." Witnesses were repeat-
edly instructed by then that the President's interests 
would be best served if the Attorney General were 
given a full and accurate account of what hap-
pened." Yet McFarlane, North and Poindexter made 
false, misleading, or inaccurate statements to, and con-
cealed directly relevant information from, the Attor-
ney General and his representatives. Despite this, the 
Attorney General's investigation uncovered "the es-
sential facts that are still the essential facts today." 17 
Although the Committee majority makes much of its 
purported discovery of "the Enterprise," that network 
of shell corporations and secret bank accounts really 
represents the mechanics of the diversion the Attor-
ney General discovered, and little else. 
In the course of the review of documents on No-
vember 22, Justice Department officials discovered a 
memorandum that showed a plan that part of the 
Iranian arms sales proceeds were to be used to sup-
port the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance, but pro-
vided no evidence that the plan had been carried out. 
***Meese Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/28/87, at 200. The majority 
makes a halfhearted effort to imply that the FBI or the Criminal 
Division of the Department of Justice should have been called in 
earlier than they were, possibly even as early as November 21. The 
majority's reasoning ignores the following points. The "facts" on 
which the majority relies, such as the Casey testimony and possible 
Arms Export Control Act violations were not criminal in nature, at 
least so far as could reasonably be determined at the time. Even 
more importantly, the majority utterly ignores the fact that the 
Attorney General specifically testified that he had consulted former 
FBI Director Webster and the FBI top leadership after the disclo-
sures occurred and had been assured that their view was that 
Meese had acted properly; Webster also took this position at his 
confirmation hearings. See Meese Test., 7/28/87, pp. 281-282, 291-
292). Finally, the majority ignores the fact that the head of the 
Criminal Division, also a political appointee, testified that his con-
cerns about Criminal Division involvement, which were not ex-
pressed to the Attorney General at the time, were based on existing 
Criminal Division court actions unrelated to the Iran initiative and 
to management issues, not matters of propriety or judgments about 
evidence of criminal conduct. See Weld Dep., 7/16/87 at 13-20. 
564 
They immediately arranged to interview North the 
next day, Sunday, and waited until the end of that 
interview to confront North with the memorandum. 
Meese specifically testified to North's surprise on 
being shown the memorandum. After North had con-
firmed that a diversion of funds had in fact occurred, 
the Attorney General and his associates undertook to 
determine who knew about, and who might have 
authorized, such a diversion.* 
We think that the suggestion that the Attorney 
General's investigative procedures changed in some 
irregular manner after the discovery of a possible 
diversion is particularly unfair. We encourage any 
reader who is interested in this issue to review the 
colloquy on this subject between the Attorney Gener-
al and Senator Mitchell in which Senator Mitchell 
raised this issue and then dropped it after the Attor-
ney General directly challenged him for doubting 
Meese's testimony about 
*The allegation has also been made that Department officials 
disregarded other "evidence" which came to their attention con-
cerning the possibility of such a diversion, such as the use of 
Southern Air Transport in both the Iran and Contra operations. 
The question is moot because the Justice Department in fact quick-
ly discovered the first hard circumstantial evidence that members 
of the NSC staff had been involved in a diversion, the diversion 
memorandum itself. However, a close examination of this alleged 
"evidence" shows that it was speculation communicated in a vague, 
general way which related to a physical or political connection 
rather than to evidence of financial diversion. See Sofaer Dep., 6/ 
18/87 at 68-70; Meese Test, Hearings, 100-9, 7/28/87, at 270-71, 
277; 7/29/87, at 414-415. Although there was some speculation by 
officials at the Department of State and the Central Intelligence 
Agency (based on price differentials) about some type of a diver-
sion, there was no evidence to suggest that the funds had gone to 
Nicaragua, or that the disposition of any surplus was being directed 
by certain members of the NSC staff. The majority attempts to 
bootstrap the fact that some of this vague information may have 
been conveyed to the Attorney General into an attack on the 
truthfulness of the Attorney General's account of his meeting with 
Director Casey on November 22. The members of the majority are 
much bolder in a report which the Attorney General never saw 
before it went into print than they were when he testified and 
therefore could respond to similar cheap shots. Suffice it to say that 
the Attorney General has consistently and credibly recounted 
events at this meeting where appropriate in his testimony in various 
forums, including our public hearings. See Meese Tower Board 
Test, 1/20/87, at 32-33; Meese Dep., 7/8/87 at 121-123; Meese 
Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/28/87, at 113-115) He testified he made a 
deliberate decision to protect his investigation by not asking Casey 
for information before confronting North; in our view, this was a 
correct and successful decision. See Meese Test., Hearings, 100-9, 
7/28/87, p. 278. 
**Meese Test., Hearings, 100-9, 7/29/87, p. 331-334. The majority 
ignores the fact that virtually all of the interviews involved lasted 
only a few minutes, took place hurriedly between other meetings, 
and involved only a couple of basic questions: who knew of the 
diversion and who authorized it. (See Meese Test., 7/28/87, p. 280) 
The majority also ignores the fact that Meese's accounts of these 
meetings have been corroborated in substance by the living partici-
pants who have been questioned by the Committees. The majority's 
sporadic efforts to suggest conflicts are strained, to put it mildly. A 
classic example of the majority's reaching is their statement "Meese 
met alone with Regan and the President."

Chapter 11 
The Attorney General's November 25 press confer-
ence report was based principally on admissions made 
to him on November 23 by North. At the press con-
ference, the Attorney General repeatedly made clear 
that there were a large number of matters on which 
his information was uncertain and subject to addition-
al review and correction." At that time, Justice De-
partment officials were not aware of any document 
shredding or altering by North and others. As McFar-
lane testified, although he did not participate in the 
shredding he did not inform Meese that North had 
told him it might occur." Similarly, Justice Depart-
ment officials had no immediate way to determine 
that several of these officials gave them misleading or 
inaccurate answers to their questions. The majority's 
pointless cavilling about this press conference is very 
much indicative of the quality of their work in this 
area. As noted, despite this attempt at a coverup by 
certain NSC officials, the Attorney General's investi-
gation turned up the facts that are still the essential 
ones today. 
There is no evidence that the President directed, 
encouraged, or otherwise in any way condoned a 
coverup. We reject as completely unsupported by the 
record any suggestion that the Attorney General or 
his staff ignored signs of potential criminal behavior 
or consciously sought not to obtain information in an 
effort to assist or protect the President. After intense 
scrutiny, by two Congressional committees with a 
very large staff, it is clear that the Attorney General 
and his staff conducted themselves honorably and dis-
closed to the President and the public their findings 
without regard to any political damage which would 
ensue.* 
On December 4, 1986, at the request of the Attorney General, a 
motion was filed with the Special Division of the Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking the appointment of an 
Independent Counsel.

NSC Involvement in Investigations 
Introduction 
The majority chapter entitled "NSC Involvement 
in Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions" raises 
questions about the connection between the work of 
the National Security Council and traditional law en-
forcement activities. Unfortunately, the majority com-
bines carelessly assembled information about matters 
which any fair-minded person would conclude raise 
no important issues, with scattered and conclusory 
judgments about matters where real questions of judg-
ment exist. 
Because of the necessity for accurate and, timely 
information about threats to persons or property 
posed by those who may wish to cause harm for 
reasons connected to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national security community must some-
times be involved in pending criminal investigations 
undertaken by domestic law enforcement agencies. 
The real question is not whether but when and how 
much involvement is appropriate. To answer this 
question requires a close examination of the reasons 
for such involvement and the manner in which such 
involvement is responded to by law enforcement offi-
cials. 
The record of the various investigations discussed 
by the majority shows that law enforcement agencies 
outside the NSC, from the Department of Justice, to 
the FBI and Customs Service, responded in an appro-
priate manner to requests for investigations prompted 
by such reasons. In addition, the record of several of 
the investigations in which NSC personnel became 
involved reveals that NSC involvement in these ac-
tivities, at least at their preliminary stages, was appro-
priate. However, their involvement in others was 
questionable at best. 
The circumstances of each case will determine 
whether such involvement was appropriate. We en-
courage each reader to examine the facts of each 
investigation carefully to make this determination. In 
order to set the record straight, we provide a brief 
review of the investigations related to the Iran-Contra 
affair in which the NSC staff was involved. 
Basically, the majority alleges that certain Adminis-
tration officials, particularly Colonel North, became 
improperly involved in a number of investigations 
relating to Contra activities. However, the majority's 
highly critical analysis is based on a flawed methodol-
ogy. In view of the majority's intent to show that 
Col. North acted improperly, it is noteworthy that the 
majority in most cases declined to ask Col. North 
himself, during six days of public testimony, about 
these allegations against him. During the Committees' 
investigation, the majority obtained information on 
these matters from witnesses who were in contact 
with North, but North was never asked to give his 
side of these events. The majority uses selected entries 
from North's written notes of conversations and meet-
ings, but even though these entries are often abbrevi-
ated and cryptic, the majority declined to ask North 
to explain them. Instead, the majority attempted to 
interpret what these notes "suggest." In light of this 
flawed methodology, the majority's conclusions re-
garding purported interference with various investiga-
tions cannot be considered objective. Moreover, the 
following brief discussions of several of these investi-
gations demonstrate some additional problems. 
Miami Neutrality Act Investigation 
The majority has analyzed a charge that a Miami 
investigation of an alleged conspiracy by a pro-Contra 
group to violate the Neutrality Act was impeded by 
officials of the Department of Justice. The majority 
has concluded that the investigation was not aggres-
sively pursued. However, a review of the facts clearly 
shows that the charge of interference was based on 
one witness's testimony, which was contradicted by 
all of the other witnesses. Further, any delays in the 
investigation were caused by legitimate problems. 
David Leiwant, an Assistant U.S. Attorney in 
Miami, has claimed that he overheard one side of a 
telephone conversation on April 4, 1986, between 
U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner in Miami and someone at 
the Department of Justice, in which Kellner was ad-
vised that the Department wanted him to go slow on 
a pending investigation of possible Neutrality Act vio-
lations. According to Leiwant, after the phone con-
versation ended, U.S. Attorney Kellner stated that the 
Justice Department wanted the investigation to go 
slow and to be kept quiet. Kellner reputedly made 
these statements with a sneer, suggesting that he 
would ignore these requests.'

Chapter 12 
Leiwant's account of this incident is unsupported 
by any other evidence. In fact, every other person 
who was present at the meeting when the telephone 
conversation allegedly took place denies Leiwant's 
version of events. In addition to Leiwant, five people 
were present at this meeting in U.S. Attorney 
Kellner's office on April 4, 1986?Kellner, Chief As-
sistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie, Executive 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ana Barnett, Special Counsel 
Lawrence Scharf, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey 
Feldman, who was handling the investigation. All 
have denied Leiwant's claim that Kellner received a 
telephone call from the Justice Department instruct-
ing Kellner to go slow.2 
Leiwant has speculated that the alleged Justice De-
partment call may have come from D. Lowell Jensen, 
Stephen S. Trott, or Mark M. Richard,3 but each of 
these three officials denies any such conversation and 
further denies knowledge of any attempt to impede 
this investigation.4 
Leiwant himself concedes: "I was listening to it 
[the alleged telephone conversation] with half an 
ear. . . ." 5 Also, he is certain that he never heard 
Kellner tell Feldman to go slow.6 
It is noteworthy that Leiwant failed to discuss with 
his superiors this disturbing telephone conversation 
which he purportedly overheard.7 Instead, Leiwant 
began to discuss this matter with outsiders, even 
though he had neither requested nor received the 
required departmental approval to disclose anything 
about this ongoing investigation.8 Within days of the 
April 4, 1986, meeting, Leiwant called two Washing-
ton Post reporters in Washington, D.C. According to 
his testimony, he mentioned to both of them that he 
might have information about the Contras and Nicara-
gua. Since they were not very interested, he purport-
edly did not say much.3 
Then, in August 1986, Leiwant leaked his allegation 
to John Mattes, a defense attorney who represented 
Jesus Garcia, the informant who provided early infor-
mation about the alleged Neutrality Act violations. 
Mattes' client was awaiting sentencing on a federal 
conviction, and he could have benefited if his infor-
mation led to new indictments." Then, Leiwant told 
two investigators from the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. Later, Leiwant told his story to U.S. Sen-
ator John Kerry." The publicity generated by 
Leiwant's actions led to these Committees' inquiry. 
Leiwant has alleged the Neutrality Act investiga-
tion was proceeding too slowly." Similarly, the ma-
jority has claimed that the investigation was not ag-
gressively pursued. These allegations ignore several 
important factors. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Feldman, who was as-
signed to handle the investigation, was relatively inex-
perienced. Moreover, the information his investigation 
was eliciting was disorganized and, in some respects, 
unreliable. Feldman himself described the case as a 
"confused mess." 13 For instance, a polygraph of 
568 
Jesus Garcia, the convicted felon who provided early 
information about the reported conspiracy, was incon-
clusive and showed deception on an important issue. 
Garcia later admitted he had lied about that issue." 
One of the two FBI agents assigned to the investiga-
tion testified that Garcia provided inaccurate informa-
tion," and the other agent testified that Garcia did 
not have a great deal of credibility." 
Another example of evidentiary problems was the 
information provided by witness Jack Terrell. Most of 
Terrell's information was found to be based on hear-
say rather than his direct observation." Feldman's 
superiors felt that the investigation needed additional 
work, and that the case was not sufficiently devel-
oped to be presented to a grand jury." 
Furthermore, the delay in the progress of the inves-
tigation was affected by the press of other investiga-
tions.19 
In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Miami U.S. 
Attorney's Office is recognized as one of the busiest 
in the nation, with limited resources to apply against 
an ever-increasing criminal caseload. 
Southern Air Transport investigation 
The majority also raises questions, in another chap-
ter of their report, about the handling of an FBI/ 
Customs investigation of Southern Air Transport. The 
FBI, at least, began an investigation of Southern Air 
Transport for possible violations of the Neutrality Act 
after the shootdown of the Hasenfus aircraft. Howev-
er, Southern Air Transport also provided the air 
transportation services for most of the Iran initiative. 
This initiative continued after the Hasenfus shoot-
down and in fact produced one hostage in early No-
vember 1986, after a shipment of arms involving 
Southern Air Transport. 
Whatever the reader concludes about the propriety 
of the actions of the NSC staff in requesting a delay, 
the record is clear that the Department of Justice and 
FBI officials who granted it acted entirely properly. 
They were told that the delay was required for the 
purpose of protecting the Iran initiative. They 
checked to determine whether the ongoing investiga-
tion would be impeded, and were told it would not 
be. They granted a delay conditioned on the conclu-
sion that the ongoing investigation would not be af-
fected, and asked that it be resumed promptly, as it 
was." The Attorney General specifically testified 
that when he was asked to grant a delay, he was not 
told of any connection between White House officials 
and Southern Air Transport's work in the Contra 
resupply operation, or of Southern Air Transport's 
involvement in this operation.21 
instigation of investigations 
The majority claims: "North attempted to exploit 
his contacts with the FBI to attempt to instigate or

Chapter 12 
intensify investigations of people and organizations 
perceived as threats to the Enterprise. He was ulti-
mately assisted in this effort by Richard Secord and 
Glenn Robinette." 22 
These statements by the majority are false, as we 
shall show below. The first instance cited by the 
majority appears to have been based on a good faith 
but mistaken belief about FBI jurisdiction. The other 
two instances cited by the majority, where the FBI 
became involved in a matter in which North had an 
interest, were based on either legitimate human con-
cerns or a legitimate desire to protect the life of the 
President of the United States. In the latter instance, 
it is abundantly clear that North did not "instigate or 
intensify" any investigation at all. 
In the first instance cited by the majority, North 
appears to have suggested, in conversation, an FBI 
investigation of certain individuals based on a suspi-
cion that a foreign government was secretly financing 
or supporting a lawsuit against various United States 
citizens, a matter about which it would have been 
legitimate for North to inquire for national security 
reasons and, which if true, might have constituted a 
fraud on the courts of the United States. North, a 
nonlawyer, was flatly told that the FBI did not have 
the legal authority to investigate such a matter, and 
did not pursue the request. 
The second instance discussed by the majority is 
based on North's request for an investigation of van-
dalism and harassment directed against him. The FBI 
investigation occurred in May and June, 1986. North 
requested the investigation because of incidents of 
vandalism that had been directed against him at work 
and at home which he believed might be related to 
the actions of foreign intelligence sources. There is no 
doubt that the incidents of harassment in fact oc-
curred, and the FBI appears to have concluded that 
they might have been associated with the dates of 
". . . Congressional votes on Contra aide 
(sic) . . ." 23 They, together with threats against 
North's life which occurred at about this time, were 
sufficient to motivate North to have a sophisticated 
security system installed around his home at precisely 
this time.24 
While North may have been completely wrong 
about the source or nature of the vandalism which 
was being directed against him, we do not find any-
thing in the record to suggest that North's conduct 
was based on anything other than a good faith belief 
that this harassment might have been based on such 
actions. Given North's position in government, and 
the nature of his official duties, this possibility could 
not be completely discounted. We therefore see noth-
ing improper in North's having asked the FBI to 
investigate even though some of the persons who 
were to have been interviewed for information might 
have been connected to or involved in political oppo-
sition to North's Contra activities, since such persons 
were logical sources of information necessary to a 
proper investigation. The FBI, in turn, appears to 
have acted to determine whether there was any possi-
bility that North's concerns might have a reasonable 
basis and then to have dropped the matter. 
But it is the third instance cited by the majority 
which we find particularly egregious. This instance 
concerns an FBI investigation of Jack Terrell based 
on the possibility that Terrell had threatened the life 
of the President. The majority snidely suggests that 
North was responsible for using the FBI to investi-
gate Terrell. They say: "North ultimately hit on a 
better formula [for having such investigations con-
ducted], with Secord's assistance." 25 The facts clear-
ly show just the opposite, and the majority has so 
clearly disregarded the facts we are forced to ques-
tion its motives. 
Significantly, it was the FBI which first independ-
ently obtained information about a possible threat 
against President Reagan. This information came from 
a classified source in mid-1986.26 The FBI concluded 
that the threat "probably" came from Jack Terrell, a 
mercenary who had been associated first with Contra 
forces, and then with pro-Sandinista forces.27 The 
FBI therefore sent a request to various federal law 
enforcement and national security agencies, including 
the NSC, specifically asking them for information 
concerning Terrell, according to testimony by FBI 
Executive Assistant to the Director Oliver B. 
("Buck") Revell." The majority completely omits to 
mention that the FBI asked the NSC for information 
concerning Terrell. By coincidence, North was aware 
that Terrell was assisting the plaintiffs in a lawsuit 
against Secord and others and that Glen Robinette 
was involved as an investigator for Secord in that 
lawsuit. However, North and Robinette had never 
previously discussed Terrell, according to Robin-
ette." North called Robinette and asked if he had 
any information about Terrell. Robinette said yes, and 
North asked him to provide it to the FBI. North did 
not ask Robinette to limit his cooperation with the 
FBI, or to withhold any information from them, ac-
cording to Robinette.3? Robinette thereafter met with 
the FBI and assisted them in establishing surveillance 
of Terrell.* In any event, the FBI shortly thereafter 
discontinued contact with Robinette and surveilled 
Terrell until it concluded that he was not a threat to 
the President.** 
*Robinette specifically denied that he was asked to wear a 
"wire" for surveillance purposes; as a former electronic surveillance 
specialist, he was certain he would have remembered such a re-
quest. (Robinette Dep., 11/5/87, at 34-36.) 
**Revell Dep., 7/15/87 at 32, 36. When interviewed by the FBI 
in connection with the Terrell matter, North disclosed Robinette's 
activities for Secord in connection with the Florida civil lawsuit 
brought by Honey and Avirgan in which Secord was a defendant. 
(7/25/86 FBI Report of 7/22/86 interview of North, at 2.) North 
acknowledged his involvement in U.S. Nicaraguan policy, but 
denied Secord "works for him." In short, North appears to have

Chapter 12 
In all of this, we are unable to discern anything that 
resembles a politically motivated effort on North's 
part to harass Terrell. The FBI's information concern-
ing the threat was real, obtained independently of 
North, and pursued with national security agencies in 
the normal manner. The fact that North knew of 
Terrell by reputation is nothing but coincidence, and 
we think it is extraordinarily unfair to imply that 
Colonel North or General Secord acted in this in-
stance in any manner inconsistent with their obliga-
tions as citizens or employees of the United States. 
We think it is unfortunate that the majority is so bent 
on pressing the thesis of this chapter that they have 
included misleading information about this incident in 
an effort to try to reinforce it. Clearly, the majority 
would not want to suggest that anyone who had 
potentially useful information about a threat to the life 
of the President should withhold it for fear of later 
being accused of political harassment. 
The "Reward a Friend" Investigation 
The majority has alleged that North and other gov-
ernment officials tried to influence the sentencing of a 
former official in a Central American country, who 
had pleaded guilty to two felony counts in the United 
States. The official had allegedly provided assistance 
as a "friend of the U.S." in Central America. Yet, the 
only purported result of government support of the 
official was his reassignment to a minimum security 
prison." Such reassignments are commonly requested 
and granted. 
truthfully disclosed the associations and bias of Robinette, the infor-
mation source North provided here. North's other reported state-
ments, which the Committee did not ask him about during the 
hearings, appear to relate to the Neutrality Act issues and were not 
relevant to the FBI's investigation of Terrell. Id. North denied 
responsibility for "funding, arming, or administrating Contra pro-
grams." Id. at 3. North stated that he was not involved with any 
covert operations being run in the United States./d. 
570 
This official had previously received official recog-
nition for his services to the U.S. in the region. The 
majority notes that North was concerned that if the 
official was dissatisfied with his sentencing in 1986, he 
would "break his longstanding silence about the 
Nic[araguan] Resistance and other sensitive oper-
ations." 32 The majority further notes that North 
wanted "to keep the official from feeling like he was 
lied to in the legal process and start spilling the 
beans." 33 The majority is unable to concede that the 
official, assistance to the U.S. may have involved le-
gitimate intelligence operations. Instead, the majority 
boldly asserts that the NSC staffs "ultimate motive 
appears to have been a desire to prevent disclosure of 
certain questionable activities." Significantly, the ma-
jority never asked North to address the issue of the 
official's assistance to the U.S. Accordingly, the ma-
jority's suggestion of a cover-up of "questionable ac-
tivities" should be recognized as pure speculation. 
The Fake Prince 
The majority's main allegation regarding the "fake 
prince" is that in 1985 Col. North interfered with the 
FBI's bank fraud investigation of this "Saudi prince," 
because North was attempting to develop this individ-
ual as an asset in the Iran initiative and in Contra 
activities. (The "prince" was ultimately discovered to 
be an Iranian imposter.) North allegedly interfered 
because during an FBI interview he requested that an 
upcoming FBI interview of the "prince" be delayed 
for several days, so as not to interfere with the 
"prince's" intended donation to the Contras. Howev-
er, the FBI report notes: "In no way does North want 
to interfere with a criminal prosecution of the prince 
And the majority concedes that North subse-
quently "backed down" on this request. Moreover, 
this alleged "interference" had no effect on the pros-
ecution of the "prince" for bank fraud. Following a 
plea of guilty, the "prince" was imprisoned."

Chapter 13 
The Need To Patch Leaks 
Throughout the majority report, much is made of the 
Administration's concern for secrecy. That concern is 
portrayed almost exclusively, if not exclusively, as the 
desire of some lawbreakers to cover the tracks of 
their misdeeds. We agree that the National Security 
Council staff, under Admiral Poindexter, let its con-
cern over secrecy go too far. We should not be so 
deceived by self-righteousness, however, that we dis-
miss the Admiral's concern as if it had no serious 
basis. Our national security, like it or not, does 
depend on many occasions on our ability to protect 
secrets. It is easy to dismiss the specific Iran arms 
sales decisions about executive branch compartmenta-
lization, and about withholding information from 
Congress for almost a year, as having been excessive. 
Everyone on these Committees would agree with that 
conclusion. But unless we can understand the real 
problems that led the NSC staff to its decision, future 
Administrations will once again be faced with an un-
palatable choice between excessive secrecy, risking 
disclosure or foregoing what might be a worthwhile 
operation. 
Time after time over the past several years, ex-
tremely sensitive classified information has been re-
vealed in the media. Predictably, both Congress and 
the Administration have blamed each other. In fact, 
both are culpable. It is important for these Commit-
tees to recognize this truth forthrightly. As Secretary 
Shultz said, quoting Bryce Harlow, "trust is the coin 
of the realm." 1 But trust has to be mutual. Some 
people on these Committees seem to want to bring 
criminal prosecutions against former Administration 
officials for not speaking candidly to Congress. It is 
true that the business of government requires the Ad-
ministration to be considered trustworthy by Con-
gress. But so too must Congress prove itself trustwor-
thy to the Administration. 
We do not mean, by our focus on congressional 
leaks, to suggest that we turn our eyes from the same 
problem in the executive branch. Executive branch 
leaks are every bit as serious as legislative branch 
ones. But as long as there is a consensus on this point, 
we do not feel a need to dwell on it here. At the end 
of this chapter, we will recommend legislation to help 
address the issue of executive branch leaks along with 
our suggestions for the legislative branch. 
There is much less consensus in Congress, however, 
about leaks from the legislative branch. Those prob-
lems are real. As Representative Hyde wrote in a 
recent article, the fact that the executive branch leaks 
more, does little to get Congress off the hook. 
Proven Congressional transgressions admittedly 
are relatively rare, but so are proven executive-
branch leaks. In truth, only a handful of leaks 
ever have been definitively traced to their source, 
so lack of proof establishes nothing. A partial 
Senate Intelligence Committee study often 
quoted by Mr. Beilenson reportedly found that 
journalists referenced congressional sources only 
8-9 percent of the time, but cited Reagan Admin-
istration officials 66 percent of the time. Report-
ers may not be entirely candid about their 
sources. But generously assuming that Congress 
has 2,500 people with clearances as opposed to 
2.2 million in the executive branch and the mili-
tary, reliance on the Senate study forces us to 
conclude that Congress maintains just over 0.1 
percent the number of executive branch clear-
ances, but is responsible for 8-9 percent of the 
leaks on national security issues. Specifically, on 
average, a cleared person in Congress is 60 times 
more likely than his counterparts to engage in 
unauthorized disclosures.2 
We believe that these problems?rather than a desire 
to cover up a supposed lawlessness whose existence 
we do not concede?contributed significantly to the 
Administration's posture in 1985-86. 
Protecting Secrecy in the Early 
Congress 
To put the issue in perspective, it is worthwhile to 
consider how the country's Founders dealt with the 
problem. Those hardheaded realists understood that 
breaches of security during that perilous revolution-
ary period could mean the difference between life and 
death. Consequently, only five members of the 
Second Continental Congress sat on the Committee of 
Secret Correspondence, the foreign intelligence direc-

Chapter 13 
torate that was mentioned in our earlier historical 
chapter. 
The Continental Congress was especially careful 
about protecting sources and methods. For example, 
the names of those employed by the Secret Corre-
spondence Committee were kept secret, as were the 
names of those with whom it corresponded. Even 
then, there was concern about Congress keeping a 
secret. As a result, when the Committee learned that 
France would covertly supply arms, munitions and 
money to the revolution, Ben Franklin and another 
Committee member, Robert Morris, stated: "We agree 
in opinion that it is our indispensable duty to keep it a 
secret, even from Congress. . . . We find, by fatal 
experience, the Congress consists of too many mem-
bers to keep secrets." 
To underscore the importance of protecting sensi-
tive information, the Continental Congress on No-
vember 9, 1775, adopted the following oath of secre-
cy which should still be in effect today: 
Resolved That every member of this Congress 
considers himself under the ties of virtue, honour 
and love of his country, not to divulge, directly 
or indirectly, any matter or thing agitated or 
debated in Congress before the same shall have 
been determined, without the leave of the Con-
gress, nor any matter or thing determined in 
Congress, which a majority of the Congress shall 
order to be kept secret. And that if any member 
shall violate this agreement, he shall be expelled 
this Congress, and deemed an enemy to the liber-
ties of America, and liable to be treated as such, 
and that every member signify his consent to this 
agreement by signing the same.3 
This oath was not taken lightly and no less a revo-
lutionary figure than Thomas Paine, the author of 
"Common Sense," was fired as an employee of the 
Continental Congress for disclosing information re-
garding France's covert assistance to the American 
Revolution. Interestingly, Congress then resorted to 
its own covert action and passed a blatantly false 
resolution repudiating Paine's disclosure.4 Obviously, 
the Founding Fathers realized that there are some 
circumstances when a well-intentioned "noble lie," as 
Plato put it, is a necessary alternative to the harsh 
consequences of the truth. They also believed in pun-
ishing leakers, a practice their modern counterparts in 
both the executive and legislative branches need to 
emulate more consistently. 
Let us move forward in history now, to the early 
years of the Constitution. President Washington 
learned quickly that once information is shared with 
Congress, it is up to Congress?often the opposition

tion, see supra, ch. 3, p. 470. 
576 
party in Congress?to decide when or how it will be 
made public. 
During the time the Federalists controlled the 
House, they enforced a rule that excluded the 
public during any debate concerning material 
sent to the House by the President "in confi-
dence." After the Republicans gained control, 
they changed this rule to allow the majority to 
vote for public debate on confidential communi-
cations on an ad hoc basis. Soon thereafter, the 
House voted to lift an injunction of secrecy they 
had placed on some letters sent by the President 
"in confidence." A similar rebellion of sorts took 
place in the Senate after the Jay Treaty was 
conditionally ratified. The President wanted the 
treaty kept secret until all negotiations were com-
plete. The Senate voted, however, to rescind its 
injunction of secrecy, although it continued to 
enjoin "Senators not to authorize or allow any 
copy [to be made] of the said communication 
. . . ." Both Senators Pierce Butler of South 
Carolina and Stevens T. Mason of Virginia smug-
gled copies out of the Senate chamber, apparent-
ly before the secrecy injunction was lifted, and 
on the same day that the Government planned to 
make the treaty public, the Republican Aurora 
beat it to the punch by printing an abstract of the 
terms.3 
The Leaky 1970s 
Some things never change and as we celebrate our 
constitution's bicentennial, Congress is still prone to 
unauthorized and sometimes damaging disclosures. 
The worst period in recent history was during the 
1970s, when the legitimacy of the CIA and covert 
operations were under attack. What follows are some 
examples of alleged congressional leaks during that 
period. Rather than rely on classified material, we 
have chosen here to protect still secret information by 
relying on accounts from secondary sources. The in-
clusion of this material is not meant to confirm or 
deny the veracity of the specific disclosures alleged. 
We begin with a 1972 example from Arthur Maass' 
book, Congress and the Common Good. 
On April 25, 1972, Senator Mike Gravel (D. AK) 
asked unanimous consent to insert in the Congres-
sional Record excerpts from a top-secret National 
Security memorandum. The 500-page document 
concerning policy options in the Vietnam War 
had been prepared for Richard Nixon in 1969 by 
the National Security Council staff under Henry 
A. Kissinger. The senator's normally routine re-
quest was blocked temporarily by minority whip 
Robert P. Griffin (R. MI). The Senate met on 
May 2 and 4 in closed executive sessions to con-
sider Gravel's request, but no decision was

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Chapter 13 
reached. Then on May 9, Gravel, without ad-
vance notice, read into the Record, during debate 
on the annual State Department authorization 
bill, excerpts from the memorandum dealing with 
proposals to mine North Vietnamese ports, an 
action that had been announced by the President 
on the previous day. Senator Griffin, who en-
tered the chamber during Gravel's statement, 
criticized him for acting before the Senate had 
disposed of the question. The Senator responded: 
"I have an obligation to the American people 
. . . to let the American people have the infor-
mation that he [Richard Nixon] has." 
Congressman Ron V. Dellums (D.CA) then ob-
tained from Gravel a copy of the full document 
which he placed in the Congressional Record on 
May 11, by simply asking unanimous consent to 
extend his remarks in the Record without giving 
any hint of their contents.6 
Maass' book followed this example with two others 
from the committees that investigated the CIA. 
In January 1976, the House Intelligence Commit-
tee, under Chairman Otis G. Pike (D. NY) sought 
to make public a report containing information 
that the White House considered to be top secret. 
The House intervened, voting 246 to 124 to block 
the committee from releasing its report until the 
President certified that it did not contain informa-
tion that would adversely affect the nation's intel-
ligence activities. Whereupon Daniel Schorr of 
CBS News, having obtained a copy of the report 
presumably from a House member or staffer, 
gave it to the Village Voice, which published it, 
thereby frustrating an overwhelming majority of 
the House. Schorr was subsequently fired by 
CBS and became a cult hero on the college lec-
ture circuit, commanding top fees for one-night 
stands. 
. . . The Senate Intelligence Committee chair-
man, Frank Church (D. ID), went to the full 
Senate in November 1975 for approval of release 
of the committee's report on CIA involvement in 
assassination attempts against foreign leaders. The 
report included secret information that the Presi-
dent believed should not be made public. The 
Senate met in executive session, that is, secret 
session, and when considerable opposition to re-
lease of the report developed, more opposition 
than Church had anticipated, he and the Demo-
cratic majority adjourned the session without a 
vote, and the committee released the report on its 
own authority.7 
It is clear that leaks during this period were often 
motivated by an animus toward the CIA's mission in 
general or as a way of killing individual operations. 
The same Daniel Schorr who leaked the Pentagon 
Papers to the Village Voice wrote about leaks in a 1985 
Washington Post article. "The late Rep. Leo Ryan," 
Schorr wrote, "told me (in 1975) that he would con-
done such a leak if it was the only way to block an ill 
conceived operation." 8 In fact, wrote former Direc-
tor of Central Intelligence William Colby, "every 
new project subjected to this procedure [informing 
eight congressional committees] leaked, and the 
'covert' part of CIA's covert action seemed almost 
gone." 9 
The Still Leaky Congress During 
the Reagan Years 
By the late 1970s, the House and Senate had formed 
intelligence committees, reducing the number of com-
mittees to which intelligence agencies had to report. 
That clearly improved the situation, but it did not 
cure all problems. Senator Joseph Biden, then a 
member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, 
sounded a bit like the late Leo Ryan in a 1986 Brit 
Hume article from The New Republic. Biden reported-
ly said he had "twice threatened to go public with 
covert action plans by the Reagan administration that 
were harebrained."1? 
In 1984, according to an article by Robert Cald-
well, CIA officials briefed the same Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence about information indicat-
ing that the Government of India was considering a 
preemptive strike against Pakistan's nuclear facility. 
When word of the briefing leaked, the operation was 
halted. According to Caldwell, the leak showed India 
that it had a security breach at a high level. The 
breach was discovered and a French intelligence ring 
was put out of business." 
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was 
one of the bodies to which the President would have 
had to report the Iran arms sales. Of course the Presi-
dent could have limited the report to the committee 
chairmen and ranking minority members as well as 
the party leaders of the House of Representatives and 
Senate. The problem with this scenario is that some 
senior members of the committee have been suspected 
of leaking, as was discussed in the Committees' hear-
ings." The House committee has also been the source 
of some damaging disclosures. Bob Woodward's 
book, Veil, describes one incident that allegedly hap-
pened after members of the committee had sent a 
secret letter to President Reagan to protest an oper-
ation about which Director Casey had just briefed 
them. 
Representative Clement J. Zablocki, the chair-
man of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and 
a member of the House Intelligence Committee, 
had reviewed the . . . finding and the letter to 
Reagan. The sixty-nine-year-old lawmaker leaked

to Newsweek that the letter to Reagan about the 
yet unnamed operation in Africa was a plan to 
topple Qaddafi . . . . 
Newsweek reporters went back to House Foreign 
Affairs Chairman Zablocki after the Libya plan 
was denied. Zablocki went to House staff mem-
bers, tipping them that he had been a source for 
Newsweek He was set straight, but the House 
Intelligence Committee chairman, Edward 
Boland, decided to take no action against Za-
blocki, since leaks were epidemic.' 3 
Complaints and investigations about subsequent inci-
dents involving the House committee so far remain at 
the informal stage. 
To complete this picture of the world about which 
Poindexter had to make judgments: on November 3, 
1985?in the weeks just before the November arms 
transaction?a Washington Post article by Bob Wood-
ward broke a story about a "CIA Anti-Qadhafi Plan 
Backed."" Director Casey responded to this article 
with a blistering letter to the President about execu-
tive and legislative branch leaks. The Washingtonian 
magazine, accurately in our view, linked the atmos-
phere in the White House immediately after this leak 
to the decision not to notify Congress about the Iran 
arms sale." 
It may be that not all these reported details about 
named Members of Congress are true. True or not, 
they fit in with a real pattern. As such, they form part 
of the background Director Casey and Admiral Poin-
dexter had to consider in November 1985. It seems 
clear, with 20/20 hindsight, that Casey and Poin-
dexter overreacted. They may even have used the 
Post story as a convenient peg in their ongoing battle 
over secrecy with Secretary Shultz and others. But 
even if they did overreact, it is irresponsible to dis-
miss their fears as being simply irrational, power 
hungry or nefarious. 
Yes, some foreigners?Ghorbanifar, the Israelis, 
Khashoggi, the first and second Iranian channels?did 
have to know what was going on. That is the nature 
of any secret international dealing. The issue is how 
much should be told to anyone who did not have a 
need to know to complete the operation successfully. 
The simple fact is, we had no way of knowing wheth-
er our sources in Iran were endangering their lives by 
dealing with us. Judging from the thousands executed 
in the early days of the Khomeini regime and the 
recent execution of Mehdi Hashemi, the threat 
seemed real enough." Nor could we know whether 
the slightest misstep might get the hostages killed. 
Certainly, such threats against the hostages lives have 
been a part of the hostage takers' media events, and 
Kilburn's death was real. Given the track record, no 
one in Congress or the executive branch can afford to 
be smug about these concerns. Trust is a two-way 
578 
street, and each end of Pennsylvania Avenue had 
good reasons to doubt the other. 
Problems In These Committees 
Past leaks contributed to decisions that in turn led to 
these investigations. The leaks did not stop, however, 
when the committees started to work. The Commit-
tees began with every good intention. Recognizing 
that it was dealing with highly sensitive information, 
the leadership made a concerted effort to prevent 
leaks. The complexity and short time frame of the 
probe, however, led to a decision not to compartmen-
talize sensitive information. Consequently, everyone 
on the joint staff of some 165 people had multi-com-
partmented clearances and access to the highest levels 
of classified material. The same access held true, of 
course, for the 26 members of the two Select Com-
mittees. Given the number of people with access to 
these secrets, it is surprising there were not more 
revelations. 
We are reluctant to identify leaks with too much 
precision, because confirmation may help adversaries 
sort out the ones we consider harmful. Suffice it to 
say that the types of leaks included misleading the 
media on the nature of a witness' secret testimony 
several days before he appeared as a public witness as 
well as revealing intelligence collection methods, the 
identities of undercover personnel, and the names of a 
number of countries which, in one way or another, 
were trying circumspectly to be helpful to the United 
States in a variety of foreign policy undertakings. 
Needless to say, these disclosures, and others, are 
causing these and other countries to have serious res-
ervations about future cooperation with the United 
States. That turn of events should give us real pause. 
This is a highly interdependent world. It no longer is 
possible for the United States to go it alone, whether 
to combat terrorism or contain Soviet/Cuban expan-
sionism in Central America. 
Consider one example. On Friday, May 29, the 
Committees took testimony in closed executive ses-
sion from "Tomas Castillo," the former CIA station 
chief in a Central American country. At the end of 
Castillo's testimony, the following colloquy took 
place: 
Mr. RUDMAN. I just want to make one com-
ment. It is my understanding that the [declassi-
fied] transcript is going to be made available 
sometime tomorrow to the press. 
Chairman HAMILTON. That is correct. 
Mr. RUDMAN. It is also my understanding that 
under the rules of Congress and the Intelligence 
Committees that it would be inappropriate for 
any members or staff or anyone else to comment

on these proceedings without specific permission 
in some way from the chairman. 
Chairman HAMILTON. That is correct. Under 
the rules of the House Committee at least, you 
cannot release classified information without a 
vote of the committee and in the Senate my un-
derstanding is it is a similar procedure. 
Chairman INOUYE. That is correct.' 7 
Despite these explicit statements, articles appeared in 
May 30 newspapers with May 29 datelines accurately 
summarizing the testimony, and quoting named mem-
bers of the Committees giving broad characterizations 
of the testimony.* The declassified transcripts were 
not available until Sunday night, May 31. There were 
no Committee votes in the interim. 
Some of these revelations by staff and Members, as 
well as current and former Administration officials, 
occurred during intense questioning and cross exami-
nation of witnesses and appeared to be inadvertent. 
Such mistakes, however, suggest in retrospect that 
this nation's security interests would have been much 
*See, for example, R.A. Zaldivar and Charles Green, "CIA sta-
tion chief wasn't renegade, congressmen say," The Miami Herald, 
May 30, 1987, p. 16A; Fox Butterfield, "Ex-C.I.A. Officer Tells of 
Orders to Assist Contras," The New York Times, May 30, 1987, p. 
7; Associated Press, "Contra role told by ex-CIA agent," Chicago 
Tribune, May 30, 1987, p. 5. Interestingly, The Washington Post, the 
same newspaper that publishes Bob Woodward's intelligence disclo-
sures, distinguished itself from the others this day by refusing to 
publish certain classified information. The Post also gave no details 
about Castillo's testimony and quoted Sen. Rudman refusing to give 
information. Dan Morgan, "Higher-Level CIA Officials May Be 
Subpoenaed on Contra Aid," The Washington Post, May 30, 1987, p. 
A9. 
better served had we decided to take more testimony 
in closed session. Potentially damaging slips of the 
tongue could then have been redacted before a tran-
script was made available to the public. 
As a consequence of this probe, and that of Judge 
Walsh, this nation's intelligence community could be 
facing the same situation it confronted more than a 
decade ago after the Church and Pike Committees 
investigations. Leaks from those inquiries seriously de-
bilitated our overall intelligence capabilities and it 
took us over a decade to repair the damage. A rerun 
of that sorry chapter would have grave national secu-
rity implications, coming on the heels of a series of 
very damaging spy scandals epitomized by the 
Walker family case. 
What happened to Castillo's testimony, which was 
open to all Committee members and many staff, con-
trasts sharply with the executive session deposition of 
Admiral Poindexter on May 2, 1987. The two select 
Committees recognized that the Admiral's testimony 
on the diversion of funds was the pivotal, and poten-
tially most explosive political question of this whole 
investigation. As a result, extraordinary steps were 
taken to protect the information. Specifically, only 
three staff attorneys and no Members of either Com-
mittee participated in the secret questioning. The suc-
cess of these procedures speaks volumes on how to 
protect secrets. In the final analysis, as Chairman 
Hamilton noted in a perceptive article on protecting 
secrets that appeared in the September 4, 1985 Con-
gressional Record, "Leaks are inevitable when so many 
people handle secrets."" The most effective way of 
ensuring secrecy is to restrict access to sensitive infor-
mation to just a handful of responsible people.

Chapter 14 
Recommendations 
The majority report reaches the conclusion, accurate-
ly in our opinion, that the underlying cause of the 
Iran-Contra Affair had to do with people rather than 
with laws.* Despite this laudable premise, the majori-
ty goes on to offer no fewer than 27 recommenda-
tions, most involving legislation and several of them 
multifaceted. Some of the recommendations unfortu-
nately betray Congress' role in the legislative-execu-
tive branch struggle by proposing needlessly detailed 
rules for the organization of the executive branch. At 
the same time, the majority recommendations barely 
touch the problem of leaks, and say nothing at all, to 
no one's surprise, about Congress' misuse of massive 
continuing appropriations resolutions to conduct for-
eign policy. 
We do not intend here to give a detailed critique of 
the majority recommendations. We do believe that 
requiring the President to notify Congress of all 
covert operations within 48 hours, without any excep-
tions, would be both unconstitutional and unwise.** 
Many of the remaining recommendations seem to us 
to be unconscionably meddlesome. No good reasons 
are offered for prohibiting military officers, such as 
General Powell, from being National Security Advis-
er. No good reasons are offered for having the Na-
tional Security Council produce regular staff rosters 
for Congress. And so forth, and so on. It all strikes as 
more of the same: an attempt to achieve grand policy 
results by picking away at the details. 
In the spirit of offering recommendations, however, 
we are pleased to present some of our own. 
Recommendation 1: Joint intelligence 
Committee 
Congress should replace its Senate and House Select 
Committees on Intelligence with a joint committee. 
Congress has realized that limiting the number of 
people with access to sensitive information can help 
protect the information's security. The House and 
Senate took worthwhile first steps to limit the number 
of Members and staff engaged in intelligence over-
sight by establishing Select Committees on Intelli-
? See Chapter 8 in the Minority Report at 532-536. 
** See the Minority Report, Chapter 4 at 477-478, and Chapter 9 at 
543-545. 
gence. Unfortunately, as we have seen, security still is 
not tight enough. The time has now come, therefore, 
for taking the next logical steps. 
Given the national security stakes involved, Con-
gress and the Administration must find a remedy for 
restoring mutual trust. One major step in that direc-
tion can be taken by merging the existing House and 
Senate intelligence committees into a joint committee, 
along the lines of legislation (H.J. Res. 48) sponsored 
by Representative Henry Hyde and a bipartisan group 
of 135 cosponsors (see Appendix C). Such a commit-
tee need not have the 32 Members (plus four ex-
officio) and 55 staff now needed for two separate 
committees. Fewer Members, supported by a small 
staff of apolitical professionals, could make up the 
single committee. In recognition of political reality, 
the majority-party membership from each House 
would have a one vote edge. 
A joint intelligence panel would drastically dimin-
ish the opportunities for partisan posturing and sub-
stantially reduce the number of individuals with 
access to classified and sensitive information. This 
would not only minimize the risk of damaging unau-
thorized disclosures but would also significantly in-
crease the likelihood of identifying leak sources?
something that rarely occurs now because so many 
people are in the "intelligence information loop." Fur-
thermore, with the possibility of discovery so much 
greater, potential leakers would be strongly deterred 
from unauthorized disclosures. 
To achieve both efficiency and secrecy in congres-
sional consideration of intelligence matters, a Joint 
Intelligence Committee must have legislative as well 
as oversight jurisdiction. Otherwise, the two Houses 
would not give the Joint Committee the deference the 
two existing intelligence committees enjoy. Neither 
would the intelligence agencies have the budget-based 
incentives to cooperate with the Joint Committee as 
they have now with the two select committees. Inad-
equate jurisdiction might also prompt the various 
committees in each House with historical interests in 
intelligence to reassert themselves. That could trigger 
increased fractionalization of the congressional over-
sight process, with the concomitant proliferation 
within the Congress of access to sensitive intelligence 
information.

Chapter 14 
Recommendation 2: Oath and Strict 
Penalties for Congress. 
To improve security, the Joint Intelligence Committee (or 
the present House and Senate committees) should adopt 
a secrecy oath with stiff penalties for its violation. 
Creating a joint committee will not by itself guaran-
tee the security of intelligence information. Also es-
sential is committee self-discipline. Earlier, we pointed 
out how the reputations of the Senate and House 
Intelligence Committees have been sullied by leaks 
from Members or staff. As the importance of congres-
sional oversight, and the reputation for leaking, both 
grow, foreign intelligence agencies are discouraged 
from unguarded cooperation with the United States. 
Change is therefore urgent both to stanch the flow of 
leaks and to symbolize to foreign countries that Con-
gress is serious about preserving the confidentiality of 
secrets. 
One significant change that would help further both 
goals would be to require an oath of secrecy for all 
Members and staff of the intelligence committees. 
Such an oath would not be an American novelty. As 
we have already noted, the Continental Congress' 
Committee on Secret Correspondence required all of 
its members and employees to pledge not to divulge, 
directly or indirectly, any information that required 
secrecy. 
The proposed oath should read: "I do solemnly 
swear (or affirm) that I will not directly or indirectly 
disclose to any unauthorized person any information 
received in the course of my duties on the [Senate, 
House or Joint] Intelligence Committee except with 
the formal approval of the Committee or Congress." 
The Committee Rules should be amended to 
compel permanent expulsion from the committee of 
any member or staff person who violates his or her 
oath. While proceedings remain pending, the accused 
would be denied access to classified information. The 
rules of the House and Senate should also be amended 
to provide that the Intelligence Committee would be 
authorized to refer cases involving the unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information to the Ethics Com-
mittees. The rules should make it clear that the Ethics 
Committees may recommend appropriate sanctions, 
up to and including expulsion from Congress. 
This approach is well within the Constitution's ex-
pulsion power and the power of each House to set 
rules for its own proceedings. The power of each 
House of Congress to expel Members for misbehavior 
by two-thirds vote is virtually uncircumscribed. His-
torically, fifteen Senators and four Representatives 
have been expelled. Fourteen of the Senators were 
expelled for supporting the Confederate secession. 
The fifteenth, Senator Blount, was for conspiring with 
Indian tribes to attack Spanish Florida and Louisiana. 
The House and Senate also have considered and re-
fused expulsion on twenty-four occasions for charges 
as varied as corruption, disloyalty, Mormonism, trea-
584 
sonable utterances, dueling, and attacking other Mem-
bers of Congress. Expulsion decisions of Congress are 
probably beyond judicial review.2 
Any set of recommendations that limits itself to 
Congress would not be adequate to respond to the 
problem of leaks. Therefore, we recommend a more 
balanced approach that would stiffen the penalties for 
others who participate in this activity. 
Recommendation 3: Strengthening 
Sanctions 
Sanctions against disclosing national security secrets or 
classified information should be strengthened. 
Current federal law contains many provisions pro-
hibiting the disclosure of classified information, but 
each of the existing provisions has loopholes or other 
difficulties that make them hard to apply. The section 
that covers the broadest spectrum of information, 
"classified information," only prohibits knowing, un-
authorized communication to a foreign agent or 
member of a specified Communist organization.3 
Another set of provisions contains no such limit on 
the recipient of the information, but applies only to 
information related to the national defense.4 For some 
specified information, unauthorized disclosure or 
transmission is criminal under any circumstances.5 
The transmission of other "information relating to the 
national defense" to an unauthorized person is also 
illegal if a person has reason to believe the informa-
tion would be used to injure the United States or to 
benefit a foreign nation. The problem with these pro-
visions is that they cover only "information relating 
to the national defense" rather than the full range of 
national security information whose secrecy the gov-
ernment has a legitimate reason to protect.6 
A third set of provisions in current law is limited to 
nuclear weapons production.7 A fourth is limited to 
information about ciphers or communications intelli-
gence.5 This is the law that the National Security 
Agency Director, General William E. Odom, believes 
should be applied more vigorously against both feder-
al employees and the press.* 
? 
* The following is quoted from Molly Moore, "Prosecution of 
Media for Leaks Urged," The Washington Post, Sept. 3, 1987, p. 
A4: 
"I don't want to blame any particular area for leaking," said 
Odom, who added, "There's leaking from Congress . . . there's 
more leaking in the administration because it's bigger. I'm just stuck 
with the consequences of it. 
Leaks have damaged the [communications intelligence] 
system more in the past three to four years than in a long, long 
time." 
Odom said he has encouraged the administration to use an 
obscure law that prohibits disclosures of "communications intelli-
gence." Odom said he has referred several cases involving news 
leaks to the Justice Department since 1985 but said the department 
has declined to prosecute any of them. The department said it has 
not prosecuted any so far. . . .

Chapter 14 
Finally, a fifth provision?also limited in the infor-
mation it protects?makes illegal the disclosure of 
agents' identities. This law is also restricted to disclo-
sures by someone who (a) has authorized access to 
the identity from classified information or (b) is en-
gaged in a "pattern of activities intended to identify 
and expose covert agents" with reason to believe the 
publicity would impair the foreign intelligence activi-
ties of the United States.9 The latter limitation means 
that the agent disclosure law does not cover most 
normal press disclosures, such as the ones we men-
tioned earlier about reports based on these commit-
tees' work, because they are not normally part of a 
pattern or practice of identifying covert agents. 
In order to close these loopholes, Rep. Bill McCol-
lum has introduced a bill (H.R. 3066) co-sponsored by 
all the other Republican members of the House Iran 
Committee. The bill is limited to current and past 
federal employees in any branch of government. For 
these people, the bill would make it a felony know-
ingly to disclose classified information or material 
(not just specific national defense information) to any 
unauthorized person, whatever the intent. 
Another approach that would supplement the 
McCollum bill would be to introduce substantial civil 
penalties for the knowing disclosure of classified in-
formation to any unauthorized person. The penalties 
might range from administrative censure to a perma-
nent ban on federal employment and a fine of $10,000. 
The advantage of giving the Justice Department the 
option of using a civil statute would be (a) that the 
standard for proof would be the preponderance of 
evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
and (b) the law could stipulate that contested viola-
"Generally, when I'm with a group of journalists, I can 
usually see two or three people who fall in the category of those 
who probably could be successfully prosecuted," Odom told the 
reporters. 
The following material, from the same press briefing, is from 
Norman Black, "Gen. Odom blames leaks for 'deadly' intelligence 
loss," Associated Press dispatch published in The Washington 
Times, Sept. 3, 1987, pp. 1, 12: 
Asked to provide examples, Gen. Odom said he didn't want 
"to get specific right now and compound the things, but a number 
of sources have dried up in some areas which you are all familiar 
with, in the past year or two. 
A number of years ago there was a case that had to do with 
a Damascus communication. . . It was a leak. It attributed this 
thing to an intercept. And the source dried up immediately," Gen. 
Odom said. 
Asked then about Libya, he replied, "Libya, sure. Just deadly 
losses." 
tions should be heard in secret, without a jury. These 
procedures should not encounter constitutional diffi-
culties in light of the Supreme Court's broad endorse-
ment of controls on the disclosure of classified infor-
mation in Snepp v. U.S.? 
Recommendation 4: Gang of Four 
Permit the President to not the "Gang of Four" in-
stead of the "Gang of Eight" in special circumstances. 
Representative Broomfield has introduced a bill 
that, among other things, would permit the President 
on extremely sensitive matters to notify only the 
Speaker of the House, House Minority Leader, Senate 
Majority Leader and Senate Minority Leader. Under 
current law, limited notification means notification of 
these four plus the chairmen and ranking minority 
members of the two intelligence committees. On the 
principal that notifying fewer people is better in ex-
tremely sensistive situations, we would be inclined to 
support legislation along these lines that would ratify 
what has already come to be an informal occasional 
practice. 
Recommendation 5: Restore Presidential 
Power to Withstand Foreign Policy by 
Continuing Resolution 
Require Congress to divide continuing resolutions into 
separate appropriations bills and give the President an 
item veto for foreign policy limitation amendments on 
appropriations bills. 
The way Congress made foreign policy through the 
Boland Amendment is all too normal a way of doing 
business. Congress uses end of the year continuing 
resolutions to force its way on large matters and 
small, presenting the President with a package that 
forces him to choose between closing down the Gov-
ernment or capitulating. Congress should give the 
President an opportunity to address the major differ-
ences between himself and the Congress cleanly, in-
stead of combining them with unrelated subjects. To 
restore the Presidency to the position it held just a 
few Administrations ago, Congress should exercise 
the self-discipline to split continuing resolutions into 
separate appropriation bills and present each of them 
individually to the President for his signature or veto. 
Even better would be a line-item veto that would 
permit the President to force Congress to an override 
vote without jeopardizing funding for the whole gov-
ernment.

Representative Dick Cheney 
Ranking Minority Member 
House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms 
Transactions with Iran

To the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee: 
The enclosure to this letter, entitled "Reporting Obligations and 
Funding Restrictions Affecting Intelligence Departments, Agencies 
and Entities of the United States," is submitted to your Commit-
tee through the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I 
have prepared the enclosed statement in reply to your letter of 
September 3, 1987 (Enclosure 1). 
That letter requested my observations and recollections of the 
legislative history of intelligence law that: 
o "might be helpful to the Committee in its evaluation 
of whether any laws were violated by members of the 
executive branch in the Iran/Contra affair"; and/or 
o "relate to the concept of an 'intelligence agency' or 
'intelligence entity' as traditionally understood by 
Congress or the Chief Executive." 
In preparing a response to your letter, I have reviewed my 
records pertaining to the legislative history of both enacted 
intelligence legislation and executive orders for the period 
1974-1984. Based upon this review and my experience as the 
longest continuously-serving consultant to the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence in the period 1976-1984, I have 
prepared Enclosure 2. 
My review of pertinent records brought to my attention a related 
issue: whether authorizations for covert activities to be 
conducted under the direction of the National Security Council 
should be subject to a preceding legal opinion respecting the 
conformity of the proposed activity to United States law. 
In 1974 I reviewed the legal authority for the conduct and 
control of foreign intelligence activities of the United States, 
under sponsorship of the Intelligence Pinel of the Murphy Com-
mission, with the cooperation of the NSC staff and general 
counsels of the various intelligence agencies.

At that time I posed for the Commission's Intelligence Panel a 
set of issues relating to legal authority and accountability. 
In particular, I invited the Commission to consider whether 
the National Security Act of 1947 should be amended to require, 
before NSC authorization of covert activities, an opinion as to 
the activity's legality under the laws of the United States and 
obligations of the United States under international law. 
Enclosure 3 provides a copy of the Murphy Commission Intelligence 
Issues Paper, "Legal Authority for the Conduct and Control of 
Foreign Intelligence Activities," as revised on November 22, 
1974. See in particular pages 18 to 22, Issue 010 at pp. 21-22, 
and Appendix 2. 
The Chairman of the Intelligence Panel and the Commission, 
Ambassador Robert D. Murphy, did not favor my proposal to estab-
lish a Legal Adviser to the National Security Council, both 
because the Attorney General was the principal legal adviser to 
the President and because of possible impairment of presidential 
freedom of action respecting U.S. covert activities. 
The National Security Council is by statute responsible for the 
direction of CIA's performance of "such other functions and 
duties related to intelligence...." Had a system of mandated 
legal review and an NSC Legal Adviser been established in the 
1970s, it is entirely possible that the need for your Select 
Committee would not have arisen. 
I am pleased to learn that the present Special Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs, Mr. Frank Carlucci, has 
established the position of Legal Adviser to the NSC in January 
1987. This initiative assures the availability to the NSC of a 
legal officer. It does not by itself mandate legal review of 
proposed covert activities prior to Presidential finding and NSC 
direction. 
Intelligence activities of the United States can and must be 
conducted under the rule of law in a democratic society. I trust 
that the enclosed review of intelligence laws and Congressional 
oversight practices will assist your Committee as it completes a 
difficult task.

We understand that you participated in the deliberations 
and forging of events that culminated in the 1980 Intelligence 
Oversight Act, as a consultant to the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence. 
We further understand you played a role in the drafting of 
President Carter's Executive Order governing the intelligence 
community. We believe your expertise in these intelligence law 
matters might be helpful to the Committee in its evaluation of 
whether any laws were violated by members of the executive branch 
in the Iran/Contra affair. 
In particular, we would be grateful for any observations 
or recollections that relate to the concept of an "intelligence 
agency" or "intelligence entity" as traditionally understood by 
Congress or the Chief Executive. A letter to the Committee 
addressing these and related issues regarding the history, 
intent, or scope of the IOA and President Carter's Executive 
Order would be much appreciated.

REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDING RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING 
INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES. AND ENTITIES OF THE U.S.  
INCLUSION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND STAFF WITHIN  
THE SCOPE OF CONGRESSIONAL_ INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT UNDER S. RES.  
400 (1276). H. RES. 668 (19771. AND EXECUTIVE ORDER 12036 (1978).  
The Senate established, by S. Res. 21, the Senate Select Commit-
tee on Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activi-
ties (the Church Committee) in January 1975. This Committee con-
conducted broad-ranging investigations and drafted proposed 
intelligence oversight legislation that resulted in establishment 
of the present Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in May 
1976. 
Preceding S. Res. 21, President Ford signed into law P.L. 93-559, 
including as Sec. 662 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 
U.S.C. 2422] the Hughes-Ryan Amendment. This required a presi-
dential finding ("important to the national security") preceding 
any expenditure of funds for covert operations of the Central 
Intelligence Agency. It did not specify any reporting duty of 
the NSC or its staff. It did require the President to report 
each "finding" to the "appropriate" committees of the Congress 
"in a timely fashion...." 
This resulted in reporting of presidential findings to the full 
membership of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, to 
the Defense Subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees, and 
to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. [See Gary J. Schmitt, "Congressional 
Oversight of Intelligence," Spring 1985.] Subsequent to the 
establishment of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees in 
1976 and 1977, respectively, the "appropriate" committees 
included more than 150 members. 
My records indicate that in 1975, a staff attorney of the Senate 
Select Committee on Government Activities with Respect to 
Intelligence Activities, Ms. Martha Talley, prepared for the 
Committee a draft "Intelligence Oversight Act of 1975." The 
committee's draft legislation was not introduced in that year, 
but is indicative of the scope and intent of the oversight legis-
lation that the Senate approved (S. Res. 400) the following year. 
The draft Intelligence Oversight Act of 1975 contained both 
proposed amendments to Senate rules (sec. 4 through 10) and 
proposed legislation (sec. llff.). Proposed Section 6(a)(1)(B) 
[Sec. 3(a)(2) of S. Res. 400] provided jurisdiction over 
intelligence activities of all other departments and agencies of 
the Government...." 
The scope of proposed legislative oversight reflected the exper-
ience of a committee responsible for investigating intelligence 
activities of the entire government. The committee did in fact

3 
investigate intelligence activities of the Postal Service, the 
Internal Revenue Service, and other agencies outside the intelli-
gence community whose activities raised issues of legality or 
propriety. 
The analysis of Section 6 prepared by Ms.Talley for the Committee 
in 1975 indicated: 
"The Committee would have oversight and legislative 
jurisdiction of intelligence activities engaged in 
by the following agencies, their successors, employees, 
subcontractors, and proprietaries: 
69 
? ? ? 
"7. National Security Council, and its 
subcommittees, panels and working groups 
with authority to deal with intelligence, 
counterintelligence, internal security, 
and related matters". 
My records indicate that Senate Select Committee completed a 
revised Staff Draft S. Res. on December 31, 1975, to 
establish a Senate Committee on Intelligence. Sec. 8 retained 
government-wide jurisdicLion and pi-oposed (per the suggestion of 
a Senator who served on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy) a 
duty of "each department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
government" to keep the Committee "fully and currently informed 
with respect to all intelligence and counterintelligence poli-
cies, programs, and activities which are the responsibility of, 
or are planned, supervised, financed, or carried out by, such 
department, agency, or instrumentality...." 
The "currently and fully informed" standard was derived from 
Section 202 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 [42 U.S.C. 2252]. 
In January 1976 the Office of the U.S. Senate Legislative Counsel 
prepared a redraft of S. , titled the "Intelligence Oversight 
Act of 1976:' Section 6(a)(1)(B) retained jurisdiction over the 
"intelligence activities of all other departments and agencies of 
the government...." This language was retained in Sec. 3(a) of 
S. Res. 400. Sec. 13, which, as later modified, became Sec. 11 
of S. Res. 400, proposed a duty for the head of each department 
or agency of the United States to keep the Senate intelligence 
oversight committee - 
596 
"fully and currently informed with respect to all 
intelligence activities which in any respect are 
the responsibility of or are planned, supervised, 
financed, or engaged in by such department or 
agency."

The above-quoted language, preserving the exact language of Sec. 
11(a) of the draft Intelligence Oversight Act of 1975, appeared 
unworkable to representatives of intelligence agencies in early 
1976. In early 1976, the Special Counsel to the Director of 
Central Intelligence, Mitchell Rogovin, proposed alternative 
reporting language in a meeting with William R. Harris, a 
Consultant to the Senate Committee. My records indicate that the 
Rogovin-Harris substitute read: 
"...it shall.. .be the duty of the head of each depart-
ment and agency of the United States to keep the 
Committee on Intelligence Activities fully and 
currently informed with respect to intelligence 
activities which are the responsibility of such 
department or agency." 
This language retained a reporting duty for each department or 
agency of the United States, without restriction to agencies of 
the intelligence community. It was later amended by Senatorial 
initiative to add the phrase "including any significant 
anticipated activities...." before its introduction on March 1, 
1976 (with 19 co-sponsors) as S. Res. 400. 
On April 9, 1976, the Senate Rules Committee favorably reported 
S. Res. 400, and on May 19, 1976, the Senate considered, amended 
and approved S. Res. 400 by a vote of 72 to 22. 
Sec. 11(a) provided: "It is the sense of the Senate 
that the head of each department and agency of the 
United States should keep the select committee fully 
and currently informed with respect to intelligence 
activities, including any significant anticipated 
activities, which are the responsibility of or engaged 
in by such department or agency;..." 
Sec. 14(a) defined "intelligence activities" to 
include intelligence, counterintelligence, 
covert or clandestine activities (without 
specific restriction to an intelligence agency's 
sponsorship), and internal security intelligence. 
Sec. 14(b) included in the definition of 
"department or agency" any federal organization, 
including any "committee, council, establishment, 
or office within the Federal Government." 
[For parallel definitions adopted by the House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, see 
H. Res. 658 of July 14, 1977, Rule XLVIII, sec.

"(p)rior notice to the Intelligence Committees of significant 
covert actions programs has been the practice since 1976..."

[See prepared statement of William G. Miller, former Staff 
Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sep. 22, 
1983, HPSCI Hearings, Comm. Print, 1984]. 
On July 14, 1977 the House of Representatives established the 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, adopting H. 
Res. 658 by a vote of 247 to 171. The House Committee juris-
diction paralleled that of the Senate Committee, without re-
striction to agencies of the intelligence community. 
The following month staff assistants of the President asked the 
staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to review a 
draft Executive Order on intelligence activities. With 
amendments, some suggested by the Committee staff, this became 
President Carter's Executive Order 12036 of January 24, 1978. 
Section 3-4 of E.O. 12036 [43 F.R. 3674 at 3689-90] provided for 
reports to the intelligence committees of Congress. It applied 
to the "Director of Central Intelligence and heads of depart-
ments and agencies of the United States involved in intelligence 
activities." It utilized the "fully and currently informed" 
standard of the Atomic Energy Act and S. Res. 400 of 1976. It 
included a duty to report on significant anticipated activities 
"which are the responsibility of, or engaged in, by such depart-
ment or agency." 
In sum, the legislative history of enabling resolutions of 1976 
and 1977 for the present intelligence oversight committees of 
Congress indicate legislative intent that Any head of a depart-
ment, agency or institution that is involved in intelligence 
activities report to these committees. The initial draft of 1975 
explained an intent to include the National Security Council 
within the purview of the reporting duties. 
Executive Order 12036 of January 1978 applied to all departments 
and agencies of the United States, and impliedly would cover the 
National Security Council staff were it to have proposed to 
engage in "significant anticipated activities" during application 
of this Executive Order in 1978-1981. 
EXCLUSION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND STAFF FROM THE 
SCOPE OF MANDATORY REPORTING DUTIES UNDER THE INTELLIGENCE 
OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1980.  
In 1978 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, through a 
subcommittee chaired by Senator Walter Huddleston, introduced 
draft legislation that, were it enacted, would have reduced the 
scope of mandatory reporting to heads of departments, agencies or 
other entities of the intelligence community. On February 9, 
1978, Senator Huddleston and 19 co-sponsors introduced S. 2525, 
the National Intelligence Reorganization and Reform Act of 1978. 
Representative Boland introduced S. 2525 in the House as H.R. 
11245 on March 2, 1978.

As a proponent of streamlined, mission-oriented legislative 
charters, I did not actively participate in drafting the 263-page 
1978 charter legislation (S. 2525) or the initial 172-page 1980 
charter legislation (S. 2284). Section 151(g) of S. 2525 
required reports to the intelligence oversight committees by the 
"head of each entity of the intelligence community...." 
The 1978 Senate charter legislation (S. 2525) introduced the 
concept of an "entity" of the intelligence community, but did not 
include the term in its definitions. Sec. 104(16) did define the 
"intelligence community" without any express inclusion of the NSC 
or its staff, and impliedly exempted that Council and staff from 
mandatory reporting. 
A limitation of mandatory reporting duties to the head of each 
"entity of the intelligence community" remained in the provisions 
of S. 2284, the National Intelligence Act of 1980, introduced by 
Senator Huddleston, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Charters and 
Guidelines, on February 8, 1980. See Section 142(a). Rep. 
Boland introduced a companion bill, H.R. 6588 in that same month. 
As opposition to detailed legislative charters developed in the 
executive branch (objecting to reporting other than "in a timely 
fashion") and in the Congress, the Senate Select Committee Staff 
Director approved my review of the 172-pagesfor the purpose of 
abbreviation and simplification consistent with protection of 
civil rights and safeguards. I consulted with Keith Raffel, John 
Elliff, and others of the Committee staff between February 14 and 
March 19, 1980, first to make technical changes in S. 2284 as 
drafted, and second, to produce streamlined charter legislation. 
It was during the first phase of review in late February 1980 
that I identified the failure of S. 2284's oversight provisions 
to provide for mandatory reporting of NSC intelligence 
activities. I proposed to extend the reporting duties of Section 
142(a) beyond the head of each "entity of the intelligence 
community," for the express purpose of including the National 
Security Council and its staff within the scope of reporting 
duties respecting intelligence activities, including "signifi-
cant anticipated intelligence activities...." 
Neither Mr. Keith Raffel nor Mr. John Elliff, who had partici-
pated in the work of the Subcommittee on Charters and Guidelines, 
favored express inclusion of the National Security Council in the 
reporting duties under Sec. 142(a) of S. 2284. Neither claimed 
that the NSC was covered by the phrase "intelligence community." 
It is clear from the pertinent text on Congressional oversight of 
intelligence activities that neither the NSC nor its staff was 
covered. In particular, section 103(12) defined "intelligence 
community" and "entity of the intelligence community" to mean --
(A) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; 
(B) the Central Intelligence Agency;

(C) the Defense Intelligence Agency; 
(D) the National Security Agency; 
(E) the offices within the Department of Defense for the 
collection of specialized national intelligence 
through reconnaissance programs; 
(F) the intelligence components of the military services; 
(G) the intelligence components of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation; 
(H) the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the 
Department of State; 
(I) the foreign intelligence components of the Department 
of the Treasury; 
(J) the foreign intelligence components of the Department 
of Energy; 
(K) the successor to any of the agencies, offices, 
components, or bureaus named in clauses (A) through 
(J); and 
(L) such other components of the departments and agencies, 
to the extent determined by the President, as may be 
engaged in intelligence activities." 
Specific requirement of reporting by the National Security 
Council raised constitutional issues relating to "executive priv-
ilege" and separation of powers. It was my position that, unless 
the mandatory reporting duties included the NSC and its staff, 
there was a foreseeable risk of the NSC managing covert opera-
tions through the NSC staff itself, without a specific duty to 
report on such activities to the oversight committees of the 
Congress. The Charter and Guidelines Subcommittee staffers 
indicated that the President would not authorize this change in 
customary practice, precisely because, upon discovery, the 
Congress would enact legislation requiring mandatory reporting by 
the National Security Council or the President regarding its 
activities. 
At this point (on a day in February 1980 that I cannot ascertain 
from my records), I took the issue to the staff director of the 
Senate Select Committee, William G. Miller. Any change of the 
nature I was proposing would reopen constitutional issues of 
concern to the Attorney General and the Counsel to the President. 
Mr. Miller reminded me that both Vice President Mondale and David 
Aaron, the Deputy Special Assistant to the President for National 
Security Affairs, served with the Committee. The President would 
not permit, I was advised, the conduct of covert operations by 
the NSC staff itself. I reminded the staff director that intell-
igence charters must be designed to function under changed and 
partly unforeseen circumstances, well beyond the service of 
officials who knew the precise reasons for legislative action. 
The staff director decided to leave sec. 142(a) as it stood. 
Hence, I did not reiterate my proposed redraft when I summarized 
a set of possible amendments to S. 2284 on March 4, 1980. 
I did recommend providing the President additional flexibility,

under "extraordinary circumstances," to delay from 48 hours to 30 
days notice to the full oversight committee membership, so long 
as prior notice were provided the leadership and committee 
chairmen and vice chairmen (sec. 125 of S. 2284). This was a 
proposed amendment that was not adopted. 
On March 17, 1980 Representative Aspin introduced H.R. 6820, a 
much abbreviated intelligence bill. It retained the provisions 
of S. 2284, effectively exempting from mandatory reporting duties 
the NSC staff, even if they were engaged in intelligence 
activities. Sec. 102(a) stated: 
"The head of each entity of the intelligence community 
shall keep the intelligence committees fully and 
currently informed of all intelligence activities which 
are the responsibility of, are engaged in by, or are 
carried out for or on behalf of, that entity." 
On March 19, 1980 Keith Raffel, William R. Harris, et al., of the 
SSCI staff completed a streamlined, simplified National Intelli-
gence Act of 1980. Labeled "Draft C" (expectably following 
drafts "A" and "B"), it covered in 30 pages much of what S. 2284 
initially covered in 172 pages. It retained the concept 
"entities of the intelligence community," and once again excluded 
the National Security Council and Staff from its list of 
"entities" [sec. 101(b)(1 through 12)]. This draft provided an 
impediment to, if not a guarantee against potential unreported, 
self-executed NSC covert operations: Section 103(b) provided 
that special activities be "conducted only by the Central 
Intelligence Agency," except when the President determined that 
another agency should support an activity. Whatever the merits 
of streamlined intelligence charters might have been, the 
consensus in support of any charters legislation had disinte-
grated during the earlier drafting of detailed charters (S. 2525, 
and S. 2284). 
On April 12, 1980 the House Committee on Foreign Affairs provided 
for consolidated reporting of presidential findings, and 
favorably reported H.R. 6942. This retained the Hughes-Ryan 
Amendment, but reduced the reporting requirement from eight to 
the two intelligence committees of Congress. 
On April 17, 1980 the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held 
hearings on the role and accountability of the Special Assistant 
to the President for National Security. Whatever concerns the 
Foreign Relations Committee had did not result in legislation to 
require reports to the Congress on activities of the National 
Security Council or its staff. 
On April 17, 1980 the Senate Select Committee reissued a revised 
draft of S. 2284. Shortly thereafter, the executive branch 
submitted to the Senate Select Committee a document labeled 
"Agreed SSCI-Executive Branch Condensation of S. 2284." This 
document generally reflected agreements, but also set forth

executive branch preferences for legislative charters where 
issues remained unresolved. Section 132 retained a mandatory 
reporting duty for "the head of each entity of the intelligence 
community...." 
Of some interest, section 111(c) of the so-called "Agreed SSCI-
Executive Branch Condensation" specified that the Title not be 
construed to prohibit any department or agency from collecting, 
processing, or disseminating information if otherwise authorized 
to do so. Hence, the understanding of the executive branch 
(which had an interagency committee on intelligence charters in 
operation throughout enactment of the IntelligenceOversight Act 
of 1980) and the Senate Committee that drafted the legislation 
was that duties imposed by this Title not be applied to other 
entities of the federal government merely because they collected, 
processed, or disseminated intelligence information under other 
existing authority. Hence, the National Security Council, 
authorized by the National Security Act of 1947 to evaluate the 
quality of intelligence and otherwise authorized by the Presi-
ident, did not become an "intelligence entity" merely by reason 
of collecting, processing, or disseminating information. 
The Senate Select Committee considered S. 2284 in executive ses-
sion on April 30, and thereafter on May 1, 6, and 8, 1980. 
Senator Inouye proposed an amendment restricting prior reporting 
of significant anticipated covert activities under "extraordinary 
circumstances" as determined by the President. [See 50 U.S.C. 
sec. 501(a)(1)(B)]. Senator Wallop and Senator Moynihan proposed 
further reporting on significant intelligence failures. [See 50 
U.S.C. sec. 501(a)(3)]. See S. Rpt. 96-730 for a summary of these 
amendments. 
Oz 11;_t f!l, 1980 thc Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
unanimously approved S. 2284 as amended, containing primarily the 
provisions for legislative oversight and provisions to protect 
the identities of agents. On May 15, 1980 the Committee issued 
S. Rpt. 96-730, to accompany S. 2284, the Intelligence Oversight 
Act of 1980. This report indicated that "references to 'any' 
department, agency, or entity in subsection (a) impose obliga-
tions upon officials to report only with respect to activities 
under their responsibility, subject to the procedures established 
by the President under subsection (c)." [S. Rpt. 96-730, May 15, 
1980, p. 7]. 
On June 3, 1980 the Senate took up consideration of the Intelli-
gence Oversight Act of 1980, S. 2284. A colloquy on the Senate 
floor represented concerns of the Counsel to the President. Lloyd 
Cutler, and General Counsel of CIA, Daniel Silver, that diverging 
executive-legislative views on executive privilege and on manda-
tory reporting be contained in the floqr debate. The Senate 
adopted the Intelligence Oversight Act by a vote of 89-1. 
The Senate's provisions for legislative oversight [what became 
subsections 501(a) through (d)] were not contained in the House

Bill, H.R. 7152. In the September 1980 Conference, members of 
the House Intelligence Committee (Rep. Boland and others), the 
House Armed Services Committee (Rep. Price and others), and the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee (Rep. Fascell and others) agreed 
to the Senate provisions for Sec. 501, with a supplementing 
amendment [sec. 501(e)]. This amendment indicated that duties to 
protect intelligence sources and methods did not authorize the 
withholding of reports to the intelligence committees of the 
Congress. See the House Conference Report 96-1350, on S. 2597. 
The Senate (on Sept. 19th) and the House (Sept. 30th) agreed to 
the Conference Report. President Carter signed the Intelligence 
Authorization Act for FY1981, on October 14, 1980. Title V, the 
Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 [P.L. 96-450, 94 Stat. 975], 
provides in Sec. 501(a) [50 U.S.C. 501(A)]: 
"The Director of Central Intelligence and the heads 
of all departments, agencies, and other entities of 
the United States involved in intelligence activities 
shall --
(1) keep the Select Committee on Intelligence 
of the Senate and the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
Representatives...fully and currently 
informed of all intelligence activities 
which are the responsibility of, are 
engaged in by, or are carried out for or 
on behalf of, any department, agency, or 
entity of the United States, including 
any significant anticipated intelligence 
activity.... 
(2) furnish any information or material 
concerning intelligence activities which 
is in the possession, custody, or control 
of any department, agency, or entity of 
the United States and which is requested 
by either of the intelligence committees.... 
(3) report in a timely fashion...any illegal 
intelligence activity...." 
Notwithstanding efforts in 1980 to broaden its scope of coverage, 
what became Section 501(a)(1) of the Intelligence Oversight Act 
of 1980 did not represent a legislative effort to include 
operations of the National Security Council or its staff within 
the mandatory reporting duties of this subsection. Sec. 501 of 
the Intelligence Oversight Act did not prohibit the conduct of 
"special activities" by the staff of, the National Security 
Council. A precursor draft (Draft "C" of March 19, 1980) that 
would have prohibited covert operations other than by CIA except 
by Presidential determination, was not enacted.

Over a three year period from the initial drafting of S. 2525 in 
late 1977 through enactment of the Intelligence Oversight Act on 
October 14, 1980, the linked reference to "department, agency, or 
entity" engaged in intelligence activities developed a meaning 
widely understood in the executive and legislative branches. 
This phrase of legislative art applied exclusively to the intell-
igence agencies or specialized intelligence collection components 
of the U.S. intelligence community. This definition did not 
include within its scope other entities of government that 
supervised the intelligence "entities" or summarized and dissem-
inated their products. Indeed, the legislative history of the 
Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 applies only to such of an 
"entity" activities as are "under their responsibility, subject 
to the procedures established by the President under subsection 
[5013(c)." [S. Rpt. 96-730, May 15, 1980, p. 7]. 
SCOPE OF "DEPARTMENT. AGENCY. OR ENTITY" INVOLVED IN INTELLIGENCE 
ACTIVITIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1980.  
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12333 (1981)  
On December 4, 1981 President Reagan implemented section 413 of 
the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980, by signing Executive 
Order 12333 [46 F.R. 59941], "United States Intelligence 
Activities." 
Section 3.1 provided for the implementation of Congressional 
oversight. It established "[t]he duties and responsibilities of 
the Director of Central Intelligence and the heads of other 
departments, agencies, and entities engaged in intelligence 
activities to cooperate with the Congress in the conduct of 
its responsibilities for oversight of intelligence activities 
110 
Section 3.4(e) defined "intelligence activities" to mean 
"all activities that agencies within the Intelligence Community 
are authorized to conduct pursuant to this Order." Section 
3.4(f) specified agencies or organizations of the "Intelligence 
Community," excluding from the listing the National Security 
Council and its staff. It is notable that the Executive Order 
followed the established scope of the Intelligence Oversight Act 
of 1980, and also notable that the principal coordinator of the 
Executive Order, Kenneth DeGraffenreid, cane to the NSC staff 
from staff work at the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence, where he served during enactment of the Intelligence 
Oversight Act. 
SEC. 801(A) OF THE INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION_ACT FOR FY1984 
AND SUBSEQUENT INTELLIGENCE AND DQD AUTHORIZATION ACTS 
The Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 and the 1981 Executive 
Order implementing it define intelligence activities of depart-
ments, agencies or entities with exclusive regard to entities of 
the "intelligence community." This establishes a presumption 
604

12 
that only "intelligence community" entities are intended to be 
covered by other intelligence-related legislation utilizing this 
phrasing. But the presumption may be rebutted by evidence of 
actual legislative intent to the contrary. 
The October 20, 1983 amendment (Boland) to the Intelligence 
Authorization Act for FY1984 [P.L. 98-215, sec. 801(a)] pro-
hibited obligating or expending funds for the Central Intelli-
gence Agency "or any other department, agency, or entity of the 
United States involved in intelligence activities" for covert 
assistance to military operations in Nicaragua. [Roll Call 403, 
Cong. Rec. p. H8426]. 
The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1984, Sec. 108 [P.L. 98-
215) authorized not more than $24 million to CIA, DOD "or any 
other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelli-
igence activities which may be obligated or expended for the 
purpose or which would have the effect of supporting, directly or 
indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua...." 
The specific legislative history of these or subsequent Boland 
Amendments is not known to me. Consequently, I would not seek to 
evaluate whether the presumption of a limitation to entities of 
the "intelligence community" as defined in Executive Order 12333 
has been rebutted by the specific legislative history of these 
Acts of Congress. 
Acts of Congress requiring evaluation of legislative intent 
include: Sec. 106 of Title I of the Intelligence Authoriza-
tion Act for 1987 [P.L. 99-569] providing that funds available to 
the [CIA, the DOD] "or any other agency or entity of the United 
States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated and 
expended during fiscal year 1987 to provide funds, material...."; 
and Sec. 9045 of the DOD Appropriations Act for FY 1987 [P.L. 99 
-591] prohibiting expenditure of funds available to CIA, DOD "or 
any other agency or entity of the United States involved in 
intelligence activities...." 
INTELLIcENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FY1985.  
TITLE VIII. SEC. 801 
Sec. 801 of Title VIII of the Intelligence Authorization Act for 
FY1985 provided, without regard to the agency or entity sponsor-
ing the activity that: "No funds authorized to be appropriated 
by this Act or by the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal 
year 1984 [Public Law 98-215] may be obligated or expended for 
the purpose or which would have the effect of supporting, 
directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in 
Nicaragua by any nation...." This prohibition is not in any way 
limited to entities of the intelligence community.

SENATE EXERgISE OF INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT JURISDICTION 
JURISDICTION IN 1984 OVER THE BUREAU OF VERIFICATION AND 
INTELLIGENCE. U.S. ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT AGENCY 
This review of legislative history relating to "departments, 
agencies, and entities" involved in intelligence activities would 
be incomplete without noting the practices of the intelligence 
oversight committees since enactment of the Intelligence Over-
sight Act in 1980. The two oversight committees have a special 
stake in the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980, particularly 
because it treats their access to the information required for 
effective legislative oversight. 
To the best of my knowledge, in the period 1980 through 1983 the 
intelligence oversight committees treated Section 501(a)(1) as if 
it covered only entities within the intelligence community, as 
defined in President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 (1981). 
In the spring of 1984 the Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence, whose staff had drafted section 501(a) of the Intelli-
gence Oversight Act, first applied that section to an "entity" 
outside the intelligence community. During preparation of the 
Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1985, the Committee reviewed 
the requirements and capabilities of the Bureau of Verification 
and Intelligence of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
(ACDA). 
On behalf of the Chairman of the Budget Subcommittee (Senator 
Wallop) of the SSCI, in the spring of 1984 I reviewed the 
legislative history of the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980, 
and prepared a letter to the Director of ACDA, advising the 
Director of the Committee's assertion of jurisdiction under the 
Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980. To the best of my knowledge, 
after review of my proposed assertion of oversight jurisdiction 
by the staff director, the Committee Chairman, Senator Goldwater, 
signed the letter to the ACDA Director in the spring of 1984. 
Predictably, the Director of the Arms Control Intelligence Staff 
of CIA objected informally to the assertion of oversight juris-
diction, on the grounds that ACDA was not a part of the "intelli-
gence community" as specified in E.O. 12333. There was, however, 
a statutory basis for the assertion of jurisdiction. Section 37 
of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (the Derwinski Amendment 
of 1977) provides the Director of ACDA legal responsibility for 
verification of compliance and noncompliance with arms control 
agreements. The Bureau of Verification and Intelligence performs 
statutorily-required intelligence assessment functions under 
Section 37 of the Arms Control Act. The Director of ACDA 
accepted the Senate Select Committee's assertion of oversight

CONCLUDING MARKS 
In the period 1975-1978, Congressional investigations of intelli-
gence activities encompassed entities of the entire federal 
government, and proposals for mandatory reporting to the Congress 
mirrored that broad jurisdictional concern. 
Commencing in 1978, the intelligence oversight committees adopted 
the procedure of enacting separate intelligence authorization 
acts for all entities of the "intelligence community" engaged in 
national intelligence or counterintelligence. Concurrently, from. 
1978 onwards, draft legislation proposing mandatory self-report-
ing by heads of intelligence departments, agencies, or entities 
encompassed expressly specified departments and agencies and 
other "entities" that performed classified missions within the 
"intelligence community." Proposals in 1980 to extend the scope 
of "entities" to include the National Security Council and its 
staff were expressly rejected in the course of streamlining what 
became the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980. 
This legislative history establishes a presumption that parallel 
or subsequent legislation including the phrase "departments, 
agencies, or entities" engaged in intelligence activities applies 
to entities of the "intelligence community" and not the National 
Security Council or its staff. But the presumption may be 
rebutted by any specific legislative history of a later Act of 
Congress if that legislative history indicates unequivocal intent 
to prohibit the expenditure of any federal monies by any entity 
of the federal government. I am simply not aware of the precise 
legislative history of restrictive legislation that originated in 
the House of Representatives in 1983 and later years. 
Whatever the specific findings may be regarding the scope of 
legislative restrictions in 1984 and thereafter, a general 
principle must apply to all intelligence activities conducted in 
a democratic society: Intelligence activities and related covert 
activities conducted in the national security interests of the 
United States, must be conducted under and subject to the rule of 
law. I trust that the foregoing review of intelligence laws and 
Congressional oversight practices will assist your Committee as 
it completes a difficult task.

Chairman, The Select Committee on the 
Secret Military Assistance to Iran & 
the Nicaragua Opposition

Dear Chairman Inouye: 
During the course of the Iran-Contra bearings Lieutenant 
Colonel Oliver North apparently inadvertently created the 
impression that 'I had provided him with legal advice concerning 
the constitutionality and scope of the so-called ?Boland-
Amendment? that has been at the center of the beatings, 
although he seems to have implicitely corrected this in later 
testimony, Since I had not provided any such legal advice, I 
immediately 'called his counsel and sent a letter to correct this 
apparent misimpression. Enclosed is a copy of the letter that I 
would appreciate your making part of the hearing record. 
As a national security lawyer -- indeed one who has sought 
to pioneer the new field of national security law -- I have long 
urged the establishment of a strong legal office in the National 
Security Council (NSC) staff, with involvement in all activities 
of the NSC. When Commission was appointed I wrote a 
letter to Chairman Tower urging establishment of such an office. 
It was a natter of great satisfaction for me to see that the 
Commission recommended such an Office, that the President singled 
this recommendation out as one of the recommendations be believed 
most important to the Nation, and that Assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs, Frank C. Carlucci, has moved 
vigorously and effectively to implement this recommendation. 
This is, I believe, one of the most important structural changes-
in the national security process to emerge from the Iran-Contra 
affair and I hope that your Committee will endorse this change. 
As I am sure the Committee is aware, there is a great 
difference in levy:ming roles in being consulted for legal advice 
prior to events and a variety of lawyering roles, including public 
comment on the law, after events have transpired. Prior to 
events, effective lawyering should provide, among other things, 
advice that prevents persons acting in good faith from having 
future legal problems and advice that includes the creative 
potential of legal-system options for serving the national

interest. In contrast, after events have transpired, lawyers 
have an obligation to work for due process in protecting 
individuals who have acted in good faith, and in educating the 
public about important issues. In this latter connection, it is 
noteworthy that the hearings produced diametrically opposed 
interpretations of the applicable 'Boland Amendment' from public 
servants, all of whom seem to have conscientiously sought to 
serve the nation. Surely a major lesson of the Iran-Contra 
affair has been the great need for the structural change that has 
now been made of a strong legal office in the NBC to provide 
legal advice in advance as to significant MSC *activities.

Mr. Brendon Sullivan 
Williams & Connally 
17th and Eye Street, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20003 
Dear Mr. Sullivan: 
It has come to my attention that your client, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, 
may have inadvertently created the impression by his testimony this morning that I 
have provided him with legal advice regarding the constitutionality and scope of the 
so-called 'Boland Amendment that has been at the center of the current Iran-
Contra controversy. This may have been implicitly corrected this afternoon, when I 
am told he testified that he had received legal advice on this issue only from the 
present Counsel to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board, but I would 
appreciate your correcting the record should any doubts remain. 
As you are no doubt aware, I served as a Special Counsel for the United 
States in the Nicaragua case before the International Court of Justice. Subsequently, 
in my personal capacity. I have written and spoken widely about the war in Central 
A =rim including a book, The Secret War in Central America (published by 
University Publications of America earlier this year), and several addresses on the 
legal issues delivered before members of the press and congressional staff at the 
White House. 
There have, of course, been a multiplicity of 'Boland Amendments' concerning 
Nicaragua dating back to December 1912.0n more than one occasion in years past 
when I have been asked to address some of the legal issues involved in the Central 
American controversy 1 have expressed the view that I did not believe U.S. support 
for the Contra program conflicted with the 'Boland Amendment-referring at the 
time, of course, to earlier versions and events then known. Certainly this is 
reflected in my published writings and is a conclusion concerning these earlier 
'Boland Amendments that seems well supported by the record. I have been told 
that Colonel North was frequently called upon to address similar audiences, and 
although I don't recall encountering him in that context, it is quite possible that he 
heard me express such views on the i'Boland Amendment,' and he is likely to be 
familiar with my published writings. He may also have been familiar with my 
Opinion Editorial ''Government Under Law and Covert Operation? published in the

Page 2 
Washington Times on February 24, 1987, in response to the Iran-Contra controversy 
that docs make the point that the scope of the 1984-11S 'Boland Amendment' has 
been embroiled in a dispute. 
For the record, however, prior to the public disclosure of the current Iran-
Contra controversy late last year I had not even had occasion to examine the 1984-
85 "Boland Amendment.' and thus I am certain that I did not provide Colonel 
North or anyone else with a legal opinion' about its constitutionality or whether it 
encompassed the National Security Council. The first time I have had occasion to 
even preliminarily review the range of domestic legal issues involved in the Iran-
Contra affair was during the writing of an opinion editorial on the issues after the 
affair had become public. 
Although the 'Boland Amendment' at issue in the current controversy seems to 
mc, on the basis of a preliminary review, to contain relevant ambiguities--and at 
least one separation-of-powers constitutional scholar whose judgment I respect has 
expressed doubts to me about the constitutionality of at least certain 
interpretations of the amendment?I have not at this time personally taken a 
definitive position on these important issues which would, of course, among other 
things require a careful review of the legislative record. I have, however, on 
numerous occasions expressed my view in response to media inquiries, after the 
Iran-Contra affair had become public, that the relevant 'Boland Amendment' may 
well be ambiguous, and to the extent that it is, well recognized principles of due 
process and separation of powers would require that it be interpreted to protect 
Executive Branch flexibility. 
Thus, while I had not had occasion to review the pertinent 'Boland 
Amendment' prior to the Iran-Contra affair becoming public knowledge, and have 
still not had an occasion to do a careful legal analysis of that amendment and its 
voluminous legislative history, it is my preliminary judgment on reviewing that 
amendment that it may well be ambiguous in several key respects. It is also my 
judgment that there are strong policy reasons why any significant ambiguity should 
be construed in favor of continued Executive Branch authority. Certainly, when 
Congress does act in an area of sensitive presidential power, such as the conduct of 
covert activities, it must do so clearly. Any other conclusion does a serious 
disservice to separation of powers and the dedicated men and women who serve to 
implement foreign policy in the Executive Branch.

I have no doubt but that Colonel North's reference to me this morning was 
a consequence of misunderstanding. and I have no desire to add to his burdens at 
this difficult time. But as a lawyer, I am sure you can appreciate my concern that 
an inaccurate impression not be left that I have participated in providing legal 
counsel to Colonel North on the 'Boland Amendment* or any other national laws 
involved in the Iran-Contra affair. 
It would not be inaccurate for Colonel North, or any other individual, to note 
that on numerous occasions, including in my recent book The Secret War in Central 
Anterica,1 have publicly expressed my conviction that United States assistance to 
the Contras is consistent with the norms of international law as reflected in the 
United Nations and Organization of American States Charters. This is premised upon 
a factual recognition of covert Nicaraguan armed aggression against El Salvador and 
other democracies in the region dating back to at least 1980?a conclusion affirmed 
on several occasions by both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. This 
armed aggression?which predated by well over a year the United States decision to 
provide similar assistance to the Nicaraguan opposition in an effort to deter the 
ongoing effort to overthrow the government of El Salvador?violates article 2(4) of 
the United Nations Charter and numerous other prohibitions against aggression. It 
gives the United States a right of collective defense under Article SI of the United 
Nations Charter and, indeed, may create a legal obligation under Article 3 of the 
Rio Treaty to assist El Salvador to meet the armed attack. 
Enclosed is my Opinion Editorial `Government Under Law and Covert 
Operations.' as well as a just completed piece The Iran-Contra Hearings and 
Intelligence Oversight in a Democracy.* This latter piece raises important issues 
that, I believe, should be addressed as to whether the current public hearings are 
the most appropriate mechanism for intelligence oversight of covert operations.

Government Under Law and Covert Operations 
by 
John Norton Moore? 
The level of rhetoric about law violation in the Iran-Contra 
affair has been high. Some of the public debate has even assumed 
criminal violation, with prominent members of Congress speculating 
as to length of sentence and calling for Presidential pardons. Yet 
the discussion has been as void of specifics about such violations as 
it has been pregnant with allegations. 
Without knowing all the facts and the full context of actions it 
is not possible to make responsible legal judgment. It is important, 
however, that the debate proceed in a more complete context of 
assumptions about government under law. Both the important 
principle of due process and real-world complexities of the. rule of 
law for covert operations suggest that the level of rhetoric should 
be restrained as we focus more clearly on the enduring issues. 
First, no one involved in the Iran-Contra affair should be 
presumed guilty of law violation--much less criminal violation--until 
found guilty by a court of law. Just as our democratic system 
requires that government officials operate within the law it also 
provides that they be accorded a presumption of innocence until a 
duly constituted court finds otherwise. Similarly, it should be clearly 
understood that appointment of an independent counsel does not 
demonstrate law violation. The Ethics in Government Act, which 
Congress courageously did not apply to itself, has an extraordinarily 
loose standard for the appointment of such a counsel. This has been 
borne out by most such counsel reporting that no law violations 
have occurred within their mandate. It should also be understood 
that there is a major difference between civil and criminal 
responsibility. Criminal responsibility flows only from violation of 
clearly applicable pre-existing criminal statutes. Indeed, if individual 
criminal--or even civil--responsibility flowed inexorably from all 
nonconformance with statutes the members of Congress would be 
guilty of multiple offenses as they repeatedly ignore their own 
budget act. 
Most importantly, the structure of law as it applies to covert 
operations is highly technical and complex and the public debate has 
been as simplistic as the law is complex. For example, the public 
discussion of legal issues has assumed that the Arms Export Control 
Act applies to presidentially authorized special activities. Special 
activities, however, for reasons of their extreme sensitivity and 
secrecy, have their own legal structure and it may well be that this 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
and many other laws enacted for quite different settings do not 
apply to such activities. Given the strong constitutional 
underpinnings of special activities as presidentially directed, if 
particular statutory restrictions are constitutionally valid at all, 
certainly they would need to be unambiguous in their application. 
Similarly, much of the public discussion has assumed that the failure 
to provide notice to the intelligence committees constitutes a 
violation of the shall inform 'in a timely fashion' language of the 
Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980. But this ambiguous language 
papered over a serious underlying constitutional dispute between 
Congress and the Presidency as to whether the President must notify 
Congress of all special activities. Moreover, Congress conceded by 
the Act that not all such activities must be reported in advance and 
in that setting the more reasonable interpretation of *timely' would 
seem to relate functionally to the reason for great secrecy rather 
than a mechanical passage of time. The Carter Administration seems 
to have interpreted the Act this way as it spent months planning 
the Iran hostage rescue operation with no reporting under the Act. 
_These Executive Branch concerns about reporting all- special 
activities in advance to committees of Congress reflect enduring 
policy concerns about the ability of Congress as an institution to 
maintain secrecy. This institutional concern has been shared by the 
constitutional framers, George Washington as our Nation's first 
President, and by numerous administrations since, both Democratic 
and Republican. Moreover, a policy requirement for extraordinarily 
sensitive covert operations is to hold knowledge to the smallest 
possible group whether in or out of Congress. Informing members of 
Congress of all such operations not only increases the absolute 
number of persons with information but may also have a multiplier 
effect as Executive Branch personnel associated with Congressional 
relations become involved. Whatever the policy wisdom of not 
reporting, certainly the failure to report under the ambiguous 
Intelligence Oversight Act is not a legal scandal, and it is probably 
within the President's power both as a matter of statutory and 
constitutional law. To the same effect, most of the numerous 'Boland 
Amendments' limiting assistance to the Contras clearly do not apply 
to the activities in question and the one that may be applicable has 
been embroiled in a dispute as to whether it applied to activities of 
the National Security Council and, more importantly, is by its terms 
fact-sensitive, including whether particular funds were available to 
an agency or entity of the government within the meaning of the 
law. Whatever the policy wisdom of proceeding in the face of legal 
ambiguity (as well as other policy issues in linking the Iranian and 
Contra operations), policy shortcomings do not show that those who

acted did so illegally. Whatever the final resolution of a host of 
technical legal issues raised by the affair, due process suggests that 
the professional reputation of our public servants not be lynched by 
a post-Watergate mob that convicts of criminal violation when there 
may be no law violation, civil or criminal. We should remember that 
the essence of McCarthyism is the unfounded allegation. 
Second, whatever the final resolution of legal and policy issues 
in this case, the Administration should take this occasion to appoint 
a full-time general counsel to the National Security Council staff. 
After years of criticism by international lawyers who urged the 
addition of legal experts to the National Security Council, Dr. 
Zbigniew Bruzinski added an excellent lawyer to the staff who 
served about half-time as a legal specialist and that legal presence 
has been continued and augmented under the Reagan Administration. 
There should, however, be a clearly designated full-time general 
counsel on the staff with an office of one or two national security 
law specialists and that office should operate under procedures that 
ensure its involvement in all national security activities, overt and 
covert. It is simply a fiction that all national security issues, 
particularly those arising in crisis management settings, will 
inevitably be reviewed by general counsel in the major department:. 
The absence of full involvement of knowledgeable lawyers in national 
security decisions has for years harmed our national foreign policy 
under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Such 
involvement is not required solely to prevent illegal actions, as 
important as that may be. but also to provide relevant policy advice 
on associated political and implementation issues. If such an 
enhanced presence were needed two decades ago, it is now 
imperative given the extraordinary growth of national security law 
over the last two decades. In the future any foreign policy makers 
who do not seek legal counsel before a significant new activity have 
only themselves to blame for subsequent legal problems. 
Third, our Nation is likely to have no ability to conduct covert 
operations if it conducts its post-mortem of failed operations as the 
Iran affair has been handled. It is understandable, and probably 
desirable, once the public concern about the Iran-Contra affair had 
reached the level of hysteria, that the Administration request 
appointment of an independent counsel and Congress establish special 
Senate and House Committees to investigate. For the future, 
however, we should use the capable mechanisms established by law 
during the 1970s' sweeping reorganisation of intelligence oversight. 
That is, allegations about illegality and other improprieties in special 
operations should be investigated solely by the Senate and House 
Select Committees on Intelligence,, the President's Intelligence

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
Oversight Board, and the Attorney General. Following such 
investigations any illegal conduct should be made known to the 
American people. In the meantime, an Adminstration and the 
Congressional Committees should -neither confirm nor deny" 
allegations about special activities. We cannot expect as a Nation to 
retain the ability to conduct covert operations if allegations about 
such operations, perhaps leaked by our adversaries, can trigger a 
public orgy of self-flagellation. That is, a pattern of public 
disclosure and multiple investigations about the specifics of special 
activities, triggered simply by allegations of policy mistakes or legal 
impropriety, would cripple our ability as a Nation to have options 
that may sometimes be needed to avoid either war or capitulation to 
a ruthless enemy with no such constraints. There is an additional 
reason that public debate is not the appropriate forum to reach 
conclusions about covert operations. By the nature of such 
operations an Administration is usually not able to disclose the 
detailed information and precise context in which it acted-without 
disclosing intelligence sources and methods or betraying those who 
have trusted us perhaps at great personal risk. Thus, inevitably 
public debate about special activities is a struggle in which the 
American government as a whole must defend itself with both hands 
tied behind its back. The result is likely to be not an informed 
public but a misinformed public condemning its leaders on partial 
information. 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we must understand and 
deal with an underlying structural problem of enhanced 
Congressional activism triggering unintended confrontations with the 
Presidency during national security crises when the Nation can least 
afford to be immobilizing itself. In significant measure this 
structural weakness contributed to escalation of the Iran-Contra 
affair rather than damage limitation. During the 19502 and 1960s 
Congress acted with the Presidency to deter potential adversaries, in 
resolutions such as the 1962 Cuban Resolution. In a post Vietnam-
Watergate setting, however, Congress has more frequently sought to 
constrain American actions. Frequently these constraints, which have 
hugely multiplied in the last two decades, have undermined rather 
than enhanced deterrence. Certainly the to-date double reversal of 
Congress on support for the Contras is not a stable basis for a 
coherent American policy or credible deterrence. Even more seriously 
the pattern of Congressional activism has fueled potentially 
catastrophic constitutional confrontations with the Presidency as 
Congress has aggressively embodied in legislation, such as the War 
Powers Act and the Intelligence Oversight Act, its views of 
appropriate Congressional powers. Yet in each case its view differed

from the Presidential view and the President cannot, either as a 
matter of effective conduct of the Presidency or consistency with 
his oath to uphold the Constitution, simply acquiesce in what may be 
felt by the Executive Branch to be a usurpation of separation of 
powers. In this setting it is not surprising that strongly committed 
Executive Branch officials, however mistakenly, might seek to 
interpret ambiguities in favor of Presidential prerogative and stable 
policy. Nor is it surprising that real-world inadequacies and 
ambiguities for protecting secrecy in current oversight mechanisms 
for sensitive special activities would encourage a risky policy choice 
in withholding prior notice from Congress. Most dangerously, a 
continuation of Congressional activism in legislating Congress's 
version of separation of powers in foreign policy?legislation that 
constitutionally cannot alter the underlying constitutional reality.. 
may some day trigger a direct constitutional clash between Congress 
and the President in a national security crisis when the Nation has 
no margin for error. Surely government under law requires a more 
sensitive accommodation of separation of powers in foreign affairs 
than Congress writing its own ticket. Congress should, as part of 
the general introspection from the Iran-Contra affair, reflect on its 
own contributing role. At minimum our Nation needs a mnre 
effective legal structure to protect our most sensitive categories of 
national security information from either Congressional or Executive 
Branch leaks. Such reform could enhance broadened participation 
both in policy formulation and oversight of sensitive special 
activities. More broadly, Congress and the President should establish 
a joint Executive-Congressional Commission appointed half by the 
President and half by Congress to explore non-binding guidelines--as 
opposed to rigid statutory constraints?that both branches might 
accept aCrOSS a spectrum of foreign policy process issues, from the 
war powers to intelligence oversight reporting, to encourage the 
Congressional-Executive consensus on procedures for interbranch 
coordination our Nation must have for an effective foreign policy. 
No governmental task is more imperative for our national security.

The Iran-Contra Hearings and 
Intelligence Oversight in a Democracy 
by 
John Norton Moore* 
From George Washington to Ronald Reagan American presidents 
have understood the importance of intelligence. Following the 
surprise attack at Pearl Harbor and the American involvement in 
global war, the nation built and has maintained a strong foreign 
intelligence capability. Without such a capability, verification and 
thus arms control would be virtually impossible, enhanced fear of 
surprise attack would reduce stability and require higher arms 
expenditures, the nation would be largely defenseless against foreign 
intelligence operations, the national defense effort would bc blinded, 
and the nation would lose a range of options between diplomacy and 
war. 
But just as our democracy requires an effective foreign 
intelligence capability, so too it requires careful oversight of that 
capability. Covert activities, particularly, must be undertaken only 
after a careful vetting to ensure that they are truly in the national 
interest and are authorized according to law. Intelligence failures, 
such as the recent Iran-Contra affair, must receive careful review so 
that the same mistakes will not be repeated. And any allegations of 
illegality or impropriety, of course, must be promptly investigated. 
Intelligence oversight, however, is not like oversight of the 
social security program or the Department of Agriculture that can 
proceed fully in the open. Rather, it must respect the requisite 
secrecy of the intelligence process. Failure to do so can severely 
harm the nation's capabilities in intelligence. 
No one can review the evidence to date in the' Iran-Contra 
affair without understanding that serious mistakes were made, 
particulary, the repeated--but understandable--mistake made by 
virtually all the democracies to seek to bargain with terrorists for 
the release of hostages seized just for that purpose by radicals who 
trample both democracy and human rights. That mistakes were made, 
however, does not justify further mistakes in our process of 
oversight.

In my judgement the nationally televised Iran-Contra hearings 
are--and will be regarded by history--as a serious mistake in efforts 
at intelligence oversight. The motivation of the hearings and the 
professionalism of the distinguished panel of some of the Nation's 
most able legislators is not in doubt and is not the issue. Rather, 
the issue is whether publicly televised oversight hearings are the 
best form of oversight of covert operations taking into account both 
the need for effective intelligence and effective oversight. The 
answer is a clear no. 
The Iran-Contra hearings are a bad precedent in intelligence 
oversight for at least five reasons. First, to publicly reveal the 
details of failed American intelligence operations--of which the Iran-
Contra affair is not the first and will not be the last--will have a 
severe chilling effect on the ability of the nation to carry out 
intelligence functions in the future. Will other nations be willing to 
cooperate with the United States in secretive operations_ if they 
believe such operations can become public knowledge? Will vital 
sources of human intelligence become more difficult for the United 
States to recruit? Will foreign intelligence services be as willing to 
share information with the United States or to suggest possible 
opportunities for United States intelligence? The answer to all these 
and other such questions is surely negative for effective American 
intelligence if other nations perceive that our process?or even 
possible process?of oversight review of failed intelligence is to hold 
nationally televised hearings relishing in the details of all aspects of 
the operations. 
Second, because of the difficulty of fully discussing covert 
operations publicly?or they would not need to be covert--and the 
inevitable need to protect sources and methods, any public debate is 
likely to be distorted and one-sided in which the intelligence 
community--and the Executive branch as a whole?may well be 
unable to fully present the case for their actions. For this 
inescapable reason it is as likely that public debate about failed 
intelligence operations will misinform as that it will inform. The 
broadside against the President's Intelligence Oversight Board that 
emerged during the hearings is a good example. The Board was 
created in the wake of the Church Committee hearings as a 
mechanism for ensuring intelligence community compliance with law, 
and particulary in recent years it has had an important impact. 
Moreover, it seems to have been the only entity within the United 
States Government to have even raised the legal issues during 
continuation of the failed operations. For its effort, however, it and 
its legal counsel were publicly pilloried (and not on the merits but

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
on an attack against the counsel's credentials). Even more wrongly, 
the Nation has been presented with a distorted view of an important 
check in the process of intelligence oversight. 
Third, the hearings, while nominally in pursuit of legislative 
oversight, in many respects have the appearance of a clockwork 
orange trial by grand inquisitors for the titillation of a national 
audience. While the constitutionally permitted purpose of 
Congressional hearings is solely to support legislative function, the 
overall hearings give a strong impression of greater interest in 
demonstrating individual impropriety or wrongdoing. As such, the 
hearings are dangerously close to an abuse of Congressional power. 
Even more importantly, no court yet conceived has thought of 
interrogation of those called before it by multiple accusers, some 
with what could be regarded in other settings as a conflict of 
interest in demonstrating wrongdoing. Nor does due process permit 
preparation of the accusers case in secret or denial of the right to 
cross-examine or make a full statement. Even more importintly, the 
interrogation proceeds in an atmosphere of prejudgment about the 
law. And the judging panel reveals startling asymmetries in 
knowledge of the legal complexities of the case and opinions about 
the law. Many simply assume that shredding of intelligence 
documents proves criminality. Others make the assumption, without 
legal analysis, that one or more of a confusing array of Boland 
Amendments has been violated. Yet shredding does not prove 
criminality, and there are very fundamental legal issues concerning 
the relevant Boland Amendments, most particularly whether their 
real ambiguities concerning scope of applicability were intended by 
Congress to prohibit efforts at third nation or private support for 
the Contras and whether any ambiguities should be and would be 
interpreted in favor of continued Presidential power. Despite an 
absence of findings about the law, judgments about witnesses are 
solemnly delivered before a national television audience with no 
opportunity for rebuttal. Despite the professionalism and integrity of 
the Iran-Contra hearing panel and staff, nationally televised hearings 
such as this one do present pressure for personal or partisan 
advantage to which lesser legislators might succumb. If failed 
intelligence operations are in the future to be tried by this new 
televised star chamber, then we will inevitably destroy the careers 
of fine Americans whose crime has been to misread an ambiguous 
stream of congressional pronouncements or, indeed, even to do their 
investigative duty as required by the law. As the Nation bitterly 
learned in the McCarthy Committee hearings, trial by adversary 
televised congressional hearings may destroy the reputations of fine

Americans at little gain in legislative knowledge. It is a precedent 
we should carefully review and that Congress should limit. 
Fourth, if the Iran-Contra hearings are to provide broader 
legislative investigation of compliance with legal constraints on 
private sector support for competing factions in the Central 
American War, then they should do so on an even-handed basis. It is 
inevitable that an inquiry focusing solely on support for the Contras, 
and ignoring the extraordinary efforts by and on behalf of the 
Sandinistas and the FMLN guerrillas in El-Salvador, will have the 
appearance of an ideological imbalance. If one is a fit subject for a 
publicly televised national inquiry, it is hard to imagine the grounds 
on which contending efforts are to be ignored in such an 
investigation, if, of course, there is a genuine legislative purpose in 
such hearings as opposed principally to a focus on allegations of 
individual wrongdoing. 
Finally, the displacement of the normal intelligence oversight 
mechanisms established after the Church Committee hearings can 
only weaken those mechanisms that must do the important job of 
intelligence oversight on a day to day basis. This objection also 
applies to investigation of failed intelligence operations by an 
independent counsel. Our current intelligence oversight mechanisms 
are workable and include the bipartisan House and Senate select 
committees on intelligence, the Attorney General, and the President's 
Intelligence Oversight Board. If we are to strengthen these agencies 
in their oversight role they must- be permitted to conduct the review 
of failed operations and investigation of any illegalities or 
improprieties. As long as that review includes review by a bipartisan 
Congressional entity, there cannot be any serious concern that an 
Administration will simply cover up its own failures. The public need 
to know can be fully met by issuance of public reports where 
evidence of illegalities or other improprieties should be revealed. 
And certainly legislative facts needed for the legislative process can 
be assembled in the existing bipartisan select committees as well as 
in a public ad hoc committee. For the future, American Presidents 
should simply neither confirm nor deny allegations concerning 
covert operations and should refer allegations of improprieties or 
illegalities in such operations to the normal oversight mechanisms. 
And Congress, which fully participates in that process, should 
endorse it as the appropriate mechanism. 
No other. Nation seems to have had the poor judgement to 
review its intelligence failures completely in public. The Federal 
Republic of Germany has a small Parliamentary Oversight Committee

Approved For Release 2011/05/25: CIA-RDP89T00142R000500610001-7 
to provide intelligence oversight. Other democracies have similar 
effective yet secret processes. Nothing inherent in democracy or our 
desire for effective oversight requires that we periodically publicly 
cannibalize our intelligence processes or subject those who have 
served the nation to trial by television (the Tower Commission may 
well be correct that even our two selFct committees should be 
consolidated). 
Underlying the mistake in investigating the Iran-Contra failure 
by public ad hoc Congressional Committee is a more pervasive 
problem. The framers intended that checks and balances apply to all 
branches. Congress included. While it is not clear in the Iran-Contra 
hearing that Congress has overstepped its legal bounds, it is 
dangerously close to usurping both executive functions in 
intelligence and judicial functions in assessment of any individual 
wrongdoing. Yet there seem to be few real-world checks on growth 
of legislative power in the foreign affairs field, and elsewhere 
Congress has passed laws, such as the War Powers Resolution, that 
arc, at least in part, clearly unconstitutional. The growing 
confrontation across a broad range of foreign policy issues between 
Congress and the Presidency is increasingly harming the foreign 
policy effectiveness of the Nation. The problem is serious for 
effective American foreign policy and is getting worse. As one 
possible remedy I believe that the Congress and the President 
should establish a Congressional-Executive Commission, half 
appointed by Congress and half by the President, to review the full 
range of issues in Congressional-Executive coordination in foreign 
policy. Such a Commission should review not only the constitutional 
underpinnings and legal issues but issues of appropriate constraints 
on the exercise of Congressional power, particulary issues of 
effectiveness and effect on deterrence, and modalities of enhancing 
consensus between Congress and the President on a bipartisan basis. 
Whatever the resolution of the broader range of issues we should 
abandon the sad precedent of review of failed intelligence operations 
by public ad hoc Congressional Committee.

The Honorable Lee H. Hamilton 
Chairman 
Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms 
Transactions with Iran 
U. S. House of Representatives 
Room H-419 Capitol 
Washington, D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
In a letter to the Attorney General of September 23, 1987,, 
you solicited suggested changes in ,"law, policy or-procedure" 
which might help avoid another Iran/Contra situation. We 
appreciate this opportunity to comment and to suggest a change 
which is not new, but which is especially propitious in view of 
the Iran/Contra matter and investigation. 
The Congress should take one step which would decrease the 
likelihood of a recurrence. We believe that the creation of a 
joint Congressional Intelligence Committee, such as that proposed 
in both the 99th and 100th Congresses by Congressman Henry J. 
Hyde, would go far toward eliminating the environment which might 
contribute to a future Iran/Contra situation. 
Reducing the total number of persons with access to 
classified information and storing that information in a single, 
secure repository would strengthen Executive branch confidence in 
the Congress' legislative role in the intelligence process. 
Congress, in turn, would clearly benefit from this increased 
confidence by the receipt of timely and detailed reports of 
intelligence activities, and a renewed ability for in-depth 
cooperation. 
Aside from the establishment of a joint intelligence 
committee, the Department believes that the introduction of any 
other legislative measures is unnecessary. I hope you would 
agree that the Iran/Contra matter was an exceptional situation 
which lends scant support to the proposition that a massive 
revision of the intelligence statutes is required.

In addition, attempts to effect a wholesale revision of 
these statutes would require tremendous time and effort with no 
guarantee of beneficial results, as this is an area of 
constitutional law which remains uncertain at the core. In 
contrast, the creation of a joint intelligence committee is a 
practical measure which could be implemented swiftly and with 
obvious positive results. The Department of Justice is prepared 
to assist in whatever way we can in working with the Congress to 
establish such a committee.

Investigate Covert Arms Tra. ?icns

Ceur Sirs; 
I write this letter to shed light on what I believe may to a 
relevant portion of your report on the "Iran-Contra" hearinge--t!.e 
work -r 
ee the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and "--
Caribbean at the Department of State. During the final days of the 
hearings, Congressman Dante Fascell (D-FL.) made e number 
of 
references to the Office, and later, with Congressman Jack Brooks 
(D-TX.), epcneored a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) 
which made serious and erroneous accusations about the Public 
Diplcmacy Office. As a former member of the Office, I want to set 
the record straight, and thereby help you in the preparation of your 
final report. Although I am currently doing consulting work for the 
Department of Defense, no one in the Administration has asked me to 
write this letter, and I have not cleared it with anyone in 
government. 
Lot me fret establish my bona fides to comment on the ,IA0 
an0 the Office of Public Diplomacy. I was an army Colonel, asLi,4nc2 
to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
:nter-American Affairs from June 1980 until December 1982. : 
then assigned, at the request of the Department of State, to the 
recently-created Office of Public Diplomacy, where I s.:rved cc 
Senior Defense Advisor to Ambassador Otto Reich until my retirement 
from active duty and departure from government in May 1986. uring 
the 20 months that I was at the Department of State, I gave over 200 
speeches or. Central America, created the display of captured wapons 
and documents that President Reagan opened on March 12, 1936, en.l 
was the principal author of the Administration'r two meet 
widely-distributed publications, The Soviet-Cuban Connectiee in  
Central America and the Caribbean (the "Blue Book") and The 
Cone to Democracy in Central America (the "Silver Book";. : 
also developed the now-famous slide presentation that Lt.Col Oliver 
North and others in government used extensively to brief the public. 
The GAO Report, or Legal Opinion, makes the very serious charge 
that the Office of Public Diplomacy engaged in "prohibited, covert 
pr:paganda activities designed to influence the media and the petlie 
to support the Administration's Latin Amgrican policies". The 
evidence supporting this accusation is dubious, the methodology of 
the "investigation" questionable, and it is surprising that two 
experieneed Congresemen would endorse such a flawed analys17.

like to comment on the dangerous underlying assumption of the CAC 
finding, which appears to be that the Executive Branch has no right 
to inform the public of developments in the foreign policy sphere. 
In a democracy, it is a fundamental responsibility of the elec':' 
..eaders of the nation to keep the electorate informed of the dan;e:.: 
facing the country and the responses being taken by these elected 
leaders to solve such problems. If an Administration dissemina'us 
false inform-at:on to the public, that is indeed propaganda, and the 
Gong:ess and the mudia have a solemn responibility to 4; all in 
their power to put an end to such dishonest practices. But an 
intensive effort to inform the public is both a right and a:. 
obligation of any Administration, and it has been exerci2 
frequently in the past. The GAO Report appears to be an attempt 
limit this Inhc:e:-.t .:!!..t1,2uty of the Executive Branch. 
An excellent example of an intense public diplomacy campaign 
ried out by the Executive Branch on a foreign policy problem was, 
that conducted by the Carter Administration on the Panama Canal 
Traty. President Carter felt deeply about the issue, and decided to 
go directly to the American people with his side of the 
controversial issue. It was a political success. Although many in 
this coulitry disagreed with the Carter policy, I dc not recall 
anyone in Congress calling on the GAO to investigate a "propaganda" 
effort. The public was woll-served by the national debate that 
ensued, for the American people came to understand both the costs 
and the benefits of the Treaty, and were better able to advise their 
representatives in Congress of their position on the issue. That is 
the essence of democracy. 
:t was for the same objective--increasing public awareness of a 
i-aue--tLat the Public Diplomacy Office was formed in .7..:14 
1983. It was clear to those of us working in Central American 
affairs that the public was not well-informed on the area, had 
little knowledge of U.S. policy objectives in Central America, an.! 
  awareness of the threat posed to U.S. security interest:, by 
Soviet expansionism in the region. It was concluded that we in the 
government were at fault, for we had failed to develop the means by 
which we could communicate the issue of Central America clearly to 
the American people. Hence the decision to create an inter-agency 
?:rganization that would draw talent from throughout the Reagan 
Administration, with a presidential mandate to get the story to the 
American people of what was happening in Central America. The 
decision was made to place the organization in the State Department. 
The Public Diplomacy Office did not engage in "prohibited, covert 
propaganda activities", as the GAO alleges, but did indeed carry out 
an aggressive campaign to increase public knowledge about Central 
America. As the debate over aid to the "Contras" intensified, so 
did our efforts to let the public know who these young Nicaraguans 
were, why they were fighting, and what the corisequenceo could be for 
U.S. security if the Soviet Union succeeded in establishing a "Cuba" 
in Central America. Even critics of the Administration acknowledge 
that the Office performed effectively, and I am proud of the role 
played in helping to educate the public of the dangers faced by thio 
country because of Soviet amtition and Sandinista dup'1-"-y

Given .the criticism of the Office by the GAO, perhaps we did too 
good a job, as there are apparently some in Congress who wish to 
keep the public in the dark. Having travelled throughout this 
country speaking on Central America, I can assure you that the 
American people want more, not less, information about a region the 
know intuitively could soon become a battlefield for their sons. The 
respected Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, in Its 1227 
study, Trouble at our Doorstep, found that the American people 
telieve that neither the government nor the media are providin3 
with sufficient information upon which they can make common son:..:2 
judgements about Central America. 
The Congress has been unswerving in its declarations that J.S. 
interests cannot be permitted to be threatened by a permanent Co.t 
military presence in Central America. Having served in Vietnum, 
dc :.ot want to zee young Americans fight and d:2 
Central America in the future because the Congress is unwilling to 
send arms to young Nicaraguans who are willing to fight for their 
country, and thereby fight our battle for us. 
The CAC Report apparently was inspired by the discovery of a memo 
written in March 1935 by Jonathan Miller of ou-r Office to Pat 
Buchanan in the White House, in which Miller spoke of a "White 
Propaganda" campaign. Among the triumphs for the Office, according 
to the memo, were the placing of an article by Dr. John Cuilmartin 
of Rice University in the Wall Street Journal, and arranging a 
favorable . story on the "Contras" by Fred Francis of NBC. The CAC 
concluded from this memo, apparently without checking with either 
G,p:ilmartin or Francis, that this constituted "covert propaganda". 
Had the GAO looked beyond the memo, the investigators would %ave 
discovered that Cr. Guilmartin, as Lt. Col. Guilmartin, had been one 
of the United States Air Force's leading authorities on helicoitLr 
doctrine and tactics, and that any newspaper would have teen haprj 
to publish his expert opinion on the military implicatio.1 of 
delivery of MI-24 HIND D gunships by Moscow to the Sandinistaz. As a 
consultant to the Public Diplomacy Office, he had done ?a o.p:rt 
study for us on the subject, and submitted the Op-Ed piece to the 
Journal on his own, with no help asked or required from us. Th-r. 
allegation that we helped Fred Francis establish contacts with 
"Contra" leaders is laughable. Fred is one of the best conncotc2 
reporters in Washington, with far better and more extensive contacts 
with the the "Contra" leadership than anyone in the Public Diplomacy 
CfLce. required no help from us. 
Why did Miller include such statements in his now-celebrated memo 
to Buchanan? He was probably exaggerating our accomplishments in 
effort to curry favor for the Office with the White House, not :An 
uncommon tactic in the bureaucratic battles of Washington. Jonathan 
a sardonic sense of humor, and he may have been "Just 
as he told Ambassador Reich in October 1987 (See Washinoton Post, 
Cc:toter 11, 1937). Certainly, a memo of this nature 'sd be 
perceived as a "smoking gun", but it should have been the beginnin4, 
not the end, of the investigation trail. The GAO appears to presume 
;u:lt, then looks for "facts" to fit the a Priori assumption.

Media accounts claim that the State Department and Secretary of 
State George Shultz were not happy with the Public Diplomacy Office 
because it supposedly took orders from the National Security 
Council, not the Department Of State. The Office was an inter-agency 
creature, and certainly had close, almost daily contact with the 
NSC. But we worked within the State Department, and no one in the 
Office ever had any doubt but that we wcrked for George Shultz. 
There wa: probably resentment on the part of some in the Department 
about the creation of the Office, for it implied that the 
traditional means of informing the public about foreign affairs--the 
domain of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs?had been 
found wanting. At the wcrking level, however, we found little 
hostility, and in fact the Foreign Service Officers working thE 
Central American issue were happy to see an intensive campaign 
mounted to tell the public the truth about Nicaragua, and of Soviet 
and Cuban efforts to neutralize the United States by creating a 
state of perpetual crisis in the Western Hemisphere. It is doubtful 
that Otto Reich would have been appointed to the prestigious and 
critical post of Ambassador to Venezuela if he had displeased the 
Secretary of State by doing an end run to the NSC. Shultz, in fact, 
made it a point to swear Otto in as Ambassador to Venezuela 
personally, somewhat of a rarity for the Secretary. 
In closing, let me say that it would be a setback for our form of 
participatory democracy If a future President of eithor party is 
precluded from telling the American people what threats his 
Administration perceives, and what responses are being taken t: 7::t 
these challenges. I hope your Committee encourages, rather than 
discourages, the maximum flow of information to the public atzot 
Central America. Legislative muzzling of the Executive Branch will 
weaken our democracy, which must be based on an informed ,n4 
articulate electorate.
