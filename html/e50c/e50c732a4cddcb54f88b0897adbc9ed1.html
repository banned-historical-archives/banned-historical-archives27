 China, Korea, and the UN

 Peking and Washington are on opposite sides
 of the Korea issue again this year at the United
 Nations, but there are indications that the Chinese
 are persuaded that they can convince the North
 Koreans of their loyalty without becoming involved
 in a bitter confrontation with the US.
 Concern over the effect a confrontation in the
 UN might have on President Ford's planned visit
 to China later this year, as well as Peking's
 interest in encouraging a reduction in tensions
 on the Korean Peninsula, probably accounts for
 Chinese sensitivities on this score.   Nevertheless,
 Peking will provide strong support for North Korea's
 case in the UN in order to protect its equities in
 Pyongyang.
 Chinese press coverage of South Korea's
 unsuccessful application for admission to the UN
 set the tone for Peking's role in the UN debate
 on Korea later this fall.   Chinese press accounts
 relied exclusively--until after the August 6 vote
 on Seoul's application--on replays of North Korean
 propaganda, and Pyongyang's most vitriolic language
 was excised.
 I        The Chinese also ignored Pyongyang's claim
 that South Korea is a "puppet regime" that does
 not represent the South Korean people and North
 Korean assertions that Seoul could not survive
 without US military protection.  Moreover, Pyongyang's
 demand that the US immediately withdraw its troops and
 weapons from the South was excised from Chinese ac-
 counts.
 Peking media waited until the US vetoed North
 and South Vietnam's applications for admission to
 the UN before commenting directly on the Korea

 question.  On August 11, referring to the US
 vetoes as "unreasonable," NCNA summarized UN
 Ambassador Huang Hua's comments on US attempts to
 link the "completely irrelevant" South Korean
 application with those of the two Vietnams.
 According to the NCNA account, Huang said
 that China "cannot but express regret" at US
 attempts to make a "package deal" and suggested
 that the US, as a result, would "only land itself
 in greater isolation."   Huang's sorrowful rather
 than angry criticism of US support for South Korea
 was considerably less harsh than the language
 he employed last year during UN debate on the Korea
 issue.
 The Chinese have also displayed a degree of
 selectivity in their support for the pro-Pyongyang
 draft resolution that was announced last week.
 On August 12, NCNA ran a summarized version of a
 North Korean statement on the resolution.   Peking's
 summary deleted most of Pyongyang's arguments for
 removing US troops from the South and for replacing
 the armistice commission with a peace treaty between
 the "real parties," a reference to North Korea and
 the US.  The deletions point up Peking's interest
 in softening criticism of the US and, probably,
 in retaining some form of armistice guarantees.
 In fact, the possibility of a lapse in the
 armistice arrangements has concerned the Chinese
 for some time.
 Chinese media have also softened Pyongyang's
 harsh criticism of the pro-Seoul resolution
 introduced last month by the US and others.

 As they have for some time, the Chinese are
 walking a narrow path between their strategic
 objectives on the Korean Peninsula and their
 desire to maintain the warmest possible ties with
 Pyongyang.   From Peking's viewpoint, there is
 undoubtedly some advantage to a continuation, at.
 least for the time being, of a divided Korea and
 a strong US presence in the South.   Chinese
 leaders are probably persuaded that a dissolution
 of the UN Command that neglects provisions for an
 alternative peace-keeping mechanism could disrupt
 the status quo and lead to a scramble for influence
 in Korea.
 If early estimates of the outcome on the UN
 Korea vote this year are correct, both resolutions
 will be approved.  Neither, however, is likely to
 be implemented soon.   Peking almost certainly will
 be pleased with that development, since it would
 probably result in no major changes in the Korean
 situation.  F7                  I

 The Reappearance of Lo Jui-ching
 Christopher J.  Szymanski  (x20616)
 Bureau of Intelligence and Research
 Department of State
 The attendance of Lo Jui-ching, formerly PLA
 chief of staff, vice premier, and high party offic-
 ial,,at the Army Day celebrations in Peking on July
 31 is the most startling reappearance of a Cultural
 Revolution purge victim since that of Teng Hsiao-
 ping in the spring of 1973.   Purged in late 1965, Lo
 reportedly tried to commit suicide following Red
 Guard harassment and heavy press criticism that linked
 him with the disgraced Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping.
 The story behind Lo's purge has never fully
 emerged, but the likeliest explanation is that his
 emphasis on defense preparedness and professionalism
 in the army came into conflict with the Mao - Lin
 Piao emphasis on guerrilla warfare and political in-
 volvement.  His reappearance would thus indicate a
 further step in the PLA's disengagement from domestic
 politics, a step that was instituted after Lin's
 abortive coup attempt in 1971.
 Lo's current state of health is unknown, but
 since he is about 70 years old his future role may
 prove more symbolic than substantive.  On the other
 hand, past ceremonial appearances of those purged
 during the Cultural Revolution have often preceded
 their reappointment to major positions, and Lo may
 be slotted for a substantive job high in the mili-
 tary hierarchy.
 Lo in 1965:   The escalation of the Vietnam war
 in 1965 confronted Peking with strategic problems:
 how to assist Hanoi; whether China might be invaded;
 how China should defend itself.   Two answers surfaced
 publicly--one by Lo, the other by Lin Piao.

 In an article in Red Flag in may 1965 commem-
 orating the defeat of Germany in World War II, Lo
 advocated primary reliance on professional military
 methods:
 --preparations against the eventuality
 that "imperialism may suddenly impose
 a war on us" should include planning
 not only for small- and medium-scale
 warfare but also for large-scale war-
 fare, including nuclear weapons;
 --China should adopt a strategy of "active
 defense," concentrating superior forces
 to destroy the "enemy's effectives";
 --victory requires close integration of
 the armed forces and the civilian popula-
 tion, coordination on the battlefield,
 and close cooperation among the different
 armed services, the ground forces being
 primary.
 Lo apparently further maintained that China should:
 --prepare to resist invasion, even if this
 would divert the PLA from domestic polit-
 ical activities;
 --rely more heavily on regular ground
 forces, particularly the infantry rather
 than local militia units;
 --prepare defense positions and rapidly
 improve air defenses in the south
 against a possible US air strike;
 --greatly increase allocation of resources
 to the defense sector.
 Lo's military views, although apparently widely
 accepted within the Chinese military, were in direct

 opposition to Mao's and Lin's advocacy of a polit-
 ically active PLA and primary reliance on a guer-
 rilla defense strategy.   In a September 1965 article,
 "Long Live the People's War," which attracted wide
 attention, Lin argued that, as had been the case in
 the Chinese revolution, the Third World "countryside"
 would surround and overcome the developed "cities."
 Lin's principal point was that in Vietnam, China,
 and the Third World countries Peking and its allies
 should rely mainly on guerrilla warfare rather than
 attempt to engage in modern technological warfare.
 To meet the enemy on his own terms was foolish, he
 argued.
 Lo had also castigated "US imperialism," but
 his foreign policy stance seems to have accorded
 with the general position of the central leadership
 at the time.   In retrospect, it appears unlikely that
 his position centered on an active anti-American
 stand or that he had pro-Soviet leanings.  Rather,
 his purge in late 1965 was probably the result of
 major differences in military doctrine with the Mao-
 Lin group.
 Lo in 1975.   Lo's advocacy in 1965 of heavier
 defense allocations took place at a time when Peking
 perceived a heightened military threat from the US.
 He may well hold different views today, when that
 danger is no longer perceived, and when stepped-up
 defense efforts might conflict with the present
 emphasis on developing China into a "modern, in-
 dustrialized socialist state" by the end of the
 century.  Chou En-lai proclaimed this goal at the
 Fourth National People's Congress last January.
 In other ways, Lo's 1965 views conform to
 several aspects of Peking's current policy.   His
 argument that the PLA should give primacy to its
 purely military functions accords with Peking's
 steady efforts since the fall of Lin Piao in 1971
 to get the armed forces out of civilian political

 and economic activity.   Further, his stress on mili-
 tary professionalism--carrying the implication that
 technical training is important and that politicization
 should not be overstressed--parallels the current
 "rational" emphasis in Chinese economic planning.
 In sum, Lo's rehabilitation may be another
 step in the gradual strengthening of the "moderates"
 at the expense of the "leftists" which has occurred
 since Lin's fall.

 Army Day in the Provinces
 Army Day turnouts were marked by the unexpected
 absence of leading military district (MD) personnel.
 While eight of the eleven military region commanders
 publicly appeared in their provinces, only two mili-
 tary district-level commanders, from Kwangtung District
 and Peking Garrison, appeared in place.  The appear-
 ance of some military district personnel outside
 their home provinces and the recent appointment of
 a new MD commander and political commissar in Chekiang
 suggest that a shift in military personnel at the
 district level may be under way.
 All of the transferred personnel also held
 party positions in their home provinces--Yang Ta-i,
 who appeared in Liaoning, was formerly MD commander
 and party secretary in Hunan, while Ho Kuang-yu,
 the new MD commander in Kansu, was a deputy party
 secretary and MD commander in Kweichow.  Several
 other lower level MD personnel who previously held
 party posts were among the other military men
 transferred.
 The major shift, however, was the transfer of
 Wang Chia-tao to Liaoning where he appeared sixteenth
 on the turnout list.   Wang, who has not appeared in
 Heilungkiang since 1974,  lost his posts as first
 party secretary and MD commander in the transfer.
 Turnouts this year were rather large, with most
 provinces holding simultaneous rallies in several
 locations.  Provincial party leaders were conspic-
 uously present, and in most cases the leading party
 representative delivered the keynote address.

 Signs of Indecision
 Although Peking seems to be dealing forcefully
 and effectively with major issues such as the
 military and the economy, there appears to be some
 confusion or hesitation over how to handle a few
 lesser issues.
 On Army Day, NCNA in an English-language broad-
 cast identified party leader Wang Hung-wen as a
 vice chairman of the party's Military Affairs Com-
 mittee, an unusual position for a civilian.   Teng
 Hsiao-ping, the only other civilian known to be a
 vice chairman of the committee, has never been
 publicly identified as such.  Even more unusual,
 subsequent broadcasts and publications failed to
 mention Wang's military title.
 What prompted Peking to switch is a mystery.
 The outside world learned of Wang's new title through
 the initial release, and rumors of his new position
 had circulated within China for some time.
 Last March, Peking announced the conclusion of
 preparatory meetings for the national congresses
 of China's mass organizations--the Women's Federa-
 tion, Trade Union, and Youth League.   The announce-
 ment indicated that the congresses themselves would
 be held after "due preparations," and some provinces
 began to select delegates.  This process came to a
 sudden halt, however, and no further preparations
 seem to be under way.
 The congresses could have been pushed to the
 back burner by the meeting this summer of party
 and military leaders in Peking, but that meeting is
 now over.  Factionalism in the provinces may also
 be contributing to the delay, as well as the major
 economic push throughout the country.  Both fac-
 tionalism and the emphasis on the economy, however,

 were facts of life when the preparatory meetings
 were held last winter.   It is now an open question
 whether preparations for the congresses can be com-
 pleted this year.
 25X1A
 (\J
 A third development is Peking's apparent back-
 pedaling on conversion to the Pinyin system, China's
 own method for Romanizing Chinese names.  A State
 Council message announcing that China would convert
 to the Pinyin system on September 1 was prepared for
 release last May.  Within hours, however, NCNA was
 told to delay indefinitely the release of the mes-
 sage.   It is clear that the Chinese had second
 thoughts about adopting the Pinyin system.
 To date, Chinese officials have been unable to
 confirm that the system would go into effect on
 September 1.   In fact, several officials have been
 vague about whether the system will ever be adopted.

 Military Notes
 1                        -1
 The Army Day turnout in Peking indicates that
 the PLA has become increasingly conscious of the
 technical and doctrinal aspects of warfare.  The
 two most heavily represented PLA groups were the
 National Defense Science and Technology Commission
 and the military academies.  The ranks of both the
 commission and the academies have increased signif-
 icantly in the past two years.  Although some of
 the rise represents no more than the filling of
 slots vacant since the Cultural Revolution, the
 number of leaders in these two categories identified
 during national celebrations now dwarfs the other
 military groups.
 The namelist further suggests that the commission
 'has a new head.   Liu Hsien-chuan, former Tsinghai
 ~~  leader who has appeared in Peking for the past
 ,Iseveral years, did not head the commission group.
 Chang Ai-ping, a veteran Science and Technology Com-
 mission official, won this distinction.  Liu may
 have been transferred to Shantung.  A poorly heard
 radiobroadcast listed a person whose name sounded
 .like Liu's as a deputy commander of the Tsinan
 Military Region in May.
 The academy bloc now includes notables such
 as Hsiao Hua, a former head of the PLA's General
 `Political Department, and Chang I-hsiang, who used
 to head the Railway Engineering Corps.

 A Line on Chang Chun-chiao
 Chang Chun-chiao is one of the few Chinese
 leaders with important positions in the party,
 government, and military bureaucracies.  His mili-
 tary duties as chief political commissar respon-
 sible for political indoctrination of the troops
 are fairly clear.  His precise party and govern-
 ment responsibilities are less clear, but scattered
 bits of information allow for some tentative
 judgments.

 Chang has long seeme
 member in charge of liaison with foreign communist
 parties, and he appears to continue these duties.
 In addition, as a vice premier in the government
 his responsibilities in foreign affairs appear to
 have broadened to include the non-communist world
 as well.   He recently hosted the Tunisian prime
 minister and the President of Gabon.
 Last month, accompanied by the minister of
 culture, Chang met with two cultural delegations,
 suggesting he may be moving in on Chiang Ching's
 turf.    In addition, he met a press delegation.
 Taken together, these appearances suggest he has
 important propaganda responsibilities on behalf of
 both party and government.
 The party and government have separate propa-
 ganda vehicles, but all are controlled ultimately
 by the party.  There is some evidence that links

 uin June, Lu Ying, w o worked on t e Shanghai
 newspaper Liberation Daily when Chang headed the
 paper, was identified as "chief leading member"
 of People's Daily, suggesting that Chang's presumed
 protege is editor-in-chief of the party's official
 newspaper.
 Given Chang's party position as a member of
 the Politburo's elite Standing Committee, he appears
 to be the highest ranking party official with
 propaganda responsibilities. Yao Wen-yuan also
 appears to be involved in propaganda work, but he
 is outranked by Chang and would have to defer to
 him.   Moreover, the government's propaganda outlet,
 the New China News Agency, would also come under
 Chang's purview.
 Propaganda work would seem to mesh well with
 Chang's other duties.   Since he is charged with
 setting out the correct party line for the military,
 it seems logical for him to do the same for the
 party and government media.
 This is not to suggest that Chang's duties
 tare restricted to propaganda work.  He still seems,
 for example, to be the most likely candidate for
 party secretary general.   Propaganda duties, how-
 lever, would give Chang considerable stature as a
 party theoretician, a comfortable position to be in
 iwhen succession time roles around.

 Fertilizer Production Behind Schedule
 25X1
 25X1A
 China is behind schedule in production of
 chemical fertilizer.  Peking expected output to
 be 35 million tons in 1975, the last year of the
 fourth five-year plan, but production will reach
 only about 80 percent of this goal unless it is
 increased dramatically during the remainder of the
 year.  Any boost in output would be too late for
 use on this year's principal crops.
 Fertilizer production got off to a good start
 early in the current plan period.  Output--mostly
 from the rapid expansion of small plants--increased
 from 18 to 25 percent annually during the early
 1970s.  This spectacular rate of increase could
 not be sustained, and only a minimal gain was
 achieved in 1974.   Recent announcements by Peking
 indicate that the increase this year will fall far
 short of the additional 10 million tons needed to
 meet its goal.
 China's fertilizer imports have also lagged.
 Imports last year were reduced by one third be-
 cause of skyrocketing prices and Peking's shortage
 of foreign exchange.  Purchases were cut back even
 more during the first half of this year.   Peking
 has recently signed, or is negotiating, new con-
 tracts in response to falling fertilizer prices.
 Much of this fertilizer, however, will be delivered
 too late for use this crop year.
 More high-quality chemical fertilizer will be
 required to support any substantial increase in
 agricultural output.   The supply situation will
 not ease, however, until the 13 nitrogen fertilizer
 plants purchased from the West become fully opera-
 tional in the late 1970s.  Until then, Peking will
 look to more intensive utilization of organic mate-
 rials'to ease the current shortages of chemical

 Early PRC Container Service Problems
 Peking's first attempt at containerization has
 pointed out deficiencies in China's internal trans-
 port system.  The joint Sino-Japanese container
 service was inaugurated in September 1973 and ex-
 panded during the last half of 1974.  Vessels in
 this trade call at Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe in
 Japan and at Tientsin and Shanghai in China.
 China lacks the specialized equipment and
 internal transport network needed to use the con-
 tainer service efficiently.  The Chinese do not have
 proper handling equipment so that they must rely on
 ships' cranes and forklift trucks to move containers
 in port areas.  Cargoes are consolidated at the ports,
 and often only a fraction of the container's capacity
 is used because of inexperience in managing containers.
 Low clearance along China's rail and highway networks
 further reduces the benefits of containerization.
 Improvements in the system and those scheduled
 for the next five year plan should alleviate the
 problems.  The Chinese are equipping port facilities
 at Shanghai, Tientsin, and possibly Canton for
 handling small numbers of containers.  The installa-
 tions at Shanghai and Tientsin--two of China's major
 ports--will use specialized container-handling equip-
 ment, some of it manufactured in Japan and the US.
 Containership berths may be available at these two
 ports by the end of this year.

 Nine of China's eleven regional military com-
 randers have reappeared since Army Day, despite
 the apparent determination of Chairman Mao to
 send several of these men into political disgrace.
 The showdown apparently took place at a meeting
 in Peking earlier this summer.   It seems that the
 rest of the leadership set Mao's wishes aside in
 the face of several compelling reasons for taking
 !the pressure off the military commanders.
 Not the least of these is the elusive unity
 that the Chinese have tried to achieve for the
 past year.  The removal of some of the commanders,
 especially those who sit on the party's ruling
 politburo, would imply that the leadership remained
 divided even as Peking was taking firm measures
 to put a sto  to "bourgeois factionalism" in the
 rovinces.
 n article in the
 Curren  issue o    e     ag warns that party com-
 mittees cannot lead "hundreds of thousands" of
 people unless the members of the committees are
 united.  This warning applies equally as well to

 crucial for Peking to maintain good relations with
 this group.  As the recent events in troubled
 Chekiang Province have shown, the military remains
 an important instrument.for maintaining order.
 The decision to send troops into Chekiang's
 factories to restore order and get production mov-
 ing again was taken only after a series of other
 measures were unsuccessful.
 Chekiang's problems, although more explosive
 and more persistent than in other areas, are
 basically not very different from the kinds of
 factional rivalries that exist in other provinces.
 It is therefore conceivable that similar distur-
 bances could flare up in other provinces if Peking
 does not use a firm hand in Chekiang as an example.
 The cooperation of the military has been essential
 and could be needed again.  Peking would not want
 to risk alienating the military by purging com-
 These arguments, which may well have been made
 on behalf of the commanders during the meeting in
 ;Peking this summer, probably cut no ice with Mao.
 The Chairman seems to have a personal interest in
 ,discrediting the commanders, an interest that
 ,,reflects directly on his prestige.
 A case in point is where to put the blame for
 former Defense Minister Lin Piao's accumulation of
 power.   If the commanders cannot be held responsible,
 and therefore deserving of punishment, then the
 lion's share of the guilt rests with the man who
 named Lin defense minister, and that is Mao.  The
 attacks on the commanders for being supporters of
 Lin have long served to deflect public attention
 from Mao's own close association with his now-
 disgraced former heir.  Letting the commanders off
 the hook on the pro-Lin charge is not at all in
 Mao's interest.
 There probably is an element of vendetta in
 lMao's apparent hostility toward the commanders.

 These men clamped down hard on Mao's Red Guards
 during the Cultural Revolution.  Although he may
 have been persuaded at the time that such moves were
 necessary, Mao has been blamed for the instability
 that has grown out of the Cultural Revolution, and
 .each rehabilitation of a Cultural Revolution
 victim is a further repudiation of the entire
 movement,  At this r)c)Jnf-.1
 ---[Mao cannot hope to justify
 tnat episode.        e could gain a measure of personal
 satisfaction, however, by seeing some of the com-
 manders removed from office.
 Finally, there is the issue of Mao's personal
 control over the military.  As party chairman,
 Mao is the titular commander in chief of the PLA,
 but he has apparently argued that he should have
 real control.  A June 7 People's Daily article
 seemed to set out the Chairman's position.  The
 article, using historical analogy, claimed that
 political and military power must be concentrated
 in the hands of "the supreme representative of the
 central political organs."  Reinforcing this notion
 of one-man rule, the article noted that the
 "supreme representative" was a specific individual.
 The article concluded that history had vindicated
 the Legalist approach that soldiers must "obey
 orders without question," and went on to quote an
 ancient Legalist who wrote that "soldiers must not
 have private friends."  In the current context, this
 could have been a complaint by Mao that the military
 sought allies among other civilians in the leader-
 ship in an attempt to escape Mao's wrath.
 A response to the People's Daily article seems
 to have been carried in the PRC-controlled Hong
 Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao on June 30.  The article
 is not known to have been carried in any national
 mass circulation publication inside China, sug-
 gesting that it touched some very sensitive nerves.

 The delicate point may well be the comparison of
 the Confucian and Legalist methods for controlling
 the army that seems to be a clear reversal of the
 position taken by People's Daily.
 In the view of Ta Kung Pao--which has followed
 a consistent "Chouist" line--the notion that "the
 ;king's wish was law and his words were decrees
 ;which must be obeyed without question" was the
 Confucian, i.e., wrong, view of how to control
 the military.  The correct line was that advocated
 by the Legalists, who argued that the armed forces
 should be controlled through the "rule of law."
 The "rule of law" seems a clear repudiation of the
 People's Daily argument for one-man rule.
 The Defense Ministry banquet on the occasion
 of Army Day provided another indicator of Mao's
 current status vis-a-vis the military.  The NCNA
 account of the banquet referred to Mao as the
 founder and commander of the army, but this accolade
 was not repeated by Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying
 in his actual remarks at the banquet.
 The issue of who is credited with command of
 the army is, of course, a particularly sensitive
 one given the history of the Lin Piao affair.   Lin
 was accused of trying to usurp command from Mao.
 Until his fall in 1971, Lin was cited as directly
 commanding the PLA while Mao was acknowledged as
 the founder.   In 1972, Mao was referred to as the
 founder and commander of the PLA in the media and
 in Yeh Chien-ying's speech at the Defense Ministry
 banquet.  The same formulation was followed in 1973.
 In 1974, there was an obvious change that
 seemed to be in accord with Mao's declining influ-
 ence over military affairs.  By this time, the
 Chairman had left Peking after his efforts to
 continue the anti-Confucius campaign against the
 regional commanders had been rebuffed.   Both Yeh's

 toast and the NCNA account referred to Mao only
 as the great leader of the Chinese people.   Thus
 Mao's treatment in the media on Army Day this year
 is better than last, but well short of his previous
 high.   This formulation is a tacit admission
 that the Chairman's apparent effort earlier this
 summer to establish his personal control of the
 military and influence the fate of the regional
 commanders did not succeed.
 25X1A
 Taken together, it seems that despite his
 failing health, Mao is able to assert himself on
 issues that are important to him.  Clearly, the
 status of the regional military commanders is one
 such issue.   Had it not been for Mao's personal
 interest in resolving this issue, it is entirely
 possible that the party would not have called the
 commanders to Peking this summer.  Considerations
 more important than Mao's personal views enabled
 the commanders to remain in office. This was a
 loss for Mao but a victory for unit  and stability.
