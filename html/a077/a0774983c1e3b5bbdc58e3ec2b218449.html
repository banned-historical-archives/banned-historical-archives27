 Intelligence Activities
 DANIEL                SCHORR:     Our       subject  today   is,   generally,
 intelligence activities,  which is not always  the same as             saying
 intelligent       activities. And some of the activities,  I suspect,
 will play some part in the Reagan-Mondale debate tomorrow              night.
 So I thought it'd be interesting to go into them today.
 We have assembled for that purpose three persons who are
 expert  in  these activities.   I  suspect  their views may differ
 some.   The first is Ray Cline, a  former Deputy Director  of  the
 CIA.    Admiral Stansfield Turner% who was the Director of the CIA
 in the Carter Administration.   And  in New York,  we have Repre-
 sentative Tom Downey,  who has followed these episodes carefully
 and has views of his own on them.
 Welcome to you all, gentlemen.
 Question first of all to you,  Admiral  Turner.   Here we
 have  this manual  which  the White House said was  written by  a
 contract employee, wasn't really authorized,  and is beginning  to
 take  its  distance from this manual  which talked about ways and
 possibilities of assassination,  even of creating  a martyr here
 and there by murdering one of their own Contras, and so on and so
 forth.   Is it conceivable,  from your knowledge  of the CIA, that
 activity like that could be completely out of control?   And if it
 was out of control, what does that say for the agency?
 ADMIRAL  STANSFIELD TURNER:   The ironic thing, Dan, is
 that 8 1/2 years     ago President Ford,  on the  recommendation of
 then-Director of the CIA George Bush, put out an order that said
 nobody will think  about or  conspire to  conduct   assassination.
 Now here  the CIA,  through  one  of  its  temporary  employees, has
 issued a pamphlet which certainly can be interpreted in that way.

 You  can  interpret  it  lots  of  ways.    But  a  peasant  down  in
 Nicaragua reading this would have very little question about  it,
 and  the  President  of  the  United  States   has  had  very  little
 question about what it means   because he's had     an investigation
 started to see why somebody did this.
 It  appeas to me that -- certainly,  I would think George
 Bush doesn't want assassination.   He originated this idea.   So,  I
 think the situation is     out of control.   Either the headquarters
 in Washington of the CIA doesn't have control of these people out
 in  the  field,  or the White House doesn't have  control        of the
 headquarters of the CIA.   I don't know which.
 SCHORR: Well,  the question is,  is it conceivable that
 an employee in contact with the Contras, who are being funded and
 supported by the CIA,  is in the position to write a document and
 hand  it    to  them  which has  not  gone  through  the  very careful
 process     that you would think these things would go through?      And
 if  it  is  conceivable,  what  does    it say  about  the CIA  and  the
 whole control of that operation?
 ADMIRAL   TURNER:   It's conceivable, but I don't know how
 much they've loosened the controls  out       there  in the  last 3  1/2
 years.      Certainly a good bit,  from what one understands.   And it
 should not be that way.    Something like this      should not  get  out
 without     approval  of somebody other than a contract employee who
 happened to think this was a good idea,  and seems to have been        a
 Rip Van Winkle for the last 8 1/2 years.
 SCHORR:   Ray Cline?
 RAY  CLINE:   I find it very hard to take this particular
 document very seriously, Dan.   I've read it all.   It's old Ho Chi
 Minh,  Mao Tse-tung      rhetoric.   It's mostly  about how to build
 camps and how to set sentinels,  and so on.
 These   few  phrases which  have  been  played  up  were
 obviously  left     in,  unfortunately, from  the American point  of
 view.   But  the document is  a document that someone provided to
 the Contras in Nicaragua,   who are  indeed   engaged  in guerrilla
 warfare.   And  as  the document says,  it may be necessary to kill
 people.
 Now,  that  doesn't  really shock me if they're trying to
 force the Nicaraguan government to change    its  personnel  and  its
 policies.   And  I  don't  imagine it  will  turn out  that the CIA,
 which is supporting very  indirectly,    or  was,  according  to  the
 press  and the Congress,  supporting the Contras with money for a
 time,  will turn    out  to have     had very much to  do  with  this
 particular document.

 SCHORR:   Congressman Downey,  let me turn this question
 to  you,     but  let me add  a question.  If you were advising  Mr.
 Mondale     on this issue for the debate tomorrow night, which maybe
 you are,     for all I know, how would you advise him to handle this
 and how would you advise him to put it to President Reagan?
 REP. TOM DOWNEY:   Well,  I think that Admiral Turner gave
 us  a     pretty  good  indication   of  one of  the  direction  of  the
 questioning that Mr. Mondale might make to       the President. It's
 clear         to me  that  if Mr.  Casey knew about this,  then potentially
 others in the Administration should have         known,     did  they know?
 If Mr. Casey didn't know, why didn't he know?
 The CIA is,  after     all,  the world's most sophisticated
 information-gathering agency  in the world.   The work that they
 are doing  in Nicaragua  is  something  that  I suspect  gets       very
 careful      and close scrutiny  because  it is in  the news  all    the
 time.         To suggest for a moment that the agency was unaware of the
 production of this heinous document is,  frankly,  unbelievable to
 So,  I would raise it in that context for Mr. Mondale.
 Mr. Cline makes a very  excellent  point. He said      that
 this  is much  more  in keeping with     the ideology of Ho Chi Minh,
 Stalin,  Muammar Qaddafi,  or  Idi  Amin.   It  is  not  the work     of
 Jefferson,  Madison, or Lincoln.    And those are the people who we
 are the traditional followers of.   And it  seems   to me  that  in  a
 democracy we should not be trying to play the tyrant to deal with
 tyranny.   And that is,  in fact,  what we're doing.
 So,  I think this document has profound repercussions for
 U.S.     foreign policy.   I think it makes it much more difficult for
 us in the United States to say,    "Well,  we abhor terrorism," as we
 do, when in fact an agency  of  the United States Government has
 produced a manual like this.
 SCHORR:   Let me turn to both of you gentlemen with this
 question.   Both  Mondale and  Speaker of the  House  Thomas  "Tip"
 O'Neill have demanded the resignation of Director William Casey.
 In fact,     sometimes, whenever something like this happens,  they --
 the first thing they say is demand the ouster of Casey for having
 -- but let met pose this question to you...
 CLINE:   They  say  demand --  they  demand the ouster of
 Casey before they find out what the incident is,  as in this case,
 usually.
 SCHORR:  But isn't he responsible?   And if he's respons-
 ible,  is it fair to ask...
 CLINE:   But do any of the three of us know what happened

 Approved For Release 2010/01/06: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000301410007-4
 with this document?   Or does Tip O'Neill know? I don't.
 ADMIRAL TURNER:   I think Ray is right.   We can't condemn
 Mr.  Casey until he's been tried -- that is,  until the  investiga-
 tion has been completed.   But  if Mr.  Casey  believes  what Mr.
 Cline has said just a minute  ago,  he ought  to be  fired.   Cline
 said  there's  nothing wrong with killing a few people. The only
 thing wrong with      it, unless you're in a combat situation, is that
 the President of the United States has a written order that says
 you won't do that kind of thing.
 CLINE:   Now look, Stan...
 ADMIRAL   TURNER:   If Mr. Cline doesn't want to obey with
 that order,  that's his business.   But it's not...
 CLINE:   You're misquoting me,  as well as Mr. Casey.
 ADMIRAL TURNER:    No,  I'm not.   You said it didn't bother
 you at all that there was...
 CLINE:   That there was in the Contra organization, which
 is  a     guerrilla   army  fighting  in  Nicaragua,    a  manual  telling
 guerrillas how        to protect themselves and how to conduct psycho-
 logical operations.
 ADMIRAL   TURNER:    Ah,  but  that's  not  the phrase we're
 talking about.        The phrase is the one that tells them how to take
 care             of  judges, who  are  not  combat people. It says how  you
 eliminate judges...
 CLINE:   Neutralize them,     yeah.   And  you know that you
 neutralize people,                often, by revealing their past record.
 I doubt -- I do not think...
 ADMIRAL TURNER:            Oh,  that is a joke.
 SCHORR:               Do  you  mean  expose these  judges  in  these
 newspapers?      Is that the...
 CLINE:   To the people.             Read the document. It says call
 a public meeting and neutralize these people,                insuring  that  the
 people of the village approve of it.
 SCHORR:   I hate to interrupt this spirited -- Tom, hold
 on a minute.   Everybody, hold on.   You'll get your chance when we
 come back.
 SCHORR:  We had to interrupt a spirited discussion of

 Approved For Release 2010/01/06: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000301410007-4
 that famous,  now famous manual for the Contras in Nicaragua.   Let
 me say where we are,  briefly:   that  there's  some   disagreement
 about how serious  a matter it is, some disagreement about where
 the authority for it lies and what should be done about it next.
 Let's turn now to New York and Congressman Downey.
 REP. DOWNEY:   Well,  the point I  wanted to make before,
 Dan -- and  it's one  that Mr. Cline made -- is that part of this
 manual is guerrilla boilerplate,  but part  of  it  is  just  objec-
 tionable.                          Indeed,  Edgar Chammoro,  who was responsible for the
 publication and distribution of the manual, found it so offensive
 that he had to delete portions of it.
 And I just want to read one very quick paragraph of what
 it says,    because this is the portion that offends me, and I think
 should  offend  all  Americans:   "When the uprising occurs, pro-
 fessional criminals should be hired to carry out selective  jobs,
 such as taking the demonstrators to a confrontation with authori-
 ties, to bring about uprising and shootings  that  will  cause the
 death of one or more people to create a martyr for the cause."
 I don't think the United States should be  involved in
 telling people to behave this way.
 SCHORR:   Well,  the question is to what extent the United
 States is involved.
 REP. DOWNEY:   Yeah.
 CLINE:    I  don't think they were involved. I think that
 probably what really happened,  if anybody  would be honest     about
 this  and  not conduct a kangaroo court of Bill Casey and the CIA,
 is  the Contras,      who  are fighting a guerrilla war,  said,  "For
 heaven sakes, give us some of the classical material on it so we
 can show our soldiers what to do."   And I don't know who    it  came
 from.   But whoever  it  came  from gave them pretty much an old-
 fashioned  Leninist  document.    It  says  in  it,  "This  is                           for
 Christianity and democracy."   It's got a lot of good terms thrown
 in in place of Marxist terms.   But  it didn't excise the      things
 that Chammoro is objecting to.   They probably should have.   If he
 tore them out,  then there isn't even any real problem.
 SCHORR:   But  if this thing  is also harmless, why does
 the White House say, why does the White House act indignant about
 it  and say,   "This  does  not  represent  the policy  of the United
 States.   We're going to launch two investigations to find out who
 was responsible and how it happened."
 CLINE: Because the kangaroo court is charging that Bill
 Casey...

 SCHORR:   The kangaroo court in the White House?
 CLINE:   ...authorized -- no,  in the Congress.   And  if  I
 may say so...
 SCHORR:   The Congress?   There is no Congress right now.
 CLINE:   Dan, oh, come on.   The congressmen  are  leading
 hte charge. And you know that document was released to the AP by
 some congressman.      It couldn't have come from any place else.
 But   besides  that,  let me finish the thought.   The real
 issue is whether CIA or Bill Casey or the President authorized or
 instructed somebody to violate their own guidelines of committing
 an assassination.
 SCHORR:   I suggest to you that's only...
 CLINE:   And I say that's no.
 SCHORR:   You're going to be next, Tom.   But I just...
 CLINE:   No, there is no such authorization.
 SCHORR:    I  submit to you that's only half the question.
 Half the question is that somebody authorized.   The other half of
 the question is if nobody authorized, how do such things happen?
 CLINE:   How does what things happen?   The issuance,  the
 distribution in a document...
 SCHORR:    How do people on the payroll of the CIA, which
 is a pretty closely run agency, dealing in a delicate situation,
 in  a covert  operation  involving guerrillas trying to make their
 way into Nicaragua, where I think you know,  at least in your day,
 people didn't           go out there and  act  as rogue elephants,  in the
 famous phrase of Senator Church.
 CLINE: That's right.
 SCHORR:   You really try to keep control.   And if there
 isn't that control...
 CLINE:   I'm sure they do today and that this document is
 not proof to the contrary.   That's my position.
 SCHORR:   Tom Downey.
 REP.  DOWNEY:   Can  I  suggest  that  there  is a  broader
 question.    Part     of the reason that  the Congress  of the United
 States passed and the President signed into law in October a law

 forbidding military aid to the Contras is because of conflicting
 goals in foreign policy.   The Administration has  suggested       for
 some  time that    the goal of  aiding the Contras was to interdict
 arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador.
 Now,  it's  quite  clear  from  the  publication  of  this
 manual,     the  comic  books,  the   mining of  the  ports, and   the
 activities  of the Contras      that  they  are not just interested in
 interdicting     arms,  they   are  interested   in  overthrowing  the
 government of Nicaragua.   And that is the reason, when I wrote to
 Congressman Boland to ask him to      investigate this  issue --   and
 he's  Chairman of the House       Intelligence Committee -- he wrote
 back to me and he said,  "This  is    the  reason why  we cut  off the
 aid, because you cannot distinguish what the policy is."
 So it's not just a question of who's in control    and who
 isn't  in control.   The question  is,  what is the policy?   Do we
 believe that it is appropriate for us to overthrow the government
 of Nicaragua,  or  is it  just appropriate to try and prevent arms
 from going into El Salvador.
 CLINE: Let's   put  it  just a little more precisely.   Is
 it appropriate,  in order to prevent the export of revolution      and
 arms  to El  Salvador,  to support  a  counter-guerrilla movement
 which is trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government?
 ADMIRAL TURNER:    It   is not  appropriate  because  it's
 against the law.   The Boland Amendment specifically prohibits the
 CIA from doing anything to overthrow the government of Nicaragua.
 I think we should look at the broader issue before we...
 [Confusion of voices]
 SCHORR: ...enough  time for me to sort       of bring this
 part of the conversation to a close, which  I'll bring  to  a close
 by  recalling what  I  consider to be the ineffable words of James
 Angleton, who is the former Chief of Counterintelligence in the
 CIA.   When he  testified before the Church Committee at the time
 about how  it happened  that   the  CIA  had squirreled  away     some
 toxins,  although  President Nixon had signed a treaty which said
 they wouldn't squirrel away such things,  his  answer  was,  "It  is
 not  the custom  for  a  secret  agency   to  follow  the     publicly
 proclaimed policies of the President."
 Let's reflect on that for a minute while we take another
 break and come back and discuss more of this.
 SCHORR:   Let me move this on a little bit.   There's been

 Approved For Release 2010/01/06: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000301410007-4
 another     incident involving the CIA.   There's been a plane either
 has crashed or been brought down.   At least,      the guerrillas  now
 claim  that they  brought  it  down,  with   the  loss  of  four   CIA
 personnel.    Apparently,  it  was  engaged    in  trying  to  track a
 guerrilla plane carrying arms.
 Casey,  whose name has come up here before, is quoted as
 saying,     "Oh,  there's  certainly going  to be  a rumble tomorrow
 night over that."
 What is your reaction to that, Admiral Turner?
 ADMIRAL TURNER:   Well, I think that's a very unfortunate
 phrase for Mr. Casey to have used, if he really did use it.     This
 is a quote from Senator Goldwater  about  Mr.  Casey.   I   think we
 again ought to get the facts on this before we pass judgment.
 CLINE:   The key fact,  though,  is the plane came down in
 El  Salvador,  not  in  Nicaragua,  and  that  the  Vincaramos   (?)
 broadcasts are not  noted  for      their  accuracy.   As  soon as they
 hear of an American plane going down,      they say,  "We did it," just
 to build up their image.
 I  think you'll find    this  was a  reconnaissance flight
 along the border  and  it  crashed into  a mountain,       as  Mr. Casey
 said.
 SCHORR:   But  in political  terms,  Congressman Downey,
 here we have four     Americans lost.   There's  been  a lot  said by
 this   Administration  on  how  carefully   our  policies have  been
 conducted so that we don't lose Americans.   Is that likely     to be
 an issue?
 REP. DOWNEY:   Oh, I think it is.
 And  first, let me  just  offer  my  condolences  to the
 families    of   the Americans who were killed.  It is a tragedy for
 them.
 CLINE:   Yes, indeed.
 REP. DOWNEY:   And we shouldn't lose sight of that fact.
 There's no question that -- the  question of whether  or
 not  the War Powers Act comes into play here will be raised as an
 issue,  and it's something that I'm thinking about.   The committee
 was  aware, both  Intelligence  Committees  were    aware  of  these
 flight activities for a number of years they had been conducted.
 So this is very much different than what we were talking about in
 the case of Nicaragua,  where the manual,  the comic books,  and the
 mining  of the  ports  were not known to the committee     and not,
 frankly,    in my opinion,  justified.

 Yes,  this  will  be  a political issue,  but I don't think
 it carries the same impact,       frankly,  that  what is happening  in
 Nicaragua does.
 SCHORR:   There's  one other    issue  I  don't want to lose
 before we run out of time,  which  we will  pretty    soon,  and   that
 also  involves  intelligence,  and it       is Beirut.   The Washington
 Post this past week had a story saying  that        there was explicit
 information that the CIA had passed on indicating that there were
 explosives  had  been      brought into     Beirut,   targeted  against
 American  Embassy  personnel.   On  top  of that,      we now have the
 story -- very close to CNN in a way -- the wife of Jeremy        Levin,
 the missing bureau director of CNN in Beirut, said also that one
 of the people who is negotiating for her  gave        explicit warning,
 had  explicit warning from the group which may have been respons-
 ible for this that they were planning something between September
 20th  and the 22nd, and it happened on the 20th.   This may not be
 a failure of intelligence,  but may be a  failure  of  the  use of
 intelligence material.
 How do you react to it?
 ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Oh,  it certainly  is.   Whether or not
 there was this explicit warning from the CIA,     the preparations to
 defeat  a  truck bomb  against our  new embassy  were just totally
 inadequate.   Even just having the example  of    two  previous  truck
 bombs   in Beirut, they should have been much more alert than they
 were.   They didn't need this intelligence to have at     least  taken
 better precautions than they did.   It was totally indifferent to
 the lives of Americans.
 SCHORR:   Ray Cline?
 CLINE: Well, here's where we almost agree.
 ADMIRAL TURNER:   Good.
 CLINE:   It  was  not  an  intelligence problem.   There's
 plenty  of  intelligence      about  possible  future  incidents,  but
 probably  not  precise  enough  to pinpoint  a preparation,  as  is
 usually the case.
 But the issue before the authorities, I think, was: Were
 the embassy      people safer in West  Beirut,  which  was   literally
 getting out of control as a social instrument -- you can see that
 very  clearly       if  you  look  at  the television  pictures  of the
 Islamic     fundamentalist demonstrations,  even now -- or would they
 be safer  in          a  partially  finished embassy in another  area? I
 think  probably     the     wrong  decision  was  made. But      it  was a
 technical decision. It was not that they were indifferent to the
 lives  of our  people.        And I think that's another unfair allega-
 tion.

 ADMIRAL   TURNER:   Oh,  no,  no.   I didn't say the problem
 was moving...
 SCHORR:   I guess you don't almost agree.
 ADMIRAL TURNER:   ...from West to  East  Beirut.   I  won't
 quarrel with whether they should have moved or not.   I think only
 the people on the scene can determine that.   But in East    Beirut,
 where they were,      they  did not have  any kind of a simple proce-
 dure,  like putting a truck                       across  the  road, to prevent   a  truck
 bomb from coming      in.   That  was  absolutely a matter  of indif-
 ference,     a casualness,  a cavalierness that  should  not have                     been
 tolerated.
 CLINE:    It  certainly  should have been done.   That's
 where we agree.
 SCHORR:   Congressman Downey?
 REP.  DOWNEY:   Well, I agree with Admiral Turner. There
 is  no    question that we should have been forewarned,  with    the
 incidents     that happened in the past.   And frankly, their deaths,
 in my opinion,  are a great tragedy,  and in many ways,  I  believe,
 inexcusable.
 SCHORR:   Apparently,  now there's even indication that
 there may be plans being made between now and  the   election    for
 yet  another bombing.     Apparently,  it is known to intelligence,
 the intelligence community that there are enough explosives     left
 in  Beirut  for  another bombing.   We have now dependents     being
 moved out of Beirut.   I'm not quite sure whether this  looks   like
 standing tall.
 CLINE:     Dan,  if  we  could just talk  about  a  serious
 subject,  it is that there are going to be  lots  of  incidents  and
 more  Americans  are going    to be  killed. And  it  isn't  easy  to
 protect them.
 I  think, with  all  this  foreknowledge, when you see the
 climate of violence that exists in Lebanon  today,    stirred  up  in
 part         by the Syrians,  in part by  the  Iranians,  in  part by the
 Libyans,  in part by the Soviet Union itself, we are in a terrible
 situation.   We must take very strong measures and try to protect
 our people.
 SCHORR:   Tom Downey, we have about a half a minute left.
 I want to give that half-minute to you.
 REP.  DOWNEY:   Well,  I  think  that  anybody who has read
 the Long Commission report about the Marine bombing last year has
 to take a very,    very hard look at American policy in that region

 of the world.   As I stated before, both of the gentlemen in your
 Washington  studio  are  experts  on  intelligence  gathering  and
 information.   I think that we've seen some major failures in that
 operation.   But more importantly, I think we've made some major
 policy mistakes,  placing Marines  in Lebanon for the purpose of
 trying to be a peacekeeping force, and then having them shelled
 from the Shouf Mountains,  then getting all the intelligence about
 the fact that they are going to come under attack,  and do nothing
 about  it,   not  provide them the protection that they need.   This
 is a tragedy not just of the intelligence agency, but of American
 foreign policy in general.
 SCHORR:   I think we have run out of time....
