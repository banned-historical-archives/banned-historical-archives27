 MAO'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION":   ITS LEADERSHIP,
 ITS STRATEGY,  ITS INSTRUPMIENTS, AND ITS CASUALTIES
 This is a working paper of the DD/I Research Staff.
 It offers a fairly detailed narrative account of Mao Tse-
 tung's "cultural revolution" as it has developed since
 September 1965, a sunwiary of that account, and some specu-
 lation on prospects.
 This study presents what has been and remains in
 most respects a minority view,  the view of one "school."
 It finds the evidence persuasive for the propositions that
 (a) Mao has taken the initiative at each stage,  (b) he
 has been conducting a massive "test" of party leaders and
 the party apparatus,  (c) changes in the leadership have
 represented primarily a purge directed by Mao, and only
 secondarily a "power struggle," (d) the entire effort
 has developed coherently, given its irrational base in
 dogma, and (e) Mao is now carrying out methodically and
 in general successfully a scheme for the reorganization
 of the party which he outlined last autumn.
 Because a great deal of the most valuable material
 on each stage of the revolu-
 tion to date came to hand well after the fact
 the study
 ,
 presents developments both as they appeared at the time
 and as they looked when iurthe.r illuminated.  Not all of
 the facts are in yet, avid material still to be received
 may compel a change in some of the present conclusions.
 The DDI/R3 would welcome further comment on this
 working paper,  addressed to either the Chief or the Deputy

 MAO'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION":   ITS LEADERSHIP,
 ITS STRATEGY,  ITS INSTRUMENTS,  AND ITS CASUALTIES
 S'.unmary
 The "great proletarian cultural revolution" is
 said by Peking to have derived from a number of specific
 initiatives taken by Mao Tse-tung between autumn 1962 and
 autumn 1965.   While mo.; of these cannot be confirmed,
 the "revolution" from tine start has obviously been Mao's.
 It has grown out of concepts evident as far back as 1958,
 and in particular out of Mao's conviction--stated publicly
 and emphatically in mid-1964--of the urgency of the need
 for revolutionary successors whom he could trust to carry
 out his will.
 Mao's obsession with this need--and his consequent
 insistence on conducting a massive "test" and thorough
 purge of the Chinese party--has been the central,fact of
 the "revolution."  The revolution has not seemed to repre-
 sent a "power struggle" in the sense of a struggle for
 dominance in the leadership; the group around Mao,  and
 in particular Mao himself,  has been dominant in the lead-
 ership in all stages.   Mao's initiative in each of these
 stages has been confirmed by both open and clandestine
 materials.
 Changes in the composition of the group around
 Mao--changes coming sometimes thick and fast--have seemed
 to represent primarily changes in Mao's own evaluation
 of his lieutenants.   Some of the changes probably also
 reflect a contest for position, below Mao, among his
 lieutenants, looking toward an early succession.   While
 the purge did not begin with such a contest, and the con-
 test has been secondary all along to Mao's initiatives,
 this maneuvering for posit.-Lon is probably an increasingly
 important factor.

 Moreover, there has clearly been a struggle--which
 continues--against resistance to Mao's will on the part
 of the vast apparatus of the party,  the government and
 the military establishment, from the top level down.  While
 there is no declared opposition, this is a struggle to
 make the apparatus, both in the center and in the pro-
 vinces, fully responsive to Mao's new team.
 The First Test:  The "Poisonous Weed"
 The opening gun of the "revolution" was fired,
 article attacking a playwright whose earlier work~was -
 genuinely critical of Mao.   Mao apparently did not tell
 other party leaders--with a few exceptions--that he in-
 tended a particular anti-Mao play to serve as a test of
 ideology and loyalty for his entire "cultural" apparatus
 and for the highest leaders of the party machine which
 =supervised it.   In other words, Mao was making a major

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 initiative without providing clear guidance as to what
 response was desired, with the  intention of punishing
 those who made the wrong response.   He was probably de-
 termined from the start to purge Peng Chen, who had al-
 ready failed h _m as director of the "cultural." purge,
 and whose own Peking committee sheltered the attacked
 playwright and itself contained some writers who had
 bitterly criticized Mao.
 Immediately after the attack on the playwright
 appeared, Minister of Defense Lin Piao, who was being
 rapidly built up as the foremost and ideal student of
 Mao's thought,  issued a directive on the work of the PLA
 which stated the general criterion for the testing of
 party officials as well--whether they regarded the works
 of Mao as the "highest instructions" for their own work.
 Soon thereafter,  in late November 1965, Mao left Peking,
 to sketch or observe the development of the "cultural
 revolution," and possibly to undergo medical treatment.
 Lo Jui-cuing and Yang Sliang-kun, both in posts that made
 them dangerous,  disappeared at this time, probably arrested.
 At the same t .me, Lin Piao's PLA newspaper took the lead
 in defining the immediate "cultural" issue and forcing
 others to declare themselves--the question of whether
 the attacked playwright's work was a "poisonous weed"
 (the Maoist position) or a matter for debate (the "enemy"
 position).
 In mid-January 1966, Mao called together a few
 party leaders and his own wife (then a minor figure)--a
 group which later emerged as the "cultural revolution
 group" directing the campaign--to discuss the unsatis-
 factory situation, but he did not immediately replace the
 original group then operating under Peng Chen.   In Febru-
 ary, Peng issued a self-serving report on the cultural
 revolution in the name of the politburo--possibly approved
 by Liu Shao-chi,  in Mao's absence from Peking--aad he and
 Lu Ting-i did not act to bring the party press into line
 with the PLA newspaper on the issue of the "poisonous
 weed."  Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, the supervisors
 of both Peng and Lu, also failed to take this action.
 Unlike Peng and Lu, who could not afford to uncover a
 trail leading to themselves, Liu and Teng need not have

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 been consciously resisting what they took to be Mao's
 will in that period; while they may have been (if the
 charges of opposition to Mao in September 1965 are true),
 they may instead simply have failed to understand what
 he wanted, have lacked the illumination of his already-
 revealed "thought" and the revolutionary ardor which (in
 Mao's view) would have shown them the "correct" line
 without specific guidance.  While neither Liu nor Teng
 fell entirely out of Mao's favor at this time, and Teng
 may have gone on to play an important role its the purge
 of Peng Chen, the poor performance of the party press
 during the winter apparently created or strengthened Mao's
 reservations about Liu, and perhaps about Teng as well.
 Wall-poster assertions that some of Mao's lieutenants
 (not Liu and Tong) were plotting a "rebellion" or "coup"
 in February (during his absence) seem to be a deliberate
 corruption of a still-obscure but apparently minor inci-
 dent of that month.   In fact, there is no evidence of
 any important initiative by any of his lieutenants during
 that winter.
 In March, still in Mao's absence, Mao's wife began
 her spectacular rise to the top, working then--with Lin
 Piao--on the problem of the political reliability of the
 PLA.  Later in March, Peking announced that Mao was not
 ill--meaning, perhaps, that lie had recovered, possibly
 from an operation in February.  On the same day, Liu Shao-
 chi--who knew or suspected that his own status was now
 in question, as (it was later learned) he told someone
 so at the time--was sent abroad for a month,
 By the end of March, Mao was back in action, clearly
 in command.   lie intervened in the Ch.-L,ese party's negotia-
 tions with the Japanese party, peremptorily rejecting their
 draft communique and thus reversing several of his top
 lieutenants.  Peng Chen disappeared from sight at that
 time,  and the party press very quickly discovered that
 the work of the anti -Mao playwright was indeed a "poison-
 ous weed."  The party's Peking committee under Peng Chen
 tried to protect its own leaders by joining the attack
 on lesser figures, but Mao's spokesmen carried the attack
 in their direction.

 Preparing; the Ground:   The Conventional A
 ---- _.._ -_~__--                pparat us
 In early April, the PLA newspaper publicly forecast
 the course of the next several months--a wide-scale if
 not high-reaching purge.  The "cultural revolution" then
 began for the public in late April and May, with meetings
 and rallies of all elements of the population to denounce
 the "black gang" uncovered in Peking (the attacked play-
 wright and his friends on the Peking committee),  and to
 swear allegiance to Mao's thought.   Throughout this April-
 'fiay period, the conventional party apparatus under Liu
 and Teng, using conventional methods, was in charge of the
 conduct of the "cultural revolution".  Liu and Teng,
 given in effect another chance, seemed to be doing a
 good, routine job; there was nothing in the materials
 of the period to suggest that the party apparatus itself
 would be displaced by extraordinary vehicles in later
 stages.
 Mac reappeared near Shanghai in early May, looking
 good.
 At a party meeting late: in May,  Mao gave
 some further guidance--but again, apparently, unclear
 guidance--on the conduct of the "revolution'.'.
 Failure of the Apparatus:   The ;York-Teams
 With the ground prepared in April and May, on 1
 June the party began to move against the range of cultural
 and educational organizations and in particular ; gainst
 the educators,  the most important of whom were concur-
 rently secretaries of the party committees in their in-
 stitutions.  Liu and Teng, presumably on the basis of a
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 good performance in April and May, were still in charge
 of implementing the "revolution."  The instrument of the
 "revolution" in June---almost certainly approved by Mao
 in the May meeting--was the "work-team."  These small
 teams, which had been used before in the countryside,
 were named by higher party bodies and assigned to in-
 vestigate and reorganize educational and cultural bodies;
 the teams commonly followed or effectrd the removal of
 the principal administrators and party secretaries,  and
 took charge.
 With a tew exceptions, the work-teams failed to
 back the most militant elements on the campuses  (and
 elsewhere),  and in many cases suppressed them in the
 same ways as had the local party leaders whom the work-
 teams had dislodged.   The work-teams clearly did not
 have a directive to support such elements, and Liu Shao-
 chi and Teng Hsiao-ping have been principally blamed for
 this.  While Mao's spokesmen have encouraged the view that
 Liu and Teng were consciously sabotaging Mao's policy,
 and this may be true, the evidence is good that again
 they did not have a clear directive from Mao himself
 In other words, Mao had again set them a test, and again
 --whether deliberately, or from lack of understanding--
 they had failed to do what he wished, together w;th
 much of the party apparatus.
 Beginning at the end of June,  probably on Mao's
 initiative, there was intervention on the campuses by
 officers--including Mme. Mao--of what was soon to be
 revealed as the "group in charge of the cultural revolu-
 tion," plus the more prestigious and adroit Chou En-lai.
 These leaders apologized to the "revolutionary students"
 for the "mistakes" of the work-teams,  and backed the
 militants against the teams, which were withdrawn in the
 next month.
 The New Directorate and the New Directive
 For the rest of the summer,  Mao and the new figures
 in his favor were improvis.ng.   The new central "cultural
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 revolution group" under Chen Po-ta (Mao's long-time writer)
 was surfaced in u;arly July.   The new i::struments of the
 revolution,  immediately formed, were to be "revolutionary
 committees" responsive to the central group, chosen by
 election and directed to "give a free rein to the masses"
 (meaning the militants).   On the campuses,  these commit-
 tees initiated another a?.J longer period of at least parti-
 ally directed violence,  against "enemies" identified in
 the earlier stages.  Off the campuses, the "revolution"
 was also proceeding turbulently, although with less vio-
 lence and disruption of normal activity.
 In early August, Mao reportedly declared his favor
 directly--in a wall-poster--for the militant students.
 At the same time Chou En-lai and Mme. Mao both began to
 prepare the students--some already organized as Red
 Guards--for large-scale action against the party appara-
 tus, telling them not to dissipate their forces by fight-
 ing among themselves, but to concentrate them against
 enemies in the party.   Then on 8 August the party central
 committee--then in plenum--issued a 16-point directive for
 the conduct of the "revolution" in which militant exhorta-
 tions were foremost and which served to encourage the
 militant students who were soon to be turned loose on the
 party apparatus.
 The 8 August directive--the main lines of which
 were credibly attributed to Mao personally---stated the
 party's aim of bringing down the opponents of Mao's line
 in the party,  praised the revolutionary young, predicted
 "fairly strong" resistance, called for this to be attacked
 with "daring...above everything else," told the party not
 to fear "disorder," and stated that "all forces must be
 concentrated to strike" against the "main target...in the
 party."  It went on to classify all party officials ac-
 cording to their attitudes toward the revolution, warned
 them against counter-attacking the revolutionaries, and
 reassured them that they would not  be criticized by name
 in the press (i.e. officially condemned) without higher-
 level approval.   In sum,  the directive incited the revo-
 lutionary young against the party apparatus without pro-
 viding them with any clear criterion for distinguishing
 between those loyal to Mao's thought and those disloyal,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 while keeping in the party leadership's hands the later
 decision as to whom actually to purge.
 The Now Team and the Red Guards
 This party plenum which had produced the 16-point
 directive lasted through 12 August.  There is some evidence
 that a minority showed resistance in this plenum to Mao's
 plans for the further conduct of the revolution,  in
 particular the plan for the further subordination of the
 conventional party apparatus and for attacks on it by the
 Red Guards about to emerge.   Party spokesmen have implied
 that Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping led the resistance
 forces at the plenum,  but it is not clear whether they
 were in open opposition to Mao or (in defending themselves
 against charges) simply said things that were taken as
 open opposition because Mao was already determined to break
 them.   In any case,  Liu and Teng were demoted by the plenum
 (Teng, the junior, was not held responsible to  the same
 degree for the pair's "errors"), and Lin Piao was "un-
 animously" elected as the party's (sole) vice chairman.
 Lin addressed the plenum,  identifying himself completely
 with Mao, stating his favor for the militants,  announcing
 the new team's plans for reorganizing the party according
 to Mao's principles for the cultivation of revolutionary
 successors,  reiterating the team's intention to purge
 those who proved to be hard-case incorrigibles among
 party officials, and confiding his expectation of a long
 and hard struggle.
 On 13 August the central committee issued a com-
 munique on the plenum.   While certain differences between
 the party and the PLA press in commenting on the 8 August
 directive had suggested possible differences in degrees
 of militancy among members of the new team, the communique
 itself was thoroughly militant, reiterating the need for
 "daring" and for turning the masses loose.   Soon there-
 after, on 18 August, the Red Guards made their first ap-
 pearance at a rally which displayed Lin Piao publicly as
 Mao's new anointed successor.  The rally also displayed
 the rest of the new team (less Mme. Mao):   Chou En-lai

 as still third-ranking, Tao Chu (the new propaganda chief)
 and Chen Po-ta of the "cultural revolution group" newly
 risen to fourth and fifth,  Teng IIsiao-ping sixth but
 demoted among active leaders, Kang Sheng (the old police
 figure) risen to seventh,  aLid Liu Shao-chi down all the
 way from second to eighth.   Conunentaries immediately fol-
 lowing the 13 August rally suggested strong',  that a
 number of other party leaders would be brought down, in-
 cluding any who resisted the attacks of the Red Guards.
 The Unleashing of the Red Guards
 In the days following the rally, Chou Ln-lai and
 officers of the central "cultural revolution group" gave
 a number of interviews to the Red Guards, bypassing the
 conventional party apparatus which was about to be attacked.
 The Guards were told that they were free to organize them-
 selves any way they liked, and to say in their posters
 anything they liked.  They ware expressly incited against
 the party apparatus, but--as confirmed in many accounts
 of these briefings--they were not given specific targets,
 and were told repeatedly to sorve their problems (whom
 to attack, and how hard to attack) for themselves.   In
 other words, once again the instruments of the revolu-
 tion were set in motion without clear guidance.                       (This
 feature of the revolution--incredible to most Western
 observers--derives from Mao's conception of the process
 as a test of both the party officials being attacked and
 the attacking forces, a revolutionary "storm" in which
 potential revolutionary successors--both ser:ior and
 junior--would prove themselves.  The concept, to an out-
 sider,  is basically irrational; but it is clearly Mao's
 concept,  and Mao in important respects is irrational).
 In the last ten days of August the Red Guards
 burst out in the streets of Chinese cities.  Their actions
 were first reported as directed against the visible signs
 of traditional, Western and Soviet influence, but a picture
 later emerged of violence from the start, with beatings,
 torture, forced labor, pressured suicides, and murder (all
 of this against a defenseless populace), attacks on party

 headquarters and 'arty officials, and clashes between
 visiting Red Gu; ds and local forces  (including Rod
 Guards) organized by local officials.   Later information
 also showed that the Red Guards even in this first stage
 of their activity began to split into hosti'.e and com-
 peting factions, possibly reflecting differences in the
 new team itself.
 The Subsidence of the Red Guards
 The violence of the Red Guards began to subside
 in Peking--the pilot area for the country--at the end of
 August, at which time Lin Piao and Chou En-lai made the
 first of a series of speeches in which the two leaders
 were to take somewhat different lines, leading to specula-
 tion about critical differences between them.   In this
 case, while both ca?led for better discipline on the part
 of the Rf.:d Guards ("Don't hit people"), Lin again incited
 them against party leaders while Chou did not.   However,
 in briefing Red Guards going out to the provinces, Chou
 also encouraged the Red Guards to move aggressively against
 local party leaders despite anticipated resistance.   Chou
 again refused--at this stage--to specify targets or to
 state the new team's favor for one wing of the Red Guards
 over others, although both of these things were done at
 a later stage.   There is no evidence that Lin Piao or
 any other leader was giving the Guards contrary instruc-
 tions privately.
 While the party leaders in Peking were calling
 both for militancy and for discipline, and Peking itself
 was fairly quiet, serious clashes continued elsewhere in
 China until mid-September.   In some of these clashes,
 thousands of people were engaged, sometimes with hundreds
 of injuries and dozens of dead.  There is excellent evi-
 dence of the insolence and brutality of the Red Guards
 toward party officials and even the PLA.   It seems clear
 that the dominant leaders did not try very hard to hold
 the Guards within well-defined limits.

 Some observers have held that it was really the
 objective of the Red Guards in that period to overthrow
 the first secretaries of the regional, provincial and-"
 municipal bodies they "bombarded," and that they there-
 fore failed in their mission:  but the evidence is to
 the contrary.   Just as the Guards w~.-re not given specific
 targets, so they were not told how far to go, and the
 PLA at that stage was not told to help them.   Moreover,
 a survey of the Red Guard action--that is, of the targets
 of attack, and of the weight of the attacks--shows no
 pattern.   In Peking's eyes the mission of the Rud Guards
 seems to have been,  at that stage, not to overthrow but
 to shock, shake up, test the responses of, the party
 leaders outside Peking--out of Mao's dogmatic belief
 that the truth would emerge from such a "storm" and out
 of the new team's practical desire for additional material
 on which to base the real purge-list later.  The first
 secretaries outside Peking, however, may well have con-
 cluded that most of them would end up on the list no
 matter what they did.
 On 15 September, at a third great rally marking
 the end of the first period of Red Guard violence, Lin
 Piao again called for action (by implication, violence)
 against party leaders, while Chou En-lai chose to empha-
 size a constructive role for the Red Guards--assisting
 in production.   Again these differences suggested pos-
 sible policy differences.   however,  party and PLA journals
 soon endorsed the positions taken by both leaders, and
 the R,.~d Guards did in fact help with the harvest.
 In briefing the Red Guards in that period for future
 operations,  Chou En-lai and others of Mao's new team em-
 phasized that it was not Mao's intention to destroy the
 conventional party apparatus, and imposed clear, specific
 limitations on the Guards (e.g. they were not to seize
 official media, or imprison people).  These spokesmen
 continued, however, to refuse to provide specific targets
 or to arbitrate the quarrels among the Red Guards; and
 the Guards themselves continued to polarize, preparing
 to set up rival headquarters.  At the end of September,
 it appeared that further and strong action would be taken
 against important figures in the party, but that there
 might be some delay.

 waiting, Perhaps Debating
 The party's pronouncements in early October were
 thin and ambiguous:  e.g., the party journal in a single
 editorial called for "striking down" party leaders and
 for allowing them to correct their errors.   However, with-
 out publicity, the new team moved to reinstate the most
 militant students (now Red Guards) who had been denounced
 and suppressed by the work-teams, and in other ways
 began at this time to show its favor for this wing.
 Moreover, also without publicity, self-criticisms by
 leaders who had made "mistakes" (e.g. Liu Shao-chi's wife)
 were being offered.  Peking continued in this period to
 make known that Lin Piao was to be Mao's successor and
 to try to validate his claim to this position.
 There is some evidence that in mid-October an im-
 portant member of the new team submitted to the others
 a report on the "cultural revolution" which was soon
 found unsatisfactory,  indeed a continuation of the "er-
 roneous line" of Liu Shao-chi and Tong Hsiao-ping.  This
 report might have been by Tao Chu (who began to be attacked
 in posters three weeks later),  and may have been seen
 as an effort by Tao to protect the party apparatus (in-
 cluding Tao's own assets in the Central-South, where he
 had been the regional first secretary), against the plans
 of more militant members of the new team.
 On 18 October, there was another mass rally which
 was confined to a drive-by and seemed aborted.   The reason
 apparently lay in a dispute among the Red Guards about
 posting public criticism of Liu Si.ao-chi, a dispute which
 may, again, have reflected disagreement in the new team
 as to how to handle Liu.  The Guards were told, in effect,
 that the time was not ripe, which led to such large-scale
 fighting among them that the plans for a conventional
 rally were changed.   At about this time, rival Red Guard
 headquarters began to appear.
 Immediately thereafter, the party press began a
 series of extremely militant commentaries which suggested
 that the dominant figures of the new team were trying to

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 persuade some others that the time was at hand for deci-
 sive action against some of the party leaders in disfavor.
 In the same period, the recently-rehabilitated militants
 of the Red Guards smashed up some government offices in
 Peking, and there was a barrage of poster attacks on
 ministries and their coordinating staff offices.  These
 various developments suggested to some observers a warn-
 ing to Chou Fn-lai and others not to persist in opposi-
 tion to the plans of the dominant figures.  While Chou
 and Tao Chu both might reasonably be regarded as less
 militant than some others, Chou at least was in good favor
 and remained so, and the line-up of the time thus remains
 obscure.
 Mao's Scenario
 On 31 October, Red Flag made public a scenario
 for the future course of the purge.   It told party offi-
 cials that,  with the exception of a few hard cases, those
 in disfavor with the new team could keep from getting
 purged by conducting a grovelling self-criticism, admit-
 ting their errors (e.g. in the period of the work-teams,
 or during Red Guard "bombardments"), restoring the reputa-
 tions of those they had damaged, and (in effect) swear-
 ing eternal allegiance to Mao's thought.   While some
 observers argued that Peking was really saying that it
 was unable to act against leaders in disfavor, the edi-
 torial suggested instead that Mao was planning a prolonged,
 elaborate spectacle of a kind he had staged before on a
 smaller scale.
 Materials received much later revealed that the
 Chinese party was holding a work-conference at this time
 --ending about 8 November--in which Mao and Lin made
 important speeches, and in which Liu and Teng, both in
 disgrace, offered their first self-criticisms.   This con-
 ference was evidently attended by many or most of the
 regional and provincial first secretaries, whom Mao could
 have purged on the spot if that was all he wanted to do.
 The speeches of Mao and Lin, which are little known, are
 exceptionally valuable for an understanding of what Mao
 and Ln in fact wanted to do.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 Mao in his speech blamed himself for having allowed
 Liu and Tong (for some years before August) to handle the
 "routine work" of the party, admitted that he had not fore-
 seen every turn of the cultural revolution,  and reaffirmed
 the value of mass action.   He went on to tell his audience
 --in particular, the regional and provincial leaders--
 that they had not been well--prepared for the Red Guard
 descent on them in August and September and should be
 better-prepared for (lie implied) another wave.   He at-
 tempted to reassure them that most of then would "pass
 the test," and said that even Liu and Teng need not be
 regarded as hard-case incorrigibles like Peng Chen and
 others of the first group.   (Mao was not convincing, how-
 ever,                 in this avuncular role.)
 Mao's speech was apparently followed by the self-
 criticisms of Liu and Teng,                             in which both accepted re-
 sponsibiliti' for providing erroneous guidance (i.e.,
 guidance later found so) to the work-teams.   Liu went on
 to blame h:;.mself for certain rightist retreats in policy
 in earlier years which Mao almost certainly had approved
 at the time but which he now wished to attribute to some-
 one else.  However, neither self-criticism, as reported,
 was as grov~;lling as Mao appeared to desire.  In fact,
 Liu made a ;tinly-veiled defense of his actions, arguing
 (truthfully) that he had not been given clear guidance.
 Lin Piao in his speech to the conference did not
 bother to adopt a conciliatory pose and was harsh toward
 Liu and Teng in particular.   He emphasized that Mao meant
 to carry out a thorough struggle against opposing ideology,
 for as long as necessary.  He too praised the Red Guards.
 He also asserted that most of the party apparatus outside
 Peking was "good," but he said frankly that all local
 leaders would be judged for the mistakes that all local
 committees had made.   it  is doubtful that many :,~f the
 first secretaries from the regions and provinces were
 reassured by this presentation.

 Preparations for the Spectacle
 immediately following the conference, on 10 November
 People's Daily returned to the proposition--identified
 in p    icul r-with Chou En-lai--that the cultural revolu-
 tion must not be allowed to interfere with production.
 It was further reported that factories were being allowed
 to disband Red Guard units and replace them by "militia."
 Chou continued in high favor.
 During these first two weeks of November, there
 were renewed reports of serious incidents involving the
 Red Guards on one hand and party figures, the PLA, and
 factory workers on the other.  In some of these, the Red
 Guards again beat and tortured party officials.   In mid-
 November, the party closed the city of Peking to visit-
 ing Red Guards for the winter, and also forbade the Guards
 from operating private jails, kangaroo courts, and torture
 chambers.   At the same time, however, the central committee
 issued a general directive on the rehabilitation of the
 militants, another sign of the favor of the dominant figures
 for the very forces which had been doing these things.
 As of mid-November, the new team itself did not
 seem stable.   it was still dominated by an irrational
 and highly suspicious man whose continued favor could
 not be counted on and who might himself behave so badly
 that his lieutenants would combine to overthrow him,
 and its other members looked like a mismatched set.  There
 had already been signs of disagreement--perhaps very
 serious disagreement--among them, drawn along 'militant'
 and 'moderate' lines.  Most observers, even while disagree-
 ing about what had happened in the previous year, could
 and did agree at that time that the new team probably
 would not last.
 On 23 November, Red Guard pamphlets denouncing
 Liu and Teng in detail seemed to foretell early public
 action against some of the party leaders who had pre-
 viously been removed from the public scene or publicly
 demoted.   Mao is said to have left Peking (after a final
 Red Guard rally) on 26 November.  On 28 November, Mao's

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 wife publicly reiterated that those who had failed Mao
 would be put through criticism. and self-criticism in
 public spectacles, and that some would be brought down
 in any case; moreover,  Mine.  Mao seemed to snub Tao Chu
 publicly on this occasion,
 The Beginning of t11- Spectacle
 On 4 December, Mao's new team began to stage this
 long-promised series of spectacles.  On that day, Peng
 Chen and six lesser officials  ("cultural" figures) were
 handed over to the Red Guards.  Posters soon demanded
 their "trial," and other posters called for the dismis-
 sal from their posts of Liu Shao-chi and Tong Hsiao-ping.
 These were probably intended i.n part as a warning to
 regional and provincial officials to offer.  (or augment)
 their own self-criticisms before time ran out.
 By this time, all or almost all of the party's
 regional bureaus and provincial committees, and most of
 the major municipal committees, had been repeatedly cri-
 ticized in Red Guard posters.   Some of this criticism--of
 those not criticized earlier--may have been commissioned
 by the new team to get such criticism on the record,  in
 order to justify action against all of those (e.g.  proteges
 of leaders in disfavor) against whom it wanted to move
 for whatever reason.  No doubt a large purge-list was
 taking shape.
 At this time (12 December), Red Flag reiterated
 the ritual by which an erring officia  mus  seek forgive-
 ness--self-abasement, reinstatement of those injured,
 and correction of the record.   This editorial was especi-
 ally interesting in suggesting that many officials were
 refusing to make the kind of self-criticism Mao wanted,
 and in further suggesting that some of them were capable
 of putting Peking to a lot of trouble before being brought
 down.
 Meanwhile, in early December there had continued
 to be serious clashes between the Red Guards and party
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 committees, between the Guards and workers, and among
 elements of the Guards.   Beginning on 12 December, party
 leaders--particularly Chou En?-lai and Mme. Mao--again
 condemned violence by, against, and among the Guards,
 but again stated their favor for the most militant ele-
 itients of the Guards, those chiefly responsible for the
 violence.  Chou and Mme. Mao soon took action to dis-
 band some of the Red Guard organizations which had opposed
 these militants
 Mao's new team was clearly plan-
 ning to use the Guards on a large scale again.
 From 12 December, the public scene in Peking was
 filled with rallies.  On that date, Peng Chen was put on
 public display, possibly with others of the first group
 (Lu Ting-i, Lo Jui-ching, Yang Shang-kun).  On 13 Decem-
 ber Tao Chu, who himself may (but may not) have been al-
 ready marked for discard, made the first public attack
 by a party leader on Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Tao is said to have stated that theme had not been enough
 criticism of the Liu/Teng line--and, of course, not
 enough self-criticism by those who had implemented it.
 Tao's defense of himself for implementing that line .in
 June and July was jeered by some of his audience.
 In mid-December, the new team released Liu's self-
 criticism; and Mme. Mao publicly rejected it as  . "hoax,"
 but refused to let the Red Guards feature Liu and Teng
 in a public rally--possibly in the interest of not pro-
 voking any additional resistance from the party apparatus.
 She is also said to have told the Guards to allow the
 Ministry of Public Security to make all the arrests,
 while at the same time criticizing the Ministry (still
 directed by a protege of Teng Hsiao-ping who had turned
 against Teng) and announcing that it or at least elements
 of it would henceforth be subordinated to Lin Piao's PLA.
 Moreover, in the first known instance of specific target-
 ting by a party leader against others not already in clear
 disfavor, Mme. Mao marked several second-level leaders
 for action by the Red Guards.

 Public criticism of those in disfavor intensified,
 others came into disfavor, and even old opponents were
 gathered in.  On 10 and 20 December, fresh rallies were
 hold to denounce Peng Chen and others of the first group;
 all were displayed at the rally, and were brutally. handled
 by the Red Guards.   zit the same time,  huge new posters
 demanded further action against--even "liquidation" of--
 Liu and Tong.                     Other leaders,  including Ho Lung of the
 military affairs committee (who was later to be accused
 of planning a "rebellion" or "coup") were also denounced.
 Peng Te-huai,  the former Minister of Defense  (Lin Piao's
 predecessor) who had led the opposition to Mao in 1959
 and then disappeared,  was reportedly seized by Red Guards
 and brought to Pelting.
 The decision to move more forcefully against op-
 ponents of the new team seemed to be reflected in two
 other important developments in December.   On 26 December
 (Mao's 73rd birthday), People's Daily made public the
 essentials of a party r'irec ,ive which turned the Red
 Guards and other "revolutionary" organizations , oose
 on the factories; it was soon revealed that the "revolu-
 tion" would move into the countryside "on a large scale"
 as well.  Visible resistance to the "revolution" in those
 areas may have led the new team to take this action
 earlier than originally intended.   The other was the fall
 of Tao Chu,  and--apparently--of a number of military
 fi;ures, perhaps a week or so later,
 In early January,  Tao,  the ourt?h-ranking member
 of the new team,  was being denounced in the same terms
 as Liu and Teng and may have been paraded around Peking;
 and at the same time a number of military leaders--both
 commanders and pol i't ic.tl officers--began to be denounced.
 There were several other party leaders, at the second
 level, who seemed marked for discard.  The party appeared
 to be moving into a period in which there would be unusual
 opportunities for Mao's lieutenants to maneuver against
 one another.

 Prospects
 With respect to action against its opponents, Mao's
 new team by the end of December 1966 had moved some distance
 from the situation it had been in as early as October and
 as late as late November--when its pronouncements had in
 effect put the new team itself on trial, had obliged it
 to take some further action if it were not to seem either
 frivolous or impotent.   It had taken such action.  But
 it was agair. in a situation in which further action seemed
 to be demanded---action against those in disfavor who had
 refused to go through the elaborate ritual prescribed
 for them or had been found irredeemable anyway--including
 der,,inciation by name in the official press, the trial and
 sentencing of some of those in custody in Peking, and
 the dislodgement of some unregenerate leaders (probably
 the majority of the regional and provincial first secre-
 taries) outside Peking.
 The party directives of December, on extending the
 "revolution" to the factories and the countryside, gave
 Mao's new team both an occasion and an instrument for
 taking action at the same time against regional and pro-
 vincial leaders:   that is, the progress of the revolu-
 tion would surely cause a great deal of disorder and
 additional resistance, and party leaders outside Peking
 could be blamed for this, whereupon the Red Guards and
 other "revolutionary" organizations could depose those
 leaders by the approved method of mass action, action
 taken together with acceptable elements of the party com-
 mittees.   Reports from the provinces in January 1967 sug-
 gested that this in fact was happening at several points;
 Peking was explaining that the simple "overthrow" of those
 in disfavor would not do, that there must be a "seizure
 of power" by a "mass movement," arid was praising revolu-
 tionary "rebels" (against the conventional apparatus) who
 were calling for joint action with those in the party
 committees who were loyal to Mao's line.  Once again, how-
 ever, as often since 1957, Mao may have underestimated
 the resistance his new initiative would provoke.  Already
 in late January there were indications that the PLA would
 have to be used, something that Mao had preferred not to

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 do, and which may have been the issue behind the purge
 of late December.   Moreover,  if as expected the new of-
 fensive were to have damaging economic consequences,  the
 strength of the resistance would also be expected to
 increase.
 The role of the PLA leaders--including the command-
 ers of regional headquarters--may be critical.  These
 leaders have had some reason to worry, but have not had
 as good reason as-Have first secretaries outside Peking
 to conclude that most of them will be purged no matter
 what they do.   On balance, it seems likely that some of
 them will refuse to follow Mao's orders, but that the
 great majority will do as they are told.   Thus, while
 it is conceivable thrt Mao and others of the new team will
 be overthrown following a split in the PLA, the probability
 seems otherwise.  The prospect seems to be for substantial
 resistance by various combinations of forces at some
 points, but not for resistance coordinated to the point
 of posing a threat to Mao and the other central leaders.
 The threat to the new team seems still to proceed
 The new team
 even as recomposed--without Tao Chu--still seems unstable;
 not even Lin Piao, let alone the less militant Chou En-
 lai, can be sure of Mao's continued favor.
 There are various possibilities for a true "power
 struggle"--that is, for Mao's power.  Two possibilities
 turn on Lin's position:   if he sees himself as declining
 in Mao's favor (the tone of Peking's treatment of Lin has
 been muted since November), he might make common cause
 against Mao--with Chou and various military leaders--while
 he still can.  Or if Lin is actually deposed before he
 can do this, there might in consequence be the kind of
 equalization of strength among the two groups of Mao's
 lieutenants--the Maoists, and the relative moderates
 around Chou--which would make a frank competition feasible;
 then, should Chou win out, he might go on--with the sup-
 port of the military leaders--to depose Mao himself.

 There are at least two possibilities for a power     25X6
 struggle which do not depend on a decline in Lin's posi-
 tion.                              One is that of Mao's death
 the new team might quickly pull apart, through an an intensification  of the differences that seem already
 to exist.   Another is that of Mao's severe deterioration,
 to the point of incapacity, so that Tire` would have to be
 set aside.
 While evaluation of these possibilities

 incapacity  should probably be re
 ard

 e
 as an outside
 chance in itself.  And the four of them seem to add up
 to less than an overall probability of Mao's early over-
 throw.                              In sum, the prospect for 1967 seems to be for
 the continued dominance of Mao and the Maoists, and for
 their continued progress--at various speeds at various
 points--toward the reorganization of the party, govern-
 mental and military apparatus throughout China.

 THE "CULTURAL REVOLUTION" AND ITS VEHICLES
 The "great proletarian cultural revolution" in
 China is said by Peking to have derived from a nuitber
 of insights and pronouncements by Mao Tse-tung between
 1962 and the e:nd of 1965:   e.g. his admonition to the
 central committee's tenth plenum in September 1962
 "never to forget class struggle," his complaint about
 the state of the arts in China in December 1963, his
 warning to Chinese literary associations in June 1964
 that they and most of their publications had failed to
 carry out the party's policies, and his declaration in
 another central committee m,.eting of September 1965
 that it was necessary to "criticize bourgeois reaction-
 ary thinking."  Mao is further said to have "personally
 organized and led" the "cultural revolution" in the "last
 half of 1965."
 While these initiatives now attributed to Mao were
 not made public at the time and cannot be confirmed, the
 regime did in fact launch a "socialist education" campaign
 in spring 1963--a conventional campaign, conducted through
 orthodox part  organs
 and in mid-1964 public y
 indicated that something more ambitious lay ahead.  On
 14 July 1964, in the last of a series of violently
 polemical articles directed against the Soviet party
 ,
 Peking published an article "On Khrushchev's Phoney Com-
 munism" which has since been attributed to Mao personally.
 Among other things, the article spoke of "degeneration"
 in Chinese society (and of the efforts of "degenerates"
 to find "protectors and agents in the higher leading
 bodies"), of the need for a "thorough socialist revolu-
 tion on the political and ideological fronts" requir-
 ing a century or several centuries, of the need to con-
 duct extensive socialist education movements repeatedly
 throughout China, and of the need to train millions of
 successors who would carry on Mao's policies rather than
 to allow China to evolve into a "phoney" Communist state
 like the USSR.   It was asserted further that such suc-.
 cessors would come forward in "mass struggles" and be
 tempered in the "great storms of revolution."

 It is the thesis of this paper that Mao's obsession
 with the problem of revolutionary successors--of ensuring
 that his successors,  and their successors, be leaders whom
 he couFcc( trust to carry ouiis will--is the central fact
 in developments in China since September 1965.   This paper
 will contend that no other hypothesis can explain either
 the course of the "cultural revolution" or its casualties.
 The September 1965 meeting--not a plenum--of the
 CCP central committee probably played an important role
 in shaping the "cultural revolution," and possibly in
 fixing its targets among the top-ranking leaders of the
 party; but there is little solid information about it.
 Beyond the bare statement of the party that Mao at this
 meeting "pointed out that it is necessary to criticize
 bourgeois reactionary thinking"--which might at the time
 have referred narrowly to "cultural" matters, or at the
 other extreme might have referred to every kind of opposi-
 tion to the entire range of Mao's policies--the evidence
 on the content of the meeting is confined to a few state-
 nouncements by some                                          "          Lo~I
 Y        purged leaders which can be read in
 various ways, and assertions made recently in wall-posters.
 The September 1965 meeting need not, of course,
 have been confined to the coming revolution, but might
 have taken up--as well at that time as another--a set
 of large related matters, not only the content and scope
 of the "cultural revolution," but policies of economic
 and military development, the situation of the war in
 Vietnam on which Peking had staked so much, the implica-
 tions of all this for Peking's relationship with the USSR

 There is some confirmation in the 1 October 1965
 number of Red Flag that the September 1965 meeting had
 been concerned in large part if not mainly with the forth-
 coming "cultural revolution," and that there had been
 some resistance in the meeting to Mao's sense of it.   A
 major editorial on that date,  "Adopt the Proletarian
 World Outlook to Create Our New World," reviewed the
 "tremendous successes" which had resulted from following
 Mao's guidance and the party's line,  and went on to ob-
 serve ominously that "the old ideas. .                      .have always attemp'Led
 to fight for survival and to disseminate their influence
 under the cloak of names and slogans of socialism and
 Marxism-Leninism"--the implication being that some persons
 in the party who presented an orthodox appearance were
 covertly heretical.   (This line was later to emerge as
 the charge that Mao's opponents were waving a false 'Red
 Flag' in order to bring down the real Red Flag.)  Never-
 theless,  it was still possible for the party journal to
 reassure its readers that the determination to achieve
 a through-going "proletarian world outlook...does not
 mean that we want to negate everything and denigrate
 heritage"; it was rather to "keep all the valuable parts
 intact," and the method of operation was to be that of
 "democratic criticism," making "full use of explanation."
 The Red Flag warning about heresy-masked-as-orthodoxy
 was no  repeated in the editorial of the People's Daily,
 which was to lag until the following June  t- i eceiVing
 the signals correctly in the "cultural revolution."
 A wall-poster not reported uritil January 1967 also
 provides some confirmation of opposition to Mao's concepts
 in that ;eptember 1965 meeting.   Mao himself is quoted
 in the poster as declaring that the "party center. . .pro-
 posed revisionism" it, September and October 1965.  The
 implication is that the top leaders of the party apparatus--
 Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping--led this opposition,
 and another poster of the same period expressly accuses
 Teng of being in opposition to Mao in that meeting; but
 these charges came at a ti.iie when Peking was blackening
 Liu and Teng retroactively, and it is uncertain whether
 they really were in opposition that early.
 The evidence is a bit better that Peng Chen and
 Lo Jui-ching were among those offering resistance then

 to some aspect of Mao's plans for the "revolution." Peng
 Chen, speaking on National Day (1 October) in Peking, can
 be regarded at least in hindsight as speaking like a man
 who had lost an argument about "cultural" policy and
 wanted both to reaffirm his position and to keep the sub-
 ject open for another effort later:   after a number of
 frank statements about China's backwardness and problems,
 Peng in this speech asserted that the party must encourage
 the "full airing of different views" and must pay atten-
 tion to all views both correct and incorrect, because
 "divergent views make comparison possible and help guard
 against onesidedness."   (This can also be read as an am-
 plification of portions of the Red Flag editorial, but
 Chou En-lai in a speech on the same occasion did not take
 this line.)*
 o  ui-c ing s -speeches of May and September 1965 can
 also be read as implying favor for positions which,  if
 stated in the September meeting, could have got him into
 troubl;.   But readers differ as to which of his conjectured
 views are applicable.  Some hold that in his May speech,
 in discussing preparations for war and the strategy of
 "active defense" in war, Lo was stating his favor for
 some doctrine other than Mao's; it is hard to understand
 this argument, however, as Lo in his speech spells out
 the doctrine in terms which seem to be entirely consonant
 with Mao's, and in fact explicitly cites Mao as his auth-
 ority for the doctrine.  Others hold that in his September
 speech (delivered just prior to the meeting), Lo was
 stating his favor for a more aggressive policy in the war
 in Vietnam, one which would have meant war with the U.S.;
 others do not find that in his speech but find instead
 indications of a strong professional respect for (or fear
 of) the U.S. military establishment ("They are armed to
 the teeth and possess complete sets of machinery for kill-
 ing people.  Whoever is afraid of death...has no alterna-
 tive but to surrender...").   Either point of view could
 have led him to argue that the central problem was not
 the indoctrination but the combat-readiness of the military
 establishment, which would entail a compromise with the
 USSR, and so on. He may well have argued  this way, but,
 it will be contended, for other reasons than those imputed
 to him on the basis of this speech.

 Peng,  at a propa-
 ganda conference the same month (September 1965), declared

 everyone is equal before the truth--a proposition

 vote against Mao at the September meeting--presumably an
 overstatement,  in view of Peng's continued activity
 through March 1966.  However, the various material,  includ-
 ing the fact that action was begun against Peng only two
 months after the September meeting, does seem to add up
 to a probability that Peng was in some degree of opposi-
 tion to Mao at that meeting.
 The same is true of Lo Jui-ching, who was appar-
 ently seized just two months after the meeting.
 On the PLA anniversary in 1966 (1 August), the news-
 papcr, reviewing the three "big struggles" against repre-
 sentatives of the "bourgeois military line" since 1953
 (all of them, actually, stating a professional military
 point of view as opposed to Mao's obsession with guerrilla
 warfare and political indoctrination), spoke of the last
 struggle as "not very long ago," a struggle with those
 who "had got hold of important posts in the army and...
 opposed the Party's central committee and Mao Tse-tung's
 thought,...covertly opposed Comrade Lin Piao's directives
 on putting politics in the forefront,... gave first con-
 sideration to military affairs, technique and specialized
 work..."

 In other
 words, Lo's offense was to resist Mao's desire for even
 further political indoctrination of the armed forces at
 the necessary expense of military preparedness.*
 As for others who may have opposed Mao at that
 September meeting, there is less evidence.
 J Lu Ting-i, then director of the propaganda depart-
 ment and third in importance among the party leaders thus
 far purged, also spoke at the September 1965 propaganda
 conference summoned by Peng Chen, and in his speech at-
 tacked Stalin (read Mao).   Another possibility is Yang
 Shang-kun, judging entirely from his disappearance.   And
 as previously noted,  it is possible that Liu and Teng
 were among the opposition.    Tia  is,  the build-up
 of Lin Piao to replace Liu as Mao's chosen successor
 moved swiftly after September 1965, and, while it had
 begun before the meeting with the attribution to Lin
 of a major article on Mao's thought,** its acceleration
 may have reflected Mao's disappointment with Liu's
 performance at the m:_,eting.  Finally, recent poster
 attacks (since November 1066) on Liu and Teng include the
 *r. Red. uard_poster has quoted Chou En-lai as assert-
 ing that Peng and Lo (the "armed forces") were in league.
 This may or may not hare been true, but they seem to have
 had a common interest in preventing Mao from carrying out
 his extreme policies.
 **One of the functions of Lin's article was to 'correct'
 a mistake made by Peng Chen in May, when Peng had publicly
 (and correctly) attributed to Aidit the concept that the
 countryside of the world will surround and overcome the
 cities of the world, a concept which Mao claims as his
 own; Lin in his article set the record 'straight,' and,
 in view of Mao's boundless vanity,  it seems likely that
 Peng was already in some trouble about this.

 charge that Teng at the September meeting made a speech
 declaring his opposition to the plans for a cultural
 revolution and in particular to changes in the educational
 system; this charge is no doubt over-stated, in view of
 Teng's subsequent continuance in some degree of favor
 until August 1966, but it is possible that Teng offered
 less than the resounding approbation that Mao desired.
 In sum, while September 1965 was probably an im-
 portant date in the development of the "cultural revolu-
 tion," it is impossible to judge how much of Mao's think-
 ing he made known at the meeting.   Similarly, while several
 of the party's leaders--Liu, Teng, Peng, Lu, Lo, Yang,
 and perhaps others--were or may have been resisting Mao
 at that meeting,  it is impossible to judge the degree or
 (in most cases) the precise issue.
 A harsh tone about the party's intentions, together
 with a description of the ongoing campaign as a "cultural
 revolution," appeared in the official version (1 January
 1966) of a speech given by the propagandist and culture
 monitor Chou Yang in. November 1965.  But Chou was not
 launching a qualitatively different campaign; he was in-
 stead trying to get aboard a bandwagon which (he had
 observed) had begun to roll in Shanghai three weeks earlier,
 and which was soon to run down Chou Yang himself.
 Mao Contrives a Test, Winter 1965-66
 The Shanghai development was the appearance in a
 local newspaper of a polemical attIck by Yao Wen-yuan,
 a little known Shanghai writer, on a 1961 play by Wu Han,
 a well-known writer who had worked closely with officials
 on the party's Peking municipal committee headed by Peng
 Chen.    This event--the initiative for which was taken
 directly or indirectly by Mao--was not even noticed in
 the West; this particular issue (10 November) of the
 paper was not received.

 tnat it was Mao who ordere  the firing of this

 opening gun,  is more credible than is the contention of
 some observers that one of Mao's lieutenants--say, Lin
 Piao or Teng Ilsiao-ping- -planted the article as a specula-
 tive investment for which he only later got Mao's back-
 ing.   Mao was,  after all, active at the time,  and this
 was a major decision.*   It also seems, on balance (although
 this was in doubt for some months), more likely that Mao
 deliberately did not make his intentions clear as to what
 purpose the article was to serve, than that Mao fell ill
 before he could make his intentions clear.   In other
 words, Mao meant the article to serve as a test for his
 entire "cultural" apparatus and for the hig es  leaders
 of the party apparatus which supervised it, with a few
 possible exceptions:  Lin Piao, Chen Po-ta and a few
 others (e.g., Chiang Ching) were probably regarded as
 having already passed the test, and were in Mao's confid-
 ence; while Peng  Chen,  l:u Ting-i and a few others
 (e.g.
 Chou Yang) were probably regarded as having already failed
 the test,  and thus already marked  or purging.   Thus Mao
 was doing in 1965 what the party had asserted--probably
 falsely--that he had done in 1957 in'the first stage of
 the "hundred flowers" campaign, namely,  allowing people
 to respond freely (without guidance) to a major initiative,
 and then punishing those whose reponses did not please
 him.   (In the 1957 campaign,  it had been Mao who was
 deceived:   the evidence is good that in encouraging free
 expression in that campaign he had mistaken obedience

 for love and was shocked by the opposition and hostility
 revealed,  and that when the crackdown came the party
 was simply putting a good face on things by asserting
 that Macy all along had meant to entice his enemies to
 stick their heads tip so he could cut them off; but Mao
 hau learned something from 1957, that his opponents could
 be enticed into revealing themselves.    It seems likely,
 although it cannot be proved, that Liu and Teng were
 already on the list of those to be "tested."  There is
 an alternative hypothesis--that Liu and Teng were in
 Mao's confidence from the start, joined him in watching
 the party's "cultural" leaders disgrace themselves, and
 only later fell into disgrace themselves; but this is
 not consistent with evidence that Liu at least (if not
 Teng) was falling from Mao's favor as early as March.
 The failure of Liu and Teng to bring the central press
 into line on the "cultural" issue as Mao had posed it--
 whether Hai Jui was a "poisonous weed"--can be explained
 in either-of--two ways:   (a) they may have been consciously
 resisting what they sensed to be Mao's will (if the
 charges of opposition as early as September 1965 are
 true), perhaps in the expectation that Mao would die or
 that they would prevail anyway, or (b),  as seems a bit
 more likely, they may instead simply have failed to un-
 derstand what Mao wanted, have lacked the illumination
 of his already-revealed thought and the revolutionary
 ardor which (in Mao's view) shoLid have shown them the
 "correct" line without specific guidance.  Either way,
 they failed the test.
 immediately after the publication of Yao's
 article, the Peking committee queried the Shanghai commit-
 tee as to what kind of high-level backing this article
 might have.   in the next three weeks, most of China's
 important newspapers and journals reprinted the article;
 one group of publications--led by Lin Piao's Liberation
 Army Daily--forthrightly agreed with the author tT aVW
 Han s    ayay was a "poisonous weed," while another group--
 including the central committee's own newspaper, People's
 Daily, and the publications of the Peking committee--ca  ed
 instead for a "hundred flowers" debate on the question.
 Toward the end of November, Mao and a number of other
 important leaders dropped out of sight; two of these--Lo

 Jui-ching  .~   `an- Sharp --'-,o n--were apparently the first
 top-level victims of the developing purge.*
 It was not clear at the time that Lin Piao and the
 PLA newspaper had been chosen as the public leaders of
 the "cultural revolution, " although ;,here was some pre-
 cedent.   Since the time of the September 1962 plenum,
 the ILA under Lin Piao had been consistently presented
 as the model for all Chinese to emulate in the "creative
 study and application of Chairman Mao Tse-tung's works."
 In 1964, a political officer system modelled on that of
 the PLA had been established in several sectors of the
 economy, staffed in large part by PLA officers.   In
 September 1965, with the appearance of Lin's first major
 article (this on Mao's concept of "people's revolution-
 ary war"), the regime had begun to build up Lin as the
 foremost and ideal student of Mao's thought.   And on 15
 November 1965, Lin issued a five-point directive on the
 work of the PLA for 1966.   Although this too was not
 clear at the time, this directive was to be used as the
 model for the testing of party officials as well as of-
 ficers of the PLA--the essential point being whether
 these officials "regarded the works of Mao Tse-tung as
 the highest instructions" for their work.   it was soon
 explicitly stated and reiterated that Lin himself had
 shown everybody how to study and apply Mao's thought.
 There are various repor.s and conjectures as to
 why 11Iao left Peking and as to what he was doing in this
 period--lasting until early May--when he remained out of
 sight.  One view (the view taken by this study) is that
 Mao withdrew in order to sketch out., or to observe (if
 it had in fact been sketched out in September), from a
 *Lo Failed-o +ap'pear on an important military funeral
 committee in December.  The removal of Lo--who had the
 power to order troops into action--was evidently thought
 to be a more urgent necessity than the removal of Peng.
 This was probably true of Yang also.;  although he may not
 have been arrested for months.

 At the time of Mao's disappearance,* and parti-
 cularly as the months wore on with no indication of Mao's
 whereabouts or condition, there was ground for speculation
 that Mao was seriously ill--perhaps completely incapacit-
 ated                                                                  i
 There was not to be any
 additional 'hard' evidence as to Mao's condition until
 May 1966, when he re-emerged in what seemed to be aston-
 ishingly good shape.
 While it seems fair to assume that
 Peking was never telling its officials the com lete truth,
 the account of Mao's role                               s            25X1
 generally credible, both because (a) some of the things
 stated, which moreover seemed improbable at the time,
 have since been confirmed, e.g. the importance of Mao's
 wife in the "cultural revolution" in general and with
 respect to specific tasks, and (b) the failure of
 Liu S1iiao-c   was ou  of the news from mid-November
 to mid-January, and was presumed at the time to have
 been with Mao and in Mao's confidence; but the failure
 of Liu Shao-chi to bring the central party press into
 line on the question of Hai Jui, in the period of Decem-
 ber t,) April while he was the ranking party leader, seems
 most credibly explained by Mao's failure to confide in
 Liu that he meant the issue of Hai Jui to serve as a
 test for the entire party apparus-Tincluding Liu).
 Wall-posters have quoted Mao to the effect that he left
 Peking for Shanghai in November 1965 because he felt
 that the party apparatus in Peking was unresponsive to
 him--in other words, that he had already decided to purge
 the entire top leadership of the party apparatus; but
 it is uncertain whether he had really decided by that
 time to purge anyone but Peng Chen and Lo Jui-ching.

 of the politburo--indicating, perhaps, Liu's approval--a

 not credible as a whole, because it assigns key roles to

 ber) and Ho Lung (in such good favor with Mao as late as
 August 1066 that Mao rode with him at a rally).

 Early in the same month (March), Teng Hsiao-ping
 had dropped out of sight,  and was presumed to be with
 Mao.  Later in March, on the 26th, Peking announced that
 Mao was not ill (meaning, probably, that he had recover-
 ed),** and on the same day Liu Shao-chi departed on a
 trip abroad that was to keep him out of Peking for the
 next four weeks, a period in which important steps were
 taken in the "cultural revolution" and the purge.  Liu's
 trip served two purposes:  to give the appearance of
 'business as usual' after the announcement that Mao was
 well, and to get him out of the way for the move against

 Communist party that Mao was fully in command in late
 March.   After the CCP and JCP had reached agreement on
 a joint communique, Mao met with the delegations and
 peremptorily rejected their draft, thus reversing Chou
 En-lai and several other senior leaders, whom he cri-
 ticized for their conduct.

 Peng Chen.
 On 29 March, Peng Chen
 made his last public appearance; and in the second week
 of April, probably some days after returning to Peking,
 Teng Hsiao-ping reappeared in public.
 The dispute on the issue of how hard a line to
 take toward Wu Ban's play had been conducted throughout
 the winter of 1965-66, and was still going on until a
 few days before Tong's public reappearance.   At that
 time, the end of the first week in April, the party's
 central publications--People's Daily and Red Flag--agreed
 that Hai Jui was indeed a_"poisonous weed   just-as Mao's
 spokesman and the Liberation Army Daily (Lin Piao's voice)
 had contended all along._      oo a   and still does) as
 though Tong had brought back to Peking--a few days before
 he reappeared in public--clear instructions from Chairman
 Mao, who had decided that the dispute had gone on long
 enough, that some had passed the test and others had failed
 it (some, of course, had been given the answers in advance),
 and that all would now line up on one position.   (Tie PLA
 newspaper continued, however, to attack positions taken
 by People's Daily,  the party organ, on other issues.)
 The Peking committee itself tried quickly--and un-
 successfully--in mid-April to protect its leaders by
 taking the lead in denouncing one of its own lesser figures
 who had worked with Wu Tian.   It was not clear at the
 time whether any of the party's leaders--even the leaders
 of the Peking committee--would fal:17-- i consequence of the
 PLA newspaper's admonitions to "old comrades" and those
 in "high positions" (5 April)  and Red Flag's call for
 acticn (29 April) against the "protectors of Wu Ilan,
 but it was apparent that "socialist education" was about
 to move, as the Communists say, to a new and higher stage--
 that is,          a wide-scale if not high-reaching purge.
 On 18 April, the Liberation Army Daily in a major
 editorial forecast the direction, iT not the full range,
 of the developments of the next several. months.  Entitled
 "Hold aloft the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's thinking

 and take an active part in the great socialist cultural
 revolution," the editorial reviewed the "sharp class
 struggle on the cultural front" and the "black anti-
 socialist thread running counter to Mao Tse-tung's.think-
 ing"  since 1949,  introduced the term "great... cultural
 revolution" and traced it back to the tenth plenum in
 September 1962, reiterated its earlier assertion that
 Mao's works were to be regarded as  'supreme guidance,"
 asserted that a "mass movement is rising," and called
 in sum for nothing less than a "new culture."  It did
 not, however, specify, as party journals were later to
 specify, that the main targets of the revolution would
 be the "reactionary academic 'authorities"' and the
 "bourgeois representatives within the party."  On 30
 April Chou En-lai lined up on the right side (where he
 was to remain), declaring that a "cultural revolution
 of great historical significance is being launched in
 China."   In speeches in the same period, Teng Hsiao-
 ping spoke briefly but favorably of the new "revolution,"
 while Liu Shao-chi did not find--or was not given--occasion
 to mention it.
 April-May:  Dominance of the Party Apparatus
 The "cultural revolution" began in some places in
 late April, soon after the PLA newspaper had given the
 signal in the 18 April editorial; and it seems to have
 been underway everywhere in May.  The theme of the first
 stage was also stated (8 May) by the Liberation Army Daily:
 "Open Fire on the Anti-Party and Anti=socla?isT   ack
 Thread."
 At just this time (on or about 10 May), Mao reap-
 peared, receiving a group of Albanian visitors at some
 point believed to be in East China.   Vith Mao on this oc-
 casion were Lin, Chou, Teng, and a liaison official (Wu
 Hsiu-chuan).   (Chen Po-ta reappeared at the same time,
 but not in this group.)   In films of the meeting, Mao       25X6
 looked astonishingly good:   he looked younger than his
 years, moved easily and without assistance  and dis la ed
 no tremors.

 Throughout China,  in late April and May, rallies
 and meetings of all elements of the population (or their
 "representatives") were held in order to denounce the
 "black gang" uncovered in Peking and to swear allegiance
 to Mao's though. and promise to study it even more
 thoroughly.  These were not casual affairs; they seem
 to have disrupted community life all over China for a
 period of weeks; and worse was ahead.
 Some observers have surmised that the "cultural
 revolution" was directed from the start by the "group in
 charge of the cultural revolution" at the party center
 in Peking--that is, by the extraordinary body headed by
 Chen Po-ta, a body which was an enlarged successor to the
 five-man group headed by Peng Chen until his downfall in
 or about April 1966.  This surmise would seem reasonable
 at first glance, and also because a number of special
 groups named--from their own members---by party committees
 at all levels in April and May expressly to carry out the
 tasks of the "cultural revolution" were in most if not
 all cases known as "cultural revolution teams" or "cultural
 revolution groups,"  However, while the "group" at the
 party center may have existed in a quiescent state in
 April, May and June, there is good evidence that the con-
 ventional party apparatus was in charge of the conduct
 of the "revolution" in its early stages.  This fact makes
 more interesting the emergence of extraordinary party
 bodies, and the activities of even more special organiza-
 tions such as the Red Guards, later in the campaign.

 With the ground prepared in April and May, the
 party was ready to move against the range of cultural and
 educational organizations--"all cultural, educational,
 journalistic, publishing and academic unii:s"--and in

 particularly against the educators, the principal carriers
 of the -Ii case of "bourgeois ideology."
 Before the campaign against these targets was
 launched, there was apparently another central committee
 meeting, analogous to the September 1965 meeting.  Most
 of the party's leaders were out of the news during the
 third and fourth weeks of May.  Wall-posters seen much
 later (December) quoted Lin Piao to the effect that the
 May meeting considered the fact that most central com-
 mittee members had a poor understanding of the cultural
 revolution and were resisting it; and the account of Lin's
 speech to the October-November work-conference has him
 criticizing Liu and Teng for acting contrary to the line
 which--the speech suggests--was stated by Mao in May.*
 Other posters have suggested 16 May--the date of a "com-
 nmunique" cited by Lin--as the approximate date of the
 decision to send in work-teams.
 The campaign against the educators--which was
 obviously planned from the start to be a campaign concur-
 rently against the party committees in the universities,
 committees in which the administrators of the universities
 were usually leading figures--got underway on 1 June,
 with a Peking broadcast on the substance of big-character
 posters written by "revolutionary" students and teachers
 at Peking National University which denounced the univer-
 sity's administration for its poor (conservative) conduct
 of the revolution to that time.  This was the signal for
 similar posters to go up on campuses all over China.
 There is a fair amount of information on the cam-
 paign on several campuses in June, and substantial info-
 mation on the campaign at Peking National University it-
 self.                           The campaign at this university--commonly known
 as "Peita," a contraction of the Chinese name--seews to

 on the basis of propaganda treatment of Liu, that he was
 already in trouble; this minority view is now known to
 have been correct,  although it was weakened by a related
 thesis (regarded then and now as incorrect) that Teng
 Hsiao-ping rather than Mao was the prime mover.  The
 very good treatment that Liu and Teng were getting in
 the Peking press as late as July is now believed,-to have
 been the result of their own dominance of the press (in
 Mao's absence)  at that time.

 a visit to higher party authorities (almost certainly the
 reorganized Peking municipal committee) in Peking.   On
 1 June, however, the party center was ready. On that day,
 concurrently with an incendiary editorial in the reformed
 and militant People's Daily which specified that "educators
 must be the first  o rece ve an education," Peking broad-
 cast the content of the 25 May posters attacking the
 president.   On the same day or the next day (Peking has
 given both dates) the original posters--reinforced by
 other posters--went up on the walls.   Peking has since
 described this action as the "first shot" in the revolu-
 tion at Peita, and has attributed the decision to Mao.
 June:   The Party's Work-Teams
 The vehicle of the revolution at Peita, a vehicle
 which was to proliferate elsewhere in China during June,
 was the "work-team."  This was a small team--rarely if
 ever larger than five people--assigned and named by higher
 party committees, and sent down to investigate and to
 carry out the cultural revolution.
 Peking has confirmed the surmise that the concept
 of the work-team was approved by Mao if not actually
 originated by him.  ;;peaking in November 1966, Chiang Ching,
 Mao's wife, did try to reduce Mao's responsibility for
 the failure of the work-teams ("As early as June of this
 year our Chairman Mao made the point that work-teams
 should not be sent out hastily"), but she nevertheless
 associated Mao with the decision to send in the work-teams.

 Peking announced on 3 June that the reorganized
 Peking municipal committee (known to have been in opera-
 tion
 no later than 25 May) had decided to assign a "work-
 team" headed by Chang Chieng-hsien (a secretary of the
 Honan provincial committee) Co Peking University to lead
 the cultural revolution; also, to remove the president
 and his deputy from the posts of secretary and deputy
 secretary of the university's party committee; and also,
 to have the new work-team function as the university's
 party committee until another could be organized.   Under-
 lining its point that the new Peking municipal committee--
 a part of the regular party apparatus--was in charge of
 the "revolution" at Peita, the 3 June announcement of Li
 Hsueh-feng and  Wu Te as the new first and second secretaries
 of the committee went on to state flatly that all of the
 work of the cultural revolution in the city of Peking
 was under the "direct leadership" of the new municipal
 committee.   On 5 June, Peking reported that "at present,
 under the leadership of the work-team appointed to the
 university" by the new Peking municipal committee, the
 masses of teachers, students and workers at Peita were
 "liquidating" the former president's "crimes."
 25X1
 There was a precedent for the dispatch of a "work-
 team" of this kind.  During the autumn of 1964, "social-
 ist education" work-teams had been sent down from higher
 party levels to help with political work in the country-
 side.                         Such activity included the identification of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 activists, the organization of these activists, the or-
 ganization of criticism of party cadres by the peasants,
 and eventually the self-criticism of the peasant associa-
 tions.  This activity in the countryside, however, had
 been low-key and leisurely, compared with the assign-
 ment given the new work-teams in the schools.
 Similar scenarios--criticism of the administrators-
 and-secretaries of universities for conservative leader-
 ship of the revolution, and their displacement by work-
 teams sent from higher party levels--have been provided
 by Puking and by the provincial press for several other
 institutions of higher learning.  At Chengtu University,
 for example, "revolutionary students and teachers" began
 on 3 June to put up posters criticizing the deputy
 secretary of the university's party committee--the "leader"
 of the university's existing "cultural revolution group,"
 the group named by the university committee--for having
 failed to mobilize the mass of revolutionary students.
 He was moved to hold an "emergency meeting" about this;
 the Chengtu municipal committee and the Szechuan provin-
 cial committee backed the students and criticized him;
 the students and teachers put up more posters, and he
 again defended himself but was removed from office by
 the Clrngtu committee sometime before 23 June, at which
 t iyjme it was announced that both the Szechuan provincial
 committee and the Southwest regional bureau had approved
 the action, and that the Chengtu committee was sending
 in a work-team to take over.*  Similarly, at Chengchow
 University the acting president and concurrently secretary
 of the university's party committee was criticized in
 '25neinferes ing i. `em in the Chengtu account is that
 the dismissal was announced by the Chengtu committee's
 propaganda department.  This suggests that the members of
 these first "cultural revolution teams"--that is, the
 teams named by party committees from their own members,
 as distinct from the work-teams later sent down from
 higher party organs--were originally selected by the
 propaganda departments of the party committees.

 early June, resisted, but was found guilty by the provin-
 cial committee of having suppressed the revolutionary
 students and teachers; the provincial committee dismissed
 him, and sent in a work-team in mid-June to "reorganize"
 his "cultural revolution group."  There are similar ac-
 counts from a dozen other institutions.   In all cases the
 actions of dismissal of the offending administrator/secretary
 and of dispatch of the work-team were said to have been
 taken by the appropriate organ of the conventional party
 apparatus.
 Work-teams were sent to many other places,  in addi-
 tion to the schools.  Peking itself has never provided a
 clear picture of the depth of the effort--that is, how
 far down into the cities and the countryside they were
 sent, and the provincial press has not presented a clear
 picture either.  The latter, however, indicates that they
 were sent to "many" party and government organizations
 as far down as medium-sized cities and possibly below,
 and that they were concentrated on (although not restricted
 to) "cultural and educational units" of all kinds, includ-
 ing newspapers, publishing houses, radio-stations, cultural
 bureaus, federations of art workers, even movie-houses.
 The criterion for sending a work-team seems to have been
 the existence of "problems"--meaning, as in the case of
 the schools, an insufficiently militant local leadership,
 the presence of a leader or group of leaders who had al-
 ready failed the test and was now marked for discard.*
 ii a   iese work - eams were struggling with their
 tasks, the party center publicly indicated its sense of
 the scope of the problem..   On 13 June, the CCP central
 committee (along with the State Council) issued a notice
 decreeing the postponement of college entrance examina-
 tions for six months in order to "thoroughly carry out
 the cultural revolution and-reform the educational
 system."  As surrounding commentaries made clear, the
 new system was to put a new emphasis on class background
 and political reliabi~ity as criteria for admission, on
 the division of the students' time between study and
 labor, and on political indoctrination.   In late October,
 Peking reportedly extended the postponement to summer
 1965.

 Nevertheless, the work-teams do not appear to have
 been given directives to support the most militant elements
 of the "revolutionary students and teachers" that they
 could find, even though they were subsequently discredited
 for having failed to do just that.  Neither, it appears,
 were the party committees themselves given such directives
 by whatever combination of leaders was then directing the
 "cultural revolution" from Peking.    Many of the first
 directives may have emphasized the establishment of order,
 as many campuses were reported to be out of control.W-
 The picture is complicated by the fact that it is
 not known how active were the roles, at this stage, of
 Mao and the small group of lieutenants who were soon to
 emerge as the "group in charge of the cultural revolution."
 As previously noted, it is virtually certain that Mao
 approved the concept of the work-team, and it seems quite
 probable that Tao Chu as the new head of the Propaganda
 Department and other officers of the "cultural revolution
 In at Ieast some instances, the work-teams were in
 fact directed to take action against the leftists.   For
 example,  in Tsinghai the provincial party co'nnittee an-
 nounced on 13 June a decision to remove the editor of
 the Tsinghai Daily for an editorial he had commissioned
 and published ten days earlier, and to send in a work-
 team to "systematically examine and reform" the work of
 the newspaper.  The editorial, condemned by the party
 committee as contrary  to  Mao's thinking, in fact stated
 precisely the militant line on the conduct of the revolu-
 tion that was later to be vindicated (and the editor
 himself was later to serve as a prime example of a func-
 tionary to be "rehabilitated" by a party committee which
 had acted incorrectly).    it is impossible to believe
 that the Tsinghai party committee would have acted in
 this way, at this stage of the revolution, if there had
 been an existing directive to support the militants.

 group" (whether it was in operation yet as a group of not)
 took part in the discussions which preceded the decision
 to establish the work-teams.   There is also a little
 evidence (to be presented later) that some of these lead-
 ers provided some degree of guidance, at least to work-
 teams in Peking.   However, it is probable that the largest
 roles in providing guidance to the party committees,
 which in turn provided it to the work-teams, were played
 by the senior figures of the conventional party apparatus,
 Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.   In any case, it is
 probably the latter who will be forced--or have already
 been forced--to accept the largest share of responsibility
 for what has been found retroactively to be the "mistakes"
 of the work-teams.
 Similarly,  it is unclear whether Mao planned in
 advance to discredit the work-teams, as part of a scheme
 for discrediting the conventional party apparatus and
 its leaders, or whether instead he found them to be in-
 sufficiently revolutionary after examining their perform-
 ance for some weeks.  On balance, the latter seems more
 likely,  if for no other reason than that the pioneer work-
 teams were assigned by the new Peking party committee
 which itself had just been named, and thus was not a part
 of the old apparatus.  But in either case Mao was setting
 the conventional party apparatus another test, as he had
 with the issue of Hai Jui the previous winter, and as he
 had with the stage! Tie "cultural revolution" which had
 just been conducted by the local party committees whose
 teams were dislodged by the work-teams; and again it was
 to fail the test.
 What happened was that "many" of the work-teams
 assigned to the universities--and presumably many of
 those assigned to other organizations and "units"--did
 not give in to the extreme demands of campus leftists
 w1 se clamor had already brought down the previous
 administrator/secretaries and leaders of the first "cul-
 tural revolution teams" and who were later to be justi-
 fied in virtually the full range of their demands.   In
 the great majority of cases (judging from Peking's later
 descriptions of the "mistakes" of the work-team concept
 and work-team operations), the work-teams sympathized

 more with their fraternal party organizations on the
 campuses, the party committees there which likewise were
 the product of the conventional party apparatus,  than
 with the militant students (many of whom were soon to
 emerge as Red Guards).*  In other words, the work-teams,
 following the removal of the administrator/secretary
 previously marked by the party center as the main target,
 failed to carry through the range of action against the
 faculty and student-body demanded by the militants, and
 in many cases "suppressed" the militants in much the
 same ways as had the local leaders who had just lost their
 jobs.
 re a ively small number of work-teams guessed right,
 or were sent in late enough (in July) to have got some
 clues.   Speaking to this point in November 1966, Chiang
 Ching described the decision to send the work-teams in
 the first place as an "error," said that the work of the
 work-teams was "still more erroneous,}' and then noted
 that "some work-teams followed correct principles and
 policy and did not make mistakes."  Apparently the most
 common attitude was that expressed by Li I Isueh-feng of
 the Peking committee (according to later posters) on 23
 June:   "At this tense moment, party members should stand
 up and defend their party leaders; if they do not, Nazis
 will take over."   As it turned out, 'Nazis' took over any-
 way.

 In a written self-criticism dated 10 October
 (reported in wall-posters), Mme. Liu was to provide a
 summary of the "errors" of the work-team at Tsinghua.
 The work-team had been  (i.e. was found retroactively to
 have been) too conservative; there had been trouble
 with the "false leftists" (known to have included some
 vindicated later as the  'real' leftists, the revolution-
 aries who had acted correctly) who were trying to dis-
 credit the work-team; her own plan was to make an example
 both of the "black gang"  (those regarded as extreme
 rightists) and the "false leftists," but unfortunately
 the team had acted against some people whose views differed

 from the work-teams (i.e. those later vindicated as true
 revolutionaries); the work-team had employed improper
 methods in prohibiting people from making complaints to
 the reception office of the CCP central committee and in
 using the excuse of "protection" to put people in jail;
 she had been unaware at the time that she was committing
 errors, had gone on in July to make more mistakes,  and
 had defended the record of the work-team throughout July;
 and so on.   Mme. Liu in this sel:P. -criticism gave credit
 to Chairman Mao personally--as Lin Piao was to do in his
 speech to the plenum in August--for discovering and re-
 versing the errors of the work-team.
 the picture presented by Chiang
 Ching in her November 1966 report.  The summary of her
 speech (all thus far available) has her saying that "the
 sending of cultural revolution wo.'k-teams to various
 organizations...was an error," and "what those work-
 teams had done in the course of their work was still
 more erroneous.   Instead of directing the spearhead against
 the handful of people in authority within the party who
 were taking the capitalist road and against the reaction-
 ary academic 'authorities,' they turned the spearhead
 against the revolutionary students.  The question of what
 the spearhead of the struggle should be directed against
 was a cardinal question of right and wrong..."

 But it will be noted that Chiang Ching does not
 assert that the work-teams had been directed--by Mao or
 anybody else--to support the "revolutionary students"
 as later defined, and Mme. Liu's account also indicates
 that there was no such directive.   Indeed, the very little
 evidence as to the roles of officers of the "cultural
 revolution group" in providing guidance at the time suggests
 that their guidance was little more militant than that
 of the conventional party apparatus.

 When the "group" was surfaced in early July, its
 principal figures were soon identified:   Chen Po-ta as
 the "head" or "leader," Chiang Ching as his first deputy,
 and Tao Chu and Kang Sheng as "advisors."  Chang Chun-
 chiao, a secretary of the Shanghai committee, was later
 identified as another deputy,  and Wang Jen-chung of the
 Central-South committee and Hupei committee and Liu Chih-
 chien of the General Political Department were still later
 (before their fall) identified as additional deputies.
 Other members (untitled) given during the fall by both
 official sources and wall-posters were Wang Li, i uan Feng,
 Chi Pen-yu,, Mu Hsin, and Yao Wen-yuan, all of them young
 writers and polemicists.   NCNA has also given Hsieh Tang-
 chung, a general officer who heads the cultural depart-
 ment of the General Political Department, and wall-posters
 have additionally given Chang Ping-hua of the Hunan com-
 mittee and some other provincial and regional figures who
 have not been confirmed.   It is not known how many of
 this lot--apart from Chen, Chiang, T.-,c, and Kang--were
 functioning as members of the "group' in July.

 n   e official account
 of proceedings in Fukien, the workers, peasants, and
 soldiers were acting as the "main force" in the revolu-
 tion; armed with Mao's fought, they were wiping out freaks
 and monsters; in the cities, while continuing their hard
 work in the factories, they wrote big-character posters
 in their off-duty hours, and criticized bourgeois ideas
 and customs, such as refusal to participate in manual
 labor; in rural areas, the poor and lower-middle peasants
 also wrote big-character posters, held meetings, exposed
 sabotage, denounced capitalist opportunism and church
 leaders, attacked old ideas, exposed and condemned bad
 books and music and drama,  and at the same time prepared
 to increase agricultural production.
 Most of the work-teams which had been sent to the
 cities in June were apparently withdrawn in July,  like
 the work-teams of the universities, other institutions of
 higher learning, technical schools, and middle schools.
 While the withdrawal of these teams from the cities has
 not been specified in any public statement, the 8 August
 declaration suggests that,  and so do statements by pro-
 vincial party leaders which appear to apply to all work-
 teams under their jurisdiction.  The picture as regards
 the countryside is least clear. It appears that the
 "socialist education" work-teams in the countryside were
 in general let alone, i.e. that they did not have "cul-
 tural revolution" work-teams superimposed on them.   And
 they were apparently not disbanded when the work-teams
 of June were disbanded; in one of his speeches in July
 and August, Chou En-lai
 said that the work-teams sent originally to the country-
 side (beginning in 1964) had done well, the implication
 being that they would remain.  Broadcasts of August made
 clear that "socialist education work teams" were still
 active in some places, and this was probably general.
 To return to the campuses, where the "revolution
 seemed to be most advanced and militant,

 August.  These speeches may have come immediately after

 The various accounts of the content .)f the spee-Iles
 of other leaders agree that the party leaders again a_
 gized for the work-teams of June--not just for the "mi.-
 ;akes" made by the work-teams, but for the top-level m,l,s-
 takes of sending in teams from the outside in the first
 place, and without clear directives.  According to a fa.:.rly
 full account of Chou's 4 August speech (made at Tsinghua)
 Chou described the "send-   25X1
 ing of work-teams" as a "policy mistake" an attitude he
 shared, he said, with Li IIsueh-feng (the first secretary
 of the new Peking committee, which had organized and dis-
 patched the work-teams in June.** Specifically, Chou is
 said to have continued,   when the educational institutions had

 said that the party center (including himself) had not
 adequately prepared the work-teams, in particular had not
 given them clear directives.   Ironically, he went on to
 say--as did others briefing the students in August and
 September--that they must work out their problems for
 themselves, in other words that they were still not to
 get clear directives.

 asked for replacement of the party organs named by the
 old (discredited) Peking committee, "we hurriedly decided"
 to send the work-teams and "failed to consider carefully
 what the work-teams' basic tasks were" to be.   (Chiang
 Ching was later to formulate the problem the same way,
 criticizing those who did this, contrary--she alleged--to
 Mao's instructions.)  Moreover, Chou said, the "party's
 policy was not clearly stated" to the work-teams--another
 indication that the work-teams did not have clear direc-
 tives to support the leftists.  The work-teams in practice
 had adopted an "administrative" attitude and had ordered
 people about, rather than following the "mass line" of
 disQussion.   In sum, Chou said, if the party did not
 carry out the three duties defined by Chairman Mao as
 "struggling, criticizing, and reforming, "* if it failed
 to concentrate revolutionary forces to struggle against
 the "main target' (another formulation echoed four days
 later) but instead dissipated its forces in looking for
 "mistakes" and in "making trouble" among the students
 and other revolutionary forces, it would be committing
 a serious error in "direction."**
 Chou reportedly went on to state his favor for free-
 don: of expression for the students Kuai Ta-fu and Liu
 Chuan, but to state also that he disagreed with their
 expressed views.  This was of some importance, as these
 students--still not "rehabilitated" as of early August--
 were later identified as the leaders of the most militant
 elements of the Red Guards in Peking, those who were'to

 **According 'to her later self-criticism, Mme. Liu Shao-
 clii, who had been removed from the Tsinghua work-team
 just the day before (3 August), had committed errors of
 this kind.   No version of Chou's speech indicates that
 Chou included any criticism of Mme. Liu personally.

 lead physical attacks on party and government installations
 and to lead the poster attacks on many party leaders.
 C1.iou reportedly went on to apologize on behalf of
 the central committee for the "mistakes" of the work-
 teams, and to state expressly that the mistakes must not
 be attributed entirely to tEa new Peking committee (al-
 though,                               he said, mistakes made in the course of the work
 were their responsibility).  Chou then returned to the
 point that "wee" (of the party leadership) were primarily
 to blame for failing to define the correct (militant)
 line, for having "poured cold water" on the mass movement
 out of "fear" (a phrase much used later).*
 Red Flag was to say much the same thing, in summary
 form, on 21-Kugust:  that "during a short period, mistakes
 were discovered in the orientation and guidelines" of the
 cultural revolution, and that Mao Tse-tung at that moment
 "personally" sketched out the 16-point decision revealed
 on 3 August.
 This 8 August declaration of the central committee--
 presented under 16 rubrics--was a curious document, a
 lumpy mixture of militant and cautionary elements, mainly
 militant.   It was interpreted otherwise by many or most
 observers at the time--that is, as mainly an effort to
 put the revolution in order, to set some limits to the
 -weep for enemies, to gain control over the entire process.
 This was not an unreasonable interpretation,  in the light
 of the disorder,  the proliferating and apparently senseless
 violence of the previous two months, and the potential
 of the released monster for damaging if not destroying
 its creator; and it was that in part; but in fact the
 *Chiang ZIiing 7I4. & . Mao) spoke at a Red Guard "debate"
 two days later and emphasized one of the points Chou had
 made--namely, that the students should concentrate their
 energies on the struggle against enemies (in the party),
 and not dissipate them in quarrels among themselves.   In
 other words,  Rune. Mao, like Chou, at that time refrained
 from stating the party leadership's favor for one-Red
 v'iard faction over another.  A lesser figure of the cul-
 tural revolution group--Kuan Feng--took the same line in
 a speech on 2 August.

 declaration was followed by the wildest period in recent
 Chinese history.*  The document--which appears in retro-
 spect to have been written deliberately to justify both
 a militant course (particularly in the short run) and
 periodic retreats from it as the campaign developed,
 and the final version of which was said by a party secre-
 tary later as having been approved by Mao himself--is
 worth considering in some detail.   It remains the basic
 document on the conduct of the "revolution."
 The 8 August declaration reiterated that the party's
 long-term aim was to change the "moral outlook of the
 whole (Chinese) society," and, to'this end, its "present"
 aims were to bring down those "in authority /in the party7
 who follow the capitalist road" and the "bourgeois reac-
 tionary 'authorities'" in the academic community,, to
 criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideology, and to
 n  escr   ng   a  ocuments as "mainly militant," the
 present writer, who did not see the document until several
 weeks after the fact and some weeks after the Red Guards
 had been turned loose, cannot be sure that he would have
 described it this way at the time. I'?% is surely true,
 even in hindsight, that there is nothing in the declara-
 tion which would permit any observer to predict the Red
 Guards.  Nevertheless, an effort has been made to read
 this document, like others, as if one were reading it at
 the time of its publication, in order to get the best
 possible sense of the consistency or inconsistency of
 the signals which Peking has been giving its audience
 throughout the?"cultural revolution"; this is important
 in order to judge whether certain curious developments
 have reflected disagreement among party leaders, the
 sending of false signals, or the sending of correct
 signals which have been misread.

 transform education and the arts.*  "Revolutionary youths"
 we:1e presented as the "brave path-breakers" in conducting
 the revolution, with their big-character posters and
 "vigorous debates"--youths who inevitably had "certain
 shortcomings" but whose "main revolutionary direction
 has been correct."
 The declaration conceded "fairly strong" resist-
 ance to the revolution, and called for this to be attacked
 in '.'a spirit of 'daring, "'  a spirit which was to be "put
 above everything else."  As for the party leadership
 being provided, the declaration went on to classify "party
 organizations" at all levels as (a) the "daring" and thus
 "correct";  (b) the conservative and lagging;  (c) those
 who feared exposure of themselves but would be "excused"
 if they accepted it; and (d) the true bourgeois represen-
 tatives, "extremely afraid," who had tried to suppress
 the revolution; those of this latter class were to be
 dismissed from their posts, although it was not clear
 just when this was to be done.
 After asserting that the party "should not fear
 disorder," invoking Mao himself for the proposition that
 a revolution "cannot be gentle," and calling upon the
 masses to "make the fullest use of big-character posters
 and great debates," the declaration stated in strong
 language that "all forces must be concentrated to strike
 at the handful of ultra-reactionary bourgeois rightists
 and counter-revolutionary revisionists," and, again,
 that the "main target  of the present movement" was to
 be those "in the party who follow the capitalist road."
 The declaration did, however, ask that care be taken to
 distinguish hard-cases in the party from those who had
 simply made errors,. and "reactionary" academics from
 ordinary academics, and pointed out that diverse opinions
 among the masses were to be expected, that reasoning and

 not force siiould be used (with the "masses"), and that
 minority views (among them) were to be tolerated.   Mao
 himself was given credit,  in wall-posters seen in Sep-
 tember, for inserting the phrase about reasoning instead
 of coercing.
 The declaration then switched back to the question
 of the proper attitude, (particularly on the part of party
 officials) toward  revolutionaries.   it noted that "re-
 sponsible persons of certain schools, units and work-teams
 have been launching counter-attacks against the masses"
 (i.e., had resisted attacks by the revolutionaries), even
 contending that "opposition to them /elves7 means opposi-
 tion to the CCP central committee"; this kind of discour-
 agement of revolutionaries was said to be "absolutely
 impermissible."  It vent on to warn both "anti-party ele-
 ments" and erring officials against describing elements
 of the masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and to warn
 in strong terms against inciting the masses or students
 to fight among themselves (although there was to be much
 of this later), noting that "even proven rightists" in
 these groups would be dealt with at a later stage of the
 movement.
 The declaration went on to classify party cadres
 in categories analogous to those used to describe the
 types of leadership being provided in the revolution:
 the good, the comparatively good (whose mistakes were
 small), those who had made serious mistakes but were
 not anti-party rightists,  and the "small number" of
 anti-party rightists who must be "fully exposed" and
 "pulled down."   In an odd ambiguity, this paragraph
 went on to say that even these elements "should be given
 a way out so that they can turn over a new leaf"--a
 passage which could be read, as a passage in Lin Piao's
 speech to the central. committee plenum in the same week
 could be read, as promising even these elements an op-
 portunity to reform and keep their posts, but which seems
 in the context of other pronouncements to have been offer-
 ing them little more than a chance to keep their lives.

 The 8 August declaration went on to inform the
 country that "cultural revolution groups, cultural revo-
 lution committees, and cultural revolution congresses"
 had been found to be "excellent new forms of organiza-
 tions by which the masses become educated under the party's
 ?            leadership" (i.e. for the conduct of the purge and re-
 indoctrination),  "organs of power" for the cultural revo-
 lution, intended as "long-term, permanent mass organiza-
 tions-suitable for schools and government organizations"
 and also "basically suitable for factory and mining enter-
 prises, neighborhoods, and the countryside."  The members
 of these groups and committees, and delegates to their
 congresses, were to be elected locally (i.e., not simply
 appointed, like the first committees of April and May,
 and not--even worse--appointed by outsiders and sent
 down, like the work-teams of June);  it was further stated
 that the "masses may at any time criticize" the members
 of these groups, and that members found "unfit" could be
 replaced.   (This last provision, for criticism and replace-
 ment, was later to give a handle to the Red Guards in
 attacking,  inter alia, the new cultural revolution groups
 of some of the provincial and municipal party committees.)*
 *The party apparatus--presumably directed in this in-
 stance by the "group in charge o.-&O the cultural revolu-
 tion" at the party center--moved quickly to establish the    25X1
 new cultural revolution committees and groups.

 Further, the 8 August declaration reviewed the
 task of transforming the educational system--that is,
 getting rid of the domination of "bourgeois intellect-
 uals," combining education with labor, shortening and
 simplifying the courses, and so on.*  It went on to
 speak of the question of criticizing the "bourgeois
 'authorities'" (of the academy and of the party) by
 name in the press.  This actionit said, should first
 be discussed by party committees of those levels and
 in some cases cleared by higher party levels.
 The declaration, after steering the revolution-
 aries away from scientists and technicians, discussed
 "linking up" the cultural revolution with the "socialist
 education" movement in urban enterprises and rural areas.
 Where the socialist education movement--a less sharply-
 focused and less ambitious campaign--was proceeding
 smoothly,  it said, it should not be disturbed.   However,
 suitable occasions could be found for "discussing" ques-
 tions related to the cultural revolution, and in some
 places the latter could be used to stimulate the other
 campaign,  if the local party committees approved.
 The declaration noted briefly that it ought to be
 possible to carry out the "cultural revolution" without
 interfering with production,  and that both socialist
 education and the cultural revolution in the PLA were to
 be carried on in accordance with directions from the Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee and the PLA General Political De-
 partment--i.e.,  not by either the conventional party ap-
 paratus or the new extraordinary cultural revolution
 *New violence on tTie campus was later reported to have
 erupted on this same day,  8 August.   In this incident,
 at Lanchow, students at an industrial college there beat
 up a number of other students in the presence of the
 police, who did not interfere.  This was not "Red Guard"
 activity, but action by "revolutionary students" who
 were apparently not organized or in any case not organized
 to that degree.

 apparatus.  The declaration concluded by waving the ban-
 ner of Mao's "thought" and listing specific works of
 Mao's as basic documents for party committees to study.
 In sum, the militant elements are the more impres-
 sive--the call for "daring" to be "put above everything
 else," the rating of party organizations by degrees of
 "daring," the specification not to fear "disorder," the
 insistence that "all forces must be concentrated to
 strike" at the rightists and revisionists, the specifi-
 cation that the "main target" was that of party officials,
 the failure to specify that force should no   a used
 against party officials, the warning to party and govern-
 ment officials not to resist,  and the specification that
 the rightists were to be "pulled down."  In other words,
 the Red Guards who were to attack party officials in
 late August and subsequently were correctly reading the
 8 August declaration.  Mao was inciting the revolution-
 ary young against the party apparatus, and, moreover,
 without giving them any clear criterion for distinguish-
 ing Tetween those loyal to Mao's thought and the disloyal
 who were to be "exposed" and "pulled down."

 The first commentary on the 8 August declaration--
 by Red Flag, broadcast on 10 August--described it as the
 "prTncipaT_document" of the cultural revolution. and as
 the result of a "scientific summary ...made under the
 personal supervision of Comrade Mao Tse-tung."  It reiter-
 ated the aims of the revolution and the presence of
 "relatively strong and persistent" resistance to it, and
 emphasized the need for "daring" leadership and for turn-
 ing the masses loose rather than preparing a script for
 them.    It spelled out the point that
 Experiences have indicated that each
 unit must carry out cultural revolution
 work by relying on its own masses and should
 not depend on arrangements by upper-level
 organs.   Under general conditions, each
 unit should carry out cultural revolution
 work without the help of work-teams dis-
 patched by upper-level organs.
 However, persons would sometimes be "assigned by upper-
 level organs to contact the masses"--presumably, directly
 assigned by Chen Po-ta's "group" in Peking--and these
 persons were not to act as "'special envoys"' or rush
 to make a determination but must be suitably humble be-
 fore the masses.   Red Flag echoed the 8 August declara-
 tion in asserting fiat tie effort now should "concentrate
 on ;:hose persons in authority within the party who have
 taken the path of capitalism"; and it spelled out the
 point in the declaration about criticism of officials by
 name.  The names of "middle of the road elements" (those
 still regarded as redeemable), the party journal said,
 "may be ment-.oned in big-character posters issued by their
 own units," but "so long as their names are not openly
 published in newspapers"--which would require official
 approval--and "they are allowed in the meantime to issue
 big-character posters to defend themselves," they need
 not regard themselves as condemned.*
 *In point of fact, the most important party leaders
 who had fallen had not been identified in the newspapers,
 but lower-level officials had been.

 At the time the 8 August declaration was published,
 a central committee "plenum"--with perhaps no more than
 half of the members actually attending--had been in ses-
 sion for a week, and was to continue until 12 August.
 It was apparent from developments in the week following
 12 August--the issuance of a communique on 13 August, the
 surfacing of a new ranking of Chinese Communist leaders,
 and the emergence of the Red Guards--that the plenum had
 seen the formal presentation of Mao's new team and had
 discussed the future course of the "cultural revolution."
 The tone of the communique, and the radical changes
 made in the leadership, raised the question of whether
 there had been a showdown in the plenum on policies for
 the "cultural revolution," a showdown which the militants--
 Mao and Lin and their supporters--had won.

 Some observers have attached importance to an odd
 circumstance in the reporting of Mao's visit on the eve-
 ning of 10 August to a "reception center" in Peking main-
 tained near the central committee headquarters for "revo-
 lutionary people."  On 10 August NCNA transmitted an ac-
 count of the visit which was presumably to appear in the
 11 August People's Daily; however, the first edition of
 the newspaper onTThe 11 h was withdrawn, and the paper
 appeared later in the day with no story about Mao.   On
 the same day, NCNA carried an account similar to its 10
 August transmission but reversing a reference which in
 the original version had named the central committee ahead

 o12 Mao in receiving expressions of regard from the masses.
 It was later reported that the newspaper's original ver-
 sion included a remark: from I,Iao that the party was losing
 touch with the masses (obviously his true feeling, and
 the root of the changes he had made, but something that
 could not be stated publicly in just that way).   And a
 visitor to China has speculat

 at Mao was
 "brought out" on this occasion by the "new mainstream
 faction" (the implication being that Mao was their pup-
 pet), and that "the Liu faction" (the now outsiders) re-
 called the issue of People's Daily which reported this
 (only to be reversed ancf suppressed the next day).   It
 seems unnecessary to reach very far for an explanation
 of the withdrawal.  There seems a sufficient explanation
 either in the reported  einark about the masses                 25X1
 or in the differences b
 t

 e two texts.   The second text is hardly less idolatrous        25X1
 than the first (both accounts are ludicrous, like the
 accounts of Mao's swim) and even increase the numbers of
 those around Mao to "tens of thousands" and has the crowd
 expressing its "best love" for Mao instead of the earlier
 "vrarm feelings"; but the second text at a dozen points
 is a smoother and better job.   It is not surprising that
 the propaganda apparatus--particularly in the light of
 what had just happened to the old propaganda apparatus--
 should take pains to get a story about Mao 'right.'

 central committee of the program which he as Mao's first
 lieutenant intends to carry out for Mao, and defining for
 the central committee his relationship with Mao.*
 Lin's speech as reported shows him to identify him-
 self completely with Mao,  and to think in the same sim-
 listic terms, with the same visionary long-range goals.
 In the speech he begins by classifying people into "two
 kinds" down the line:   those who eagerly study Mao's
 thought, and those who do not (he specifies Lu Ting-i and
 his "gang"); those who attach great importance to (i.e.
 are obsessed by) political-ideological work,  and those
 who ignore it or even interfere with it (he fails to
 specify Lo Jui-ching); those who are energetic and make
 achievements (e.g. put up lots of big-character posters),
 even though they offend people and are attacked, and
 those who are inactive and conciliatory (e.g. put up
 few posters).  Thus, he goes on, the party must be re-
 organized according to the principles governing the cul-
 tivation of revolutionary successors stated by Chairman
 Mao (in the mid-1964 article  on "Khrushchev's Phoney
 Communism"), and "we"--referring perhaps to the politburo
 standing committee--have proposed, and Mao has agreed,
 to dismiss from their posts those who oppose Mao's thought,
 those who resist political-ideological work,  and those
 who lack revolutionary zeal.  Further, he says, "we" are
 now going to dismiss a number of people, promote a number,
 and keep a number in their posts.  Those who make mistakes,
 f *T11I -la  er pare the speech at first seemed hard
 to accept at face value, not because of the relationship
 defined in it but because it seemed inappropriate for
 Lin rather than Mao to define it, especiall   if Mao were
 present.
 Mao almost certainly had defined
 the relationship, in a brief earlier speech, mating clear
 to the central committee that Lin was now his designated
 successor and would be speaking for him henceforth, and
 that Mao may well have been absent from some sessions
 of the plenum.

 even serious mistakes, will be given a chance to be tested
 in future work, provided that they accept education and
 truly repent; but the incorrigible must be dismissed.
 (This was exactly the line taken in the 8 August declara-
 tion,  and with the same ambiguity as to just when the
 hard cases were to be dismissed.)   Unless this is done,
 Lin continues, the "stalemate" will. not be broken, as
 such people will carry out subversive activity "once
 trouble flares up."   (The reference to "stalemate" ap-
 pears in the context to mean a loss of momentum in the
 "cultural revolution," which was at that t:';ie in a trough,
 rather than to designate a situation of "stalemate"
 between or among contending factions at the top of the
 party preventing any further action.)
 In his speech as reported, Lin goes on to define
 his own role.   In the best Chinese style, he speaks of
 his talents as unequal to his task, of the possibility
 that he will make serious mistakes or even fail, and of
 the need to rely on Mao, the standing committee, and the
 cultural revolution group.   He insists on the need to do
 everything according to Mao's thought, and implies strongly
 that one group in the party--one would think, Liu and
 Teng and others--had been acting contrary to Mao's known
 will:
 There cannot be two policies or
 two command headquarters.  No wishful
 thinking can replace the thinking of
 the Chairman, and we cannot stage
 a rival drama in competition with the
 Chairman.  We want monism...
 Lin goes on to define his relationship with Mao.
 He says that there are "many ideas we do not understand,"
 that "we" must carry out Mao's directives, that he asks
 Mao for instructions on everything and does everything
 according to his orders, that he does not "interfere"
 with Mao on major matters and does not trouble him with
 min':)r matters, and that sometimes he does not understand
 what Mao wants and therefore makes mistakes.  He goes
 on to describe Mao as the "genius of the world revolu-
 tion," to speak of the "wide gulf between him and us,"

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 to reiterate a modest assessment of his own talents, but
 to state his willingness to accept thu "decision" of Mao
 and the central committee.*
 In his speech as reported, Lin then speaks directly
 to the "cultural revolution group" present at the plenum.
 He speaks of the movement as having begun with vigor, but
 then having "cold water poured on it"--an obvious refer-
 ence to the interval dominated by the work-teams.   Mao
 himself, Lin goes on,  "reversed the situation"--meaning,
 presumably, called for the withdrawal of the work-teams
 and their replacement by cultural revolution groups.   He
 reiterates the abiding aim of transforming men, the
 expectation of numerous struggles and reversals, and the
 necessary progress through many stages to achieve both
 spiritual and material ends.  He praises the role of the
 "cultural revolution group" and again criticizes its
 precedessors (implying an intention to stick the party-
 machine leaders, demoted at the plenum, with the respon-
 sibility), and concludes resoundingly that Mao's thoughts
 are the pearls among the fish-eyes.
 The 13 August communi4ue of the plenum was less
 informative than the above account of Lin's speech, al-
 though consistent with it.   It noted the plenum's "full"
 *The ' cecision'Was presumably that of naming Lin the
 party's only vice-chairman and thus designating him the
 successor.   In regard to the self-deprecating formulations,
 Lin could be expected
 to speak in this Chinese way no matter what the relation-
 ship between Mao and himself, and some have read the speech
 as a crafty and cynical description of manipulation of
 Mao by Lin:  ''I handle the minor matters and I see that
 no major matters come up.'  The other interpretation--that
 Lin is describing his situation frankly--gives a more
 credible picture:   of Lin in awe of Mao, conscious of
 the difficulties of his new role, and trying to do what
 Mao wants but not always being able to, because for one
 thing Mao does not always make it clear and for another
 changes his mind, so that Lin has to accept the respon-
 sibility for "mistakes."

 approval of a "series of brilliant policies...put forward
 by Comrade Mao" since 1962, mainly related to the cultural
 revolution, and described these as an "important develop-
 ment of Marxism-Leninism."  Like the 8 August declaration,
 it emphasized the need for "daring" in the conduct of the
 revolution, and said flatly:   "Don't be afraid of disorder."
 It reiterated that the masses were to be turned loose,
 not "blindly" ordered about, and called for support of
 the "revolutionary left."  And it included praise of the
 "brilliant example" set by Lin Piao and the PLA in the
 study of Mao's thought.*
 On 16 August, Chen Po-ta, always regarded as' a
 spokesman for Mao, spoke to a mass meeting of students
 in Peking.   Although the Red Guards had still not appeared
 on the public scene, Chen's speech, not published until
 the Red Guards had been sutf aced, was in effect the first
 of a series of interviews given the Red Guards by officers
 of tiia "c'11tural revolution group" and by Chou En-lai,
 interviews in which groups of Red Guards were given
 a few general directives.  Chen's directive was very
 general in this case.   Implying an expectation (like Lin
 Piao at the plenum) of considerable resistance, he called
 on the students to "smash all kinds of monsters," spoke
 of the value to them of passing through "storms and hard-
 ship" and the "big revolutionary furnace," and asserted
 Tn commen 1ng on        a 8 August declaration before the
 communique appeared, People's Daily on 11 and 13 August,
 and the Liberation Army Daily' on     August, differed in
 their emphases.  This party newspaper did not emphasize
 daring and did emphasize "moral force instead of physical
 force," while the PLA paper called for "absolute reliance
 on the left faction of the revolution."  There was and
 continued to be speculation, given some support in the
 differences of emphasis in the speeches of the two lead-
 ers, that the former spoke for Chou En-lai and other
 possible "moderates," and the latter for Lin Piao (repre-
 senting Mao) and other apparent "militants."

 that their lack of fear was "very correct: ! !"   (The triple
 emphasis is in the Chinese account.)  He called upon them
 to "immerse" themselves in the masses and, to study "Mao's"
 program for the cultural revolution.  He concluded that
 in making a revolution,  "it is necessary to rely on our-
 selves."   ("Revolutionary students" and Red Guards were
 later to assert that the party leadership had told them
 that they were the only forces that the revolution could
 rely on.)            -
 As of mid-August,  then, the picture seemed fairly
 clear.   A militant cultural revolution would continue,
 and would now turn to the party apparatus across the
 board, led by the "group in charge of the cultural revo-
 lution" and its subordinate bodies, and making much use
 of "revolutionary students."  It was not at all apparent,
 however, that these students were to be organized as
 uniformed "Red Guards" and encouraged to throw China into
 the worst disorder in the 17 years of the Peking regime.
 Mid-August to Mid-September:  The Unleashing of the Red
 Guards
 The Red Guards made their first public appearance
 on 18 August at a million-strong rally in Peking, a rally
 which featured an appearance by Mao Tse-tung in army uni-
 form, speeches by Lin Piao and Chou En-lai, and a new
 line-up of party leaders which displayed Mao's  'close
 comrade" Lin as Mao's anointed successor.*
 Before considering this new factor of the 1 red
 Guards," the little available information on their
 *NZiracuTously; rye cI`'ing does not give Mao credit for
 creating the Red Guards--only for recognizing their
 value when he "discovered" their existence.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 antecedents may be summarized.*  A Red Guard who was in-
 terviewed in ;September stated that there had been "talk"
 about forming the Red Guards as early as late May, and
 that a detachment was first organized at the middle-school
 attached to Tsinghua university in Peking.  Red Guards
 interviewed in Peking in October said the same thing,
 specifying 29 May as the date of organizing and naming
 the group at Tsinghua.  Peking itself at the same time
 offered the same story, stating that this particular
 unit--now operating as the "Red Guard Unit of the Peking
 Militant School of Red Guards"--was "among the pioneers"
 and was organized in May. Some degree of confirmation
 is also available from wall-posters published in Red Flag,
 posters written by the Red Guard unit at Tsinghua W ic-T-'
 indicate that it had been in en,istence there at least since
 24 June.
 Obviously some time was required for the organiza-
 tion and outfitting of the Red Guards before their massive
 *fe TTecd- cards came as a complete surprise to observ-
 ers of the Chinese scene.   Although several observers had
 a creditable record in forecasting many of most   but in
 no case all) of the spectacular developments--i.8. the
 party purge, the extension of the purge to the top level,
 the downfall of 1'eng Chen and Lo Jui-ching as individuals,
 the decline of Liu Shao-chi and the rise of Lin Piao and
 a new team,  anti the early break-up of the leadership group
 being presented by Poking as a harmonious unit as late
 as late July--not a single one of the hundreds of steady
 observers of the Chinese scene forecast the Red Guards.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 and disciplined appearance in Peking on 18 August
 A wall-poster published in August in the Chinese
 press also helps to fix the time; this poster, dated 27
 July, attributed to a high-school attached to Tsinghua
 (the point of origin asserted by the Red Guards themselves),
 and calling for "revolutionary rebellion" against, "hyster-
 ical gentlemen"n power, has been treated by Peking as
 if it had been the opening gun for a nation-wide organiza-
 tional effort,
 As for the 18 August rally at which the Red Guards
 first appeared publicly, while the NCNA account of the
 rally maintained continuity with the central committee's
 8 August decision by reporting that Chen Po-ta of the
 "cultural revolution group" presided, it also reported
 that "'Red Guards', composed of the most active, bravest
 and Firmest of the revolutionary students, packed the
 reviewing stands," that many were dressed in khaki with
 red armbands (and that Mao himself wore such an armband),
 and that these "revolutionary students" described them-
 selves as "'Red Guards' for the defense of the party
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 central committee, Chairman Mao, and Mao Tse-tung's
 thought.*  It also reported the speeches of Lin and Chou,
 in which both incited the audience to carry through the
 cultural revolution (Lin's was the more obsequious to
 Mao and militant toward everybody else) and in which
 neither saw fit to say a word about the role of the "cul-
 tural revolution group" (instead, Chou slipped in a lit-
 tle praise of Lin Piao).   Both of these speeches, like
 Chen Po-ta's speech of 16 August, qualified as directives
 to the Red Guards in very general terms.**
 At this 18 August rally, Peking published the new
 standings of party leaders in the form of a name-list of
 those attending.   Mao of course appeared as number one,
 but followed now by Lin Piao, Chou En-lai, Tao Chu, Chen
 Po-ta, Teng Ilsiao-ping, Kang Sheng, and Liu Shao-chi.
 In other words, Lin had displaced Liu as second-ranking
 leader and Liu had slid all the way to eighth place
 (probably not even that, really); Chou had remained number
 three; Tac Chu, the new director of the propaganda depart-
 ment and one of the leaders of the "cultural revolution
 group," had leaped all the way from the second level (a
 regional leader, ranking low in the central committee)
 AIao - 1-d_no  s care liis "thought" on 18 August.   Pelting
 itself has said that some of the students asked Mao to
 make a speech, but that Chou answered for him, pointing
 to the 3 August declaration, and the books of quotations
 they were carrying, as equivalent to a speech.   Some ob-
 servers were quick---too quick--to conclude that Mao was
 not being permitted to speak for himself.
 **In early November,
 C;ou in this speech had urged the youth to
 limit their activities to their own schools, and that this
 reflected a continuing dispute with Lin Piao over the
 use of the led Guards.   While subsequent speeches were
 to suggest possible differences between Lin and Chou,
 Chou's 13 August speech neither stated nor implied the
 limitation the correspondent purported to see.

 to fourth place on the top level and indeed to first place
 among functionaries of the party apparatus (Peking ma-.,
 have been signalling an intention to make Tao the secre-
 tary general, and it was soon reported that he would
 serve as Acting Premier in Chou's absences,  another job
 Tong had had); Chen Po-ta, head of the "cultural revolu-
 tion group" which seemed to have become the most impor-
 tant part of the party apparatus; had risen several notches
 to filth place;  Tong IIsiao-ping,  the secretary-general
 who had been head o.  the secretariat and thus the acti.ial
 director of the orthodox party apparatus  (i.e.,  less the
 special bodies like the "cultural revolution group") and
 who was regarded by some observers as having played an
 important role in carrying out Mao's purge of Peng Chen
 (a view that is still tenable)'  nominally retained his
 sixth position but now with an additional active leader
 between himself and the top and probably with his grip
 slipping from his key job; and Kang Sheng,  another leader
 of the "cultural revolution" group suspected of having
 resumed his duties with the secret police during the
 purge, moved up several places and into the elite.   In.
 sum, Lin Piao had had a great triumph; Chou En-lai had
 had a triumph (in holding to his position in such a tricky
 and dangerous period); the leaders of the "cultural revolu-
 tion group"--Chen, Tao and Kang--had had a great if rer-
 haus insecure triumph;  and the principal figures of the
 old party-machine, Liu and Tong,  had had a defeat, Liu a
 disastrous one, Teng a substantial one.
 It was surmised at the time that Liu and  (to a
 lesser degree) Teng had been demoted fv;.- some combination
 of the following reasons:  their actual or putative roles
 as "protectors" of Peng Chen in the past; the uneven per-
 formance of the party press                           (not fully in line until June)
 in the campaign against the "black gang" beginning the
 previous November; the retrospective "failure" of the work-
 teams in June; and opposition to,  or lack of cooperation
 in,  the superimposition of the "cultural revolution group"
 on the conventional party apparatus,  in particular the
 direction of the.-: activity of the "group" against the
 conventional apparatus  (as forecast by the 3 -;ugust
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 declaration and emphasized by the 10 August Red Flag).*
 This surmise was all right as far as it went;   ut there
 was soon to be reason to conclude that another big item
 on the list of charges was going to be that of opposi-
 tion--in the central committee plenum of 1-12 August--to
 the plans of Mao's new team for turning the Red Guards
 loose to terrorize, discredit, and (conceivably) wreck
 the conventional party apparatus as an entity.    The ques-
 tion that immediately presented itself, to those who had
 watched Liu and Tong build up the party machine over the
 years into what had seemed to be a powerful instrument
 responsive to themselves, was whether Liu and Teng would
 accept this defeat meekly, or whether they would instead
 try to rally what forces they could to resis-.; the new
 team (which in turn raised the question of whether they
 any longer had access to their old forces).
 A color film of the 18 August rally, shown in
 Hong Kong two months later and attended by officers of
 the U.S. Consulate General there, provided some valuable
 if fragmentary indicators as to Mao's status and health
 and relations between Mao and other leaders.  The U.S.
 observers were impressed by the youthful participants'
 "apparently sincere adulation" of Mao and the skillful
 exploitation of this feeling by speakers and cheerleaders,
 preparing the participants to "go out into the provinces
 energized and motivated to do battle against those-demons
 and monsters who oppose the thinking and will of Mao
 Tse-tung."  The Consulate General surmised that the demon-
 stration was also intended to make Mao's opponents in the
 leadership, both those in Peking and those seeking the
 films in the provinces, "feel hopelessly overwhelmed...,
 asking themselves:  who can oppose a leader who evokes
 such evident adulation and who controls a mechanism which
 can organize such a demonstration of mass support?"

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 U. S.  observers of the film reported further that
 Mao moved slowly but firmly, usually without assistance,
 and appeared in good health,  apart from his apparently
 poor vision.   He seemed alert but detached, and unrespon-
 sive to others.   (Others have reported this as Mao's
 "blind god" pose).   Nu did exchange words with Lin Piao,
 who thereupon made some changes in his printed speech
 with a pen, and also chattered briefly with Chou, but
 was not seen to have any exchange with other leaders.
 Lin Piao had a "ghostly" appearance but seemed otherwise
 vigorous.  Chou En-lai looked tired but performed smoothly.
 Tao Chu was the only other leader given the special treat-
 ment of being filmed standing alone.   Some others of the
 new team--Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng, Chiang Ching--were
 visible but much less prominent.
 Red Flag on 21 August reiterated that the principal
 targets oZ' the "great revolution" were the "reactionary
 academic 'authorities'.. . and bourgeois representatives
 within the party," and it went on to warn that any person
 who opposed Mao's thought or failed to implement it--"no
 matter how high his position, how old his standing,  and
 how great his 'fame l "--should be the object of a "struggle
 waged against him until he is dismissed from his official
 posts and functions."  This seemed to be cut to the mea-
 surements of Liu Shao-chi, and to reinforce the impres-
 sion that a number of other party leaders would be brought
 down before the purge had run its course.
 Another article in that 21 August number of Red
 Flag,  and a People's Daily article two days later, both
 suggested strongly  ha,   ie Red Guards were to be sent
 into action as quasi-military units against elements of
 the party apparatus at the center and against its regional,
 provincial and municipal bureaus.   The implication through-
 out was that the Red Guards had been formed in order to
 organize the "revolutionary students" in a uniform way,
 giving them the kind of charter and propaganda support
 which would deter local authorities from organizing resist-
 ance to them.   Both articles seemed to incite the Red
 Guards to make physical attacks on their targets, and
 especially on party organizations.   The Red Flag piece,
 persistently describing the "revolutionary you is" as

 "lighters," jeered at the "overlords in power" who were
 "shaking with fear."   It went on to emphasize that the
 "young lighters" had the "backing of Chairman Mao, "* and
 described their task as precisely that of "rnaking trouble,"
 bringing down "all the old ideas, culture, customs and
 habits" (soon to be known as the 'four olds').  Young
 people, the article went on, were the "most resolute"
 in following Mao's instructions, and had "by far the
 greatest love" for him.   Finally, the young were bold,
 daring to "defy the power of law, not vulgar politicians...
 The People's Daily for its part denounced a "stubborn
 faction" w is i is   "absurdly regarded the leadership of
 its own units as equivalent to that of the party central
 committee," reiterated that the party committees of un-
 specified areas and units had resisted the revolutionary
 students and in "some areas" had even organized the masses
 to struggle against the students,  and went on most ominously
 to declare that "the revolutionary student organizations,
 such as 'Red Guards,'  'Red Flag Fighting Teams,'** and
 others, are legitimate organizations" engaged in "legiti-
 mate revolutionary actions," and that anyone opposing
 these revolutionary actions "opposes Chairman Mao's teach-
 ings and the party central committee's decision."  In
 other words,  the party organizations marked as targets
 would have a choice between allowing the Red Guards to
 conduct violence against them or entering into armed war-
 fare with the representatives of Mao's new team:   on one
 hand,  and with the odds against them, the local figures
 of the old party apparatus and whatever local military
 forces they could muster,  and on the other Mao, Lin Piao

 time  (19 August) had told her personally that violence

 and the bulk of the )LP.,  and the "cultural revolution
 group" leaders recently projected into the inner circle.
 Shaped up that way,  if as though it would be an unequal,
 even if sometimes protracted, contort.
 Wall--posters in September spoke of an interview
 given visiting Rod Guards in Peking by Tao Chu on the
 day--21 August--of the ominous Rod Flag editorial.  Mater-
 ials received much later indicate tia  Tao gave several
 such interviews in late August,  and that other officers
 of the central "cultural revolution group" also gave
 such interviews--probably dozens.  The new team clearly
 regarded these personal talks as the best channel of
 communication with the Red Guards, as the conventional
 party apparatus was still staffed by officials who were
 themselves to be targets of Red Guard action.
 Accounts of the 21 August interview agree that Tao
 did not give the Red Guards particular targets,  and,  in
 response to their demands for action against particular
 party leaders, told them in effect that action was up to
 them.    The ;eptember posters said that Tao invited the
 Red Guards to give an account of the behavior of their
 local party committees, and told them that it was with-
 in                                                                         25X1
 their power to criticize and "change" their local
 party officials.
 Chou En-lai was prominent among those giving inter-
 views and making speeches to the Red Guards in this poriod,
 and there is a good wall-poster account of his speech at
 Tsinghua on 22 August.   Chou in this speech, lilce Lin Piao
 at the August plenum, began in the approved Chinese way
 by deprecating his own abilities,  and inviting further
 poster criticism of himself; he then proceeded authoritatively,
 as if he thought his position to be secure. He noted that the
 head of the former work-team at Tsinghua, who had made a self-
 criticism that same day, realized his errors, but he went

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 on to emphasizq as he had in his 4 August speechi  that
 the errors were "fundamental errors...in direction and
 line" which were not the responsibility of the work-
 teams alone but also of the central party leaders who
 dispatched the teams.   Citing the need for "speedy"
 action in Peking in late May, to correct the situation
 left by the "black gang," Chou said that the party had had
 a choice between sending in work-teams to regain the
 leadership or to rely on the local masses and risk "con-
 fusion," and chose the former course without due con-
 sideration.   Further,  the errors of the work-teams de-
 rived in large part from  the fact that they wore not
 given proper guidance.  Thus the larger errors were
 those of the new Peking committee and of  (unspecified
 organs or leaders of) the central committee.
 Chou in this speech went on to speak of the many
 millions of students throughout China who were not as
 "fortunate" as students in Peking,  because they had not
 "solved their problems there"--i.e., their party organi-
 zations and work-teams were making the same old (con-
 servative) errors,  often "even more errors" than had
 been made in Peking, injuring people and carrying out
 "white terrorism."  Because Mao could not go to all those
 places in person, Chou said (implying, as others were
 to state expressly,   that Mao had directly intervened in
 Peking),  the 8 August declaration had been prepared as
 guidance for the students.   .!s previously noted,  the 8
 August declaration was militant,  a.id had incited the
 students against the party organizations without giving
 them any particular guidance;  and Chou in this speech
 followed the same strategy.   He urged them to "rise up
 for the revolution," to "solve the problems yourselves,"
 and (speaking to visiting students) to "hurry home today
 with this fire."   Ile reiterated that "You can solve your
 problems by yourselves," and went on to imply that the
 provisional cultural revolution committee of Tsinghua,
 which had succeeded the work-team not more than three
 weeks earlier, had already criticized it:ielf for being
 too conservative  (a godindication that the students
 were reading the 8 August declaration as a militant
 directive.)

 Chou then answered questions, and made clear that
 the party leaders encouraged a wide range of student
 expression and of organizational activity (a point of
 importance,iri view of the variety of opinion already
 being expressed by, and of organizations already being
 formed by, the Red Guards). Chou encouraged the convention
 of all kinds of meetings for "debating," stated clearly
 that the students had "freedom of publication" (they
 could say anything they liked in their posters), identi-
 fied five different Red Guard organizations in Peking
 an.] said flatly that "any kind of organization is all
 right," and reiterated that "as long as the general
 direction is correct, opinions can be exchanged even if
 they are different."
 Chou went on to ask the students to observe the
 long-professed party principle of "curing the disease
 and saving the patient," i.e., that the aim of the campaign
 was to re-educate and reform as many as possible of those
 in error, rather than to destroy them.   Speaking
 specifically of the discredited president and party
 leader  of Tsinghua, one found guilty of "following the
 capitalist road," Chou encouraged the students to struggle
 against him, but called upon them to make thorough prepara-
 tions, to carry out propaganda among the people until
 the ground was ready,  to ;o through the entire process
 of struggle, criticism and reform.   In these passages,
 Chou seemed to be saying that any additional important
 party figures--like the one just mentioned, who was still
 a member of the CCP central committee--who were to be
 purged would be purged much later,  after a prolonged
 campaign.   If this reading is correct, this too was an
 important point,  in view of the apparent failure of the
 party leaders in Peking to move against any of the party
 leaders denounced by the Red Guards in the weeks follow-
 ing the first attacks.
 There is no evidence that Chou En-lai or any of
 the officers of the "cultural revolution group"--the small
 number of party leaders reported as giving general directives
 to the Red Guards before they were sent into action--gave
 the Guards any better directives than -this.   In other
 words, there is no evidence that they were told to take

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 action against specific individuals already marked for
 purging--to take such action against provincial first
 secretaries, for example, as would provoke such indi-
 viduals to organize counter.-action which would serve as
 a pretext for replacing them.   If this is true,  if they
 were simply told to go into action, without any parti-
 cular targets and with no specific limitations placed on
 their actions, then Mao and his new team were making new
 tests--both of party and government officials and of the
 "revolutionary students" themselves; that is, the new
 team would be testing the revolutionary qualifications
 of the young and identifying those from whom the party's
 eventual leadership would be drawn, and testing the
 responses of the party seniors to these initiatives by
 the young,  and would be marking the examinations later.
 As of this time  (nearing late August) before the
 Red Guards were sent out, the conventional party apparatus
 had been hit hard only in one sector--the "cultural" sec-,
 tor, that is,  individuals concerned with the direction
 and management of propaganda,  education,  and the arts.
 About 80 important "cultural" figures had been publicly
 brought down*:   seven directors and managers of the cen-
 tral apparatus, including the onetime chief  (Peng Chen)
 of the first "cultural revolution group" and the director
 of the Propaganda Department (Lu Ting-yi); some seven
 members of the Peking committee of the party (the only
 regional,  provincial or major municipal committee which
 had been hit hard as a whole);  two deputy directors of
 departments of regional bureaus and two provincial secre-
 taries;  some 15 directors and deputy directors of pro-
 vincial propaganda departments; six editors; about 23
 administrators (presidents or vice-presidents) and
 *OnTy__a- efew par~gures who were not concerned with
 the management of some kind of "cultural" activity had
 fallen:   Lo Jui-ching, Yang Shang-kun (chief of the
 central committee's administrative office), Liu Jen (Peng
 Chen's first deputy), and Li Kuei (first secretary in
 Huehot,  Inner Mongolia).

 secretaries of party committees of institutions of higher
 learning; and about 17 officers of unions and federations
 of artists of various kinds and directors of governmental
 cultural bureaus.   About 50 of these were known to have
 had important party positions--the main categories excluded
 being those educators who were not concurrently secretaries
 of party committees, and the last category given above.
 The implication of the 21-23 August commentaries summarized
 above was that this figure of 50 was to be multiplied
 several times before the Red Guards were put back on the
 least'..
 While the party was preparing to send the Red Guards
 out into the streets, "cultural revolution committees"
 and subordinate "groups" wore being formed throughout
 China--as in effect had been directed in the central com-
 mittee's 8 August declaration--in those places were they
 bad not already been established in July.   Some of the
 schools took the trouble, on the occasion of "electing"
 these new committees (committees for universities, teams
 for smaller units),  to criticize publicly the two earlier
 forms of "cultural revolution" organization--the first
 groups appointed by the party committees, and the work-  25X1
 teams which supplanted them--as being inferior to these
 new bodies elected by and thus (it was.'implied) respon-
 sive to the masses.  Nevertheless, at least in the univer-
 sities, these new committees were in most cases identi-
 fied as "Provisional" committees
 just as the
 party secretaries who had fallen from favor were generally
 replaced by "acting" secretaries, the "provisional" com-
 mittees were clearly on probation.   There was consider-
 able ambiguity in the remarks made by party secretaries
 on these occasions.   While some chose to emphasize the
 role of the new committees and groups in "directing"
 and "giving instructions" and asserted that they must
 "boldly lead" the revolution, others chose to underline
 the point that the committees were to "give free rein
 to the masses," that the universities were to be "run by
 the revolut4.onary teachers and students," and so on; some
 of the chairmen of the newly-elected committees and
 groups picked up this last point, being quoted as promising
 to "run" the school in a worthy f as hioAe . g. to "foster
 reliable proletarian successors."

 The emergence of the Red Guards,  and some of the
 remarks quoted above,  raised the question of just what
 degree of authority the new committees were, really to
 have.      They were apparently--as "organs of power" given
 charters by the central coi,imittee and as bodies elected
 expressly to "lead the masses"--to be at least nominally
 in command of the Rid Guards, while they were apparently
 to EF-a-f-Teast nominally responsive to the "revolutionary
 teachers and students" among w iom  'le Red Guards had just
 been identified as the best element.   And the "revolution-
 ary students and teachers" were apparently to have no re-
 lation whatever to the young Communist League, which had
 not been mentioned for weeks and the leaders of which
 were evidently in trouble.   It appeared that the party
 center--probably meaning in practice, the "cultural revo-
 lution group"--could avoid chaos only by giving the "cul-
 tural revolution" units and the Red Guards and other
 students identical orders concurrently, so that the Former
 could "order" and the latter could "demand" the same
 actions at the same time.*  But there was no way to sort
 this out at the time; one could only wait to see what
 would happen.
 There was not long to wait.   At just about this
 time, beginning 20 August in Peking and a few other placed
 and a iew days later in most places, the Red Guards began
 to appear in the streets of China's cities, and proliferated
 in the last week of August.  For the first few days, their
 activities were reported by both Communist and non-Communist
 media as a kind of dull-witted, humorless Hallowe'en,
 directed against everything on the scene regarded as
 "feudal, capitalist, or revisionist" .(i.e., traditional,

 Western or Soviet).   As reported,  they put up posters,
 made speeches,  shouted denunciations,  changed the names
 of streets, markets, schools, hotels, temples, theatres,
 parks and lakes, tore down shop signs, defaced churches,
 and took similar direct action against both the possessors
 and the suppliers of offens4.ve  (non-proletarian) food
 and clothing, hair-styles and cosmetics, books and maga-
 zines, photographs and paintings and objets d'art, and
 so on.   They were rewarded at once with an editorial in
 People's Daily, "Very Good Indeed:"--and by other s'ach
 editorials  n those first days.
 Observers in Peking began on 25 August to report
 incidents of brutality by the Red Guards there--scenes
 of "street punishment," in which the victims were placed
 in a circle and beaten with belts or cords, or were beaten
 on the street and dragged into houses, as well as much
 parading of victims around the streets.  On 28 August,
 posters in Peking reportedly asserted that several Red
 Guards had already been killed by "counter-revolution-
 aries.,"  From such posters  (reported later),  a picture
 emerged of. violence from the start (i.e.,  immediately
 after 13 August) at some places, and of widespread violence
 in the last week of August.   In Peking, whe~e the Red
 Guards had a free hand, the victims of their raids, beat-
 ings, torture,  and assignments to slave labor, although
 primarily teachers,  included party and government offi-
 cials, one an officer of the "cultural revolution" section
 of a municipal cultural bureau; this last was the first
 reported attack by Red Guards on a subordinate unit of
 the "cultural revolution group" from which they were sup-
 posed to be getting their orders.*  They also  (in Peking)
 *    should  e  tTep-tin mind, however, that action by
 the fled Guards s.gainst any given cultural revolution com-
 mittee or team does not necessarily imply refusal to
 recognize the authority of the central "cultural revclu-
 tion group."  All of the local committees and teams were
 to be "elected" locally,  and could be replaced if found
 unfit;  if thi3 local cultural revolution committee or group
 were in fact selected and dominated by a party secretary
 who was himself unfit,  it would follow that the cultural
 revolution groupwould also be unfit,  and that the Red
 Guards would be hostile to the group as well as the man.

 raided the apartments of senior party members, tearing
 up their clothing and throwing their furniture into the
 street.   Some executions  (although not of party officials)
 were surmised, and "many suicides" reported.   In Tientsin
 (not far away), Red Guards from Peking reportedly beat
 up a municipal o.ficial and people who came to his aid
 (including women),  beat up many other people in other
 incidents,  killed a teacher and perhaps others,  and (on
 26 August) fought with a "Red Corps" organized by the
 Tientsin committee of the CCP; this last was the first
 report of elements being organized by local party offi-
 cials to repel the Red Guards.   (Peking later reported
 the death on 10 September---from "heart attack"--of the
 First Secretary of the Tientsin committee;  a correspondent
 reported that the death was really the result of a beat-
 ing by Red Guards.)   There were soon reports from other
 parts of China of attacks by Peking students on student
 bodies elsewhere, of threats made by them against offi-
 cials of "cultural revolution teams," of similar attacks
 by local students on local people, and of resistance to
 the Red Guards by a locally-organized "Red Corps" or by
 local crowds apparently responding to local party leaders.
 In' the most sensational single development of that
 last week of August, the Poking regime publicly reported
 through the Harbin radio on 27 August that a meeting had
 been held by "revolutionary" people in Ileilungkiang to
 denounce a "black gang" within "loading groups" of the
 IIeilungkiang provincial committee of the CCP (a meeting
 chaired by an alternate secretary of that committee it-
 self), and then on 20 ,:,.ugust that the Red Guards of
 various Harbin schools had held a "rally to burn down
 the provincial CCP committee and shell the command head-
 quarters"*  (a meeting addressed by a secretary of the
 .Northeast regional bureau of the party).   The provincial
 *This "she ling'   as later defined as ferreting out the
 "bourgeois careerists," but one report of the same period
 states that R( d Guards actually set fire to one municipal
 party committee headquarters in Hunan.

 committee was evidently one of those which _,ad organized
 resistance against the Red Guards  (possibly splitting
 off some of the Red Guards themselves),  as the resolution
 adopted by the rally asserted that local counter-revolu-
 tionaries had "put on arm-bands and called themselves Red
 Guards" and had carried out a "fight against the revolu-
 tionaries"; further, the resolution called for a reorgani-
 zation of the local Red Guards and for the coordination
 of student activity in the suture.   In attacking the pro-
 vincial committee in this fashion, those naming the target
 and directing the fire--presumably the "cultural revolu-
 tion group" in Peking and those local officials still in
 their favor--were making good on their recent threats to
 incite the Red Guards against the party apparatus.
 In all the agitation in Peking at that time (the
 last 12 days of August), the most interesting develop-
 ment was not reported at the time and not in detail until
 three months later--tile splitting of the Red Guard move-
 ment into hostile factions, which physically clashed with
 one another, and which were alleged by elements of the
 Guards to be carrying out the will of different groups
 in the top leadership.  The information on this develop-
 ment which became available from wall-posters in. November
 merits a summary.

 The Red Guards in Peking began to polarize soon
 after their original organization there, even before the
 Red Guard movement was revealed on 18 August;
 / On 11 August the decision to remove the work-team
 was announced, and this, perhaps together with Chen Po-
 ta's militant speech of 16 August,  apparently emboldened
 the sympathizers or supporters of Kuai Ta-fu to agree in
 a meeting of 17 August to demand his reinstatement. This

 set the stage for the "incidents" of 19 and 24 August
 in which there were physical clashes between the left-
 ists and another group which was no less aggressive in
 pursuit of its aims but more nearly "moderate" in its
 attitude on the issue in contention--namely, whether to
 attack central party leaders openly, especially Liu Shao-

 forces, which put up counter-posters and raised the issue
 of the propriety of public attacks on central party lead-
 ers.

 again at Tsinghua and incited the revolutionary students

 anything they liked in their wall-posters, to "debate"
 in this way, and to form as many kinds of Red Guard
 ?            organizations as they cared to.  This apparently gave
 fresh encouragement both to the leftists and to the
 moderates at Tsinghua.

 September:   The Subsidence of the Red Guards
 In late August Mao's new team in Peking had given
 an appearance of concern about those aspects of Red Guard
 activity which were getting or might get out of hand, al-
 though evidence was lacking that Mao and his new team
 up to that time had wanted it any more in hand than it
 had been.   (In other wor s, Mao and the new team had
 wished to have a large degree of disorder,  had in fact
 ca  a  upon the young revolutionaries not to fear dis-
 order, had seen this as essential in order to terrorize
 the populace and in particular to strike fear into party
 functionaries, and now, having made their point, were
 willing to assert falsely that the Red Guards had exceeded
 their instructions.)
 on 28 August People's Daily--in
 an editorial entitled "Revolutionary Young  eoopl e Should
 Learn from the PLA"--had called for greater discipline.
 Noting that Mao himself had originally issued this call,
 the party newspaper asserted that the Red Guards and
 "other revolutionary organizations" had been established
 with the PLA as their ;yodel, and asked them to "learn
 still better from the PLA" to carry out the "throe main
 rules of discipline and the eight points for attention"
 stipulated by Mao, to "adhere to mass discipline," and
 to defend the "people's interests" and "state property."
 it pointed out that the 8 August declaration had called
 for reasoning, not coercion or force, and said--as the
 8 August declearation had not--that this was applicable
 even to "those in authority who are taking the capitalistic
 road" (i . e . , even to the party figures previous identi-
 fied as the main targets).   In other words, now that the

 commentaries, the party leaders could retreat for a while
 into one of the cautionary provisions of the declaration.
 Lin Piao and others of the new team were soon to call more
 clearly for discipline--a discipline which if effected
 would permit the Red Guards to be used in a more orderly
 way, over the long term,  against a  narrower range of tar-
 gets.
 On 31 August there was another huge rally of "revo-
 lutionary teachers and students" in Peking,  in which Mao
 had the starring roles.   Mao arrived a~ the rally in the
 first car, accompanied by Lin, Ho Lung (another old-time
 military leader and officer of the Military Affairs Com-
 mittee), Hsieh Fu-chih (still Minister of Public Security,
 despite th,., fact that he had been a protege of Teng Hsiao-
 ping),  and Yang Cheng-wu                             (conunander of the Peking head-
 quarters of the PLA);  there seems no doubt that Mao in-
 tended in this way to emphasize the degree to which the
 new team united and rested upon the regime's instruments
 of force.   In the second car were the third and fourth-
 ranking leaders, Chou En-lai and Tao Chu, along with
 Chiang Ching (Mao's wife) and another party leader (not
 Chen Po-ta, fifth-ranking, who was missing, but Nieh
 Jung-chen,  a new figure in the inner circle).   Back in
 the third car were the demoted leaders of the old party
 apparatus,  Llu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 The rally was opened by Chiang Ching in her capacity
 as first "deputy head of the cultural revolution group,"
 and was apparently presided over by her (thus maintained
 continuity, as Chen Po-ta had presided over the first rally).
 Lin Piao and Chou En-lai again made the speeches.*  Lin 25X1

 strongly praised the contribution of the Red Guards to
 date in destroying the "four olds."   He went on,  however,
 to call upon the Red Guards to "distinguish who are our
 enemies and who are our friends," to "unite with the
 great majority and concentrate all forces on striking
 at the handful of bourgeois rightists."  The "main target
 of the attack," he said, must be "those persons in power
 who have wormed their way into the party and are taking
 the capitalist road."   In this formulation, Lin was
 reiterating almost verbatim the line which had been taken
 in the militant portions of the 8 August declaration and
 by Red Flag on 10 August,   (It seems important to recognize
 that- in-in his August and September speeches was not
 originating a new line, but idei:tifying himself primarily
 with the militant elements of the existing line.)  Thus
 restricting the range of Red Guard activity while incit-
 ing them anew against party leaders, Lin went on to line
 up with the 28 August People's Daily on the means of
 struggle
 ("Don't hit pe`op e-"'_not even the bad "persons
 in power"),  and to describe the Red Guards as "the shock
 force-of the great cultural revolution and a powerful
 reserve force of the People's Liberation Army."
 Chou En-lai also praised the Red Guards, but he
 went on to emphasize the need for a discipline as strong
 as the PLA's, and he did not incite the Red Guards to
 further action against party leaders as Lin had.   Stating
 expressly what Lin had simply implied, Chou asked the
 Red Guards to build themselves into a disciplined body
 and to become a r liable reserve force" of the PLA.
 During the first two weeks of September there were
 additional indications that Peking intended to put the
 brake on the Red Guard movement as a whole, while shaping
 it up as a permanent vehicle on the PLA model--a vehicle
 which could be driven headlong if so desired for a period
 of weeks, or used to run over given individuals while
 missing others,  and then reliably slowed or halted.*  The
 De ega ions from  otli Red Guard units and the party
 committees they had been attacking were reported to be
 trooping into Peking in this period to appeal to the
 party center.

 party's actions at this stage like others cannot be fitted
 neatly into a clearly-defined period, owing to the lack
 of synchronization,  especially the lag behind Peking it-
 self; as previously noted, the Red Guards in P;sking had
 begun to slow down at the end of August, while Red Guards
 at many other places (including Red Guards from Peking)
 were staging riots until mid-September.  But the actions
 taken in Peking of course indicated intentions as regards
 the conduct of the "cultural revolution" as a whole.
 Following up on the admonitory editorials and
 admonitory elements of leaders' speeches of late August,
 People's Daily reiterated on 5 September that it was the
 par    s               ~~
 Y   policy to  ,struggle By Reasoning, Not By Coercion
 or Force" (the title of an editorial that day).*  And   25X1
 on 7 September the party newspaper told the Red Guards
 directly that they were not to interfere with productive
 work and should in fact organize themselves to assist with
 the autumn harvest.
 The paper went on
 to say that the leaders of economic units should establish
 two teams--one "mainly" for the cultural revolution, one
 "mainly" for production.
 -   fe par y on tie same date put in better order its
 plans for bringing provincial students to Peking for in-
 doctrination.   A later wall poster cites a party-govern-
 ment directive of 5 September establishing quotas, teacher-
 student ratios, length of stay (four days), and respon-
 sibility for food and transportation.   It does not appear,
 however, that such good order was achieved.

 On 11 September People's Daily returned to a propo-
 sition that had been pu  forward in the 8 :'august declara-
 tion and had been spelled out by the party newspaper it-
 self on 23 August--namely, that the targets of the Red
 Guards were not to be allowed to figs    act, to organize
 resistance.   Quoting the 3 August declaration to the

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 effect that "it is not permitted,  whatever the pretext,
 to incite the massc,~s to struggle against one another, or
 to incite the students to do likewise," the 11 September
 editorial took note (as it had on 23 August) that "respon-
 sible persons in some localities and units openly defied
 this decision,...creat(:d various pretexts to suppress the
 mass movement,. ..even incited a number of wockers and
 peasants.. .to oppose and antagonize the revolutionary
 students."   (There were of course many more instances of
 this as of 11 September than as of 23 August.)  The news-
 paper reiterated that such resistance was "diametrically
 counter" to Mao's directives," and that a "firm struggle"
 would be waged against anyone so foolish as to resist Mao.*
 This editorial coul; of course be read as the corollary
 to the admonitions to the Red Guards in that period--better
 discipline for the Red Guards, less resistance from the
 party leaders attacked,  a neater script all around.   But
 this could hardly have been satisfactory to the party
 leaders who were then under attack or expected to be at-
 tacked:  even if assured in advance that they were in good
 favor and would just be playing out a farce (a very few'
 such assurances may have been given), acquiescence in
 this role--public humiliation by children--would undermine
 their authority forever and thus their ability to perform
 the jobs they were trying to keep.**  This was soon proved
 to be the case,  in IIeilungkiang, where a first secretary
 in high favor w_th Peking found his provincial committee
 to be paralyzed, after a particularly militant attack by
 Red Guards.
 It won   seem th   those who had "openly defied" a
 central committee directive would have to be severely
 punished at a later stage of the campaign, if the central
 committee and its subordinate organs were ever to exercise
 authority again.
 **The Book of Job comments on their situation:   "Unto
 me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
 counsel.   After my words they spake not again... But now
 they that are younger than I hold me in derision, whose
 fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock."

 In the same period (dating from late August,  in
 Pc,-king),  posters were observed reminding the Red Guards
 of their subordination to /cultural?7 "revolutionary com-
 mittees," and warning them not to attack "old revolution-
 ary cadres," nor to use force except against those targets
 "ratified by tine central committee" and municipal commit-
 tees, nor to search the houses of "revolutionary cadres"
 (party members?) except when ratified as above, nor even
 to search "bad elements" unless in coordination with the
 local police and public security officials.*
 In this period of early September, the regime ap-
 peared to be taking organizational measures to ensure
 thu continuing coordination of the activities of the Red
 Guards in a given province or municipality, and perhaps
 given on a national basis.  Provincial broadcasts and wall-
 posters first spoke of a "Red Guard General Headquarters
 of Universities and Colleges in Peking," and soon other
 "General Headquarters" were reported as having been estab-
 lished by a preparatory committee.  The objectives were
 stated by one provincial broadcast as being to "organize,
 merge, unify, and handle matters under centralized con-
 trol."  The regime seemed to intend to combine all of
 the individual Red Guard "headquarters" representing
 separate types of schools into a true general headquart-
 ers for a given area--one representing  irs  all types
 of schools and then all types of Red Guard activity in
 the area.**  The establishment of headquarters in a given
 isi ors  o  ien sin in mid-September reported walls
 and vehicles covered with posters saying "use peaceful  25X1
 methods,  not violence."

 I                               I
 area was normally celebrated in a rally attended by lead-
 ing figures of the provinc i.al and/or mun.'cipal party cc.ia-
 mittee,  of the local cultural revolution committee,  and
 of the local military headquarters, with speeches by one
 or more individuals from each such group.   These Red Guard
 headquarters "elected" their officers,  and were then sup-
 plicd with "instructors" from the local PLA headquarters.
 Three of these provincial accounts referred to a
 possible national headquarters of the Red Guards.  One
 (Mukden radio) spoke of an "Amalgamated General Headquart-
 ers of the Red Guards," and two others (in South China)
 referred to the "combined command" of the Red Guards,
 one of them (Kweiyang) specifying that the Red Guard
 headquarters in Kweichow had been established as a result
 9f a proposal of representatives of this "combined com-
 mand" and local colleges.   It was not at all clear, how-
 ever,  what the components of this "combined command" were;
 while it would have made sense for the "combined command"
 to be simply the command of a general headquarters, repre-
 senting many types of Red Guard units, the Kweiyang broad-
 cast spoke of the headquarters itself as having been
 established partly on the initiative of the "combined
 command" (that is, the combined command existed first) ;
 thus the "combined command" may have been composed of
 local leaders of the party committees, the cultural revo-
 lution bodies, and the PLA.   Neither was there any way
 to judge whether, there was a "combined command" in Peking.
 Subsequent. materials gave no indication of a national
 headquarters.

 Another important organizational measure taken in
 this period,  in order to slow the momentum of the Red
 Guards and get or k,'ep them under control, was the estab-
 lishment of Rec! Guard Control Squads, a kind of military
 police (but with larger powers) given complete uniforms
 and appreciable training.   The first of these was reported
 in Peking at the end of August, and another soon appeared
 in Tientsin.  These were said--like party pronouncements
 and wall-posters--to have ordered Red Guards to stop using
 coercion (including torture) and to adhere to the 16-point
 directive of 8 August, and to recognize at all times the
 authority of the central committee and municipal committees;
 they were further said to have the authority to expel
 disreputable elements and to tear down posters that did
 not reflect the true intentions of the party leadership.
 One poster, dating the decision to establish them as
 25 August, described them as the elite corps of the Red
 Guards--just as the Red Guards were the elite corps of
 the "revolutionary students," and the latter were the
 elite corps of the masses--and declared that they had
 authority to "investigate Red /Guard?7 organizations in
 all schools, organizations, factories and units."*  Similar
 bodies were subsequently reported in the provinces, some-
 times under the name of "Picket Corps" or "Provost Teams"
 described as being concerned with "security work and the
 maintenance of revolutionary order" (among the roving
 Red Guards).  Observed (in films.) in action in Peking on
 1 October, the control squads did indeed look like the
 elite of the Red Guards.
 This impression of early September--that Peking
 was moving toward the systematic coordination of Red Guard
 activity--proved to be misleading.  The more important
 development--which was not to become clear until November--
 was the logical consequence of the polarization of the
 Red Guards into militant and moderate elements which had
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 begun even earlier than 13 August and which was noted
 in the foregoing section of this paper.  This was prepara-
 tory action by the most militant elements of the Red
 Guards to set up rival headquarters, which first appeared
 in the Northeast,  in late September, and then in Peking
 and several provinces in Cctober.*  The Red Guards had
 been implicitly authorized to do so--that is, to set up
 whatever organizations they liked--in Chou En-lai's
 speech at Tsinghua on 22 August (not available until
 late November), and they may have been explicitly authorized
 to do so in interviews wii 'officers of the central "cul-
 tural revolution group."  Unfortunately, no material on
 the preparatory stage is available, and it is not known
 whether the militant organizers of the "rebel" headquart-
 ers got explicit permission from these officers or any
 other lea ers of the inner circle.
 The question remained,  in these first two weeks
 of September which saw the closing of the first--that is,
 the most violent--phase of Red Guard activity:   from whom
 were the Red Guards getting their orders?  The answer--set
 forth in detail below--seems to be that individual party
 *Anays~s ._of d~  were the first to recognize that some
 of the "headquarters" appearing in this period were not
 later forms of organizations originally reported in the
 "preparatory" stage, but were in fact rival headquarters.
 The present writer
 does not agree, however, that the material shows the
 rival groups to be "responsive to different individuals"
 in the politburo standing committee; what it shows, on
 this writer's reading, is that the militants believe that
 they are responsive to Mao and Lin, and believe that
 their opponents are responsive to othcrs, and in some
 respects are probably right about this--but not in -Te
 sense of attacking targets to order.

 leaders, the conventional party apparatus, the PLA, and
 the new "cultural revolution committees" all had roles,
 but that their most important guidance from the top level
 came from Chou En-lai (as their "advisor") and from the
 central "cultural revolution group," and, at the work-
 ing level, from the subordinate "cultural revolution"
 bodies.
 In a vague,  general sense,  the central committee
 and Chairman Mao were ++.ie "leaders" or "commanders" of
 the Red Guard.   In fact the Red Guards were quoted in
 their first appearance--18 August--as defining their mis-
 sion as that of defending the central committee, Mao,
 and Mao's thought.   Red Guards like others were constantly
 describing Mao as China's "supreme commander," or "great
 leader," or "helmsman," and Red Guard wall-posters often
 spoke of the party central committee as exercising "lead-
 ership" or even "supreme" leadership, and told the Red
 Guards to recognize this.  But there was no suggestion
 in any material that either Mao or the central committee
 issued orders directly to the Red Guards.
 Similarly, Red Guards were sometimes quoted as
 recognizing Lin Piao as their leader or commander, or as   25X1
 deputy to Mao in such a role, and it is,true that Lin had
 publicly given them some of their general directives at
 the rallies of 18 and 31 August.
 The conventional party apparatus was sometimes
 said to be in authority over the Red Guards,  in the sense
 that provincial party committees were sometimes described
 as "leading the cultural revolution" in the province, or
 as "supervising" the activities of Red Guards in their
 jurisdictions; and in at least one province Red Guard
 speakers cited the "leadership" of the provincial commit-
 tee as well as that of the central committee and Mao.

 Leading figures of regional,  provincial and municipal party
 committees were prominent in public gatherings--usually   25X1
 giving the main speeches--at public gatherings centered
 on the Red Guards, and provincial committees were credited
 with Navin  celled some of these meetings;
 rom that period suggested that the party committee's
 leadership was being exercised through an extraordinary
 party organ, the cultural revolution committee or group.
 This did not mean that the party committee's leadership
 was purely nominal; the cultural revolution committee or
 group was often if not usually led by a secretary of the
 local party committee,  and it was later learned that at
 least some of the cultural revolution committees and
 groups in this period were submitting regular or at least
 numbered reports to the local party committees (as well
 as to the central committee).   But even in cases in which
 the local cultural revolution committee and groups were
 headed by local secretaries who had been loyal to their
 first secretaries,  it is doubtful that the local party
 committees could effectively direct and control the
 activities of the Red Guards, because the cultural revo-
 lution committees and groups were also getting orders
 from the central "cultural revolution group" which they
 could disregard only at their peril, and, moreover, Mao's
 new team in Pr,king was bypassing the conventional party
 apparatus in giving the Red Guards their most important
 instructions in personal interviews, instructions which
 the Red Guards were bound to take more seriously than
 orders received from the local party secretaries whom
 they were free to attack.
 The "PLA"--as distinct from Lin Piao personally--
 was surmised by some observers to be leading, directing
 or supervising the Red Guards.   This surmise appeared
 to be built upon the many descriptions of the PLA as the
 model, the calls upon the Red Guards to "learn from the
 PLA," the assertion that the Red Guards were already or

 were to  become a "reserve force of the PLA (according
 to one report, an "armed" reserve), the links with the
 PLA through the ;establishment of Corps and the assignment
 of PLA officers as "instructors," the references to a
 "combined command" of the Red Guards (the assumption
 being--perhaps correctly--that the PLA at some level
 represented part of the combined command), and the
 prominent roles of military figures (along with party
 committee and "cultural revolution committee" figures)
 in the meetings celebrating the establishment of the
 various headquarters and welcoming Red Guards back from
 their travels.   At least one observer conjectured that the
 General Political Department of the PLA was directing the
 Red Guards,  and more than one concluded that the super-
 visory role of the PLA--in itself uncertain---was at any
 rate "increasing" as of mid-September.   Apart from the
 establishment of the various headquarters, which did in-
 deed suggest a larger PLA role at least in making the
 Red Guards a disciplined body, the surmise of PLA direction
 of the Red Guards as of mid-September seemed to beTililt  -
 on little more than an impression of an increased promin-
 ence of PLA figures in public activities related to the
 Red Guards; for example,  in at least two Red Guard cere-
 monies of mid-September, military figures--uncharacteristic-
 ally--were listed first among the dignitaries present,
 and in at least three instances the military figures gave
 the main speeches.                                               25X1
 The "cultural revolution group" in Peking and its
 subordinate bodies--together with Chou En-lai--appeared
 to have the largest role in the direction of Red Guard
 activity in this period.

 "cultural revolution" conuuittees and groups continued to

 sending their lists to higher-level bodies for approval.
 There was considerable evidence cX  a close relation-
 ship between the "cultural revolution" bodies and the
 Red Guards--much of which evidence indicated the direction
 of the latter by the former--from broadcasts, posters,
 and intercepted messages of the period.     Just as officers
 of the "cultural revolution group" in Peking had presided
 over the first two Red Guard rallies in Pekiiig (18 and
 31 C.ugust),  in the meetings at many points in China which
 established Red Guards Carps or welcomed Red Guards home,
 in most cases in which a presiding official was identified
 the presiding figure was a party committee official who
 was concurrently an officer of the committee's cultural
 revolution committee or group, although there were a few
 reports of such meetings in which "cultural revolution"
 figures were not identified as present.   Local cultural
 revolution committees and groups were sometimes identified
 as receivi

 As previously noted, the students
 attacking the provincial party headquarters in Sinkiang
 in early September claimed to be acting under the authority
 of Chen Po-ta; and it was to the "cultural revolution
 groups" all over China that the local academics sent their
 protest.   At about the same time,  according to later wall-
 posters, the competing forces in a research institute
 attached to a hospital in Pr-king--the work-team and the
 body that had dislodged it (a "cultural revolution" body)--
 both claimed to have the word--a "directive" or direct
 instructions--from Tao Chu himself*;
 /at least four  other 25X1
 officers of the cultural revolution group---Chiang Ching,
 Kang Sheng,  Kuan Fong,  and Chang Ping-hua--were giving
 speeches and interviews to the Red Guards in this period.
 Chou En-lai also had a major role, perhaps the most
 important role of any party leader.  Chou was known to  25X1
 have given iiuportant instructions to the Iced Guards in
 at least two major speeches in August
 he was reported to have given at

 the September posters to have sent the work-team and to
 have intervened personally on its behalf, while posters
 of November charged Tao with defending this same Minister
 of Health.

 and he was soon to give another major interview--appearing
 together with Tao Chu--in which he gave the Red Guards
 the clearest guidance ever reported.   This role has to
 be kept in mind when considering reports that this or
 that Red Guard activity was directed against Chou; this
 is not to say that there was no such activity, as the
 most militant Red Guard units in late August did appear
 to believe that their opponents represented Chou's line,
 but to say that some of the lines which the Red Guards
 were acting on were formulated by Chou himself.

 While the party leaders in Peking were calling
 both for militancy                                       and      25X1
 for discipline, and Peking itself was fairly quiet, else-

 clashes were reported.   These continued to include at-

 party and government officials (including functionaries
 o  the now "cultural revolution" committees and teams),
 the "shame parading" of party officials,* battles between

 tures as "hunger strikes" outside party committee head-
 quarters and the use of troops to quell "riots."   In some
 of these disorders, thousands of people were reported to

 to have been injured and dozens killed, or hundreds as the
 sum of several incidents).**

 ;i.ent.cod scornfully on the cult of ',Mao or on the value of
 Liu's  confession."   It is also possible to accept sum-
 mer 1966 as a period for which lio--in the hindsight of
 Mao and Lin--had to accept some part of ti,,e responsibility
 (like Liu and Tong of the party machine, a:nd Liu Chih-chicn
 of the General Propaganda Department)--tho.t is, respon-
 sibility for "errors" in implementing the. ?":ao-Lin fine
 at that time.   It is also possible to believe that Ho tried
 to protect sornc of his subordinates against attack and
 tried to protect some of the leaders of the Southwest
 (his onetime area) against the excesses of the Red Guards
 and against plans to purge then., just as Tao Chu did for
 leaders of the Central-South.   It is also -credible that
 IIo, like Lo, gave preference to his favorites.  And in
 11o's case there are both professional and personal rela-
 tionships with disgraced leaders which could be and prob-
 ably were used against him--e.g., longtime association
 with Peng To-huai and others in the Northwest, and with
 Tong llsino-ping, Li Ching-chuan and others in the South-
 west, and personal relationships with his own disgraced
 son, with Li Ching-chuan and his family, and with Liao
 Ilan-sheng (reportedly married to his niece).. But those
 things do not add up to a confirmation of the charge
 that IIo and others were conspiring against Lin Piao, and
 in llo's case as in Lo's it is necessary to look for some
 development external to the charges which would suggest
 at least that Mao and Lin believe that there is something
 in this particular charge.
 In Lo's case, the external development was the sud-
 don and simultaneous fall of Yang Shang-kun, months before
 an/?- other leaders fell.   Therc: is the same kind of evidence
 in No's case-?-the apparently simultaneous fall of at least
 six others later alleged to be members of Ho's cabal.
 Li Ching-?chuan, as noted, was denounced by the Madame on
 the same date (18 December), Liao Han-sheng disappeared
 from the news after 19 Decembe., Su Chen-hua :.nd llsu Kuang-
 ta failed to make any appearances after late November,
 and Huang 1lsin-ting  and Kuo Lin-hsiang of the Chengtu
 headquarters (not regularly in the news) apparently fell
 at this time; a seventh, Yang Yung, commander of the Poking
 headquarters, also dropped from the news after 19 December,
 and was much later accused of being one of this cabal.

 G:?  L.;i i:_ Nerd  to bc.'  in  trouble anyhow.
 It may b?c: useful to consider first those who ai nr-
 er;tly Lcl]. At thc sure titre, as if llao and his comrades
 ii, favor had finally decided,  in or about early December,
 that they wore indeed a group of conspirators.   Li Chinn-
 chuan had been a direct, longtime protege of Tcng Hsino-
 ping, and as such was expected to fall in any case.
 (ilsich Fu-chih, still in high favor, was another such
 case, but reportedly turned on Ton- in the summer of ?1966
 and saved himself; Li apparently declined to do this.)
 Li was obviously in disfavor also for the treatment ac-
 corded the red Guards by organizations subordinate to the
 Southwest Bureau in the fall of 1966, was clearly marked
 us nit object of the next wave of Red Guard attacks, and
 was pretty clearly marked for purging.   Similarly, Lino
 Han-shong was already in trouble; long associated with
 Pcng '1'e-huni, he was both an in-law of 11o Lung's and a
 brother- in-law of Yang Shang-ken's (enough in itse` to
 sink him, as the materials have shown that Chinese Com-
 munists like other Chinese take family relationships very
 seriously), and there is a credible charge that he helped
 to protect the Poking headquarters and the new Peking com-
 mittoe (the one which succeeded Pen- Chen's group) against
 Red Guard attacks in the autumn of 1966.   Similarly,  the
 Navy man, Su Chen-hua, had been so closely associated
 with Tong llsiao-ping that he was suspect in any case; and
 in fact a sta ';ement attributed to a military leader in.
 favor (llsu lisi.ang-chien) denounced Su not for con"piracy
 with Ilo but for being Tong's "nail" in the Navy.   Ilsu Kuang.-
 ta had had some unfortunate associations (he had had a
 great deal to do with the Russians, and had been close
 to Peng Te-huai and other discredited leaders), and could
 have been found against on that basis.   The two officers
 of the Chengtu headquarters, Huang and Kuo, were already
 in trouble, held responsible--like Li Chino-chuan--for
 resistance to the Red Guards there during the fall.   Yang
 Yung was probably in some degree of trouble, like Liao,
 for the Peking headquarters' opposition to Red Guard
 groups.
 The timing of the fall of the others alleged to
 be members of Ho's cabal is not known.  The two deputy
 commanders of the Air Force, Liu Chen and Chong Chun,
 had not made appearances for months; one of them (Liu)
 had already provided enough ammunition to bring him down,
 in an article of 1965 which gave high praise to Liu Shao-
 chi as at military leader (this may also explain the dis-
 appearance`fromthe news after late 'November of another

 Of the  Air  1'oi?cc in 1965 in the maneuvering for

 Liu                   The two officers of the operations subdepart-
 mcnt of the general staff, Wang and Lei, had been out of
 the news for some months and had had past associations
 with a number of leaders in disfavor.  (Some posters linked
 Wang and Lei with Lo Jui-ching rather than 1Io, and at
 least one suggested that they had got into trouble at the
 time of the "February coup" by failing to act rapidly
 to bring in reliable troops; but both Wang and Lei appeared
 to be in good favor as late as August or September, so
 both of these charges seem weak.)  Finally, Chiu Ilui-tso,
 although in trouble for some weeks, was defended by party
 and military leaders in favor and thereafter appeared to
 be in good favor himself.
 It can be argued that there was a single issue
 in December which precipitated a negative- judgment on
 several members of this group, and that they are linked
 by their position on this issue rather than by bonds of
 collusion.   It might be contended, for example, that the
 question of whether to send the PLA into action against
 Mao's opponents arose in late November or early December
 and that some members of this group--e.g. Ho-Lung-and
 the commanders of service, headquarters and the operations
 chiefs--expressed their opposition, and that--after. Mao
 and Mn had decided upon intervention--this made them
 (objectively) guilty of "collusion" with some of the
 regional leaders who were to be moved against.   There is
 no good evidence, however,, that Mao and Lin wore discussing
 as early as 'late November the question of sending g PLA into action, and, as will be argued later, it is hard
 to believe that any significant number of military leaders
 would have opposed a step aimed at restoring order.
 Another possibility, of course,  is that some of
 them were simply framed by rivals, that there was no real
 basis for moving against them.   Since this is an occupa-
 tional hazard for Communist leaders, it may have  happened
 in any number of cases in the purge; but evidence is lack-
 ing.
 On balance, the roughly simultaneous fall of at
 least seven of this group--Ho Lung, Li Ching-chuan, Liao
 Han-shen;, Su Chen-hua, Hsu Kuang-ta, Huang Hsin-ting,
 and Kuo Lin-hsiang--suggests that Mac and Lin may really
 believe that some of them were in collusion against Lin,
 at least in the sense of working together to frustrate
 his policies.   This opposition was not discovered in
 summer 1966, as Ho rode with Mao at the 31 August rally,
 and need not have existed--even undiscovered--as far back
 as summer 1966.  The probability is that ' i t shaped up later,

 The Purge of the Regional and Provincial Commands, 1966
 It was apparent in August 1966 that the political
 apparatus in the PLA's military regions and military dis-
 tricts, and in the armies disposed in these areas,. would
 be hit at'least moderately hard.   Many'of the ranking
 regional and provincial political officers were concur-
 rently the first or second secretaries of the regional
 bureaus and provincial committees, and the 8 August declara-
 tion on the.conduct of the "cultural revolution" incited
 the Red Guards against them.   Moreover, the purge of both
 party and military leaders in Peking seemed certain to
 have consequences down the line, and the purge of the
 General Political Department and the PLA/CRG toward the
 end of 1966 could also be expected to have some cc:nsoqu-
 ences for military commanders and political officers out-
 side Peking. Moreover,  it was evident that the PLP. might
 have to be sent into action in order to remove some of
 Mao's opponents at various points in China and to restore,
 order in the wake of the "revolutionary rebels" sent into
 action into December. This raised another question, be-
 cause some of the leaders of the military-political ap-
 paratus to be used against Mao's opponents were Mao's
 opponents.  While it looked as though Peking could manage,
 sooner or later, to bring down any or all of these leaders
 of military regions and military districts if the armies
 in the field were reliable, it also seemed likely that

 t:??   a fully rr.li.^.l;lo 1-.A litary commander or a fully
 ircl i:ii1c: political officer in place in each regional head-
 c;uariters and district headquarters before the need arose
 for the PLA to go into action, if for no other reason than
 in order to have in each headquarters its own man to whom
 to send the orders (when necessary) to dislodge and arrest
 the other, in order in turn to have reliable men in both
 posts at the time of crisis.   (Where one man held both
 posts, arrangements would have to be made through deputies.)
 Although information was and still is far from complete
 and is lacking entirely with respect to the armies, it
 is sufficient to indicate that for all of these reasons
 --a purge of party secretaries, a purge of political
 officers, a purge of military commanders, and a desire
 to make replacements if possible by the end of the year--
 Peking did indeed replace the leaders of the military
 regions and districts at an extraordinary rate in 1966.
 While it is still not known whether all of those regarded
 as unreliable were in fact dislodged by the end of 1966,
 it is evident that one important object of the purge was
 achieved:   the PLA served Mao well in the critical period
 of January-March 1967.
 Of the 24 key figures of the 13 military regions
 (12 military commanders and 12 political officers, rather
 than 13 of each, because in two regions one man occupied
 both posts), at least 10 wore :replaced in 1966, and an
 eleventh was soon to fall.   Ten others .appear--in thh
 light of events in 1967--to have been in favor at the end
 of 1966, but some of them insecurely.  The status of the
 other four was obscure.
 Beginning with the Peking headquarters, Liao Han-
 sheng, the political officer, was removed in the latter
 half of December, and the military commander, Yang Yung,
 was soon to fall.  There was no difficulty in seizing thorn.
 Proceeding more-or-less clockwise, the military
 corn::.under and concurrently political officer of the Inner
 Mongolia military region, Ulanfu (also first secretary),
 was 1 obably removed from the troops (although not formally
 replaced) by the end of 1966; he was denounced in the
 fall and made no appearances after October.   The commander
 of the Mukden headquarters, Chen Hsi-lien, once associated
 with Tong IIsiao-ping, was one of those whose status was
 in doubt; although not denounced, he made no appearance
 after October; the political officer, Sung Jen-chiung,
 seemed in good favor in late 1966, but, as a protege of
 Tong Hsiao-ping, not secure, and he-vas criticized in

 was it; favor';  the political officer, Tan Chi-lung (also
 first secrctru?y in Shantung), was denounced and disap-
 peared in \'ovc;iJher and was probably dislodged at that
 t imc: .
 The status of both the military commander and the
 political. officer of the Nanking headquarters was obscure,
 the comrnandpr, Hsu Shih-yu, had not appeared since November,
 and the political officer as of late 1966 was not known;
 there was a lot of trouble in the Nanking area early in
 1967.    The apparent commander of the Foochow headquarters,
 Han Ilsion-chu, who once served with Lin Piao's forces,
 was in favor; the political officer, Yeh Fei.  (concur-
 rently first secretary in Fukien), was reportedly removed
 around the end of the year.
 Down in Canton, the military commander of that
 military region, Huang Yung-sheng, for many years with
 Lin Pino, was in favor; the political officer, Tao Chu,
 was taken into the top leadership in Poking in August,
 purged in December, and smoothly replaced in Canton.   Up
 .in the Wuhan military region, the military commander, Chen
 Tsai-tao, who had served with Lin Piao, was in favor; the
 probable political officer, Wang Jen-chung, was also
 purged in December (he had been closely associated with
 Tao), and he too was smoothly replaced;
 In the Kunming headquarters, Chin Chi-wei  once
 closely associated with Hsieh Fu-chih, apparently was
 in favor, although perhaps not securely, as Red Guard
 posters denounced him; the political officer, Yen Hung-
 yen (also first secro t:ary in Yunnan ), once close to Tong
 Ilsiao-ping, was purged and replaced in. November, and
 killed himself (or was killed by Red Guards) soon there-
 after.   In the nearby Chongtu headquarters, once the command
 of Tcng Ilsino-ping, both the military commander, Huang
 Ilsi.n-ting, and the political officer, Li Ching-chuan
 (also first secretary of the Southwest Bureau), as well
 as the deputy political officer, Kuo Lin-hsiang, were
 denounced in December 'and apparently dislodged a Unost at
 once, as Li was reportedly shame-paraded in January.
 Up in the Lanchow headquarters, the military com-
 iiander, Chang Ta-chih, apparently was in favor, although
 perhaps not securely, in view of denunciations of him in
 Red Guard posters; the political officer, Hsien IIeng-han,
 was in favor (although the regional first secretary, Liu
 Lan-tao, a man close to Tong IIsiao-ping, was purged and

 lR,:d Guards and he may have been an insta%ice of a local
 loadcr in a tricky area with %rhom Peking was willing to
 compromise--for the sake of order--until it was convenient
 to br! 'g him down.   Finally, in the Lhasa (Tibet) head-
 quarters, Chang Kuo-hua, the military commander and
 also one of t?pose who was hard hit by the Red Guards, ap-
 parently was in favor, in view of his subscy,;ont assign-
 ment to an even more important post in Chengtu, but he
 did not seem entirely secure; the political officer of
 the Lhasa headquarters, Tan Kuan-san, was transferred to
 a meaningless job in Pelting during 1966, unless the latter
 job is hold ,by a man with an identical name.
 There is less information on the leaders of mili-
 tary districts, in particular on the dates of changes,
 but there is enough for a picture to emerge.   Of the 44
 key figures of the 22 provinces subordinate to nine mili-
 tary regions (the military regions of Inner Mongolia,
 Srechuan, Sinkiang and Tibet have no subordinate military
 districts, but are self-contained, single-jurisdiction
 military regions), at least 14 were replaced in 1.966
 (most of them purged) only nine are known to have been
 in favor and in place, and the status of 21 was obscure.
 There is little doubt, however, that some of these 21
 were replaced before or soon after the end of 1966, and
 that others 'will yet fall.
 Of the military district headquarters subordinate
 to the Peking regional headquarters:   in Hopei, the mili-
 tary commander, Mao Hui, was left in p]a cc, but the political
 officer, Liu Tzu-hou, was removed around the end of the
 year and put on display; while in Shensi, the military
 commr:ndor, Chen Chin-yu, may have been replaced in 1966
 (he made no appearance after January 1966), and the poli-
 ;:ica ]. officer, first Tao Lu-chia and then Wei Hong, Was
 appr:rontly purged and replaced twice before the end of
 1966.
 As for the military districts subordinate to the
 Mukdon headquarters:   in Heilungkiang, the military com-
 mander, Wang Chia-tao, remained in place (and has been
 very active politically in 1967), while the political officer,
 Ouyang Chin, was apparently replaced by August; in Kirin,
 the fate of the military commander, Lo Kun-shan, is obscure
 (ho has made no appearandes since January 1966), while
 the political officer, Wu Te, was transferred to Peking

 In the single military district subordinate to the
 Tsinnn headquarters,  the Shantung military district (the
 only case in which a one-province military region also
 hsn ; a military district for th,: same area), the status
 of both the military commander and the political officer
 is obscure, as neither incumbent in 1966 was known, al-
 though'Ho Chih-yuan may have been assigned in 1966 to re-
 place the political officer.
 Of the military districts subordinate to the Nanking
 headquarters:   in Chekiang, the military commander, Chien
 Chun, has not appeared since October, while the political
 officer,' probably Chiang 1Iua, was replaced in the fall
 of 1966; and in Kiangsu, the military commander, Chao
 Chun, may have been replaced late in 1966, and the poli-
 tical officpr may likewise have been replaced (if he was
 still Chiang Wei-thing).
 As for the military districts subordinate to the
 Foochow headquarters:   in Fulcien, the military commander,
 Chu Yao-hua, has not appeared since November,, while the
 political officer, possibly Lit Sheng, may have been re-
 placed in 1966; and in.Kiangsi, the military conw-andcr,
 Wu Jui-shan, was left in place, while the political-.officor,
 Yang Shang-kuei (brother of the doomed "conspirator" Yang'
 Shang-kun), was definitely purged during 1966.
 Of the military districts subordinate to the Canton
 headquarters:   in Kwangtung, the military commander,  Liu
 Ilsing-lung, was apparently replaced in 1966, while the
 political officer, Chen To, remained in place, perhaps
 shakily;  in Kwangsi, the military commander, On Chin-fu,
 has not appeared since October, while the political officer,
 if he was still Wei Kuo-ching, remained in place; and in
 Hunan, the military commander, Lung Shih-chin, has not
 appeared since October, while the political officer, as-
 suming he was Chang Ping-hut, was denounced and replaced
 in the fall of 1966.
 As for the military districts subordinate to th!-
 Wuhan headquarters:  in Anhwei, the military commander,
 Lino Jung-pino, was apparently replaced sometime in 1966,

 Of the military districts subordinate to the Kun-
 ming headquarters:  in Kweichow, the military connnander,
 lIo Kuang-yu, and the political officer, Shili Hsin-nn,
 were both confirmed in their posts, presumably one of the
 reasons Pelting early in 1967 described Kweichov, as a model
 province; but in Yunnan, the identity of military commander
 was uncertain, and the political officer, Chou Hsing, made
 no appearance after October and may have been purged.
 Finally, of the four military districts subordinate
 to the Lanchow headquarters:   in Kansu, neither the mili-
 tary commander nor the political officer was known as of
 1966 (or is yet known); in Ninghsia,  the same is true;
 in Shensi, neither the military commander, Hu Ping-yun,
 the probable political officer, Yuan Ko-fu, appeared
 after August; and in Tsinghai, the military commander,
 Liu Shien-chuan, was left in place (although his deputy
 has since. been purged), while the political officer,  first
 Yang Chih-tin and then perhaps Wang Chao, was denounced
 and replaced at least  once and perhaps twice in 1966.
 The Reorganization of the PLA/CRG, January 1967
 On 10 January, speaking to the Red Guards, Madame
 Mao denounced Liu Chih-chitin, believed to have been the
 first: chief of the PLA's Cultural Revolution Group, and
 told the Guards that the PLA/CRG was about to be reor-
 ganized.   Tha MAC decision was in fact approved by Mao
 and the central committee the next day, and announced on
 12 January.  The MAC document stated that the decision
 was taken in order to "strengthen the leadership over
 the great proletarian cultural revolution in the entire
 army," and that the new PLA/CRG would "carry out its work
 under the ?direct leadership" of the MAC and of the central
 (and saperior) Cultural Revolution Group of the central
 committee.
 The now chief of the PLA/CRG was to be Hsu Ilsiang-
 chien, an.  independent (i.e., not closely associated with
 any particular party or military leader), a politburo

 umc:mlbcr and perhaps already a vice-chairman of the MAC who
 had boon criticized by the Red Guards in the days preceding
 his now appointment and had been defended by Chou En-lni,
 Chen Po-ta and perhaps Madame Mao (reports differ), who
 had acted as "advisor" to the PLA/CRG at least since late
 November.   The Madame was now to take the title formally,
 and--as events were to show--was to have more authority
 than Hsu himself had.  Liu Chih-chien (on whom poster
 attacks had begun on 9 January) had been dropped entirely,
 and lost his post on the central CRG (which he had wished
 to resign) at the same time.
 Hsu's deputies were to be (in apparent order of
 rank):   IIsiao Hua, secretary-general of the MAC and. director
 of the Genei;al Political Department; Yang Chong-wu, acting
 chief-of.-staff; Wang Ilsin-ting, a deputy chief-of-staff,
 once connected with Tong IIsiao-ping; Hsu Li-ching, the
 other active officer '(with Hsiao) of the general political
 department; Kuan Fong, a member of the central CRG and a
 writer for the PLA newspaper; Hsieh Tang-ching, director
 of the cultural subdepartment of the general political
 dcpartirent, once associated with Tao Chu; and Li Man-tsun,
 director of the propaganda subdepartment of the general
 political department.
 The other members of the group (without titles)
 were to be:  Wang Iking-kun, senior deputy commander of
 the Navy, who had had an early association with Hsu Hsiang-
 chi.en and then Tong IIsiao-ping; Yu Li-chin, political
 officer of the Air Force, who had appeared (in party
 material) to be an able man; Liu Hun-ching, a little-known
 Navy ofificer; Tang Ping-chu, a former editor of the PLA
 newspaper who had taken over People's Daily, the party
 newspaper; Hu Chili, an editor of Lhe PLA newspaper; Yoh
 Chun, an unknown who turned out to be Lin Piao's wife and

 On 13 January a Red Guard newspaper printed an authorita-

 thoroughly, spoS:e: of the "circle upon circle of resistance"
 (mainly i'roin, the military equivalents or followers of dis-
 credited party leaders, like Liu and Teng), and declared
 that the PLA taut be manned by those "truly loyal" to
 1,1ao, ',:no's thought,  and 'iao's line.   Rejecting the argu-
 ment that the PLA did not need such a revolution, it
 stated that the struggle between the two lines "not only
 exists, it is acute and complicated..."  The editorial
 went on to call for an intensive and ambitious program
 in "all high-ranking leading organs, military colleges
 and schools, and cultural organizations" of the PLA ("dar-
 ing to advance. . .and drag out one after another" those
 taking the wrong road or wrong line, "struggle against
 them, pull them down, and discredit them''), while calling
 only for a low-key grogram in the PLA's "armed units,"
 a program featuring "correct education."   In other words,
 Mao and Lin were willing at that time to accept a good
 deal of disruption at the upper levels of the PLA, but
 not of the military units which would do the actual fight-
 ing if the PLA were sent into action.   It is not known
 whether this line was embodied in any directive prior to
 the appearance of the 28 January directive--whidh in fact
 changed the line, in the interest of reducing disruption
 in the high levels as well.
 In a sensational development, within a few days
 of their appointment several members of the now PLA/CRG
 were being attacked by the Red Guards in posters and
 apparently in interviews with leaders of the central. corn-
 mittec's CRG.  Two of the deputies, Hsieh Tang-chung and
 Kuan Feng, and four of the ordinary members--Wang Hung-
 kun, Tang Ping-chu, Hu Chih, and Ho Ku-yer, were denounced
 in this way.  The initiators of the attacks were not known
 but the contents clearly disconcerted some of the loaders 25X1
 of the PLA/CRG and of the superior central CRG and put
 them on the defensive;

 There was so-mo speculation at  the  titre that the
 ~et~acl::, ware really  imed at Lin Pino--through the standard
 practice of fo] lov-ing the thread from the lesser figures
 to the higher.   Lin had been ou c of sight and may have
 been sick, and his name had curiously no c appeared in the
 authoritative 14 January editorial.     Lin's opponents--who
 may conceivably have included Madame Mao, as the follow-
 ing section will argue--may  indeed have thought that this
 was a good time to start a process envisaged as ending
 with the fall of Lin.   If so, however, the initiative
 failed.
 These first attacks on members of the reorganized
 PLA/CRG made a disorderly episode, at the least; all of
 those attacked had surely been investigated and found
 virtuous before their appointment.  And the attacks may
 have boon, at most, the beginning of a campaign against
 some top-level military leaders.  But the attacks did not
 serve to discredit either the new PLA/CRG or the central
 CRG as a body; both continued to function, although very
 little publicity was subsequently given the PLA/CRG.
 The Teeter and Recovery of Hsiao Hua, January 1967
 ?              Hsiao Hua, director of the General. Political Depart-
 ment, had come under poster attack in early January but
 had been given it vote of confidence on 12 January with
 his appointment as senior deputy chief'of the reorganized
 PLA/CRG.   Nevertheless, Hsiao apparently continued to be
 criticized b, other leaders in favor for errors in the
 conduct of the "cultural revolution" in the PLA--as, in-
 deed, he should have been, inasmuch as his subordinates,
 Liang Pi-ych and Liu Chih-chien, had been not only cri-
 ticized but purged for them.   And he had apparently been
 invited to make a self-criticism.
 Yang Yung, commander of the Peking military region
 and a key figure in the Chinese military leadership, ap-
 parently took the initiative in mid-January to make public
 the charges that were being made against Hsiao by other
 leaders.  His eagerness seems explained by the probability
 that he was in trouble himself, and his calculation that
 he could deflect or reduce the charges against himself
 by inciting the Red Guards against fsiao.    (There seems
 to have been no position for which they were competing.)
 Yang had been out of the news for several weeks, having
 disappeared from it on the same day as Liao Han-sheng, his
 colleague in the Peking headquarters (Yang was the military

 "exposed" as one of Ho Lung's co-conspirators, and it may
 be that Yang l:new or thought himself vulnerable through
 his close associatiok with Liao, as well as to the charge
 (made la ter) that he had worked with Liao to frustrate
 the ]led :;uards in the autumn.   (The Red Guards later pro-
 vided a long list of Yang s "crimes" over the course of   25X1
 many years, most of them incredible.)

 himself soon attacked in posters but remained iu favor).
 On the sai,;c day, and for two days thereafter, posters
 attacking )h-J o wore observed on army trucks.in Peking.
 1'/hothor those were Red Guard trucks or trucks supplied
 for the occasion by Yang Yung is not clear, but it is
 apparent that the Iced Guards were encouraged by the re-
 ported remarks of Yana, Chen, and the Madame, which were
 in fact quoted in the posters.
 Chou En-lai was chosen to repel the attack on Hsiao
 on 21 January, on which day PLA troops were also sent out
 to tea.- down the posters attacking lIsiao
 speaking to "cultural revolution" cadres of the PLA, Chou  25X1
 did not deny that Hsiao had been under criticism within
 the party, but said that this was an "internal question"
 which should not have been publicized.   lie further said
 that the criticism had been "distorted" in the posters.
 In particular, Chou said, it was "slanderous" to assert
 that Chen Po-+a had "slandered the PLA" in the way reported,
 as Chen understood Mao's thought too well to have done
 that.   In. other words, lisiao had made errors which he would
 have to recognize and admit, and Chen (and the Madame)
 had been unwise to speak publicly about Hsino's case, but
 both Chen and Hsiao (not to speak of the Madame) were good
 comr.a?3es who were still in favor with Mao and Lin.  This
 seems to have been exactly the case.
 The luckless Yang Yung was broken on the next day.
 According to posters, Chen Po-ta and llsu Hsiang-chien,
 chairmen of *the CRG and PLA/CRG, on 22 January denounced
 Yang as being as bad as Peng Te-huai, and said further
 that "others in Yang's group should confess."  Chen report-
 edly linked Yang with the earlier-discredited Liao Han-
 sheng, declaring that the question of the Peking headquart-
 ers which they had commanded was "extremely grave" and
 that power must be seized back from them; and further,
 that it had been intended (from what date is unclear) to
 decide Yang's fate later, but his attitude had been bad
 and the Red Guards could settle it themselves.  Yang was
 reportedly paraded the same day.

 (rtlthou24-h they 1nny have been cornered by the Red Guards
 on thhis).   As previously suggested, the Madame may have
 wanted llsino's job.   It is entertaining to speculate
 further that one or both, more likely the Madame, was
 engaged in an operation to bring Lin Piao down, and that
 Chou's defense of }Hsiao was a way of telling Lin's enemies
 that they could not hunt any further down this path.   In
 other words, Chou could have been saying that, whereas
 under the rules governing the purge of the party they
 were permitted to follow the thread from Wu Han to Teng To
 to Penn Chen to Teng Hsiao-ping to Liu Shao-chi, in this
 case the thread would lead from Liu Chih-chien to Hsiao
 llua to Lin Piao, and they should recognize that there
 was nobody below Lin's level who was strong enough--not
 even Madame Mao--to bring Lin down.  While it was and
 remains conceivable that the Madame would like to dislodge
 Lin, the evidence for this proposition in the Hsiao llua
 case is very thin.
 The Order to the PLA to Intervene, Late January 1967
 In the first half of .January, the "cultural revo-
 lution" was in high gear.   Party leaders were being de-
 nounced and displayed, the purge of a large group of? mili-
 tary leaders was revealed, the PLA/CRG* was reorganized
 and told to move aggressively against resistance to Mao's
 thought and policy, and the "revolutionary rebels" (in-
 cluding the Red Guards, which retained their separate
 identity), were being urged to act on the December direc-
 tives extending the "revolution" into'the factories and
 the countryside.  The "rebels" in Shanghai, `who "seized
 power" in early January, were praised as examples for the
 entire country, and it was said that the revolutionary
 rebels nation-wide were about to launch their "general
 offensive."
 There was, however, great disorder in this "January
 revolution."  Much of this was probably caused by Mao's
 opponents still in place in the party apparatus outside
 Pcking,at least in the sense of defending themselves
 against attack, one means being that of turning Peking's
 own directives on the "revolution" against it--disrupting
 production and stimulating clashes among elements of the
 population.  But much of the widespread disorder was
 caused by the "rebels" themselves.  Not only were they
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010022-2
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 unable to cope v.1th the disorders caused by other elements,
 but they contributed greatly to the- disorder, by attack-
 ing at random and by fighting anong themselves.
 It may be, as some observers have surmised, that
 11ao would have sent the PLA into action earlier than he
 did if he had been confident of the loyalty of the PLA,
 and that he had such confidence only after the purges of
 December and early January (and, some add, the easing of
 those purges in late January).  The evidence indicates
 to this writer, however, that Mao's scenario called for
 the PLA to be used only as an absolutely last resort;
 surely it would have been, much better in terms of Mao's
 doctrine if the "rebels" had managed to "seize power"
 without any assistance except for  that offered by the
 enlightened masses.   Mao evidently was not persuaded that
 they would be unable to do this until after the middle
 of January.  Whatever the case, it seems likely that Mao
 himself vas-concerned with the scale and potential of
 the disorders in China at the time, and that he was also
 given counsel--on the need to restore order--by Chou En-
 lai and his associates, who needed a greater degree of
 order if they were to operate the government, and by the
 military leaders still in favor, who had probably been
 unhappy about the role of the "rebels" from the start.
 On 17 January, Madame Mao expressed for Mao the
 leadership's concern about "anarchy" among the rebels
 and about certain other of their failings.  On 19 January
 the Military Affairs Committee met, almost certainly to
 consider the question of armed intervention by the PLA.
 On the following day, despite Madame Mao's warning, a
 rebel corps reportedly invaded the State Council, and
 was arrested for it.
 On the next day (21 January), according to posters,
 Mao told Lin Piao that the policy of non-intervention had
 proved to be a failure and that the PLA must now inter-    25X1
 vent.  On 22 January, according to posters, Chou En-tai
 affirmed the need to send the PLA into action.
 On 23-January, the PLA was officially ordered into
 act', on by a joint directive of the central committee, State
 Council, Military Affairs Committee, and Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group.  The provisions of the directive soon appeared
 in a Red Guam newspaper and a number of posters.

 This directive opened by speaking of the "new stage"
 of thc revolution--th^ "struggle for seizure of power"--
 and called upon the PLA to support the "proletarian revo-
 lutionaries" in this struggle.   It cited Mao's "recent"
 statements that non-involvement was a false concept and
 that the "demands of all true revolutionaries for support
 and assistance from the PLA must be satisfied."  The
 directive declared that "all past directives" which had
 kept the PLA out of action were now rescinded, that when
 "genuine" leftists asked for help the PLA must "send out
 troops" on their behalf, and that counter-revolutionary
 individuals and organizations must be "resolutely suppressed."
 There was the obvious problem of how the "true"
 or genuine leftists were to be distinguished from the
 false.    This in fact proved to be a very complex task for
 the PLA, in those cases--perhaps the majority--in which
 guidance was not provided.   It was provided in some cases;
 for example, on the same day (2  7anuary), according to
 later accounts from official sources, the PLA in Harbin
 carne to the aid of the "true" rebels, surrounding and dis-
 arming the counter-revolutionaries; the latter were almost
 certainly identified for the PLA by the party leader in
 favor there, Pan Fu-sheng, whose list had presumably been
 approved by the party leaders in Peking.   But this was
 a "model" province, and in many if not most places, it seems, the
 leaders in Peking and the pLA locally were not in happy
 possession either of a Pan Fu-sheng or of thorough know-
 ledge of the local situation.   Thus the PLA seems in fact
 to have been given a good deal of discretion in sorting
 out the good comrades from the rascals and the "true"
 rebels from the false, and--judging from the fact that
 only a few revolutionary committees have yet been approved
 by Peking--it seems to .have had its troubles.
 On 24 January, the Peking Radio, as might be expected,
 claimed the allegiance to Mao of "all" officers and men
 of the PTA, and on 25 January the Liberation Army Daily
 smoothly explained everything to the troops.    Tie editorial,
 entitled "The Chinese PLA Firmly Backs the Proletarian
 Revolutionaries," presented the argument in terms of a
 struggle against the bad "handful" in the party, although
 much or most of the PLA'?s activity for some months was
 in fact to be directed against some Of thc:cse calling them-
 selves "rebels."  It was stated that the proletariat was
 now struggling to "seize power," and that Chairman Mao
 had called upon the PLA to "firmly support and assist
 them," oven where and when the (true) rebels were in a
 "minority temporarily."

 Thu 25 January editorial went on to dismiss the
 cal, "sor;c poop lc''  that the policy of non-interven-
 ti.on 5;11011]d he continued;                                     it pointed out that non?-inter-
 vuntion (At this sta(e) would have the effect of assist-
 ing the opponeentF of the: revolution.   Some observers took
 this line as an admission that some of the leaders of the
 PLA itself opposed 14ao's decision, and this may be true;
 posters denouncing Hsu ilsiang-Chien, chief of the reor-
 ganized PLA/CRG, and.llsiao Hun, who had just been "cleared"
 by Chou, reportedly appeared on the day that the decision
 was announced and on the next day.   But it seems doubtful'
 that any substantial number of PLA leaders opposed the
 decision, and the attacks on IIsu and Hsiao seem more credibly
 explained on other grounds  (Ilan was later criticized not
 for opposing the decision but for carrying it out all too
 aggressively, and Hsiao remained in favor).  The PLA news-
 paper's assertion of opposition by "some people" would
 be expected in any case, as all important decisions are
 opposed by "some people," and the newspaper had asserted
 just 10 days earlier that there was a struggle between
 two lines in the PLA--a struggle which, in the dialectic,
 would of course be expressed in W.s instance.   Moreover,
 no individual opponents of the decision were named, either
 at the time or subsequently, even in posters.  -Inasmuch
 as the principal mission of the PLA, under the new directives,
 was to be the restoration o  order,  it is hard to under-
 stand why any significant number of military leaders would
 have opposed it in principle:  the hardest people to'con-
 vince, of the need for such a directive, would seer to
 have been'the extreme militants like Mao himself, those
 who all along had demonstrated a willingness to accept
 a large degree of "disorder" in the interest of a thorough
 revolution.   If there was opposition,  it seems more likely
 to have been expressed as dissatisfaction with the lack
 of clear guidance for -the order's implementatiu:,.
 Reassurances to the PLA, Late January-February 1967
 The militant line on the conduct of the "cultural
 revolution" in the "leading organs'' of the PLA--the line
 affirmed, or perhaps reaffirmed, in the editorials which
 followed the reorganization of the PLA/CRG in mid-Jar:uary--
 was eased within a few days of the time of issuance (23
 January) of the order to the PLA to intervene in support
 of the "true" leftists.  Some observers have interpreted
 the MAC directive or directives of late January  s halting
 the "revolution" in the PLA; while this is clearly not
 correct, it does appear that the late January line and

 the elaboration of it in    mid-February substantially
 modified the conduct of it--at the higher levels of the
 PLA--as prescribed in mid-January.
 25X1
 In order to estimate the extent of the change, a
 brief recapitulation may be helpful.  The work-teams of
 June and July had been found to be far too conservative.
 Lin Piao in August had supplied a more militant.  directive,
 but the purge of inadequate cadres was still to be carried
 out in only a portion of the ALA and by the PLA's exist-
 ing instri+.rents, as directed by the General Political
 Department; the task was given to party committees, which
 were told to carry out a program of what was still a
 fairly conservative nature, probably emphasizing "educa-
 tion" rather than "struggle."  The 5 October directive
 had changed this with respect to military academies and
 schools, telling these institutions to pursue a more
 vigorous program emplo;*,ing the more disruptive methods
 already in use by non-military organizations (contending,
 posting, debating, exchanging experiences), and transfer-
 ring leadership from party committees to special cultural
 revolution teams under a PLA/CRG;  there may have been a
 concurrent directive for the conduct of the revolution
 in the PLA as a whole, under the direction of the PLA/CRG,
 but, if so, it surely called for less disruptive methods
 in the PLA as a whole than in the schools.   In early
 January this PLA/CRG had been reorganized and put under
 the direct leadership of the 11AC and the central CRG,
 and editorials which followed the event called for an
 intensive 'struggle in all high-level organs (snder' the
 slogans of "daring..., dragging out..., pulling down...,"
 and so- on).
 The new orders--changing the mid-January line--
 were embodied in a MAC directive of 28 January.  This may
 have been preceded by a directive of 27 January--dealing
 with one part of the problem--which is worth a moment's
 diversion.   It will be recalled that Liu Chih-chion had
 reportedly, in late November, expressed discouragement
 over the progress of the revolution in the 13 military
 regions, saying that fewer than half were really partici-
 pating.   The 27 January directive, as reported in posters
 later, was reportedly concerned entirely with this ques-
 tion; it reportedly placed the military regions on the
 [Sino-Soviet) "fro.n1oier" (at least three) on the Alert
 against the "revisionist" military threat and stated that
 (in consequence of this concern the "cultural revolution"
 could be postponed in some regions.  This reported directive
 was later criticized in Red Guard posters as representing
 the personal initiative of Yeh Chien-ying rather than Mao's

 will, but in fact it is consistent with the 28 January
 dirrcLivu as reported and with some- remarks attributed
 to Chou L;n-lai a few days later.   What is uncertain is
 whet.h~?r there was in fact. a separate 27 January directive;
 it is possib].c that the Red Guards whose posters reported
 it had simply got hold of one portion of the 28 January
 directive and misdated it by a day.   In this connection,
 there would seen no great need for a separate directive
 on a matter essentially covered in a directive issued
 one day later.
 No official text of the 28 January directive is
 available, but a purported reproduction in a Red Guard
 newspaper--confirmed in part by posters--is probably
 generally accurate.  It was a MAC directive, endorsed
 and praised by Mao on 28 January and published (on Mao's
 order) the same day.  Like the 23 January directive order-
 ing the PLA into action, it spoke of the "new stage" in
 which intervention by the PLA was necessary, and gave
 directions  appropriate'(as it said) to this new stage.
 The first ox its eight points reiterated the central
 point of the 23 January directive as to the need to sup-
 port the "true proletarian revolutionaries" and to sup-
 press the counter-revolutionaries, while the rest of its
 points concerned the conduct of the cultural revolution
 in ,the PLA.
 The most important -t these points provided: ? that
 the revolution would be c;.,nducted--meaning, perhaps,-would
 continue to be conducted--by means of "big contending,
 big blooming, big-character posters, and big debates"
 (but not exchanges of experience) in "units of the armed
 forces where the great cultural revolution  has been
 launched" (while evading the question of just where it
 had been launched and also failing to call explicitly for
 bad leaders to be brought down); that the revolution
 should be conducted by reason and not by force; and that
 those criticized should not be lightly classed with the
 enemy; that there were to be no arrests without orders,
 and no physical harassment (torture and parading; Westerners
 had observed officers forced to lie on the ground with
 their men's feet on their heads); that those who had gone
 to exchange experience should return to their units to
 handle their own struggles; that there were to be no
 more assaults on military "leadership" (later reported
 as "guidance"c)organs; that PLA organizations above divi-
 sion-level could carry out the revolution either at dif-
 ferent times or by easy stages (either reading is possible,
 meaning 'as opportunity permits').; and that military forma-
 tions of ermy'level and below must undertake "positive
 education.

 There was reportedly an elaboration of this MAC
 di.rvc:tiw! in a central committee directive on 21 February.
 Again thorn is no official text, but again there is a
 detailed :'CCount, this one from posters.   According to
 these posters, which appears to       25X1
 give the provisions of both the 28 January directive and
 the 21 February elaboration, the main points of the two
 were:   that military organizations above division-level
 should conduct the revolution by posters and debates,
 but in separate groups and at separate tfwos, while lower-
 level units should conduct the revolution entirely through
 "regular education" and in particular should not take part.
 in "exchanges of experience"; that "seizi.ng of power from
 below" in "military guidance organs" (earlier reported
 as "leadership" organs) was absolutely forbidden (a pro-
 vision presumably addressed to the "revolutionary rebel"
 groups known to exist in some of these organs); that there
 were to be no further "invasions" of these organs (there
 had reportedly been some more, since 28 January); that
 the cultural revolution in units of division-level and
 above was to be directed by party ccmmittees rather than
 cultural revolution teams, in the interest of maintaining
 a strict command system; and that PLA leaders who had
 made "mistakes" were not to be treated harshly and wore
 not to be irresponsibly classified with the enemy.
 It is apparent that the two reported directives
 added up to a substantial modification of the line
 being expressed as late as 14 January--with its exhorta-
 tions to have daring, drag out, pull down, and so on.
 Some observers concluded at the time that the PLA "agreed"
 to join the revolution--that is, consented to support
 the rebels in seizures of power, and to restore order
 generally--because these two directives promised that
 the purge of the PLA would be "called off."  But they
 did not promise that.  Where they differ from the 14
 January line is that they are evasive or .conciliatory on
 the question of pace at the higher levels, and more con-
 servative with respect to the treatment of those cri-
 ticized..  This was a 'promise' which was not very hard
 to make, because Mao and his team had already conducted
 a large-scale purge of the PLA leadership, had already
 purged what was almost certainly the majority of those
 they intended to purge.   (As it turned out, the purge of the
 PLA did continue, but at a much slower pace.) It can be argued
 that this modification represented a "price" for, or the "terms"

 of, P1,A a!-sistance in the revolution outside the PLA; but,
 apar i  from the que.,tion of whether Mao and Lin would have
 to buy the obedience of a military leadership which they
 1-ad`:lroady showed themselves capable of cruelly purging,
 it sew; : better to put the case in terms of reassurances
 rather than hard coin.   On this reading, the military
 le::ders, and in particular the military units which would
 have to do the actual fighting (if any), were being given
 public reassurances, in the interest of the smooth opera-
 tion of  the  PLA in the months ahead--reassurances that
 the purge of the PLA would not be carried out to anything
 like the degree or in anything like the wild way that the
 purge of the party had been.  The military leaders may
 additionally have got private reassurances that only a
 few PLA leaders wore yet to fall.  While it was possible
 (and may have been recognized by the military leaders as
 possible) that these reassurances--like the assurances
 given party leaders by Mao and Lin in the work-conference
 of October 1966--would prove to be worth nothing, the
 reassurances probably did help to make the PLA a reliable
 instrument in the "new stage" of the revolution.
 The PLA Occupation of China, Late January - March 1967
 Military commanders everywhere in China apparently
 responded loyally and swiftly to the 23 January directive
 ordering the PLA into action.  Contrary to early reports
 in the Western press of defiance by various regional and
 provincial military leaders, there was not one known in-
 stance of such defiance.  Within a few weeks, the PLA was
 in effective occupation of all or virtually all of China
 --that is, it had restored order sufficiently to be able
 to take further steps in those provinces and cities in
 which it knew what steps to take.
 The paucity of effective resistance to this oc-
 cupation--resistance in a plain military sense--was a
 striking feature of the early months of 1967.  While it
 had been presumed all along that the PLA was the ull:imate
 base of power in China--in other words, that political
 power in China would continue to rest on military force--.t
 had also been presumed that some of those in disfavor,
 i.e., party-machine leaders (like Liu, Tong, and Peng),
 individual military leaders, and long-entrenched party
 secretaries in the provinces, would be able to make some
 part of the PLA responsive to them per?r:rnally,  Indeed,
 in the early months of 1967, when all three groups were
 under attack at the same time, some, observers predicted

 ance, especially in some of the outlying areas like
 Szcchuan; although further information may establish that
 this was indeed the case at this or that point, so far
 as we now know this did not happen anywhere.   Similarly,
 while it may turn out that some of the apparently smooth
 operations (like the' pacification of Sinkiang) represented
 compromises with local leaders (like Wang En-mao in Sinkiang),
 there is as yet no good evidence of this.   In sum, the
 solidarity of the PLA as an operating instrument--despite
 the network of controls in it established by the old party
 machine, and despite the purge of a number of military
 leaders and the threat to a number of others--was truly
 an impressive thing.
 According to official accounts of PLA operations
 in this period, the PLA did not have to do much fighting;
 the threat of force was usually enough.  Its first task
 everywhere seems to have been to restore order sufficiently
 to permit it to play--or try to play--its predominantly
 political role, to this end occupying if necessary the
 headquarters of the local party committee.   According-to
 the scenario given for the few provinces where things
 went more-or-loss smoothly, the PLA, once in visible com-
 mand, then "analyzed the nature" of the party officials
 there and of the various "rebel" organizations; the next
 step was to consult the "good" cadres and the'"true" left-
 ists as to whether a complete "seizure of power" was
 necessary; if not, the PLA "helped" to roorganize the
 leadership to whatever degree was required; if, however,
 a full-scale "seizure" was judged necessary, the PLA "sup-
 ported" the good cadres and true leftists in effecting
 this seizure--that is, it installed them in office, to-
 gether with its own representatives, as a "three-way al-
 liance," looking toward formation of a "revolutionary
 committee."  In so doing, (still according to the official
 scenario), the PLA would do such things as preventing the
 bad cadres from staging a "sham" seizure, assuming control
 of "vital organs" like the public security bureau and
 propaganda media and legal organs, setting up patrols,
 and assigning armed guards to protect those cadres and
 "rebel" leaders in favor; after this,  the PLA would some-
 times have to repel propaganda assaults and physical
 attar.ks--including attacks on PLA installations--by
 false "rebel" groups, sometimes incited and organized by
 bad c;dyes; this repulsion of hostile actions would entail
 a propaganda offensive, "exposure of plots" (using Mao's
 thought), suppression of a "handful" -of counter-revolutionaries

 ns~.i.::tanco to the rebels in carrying out their own "recti-
 fication'  (m.ninly of trends toward "anarchism").
 This account, however, is of the PLR's operations
 in those few provinces and municipalities in which the
 PLA's intervention proceeded smoothly enough to permit
 a "revolutionary committee" to be established which was
 in turn good enough to be recognized by Peking.   It seems
 apparent, from the failure of Peking to recognize more
 than a handful of these committees, that in most cases
 the course of events was not so smooth.
 There seem to have been two main factors in this.
 One was that in many if not most cases Poking itself did
 not know enough about the local situation to be able to
 give the PLA commander on the spot clear directives about
 whom to support, with respect both to party officials and
 to competing "revolutionary" organizations.  Where.that
 was the case, the PLA seems to have engaged in a holding
 action while it tried to sort things out.   It seems ap-
 parent that the PLA had a terrible time trying to do this.
 Where it vias on its own, it had little more to help it
 than the searchlight of Mao's "thought."  In other words,
 just as the party press in early 1966 had been expected
 to denounce Wu IIan's plays without a specific directive
 to do so, just as the work-teams of summer 1966 had boon
 expected to support the most militant students without'
 explicit orders to do so, just as the Red Guards in the
 autumn of 1966 had been expected to distinguish those
 party officials faithful to Diao's thought from those un-
 faithful without specific targetting by Peking, so now
 the PLA--as that component of Chinese society which had
 proved itself most faithful to Mao--seems to have been
 expected, in those cases in which guidance was not pro-
 vided, to recognize and bring forward the other good
 servants.   In some cases, probably, the PLA on the spot
 recognized its inability to do this, and in other cases
 it: found this out only when Peking' disapproved its selec-
 tions.                            In yet other cases, the PLA on the spot and the
 leaders in Peking probably agreed on the lists but ran
 into such spirited opposition from those who#had been
 excluded that they chose not to go ahead.
 The other main factor seems to have been that what
 guidance there was--in leadership statements and the party
 press--was in apparent conflict with the general directive
 the PLA was operating under.  That ite, the 23 January directive

 had c,rd~Ircd  the  PLA ;o support the "genuine" leftists and
 to suppres     ceunt..^.r-rC volut'1031arics.    The PLA in the field
 had J."ood yea -on to hclieve that those regarded as "genuine"
 lof t i.., -s , at the       the order was issued, were the most
 militant of    the "rebels"--those symbolized by the Red Guards
 of the 3rd Headquarters in Peking--and the kind of local
 party officials who would find favor with such elements.
 Yet the signals from Peking, after 23 January, were in-
 creasingly to the effect that the extreme militants were
 out of favor.  And they were out of favor for a reason
 that must have appeared to the PLA leaders in the field
 as a very good reason--their inclination to "anarchy."
 While the leaders in Pelting were not yet ready to
 declare against disorder per se (as they were by June),
 the extreme militants among t1 Red Guards were criticized
 repeatedly in this period by officers of the Cultural
 Revolution Group and also by Mao (according to posters),
 and militant leaders were criticized--sometimes sharply--
 by name.   Many of their organizations were suppressed or
 dissolved; e.g., the three Red Guard headquarters in Peking
 were merged in late February.  They were ordered to keep
 out of the military establishment, were told that they
 could not "seize" ministries without permission from the
 central committee and could only "supervise" those seized,
 and were forbidden to seize power in the countryside.
 They were apparently put in the bottom layer of the "three-
 way alliances."  Travel by the rebels to "exchange experi-
 ence's was suspended, and students were ordered back.to
 school.
 in the same period, the strong defense of the PLA--in
 the party press--against any and all detractors was
 pretty clearly aimed mainly at the rebel extremists.  A
 typical editorial (22 February) praised the work of Lin
 Piao, insisted that the rebels could not do without PLA
 support, demanded that all rebels in turn support the
 PLA, asserted that this was in fact a test of true revo-
 lutionaries, and declared that no one was allowed (under
 pretext of the cultural revolutii+n) to incite the masses
 against the PLA.
 The PLA seemed increasingly to take these develop
 ments as a mandate to find against, and to suppress, the

 most militant of the "rebel" groups.   Although a complete
 picture of the relations between the PLA and the rebels
 throughout China is not avails,ule
 the lilli.1111111 11
 was acting so aggressively
 against the most militant rebels that Mao was concerned  25X1
 for the continued good health of the young "revolution-
 ary successors."
 This is not to say that Mao in March withdrew his
 confidence from the PLA.   On the contrary, he continued
 to provide it with expressions of confidence.   In early
 March Peking called for PLA personnel to be represented
 in all units "seizing power" at the provincial level and
 below, and by the and of March the PLA was deeply involved
 in the civilian sector (including industry and agriculture).
 It was clearly replacing the shattered party apparatus
 as the main channel through which policy instructions
 were issued and the main instrument by which these instruc-
 tions were supervised and enforced.  .In sum, the positions
 of Mao and Lin appeared to rest directly on the military
 loaders in Peking, in the regional headquarters and pro-
 vincial districts, and in command of armies.
 The "cultural' revolution" in the PLA itself, which
 had been substantially modified at the higher levels of
 the PLA and kept in very low gear at the lower levels,
 continued to move slowly.   In late February the Peking
 press appeared to be rejecting the notion--from what
 source was not clear--that revolution in the PLA itself
 should be speeded up, and it asserted that the revolution
 in the PLA was in fact "vigorously developing" in mine
 with Mao's and Lin's instructions.  The main visible evidence
 of this, however, was the continued appearance of poster
 attacks on PLA leaders.
 Lin Piao himself was not attacked, but remained
 out of sight, and speculation continued that his status
 was declining.  He may have been sick for a time, and he
 may even (as another military leader asserted) have been
 working out a theoretical rationale for the PLA's support
 of "power seizures," but there were probably not significant
 fluctuations in his status.  Most of the PLA leaders attacked

 the General Political Department who had apparently been
 added to the P].A/CRC (probably criticized for bonds with
 Liu Chih-chien, who was said by posters to have been
 replaced by Kuan Feng). Most of these attacks appear to
 have been speculative investments which failed; that is,
 most of those first attacked in this period continued in
 favor.   ]lsu Hsiang-chien came under additional criticism
 in this period, and he too continued for a time in favor,
 being identified in late March as a deputy chairman of
 the MAC, perhaps only recently appointed; but within two
 weeks, when the line changed, Hsu was to be hit hard in
 posters.
 The Leashing of the PLA, April 1967
 A counter-current to the conservative movement of
 the period from late January to sometime in March, in
 which the PLA dominated developments and dealt harshly
 with the most militant and disorderly of the "rebels,"
 became visible in March and was dominant by early April.
 Although Mao's opponents made no comeback, his most
 reliable ally, the PLA, was leashed again in April, and

 Lin's speech, as credibly reported in posters, was
 c, ' ; nt ::?~ st on several counts--e.g. , his admission of
 suL:,t,a tial production losses and many deaths in the
 courr',; of the revolution but his dismissal of this as
 necoss;:ry for the production of reliable "successor's,"
 hi S description of the party apparatus outside Peking
 as entirely "rotten" (the question being only that of
 degrees of rottenness), and his confirmation that his
 own health remained poor.  But the speech was of greatest
 interest for its clear signal of a change in line for
 the PLA.  Stating that the PLA was now in control of more
 than 7,000 party and government organs throughout China,
 Lin said that the conduct of the PLA in the present stage
 was of even greater importance than in the past struggle
 against Liu and Ting.   Citing the MAC's formulation of
 "ten points" (not made public until 6 April) to guide
 the PLA, Lin said that the most important of these were
 those restricting the PLA in its use of arms, physical
 force, and the power of arrest (the first, second and
 sixth of  the points as published).   Calling for the PLA
 to rely on the  'left" and admitting that it was hard for
 the PLA to discover the difference between left and right,
 Lin emphasized that PLA units were not to take action on
 their own initiative but were to act only on orders from
 above--not from the party committees outside Peking (all
 "rotten") but, presumably, from superior echelons of the
 PLA and local bodies dominated by the PLA.   This was the
 clearest possible indication that PLA units on the spot
 had mace many "errors" in' carrying out the directive-of
 23 January,, as Judged by Mao (if not Lin) in hindsight.
 Just two days later, on 1 April, a central committee
 directive reportedly told party committees and the new     25X1
 revolutionary 'ommittees everywhere (including those in
 military regions and districts) not to classify "rebel"
 organizations as counter-revolutionary without the central
 committee's perr,~ission, and forbade arbitrary arrests and
 physical humiliation.
 t ie leaders of the militant Red
 Guard organizations at the college and university level
 --leaders criticized in February--returned to the lime-
 light, making important (and militant) statements.
 On 6 April the Military Affairs Committee embodied
 all of this in a 10-point directive, endorsed, and ordered
 published, by MMao.  Declaring that the work of the PLA
 in supporting the revolutionary leftists had been "examined"

 for :,c               and found uneven in quality, the diree-
 tivcr i;,ipo ;cd sc?veru1 specific restrictions on the PLA and
 acWed several  inhibiting observations.   The directive as
 r(.pc-rt,ed in posters told the PLA not to fire on "rebel"
 groups but to confine itself to propaganda (it seems likely
 that the actual text did not impose an absolute prohibi-
 tion but instead ordered the troops not to fire except
 as a last resort), not to make "mass arrests" (only of
 hard-case individuals), not to classify rebel organizations
 as "counter-revolutionary" unless and until authorized
 by the MAC, not to initiate investigations of or legal
 proceedings against the rebels (one version called for
 investigations to continue but to be reported to the CRG
 or PLA/CRG), and not to use force (including physical
 humiliation) to extract confessions or to punish.  The
 directive as reported exhorted the PLA to remember class-
 standpoint (i.e. to recognize that the militants were on
 the right side), to recognize its main mission as propa-
 g'nn(Jn, to ensure that only "politically reliable" PLA
 cadres dealt with the masses so as to preclude rightist
 cadres from suppressing leftist rebels (the directive
 cited a deputy co:'.mander of the Tsinghai military distreict
 as guilty of the kind of "brutal" suppression o.' rebel
 groups which was now prohibited), to remember that the
 PLA itself must "obey' and "learn from" the masses, and
 to correct all its earlier mistakes in accordance with
 the foregoing.
 Lilt Piao's? speech of 30 March had taken away from
 the PLA most of the large degree of discretion it had
 enjoyed in dealing with disorderly elements and in sort-
 ing out local officials and competing revolutionary groups.
 And the spirit of the 6 April directive--and of editorials
 of 6 and 10 April calling on the PLA to be humble before
 the masses--was in sharp contrast to that of the 23 January
 directive.  That is, whereas the it-tent and effect of the
 23 January directive was that of restoring order, placing
 the party apparatus and the revolutionary rebels in sub-
 ordinate positions in which they would obediently play
 their assigned roles, the 6 April directive placed the
 restrictions on the PLA rather than on the rebels, with
 the predictable consequence that the most militant rebels
 would assert themselves more aggressively than ever.
 On the same day (6 April) that the new directive
 was issued, there appeared intensive poster attacks on
 IIsu Ilsiang-chien and Yeh Chien-ying, who had been prominant
 in the MAC in the period following the 23 January directive
 and who had probably played large roles in directing the

 conduct of  the PLA in that period.   Both the timing and
 the content of these poster attacks suggested that Hsu
 and Ych were to be held responsible for  'errors" in imple-
 menting the line of that period--that is, were to be the
 scapegoats for the mistakes of Mao and Lin, as Liu Chih-
 chien had been but as Yang Cheng-wu and Hsiao Hun (both
 close to Lin Pino) had escaped being.
 The poster charges against Hsu--made by the most
 militant of the Red Guards--emphasized that he had carried
 out the "Liu/Tong line" and had oppressed the revolution-
 ary masses (e.g. with "rectification") and suppressed mass
 organizations.   Secondary charges related to his conduct
 (as chief of the PLA/CRG since January) of the revolution
 in the PLA itself (he was held responsible for a 4 March
 directive on this matter which has not come to hand), his
 protection of discredited figures like L u Chih-chien but
 at the same time his use of Liu as a scapegoat to save
 himself, his responsibility for specific bad situations
 (Szechwan, where serious fighting was reported, and Hupei
 and Wuhan), his effort to restrict the role of Madame
 Mao (his "advisor') in the work of the PLA/CRG, and his
 opposition to Lin Pino in a recent MAC meeting (possibly
 on the matter of the change of line).  The poster charges
 against Yeh were similar although less emphatic, charging
 him with suppression of the revolutionary rebels, linking
 him with bad situations in several areas (Szechwan, Hupei,
 Tsinghai, Inner Mongolia), accusing him too of opposition
 to Lin in the MAC and to 'the Madame, and asserting that
 he had protected Madame Liu Shao-chi.
 on      pril, posters reported that M
 d
 a
 ame Mao (de
 facto chief of the PLA/CRG) had dismissed 11su and had said
 that the group (and/or revolution in the PLA) would be
 run by Hsiao, Hsieh, and Yang Cheng-wu .
 On 20 April, with the inauguration of the Peking 25X1
 Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Chinese leaders
 appeared to be saying that they would proclaim further

 "seizures of  power" only when revolutionary committees
 (or thA:; ty,?o had boon put together--meaning that most of
 wVou) d rci~ni n under the control of the PLA indefinitely.
 On this same occasion, Madame Mao tried to put the best
 i ac:c: on the differences between the MAC directive of 28
 January (a directive conciliatory to the PLA) and the
 directive of 6 April  (hard on the PLA), asserting that
 they had the same spirit.   They did not, but the Madame
 was making or trying to make an important point:   that
 MAO wanted it both ways,  that he hope(] and believed that
 both the Red Guards and the PLA w:.uld reward his caifidence?
 by correcting their errors (through their respective       25X1
 "rectification"  pro rams) and meeting in cooperation on
 a middle ground.
 Criticism of the rebels continued.   In fact, Kuni
 Ta-fu himself (the worst of all militants) publicly con-
 demned "anarchy" in mass organizations.    In the same week,
 officers of the central Cultural Revolution Group (includ-
 ing Madame Mao) met with rebel groups and told them again
 to stop fighting among themselves? and editorials of the
 ?         week again defended the?PLA.  But the thrust of develop-
 ments in the first three weeks of April was clear:   the
 PLA's control of events in China had been severely quali??
 f ied by the directives it was now operating under, and ??
 the PLA had been placed on the defensive.
 On 23 April, posters reported the recent promotion
 of four members of MAC to posts as vice-chairmen: Hsiao
 Rua, Ilsieh Fu-chih, Yang Cheng-%W, and Su Yu.   (Red Guard
 materials had indicated that Su,  the onetime chief-of-staff,
 in recent years had been concerned with national defense
 industries, and a reported speech by Chou En-lai on 30
 April also connected Su--along with Hsino and (Yang Shu-
 sheng--with these.)  At the same time, the MAC apparently
 quietly dropped Hsu Hsiang-chien as a vice-chairman; neither
 ilsu nor Yoh Chien-ying (who had been criticized in posters
 along with 1Isu) was denounced as a conspirator, or dis-
 graced, ana both, were identified as politburo members on
 May Day; but Hsu at least was evidently set aside as a
 military leader.  The status of Yeh--and of Nieh Jung-

 levc;  rr.i ] i tar',  leaders still clearly in favor, in addition
 to L: n Pino, were the four new vice-chairmen of MAC:  llsiao,
 11-icIi, Yangr, and Su.
 The most interesting question at this time was     25X1.
 that of the initiative for the radical ehanra in the em-
 phasis, during April, in the line governing relations
 between the PLA and the-"masses."  Only three leaders--Mao;
 Lin, and Chou--were believed capable of taking the initia-
 tive on a matter of this importance.   It seems probable
 that theinitiative was not Lin's, as he had been made to
 look foolish (the fate of all of Mao's lieutenants), no
 matter what other military leaders had been made to take
 the fall.   It also seems probable that the initiative
 ? was not Chou's, as he had shown a much greater concern
 for order than had either Mao or Lin.   That leaves Mao,
 who seems again to have declared his favor--as on several
 occasions in 1966--for the most militant elements of the
 "masses," accepting (at-.least for a time) whatever degree
 of disorder might ensue.

 Ui sc??(icyr Ada i n , "tay-Ju;ne 1967
 At the' ?i v Day rally, Mao and Lin put on display
 their first tc um, which leas taken the field on several
 occAsioIh Since:   the core of the politburo, Mao, Lin,
 Chou, Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng, and Li Fu-chun; the top-
 level military leaders  in addition to Lin), Hsieh Fu-
 chill, Ilsiao Hun, Yang Cheng-wu, and Su Yu; and five lead-
 ors of the central CRG and PLA/CRG, Madame Mao, Wang Li,
 Kuan Feng, Chi Pen-yu, and Madame Lin.
 This small, mismatched group was presiding over
 what appeared to be a deteriorating situation, in part
 the result of the 6 April directive placing crippling
 restrictions on the PLA and thus in effect inciting the
 Red Guards to make trouble.   Hsieh Fu-chih, who had as-
 sumed office on 20 April as head of the new Peking Muni-
 cipal Revolutionary Committee, is said to have described
 y:.                     situation in Peking itself as poor, because the left-
 ist rebels were again splitting up and fighting among
 themselves; he is said to have specified that serious
 fighting was going on in schools, factories and "various
 organs."  At the same time, there were reports of serious
 clashes in recent weeks in at least nine provinces; there
 were said to be especially severe in Szechuan, where troops
 of the Chengtu headquarters were re'nortedly embroiled with
 militants representing the 3rd Red Guard headquarters in
 Peking.
 Some observers expressed the belief at the time
 that most of these clashes--what Poking itself called
 "unprincipled civil war"--represented fighting among Red
 Guard organizations over their shares of the spoils,
 their strength in the new structure of power which was
 being or was to be built.   Even this issue--representation
 in the structure of power--would carry the Red Guards
 into cofiflict on some occasions with other elements in
 the structure, i.e. the party cadres in favor and the PLA.
 In addition, there was fighting between groups of workers,
 although probably not on the same scale.  Beyond this,
 however, much of the fighting (some observers thought
 most of it) represented "principled" struggle, with a
 pattern apparently emerging in which fighting Red Guards
 tended to divide between relatively conservative elements
 aligned with and defending the local authorities--pre-
 dominantly military leaders--and extremely militant ele-
 ments, apparently directed by Red Guards* from, Peking of
 the 3rd Headquarters type--who were attacking the local
 (generally military) authorities and the local workers

 and  clativcly conservative Red Guards- vho were aligned
 with them.   (There is no doubt that some of the attacks
 by      ini].ita nts included physical assaults on government
 and PLA pc. rr,conncrl an(j, on  1-%vernmcnt organs and PLA in-
 st..1lr:tions.)  This situation has apparently been confirmed
 in sonic instances, and some observers  anal       ' OCI,
 who have done more                                        than     25X1
 have others) believed that this situation was general,
 throughout China, and that it was the aim of the most
 militant of the Red Guards to discredit the PLA as a whole
 by forcing it to take actions which were forbidden it in
 the 6 April directive.   While this writer lacks the kind
 of knowledge of local situations which would permit a
 judgment as to a general pattern, it seems equally pos-
 sible that the pattern was not and is not general but was
 and is confined to a few provinces, a selective operation
 in which the leaders in Peking have been keeping pressure
 on some local leaders whom they do not entirely trust but
 feel obliged to work with for n time.   It is apparent that
 Poking has been keeping both forces--attackers and defend-
 ers---in the field, and these forces both seem to represent
 aspects of Mao's "thought." (It is very doubtful that any-
 one but Mao would have conducted the operation in this
 way.)   In any case, those observers at the time (May) were
 surely right who concluded that the disorders could not
 begin to be controlled unless and until the PLA was given
 a fresh mandate.
 Mao was not ready to reverse himself, however.
 According to later posters, Mao on 7 May directed Lin piao
 to give PLA units up to two weeks of "rectification"
 training.   In other words, his immediate concern was still
 more with correcting the faults of the PLA in dealing with
 the rebels than with the troubles caused by the rebels
 themselves.   As previously noted, Mao wanted it both
 ways--wanted the rebels too to carry out a "rectification";
 but the directives under which the PLA teas operating were
 not such as to give the rebels any incentive to correct
 their faults, or to encourage the PLA to help them to
 correct them.
 The line began to shift a bit in the 12 May editorials
 of People's Daily and Red Flag,- but the PLA was still
 put on  ? hc dcien ive. 'eop=e s Daily praised the PLA and
 asked the masses to recognize that its "general orienta-
 tion is correct," but the PLA was nevertheless enjoined
 to "sincerely learn" from and "humbly listen" to the
 masses, in order to learn, to recognize the leftist forces

 to bu supporting; this editorial was
 ally                for its confirmation that the 6
 April directive was being; "used to undermine"--that is,
 was loin;; interpreted correctly as being in conflict withN_
 the d i.rec t i vc:; of la tc January which had given the PLA
 the dominant role.   Similarly, 'Red Flag gave a list of
 arguments (undoubtedly used by some PLA and government
 leaders) in support of the case for strong measures to
 restore order--that the "revolutionary masses are dis-
 obedient," that "the left has also committed errors,"
 that "revolutionary mass organizationa are not pure,"
 that "organizations of various factions" (not only the
 militants) have their strong points, that revolutionaries
 are not concerned with production, that the situation
 is "confused"--but it also rejected each of these argu-
 ments; this editorial took note that the PLA had sometimes
 supported the wrong groups, and went on to imply that
 the PLA could hardly go wrong if it supported the most
 militant.
 Sometime prior to 14 ?slay , however, Madame Dlao, who
 was probably as gocd a friend as the Red Guards had but
 had been telling them for weeks to shape up, went so far
 as to say that Red Guard leaders (those ordering attacks
 on other Red Guard groups and on government and military
 organs) were "not necessarily following the central caimitl,6
 instructions."   (That "necessarily," seems to suggest
 a distinction between "principled" and "unprincipled"
 struggles.)  And on 14 Islay, the same day on which Red
 Guards reportedly invaded the Foreign Ministry and destroyed
 documents and beat up some Foreign Ministry officials
 and PLA personnel they found in their way, the Pelting
 'revolutionary committee served notice that it had had
 enough.   It issued a stiff six-point notice, obviously
 addressed to the most militant rebels; telling them that
 they must carry out Dlao's directive to use reas?.1n and not
 force and that offenders against this principle would
 be punished (it was specified that the Peking garrison
 command had the authority to take action), forbidding them
 to destroy or seize state property, calling for efforts
 to overcome the "anarchy existing in many localities,"
 speaking of the "sacred duty" of maintaining "revolutionary
 order" in the interest of protecting the state and state
 property, and telling all students (Red Guards) to return
 to their home areas.  Hsieh Fu-chih of the PMRC made a
 commentary on this notice, reportedly stating that there
 had been a great-increase in armed struggles in Peking,
 that more than 60,000 Red Guards had been involved, that
 there had been much beating, destruction, looting, and

 i.lle,;al search and arrest, and that the situation was getting
 tenor. ?U .
 While the situation in Peking apparently improved,
 there were still some serious incidents there, and reports
 of serious disorders continued to come in from the pro-
 vinces.   There were reports of large-scale clashes between
 the Red Guards and the PLA, with hundreds of dead, in
 Szechuan and Heilungkiang, and clashes between the same
 forces on a smaller scale in Honan and Hupei in central
 China, Fukien in the southeast, and Kansu and Sinkiang
 in the northwest.    Red Guard posters of course blamed
 the PLA for initiating these clashes, but neutral obser-
 vers
 placed the blame on the militant Red Guards. In  LJ..I
 view of the directives under which the PLA was then operat-
 ing, the judgment of those neutral observers was almost
 certainly correct, at least in the great majority of in-
 st:ance:.
 On 22 May, People's Daily finally called for an
 end to violence.   It took note that these clakhes had
 shifted the focus of the struggle, "wrecked production,"
 upset the "orderly process" (sic) of revolution, destroyed
 state property and taken lives.   It described "struggle
 by force" as a form not o-Of revolution but of "degenera-
 tion," cited both Lin Piao and Mao as opposed to it, and
 told the Red Guards either to resolve their disputes by
 discussion or agree to disagree.   It set forth the six
 points of -tile P1MRC notice of 14 May--prohibiting the use
 of force and destruction of property, calling for an end
 to anarchy and for maintenance of order, and sending the
 .Red Guards home--and.  implied that this notice was to be
 applicable throughout China.  The trouble was, however,
 that an implication of this sort was not nearly enough.
 What was still required was a new directive to the PLA,
 and some new, clear, tough directives to the Red Guard
 leaders in private talks.
 In the final week of May, there were reports of
 fresh clashes, all on a large scale and all involving
 the Red Guards and the PLA, in Sinkiang, Ronan, Chekiang,
 Kwangsi, Kiangsi, and both northern and southern Kiangsu.,
 What evidence there was still pointed to the militant
 Red Guards as the initiators.
 Some observers conjectured at the time that Poking
 had ceased to announce the establishment of additional
 three-way alliances and revolutionary committees in the
 provinces and municipalities because of the inability of

 the Chinese leaders in Pelting to agree on the people to
 be ntu.ed to lead them.   This may have been true in some
 instances, but the general explanation seems more likely
 to have been the inability of. the PLA leaders on the spot
 to come up with a slate which any of the leaders in Peking
 would approve or even one which they themselves (the PLA
 on the spot) would approve, and by the apparent fact that
 in many places the militant rebels were making so much
 trouble for the other components of the alliance that no
 further political steps could be taken until order was
 restored (again).
 A number of provincial broadcasts of the period
 suggested that disruptive activity by the rebels was ti'ze
 principal factor in their failure to make good progress,
 and the revolutionary committee in Shantung said this
 flatly on 28 May.  Noting that all of the things cited
 in the PMRC'notice of 14 May had also been taking place
 in Shnntung--"assaults, destruction, looting, confiscation,
 and illegal arrests"--the committee argued that this
 violence stood in the way of the "revolutionary great al-
 liance."  The lIonan Daily took note of the same develop-
 ments, and, speaking~"or a province with an unrecognized
 revolutionary committee and under the control of the mili-
 tary, emphasized the difficulties of operation  caused
 by the "struggle against the PLA"--including repeated
 assaults on PLA organizations--by the Red Guards there.
 The lIonan radio went over the same ground on 1 June,
 reiterating that the 6 April directive was being used
 to "undermine" the 28 January directive, describing the
 aim of the militants a ; that of bringing about a "state
 of wild confusion," and concluding that it was "necessary
 'to depend on guns...to maintain and consolidate political
 rower."  There were similar b2?4adcasts from other provinces,
 telling Pelting pretty clearly that it 'was time to send
 the PLA into action again.
 A joint editorial by Red Flag and People's Daily
 on 1 June stated Peking's agreement with tMs position
 The editorial affirmed that new revolutionary committees
 were "in preparation," but argued that, unless "anarchism"
 wore overcome, the struggle for "seizure of power" would
 be simply a struggle for power for "small groups" and,
 even after the seizure of power, it would be "absolutely
 impossible" for the agans of power to function.  Whether
 a now directive to the PLA was imminent was still debat-
 able, as Mao's own position was not clear; but there was
 no doubt of the need for it.

 It was an open question, however, as to whether
 the PLA would proceed aggressively under the terms of
 this directive.   It had been burned before, and it would
 serve Mao right if the PLA were to proceed very cautiously,
 allowing the party leaders in Peking to live with the
 disorder which their own earlier directives had encouraged.
 It seemed likely that some commanders would move aggres-
 sively and some would not.
 The Scale of the Purge of 1965-67
 It is generally recognized that the purge of the
 Chinese Communist party has removed something like three-
 ' fourths of the party leadership (from the level of pro-
 vincial first secretary up) as it existed in November
 1965 when the purge began, but the scale of the purge of
 the PLA leadership (from provincial commander up) in the
 same period--to June 1967--could perhaps not even be
 approximated by most observers.   A survey of the PLA lea(I-
 rship, in terms of key military organs, seems in order
 for a concluding section.
 As for the top-ranking military organ, the Military
 Affairs Committee of the central committee, the two prin-
 cipal officers, Chairman Mao and senior vice-chairman Lin,
 have of course remained in place.  But of the five other
 key figures as of late 1965--the four other vice-chairmen
 and the secretary-general--at least three have been purged
 or removed from their posts, and the other two may have
 been.  The three are vice-chairmen Ho Lung and Chen Yi,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/13: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010022-2
 and secretary-general Lo Jui-ching; the two uncertain cases
 arc Nish ,Junrr-then  (apparently still a vice-chairman as
 o1' ?1 June:) and Liu Po-cheng.  Of their three known replace-
 ments, up to April 1967, at least one, 11su llsiang-chien
 has already been removed as a vice-chairman; the status
 of o;ie, Yeh Chion-ying, is in doubt; only one, Hsiao Hun,
 who succeeded Lo Jui-ching as secretary-general, definitely
 remains.  The three new vice-chairmen (in addition to
 Ilsiao Hun, reportedly moved tip to vice-chairman in April)
 named only in April 1967--Hsieh Fu-chih, Yang Cheng-wu,
 and Su Yu--are still in place.
 The PLA's Cultural Revolution Group has not been
 hit as hard as the MAC, partly because it has been in
 existence only since October 1966 or thereabouts. Of its
 10 known officers in that period, only two have been
 purged or removed.   But those two were two of the three
 chairmen it has had in its brief life--Liu Chih-chien and
 llsu ltsiang-chien; and at least two of the other 10 known
 members of the group have beer. purged.
 As for the Ministry of National Defense, Minister
 Lin Piao has survived and prospered, but of the other 10
 ranking officers (nine deputy ministers and the head of
 the general office) as of late 1965 at least five are
 known or believed to have been purged--Lo Jui-ching and
 Tan Cheng, who were the two senior deputies, and Hsu
 Kuang-ta, Liao Han-sheng, and Hsiao Hsiang-Jung; one died,.
 Litt Ya-lcu; one is in doubt, Hsu Shih-yu in Nanking; and
 only three--Ilsiao Ching-kuang, Su Yu, and Wang Shu-sheng--
 seetrc still in favor.
 Of the 11 principal. officers of the General Staff
 ,Department as of late 1965, at least three have been
 purged--the then chief-of-staff Lo Jui-ching, deputy chief
 Yang Yung, and the director (as well as the deputy director)
 of the .;perations sub-department.  The status of two other
 deputies, Chang Tsung-hsun and Chang Ai-ping,  is in doubt.
 As for the General Political Department, director
 Ilsiao Ilea has survived and prospered,' but of the other
 six principal officers as of late 1965 at least two have
 been purged, deputies Liang Pi-yeh and Liu Chih-chien.
 No officer of this very tricky department is secure.
 Of thct directors of the other key departments and
 sub-departments (regarded as rear services, training,
 cadres, mobilization, intelligence, and security), less
 is known.,  Both of the two known directors seem to be in

 pl.a ?c; but both the identities and the status of the other
 roar are uncertain.   (Thus this, group will not be included
 in  the  suminnry.
 Of the 13 principal figures of the seven service
 headquarters as of late 1965--that is, the commanders and
 political officers, with one case of a le.-der holding both
 posts--only two are known or believed to have been purged.
 but the etatus of some others is uncertain.   Commander
 Wu Fa-hsien and political officer Yu Li-chin of the Air
 Force remain in place, having survived alleged intrigues.
 Commander Ifsiao Ching-kuang of the Navy b:is similarly stir-,
 vived, but political officer Su Chen-hua, an alleged iu-.
 triguor,  has been purged.  The commander and political
 officer of the Public Security headquarters, Hsieh Fu-chih,
 who apprehends intriguers, has prospered.   Commander 11su
 Kuang-ta of the Armored Forces has apparently been purged,
 but political officer Huang Chih-yung has survived.
 Commander Chen Shih-chu and political officer Tan Fu-Jen
 of the Engineers both appear to be in place.   Commander
 Li Shou-hsien of the Railway Engineers has been out of
 sight, but political officer Tsui Tien-min seems to be
 in place.   The commander and political officer of the Artil-
 lery Forces, 19u Ko-hua and Chen Jen-chi, have both boon
 out of sight.
 Of the 24 key figures of the 13 military regions
 as of late 1965--the commanders and political officers,
 with two instances of a single leader holding both posts
 in his command--at leas 11 had been purged or'replaced
 by early 1967, as noted in an earlier section.  Appoint-
 ments announced in posters in May bring the total, as of
 .June 1967,  to at least 13 of the 24; most of the appoint-
 ments reported in May were replacements for men known to
 have been purged, but two--Pan Fu-sheng as the new poli-
 tical officer in the Mukden headquarters, Chang Chun-chino
 as the new political officer in the Nanking headquarters--
 were replacements for men believed in favor or in question
 who had not been included in the 11 purged or replaced.
 The status of four more o!' the 24 remained in or had come
 into doubt, ,neaning that of the original 24 only seven
 were known to be in place and favor by June 1967.   Briefly,
 by headquarters;  the commander and political officer of
 the Poking military region were both purged; Inner Mongolia,
 the single man in both posts purged; Mukden, one in doubt,
 one replaced; Tsinan, one in pace, one purged; Nanking,
 one in doubt, o::e replaced; Foochow, one in place, one
 purged; -Canton, one in place, one purged; Wuhan, one in
 doubt, one purged; Kunming, one in place, one purged;

 Chc .;, Lu ,  both purged; Lanchow, both in place (the only
 iI-?>t r.:.,cc? o1? this);  Inner Mongolia, the single man in both
 post:, purged; Sinkiang,  the single man in both posts in
 place: but in doubt; and Tibet, both replaced, but one in
 another key post.
 Of the 44 principals in the 22 military districts,
 the figures as of June 1967 had not changed much from those
 of January 1967; it was now 15 known or believed purged
 or replaced, nine known or believed in place, and 20 in
 cloubt.
 In sum, of the 130 key military posts considered
 (a somewhat smaller number of individuals, as some served
 in more than one post), the occupants of some 46 of these
 posts are known or believed to have been purged or re-
 placed.                          If the figures were complete, the purge of the
 military leadership would thus have been on a scale of
 a bit more than one in three, or about half the scale of
 the purge of the party leadership.   However, the figures
 are not complete, and, as the status of the many indivi-
 duals in doubt is resolved, the casualties will surely
 prove to have been substantially greater than one in
 three, perhaps even as high as one in two.   Thus the purge
 of the military leadership has been at least half as
 large as that of the party leadership and perhaps even
 two-thirds as large--a purge substantially smaller than
 the party purge, but probably larger than generally
 recognized; and. the purge is not yet over. .
