 Peking's sensitivity over the security of its
 southeast flank, as well as its increasing impatience
 with Hanoi, was vividly illustrated late last month
 in a sharp People's Daily attack on "foreign aggres-
 sors" in the South China Sea.
 The question of sovereignty over two major is-
 land groupings in the area--the Spratlys and the
 Paracels--has been a major annoyance in Sino-Viet-
 namese relations since the Chinese took the Paracels
 from the former Saigon government in January 1974.
 Both Peking and Hanoi have periodically reiterated
 their claims to both island groups, but neither side
 had openly pushed the issue in public.  The Chinese
 even declined to respond to Hanoi's announcement
 last May that North Vietnamese forces had captured
 several of the Spratlys--500 miles south of the
 Paracels--from the former South Vietnam government.
 In September, the Chinese turned up the heat
 on the islands issue just prior to North Vietnam
 party chief Le Duan's visit to Peking; they publicly
 reiterated their claims to the disputed islands and
 recalled for the first time in months the 1974 take-
 over in the Paracels.
 Last month's broadside was by far the toughest
 Chinese statement on the dispute since early 1974.
 It amounts to the first direct challenge of Hanoi's
 claims to the islands and emphasizes the serious-
 ness of Peking's determination to regain all con-
 tested islands.   The article asserted that China's
 December 9, 1975

 claims date back 2,000 years and cited archeological
 and other evidence to support the claims.   Chinese
 sovereignty over all the islands was described as
 both "sacred" and "inalienable."  Peking's demand
 that all the disputed islands must be returned to
 Chinese control was juxtaposed with its long-held
 pledge to "liberate" Taiwan, a clear indication not
 only of the importance the Chinese attach to their
 claims, but also a sign that Peking may be prepared
 to wait some time for a final solution of the issue
 --as it is in the case of Taiwan.
 In an apparent attempt to avoid any confusion
 about the primary target of Peking's blast, the ar-
 ticle employed language that played down the signifi-
 cance of claims other parties have to the Spratly
 Islands.   The Nationalist Chinese claim all of the
 islands and maintain a military garrison on one, but
 the People's Daily reference to the fact that many
 of the islands are still not "in Chinese hands"
 rules out the possibility that Peking was referring
 to the Nationalist presence there.  Peking is doubt-
 lessly confident that Nationalist claims will be re-
 solved when the much larger Taiwan question is
 settled.
 The Philippines also claim some of the islands
 in the Spratly group.   Peking has never made an is-
 sue of Manila's claims, however, and, when diplomatic
 relations between the two countries were established
 earlier this year, both sides agreed to settle all
 bilateral disputes without resort to force.   Peking
 seems prepared to put aside the disagreement with
 Manila.
 Although People's Daily left no doubt that Hanoi
 was the major object of its wrath, its attack on Hanoi
 was implicit:  references to Moscow in the blast were
 explicit and vituperative, leaving no question that
 Peking believes the Vietnamese are abetting the So-
 viets in an attempt to expand Russian influence into

 the region.   Significantly the article was published
 only two days after Le Duan returned to Hanoi from
 Moscow--where he received a much warr.:~r welcome than
 he had in Peking, gained a Soviet agreement to pro-
 vide substantial economic aid to North Vietnam, and
 seconded Moscow's views on detente end on interna-
 tional peace and security.   Peking insLsts that both
 detente and the recent Helsinki security pact are
 Soviet "tricks" designed to facilitate what the Chi-
 nese see as Soviet "expansionism,."  Le Duan's en-
 dorsement of detente', puts Hanoi squarely in Moscow's
 camp on an issue of major importance to the Chinese
 and was almost certainly read in Peking as a deliberate
 provocation.
 In fact, the trea?_nent Le Duan received in Peking
 last September contzasts sharply with the rousing
 welcome he got in Moscow.   There was no joint commu-
 nique to mark his China visit, and the Hanoi leader
 failed to tender the normal farewell banquet prior
 to his departure for home.  Moreover, Le Dun went
 to,Peking with the hope of signing several economic

 he Chinese gave less    an
 Tne   ast working-level Vietnamese
 negotiator left China in mid-November after three
 months of talks--without any indication of further
 progress.  His departure virtually rules out the pos-
 sibility of any additional economic agreements between
 the two parties, at least for the time being.
 The Chinese clearly see a correlation between
 Hanoi's increasing tilt toward Moscow and the long-
 range possibilities for Soviet "meddling" through
 Vietnam in the South China Sea, as well as Southeast
 Asia generally.   It also is apparent that the Chinese
 consider control of islands in the area vitally im-
 portant to their security.   The People's DaiZy ar-
 ticle, in fact, refers to the region as "an important
 gate of China" and to the islands as located on major
 shipping lanes.

 For their part, the Soviets have been sharply
 critical of the Chinese seizure of the Paracels.
 Since early 1974, Moscow has routinely attacked
 China's claims to all of the islands and its use of
 force in the Paracels.   The Soviets, however, have
 stopped short of providing outright support to Hanoi's
 counterclaims.   Soviet maps still show the islands,
 as belonging to China, although recent press comments
 have implied that they were Vietnamese.  A Soviet
 official recently said Moscow considers the status
 of both island groups as "undetermined."  Peking
 ignored these attacks until last week.  Then, the
 People's Daily article asserted that the Soviet
 Union, throwing aside earlier support for China's
 claims, mounted a "venomous" assault on Peking
 after the Paracels incident.
 Peking's long-term concerns almost certainly
 hinge on its view of Soviet intentions and activities.
 Chinese leaders also seem persuaded, however, that
 in the shorter run Hanoi could unilaterally disrupt
 their hopes of developing a bloc of friendly countries
 along China's southern border.  The Chinese and Viet-
 namese share very few common perceptions of Southeast
 Asia.  They are clearly on opposite sides in the cur-
 rent dispute between Thailand and Laos.  Hanoi has
 vigorously defended tha Lao side and has launched
 frequent attacks on Thai "aggression."  Peking, on
 the other hand, has remained relatively quiet on the
 subject, privately lobbying for a peaceful solution
 to the disagreement and encouraging improved relations
 between the two countries.   The Chinese have been by
 far the largest contributors to Cambodian reconstruc-
 tion since the communists took over there last spring.
 Peking has also made it clear that it was on Cambodia's
 side in the border dispute with North Vietnam and ap-
 parently encouraged the Cambodian Communists to open
 diplomatic relations with Thailand.

 cadre are being advised to stand firm in the face
 of alleged Vietnamese attempts to "occupy" Chinese
 territory.  Althouth these putative border incidents
 have not been confirmed and there is very little
 likelihood that a serious border dispute will develop,
 the fact that the Chinese continue to talk about
 such incidents suggests that Peking is determined to
 maintain a degree of anti-Vietnamese feeling along
 the border.

 The Tachai Campaign:   Provincial
 Returns Come In
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-'ping reportedly described
 the September-October "learn-from-Tachai" conference
 as the most important meeting held in China since
 the communist take-over.  While Teng was obviously en-
 gaging in hyperbole, his remark underlines the im-
 portance that has been accorded to the Tachai campaign
 in the last few months.   Tachai now overshadows this
 year's two other major campaigns--strengthening pro-
 letarian dictatorship and criticizing the classical
 novel "Water Margin."  Reporting on virtually every
 organization     China is now in terms of learning
 is mass campa.Lgh
 will be further broadened witn      convening of a
 series of national. meetings on other economic sectors
 and on culture.  A national coal conference has al-
 ready been held.
 Most provinces have held a series of mass ral-
 lies and other meetings to publicize the major ad-
 dresses at the conference by vice premiers Teng
 Hsiao-ping and Hua Kuo-feng, and to send off youths
 and cadres to rural areas.  The New China News Agency
 reported on November 25 that over one million cadres
 from 1.2 provinces had already gone to communes to
 engage in manual labor and to direct production.
 Most of these cadres appear to be from the hsien
 (county) level, although a number of provincial and
 prefectural leaders have also gone to the country-
 side.  The function of the latter cadres seems to be
 to ensure that local cadres perform their duties with
 the necessary zeal.  Morale among local cadres has
 been badly shaken by a series of purges and campaigns
 dating from the Cultural Revolution and their reputa-
 tion has been tarnished by publicity accorded to ex-
 amples of corruption, sexual indiscretions, and a

 lack of initiative.  Domestic propaganda has made it
 clear that the hsien, and especially the hsien-level
 party committee, is the key level in administering
 the campaign.   Indeed, cadre rectification at the
 hsien level and below is one of the major themes of
 the camnaian.
 The Tachai campaign already seems to be the
 most clearly defined and well-orchestrated campaign
 since the Cultural Revolution.  Given its scope, am-
 bitious goals, and rising volume of rhetoric, there
 is at least some danger that things could get out of
 hand.  But if current moderate leaders remain healthy
 and in agreement and can successfully manage the cam-
 paign with other efforts to correct trouble spots in
 the economy  fairly impressive gains may well be in
 the offing.

 Two top leaders have recently reappeared after
 significant absences.  Chiang Ching was present on
 December 1 at the meeting and picture taking session
 between President Ford and Chinese head of state Chu
 Te. Her last appearance was on October 15 at the
 closing session of the national Tachai conference in
 Peking.   Chiang's political power has been sharply
 diminished this year, and her appearances now seem to
 be under the control of regime moderates and designed
 to promote an, image of unity.   In the past, Madame
 Mao tended to punctuate periods of nonappear.ances
 with public activities that were designed to raise
 rather than lower political tensions.  Her association
 with the Tachai meeting was obviously meant to present

 France:   No Plums for Sauva nar ues
 F77             I
 French Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues' five-
 day visit to China last month was apparently less
 than a total success from the French point of view.
 IThe French foreign minister told
 repor ers that he had been unsuccessful in his ef-
 forts at reopening talks on the Concorde.  Chinese
 claims that French prices were "not competitive"
 indicate that discussions on other sales were equally
 unproductive.       Officials in Sauvagnargues' party ad-
 mitted that the only concrete result of the visit
 was an agreement to expand cultural exchanges.
 Despite their apparent disinclination to break
 any new economic ground with Sauvagnargues, the Chi-
 nese did express general satisfaction with Sino-French
 relations--indicating that if President Giscard
 d'Estaing's visit does not produce any pleasant eco-
 nomic surprises neither will it be marred by any un-
 pleasant political disagreements.

 Both sides placed far more emphasis on congruent
 views on such matters as the need for European mili-
 tary and economic cooperation.  Peking used the occa-
 sion of Sauvagnargues' visit--coming as it did soon
 after the Rambouili.et summit and before the Paris
 Conference on International Economic Cooperation--to
 voice support for European efforts at easing economic
 confrontation with the Third. World.  Peking has long
 believed that further hardening of the confrontation
 would work to Moscow's advantage and sees Paris--
 with its strong residual ties to former colonial
 clients--as having a special role to play in promoting
 compromise between developed and developing nations.
 A People's Daily editorial published a week before
 Sauvagnargues' arrival in Peking stands as the most
 explicit Chinese endorsenyen.t yet of the establis -
 ment of a "Second World - Third World" dialogue.

 The Kwangsi Connection
 w   Lung First Secretary Wei Kuo-cheng have had _a
 long and intimate relationship
 lin 1930 the
 t   e pe  to organize the 7th Chinese Peasants'
 Red Army in Kwangsi.  They were survivors of the
 force that eventually joined Mao in the Kiangsi
 soviet in 1931.  Both took part in the Long March
 (1934-35) but joined different units; Teng went
 with Liu Po-cheng while Wei joined Chen I's forces.
 Following the Communist victory in 1949, Wei
 became mayor of Fuchou, while Teng assumed more sub-
 stantial national and regional posts.  The two may
 have had an opportunity to work together briefly
 in 1950.
 g, who  as a reputation fcr bringing
 s up on his own coattails, may have been a
 major sponsor of Wei for his first important provin-
 cial assignment.

 in 1957, following two years of crop failures,
 Wei survived the dismissal. of three top Kwangni of-
 ficials accused of mishandling relief grain.  The
 defense that Wei was out of the province during the
 period cannot be refuted but seems flimsy; his sur-
 vival suggests high-level support in the party, per-
 haps from Teng.  As his survival of the Cultural Rev-
 olution attests, Wei undoubtedly has had well-placed
 backers other than Teng, but Teng's influence seems
 paramount.  Teng moreover, has championed minority
 causes, and Wei is from the Chuang minority.   In
 his report on the 1953 Electoral Law and the 1957
 Report on the Rectification Campaign, Teng made major
 allowances for minorities.   In the 1957 speech he
 advocated a moderate approach to settling minority
 problems--a stance criticized during the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Teng's support of Wei may have been returned in
 kind.   Wei, who joined the Politburo in August 1973,
 four months before Teng was reinstated, has been in
 a position to support an old ally's resurgence to
 power while simultaneously advancing his own career.
