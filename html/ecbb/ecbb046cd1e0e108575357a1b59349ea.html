 Approved For Release 2003/12/02: CIA-RDP7,8,
 the conclusions reached in an authoritative
 article by Sam Peltzman in the New Individ-
 ualist Review:
 "If what we mean by public interest here
 is the satisfaction of market demands, in
 all their variety, at lowest social cost and,
 as part of this, the quick adaptability to
 changing market conditions, then our his-
 tory indicates that this interest is best served
 by competition free of arbitrary interference
 by State power.
 "We have not given free competition a
 chance in this industry.  We might do worse
 than to try it."
 PEONS, COOLIES, AND BRACEROS
 (Mr. GONZALEZ (at the request of
 Mr. ALBERT) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, the im-
 portation of foreign workers is no new
 thing; the braceroprogram is just an-
 other variation on a very old theme.
 History shows that this country in its  Hit        Assistant Secretary ofd
 formative years was short of labor.  To orrEastern Affairs, personally ex-
 fill the gap, indentured servants were        perienced in this special kind of war-
 used.  Indentured servants were bound
 to a master for a specific length of time-
 not unlike the modern bracero. In addi-
 tion to indentured servants, we had
 slaves to perform what is now called
 stoop labor.  As time passed and man
 progressed, both indentured servants and
 slaves passed from the scene.
 In the era of railroad building, we find
 that the railroads utilized another form
 of cheap, captive labor.  Thousands of
 Chinese were used in railroad construc-
 tion gangs.   These coolies were often
 brought in under a contract which ex-
 changed their labor for passage to the
 United States. The importation of Chi-
 nese labor eventually reached such pro-
 portions that legislative remedies were
 demanded-the Oriental Exclusion Act
 resulted.
 But there were yet other markets for
 cheap labor. Many entrepreneur: turned
 to Europe.   Workers, skilled and un-
 skilled alike, would be contracted to per-
 form work for a company or persons
 over a period of'2 or 3 years in exchange
 for passage to this country.  By the
 1880's this contract labor reached scan-
 dalous proportions, and again legislative
 remedies were demanded.
 In 1885, a law was passed which pro-
 hibited the contracting of foreign labor-
 ers. Thus it would seem that the system
 of captive labor had at last come to an
 end.  But here today, in the 20th cen-
 tury-78 years later-we find that the
 contracting of foreign labor is carried on
 with the blessing of our Government.
 There is essentially no difference be-
 tween the indentured servant and the
 bracero; nor is there much difference be-
 tween the coolies of the 19th century and
 today's bracero.  Neither is there much
 difference between the contracted labor-
 er of the 1880's and today's bracero. Yet
 all these captive laborers passed from
 the scene by 1885.  I would respectfully
 urge my colleagues not to perpetuate
 Public Law 78-let us end one more form
 of captive labor.
 ANSWER TO EXPORTED
 AGGRESSION
 ALBERT) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD  and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. RODINO.  Mr. Speaker, an effec-
 tiV'e'defense program must be able to
 respond to all levels of aggression. To-
 day we find increasingly that the chal-
 lenge to free and democratic govern-
 ment is in the form of?  erri                                              warfare
 in the underdeveloped areas of   the
 wor   ""ignorance, not ideology, causes
 such areas as -southeast Asia, Africa,
 and Latin America to be the seedbeds
 of Communist activity; discontent in
 these strategic areas makes them liable
 to Communist propaganda.
 Militarily;' guerrilla warfare demands
 radically different organization, strategy
 and equipment from those of conven-
 tional combat.  The Honorable Roger
 fare, discusses this problem in his arti-
 cle, "The Answer to Exported Aggres-
 sion," which appears in the tissue
 of the General Ele     Forum. I
 As I       " Theaay aone W1Ln other
 excellent pieces from this magazine, I
 am calling to the attention of all my
 colleagues, along with all those who read
 the RECORD, this provocative analysis of
 our crucial task in an ever more import-
 ant field:
 An  expert on  count                tactics
 suggests that "Vie tIf  l a twilight   r for the
 villages may yet rank as one of the decisive
 battles of world history."  Secretary Hilsman,
 a former World War II guerrilla fighter him-
 self, stresses that this form of hidden aggres-
 sion poses a threat to the entire free world-
 that the- Communists see guerrilla wars in
 Africa, Asia, and Latin America as the best
 way to expand their empires with the least
 risk.  To meet this exported aggression ef-
 fectively, Secretary Hilsman says:
 "We must adopt the methods of the guer-
 rilla himself-the very tactics our ancestors
 learned from the Indians.
 "Our long-range goal must be 'nation-
 building'-aid  which  includes  the  many
 things an American pioneer village needed.
 "The really important appeal of the West
 is the respect for the individual which is
 built into Western culture."
 Question. Secretary Hilsman, the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff have defined counterinsur-
 gency as the military, political, economic,
 psychological,  and civic actions taken by
 existing governments to defeat subversive in-
 surgency.  Would  you  subscribe  to this
 definition?
 That is a very reasonable definition, par-
 ticularly as applied to the Far East-namely,
 the Philippines, Malaya, and currently Viet-
 nam.  But I would broaden it slightly by
 stating that the real problem is one of ex-
 tending government control to areas where
 governments   have   never   had   control
 throughout history.  In a broader sense this
 means providing government services to the
 villages, knitting the people into the fabric
 of the whole community and national life.
 In southeast Asia today, there is no per-
 vasive national spirit as we know it.  The
 villagers in the back country still feel no
 deep  loyalty to their government, which
 seems much further from them than ours
 does from us.  Since most of the villagers
 make nearly all the material goods they use,
 they have relatively little commercial, polit-
 ical, or psychological contact with other vil-
 lages or the provinces around them.
 In such circumstances, there does not have
 to be a basic discontent with the government
 for a guerrilla unit to thrive.  It is just a
 question of the villagers' isolation.
 Recently, in northeast Thailand, a govern-
 ment team visited 40 villages-not particu-
 laarly isolated ones, either.  In 10 of them
 the people had never seen a government offi-
 cial-no policemen, no firemen, no health
 inspectors, no one.
 In villages like these, it is relatively easy
 for an outside subversive power to recruit
 young men for guerrilla bands by simply
 promising sheer adventure, just to get away
 from the borning, monotonous tasks of an
 agricultural life.
 For example, in my Personal experience
 with the OSS in Burma during World War
 it eve?l.'ound only about 10 percent of the
 people to be pro-West.  Another 10 percent
 were proenemy, but the rest  were  either
 indifferent or else just so isolated that they
 had no ideological convictions one way or
 the other.  Yet we. were able to recruit over
 30,000  guerrillas  for      fRtlone   in
 Bi71'fri            "a'" Aur.. white faces.
 To  raw a parallel with a situation closer
 to home, one may ask whether the citizens
 of Chicago "supported" the hoodlum gangs
 which flourished during the  1920's. Cer-
 tainly the shopkeeper hit by the protection
 racket did not support the gangs, but he
 often had no choice except to go along with
 them.  The same thing is true in many of
 the isolated villages in some of the under-
 developed areas of the world.
 Question.  In the past, you have defined
 this guerrilla activity in southeast Asia as
 internal war, or hidden aggression.  What
 do these terms imply?
 The terrorist activity in Vietnam is really
 aggression in the truest sense of the word.
 Over the centuries international  law has
 categorized aggression as an overt attack.
 But here we have, as President Kennedy
 has said, "a subterranean war," which doesn't
 fit easily under the doctrines of international
 law.
 I call it hidden aggression, or twilight
 warfare,  because it is an attack directed
 across  an  international  boundary.  It  is
 clearly an attempt by one state to bring
 down    another  by exported terror.  From
 North Vietnam, the Communists are sending
 in trained cadre, propaganda, money, equip-
 ment, and directions to the Viet Cong ter-
 rorists in South . Vietnam.   All the while
 they try to maintain the fiction that it is
 an internal uprising.
 The pattern of the Vietnam war so far has
 followed closely Mao Tse-tung's three stages
 of guerrilla warfare.  In the first stage, sym-
 pathizers are recruited and indoctrinated,
 and abase is built from which weapons, rice,
 and other supplies can be distributed.  The
 second stage is one of terror, hit-and-run
 tactics, ambushes, night attacks, and assas-
 Einations.  This is the stage in which we are
 engaged now.  Finally, in the  third stage
 Mao says there must be a change to a true
 civil war where the terrorist bands are turned
 into conventional armies to fight the regulars
 by conventional means.  As a practical mat-
 ter, the Communists hope to create enough
 political chaos and instability so that the
 government will fall by a coup d'etat, let-
 ting them move in and skip the third stage.
 WE MUST ADOPT GUERRILLA TACTICS
 To fight this exported aggression effec-
 tively, we must adopt the methods of the
 guerrilla himself-the very tactics our an-
 cestors learned from the Indians.  We must

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 realize that the guerrilla does not care about
 north or south, or east or west.  He doesn't
 care about this town or that piece of real
 estate.  He lives to fight, to .ambush, to kill.
 His only goal is to kill-not to seize and hold
 territory.
 It is nonsense to assume that regular forces
 trained for conventional war can handle
 jungle guerrillas adequately.  Regular forces
 are essential for regular military tasks, but
 twilight warfare is something special.  It is
 a war of shadows in the night which calls
 for radical changes in organization, combat
 doctrine,  and  equipment.     The  main  in-
 gredients for success are constant patrols,
 good  communications, mobility, and a ca-
 pacity  for  rapid  concentration.                      Our   key
 units might be decentralized groups of 50
 men, self-reliant and able to operate autono-
 mously, fanned out Into the surrounding
 countryside.
 Let me again draw on my experience in
 Burma.  At one stage my outfit-consisting
 of  4  Americans  and  200  Burmese-kept
 an  entire  3,000-man  Japanese regiment
 marching and countermarching through the
 mountains far away from the front where
 they would have done more good.  What we
 would have feared most would have been
 smaller  groups  patrolling steadily.  The
 Japanese were much  better soldiers than
 our guerrillas.  They were better trained,
 tougher, and more mobile.  But they fought
 us as if we were regular troops.  We never
 tried, to take or hold ground.  We laid am-
 bushes, fired our weapons, and ran just as
 fast as we could. After a month of chasing
 us, this 3,000-man regiment had over a hun-
 dred casualties; we had only 1.
 ONE  OF  HISTORY'S  DECISIVE    BATTLES
 Vietnam's twilight war for      the villages
 may yet rank as one of the decisive battles
 of world history. In one sense, it is no
 more or less decisive than an effective de-
 terrent against a Korea-type war, nor is it
 more or less decisive than an effective stra-
 tegic nuclear deterrent.  However, even as
 we have prepared for both conventional and
 nuclear wars, the Communists have been
 giving increased emphasis to internal war-
 fare.              Of course, we can take some credit
 for their change in strategy. Our nuclear
 force buildup has paid off and so have our
 efforts to build ground fortes, our alliances,
 and our sacrifices in Korea.
 Now the Communists are beginning to see
 possibilities for guerrilla wars in Africa, Asia,
 and Latin America as the best way to ex-
 pand their empires with the least risk.  So
 the Vietnam war is quite decisive, in the
 first place, because unless we develop an
 effective counter there, we may well find our-
 selves in the same difficulty in some of these
 other areas.  Secondly, this war is decisive
 in that the steps needed to fight it are the
 very steps needed for building the new na-
 tions of the world into independent, self-
 sustaining states.                          Our job in Vietnam is as
 much political and economic as it is mili-
 tary-the long-range task is nation building.
 WHAT ARE THE STEPS INVOLVED IN NATION
 BUILDING?
 To become a stable nation, Vietnam needfs
 much more than dams, power station, steel
 mills, and other giant foreign-aid projects
 which will have to come sooner or later.
 This sort of foreign aid is important, of
 course, but on a longer-term basis.  In the
 short term, these people need more simple
 aid such as communication routes, so that
 goods and services can flow freely from vil-
 lage              to  village  throughout  the  country.
 There must be a way for information about
 the needs of the people to flow upward, and
 a way for government services to flow down-
 ward to               answer   these  needs.  They  need
 health programs, police security, educational
 systems, economic help, sewer systems-the
 very things many an American pioneer vil-
 lage needed over 100 years ago.
 TRA    II; HAMLET PROGRAM
 An im                    rtant part off this nation-building
 program is to provide the villagers with the
 physical security so necessary to peaceful
 progress.                This is what the strategic hamlet
 programs does.                  We are helping the villagers
 ring their villages with barbed wire, much as
 our frontier towns were protected with stock-
 ades.                                                                     Then 20 or 30 in a village of 200 are
 trained to use weapons such as hand gre-
 nades, shotguns, and carbines.  And they are
 given a radio with which they can contact
 province headquarters for help if_ they are
 attacked by a large band of terrorists.
 But the strategic hamlet program involves
 far more than just physical security.   It
 is  also a vehicle  for  getting government
 services to the people to help enlist popular
 support for the government. And as the gov-
 ernment becomes more popular, and as more
 villages are secured, the Viet Cong will be
 isolated  more  and  more   from  their  key
 sources of supply-the villages of the back
 country.  No longer will marauding bands
 of five or six guerrillas be able to walk into
 villages and either seize or buy rice.
 If they can't get into the villages, and if
 they are occasionally ambushed themselves,
 will the Viet Cong then start to wither?
 That's right. By cutting off this important
 supply line to the villages and by keeping
 them on the move, we will begin to make the
 guerrillas  suffer from lack of food,  from
 hunger, and from discomfort. They will be-
 gin to dry up.
 Of course, we are not at that stage yet in
 Vietnam.    However, we have come a long
 way and have made much progress recently.
 During the last half of 1962, outlying villages
 containing roughly half  a million  people
 were made secure by the government, bring-
 ing the share of rural population in secured
 villages to about 51 percent.  The Viet Cong
 controls about 8 percent.
 This still leaves around 40 percent of the
 rural population unsecured.    It is to this
 group that the Government must extend its
 services and control in the next phase.
 In the mountain regions during the last
 year we have helped the Vietnamese train
 over 37,000 Montagnard tribesmen in the use
 of simple weapons, how to set up village de-
 fenses, and how to patrol areas between vil-
 lages.                                                                     But one Special Forces team I know
 of is most proud of a completely nonmilitary
 kind  of  project-a  village  market.   They
 went to the province capital and persuaded
 a tailor, a tobacco merchant, and a general
 store operator to move to the Montagnard
 village where they were stationed. Then they
 persuaded the villagers in the area to start
 producing a surplus of what they grow, and
 to bring the excess to the market where they
 could sell  it  and  buy  thimbles,  needles,
 thread, pots, pans-the instruments for a
 better life that they could never have'before.
 This isn't warfare in the usual sense and
 it isn't killing Viet Cong.  But it is the real
 way to fight the Communist terror.   It is a
 vital step in nation-building, and that is our
 long-range goal.
 Question. Secretary Hilsman, it has been
 said that the Communists are offering  a
 "spiritual" challenge to the people in Asia,
 telling  them,  "We  need  you desperately,
 whoever you are, whatever you can do. Ours
 is the revolution of the future.     You can be
 the liberators of mankind."              -
 In contrast, it has been said that the
 American appeal offers no such "cause" but
 merely a slight material gain through our
 aid and assistance programs.  We have been
 told that there really isn't  an  "American
 side."  Is this theory true, or half-true, or
 is it completely inaccurate or obsolete?
 There is no question in my mind that this
 theory is completely obsolete. In terms of
 appeals, the Communists are not doing at
 all well.  The normal Communist ideology
 does not cut much ice anymore. Where they
 do make headway, they capitalize on an
 appeal to nationalism, or they use threats
 of terror and retaliation.
 The theory about American appeals is also
 obsolete.  We have a spiritual appeal that is
 a  truly  revolutionary  one-a government
 interested in the wants and needs of the
 people.   In the past, government has usu-
 ally meant-if anything-an official who col-
 lects grain or yams and gives nothing in re-
 turn.  So we have a revolutionary appeal to
 excite and inspire these people-the simple
 but very effective concept that government
 exists to serve and protect them.
 In a sense, the whole nation-building pro-
 gram has a revolutionary, spiritual appeal,
 not only in Vietnam but in all the world's
 underdeveloped areas.   This is really  the
 guts of the Alliance for Progress program,
 except that in Vietnam nation building must
 proceed under the guns of Communist ter-
 rorism.  The barbed wire and guns of a stra-
 tegic hamlet program would not be needed
 in a country not under attack as Vietnam
 has  been,  but the  civic  action  certainly
 would.
 But the really important appeal of the
 West is the respect for the individual which
 is built into Western Culture.  In contrast,
 the whole Communist bloc leans toward a
 monotonus grayness-the Tibetans should
 act like the Chinese, the Chinese like the
 Russians, and the Russians like the Poles.
 There is not the diversity which is found in
 the free world. .
 What can industry here  in the Unite
 States do to help these countries build-thelif,
 civilizations?  For example, Dr. Wernher von
 Braun has said that much of the success
 of the space program has resulted from the
 individual contributions and innovations of
 private industry.  He told us that he spends
 a substantial part of his time "trying not to
 drown in all the many ideas which come to
 us."  Do private companies face this same
 kind of challenge in "nation building pro-
 grams" as they have already faced in aero-
 space and defense?
 They most certainly do.  There are many
 areas of science and technology where new
 ideas can help Vietnam and similar coun-
 tries to discover new approaches to their
 problems.  Right now scientists in this coun-
 try are on the brink of some discoveries in
 genetics which are just as dramatic  and
 exciting as the discovery of the nuclear re-
 action.   Some of them may help to solve
 many of the tremendous problems in disease,
 overpopulation, and food shortages.
 To help break the Illiteracy problem we
 may  be able  to  use  a  communications
 satellite, providing a country with a com-
 plete                                                                                                                                 television  network  which  could  be
 picked up on television sets powered by wood-
 burning generators.  We could Increase a
 teacher's exposure a hundred times.
 Chemistry, biology, electronics, physics-
 every science you can name-may have some
 answers if we can get researchers to focus
 on the problems.
 How optimistic are you that our nation-
 building program will succeed in Vietnam?
 Do you have a time-goal in months or years?
 Right now about Vietnam I am optimistic
 -but cautiously so.  It is not a question of
 winning a battle or defeating an army.  It
 Is a question of building a nation, and that
 takes time.  So far things are going rather
 well, but we have to think in terms of years
 instead of months.   It will be some time
 before you can go anywhere in Vietnam with
 a feeling of complete safety and security.
 Of course all the new nations like Vietnam
 need time.  No magic of science can trans-
 form their way of life overnight.  It took
 7 years to eliminate guerrillas in Malaya.
 It may take more than this in Vietnam, or
 it may take less.  But I think time is on
