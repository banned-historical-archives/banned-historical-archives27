 USSR - CUBA - U, S.
 FBIS TRENDS
 3 OCTOBER 1979
 Moscow's reaction to President Carter's 1 October TV
 address on the issue of Soviet combat troops in Cuba
 has been relatively restrained and balanced.                             In the
 only substantial treatment thus far, a TASS account
 issued on the 2d was predictably critical of the
 military measures the President announced but went to
 some length to play up his appeal in behalf of SALT II.
 This treatment contrasts with the sharper reaction to
 the President's remarks on the troop issue in Queens
 the previous week, which had drawn the first Soviet
 criticism of the President personally since the issue
 arose.  An authoritative assessmer:t of the current
 state of Soviet-U.S. relations may be forthcoming when
 Brezhnev makes his scheduled speech in East Germany
 this weekend.
 Havana wasted little time in issuing its own direct
 indictment in a GRANMA editorial on the 3d which
 criticized the speech as contradictory and ambiguous.
 Ticking off the military measures announced by the
 President, GRANMA assailed the presence of U.S. forces
 in Guantanamo in traditional rhetoric, mentioning
 without comment Washington press reports that the
 United States will soon deploy 1,500 Marines to the
 base "as part of the Caribbean maneuvers."  GRANMA saw
 the maneuvers and other measures as an attempt to
 intimidate the "revolutionary" countries in the
 Caribbean and Central America.  It branded his state-
 ments on the Soviet troop presence as half-truths, in
 effect shutting the door President Castro had left ajar
 a few days earlier when he had said the President
 could extricate himself from the situation by "telling
 the truth."  Apparently stung by the President's
 remarks in Queens, Castro had broken his silence on
 the issue in two interviews with American newsmen in
 which he refused to "lower" himself by explaining Cuba's
 military installations and regretted having to conclude
 that President Carter had "not been honest."
 MOSCOW REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS ON USSR TROOPS IN CUBA
 Following brief initial reports on President Carter's address, Moscow
 issued its only substantial account in a Washington-datelined TASS
 report on the 2d that was disseminated to both domestic and foreign
 audiences.  The TASS account balanced criticism of the President for

 endorsement of his appeal for nuclear arms control and specifically
 ratification of SALT II.  Moscow's guarded approach was reflected
 in remarks by Brezhnev to visiting Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis
 on the 2d.   After stressing the importance of European efforts
 toward achieving detente, according to TASS, Brezhnev took note
 of recent developments "causing grave alarm" that made imperative
 further efforts by all states to promote detente and arms control.
 The TASS account of the President's address carefully skirted
 sensitive issues such as increased surveillance of Soviet activity
 in Cuba, the 1962 understanding, and recent Soviet assurances,
 while taking note of those military measures--a permanent Caribbean
 task force, increased military maneuvers, and an enhanced rapid
 deployment capability--of the type Moscow normally exploits to
 denigrate U.S. policies.
 TASS went to some length to replay the President's appeal on SALT II.
 Thus, after citing the President as saying the Soviet troop issue
 is no reason for a return to the cold war, TASS quoted the passage
 from the early part of the speech on the U.S.-Soviet relationship and
 the two countries' shared interests in nuclear arms control, and it
 juxtaposed to this his call in the concluding section for ratifica-
 tion of SALT II.  The account ended by citing the President's remarks
 on the dangers of playing politics with these basic issues of national
 security and arms control.
 TREATMENT OF PRESIDENT     Less than a week before the President's
 speech, Moscow had sharply attacked him
 personally for his remarks on Cuba and the Soviet Union at a town
 meeting in Queens on 25 September.  Moscow previously had carefully
 refrained from associating the President by name with the "campaign"
 over the Soviet troop issue and had ignored his 7 September statement
 in which the President said the "status quo is not acceptable."
 The strong criticism came on the 27th--the day Secretary Vance and
 Foreign Minister Gromyko held their second meeting in New York--
 in back-to-back items:  a widely broadcast commentary by TASS
 political observer Goncharov and a TASS dispatch from New York,
 published in PRAVDA the next day.
 Goncharov complained that President Carter's remarks contained
 "unfounded and crude attacks" on Cuban policy and a "demand in an
 ultimatum-like tone" that the status quo be changed.  Noting that
 the President at the same time expressed the intention to keep U.S.
 troops and military bases in "close proximity" to Soviet borders,
 Goncharev characterized this approach as "unlawful" and "inconsistent."
 The even more caustic TASS account of the President's remarks
 complained that he "resorted to a number of rude and tactless
 sortie-" against Cuba and warned his audience "in a threatening tone"
 that the United States could take some action to change the situation.
 TASS added briefly that after all "these fabrications, attacks, and

 threats" the President, in a later speech, called on the Senate to
 ratify the SALT II treaty and not play politics with the nuclear
 arsenal.
 The criticism was echoed the following day, when TASS Director General
 Losev, in an English-language broadcast, said the President's
 language "sounded like an ultimatum."  But by the 29th, after the
 announcement of the upcoming television. address, Moscow shifted
 attention away from the President and began publiciz:,*ng remarks and
 views of Vice President Mondale, Senator Byrd, George Ball, and
 various groups decrying any linkage between the Cuban problem and
 SALT ratification.   PRAVDA's weekly international review on the
 30th suggested Soviet cooperativeness--on SALT--and rigidity--on
 Cuba:   The Soviet Union has never refused to take into consideration
 the national interests of its partners for negotiations, PRAVDA
 said, and Soviet policy in detente and curbing the arms race is
 based on principles of "reciprocity, observance of equal security
 of the sides, and consideration of their legitimate interests."
 However, it cautioned, "attempts at dictating" norms of inter-
 national conduct to the USSR on the plea of the principle of
 reciprocity are "obviously without prospect."
 HAVANA ASSAILS PRESIDENT FOR "HALF-TRUTHS,' "INCONSISTENCIES"
 A stinging response to the President was issued by the Cuban party
 daily GRANMA in an editorial on the 3d, broadcast in full by Havana
 radio in view of "the importance of the article."  GRANMA said that
 while the President had "pulled back cautiously" from his previous
 statements on the length of time the military installation has
 existed in Cuba, he failed to make the "pertinent conclusions" and
 resorted to "half-truths which are also falsehoods."  The editorial
 called the President's statements "profoundly contradictory":  on
 the one hand, he affirms that the current problem does not warrant
 a return to the cold war, but on the other hand, he adopts cold
 war measures.   GRANMA contrasted the President's "dramatic" appeal
 for the ratification of SALT II--which the paper said had been
 jeopardized by President Carter himself--with the military measures
 outlined in his 1 October speech, saying these measures constituted
 "a policy of blackmail., pressure, and threats of power in open
 antagonism of world peace."
 nutommicoiy decontrolled

 The initial Cuban reaction came in a short PRENSA LATINA report--
 four hours before Moscow's first mention of the speech--which
 highlighted the President's "admission" that the Soviet "training
 center" poses no threat to the United States.   Subsequently,
 Cuban media have provided fairly detailed accounts of the President's
 remarks relating to Cuba.   GRANMA, as reported by Havana's
 international service on the 2d, noted that the President "reported
 on his talks with the Soviet Government"--an aspect ignored by

 TASS--and cited him as saying the Soviet "replies" were "significant"
 but that several measures would be taken.  Like GRANMA, Havana's
 domestic service enumerated the measures, and both reports noted
 the President's remark that the controversy does not justify a
 return to the cold war and cited him as urging the Senate to ratify
 the SALT II treaty.
 CASTRO INTERVIEWS     Prompted by President Carter's remarks in
 Queens, in which he called Cuba "in effect a
 puppet" of the Soviet Union, President Fidel Castro responded sharply
 in a press conference on the 28th followed by an interview with CBS'
 Dan Rather on. the 30th--his first public statements on the Soviet
 troop issue.  Havana's domestic service on the 30th carried a recording
 of the press conference, and the interview with Rather was televised
 for Cuban viewers on 1 October.
 In rejecting the U.S. charges, Castro asserted that Soviet military
 "personnel" were in Cuba to train Cuban troops, that what the United
 States called a "brigade" was "in fact a training center," and that
 there had been "absolutely no change" in this "facility," which
 he said had been established following the Cuban missile crisis in
 October 1962 in conformance with U.S.-Soviet agreements.  Castro
 stressed, however, that since Cuba was not bound by the 1962
 U.S.-Soviet understandings, he felt no obligation to justify the
 Soviet presence in Cuba or to explain Cuba's military facilities
 or defense to the United States.  As usual, Castro pointed to the
 U.S. base at Guantanamo to support his argument that the United
 States has "no legal or moral right" to question any Soviet military
 presence in Cuba.
 While Havana in the past had generally avoided direct criticism of
 President Carter, Castro labeled as "dishonest, insincere, and
 immoral" what he termed attempts by the President to portray Cuba
 and the Soviet Union as taking "some new and irresponsible steps"
 to change the status quo.  He called it "inconceivable" that
 President Carter--"unlike previous U.S. presidents from Kennedy to
 Ford"--could have been unaware of the existence of the "training
 center."  Despite his criticism, Castro portrayed President Carter
 as a victim of "bad information" and suggested that the President
 could extricate himself from the situation by "telling the truth."
 Like Moscow, Castro contended that the issue had been contrived
 in an effort to discredit Cuba during the nonalined summit conference
 in Havana last month.  And in what amounted to a reverse linkage,
 Castro also suggested that the Carter Administration was now trying
 to use the SALT II treaty to "make demands on Cuba."

 LIMITED PRC REACTION TO PRESIDENTS SPEECH ON USSR BRIGADE
 Chinese attention to the President's address has thus far been
 limited to brief, straightforward reports on the speech's main
 points and on steps taken to increase the U.S. troop presence at
 Guantanamo.  With an eye toward SALT II treaty ratification
 prospects, XINHUA on 3 October briefly summarized both favorable
 and unfavorable Senate reaction to the speech.
 Beijing had given considerable play to the Soviet brigade issue
 prior to the President's address, portraying the unit's presence
 in Cuba as a clear Soviet challenge to U.S. interests and depicting
 the Administration as vacillating in the face of Soviet intransi-
 gence on the issue.   Chinese treatment of this issue has paralleled
 that of previous instances of what Beijing has characterized as
 weak Administration responses to Soviet tests of American resolve,
 most notably over the neutron bomb deployment issue and over
 conclusion of the SALT II treaty itself.
 Initial Chinese comment, carried in RENMIN RIBAO on 4 September,
 had suggested that the Administration, beset with domestic economic
 difficulties and concerned about the SALT II debate in the Senate,
 was adopting a "low-key" approach toward a new "test" of the
 Administration's firmness in dealing with Moscow.   Subsequently,
 a XINHUA commentary on 16 September characterized talks between
 Secretary Vance and Soviet Ambassador Dobryinin as a facesaving
 device for the Administration to evade the consequences of its
 earlier statements on the unacceptability of the brigade's presence
 in Cuba.  Shortly before the President's address, XINHUA on the
 28th reported that Secretary Vance's talks with Soviet Foreign
 Minister Gromyko had produced no sign of Soviet flexibility on the
 issue, but noted that the President had pledged to change the
 status quo on the issue; XINHUA predicted, in a separate dispatch,
 that the success of the President's efforts to promote ratification
 of the SALT II treaty would depend on his subsequent handling of
 the Soviet brigade affair.

 USSR-CHINA
 MOSCOW MARKS PRC ANNIVERSARY IN STANDARD FASHION
 With the delegations to the Sino-Soviet political
 negotiations having opened "preliminary" meetings,
 Moscow's guarded approach to the prospect of
 better relations was reflected in its observance
 of the PRC's 30th anniversary on 1 October.  The
 Soviet greeting message and other formalities
 accorded with established practice in recent years,
 and Soviet commentary on the occasion followed
 standard lines in recalling the importance of
 Sino-Soviet cooperation in earlier days while
 deploring changes in Chinese policies since the
 late 1950's.
 Following the format used over the past decade, Moscow sent a
 state-to-state greeting message, which contained expressions of
 goodwill toward the "Chinese people" and reaffirmations of Soviet
 intent to pursue improved bilateral relations on the basis of
 the principles of peaceful coexistence.   Typically, in enumerating
 those principles, the message included nonuse of force, an element
 that is not a part of Beijing's standard version and has been a
 subject of contention in recent years.
 Commentary on the anniversary, including articles in PRAVDA,
 IZVESTIYA, and the academic quarterly PROBLEMS OF THE FAR EAST, has
 essentially adhered to the line taken in recent years.   Thus, a
 1 October PRAVDA article, by I. Lebedev, played up the Soviet role
 in the Chinese revolution and the early development of the PRC and
 deplored the sharp turn in Chinese policies in the late 50's when
 Mao Zedong's nationalistic faction set out on a great-power,
 "hegemonistic" course hostile to the Soviet Union.   The article
 recited a series of Soviet proposals over 15 years for improving
 bilateral relations, proposals to which Beijing's response has
 been "invariably negative."  The article concluded by noting the
 opening of negotiations in Moscow, but it made the outcome
 contingent on a change in the Chinese approach.
 Moscow has taken only tentative note of the changes in Chinese
 policies being adopted by the post-Mao leadership, though these
 changes to a large extent mean the repudiation of many of the
 Maoist policies that Moscow has castigated.   Thus, PRAVDA observed
 that it "is now starting to be said in China" that 20 years have
 been wasted in the country's development because of Maoist policies,
 but the article offered no suggestion that this reassessment
 might augur a more propitious setting for Sino-Soviet relations.
 This issue was addressed in an editorial article in the latest
 Automoticolly decontrolled

 issue of PROBLEMS OF THE FAR EAST (No. 3, signed to press
 31 August), an academic journal where a more forthcoming Soviet
 assessment of Chinese developments might be signaled.   The
 article acknowledged that Mao's successors had shifted the
 focus of internal policy from ideological revivalism to economic
 development, but it complained that this shift was still sub-
 ordinate to "militarist" and "hegemonistic" foreign policy goals
 and hence inconsistent with China's genuine interests.  Moreover,
 the article stressed that the new leaders had made no change in
 the anti-Soviet, militaristic course established by Mao.
 Consequently, the "international progressive community" has no
 doubt that present-day China is a "dangerous instigator of world
 war."

 KOREA-VIETNAM-CHINA
 CHINESE TROUBLES WITH DPRK. SRV REFLECTED ON ANNIVERSARY
 The PRC 30th anniversary on 1 October has provided a
 measure of Beijing's troubles with its Asian communist
 neighbors.  As`ro be expected, the event received only
 the barest min      observance by Hanoi, which
 reciprocated Bei'ng's move a year ago by removing
 party ties from its greeting message.  Pyongyang's
 treatment of the anniversary, while correct in form,
 reflected the curre\t cooling trend that may derive
 from differences of 4ttitude toward the U.S. presence
 in East Asia.
 PYONGYANG     There have been no clear indications of what issues
 may underlie the six-month-long cooling trend in
 DPRK-PRC relations, but the question of U.S. troops in Korea appears
 to be a source of contention.  Last month the Chinese editorial on
 DPRK national day failed to cal  for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.*
 The 1 October NODONG SINMUN edit rial on PRC national day recalled
 Chinese support for Korea but fai ed to claim Chinese backing for a
 U.S. pullout, as editorials on this anniversary in 1977 and 1978
 had done.  And for the first time since 1973, NODONG SINMUN failed
 to characterize Chinese backing as 4 source of encouragement or
 inspiration to the Korean struggle.`
 In line with this more subdued approach, the NODONG SINMUN editorial
 seemed to play down China's overall itn ortance.  Unlike editorials
 on this anniversary in recent years, this time the editorial omitted
 any reference to the importance of Korean-Chinese friendship for the
 situation in Asia, and it failed to mak6 the usual claim that
 Chinese successes encourage the "world p`eople."  NODONG SINMUN may
 even have been diminishing the significance of the Chinese revolution
 by reviving a Kim 11-song quotation, last', used in an anniversary
 editorial in 1971, which ranks the Chines  revolution second in
 significance behind the Great October Revc\lution.
 Signs of apparent cooling in relations appeared throughout Pyongyang's
 treatment of the anniversary, many of them similar to those that
 appeared on the same occasion in 1977, whe  Sino-Korean relations
 also seemed troubled.  The Korean leadershi   turnout at the PRC
 ambassador's reception in Pyongyang on 1 Oc ober was higher than
 usual--appropriate for a decennial--but the rank of the Korean
 speaker at the event, a Political Committee candidate member, was
 below the norm.  From 1970-78 full members illed that role, except
