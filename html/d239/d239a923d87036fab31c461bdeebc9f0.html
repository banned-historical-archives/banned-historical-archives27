 INDIA:   Although the device exploded in the
 Indian nuclear test last Saturday was indigenously
 produced, New Delhi was able to build it only by tak-
 ing advantage of technology and materials provided
 by Canada and, to a lesser degree, the US and the
 USSR.   The nuclear material itself almost certainly
 came from the Canadian-built CIRUS research reactor
 at the Bhaba. Atomic Research Center at Trombay.
 The CIRUS reactor, which has been in operation
 since 1960, has used heavy water provided by the US
 to slow the flow of neutrons.   Some of India's heavy
 water requirements have also been filled by imports
 from the USSR.   The CIRUS reactor uses natural ura-
 nium that comes from Indian mines.
 Since the early 1960s, the Indians have been
 producing weapons-grade plutonium from the irradiated
 fuel used to power the reactor.   This work has been
 done at an Indian-built chemical separation plant
 also located at Trombay.
 The only reactor safeguard agreed to by New
 Delhi was a written statement to the Canadians that
 the reactor and its products would be used only for
 peaceful purposes.   Canada has long held that any
 explosion would be a violation of this agreement,
 but India has never accepted this interpretation.
 A Canadian official said yesterday that Ottawa for
 the present is suspending all shipments of nuclear
 equipment and material to India and is ending all
 exchanges on nuclear technology.

 PORTUGUESE AFRICA:   :Portuguese authorities are
 optimistic about relatively peaceful political settle-
 ments in Angola and Portuguese Guinea, but they are
 expressing grave reservations about the future of
 Mozambique.
 In a private discussion with the US ambassador
 in Lisbon on May 20, General Costa Gomes, the number-
 two man in the junta, expressed fear that a referendum
 on self-determination in Mozambique would result in
 a vote for independence and would be followed by civil
 war.   He based his fears on the rapid deterioration
 in relations between Mozambique's blacks and whites in
 recent years and the bitter ethnic rivalries within
 the territory's African majority.   Costa Gomes also
 expressed concern that should the insurgents win
 political control in Mozambique, Chinese influence
 over the insurgents would preclude any future ties
 between Lisbon and the territory.
 Costa Gomes is more optimistic about the future
 of Angola and Portuguese Guinea, where there is less
 racial and ethnic antagonism.   In Angola, none of the
 three competing liberation groups is politically or
 militarily capable of pressuring Lisbon into negotiat-
 ing independence on its terms.
 The prospects for ending the war in Portuguese
 Guinea are good.   The two sides will begin cease-
 fire negotiations in London on May 25.   Lisbon rec-
 ognizes that the insurgents form the only organiza-
 tion of any consequence there, and the Portuguese,
 therefore, might be willing to recognize their claim
 to the territory.
 Costa Gomes' views are probably shared by many
 other officials in the provisional government.   De-
 spite his reservations, he reiterated his belief that
 the government must follow through in its commitment
 to give the territories'  inhabitants a free choice in
 deciding their future.   His scenario for Mozambique
 may be unduly bleak, particularly with regard to his

 estimate of Chinese influence.   His comments on ra-
 cial and ethnic tensions, however, are close to the
 mark, and these tensions presage a dangerous political
 situation for the territory.
 The provisional government's commitment to self-
 determination for the territories, including the op-
 tion of independence, was emphasized publicly this
 week by Interterritorial Minister Santos in a press
 conference in Lourenco Marques.   Santos expressed
 the belief that Mozambique would opt for independ-
 ence and that a black government would come into
 being in the territory.   His statements came as
 dramatic news to his listeners, but were really only
 a restatement of the provisional government's basic
 position on self-determination for the territories.

 SOUTH.VIETNAM:   Increased Communist military
 action is continuing in the northern provinces but
 falling off in most other areas. The latest actions,
 consisting largely of rocket and mortar shellings,
 have been directed at the provincial capital of Tam
 Ky, the Quang Ngai airfield, and several other mili-
 tary and civilian targets in the northern coastal
 area.   Only scattered ground contacts have been re-
 ported in this region., however, since elements of
 the South Vietnamese 2nd Division on May 20 abandoned
 their efforts to retake lost territory in southern
 Quang Tin Province.
 Communist attacks have decreased significantly
 in the central provinces, but Route 1--the only north-
 south land link--remains blocked because of the de-
 struction of three bridges by Communist sappers.

 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS:   The dollar?s
 e xten a   ec.ine ?w Ic   ates 5     to m d-January--
 may finally be over.
 --US interest rates have been rising in recent
 weeks, and this has encouraged dollar purchases.
 --A general consensus has apparently emerged
 in the market that the dollar's decline has
 gone too far, considering the relatively favor-
 able outlook for the US current account.
 --Participants in the market also believe
 that central banks are now prepared to inter-
 vene to prevent a decline in the dollar.
 Press reports of a central bank agreement to halt
 the dollar?s decline helped push it up sharply last
 week.  The dollar gained about 3 percent against the
 German mark, the Dutch guilder, and the Swiss franc
 in the six trading days following the reports.
 Smaller gains were recorded against most other major
 currencies.
 The impact of the reported agreement in Basel on
 May 14 among the US, Swiss, and West German central
 banks to support the dollar has so far been largely
 psychological.   Token dollar purchases by the West
 German central, bank, coupled with inaccurate press
 reports of US and Swiss intervention, convinced the
 market that the authorities would force up the ex-
 change rate of the dollar.

 NETHERLANDS-NATO:   The initial NATO response to
 the Netherlands' draft ten-year defense plan, which
 would significantly reduce active Dutch military
 forces, has been overwhelmingly negative.
 The Belgian representative at the NATO Defense
 Planning Committee meeting on May 21 was particularly
 incensed.  Branding the Dutch plan "disastrous" and
 "brutal," he said it was a breach of the Netherlands'
 commitments to NATO and raised doubts about Alliance
 solidarity.   He pointed out that the proposed Dutch
 reductions would increase the defense burdens of the
 other member countries, and added that the request
 for a formal NATO reply in one month represented
 questionable consultation procedure.   He also ex-
 pressed fear that the Dutch proposals would set a
 precedent that might be contagious.
 The US, UK, and West German representatives
 associated themselves with the remarks of their
 Belgian colleague.   The chairman of NATO's Military
 Committee summed up the opposition when he stated
 that the Dutch proposals went beyond the point where
 quality could substitute for quantity.
 Adverse NATO reaction has been anticipated--even
 counted on--by Dutch opponents of the plan.   The De-
 fense White Paper has only provisional approval of
 the Dutch cabinet and Prime Minister den Uyl's five-
 party coalition is deeply divided,  for the first time
 on a major issue, over the cutbacks.   The left wing
 of the coalition, including members of Den Uyl's own
 Labor Party,  does not feel that the reductions go far
 enough, while the two centrist Christian Democratic
 parties have warned the government that drastic re-
 ductions are "unacceptable."   Defense Minister
 Vredeing and Foreign Minister van der Stoel are
 adamantly opposed to Dutch defense efforts'  falling
 below a certain level and are reportedly prepared to
 resign over the issue.

 A final cabinet decision is scheduled for June
 21, but NATO has asked that it be postponed at least
 until June 24.   Should NATO voice strong formal op-
 position, Vredeling and Van der Stoel, backed by the
 Christian Democrats, would almost certainly demand
 that the defense paper be reconsidered.   Any conces-
 sions by Den Uyl could split his own party and drive
 the leftist Radical Party from the coalition.
 A cabinet crisis cannot be ruled out, but two
 factors militate against it.   None of the five coali-
 tion parties appears anxious for an election now, and
 there is no alternative government leader of Den Uyl's
 stature in sight.   Den Uyl, however,  is known to be
 frustrated by his government's slow progress on im-
 plementing social reforms.   He is aware that recent
 opinion polls show that support for NATO is rapidly
 .diminishing in the Netherlands, and he is also mind-
 ful of his party's election promises to reduce de-
 fense expenditures.  He may become even less amenable
 to compromise if his party does well in the nation-
 wide municipal elections on May 29.
 UNITED KINGDOM:   London is prepared to approve
 plans for a US naval and. air base on Diego Garcia,
 according to a high-ranking official in the British
 Foreign Office.   The assurance: was conveyed on May 17
 to the US ambassador to India,who is visiting London.
 The remarks of the British official appear to
 remove any doubt about the Labor government's will-
 ingness to conclude a base agreement.   Former Prime
 Minister Heath's Conservative government had reached
 an agreement in principle with the US, but the base
 agreement appeared to run counter to the Labor gov-
 ernment's expressed interest in supporting various
 international moves to create a zone of peace in the
 Indian Ocean.

 INDIA:   Firm government action has broken the
 nationwide rail strike that began on May 8.   Although
 the strike has not ended officially, rail employees
 are returning to work in increasing numbers,  and
 train schedules are approaching normal.
 Prime Minister Gandhi still refuses to resume
 negotiations with the rail unions until the strike
 is called off.   The government, emboldened by the
 success of its hard line, may be unwilling to grant
 any significant concessions, or even agree to an of-
 ficial settlement of the strike.   Union leaders,
 meanwhile,  are divided over whether to fight on or
 accept defeat.
 Although industrial production has declined be-
 cause of transport disruptions,  the overall economic
 effects of the strike are less severe than were an-
 ticipated.   Industrialized eastern India has been
 hardest hit, but steel production there reportedly
 had fallen off even before the strike went into ef-
 fect on a nationwide basis.   In most urban centers,
 food prices are rising, but adequate supplies of
 basic commodities have been maintained.
 The government's success in refusing to be in-
 timidated by the nation's largest single group of
 employees may help to cool other discontented govern-
 ment and quasi-government employee groups.   It is
 unlikely, however, to have any significant impact
 on labor in the private sector, which accounts for
 80 percent of the country's industrial production.

 CHINA:   Chou Not Well, But Still in Charge
 Age has finally caught up with China's 76-year-
 old premier, Chou En-lai., forcing a change--probably
 permanent--in his operating style.   He has cut down
 on his onerous protocol functions in order to concen-
 trate on important matters.   He seems still very much
 the man in charge of running China.
 Chou's health could, of course, continue to de-
 cline and force a further curtailment in his activi-
 ties.                           Such a contingency could present dangers in
 that Chou has been instrumental in keeping domestic
 affairs on a relatively even keel and in executing
 Mao's policies toward the US.
 Beginning this month,  a new pattern has emerged
 in Chou's dealings with visiting foreign dignitaries.
 The premier has skipped the physically taxing and
 time-consuming aspects of these visits--airport re-
 ceptions and send-offs and state banquets.   He has
 met the visitors at the state guest house, accompanied
 them to meetings with Mao, and conducted the opening
 round of talks, leaving the follow-up discussions to
 vice premiers Li Hsien-riien and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Chinese officials have attributed the change en-
 tirely to old age rather- than to any specific illness,
 and have suggested that Chou'::, lighter workload would
 allow him to concentrate on more important matters.
 Politburo member Chi Tenq-kuei said the party
 Central Committee had agreed to reduce Chou's proto-
 col responsibilities and that with a reduced workload,
 health would not prevent him from working "normally"
 on "other matters."   Chi. added that Chou is still very
 much in control of day-to-day affairs.
 Anti-Confucius Campaign
 Foremost among the "other matters" demanding
 Chou's attention is almost certainly the anti-Confu-
 cius campaign,  now in its tenth month.   The premier

 has undoubtedly been deeply involved in the repeated
 and only partially successful attempts from the cen-
 ter to keep the campaign from getting out of hand.
 Central Committee directives setting strict limita-
 tions are finally having some impact in the provinces.
 Political wall posters have been removed from unau-
 thorized areas,  and provincial media have in some
 cases called for obeying party instructions   to the
 letter."
 There is still much to do.   At least some of the
 attacks on provincial leaders may not have official
 party sanction, and factionalism,  including armed
 conflict, remains a problem in a number of places.
 Although the students, who were disruptive in the
 early stages of the campaign,  are not finding the
 propaganda support they once had,
 to many schools.
 calm has not yet been restore
 The resolution of the campaign, which probably
 will include the fall of certain top party leaders,
 is still in the future.   Chou's lower public profile
 has led to speculation outside China that the pre-
 mier is on the losing end of the anti-Confucius cam-
 paign and has been pushed into the background by his
 political opponents,  led by Mao's wife Chiang Ching.
 Tt is far more likely that pressure from his op-
 ponents kept Chou in a more active role for longer
 than he originally intended.   In order to provide
 visible evidence of his continuing political health,
 he did not begin to reduce his public appearances
 until he had the situation in hand.   Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping reportedly said last January that
 Chou would not be meeting as often with foreign visi-
 tors because of his old age.
 Chianq_China's Challenge
 in February, Chiang Ching and her supporters
 made a strong bid to gain control of the anti-Confu-
 cius campaign,  launching a savage attack in the cul-
 tural sphere that seemed aimed at a top party official.

 Chiang and her backers also brought pressure on the
 moderates led by Chou to adopt a stiffer propaganda
 line on certain foreign :policy questions like Taiwan.
 Chou did not alter his public activities until
 after he seemed to have successfully weathered Chiang
 Ching's challenge.   Her cultural attacks have not
 claimed a high-level victim, and PRC media have not
 repeated the line of last February that seemed to al-
 low for a military liberation of Taiwan.
 There also is speculation that Chou is preparing
 to resign.   Recent photographs showing Teng Hsiao-ping
 in Chou's usual seat to Mao's right with Chou on Mao's
 left suggest that Teng, for now at least, is the front
 runner to replace the premier when the time comes.
 Barring Chou's death or incapacitation, that time will
 probably not come soon.
 The party theoretical journal Red Flag ran an
 article last November--and it has been republished
 this month--that speaks disapprovingly of an ancient
 prime minister who resigned under political pressure,
 using ill health as a pretext. The article notes
 that the reformist programs of the prime minister,
 policies that closely resemble Chou's, had to be
 abandoned because the prime minister was more concerned
 with his "personal safety" and. "family fortune" than
 with outmaneuvering his opponents in order to preserve
 his reform.
 Chou Will Not Give Up
 Chou has survived decades of political infight-
 ing and is not very likely to abandon the struggle
 now, especially because the policies now at issue will
 affect China well after his,  and Mao's, death.   Among
 these is Sino-US detente, referred to in the Red Flag
 article as "making friends with distant states."
 Because Chou,  like Mao, is deeply committed to
 this and other policies, the message Red Flag is con-
 veying seems to be that the resignation of the ancient

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/11/03: CIA-RDP79T00975AO26400240001-2
 prime minister was a bad mistake and ought not be
 repeated.   Indeed, the article implies in another
 historical account that the anti-Confucius campaign
 is necessary to protect current "Chouist" reforms,
 domestic and international,  and that the resigna-
 tion of the premier would be a disaster to China.
 For a quarter of a century, Chou has thrived on
 a backbreaking schedule unmatched by any of his col-
 leagues.   Even with a reduced workload, Chou's bur-
 dens are qreater than those of other Chinese leaders.
 In recent years he has done everything from approving
 editorials in the party newspaper People's Daily to
 persuading Mao to upgrade academic standards in the
 universities and complaining about the performance of
 the foreign trade ministry.
 in addition, he has always functioned as his own
 foreign minister, a task that has increased dramati-
 cally with China's expanding diplomatic contacts.
 Sharing the Burden
 From the start of the Cultural Revolution in
 1966, Chou has until lately had only one major helper,
 Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien, an economic. specialist
 and perhaps Chou's closest personal associate in the
 leadership.  With the political rehabilitation a year
 ago of Teng Hsiao-ping, the premier began to transfer
 more responsibility to both Li and Tenq.
 Either would be a logical successor, but Teng
 has been given more prominence recently and, as a
 former secretary general of the party, is the more
 politically experienced of the two.   Both have been
 careful to mention Chou when they have stood in for
 him in the last two weeks,  and they will probably
 continue to defer to him.
 Should Chou depart, both men would want to con-
 tinue present policies, but lacking power bases of
 their own and the close working relationship with
 Mao that Chou has,  they would probably be less suc-
 cessful than Chou in resisting leftist pressures.

 Following the reduction in his protocol burdens,
 Chou has been mentioned in the Chinese media more
 frequently than he would have been if he had not re-
 duced his protocol activities.  At least two foreign
 visitors have been officially described as visiting
 China at Chou's invitation, an unusual formulation.
 The Chinese have been at obvious pains to quell any
 rumors from within China or without of Chou's polit-
 ical demise.
 This concession to public opinion may eventually
 be abandoned as the world gets used to seeing less
 of Chou.   But if,  as seems the case, Chou's political
 influence remains undiminished, the premier does not
 have to be seen in order to be effective.

 Ecuador:   Limited oil reserves and inflationary
 trends caused by the rapid inflow of revenue have
 prompted the government to curtail production.   The
 Texaco-Gulf consortium, which accounts for 98 percent
 of Ecuador's approximately 240,000-bpd output, may
 have to be cut back to 200,000 bpd.   Quito indicates
 that it expects higher prices in the future.
 Sudan:   The trial of the Black September terror-
 ists charged with murdering two US diplomats in March
 x__973 is expected to begin in Khartoum early next
 month.   The Sudanese minister of interior informed the
 IS embassy this week that pre-trial preparations are
 tearly complete and that he does not anticipate a
 [urther delay.   A public announcement, however, is
 unlikely until after May 25, the fifth anniversary
 ?)f the coup that brought President Numayri to power.
