 The Honorable George Murphy, Director
 A Tree at Panmunjom
 Some observations on the sinister circumstances bearing on the axe-
 murder In August of our two American officers on the Korean truce line,
 and its larger meaning for Americans who may have forgotten why we
 are_stillthere.
 by James Angleton and C.J.V. Murphy
 Mr. Angleton spent 31 years with the Office of Strategic Serv-
 ices (OSS) and the Central Intelligence Agency, and through the
 last 20 years was Chief of Counterintelligence for the CIA. Mr.
 Murphy is a retired writer, Time-Life and Fortune magazine.
 In the whole sorry sequence of recent American failures to
 cope with communist challenges in Africa and Asia, no single
 event has given more serious cause for concern over the Govern-
 ment's capacity for effective action than its singularly evasive re-
 sponse to the axe-murder in midsummer of two young American
 Army officers by North Korean troops on the truce line at Pan-
 munjom.
 The offense itself was certainly plain enough in its elementary
 brutality. A mixed work party of South Korean and American of-
 ficers and men entered the so-called "Demilitarized Zone,"
 better known these past 23 years by its acronym, DMZ, on the
 innocent chore of pruning an intrinsically valueless poplar tree,
 the branches of which were conveniently obscuring the view of
 the communist line from a watchtower on the United Nations'
 side. For no apparent reason, other than to humiliate the United
 States Army, a larger body of North Korean soldiers fell upon
 the work force and bludgeoned the two officers to death with
 axes wrested from their own men. President Ford rightly
 charged the communists with having perpetrated "vicious and
 unprovoked murder" in an attack both "brutal and cowardly."
 But in their hasty settlement of accounts with the perpetrators of
 the outrage, the terms devised by him and Secretary of State
 Kissinger are likely to be celebrated in the history of our times
 much more for their ingenuity than for their moral character.
 Murderers Not Punished
 Instead of insisting that the murderers be punished, the com-
 mand decision was to punish the tree itself. The mute, unoffend-
 ing poplar that had offered welcome shade to travellers on the
 old road that runs from Kaesong to Seoul was struck down. It
 was annihilated, root and branch.
 It's a long way, as human experience is measured, from the
 Garden of Eden to the rude compound of Quonset huts and
 wooden shacks that forAWth! * E  l R Ie ,Se 2WIU'IOl}28
 our highly placed public servants in Washington conducted
 themselves in the test of character raised by the grisly incident
 under the poplar is an uncomfortable reminder that ordinary
 men are still far from ever achieving the state of eternal grace
 that Adam lost for us in an earlier arboreal incident.
 Adam, we know, failed a test of character under a fruit tree in
 the Garden of Eden. In their own hour of testing under, the pop-
 lar at Panmunjom, the relatively small but extremely influential
 body of politicians, scholars, lawyers, executives, bureaucrats
 and technipols* inside the National Security Council who as the
 Washington Special Action Group advise the President in crisis
 situations showed themselves, under circumstances far less se-
 ductive, to be no nobler than the unfortunate Adam. Instead of
 grappling with evil, they feasted on the drugged fruit of detente.
 They took out their frustrations on the poplar, rather than exact
 satisfaction and respect from a bold enemy.
 O! Woodman, Do Not Spare that Tree
 In the humiliating aftermath, the rest of us Americans would
 do well to reflect long and hard on the implications attaching to
 that challenge at far-off Panmunjom. There's a saying that
 people are sometimes unable to see the forest for the trees.
 What that gentle aphorism argues is that some of us can usually
 be depended upon to lose sight of a main issue because we let
 ourselves be diverted by the minor pieces. But in the confusion
 and doubt that now prevail in the American attitude toward our
 responsibilities, risks and true interests abroad, a thoughtful as-
 sessment of the circumstances that brought on that bloody
 swirl of aggression at Panmunjom may give us a clearer compre-
 hension of the forest of trouble and vexation that meets our gaze
 in Pacific Asia, on the horn of Africa, in the Indian Ocean and on
 the approaches to the Persian Gulf. Understanding what hap-
 pened over the tree may, in other words, enable us better to
 judge what's going on in the forest itself.
 How mixed up we really are is indicated by a poll of American
 opinions on current defense and foreign policy matters taken
 *Technicians, such as political, physical and social scientists, who con-
 duct themselves as politicians, thereby achieving more influence and a

 ton, D.C. The results were published in Foreign Policy, another
 liberal quarterly, also based in the capital. They show that most
 Americans no longer expect much to be gainei by our seeking
 closer relations with the Soviet Union and so ha""e lost confidence
 in the magic of detente. Most Americans are also dubious about
 the wisdom of wasting too much effort on trying to improve our
 relations with communist China. Instead, they favor staying
 close to our present allies, seeing to it that American rights are
 treated with "respect" by other nations, and (rating 81 on a
 scale of 100) "keeping our military and defense forces strong."
 More than half-52 percent, in fact-believe that we should set
 about becoming "the world's most powerful nation." The be-
 wildering aspect of these findings is that strong as was the feel-
 ing about the necessity for a powerful defense establishment. as
 an issue of urgent concern it was rated behiid ten other na-
 tional problems, all of a domestic nature, all Af a materialistic
 interest.
 Still, this peculiar anomaly in the American scale of values is
 not really as baffling as at first it may seem. Most of us find it all
 but impossible to make much sense of the arithmetic that goes
 into those awesome tables citing the ranges, the throwweights,
 the number of MIRVs associated with the strategic missile
 systems now drawn up on the two sides. Even more incompre-
 hensible are the esoteric factors which will eventually determine
 the relative weights which the emerging Soviet supersonic Back-
 fire, the American Cruise Missile, the controversial B-1 bomber
 and the huge and costly Trident submarine will each in its turn
 contribute to one side or the other of the military balance. These
 are all immensely complicated weapon systems that operate in
 the ocean deeps, or in upper space, or are based far back in the
 hinterlands, and so are but rarely seen by the populaces they are
 meant to defend.
 Because so much of the new military technolcgies are over our
 heads, Secretary Kissinger can count on applause and cheers
 when he assures the rest of us, as he did in Phoenix in April,
 that we have no cause to "delude ourselves with fairy tales of
 America being second best." And that same nonth at Bossier
 City, in Louisiana, President Ford could promise, as indeed he
 did, that "as long as I hold this honored office :. intend to see to
 it that the United States will never become second to anybody.
 Period. "
 That was officeseeking rhetoric. The President could not in
 truth supply a truly resounding, a wholly con""incing period to
 his pledge. How far the balance has tilted against us, and in pre-
 cisely which decisive elements of power, are matters that hover
 obscurely in the many imponderables affecting the weaponry
 and politics involved in the SALT process, beyand question the
 most confusing of all the urgent matters before us. The weapons
 being bargained over in the murky diplomacy of the Strategic
 Arms Limitation Talks have never been tried in war. No one
 really knows how precisely they can be controlled in a battle situ-
 ation, or how they can best be foiled or countered. And at this
 stage our planners can only hypothesize just ho.v our communist
 enemies intend to fit their ever-enlarging pan 3ply of mass de-
 The manner in which our communist adversaries conduct them-
 selves toward us at various pressure points around the globe
 provides a set of measures for judging their intentions toward
 us and, even more, their confidence in being able to bring off
 whatever enterprise they may have in the making. That is a
 good reason for taking a close look at what happened at Pan-
 munjom. That tree may tell us something important about the
 forest.
 How President Eisenhower Stabilized the Line
 We had best begin by refreshing our knowledge of how the
 truce line came to be fixed in the first place. When General
 Eisenhower entered the White House in January 1953, a pro-
 visional truce had been in force on the Korean battlefield for a
 year and a half. The armies faced each other across a zigzag line
 that ran across the waist of Korea a bit north, for the most part,
 of the 38th Parallel, the original partition boundary. In the
 Truman years, the war, which that decent man had carelessly
 described as "a police action," had cost 31,000 American dead,
 91,000 wounded and some 13,000 missing who proved to be
 mostly dead. Throughout the exhausting haggle of the truce, the
 North Koreans and the far stronger Red Chinese forces in the
 line never stopped trying to improve their positions and to wear
 down American will. They did this by staging an interminable
 series of fierce local clashes that did not materially affect the
 main dispositions but did have the useful political effect of pre-
 senting the American people with an ever lenthening list of
 casualties.
 Eisenhower's decision was the sensible one of a soldier turned
 President. It was to force the communist powers-the North
 Koreans, along with their Soviet and Chinese patrons-to bow
 to a formal armistice forthwith or face a dramatic enlargement of
 the war. He sent a fairly explicit warning through the Indian
 Government and various other channels that unless the fighting
 was stopped, he was prepared to break open the "sanctuary""
 in Mane uria from which the communist powers had supplied
 their field forces and to carry the war to whatever ports, air
 bases, railway systems and industrial areas in China and Man-
 churia that were supporting the communist armies. He warned,
 too, that the United States would no longer be self-constrained
 in having resort to tactical nuclear weapons, if that was a
 quick way to end the war. And to show that the threat was not a
 hollow one, he ordered two first-class Army divisions in Japan
 and a Marine division in reserve to be prepared for rapid deploy-
 ment in Korea. A nuclear bomb wing was moved into the
 western Pacific.
 That was the last clear-cut decision by an American president
 in  a make-or-break political-military  situation.  Kennedy's
 blockade of Cuba in 1962 after the Soviet missiles were dis-
 covered there was not of the same soul-trying order of magni-
 tude. Only a relative handful of Soviet troops had been risked
 in Cuba. The missiles themselves were not even operational.
 Eisenhower's decision, had he been obliged to execute it, would
 have put the United States in head-on collision with the Soviet
 Union and Red China, then locked together in fraternal alliance.

 tain the independence of South Korea. Then, as the North
 Koreans were reeling back to the Yalu River in defeat at the on-
 set of the first winter, he persuaded Chairman Mao Tse-tung to
 launch the Red army south from Manchuria, with the object of
 turning the tide of battle and driving the United States from the
 rim of Asia. Then, at the start of the second summer, in June
 1951, with the Chinese in their turn falling back in defeat to the
 old UN line, the Russians deftly re-entered the situation and
 rescued the Chinese armies by engineering a cease-fire that
 allowed them to hold where they stood. And, finally, as the
 fourth summer wore on, with Stalin now dead, a formidable
 soldier strategist in the White House and the American mili-
 tary buildup in full swing, the Russians and the Chinese con-
 cluded they had not only lost the war but also any hope of re-
 trieving the loss by undermining the American will to persevere.
 On July 27, 1953, six months after Eisenhower took office, the
 Armistice was signed at Panmunjom. It established a No Man's
 zone two and a half miles wide and 151 miles long that extends
 from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan, ascending bitter moun-
 tains and coasting down steep and narrow valleys. The hope-a
 forlorn one, at best-was that eventually the dividing barrier of
 barbed wire would be dismantled and the Koreans on both sides
 would themselves reunite in independence under the UN's
 sheltering hand. Today, some 23 years later, a force of 41,000
 Americans is still there, standing watch with a South Korean
 Army of 560,000. Facing them is the communist Marshal Kim 11
 Sung's first-class Army of at least 410,000 men, bountifully sup-
 ported by Soviet-supplied air, artillery and tanks. The line at
 Panmunjom remains the most sensitive flashpoint of all the
 geography where United States and communist interests in-
 tersect.
 Provocations Part of Soviet Strategy
 It remains only because it serves the long-range strategy of
 Soviet-bloc policy to keep it so. The murder of the two officers is
 but the last of a continuing series of ambushes, bombings, snip-
 ings and assaults that have taken 49 American lives since the
 Armistice supposedly began. Add the casualties inflicted by the
 Koreans on each other, and the dead number more than 1,000.
 Eight years ago, six American soldiers were slain in an ambush
 near Panmunjom and last year an American major was all but
 beaten to death by North Korean guards at the truce site itself.
 The August incident was of a piece with these provocations. A
 squad of 11 American and South Korean officers and men ac-
 companied five South Korean tree-pruners to the poplar. As
 they made ready to proceed with the branch cutting, a group of
 North Korean guards came up and ordered them to desist. When
 the Americans stood their ground, a truck load of North Korean
 soldiers bore down upon them, and one of the officers was
 heard to shout an order to "kill." At the end of the melee, only
 minutes later, Captain Arthur G. Bonifas and Lieutenant Mark
 T. Barrett lay dead, their heads crushed by the blunt heads of
 the axes wrested from their workmen.

 cautiously and unprovocatively inside the South Korean frontier.
 They also called for sending another and bigger party of work-
 men back to the poplar with orders not just to prune it but to cut
 it down. The tree was felled, expeditiously, with power saws.
 The North Koreans did not interfere this time. There was
 hardly reason for them to do so. They had already made their
 point. All that President-Marshal Kim II Sung felt called upon to
 do by way of amends was to toss off a note which termed the
 first incident "regretful" but artfully implied that the Americans
 had brought it on themselves. The note was gingerly received
 by Dr. Kissinger who first deemed it "unsatisfactory" only to

 dential speechwriters for use against Governor CarterInto -thee
 opposite conclusion a day later that American honor had some-
 how been requited, in ways perceptible only to himself and,
 perhaps, President Ford.
 United States a "Paper Tiger"
 What was the point that President Kim Il Sung had made? It
 stands to reason that when his soldiers sallied forth to repel the
 tree-pruners, he was not seeking a casus bells. A big war with
 the United States is the last thing either the Soviet Union or
 communist China wants at this point in time. But neither was
 the attack the "looney" and "unpremeditated" action which
 some apologists such as the CBS man Kalb would have us be-
 lieve. The point that the North Koreans were out to make under
 the poplar was the same one they seek to drive home whenever
 they goad, harrass, or waylay an American patrol. It is the one
 that was in their minds eight years ago when they crippled and
 boarded the Pueblo in international waters. Their point is to
 demonstrate to our allies and third-world countries that the
 United States is losing the moral fortitude for struggle. It can be
 chivvied into slipping out from under its world commitments. It
 is becoming the "paper tiger" that Mao Tse-tung once said it
 was, a judgment reinforced at his own bier by the kow-towing
 not only by the President but also by a cortege led by a -former
 Secretary of Defense who was fired by the President himself.
 There is no mystery about the long-term objectives which Kim
 Il Sung shares with his Moscow suppliers and with his fellow
 Asians and war comrades in Peking. It is to finish the task of
 driving the United States off its last remaining stronghold on the
 Asian mainland that was begun under Soviet-Chinese auspices
 16 years ago.
 Three years ago, the negotiations that were proclaimed to
 produce the "peaceful reunification" of the Korean peninsula
 broke down. Since then the North Koreans have concentrated on
 further enlarging their already huge military establishments.
 The Russians have supplied them with more tanks and air-
 craft than we have given the South Koreans. They have added
 greatly to the many artillery battalions deployed behind the
 truce zone. The Russians have further strengthened them with

 The Difficult Question of Self-Interest
 Why are we Americans still in that distant, dangerous place?
 Communist propaganda and our liberal-left jcurnalism would
 have the rest of the world believe-and unfortunately, too many
 Americans as well-that it is only to maintain the less-than-
 democratic regime of President Park Chung Heo and to cling to
 the remnants of imperialism. In truth, we remain in Korea be-
 cause of the acute vulnerability of an unarm,:d, still largely
 pacifist Japan, now recently awakened by two events to the need
 for applying its own mind to its peril: The shattering revelations
 leaked by Senator Church, defeated in his own ambitions, and
 by the stalwart Soviet pilot, who sought sanctuary and freedom
 in a democratic Japan exposed to predatory communism, We
 fought there in 1950 primarily to keep that talented and in-
 dustrious society from passing in its helplessness under the
 hegemony of either communist China or the Soviet Union.
 The pity is that too few among us remember that it is the
 promise to protect a Japan which we defeated and disarmed
 three decades ago that binds us to the defense of South Korea.
 A reality governs our presence there that the incalculably influ-
 ential organs of our journalism-the networks, The New York
 Times, the Washington Post, the liberal wee:tlies-have de-
 liberately ignored in their obsession with the alleged inequities
 of President Park. The attack which they have lately and simul-
 taneously mounted on him is almost identical in its rationale with
 the ones these same organs used to bring down :'resident Thieu
 in Vietnam and are now contriving for the downfall of the Shah
 of Iran. If we intend to maintain a working positian on the west-
 ern Pacific, the United States cannot back out of Korea merely
 because a mischief-making handful of liberal-leftist journalists
 do not like the way Park governs. A pull-out would leave Japan
 naked and the islands of the western Pacific-the Phillipines,
 Okinawa, eventually even Australia-as strategic counters to be
 swept up by the ascendant power.
 Self-Interest and Political Morality
 The hard lesson that we should have learned from the Ameri-
 can experience in the Cold War is that to draw a line in strategy
 and foreign policy which attempts to take in bcth self-interest
 and political morality can't help but be tortuous and a slithering
 exercise. As The Economist of London pointed out in a char-
 acteristically well-reasoned leader in its issue o! 28 August. if
 self-interest is now to govern American strategy Israel would

 terest or morality, let alone wisdom, to be found in an African
 policy that is prepared to sacrifice the material and political
 rights of white minorities in Africa to blacks after the squalid
 events in Uganda, Kenya and Angola have shown that black
 majorities, once in power, sweep minorities, including Indians,
 aside?
 And, finally, do their people really have sound legal grounds
 for their pitiless attack on the Park government? Seoul, Korea is
 in a state of war. It is surrounded North and West by enemies.
 To suspend a few rights, as it has done, is not unnatural for
 democratic societies in similar peril. In fact, Israel has done so
 because it, too, is in peril. In fact, given the pathetic American
 performance at Panmunjom, we could wish that our leaders had
 drawn upon the same moral design that inspired Prime Minister
 Rabin to redeem Israel honor at Entebbe.
 A House of Many Mansions
 Equal with the oil, natural resources, and the political ele-
 ments are the intangibles-the worth of stout-minded and inde-
 pendent societies ready to help Americans and their allies hold a
 crucial line; friends who will stand alongside us in defense of the
 vital moral interest, in the real world the only sensible system of
 alliance is one that is itself a house of many mansions. That was
 what the containment policy started out to be.
 Everywhere the lines are shortening. The weakness of the
 United States is essentially an inner one. Americans of the lib-
 eral left, especially in politics and journalism, are more passion-
 ately devoted to confounding the American public than in fac-
 ing up to the communist threat. For them, the real enemy in
 Korea is our ally, a stubborn President Park who must be re-
 sponsive to the perils of his nation. In their view, executing the
 tree at Panmunjom was a safe way out of a bad situation in
 which no one in authority wanted to consult our immediate self-
 interest, let alone our moral responsibility to the tenets of the
 nation.
 We have a proposal for honoring the trophies from that in-
 glorious action. If it has not been done already, let the logs of
 the poplar be flown in Air Force One back home and racked
 alongside the fireplace in the Secretary of State's Reception
 Room at Foggy Bottom. There, when he delights himself in
 tete-a-tete confidences with envoys from the other camp, the
 men of detente can warm their hands, if not their souls, over
 the dying embers of what only 23 years ago was the American
 and Korean sacrifice for Panmunjom.
