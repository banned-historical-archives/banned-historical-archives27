 t'T IY COMMIES COACH TEIE COLLEGE REBELS
 Iia st of them have been out there pitching
 a.rwind the college campuses.  As FBI Direc-
 tor I loover tells it: "The unvarnished truth
 is t:t at the Communist conspiracy is seizing
 this insurrectionary climate (on, some col-
 lege campuses) to captivate the thinking of
 rebellious-minded youth and coax them into
 the Communist movement itself or at least
 agitate them Into serving the Communist
 cause."
 Co the new left will be back picketing
 around the White House tomorrow, or next
 week, many of the marchers perhaps un-
 mindful of the potential danger to the coun-
 try packed into the mouthings of the old
 faces in the near background.
 Some demonstrators not yet thoroughly
 hooked might find it profitable to think over
 I;he closing lines in the memoirs of retired
 Gen. Curtis LeMay, the old bomber man.
 [Is had a parting thought for a younger
 generation:
 "T hope that the United States of America
 has not yet passed the peak of honor and
 beauty and that our people can still sustain
 certain simple philosophies at which some
 miserable souls feel it incumbent to sneer.
 I refer to some of the Psalms and to the
 Gettysburg Address and the Scout oath.  I
 refer to the Lord's Prayer and to that other
 oath, which a man must take when he stands
 with hand uplifted and swears that he will
 defend his country."
 The soul can get pretty miserable walking
 the sidewalk in front of the White House on
 a day like this.

 MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR
 t By John Edgar Hoover, Director)
 '['ht'          American  college  student  today is
 being subjected to a bewildering and danger-
 ous                                       ronspiracy perhaps   unlike  any  social
 challenge ever before encountered by               our
 youth.  On many campuses he faces a tur-
 bulence built on unrestrained individualism,
 rcpul:;ive         dress  and speech,  outright    ob-
 scenity,                                          disdain  for  moral   and   spiritual
 values, and disrespect for law and order.

 "new left   is complex in its deceitful ab-
 surdity                                 and  characterized  by         its        lack  of
 common:,anse.
 Fortunately, a high percentage of the more
 than 3 million full-time college students are
 dedicated, hardworking. and serious-minded
 young people; however, their good deeds and     is nothing to be sneezed at.  Too bad
 achievements are greatly overshadowed by        then that it is a mirage, a myth, a fig-

 talking but very little thinking.               will.
 Much of this turmoil has been connected         Mr. Speaker, according to the Depart-
 with a feigned concern for the vital rights of
 free speech, dissent, and petition.  Hard-care  ment of  Commerce,  our             1.965  imports
 fanatics have used these basic rights of our    came to $21.36 billion, compared with ex-
 deemocratic society to distort the issues and                                       ports of $26.56 billion.  These are pretty
 betray  the public.   However,  millions of     figures  to  contemplate.   Unfortunately
 Americans, who know from experience that        for our inclination to complacency, our
 freedom and rights also mean duties and re-     imports were not $21.36 billion but more
 sponst5il1ties, are becoming alarmed over the   nearly   $25   billion.   The discrepancy
 anarebistie  and  seditious  ring    of  these  comes from the way the Treasury De-
 eampus disturbances.                                  They know liberty and
 Justice are not possible without law and        paritnent and the Department of Com-

 The Communist Party, U.S.A., as well as         'T'hey base them on foreign value, as if
 other subversive groups, is jubilant Over these it cost nothing to bring the goods to our

 ing the Communist cause-  This is being ae-
 compli:hed primarily by a two-pronged of-                                          table 844.
 Pensive--a much-publicized  college speak-      Several months ago I inserted in the
 in g, prr,!;ram and the campus-oriented Conl-   RECORD a calculation provided by O. R.
 Strackbein, chairman of the Nationwide
 Committee on Import-Export Policy, in
 which he estimated the average global
 burden of freight and insurance on our
 total imports.  His estimate, based on
 our trade with England and Japan, was
 17%2 percent for our trade with the world
 as a whole.  I have no reason for ques-
 tioning Mr. Strackbein's estimate.  It
 was well documented.
 Virtually all other countries record
 their imports on a c.i.f. basis, which in-
 cludes not only the cost but also insur-
 ance and freight charges incurred in
 bringing the goods from the foreign
 port to the port of entry.  This AS what
 we should do as a basis for reporting
 our imports.  Because of the method we
 follow our imports are undervalued by
 the amount of the shipping charges, in-
 eluding insurance.
 That is why it creates the wrong im-
 pression to report that our 1965 imports
 were only $21.36 billion when it cost some
 $3.7 billion more to bring the goods to
 our ports of entry.  We swell our breasts
 with pride over our ability to compete
 with other countries. Well, at this point
 we should release $3.7 billion of this air
 from our lungs and bring in our chest
 by that much.
 On the export side, in order to feel
 good and in order to prove that the trade
 agreements program has been a huge
 success, we commit an equally unpardon-
 able sin-one of about the same propor-
 tions as the one just described.
 Our executive departments--not in-
 eluding Agricultural which should be
 given honorable mention for showing
 the volume of farm exports generated
 by Public Law 480 and Federal subsidies
 of wheat, cotton, and so forth--namely,
 Treasury and Commerce, have not been
 satisfied to show our private commercial
 exports, free of vast subsidies, but in-
 clude giveaways, sales for foreign in-
 edible currencies and seemingly what-
 ever else they can lay their hands on.
 They do leave military shipments out
 of total exports, but that is about the
 only place where they draw the line.
 Mr. Speaker, I do not know how large
 the 19,65 exports were under Public Law
 480, AID, and so forth, but in 1964 the
 combined  exports  generated in this
 fashion plus those called commercial-
 because they were sold through private
 channels but were subsidized-amounted
 to $3.7 billion.  The outstanding ones
 among., the so-called commercial sales
 were wheat, wheat flour, and cotton.
 Our disposal of these products did noth-
 ing to prove our competitive capacity.
 Quite the contrary.  Without the subsi-
 dies we could not have met the world
 price and could only have sold at cut
 prices, if at all.
 It is safe to say that the 1965 exports
 under .AID, Public Law 480, and so north,
 were at least equal to the $3.7 billion
 of 1964.
 Add this to the $3.7 billion by which
 we undervalued our imports in 1965 and
 we reach a total of $7.4 billion. This is
 a respectable distortion.
 Reduce our reported experts of $:16.56
 billion by $3.7 billion and the figure drops
 to $22.9 billion.  This operation might
 be called trimming away the blubber
 and streamlining our figures.  Compare

 monist W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America.
 Therefore,  the  Communist  influencer
 nfluence  Is
 cleverly injected into civil disobedience and
 reprisals against our economic, political, and
 social system.
 There are those who scoff at the signifi-
 cance of these student flareups, but let us
 make no mistake: the Communist Party does
 not consider them insignificant,  The partic-
 ipants of the new left are part of the 100,000
 "state  of  rnind"  members Gus  Hall,  the
 party's general secretary, refers to when he
 talks of party strength. He recently stated
 the party is experiencing the: greatest upsurge
 In its history with a "one to two thousand"
 increase in membership in the last year.
 For the first time since 1959, the party
 plans a national convention this spring.  We
 can be sure that high on the agenda will be
 strategy and plans to win the new left and
 other new members.  A Communist student,
 writing in an official party organ, recently
 stated, "There is no question but that the
 new left will be won."
 'T'hus,  the  Communists'  intentions  are
 abundantly  clear.  We hove  already  seen
 the  effects of  some of  their stepped-up
 activities, and I firmly believe a, vast majority
 of the American public    is disgusted and
 sickened by such social orgies. One recourse
 is to support and encourage the million of
 youth who refuse to swallow the Communist
 bait.  Another is to let it be known far and
 wide that we do not intend to stand idly
 by and let demagogs make a mockery of our
 laws and demolish the foundation of our
 Republic.
 EXPORT SURPLUS A $7 BILLION
 MIRAGE
 (Mr. DENT  (at the request of Mr.

 ter.)
 Mr. DENT,  Mr.' Speaker, the Depart-
 ment of Commerce recently issued a re-
 port on our balance of trade for 1965.
 According to that report this country
 ran up an export surplus of $5.2 billion
 last year.
 This was a decline of $1.5 billion from
 the surplus reported for 1964, which was
 given as $6.7 billion.  The setback came
 from an import increase of 14 percent in
 1965 over 1964: while exports rose only
 4 percent.

 The Job Corps in Idaho
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. COMPTON I. WHITE, JR.
 OF IDAHO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. WHITE of Idaho.  Mr, Speaker,
 the Job Corps program in Idaho has re-
 cently become a subject of national In-
 terest.                      To assure that the membership
 is kept fully informed on current devel-
 opments,  I offer for publication in
 the RECORD the following three news-
 paper articles:
 [From the Owyhee (Idaho) Nugget,
 Feb. 10, 1966]
 MARSING  JOB      CORPSMEN  GRADUATE  FROM
 CENTER
 Two corpsmen, Roland Bland and Jeffery
 Bolden, Jr., received certificates of comple-
 tion February 7, 1966 at the Marsing Job
 Corps Conservation Center.
 ROLAND BLAND
 Roland Bland, 17, is from Petersburg, Va.
 and was transferred to the Marsing Center
 from Curlew Job Corps Conservation Center,
 Curlew,  Wash.,  on  October  25,  1965.  He
 originally entered the Job Corps program
 June 10, 1965.   Roland was promoted to as-
 sistant corpsman leader while at Curlew and
 was promoted to corpsman leader when he
 arrived at Marsing. He was sent to our cen-
 ter to assist us by providing corpsman lead-
 ership at our initial stages.
 While at Marsing he was assigned duties
 of teacher's aid and as work leader.  He per-
 formed these duties in an excellent manner.
 He previously completed the education pro-
 gram while at Curlew Job Corps Conservation
 Center.  Roland was transferred to Kilmer
 Job  Corps  Urban  Center  in Edison,  N.J.,
 to further  his  training  in  his   desired
 trade skills of machinist and welding.
 This Urban Center has a maximum enroll-
 ment of 2,500 corpsmen and Roland will be
 able to stay up to a maximum of 2 years at
 this center starting from the time he entered
 the Job Corps in June 1965
 JEFFERY GOLDEN
 Jeffery Bolden, Jr., 20, is from Mount Ver-
 non, Ala., and came to this center November
 23, 1965.  Jeffery excelled in the education
 and work program and progressed rapidly.
 He advanced from the Job Corps fourth level
 to the ninth level In approximately 3 months
 and has completed the basic education pro-
 gram.  He also has learned and practiced
 basic work attitudes and skills.
 His qualifications were discussed with the
 employment service at his hometown and
 they stated that with his basic knowledge,
 work habits and attitudes, he can have a
 choice of several jobs at the present time.
 Because he has completed the basic educa-
 tion-work program and has been assured of
 job placement, he has fulfilled the purpose of
 the Job Corps program and was graduated to
 become a taxpayer.
 [From the  Owyhee  (Idaho)  Nugget,  Feb.
 10, 1966]
 MARSING JOB CORPS CENTER To EXPAND TO 168
 CORPSMEN
 Enrollees at the Marsing Job Corps Con-
 servation  Center will                                                                                     be  increased  by 56
 corpsmen by June 15, from the 112 now at
 the Center, reported Daniel Weir, regional
 Job Corps coordinator, Bureau of Reclama-
 tion, and Cleve S. Bolingbroke, Center direc-
 tor.  This will make a total of 168 corpsmen,
 and the staff will be  increased from the
 present 31 to 47.
 "By expanding the Center," the men said,
 "it will mean a far better vocational training
 program in automotive maintenance, heavy
 equipment  operation,  concrete  and  brick
 work, carpentry, welding,  and many more
 vocational trades.  More and better equip-
 ment will be brought to the site.
 Over $150,000 will be spent at the Center
 between now and June 15 for expanded fa-
 cilities which will include  a new 58-man
 dormitory, a 1,000-square-foot dispensary, a
 new gym 90 by 96 feet, and a new shop
 building.
 Plans are being formulated to develop the
 corpsmen's social abilities and help them
 find a better place in society.
 Wednesday morning Mr. Weir, Mr. Boling-
 broke, E. R. Indreland, deputy director of
 the Marsing Job Corps works program, met
 with Marsing Mayor Dave Haken, and Harold
 Curt, president of the Marsing Rod and Gun
 Club, to discuss plans on beautifying the
 Marsing Island Park.  The Center plans to
 spend several thousand dollars on the island
 project, which should make a beautiful place
 for all to enjoy.
 [From the Cottonwood (Idaho) Chronicle,
 Feb. 10, 1966]
 The need for better communication be-
 tween citizens of Cottonwood and the sur-
 rounding communities and the Job Corps
 Conservation Center  at  Cottonwood  has
 been recognized since the opening of the
 camp and the arrival of the corpsmen at the
 Center.
 In November, a group of public-spirited
 citizens of Cottonwood from social-action
 groups and churches met with the staff at
 the Center and established a coordinating
 council.  This  council has now become a
 point of contact between the town and the
 camps.
 On February 1 the group met for the first
 time in the new year, to continue discus-

 other  organizations of the community in
 the work at the Job Corps Center, and es-
 pecially to devise methods for establishing
 more points  of  contact between  the two
 groups.
 It was felt that one of the important
 ways in which men and women of Cotton-
 wood could observe the educational facili-
 ties and the accomplishments of the Job
 Corps conservation crews was by actual visits
 to the camp.  During these visits, the staff
 and  various  counselors and    instructors
 could  answer questions  and  explain   the
 educational and vocational facilities  open
 to  the  corpsmen.  The  boys,  themselves,
 would be available for answering questions
 about their life at the Center and in the
 forest "spike camps" to which they go vol-
 untarily for ranger training and experience.
 Another effective form of communication,
 it was felt, would be having some of the
 young men attend  open meetings of the
 social-action groups in Cottonwood to ob-
 serve                                                                                                                                          how  these  function-especially  how
 various community projects are proposed,
 carried  out, completed,  or  tabled.  They
 also hope some of the women's organiza-
 tions might participate, so a broader under-
 standing of the aims and objectives of the
 program of the Job Corps might lessen the
 communication gap between the town and
 the Center.
 Attending the meeting were Len Kuther,
 chairman;  Cletus Uhlorn for the business
 community, Bud Walkup and Ladd Arnoti;
 Center Director Robert R. Lusk, Margaret
 Raymond, VISTA Volunteer;  Sam Jordan,
 and Otto H. Ost.
 An Important Warning for the Future
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS

 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 16, 1966
 Mr. MULTER.                                                                                                             Mr. Speaker, Samuel
 F. Pryor has just returned from a tour
 of all of our bases in southeast Asia and
 has made some very important observa-
 tions which should serve as a warning
 for the future.
 Some of his conclusions are given in
 the following column by Ruth Mont-
 gomery which appeared in the New York
 Journal American of February 11, 1966:
 CAPITAL LETTER: WHAT IF RED CHINA HAD
 OUR MUSCLE?
 (By Ruth Montgomery)
 WASHINGTON.-A  nongovernmental avia-
 tion expert who directed the development of
 50 overseas military airfields during World
 War II has just returned from a compre-
 hensive tour of all U.S. bases in southeast
 Asia. His  conclusion:  President  Johnson
 has been right every step of the way in his
 Vietnam policy.
 Samuel F. Pryor, longtime  executive  of
 Pan American World Airways, made the trip
 in company with our Air Force Pacific Com-
 mander In Chief, Gen. Hunter Harris, Jr.
 Having convinced himself of the rightness
 of our policy-both the lull and the resumed
 bombing-Pryor reserves his scorn for those
 who say that America should pull out of the
 area. He has this word of warning for the
 doves, and for the fence-sitting nations of the
 world :
 "Add together our guided missile program,
 our ICBM's and nuclear capacity, our Air
 Force,  Polaris  submarines,  Navy,  Marines,
 artillery and Army, and you have the great-
 est military strength In the history of man-
 kind.                                                                                                                                            Couple this with our productive ca-
 pacity, which is half of the entire world's,

 and imagine what would happen if the Red
 Chinese possessed this strength.
 "They'd be in MoVow and Paris, Africa
 and South America right now, and half of
 our American cities would be bombed out.
 Let's face facts.  Do we want this to hap-
 pen to our children, or do we want to stop
 the Red Chinese now?  Do we want them
 to overrun southeast Asia and Thailand, and
 then  pick  off  sparsely settled  Australia?
 That's our choice."
 Pryor visited every U.S. base in South Viet-
 nam, Taiwan, and Okinawa, plus all the "mil-
 it.ixy assistance" places in Thailand.  From
 long  experience  lie  says  that  no war is
 kind, but that we are "fighting a kind war
 in Vietnam."  He explains that during the
 recent bombing lclll, the Presdent was in
 effect saying to the Vietcong: "Now you see
 what's happening.      Please stop. We don't
 want to hurt you."
 When the Reds refused to listen to the
 voice of reason, Pryor thinks the President
 had "no alternative but to give them another
 taste of our strength." He also assures the
 hawks that the lull was by no means wasted
 on our side.
 We were using that period, he says, to
 build up "tremendous strength," and through
 intelligence and flyovers to gage the cap-
 ability  of  the  enemy  in  rebuilding  its
 bombed-out bridges and supply roads.
 As a narcotics expert, Pryor looked into
 its  smuggling problem during the Asian
 tour. The contraband drugs are moving out
 of Red China into the black markets of the
 world, and Pryor says: "Heroin is the stuff
 you would only want your enemies to use.
 Iced China has a strict ban on its use by its
 own people, but it is moving out for sale
 .n the free world."
 Pryor, despite his conviction that the Pres-
 ident is right in stepping up the pace of
 the war, is anything  but a saber rattler.
 Returning here only long enough to make
 a private report to the Bureau of Narcotics,
 he is now off to the Holy Land in company
 with Bishop Walter Gray of the Connecticut
 liipiscopal diocese.
 "We will visit every spot in Jordan and
 Israel that was trod by the Prince of Peace,"
 he says.  Pryor and the bishop even have
 rare permission to pass both ways through
 the Mandelbaum Gate which separates the
 two warring nations.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. LESTER L. WOLFF
 OL' NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday. February 16, 1966
 Mr. WOLFF.  Mr. Speaker, the Mer-
 chant Marine Academy at Kings Point,
 N.Y., which is located in the congres-
 sional district I have the honor to repre-
 sent in this distinguished body, has been
 a steady source of stalwart men of the
 sea.  That the Academy produces men is
 evidenced by the fact that three Kings
 Point alumni have been cited for bravery
 and outstanding service in Vietnam.  I
 would like at this point to include in the
 RECORD a newspaper story about the most
 recent  Kings  Point  graduate,   Navy
 Comdr. Alexander C. Kuegler, Jr., and
 his service to our Nation:
 THIRD KINGS POINT GRAD CITED AS
 VIETNAM HERO
 Navy Colndr. Alexander C. Kuegler, Jr_, of
 Sea Cliff is the latest of three graduate.' of
 the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings
 Point to be cited for outstanding service in
 Vietnam.
 Kuegler was recently awarded the Viet-
 namese Medial of Honor and the Navy Com-
 mendation Medal for bravery under gun Lire
 while  U.S.  military  adviser  to  the  Com-
 mander, River Force.
 CLASSMATES IN 1944
 Previously, Lt. Comdr. Harvey E. Rod:ers,
 of Smithtown, was awarded the Vietnamese
 Medal for Gallantry for his part in sinking a
 Vietcong armored vessel in Vung Ro Bay md
 Comdr. Paul C. Ewing, of McLean, Va., re-
 ceived the Navy Commendation Medal for
 establishing and operating a complex mari-
 time advisory program.
 Kuegler,  a  member  with Ewing of the
 class of 194:4, was cited for his service be-
 tween July 4, 1963, and July 4, 1964, which
 "provided advisory assistance which proved
 combat  readiness  of Vietnamese  Navy  in
 support  of  counterinsurgency    of ellort
 against Vietcong."
 Water Pollution in Michigan-A Way to
 Its Solution
 Michigan, like all other States, has been a
 bit like the farmer who was approached by
 the county agent and offered new advice on
 the latest and best ways to farm.  The farm-
 er replied, "Thank you very much for your
 help, but I am not farming right now as
 well as I know how."  I say this with due
 deference to Mr. Loring F. Deming, the execu-
 tive secretary, and to the other members of
 our Michigan Water Resources Commission
 who over the years have done one of the best
 jobs in the United States of managing water
 resources.
 I can well recall that for a long time I used
 to receive a visit during- just about every
 Congress from either Milt Adams, former ex-
 ecutive secretary of the Michigan Water Re-
 sources Commission, or from our able assist-
 ant attorney general, Nick Olds, two of any
 very dear friends.  Both of these men are
 among the most able officials and public-
 interest oriented individuals anywhere, and
 I think that all three of us looked forward to
 these visits.  They initiated a regular tilt
 dealing with   legislation  sponsored by  me
 which each of these good gentlemen sin-
 cerely felt would put our State agencies out
 of business, a calamity desired by none of us.
 Our contacts started back in 1956 when
 Congressman Joarr BLATNIK first began the
 fight for meaningful water pollution control
 with the introduction of what was to become
 Public Law  660, the fundamental Federal
 water  pollution  :law.   This  was  enacted
 after the opposition of the States, some com-
 munities, and most industries, as well as the
 dedicated opposition of the Eisenhower ad-
 ministration, was overcome.                                                                                                                                            All of the op
 ponents of this legislation; industrial groups,
 State  agencies,  and  the      administration,
 stressed what to them were valid reasons for
 opposition.  Industry pleaded the problems
 of compliance and cost increase; State agen-
 cies feared that the proposed legislation im-
 pinged upon their treasured jurisdiction; and
 the Eisenhower administration argued that
 "water pollution was a uniquely local blight,"
 and of course worried that the legislation
 would provide $50 million a year to assist
 communities in construction of desperately
 needed sewage abatement works.
 Ultimately the differences with the State
 administrators were resolved by limiting the
 Federal activity to areas of pollution origi-
 nating in one State and affecting health, life,
 and welfare in other States.  The objections
 of the polluters and of the executive branch
 were simply battered aside, or compromises
 were made which resulted in garnering of a
 vote here or there, sufficient unto the need
 for passage of the legislation.
 To their great credit, the Michigan Water
 Resources Commission, and my old friend,
 Milt Adams, recognized the wisdom of that
 legislation and fought valiantly for it at the
 end.
 I saw my two beloved friends at the time
 I introduced a draft of the bill permitting
 communities to request the assistance of the
 Federal Government in the abatement of
 pollution   coming;  from  their    upstream
 neighbors.  This bill was changed to pro-
 vide that the Governor of the State could
 request the Public Health Service to com-
 mence                                                                                                                                  proceedings  for  the  abatement  of
 intrastate pollution. It then became :law
 and was supported by my two friends and
 Michigan's State agencies.  Parenthetically,
 it was this legislation which was utilized. to
 initiate  the  Federal  cleanup  now  taking
 place on the Detroit River at the request of
 former Governor Swainson.
 I was again visited by my two old friends
 when I introduced legislation to establish
 Federal standards for the abatement of pol-
 lution of interstate and navigable waters
 and to establish a. Federal agency to handle
 pollution of our waters.
 It has been a remarkable experience to me
 to  observe  the  continuing  opposition  of

 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 16, 1966
 Mr. BLATNIK.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 proud to commend to my colleagues the
 very excellent speech delivered by our
 good friend JOHN DINGELL at the Clean
 Water Conference of the Michigan State
 Association of Supervisors on the subject
 of water pollution:
 WATER POLLUTION IN MICHIGAN-A WAy  TO
 ITS SOLUTION
 (Address of Hon. JOHN D. DINGELL, Democrat,
 16th Congressional District of Michigan, to
 the Michigan State Association of Super-
 visors, on. January 18, 1966, at their Clean
 Water Conference in Lansing, Mich.)
 Nly dear friends, I want to express my
 graaitude to you for the privilege of being
 here today and for the opportunity of dis-
 cussing one of the most pressing resource
 problems of our day.  I want to commend
 both my valued friend, Ed Connor, one of
 our outstanding public officials, for his ex-
 pression of confidence in me, and the asso-
 ciation for its interest in this desperate p: ob-
 lem. of water pollution.
 The title assigned to me was, "Water Pollu-
 tion in Michigan."  I would like to take the
 liberty of adding to that title the word:-, "A
 Way to Its Solution."  Briefly that solution
 is Federal, State, and local cooperation, large
 expenditures of funds, and vigorous enforce-
 ment of our antipollution laws.
 Before I observe any of you going to steep,
 I want to make it very clear that it is not. my
 purpose to commence a doleful recitation of
 contamination of our State's once pristine
 waters.  Nor do I intend  to descend to a
 lugubrious recital of the effects of this con-
 lamination on health, welfare, and recrea-
 tional opportunities of our people.  Neither
 will I go into its devastating effects upon
 fish and wildlife and on the attracting of new
 industry to our State.
 Certain of my comments will necessarily
 touch on these matters but only as incidental
 to a calm discussion of our water problems.

 HON. EMILIO Q. DADDARIO
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, January 25, 1966
 Mr. DADDARIO.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 American Football Coaches Association
 recently installed Daniel Jessee to be its
 new president, the first Connecticut and
 small college coach to be given this honor,
 I have spoken earlier of the career which
 brought hind to this peak.  I was privi-
 leged to be present at a reception held
 by his fellow small college and high
 school coaches of Connecticut, and I in-
 sert an account of that fellowship and
 comradeship at the meeting which was
 held here in Washington to be added to
 the RECORD.
 This account is written by Bill Garrett
 of the Gannett News Bureau, and demon-
 strates the warm friendship which all in
 Connecticut feel for Dan Jessee:
 TRINITY'S MR. JESSEE GOES TO WASHINGTON
 (By William A. Garrett)
 WASHINGTON, D.C.-Every Nutmegger with
 a warm spot for football-from the Governor
 on down-told Dan Jessee last night how
 fortunate Trinity College and Connecticut
 were that he elected to go East rather than
 stay West years ago.
 The Trinity coach-formally Prof. Daniel
 Jessee-received the accolade on the eve of
 his installation as president of the American
 Football Coaches Association, at a reception
 put on by Connecticut college and high
 school coaches.
 This noon Jessee and some colleagues were
 to lunch  with President Johnson at  the
 White House.
 It was Gov. John N. Dempsey who pointed
 up in a citation presented to Jessee by Don
 Russell of Wesleyan the gooc: fortune that
 accrued to Connecticut when Jessee left the
 Pacifio coast, where he already had demon-
 strated his prowess as athlete and mentor.
 Looking on were scores of football's finest,
 from admiring State colleagues to national
 figures such as Syracuse's Ben Schwartz-
 walder, Penn State's Rip Engle, Otto Graham
 of Coast Guard, Army's Paul Dietzel and
 Eddie Enos of Montreal Loyola, a University
 of Connecticut product.
 Representative EMILIO Q. DADDARIO, Demo-
 crat of Hartford, a Little All-America back
 at Wesleyan, added to the applause.  Senator
 ABRAHAM  RiBrcoFF, Democrat of Hartford,
 had commended Jessee earlier.  Joe Fontana
 of  Southington,  who  chaired  the   event,
 lauded Jessee as one of sports' "most fierce
 competitors."
 Jessee will be AFCA's first Connecticut and
 small college president.  Dempsey cited the
 coach's record of 144 victories to 74 defeats
 and 7 ties, and his 4 perfect seasons.
 The Governor saluted Jessee as "a man
 wholly dedicated to the well-being and bet-
 terment  of  intercollegiate  sports."   Karl
 Kurth, Trinity line coach who is to succeed
 Ray Oosting as athletic director at the col-
 lege, introduced Costing at a brief ceremony.
 Jessee's wife, Charlotte, also was acclaimed
 for   her   contribution   to the coach's
 achievements.
 Weaver High's Edward T. Knurek presented
 matched luggage to Jessee. There also were
 comments    from  Trinity Dean Bob Vogel,
 Fred Tonzel, of New York, called the col-
 lege's most loyal fan, and George Ferris, its
 most loyal alumnus.
 Also there were Wesleyai 's Norm Daniels,
 Hugh McCurdy, its athletic director, and
 Waino Fallback, of Middletown High.  Jesse
 Dow represented southern Connecticut, and
 Bill Moore and Bill Loika were from cen-
 tral Connecticut.  Tom Kelly, of Manchester,
 was among the football editors on hand,
 and  Tom Monahan,  athletic  director   at
 Bristol, and Connecticut's Bob Engels were
 among other well-wishers.
 Fern Tetreau, of Fairfield, spoke for the.
 Connecticut Football Coaches Association,
 which he heads.   Connecticut's J. Orleans
 Christian, newly inducted into the College
 Baseball Hall of Fame, shared the throng's
 congratulations. "I'm pretty proud," said
 Christian-of both his and Jessee's honors.

 HON. ALVIN E. O.'KONSKI
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. O'KONSKI.  Mr. Speaker, amid
 all the dissensions and the violence on
 our campuses today, unfortunately the
 voice of the dissenter gets the most pub-
 licity.                                                                                                                                                                                The voice of the fairminded, in-
 telligent, and responsible student is sel-
 dom seen on TV or printed in the news-
 papers.
 This article written by Richard Rus-
 sell, a student in his junior year at Wis-
 consin State University-Eau Claire, and
 appearing in the Spectator, the student
 newspaper is one of the best appraisals
 of the Vietnam war that I have yet seen.
 I recommend this article to my col-
 leagues:
 DISEASES AREN'T CURED BY TREATING
 SYMPTOMS
 (ABOUT THE AUTHOR.-A 21/2-year veteran
 of the Spectator staff, Richard Russell has
 closely pursued the development of the Viet-
 nam war through extensive daily reading.
 ("America can't keep playing diplomacy to
 please countries like the Upper Volta Repub-
 lic.  It's about time our Government realized
 that, if we don't act in our own self-interest,
 no one else will do it for us," Russell says.
 (Russell's article is the first on "The Soap-
 box," a page of opinion and depth reporting
 which will be featured throughout the year.)
 (By Richard Russell)
 Take an area of 40 million people and
 284,000 square miles (about the same as Wis-
 consin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and
 Kentucky).  Give it a steady temperature of
 70-plus degrees and a summer rainy season
 which yields 80 inches of precipitation an-
 nually (much like southern Florida).  Run
 a mountain range of 9,000 feet (like Oregon's
 Cascades)  through the middle  of it, and
 cover the rest with densely overgrown swamp-
 land (like Louisiana's).
 Attack the inhabitants with 200,000 native
 guerrillas and respond with 200,000 fcreign
 mercenaries.  You now have a recipe for war
 in Indochina.
 The people of the peninsula are largely a
 mixture of the Indonesians  of  the south
 and the Chinese of the north-whence the
 Indochinese.  They had a flourishing civiliza-
 tion of their own between 600 and 1750 A.D.
 The Khmers, as they then called themselves,
 had their capital and chief religious center
 in the city of Angkor.  The recently discov-
 ered ruins of the Angkor Wat (temple) indi-
 cate a high level of architectural development.

 But buddhism and inner political conflict
 combined to destroy the Khmers, and the
 region underwent a period of regression until
 reawakened by French colonial forces. Be-
 tween 1859 and 1893, France occupied the
 splinter states of  Cambodia, Laos, Cochin
 China, Annam, and Tonkin.  Cochin China
 was  made  a  colony;  the  rest  were pro-
 tectorates.
 France  improved  the     region  somewhat,
 with roads, harbors, and commerce, but kept
 a firm hand on the controls of government.
 The native rulers were allowed to continue,
 but they had only nominal power.  France
 operated Indochina as a. monopoly.
 There was considerable resentment built;
 up against this attitude of the French by
 the time World War II started.  When Vichy
 Prance ceded control of Indochina to the
 tyrannical Japarese, resentment continued
 to mount.  After Japan had lost the war,
 France had difficulty reasserting its terri-
 torial claim because of increasing pressure
 From Indochinese nationalists.
 THE RED MENACE
 Now, for a moment, let us look at another
 time and another place.  Back in 1917, while
 Germany was at war with the world, a revo-
 lution broke out in Russia against the op..
 pressive regime of Czar Nicholas II. Nicholas
 was defeated, deposed, and later killed.  A
 democratic  government   lasted only a few
 months  before  Bolsheviks  led  by Nikolai
 Lenin and Leon Trotsky overthrew it for
 their own Communist regime.
 The Communists also gained       control of
 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,  Mongolia,  and
 parts of Finland and Japan.  World War II
 presented them with an opportunity to seize
 Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Albania. Bulgaria,
 Hungary,  Yugoslavia,  East  Germany,   and
 Mast Austria.
 In  1947  they  saw    another opportunity.
 The world was weary of war, and dismissed
 and rebellion in China as insignificant. It
 was really a Communist invasion.  In 2 years,
 Red leader Mao Tse-tung had driven the na-
 tionalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek onto the
 island of Taiwan,  thus bringing into the
 Communist fold the most populous nation
 on earth.
 in later years, the world has seen commu-
 nism expand into North Korea, Tibet, East
 Congo, and Cub-a, with influence in Egypt,
 Algeria, Guinea, Indonesia, and any number
 of South American nations.
 0   STRIKES
 In all their gore s, the Communists never
 once won a democratic election.  Their only
 loss was East Alt=,tria, when that nation was
 neutralized.  Yugoslavia, although pursuing
 its own course                 under Josef Tito, remains
 firmly Communist.
 Returning to the Indochina of  1947, we
 find that France had granted greater auton-
 omy to Cambodia and Laos.  Cochin China,
 Anna.m, and Tonkin had been combined into
 the single country of Vietnam. All three
 nations   were   undergoing very   gradual
 emancipation.
 lint some Indochinese could not wait.  Na-
 tionalist forces demanded immediate sover-
 eignty.                      Rebellions flared.  The French For-
 eign  Legion  busied  itself with  brush              fire
 wars.
 During this period, the expansionist Mao
 met Vietnam's Lo Chi Minh, a leader who,
 like Mao himsel:, was it self-made man of
 great personal appeal and considerable mili-
 tary ability.  With Mao's support, Ho organ-
 lied the immodestly named Vietminh, mas-
 queraded. as it nationalist to solicit support,
 and launched a. vicious guerrilla war against
 French rule in Indochina.
 As this war drew international attention,
 O.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
 recognized the scope of the problem: "The
 propagandists of Red China and Russia make
 it apparent that their purpose is to domi-
 nate all  of southeast Asia *  *  *  the so-
 called rice bowl                                                                           which helps to feed the
 densely  populated   region   that   extends
 from India to Japan.  It is rich in Inany
 ra,w materials, such as tin, oil, rubber. and
 iron ore."
 Unfortunately  for the    French  colonial
 forces, they placed too many eggs in one
 basket.   'When  that   basket-the   heavily
 fortified   bastion   at   Dienbienphu   was
 crushed by the Vietminh on May 7, 1954,
 the end was in sight.
 By an agreement of the major powers at
 Geneva, July 21, 1954, independence from
 France was granted to Laos, Cambodia. and
 Vietnam.  and  the  latter  was partitioned
 along the 17th parallel.  The northern none,
 capitaled at Hanoi, went to Ho.  The south
 had a West-oriented native government.    A
 plebiscite was to be held in both zones in
 July 1956 to determine if the country should
 be  reunified.   However, Red-hating  Pouth
 Vietnamese Premier Ngo Dinh Diem     flatly
 refused  to  believe  that  the  Communists
 would permit it free vote.  Ii-.. July 19115 he
 virtually  eliminated  any  chance  of  hold-
 ing elections, and the country has bee i di-
 vided ever since.
 THE WADING GAMI:
 To prevent further Communist incursions
 into southeast Asia, the United  State:   has
 joined in defensive alliances with Japan, Aus-
 tralia, the Philippine Republic. New Zea land,
 Great Britain, France, Pakistan, and Thai-
 land.  This has not prevented the Pathet Lao
 from taking over half of Laos and forcing the
 rest to be neutralized.  It has not prevented
 wavering toward communism by Camb,idia's
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk.  It has not pre-
 vented the Vietcong from wreaking de: truc-
 tions over all of South Vietnam.
 't'he United States has 200,000 troops in
 Vietnam,  and  will double that number by
 year's  end.   It  has the 7th  Fleet  and
 heivy air support.   It has the aid  c, the
 South Vietnamese Government.    Yet it, has
 not stopped the Vietcong.
 'When the Cong is exhausted, it slips back
 into the rain forest.  When it is defeated,
 it recruits in North Vietnam.   When it is
 hungry, it terrorizes  villages When  it is
 ill-equipped, it ships in supplies along the
 Ho Chi Minh Trail.
 'Who  remembers  the  strategic  ha!niet?
 Last year, the United States reverted to the
 medieval system of fortifying hamlets, ;end-
 ing the villagers out to work by day,                                                                        and
 locking them behind barbed wire at right.
 Horrified French officials pointed out that
 Di.enbienphu was no more than a large 'stra-
 tegic hamlet."  After losing several villages,
 the United States conceded,
 Who remembers the "advisers"?  Thin was
 America's title for the 40,000 troops i' had
 stationed in Vietnam before 1965. Tha'v are
 now combatants.
 Who remembers the American p?omi:.a not
 to bomb in Laos?  South Vietnamese Pre-
 nc.er Nguyen Cao Ky revealed recently that
 the United States has been doing so for over
 a, year.
 All these incidents are indications th; t the
 war is escalating.  The United States is corn-
 nutted now to war, and war it must fif,ht to
 the logical end.    But, as any physician, will
 testify, in fighting a disease, one doe!; not
 treat the symptom;  one treats the cause.
 We    must          circumvent  the  symptom - the
 Vietcong--and strike directly at the ca we-
 Red China.                                                                                 And we must not stop untI the
 disease is totally exterminated.
 "War  is            hell," remarked  Gen.  William
 Tecumseh Sherman, and Benjamin Franklin
 agreed, "There never was a good war or n bad
 peace."
 'Then why are wars fought.?  In nron gilt   inunediate   rejection   by Hanoi.
 R:r.ther, the American proposal would place
 the Security Council officially in back of a.
 g}encral search for peace, such as the United
 :;rates  has     already,   informally, asked the
 G.N.  co undertake.      This would include a
 conference, with the objective of applying
 the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962  (the
 latter concerned Laos) and of setting up and
 supervising a cease-fire.  Composition of the
 conference is not spelled out; the door re-
 mains open l or mediation or arbitra Lion, as
 suggested by Pope Paul.
 The effect of such a resolution would bring
 pressure upon the Soviet Union to do what
 it has thus far refused to do-vsponsor an-
 other session of the Geneva Conference.  It
 would also, if adopted (or even if accepted
 by a majority and lose through a Soviet veto)
 furnish Security Council support for Ameri-
 can peace efforts.  And in any case, by ac-
 companying the           bombs with a resolution,
 President  Johnson  dramatizes  anew  the
 American position: to fight if necessary; to
 negotiate if possible.

 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. GIBBONS.  Mr. Speaker I am
 proud to say that the great :sate of
 Florida is moving into the vanguard of
 those States making maximum use of
 provisions of the Economic Opportunity
 Act, the war on poverty.
 I am proud of the tremendous prog-
 ress being made by the city of Tampa
 and Hillsborough County which comprise
 the congressional district which I have
 the privilege to represent in the House
 of Representatives.  On our east coast,
 Volusia County is moving forward in
 several antipoverty programs.  'Inc 'Day-

 FEDERAL  FUNDS  ALREADY  IIAva: Asia ii  MANY
 PERSONS IN VOLUSIA COUNTY
 (By Ray LaPrise)
 As Project Upgrade officials are struggling
 to get approval from the Office of Economic
 Opportunity, Atlanta, on their own applica-
 tion for working funds and the application
 from the West Volusia Council on Human
 Relations,  some  Federal  money  to  fight
 poverty already has come into the county.
 Volusia school officials got a $71,088 grant
 last summer to operate Head Start  This is
 the project under which 526 5- and 6-year-
 olds from low-income families throughout
 the  county   got  kindergarten instruction,
 medical care and nutritious lunches in 13
 schools from June 8 to July 27.
 As the program went on for  tuts,  their
 parents also were invited to attend night
 meetings  at  the  schools  where qualified
 speakers lectured on such topics as legal aid
 and how to manage on low budgets
 The antipoverty program also has been
 felt through  Neighborhood  Youth  Corps.
 John Shaw, manager of the local :Florida
 State Employment Service, said his office was
 asked to recruit young people-mostly high
 school. dropouts-by the Florida Park Serv-
 ice,                                                                              Florida  Forestry  Service and  Road
 Department.
 Shaw,    who  also serves  as chairman of
 Upgrade's  committee  on  employment, job
 training and counseling, said 37 young people
 from this area were hired out of the 61 who
 applied for Neighborhood Youth Corps since
 last June.
 As rnenibcrs of the Neighborhood Youth
 Corps, they work 32 hours a week and spend
 another 2 hours a day studying.   Among
 them are eight youths and one girl on duty
 at Tomoka State Park.
 Financially   handicapped   students fat
 Bethune -Cookman  College  here  and at
 Stetson University, DeLand, have been en-
 abled to continue their work because of what
 is called the work-study program.
 Bethune- Cookman College got a grant of
 $18,000 for the spring and summer semesters
 last year and another grant of $90,000 for the
 fall 1965 semester and 1966 spring semester.
 College officials distribute the money to
 student:,  hired  for  such  campus  jobs  as
 laboratory and library assistants and dormi-
 tory supervisors.
 A number of Stetson students also bene-
 fited by work-study grants received by the
 university, including $14,235 for last spring's
 semester, $40,000, last summer and $22,306
 for the 1965 fall semester.

 Mr. WHIT of Idaho.  Mr. Spcakel', I
 am impressed by the efforts being, made
 in the State through local soil conserva-
 tion districts to improve and make better
 use of our land and water resources.  I
 am particularly interested in the work
 being done in local watershed projects to
 reduce flooding, protect lands and. homes,
 and bring about a brighter economic
 future.  I am concerned that this work
 move  ahead  as  rapidly  as  possible.
 Serious  flooding in  1962  and    1964
 produced millions of dollars in dar,mages
 in  my   State;  we need  to be  better
 prepared in the future.
 One problem in watershed progress is
 potentially of concern in many States
 where public and private lands are inter-
 mingled.   In several cases, public land
 agency funds have been insufficient to
 meet land treatment needs; but projects

 Buffalo's New Urban Renewal
 Commissioner
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RICHARD D. McCARTHY
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, January 24, 1966
 Mr. McCARTHY.  Mr. Speaker, my
 hometown of Buffalo faces all the chal-
 lenges which other major U.S. metro-
 politan areas face: the decline of the
 central commercial core, blight in the
 gray areas, traffic congestion, a dwin-
 dling tax base, and so forth.
 But I am happy to report the city of
 Buffalo, behind the leadership of Mayor
 Frank A. Sedita, is tackling these prob-
 lems with new vigor and determination.
 A keyman in this great undertaking is
 our new urban renewal commissioner,
 Richard L. Miller.  I am proud to say
 that Mr. Miller is an old and close friend
 of mine.  He played a key role in the
 conception and development of the Buf-
 falo urban renewal program  and he
 comes to his new post with la,urels won
 In pushing forward Buffalo's dynamic
 downtown renewal program.
 Buffalo is on the move.  And young
 men like 40-year-old Richard Miller are
 playing key roles.  Under leave to extend
 my remarks, I here. include an article
 from the Buffalo Courier-Express of
 January 25, which sets forth Mr. Miller's
 view  of  his  new  and  challenging
 assignment :
 MILLER TAKES STERN VIEW OF RENEWAL
 (By Jim McAvey)
 REALISTIC VISIONS
 Buffalo's new $17,500 a year urban renewal
 commissioner, Richard L. Miller, is no builder
 of castles in the sky.
 He is a hardheaded pragmatist with visions
 of a more beautiful city.  He believes these
 visions can be made realities only through
 the down-to-earth, patient expenditure of
 energy needed to sail programs over seas of
 redtape.
 "We are going to have to combine our
 aspirations   with   realism,"   Miller   said.
 "There is a lot of redtape to go through and
 it takes time."
 Just turned 40, the fair-skinned, 6-foot,
 200-pound commissioner looks askance on
 "miracle working" urban renewal schemes.
 OBJECTIVE:  CONFIDENCE
 "I think Buffalo can be made a greater city,
 but this job is only part of it," he said.
 "Urban renewal can only provide the physi-
 cal setting for living.  There are other as-
 pects-economic, political, social, cultural."
 A native of Buffalo, the blue-eyed Miller
 has a full head of blond hair that sweeps
 straight back from a high forehead.  He has
 the broad shoulders and coordinated move-
 ments of the athlete he was.
 He gives the impression of being intensely
 sincere about the job he is undertaking.
 "I'm not starting anything," Miller said.
 "This is a continuing program that has to
 grow.  We have to develop a sound and ex-
 panding program, one that will gain the
 confidence of the people of Buffalo and of
 the Federal  Government, which provides
 most of the money."
 Miller believes most people have a feeling
 the Federal Government runs the whole ur-
 ban'renewal program.
 "Actually," ; he, said, "the responsibility is
 on the city.  We. have to merit continued
 Federal support or the Federal Government
 can put the brake on.  Our local perform-
 ance 1s what counts."
 WELL PRIMED
 Miller  said he  is  depending  on  men
 who have been working in the urban renewal
 department to brief him on the status of
 programs.   There are 66 employees in the
 department.
 But he gave much evidence of having de-
 tailed knowledge of the programs.
 He said his work as executive director and
 secretary of the Greater Buffalo Development
 Foundation had much to do with his views
 on urban renewal.  He was executive direc-
 tor of the foundation from May 1958 until
 he took over his present job January 1.
 The foundation played a vital role in the
 planning and promotion of the downtown
 renewal project.  Miller sees the downtown
 project as an excellent example of what can
 be  brought  about  without  Government
 funds.
 CODES, INCENTIVES
 "Downtown is showing what we can do on
 our own," he said.  "Part of the deal is for
 people in official capacities to encourage peo-
 ple to do something about their environ-
 ment.,.
 Miller does not believe that rehabilitation
 of dilapidated  houses  and  neighborhoods.
 "just happens," or that enforcement of hous-
 ing codes is, of itself, enough.
 "People have to be convinced that some-
 thing good is. going to come from their efforts
 to improve their properties," Miller said.
 "We must give people incentives, through
 public actions, to upgrade their properties
 far beyond minimum standards required by
 the code."
 FAMILY MAN
 A 1949 Dartmouth graduate who served in
 the Navy In World War II and the Korean
 war, Miller started out to be a newspaper-
 man.  He was                                                                                                     a reporter for the Buffalo
 Evening News in 1951 and again from 1953 to
 1958.
 He smokes  a pack a  day,  golfs,  bowls,
 reads, and spends a lot of time "amusing my
 four kids."
 He is married to the former Patrizia Nagy
 of Toledo, Ohio, a sculptress who has given
 him "a great deal of interest in the arts."
 They live at 650 Lafayette Avenue.

 Mr. PELLY.  Mr. Speaker, passage of
 H.R. 12410, the GI education bill, was not
 only morally right but economically
 sound for our Government.
 To provide for the smooth and con-
 structive return of our servicemen to
 civilian life is just as essential as it Is to
 prepare him with needed training and
 equipment to enable him to do a proper
 job in the Armed Forces.
 I venture to say, Mr. Speaker, that this
 action will pay similar dividends to those
 realized from the investment in educa-
 tion, for veterans of World War II and the
 Korea l conflict.  I am sure this assist-
 ance will account for an increase in our
 A559
 gross. national product as did the invest-
 ment in the education of veterans of .
 World War II and Korea.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JACK BROOKS
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. BROOKS.  Mr. Speaker, with the
 resumption of bombing of North Viet-
 nam there has risen considerable contro-
 versy in the American press concerning
 the bombing and the intensified peace
 efforts that preceded it and are continu-
 ing.
 Extensive coverage has been given to
 a very vocal minority that opposes our
 efforts to maintain the freedom of the
 Vietnamese with the result that it is, at
 times, difficult to determine how the
 average American views these activities.
 However, a recent editorial, which ap-
 peared on February 2, 1966, in the Beau-
 mont Enterprise, an outstanding news-
 paper published in southeast Texas,
 states succinctly the feelings of an over-
 whelming majority of our citizens who
 support the President and who under-
 stand and are aware of our responsibility
 and purpose in southeast Asia.
 The text of the editorial follows:
 A TEXAN DECIDES
 In spite of our disappointment that the
 37-day lull in the bombing of North Vietnam
 failed to bring peace talks, we feel that the
 long pause was on the whole a net gain for
 this country.
 We have underscored our devotion to a
 peaceful settlement in Vietnam in a way
 that neither friend nor foe can misinterpret.
 We have cut the ground from underneath
 the feet of those critics in Europe and Asia,
 who, for varying reasons, have tried to paint
 us in the colors of aggressors or new colo-
 nialists.
 Our reconnaissance has been such that,
 now that the bombing is being resumed, we
 know where the enemy troop and supply
 buildups have taken place and we can hit
 those places quickly and in great force.
 Thus, it seems to us that the pause did
 more good than harm.
 Given the intransigence of Hanoi and Pei-
 ping, the negative, churlish and unyielding
 attitude of the Communists, the President
 had no choice but to renew the bombing
 attacks on the enemy's staging grounds in
 North Vietnam.
 Be it noted, also, that during the entire
 period of the bombing pause, there was never
 the slightest lull in the terrorist tactics of the
 Vietcong on the ground.   Unharmed men,
 women, and children among civilian refugees
 were savagely slain, along with American and
 South Vietnamese soldiers.
 We are glad that President Johnson made
 a new Vietnam peace bid, even as he ordered
 the bombers back into action. The two ac-
 tions taken together would seem to indicate
 that we will, in' the words of the late Presi-
 dent Kennedy; "never negotiate from fear,
 but never fear to negotiate."
 It is likely that hard decisions and harder
 days are ahead for President Johnson and all

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JACOB H. GILBERT
 + H.' NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. GILBEH,T.                 Mr. Speaker, a few
 days ago I called to the attention of MY
 colleagues in the House the plight of
 our merchant marine and expressed dis-
 appointment and concern over the cut
 in the 1967 budget funds for this im-
 portant fourth arm of our country's de-
 fense.             In this connection, I insert in
 the RECORD a statement by Mr. Joseph
 Curran, chairman of the AFL-CIO Mari-
 time Committee, which follows:
 The budget request for the Maritime Ad-
 ministration this year is sadly inadequate.
 It reflects an adoption of the Interagency
 Maritime Task Force report.   This     report
 was  rejected  by  the  President's  Maritime
 Advisory Committee. We also understand
 that this report is opposed by the Secre-
 taries of Commerce and Labor.
 Longstanding     national  policy  provides
 that we shall have a merchant marine to
 carry a substantial portion of our waterborne
 import-export foreign commerce, and also
 capable of serving as a naval auxiliary in
 time of war or national emergency.  To as-
 sure that our merchant marine would serve
 the Nation in this dual capacity. various
 aids such as the operating and construction
 subsidies are extended to qualified operators.
 because of the lack of Government lead-
 ership which reflects indifference and neglect
 in advancing this policy, our merchant ma-
 rine has declined to where it carries less than
 9   percent   of   our   waterborne   foreign
 commerce.
 The  Secretary of Commerce  must       have
 realized  the cause  of  the declining  fleet
 clearly when just recently he stated that he
 is opposed to building foreign and that the
 Government has not fulfilled its obligation
 in building a merchant marine.
 in realization of the sad state of our mer-
 chant marine, the President established the
 Maritime Advisory Committee.  At its first
 meeting. the Maritime Advisory Committee
 adopted a resolution endorsing our national
 maritime policy, as stated in the 1936 Mer-
 chant Marine Act, as in the public interest.
 Following this, the Committee developed a
 program, the basic theme of which is the
 renewal  and  expansion  of  the  American
 merchant marine.
 At the time it became obvious that the
 Maritime Advisory Committee was going to
 come up with a program for developing a
 merchant marine, the Interagency Maritime
 Task Force was estabished to counter and
 add  confusion  to the MAC  recommenda-
 tions.             To add to the confusion, the task
 force, which' contains the Maritime Admin-
 istrator's  recommendations,  has advocated
 less ships to carry less cargo and even these
 ships to be built principally in foreign yards.
 This year's budget request of $85 million
 for construction subsidies ($47 million less
 than last year)  provides for building only
 11 ships.  This is raised to 13 after some
 doubtful and very peculiar juggling of fig.
 ores.
 The operating-differential subsidy request
 is $185 million  ($5 million less than last
 year).
 Members of the House and Senate have
 expressed their disappointment of the budg-
 et request.  Their course of action to cor-
 rect the situation is not known at this time.
 Even If Congress should increase the inade-
 quate budget request, as its been suggested,
 it is doubtful that the Administration would
 use the funds.
 The Interagency Task Force report and
 this  year's budget request  highlight.;  the
 fact that administrative dedication to our
 Nation's maritime policy is a prerequisite to
 the successful administration of our mari-
 time laws.  Currently, the Maritime Admin-

 course of action which would administer the
 merchant marine Out of existence.
 If this confusion and neglect is not, cor-
 meted soon, there will be no merchant marine

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. PRENTISS WALKER
 OF MISSISSIPPI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr.         WALKER                       of  Mississippi.  Mr.
 Speaker, the development of foreign
 trade in the poultry industry is most
 important for the continued growth of
 this vital industry in the United States,
 as well as the contribution it would make
 toward a more favorable balance-of-pay-
 ments picture for our country.
 I call to the attention of my colleagues
 a news release of the National Broiler
 Council, an organization dedicated to
 the growth, development, and improve-
 rnent  of  the  poultry industry.   This
 news release. dated December 23, 1965,
 announced participation of Mr. G Ted
 Cameron,  president  of  the National
 Broiler Council, and Mr. Frank Frazier,
 executive vice president, in the U.S. Feed
 Grain Trade Exhibits and Seminar,
 scheduled to take place March 7 to 18,
 1966, in Tokyo, Japan.
 Participation  in this project by  the
 National  Broiler  Council  I  am sure
 will prove most valuable in the de-
 velopment of foreign markets for the
 poultry industry in the United States.
 The article follows:
 DECEMBER 23, 1h65.
 WASHINGTON. D.C.-The appearance of two
 American broiler industry leaders on  the
 program of the U.S. Feed Grain Trade Ex-
 hibits and Seminar scheduled for next March
 7--18 at the U.S. Trade Center in Tokyo,
 Japan was announced here this we,,,k by
 Clarence D. Palnlby, executive vice pre:=.ident
 of the U.S. Feed Grains Council.
 Palmby announced that G. Ted Cameron,
 president  of Mountaire  Poultry  Co.,  Inc.,
 North Little Rock, Ark., and Frank Frazier,
 executive  vice  president  of  the National
 Boiler Council, Washington, D.C., will be
 key participants during various segments of
 the entire seminar.  Cameron is president of
 the National Broiler Council.
 In  making  the      announcement, Pnhnby
 pointed to the timely topics to be presented
 by each of the broiler industrymen.  "The
 realm of 'Practical Broiler Production in a
 Scientific Age' and `The Broiler Busir,ess-
 Finance, Controls, and Marketing' constitute
 two papers bearing important messages to
 be given by Mr. Cameron.  He is a true prac-
 titioner and exemplifies the executive who
 heads  the  multiphased  operation  which
 comprises a modern broiler firm, and the Far
 East audience will be especially interested in
 what he has to say."
 The Feed Grains Council executive em-
 phasized that the topic Frazier will cover,
 "Consumer Information,  Market Research,
 and Market Support Functions of a Com-
 modity Organization," will not only benefit
 the sponsors of the trade show, but will
 strengthen market development programs in
 Japan.
 "We were especially glad to receive the re-
 port that the Broiler Council's board of di-
 rectors accepted our invitation extended to
 Frank Frazier," stated Palmby who is acting
 for the various groups cooperating with the
 Foreign  Agricultural  Service  of  USDA  in
 making  the  arrangements  for  the    Tokyo
 event.  "We have observed the outstanding
 job that the National Broiler Council has
 done during the past several years, and con-
 sider it a classic example of intelligent self
 help in molding a production-oriented in-
 dustry into a hard-hitting, market-oriented
 group using strong programs in merchandis-
 ing, research, and consumer education-all
 to the benefit of both the industry and the
 general public," he added.
 Palmby noted that the Feed Grains Coun-
 cil cooperates wherever possible on. worth-
 while projects that can be of value to groups
 promoting the export of agricultural prod-
 ucts.  "We  feel  the  planned  trade  show,
 done in cooperation with the American Soy-
 bean Association, the National Renderers As-
 sociation, the U.S. Agricultural Attachc's of-
 fice in Japan, and the International Trade
 Fairs division of FAS to be one of these ex-
 tremely worthwhile projects," he stated.
 The announcement from the U.S. Feed
 Grains Council concluded noting the satis-
 faction  and  appreciation of the council's
 executive  when  he  said,  "Cameron  and
 Frazier, along with the others who will make
 up the program, insure our efforts in making
 a positive contribution to our expanding dol-
 lar sales of an important, interrelated group
 of American agricultural products to Japan.
 We certainly are indebted to the National
 Broiler Council leadership for their coopera-
 tion."

 Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina.  Mr.
 Speaker, those of you who know and
 respect Vice Adm. John S. McCain will be
 as pleased as I to learn of the outstand-

 our United Nations Ambassador Arthur
 J. Goldberg.
 On January 29, the Old Guard of the
 city of New York honored Admiral and
 Mrs.  McCain.  Ambassador  and  Mrs.
 Goldberg were unable to attend the ban-

 mandant. Colonel Rizza:
 I regret indeed that matters of state over
 which I have no control will prevent me from
 being  with  the  Old  Guard  on  Saturday

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX        February 7, 1966
 URGED WAR DECLARATION
 `..n  July Mr. Pose urged air attacks on
 soviet-supplied missiles in North  Vietnam,
 not long before the President ordered the
 missile sites bombed.  In August the Repub-
 lican leader called for a declaration of war.
 Also In  August, Republicans  under Mr.
 FORD'S leadership issued a "white paper" on
 the war charging that Mr. Johnson, in seek-
 ing a negotiated settlement, "seemed to dis-
 card the independence of South Vietnam as
 an objective" of the war.
 But when Congress reconvened this year,
 Mr. Foan's first newsletter to his constituents
 i;ook a different tone.
 "We will support anything which Mr. John-
 on does to obtain a prompt, just, and secure
 ocace," he wrote.   "If this can be accom-
 plished by immediate negotiations through
 diplomatic, channels, we favor such negotia-
 tions.                            it the Commander of Chief finds that
 Further military action is necessary to achieve
 freedom  and  independence  for  the  Viet-
 namese, we will support such action.                                     Know-
 ing that there is no substitute for victory, we
 will back the President in his every effort to
 achieve military or diplomatic success."
 The concluding word, "success," appeared
 to observers here to be the key to the state-
 ment.  In effect, the Republican leader was
 backing Mr. Johnson fully, both diploniati-
 cally and militarily; but he was also insisting
 that the Johnson policy produce "freedom
 and independence for the Vietnamese."
 Staternents by former Vice President Rich-
 ard M. Nixon also seem to reflect the develop-
 ing Republican position.   Mr. Nixon con-
 ferred with Republican Congressmen before
 appearing on "Issues and Answers" on Ameri-
 can Broadcasting Co. television last Sunday.
 In that appearance he attacked Democrats
 who took "the appeasement line" but re-
 frained from direct criticism of Mr. Johnson.

 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Jo-

 of the Vietnam war and the changes
 which have taken place in his column.

 column follows:
 AGAIN, A NEW WAR
 SAIGON.-Behind all the churning and wal-
 lowing and tergiversation of American policy
 in th'..'se last 6 weeks, there is one very simple,
 bleak fact.                   The war in Vietnam has been
 radically transformed, almost to the point
 of becoming a new war.
 The last major transformation occurred
 last suinmer, with the commitment of U.S.
 ground forces on it big scale. The President's
 decision to make this commitment was ex-
 tremely courageous,                                     and  the commitment
 paid :Ill magnificently.
 largely as a result of Secretary McNamara's
 reform   and  modernization of  the  Armed

 ;did not about the victories.
 Iii consequence,  by  the    beginning  of
 November, "the Vietcong main forces were
 nearly on the ropes." This summary was
 given  by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge.
 His view is shared by just about every other
 American out here with experience to form a
 judgment.  At this juncture, however, the
 next transformation of the war began to
 be evident.
 Precisely because the American commit-
 ment  threatened  to  break  the  fighting
 strength of the Vietcong main force, as well
 as the North Vietnamese unite already in
 South Vietnam, a massive further invasion
 of South Vietnam by North Vietnamese regu-
 lars was ordered in Hanoi.  The new units
 swiftly moving in quite naturally upset the
 whole balance of the war.
 This lied, in turn, to the exceedingly grim
 briefing given to Secretary McNamara when *
 he was last here.  The chances are, in truth,
 that it was much too grim.  For example,
 the North Vietnamese were credited with the
 capability of laying down 138 icons a day on
 the South Vietnamese border, via the Ho Chi
 Minh Trail.  This tonnage, of course, would
 sustain  all too  many  North  Vietnamese
 divisions.
 In fact, however, if the enemy is currently
 laying down 60 tons a day oii the border,
 he is now doing a lot better than the wisest
 analysts believe. Furthermore, distribution
 from the border forward to the fighting units
 of 138 tons a day would require an army of
 at least 80,000 coolies, who would in turn
 consume about 65 tons of rice day.
 Thus there can be little doubt that Secre-
 tary McNamara was given a n exaggerated
 picture of the number of additional North
 Vietnamese units that can be permanently
 supported   in   South   Vietnam.    "Per-
 manently" is the key word, however, for the
 desperate decision to eat up all the stocks
 accumulated and cached in the jungles by
 the Vietcong would, of course, permit a good
 many  additional units   to  be temporarily
 supported.  And in any case. without regard
 to future capabilities, the stepped up North
 Vietnamese invasion of the south had al-
 ready created a wholly new situation.
 Secretary McNamara's report on the de-
 mands                                                                                    of          the  new  situation  thereupon
 touched off the churning and wallowing in
 U.S. Policy, typified by the peace offensive
 and the bombing pause.  But no amount of
 wallowing   and  churning can  change  the
 necessities, as  the outcome   has  shown.
 Three  additional  divisions.  either three
 American or two American and one South
 Korea ii, are needed to redress the balance and
 recapture the initiative enjoyed in October.
 This increase in General Westmoreland's
 troop requirement, from six to nine division
 equivalents, in turn means a requirement
 for more U.S. troops than can be rapidly pro-
 vided without calling up the Reserves.  For
 the time being, the President may perhaps
 think he can escape from meeting General
 Westmoreland's requirement by one dodge
 or  another.  If  so,  the  enemy  will soon
 enough teach him his error.
 It is far more likely, however, that the
 President thinks he can meet General West-
 more.tand's requirement without calling up
 the Reserves, by using a whole series of clever
 dodges.  For example, all sorts of-specialized
 troop units, easily obtainable by a callup,
 are desperately needed to break the logistical
 logjam. here,  without which  larger forces
 cannot easily be supported.
 But at the cost of some delay, private con-
 tractors can be hired to attack the logistical
 logjam.  By the same token, the Army's au-
 thorized troop strength has been greatly in-
 creased.                                                                                             Ready divisions may therefore be
 borrowed from  the  United  States,  with
 skeleton divisions taking their place in the
 Strategic Reserve.
 But such dodges are dangerous and un-
 worthy.                                                                                             They mean delay wh%n speed is
 vital.  They mean a further show of irresolu-
 tion when stern resolve is vital.  They mean
 no margin for the future., when the con-
 spicuous existence of a margin is vital,  Thus
 Lyndon Johnson's fiber, as a leader of a na-
 tion at war, is now being put to a supreme
 test.
 Where Were  a Pickets? Nowhere To

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. MASTON O'NEAL
 OF GEORGIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7_1966
 Mr. O'NEAL of Georgia.  Mr. Speaker,
 a newspaper in my congressional district
 has raised a very pertinent and interest-
 ing question.  Where were the antiwar
 demonstrators last  month  when  the
 United States undertook its worldwide
 peace  offensive? It is  now apparent
 that the Vietcong, Hanoi, and. other
 members of the international Commu-
 nist conspiracy have thumbed their col-
 lective noses at President Johnson's 37-
 day bombing pause and his peace mis-
 sions throughout the world.
 If the noisy pacifists in America were
 sincere in their desire for a peaceful set-
 tlement of the Vietnam conflict, it ap-
 pears that demonstrations against the
 Hanoi regime would have been in order.
 But they are not sincere.  As a matter
 of fact, this is added proof that they are
 simply disloyal persons intent on em-
 barrassing  America  and                                                                                                                                                         giving  aid,
 comfort, and political help to our ene-
 mies.
 An editorial appearing in the February
 1 edition of the Tifton, Ga., Daily Ga-
 zette, concludes that the Vietniks oper-
 ate under a double standard.
 I wholeheartedly concur with the edi-
 torial which follows:
 WHERE WERE THE PICKETS?   NOWHERE To BE
 SEEN
 Any time during the past month would
 have been an ideal time for a demonstration
 by the Vietnam war protesters-a demon-
 stration not against the United States but
 against the Hanoi regime.
 It was that long and more since this coun-
 try first halted bombing raids over North
 Vietnam.  For 4 days during the Vietnamese
 new year's celebrations  our  troops main-
 tained a strictly defensive posture, although
 the Vietcong's unilateral cease-fire did not
 include Americans.
 In the meantime, Presidential peace emis-
 saries continued to scurry between Wash-
 ington and a dozen world capitals seeking
 the diplomatic formula that could lead to an
 armistice.
 Why did we not see a march on Washing-
 ton, or at least a few pickets outside the
 White House, to dramatize support for these
 efforts of the Government?  Why no mass
 meetings putting a bit of pressure on the
 North Vietnamese who, as they themselves
 said, have been heartened by the activities of
 peace-loving American students'?
 Why indeed?
 The silence of the past weeks has done
 more than the noisiest demonstration to ex-
 pose th double standard of the vietniks and
 to prove the shallowness, naivete, and essen-
 tial futility of their cause.
 This is not to charge them with the blame
 for the failure of the peace offensive.  They
 are not that important, and in any event
 a demonstration in support of the Govern-
 ment  at this stage would  probably have

 Thomas M. O'Ryan: A Professional
 Profile
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GEORGE W. GRIDER
 OF TENNESSEE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. GRIDER.                       Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
 day to pay homage to a distinguished
 citizen of Memphis, Tenn.-Thomas M.
 O'Ryan,  chairman of  the board  of
 O'Ryan & Batchelder, Inc., largest tran-
 sit advertising firm in the United States.
 Tom O'Ryan's story reads like a chapter
 from the saga of Horatio Alger.  His
 amazing rise in our free enterprise sys-
 tem has been the subject of a United
 Press International success profile, and
 his career will be the subject of a chapter
 in a forthcoming book on outstanding
 American businessmen.
 Under unanimous consent I insert in
 the Appendix to the RECORD a profile of
 this outstanding American and resident
 of the Ninth Congressional District of
 Tennessee:
 PROFESSIONAL PROFILES THOMAS M. O'RYAN,
 CHAIRMAN, O'RYAN & BATCHELDER, INC.
 A  19-year-old  Irish  immigrant  named
 O'Ryan applied for work with a New York
 section gang in 1932.
 The job, digging a subway tunnel through
 Manhattan's bedrock.
 Thirty years later, a new advertising poster
 went up in New York subways: "An O'Ryan
 & Batchelder Operation."
 It was the same O'Ryan.
 In the  years  between,  Thomas  Michael
 O'Ryan had become chairman of the Na-
 tion's largest transit advertising firm.                       When
 he was awarded the New York subways ad-
 vertising franchise In 1962, O'Ryan had pro-
 gressed from subway laborer to subway ad-
 vertising czar.
 His story begins in Ireland.
 A. PLUSH TIMES ON THE AULD SOD
 Tom O'Ryan, second of six sons born (in
 1912)  to Edward O'Ryan and Mary Cusack
 O'Ryan in Limerick City, Ireland, didn't ex-
 actly begin life with a silver spoon in his
 mouth.
 In 1928, a family financial crisis developed.
 The elder O'Ryan's business plunged down-
 ward.  Mary O'Ryan decided to make extra
 money opening  a  small  hotel.   Edward
 O'Ryan's wrath was old fashioned and quite
 Irish.
 "No matter what happens, a woman's place
 is in the home," he raged.
 The rift grew.  Living at home became
 untenable.
 B. STREETS PAVED  WITH  GOLD
 At 17, Tom O'Ryan booked passage for the
 United States.
 With $400 he arrived in New York in Sep-
 tember 1929, registered at a YMCA, began
 j obhunting.
 Within a short time, he was hired as a file
 clerk at a salary of $27.50 every 2 weeks.
 Indeed, the streets were paved with gold.
 One month later, the stock market crashed.
 Tom O'Ryan was out of a job.
 The era of wonderful nonsense skidded
 to a fast stop.  In job interview lines, O'Ryan
 often heard:
 "Look at that Irish immigrant taking jobs
 away from good American citizens."
 Even  that  traditional  Irish  haven,  the
 police department, was closed to O'Ryan as a
 noncitizen.
 Right then O'Ryan filed citizenship papers.
 Later,  he was awarded citizenship in the
 minimum time possible.
 O'Ryan took spot jobs on boats.  He worked
 as a messenger.  He even applied as doorman
 at Radio City Music Hall.
 "Sorry," the Music Hall's chief of service
 said.  "You're   big-but   you're not  big
 enough."
 Would there be an usher's job available?
 "You're too big to qualify as an usher,"
 the chief said.
 Size did prove helpful in landing the sub-
 way   tunneling   job.  Unfortunately,   it
 didn't last long.
 D. DO IT  YOURSELF  SALES  AND  ADVERTISING
 One day, as a messenger, O'Ryan delivered
 a package to a company trying to sell a con-
 signment of damaged men's suits.
 He volunteered to take on the job, invest-
 ing his last few dollars in sales brochures
 describing the suits.  Soon he was holding
 sales meetings during lunch periods, handing
 out brochures, taking orders.
 "Within 20 days, I had sold several hun-
 dred suits," O'Ryan said.
 E. THE BIG RHUBARB
 Then, bitten by the free enterprise bug,
 O'Ryan borrowed $20, rented a horse and
 wagon for $4 per day.  Every morning, at
 4 a.m. he would arrive at New York's whole-
 sale vegetable center, buy a load of produce,
 then  clop-clop  over  the  Brooklyn  Bridge
 to sell it house to house in Flatbush. Often
 it was 10 p.m. when he reached home.
 "On a good day, I made enough to buy
 food-for the horse," O'Ryan said.
 "Why not specialize?" a friend asked.
 That sounded good.  O'Ryan chose rhu-
 barb.                                                                             He bought stocks of rhubarb, stored
 the boxes in his landlady's basement.
 Unfortunately, the hot-water pipes caused
 fermentation in the rhubarb.   The house
 took on a most distinctive smell.   Pedes-
 trians began using the other side of the
 street.
 O'Ryan's landlady was irate.   Only native
 Gaelic charm-and an. offer to whitewash
 her cellar free of charge-saved the day.
 At  that  time,  to  the  envy of  friends,
 O'Ryan got a full-time job as elevator opera-
 tor at Saks Department Store.                                                                                  O'Ryan, soon
 catching the eye of management, was pro-
 moted to floorwalker.
 F. BONANZA TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
 From Saks, O'Ryan kept an eye on Wall
 r' --et.   When he heard a brokerage house
 ~.._s hiring runners, he took the job at pay
 no higher than his Saks salary.  He figured
 investment opportunity as a side benefit.
 Soon he was investing a few dollars, then
 plowing It back.  He parlayed his capital into
 several hundred dollars.  When he had ac-
 cumulated  close                                                                                        to  $5,000,  his  longtime
 dream of a tropical island became stranger.
 Why not go to the island paradise-Hawaii?
 He quit his job and booked passage.
 In Hawaii, he became restless.  He started
 teaching school part time.   Money dwindled
 steadily.   When  he  got  down to  passage
 money, he sailed for San Francisco. He then
 crossed the continent in his entire fortune:
 a secondhand car with Hawaiian plates.
 "I  soon    realized I could have   gone  to
 Hawaii and invested my money at the same
 time," he said.  "I made a mistake: living
 off capital. I never did that again."
 A553
 In 1936, he returned to Saks 34th Street
 store-broke, tanned,, wiser.  By 1937, Saks
 had promoted O'Ryan to assistant to dress
 buyer at $75 per week.
 0. ENTER: TRANSIT ADVERTISING
 Back in 1890, Tennessee's Barron G. Col-
 lier started selling streetcar ads In Memphis.
 By the time O'Ryan went to Saks, Collier was
 selling  and  servicing  transit  advertising
 throughout the United States.
 In 1938, O'Ryan heard Collier was hiring
 salesmen in New York.   He applied.       The
 sales manager raised his eyebrows at the
 lusty Irish brogue.
 "Ever sell transit advertising?"
 "No."
 "Look,  fellow,  we're  turning          down  ex-
 perienced  salesmen,"  the  manager                                                                                                                                                   said.
 "What makes you think you can do it?"
 "I'm willing to work," said O'Ryan, turning
 red.   "If I don't sell anything, don't pay
 me.    Try me and see."
 If a man offered to pay his own expenses,
 he must have confidence, at least.
 "You're on," he told O'Ryan.   "Twenty-
 five dollars per week draw."
 O'Ryan  joined several  new men  in  for
 training. Then Collier announced out-of-
 town territories.  O'Ryan was told:
 "Your territory is Georgia and the Caro-
 linas.                                                                                                                                     You leave tonight."
 Although he'd never been south, O'Ryan
 suspected a greenhorn Irishman would not
 be particularly welcome.   However, admit-
 ting defeat was not within O'Ryan's char-
 acter.                                                                                                                                     He caught a train.
 H. IRISHMAN IN GEORGIA
 O'Ryan will never forget his first pros-
 pect-Craig's  Honey  Bread-in  Columbus,
 Ga.
 "Young man, we've never used your ad-
 vertising, and we don't intend to start now,"
 the baker told him.
 O'Ryan went back Tuesday, Wednesday,
 Thursday, and Friday.  No sale.  On Satur-
 day, he took a new tack.
 "I've been taught to answer all sorts of
 objections," he said, spreading his literature
 on the table.  "Anything you ask I can find-
 even if I don't know the answer."
 The baker sighed, "Looks like I'm going
 to have to have it.  Better sign me up.
 O'Ryan said later, "I think he bought so
 he could close shop and go home.  But it
 gave me a big lift.  After that, I started
 selling."
 And sell he did.     In 1938, O'Ryan ranked
 No. 1 in the Nation among Collier salesmen
 in bringing in 5-year contracts-the longest
 term sold.    In 1939, O'Ryan's outstanding
 sales record won him promotion to Collier
 district manager for Tennessee, Mississippi,
 and Arkansas.
 1. OUT OF TRAGEDY, NEW OPPORTUNITY
 In  1940,  shortly after  founder  Collier's
 death,   the  organization   went     bankrupt.
 Funds from the advertising business  had
 financed disastrous real estate ventures.
 O'Ryan joined a newly organized nation-
 wide firm-National Transitads.                                                                                                                                                He became
 southern division manager in 1942.    When he
 became a vice president in 1944, he moved to
 Memphis, his home and business headquar-
 ters since.  In the meantime, he made per-
 manent contributions to the transit adver-
 tising field-
 In Oklahoma City when all Interior transit
 space was sold, O'Ryan developed the first
 exterior bus poster.   (Exterior transit ads
 had been carried by streetcars.  This was the
 first exterior bus poster.)   Today, 65.9 per-
 cent of transit's volume comes from exterior
 vehicle posters.
 O'Ryan expanded the exterior poster into
 the prototype of today's king-size poster-
 the mass display panel seen today on buses
 throughout the United States.
 O'Ryan organized and served as first dean
 of National Transitdds new sales school.

 in  1947, O'Ryan resigned.   In  1948, he
 formed Tom O'Ryan Advertising Co.   He be-
 t*arI by signing an agreement to manage bus
 advertising in Memphis.   In 1949, he ac-
 quired the Atlanta franchise.
 In 1951. Tom O'Ryan was looking for a
 dramatic way to help Libby Foods get dis-
 h'ibution for a new product.  His reasoning:
 Why not put samples of advertising and the
 product on a bus- -then drive it directly to
 wholesalers and retailers?
 'thus  the  first  merchandising  bus  was
 horn. Since that time, O'Ryan has directed
 dozens  of  merchandising  bus promotions.
 ()ther transit ad firma have put the concept
 to work, too.
 0. O'RY.AN AND BATCHELDER
 [a November 1953, a nine-city transit sys-
 ioIri in the Carolinas called for advertising
 scuds. O'Ryan's firm was invited.   So was
 't'ransit Advertising Co., Peoria, Ill., operated
 I,y Joseph H. Batchelder, Jr.
 O'Ryan, who knew Batchelder from in-
 dustry meetings, telephoned him and sug-
 =;ested:  "Why not come by Memphis, and
 we'll go together?"
 Batchelder agreed.
 I?n the plane from Memphis to Charlotte,
 N.C., Tom O'Ryan and Joe Batchelder found
 considerable  common  ground  in  business
 philosophy.   By 'the time plane landed, the
 two men had decided to bid as O'Ryan and
 Batchelder.
 '['he new combination got the     contract.
 t )'Ryan & Batchelder, Inc., was underway.
 By 1955, 0. & B. was offering transit adver-
 Lising in Charleston, W. Va., Indianapolis,
 t .ouisville, Milwaukee-plus 19 other cities.
 ;ty 1960, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston, and

 'today, 0. & B. holds franchises in 70 U.S.
 urban areas.  Advertising coverage through-
 out nearly 25.000 vehicles makes 0. & B. the
 Nation's largest transit advertising company.
 r. & B. sales volume during 1965 was more
 than $16 million.

 RECOVERING  FROM  ILLNESS--BRADY  GENTRY
 REMEMBERED  FOR  SERVICE  IN CONGRESS
 (By Dale Thorn)
 Each afternoon, Brady Gentry walks his
 niece from his fourth-floor hospital room to
 the front door of Medical Center Hospital.
 About 2 months ago (November 7, to be
 exact), the former third district Congres-
 mar.. was stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage
 causing speech problems and partial paral-
 ysis of the upper and lower extremities.
 Today, only the speech problem remains
 and  the 70-year-old native eest Texan  is
 greatly  improved,  according  to  his noire,
 Oscelie Thompson of 1223 Peach.
 Ten years ago, while still a Member of the
 House, Gentry was in his prime.  Just he-
 fore Gentry's retirement from Congress, Rep-
 resentative CLARK FISHER of San Angelo paid
 tribute to the quiet-spoken Tyler solon, de-
 scribing him as 'the most interesting person
 I have met in Congress during the 14 years
 f have served."
 "Never a party hack or a narrow party-
 liner," Fisher continued, "Brady Gentry al-
 ways put the good of the country ahea.:a of
 political considerations as he cast his votes.
 "What greater  tribute  can be paid any
 man?  His stature rises high above the run
 of party politics and back-scratching t !ch-
 niques."
 On    the Washington  scene  4 years  and
 seldom raising his voice in the House, Gentry
 wars recognition as one who diligently in-
 formed himself on bills and voted his ~!on-
 victions with apparently no regard for party
 lines or political expediency.
 '6a this and other respects, he was recog-
 nized as one of the most unorthodox poli-
 ticians in Congress.  He often voted in pat-
 terns that might be expected to lose a man
 support among his constituents.
 Yet, in his one bid for reelection, against
 a formidable foe, he came out on top.  In
 1954 he defeated the man. who had pre-
 ceded hint. LINDLEY BECKWORTH, of Glade-
 wr:;ter. who in 1952 made an unsuccessful bid
 for the U.S. Senate against Price Daniel
 Gentry spent virtually the entire campaign
 period of 1954 in Washington and repeal edly
 told friends that, BECKw0RTI3 was very popu-
 lar and would probably beat him.
 But Gentry won in a close vote and 11e:cx-
 wORTH returned to Congress in 1957 after
 Gentry stepped down.  Ironically, the only
 election Gentry ever lost was a congress onal
 election back in the 1930's.
 The victor in that race was a former school-
 teacher by the name of LTNDLEY BECKWORTH.
 in 1957 Gov. Price Daniel named Gentry as
 otairman of the State highway commission.
 to making the appointment, the Governor
 referred to Gentry as "the best informed per-
 sen on highway administration and legiala-
 tinn."
 Gentry declined Daniel's appointment, but
 earlier, from 1939 to 1945, he had serv,-d as
 chairman of the commission and was presi-
 dent of the American Association of State
 Highway OHic:eats in 1943.  In the House he
 served on the Committee on Highways and
 Roads.
 During his four terms as county judge of
 South County, one of his major achievements
 was the developrne:nt of an improved sy:I tern
 of  county roads,
 Later, lie  took the lead in the pro.lram
 to correlate the State and National higivvay
 systems.
 A bachelor, Gentry was born on a farm
 near Colfax, in Van Zandt County, on March
 25, 1895.  He borrowed money from a Van
 Zaandt County farmer to pay for his educa-
 tion at Cumberland University and  'Tyler
 Commercial College.
 :His first political job was a clerkshp its
 the Van Zandt County tax collector's .Dice.
 After moving to Tyler he served first as os-
 sistant city tax collector, then as county at-
 torney and later as county judge.
 With his background of farm life, Gentry
 has always had a warm spot in his heart for
 the man who follows the plow.  It was under
 his leadership that the Texas system of faun-
 to-market roads was established.
 For over 20 years, Gentry has taken  Iui
 avid interest. in the golfing career of Ben
 Hogan  and  traveled  all  over  the United
 States to watch him play in tournaments.
 A member of Willow Brook Country Club,
 Gentry has never had much interest in play-
 ing the game himself, but last spring a Dal-
 las sportswriter tagged him with the title
 "Ben Hogan's Shadow."
 In Congress Gentry was a conservative.
 He preached governmental economy and was
 opposed to foreign aid on the scale proposed
 by the national administration.
 Today, Brady Gentry looks forward to re-
 gaining his full strength and leaving the hos-
 pital.
 Gentry seldom bothers to reminisce about
 his past-a record of achievement that rivals
 Horatio Alger stories.
 Politics may never again know such an
 unpolitical man.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. BERT BANDSTRA
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE S
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. BANDSTRA.  Mr. Speaker, now
 that the Vietnam issue is before the U.N.
 Security Council the delegates there will
 no doubt discover some of the difficulties
 the United States has struggled with in
 its efforts to deal with the Communists
 in southeast Asia.
 The U.S. resolution to the U.N. Secu-
 rity Council on Vietnam recommended
 that  "appropriate  interested  govern-
 ments" arrange a conference "looking
 toward the application of the Geneva Ac-
 cords of 1954 and 1962 and the establish-
 ment of a durable peace in southeast
 Asia."
 In an editorial of February 2, 1966,
 the Chicago Daily News stated that the
 United States "comes to the U.N. at a
 time when all else seems to have failed."
 Yet, the editorial says, "If it does noth-
 ing else, the United States appeal to the
 U.N. Security Council cuts the ground
 from under some of the critics of the ad-
 ministration's Vietnam policy."
 The Daily News reminds us that the
 U.N. members "have seen for themselves
 how Hanoi and Peiping rejected all U.S.
 peace overtures."
 Because of its realistic analysis of an
 issue with which we all must deal realis-
 tically, I hereby include the editorial in
 the RECORD:
 'psis: U.N. TACKLES VIETNAM
 If it does nothing else, the United States
 appeal to the U.N. Security Council cuts the
 ground from under some of the critics of he
 administration's  Vietnam   policy.    These
 critics have protested long and loudly that
 the proper way to handle the Vietnam prob-
 lem was to dump it in the lap of the United
 Nations, as if that body had a magical s,Au-
 tion for every problem anywhere.

 Some of the reasons why the U.N. was not
 earlier and formally brought into the Viet-
 nam war are quite apparent now that the
 step has been taken.  The first and perhaps
 the only result is to bring into the U.N.
 chamber the same acrimonious debate that
 has been raging outside it.
 Moreover, the formal setting of this de-
 bate seems more likely to harden attitudes
 than  soften them,  and  force  irreversible
 decisdons by record voting, including the use
 of the U.N. veto.  Perhaps this no longer
 matters; at this stage attitudes have already
 hardened, and the formality of voting may
 not change the situation.
 For  all  practical  purposes,  the  United
 Nations has been involved in the Vietnam
 war all along, if only on an informal basis.
 whatever advantages now comes of involv-
 ing it formally is largely tactical, for the
 situation in Vietnam is hardly comparable
 to those that have been resolved in the past
 by U.N. intervention.  The only rough par-
 allel is Korea, and the U.N. was able to act
 then only because Russia was on a tempo-
 rary "walkout" at the time.
 Nevertheless, the United States comes to
 the U.N at a time when all else seems to have
 failed.  The members of the U.N. have seen
 for themselves how Hanoi and Peiping have
 rejected all U.S. peace overtures.  And they
 have  seen  how  North      Vietnam-not  the
 United   States-curtly rejected in   advance
 any ideas for a settlement the United Na-
 tions might produce.
 This in itself ought to be proof for the
 U.N. as to who wants peace and who doesn't.
 Unfortunately, proof of this kind isn't what
 tips the scales in the United Nations, any
 more than it alters the opinion of those in
 this country who would have peace at the
 price of dishonor.
 Indiana Celebrates Its Sesquicentennial
 undermanned,  Governor Henry made the
 momentus decison to send an army to capture
 it.  To do the job, he called upon a militia
 officer who represented the county of Ken-
 tucky in the Virginia Legislature;  George
 Rogers Clark.
 Governor Henry commissioned Clark a lieu-
 tenant colonel, authorized him to draw 1,200
 pounds from Virginia's treasury, and to enlist
 an army for the confrontation.  By May of
 1778, Clark had gathered in 150 men and he
 assembled them on the Ohio River near the
 present city of Jeffersonville. On July 4,
 1778, he moved against the British, first cap-
 turing Kaskaskia.   On July  14, be moved
 onward to Fort Sackville.  To his amazement,
 the British garrison had left and the Ameri-
 can flag was raised without a shot being fired.
 When the British commander at Detroit
 got news of Clarks' success, he was enraged.
 In December, he rushed 600 troops to Vin-
 cennes and recaptured this beseiged outpost.
 Again the British flag went up.
 When Clark, who had returned to Kaskas-
 kia, heard the news, he decided to retake the
 fort. This momentus decision to march again
 upon *Fort Sackville has been recorded as
 one of the great moments in Hoosier history.
 Unknown at first to Clark was the decision
 of the British commander at Fort Sackville
 to release most of his troops for the winter.
 Clark would never have learned of this had it
 not been for the heroic journey of Francis
 Vigo, a rich trader of Vincennes, who fled
 the town and took the news to Clark.
 With Vigo's financial backing, Clark man-
 aged to scrape together 170 volunteers.  On
 February 23, he set up camp just' 2 miles
 from the fort.  While his men cleaned their
 firearms, Clark sent a message to the inhabi-
 tants of Vincennes, warning them of the im-
 pending attack.                                                                                   That night they moved for-

 story loghouse.  He helped his father build
 the second one in 1811.
 At that time roads were only worn paths
 or perhaps corduroy (logs laid close together
 across the path).  Horseback or foot was the
 only means of travel.   Some progressive per-
 sons learned from the Indians and built
 drags-two shafts with their one end tied on
 either side of a horse and the other dragging
 the ground with a box of a seat.
 Even wagons were a rarity. Yarbro reports
 that the first two-horse wagons were as much
 a curiosity as were the first telephones or
 "iron horses."
 Money then was also a rarity.  Most com-
 merce was carried out by barter and trading.
 The man who had a dollar of good money
 was a wealthy person.   Beaver skins and
 pelts were often a medium of exchange.
 Times have indeed changed since those
 first hardy Hoosiers crossed the Ohio River
 and moved north or followed the rivers south
 from Wayne County.  Fantastic changes have
 occurred in the past 150 years.
 During 1966, our Indiana sesquicentennial
 year, the Hoosier Farmer will examine the
 times and tales of those pioneer days.  And
 along the way we will consider too, some of
 the great men who have forged and shaped
 the history and the heritage of our State and
 Nation.  And, too, we will report upon special
 events that will commemorate our Indiana
 sesquicentennial and 150 years of progress.

 Standing on the corner of Tu Do, which,

 HON. RICHARD L. ROUDEBUSH
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. ROUDEBUSH.  Mr. Speaker, this
 year, 1966, Indiana celebrates its ses-
 quicentennial year.
 The accomplishments of the people of
 Indiana during the past 150 years have
 been many, and the contributions to the
 Nation in times of peace and war have
 been a source of pride to all Hoosiers.
 In the January 1966, issue of the
 Hoosier Farmer, the official magazine of
 the Indiana Farm Bureau, a very authen-
 tic and interesting portrayal of the era
 in America when Indiana was settled
 appears.
 In order that the Members of Congress
 share in the knowledge contained in this
 interesting article, under unanimous con-
 sent, I request its publication in the
 RECORD.
 The article follows:
 The American Revolution was underway.
 The British were on the move and as they
 strengthened  their  garrisons  across  this
 young country, they gathered into their fold
 the Indians who were violently in opposition
 to the American settlement.
 Virginia, under the governorship of Patrick
 itl  t  the Northwest   and
 o
 d t
 mI
 only 30 able-bodied defenders, and 60
 from help, Fort Sackville surrendered.   At
 10 a.m. on the morning of February 25, 1779,
 the American flag was raised again over Vin-
 cennes never to come down again.
 The consequence of this battle was to be
 of significant importance to the Colonies and
 to the growth and expansion of the United
 States.   Virginia  ceded  Vincennes  to  the
 United States in 1784.  The formation of the
 Northwest Territory followed in 1787.   With-
 in a year, 20,000 Americans came down the
 Ohio to the new land, for with the Northwest
 Territory came the prohibition of slavery,
 public education, and the guarantee of re-
 ligious freedom and civil rights to all people.
 And when the Indiana territory was created
 in 1800, Vincennes became the seat of gov-
 ernment.
 The early Indiana pioneer was hardworking
 and practical.  The new country offered a
 challenge to muscle rather than to mind.
 The early settler contented himself with the
 limited culture he had brought with him.
 The family Bible and sometimes one other
 book were the extent of his cultural tools.
 The woman had the most difficult time.
 She usually had only an iron skillet for cook-
 ing.  The only lamp was a clay pot filled
 with bear grease.  The food she put on the
 table consisted of cornbread, wild berries,
 plums and apples, turnips, potatoes, and all
 sorts of wild game and fish.
 These  early  trailblazers had  their  good
 times in spite of the daily struggle for exist-
 ence.  The boys rassled, ran foot races, and
 participated in shooting matches.     Standard
 amusements  included  sugar  making,       bee
 hunting, husking bees, and apple cuttings.

 for days, doing their cooking, washing, giv-
 ing birth to babies, and, some of them dying,
 waiting to be moved to refugee camps and
 later to resettlement areas.
 Soon the moving began, and then the big
 white ship began to spew forth its human
 cargo to take the places of the people on the
 sidewalks until they, too, could be moved.
 All of their possessions, except the little
 they could carry on their backs, had been
 abandoned in their flight.
 't'hey were frightened and hungry.  They
 had been told by the Communists the Amer-
 icans were cruel sadists, and even cannibals
 who might kill them and grind them into
 hamburger.  These stories were told them by
 a people who themselves had tortured those
 they were able to capture in their escape at-
 tempt.  Viet Minh soldiers caught one escap-
 ing boy, put his bare feet on a rock, and beat
 them to a pulp with rifle butts.  "Now walk
 to freedom," they told him.  The boy crawled
 to freedom and was in a Saigon hospital
 where a then U.S. Navy doctor, a Lieutenant
 Dooley, was trying to save his feet.  They
 had driven a row of tacks, more than 100 of
 them, around the top of one man's head.
 "There is your crown of thorns," they told
 him.  And they had driven bamboo chop-
 sticks                   through  the  eardrums  of   another
 because they suspected him of listening to a
 Bible reading by a priest.
 Other ships came later.  The Saigon River

 a, million refugees had flooded into Saigon,
 and meanwhile uncounted thousands more

 the way down they were given generous por-

 ranch of it went on under the guns of Sai-
 gon's Binh Xuyen rebellion which was aided

 didn't want anybody to succeed in southeast
 Asia as long as they couldn't have it.
 Many of the tailenders were mowed down
 by Communist  rnachineguns on the  Hai-

 His column, published in the San Fran-
 cisco Chronicle, of January 30, follows:

 young daughters.
 As we join up with of Elbie today, Ili! and
 his pretty wife, Birdie Bird, are in the parlor
 of the big white house, Birdie Bird keeps
 lookin' out the window and of Elbie appears
 a mite fidgety.
 ELBIE. Well, I suppose we got to talk to
 them about the marrying.  Where they from?
 Waukegan,  Illinois?   Waukegan.   It  ain't
 even in Cook County.
 Cranes BIRD. Now, Elbie, you know Ps i's a
 very nice boy.  And I'm sure his parents are
 lovely.
 Er.BIE. M'aybe so.  But what's wrong with
 that daughter of ours?  Why, she could've
 married a duke or :a. prince--some your  fel-
 low whose folks we could treat as equals.

 Now you be nice, you hear'?
 (The parents of the intended groom,       a
 pleasant-looking middle-class couple enter.
 Elbie extends his hand with a professional

 ELBIE. Sure nice of you to cerise howdy
 and press the flesh.  That's a fine boy you
 gc t.   You must be mighty proud of hirn,
 serving in his country's uniform.

 time I think of how fortunate he was I o be
 assigned to duty right here in Washin;ton,
 I thank God.
 I]LSIE (with a wave of his hand).   Don't
 mention it. Glad ta'r do it for the young man
 our daughter has democratically chosen as
 her intended. Like I said to Birdie Bird
 here, "Our country ain't got no room for
 class distinctions."
 GROOM's    FATHER. How    odd.      That's
 virtually what I said to Mother here after
 Pat broke the news to us.
 GROOM'S MOTHER. Yes, I will admit I was a
 little disappointed at first. I did have my
 heart set on Pat marrying a college girl,.
 ELBIE  (frowning).   What do you mean?
 She goes to college.
 GROOM'S MOTHER. Oh, yes, a nursing col-
 lege, isn't it?                                                                                                                         ]['d thought more of a real
 college. But then father here said there was
 no disgrace in having a nurse in the family
 these days.  Not if she's a registered nurse.
 And by the way, how are her grades?
 ELBIE  (testily). She's had a lot on her
 mind lately. Arid her sister does real well
 in college.
 GROOM'S MOTHER. Oh, the one that runs
 around with movie stars?  I suppose girls in
 Texas do mature early, don't they?  For Pat's
 sake, I hope so.  Not that we have anything
 against Texans, mind you. In Waukegan we
 treat them as equals.
 GROOM'S FATHER. Yes, as I said to mother
 here, "At least it beats Pat's fighting in Viet-
 nam."                                                                                                                            And after all, I said, this is a democ-
 racy.  So despite the obvious handicap of an
 immature wife with a penchant for notoriety
 who comes from the backwoods section of
 Texas and who is not-er-academically in-
 clined, I'm sure that Pat will somehow still
 manage to go far.
 ELBIF.  (thundering).   Yep,  about  10,000
 miles.  Just as soon as I can sign his trans-
 fer orders.
 Well tune in to our next episode, friends.
 And meantime as you mosey on down the
 long trail of life, remember what lilbie's of
 granddaddy used to say:
 " 'Tain't no use for proud daddies to fret
 about  their  tads  marrying  beneath  'ern.
 They ain't got no other choice."

 tend open hands for assistance from the
 United States.                                                      Even our wealthiest al-
 lies depend on our trade, loans, and mil-
 itary support.                                                                                                                          Yet how many are stand-
 ing by us today in our struggle for peace
 in Vietnam? Very few.  Not only are
 they not helping us, they are speaking
 out against our actions. An excellent
 proposal to this situation was suggested
 in an editorial in the February 3, Knox-
 ville, Tenn., Journal, which I ask to be
 printed in the RECORD:
 IF  ONLY LBJ DARED
 A man we know recently spent a few days
 in  the  hospital.   He  got  a  letter  which
 read this way: "There are two who are pull-
 ing for your early recovery.                                                                                                                                   I am one of
 them and Blue Cross is the other."
 Sometimes it looks as if Uncle Sam is in
 a predicament similar to that of our man
 in the hospital, except that we frequent-
 ly                                                                                                                             find  it  impossible to name some  gov-
 ernment friendly enough to us to be counted
 in the same class as Blue Cross.
 On cold, snowy days some Americans have
 time to brood over the evident lack of ap-
 preciation for the role which the                                                                                                                                       United

 States of America has played in modern his-
 tory and  especially in relation to certain
 governments.
 American arms and troops have twice In
 this century saved Europe from subjuga-
 tion by a powerful enemy.  American arms
 and troops in defense against Communist
 aggression halted the Reds in their tracks in
 South Korea.. The protective umbrella of
 these same arms and troops have been spread
 over  Britain,  Europe,  Greece,  Japan,  the
 Philippines and free nations everywhere since
 the end of World War II.
 Yet, with the exception of token contin-
 gents from Australia and South Korea, not
 one of these nations which have been pro-
 tected by American military and financial
 strength for a quarter of a century has vol-
 unteered  assistance  in  the  critical South
 Vietnam situation. Not only has there been
 a lack of physical assistance from all but a
 few of these countries which have been the
 beneficiaries of our manpower and money,
 but we have even been denied their moral
 support.  In the case of France, for example,
 we have seen a former ally actually consort
 with the Communists who plan the destruc-
 tion of that country no less than ours.
 It should be kept in mind, too, that the
 protection of the United States has provided
 for a long list of countries-more than 100 of
 them-which have been the recipients of the
 Marshall plan or other foreign aid, has been
 at our own expense.  As a matter of fact the
 tremendous cost of maintaining our military
 forces in Europe, for example, is one of the
 factors which make it impossible for the
 American Government to achieve a favorable
 balance of payments and to reduce the run
 on our store of gold at Fort Knox.
 As a result of our insistence upon financ-
 ing, in effect, the whole world, the claims
 against  our gold supply,  now reduced to
 about  $13  billion,  are about  twice  that
 amount.  Most of these I 0 U's are in the
 hands of central banks in Europe and are at
 least legally callable on demand.
 Of course, the President will not have the
 nerve to do it, but this fact does not obscure
 the picture of action that deserves to be
 taken.  Such action would be far more dras-
 tic than the reference he has recently made
 to withholding foreign aid handouts from
 countries which are hostile to us in every
 way until it comes time for them to be on
 the receiving end of Federal gifts.
 What the President should do, if he were
 free to do it, would be to pull out of Europe
 all American troops, weapons, and equip-
 ment and to use these forces in the South
 Vietnam  war.  This  would be  an act  of
 simple justice and at the same time would
 relieve both our adverse balance of pay-
 ments and shake up the economies of every
 nation in which we now have our troops
 quartered, primarily for their own protection.
 One may entertain himself on a winter's
 day  by imagining the indignant cries of
 alarm and consternation that would arise
 if any such action were announced by the
 White House.  Not only would deathly fear
 grip the chancelleries of our European friends
 at being left without the protection of U.S.
 forces against the looming threat of Russian
 communism, but there would be equal con-
 cern about a cessation of U.S. spending to
 support these forces.
 The United States is still in position to
 arotect  itself  from  any  external  threat
 which may be brought against it.  It must
 be conceded, however, that there is a basis
 for unhappiness on the part of the Amer-
 ican people to find that we are on a one-way
 street .when it comes to a crisis such as
 exists in South Vietnam.  Every other na-
 tion is willing to accept help from us, but
 few are willing to stand with us in our need.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. DERWINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, the
 shrill cries  of  Communist-infiltrated
 peacenik groups are being heard far out
 of proportion to their numbers and re-
 spectability.                                                                    I am pleased to note that
 the President, as Commander in Chief, is
 being supported by respectable voices
 across the country, one of which is the
 Park Forest Reporter, an outstanding
 independent publication serving that
 community in Illinois, which carried a
 most timely editorial in its February 2
 edition:
 A557
 courage to take the fight to the enemy and
 will be resolute enough to persevere until
 the victory tide turns in his favor.
 The role the United Nations will play is
 vague at this writing.  Many of our stanchest
 i allies have no stomach for this war, particu-
 larly in its undeclared status.  If the Con-
 gress declared a state of war existed they
 would have to suffer the risks a blockade
 would create.  It might take just this action
 to determine which of our allies are friends
 and which are neutrals or worse.
 We don't believe that mainland China will
 get involved in an all-out war.  They are a
 decade or more away from risking their very
 existence as a power.   Their dragon may
 snort fire, yet they are wary enough. to save
 their strength for a day when chances for
 success are not limited.
 Acceleration of the war in Vietnam was
 inevitable as Communist foes pay little at-
 tention  to peace  efforts.  It was  obvious
 that President Johnson ordered the resump-
 tion of bombing of military targets in the
 north with reluctance, still he had no other
 choice.
 The 37-day moratorium which was used
 to probe  every possible avenue toward  a
 peaceful settlement of the Viet situation
 met a firm rebuff from a stubborn foe who
 remains defiant and unyielding.  The Viet-
 cong are unwilling to negotiate unless their
 terms of removal of all U.S. and other for-
 eign forces from Vietnam are carried out.
 From their point of view, any other com-
 promise would be surrender, at least in the
 military sense.  The harsh realization is that
 they are convinced they will win the war.
 They already control nearly 70 percent of
 South Vietnam territory.  A heavily armed
 200,000 man U.S. force augmented by South
 Viet troops has been unable to uproot them.
 Despite suffering heavy losses of men, they
 continue their harassing tactics in the face of
 their enemies, inflict their damages and often
 manage to flee undetected.  Physically, it's
 nigh impossible to tell a friend from a foe.
 The enemy who an hour earlier tossed a
 bomb into an American billet, lolls around a
 South Vietnamese compound at chow time
 to take his meal of U.S.-provided foods.
 The Vietcong is relying on what they con-
 sider the softness of Americans.  They rec-
 ognize that the slow bleeding process of a
 war which could last as long as a generation,
 and not completely popular in our land, will
 provide the impetus for an eventual pullout,
 similar to the defeat the French were forced
 to accept after a 10-year struggle in Indo-
 china.
 An unsettled South Vietnam Government
 adds to the confusion of a clearcut victory
 effort and the corrupt practices by friendly
 officials tends to extend the war and to ac-
 celerate its cost.
 Yet only a decisive victory will turn the
 tide in our favor.  It dictates a fight that
 should go all out, short of use of nuclear
 weapons.  There are many reasons for a
 peace now, but it takes two to come to terms

 to talk terms and our talk must become the inequity of the old rates some weeks ago, the

 HON. WILLIAM A. BARRETT
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February ?7, 1966
 Mr. BARRETT.  Mr. Speaker, any
 businessman recognizes that a "good
 deal" is one in which both sides-or all
 sides-benefit.
 The Government recognizes this, also.
 The administration's decision to raise
 savings bond interest rates is a realistic
 reaction to changing conditions in the
 money markets.
 A higher savings bond interest rate
 can serve individual savers and the gen-
 eral economy.
 Everyone stands to benefit.
 Many newspapers across the land have
 praised the action taken to increase the
 interest rates.  One such editorial ap-
 peared recently in the Philadelphia Eve-
 ning Bulletin, and because I feel it is
 typical of many, I offer it for the REC-
 ORD.
 KEEPING FAITH
 President Johnson has simply recognized
 the Government's fiduciary responsibility to
 the holders and purchasers of E and H sav-
 ings bonds in directing the Treasury to in-
 crease the interest rate, since Interest rates
 paid on competitive forms of savings have
 climbed well above the 3%-percent E and
 H bond rate.
 There will, of course,. be some added cost
 to the Government.   But failure to bring
 these bonds into line with the market could,
 in time, erode their attractiveness, and in-
 crease the burden on other kinds of Treas-
 ury financing.  More important, the typical
 small saver would be cheated of his due re-
 ward unless he switched his savings to a bank
 or savings and loan account.
 The move could have been postponed for
 a time,  of course, until there were  more
 definite signs of buyer resistance.  But, as

 tor, noted in first calling attention to the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX        February 7, 1966
 Vincent J. DiMattina: A Real
 American
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JOHN J. ROONEY
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr.  ROONEY  of  New  York.  Mr.
 Speaker, in the immediate past we have
 seen the rise of a breed of American who
 has no place either in the traditions or
 future of this country. I refer to the
 draft card burners, those who deny and
 shirk their military obligation to the
 country because they "disagree" with the
 military policy of the administration.  It
 is with some pride and a great deal of
 pleasure, therefore, that I would like to
 talk  about  Vincent  J.  DiMattina     of
 Brooklyn.
 Vincent J. DiMattina is the New York
 commander of the Veterans of
 State
 Foreign Wars.    But he is much more
 than that.  He is, for example, a man
 who at the age of 16 had to leave school
 and go to work. on the Brooklyn docks.
 The Brooklyn docks, like waterfronts all
 the world over, are a tough place to make
 :I living.  But Vincent DiMattina did.
 Then the war came along.  In 1942 he
 unlisted in the Navy and after boot camp
 took instruction in deep sea diving and
 was assigned to Seabee Battalion 104.
 He served with that unit for almost 4
 years in the Pacific theater of war and
 reached the rank of chief boatswain's
 mate by the time he was discharged in
 December of 1945.
 Returning to Brooklyn in 1946, Com-
 inander DiMattina once again went to
 work on the docks.  But like so many
 others in those days, the war had shown
 him that an education was not a lux-
 ury           but       a  necessity. In  Commander
 DiMattina's case it was not merely a re-
 turn to college.  He had to go back to
 high school. Working a full week on the
 docks, he somehow managed to complete
 his high school and then went on to
 college.  From there it was law school.
 And all this while working a full, hard
 day.  In 1954, some 8 years later, he was
 admitted to the bar of the State of New
 York.
 Even more amazing, Commander Di-
 Mattina, while working and going to
 school, found time for an active role in
 veterans' affairs in Brooklyn.  In 1951
 he was elected county commander of the
 VFW in Kings County.  He also man-
 aged to organize and recruit members
 for 16 new VFW posts in Brooklyn.
 Along the way he served the VFW and
 his fellow veterans well. He served as
 Loyalty Day chairman, chairman of the
 department  rehabilitation  committee,
 department inspector, judge advocate,
 and was elected to the successive posts of
 .junior and senior vice commander of the
 Department  of  New  York.  He  was
 elected commander of the Department of
 New York at the 46th annual conven-
 tion in Lake Placid, N.Y., on June 26,
 1965,
 Commander DiMattina is a member of
 the Brooklyn Bar Association, the Fed-
 eral Bar Association of New York, New
 Jersey, and Connecticut. U.S. Govern-
 ment Appeals Agent for the local draft
 board, a member of the civilian advisory
 board to the 3d Naval District, and past
 grand knight of the Our Lady of Loretto
 Council No. 585 of the Knights of Co-
 lumbus.  He has also served as assistant
 counsel to the minority leader of the
 New York State Assembly in 1963 and
 1964  and presently is counsel to the
 speaker of the New York State Assem-
 bly on military and patriotic affair:
 Mr. Speaker, I have known Vincent J.
 DeMattina for many years and am happy
 and proud that our association has led
 to a close and warm friendship.  I would
 like to offer a salute to the VFW's New
 York Department commander, Vincent
 J. DiMattina-a real American.

 zation of the Senate Government Opera-
 tions Committee. Assemblyman Chana-
 nau cosponsored the  1965  safety car
 law in the New York State Assembly,
 and  as  an  authority on automotive
 safety, he has spoken on a subject of
 major concern and interest to all of us.
 I wish to call Assemblyman Chanai au's
 testimony to the attention of my col-
 leagues in the House of Representat.ves:
 EXCERPTS  FROM  TESTIMONY  OF  NEW  YORK
 STATE ASSEMBLYMAN ALEXANDER CHAN ,NAU,
 DEMOCRAT,  BRONX, BEFORE SUBCOMM[TTEE
 ON   EXECUTIVE   REORGANIZATION   OF THE
 SENATE COMMITTEE  ON GOVERNMENT OP-
 ERATIONS, FEBRUARY 3, 1966
 Chairman RIBICOFF and members o1 the
 subcommittee, as a member of this New York
 State Joint Legislative Committee for 3 ]ears
 and cosponsor of the 1965 safety car law
 under  which  the  prototype program was
 initiated, I can testify that it is the one
 program Detroit wants to stop cold.
 This is bipartisan legislation we are dis-
 cussing in New York State, and we hope at
 the congressional level. The problems this
 essential legislation runs into are bipartisan
 problems.
 With  Assemblyman  Julius  Volker.  Re-
 publican, of Buffalo, I battled for it on the
 floor of the assembly in 1965 while Senator
 Speno, a Republican who had developed the
 program, put it through in the senate In
 this matter, and in our prior and current
 efforts to have the first equipment and new
 tire safety laws passed, we felt the power of
 Detroit at work.
 This New York State Legislative Commit-
 tee has considered and legislated in every
 major field from visual acuity to speed limits
 to alcohol impairment to drug use to psy-
 chiatric and psychological prediction.
 Gentlemen, we have found that the cur-
 rent automobile is unnecessarily unsafe and
 productive of injuries and deaths, and we
 have found that getting essential changes
 made, device by device, is a long and difficult
 struggle.
 We have followed Senator Speno's leader-
 ship in the New York Legislature as has,
 directly and indirectly, the rest of the Na-
 tion.  We have found that obsolete concepts
 of salability based on styling still reign in
 Detroit, despite recent assurances to the con-
 trary.  As an indication, there is no one in
 the automobile industry in charge of safety
 design who has vice-presidential status, but
 each of the Big Three has a vice president
 for styling.
 A much better indication is the fact that
 50,000 Americans were killed last year and
 3,500,000 injured by smashing around inside
 the interior of the car, by being projected
 outside the car, or by being hit by a car.
 We cannot stop the majority of accidents
 from occurring because we don't, at this
 point, have the knowledge which would per-
 mit such a utopia.
 But we can stop the majority of the deaths
 and injuries from. occurring because the car
 is readily, changed for safety purposes.  Peo-
 ple are not readily changed.
 In 1966, we again have bipartisan legisla-
 tion under consideration to continue the
 safety car project, a $250,000 appropriation
 directed toward Federal grant subsidies and
 any and all public or private financial assist-
 ance.  Cosponsors at this point are Senators
 Speno and  Liebowits  and  Assemblyman
 Joseph M. Margiotta, Republicans of Long
 Island, and me, two Democrats and two Re-
 publicans.  We expect trouble.
 Now, what have we here before us in this
 feasibility report? We have the first au.Ito-
 mobile design safety check list, consisting of
 several hundred identified automobile haz-
 ards, the first such checklist for designers
 ever compiled in l30 years of automobile engi-
 neering literature.
 We have proof' that a car can be built,
 the New York State safety car prototype,
 that will prevent 75 percent of injuries and.
 fatalities at crash-impacts of 50 miles per
 hour, 75 percent in side collisions, 90 per-
 cent in rollover accidents, and 90 percent
 when a car runs into the rear of another.
 The study before us also shows ways to re-
 duce accidents through mechanical changes
 and to out down ;pedestrian injuries.
 We have the concept of a car designed ac-
 cording to aerospace systems analysis which
 protects astronauts.
 It took 7 years of concentrated effort based
 on dedication and conviction to produce the
 safety car prototype project in New York
 State.  We believe that we are, by experi-
 ence, experts in this subject of automotive
 safety and we have had the advice and serv-
 ice of the best technicians, engineers, sci-
 entists and physicians in doing our job.
 We urge the Federal Government to join
 us in this essential effort now, continuing
 the only existent safety car prototype proj-
 ect of its type in the world.  We welcome
 greater Federal effort in traffic safety and
 trust that the enthusiasm now being shown
 by certain Members of the Congress and
 various Federal agencies will not wane.  We
 welcome guidance from the Federal Govern
 merit as time passes.  Massive research proj-
 ects will, we hope, be initiated and carried
 through.  We ask you to show your intent,
 fighting spirit and conviction by joining us
 now in getting this prototype built.  It will
 tell us all what should be done, what can be
 done and how to do it.  It is design, safety
 design from the beginning, that marks the
 difference between this project and the "saf-
 est" car now being manufactured for sale.

 dence, detailed information, and entree to the
 principals handling this project In Mexico."
 In conclusion, the question might be asked,
 What has been done and what Is being done?
 Hundreds of thousands of pages in dozens of
 studies have been compiled-one of which
 seem to give the answers some people want-
 so they pile up and gather dust.
 The most recent of these studies Is a work
 by Harland Padfield and William E. Martin
 for  the  University  of  Arizona  entitled-
 "Farmers, Workers, and Machines."  This is,
 in my opinion, a well prepared document,
 and like some other, I am afraid, their con-
 clusions might not be what some people
 want.
 For example, on. page 294, this report
 states:
 "Public Law 78 and Its Administration.
 "1. Public Law 78 should be extended or
 some similar law enacted.  However, no in-
 creases in the total foreign farm labor supply
 should be allowed.
 "Even with an extension of this law, the
 use of Mexican national workers would de-
 crease rapidly without the aid of restricted
 legislation  under  technological  and  eco-
 nomic pressures already set in motion. - The
 only restriction should he on greatly Increas-
 ing the importation of Mexican nationals,
 thus avoiding formation of some new capi-
 tal-saving, labor-using technology.                                   Ending
 the program now will cause chaotic condi-
 tions within some crops and regions as adop-
 tion of new methods and technologies will
 be forced at too rapid a rate.  During this
 period,  consumer prices may rise precipi-
 tously.
 "The removal of the braceros simply im-
 plies the elimination of jobs they were per-
 forming.                     At the same time, the lower occu-
 pational classes, now complementary to the
 braceros`.tasks, will be also eliminated.  New
 but fewer jobs will be created for a different
 (and higher) occupational class.     Continua-
 tion of the bracero program would cause
 these changes to occur more gradually while
 economic, social, and technological processes
 eliminate the program within the next few
 years in a smooth and relatively nondisrup-
 tive manner."
 On page 295, we find the following:
 "OTHER FORMS OF ALIEN LABOR
 "To attempt to alleviate farm labor short-
 ages by a naturalization process, such as un-
 der Public Law 414,  is most undesirable.
 The green card worker cannot be regulated
 precisely in accordance with labor demand.
 Once admitted to the United States he is
 free to move to any area and any industry.
 If he encounters social or economic diffi-
 culty he becomes a problem to society as a
 whole rather than being only a farm labor
 cost.  He is a year-round problem imported
 to answer a seasonal labor demand."
 And we quote from page 296 of this report
 as follows:
 "Whose responsibility are these technolog-
 ically obsolete workers?.  To use a specific
 example, whose responsibility are the Anglo-
 isolates described in chapter 17 or the Indi-
 ans described in chapter 18?  Certainly we
 cannot blame their impoverished condition
 on the farmers for whom they usually work.
 The farm provides them a job where no other
 sector of our economy can.  The Anglo-iso-
 latex are on the farm because they have
 been rejected elsewhere,  The Indians are
 on the farm because the-farm allows them
 to  continue  to  participate in reservation
 life."
 And finally, may I go back to the front
 of the book under "Acknowledgments"-it
 says this :                                 -

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of              -
 HON. WILLIAM D. FORD
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. WILLIAM D. FORD.  Mr. Speak-
 er, those who watched the President of
 the United States deliver his state of the
 Union address, either in person or on
 television, saw an outstanding leader at
 his very best.
 The Detroit News, in an editorial on
 January 13, declared that the President
 "was at his best-persuasive, nonevasive,
 rock firm without being belligerent, de-
 terminedly hopeful for peace but offer-
 ing Americans no easy way out, at times
 quite eloquently moving, and throughout,
 utterly convincing."
 The editorial added, "It was the true
 voice of America the world heard last
 night."
 I share this editorial view of the De-
 troit News, and I am sure that few other
 editorials, columns, or news articles ana-
 lyzed or interpreted the President's state
 of the Union message as thoughtfully or
 as clearly as did the News editorial writer.
 I have permission, Mr. Speaker, to have
 this editorial made a part of the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.
 STATE OF THE UNION-A WORLD LEADER SPOKE
 Bringing the Vietnam record up to date for
 the Nation, Its foes and the whole world,
 President  Johnson  last night was at his
 best-persuasive, nonevasive, rock firm with-
 out being belligerent, determinedly hopeful
 for peace but offering Americans no easy
 way out, at times quite eloquently moving,
 and throughout utterly convincing.
 He spoke of our military might without
 bragging.   He underlined our decade-long
 commitment to the South Vietnamese people
 which some of his critics-but not President
 Johnson-would have us- run out on.   He
 warned that foe that their strategy was il-
 lusory; that the enemy was no longer close
 to victory and no longer had time on his
 side.                                     -
 Mr. Johnson brought it home to the Amer-
 ican people that not Americans alone are
 fighting and dying.  Eight South Vietnamese
 died for  every American who gave his life
 last year.  And to those of his countrymen
 doing today in Vietnam what Americans had
 done before them In Flanders fields, against
 the forces of Hitler and Toio and Mussolini,
 and in Korea, he pledged: "You will have
 everything you must have: every gun, every
 'dollar,  and  every  decision-whatever  the
 cost and whatever the challenge."
 Thankfully, he wasted no time or words
 on those who would snatch at peace at al-
 most any price, that frenetic fringe ranging
 from professors to draft card-burning stu-
 dents.  He had no time to waste on their
 state of mind in his state of the Union
 message.
 Yet it was in this field, in his determina-
 tion to seek an honorable peace that he
 spoke with the most warming conviction of
 all.  Mr. Johnson said:
 "We have made it clear, from Hanoi to
 New York, there are no arbitrary limits to
 our search for peace.   We  stand by  the
 Geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962.    We
 will meet at any conference table, discuss
 any  proposals-4  points,  or  14,  or 40-
 A549
 and consider the views of any group.  We
 Will work for a. ceasefire now or once the dis-
 cussions begin,  We will respond if others
 reduce their use of force. -  We will with-
 draw our soldiers once South Vietnam is
 securely guaranteed the right to shape its
 own future."
 -
 It is all there.  What more can a man do?
 What more. can a foe expect?   What else
 would the critics have him say? We stand
 by  the   terms. that ended- the first  Viet-
 nam war.   We are prepared to stand                                                                                                                                               by
 and  for  the  neutrality  of Laos spared   4
 years ago from what  its neighbors suffer
 today.    "We will consider the views of any
 group."   This is perhaps the most telling
 offer of all.
 It
 means we now accept that we
 must
 talk
 to the Vietcong or its political
 arm,
 the
 National Liberation Front.  Mr.
 John-
 son
 didn't say we'd buy what they demand.
 He
 didn't promise them a seat in any fu-
 ture  South Vietnam Government.   That's
 up to the South Vietnamese when, safe from
 coercion and bullets, they can make a free'
 choice.
 He didn't contend the Reds' 4 points or
 his  own 14  (like President  Wilson's two
 generations ago) were the limit.   The field
 is wide open. And, on this, he warned Amer-
 icans, also, that, should a cease-fire come
 about, it will be only the start, not the end.
 There'll be a long, hard pull for all at any
 conference table.                       -
 He confirmed we have communicated pri-
 vately wth our adversaries and he publicly
 offered them another choice: Either a cease-
 fire now even before negotiations begin-a
 tacit, unpoliced moratorium-or when talks
 are underway.  He did not set a time limit
 on our, bombing pause, which was wise.  We
 have an obligation to our GI's on the ground,
 too.  But he did say: "We will respond if
 others reduce their use of force."
 There  it  is, clear  and unequivocal-an
 open-ended offer to talk peace.  So far there
 has been no definitive response.   If there
 be none at all, then it may be days and
 months and years, but: "We shall stay as long
 as aggression commands us to battle,"   We
 shall not abandon Asia to conquest.
 The mailed fist and the hand of friendship
 at the same time, the warning we'll see it
 through- whatever the cost, yet the offer also
 of aid to all Vietnamese, North and South.
 Here was compassion and determination, re-
 solve without riproaring threats.  It was the
 true voice of America, the world heard last
 night.

 HOON. JAMES D. MARTIN
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. MARTIN of Alabama.  Mr. Speak-
 er, members of the Alabama delega-
 tion  were  privileged  to                                                          listen  to  a
 thoughtful report on H.R. 8282, unem-
 ployment compensation, at the recent
 meeting of the Associated Industries of
 Alabama.  I would like to share with all
 the Members the thoughts contained in
 this report by Mr. Hubert T. Sullivan,
 director of  industrial  relations,  Opp
 Cotton Mills, Opp, Ala.
 STATEMENT IN THE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FIELD,
 PRESENTED BEFORE THE ALABAMA CONGRES-
 SIONAL. DELEGATION, JANUARY 24, 1966
 (By Hubert T. Sullivan)
 Subject:  H.R. 8282, unemployment com-
 pensation.
 President Lem, member of the Alabama
 congressional delegation, and my fellow rep-
 resentatives of Alabama business and indus-
 try, I wish to thank you for the opportunity
 to say a few words in regard to the attempts
 that are being made by the administration
 to overhaul and completely modernize the
 so-called  antiquated  unemployment  eoun-
 pensation systems of the various States.
 You are familar with the administration
 bill, H.R. 828:2, which has been introduced
 and on which hearings have been completed
 by the Ways and Means Committee.  The ad-
 ministration with the full backing of labor,
 is attempting to sell this bill as a moderniza-
 tion program, claiming that the program has
 not been overhauled in a good many years:
 This is simply not true-the unemployment
 program is constantly being modernized and
 overhauled.  Nearly every session of the var-
 ious State legislatures make some changes
 in their unemployment compensation laws to
 meet changing economic conditions  or to
 solve some problem peculiar to their State.
 The overwhelming majority of the changes
 are in the nature of increased benefits or
 other liberalization  of the program.
 During the year 1965 alone, 30 States (in-
 cluding  Alabama)  increased  their  weekly
 benefit amount,   All but two States pro-
 vide for at least 26 weeks of coverage. Dur-
 ing                                                                                                                            1965,  four  States increased  their tax
 base over the $3,000 floor provided in the
 Federal act.  This brings to 18 the number
 of States with tax base in excess of $3,000.
 Maximum tax rates were increased in. eight
 States during 1965. Thirty-seven States have
 UC  taxes  above  the required  2.7-percent
 rate.
 A fair test to measure Federal legislation
 affecting socioeconomic legislative programs
 of the various States should be whether the
 proposed Federal legislation is designed to
 preserve and foster an environment In which
 the States themselves determine how best to
 balance change with stability and how best
 to tailor the programs to meet the needs and
 situations of the people of the various States.
 Instead of preserving the existing systems
 of State unemployment programs which have
 kept pace with economic and other changes,
 H.R. 8282 seeks to displace, if not demolish,.
 the State systems by substituting it cen-
 tralized  Federal  system  operating  Out  of
 Washington, under the Department of Labor,
 which superimposes its own predetermined
 blanket requirements upon all States alike,
 the richest, the poorest, the largest, and the
 smallest, the most industrial, and the most
 agricultural.  Does this meet the "test"' out-
 lined above?                                                                                                                                    Absolutely not.
 The present unemployment compensation
 program has furnished us one of the finest,
 if not the finest, example of Federal-State
 cooperation that we have.
 In Alabama, our unemployment compen-
 sation program has operated most efficiently
 under the direction of the Alabama Depart-
 ment of  Industrial Relations.   Scarcely it
 session of the legislature passes without the
 enactment of improvements in the Alabama
 law.   For  the  most part,  these  improve-
 ments                                                                                                                            are         worked  out    between  employer
 and labor groups in cooperation with the
 State agency and are presented to the leg-
 islature as "agreed" legislation.                                                                                                                                   In this way,
 the law is kept up to date and meets the
 needs for   which  it was created.   Several
 minor crises have threatened and have been
 overcome.
 As an example, in 1961, the trust fund had
 declined from a high of $85 million to a low
 of $44 million. A bill was rushed through
 the  legislature  which  not  only  increased
 benefits and made other liberalizations in
 the law, but which imposed a higher tax on
 employers-with the result that the trust
 fund has built up to approximately $90 :mil-
 lion at the present time.  This trust fund
 balance represents 5.23 percent of the total
 taxable wages for 1964.  Even with these im-
 provements, the average tax on Alabama em-

 strengthen our American educational
 resources for international studies and
 research.  But, this intention, itself, is
 based upon other convictions about the
 purposes of legislation concerning in-
 ternational education.  Fundamentally,
 we are committed to the study of other
 nations because we believe nations are
 more inclined to cooperate if they know
 and understand each other.  This seems
 like commonsense to me.
 Furthermore, it is appropriate for the
 Federal  Government  of a   prosperous
 Nation to initiate this work among the
 nations by taking the work upon itself
 -on one hand perhaps only to assist the
 development of resources for interna-
 tional study at home; but, on the other,
 also to assist the progress of education
 in the developing nations.
 We believe in this country that our
 citizens should relate to other countries
 from a position of educational strength.
 And we also believe in full opportunity
 for all Americans to acquire the fullest
 possible knowledge of other nations,
 peoples, and cultures.
 More  specifically,  the  International
 Education  Act  of   1966  intends to
 strengthen American    educational  re-
 sources for international study and re-
 search by setting up a grant program un-
 der the authority of the Secretary of
 Health, Education, and Welfare.     Our
 resources in this area would be strength-
 ened in two ways.
 Under section 3 of the act, grants may
 be made to institutions of higher educa-
 tion in order to establish, strengthen, and
 operate graduate centers, which will
 serve as national and international re-
 sources, for research and training in in-
 ternational studies. These graduate cen-
 ters would be free to focus either on spe-
 cific geographic areas, or on particular
 issues in international affairs.
 Under section 4 of this act, grants
 would be made to institutions of higher
 learning to assist them in the planning
 developing and executing of a compre-
 hensive program to strengthen and im-
 prove undergraduate instruction in in-
 ternational studies. The grants would be
 used for a variety of activities, such as:
 facility  planning  of  undergraduate
 courses; training faculty members in a
 foreign country; expanding foreign lan-
 guage courses; working in other fields re-
 lated to international studies; student
 work-study-travel programs; for visiting
 faculty of foreign teachers and scholars.
 The appealing feature about the assist-
 ance given to undergraduate schools is
 the fact that these grants are made both
 in an effort toward equitable distribution
 throughout the States, and with prefer-
 ence given to institutions showing need
 as well  as promise in international
 studies.
 The bill authorizes the Secretary of
 Health, Education, and Welfare to utilize
 other governmental services and facili-
 ties-section 5. No Federal Department
 or employee is in any way authorized to
 exert influence over curriculum, teach-
 ing,  administration, or personnel  of
 the educational institutions receiving
 grants--section 6.
 The bill authorizes the grant program
 for the duration of 5 years-section 7.
 Finally, one section of this bill improves
 title VI of the National Defense Educa-
 tion Act of 1958, as amended, by ex-
 panding the language and area centers'
 program.
 Mr. Speaker, with 4 out of every 10
 of the world's adults unable to read or
 write, with large sections of some coun-
 tries having an illiteracy rate of 98 per-
 cent, a total commitment to the cause
 of universal learning is no doubt our
 most constructive instrument of world
 citizenship.
 The New York Times recently ran an
 outstanding editorial dealing with the
 subject of international education.  I
 quote:
 Domestic educational strength is indivis-
 ible  from success  overseas.   Shortages                                                        of
 highly educated, competent and committed
 manpower at home will continue to jeopard-
 ize the American impact in other lands.
 In his message on international edu-
 cation, President Johnson has reminded
 us of the inescapable connection of
 learning and freedom. He said men pur-
 sued knowledge no matter what the con-
 sequences, that the increase of learning
 was the first work of a nation that wants
 to be free, that is what this bill would
 help bring about.
 It has been said that "education is
 power."
 It is the power to transform.  To
 change. Through such legislation, I feel
 the United States will eventually be able
 to strike a mighty blow against the chains
 which enslave millions around the globe
 in misery, ignorance, and disease.
 HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ACT OF
 1966
 (Mr. GIBBONS (at the request of Mr.
 KREBS)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the REC-
 ORD and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. GIBBONS.  Mr. Speaker, today
 I introduce a bill to establish a National
 Highway Traffic Safety Agency in the
 U.S. Department of Commerce. The pur-
 pose of this legislation is to attack our
 country's mounting highway death rate
 from a national perspective.
 Our distinguished colleague, the gen-
 tleman  from  Georgia,  Congressman
 JAMES A. MACKAY, has taken the lead in
 this fight in the House of Representa-
 tives, as today he introduced legislation
 of this nature. I would like to associate
 myself with the remarks of the gentle-
 man from Georgia [Mr. MACKAY] and
 urge quick action on this legislation, for
 surely it is needed to help stop the ter-
 rible carnage on our highways.
 Mr. Speaker, 1,284 of our fellow Amer-
 icans lost their lives on the Christmas
 and New Year weekends.  No, they did
 not die fighting in South Vietnam. They
 died right here in the United States of
 America on our streets and highways.
 Traffic accidents cost this Nation a
 great price. Last year, it has been esti-
 mated that some 50,000 individuals lost
 their lives on our roads and highways.
 This figure represents a greater number
 of deaths than this country suffered in
 the Korean war and is a substantial per-
 centage of our World War II casualties.
 Besides these shocking figures, total fi-
 nancial loss suffered every year from
 highway accidents of all types runs up
 to $9 billion. That is one-fourth of the
 total expenditures of the United States
 on all forms of education.
 The President of the United States in
 a speech recently before the American
 Trial  Lawyers  Association  said  the
 gravest "problem before this Nation-
 next to the war in Vietnam is the death
 and destruction" from auto accidents.
 The    legislation which I introduce
 today will establish in the Commerce De-
 partment a National Highway Traffic
 Safety Agency and center for research
 into methods of more effectively attack-
 ing this problem which most certainly
 is a national one.
 Through this Agency, national leader-
 ship would be available through joint co-
 operative State and local campaigns and
 the assistance of the American auto in-
 dustry so that drastic cuts can be brought
 about in our staggering highway fatality
 statistics.
 Such an agency in the Commerce De-
 partment would give overall direction
 and assistance to highway safety efforts
 now made by 16 existing Federal agen-
 cies and some 45 private agencies.  It is
 the thought of Congressman MACKAY,
 and I would agree with him, that such
 a  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety
 Agency would be to highway safety much
 as the Federal Aviation Agency is to air
 traffic safety. This makes a lot of sense
 to me.
 This would be no Federal police force.
 This would be a fact-finding, research
 organization which would help our local,
 State, and other governmental bodies in
 the formulation of adequate safety re-
 quirements for automobiles and driving
 standards throughout the country.  I
 agree with Congressman MACKAY that
 this legislation is overdue and needed
 now. I urge its swift consideration by
 this Congress.

 power might well  be justified.  But
 though it is not; without the bounds of
 possibility that the increased use of some
 armed protective force may yet be neces-
 sary, I believe that other measures are
 still available.
 The State Department has worked at
 length to find such a solution but their
 methods of persuasion and  argument
 have often proved unavailing.  The na-
 I,ions concerned---Chile, Ecuador, Peru,
 and now Colombia. have seemed im-
 mune to argument and persuasion.              In
 the absence of firm worldwide law, none
 has been willing to make an agreement
 on the basis of generally accepted prac-
 I.ices.
 The time has come for a consideration
 of methods stronger than mere persua-
 sion, methods that will serve to convince
 every nation that while the United States
 will scrupulously regard the rights of
 others on the high seas, we will insist
 that others give equal regard to our own
 rights.
 The time has come to make it clear
 ;o all nations that we will protect the
 rights  and  freedoms  of  our  citizens
 wherever they may be engaged in law-
 ful activities on the high seas, and that
 this protection will be extended by what-
 wer means that may become necessary.
 If this determination is made known,
 and this resolve becomes clear, it is my
 :cope  that  nations  which  have  been
 harassing our fishing vessels, and na-
 ,ions which might be tempted to do so,
 will instead be inclined to accept our re-
 peated invitation to "come, let us reason
 ;,)gether."  From such reasoning alone
 an come the international agreements
 needed to forestall the strife that may
 sell lie ahead without them.

 THE  CONSTRUCTIVE            TEENAGERS
 (Mr. CRALEY (at the request of Mr.
 I(nEns) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. CRALEY.  Mr. Speaker, we hear
 end read a great deal these days about
 juvenile delinquents, vandalism by teen-
 agers, and other sordid acts by young-
 sters in the Nation.
 Because of the destructive nature of
 such actions, too often little attention is
 given to the constructive acts and accom-
 plishments of the vast majority of the
 t,enagers who are laying the founda-
 tions of their futures as responsible cit-
 isons.
 I; have in my district a very outstand-
 icr  young man who, I believe, epitomizes
 the responsible teenagers.  He is Ronald
 it.. Boggs, of Carlisle, Pa., who was se-
 lected as one of the 14 representatives
 of the 5,600,000 Boy Scouts of America
 who will make the annual "Report to the
 Nation" to President Johnson on Febru-
 ac-y 9 of this year.
 The 14 boys making the report were
 selected on a competitive basis which
 took into account school, church, com-
 munity, and scouting records.
 Ronald is 17 years old and attends
 Carlisle High School where he is on the
 honor roll, a member of weight lifting,
 speech, art, chess, and science clubs.  He
 holds two letters in music and has par-
 ticipated in the Boys Glee Club and                                                                       he
 high school chorus.
 Among the scouting awards he has
 won are the Bronze and Gold Palm Ea ,;le,
 15  Miler  Award,  God  and        Country
 Award, and Order of Arrow.  In addition
 to scouting, he is interested in science
 and has received two science awards, one
 by the Institute of Radio Engineers :,.nd
 another by the institute of Electrical .i nd
 Electronic Engineers.
 I am sure his parents, Col. and Mrs.
 William H. Boggs are very proud of l:irn.
 I  commend  him  for  his  outstanding
 achievements and am most happy to
 have such a well-rounded, outstanding
 young citizen in the 19th District of

 Mr. FLYNT.   Mr. Speaker, today     I
 introduce a House concurrent resolution
 commemorating the Boy Scouts of Amer-
 ica, on the occasion of the 50th anniver-
 sary of the granting of its charter.
 During the 50 years that this organi-
 zation has been in existence, it has fos-
 tered in our youth the highest of ideal;;:
 it has promoted the manly qualities of
 self-reliance, endurance, and physical Ili I-
 ness; and it has developed honesty, it -
 tegrity, and leadership in the youth of
 our Nation.
 I *have been a Boy Scout myself and
 have continued to take an active interest
 in. scouting activities.  Both of my sons
 were also active in scouting work.
 I introduce this resolution to appro-
 priately recognize this memorable year
 because of my belief in the ideals and
 principles for which the Boy Scouts of
 America stands.
 I hope that this resolution will be fav-
 orably considered by the House of Rep-
 resentatives and approved.
 INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION ACT
 OF 1966
 (Mr. GIBBONS (at the request of Mr.
 KREBS)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD  and to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. GIBBONS.    Mr. Speaker, today. I
 introduce a bill to implement provisions
 of the President's message to the Con-
 gress on international education.
 This bill would be the International
 Education Act of 1966.
 I support the President in his call for
 this action because it is consistent with
 the present administration's objectives,
 both for educational citizenship within
 the Nation, and for the Nation's respon-
 sible citizenship within a larger world.
 A world which continues to shrink every
 day.
 We have long been aware of the ira-
 portance of educating the American pub-
 lic for responsible citizenship in our own
 country.   In a  ]L957 speech, our late.
 beloved  President  John  F.  Kennedy,
 whom the people of my city of Tampa
 loved so much, when he was a Member
 of the Senate reaffirmed the positive re-
 lationship which exists between ediie:i-
 tion and public responsibility.
 President Kennedy said every man no
 the street was a citizen.
 Every man was a citizen "who held
 office";  every  citizen  held  office,  as
 Abraham Lincoln had said, by virtue of
 the vote and opinion with which he made
 statutes either possible or impossible to
 execute.
 Moreover, President Kennedy acknowl-
 edged how some citizens were slow and
 shortsighted; but the remedy to provin-
 cial opinions, according to Thomas Jet'-
 ferson, rests not in removing, but in in-
 forming the citizen's "discretion and
 control."
 With  the  demands  of  responsible
 citizenship so clearly unavoidable, than,
 Senator  Kennedy  said  that youn!s
 Americans ought to be educated for
 playing an active and informed role in
 the political affairs of the Nation.
 The President of the United States in
 his February 2 message to the Congress
 and the American people, suggested that.
 we not limit to our own shores our battle
 with ignorance and disease.  This is the
 cause, the world task, he pointed out.
 that we may commit ourselves to by
 passing the International Education Act
 of 1966.
 As a member of the House Education
 and Labor Committee, and as one deeply
 committed to our fight against poverty
 and ignorance at home, I wholehearted],,-
 support President Johnson.
 Mr. Speaker, the bill I introduce to-
 day will help to increase the dimensions
 of American citizenship.  This is my
 hope and my earnest desire.
 The single intention of my bill is to

 It is perhaps important for us to re-
 member that the eagle looks toward
 peace-while having all of the arrows
 of war which he needs at his ready
 disposal.
 Praising the stand taken by this ad-
 ministration, Newsday said that the deci-
 sion of the President "reflects well on the
 system and on the man."  It adds:
 For the President did not merely resume
 a military operation; he put fresh impetus
 into the search for a peaceful conclusion by
 directing  that  the  Vietnam  struggle  be
 brought before the United Nations Security
 Council.
 The newspaper feels that the request
 demonstrates :
 Two fundamentals of our Vietnam policy:
 that we will honor our commitments to pro-
 tect  South  Vietnam from  aggression  and
 that we will seek all means to move the Is-
 sue from the battlefield to the conference
 table.
 I commend this editorial for the pe-
 rusal of my colleagues, and with their
 permission I submit it for the RECORD.
 [From Newsday, Feb. 1, 19661
 THE VIETNAM DECISION
 Seldom has the loneliness of the man in
 the White House been more apparent than in
 the past several weeks.  President Johnson's
 decision to end the 37-day pause in the
 bombing of North Vietnam was subjected to
 the harsh discipline of the Presidency and it
 did not come easily.  Many could advise and
 Inform, but the President, ever conscious of
 his awesome responsibility, had to make the
 final choice himself. We think his decision
 reflects well on the system and on the man.
 For the President did not merely resume a
 military operation; he put fresh impetus into
 the search for a peaceful conclusion by di-
 recting that the Vietnam struggle be brought
 before the United Nations Security Council.
 His  request  demonstrates  anew  President
 Johnson's determination to adhere to the two
 fundamentals of our Vietnam policy; that we
 will honor our commitment to protect South
 Vietnam from aggression and that we will
 seek all means to move the issue from the
 battlefield to the conference table.
 The President has now forcefully and dra-
 matically answered both the foreign and do-
 mestic critics of his Vietnam policy.  Hanoi
 had 37 days to respond favorably to the pause
 in  bombing. But the only response was
 negative, coupled with a demand for total
 victory on Hanoi's own terms.  Moreover, the
 U.S. pause in bombing produced only con-
 tinued  Communist  infiltration,   continued
 terrorism In South Vietnam, continued in-
 sistence  on  terms  utterly  detached    from
 reality and, of course, continued invective.
 The renewed use of air power in the north
 again will be controlled, as it had been, with
 great caxe and aimed only at military targets.
 The resumption serves two purposes, one
 military and the other diplomatic.  The mili-
 tary purpose is obvious.  The bombing will
 attempt to destroy the troops and supplies
 being infiltrated from the north.   The diplo-.
 matic purpose should be just as obvious.  It
 is a warning to Hanoi and Peiping that the
 United States is not prepared to abandon
 South Vietnam to the Vietcong.
 TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL
 The decision to bring the Vietnam im-
 passe to the U.N. Security Council is as sig-
 nificant as the decision to resume bombing.
 During the pause, the quiet diplomacy of
 President Johnson's peace offensive saw six
 envoys visit 34 countries.  The President is
 now bringing his case to the world forum in
 another mode of diplomacy at a moment
 when the pause in bombing and the Presi-
 dent's peace offensive are fresh exhibits be-
 fore the court of world opinion.
 The Security Council, of course, is power-
 less without great power, agreement.  The
 President's initiative in that council, there-
 fore, may not open the door to negotiations.
 But the Security, Council is an organ of the
 organization that has become the diplomatic
 home of the neutral nations.  Pope Paul VI
 has suggested that the neutral nations be
 used to arbitrate the impasse In Vienam.
 And yesterday Secretary of State Rusk said
 the United States would suggest to the Se-
 curity Council the role that neutral nations
 could play in opening the way to the con-
 ference table.  If neutral participation can
 bring about a solution, the U.N. is the arena
 in which to seek it.
 The move to the U.N. Is an expansion of
 the President's peace offensive.  It is another
 demonstration of the desire of the United
 States to substitute diplomacy for military
 action.  The  bombing  Is  a  controlled  re-
 sumption of the air war; the Security Coun-
 cil initiative is an escalation of the peace
 effort.
 We think the decision represents a wise
 mixture.  The President is entitled to the
 full support of all Americans.
 U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE ASIAN
 DEVELOPMENT BANK
 (Mr. HANSEN of Iowa (at the request
 of Mr. KREBS)  was granted permission
 to extend his, remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. HANSEN of Iowa.  Mr. Speaker,
 the request of the President for authority
 for the United States to participate in the
 Asian  Development  Bank  should  be
 greeted with quick approval by the Con-
 gress.
 Under H.R. 12563, our participation is
 authorized with a share of $100 million
 in direct capital and an additional $100
 million In callable shares.  This will be
 20 percent of the bank's total capitaliza-
 tion  of  $1  billion.   Our                                                           contribution
 would equal that given by Japan.+
 This is one" of the most creative pro-
 posals made for the trouble ridden na-
 tions of southeast Asia.  It will make
 possible the building of roads, dams,
 powerplants, harbors, and other facili-
 ties essential to a modern economy. The
 lack of these facilities has been a major
 factor in the poverty and tragedy that
 has made the foment of internal dissen-
 sion possible.
 Just as was the case in the Americas
 a decade or so ago, the nations of south-
 east Asia have come to realize that ade-
 quate fiscal resources are a basic re-
 quirement  for  peace  and  prosperity.
 The ability to transfer these resources
 to areas of great need has also been
 lacking.  Through the Asian Develop-
 ment Bank this mobility can be achieved
 and it will bring greater stability and
 an opportunity to develop the peaceful
 pursuits within the nations of the entire
 region.
 All of us have felt that more should
 be done in Vietnam than assist in re-
 establishing peace. The stability brought
 about by the Asian Development Bank
 will do much to meet the needs of Viet-
 nam.  Further, it will bring about cir-
 cumstances that will assist in stemming
 the spread of Communist ideology. Not
 only will this help Vietnam, but it will
 materially lessen for the United States
 the need for maintaining troop concen-
 trations in Vietnam.
 The need for the Asian Development
 Bank has been demonstrated.  I urge
 my colleagues to give this bill their full
 support.

 THE COST OF HIGHER INTEREST
 RATES
 (Mr. VANIK (at the request of Mr.
 KREBS)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. VANIK.  Mr. Speaker, last week
 President Johnson sent up to Congress
 his economic report, and presently this
 report is receiving thorough and careful
 study by the Joint Economic Committee,
 under the chairmanship of the gentle-
 man from Texas, the Honorable WRIGHT
 PATMAN.
 Our  productive  and  ever  growing
 economy and the effects that the con-
 flict in Vietnam are causing to it, is rea-
 son for intensive study. Our Republican
 colleagues are demanding great cutbacks
 in vital domestic programs so as to off-
 set the budgetary requirements for Viet-
 nam. Yet, next to our national defense
 needs, the item that has grown the most
 in this budget is the amount paid on our
 debt.
 Due to the tighter money policies of
 the Federal Reserve and its decision last
 December to raise the discount rate and
 regulation Q, the cost of borrowing for
 both the public and the Government has
 increased substantially.
 A recent editorial by Bob Cronin in the
 Rural Electric Minuteman, a publication
 of the National Rural Electric Coopera-
 tive Association, discusses the great in-
 creases in our public debt due to higher
 interest rates.  The chairman of our
 Banking and Currency Committee, the
 gentleman from Texas, is quoted in this
 editorial on the Fed's irresponsible action
 and their responsibility for the higher
 costs to the taxpayer.  Perhaps if our
 Republican colleagues would take time
 to study the effects that higher interest
 rates have on our economy, they might
 find that this might be an area to cut
 back increased spending.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask that the editorial
 "The Interest Rate Caper: How It Hap-
 pened" follow my remarks.
 [From the Rural Electric Minuteman,
 Jan. 28, 1966]
 THE INTEREST RATE CAPER: How IT HAPPENED
 Anyone who doubted the effect that last
 December's actions by the Federal Reserve
 Board would have on the Nation's economy
 will be interested in an item contained in
 the  President's  new budget  proposal,  an-
 nounced to Congress this week.
 This is the estimate of an increase of $654
 million in the cost of interest the Federal
 Government must pay in fiscal 1067 on the
 national debt.    The total interest bill will
 therefore jump to nearly $13 billion.
 A number of seasoned Congressmen and
 economists trace the huge increase in interest

 To take the latter first, the idea of toler-
 ance based on mutual respect comes to In-
 dians  quite  naturally.'   From  Budda  to
 Gandhi, the idea of  cooperation and co-
 existence has permeated our ethos and has
 formed a powerful link in forging the unity
 of India.  India too, like the United States,
 is a land of diversity.  It has developed a
 multiracial and multireligious society.  More
 by choice than by compulsion, India, has
 nourished and nurtured through centuries
 a composite culture wherein differing ideas
 and ideologies could live together peacefully.
 It is no wonder, as Arnold Toynbee described,
 that "the Indian missionaries of art Indian
 philosophy, Buddhism, were the first people
 in history to think and feel in terms of
 human race as a whole.  They felt a concern
 for all their fellow human beings; they had
 a vision of mankind as being potentially a
 single family and  they set themselves to
 turn this potential unity into an accom-
 plished fact by peaceful persuasion."
 Wisdom,  not  sword,  was  their  weapon.
 They believed, like  the  Indian  Emperor
 Asoka, in the great principle that "concord
 alone is meritorious." This idea has always
 acted as a beacon to the Indian people.
 Though this concept of unity of humanity
 has been with us almost since the dawn of
 history, it received public acclaim only 20
 years ago.  The Charter of the United Na-
 tions opens with the most significant phr*tse
 "We   the   peoples   of  the  United   Na-
 tions * *       The charter was not a docu-
 ment negotiated by "The high contracting
 parties."  It must be admitted that along
 with the charter, the concept of world com-
 munity gained belated recognition.                                                                                                                                     There
 was in 1945, a great concern that we were
 already too late in dismantling the walls
 that vertically divided the world based. on
 unbridled  and  uncompromising  territorial
 sovereignty.  Before  long, this  oneness of
 humanity became a historic and political
 fact.
 A million factors have made this possible.
 Primarily, science    and  technology  were
 making the nations interdependent and in-
 terconnected irrespective of their political
 attitude.  The liquidation of distance has
 altered the rhythm of life.  Science has bro-
 ken the artificial barriers.                                                                                                                               Art and culture
 have  come to be  common     links between
 peoples and nations.  The isolated existence
 of human groups has become outdated and
 even impossible.  The tools, ideas and media
 of communications available to man have
 generated a historical process that has uni-
 fied the world.
 In many matters of our daily life, there
 is a direct impact of cooperation through in-
 ternational organizations such as the World
 Meteorological Organization, which has es-
 tablished  it  worldwide  weather  reporting
 system; the International  Atomic Energy
 Agency, which oversees the peaceful use of
 atomic energy; the aerial navigation super-
 vised by the International                                                                                                                                 Civil Aviation
 Organization; the frequency allocations of
 broadcasts controlled by the International
 Communication Union;  and the maritime
 regulations instituted by the Inter-Govern-
 mental  Maritime  Consultative  Organiza-
 tion-to mention a few.                                                                                                                                  The United States,
 for example, participates in more than 600
 international conferences annually and has
 nearly 4,300 treaties and agreements to hon-
 or.                                                                                                                           It is, therefore, dangerous and harm-
 ful to seek to split this technologically and
 sociologically  unified  world  into  isolated
 compartments of the past.       As Whyte   (in
 his book "The Next Development of Man")
 put it, "the separation of East and West is

 5. Prices of fresh and canned asparagus
 in grocery stores skyrocketed and substan-

 maximum guidelines of 3.2 percent.   This
 penalized the housewife.  Nevertheless, you
 didn't  hear the  administration   make the

 FREE WORLD-SHIPP1NQ  O NORTH
 VIETNAM
 The SPEAKS            -Hader a previous or-
 der of the House, the gentleman from
 Michigan  [Mr. CHAMBERLAIN]  is recog-
 nized for 30 minutes.
 (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker,
 having followed for some months the
 question of free world shipping to North
 Vietnam and reported from time to time
 to my colleagues, I should like to take
 this opportunity to present a status re-
 port concerning activities during the past
 year.
 In 1965 there were more free world
 ships than Communist ships engaged in
 carrying goods to and from North Viet-
 nam.  Unfortunately, I cannot disclose
 the exact figures of this traffic, because
 they are classified, but I invite any and
 every interested Member to examine
 them closely.  I know there are many
 who are concerned about this phase of
 the war and already have expressed
 themselves this session.
 Before presenting what information I
 can about the nature and extension of
 free world shipping into North Vietnam,
 I am aware that some may justifiably
 wonder why any of this information
 should be classified.  It certainly is no
 secret to Ho Chi Minh. One reason, I am
 told, is that to reveal such data might
 place in jeopardy our own sources of
 information. No one, of course, wishes to
 hamper our intelligence network. How-
 ever, I am satisfied that a great deal more
 of this information can and should be
 made public.  When American boys are
 dying from North Vietnamese bullets,
 the American people have a right to ade-
 quate information about who is aiding
 the enemy. As it stands now, and as it
 stood throughout 1965, the American
 people simply have not been told the
 whole truth about the shocking support
 being given by free world ships to a na-
 tion blatantly engaged in Communist
 aggression and subversion.
 The unclassified data that is made
 available to me by the Department of De-
 fense indicates that while there has been
 some reduction in the volume of this
 trade in 1965 over that of 1964, a dis-
 turbing amount persists.  At this point
 in the RECORD I ask unanimous consent
 to include an itemization by month of
 arrivals of free world ships in North
 Vietnam during 1965.

 HORTON BILL PROVIDES OVERTIME
 PAY FOR POSTAL SUBSTITU'T'ES
 FOR WORK IN EXCESS OF 8 HOURS
 A DAY
 C\/Ir. HORTON cat the request of Mr.
 fl(Jtrcl-IINSON) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD  and  to  include  extraneous
 matter. )
 Mr.     HORTON.  Mr.  Speaker,  last
 September 30, the House of Representa-
 tives passed H.R. 10281, the Government
 Employees Salary Comparability Act of
 1965 by an overwhelming majority, 370
 t,o 7.  It was a good bill. It provided in-
 creased pay for Government workers, in-
 cluding postal workers, and contained a
 number of other provisions beneficial to
 postal workers.
 l,Iost of its provisions were retained
 in the bill after passage by the Senate
 and as it was finally approved by the
 President on October 29, 1965 as Public
 Law 89-301.  But the Senate made one
 change in the House bill which was re-
 tained in the final version as passed and
 which is distinctly unfair and must be
 promptly rectified.
 In the bill as it passed the House, sub-
 stitute employees in the Post Office De-
 partment were entitled to overtime pay
 for work-
 (A) in excess of 8 hours a day or (B) in ex-
 esi of 40 hours a week.
 As the bill passed the Senate and was
 finally approved, the provision for over-
 time for substitute postal employees was
 limited to overtime pay for work in ex-
 ecss of 40 hours a week.  The provision
 'or overtime after 8 hours a day was
 eliminated.
 It, is this latter provision which would
 be restored by the bill I am introducing
 tocay.   It is in the interests of both
 fairness and efficiency that substitute
 employees of the post office should be
 laid overtime not just for work in excess
 of 40 hours a week, but also for any
 work in excess of 8 hours in any one day.
 Regular employees paid on an hourly
 rate already are granted overtime in ex-
 ce: s of 8 hours a day.  In fairness substi-
 tute employees should receive no less.
 It is the substitute employees who are
 called upon in emergencies and often on
 little notice and who, without the pro-
 tection of this bill, can be called upon
 to work. 12 consecutive hours in 1 day
 and again on 2 more days during the
 same week without getting overtime.
 My bill would not only put substitute
 employees on the same footing as regu-
 lar hourly employees.  It would also put
 the Post; Office Department on the same
 basis as industry generally. Our substi-
 tute  mail  carriers   and  other  postal
 workers should not be made to suffer
 a second-class status.  They deserve the
 same consideration as other postal em-
 ployees because of the uncertainties of
 their employment and the long hours
 they are likely to work.
 I therefore urge prompt consideration
 and adoption of my bill.

 cussion in California as to the specific impact
 of the termination of the Mexican national
 or bracero program on the various crops for
 which such  supplemental labor had been     has been set as a maximum.  Hundreds of

 period 1959 to 1964 the number of cases of
 asparagus exported by the United States in-
 creased from 1,007,995 to 2.058,150, and their
 dollar export value increased from $5,785,090
 to $15,571,300.  In 1963 and 1964 U.S. exported
 canned asparagus represented more than 50
 percent of all export vegetable items from the
 United States.  In these same 2 years Cali-
 fornia white asparagus represented approx-
 imately 98 percent of our total U.S. asparagus
 exports (the remaining 2 percent was green
 asparagus).  California white asparagus ex-
 ports from 1960 to 19,64 averaged approxi-
 mately 1.9 million cases.
 Although the specific. Mexican national or
 bracero law expired on December 31, 1964, the
 Secretary of Labor still has authority under
 the general immigration law to issue permits
 for supplemental foreign labor to come into
 this country to assist in harvesting any crop
 where the Secretary makes a determination
 that the supply of domestic labor ready and
 willing to do that type of work is not ade-
 quate and that prevailing wages in the area
 will be paid.  The Secretary has repeatedly
 exercised this authority on behalf of  the
 State of Florida and has allowed many people
 from the West Indies to come into Florida to
 help harvest crops in that State at substan-
 tially lower wages than are paid in California.
 However, he discriminated against California
 by refusing to do the same for our State.
 When he has allowed a few to be admitted,
 they have been too few and too late.
 What happened in California in 1965 be-
 cause of lack of labor willing to harvest as-
 paragus?  The 1965 California white aspara-
 gus pack was reduced to 1,269,000 cases, a
 reduction of 52.7 percent.  This was down
 from 2,659,000 cases in 1964.   The foreign
 trade demand for white asparagus in 1965
 was greater than in any previous year.  As-
 paragus acreage which was originally planned
 for harvest in 1965 was sufficient to more
 than adequately serve this foreign demand.
 :However, when Public Law 78 terminated tin-
 der which braceros could be specifically ad-
 mitted to this country, 16,243 acres of aspara-
 gus was plowed up by farmers who felt that,
 it would he impossible to get adequate labor
 to harvest the crop.  In addition, during the
 year 1965 an estimated 8,423 acres was plowed
 up by farmers who tried but found it im-
 possible to get adequate competent labor to
 harvest the fields.   Unharvested asparagus
 losses were estimated at $6.6 million.  It is
 estimated that if this asparagus could have
 been harvested, at least 50 or 55 percent of
 this lost value would have been paid in wages
 to labor.  Half of our foreign market export
 trade was lost because we could not fill the
 orders.   The productivity of the domestic
 labor used in. the asparagus fields fell off sub-
 stantially, because much of it was not experi-
 enced and some not conscientious.   Wage
 rates in picking asparagus went up substan-
 tially, far in excess of the administration's
 so-called maximum guidelines under which

 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Speaker, as
 the monthly unclassified figures are un-
 doubtedly meant to suggest, some prog-
 ress has been made in reducing this
 trade but unfortunately that success is
 not as marked as the unclassified figures
 would have us believe.  I can tell you
 that the true figure is more than double
 what we are being told;  and that
 amounts, as I said before, to more ar-
 rivals by free world ships than by Com-
 munist ships during 1965.
 NONSTRATEGIC GOODS ARE VITAL
 Just what is the nature of this trade?
 First of all it is true that the great
 majority of these free world ships are
 under charter to Communist countries-
 Communist China, Soviet Union, Ru-
 mania, East Germany, Cuba and others-
 that is these  free  world ships  are
 mostly carrying Communist goods to and
 from   North Vietnam.  Some have
 argued that this somehow removes the
 foul odor about this traffic.  I disagree.
 Any goods or export profits that Ho Chi
 Minh needs badly enough to hire free
 world vessels cannot but help Hanoi's
 overall war effort.  I say we should not
 concede our enemy one extra spool of
 thread.   Considerably  more economic
 pressure can and should be applied to
 Hanoi.
 Similarly, some in our Government
 have offered us the assurance that no
 strategic goods have been carried by any
 of these free world vessels.   Again the
 fragrance of this trade to my way of
 thinking has not been much sweetened.
 First of all, although further informa-
 tion may exist with others in our Gov-
 ernment, the classified reports I receive
 from the Department of Defense indi-
 cate that we do not have complete knowl-
 edge as to the nature of these cargoes.
 Second, even if free world ships carry
 only nonstrategic goods they in effect
 release Communist vessels for the trans-
 portation of more war goods.  The ulti-
 mate effect is the same.  The seaborne
 source of the supply lines into Hanoi and
 down to the South is kept open without
 hindrance.  Did we not recently read
 of members of a crew of a Cuban
 freighter who jumped ship when they
 learned they had been ordered to carry
 weapons from China to North Vietnam
 when previously their ship had been
 engaged in so-called nonstrategic traffic?
 Mr. Speaker, the stubborn fact re-
 mains-North Vietnam is on all-out war
 economy.  Why should free world ships
 contribute in any way to such an econ-
 omy whether by carrying goods to or
 from North Vietnam?  I say so long as
 there is still one free world ship docking
 at Haiphong we should not relent in our
 effort to stop this aid and comfort to the
 enemy.
 SOME PROGRESS NOTED
 As I indicated earlier some progress has
 been made toward drying up the enemy's
 seaborne source of supply.  I was grati-
 fied to learn that a number of govern-
 ments have taken steps to remove their
 flag vessels from this trade.
 However, even though some countries
 have apparently removed their vessels
 from this trade, it does not necessarily
 mean that goods from these countries do
 not find their way to North Vietnam.
 Let us look again at the unclassified in-
 formation concerning data for just 1
 month.  At this point in the RECORD,
 Mr. Speaker, I wish to insert a chart indi-
 cating the origin of cargoes of the five
 free world ships arriving in North Viet-
 nam during December 1965:

 All five of these free world ships were
 under charter to Communist Govern-
 ments.  Four of these ships loaded car-
 goes in free world ports: one in Belgium,
 one in Hong Kong, and two in Japan.  It
 is evident, I submit, that what progress
 has been made in shutting off free world
 assistance to Hanoi, while encouraging,
 is still gravely insufficient.
 There is another glaring instance of
 the need for greater cooperation from
 our friends. Of the 119 free world ship
 arrivals in North Vietnam during 1965,
 67 were vessels registered under the flag
 of the United Kingdom. British officials
 argue that most of these vessels are un-
 der lease to Hong Kong shipping con-
 cerns and that they are powerless to in-
 terfere with this traffic in the absence
 of a formal declaration of war.  How-
 ever correct this explanation may be, it
 clearly does nothing to ameliorate the
 situation. I for one am not satisfied that
 ways could not be found. Obviously the
 British Government has found ways to
 shut off trade with Rhodesia.  For in-
 stance, any British national who carries
 or who supplies certain goods to Rhodesia
 now faces 6 months in prison or a $1,400
 fine or both.  I know of no comparable
 action taken with those trading with
 North Vietnam.  The British should
 hardly need reminding that our own
 Government has given extensive support
 to the embargo on Rhodesia in a number
 of ways.  We now, for instance, require
 special export licenses, which, it is re-
 ported, the Department of Commerce will
 not grant in any case, to carry oil and
 certain other commodities to Rhodesia.
 It is not my purpose to raise the ques-
 tion of the wisdom of our policy toward
 Rhodesia, but I would express the hope
 that in view of what has taken place the
 British Government would reexamine its
 policy of "hands off" British-flag vessels
 trading with North Vietnam.
 CUBAN AND NORTH VIETNAMESE TRADE: A DOUBLE
 STANDARD?
 If the attitude of the British Govern-
 ment leaves something to be desired, so
 does, in my opinion, the attitude of our
 own Government. It has been the policy
 and continues to be the policy of the
 present administration to in effect ex-
 empt ships engaged in North Vietnamese
 trade from the penalties and restrictions
 imposed upon ships which engage in
 Cuban trade.  Why should we be more
 considerate of Ho Chi Minh than Castro?
 My colleagues will no doubt recall the
 partially successful efforts made in the
 last session to prohibit funds under the
 foreign aid program from going to any
 country whose merchant ships trade with
 North Vietnam.  What was sought was
 simply the addition of the words "or to
 North Vietnam" to the already existing
 prohibition concerning those who trade
 with Cuba.  By the narrow margin of 174
 to 164 the administration succeeded in
 weakening this prohibition with regard to
 North Vietnam with a proviso permitting
 the President, if he determines it in the
 national interest, to continue foreign aid
 to countries with flag vessels carrying
 North Vietnamese trade.
 Frankly, I cannot comprehend how it
 would be in our national interest to per-
 mit in any way free world trade with the
 Hanoi regime.  To date I know of no
 communication from the President to the
 Congress indicating that such aid will be
 continued to any nation whose vessels
 continue. to trade with North Vietnam.
 But neither have. we received any indica-
 tion that. any foreign aid funds have been.
 cut off to any such country.
 According to the President's report to
 Congress on the foreign aid assistance

 which appear in the above list of ships

 The figures for fiscal year 1966, I am
 told, are classified.  As I already men-
 w.ioned some of these governments have
 taken steps to withdraw their ships from
 such trade but there are still countries
 who apparently have not.
 The concern of Congress over this
 Lade has not been without its effect.
 ,  recent State Department statement
 revealed:
 in making diplomatic representations, the
 executive branch is mindful of the provi-
 chins of the recerrh amendments to foreign
 assistance  legislation  which  call  for  the
 denial of economic: and military aid to coun-
 tries that do not take appropriate steps to
 remove their ships from the North Vietnam
 trade.  We have notified all affected govern-
 ments of these legislative provisions, and
 hive  continued  to  press  them  to  obtain
 maximum cooperatioin from those very few
 gauntries still having ships in trade.
 The "no trade or no aid" provision en-
 acted last session clearly indicates the
 positive role congressional action has
 played in foreign relations.  The State
 C )epartment's hand was obviously sub-
 stantially strengthened in dealing with
 these countries as a result of Congress
 determination last year.
 NORTH  VIETNAM  TRADERS IN  U.S. PORTS
 Unfortunately there is another way in
 which the policy of the executive branch
 in effect discriminates in favor of trade
 in North Vietnam. On February 6, 1963,
 National Security Action Memorandum
 No. 220 was issued by the National Secu-
 rity Council, which prohibited any vessel
 winch has arrived in Cuba since January
 1, 1963, from carrying U.S. Government-
 financed cargoes from the United States.
 According to Report No. 66 issued by the
 Maritime Administration, 244 free world
 and Polish-flag ships have made a total
 of 1,024 trips to Cuba from January 1,
 1962, through December 13, 1965.  None
 of these 244 ships are permitted to carry
 U.S. Government-financed cargoes out of
 U.S. ports.  Close examination revealed
 that 17 free world vessels which have
 called at North Vietnamese ports in 1965
 appear on this so-called Cuban blacklist
 ,tnd therefore are prohibited from carly-
 itlg U.S. Government-financed cargoes,
 not because of their trade with North
 Vietnam, but because they have also
 called at Cuban ports.  At this point in
 the RECORD, Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
 imous consent to include a chart giving
 the names of these 17 ships.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Is there
 objection to the request of the gentleman
 from Michigan?
 There was no objection.

 AIr, CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker,
 these 17 ships could carry U.S. Govcrn-
 ment-financed cargoes except for the
 fact that they had been in, Cuba.  There
 is in fact an example of a vessel which
 was in North Vietnam on January 25,
 1963, which, under charter to the Gov-
 ernment of India, loaded at Port Arthur,
 Tex:., on July 21, 1965, a food-for-peace
 cargo of 10,210 long tons of wheat bound
 for India as authorized under title I,
 Public Law 480. This vessel, the Greek
 flag ship, Saronis, could not have been
 hired to carry such a cargo had it ever
 been in Cuba in the last 3 years. No one,
 of course, wants to impede the flow of
 food to a hungry people.  This is not
 necessary, but what is necessary, as I view
 it, is that the policy of our Government
 should not be one of awarding public
 business to vessels which have carried
 goods for our enemy.
 J: feel very strongly that we should,
 moreover, prohibit ships which trade
 with North. Vietnam from not only carry-
 ing Government-financed cargoes but
 from doing any business at all in U.S.
 ports.  I have joined in sponsoring legis-
 lation to that effect and I urge my col-
 leagues  to  consider  doing  the  same.
 The reason for this is made plain by the
 fact that this same Greek vessel, Sarorais,
 was again in a U.S. port, Newport News,
 Va., on December 21, 1965, when it sailed
 with a cargo of coal bound for Brazil.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
 that a copy of my bill, H.R. 9946, be
 placed in the RECORD Immediately fol-
 lowing my remarks.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Is there
 objection to the request of the gentle-
 man from Michigan?
 There was no objection.
 The matter referred to is as follows:
 F.I.R. 9946
 A bill to amend the Merchant Marine Act,
 3.920, to prohibit transportation of articles
 to or from the United States aboard cer-
 tain foreign vessels, and for other purposes
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives  of  the  United  States  of
 America in Congress assembled, That sec-
 tion 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920
 (46 U.S.C. 883), is amended by inserting
 "(a)" immediately after "Sec. 27." and by
 adding at the end thereof the following new
 subsections :
 "(b) No article shall be transported  in
 commerce aboard vessels of any foreign ship-
 ping interest which allows vessels owned or
 controlled by such interests to be used, on
 or after the date of enactment of this sub-
 section, in trade with Communist-dominated
 North Vietnam.
 "(c) As used in subsection  (b)  of this
 section, the term `commerce' means com-
 merce between a point in any State or pos-
 session of the United States (including the
 District of Columbia and the Commonwealth
 of Puerto Rico) and any point outside there-
 of or between points in the same State or
 possession  of  the  United States  (includ-
 ing the District of Columbia and the Com-
 monwealth of                                                                                                                                       Puerto Rico)  through    any
 point outside thereof.
 "(d) As used in subsection  (b)  of this
 section, the term 'shipping interest' means
 any individual, company, or group of com-
 panies which has any ownership interest in
 any ship engaged in such trade.
 "(e) As used in. subsection (b)  of this
 section, the term  'controlled' means  con-
 trol of movements of a vessel by virtue of
 ownership  interests;  agency agreements;
 charter hire; or otherwise.
 "(f) Whoever willfully violates subsection
 (b) of this section shall be fined not more
 than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than
 one year, or both.
 "(g) The President shall issue such regu-
 lations as he may deem necessary to carry
 out the provisions of subsection (b) of this
 section."
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker, at
 this point I wish to insert a list of free
 world ships which have called at U.S.
 ports after having been in North Viet-
 nam during 1965.

 February: 7, 1966         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr.  Speaker,
 there appears to be at least two imme-
 diate courses of action open which can
 clearly set the record straight with
 regard to our Government's attitude with
 regard to free world ships in North Viet-
 nam.  First, the executive branch pos-
 sesses the authority to establish a so-
 called black list with respect to North
 Vietnam as now exists with respect to
 Cuban trade.  This, as I pointed out,
 would affect only Government-financed
 cargoes.
 It is worth noting that the require-
 ment was also established that in order
 for a ship to be removed from the so-
 called Cuban "black list," it is necessary
 for its owners to pledge that none of the
 other vessels it controls will engage in
 the future in Cuban trade.  Secondly,
 Congress, I believe should broaden this
 prohibition to include all business in U.S.
 ports both public and private not only
 with respect to specific vessels which
 have been in North Vietnamese parts but
 with respect to the vessels of any ship-
 ping interest which allows any one of
 its ships to profit from trade with the
 Hanoi regime.
 These two courses of action may not
 be sufficient to completely put a stop to
 free world 'traffic in North Vietnam.
 Other steps may be necessary such as the
 mining or blockading of the harbors.
 Nevertheless these two courses of action
 would serve to make clear what in the
 past has been unclear; to give Ho Chi
 Minh unequivocal notice of our determi-
 nation not to support or tolerate in any
 fashion any form of free world assist-
 ance which contributes to his policy of
 aggression and subversion.
 In the face of the totally negative re-
 sponse to recent efforts to bring the con-
 flict to the conference table, we can only
 surmise that the Hanoi regime continues
 to believe that the United States will
 eventually grow weary under the condi-
 tions of a long, limited struggle; and
 that a Communist victory in South" Viet-
 nam is possible.
 It seems to me that by failing to elimi-
 nate all forms of aid and comfort from
 the free world to North Vietnam we have
 presented to Ho Chi Minh an obviously
 contradictory position which, I believe,
 can and has contributed to Hanoi's rapid
 escalation of the war in the expectation
 of total victory. Until our Government
 takes a clearer public stand with regard
 to such free world assistance, our efforts
 to convince the Hanoi regime of Ameri-
 can determination to resist the spread of
 communism cannot help but be damaged.
 Mr. HOSMER.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr.  CHAMBERLAIN.  Yes, I yield
 briefly to the gentleman from California.
 Mr. HOSMER.  Mr. Speaker, on this
 classification question I just wonder why
 the North Vietnamese know what ships
 are going to Haiphong, I wonder why the
 Chinese know what ships are going to
 Haiphong, and I wonder why the Soviet
 Union knows what ships are going to
 Haiphong and why the American people
 should not know what ships are going
 into Haiphong.
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  I cannot an-
 swer the gentleman's question, but I ap-
 preciate him raising it again.  I men-
 tioned earlier in my remarks that I saw
 no reason for this classification and that
 the administration is not telling the citi-
 zens of our country the whole truth.  I
 believe it is well that this information
 should be made available. _ I appreciate
 the gentleman underscoring my point.
 Mr. CONTE.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  I am happy to
 yield to my distinguished colleague from
 Massachusetts.
 Mr. CONTE.  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to take this opportunity to congratu-
 late my colleague from Michigan for his
 concise and very objective presentation
 here today on a very serious matter.  I
 have joined with him several years now
 in an effort to prevent foreign aid to our
 allies who are shipping goods and using
 their ships to bring goods to North Viet-
 nam.  I cannot understand for the life
 of me how countries like the United
 Kingdom, which I understand from the
 gentleman's presentation here today is
 one of the biggest users of their ships to
 bring goods Into North Vietnam, can con-
 tinue doing this In view of the fact that
 we have been such great friends of the
 United Kingdom.
 We were the first country to come to
 their aid when they ran into difficulty
 with Rhodesia.  We immediately broke
 off relationships with Rhodesia. We im-
 mediately stopped brings goods into
 Rhodesia because of the difficulties that
 the United Kingdom was having there.
 I cannot understand for the life of me
 why a country like Greece continues to
 bring goods into North Vietnam.  If it
 was not for the Truman plan and our
 foreign aid, Greece would have fallen into
 Communist hands many years ago.
 We have been a great ally of the
 Greeks down through the years.  We
 have helped them tremendously with bil-
 lions of dollars of foreign aid. 'Yet they
 persist in bringing goods into North Viet-
 nam, knowing that these goods will be
 used against our soldiers over there in
 the conflict at the present time.
 I think that the gentleman's crusade
 and the arguments that he has presented
 here on the floor, time and time again,
 have done much to stop many of these
 countries from continuing this practice.
 I am pleased to report to him the evi-
 dence, as it has been brought before my
 committee, indicates that the Greek
 Government is presenting a bill before
 its Parliament to pass a resolution to
 stop the ships from going to North Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. I would like to
 thank the gentleman for his ? generous
 remarks, and I would also like to take
 this occasion to acknowledge the invalu-
 able assistance that he has been during
 this past year in helping to amend the
 foreign aid bill, to put some limitations
 on this problem, some teeth into it.
 This is something that is going to re-
 quire the combined effort of all of us
 here on both sides of the aisle, and my
 colleague from Massachusetts has been
 an invaluable: help.  I look forward to
 his assistance in the future.
 Mr. CONTE.  I thank" the gentleman
 very much.
 THE SERIOUS JOHNSON-McNAMARA
 MISCALCULATION   CONCERNING
 NORTH VIETNAMESE AIR STRIKE
 TARGETS  AND  WHAT  TO  DO
 ABOUT IT
 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MrN-
 Islr).  Under a previous order of the
 House, the gentleman from California
 [Mr. HosMair], is recognized for 25 min-
 utes.
 Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, last Mon-
 day I mentioned to the House two signifi-
 cant failures in the management of the
 war.  These were: First, the failure of
 our bombing of North Vietnamese tar-
 gets during the period from February
 through most of December 1965, to ac-
 complish either the objective of slowing
 down infiltration of North Vietnamese
 military units to the south, or the objec-
 tive of raising to Hanoi the price for its
 aggressions to an amount it is unwilling
 to pay for continuing them; and second,
 the failure of the 5 week and 2 day bomb-
 ing respite to lure Ho Chi Minh anywhere
 near a negotiating table.
 The responsibility for these failures
 cannot be placed on U.S. military com-
 manders. They are not running the war.
 It is being run by civilians in Washing-
 ton, principally President Johnson and
 Secretary McNamara and their semi-
 anonymous advisers, most of whom also
 are civilians untrained to run a war.
 Air action over North Vietnam now has
 resumed. It is the duty of these people
 frankly to admit that their past choice
 of ammunition-TNT bombs-and severe
 limitation on targets just did not pro-
 duce appreciable results.  These Wash-
 ington war managers seriously miscalcu-
 lated. They should not perpetuate their
 mistake.  It is likely only to bring re-
 newed frustration. Instead they should
 give intelligent thought to the discovery
 of what additional or alternate targets
 could be more meaningful to the North
 Vietnamese and apply some creative
 imagination to determine what ammuni-
 tion will best damage them. Last Mon-
 day I predicted that "both the targets
 and the ammunition may turn out to be
 quite unconventional."
 The prediction was based on the fact
 that North Vietnam is a backward, un-
 derdeveloped country with a primitive
 "rice and fish" economy.  Unlike the
 Germany of World War II it cannot be
 bombed to submission by blowing to
 fragments a complex, highly integrated
 industrial economy.  Those who place
 so much stress on "bombing Hanoi and
 Haiphong to win the war" largely fail
 to see this distinction. Similarly, North
 Vietnam's transportation is so primitive
 it is little wonder that despite United
 States bombing of roads and rails the
 infiltration rate of men and supplies
 from north to  south has increased
 manyfold.  Bomb damage easily had
 been sidestepped by a simple switch in
 North Vietnamese freightloading prac-
 tices-from wheels to the backs of men.
 My prediction of unconventional tar-
 gets and unconventional ammunition
 also was based on the fact that "the cul-
 tural level of North Vietnam is undoubt-
 edly one - of  the lowest imaginable.
 Eighty percent of the population is il-.

 literate, ignorant to an incredible degree,
 and subject to the most extraordinary
 superstitions."--Statement in 1962 by
 tine leftist French historian Gerard Ton-
 gas who lived many years in Hanoi until
 1960.  Some rather interesting and pos-
 sibly very effective alternatives to our
 present kind of air strikes in the north
 open up if we recognize it as "a land
 where gods, devils, and animistic spirits
 of  inanimate  objects  are  subliminal
 neighbors during daylight and lurk al-
 most tangibly among the darker patches
 of  night"-American     Security  Coun-
 cil             Washington  Report,  August     31,
 t ii65.  These alternatives-which   ob-
 viously fall into the category of psycho-
 logical warfare----involve no killing, no
 maiming, no physical destruction.    In
 terms of violence they will deescalate
 rather than escalate the war.  But in
 terms  of  results  they  well may  be
 decisive.
 Raising the price to Hanoi for contin-
 uing its aggressions to the prohibitive
 level by psywar tactics requires actions
 to create enough misery, anxiety, wretch-
 edness and distress in the minds of the
 North Vietnamese people to induce an
 intense general annoyance with the war.
 Even a Communist dictatorship cannot
 long pursue policies so unpopular they
 bring into being sweeping national dis-
 organization, disturbance, and discon-
 tent.  Considering the cultural level of
 the population and its fearful awe of
 superstitious omens, the task of depop-
 ularizing Ho Chi Minh's policy of aggres-
 hon should be well within the capability
 of American ingenuity.
 The few examples of many possible
 actions along these lines which I am
 about to cite are for illustrative purposes
 and need not be taken as specific recom-
 mendations before they are determined
 to meet all the requirements of psycho-
 logical  warfare  operations.  They  are
 based on a study of North Vietnamese
 customs and superstitions made for me
 by the Library of Congress.
 Example: North Vietnam's Red River
 Delta is the nation's rice bowl. Flooding
 is controlled by damming upstream and
 subsequent release of water to rice pad-
 dies.  Bombing the dams has been re-
 jected because a flood would drown thou-
 sands and many more would perish later
 by starvation from loss of the rice crop.
 As a nonexplosive alternative many tons
 of harmless soluble dye might be dropped
 upstream.  A single B-52 is capable of
 delivering in excess of 27 tons of dye.
 Consider adding  an ingredient  which
 also is harmless but creates an obnox-
 iously offensive odor.  The dye and the
 odor will be picked up by the growing
 rice.
 North Vietnamese eat rice every day
 .0. every meal.  The need to eat this kind
 of unsightly, unappetizing but harmless
 and nutritious mess day after day after
 clay could become a dear price to pay for
 llanoi's transgressions.  It also will de-
 prive the North of its principal export
 commodity helping to pay the cost of the
 war.
 During their campaigns in East Java
 in 1946 and 1947 the Dutch dropped
 harmless soluble dyes in rice paddies.  It
 caused panic among the native people
 who believed it to be a manifestation. of
 divine wrath.  Effort should be made to
 assure that a portion of the country's
 rice crop remains normal.  This will gen-
 erate black market woes and instant hos-
 tility toward any government official who
 attempts to allocate palatable rice, or to
 collect it for export.
 Example: Along with their superstiti-
 ous nature the people of Vietnam, North
 and South, have a long, deep-rooted dis-
 like for the Chinese.  These facts of
 their life should be exploited to the full-
 est, for instance:
 To an oriental there is nothing lower
 than a running dog.  Cheap plastic i,oy
 models of Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse-
 tung joined in the shape of running dogs
 could be airdropped in large quantity.
 in Vietnam the ace of spades is con-
 sidered as deadly an omen as it is in
 Sicily.  Hundreds of thousands of plas-
 tic ace of spades playing cards could be
 dropped throughout the country.  Pic-
 Lures of the two above-mentioned cal-
 prits might also be added. to the cards.
 Seeing a woman on first leaving one's
 dwelling in the morning is a certain sign
 in Vietnam the day will be one of mis-
 fortune, therefore rain plastic model, of
 women from the sky during the night: to
 be found as a morning greeting.
 On hearing an owl cry "thrice in  he
 night" North Vietnamese flatly expect
 death in the immediate family.  The rx-
 peri.ence generally results in the strong-
 est                                                         sense  of  dread.  Cheap  air   drop
 devices which simulate three hoots of in
 owl should. be easy to design.
 Except for the owl device all bad-luck
 air drop items should be constructed to
 make a distinctive, audible sound as they
 fall through the air to add the distress
 of an advance harbinger that bad luck
 is on its way. The use of plastic for ti. se
 objectionable symbols rather than paper
 is cesirable because they are just that
 much harder to get rid of. Air dropr of
 good-luck symbols bearing identified on
 with the Republic of` South Vietnam
 should occasionally be made both for the
 obvious reason and because they might
 induce a Pavlovian reaction.  It is to be
 recalled that the Russian psychologist,
 Pavlov, induced in dogs a state of total
 disorganization by alternating acts of ill-
 usage and kindness.                                                                   Although airdrop
 items only have been used as illustrations
 here, radio and all other media, of cou:?se,
 play a role in the conduct of psychologi-
 cal. war.
 Cutting down the infiltration rate 4, ]so
 should be examined in terms of the .ex-
 amples just given.  The routes w,ed,
 loosely described as the Ho Chi Minh
 Trail, have their beginnings in North
 Vietnam, traverse several areas of Laos
 and. Cambodia and have multiple en-
 trance points into South Vietnam.  Much
 of the trail is screened by dense tropical
 forests making ground movement very
 difficult to detect. A high proportion of
 the bombs we drop along it blow up trees
 and bushes instead of Vietcong and their
 supplies. It is clear that the more super-
 stitious dread we can cause the enemy to
 associate with this communication line,
 the more difficult will be his progress
 along it.
 Example: On hillsides visible while
 marching southward defoliate the shape
 of the unlucky ace of spades.
 Example :  Skywrite  this  and  other
 omens of misfortune and death when
 Vietcong are estimated to be in loca-
 tions where they will see them.
 Example: Spike the Ho Chi Minh trail
 with various devices emitting sounds,
 odors, or other manifestations of doom,
 death, or displeasure on the part of the
 spirit world with the goings on.  Sowing
 by air of chemically treated seeds which
 grow rapidly into bizarre and ominous
 plant forms should be investigated.
 In closing I have a few words for so-
 called defense intellectuals and assorted
 sophisticates who will deride and ridicule
 these suggestions.  In war it is as dan-
 gerous to overestimate your enemy as it
 is to underestimate him.  If we are go-
 ing to continue these air operations over
 North Vietnam which are costly in air-
 men's lives and aircraft, then we had
 better take another tack and start get-
 ting some effectiveness out of them more
 equivalent to their cost.  This is not a
 conventional war; it is an unconven-
 tional war.  Some, but not all, of the
 strategy and tactics of conventional war
 can be adapted to unconventional war.
 Primarily, an unconventional war re-
 quires unconventional strategy and tac-
 tics. Psychological warfare is as old as
 mankind: the assault on the mind is as
 ancient as the roared battle cry, as his-
 torically familiar as the rebel yell, and as
 modern as the sophisticated techniques
 of World War II.  Its possibilities today
 are manifold for defeating war of libera-
 tion strategy and. guerrilla tactics.
 Lastly, I have a word for the wiseacres
 who think they are being cute by shoot-
 ing supposedly funny wisecracks from the
 hip whenever their pseudointellectualism
 is exposed to an idea they are incapable
 of understanding and comprehending.
 Let them recall that the Vietnam roll of
 dead  and  main:.ed Americans grows
 longer every day.  Instead of trying to
 be funny, they should themselves be try-
 ing to figure out ways to speed the war's
 successful conclusion.  And, in the un-
 likely event they :happen to come up with
 an idea, even if it is an unconventional
 one, they should have the guts to get up
 and suggest it.
 PROBE FEDERAL JUDICIARY
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous orders of the House, the gentle-
 man from Iowa [Mr. GROSS]  is recog-
 nized for 15 minutes.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, the efforts
 of the courts to oust Federal Judge
 Stephen Chandler, of Oklahoma, raises
 serious questions that should be the sub-
 ject of an immediate congressional in-
 vestigation.  In the first place, this is
 clearly an invasion of the rights of the
 Congress, for it is only the Congress that
 has the constitutional authority to re-
 move a Federal judge by impeachment.
 If Judge Chandler is to be impeached,
 it should be done by the Congress, and
 only after a full investigation of all the
 facts surrounding the action by the cir-
 cuit court of appeals.  I believe that this
 is particularly important in the light of

 nedy to testify under oath, refused to
 state that he had seen the assault with
 the knife, although standing within 3
 feet of the scene. Mr. Kennedy states
 that he is convinced that this witness
 is guilty of outright perjury.  The vic-
 tim of the assault was so mistreated and
 threatened by friends of Jones that he
 has now resigned from the Job Corps
 and has left the State of Idaho.
 Jones was recently brought before the
 Third District Court in Boise for sen-
 tencing, at which time Job Corps' offi-
 cials and his lawyer, Mr. Rowett, also
 appeared.  The  district  judge,  Hon.
 J. Ray Durtschi, withheld sentence on
 Jones and placed him on. probation for
 2 years, with the condition that he serve
 4 months in jail, and then return to the
 Job Corps.   A further condition was
 that he receive psychiatric treatment.
 I am sure I reflect the consensus of
 the group in stating that the concept
 of the Job Corps and the philosophy
 which led to its establishment is laud-
 able in every respect.  Such provides an
 opportunity for underprivileged youth
 to be trained for work and obtain neces-
 sary education.  We think it is obvious
 that a group of young people in the 16-
 to 21-age bracket, most of whom are
 lacking in education and in the oppor-
 tunity to compete in our society, are per-
 haps the most highly impressionable
 group of persons who could be assem-
 bled.  Many of them have already had
 minor brushes with the law.  I cannot
 think of a greater tragedy than having
 such a group of young people exposed
 to what is obviously a vicious and men-
 tally disturbed person.  To compound
 the problem, such a person was placed
 in a position of authority and responsi-
 bility over these same highly impres-
 sionable corpsmen.
 We feel from this incident can be
 drawn the obvious conclusion that the
 screening process of the Job Corps is at
 times, at least, a complete failure.  We
 are informed that the officials at the lo-
 cal Job Corps camp are unable to, or have
 not determined how many, if any, of
 their corpsmen are on a present active
 status of parole or probation from other
 States.  The State board of corrections
 is reasonably positive that such situa-
 tions exist and in conformance with the
 interstate compact, are desirous of being
 informed of the existence of parolees
 and probationers from other States who
 are presently residing within Idaho. We
 feel this is particularly necessary since
 we are informed that the Job Corps has
 no interest in the supervision of parolees
 or probationers.
 We also feel it pertinent to point out
 that the officials of the State of Idaho
 concerned with supervising probationers
 and parolees have had very fine coopera-
 tion with the armed services regarding
 such supervisory problems.
 It is also the consensus of the group
 that thet basic concept of the Job Corps,
 as announced to the public at large, was
 not to provide rehabilitation institutions
 for criminals. The public acceptance of
 the Job Corps locations was, we felt,
 based on the asserted purpose of the Job
 Corps as providing training and educa-
 tion for underprivileged young people
 who deserved an opportunity.
 From my own personal standpoint, and
 while I may not reflect the consensus of
 the group, I must state that I am highly
 shocked and indignant at the use of Fed-
 eral moneys to furnish legal counsel, bail,
 psychiatric evaluation and treatment,
 and so forth, to an accused, regardless of
 whether he be a Federal employee, State
 employee, or whatever.
 As you know, our system of criminal
 justice in the State of Idaho, for many
 years has required the appointment of
 legal counsel for indigent defendants and
 the reports of our supreme court are
 replete with opinions stating that the
 failure to fully and fairly advise an ac-
 cused of his right to legal counsel, and to
 furnish such counsel, constitutes the de-
 prival of constitutional rights.  I se-
 riously question the existence of any
 statutory authorization for such expendi-
 ture of Federal funds.  Such certainly
 has never been the case in regard to
 armed services personnel and I can see
 no difference between the furnishing of
 counsel to a Job Corpsman, Federal em-
 ployee, and the furnishing of legal coun-
 sel to a mailman, a U.S. attorney, an ele-
 vator operator in a post office building,
 or a U.S. Senator, any one of whom could
 be charged with murder or an attempted
 murder.
 We sincerely believe that these matters
 demand your attention and investiga-
 tion, if the Job Corps is to continue to
 have the public confidence and carry out
 the very laudable program for which it
 was designed.
 I should add that Mr. Kennedy, some
 time ago, wrote to the Director of the
 program, Mr. Sargent Shriver, relative
 to the problems discussed herein, and has
 not, as yet, received the courtesy of a
 reply.
 DIFFICULTIES WITH THE JOB
 CORPS PROGRAM
 (Mr. QUIE asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr.,QUIE.            Mr. Speaker, the obvious
 result of this case is that enrollees at
 Mountain Home Job Corps camp believe
 the law of the jungle prevails and that
 even officials of the U.S. Government
 countenance  assault  with  a  deadly
 weapon.
 Job Corps officials should be called to
 account for this episode.  Do they be-
 lieve they are teaching the young men at
 the Mountain Home camp constructive
 values by their actions in this case?
 What justification do they have for hir-
 ing an attorney with Federal taxpayers'
 money, especially when Idaho law re-
 quires that indigent defendants be fur-
 nished counsel by the State?  Why do
 Job Corps officials want Jones back in
 the Job Corps under these circum-
 stances?  Do they plan to put him back
 in a position of leadership and authority
 over his fellow job corpsmen?
 FAULTY PHILOSOPHY
 This, case, in capsule, demonstrates
 two damaging and dangerous things
 about the way the Job Corps program is
 now being administered.
 First, the screening of enrollees is so
 incredibly haphazard that officials don't
 even know when enrollees are on parole
 for commission of major felonies.
 Second, the philosophy of Job Corps
 officials is so ridiculously soft and con-
 fused that they will excuse almost any
 behavior by an enrollee, even when it
 jeopardizes the chance of other enrollees
 to succeed.
 The case of 'Paul Dennis Jones in
 Idaho is not an isolated one.  It is typi-
 cal of official policy in the Job Corps.
 This kind of approach in handling tough
 young men who have committed serious
 crimes permeates the entire administra-
 tion of Job Corps camps.  It can be fatal
 to the program unless it is reversed by
 direct and immediate action.
 GANG RULE
 Two dropouts from Camp Kilmer re-
 cently declared that they would not have
 enrolled in the Job Corps if they had
 known what it was like.  One of them
 commented "Many youths sent to court
 for a minor crime were given a choice
 between the Job Corps and reform
 school."  A common statement among
 enrollees is, "If I go back, the Judge will
 put me in jail."  Another enrollee said,
 "The dormitories are ruled by gangs."
 Is it any wonder that Job Corps dor-
 mitories are often ruled by gangs when
 authorities deal so foolishly with felony
 crimes?  Job Corps policy provides spe-
 cifically :
 No dismissals from Job Corps can be made
 by centers without getting prior approval
 from Job Corps headquarters * * *.  Under
 no circumstances, explicit or implicit, should
 a resignation be asked for or the opportunity
 to resign offered.
 REALISM NEEDED
 The Job Corps concept is sound, but it
 cannot be administered successfully by
 administrators who coddle and encour-
 age lawbreakers and gang leaders.  Un-
 less we start getting some realism into
 the Job Corps program, the American
 people will rise in indignation and prob-
 ably sweep out the good potential with
 the bad performance.  That would be
 tragic for the many youngsters who can
 be helped by a good Job Corps program,
 as well as for our society as a whole.

 Lion opposed these proposals, we were
 able in 1963 to add such a provision to
 the Vocational Education Act. The proj-
 ects were never funded by the admin-
 istration.
 The 1964 Poverty Act launched us on
 a mass production of Job Corps camps
 without the benefit of experience.  The
 present philosophy of Job Corps admin-
 istrators is endangering the entire Job
 Corps approach, which can and should
 help many youngsters help themselves.
 The following case history forcefully il-
 lustrates our point:
 MSSrORANDUM ON Mov'r AIN HOME, IDAnO
 On November 15, 1965, a vicious fight took
 place in a dormitory at the Mountain Home
 Job Corps camp.  A corpsman was brutally
 beaten by Paul Dennis Jones, a fellow corps-
 man, for playing a radio in the dormitory.
 With his victim prone, Jones slashed his face
 and lands with a knife and then plunged the
 knife into his abdomen.
 lip to this point, the story seems like one
 of those unfortunate incidents that can hap-
 pen occasionally when you put rough, hard-
 core young men together in a camp.  The
 full sequence of events, however, is appalling
 and incredible.  They can be summarized in
 the following 10 points:
 1. Jones, the assailant, was what is known
 in the trade as a three-time loser.  He had
 three felony convictions against him, plus a
 parola violation, when admitted to the camp.
 2. Job Corps officials violated the inter-
 state compact on parole and probations by
 failing to notify Idaho authorities that Jones
 was a parolee from California.  Not only that,
 in response to a request from Idaho authori-
 ties, officials at the Mountain Home camp are
 unable to determine, or have refused to de-
 termine, how many of their corpsmen are
 presently on parole or probation from other
 Stastes.
 ii.  Jones not only was it three-time felony
 loner, he was serving in a supervisory ca-
 pacity in the Mountain Home camp as a
 dormitory  leader,  wing;  leader  and  squad
 leader.
 4. The Job Corps paid for an attorney, bail,
 and psychiatric treatment for Jones.
 The Job Corps, by telegram from Wash-
 in tan, asked the court, to release Jones on
 probru.tion, without punishment, on the as-
 surar.ce he would be accepted back at camp.
 G. 9fter release from the hospital, the vic-
 t.icn was so mistreated and threatened by
 --Jones' friends at the Mountain Home camp
 that he was forced to resign from the Job
 Corp:,.
 Job  Corps  officials  refused  to sign  a
 erirninal complaint  against Jones and re-
 fusec. to cooperate with the local prosecut-
 ing attorney, Mr. Fred Kennedy.
 11    The prosecuting attorney had to sub-
 pena other corpsmen in order to get them to
 testify and at least one of the eye witnesses
 to  the assault,  standing 3  feet  from the
 ;:roue, said he saw nothing.  The prosecuting
 attorney is convinced that this witness is
 guilty of outright perjury, but once again
 Job Corps officials refused to cooperate or
 tako action to assist the prosecution.
 9. The U.S. attorney, Mr. Sylvan Jeppesen,
 f,7i+, prosecuting attorney. the warden of the
 fdah:) State Penitentiary, Mr. L. E. Clapp; the
 vice chairman of the Idaho Board of Cor-
 secti,sn, Mr. Marls Maxwell; an Idaho parole
 and probation officer, Mr. Al Roark; an official
 of the Idaho Employment Security Agency,
 NTr. Bill Lesh; and the Idaho attorney gen-
 eral, Mr. Allen Shepard were so incensed by
 the handling of this case by Job Corps of-
 ficials that they met jointly and determined
 to baing the matter to the attention of Mr.
 Shriller and  other officials  in Washingon.
 The prosecuting attorney wrote Mr. Shriver
 in December and, at least until recently, had
 not even received the courtesy of a routine
 reply.
 10. On the pleading of the Job Corps of-
 ficials. the district judge withheld sentence
 on Jones and placed him on probation for 2
 years with  the  conditon  that he serve 4
 months In jail and then return to the Job
 Corps.
 Mr.  Speaker.,  this memorandum  is
 written at the combined suggestions of
 certain persons who attended a meeting
 recently in the office of Mr. Sylvan Jep-
 pesen, ' U.S.  attorney.   In                                                      attendance
 were Mr.. Fred Kennedy, prosecuting at-
 torney for Elmore County, Mr. L. E.
 Clapp, warden of the Idaho State Pen-
 itentiary, Mr. Mark Maxwell, vice chair-
 man of the board of corrections, Mr. Al
 Roark, :parole  and probation officer,
 Mr. Bill Lesh of the employment security
 agency, Mr. Allen G. Shepard, attorney
 general of the State of Idaho, and his two
 assistants.
 Mr. Jeppesen stated that he had been
 requested by Senator CHURCH to attend
 said meeting, which was called primarily
 at the instance of Mr. Kennedy and Mr.
 Clapp.
 The discussion involved a recent crim-
 inal incident at the Job Corps camp at
 Mountain Home, Idaho.  It was the con-
 census of those present at the meeting
 that the entire congressional delegation
 should be informed both as to the cir-
 cumstances and the  thinking of the
 group regarding corrective action which
 should be taken.
 On or about November 15, 1965, a
 vicious fight took place in one of the
 dormitories of the Job Corps camp at
 Mountain Home.  Said assault allegedly
 took place as a result of Truley Tillman,
 a corpsman, playing a radio in a man-
 ner disturbing to the other occupants
 of the dormitory. The dormitory leader,
 one  Paul Dennis Jones, brutally beat
 Truley'I'illman about the head and face.
 While sitting astride the prone body of
 Tillman, Jones produced a knife and
 slashed Tillman about the :face and
 hands, and then plunged the knife into
 the  abdomen of Tillman inflicting  a
 wound of approximately 2172  inches in
 depth.
 The matter was reported almost im-
 mediately                                                              to Mr. Kennedy  as  county
 prosecutor.  Because of the question of
 Federal enclave, the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation had been called. An FBI
 investigator was dispatched to the scene
 that night, interrogated Jones and ob-
 tained from him a statement admiting
 participation in the assaalt.  Mr. Ken-
 nedy was approached that night by of-
 ficials of the Job Corps, who attempted
 to convince Mr. Kennedy that there
 should be no criminal proceedings filed
 against Jones and he should be released
 to the Corps for administrative action.
 No person in the Job Corps camp, either
 corpsmen or  official,  would  sign  the
 criminal complaint against Jones for as-
 sault with a deadly weapon, and Mr.
 Kennedy was, therefore, required to sign
 the complaint himself.
 It was necessary to issue subpenas
 and require attendance of Job Corps
 witnesses in court.  The Job Corps of-
 ficials, through their Washington, D.C.,
 office, hired Mr. Robert Rowett, an at-
 torney at Mountain Home, to represent
 the accused at Federal expense.
 At the hearing held therein, Jones en-
 tered a plea of guilty to assault with a
 deadly weapon, and as is usual in such
 cases, the district judge deferred im-
 posing sentence pending presentence in-
 vestigation.
 At the hearing for sentencing, officials
 from the Job Corps camp were present.
 A telegram from the Job Corps head-
 quarters in Washington, D.C., was sub-
 mitted to the court, which requested that
 the judge place Jones on probation and
 affirmatively stated that if said Jones
 were placed on probation by the court
 lie would be accepted by the Job Corps
 and returned to the Job Corps camp.
 In the course of the presentence in-
 vestigation, it was determined that Jones
 is a three-time loser on felony charges,
 having been convicted and served sen-
 tences in California State correctional
 institutions.  The  criminal  record  of
 Jones can be summarized as follows:
 At the age of 16, he attempted to kill
 two persons by firing nine shots from a
 revolver.  He was admitted to the Cali-
 fornia Fort Springs Boy's Camp.                                                                                                                 In
 1962, he was convicted of auto theft and
 received a jail sentence and 3 years' pro-
 bation.  Later in 1962, he was convicted
 of auto theft and sentenced to an addi-
 tional 2 years' probation.  In 1963, he
 was adjudged a parole violator, con-
 victed of another auto theft and sen-
 tenced to the Soledad Correctional Insti-
 tution.  In 1964, he was paroled and on
 September 8, 1965, was arrested for driv-
 ing with a revoked or suspended driver's
 license, and served a total of 25 days in
 jail.
 At the time of his induction into the
 Job Corps, he was, and still remains, a
 parolee of the California correctional
 system.  Idaho, as are all States, is a
 member of the interstate compact on
 parole and probations.  Under the terms
 of  said compact,  each  State  agrees
 that it will not permit one of its parolees
 or  probationers  to  move to  another
 State's jurisdiction without, in advance,
 informing the receiving State of such
 desire and making arrangements for the
 supervision of such parolee or proba-
 tioner by the receiving State during the
 balance of parolee or probationer's time.
 No such notification was received by the
 State of Idaho, or its, board of correc-
 tions from either the State of California
 or the Job Corps.  We were informed
 that said Jones, while at the Job Corps
 camp, was made a supervisor of other
 corpsmen in three capacities; dormitory
 leader, wing leader, and squad leader
 which would indicate he had rather close
 supervision of other corpsmen.
 Mr. Kennedy has further stated that
 lie has received practically no coopera-
 tion from fellow Job Corpsmen witnesses
 in investigating or processing the defend-
 ant for what is obviously a serious crime
 in the felony category.  This, in spite
 of the fact that the defendant was a
 three-time convicted felon and but for
 extremely fortunate circumstances, his
 latest victim would have died.

 another corpsman, called by Mr. Keni-

 the Chief of Personnel-but is now for-
 gotten in a computer age.  Admittedly,
 I slipped in a remark about lack of such
 coordination, referral to, or acceptance
 of advice of the Chiefs of Technical Serv-
 ices, whether :it was in matters of supply
 taken over by the computers of DSA-
 Defense Supply Agency-or class 2 con-
 trol-command and professional assign-
 ment of people by the Surgeons General
 in all services, at all levels-except the
 theaters of operation.
 There was a time when medical care
 in South Vietnam by so-called t7SCOM
 units was primarily "among civilians di-
 rected by the White House and State
 Department, and lowered quality medical
 care to the level of the Far Eastern
 trained-and French trained-physicians
 working and operating in barrios and
 under nonmodern  conditions;  rather
 than elevating and trailing their type
 care to our standards of know-how,
 equipment, and technique.  Toward this
 end, as early as January 1964, hearing
 records will indicate that I recommended
 to the Secretary of Defense that our mil-
 itary installations be beefed up and used
 for both direct care for our service cas-
 ualties as well as training and demon-
 stration units for the civilian for the
 physicians and their aids of South. Viet-
 nam.  From the attached article, para-
 phrasing the Theater Surgeon Col. Spur-
 geon Neel, Medical Corps, U.S. Army, I
 am pleased to report that this has been
 done. I know many military units have
 been commended for lack of loss of life,
 including one in support of units north-
 west of Saigon which was commended
 for handling 128 battle casualties in one
 24-hour battle without a single loss of
 life. In the field of evacuation we have
 recently recommended forward place-
 ment of the trained and ready tactical
 aeromedical evacuation  squadrons in
 order to better maintain the highly de-
 veloped, but ofttimes improvised rapid
 evacuation.
 Physicians have always served with
 professional know-how and quickly ac-
 quired military acumen, where needed
 around the world in times of stress. Be-
 cause their know-how on completion of
 training is geometrically progressive and
 greater than their forebearers in recent
 wars, I predict that the death rate from
 battle casualities-as well as sick and
 nonbattle injuries-will continue to im-
 prove.              It is now less than 1 percent in
 South Vietnam. No wonder there is high
 morale among those fortunate enough
 to be evacuated.
 This article, dateline Saigon, South
 Vietnam, is self-explanatory, and I com-
 mend it to all, not only as interesting
 reading concerning the entire medical
 departments, but as an accurate esti-
 mate of the situation which will improve
 the morale of the retirees concerning
 their own, as well as the Nation's youth,
 who are in this hapless situation:
 CHIEF  SURGEON  A  HAPPY  MAN-SUPPLY  OF
 U.S. MEDICS IN VIET Is TERMED "IN EXCEL-
 LENT SHAPE"
 SAIGON,     SOUTH  VIETNAM.-CO1. Spurgeon
 Neel is a happy man.  He has the tools to
 do his job-save the lives of wounded United
 States and Vietnamese soldiers in Vietnam.
 Neel, chief surgeon for the Military Assist-
 anceCornmand, Vietnam (MACV), feels that
 he has a more than adequate supply of neces-
 sities needed for healing-well trained, dedi-
 cated doctors and nurses and excellent medi-
 cal supplies.
 He is free, too, of the usual military red
 tape.  His only boss here is Gen. William C.
 Westmoreland, U.S. Military Commander in
 Vietnam.
 An ebullient,  loquacious man,  Neel has
 first call on anything in the U.S. Army Medi-
 cal Corps.
 The supply of doctors to treat wounded
 Americans is good, he says: "We are in excel-
 lent shape both qualitatively and quantita-
 tively."
 Military spokesmen estimate there are well
 over 300 Army doctors and more than 200
 Army nurses in South Vietnam.   The Air
 Force and Navy likely have 150 additional
 doctors and about 100 nurses.
 In Vietnam Neel has two mobile Army sur-
 gical hospitals, three field hospitals and two
 evacuation hospitals.  The Navy has Its 3d
 Medical Battalion with C Company at Da
 Nang, the "Charley Med" that has taken care
 of so many wounded marines.
 In addition, the Korean division has an
 evacuation hospital of 400 beds, 26 doctors,
 and 33 nurses.
 Working with the medical people in Viet-
 nam, but not under MACV control are six
 military hospitals in Japan, one on Okinawa
 and one at Clark Air Force Base Hospital in
 the Philippines.
 Neel says he sometimes has an unusual
 problem: overreaction to his requests by au-
 thorities in the United States.
 Sometime ago he asked for a flight surgeon,
 and they sent out a man who had been in-
 strumental in flight-surgeon training at Fort
 Rucker, Ala.
 I was glad to have him, and he was en-
 thusiastic about coming," Neel said, "but
 actually it would have been better if he had
 kept on training other flight surgeons  at
 home."
 Neel does have other problems, of course,
 mainly concerned with logistics.  Although
 he has first priority in the Army Medical
 Corps, there is still the problem of getting
 supplies to' their destinations at the proper
 time.
 The death rate for soldiers arriving    at
 forward hospitals in World War I was 81/2
 percent.  By World War II this had dropped
 to 41/2 percent, and only 21/2 percent of the
 soldiers reaching forward hospitals in Korea
 died.
 In Vietnam the ratio has been 1 percent or
 a trifle less.
 Neel is proud of the low rate, but he real-
 izes it could easily change if the Vietcong
 start throwing large masses of troops Into
 battle or bring in heavy artillery or air at-
 tacks.
 "Actually, we haven't been strained too
 much yet," Neel says.  "Our buildup has been
 gradual enough that we could pretty well
 project our medical needs and keep up with
 them.  It hasn't been like Korea, where we
 found ourselves smack in the middle of a war
 one Sunday."
 Besides the first-rate personnel available to
 him, Neel believes two factors have been im-
 portant in the reduced death rate: improved
 anesthetics and techniques and the ability to
 provide whole blood to surgeons near the
 fighting.
 Amputations have been greatly reduced by
 improvements in vascular surgery and the
 fact that more surgeons can now perform
 such operations involving the blood vessels.
 "In Korea at one time we had only one
 man in one hospital who was an expert at
 this," he says.  "Now vascular surgery is per-
 formed at every military hospital.  We also
 have plastic tubing .now that we can use as
 'spare parts' in replacing damaged arteries
 and veins."                             -
 Swift movement of wounded men from the
 battlefield improves the chance of survival.
 2289
 In Korea only 10 percent of the wounded men
 were taken out by helicopter.  Here it's 90
 percent.
 The titles "field" and "evacuation" hospital
 mean little In Vietnam.  The 85th Evacua-
 tion at Qui Nhon on the central coast, for
 example, handled many of the first- cavalry-
 men wounded in the Ia Drang fighting, and
 by no means all of them were evacuated.
 And the 85th currently is treating about 300
 serious malaria cases, most of whom will be
 returned to duty from the hospital.
 Two of the six U.S. military hospitals in
 Japan handle most of the Vietnamese casual-
 ties that arrive in that country.  They are
 Johnson Hospital and Camp Drake, both run
 by the Army and both recently renovated.
 About 1,000 evacuees are in the facilities in
 Japan, but only 15 percent are men wounded
 in battle.  The others- are sick or were injured
 outside combat.
 Only the less serious cases among evacuees
 are taken to Japan.  They are men who are
 'expected to be returned to duty.   Serious
 cases or those, for example, requiring plastic
 surgery, are flown on to the United States.
 U.S. medical authorities in Japan say their
 supplies and personnel are adequate.
 The U.S. Army hospital on Okinawa has
 been expanded from 350 to. 500 beds.  The
 hospital has a sufficient staff, its administra-
 tors say.
 One of the key out-country hospitals han-
 dling wounded is Clark Air Base Hospital near
 Manila.   At Clark some casualties remain,
 but others, usually critical cases that can be
 moved, are quickly transferred to other mili-
 tary hospitals in the Pacific area, including
 Honolulu and Formosa.  Some are sent di-
 rectly to the United States.
 There are no serious shortages at Clark,
 but- during such major battles as Ian Drang
 the hospital was jammed, and doctors and
 nurses sometimes worked for 48 hours with-
 out sleep.
 The  most  serious  problem  confronting
 Army doctors is. wounded who require brain
 surgery. There are not many brain surgeons
 in the Army.
 Some U.S. doctors are attached to South
 Vietnamese units, and many American physi-
 cians serve as advisers to the Vietnamese.
 U.S. medical personnel also hold clinics in
 every village the Army passes through, pass-
 ing out medical supplies and treating every-
 thing from a scratch- to surgery.  Individ-
 ual treatments, a spokesman says, average
 20,000 to 30,000. a week.
 TARIFF CUT OF 50 PERCENT
 UNJUSTIFIED          -
 (Mr. GROSS asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD.)
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 had strong misgivings about the Trade
 Expansion Actof 1962 and the 50-per-
 cent tariff reductions proposed under it.
 The tariff cuts would be across the board
 and very few items would be spared from
 the 50-percent cut.
 The act itself in no sense called for
 such  a  drastic  operation.   This  was
 superimposed on it later by the Presi-
 dent's Special Representative for Trade

 The act itself contemplated something
 very different.   The legislation called
 for very extensive and detailed hearings
 by both the U.S. Tariff Commission and
 the Committee for Trade Information.
 It called for the gathering of --detailed
 information on the many tariff items,

 levels, but the American taxpayer has
 made up the difference between our
 costs and foreign prices.  Therefore the
 evidence does not support any notion of
 our competitive superiority.
 If the proper corrections are made in
 our statistics we will find that our
 vaunted export surplus vanishes so far as
 it could be taken as evidence of our com-
 petitive standing in world markets.
 This being the case it is not possible
 to justify any serious tariff :reductions at
 the present time, much less one of 50
 percent.
 Since our machinery exports indicate
 a competitive advantage perhaps talat
 item could withstand a duty reduction;
 but we should not jeopardize scores of
 other important products on the ground
 that our exports of machinery are boom-
 ing.
 Mr. Speaker, I am introducing a joint
 resolution designed to correct the stai,is-
 tica.l practices complained of so that we
 may  feel  confident  that  the  official
 statistics on which policy is based    is
 sound rather than deceptive.
 pertinent information that was to be
 ieveloped in the public hearings.
 The hearings were indeed held-3
 years  ago,  or  from December  1962
 through March 1963.  Some 800 wit-
 nesses testified or sent in statements,
 including many Members of this House
 and the other body.  The purpose was
 to gather full information for measur-
 ing the probable effect of tariff reduc-
 tions on different products.
 If a general tariff reduction across the
 board had been contemplated it would
 have been unthinkable for Congress to
 require such hearings or for the hear-
 ings actually to be held as they were
 field.  It is obvious that the Congress
 had no intention of calling for a 50-
 percent cut across the board.  Yet that,
 with minor exceptions, is precisely what
 was agreed to with the GATT represent-
 ttives in a meeting held in May 1963,
 or nearly 3 years ago.
 The agreement with GATT placed the
 Congress in a ludicrous light and made
 of the public hearings held by the Tariff
 Commission and the Trade Information
 Committee an unaccountable exercise in
 the waste of time and money.  It was
 worse.   it broke faith with  accepted
 procedure and upset the trust placed in
 legislative enactments.
 Mr. Speaker, these highhanded pro-
 cedures and the flouting of the statute
 have been enough to condemn the whole
 American participation in the Geneva
 negotiations.  Congress should call for
 a correction, and insist that the unques-
 tionable intent of the law as reflected by
 the  provisions  I  have  mentioned  be
 honored rather than brushed aside as
 to much chaff.  If the Congress per-
 mits its laws to be thus interpreted at
 will by administrators there would be
 no need of legislating.
 't'his is not all.
 On the economic side a deep flaw in
 our trade statistics that has been pro-
 ducing  deceptive  effects  about  this
 country's competitive position in foreign
 trade, is coming to light.  The public has
 been led to believe that our position is
 so strong that we have succeeded in
 ringing up export surpluses of $5 to $7
 billion per year in recent years.  This
 optimistic  impression  has been chal-
 lenged in recent times.                   I myself chal-
 lenged it in a statement on this floor last
 fall; and I am convinced that the United
 titates is not in good shape in foreign
 markets. as measured by truly competi-
 tive exports.
 The one itern of manufactured goods
 in which our exports have prospered has
 been machinery and industrial equip-
 ment: and this is accounted for by the
 large outflow of capital from this coun-
 try into production facilities in foreign
 countries,  where  labor costs  are dis-
 tinctly lower than here.  In manufac-
 tured items other than machinery our
 share of world markets has been shrink-
 ing.
 We have also increased our exports of
 farm products, but the increase is ac-
 counted for wholly, not by our competi-
 tive  advantage,  but  by  governmental
 assistance.  Shipments  under foreign
 aid, the food for peace program, et cetera,
 have lifted our farm exports to record

 Mr. MIZE. Mr. Speaker, in view of
 our consideration of legislation to pro-

 propriate to call attention to a st:Lte-
 ment which I have filed with the House
 Veterans' Affairs Committee in behalf of
 the bill I have introduced, H.R. 12168,
 the Veterans' Educational Assistance Act
 of 1966.
 The statement follows:
 STATEMENT  OF  CONGRESSMAN  CHESTER  '111ZE
 TO VETERANS'   AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IN    }1E-
 HALF  OF                                                                           H.R. 12168,  THE VI':rERANS' i"DU-
 CATIONAL, AssLiTANca ACT OF 1966, FEes IARY
 7, 1966
 Mr. Chairman and members of the Vet-
 erans' Affairs Committee, the United Si,ates
 has always been generous with its veterans.
 The Congress and the people have always
 recognized that  compulsory military  serv-
 ice demands sacrifices on the part of those
 called upon to serve their country in times
 of peace as well as in times of war.  Young
 men and women must leave their job::., in-
 terrupt their educations, and disrupt their
 family lives in order to All positions e.ven-
 tial to the national security.
 In  the past we have helped compensate
 for these sacrifices through federally spon-
 sored programs,  After World War IT, it. was
 the GI bill of rights; after the Korean con-
 flict it was the Korean bill of rights.  't'hese
 were programs to help the veteran continue
 his education, retrain for his job,  geer his
 family into a home, or start a new business.
 They have cost billions of. dollars, but we
 have accepted these costs as part of the
 price we have to pay to keep the Nation se-
 cure against the efforts of those who would
 destroy us or enslave us.  It is interesting
 to note, however, that the billions we spent
 in these programs have-returned additional
 billions  to  the  economy from the  getter
 salaries of the better trained and the better
 educated veterans.
 Since the expiration of the Korean GI bill
 in January 1955, our country has still had
 compulsory military training because there
 has never been a time when we didn't need
 the services of GI's to carry out defense do-
 ties around the globe.   We've referred to
 these periods of service as cold war duties
 even though they have had the habit of
 heating up now and then in Berlin, Lebanon,
 Quemoy and Matsu, Cuba, southeast Asia,
 and the Dominican Republic.
 Legislation has been introduced as a cold
 war bill of rights and has passed the Senate.
 This legislation has strong support among
 Members of the House of Representatives, as
 witness the number of bills which have come
 before this committee.  It is generally ac-
 cepted, although somewhat reluctantly by
 the administration, that the Nation provide
 readjustment benefits for our service men
 and women as long as we find it necessary to
 call them into the service of their country.
 We differ as to the degree of this assistance,
 however.  In the introduction of my bill, I
 have joined with my colleagues who feel that
 we should include all veterans who have bad
 at least 6 months of military service from
 February 1, :1955, to the termination of their
 compulsory service.  Those who become eli-
 gible on the basis of their service would earn
 education or training time at the rate of it l</div></div></div>  </div>
