				ABSTRACT:     	The   	1978   	natianal   	model   	airplane   	competition  was   	held
				from  8-22   	September  at   	the   	Ta~yuan  School   	of  Aeronautics.     	This
				competiti~n  was   	the   	largest   	in  the   	model   	airplane   	history  and
				included   	the   	following  events:   	third   	class   	tugged  model   	airplane~
				third   	class   	rubber  band   	powered  model   	airplane,   	second   	class
		-	     	wire   	controlled   	model  airplane,   	and   	second   	class   	radio   	controlled
		     	model   	airplane.     	There   	were   	also   	test   	flignts   	to   	break   	national
		     	records   	in  several   	categories  and  technical   	sessions   	to   	exchange
		     	ideas   	on  new  model  aicplanes.     	The   	six  teams  having  the   	highest
		     	team  scores   	from  this   	campetition  were:   	Shan~hai,   	Sichuan,   	Henan,
		     	Shaanxi,   	Guizhou,   	and   	Shanxi.

	  	_	     	has   	a   	very  small   	aspect   	ratio   	and   	is   	equipped  with  vertical

			 	flight   	stability.     	The   	payload   	capacity  of  a  lifting  body   	is
			 	approximately  4.5   	times   	as   	l~rge   	as   	that  of  a   	conventional  air-

			 	dra~  sugfered   	by  a  lifting  body,   	its   	climb  rate   	is   	slow   	and   	its
			 	cruisin~   	speed   	is   	limited   	(^~95  miles   	per  hour).     	Because   	of   	its
			 	special   	flight   	characteristics~   	the   	liftirg   	body  may  be   	developed
			 	into   	a   	new  tyne   	of  vertical   	take-off  and   	landing  aircr~ft.
