 I.    The Chinese Communist Ninth Party Congress, which
 lasted most of April, does not seem to have resolved
 many of China's massive political problems.
 A.    Although'it was billed as a "unity" session,
 the congress appears to have done little to
 end the infighting.   Signs of factionalism
 persist in most provinces.
 1.  Violence died down last summer, but it has
 not ended completely.
 2.    Clashes continue in West China--'-particu-
 larly in populous Szechwan and in Tibet-/-
 and there are sporadic outbreaks of vio-
 lence in the east coast provinces as well.
 B.    The regime has not embarked on any major new
 programs or policies in the wake of the congress.
 Arguments about  both political and economic
 matters continue in the provin6j s and in Pe-
 king.

 II.   The congress itself was marked by discord and
 rancor.
 A.           Quarrels among top-level figures forced a brief
 postponeme.nt.of the meeting.  Continued disputes
 about policy and personnel caused it to last
 more than twice as long as originally planned.
 1.   Two important issues were how hard to push
 the radical and disruptive social programs
 which are dear to Mao's heart, and what is
 to be the shape of economic programs for
 the next year or so.   It appears that no
 firm decision was made on either of these
 issues.
 2.       Another divisive issue was the composi-
 tion of the new central committee.   The
 congress apparently spent at least half
 its time arguing this one out.
 B.   The central committee that finally emerged
 from these deliberations seems to be a
 compromise body, with some representation
 for virtually every political interest
 group within the regime. No single faction
 has the strength to dominate, which may well
 be the way Mao wants it.   It leaves him in
 full charge.

 1.   It is heavily weighted in favor of the
 provinces, and the military appear to
 be the biggest gainers.
 2.   Party bureaucrats suffered badly.   Gov-
 ernment administrators seem to have done
 little better.
 3.   This probably means that Chou En-lai has
 suffered some loss of influence and power,
 although he is still listed as the number
 three man behind Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao.
 A number of his subordinates were dropped
 from the new Politburo formed at the close
 of the congress.
 4.   The most dramatic fact about the new Central
 Committee is the evidence it offers on the
 destruction of the Communist Party machinery,
 Although the new Committee:'is much larger
 than its predecessor, it has dropped nearly
 70 percent of the Communist officials who
 were still active in the old Central Com-
 mittee at the time the Congress began.

 C.   The Politburo tends to reflect and legiti-
 mize power relationships as they now exist
 in China.
 1.   Nearly all of Mao's radical associates
 who were prominent in pushing the Cultural
 Revolution are on the new body.   They
 dominate the Politburo Standing Committee,
 the highest policy-making organ in the
 country.
 2.   These radicals, however, have to share
 power and authority with newly-important
 military men.  Almost all the new faces
 on the,Politburo were drawn from the mili-
 tary establishment.  Military men from the
 provinces appear to be particularly promi-
 nent in this grouping.
 D.   Mao seems to have disposed of most, but not
 all, of the important party bureaucrats he
 labeled as his opponents in the course of
 the Cultural Revolution.   In this sense, this
 was his congress.

 1.   He was apparently active and energetic
 throughout the Congress.   Films and re-
 cordings of some of the public proceedings
 indicate that .he made a better impression,
 physically and verbally, than his designated
 successor, Lin Piao.
 2.   Mao does not have things all his own way.
 He has to lean heavily on the army, which
 is just about the only really operative arm
 of the government at the moment.
 3.   Many of the army leaders opposed the excesses
 of the Cultural Revolution.   They are per-
 sonally loyal to Mao, but they don't see
 eye to eye with him on many of his policies.
 4.   The prospects are for continued infighting
 and differences at virtually all levels of
 the regime a situation that is not likely
 to change until the old man dies.

 c:  DOCI FYI
 1.   DCI is to fly to the ranch to brief LBJ on
 Friday, 13 June.
 2.   By and large, as he did on last briefing, he
 will brief from notes or a quick and dirty summary
 page, to which recent briefings/memos/talking papers
 will be attached as back-up reference.
 3.   Situation is complicated by fact Kissinger
 yesterday spent 3-1/2 hours briefing LBJ, which on
 one hand means some subjects needn't be covered, on
 other hand means he will have stirred up some fur-
 ther questions for DCI.
 4.   For the moment, DCI has requested papers on
 Paris Vietnam Negotiations and Big Four/Bilateral
 Middle East Negotiations from which he can talk, but
 which he can also leave with LBJ.
 5.   Kissinger apparently briefed on WH view of
 status of SALT negotiations, but DOCI feels this may
 have served to whet LBJ appetite, and DCI should be
 prepared to handle more questions. Accordingly DCI
 should have status memo on SALT--readiness to talk,
 testing and deployments continue, so does veiled
 sniping by Soviet hardliners.
 6.   DOCI agrees these papers will be wide open
 on classification, but Vietnam is particularly tricky
 because it's so much WH State baby.    DOCI feels
 paper should stay pretty much on the generalized
 side, and he wants to see it himself before it goes
 forward to DCI.

 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 The Biafran Relief Problem
 Summary
 Biafran relief has become a charged inter-
 national issue that could severely strain and pos-
 sibly rupture US-Nigerian relations.   There is very
 little reliable information on the actual number of
 refugees or on the rate of starvation in Biafra, but
 it does appear that the situation will worsen within
 the next few months.   The plight of the refugees has
 not had any significant effect on the policies of
 either side in the civil war, but the Biafrans use
 it for propaganda purposes, and at least some Ni-
 gerians favor starving the Biafrans into submission
 as the best war policy.
 As the war drags on, the federal authorities
 will probably become increasingly suspicious of
 foreign involvement in Biafran relief, and may feel
 compelled to react strongly against foreign countries
 backing stepped-up relief to the secessionists.   Vio-
 lent anti-US demonstrations could also occur.
 Note:   This memorandum was produced solely by CIA.   It
 was prepared by the office of Current Intelligence and
 coordinated with the office of Economic Research, the
 Office of National Estimates, and the Clandestine Ser-
 vices.

 1.   The area now under Biafran control is approx-
 imately one fourth that of the former Eastern Region
 which Colonel Ojukwu led into secession in May 1967. As
 a result of the Ibo exodus into Biafran-controlled ter-
 ritory as federal forces advanced,  the population in
 present-day Biafra has increased from a prewar four
 million to somewhere between six and seven million.
 Even before the civil war this particular section of
 the Eastern Region was a densely populated area de-
 pendent on imported food.
 2.   There is unquestionably starvation in the
 Biafran-controlled area and in the areas of the former
 Eastern Region overrun by federal forces.   The number
 of deaths from starvation appears to have risen sharply
 during the period from last July through October. Deaths
 probably numbered in the hundreds of thousands, but ac-
 curate figures are not available.   These deaths pre-
 sumably occurred mostly among the very old, the young,
 and the sick.  After October there was an apparent de-
 cline in deaths from starvation probably because of an
 improvement in the food distribution system, the in-
 creased airlift of food by relief organizations, and
 the fact that the main yam harvest occurred at this
 time.
 3.   Forecasts on the seriousness of the starva-
 tion problem in the coming months range from a rela-
 tively low death rate to those predicting mass starva-
 tion.   The US Embassy in Lagos has estimated that by
 July some 3.5 million Biafrans and some 2.25 million
 refugees in federal-held territory will be in need of
 food. Should the direst predictions regarding the
 food situation materialize and the worst circumstances
 prevail,  some two to three million people in Biafra and
 in the federally occupied areas could die of starvation
 in the next few months.   It does not appear that death
 from starvation will be anywhere near this serious,.
 however.  Moreover, a real if unmeasurable considera-
 tion in any such estimate is the Biafrans' ability to
 cope with the problem themselves.   Colonel Ojukwu re-
 cently launched another campaign to increase food pro-
 duction, and it must be assumed that the Biafrans will
 turn their considerable ingenuity toward alleviating
 the problem.

 Sources of Assistance
 4.   Relief to the Biafrans has come mainly from
 Joint Church Aid  (JCA), an association of religious
 relief agencies operating from the Portuguese island
 of Sao Tome off the coast of Nigeria, and until early
 this month from the International Committee of the
 Red Cross  (ICRC) based in neighboring Equatorial
 Guinea.   The unofficial Catholic charity organization,
 Caritas, has also sent some relief supplies from Sao
 Tome, and the French Red Cross operates relief flights
 from Libreville.
 5.        The ICRC operation was suspended early this
 month by the government of newly independent Equatorial
 Guinea for a variety of reasons, not the least of which
 is the unstable situation that prevails in this tiny
 former Spanish dependency.   There is a large Ibo work
 force on Fernando Po, which the government of Equato-
 rial Guinea fears is bent on subversion.   Equatorial
 Guinea also believes it is under pressure by its much
 larger neighbor and has come down firmly on the side
 of Nigeria over the Biafran question.  When the terri-
 tory was under Spanish control, the ICRC operation
 worked smoothly.   After independence last October,
 however,  tension developed between ICRC officials and
 the Equatorial Guineans who have described the relief
 workers as arrogant and disrespectful of Equatorial
 Guinea's sovereignty.   Equatorial Guinean Government
 officials have also indicated that they are receiving
 much less financial compensation for the ICRC opera-
 tion than the Spanish did.   Foreign Minister Ndongo
 has indicated that his country would consider reopen-
 ing the airlift if the proper financial compensation
 were forthcoming.   it is by no means certain, however,
 that he was speaking for his government, particularly
 the highly volatile President Macias, who has publicly
 committed himself not to permit ICRC night flights and
 who seems bent on using this issue to underscore Equa-
 torial Guinea's independent status.
 6.   All relief fligths by the JCA and ICRC have
 been made at night.   The Biafrans refuse to open their
 one operating airstrip to day flights, fearing that
 the Nigerians would use this opportunity to land troops
 on the airstrip.  Also, the Biafrans want to continue
 night relief flights as a cover for separate arms

 flights.   The ICRC had been transporting approximately
 80 tons of relief supplies per night to the Biafrans,
 while the JCA is presently carrying about 100 tons of
 relief supplies nightly.
 Nigerian Attitudes on Relief
 7.   Nigeria has reluctantly accepted the need
 for foreign participation in the Biafran relief effort,
 but Lagos has always been suspicious of the activities
 of the foreign relief agencies involved.   Lagos would
 prefer that all relief be channeled through Nigeria,
 and,  ideally,  through Nigerian relief organizations.
 The federal authorities tacitly sanctioned the prin-
 ciple of daylight flights by the ICRC from Equatorial
 Guinea, but have never given their approval for night
 flights.   Indeed,  last November Lagos implied that
 planes flying into Biafra at night risked being shot
 down.
 8.   The Nigerians object strongly to the JCA
 operation from Sao Tome,  and with some justification.
 The JCA has completely bypassed Lagos in its opera-
 tions, and arms are also being flown to the secession-
 ists from Sao Tome.   The same airplanes have been used
 for arms and relief flights, and it seems probable,
 although there is no definite evidence,  that some of
 the planes have carried mixed cargoes.   The JCA of-
 ficials are definitely pro-Biafran and have not been
 too discreet about expressing these sympathies publicly.
 The Biafran Viewpoint
 9.   The Biafrans have said that they welcome
 relief from any donors, except Nigeria, the UK, and
 the USSR--the "unholy alliance" which the Biafrans
 are convinced is bent on the extermination of the Ibos.
 The Biafran insistence that relief not be channeled
 through Lagos results from the secessionists'  unwilling-
 ness to appear dependent on Nigeria for anything, on
 a genuine fear that Lagos would poison the food,  and on
 the probably justifiable fear that Nigeria would use
 relief supply channels, such as a land relief corridor
 from Nigeria to Biafra, for military purposes.   The
 Biafrans have done all they can to alleviate the refu-
 gee and starvation problems, but the secessionist leader-
 ship has given no indication--even during the July-

 October period--of being moved by the problem to a
 more compromising position with respect to the seces-
 sion issue.
 Prospects
 10.  As the war drags on, with a probable in-
 crease in starvation, the Nigerians are likely to be-
 come even more sensitive to 'foreign meddling" over
 the relief issue.   Some Nigerian leaders regard star-
 vation as a legitimate weapon of war and see aid to
 theBiafrans as merely prolonging the fighting.  Most
 Nigerians, and at least some federal leaders, regard
 foreign relief to Biafra as direct support to the se-
 cessionists in an attempt to Balkanize Nigeria.                                      The
 strong adverse reaction that greeted the announcement
 in December that the US was furnishing C-97 aircraft--
 four to the ICRC and four to the dcA--provides evidence
 of the Nigerian attitude on this matter..
 11.   Federal leader Gowon himself probably under-
 stands the US position on relief, but he has made
 clear to the US ambassador that the Nigerian people
 regard it as aid and comfort to the enemy.   US efforts
 to reopen the ICRC's operation from Fernando Po have
 resulted in a definite increase in anti-US sentiment
 in Nigeria.   The Nigerians recently leaked to the
 press a US note strongly urging--Lagos termed it de-
 manding--the resumption of the airlift.   In the Ni-
 gerian press and radio, the fact that US Secretary
 Rogers held his first official meeting with the Equato-
 rial Guinean foreign minister was portrayed as further
 evidence of a change in US policy on Nigeria.
 12.   Official Nigerian reaction to US efforts to
 increase relief. to Biafra has thus far been confined
 to verbal expressions of displeasure.   There has been
 stinging criticism of the US in the Nigerian press and
 radio,  and some anti-US demonstrations have been held.
 It would seem likely that as the war continues, further
 efforts'by the US on behalf of Biafran relief will pro-
 voke a dramatic increase in anti-US sentiment in Ni-
 .geria.   This in turn would increase pressure on federal
 leaders to take strong official action against the US.

 DCI'S 9 JUNE BRIEFING
 ROCKEFELLER TRIP
 I.  Governor Rockefeller, halfway through a schedule
 of four separate fact-finding trips to Latin
 America,;is encountering increasingly hostile
 Communist-instigated demonstrations which are
 giving his host governments pause.
 II.   During the first trip--to Mexico,  the Central
 American Republics, and Panama,  from May 11 to 18--
 The governor's visit was marked by only minor
 demonstrations.
 A.   The most serious incident was in Honduras,
 where student demonstrations led by a Commu-
 nist front group resulted in the accidental
 death of one student.
 B.   There were no demonstrations in Mexico, Panama,
 or Guatemala.
 C.   Most government officials were pleased with the
 visits and felt they were productive.
 III.     Even before the second trip began on May 27, we had
 evidence that the Communists were planning demonstra-
 tions of varying intensity at every point on the
 itinerary except Trinidad.

 A.   We identified Bolivia and Venezuela as the two
 countries where the demonstrations would be
 most hostile.
 B.   In addition, Peru cancelled the visit before
 the Governor left the United States, calling
 it "inopportune" because of the controversy
 over the International Petroleum Company and
 the U.S. suspension of military assistance.
 C.   Demonstrations at the first two stops--Colombia
 and Ecuador--did not affect the Governor or his
 party.
 D.   In Bolivia on May 31, however, the government
 limited the visit to three hours at the airport.
 President Siles feared that student demonstra-
 tions would get out of hand, and be used by the
 Bolivian military command as an excuse to throw
 Siles out of office.
 E.     Venezuela, which had been plagued by two weeks
 of student riots,  first suggested that Governor
 Rockefeller stay at the officers'  club instead
 of a Caracas hotel. One day before his scheduled
 arrival, when Rockefeller was in Trinidad, the
 Venezuelans cancelled the visit on grounds that
 planned demonstrations would adversely affect
 internal security.

 IV.   The third leg of the tour is scheduled to start

 A.    Uruguay has asked for postponement=-g ^f =-ably
 All leftist groups are planning

 B.    The Brazilians say they are "eagerly awaiting"
 the visit, but the government is becoming
 increasingly uneasy over the prospect of strikes
 and student demonstrations.
 C.    There is little or no security threat in Paraguay.
 V.   The fourth trip, set to begin the last week in June,
 originally included Chile, Argentina, and the Carib-
 bean islands: Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica,
 Guyana, and Barbados.
 A.    Chile, however, has already cancelled the visit.
 There was a general consensus against it on grounds
 that threatened rioting on an extremely serious
 scale would only serve to weaken President Frei's
 government,  and that the visit appeared unnecessary.

 according to the Chileans, and thus obviates

 B.   After Chile's cancellation, Governor Rockefeller
 considered switching Argentina to the third trip--
 with Brazil and Paraguay.

 yet, but they too fear major disturbances and
 believe that cancellation or at least post-
 ponement would be the best solution.

 Dominican Republic are beginning to plan demon-

 I.   There does not appear to be much ground for
 accommodation between the position of Peru on
 International Petroleum Company and U.S.  legis-
 lation requiring specific U.S. response.
 A.    Peru claims a "debt" of $690 million--far
 more than the worth of IPC's holdings--for
 all oil IPC has extracted since operations
 began.
 B.    U.S.  law requires suspension of economic aid
 and sugar quotas six months after expropriation
 of a U.S.  firm without adequate compensation.
 1.   April 7 deadline was deferred on pretext
 that Peruvian courts still afforded an
 avenue for settlement--but ultimately there
 must be either compensation, or sanctions.
 2.   Meanwhile incidents with U.S. fishing boats
 in Peru's 200-mile limit have required  (by
 U.S.  law--Pelley Amendment)  suspension of
 military aid,  and Peru has requested withdrawal
 of military mission.
 C.    From U.S. end, there seems to be no way around
 sanctions required by U.S.law.   In short term,

 I.   There has been no real progress toward a solu-

 the International Petroleum Company since the
 deferral of economic sanctions on 7 April.
 A.    Discussions have taken place in both'Lima
 and Washington,/in the hope of finding a
 solution,_,~but thus far the main thrust of
 the discussions has been to give each side
 a complete picture of the other's position.
 B.    The meetings between the negotiating teams
 have been cordial and the Peruvians do not
 seem to want an immediate confrontation.
 They have not, however, given any indica-
 tion that they are prepared to consider
 seriously any solution involving Peru's ac-
 tually paying any compensation for the ex-
 propriated property.
 C.   The obstacle to an easy settlement of the
 matter is the Peruvian claim that IPC owes
 the state some $690 million.

 1. This amount far exceeds any valuation
 that could be placed on the expropriated
 assets, and thus precludes any net com-
 pensation to IPC as long as Peru adheres
 to its present position.
 2. The Velasco government has shown no signs
 of giving in on the matter of this "debt,"
 and indeed, Velasco or any successor
 would probably find it politically impos-
 sible to concede on this point.
 3. The Peruvian negotiating team has several
 times suggested that IPC take the matter
 to the Peruvian courts, where it could
 contest the debt by demonstrating that
 it had legal title to the oil fields or
 had at least operated them in good faith.
 The implication is that the court might
 uphold IPC, but there is very little
 evidence that IPC would indeed receive
 a fair and unbiased hearing.

 ical, economic, diplomatic--there is little

 troversy acceptable to the U.S. can be found
 over the short term.
 IT.    A more immediate problem is Peru's long-standing
 claim to a 200-mile limit to its territorial
 sea, which has resulted in the seizure and fining
 of several U.S.  fishing boats in recent
 months.  U.S. military sales to Peru have con-
 sequently been suspended under the Pelley Amend-
 ment.
 A.   Peru reacted to the public disclosure of
 this suspension with a request for the
 immediate withdrawal of the U.S. military
 missions, and a declaration that---;
 I
 Governor
 Rockefeller's visit to Lima would be "inop-

 1.   It appears that the Peruvians have
 seized on the current situation to just-

 with French and other European advisers,
 an action they have long considered.

 3.   The suspension of U.S. military sales
 probably struck Velasco as an opportunity
 for a harsh reaction which would stir up
 more nationalistic support for his gov-
 ernment.   His reaction may also have been
 a bid for greater Latin American support
 on the IPC issue.

 Peru - The IPC Controversy
 Summary
 Peru has had many military governments in its
 history, but the product of the coup last October
 is significantly different from anything that has
 gone before.
 --It is strongly nationalist and its lead-
 ers are resolved to reduce Peruvian depend-
 ence on the United States.
 --Perhaps more important, there is evidence
 of strong interest within the military gov-
 ernment in the need for basic economic and
 social changes aimed at improving the con-
 ditions of life for the country's under-
 privileged majorities.   President Velasco
 and others have spoken frequently of the
 economic and social reforms they have in
 mind, but thus far the government has taken
 few, if any,  concrete steps to carry out
 the announced "revolution."
 --Peru's new leaders have asserted that
 theirs'isno mere caretaker government.
 They say the military will remain in
 power for as many years as it takes to
 set the country irrevocably on the course
 toward economic and social development--
 and that they will never return power
 to the ineffectual legislative and politi-
 cal party systems that were thrown out in
 October.
 Note:   This memorandum was produced solely by the Cen-
 tra7 InteZZigence Agency.   It was prepared by the Of-
 fice of Current InteZZigence and was coordinated with

 1.   The military's original plan of govern-
 ment, drawn up shortly after the coup, was a gen-
 eral set of guidelines encompassing the foregoing
 objectives.   The government's plans and tactics
 have evolved during its first six months in power,
 and they continue to evolve.   The trend is toward
 greater state control over the economy and, though
 this is still not clearly defined, toward a more
 comprehensive program of national development in-
 cluding attempts to solve some of the country's
 basic social problems.
 2.   The evolution of the government's tactics
 and programs has to some extent been a product of
 the rivalry within the government and the military
 between the men around President Velasco and a group
 of equally nationalistic, but somewhat more cautious
 men frequently referred to as the "moderates." Thus
 far, the  "moderates" have lost every round.   Their
 influence has progressively declined.   Additionally
 there has been a growing exodus from the government
 of able economists and technicians who had served
 the old regime.   Correspondingly, there has been a
 rise in the influence of more radical men, many of
 them civilians with leftist or, in a few cases, Com-
 munist ties.
 3.   Opposition to Velasco still exists within
 the government, but the President has shown a native
 political shrewdness that has thus far kept his op-
 ponents off balance and has compensated in large
 measure for his own lack of popular appeal.   One
 of the most effective instruments Velasco has used
 in his political power plays has been the high de-
 gree of nationalism engendered by the dispute with
 the United States.   He has even, at least temporarily,
 gained the support of much of the country's wealthy
 class by making it appear that the rich will benefit
 greatly from his efforts to reduce US economic power
 in Peru.   Organized labor is largely controlled by
 the powerful APRA party and remains a potent source
 of opposition.   At the moment, however, no civilian
 group could move successfully against the government
 without the support of a faction of the military--and
 there is no present sign that an effective alliance
 along these lines is developing.

 4.   The government has difficult economic prob-
 lems, but none of them is likely to become critical
 in the short term.  The Belaunde administration's
 stabilization program was.successful in greatly re-
 ducing the rate of inflation, and the military gov-
 ernment has been able to continue holding it to a
 minimum.   This has contributed, however, to a slow-
 down in economic growth and a rise in unemployment.
 Uncertainty over the prospect of US sanctions and
 over the new government's own programs reduced in-
 vestment activity somewhat after October, thus fur-
 ther contributing to recessionary conditions.  The
 government is expected to increase public invest-
 ment, to relax credit restrictions, and in other
 ways to compensate partially for the economic de-
 cline.   The foreign trade picture is promising, and
 foreign exchange reserves are expected to continue
 improving this year.  The outlook for Peru's long-
 term economic development, however, would be severely
 dimmed if the US imposed sanctions or continued dam-
 aging economic pressures.. Much would then depend on
 the willingness of European and Japanese governments
 to guarantee supplier credits and of investors from
 these countries to increase their activity in Peru.
 5.   The dispute with the United States has com-
 plicated Velasco's economic problems somewhat, but
 at the same time it has permitted him to consolidate
 his political position considerably faster than would
 otherwise have been the case.
 6.   Velasco's tactics have made it politically
 impossible for him or any conceivable successor to
 agree anytime soon to a settlement of the IPC case
 on terms involving Peruvian compensation for the
 property.   "Surrender" on this issue would be tanta-
 mount to treason, in his view.   The President, though
 still probably hopeful that the US will find some
 way to get him off the hook, is convinced that Peru
 can weather the storm if the US applies sanctions.
 He probably also feels he could further benefit from
 riding the resulting wave of anti-US nationalism.
 He has said he "will know what to do" if the US
 applies sanctions, but there is no solid information

 as to what his course may be.   At least for the short
 term, the radical and ultranationalist elements around
 Velasco would probably be strengthened in the wake of
 sanctions.
 7.  Whether or not the Peruvian Government is
 faced with US sanctions, it is likely to enlarge the
 role of the state in the Peruvian economy.   This would
 not by itself be a radical departure in the Latin
 American context, particularly because the Peruvian
 economy has long been one of the freest from government
 control in the hemisphere.   Neither would such a policy
 necessarily mean drastic action against all foreign
 investors in Peru.   The danger, however, is that forces
 may be set in motion in a highly charged nationalistic
 atmosphere that might carry Peruvian leaders toward
 policies which they may not now envisage.   Consequently
 the United States will have, at least for the short
 term, only the most minimal capability to influence
 favorably decisions of the Velasco government--whether
 or not sanctions are invoked.
 8.   The other Latin American countries are most
 anxious to avoid having to take sides in the US-Peru-
 vian dispute.   It it comes to a showdown, however,
 the majority would feel compelled to express sympathy
 publicly with Peru.   The extent and duration of the
 anti-US reaction in the hemisphere would in large
 part depend, however, on the circumstances in which
 sanctions were applied.   If they were in obvious re-
 sponse to a Peruvian provocation, reaction in the
 hemisphere would probably be less severe than other-
 wise.
 9.   A decision by the US to defer sanctions
 indefinitely would be greeted with relief in Latin
 America--as was the temporary deferral last month.
 At the same time, indefinite deferral of sanctions,
 unless accompanied by a credible rationale, might
 well be interpreted as a US capitulation in such
 countries as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.  More-
 over, it would give pause to real and potential
 US investors in Latin America and tend to undermine
 the US argument that it can be made worthwhile for
 the US private sector to contribute to the develop-
 ment of Latin America.

 political Dynamics
 10.   The military coup that brought General
 Juan Velasco Alvarado to power on 3 October 1968
 appears to have been motivated by essentially the
 same factors that had prompted similar actions by
 the Peruvian military in the past.   These are:   the
 belief that the political and economic situation in
 Peru was deteriorating; the desire to prevent Haya
 de la Torre and the APRA party, traditional enemies
 of the army, from coming to power; and the ambition
 of one man or group of men--in this case, General
 Velasco, who was to retire in January 1969 and
 would thus lose his power base.   The present mili-
 tary government differs significantly from previous
 ones, however.   One of the primary differences is
 that the top leaders, especially General Velasco,
 come principally from middle- and lower-middle-
 class backgrounds and, thus, do not have the close
 ties to the oligarchy that for so long characterized
 the majority of Latin American military officers.
 11.   Contingency plans for governing the coun-
 try had been in existence for more than a year be-
 fore the military assumed power.   These plans re-
 flected the hopes and values of the middle-class
 men responsible for drawing them up.   The military's
 basic plan for governing the country was, in fact,
 written by a group of graduates from the Center
 for Higher Military Studies  (CAEM), where the pre-
 dominantly leftist civilian professors had en-
 deavored to impress upon their students the need
 for social and economic reform in Peru.   The plan
 reflects this teaching in that it assigns to the
 state a dominant role in the economy and society,
 while at the same time upholding the armed forces'
 traditional position on the need for a strong and
 modern military establishment and an anti-Communist
 stance.
 12.   The Peruvian military men also came to
 power with a lingering resentment against the US,
 engendered by what they interpreted as unacceptable
 attempts by the US on several occasions in recent
 years to interfere with sovereign Peruvian deci-
 sions.   Several incidents since 1962 involved

 either the threatened or the actual suspension of
 US aid to Peru.   The strong and unsuccessful US
 efforts in 1967 to dissuade the Peruvians from pur-
 chasing French Mirage fighter planes was the most
 galling of these incidents to the Peruvian military.
 In a period of rising Peruvian nationalism,  these
 pressures served to emphasize Peru's economic de-
 pendence on the US--and to strengthen the resolve
 of some Peruvian military men to get the country
 out from under the US shadow.
 25X1
 13.   On 9 October the military government ex-
 propriated large portions of the US-owned Interna-
 tional Petroleum Company's  (IPC)  holdings in Peru.
 This accomplished several things,   (1)   it ended
 almost a half century of controversy in Peruvian
 political circles over IPC's role;  (2)  it provided
 justification for the military coup;  (3) it generated
 immediate popular support for the military govern-
 ment;  (4) it provided great personal satisfaction
 to President Velasco and others who have very
 strong feelings on IPC's alleged exploitation of
 Peru's people and natural resources.   The IPC is-
 sue became the raison d'etre of the military gov-
 ernment and the expropriation an act "in defense
 of the national sovereignty."  The initial hard
 line that President Velasco took on the matter soon
 had the entire government boxed into a position
 from which it could not have retreated, even if
 it had wanted to.   To back down, even slightly,
 would have been a severe blow                                     25X6

 14.   The original plan for the military govern-
 ment, developed by CAM and approved by President
 Velasco and his cabinet shortly after taking over
 in October, provided general guidelines for gov-
 erning the country but specified no concrete ac-
 tions.   It emphasized the need for rapid develop-
 ment of the country with the government playing a
 large role, but also assigned significant responsi-
 bilities to the private sector and foreign invest-
 ment.   It called for close cooperation with the US
 in combating Communist subversion in Latin America

 while at the same time rejecting US efforts to inter-
 fere in Peru's sovereign decisions.   The new govern-
 ment's economic program included the strengthening
 of major elements of the Belaunde administration's
 stabilization program, such as tax reform and reduc-
 tion in government expenditures.   The refinancing of
 part of Peru's foreign debt was also successfully com-
 pleted.   In its desire to attract needed foreign in-
 vestment, the Velasco government has taken every op-
 portunity to emphasize that the IPC is a "special"
 case and that foreign investment is welcome in Peru.
 15.   By mid-November 1968, it was evident that
 the government's policies were progressing beyond
 the guidelines set forth in the CAEM plan.   In late
 November the foreign minister, supposedly one of the
 "moderates" in the government, spoke on Latin Ameri-
 can economic integration and gave some hints as to
 what the government was planning for its internal
 economic and development policy.   He said that a
 vigorous collaboration of private industry and gov-
 ernment was needed, but that the government expected
 to guide private industry, make the final decisions
 in all cases involving the national interest and
 problems of economic and social integration, define
 the state's participation in basic production, and
 determine conditions for the association of state
 with private capital.
 16.   Prime Minister Montagne, the leader of the
 so-called moderates, enunciated on 5 December the "Rev-
 olutionary" Government's development policy, which
 resembles the long established policies of Mexico,
 Argentina, and Chile.   The evolution of thinking in
 the government toward greater state participation
 in the economy is evident in Montagne's statement
 that "the state will assume the role of the promoter
 of the national development for the benefit of the

 nation and of the national majority.   This does not
 deny the right of private initiative but defines the
 obligation of the state to orient private initiative
 to function on behalf of the common good."  He said
 that the new policies marked a change in the tradi-
 tional pattern of development and would assure the
 integration of Peru with social justice and reduce
 the national dependence on external forces  (i.e., the
 US) that have been increasingly present in Peru since
 its independence.   The development plan itself put
 heavy emphasis on state planning to achieve economic
 and social goals.   Agricultural policy as spelled out
 by General Benavides, the minister of agriculture,
 reflected the same spirit of reform, and the US Embassy
 remarked that many aspects of the policy were pre-
 cisely those the US had been advocating, to no avail,
 for years.   One primary aspiration of these various
 ambitious plans is the integration of the large In-
 dian population, which currently is almost totally
 outside the money economy, into the economic, social,
 and political life of the country.
 17.   The military also appears to have some
 vague plan for the restructuring of the political
 scene in Peru, but this is so far evident only in
 negative statements.   Part of this, the restructuring
 of the government's organization, has already been
 essentially carried out.  This reorganization was
 aimed at reducing duplication of effort, bringing
 several autonomous agencies under direct ministerial
 control, and cutting expenditures.   The military
 has placed most of the blame for the sad state of
 Peruvian affairs on politicians and the political
 system.   In its view, the political competition
 between parties served only to stagnate the nation's
 development and create an atmosphere in which all
 politicians are motivated primarily by self-interest.
 The military has made clear that it believes it is
 the only institution capable of putting Peru on the
 path to development and that it will remain in power
 as long as it takes to get the process irreversibly
 on its way.   This analysis by the military govern-
 ment is probably essentially correct, for the con-
 gress had in fact hamstrung most of the worthwhile
 programs recommended by the Belaunde administration.

 18.   The early attention that the new government
 devoted to quick establishment of relations with the
 USSR and Eastern Europe was probably a direct out-
 growth of two priorities:   the broadening of export
 markets, and the lessening of US economic and politi-
 cal influence.   Evidence indicates that top govern-
 ment leaders do not view this as a radical change
 in their essentially pro-Western stance, but as a
 justifiable move in view of the changed situation
 in the world and the fact that several Latin Ameri-
 can nations had already done the same thing.   The
 confrontation with the US might encourage the Peru-
 vian Government to seek some additional assistance
 from the Communist countries, but Peru apparently
 has no intention of getting deeply involved with
 them.   In addition, there is no indication that the
 Soviet Union has any intention of moving rapidly
 in Peru, although it can be expected to reassess
 the situation if US-Peruvian problems are further
 exacerbated.
 19.   Since November the statements of govern-
 ment officials, particularly President Velasco, have
 been remarkably consistent in describing the attitudes,
 ideology, and goals of the military government.  Ex-
 cerpts from an interview with Velasco in January,
 1969, probably provide the best clue to Velasco's view
 of the role of his government.   He described the
 ideology of the government as nationalistic and
 revolutionary.   Nationalism, he said, meant a rigor-
 ous defense of the nation's interests, the "Peruviani-
 zation" of the national economy, and a broadening
 of Peru's diplomatic relations with the rest of the
 world.   He then stated:   "This is a REVOLUTION... If
 it is pacific and tranquil, so much the better.   But
 REVOLUTION means, according to the dictionary,  'vio-
 lent change in the political institutions of a nation.'
 We are making changes as you can see, and we will
 make others very much greater--without regard for
 what the old legal concepts say.   We will turn over
 the entire structure of the nation in order to hand
 over a completely new framework."   His dedication
 to these principles, at least publicly, can be seen
 in his statement:   "We are ready to step over thou-
 sands of cadavers, to die in the attempt to achieve
 Approved For Re
 25X1
 sELREt

 the accomplishment of our goals...I offer my life
 in the holocaust of the revolutionary government
 and of the transformation of Peru."
 20. The ideology and stated policy objectives
 of this government are, of course, directly related
 to the personalities who hold the top positions in
 sontewnat  e iettist or statist orientation of the gov-
 ernment's policies can be traced to the graduates
 of CAEM, who now hold 70-80 percent of the key gov-
 ernment posts, and the civilian advisers around
 Velasco.   These advisers, headed by the leftist
 lawyer Alberto Ruiz Eldredge, were originally brought
 in to help set policy in the government's handling
 of the IPC matter.   Their primary qualification was
 that they were all ultra-nationalistic and had spent
 a great deal of time in activities designed to force
 IPC out of Peru.  Their influence has increased in
 recent months, partly as a result of the continuing
 difficulties with the US, and they are probably now
 involved in advising Velasco in matters other than
 petroleum.  These advisers, some of whom have Com-
 munist leanings, can be expected to seek to expand
 their roles in the government, although for now at
 least, it appears that Velasco is in firm control
 and directs them rather than vice versa.
 21.   There also exists in the government an
 opposition group of sorts, which is frequently re-
 ferred to as the  "moderates."   This group is composed
 primarily of generals who can be described as mod-
 erate only in the sense that they are probably more
 reasonable than Velasco and his coterie, without
 being significantly less nationalistic.  The in-
 fluence of this "moderate" group has appeared to
 be on the decline in the past few months, as the
 radicals behind Velasco have utilized their oppor-
 tunities to weaken the opposition and have suc-
 ceeded in removing one of its leading members, Min-
 ister of Finance Valdivia, from the cabinet.

 22.   The moderates have not taken advantage of
 opportunities, such as Velasco's retirement from ac-
 tive army duty on 31 January, to oust him.                                             Prime
 Minister Montagne,  the recognized leader of the mod-
 erate opposition, seems to lack the will to take over
 the presidency and the drive to take any drastic action.
 Other possibilities of ousting Velasco exist, but
 any attempt to do so must have at least the tacit
 support of Montagne.   General Jose Benavides,  the
 minister of agriculture, has the drive and ambition
 to make the move, but lacks the needed muscle.
 There is also some talk that Army Inspector General
 Vasi might sometime lead a move against Velasco,
 possibly to put a retired general, Ambassador to
 Brazil Julio Doig, in the presidency.   In addition,
 there have been recent reports that the ousted fi-
 nance minister, General Valdivia,  is seeking support
 for an attempt against Velasco.   Nevertheless, it
 does not seem likely that any of these possibilities
 will materialize in the next few months, unless there
 is some unexpected economic fiasco or a breakdown in
 public order.
 23. Civilian opposition could arise from the
 wealthy businessmen and landowners or the labor
 sector led by Haya de la Torre's APRA party.   The
 wealthy would be effective only in conjunction with
 elements within the military, but could bring pres-
 sure on some of the known opposition groups in the
 military to take the action they have put off for
 so long.  Velasco is not popular with any significant
 group, either within or outside the military, and
 any move against him would probably have at least
 the moral support of most sectors of the population.
 He has, however, at least temporarily bought off
 much of the wealthy sector by dangling before it
 the prospect of great benefits from the reduction
 of the overpowering US presence in the Peruvian
 economy. Labor and APRA have not been bought off,
 however, and could stir up trouble for Velasco

 24.   The Velasco government is moving toward
 more authoritarian control of the country,  tighten-
 ing the noose on political activity and on freedom
 of the press.   The government has not yet imposed
 official censorship, but censorship exists unofficially;
 most news commentators and editorialists take great
 care not to offend the government unduly.   This has
 not, however, prevented several Lima newspapers
 from criticizing Minister of Interior Artola for
 his "witch hunt," which has resulted in many arrests
 and deportations.   Artola has concentrated his at-.
 tacks against former officials of the Belaunde gov-
 ernment, usually accusing them of fraud or embezzle-
 ment, but even members of the current government
 have been caught up in his "moralization campaign?"
 This campaign has stifled activity on the part of
 the traditional political parties and at the same
 time has instilled in government officials a hesi-
 tancy to act without direct orders from above.
 Current Economic Situation
 25.   The Velasco government's economic policy
 from the outset utilized much of the program drawn
 up by Belaunde's Minister of Finance Ulloa.   The
 tax reforms were continued, to the surprise of the
 wealthy sectors, and efforts to refinance part of
 the foreign debt were successfully carried out by
 General Valdivia, Velasco's first finance minister.
 The Belaunde government's stabilization program re-
 duced the rate of inflation, and the military's
 adoption of the program and its further reduction
 of the government deficit have enabled it to hold
 inflation to a minimum.   Prices have risen faster
 in the last month or two, but this seems largely
 attributable to landslides that have blocked routes
 into Lima, resulting in significant increases in
 food prices.
 26.   The 31-percent devaluation of the sol in
 1967 and the subsequent stabilization measures, com-
 bined with rising world market prices for some key
 exports, have changed a substantial trade deficit
 into a large trade surplus.   The value of exports
 increased by 15 percent in 1968 with earnings from
 exports of copper,  fishmeal, and silver showing
 Approved For Release 2002/06/11 : CIA-RDP79T00827A011800010003-5              25X1
 Approved For Release 2002/06/11SMMFV9T00827A001800010003-5
 25X1
 the most rapid increases.  At the same time, imports
 fell by 23 percent as import costs rose because of
 the devaluation and the imposition of an import sur-
 charge and as demand for investment goods weakened.
 In addition, the heavy stockpiling of imports--which
 had taken place in anticipation of the devaluation--
 largely ceased after 1967.  A ban on the import of
 luxury automobiles was the major cause of a 58-
 percent drop in imports of transportation equipment.
 Imports of other consumer goods declined by eight per-
 cent, capital goods by 27 percent, and industrial
 raw materials by about 15 percent.   The balance-of-
 trade account improved by almost $300 million in
 1968, and a strong export surplus continued into
 early 1969.
 27.  Largely as a result of the stabilization
 program, economic growth slowed from 4.6 percent in
 1967 to roughly two percent in 1968, compared with a
 rate of growth in population of about three percent.
 It is probable that the rate of economic growth
 slowed even further in early 1969.  Most of this
 slowdown resulted from the stringent controls on
 fiscal and credit operations that were imposed under
 the austerity program and that have been progressively
 tightened through the first quarter of 1969.   In
 addition, uncertainty over the new government's eco-
 nomic policies reduced investment activity after
 October, thus further complicating existing re-
 cessionary conditions.   The economic slowdown un-
 doubtedly has contributed to a rise in unemployment
 as additions to the rapidly growing labor force have
 been increasingly difficult to absorb.   Per capita
 private consumption, however, probably has been
 maintained largely at the expense of investment in
 inventories and machinery.  Despite the decline in
 per capita GDP and in imports, it is doubtful if
 there has been any appreciable shortage of consumer
 goods and raw materials.   In anticipation of deval-
 uation,.inventories had been heavily built up in
 1966 and 1967.  Moreover, pockets of prosperity
 continue to exist in important sectors of the econ-
 omy.   Output of export industries and import-com-
 peting industries in particular has grown during
 the period since devaluation.

 25X1
 28.   The threat of sanctions has had the effect
 of reinforcing the recessionary effects of the sta-
 bilization program.   Business confidence dropped and
 economic activity slowed when uncertainty over impend-
 ing sanctions delayed management decisions.  As the
 six-month deadline for the imposition of economic
 sanctions approached, this uncertainty had an in-
 creasing effect on the Peruvian economy.  US and
 foreign bankers and businessmen began to curtail
 bank credits and supplier loans and temporarily to
 defer intended investment in Peru.   This, in time,
 imposed an added burden on domestic credit sources--
 already strained by the credit restraints of the
 stabilization program--as borrowers who had traditionally
 depended on foreign credit were forced to turn to
 domestic sources. The Peruvian authorities nevertheless
 opted to pursue very conservative fiscal and mone-
 tary policies during this period.
 29.   Peru's short-run economic prospects are
 for slow expansion, although real economic growth
 during 1969 will probably be less than the three-per-
 cent annual rate of population growth.   Unemployment
 will continue to grow,   but the recently announced
 42-percent increase in public investment expenditures
 in 1969 probably will be directed toward public works
 projects with a high labor and low import content.
 In addition,  the recent selective relaxation in credit
 restrictions is likely to lead to some small increase
 in domestic investment and thus create new jobs.
 30.   Inflation is unlikely to present a major
 problem during the remainder of 1969.   The Central
 Bank can be expected to keep over-all credit expan-
 sion within manageable limits, although some further
 credit relaxation will probably. occur.  In addition,
 reduction in the budget deficit appears likely during
 this calendar year.   Budget expenditures are expected
 to increase by 8.3 percent for the remainder of the
 year, but at the same time revenues should increase
 somewhat.   The government has put a high priority on
 tax reform, and a recently appointed tax commission
 is scheduled to recommend further changes by 30 June.

 31.  Exports for 1969 should equal or exceed
 those of 1968, and imports should continue at a
 low level as a result of the slowdown in the rate
 of economic growth.   Private foreign investment
 may be on the increase after a virtual cessa-
 tion of the inflow of long-term private capital in
 late 1968 and early 1969.  About $64 million in new
 investment contracts with three companies have
 been signed since February 1969, or soon will be.
 There are indications that Japan and France are
 considering projects that would bring even more
 outside money into Peru this year. Furthermore,
 Peru's foreign exchange reserves are expected to
 continue to improve in 1969.   There is a good
 possibility that Peru will meet both the reserve
 and expenditure targets required to be eligible
 to make its May drawing under the IMF standby agree-
 ment.
 ICP and Economic Sanctions:   Impact on Peru:
 32.   The issue of compensation for the expro-
 priated properties of the International Petroleum
 Company (IPC) has complicated the economic problems
 that the Velasco government would have had to face
 in any event; at the same time, however, it has allowed
 Velasco to consolidate his political position con-
 siderably faster and with much greater ease than
 would have otherwise been the case.   IPC had been
 a burning political issue for decades, and the mili-
 tary's forceful handling of the problem through ex-
 propriation had the full and'immediate support of
 the public and stirred the smouldering fires of
 nationalism.   Since the expropriation on 9 October,
 Velasco has had no difficulty in keeping the issue
 before the people and playing on the usually sup-
 pressed anti-American feelings of the general public.
 33.   The hard line Velasco has taken since
 expropriation has brought the situation to the point
 where no Peruvian could make a significant compromise
 with the US without opening himself to charges of

 "sell-out" and even treason, such as those made against
 officials of the Belaunde administration involved
 in the August 1968 agreement with the company.  This.
 is why it is highly unlikely that anyone, be it Velasco
 or any conceivable replacement, could agree anytime
 soon to a solution that included Peruvian compensation
 for the expropriated property.   Ruiz Eldredge, Velasco's
 chief adviser on the IPC case, has several times sug-
 gested to US negotiators that the US and IPC should
 agree to submit the whole matter to the Peruvian judi-
 cial system, seeming to hold out the possibility of
 some sort of an agreeable solution through this proce-
 dure.   It seems unlikely, however, that a Peruvian
 judge would feel any more freedom from pressures than
 a politician or'government official.   Thus, there is
 little likelihood that an amicable solution to the
 problem will be found in the near future.
 34.  As for the long term, it is the opinion
 of the US Country Team in Lima that the prospect of
 inducing Peru eventually to grant compensation to
 IPC can best be promoted by maintenance of US eco-
 monic pressures, but avoidance of overt sanctions.
 There is no way to tell how much time would be re-
 quired for this approach to be effective. Some
 kind of formula, particularly if it involved
 indirect compensation to IPC, perhaps through another
 company or a consortium, might ultimately prove ac-
 ceptable to the Peruvians.   Even this, however,
 would probably have to wait until public awareness
 of the issues had simmered down or been diverted.
 At the present time, the Peruvians seem willing to
 let negotiations go on indefinitely, although
 Velasco himself had seemed to be pushing for a
 US decision one way or the other at the conclusion
 of Ambassador Irwin's visit in April.
 35.  An analysis of the over-all situation sug-
 gests that either a hard line--i.e., one including
 the imposition of the sanctions--or a soft line of
 cooperation with the Velasco government would delay,
 or end the possibility of, obtaining compensation,
 rather than hasten it.  Velasco has stated that he
 "will know what to do" if the US imposes the sanctions.

 which would crystallize the hard-line positions of

 all involved.  Velasco would in all probability in-
 crease economic controls                                          harass US business inter-
 ests, and perhaps take some diplomatic moves against
 the US--reducing or breaking relations and/or attack-
 ing the US action in some international forum.  Close
 cooperation with Velasco, on the other hand, would con-
 vince him that he need make no concession to reach an
 agreement and would, at the same time, undermine
 whatever opposition might be building against him.
 36.   The Velasco government is gradually moving
 toward more state control of the economy and the society.
 If the US imposes economic sanctions against Peru,
 the likelihood is that Velasco will use the opportunity
 to consolidate his position further and perhaps take
 advantage of the psychological reaction in Peru to
 impose greater control over the society and economy
 as a whole.   In addition, the more radical elements
 in the government, including Ruiz Eldredge and his
 colleagues, would have an opportunity to increase
 their influence at the expense of the moderates.
 In other words, the action/reaction process that
 could be touched off by the announced application
 of the economic sanctions might result in a situation
 in which the Peruvian Government was rapidly carried
 beyond what anyone other than a few extreme leftists
 now envisage as the ultimate goals for social and
 economic reform.   An extension of negotiations, on
 the other hand, would not stop nor even slow the
 process now going on, but neither would it provide
 the opportunists with the ammunition they need to
 take control more completely and pursue their goals.
 37.  Invocation of the Hickenlooper and Sugar
 Act Amendments would not be likely to cause critical
 short-run economic problems for Peru.   Because of the
 success of the administration's austerity program,
 the Peruvian economy should be able to absorb the
 additional short-run impact of actual sanctions.
 It should'be able to do so, moreover,. without finding
 it economically necessary to take retaliatory actions
 which would adversely affect much-needed foreign in-
 vestment.  The relative price stability and improvement
 in foreign reserves thus far achieved gives the Peru-
 vian Government considerable flexibility in its eco-
 nomic policy options during the remainder of 1969.

 The government could choose to adhere rigidly to the
 stabilization program in order to accumulate foreign
 reserves at a rapid rate.   On the other hand, the
 government is in a position to adopt more expansion-
 ary programs, although at some cost in reserves and
 a resurgence of a degree of inflationary pressure.
 At this point, it should be possible for the Peru-
 vian authorities to inject a degree of liquidity
 into the economy sufficient to maintain output, and
 perhaps achieve some growth, without driving the
 rate of inflation to a damaging level, at least in
 the short run.   The Peruvian Government now appears
 to be moving toward the adoption of this alternative.
 The effects of the sanctions would be further miti-
 gated if, as seems probable, European and Japanese
 businessmen moved into any breach left, by US busi-
 ness.   Nevertheless, the sanctions would do serious
 damage to Peru's development prospects over the long
 term, even if the large US mining companies eventually
 decided to go ahead with some of their planned new
 investments rather than lose their concessions.
 38.   In the event that sanctions continue to
 be deferred, the US probably could exercise some in-
 fluence on the Peruvian Government if it selectively
 used its influence in the international lending in-
 stitutions and financial community to help Peru find
 financing for worthwhile projects.   Even in this case,
 however, the influence would be limited.   The US
 might occasionally be able to maneuver Peru into
 taking a. favorable or desired action, but it is ex-
 tremely unlikely that the US would under any circum-
 stances be able to persuade the Peruvian Government
 not to take some course of action that it had de-
 cided on.   The US could also expect to retain the
 selective Peruvian support in international forums,
 at least on subjects not directly related to US eco-
 nomic policy in Latin America.   On the other hand,
 if sanctions are invoked, the US would lose most, if
 not all, of its diplomatic influence on Peru.   Fur-
 thermore, the damage to relations between the two
 countries would be extremely difficult to repair,
 even given optimum circumstances over a long period
 of time

 The Hemisphere
 39.   The attitudes of Latin American govern-
 ments toward the US-Peru dispute have been ambiv-
 alent   from the beginning.   Each government has
 been and remains anxious to improve bilateral re-
 lations with the United States, particularly at a
 time when it sees the possibility of influencing
 the policies of a new administration in Washington.
 At the same time, most Latin Americans have a built-
 in tendency to side with the Latin American David
 in his struggles with the US Goliath.   No major
 Latin American government believed early this year
 that it could avoid publicly expressing sympathy
 with Peru if the situation developed into a clear-
 cut confrontation between Peru and the United States.
 40.  The announcement in early April that the
 United States would defer imposing sanctions on Peru
 was met with widespread relief in every Latin Ameri-
 can capital.   At least temporarily, it got them
 off the hook:   they would not be obliged to stand
 up and be counted.  Moreover, the US decision was
 widely considered a statesmanlike move demonstrat-
 ing that the United States was willing to make every
 effort to reach a satisfactory settlement.   In the
 weeks since the deferral announcement, Latin Ameri-
 can interest in the problem has dwindled.   Even in
 Argentina, where the case had been receiving wide-
 spread attention in the press and in government
 circles, the subject has largely disappeared from
 public view.
 41.  Most Latin Americans, in and out of govern-
 ment, recognize that the problem will probably again
 come to the fore and that it may well require them
 to be more forthright in their reactions.   Already,
 in Venezuela at least, the date of 6 August--when
 the current Peruvian administrative procedures on
 the IPC case expires--has, in the public eye, as-
 sumed the nature of a new "deadline" after which the
 US may be obliged to invoke sanctions.
 42.   Public statements by Latin American govern-
 ment leaders on the dispute have been rare in recent

 weeks, but privately many of them show full awareness
 of the potential seriousness of the problem.   In Chile,
 top government leaders are privately but strongly
 urging the United States to find some solution which
 does not include application of sanctions.   With the
 possible exception of the conservative National Party,
 all other political parties in Chile, including the
 Christian Democrats, tend to favor the Peruvian posi-
 tion.  The Frei government obviously fears being put
 into a position of having either to resist or to succumb
 to these strong pro-Peru pressures during this difficult
 political year in Chile.
 43.   In Mexico, too, the government is very
 anxious to avoid being caught in the middle of a
 controversy in which Mexico's sympathy with Peru
 as a Latin American country would conflict with its
 direct interest in maintaining friendly, cooperative
 relations with the United States.   Thus Mexican
 leaders would also favor some sort of bilateral ar-
 rangement between the US and Peru that would avoid
 sanctions.
 44.   The Argentine Government publicly expressed
 its  "solidarity" with Peru prior to the announcement
 that sanctions would be deferred.   It claimed that
 this was a necessary tactic in its effort to earn
 the trust of the Peruvian Government and thus per-
 mit it more effectively to use its influence in Lima
 in favor of moderation.  Privately, Argentine lead-
 ers have lamented the impasse, expressed their con-
 cern over the possibly serious consequences, and
 advised the United States to soft-pedal the threat
 of sanctions while quietly continuing talks with
 the Peruvians.
 45.   The Argentine Government, like many others,
 is strongly opposed in principle to the Hickenlooper
 Amendment.   The use of economic pressure by one
 country in the hemisphere in an attempt to force
 the compliance of another with its demands is anath-
 ema in Latin America--particularly in juridical
 circles.   The Latin Americans agreed to economic
 sanctions against Cuba only after it had been proven
 beyond the shadow of a doubt that Cuba had inter-
 vened militarily in Venezuela.   The principle has

 25X1
 bhUXEI
 Approved For Release   02/06/11 Sf5&RERfhT00827AO01 00010003-5
 even been written into the Charter of Bogota, which
 stipulates that no member state can apply coercive
 economic pressures to impose its will on another
 state or to obtain any advantage of any nature.
 46.  The duration and the extent of the reac-
 tion in Latin America to a decision by the US to in-
 voke sanctions against Peru would depend in large
 measure on the timing and the circumstances in which
 sanctions were applied.   If sanctions were applied in
 obvious response to a clear-cut Peruvian provocation,
 the reaction against the US would be less severe.   If
 they came suddenly and without apparent provocation,
 reaction would be more hostile to the United States.
 To most Latin Americans, the current trips of Gov-
 ernor Rockefeller are of far greater potential sig-
 nificance than the problem the US is having with
 Peru.   In many Latin American eyes, the US decision
 in the Peru case will be linked to the Rockefeller
 mission as an indication of coming US policy.
 47.   If the United States invokes sanctions:
 The reactions in the rest of Latin America would
 probably be most negative if sanctions were invoked
 during or in the immediate aftermath of the Rocke-
 feller visits.   Sanctions would probably be inter-
 preted as signifying that the new administration
 in Washington had adopted a "hard-line" in its re-
 lations with the rest of the hemisphere.   The US
 would be subjected to abuse from the press, in legis-
 latures, and from some government officials.   Most
 governments would feel obliged at least to express
 their public sympathy with Peru.   The effect, of
 course, might be mitigated if it could be made to
 appear that Peru had provoked the US action.
 48.   If sanctions are avoided and the compen-
 sation issue is strung out indefinitely:   Indefi-
 nite deferral of sanctions would clearly be the so-
 lution most preferred by the other Latin American
 governments.   Most governments would be relieved.
 Some, however, would interpret it as a sign of US
 "softness."   Even the temporary deferral last month
 prompted the Colombian foreign minister to say that
 he thought the US action might be interpreted as a
 sign of weakness.

 49.   Unless it were accompanied with some cred-
 ible rationale, an indefinite deferral of sanctions
 might well be interpreted in such countries as Ar-
 gentina, Brazil, and Mexico as a US capitulation.
 Moreover, it might well give pause to real and po-
 tential US investors in Latin America and tend to
 undermine the US position that it can be made worth-
 while for the US private sector to contribute to the
 economic development of Latin America.
 50.   If US economic pressures continue:   Con-
 tinuing, quiet US economic pressures on Peru would
 probably not greatly upset the Latin Americans.
 Many would prefer to ignore them.
 51.   If the US abandons the effort to secure
 settlement of the  is ute and moves toward c oser
 collaboration wit  Velasco:  -This-
 is would  e t e most
 puzzling action the US could take as far as the rest
 of Latin America is concerned.  Unless such a US
 turnabout were accompanied by some understandable
 explanation, most Latin Americans would regard it
 as outright capitulation to a government practicing
 blackmail.
 52.   To date there is no indication that any
 Latin American country has been encouraged by the
 Peru case to move toward nationalization of foreign
 investors.   In Chile, pressures on the copper com-
 panies have in recent days become much more strident,
 but the US Embassy is convinced that there is no re-
 lation to the Peru case and that any action Chile
 takes will be determined by the government's concept
 of Chile's national interests and by internal politi-
 cal pressures.
 53.   It is difficult to predict whether any long
 term "domino effect" might come from an apparent US
 capitulation to Peru.   It would be very unlikely to
 have any effect in the foreseeable future in Mexico,
 for instance, where the government has an active
 policy of promoting foreign investment and where the
 foreign investors feel completely secure.   In Venezu-
 ela,   and perhaps other countries, the IPC is con-
 sidered to have had a very unsavory history in Peru

 and, for that reason, a US "exception to the rule"
 might be considered justified and not signifying a
 lessening of the US resolve to protect its investors
 abroad.   In every Latin American country, any de-
 cision to nationalize foreign investors will be
 dictated to a much greater extent by the govern-
 ment's assessment of national interest.   The Peru
 example would be a subsidiary consideration at best.
 54.   If Peru should formally charge the United
 States with "economic aggression" in some interna-
 tional body, all Latin American governments would
 feel obliged to offer some support to Peru.  Most,
 however, would try to avoid being put on the spot.
 As in the recent CECLA conference in Santiago, they
 would probably try to work out some form of "compro-
 mise resolution" which went as far as possible in
 support of Peru without unnecessarily offending the
 United States.   In such circumstances, however, it
 would be unrealistic for the United States to expect
 active backing from any Latin American country.

 USSR keeps his armed forces well supplied.
 His relations with Moscow have improved.
 Exiles do not constitute a threat.
 He has moderated his efforts to export revolution--
 partly to please Russia and the orthodox Latin
 American Communists, but mainly because of
 failures--particularly Guevara's in Bolivia.
 Castro's biggest immediate problems are economic----
 mismanagement,  inefficiency, low productivity,
 labor shortages and natural disasters combined.
 1970 goal for sugar crop is 10 million tons.   This
 year's will be below 5 million, next year's

 I.   Fidel Castro is firmly in control of Cuba.
 A.    His power position is based on the loyalty
 of key officials in the military and security
 forces and in the Cuban Communist Party.
 1.   Senior military officers4most of them
 veterans of Castro's 26th of July Move-
 ment-;-comprise about two-thirds of the
 party's Central Committee, and dominate
 almost all other public institutions.
 B.   Despite his increased demands for harder
 work, austerity, and the unpopular reforms
 of 1968, Castro probably still has the support
 of a majority of the population.
 C.   Activities by Cuban exiles pose no threat to
 the stability of the Castro regime.   A ten-man
 team of exiles bent on sabotage was wrapped
 up in less than six days early last month;  a
 similar group met the same fate last December.

 headache.
 A.  Troubles arising from mismanagement,  inef-
 ficiency, low labor productivity, and short-
 ages of workers for agriculture have been
 aggravated by a series of natural disasters.
 B.  In 1967, Cuba's GNP was only about 15 percent
 higher than in the highest pre-revolution
 year--1957.   In that ten year period, however,
 there was a 20 percent increase in the Cuban
 population.   In 1968, because of the drought,
 the GNP undoubtedly declined and is not ex-
 pected to recover significantly this year.
 C.    The outlook in the crucial area of sugar
 production is not good.
 1.  This year's harvest, which was meant to
 be a dress rehearsal for the planned ten
 million ton crop in 1970, will be about
 half a million tons below last year's poor
 crop of only slightly more than 5 million tons.
 2.  The 1970 yield, moreover, will probably be no
 greater than 7.5 to 8 million tons.   If it
 sinks below 7 million tons, Castro will be
 hard pressed to shrug off the complete fail-
 ure of the goal of 10 million tons he has

 pushed dramatically and unequivocally for
 the past four years.
 III.    Castro's armed forces are in good shape.   The
 Cuban military establishment is the most modern,
 the best trained, and best equipped in Latin
 America.   It could successfully defend the island
 from any attack short of an invasion with U.S.  support.
 A. The Cubans depend primarily on Soviet-supplied
 arms and equipment.   From September 1966 to
 February 1968, an average of two major mili-
 tary shipments per month were received from
 the USSR, in a campaign to update and resupply
 the military services.   There have been no
 major arms deliveries in the past 15 months,
 but the armed forces are at satisfactory levels
 of readiness and proficiency.

 IV.    During the 20 months since the death of Che
 Guevara, Cuba has modified its tactics and
 priorities for "exporting" the revolution in
 Latin America.
 A.   Castro has withdrawn from the aggressive
 approach he pursued in 1966-67,/"has toned
 down Cuban propaganda, and has allowed front
 groups like the Latin American Solidarity
 Organization to lapse into virtual dormancy.
 He has almost completely ignored themes of
 revolution in his speeches during this period.
 B.    Castro is more cautious because of the repeated
 failures of guerrilla groups he has supported,
 and because he may realize that Cuban inter-
 ference-and bullying have contributed to
 their factionalism and impotence.
 1.   He was stunned by the failure of Che
 Guevara in Bolivia, and in retrospect
 probably recognized the hopelessness of
 the campaign as it was revealed in
 Guevara's diary.
 C.     Cuba-continues to train Latin Americans in
 guerrilla techniques, but more selectively
 than in the past, and Castro has not renounced

 the principle of armed revolution as an
 instrument of his foreign policy.
 V.      Cuban relations with the USSR have improved con-
 siderably since last August when Castro endorsed
 the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
 A.  This January, Castro had warm and unequivocal
 praise for Moscow for the first time in three
 years, even though massive Soviet economic
 support had continued without interruption
 in the interim.
 B.  Another indication of the improved state of
 affairs is Havana's decision to send a high-
 level delegation of observers to the Communist
 Party Conference in Moscow this month.   Soviet-
 CubanCrelations may'now be better than at any
 time since Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power.
 C.   Castro probably hopes that if he appears more
 compliant, Moscow will increase its aid to
 Cuba significantly.
 D.   Cuba's relations with Peking have been ex-
 tremely cool since early 1966.   Havana's
 decision to attend the Moscow conference and
 its warm praise earlier this month for the Soviet
 border guard will hardly improve the situation.

 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 The Current Situation in Cuba
 Summary
 After a decade in power, Fidel Castro rules Cuba
 absolutely through a totalitarian personal apparatus.
 The military and security forces, under the control
 of Fidel's younger brother Raul, are well trained,
 well equipped, and effective in identifying and elim-
 inating opposition to the regime.   The officer corps--
 especially the senior majors who are veterans of Cas-
 tro's 26th of July Movement--is the main buttress of
 the regime.   In addition, several other groups are
 important factors for stability. Most youths, stu-
 dents, and peasants, large segments of the urban work-
 ing groups, and the activist members of the mass or-
 ganizations provide Castro with a large constituency.
 Finally, the government's complete control of all pub-
 lic information media, Fidel Castro's political skills,
 and his ability to charm his countrymen are important
 factors upholding his dictatorship.
 Cuba's current problems stem in large measure
 from the ragged performance of the economy.   Despite
 shortages of almost every kind since 1961 and consid-
 erable fluctuations in the economy, however, output
 has tended to increase slightly.   In 1967 Cuba's GNP
 was only about 15 percent higher than in 1957  (the
 best prerevolution year).   In 1968, moreover, under-
 lying economic problems were aggravated by severe
 drought and harsh, puritanical reforms.   Gains in
 agricultural production early this year have appar-
 ently caused an upturn to 1967 levels, but longer

 range economic growth is uncertain.   This year's
 sugar harvest, which was meant to be a dress re-
 hearsal for the planned 10-million-ton harvest
 next year, may not exceed last year's output of
 5.2 million tons.   Thus, while it is still possible
 for Castro to produce a record crop in 1970, it al-
 most certainly will not exceed 8 million tons,  far
 short of his objective of 10 million.
 Cuban-Soviet relations improved following Cas-
 tro's endorsement of the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
 In January Castro warmly praised Moscow for the
 first time in about three years.   Castro probably
 believes that by associating Cuba more closely with
 the USSR he will gain expanded economic and techni-
 cal aid.   Castro's more moderate approach in Latin
 America has also contributed to better relations
 with Moscow.   Since the death of Che Guevara a year
 and a half ago, Cuba has modified its tactics and
 priorities for "exporting" the revolution.

 The Military Establishment
 1.   During the decade that Castro has been in
 power, his position has been firmly anchored by the
 military and security forces through a number of
 senior officers who are veterans of his 26th of July
 Movement.   Senior officers comprise about two thirds
 of the central committee of the Cuban Communist Party,
 and military men make up at least  one  fifth of the
 party membership.   The two civilians on the eight-
 man politburo are outnumbered by Fidel and Raul Cas-
 tro and four other army majors.   During 1968 at
 least six high-ranking officers were appointed by
 the politburo as plenipotentiary delegates to direct
 provincial and regional affairs, and another was
 placed in charge of the construction industry.   Thus
 the party, originally constituted with a wide repre-
 sentation of military and civilian leaders, is under
 the exclusive control of Castro and a personal en-
 tourage of army majors.
 2.   These same men dominate almost all other
 public institutions and mass organizations through
 the party.     In 1968 the military were responsible
 for mobilizing tens of thousands of civilians for
 the sugar harvest and other agricultural work.   This
 year the Ministry of the Armed Forces is directing
 the harvest.   During the past two years the military
 also assumed complete control of civil aviation and
 began the reorganization of preuniversity education.
 3.   The military have become the supreme insti-
 tutional force, probably because the officer corps
 is the only organized element that Castro completely
 trusts.     The officer corps consists of about 200 ma-
 jors                           (the highest military rank)  and an unknown num-
 ber of captains and junior officers.   Most of the
 latter were commissioned after Castro came to power,
 and although they are not members of the 26th of July
 group, they have been subjected to extensive political
 indoctrination and military discipline and are loyal
 to the regime.   No Cuban military officer on active
 duty has defected to the US in several years, although
 a few noncommissioned officers and some conscripts
 have defected via the Guantanamo Naval Base.

 4.   Because most of the senior majors are simple,
 unsophisticated men who may be uncomfortable with the
 power they have acquired, and because they are devoted
 to Castro,  few of them are considered politically am-
 bitious.   Field commanders are rotated regularly, and
 Raul Castro and his deputy minister of the armed forces
 conduct frequent field tours.   The loyalties of Cas-
 tro's colleagues clearly transcend the ideological and
 the political.   Very few were exposed to Marxist-Len-
 inist thought before 1959, and even now their ideo-
 logical commitments are probably shallow.   So deep is
 their personal commitment to Castro, however, that the
 cult of his personality has become for them an ideology.
 Castro's Popularity
 5.   Fidel Castro has consistently been able to
 maintain the support of a majority of the population.
 He has made full use of his charm and political adroit-
 ness and the effective propaganda machine he controls.
 In addition, he has encouraged the departure of his
 opponents and critics.   Since 1959 between 500,000
 and 700,000 Cubans have left the island;  about 1,000
 leave each week on the Varadero-Miami airlift.   Many
 others have left in small boats, on refugee flights
 to Spain and Mexico, or via "fence jumping" at the
 US Navy base at Guantanamo.   Most legal refugees have
 been middle aged or elderly and former members of
 the middle and upper classes.
 6.   As a result of this steady migration of the
 disenfranchised and the high rate of population
 growth, the groups most favored and benefited by
 Castro have become larger in proportion to the rest
 of the population.   The median age has steadily de-
 clined;  in January 1969, an estimated 55 percent of
 the population was under 25.   The oldest of these
 were only 14 when Castro came to power, and they
 have been subjected ever since to an intense and ef-
 fective propaganda assault.
 7.   Their loyalty to the regime has also been
 encouraged by special privileges and endowments.
 All education is free.   Tuition charges have been
 eliminated, and textbooks--when available--are pro-
 vided by the government.                                 About 300,000 scholarship

 students are provided free room and board, clothing,
 medical care, and a monthly allowance.   In ten years
 the government has doubled the number of both schools
 and students.   As wards of the state, students are
 spared many of the hardships of rationing and food
 shortages.   They do not have to wait in queues for
 food, or supplement their rations by covertly pa-
 tronizing the black market.   Thus favored, the stu-
 dents are probably overwhelmingly in accord with
 Castro.
 8.   As the military has expanded its role, and
 as a result of the radical and puritanical reforms
 imposed last year, the morale of some of the older
 youths has deteriorated.   Many of them are school
 dropouts and former students who have become disaf-
 fected because of the drop in their standard of liv-
 ing after leaving school.   In addition, because of
 the oversupply of labor for nonagricultural work,
 many have become idle. Their expectations rose dur-
 ing their school years, and they are disappointed
 to find few job opportunities outside of agriculture.
 Last September Castro criticized such youths for be-
 ing "hippies and loafers" and sent several hundred
 of them off to the fields.   More than 30,000 other
 youths between the ages of 17 and 27 were inducted
 last year for three-year hitches in agricultural
 work under military discipline.
 9.   Although a growing number of youths out of
 school seem disenchanted with the regime, most of
 them probably still support it.   They have been sub-
 jected to propaganda for a decade, and have little
 objective knowledge of the rest of the world.   Most
 of them are probably convinced that they are better
 off under Castro than they would have been under
 previous administrations; in any case they can see
 no alternative.   The older youths, however, seem
 more cynical in judging Castro and the accomplish-
 ments of the revolution than do the youths in school.
 As a result, one of the major problems for Castro's
 government during the next few years will be to cre-
 ate satisfactory employment for them and to maintain
 their motivation and loyalty at the level of their
 school years.

 10.   In addition to the military caste and the
 youth, the peasants and some urban working elements
 have been the most favored groups in Cuba.              They
 were the first beneficiaries of Castro's reforms.
 Unskilled and semiskilled workers received pay
 raises and other benefits that augmented their pur-
 chasing power.   Unemployment and underemployment
 were reduced, and large numbers of agriculture
 workers migrated to better paying jobs in industry
 and construction.   As expenditures for public con-
 sumption increased, they experienced an advance in
 their standards of living.   Programs in health, edu-
 cation, and welfare benefited those who could not
 afford these services before the revolution.
 Discontent
 11.   Shortages of food and consumer goods, and
 the radical and puritanical reforms imposed last
 year, however, caused some deterioration of Castro's
 popularity even among the groups he has most favored.
 In March 1968 he announced a harsh "revolutionary
 offensive" to restore "momentum" to the revolution
 and to impose more austere conditions for greater
 productivity.   He closed all bars and nightclubs in
 Cuba, reduced beer production, outlawed gambling and
 cockfighting, mobilized tens of thousands of civil-
 ians into agricultural work brigades, further up-
 graded the military over the civilian bureaucracy,
 and nationalized more than 57,000 small private
 businesses.   Castro railed against "cafe pundits"
 and "barroom philosophers," and insisted that city
 dwellers and youths perform "volunteer" agricultural
 work.   In addition, mainly because of the severe
 drought of 1967,  food shortages increased last year,
 and the list of rationed goods was expanded.   Since
 January 1969 even sugar has been rationed.
 12.   As a result of such shortages and auster-
 ity, there has been an increase in dissatisfaction
 and in the number of(isolated) acts of sabotage and
 vandalism.   Last year there were almost twice as
 many "fence jumpers" at the Guantanamo Naval Base
 as in 1967, and the same high rates have continued

 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2002/06/11 : CIA-RDP79T00827AO01800010003-5
 this year.*   High crime rates have apparently also
 continued, but the regime has not resorted to harsh
 crackdowns or wide-ranging social and economic re-
 forms like those of 1968.   Recent speeches by Presi-
 dent Dorticos and Sergio del Valle, who as minister
 of interior is chief of Cuba's internal security ap-
 paratus, indicate that the increase in crime and
 dissidence does not pose a significant political
 challenge to the government.   They revealed that ad-
 ministrative and legal reforms will be undertaken to
 counteract criminal activities and to reduce the con-
 ditions that contribute to the frustrations of many
 Cubans.   Increased food production this year may also
 ease some hardships and reduce crime and dissatisfac-
 tion.
 13.   Despite some fluctuations in morale, how-
 ever, Castro probably retains the hard-core support
 of large majorities of the youth, peasants, and vari-
 ous working class groups.   No organized resistance
 to Fidel is known to exist inside Cuba.
 Economic Problems
 14.   After an initial period of growth and ex-
 pansion, the Cuban economy has stagnated, despite
 the annual infusion of some $350 million in Soviet
 subsidies and credits.   In 1967, the year of highest
 output since Castro came to power, Cuba's estimated
 GNP was only 15 percent higher than in 1957  (the
 highest prerevolution year).   In that ten-year per-
 iod, however, there was a 20-percent increase in
 the Cuban population, resulting in a 15- to 20-per-
 cent decline in per capita consumption.   In 1968,
 moreover, the GNP declined further mainly because
 of serious drought and economic disruptions.
 15.   Economic stagnation results from a vari-
 ety of factors, many of which are direct outgrowths
 of the rapid and disruptive nationalization under-
 taken during the first few years of the revolution.
 'There were few defectors from Cuba via the Guan-
 tanamo Naval Base before 1965.   Figures since then
 are as follows:   1965-36,  1966-138,  1967-511,  1968-
 1005, Jan - 20 April 1969-315.

 Approved For Release 2002/06/11SW~2DP79T00827A001800010003-5
 Fundamental to all of these factors, however, is
 the inefficiency and disorganization of the new
 managerial class.   Most white-collar workers are
 inexperienced and poorly educated, and political
 reliability has long been the main criterion for
 their employment.
 16.   The antibureaucracy drives and adminis-
 trative purges of the last few years seriously dis-
 rupted government ministries and agencies, and their
 efficiency is further reduced as they are forced to
 provide personnel for "voluntary" agricultural work.
 Even more disruptive, however, have been the mass
 mobilizations of office workers to help in the sug-
 ar harvest.   Management is also weak because the
 strictly centralized system of administration stifles
 initiative and reduces the effectiveness of lower
 level managers.
 17.   Another important reason for economic
 failure and managerial confusion is the frequency
 with which economic plans and national priorities
 have changed during the last decade.   Many short-
 range programs also have been expensive fiascos be-
 cause they were undertaken impulsively.
 18.   A shortage of agricultural labor and a
 surplus of white-collar workers add to the problems
 causing the economy to stagnate.   The problem wors-
 ens yearly, moreover, as the schools graduate tech-
 nically skilled students who prefer to shun manual
 labor.   Severe drought during four of the last
 eight years has also caused serious difficulties.
 Finally, the US trade embargo has forced Cuba to
 import large amounts of capital goods to replace
 US-built machinery and equipment for which spare
 parts are no longer available.   This has further
 restricted Cuba's ability to import other needed
 goods.
 Economic Outlook
 19.   In his speech on 2 January 1969, Castro
 was ebullient and confident, predicting that many
 of the economic goals for 1970 will be fulfilled.
 He was probably correct in appraising the various
 Approved For Release 2002/06/1AEeklf 79T00827A001800010003-5
 Approved For Release 2002/06/115    128; 9T00827A001800010003-5
 factors that point to some economic recovery this
 year even though he has been highly critical of
 this year's sugar harvest.   Rainfall has been nor-
 mal, large quantities of fertilizer have been used,
 and the military can probably organize and manage
 the economy more authoritatively and rationally
 than the civilian bureaucrats.   These factors and
 the high price of sugar on the world market could
 result in further improvements in 1970.
 20.   During the first half of 1969, output will
 probably be higher than it was last year without re-
 gaining the level of 1967.   Fruit and vegetable crops
 will probably increase, and meat and dairy products
 and other foodstuffs should be in greater supply.
 Furthermore, although it is not likely that Castro's
 oft-mentioned goal of 10 million tons of sugar will
 be milled in 1970, Cuba may be able to produce a
 record crop even though this year's harvest may not
 exceed the 5.2 million tons produced in 1968.
 21.   Gains in sugar output, however, may be
 offset by disruptions elsewhere in the economy be-
 cause large numbers of workers will be diverted from
 their regular work to cut cane.   It is still too
 early to determine to what extent gains made in the
 economy this year will benefit the consumer.   In the
 past Castro has exported food commodities to earn
 foreign exchange while rationing them at home.   In
 addition, per capita gains will be partially offset
 by population growth.
 22.   Long-range economic growth is uncertain.
 Plans have centered on agricultural diversification
 and increased sugar production, but a number of prob-
 lems must be resolved before production goals can be
 fulfilled.   Castro has attempted to remedy the acute
 shortage of regular agricultural workers by investing
 heavily in machinery and by propagandizing the joys
 of rural life.
 23.   These efforts may stimulate agricultural
 output over the next few years.   The USSR has ex-
 tended large credits to support Castro's vigorous
 effort to expand and renovate Cuba's sugar industry
 and distribution system.   By late 1968 Cuba's

 Approved For Release 2002/06/11 `CfA=  AT00827A001800010003-5
 indebtedness to the USSR for economic aid totaled
 $1.8 billion.   Since 1961 Havana has also received
 military assistance and equipment worth more than
 $700 million.   Without more rational and professional
 management and planning, however, the Cuban economy
 will probably fluctuate without achieving a lasting
 and significant rate of growth.
 Cuba,  the USSR,  and Latin America
 24.   Castro's preoccupation with domestic problems
 during the last year and a half, and the moderation of
 Cuban tactics and priorities for "exporting" the revo-
 lution in Latin America, have contributed to a con-
 siderable improvement in Cuban-Soviet relations.   The
 watershed apparently was reached last August when Cas-
 tro publicly supported the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
 Since then relations have continued to improve, and
 in January, for the first time in about three years,
 Castro warmly and unequivocally praised Moscow.   He
 probably hopes that Moscow will increase economic and
 technical assistance to such an extent that significant
 economic gains can be made by the end of next year.
 With this in mind, Castro might now be willing to send
 a high-level delegate to the June meeting of world
 Communist parties if he were to feel confident that
 he would not have to be a partner in a specific de-
 nunciation of Peking.
 26.   Since the death of Che Guevara a year and a
 half ago, Castro has withdrawn from the extreme and
 violent approach he pursued in 1966-67.   He has not
 attempted to initiate new areas of insurgency, has
 toned down Cuban propaganda, and has allowed front groups
 like the Latin American Solidarity Organization to lapse

 into dormancy.   During this time he has almost com-
 pletely ignored themes of revolution in his oratory.
 27.   Castro's caution is a result of a variety
 of pressures and realizations.   He was stunned by
 Guevara's rapid defeat in Bolivia;  in retrospect he
 probably recognized the quixotic hopelessness of the
 campaign as it was revealed in Guevara's field diary.
 Castro has been repeatedly discouraged by the failures
 of guerrilla groups he has supported, and may realize
 that Cuban interference and bullying have contributed
 to their factionalism and impotence.   He seems to have
 grown more pessimistic about the prospects of revolu-
 tion in Latin America and about Cuba's ability to be
 the decisive influence.
 28.   In any case Castro is apparently disen-
 chanted or at odds with the groups he has supported
 in Guatemala, Venezuela, and Colombia, and he prob-
 ably does not believe that conditions in most other
 counties are right for armed struggle.   At least
 until the end of next year's sugar harvest, there-
 fore, he is not likely to take a significant part
 in new guerrilla initiatives or introduce any siz-
 able escalation in Cuban support of existing groups.
 The Cuban intelligence service will probably con-
 tinue a selective guerrilla training program, and
 Castro will probably adhere generally to the concept
 of guerrilla action, but he is likely to step  in
 only if Cuban support is desired and when he be-
 lieves it could be decisive.
 Prospects  for Castro's Tenure
 29. There is no evidence of organized opposi-
 tion to Castro and his regime.   Whatever course
 Castro follows, he seems likely to retain the hard-
 core support of the groups he has favored.   They
 realize that they are better off than they were be-
 fore, and they see no alternative to him.
 30.   By ceding greater responsibility to his
 followers in the military and security forces, Cas-
 tro has granted supreme institutional power to the
 group that is most loyal to him.   As long as this

 group remains loyal, Castro can deal with threats
 to his position from any other internal source or
 combination of internal forces.   Any threat to him
 from this group would also have to be against his
 brother, Raul.   It is unlikely that Raul would take
 part in any move against Fidel.
 31.   If a significant number of majors were to
 become convinced that Fidel was either mentally or
 physically unable to rule and that Raul could not
 be separated from his brother, they could conceiv-
 ably attempt to limit Fidel's power.   At 42, how-
 ever, Castro is in robust health.    There is little
 chance that any plot against his regime--none is
 known now to exist--could succeed in the foresee-
 able future.
