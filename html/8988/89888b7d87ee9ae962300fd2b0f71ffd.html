 Overview
 Information available
 as of 10 April 1984
 was used in this report.
 China: Deng's
 Political System-
 An Uncertain Future
 Deng Xiaoping sees the question of succession as not simply a matter of
 men but of institutions and policies as well. Reform of the political
 system-the structure of power and the policy process-has preoccupied
 Deng since his return to power.
 Deng wants to prevent the emergence of another Mao Zedong and a
 repetition of the Cultural Revolution. A more important objective is to
 modernize China's political system to meet the needs of economic modern-
 ization. Deng's ultimate goal is to provide steady, predictable rule through
 a professional bureaucracy.
 We believe that, despite major obstacles and setbacks, Deng and his allies
 have made some progress toward their political reform goals:
 ? China's leadership has become more collective.
 ? Factional struggle has diminished.
 ? The policy process has become more professional.
 ? There has been some improvement in the quality of the bureaucracy.
 But important aspects of China's political system have not changed:
 ? It remains highly centralized and authoritarian.
 ? The Chinese Communist Party continues to monopolize power.
 ? Power remains vested more in individuals than in institutions.
 ? The bureaucracy continues to work poorly, especially at provincial and
 local levels.
 In his efforts to reform China's political system, Deng has:
 ? Attempted to institutionalize collective leadership.
 ? Re-created the party Secretariat to play the central role in policymaking.
 ? Sought to rejuvenate and professionalize the leadership.
 ? Advocated a rational division of labor between the party, the govern-
 ment, and the economic sector.
 ? Promoted (for a time) a greater degree of "democracy" and freedom in
 China.
 Because of strong opposition, the process of reform has been slow, erratic,
 and subject to frequent compromise.

 A key to the future will be the balance between innovators and reformers
 and more conservative elements in China's leadership. China could develop
 into a highly centralized and orthodox bureaucratic state along the lines of
 the Soviet Union. China could also become a more pluralistic, although
 still highly controlled, society combining Marxist, Chinese, and even
 Western traditions. A third possibility, in our view the most likely, is a
 muddled outcome, in which authoritarian politics coexist uneasily with
 more liberal, decentralized economic policies.
 A darker course is possible, especially if Deng were to die soon. Should the
 successor leadership turn out to be weak, a conservative military-civilian
 coalition might then take over and lead a backlash against many of the re-
 forms promoted by Deng over the past few years.
 Addressing the 12th Party Congress in September 1982, Deng disclosed a
 new awareness of the long time it takes for successful political reform in
 China. It will now take at least until the end of this century, Deng
 admitted, to achieve his ambitious reform goals. We agree. Even under the
 best of circumstances, the task of modernizing China's political system will
 be slow, protracted, arduous, and uncertain.

 China: Deng's
 Political System-
 An Uncertain Future
 If we wait any longer before perfecting our socialist
 system, people will ask, "How come the socialist
 system cannot solve those problems which the capi-
 talist system can?"
 Deng Xiaoping
 18 August 1980
 To Deng Xiaoping, the question of succession is not
 simply a matter of men but of institutions and policies
 as well. Reform of the political system-the structure
 of power and the policy process-has preoccupied
 Deng since his return to power.
 Deng's reforms are intended to restore the faith of the
 Chinese people in "socialism," a faith badly shaken by
 Mao Zedong's despotic rule and the chaos of the
 Cultural Revolution. When Mao died in 1976, his
 political legacy was a Communist party split into
 warring factions, a bureaucracy in shambles, and a
 cynical and disillusioned population. Reforming Chi-
 na's political institutions to prevent the emergence of
 another Mao and the repetition of another Cultural
 Revolution is a major objective of Deng's program. F_
 A second important objective is reform of the political
 system to meet the needs of modernization. Since his
 return to power in December 1978, Deng has insisted
 that administrative reform-establishing a rational,
 efficient bureaucracy characterized by functional spe-
 cialization, clear lines of authority, formal rules, and
 officials selected for competence-is essential for
 China's economic modernization. Paralleling adminis-
 trative reform, Deng has called for a fundamental
 restructuring of China's economic system featuring
 decentralization of decisionmaking and increased reli-
 ance on market forces to increase efficiency and
 productivity.
 Setting forth ambitious goals is one thing, however,
 and their achievement, another. Political reform has a
 long history of failure, in both pre- and postrevolu-
 tionary China. Already, there has been a significant
 reduction in the pace and scope of Deng's political
 Deng Xiaoping-
 China's paramount leader
 Overconcentration of power in Mao's political system
 resulted in extreme dictatorship and the disastrous
 policy errors of the Great Leap Forward and the
 Cultural Revolution. Overconcentration of power in
 one individual, Deng has acknowledged, is deeply
 rooted in Chinese culture. It has also been reinforced
 by the Leninist political system China inherited from
 the Soviet Union. To prevent this from happening
 again, Deng Xiaoping has attempted to institutional-
 ize collective leadership as a key element in his reform
 program.
 The New Constitutions
 Deng has relied heavily on the promulgation of new
 party and state constitutions to institutionalize collec-
 tive leadership in China. Reliance on constitutions to
 bring about change, however, has never worked in
 China. There have been nine constitutions (party and
 state) since 1949 and none has basically altered the
 way China is ruled.

 General Secretary Hu Yaobang-Deng's chosen
 successor
 To help prevent the reemergence of another Mao, the
 new party constitution adopted in September 1982
 abolishes the post of party chairman and forbids any
 form of personality cult. It stipulates further that no
 party leader is allowed to make decisions on major
 issues on his own, or place himself above the party
 organization.
 To broaden the base of authority, the new constitution
 mandates that the party's General Secretary (Hu
 Yaobang's new title) be joined on the Politburo
 Standing Committee by three other top party office-
 holders: the Chairman of the Military Commission of
 the Central Committee, the First Secretary of the
 Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and
 the Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission.
 Although it is not required by the constitution, the
 state Premier also sits on this committee; thus, all
 major institutions of power-the party, the govern-
 ment, and the military-are now represented on the
 highest decisionmaking organ in China, the Politburo
 Standing Committee.
 Another institutional check on the power of the party
 leader appears in the new state constitution (approved
 December 1982) that establishes the State Central
 Military Commission. This state organ is tasked with
 "directing the armed forces," and its creation removes
 the party leader from direct command over China's
 military forces. The Army has received assurances,
 moreover, that all future chairmen of the party's
 Military Commission will be selected on the basis of
 military experience.
 official guidance has also specified that the
 posts of Chairman of the Party Military Commission,
 Party General Secretary, and Premier hereafter will
 be filled by different individuals
 Decisionmaking
 The new party constitution, together with authorita-
 tive Deng pronouncements, spells out, moreover, how
 party committees are supposed to make policy. All
 major issues are to be discussed and decided collec-
 tively. In decisionmaking, one person will have one
 vote and the principle of the minority submitting to
 the majority will be strictly enforced. Once a decision
 has been made, it will be obeyed unconditionally and
 enforced vigorously in accordance with the principle
 of democratic centralism.
 Collective leadership will also be encouraged by mak-
 ing the meetings of the Politburo and its Standing
 Committee regular and routine. All offices of Politbu-
 ro members,                              are
 to be located in one building to facilitate quick
 response to calls for meetings. In addition, the agenda
 of Politburo meetings is to be more formal, with fixed
 calendar dates to discuss specific issues. Politburo
 Standing Committee meetings reportedly are now
 held weekly to avoid bureaucratic logjams.
 But all of this falls far short, we believe, of institution-
 alizing genuine collective leadership in China. Al-
 though information on the decisionmaking process
 remains vague, available evidence does indicate that
 power remains vested in individuals rather than insti-
 tutions. A strong party leader, such as Deng Xiao-
 ping, can still impose his authority and can sidestep
 official party and state structures and intrude wherev-
 er he wishes. Most major decisions (for example, the
 decisions to launch the recent anticrime and spiritual
 pollution campaigns) are still made by a very small

 group of elderly party leaders in the Politburo Stand-
 ing Committee. Despite all the talk about democracy
 and majority rule, China appears still firmly caught in
 the chains of Leninism, which depends on the boot of
 a strong man-Deng for now-to resolve conflict. F-
 Reestablishing the Secretariat
 Deng Xiaoping's most important party reform was his
 first-reestablishing the Secretariat in February
 1980. As outlined in major speeches by Deng, Chen
 Yun, and other top leaders at the time, re-creating the
 Secretariat was intended to bring about a major
 change in the institutional power structure of post-
 Mao China.
 A New Power Structure. The intent was to shift power
 in both the making and the execution of policy from
 the Politburo to the Secretariat. In a metaphor he
 would repeat many times, Deng asserted that the
 Politburo and its Standing Committee would now
 retreat to the second line (where it would concern
 itself with major policy issues) and the Secretariat
 would advance to the frontline (where it would handle
 the day-to-day work of the party). Deng stressed that
 the Secretariat would "handle everything ... the
 voluminous everyday work affecting the party, the
 government, the armed forces, the civilian population,
 the educational institutions, the workers, the peasants,
 the traders, the scholars, and the soldiers." As in the
 Soviet Union, the Secretariat would serve as the nerve
 center of China's political system.
 Another major purpose of this reform was to transfer
 power from the first generation of revolutionary lead-
 ers on the Politburo to their younger, more profession-
 al successors on the Secretariat. In contrast with the
 membership of the Politburo (some of whom are
 unsympathetic to Deng's reforms), the Secretariat is
 staffed by energetic, competent, and enthusiastic sup-
 porters of Deng's modernization program. The ulti-
 mate objective of political reform, as Deng pointed
 out at that time, is to put in place a successor
 generation of pragmatic leaders with specialized
 knowledge and expertise capable of directing China's
 modernization.
 Policymaking. Acting under the supervision of top
 party leaders (principally Deng Xiaoping and General
 Secretary Hu Yaobang), the Secretariat now plays the
 central role in the drafting of policy (see figure 1).
 Assisting in the formulation of policy are several
 research institutes attached to the Secretariat, most
 notably the Policy Research Office, the Foreign Poli-
 cy Research Group, and the Rural Policy Research      25X1
 for discussion and final decision.
 Center. Closely associated with these party organs are
 two nonparty bodies-the Chinese Academy of Social
 Science and the Chinese Academy of Sciences-
 containing China's most prestigious intellectuals,
 whom the Secretariat tasks when special expertise is
 required in the drafting of policy. Once major policy
 documents have been drafted, they are submitted to
 the Politburo Standing Committee-in. exceptional
 cases to a full or expanded plenum of the Politburo-
 After decisions are made, the Secretariat plays a
 leading role in supervising the implementation of
 policy. Acting with a broad mandate from the Polit-
 buro, the concentrated attention of individual secre-
 taries on specific areas of responsibility, and the
 ability to bring organizational pressure! to bear on
 officials, the Secretariat is uniquely equipped to get
 results in a cumbersome bureaucratic system that
 threatens to undermine China's modernization
 program.
 Composed of specialists with strong reform creden-
 tials and close ties with Deng Xiaoping and Hu
 Yaobang, the Secretariat has succeeded, we believe,
 in restoring a more professional, empirically based
 policymaking process in China. But making policy is
 25X1

 one thing and carrying it out is another. Although the
 Secretariat has had some success in prodding local
 leaders into compliance, a number of China's prov-
 inces                             continue to                                                 25X1
 resist Deng's policies. How to get China's massive
 party and state bureaucracy-which is full of old,
 poorly educated people who are resistant to change-
 to carry out Deng's reform program is a question that,
 we think, has defied solution.
 Grappling With Retirement
 Deng has indicated in numerous speeches that an
 issue high on his agenda is how to persuade China's
 elderly party leaders to retire in favor of younger,
 more competent successors. The problem with the

 first generation of revolutionary leaders, according to
 Deng, is that these leaders lack the energy, the
 knowledge, and the experience needed to modernize
 China.
 Originally, Deng had planned to rejuvenate the party
 leadership in two ways. The first way, disclosed in
 early drafts of the new party constitution, was to
 prescribe age and tenure limits for membership in the
 central, provincial, and local committees of the party.
 The second way, also appearing in the constitution,
 was to establish advisory committees at all levels of
 the party to which elderly party officials, having
 resigned their frontline leadership posts, could retire
 with dignity to provide counsel and advice to their
 successors.
 When the new party constitution was adopted at the
 12th Party Congress in September 1982, however, all
 the provisions limiting the age and tenure of party
 officials had been dropped. Alluding with surprising
 candor to the struggle over the retirement issue,
 Politburo member Hu Qiaomu (the principal drafter
 of the new constitution) stated in an interview after
 the party congress that "after repeated deliberations
 in the course of revising the party constitution ... it
 was finally decided that no definite restrictions would
 be set on the tenure of office for leading cadres."F-
 Another discordant note at the 12th Congress was the
 refusal of party elders in China's top leadership to
 retire to the Central Advisory Commission. Making a
 mockery of Deng's vaunted youth program, the new
 Politburo elected at the Congress was in fact older
 than its predecessor. By no longer talking about his
 own retirement, the 79-year-old Deng Xiaoping fur-
 ther undermines this program.
 Deng's plan to change the generational guard in the
 upper echelons of the party has, we think, failed. We
 believe that Deng underestimated the tenacity with
 which China's older officials would hold on to the
 power, prestige, and perks that go with high office in
 China. We think, moreover, that Deng has now been
 forced to compromise on the retirement issue and to
 recognize that the problem of China's elderly cadres
 will now take perhaps five to 10 years longer to
 resolve than he had originally estimated.
 A New Role for the Party?
 A prime cause of China's past failures, according to
 Deng in a key speech in August 1980, was overcon-
 centration of power in the Communist Party. Under
 Maoist rule, the party monopolized and intervened in
 everything. In order to prevent a repetition of the
 Cultural Revolution, it was necessary to inject checks
 and balances into China's political system. And in
 order to modernize, it was essential to establish a
 rational division of labor between the party, the
 government, and the economic sector.
 As spelled out by Deng's heir apparent, Hu Yaobang,
 at the 12th Party Congress, the party in its new role is
 supposed to focus on making policy and leave imple-
 mentation to skilled professionals in the government
 and economic sector. The party will continue to serve
 as ideological watchdog and make all decisions con-
 cerning the selection, allocation, supervision, and eval-
 uation of officials in China. But because the party is
 not an administrative or production organization, it
 should merely guide and supervise administrative
 leaders and economic managers in the exercise of
 their functions and powers and refrain from trying to
 take over.
 There is no evidence this theoretical division of labor
 has worked in practice and we doubt it will. There is
 abundant evidence that the party still makes all major
 policy decisions concerning government and economic
 work. In exercising leadership over administration
 and production, party officials continue to work close-
 ly with government and economic officials, who in
 nearly all cases are party members. All party mem-
 bers working in government organizations, economic
 enterprises, and institutions still have to submit to
 party leadership and carry out party policies. With
 the party authorized to make policy, provide leader-
 ship, stay in close touch, and manage the personnel in
 government and production, we think there is little
 doubt that it will continue to dominate the political
 system and run things in China.
 Indeed, the political system outlined by Deng Xiao-
 ping and Hu Yaobang strongly resembles the pre-
 Cultural Revolution system in China (see figure 2).

 Secret
 Based on the Leninist Soviet model, the party under
 this system is all powerful. There are no limits to
 party authority, no real separation of powers, and no
 checks and balances. The party has units inside every
 organization in society, and party power pervades all
 phases of life.
 Caught within this system, China's reformist party
 leaders face a fundamentally insoluble dilemma: how
 to restrain the exercise of power while continuing to
 monopolize it.                             reli-
 ance on constitutions and laws to limit party power
 (for example, the provision in the new State Constitu-
 tion that the Communist Party must uphold and obey
 the constitution has been greeted with derision by
 party cadres                      In a system
 that continues to concentrate power in the hands of a
 few leaders and stresses obedience to their decisions,
 there is understandably a widespread perception that
 laws are immaterial and constitutions irrelevant in
 'China.
 "Democratization"
 Another of Deng Xiaoping's political reforms has
 been a short-lived experiment with "democracy."
 Mao's harsh dictatorship, culminating in the Cultural
 Revolution left the Chinese people in a state of shock.
 Confronted by an alienated population, Deng felt it
 necessary to allow a greater degree of "democracy"
 and freedom in order to restore the confidence of the
 people in Chinese Communist rule and in "socialism."
 A major purpose of Deng's democratization program
 was therapeutic, an attempt to reassure both Chinese
 and foreigners that there would be no repetition of the
 Cultural Revolution. To prevent the abuse of power
 and safeguard civil rights, Deng promised to revitalize
 and strengthen the legal system-in effect, to estab-
 lish a rule of law in China. The problem was, as Deng
 admitted in a major Politburo speech in August 1980,
 that up to now the concept of a legal system has been
 weak in China, the customary practice being to
 regard the words of powerful leaders as law.
 A second purpose of Deng's proposal to expand
 "democracy" and freedom of expression was to stimu-
 late enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity in solving
 the many new problems encountered in China's mod-
 ernization. Still another was to provide a means of
 monitoring, criticizing, and bringing pressure to bear
 on Deng's opponents at all levels of the party bureau-
 cracy. Although epitomized by the "democracy wall"
 movement, there were other Dengist democratic re-
 forms during the high tide of reform in 1979 and
 1980: the popular election of delegates to county-level
 people's congresses; the election of workers' congress-
 es in factories; greater freedom for China's intellectu-
 als in literature and art; and, for a time, even
 authorization for disgruntled groups to openly petition
 state and party officials for redress of grievances.F_
 Instead of engendering popular support for the new
 Dengist regime, however, young Chinese activists
 used their newfound freedom to launch an attack on
 the party leadership and on the fundamentals of
 "socialism." Confronted with worker strikes, student
 protests, and growing social ferment, China's leaders
 became concerned that what was happening in Po-
 land-the ruled challenging their rulers-might also
 happen in China. Fearing loss of control, Deng con-
 ceded in an important speech in December 1980 that
 there had been too much democracy and freedom
 during the preceding two years and emphasized the
 need to uphold four basic principles-"socialism," the
 leadership of the party, Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought, and the dictatorship of the proletar-
 iat-to restore order in China.
 More recently, Deng has presided over a political and
 cultural crackdown-the spiritual pollution cam-
 paign-that has frightened China's intellectuals. Al-
 though the campaign was called off early this year,
 the concern for ideological conformity and social
 control that triggered it has not abated. The concur-
 rent crackdown on crime, in which (according to
 varying estimates) perhaps 5,000 were executed, many
 without trial, has further undermined confidence in
 the party's commitment to the rule of law. Because
 these crackdowns have taken place while Deng Xiao-
 ping continues to dominate the leadership, China's
 political system will remain, we believe, highly cen-
 tralized and authoritarian.

 The ultimate goal of Deng Xiaoping's political reform
 program is to establish a system of steady, predictable
 rule through a professional bureaucracy. Deng is
 convinced that political modernization under party
 auspices must accompany any real progress toward
 economic modernization.
 After 30 years of Maoist rule, China's bureaucracy is
 (in Deng's own words) "leftist, swollen, ill educated,
 old, and irresponsible." Deng's most frequent com-
 plaint is that of "irresponsible bureaucratism"-a
 bureaucratic system in which "people just read docu-
 ments ... nobody takes charge ... decisions which
 can be made very easily are deferred for half a year, a
 year, or are never made ... efficiency is very low ...
 the people are very unhappy." Cowed by the violence
 of the Cultural Revolution and whipsawed by fre-
 quent changes in policy, China's officials now routine-
 ly defer decisions to their superiors and take refuge in
 inactivity.
 An even more fundamental obstacle to reform, how-
 ever, is the centuries-old Chinese bureaucratic prac-
 tice of getting things done through "personal rela-
 tions" (guanxi) rather than through institutions. Even
 under the advantageous conditions of peace, national
 unity, and foreign assistance that obtained in the
 1950s, the Chinese Communists proved unable to
 escape the personalistic pattern of authority and
 factional behavior-which the Chinese term "feu-
 dal"-that have long characterized China's political
 life.
 Recognizing the enormous scope of the task, Deng in
 January 1982 called for a bureaucratic "revolution"
 in China. Starting with reform at the top, to be
 followed by the readjustment of leadership organs at
 intermediate and lower levels, Deng proposed to re-
 duce the size of the government bureaucracy by a
 fourth within two years. Some 5 million officials, most
 of them veteran cadres, would be affected. Only in
 this way, Deng asserted, would it be possible to
 promote younger, professionally competent cadres to
 positions of authority and get the effective leadership
 needed for China's modernization.
 Premier Zhao Ziyang-China's leading
 economic reformer
 Reform at the Top
 In March 1982, Premier Zhao Ziyang disclosed
 Deng's plan for reforming the central government
 bureaucracy. As indicated in Zhao's report, the pro-
 gram is intended to remedy the defects in structure,
 personnel, and workstyle responsible for the "intoler-
 able inefficiency" of China's bureaucracy.
 The Plan. To correct defects in organization, Zhao
 called for a drastic streamlining of the central
 bureaucracy:
 ? Reducing the number of ministries, commissions,
 and bureaus under the State Council by roughly
 one-half.
 ? Cutting personnel within the central government by
 one-third-some 200,000 positions.
 ? Allowing no more than two to four vice premiers,
 two to four vice ministers per ministry, and one or
 two deputy chiefs per department.
 In personnel reform, Zhao issued guidelines designed
 to rejuvenate and professionalize China's central
 leadership:
 ? Imposing an age limit of 65 for ministers and 60 for
 vice ministers and department chiefs.

 ? Stipulating that officeholders in the reconstructed
 bureaucracy must be qualified both politically and
 professionally (that is, both red and expert).
 To effect a change in workstyle, Zhao called for the
 establishment of a responsibility system in China's
 government administration as perhaps the central
 feature of his bureaucratic reform package. To do
 away with the endless delays and squabbling charac-
 teristic of China's top bureaucracy, Zhao directed
 each ministry, commission, and department to delin-
 eate clearly lines of authority and responsibility,
 including delegation of power to lower levels to expe-
 dite decisionmaking. The program appeared to get off
 to a smooth start, and in November 1982 Premier
 Zhao announced that "the basic restructuring" of
 China's national bureaucracy was complete (see
 table).
 One Year Later. Although the government table of
 organization has been redrawn and personnel have
 been cut somewhat, Deng's ambitious program to
 reform China's central bureaucracy is in trouble
 Veteran officials who monopolize the top
 leadership posts are still refusing to appoint younger,
 better educated, professional cadres to positions of
 authority. Lines of authority have not been drawn,
 systems of responsibility and accountability have not
 been established, and the power to make decisions has
 not been decentralized. The problem of irresponsible
 bureaucratism-defined as much talk, little action,
 and the dread of shouldering responsibility-remains.
 In danger of losing momentum, Beijing announced a
 "second stage" in its effort to reform the central
 bureaucracy in the spring of 1983. The list of objec-
 tives-rejuvenation of leadership, reduction in person-
 nel, improvement in political attitudes, and greater
 professionalism-suggested that a number of govern-
 ment departments had paid only lipservice to the
 reforms in the first stage of the reorganization. F_
 It was then disclosed that a new problem had
 emerged-overloading the central bureaucracy (now
 reduced in size) with the same burden of economic
 tasks as before. Because economic decentralization
 had not been carried out, bureaucratic reform had
 gotten ahead of and was out of step with economic
 reform in China.
 25X1
 25X1
 In September 1983,1                            a 25X1
 central directive ordered that restructuring of govern-
 ment organs cease until further notice.. The decision
 was necessary, Chinese officials disclosed, because the
 process of bureaucratic reform was disrupting the
 day-to-day operations of a number of government
 departments.
 Reform at Provincial and Local Levels
 Reorganization and streamlining of the provincial
 party and government bureaucracies, initiated in the 25X1
 spring of 1983, also appeared to get off to a smooth
 start. Following the same pattern as the restructuring
 of the national bureaucracy, the stated goals included
 reducing the number of offices and size of staffs,
 decreasing the average age, and raising the education-
 al level of the provincial leadership. Carried out under
 close central supervision, the results appeared initially
 to satisfy Beijing that its objectives had been met. 7
 We think, however, that the effort to reform the
 bureaucracy at provincial and local levels ultimately    25X1
 will be even less successful than in Beijing. Because
 ,central control diminishes, the bureaucracy becomes

 Approved For Release 2009/04/13: CIA-RDP85TOO31 OR0001 00070002-7
 more entrenched at each succeeding administrative
 level in China. In addition to the operation of personal
 networks (in which the protection and welfare of
 members comes first), factional alignments forged
 during the Cultural Revolution will continue, we
 believe, to undermine Beijing's reform program in a
 number of provinces
 Press articles indicate how seriously Beijing views the
 problem of provincial and local factionalism in China.
 These articles make it clear that:
 ? Factional alignments are still critical in personnel
 matters, with appointments often made on this basis
 rather than on professional merit.
 ? Policy issues are of secondary importance; the real
 differences between local factions are over personal-
 ities and old political scores.
 ? Factions continue to seek and receive the support of
 higher level officials, up to and including national
 figures. Patrons and clients work together to
 squeeze out "strangers" and promote
 "acquaintances."
 As the reorganization works its way down to the local
 level (scheduled to be completed in 1984), factional
 problems are likely, we think, to intensify.
 Initial guidelines for the three-year party "rectifica-
 tion" campaign just getting under way identify "fac-
 tionalists" as a main target of the purge. We think
 there is little doubt, however, that rectification will
 itself become a weapon in factional infighting and will
 not significantly advance the political reform effort at
 provincial and local levels in China.
 After 30 years of Maoist neglect, China under Deng
 Xiaoping's leadership has begun the formidable task
 of political and economic modernization. To accom-
 plish this, Deng is seeking to transfer power from
 those who made the revolution-the old guerrilla
 fighters and uneducated party faithful-to a younger,
 better educated generation of technocrats. China un-
 der Deng has entered a period of transition from
 revolutionary to bureaucratic Communism.
 Because Deng is attempting to redistribute power on a
 massive scale, his political reforms have been resisted
 in varying degrees by a large proportion of China's
 party and state cadres. Deng has encountered resist-
 ance from time to time from more conservative
 leaders in the Politburo, especially when the reforms
 he has promoted produce side effects that appear to
 threaten party rule or the basic principles of "social-
 ism." Because of strong opposition, the process of
 reform has been slow, erratic, and subject to frequent
 compromise.
 Despite major obstacles and setbacks, we think that
 Deng and his allies have made some progress toward
 their political reform goals. Compared with Maoist
 rule, China's leadership has become more collective;
 factional struggle has diminished; the policy process
 has become more professional, with decisions based
 more on merit; and there has been some improvement
 in the quality of the bureaucracy.
 Certain aspects of China's political system, however,
 have not changed. It remains highly centralized and
 authoritarian, with the Chinese Communist Party
 retaining a monopoly of power. Power remains vested
 more in individuals and personal networks than in
 institutions. The bureaucracy continues to work poor-
 ly, especially at provincial and local levels where
 footdragging, obstructionism, and factionalism under-
 mine the implementation of policy.
 Some Western observers believe that China's centu-
 ries-old tradition of rule by individual powerful men
 and personal networks will preclude development of
 the institutions and formal rules essential for modern-
 ization. Although recognizing the force of this cultur-
 al argument, we think that China will conform to the
 general pattern of industrializing nations and in time
 develop a more modern political system. The more
 meaningful questions, in our view, are not so much
 whether, but in what form and when.
 Alternative Paths
 China could develop into a highly centralized and
 orthodox bureaucratic state along the lines of the
 Soviet Union. Any Chinese leadership fears the conse-
 quences of weakened central authority. Deng himself

 has warned that without proper party leadership
 China could "retrogress into division and confusion
 and be unable to accomplish modernization." Espe-
 cially after Deng goes, the inherent authoritarian
 instincts in both Chinese and Communist societies
 could push Chinese political life into a more orthodox,
 centrally controlled, and disciplined direction.
 China could also become a more pluralistic, although
 still highly controlled, society combining Marxist,
 Chinese, and even some Western traditions. The
 underlying spur will continue to be a desire to make
 headway against bureaucracy, redtape, cadre and
 official malfeasance, leftism, and economic inefficien-
 cy. Reformist leaders clustered about Hu Yaobang
 and Zhao Ziyang believe that further experimentation
 with political and economic reform is essential to
 achieve a more efficient, dynamic "socialist" society.
 A third possibility, and in our view the most likely, is
 a muddled outcome in which authoritarian politics
 coexist uneasily with more liberal, decentralized eco-
 nomic policies. China has a great ability to muddle
 through, and we believe the reformers can continue in
 this vein for a long time. Efforts to extend reform,
 particularly political reform, beyond present levels
 will be difficult for many of the same reasons that
 have slowed their development over the past three
 years. Chinese society remains too divided as well as
 fearful of change becoming uncontrolled, we believe,
 to allow much further liberalization.
 A darker course is possible, especially if Deng were to
 die soon. A Hu-Zhao leadership could turn out to be
 too weak to control the political pressures and ideolog-
 ical passions revealed in the spiritual pollution cam-
 paign. A conservative military-civilian coalition might
 take over, establish a repressive regime, and lead a
 backlash against many of the reforms promoted by
 Deng
 An important key to the future will be the balance
 between innovators and reformers and more conserva-
 tive elements in China's leadership. We regard the
 recent campaign against "spiritual pollution"-a slo-
 gan denoting Western cultural influence-as the lat-
 est example of a conservative initiative exploiting the
 fear of foreign influence that has long retarded Chi-
 na's modernization. Although Deng Xiaoping has
 taken an active part in this campaign, we view his
 participation as a tactical move perhaps to preempt
 his critics. Hu Yaobang appeared to be a target of the
 conservatives early in the campaign, but met the
 challenge successfully and played a key role in curtail-   25X1
 ing the campaign after only two months. That was
 time enough, however, for relations between reform-
 ers and conservatives to worsen considerably.
 Another major factor determining China's future will
 be the time remaining in which Deng can play an     25X1
 active role. If he has several more years of effective
 leadership, his reformist successors--General Secre-
 tary Hu Yaobang and Premier Zhao Ziyang-will
 have gained valuable time to build their own team and
 keep up the momentum of reform.
 After Deng goes, we think that Hu and Zhao will be
 politically weaker than at present and confronted by
 growing conservative pressures. A crucial question
 will be whether Hu Yaobang, reportedly regarded as
 too "liberal" by some party elders and military lead-
 ers, will be able to hold together the coalition forged
 by Deng. We think that in any event China's political
 life will probably move in a more centrally controlled,
 disciplined direction in the immediate post-Deng
 period.
 Addressing the 12th Party Congress in September
 1982, Deng showed a new awareness of the long time
 it takes for successful political reform in China. It
 will now take at least until the end of this century,
 Deng admitted, to achieve his ambitious reform goals.
 We agree with Deng. Even under the best of circum-
 stances, the task of modernizing China's political
 system will be slow, protracted, arduous, and
 uncertain.
