 WASHINGTON,  April  18--
 The    Central          Intelligence
 Agency set up a secret base
 in the Colorado Rockies to train
 Tibetan guerrillas in mountain
 warfare in the late nineteen-
 fiftlcs, when there was an up-
 rising against Chinese rule in
 Tibet, a new hook discloses.
 In the book, "The Politics of
 Lying," David Wise, the author,
 said  that  the  agency  began
 training Tibetan  refugees re-
 cruited in India in 1958 in a
 deserted World War 11 Army
 base near Leadville, Colo. The
 operation continued   into the
 early months of the Kennedy
 Administration, he said.

 For ReleasliVl9SiL01 : CIA-RDP91-00901R00
 Earlier in the year the Shah of Iran was "standing up"
 to  the bag o1 companies and lnakinil lhaldlilles. With  ;1
 population of 30 million, Iran produces some 4.5 million
 barrels a day, amounting to yearly revenues of about
 $4 billion. 'hhe coils ort iii ill which is extracting the oil
 includes Shell; Texaco; Mobil; the new little brother,
 Exxon; 13ritieli  Petroleum;  Cie.  Fransaise de:; Petroics;
 some U.S. independents, etc. Their contract for the con-
 cession expired in 1979, but it contained an option for
 renewal for another fifteen years, which would have ex-
 tended it to 1994. The Shah decided not to honor the
 renewal clause. He announced that he was not satisfied
 with the present level of production--Ile wanted it
 doubled, no less. This would entail a capital investment
 on the part of the companies of at least y2 billion,
 hardly a safe venture under present conditions, with per-
 haps worse to come. The Shah was threatening complete
 nationalization by 1979, with the companies in the con-
 sortium relegated to the position of customers for the oil
 output, in what looks like a sellers' market.
 Here, to a superficial view, was another case of the
 puppet threatening the puppeteer. The CIA had put the
 Shah in power. V/hen Mohammed i',?fossade h opposed
 him in the early 1950s, the Shah fled the country, and
 c.- found it safe to return only when Allen Dulles deposed
 Mossadec,ll with the'aid of $19 million distributed in the
 right pl, ces. '[hough that was long ago, on closer inspec-
 tion things are not so different now. The CIA, to be
 sure, can no longer engage in the rough stuff which vas
 the rule in the fifties, and to that extent the puppet is no
 longer that much of a puppet, but deals can stall be made
 when the right people are on hand to make theta.
 Like Richard I-:elms, for instance. Until recently he
 was ]lead of the CIA; then it was announced by the
 White House that lie would become ambassador to Iran.

 It will doo nothing for the Iranian ? people,  v.Thom
 Shah will continue to rule ? as a feudal lief. The treat
 majority of Iranians are desperately poor. and some of
 tlicm, university students in particular, arc in a rebellious
 mood. When they are caught by the Shah's police they
 tare jailed, tortured and put to death, dep: r.din on the
 enormity of the offense.. I-lowever, dissidents abroad are-
 a lon:z-terns threat. In February' a Republic of Iran was
 proclaimed in VVlisliington by a Committee; for Free Iran,
 whose demands include freedom of the press, freedom of
 assembly, freedom of speech, the end of the polio. state,
 and an end of the monarchy.
 It is hardly likely that the Shah needs several billion
 dollars worth of arms to cope with his internal enemies,
 and the government in exile is not a formidable threat
 at present. But it asks awkward questions in its news-
 paper, Iran Free Press: "Why must a country like Iran,
 with a majority of its citizens impoverished and facing
 no real military threat from the outside, spend billions
 on armaments?" The paper charges that any country with
 an investment in Iran can bleed the Iranian. people and
 deprive them of the necessities of life. Moreover, the arras
 --fighter bombers, patrol planes, helicopters, etc.-can
 be used to establish the Shah as the master of the I'crsiart
 Gulf, from which the British withdrew in 1971. With
 the arms supplied by the United States (some also by the
 British) the Shah can dominate the other oil-rich countries
 in the-area, and the United States is apparently satisfied
 to see him establish himself in that role.
 The Iranian students in the United States have no love
 for their ruler, and it is possible that they will try to give
 him a lively reception on his forthcoming visit to the
 United States. What with the U.S. Army, Navy, Air
 Force and the ;'.tarines; the CIA, the FBI, the Washington
 police, et al., the Shah has little to worry about. Law
 and order will be maintained, we may be sure of'-that.
 But in the long run, the outlook for the type of `;over'.-'
 went the Shah represents-and the United States sup-

 Startling Chwge Leveled at `S cret Tewn
 By 11SENNO DUERKSEN
 I   Press-Scimitar Surf Writer
 Most Americans would re-
 coil with horror at the idea
 of.a military junta aiming
 cannon at the White House
 and taking over the U.S.
 government, South America
 style, but if we may believe
 a retired Air Force colonel
 named L. Fletcher Prouty, it
 h a s already happened in
 Washington,  without  t h e
 guns.
 The disturbing and fright-
 ening factor is that Prouty
 has     the
 credentials,
 having
 served  for
 nine years
 as  contact
 tion rather than fact, but on
 page after page one is con-
 stantly reminded that this is
 real history the author is
 talking about.
 "The conflict in Vietnam
 stands as a costly and fright-
 ening example of how the
 U.S. military force can be
 drawn into an operation in
 pursuit of the unconvention-
 al para-military activities of
 theLIA," writes Prouty.
 Prouty zeroes in on the
 late Allen Dulles, director of
 CIA for eight years, as the
 man who did the most to
 change the CIA from its
 original and only legally as-
 signed task of coordinating
 intelligence into an agency
 up to its ears in creating
 tween t he   revolutions, changing gov-
 C e n t r a 1                       ernments and changing his-
 tory.
 Agency acd'    Prouty points to Dulles'
 -   --                   "Tl   C  ft of
 k
 well documented 400 pages
 to back up the sub-title of his
 new book, "The CIA and its
 evidence more than enough
 pressure from any one of
 several groups,  or  their
 more radical sub-groups, to }
 support the germ of the idea I
 that a sinister conspiracy
 ;pressures. For these groups
 perience and political power
 and that he had to be re-
 moved from office before
 winning the inevitable man-
 date from the U.S. public
 which was certain to be his
 in 1964,"
 Prouty states that it was
 Allen Dulles who had a large
 hand in the writing of the
 Warren Report.
 Then, writes Prouty, "The
 Secret  Team  machine,
 always at its most active
 and insidious best in adver-
 sity, surged forward in the
 post-Kennedy  void,  T h e
 record shows that Johnson
 (President Johnson) almost
 never said no."
 Prouty states that the CIA
 and the ST played a decisive
 role in historic events in Jor-
 dan, Guatamala, the Philip-
 pines, Indonesia and the Do-.
 minican Republic, as well as
 its well-known roles in the
 I3ay of Pins fiasco and, final-
 1v, Vietnam.
 Some of these operations,
 when uncovered by the coun-
 tries involved, re!:ulted in
 the U.S. government being
 forced to pay blackmail to
 the tune of millions, often in
 military equipment, all with-
 out the U.S. public being in-
 formed.
 Keeping the U.S. public in
 the dark about the-2 opera-
 tions, under the r ui~' of "se-
 curity," was all re:.lly a big
 joke, says Prouty, because

 many stories taken from
 "Top Secret" files w h e n
 such leaking served his pur-

 Prouty points o u t that
 when the CIA was first form-
 ed, under a law signed by
 the  late  President  Harry
 Truman, it was given by law
 only one task, the coordina-
 tion of intelligence, and was
 never even authorized to col-
 lect intelligence.
 He then quotes Truman as
 saying, a few days after the
 assassination of President
 Kennedy, in 1963, "For some
 time I have been disturbed
 by the way the CIA has been
 diverted from its original
 assignment. It has become
 an operational and at times
 a policy-making arm of the
 Government. I never had
 any thought when I set up
 the CIA that it be injected
 into peace-time cloak-and-
 dagger operations."
 The former president then
 added that the CIA had be-
 come" a symbol of sinister
 and mysterious intrigue."
 "Who  knows  what
 thoughts passed through his
 (Truman's) m i n d during
 those thirty days from Nov.
 22,  to Dec.  22,  in 1963,
 thoughts that led him to write
 those powerful and intense
 words?" asks Prouty.

 programs of the agency.
 The critics.of President Nixon
 who comp'niu    is univcbo-
 ping at social service programs
 to bring government spending .
 back  within  budget  bounds
 should look at what is happening
 to the Central Intelligence Agen-
 cy.
 This is somewhat difficult to
 do in light of the secrecy sur-
 ? rounding  the  CIA.  What  is
 known, however, is that CIA
 budgets have increased over the
 ,years to about $4.5 billion. Much
 of this is attributable to the
 sophisticated  spy  equipment
 now being used to ferret out
 .what is going on in other coun-
 tries. The satellites which can
 detect movements at missile
 sites do not cone cheap.
 Even so, the CIA has been
 singled out by President Nixon
 as an agency which will receive
 the same budget knife treat-
 ment which is being given to
 Health, Education and Welfare

 case of the CIA, the knife-

 mizes this.
 What seems certain, with the
 reduction of over 1,000 employes
 since Schlesinger's arrival, is
 that President Nixon is looking

 COLONEL FLETCHER PROUTY INTERVIEWED
 Prouty spent a lot of his military career-as what is called the
 focal point officer between the Department of Defense and the
 Central Intelli.gonce Agency.   He's written a book which is highl
 critical of what he calls The Secret. Team, which by the way is
 the title of the book.   Since tie e are frequent references in
 the book to information in the Pentagon Papers, CBS News corres-.
 pondent Fred Graham, who's been covering the Daniel Ellsherg
 trial, has joined me for the interview.
 JOHN HAIZT:   Before he retired, Air Force Col. Fletcher,
 Col. Prouty,  I'd like to ask you first, what is the
 secret  team?
 COL. FLETCHER PROUTY:.. You know, there are quite a few
 people who write about the CIA, and Mr. Dulles has written about.
 CIA;   Lyman Kirkpatrick has written about CIA.   The secret team really is the CIA and other parts of the :government.   The secret
 team includes, for instance, the participation of the Defense
 Department, of the White House, offices such as today we have
 under Dr.    Kissinger.   I think it's important to point out that
 in the operational aspects of CIA work, the participation of a
 major part of the government, not just CIA is an important
 consideration.
 HART:   Well,   the  secret team's part in such things as
 the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diehm, that sort of thing, the  ITT-
 CIA involvement-                  alleged involvement--in the election in Chile
 are pretty well docunmented.   Can you tell us anything about what
 you think may be going on right now?
 PIZOUTY: You    mean  current  Operations?
 IIART:  That's right, yes.
 PROUTY:   Actually, mos. of the things that. I knew in
 current  operations    ended  with my  ret:i r  :1cnt.  about  ten  yeaars  ago
