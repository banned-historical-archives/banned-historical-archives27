 FOREWORD
 This report is designed to describe conditions of unemployment in
 Communist China and to evaluate the official program for meeting these
 problems.  The contradictory nature of the evidence on unemployment
 indicates that the Chinese Communists have neither defined the problem
 systematically nor collected any precise or reliable statistical data.
 Even though a statistical analysis of the problem is thereby precluded,
 this report attempts to select information on employment and industri-
 alization which, when brought together, points up serious economic
 problems that eventually will have to be met by the Chinese Communists.
 The effect of a rapid growth in population on the future manpower
 problems of Communist China has not been treated extensively in this
 report, because a subsequent report is planned on that subject.

 UNEMPLOYMENT IN COMMUNIST CHINA*
 0-57
 1,950-57
 Summary
 Unemployment in Communist China -- which is essentially under-
 utilization of labor -- has been a persistent problem for the
 Communists since 1950 and promises to remain so through the Second
 Five Year Plan (1958-62).  Because the total population of China is
 more than 600 million and is increasing at the net rate of about 15
 million a year, the need for new jobs is growing at a faster pace
 than the expanding supply of employment opportunities.  Yet the
 emphasis on modern industry in the first two Five Year Plans re-
 quires only small amounts of additional labor relative to the level
 of investment.  During the Second Five Year Plan the total labor
 force is expected to grow at least four times as fast as the planned
 expansion of wage workers.  Under present Chinese Communist policy,
 which discourages self-employment in urban areas, most of those
 entering the labor force will have to seek work in the rural areas,
 where the intensive application of labor cannot profitably be pushed
 much further.
 Rapid socialization-in the rural areas has apparently reduced em-
 ployment and output in subsidiary occupations, although recent policy
 statements indicate a desire to reverse this trend.  Up to the present,
 however, efforts by the Chinese Communists to relieve chronic under-
 employment in rural China have been only partially successful.  In-
 tensive-labor projects such as land reclamation, afforestation, and
 water conservancy have used large numbers of rural labor with small
 investment costs and are thus providing productive work for labor that
 might otherwise be idle.  Corvee and penal labor have been used for
 these tasks throughout China and, in the case of corvee labor, have
 made relatively efficient use of redundant labor at unusually low cost.
 Industrial expansion in Communist Chiria, unlike the experience of
 most other countries, has not required, although it has stimulated,
 the movement of surplus farm labor into the cities.  Even though
 stringent measures have been taken to prohibit this movement, enough
 peasants have evaded these controls to swell the urban population
 greatly and thereby complicate the unemployment problem in the cities.
 *  The estimates and conclusions contained in this report represent
 the best judgment of ORR as of 1 October 1957?

 Socialization of private businesses in the cities, along with
 restrictions on self-employment, resulted in employment cutbacks in
 commercial, handicraft, and service occupations.  These cutbacks,
 combined with the infiltration of destitute peasantry into the cities,
 created a greater supply of labor than could be used in the expanding
 urban centers of China.  The result has been continuous unemployment
 in urban areas since 1950.
 In modern industry, underemployment, rather than unemployment,
 has been the more serious problem.  In spite of the growth of new
 opportunities for employment in modern industry, there has been a
 persistent tendency to hire more workers than are. justified by the
 available production facilities.  Economic enterprises have con-
 sistently overestimated their need for labor, with the resultant over-
 hiring boosting costs and holding down increases in productivity
 throughout modern industry.  The government's response to these con-
 ditions has been a campaign of retrenchment aimed at reducing excessive
 labor in industry.  The degree of this overhiring is suggested by a
 directive of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in 1955 ordering all enter-
 prises under its control to cut back their personnel rolls by 15 to 20
 percent.  Any reductions achieved in 1955, however, were nullified by
 reneged hiring in 1956, when employment expanded abruptly under the
 stimulus of heavy investment in construction and industry.  With wage
 costs running higher in 1956 because of the newly instituted wage
 reforms, the government has again insisted on more rational employment
 practices and has demanded that total employment be cut back in 1957
 and that wages be held down or reduced wherever possible.
 By emphasizing modern, large-scale, capital-intensive plants,
 Chinese Communist industrial planners are using the bulk of their
 scarce capital in investments which make relatively little use of the
 enormous supply of manpower.  Furthermore, there is evidence that
 greater total output as well as higher employment could be obtained by
 the investment of the same amount of capital in small- and medium-size
 plants.  It is probable that recognition of these facts has prompted
 the recent endorsement of subsidiary occupations in the rural areas
 and of new investment in smaller industrial plants for the cities.
 If Chinese Communist policy, however, continues to give highest pri-
 ority to heavy industry, which is predominantly capital-intensive,
 and continues to penalize private employment and to neglect consumer
 goods industries, which are mainly labor-intensive, then it is doubt-
 ful that the Chinese Communists will solve the problem of unemployment.

 I.  Introduction.
 The term unemployment has assumed, in most Western societies, a
 relatively precise meaning which has little pertinence or applicability
 to the Chinese Communist labor force.  The absence of reliable manpower
 statistics in Communist China and the apparent lack of any consistent
 standard of determining employment status make it necessary to adapt
 certain technical terms to fit into the unique context of China's pop-
 ulation and manpower situation.
 Although it is possible to differentiate between voluntary and
 involuntary unemployment, only the latter has any great significance
 in China.  The voluntarily idle -- those who neither work nor seek
 work -- are generally ineligible because of age, child-rearing duties,
 or physical handicaps.  The idle rich, or those who choose not to
 work, are for all practical purposes nonexistent in China today.  In
 fact, those members of the wealthy class who remained in China after
 1949 have been in most cases prohibited from seeking work. i*  Un-
 employment will therefore be used in this report only in the sense of
 involuntary unemployment.  This, in turn, may logically be subdivided
 into several forms -- visible, seasonal, and disguised unemployment.
 A.  Visible Unemployment.
 The most obvious form of unemployment, and consequently the
 easiest to define, is the condition of complete joblessness for certain
 workers for specific time periods.  Although part of this condition may
 be temporary, or frictional, unemployment, most of it is of a more
 permanent nature, resulting from a faster rate of growth of population
 than of job opportunities.
 B.  Seasonal Unemployment.
 Agriculture suffers most from seasonal unemployment because
 planting and harvesting are so dependent on climatic conditions.  In
 the south of China, this situation has been relieved somewhat by
 double-cropping and interculture of plants, making it possible to
 space demands for heavy labor more evenly throughout the year.
 Handicraft and home industries have further served to fill the gaps
 in agricultural work.  Handicraft work may itself be seasonal, how-
 ever, depending as it so often does on locally grown raw material or
 on seasonal demand for products.

 C.  Disguised Unemployment.
 The disguised unemployed are those workers, usually in
 agriculture, handicraft, or service functions, who are so numerous
 in relation to the resources with which they work that, if some of
 them were withdrawn from work, the total output of their particular
 sector would not be diminished. J  Because these workers may be
 employed and working, at least part time, to call them disguised
 unemployed is somewhat misleading. Underemployment is perhaps a
 better term and will be used in this report as a synonym for dis-
 guised unemployment.*  Underemployment generally arises wherever the
 existing labor force has insufficient resources with which to work.
 In China, this condition is most apparent in agriculture, where the
 shortage of arable land relative to farming population has made it
 difficult either to utilize manpower fully or to raise productivity.
 In such a situation, productivity can usually be raised only by the
 application of technological improvements or additional investment.
 Further additions of labor would only lower productivity.  With a
 stable technology and low investment in agriculture, limits of labor
 intensification are reached in which the redundance of labor appears
 not as visible unemployment but as chronic underemployment.
 II.  Unemployment in the Agricultural Sector.
 A.  Surplus Labor in Agriculture.
 A high density of farming population, severely limited
 resources of arable land, and the seasonal nature of the work all
 contribute to unemployment in Chinese agriculture.  Because of the
 pressure of growing farm population on limited land resources, the
 techniques of production in China have evolved in the direction of
 more intensive application of labor.  Although these intensive tech-
 niques have made it possible for increasing numbers of farm workers
 to find work on the land, this spreading of work faces a point of
 declining returns in which further rises in labor supply will lower
 *-As the reference is to an excess of workers for a particular task
 or job, this condition might just as logically be termed overemployment.
 Underemployment, however, is the more familiar term and is most common
 in the literature on unemployment.  Hidden unemployment and partial
 unemployment are terms which also have been used to describe this
 same condition.

 productivity and per capita income with only partial compensation
 in increased production.  At this point, new capital investment,
 additional land, or new methods of cultivation are necessary if
 production is to increase enough to use the growing labor supply
 profitably.  Nevertheless, because farm labor is so abundant and
 therefore so cheap, it has generally been less costly to rely on
 human labor than to invest in animal labor and machinery.
 The timing of labor inputs tends to vary sharply through the
 year as a result of the cyclical nature of agricultural production.
 Periods of slackness in farm work alternate with periods of peak
 labor demand -- notably during harvesting and sowing -- when there
 are often temporary and local shortages of labor.  Yet even these
 temporary periods of relatively full employment have been marked
 by inefficient use of manpower resources.  J.L. Buck, in his rural
 surveys of 1929-33, 3  found that only 35 percent of his sample of
 able-bodied men (15 to 60 years of age) worked full time; the re-
 mainder worked either part time or not at all.  Idleness averaged
 1.7 months per able-bodied man per year. /  Most of this idle time
 was in the winter months and includes all those who could not find
 subsidiary work to tide them over the agricultural slack season.
 Underemployment, or the underutilization of labor, is only
 partly covered by the seasonal unemployment indicated above.  Al-
 though most qualified observers believe that chronic underemployment
 has persisted in rural China for generations, very little statistical
 evidence is available for documenting or quantifying this view.  There
 is, in fact, no simple technique for measuring the degree of surplus
 labor on the land.  Labor is considered here to be redundant or
 surplus to the degree that workers could be withdrawn without reducing
 the level of output.*  It is not known whether the Chinese Communists
 *  By using this general standard, estimates have been made for Eastern
 Europe which indicate that, in 1939, one-quarter to one-third of the
 farm population was surplus, varying from 33 percent for Yugoslavia and
 Bulgaria to about 25 percent for Poland and Greece, about 20 percent
 for Rumania, 15 percent for Hungary, and about 10 percent for Czecho-
 slovakia. J   In prewar Egypt, one observer stated that with better
 farm management "one might envisage with fair assurance the reduction
 of the agricultural population by at least 50 percent without reducing
 the total products from the land and without much more mechanization
 than at present." J

 would define surplus manpower in the same way.  They have used the
 term, however, in reporting on a survey in 1955 of farm cooperatives.
 According to this source,    surplus manpower totaled 26 percent of
 the labor force in selected cooperatives of Hopeh Province, 30 per-
 cent in cooperatives of Shansi Province, 17 percent in cooperatives
 of Kiangsu Province, and 35 percent in cooperatives of Szechwan
 Province.
 B.  Rural Labor Policies Under the Communists.
 Since the Communists assumed control in 1949, little infor-
 mation on rural underemployment has been released except in indirect
 references.  The agrarian policies of the Chinese Communists indicate,
 however, an awareness of the problem and an intention to obtain more
 efficient use of the enormous rural labor supply.  Given a situation
 in which the rural labor force contains a high proportion of redundant
 labor, several alternatives for ameliorative action are possible.
 The most obvious remedy for rural underemployment is the creation of
 new employment opportunities, preferably off the land and in manu-
 facturing industries, under conditions of rapid economic development.
 Assuming that this more or less ideal solution cannot be achieved
 rapidly enough, then the alternatives are to raise output and hence
 employment by heavier investment in agricultural production, more
 efficient organization of production activities, redistribution of
 labor from areas of dense concentrations to areas of virgin or re-
 claimed land, or, finally, by using the surplus labor to create
 capital improvements on the land at minimal investment cost.  The
 Chinese Communists are in fact applying all of these latter methods
 in varying degrees.  Investment in fertilization, better equipment,
 and better seeds, although of fundamental importance in raising
 agricultural productivity, will not be discussed in the following
 sections, because of the indirect relationship to labor and under-
 employment.
 1.  Collectivizing the Peasantry.
 Collectivization of the Chinese peasants has reordered the
 production relationships on the land and may result in a further in-
 tensification of labor inputs.  Regulations for higher state agricul-
 tural producer cooperatives, passed by the National Peoples Congress
 in June 1956, require a higher degree of specialization and a more
 elaborate division of labor than was previously the rule among farm
 laborers. ?   In addition, work quotas are combined with production

 goals in an effort to obtain the highest possible output from in-
 tensive-labor application.  Emulation drives are to be organized in
 the cooperatives to speed up work, presumably in much the same way
 that they have been used on factory production lines.  Workers are
 subject to labor disciplinary rules, infractions of which are pun-
 ishable by reduction in pay, fines, dismissal from one's position,
 and, finally, expulsion from the cooperative.  A more efficient
 organization of farm labor, probably even more than the speedup of
 work operations, should account for some increase in agricultural
 output, but, to the degree that greater efficiency is achieved in
 already highly intensive labor practices, it is logical to expect
 an increasing amount of labor to become available for other work.
 It is obvious, in fact, that the Chinese Communists do not expect
 more intensive use of farm labor to reduce materially the amount of
 surplus labor.  One of the best indications of this fact can be
 found in the stress now laid on projects which require large numbers
 of farm labor but which are not directly involved in crop production.
 2.  Mass-Labor Projects.
 The Chinese Communists plan to channel large numbers of
 the surplus rural population into construction projects which can
 use masses of unskilled labor without at the same time requiring
 large investments in capital equipment.  Surplus labor from the
 farms can be used to advantage on water-conservation projects, road
 building, land reclamation, afforestation, and similar tasks re-
 quiring relatively small capital inputs.  Far from being make-work,
 these tasks are in the long run essential to raising agricultural
 production and thus are significant contributions to the national
 output.  The cost for these projects is composed largely of expenses
 for labor, which in most cases are little more than subsistence for
 the workers.
 The scope of construction projects undertaken since 1950
 demonstrates clearly that the Communist officials experienced no
 difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of unskilled, surplus
 laborers for their needs.  In water conservancy, for instance, the
 1.7 billion cubic meters of earthwork completed in 1950-52 required
 the effort of 20 million workers. 9   There has been no indication
 that the government met any unusual problems in collecting the
 workers required for construction on this scale.  This is, in fact,
 not unusual considering the source of labor used on these projects.

 a.  Corvee Labor.
 Corvee labor refers to unpaid or partly paid labor
 exacted by public authorities.  This levy on labor is traditional
 to China and most of the Far East, where it has generally been
 accepted as simply another form of taxation.  This system was used
 most often in agricultural slack seasons for the construction, re-
 pair, or maintenance of public works such as roads, irrigation canals,
 and dikes.  The Communists have expanded this usage, lengthened the
 period of service, and made it impossible for the draftee to hire a
 substitute.  Having thus strengthened the system for their own uses,
 the authorities now have a highly effective means of utilizing the
 masses of seasonally unemployed and chronically underemployed.  Costs
 for corve'e labor have varied widely.  In some cases, workers have re-
 ceived no pay and have had to furnish their own food, / in other
 cases food was provided, and in some cases wages were paid. 11   The
 corvee system has worked well under the stress of natural calamities,
 notably during floods, when enormous supplies of labor were needed
 for strengthening the dikes and for other flood-control measures.
 Following the disastrous floods in 1954, for example, dike repairs
 alone required 5 million to 6 million workers over a 3-month period. 12/
 These workers were drawn from the flood-affected areas and were paid
 for work instead of relief, a common practice now for all disaster
 victims.
 b.  Forced Labor.
 Forced labor, or penal labor (which the Communists
 prefer to call labor reform), has been used in factory work, agri-
 cultural production, and construction work.  The diversity of uses
 for this type of labor is a function of its complete control by the
 authorities.  Forced labor has more mobility than corvee labor, which
 is almost always recruited in the local area of the project.  No
 evidence is available for cost comparisons of penal and corvee labor,
 although it seems likely that the cost of feeding, housing, and
 guarding the forced labor would result in a higher cost per person
 than would be the case with corvee labor, which presents no housing
 or security problem.
 The Communists announced in 1954 that more than 83
 percent of the prison population were engaged in production, 13  and
 subsequent indications are that the current participation rate is
 probably higher.  Lacking even the most rudimentary statistics on the

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 number of prisoners in China, estimates on the size of forced labor
 camps have varied widely.  The size of the penal labor force has been
 augmented by each major "campaign" in Communist China -- land reform,
 "three-anti" and "five-anti" campaigns, roundups of counter-revolution-
 aries -- all of which sent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
 political and class enemies into detention.  When, in addition, the
 common criminals and other "undesirables left over from the old society"
 are considered, it seems likely that the total number of convicts must
 run into the millions.   If they had not been placed under detention,
 most of these individuals would be unemployed today, because the Com-
 munist regime has consistently sought to eliminate its political enemies
 by wiping out their means of economic support, including the right to
 seek employment.
 3.   Subsidiary Occupations.
 Rural subsidiary occupations, mainly in handicraft and
 commerce, were almost completely neglected in the rapid socialization
 of agriculture, 14  with consequent declines in employment, production,
 and income.    This loss to the economy has not been balanced by the in-
 creased availability of labor for agricultural production.  In order
 to use this labor more profitably, the Chinese planners are now at-
 tempting to redress their neglect of the subsidiary occupations.  A
 recent directive on agricultural cooperatives, J for example, has
 ordered that subsidiary production be revived by organizing "side-line
 production teams" made up of former part-time handicraft workers.   If
 the agricultural cooperative "does not possess the requirements for
 engaging in such side-line production, it may let Lthe worker) run
 their own business at their own profit or loss."  6   By allowing
 greater freedom in part-time handicraft, commercial, and service occu-
 pations, a considerable gain in employment might be made in the rural
 areas.  At the same time, the income of the peasants could be supple-
 mented and larger amounts of consumer goods could be produced, which
 would contribute to relieving two important sources of rural discontent.
 III.  Unemployment in the Nonagricultural Sector.
 The First Five Year Plan (1953-57) of Communist China, unlike the
 industrialization efforts of most other countries, has not yet required
 a large-scale movement of surplus farm labor into the cities.  On the
 contrary, stringent measures have been taken to prohibit this movement,
 and in a number of cases, surplus labor has been moved out of industrial
 cities and returned to rural areas.   In spite of these controls, however,

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 urban population in China has grown rapidly since 1950.  Net growth of
 employment opportunities, on the other hand, has undergone a slower rate
 of growth, so that the urban supply of labor has probably exceeded the
 number of available jobs consistently since 1950.  The resulting degree
 of unemployment and underemployment has never been subjected to careful
 measurement.  Communist admissions of unemployment, ranging between 2
 million and 3 million people, are believed to be underestimates of the
 actual situation.  If these estimates are actually based on unemployment
 registration data, as sometimes alleged, the incomplete nature of the
 registration statistics* would account for the apparent underestimate.
 In general, however, published statements on unemployment and surplus
 labor are marked by the absence of any attempt at quantification.  It is
 possible, nevertheless, to make rough assumptions of the degree of un-
 employment by reference to changes in urban population.  As the Chinese
 have acknowledged jobs to be the fundamental determinant of the popula-
 tion capacity of cities, / their attempt to control the size of urban
 centers has been one of the most pertinent indicators of employment oppor-
 tunities in those areas.
 A.  Growth of Urban Population, 1950-57-
 According to Mao Tse-tung, "if China is to build huge people's
 industries and many large, modern cities, she must go through a long
 process of converting rural population into urban population." 19/
 This seeming truism, supported by evidence from almost every in-
 dustrialized society, may have to be amended for China, because no
 precedent exists for a nation attempting rapid industrialization
 with comparable demographic problems.  Certainly the process of urban-
 ization in China will be affected not only by future industrial develop-
 ment but also by the demographic base upon which these changes must occur.
 The rural-urban distribution of China's population in 1953 --
 announced as 13.3 percent urban and 86.7 percent rural -- suggests the
 rural, agrarian nature of the society.   In the highly industrialized
 us, 61. percent of the population were classified as urban in 1950. 20
 In terms of absolute numbers, however, this difference is less extreme;
 the US classified 96.5 million people as urban in 1950, and China --
 undoubtedly using a less inclusive definition -- listed 77.3 million
 as urban in 1953.  By 1956, Communist China was estimating the urban
 *  Not only were part of the unemployed forbidden to register, 17  but
 many of those eligible to register failed to do so because of the
 explicit compulsion to take whatever work might be offered.

 population as 90 million people, 21  17 million less than the US urban
 population for the same year and 3 million more than the Soviet urban
 population, also for 1956. 22   The skills, education, and productivity
 of the above urban populations remain, of course, the most significant
 economic factors, but the comparison in terms of quantitative size is
 relevant to availability of labor supply and suggests important differ-
 ences between recruitment of industrial workers in the US and the USSR
 on the one hand and in China on the other.
 Official Chinese Communist announcements have indicated a
 growth in urban population of the following order:  1950, 58 million
 people; 1953, 77 million people; and 1956, 90 million people.  The
 claimed increase of 33 percent from 1950 to 1953 is believed to be
 overstated because of the inaccuracy of precensus estimates, almost
 all of which were too low.  Also the expansion of urban boundaries has
 added large numbers previously defined as rural inhabitants.   The in-
 crease from 1953 to 1956,? approximately 17 percent, is considered
 more reliable, although it too contains rural inhabitants reclassified
 by the enlargement of urban boundaries.  The official estimate of urban
 population growth over the First Five Year Plan is apparently 33 per-
 cent, 23  which would represent an average annual gain of 5 million
 people, resulting in an urban population for mid-1957 of about 95
 million people.
 1.  Migration to the Cities.
 Before the Communist takeover, migration of peasants into
 the cities traditionally reached its annual peak during spring, when
 winter food stocks ran low, and was generally followed by a sub-
 stantial backflow as soon as conditions in the rural areas returned to
 normal.  After 1950 the increment remaining in the cities became larger,
 presumably because of the preferential treatment accorded urban workers
 by the government.  By 1953, extensive propaganda was ordered to inform
 the peasants that "industrial construction is only in the beginning
 stages in the cities and does not require additional workers." 24+
 In addition, directives were issued forbidding the unauthorized movement
 of peasants into urban areas. 25   These controls were subsequently
 supplemented by "spring famine relief work" for the express purpose of
 supplying peasants in food-short areas with sufficient supplies "so
 that they will not run away from their homes to escape famine." 26
 In spite of these increasingly efficient techniques of
 control, it is estimated that 10 million to 12 million peasants moved

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 to cities between 1953 and 1957, which, together with the estimated
 6 million people added by natural increase, combined to swell the
 urban population of China to between 95 million and 100 million.
 That urban population could grow so rapidly by migration -- in spite
 of the laws against peasant movement -- is a reflection not so much
 of weakness in control as of the volume of surplus labor on the land
 and the pervasive pressure which this exerts against the cities.
 2.  Evacuation of Surplus Urban Population.
 The steady infiltration of peasant migrants into the cities
 led the Communist government in 1955 to attempt an evacuation of that
 portion of the urban population considered to be surplus.  Although the
 authorities had been moving relatively large numbers of skilled workers
 and technicians out of coastal cities to the Northeast and Northwest,
 they had attempted no large-scale displacement of urban population
 before 1955?
 Shanghai is perhaps the best example of this attempt at
 resettlement.  As one of the most overpopulated cities in China, it
 has thus far received the most attention from the Communists.  With a
 population of 5 million people in 1950, Shanghai grew to 6.2 million
 in 1953 and 7 million in 1955. P11   The excess of births over deaths
 between 1950 and 1955 would account for an estimated addition of
 600,000 to the population, but the remainder of the increase -- 1.4
 million people -- represents the flow of migrants into Shanghai,
 mainly from rural areas. 28    According to a Communist newspaper,
 in 1955 only 2,570,000 people were actually "participating in production"
 in Shanghai, leaving the remaining 4,430,000 "jobless."  If the esti-
 mated number of dependents and others not seeking employment are sub-
 tracted from this figure, approximately 1.4 million people in Shanghai
 appear to have been unemployed in 1955, exactly matching the 1950-55
 increase of the population attributable to in-migration. '
 The official plan was to evacuate 1 million of these
 unemployed migrants during 1955, but because of the resistance of the
 evacuees and the adverse reaction of the local peasantry, who had to
 share their limited supplies of food and land, 30  the program was
 abandoned when less than 600,000 persons had been sent back to the
 rural areas. 31
 In a recent policy statement the Shanghai Municipal Peoples
 Council formulated the following measures for eliminating the continuing
 "state of overpopulation in the city" 32/:
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 a.  The unemployed must be "mobilized" for return to the
 countryside for agricultural production.
 b.  "No added workers will be enlisted for the city as a
 whole (in 1957), and where some factories and enterprises must have
 more workers, adjustment should be made by drawing from workers al-
 ready employed in the city."
 c.  "Families of workers now living in the rural areas or
 other cities must be encouraged to remain where they are."
 d.  Census regulations must be firmly enforced in order
 to keep the records accurate and up-to-date.
 Although it received the greatest amount of publicity,
 Shanghai was by no means the only city attempting to reduce its
 surplus population by forced return to rural areas.  Canton, Tientsin,
 Amoy, Tsingtao, Fu-chou, Wu-chou, Harbin, Mukden, An-shan, and Lu-ta
 have all been cited 33-1 as cities from which rural migrants were
 removed.  It is noteworthy that several of the heavy industry cities
 of the Northeast are included in this list, indicating that problems
 of labor oversupply are not limited to the predominantly commercial or
 light industry cities.
 Official explanations of this population dispersal have
 tended to stress that the peasant influx not only has compounded the
 difficulties of food supply and employment in the cities but also
 has adversely affected agricultural production through loss of labor
 power on the land.   It is doubtful, however, that loss of unskilled
 labor power would be a serious problem for agricultural production.
 Probably the only serious drain on rural manpower has been the re-
 ported loss of members of the managerial and administrative class --
 directors of agricultural cooperatives, administrative cadres, school
 teachers, militia chiefs, and timekeepers 34  -- most of whom are
 difficult to replace.
 B.  Employment in Commercial, Handicraft, and Service Occupations.
 The expansion and contraction of employment in commercial,
 handicraft, and service occupations have been a function of the rural-
 urban migration pattern and the government's policy toward the non-
 socialized sector of the economy.  Both these factors have contributed,
 at least since 1950, to creating difficult employment problems for the
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 tertiary occupations.  The influx of rural migrants into these oc-
 cupations after 1950 added to the pre-existing condition of under-
 employment.  These problems subsequently became worse when the
 government's campaign against private business caused a sharp re-
 duction in job opportunities in the commercial and service fields.
 The proportion of urban manpower in commercial, handi-
 craft, and service occupations has been high in China because rural
 migrants, having limited skills and resources, crowded into these
 expansible and undemanding jobs.  These occupations, characterized
 by low earnings, low productivity, and intense competition, suffer
 further from a surplus of labor. 3.1/   In this case the size of the
 labor force in tertiary occupations is an indication of lack of
 alternative employment rather than a sign of economic progress, as
 is generally conceded to be the case in more advanced economies.
 The increased volume of rural migration to cities, which
 occurred after 1950, resulted in rapid expansion of tertiary oc-
 cupations.  Commercial occupations, the only category for which there
 are reasonable figures, grew from 7 million jobs in 1950 to 8 .million
 in 1952 (see Table 1*). 36   This growth was presumably caused by a
 shift of peasants from agricultural work into small-scale commercial
 activities, mostly as self-employed peddlers or hawkers.  Although
 socialization in commerce had covered 1.2 million workers by 1952,
 the private sector was at a higher employment level than in 1950.
 With a step-up in the rate of socialization and the government's 1952
 campaign against private business, employment in private commerce fell
 off from 6.8 million workers in 1952 to 3.6 million in 1955.  At the
 same time, employment in socialized commercial organizations doubled.
 The net effect, however, was a decline of 24 percent in the total
 commercial employment between 1952 and 1955, forcing approximately
 2 million workers to seek new work.  This decline was common to both
 rural and urban areas.  In Honan Province, for instance, the number of
 persons in commerce represented 1.19 percent of the total population
 of that province in 1952 and 0.97 percent in 1954, but only 0.73 per-
 cent by February 1956. 37   In spite of such drastic reductions in the
 number of personnel engaged in commerce, the Communists have claimed
 that the rise in labor efficiency has been so great that the net volume
 of retail sales by all commercial organizations in 1955 increased 170
 percent above that in 1950. 38

 Although efficiency has probably increased, the sharp decline
 in commercial jobs has harmed retail services.  By 1956, in fact, the
 government was seeking to stop the steady shift of commercial workers
 out of retailing into agricultural work, as shown in the following
 quotation:
 The current trend of business personnel changes
 from business occupations to agricultural occupations
 should be discouraged.  The number of business personnel
 is not too large in the nation.  In fact, there is a
 shortage of business personnel in some localities.  It
 has been discovered that some 40 percent of the private
 business personnel and peddlers have entered agricultural
 occupations in certain localities.  This trend not only
 inconveniences the consumers but impedes the flow of
 commodities.  To correct this situation, propaganda ed-
 ucation should be strengthened so that business per-
 sonnel will not blindly plunge into agricultural oc-
 cupations. 40
 C.  Surplus Labor in Modern Industry.
 Underemployment of labor, rather than unemployment, has been
 the more serious problem in modern industry.  Having grown from about
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/16 :
 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 3 million workers in 1950 to an estimated 7.5 million in 1957, the
 labor force of modern industry has apparently overexpanded, with the
 result that large numbers of workers are surplus while at the same
 time receiving relatively high wages.  Even in heavy industry, which
 has been consistently favored by investment funds, the expansion of
 production facilities has failed to utilize fully the employed labor
 force.
 Between 1950 and 1954, labor productivity increased at a slower
 rate than employment in enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry.
 This lag in productivity was attributed to "labor waste" which followed
 overexpansion in employment.       This growth in employment has been more
 pronounced among administrative and service personnel -- called "nonindus-
 trial" or "nonproduction" workers by the Chinese -- than among production
 workers. The latter grew by 96 percent between 1950 and 1954, whereas the
 administrative and service workers increased by 173 percent. 42   This dis-
 proportionate rate of growth has been cited as the prime cause for the
 poor showing in productivity, as evidenced in the following quotations 43 :
 In the last several years, the excessive number
 of employees in enterprises has had a bad effect on
 the increase of labor productivity in these enter-
 prises.  In particular, the overemployment of per-
 sonnel in administrative departments and of nonin-
 dustrial personnel has caused the labor productivity
 of the whole personnel force to lag far behind the
 labor productivity of production workers.  For example,
 in 1954, labor productivity for the total personnel
 force in building construction and installation enter-
 prises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry was only
 56.5 percent of the productivity of production workers
 in these enterprises.  In the first quarter of this
 year L1:_1L95 7, the number of workers in half of the pro-
 ductive plants and mines under the Ministry of Heavy
 Industry exceeded the plan figure.  If these plants
 and mines had been able to restrict their personnel
 to the plan number, then they could have raised the
 labor productivity of workers for the first quarter
 of this year 3.2 percent above that of the same
 period of last year. 44
 Personnel waste is also widespread and serious.
 Confused administrative structures and excesses of
 personnel in supporting departments occur in all
 - 16 -

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 enterprises.  The number of employees in an enter-
 prise just beginning operations invariably exceeds
 the norm prescribed in Soviet Union designs.  For
 example, employment at Plant 301 was more than 100
 percent above norm, while it was 60 or 70 percent
 above norm at the An-shan Iron and Steel Company's
 large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube
 plant.  In many enterprises, labor productivity
 has been extraordinarily low, and the loss of work-
 days has been very high.  In the case of miners in
 the mines, the actual working time consumed less
 than one-third of the shift each day.   In compar-
 ison with the labor productivity in factories and
 mines of similar nature in the Soviet Union and in
 the new democracies, productivity in many of China's
 enterprises is from 50 to 100 or 200 percent lower.
 This clearly shows the personnel waste and low labor
 productivity in China. J
 The government's response to these conditions has been an
 official' campaign of retrenchment.  Beginning in 1955 and again in
 1957, official policy has endorsed reductions in force for those de-
 partments with surplus manpower.  Although the retrenchment campaign
 has hit hardest at the governmental bureaucracy, it has also singled
 out many industrial plants for criticism.  The Ministry of Heavy In-
 dustry, for instance, issued a directive in 1955 that all enterprises
 under its control should cut back their personnel rolls selectively
 15 to 20 percent.        In addition, all enterprises were to dispose of
 their surplus personnel as expeditiously as possible rather than re-
 taining them in pools for possible future use.  As a result of these
 orders, the Ministry of Heavy Industry reported that 7 large plants --
 the Shih-ching-shan Iron and Steel Plant, the An-shan Iron and Steel
 Company, the T'ung-kuan-shan Bureau of Mining Affairs, the Liu-li Ho
 Cement Plant, Cement Plant No. 7, the Tang-ku Plant of the Yung-li
 Chemical Company, and the Main Nan-fen Plant in Pen-ch'i -- succeeded
 in reducing their personnel rosters by an average of 19.4 percent. 47
 Any reductions in force achieved in 1955 were probably nullified
 in 1956, when 2.8 million new wage earners were added to the national
 economy. /  This has resulted in charges that the labor plan in 1956
 was too loose and that the number of personnel was "overly increased." X71
 Chinese authorities have ordered that in 1957 industrial enterprises are

 to work out their labor plans so that no new workers are hired and the
 number of administrative personnel and temporary workers is reduced --
 all this "in order to achieve the targets of increasing production,
 reducing costs, and raising labor productivity." 50
 The overhired condition of the industrial labor force is re-
 flected also in the decision to withhold trained apprentices from
 employment.  At the end of 1956, there were 370,000 apprentices in
 training, most of whom were scheduled to become journeymen and enter
 production in 1957. 51   Instead of entering the labor force, these
 apprentices are to be kept in training until a demand for their service
 develops.  The following official explanation of this situation is be-
 lieved to be accurate and realistic:
 The need for new workers actually required this
 year L1957T has been considerably reduced.  Some
 departments even have a surplus from their original
 working force and do not need additional personnel.
 Under such circumstances, if the 370,000 apprentices
 were promoted to journeymen according to the original
 plan this year, the state would have to pay many un-
 necessary wages.  Increased expenditures would un-
 favorably affect construction contracts, the balance
 in financial income, and the stabilization of commod-
 ity prices, and would be detrimental to the long-term
 interests of the state and the people. 52
 The relationships between wages and unemployment have not been
 explored by economic planners in China, presumably because of the re-
 luctance to acknowledge the existence of unemployment.  According to
 the Chinese Communists, wages are to be raised only as productivity is
 increased, and, as a general rule, wages should increase at only half
 the rate of productivity. 53   The possibility of wages responding to
 the supply and demand for labor has apparently received no comment in
 Chinese journals.  Under the conditions of underutilization of labor
 which were described previously for modern industry, it would be logical
 in a relatively free economy to expect some decline in average wages
 when the labor supply exceeds the demand.  In the controlled economy of
 the Chinese Communists, on the other hand, wages should be mechanically
 adjusted to changes in labor productivity.  For the years 1953, 1954,
 and 1955, however, it appears that wages, rather than being controlled
 by administrative fiat, actually followed fluctuations in the supply
 and demand for labor.  As shown in the following tabulation, 54  the

 trend of wages among workers and employees was certainly not attuned
 to changes in labor productivity:

 The slump in wage increases for these years, culminating in
 actual wage decreases in 1955, apparently resulted from economiz-
 ing moves which concentrated heavily on labor, the only productive
 factor that China has in surplus quantities.  The primary aim was
 to cut wage costs by eliminating redundant labor and by trimming
 wages.   Reducing surplus labor was strongly advocated but rarely
 implemented.  Average wages, however, were held back by eliminating
 year-end and incentive bonuses, reducing piecework, and delaying
 promotions. 511  As a result of these actions, average wages in
 heavy industry, to cite one example, declined 1.75 percent between
 1954 and 1955. 56    In addition to this fall in average wages, the
 total amount of wages paid failed to fulfill the plan figure for
 1955 in spite of a rise of 14.2 percent in labor productivity over
 the same period.   Similarly, the Iron and Steel Industry Control
 Bureau, although achieving its goals for production and produc-
 tivity, had to admit that 84 percent of the enterprises under
 its, control failed to utilize fully their wage funds according to
 plan in 1955. 57   The average wage per employee was only 95.24
 percent of the plan figure, a drop of 0.6 percent from the same
 period in 1954.
 Thus far the Chinese Communists have chosen to ignore the
 relationship between wages and labor supply discussed above.  This
 choice cost them heavily in the wage reform of 1956, when, apparently
 endeavoring to bolster incentives, the authorities raised wages an
 average of 14 percent for all government enterprises. 58   The net
 result, given existing unemployment and redundant labor, has been an
 increase in costs, which in turn is reducing profits 5.2/ with no
 compensating rise in productivity.  With the increases in wage funds
 encouraging job seekers and contributing to further expansion of
 employment, the number of workers added in 1956 has been called "ex-
 cessive," and, as a result, prodictivity is expected to be adversely

 affected throughout 1957. 60   Consequently, orders have been given
 that wages are not be raised in 1957, that no promotions are to be
 given, and that no personnel are to be added except under strict
 control. 61/
 IV.  Official Policy Toward Unemployment.
 Official Chinese Communist statements on unemployment have been
 marked by vacillation and equivocation.  Spokesmen for the government
 have successively ignored, minimized, and given great significance to
 the problem of unemployment, with perhaps the dominant attitude being
 one of patient faith in the promised efficacy of socialist solutions.
 These fluctuations in official attitudes have been reflected in policy
 changes which also show a considerable variation in range and objective.
 Recent developments, however, have shown more flexibility in action,
 indicating that the Chinese Communists, instead of accepting the doc-
 trinaire position that unemployment cannot exist in a socialist state,
 are realistically accepting unemployment as one of the "contradictions"
 which will require much time and effort to solve.
 By 1952, after only 3 years of control in China, the Communists
 claimed considerable success in reducing the unemployment "left over
 by the old society."  By retaining most of the governmental and
 educational personnel who had worked under the Nationalists and rein-
 stating factory and mine workers wherever possible, the Communists
 claimed to have greatly alleviated problems of unemployment in China. 62/
 According to the Communists, employment was high in 1952, and those
 unable to obtain jobs were largely ex-Kuomintang officials and army
 officers, landlords, and unreconstructed intellectuals.  These groups
 would be integrated into the labor force as soon as their thoughts were
 reoriented.  Underemployment was recognized as a problem in 1952, but
 only a temporary one.  Surplus workers were to be retained by all public
 and private enterprises and were to undergo training until needed.  The
 rural surplus labor, according to these same theorists, should be moved
 to the northeast, northwest, and southwest in order to open up barren
 land for agricultural production. 2X /
 The simplicity of these plans of 1952 reflects the optimism charac-
 teristic of labor policy in the first 3 or 4 years of the Chinese Com-
 munist government.  Even though the Communists acknowledged that the
 economic and social reform of business, as well as ;and reform, would
 create additional unemployment in the cities, the authorities assumed
 that "large-scale national construction" would insure full utilization

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 of surplus labor in both the urban and the rural areas within a
 relatively short time. L4J  This condition had not been achieved by
 1956, however, and official policy consequently began to shift on a
 number of points.
 Article 39 of the Draft 12-Year National Program for Agriculture
 states that unemployment in the cities will be settled in 5 or 7
 years from the beginning of 1956. 65/  Not only does this statement
 acknowledge that unemployment is a long-term, continuing problem, but
 also it indicates that agriculture is expected to absorb much of the
 surplus labor of China.  Evidence of this expectation is found in the
 evacuation programs which attempted to return surplus urban population
 to rural areas.   In this respect, there has been a persistent belief
 that agriculture, primarily through reclamation and exploitation of
 marginal land, could maintain even greater densities of population on
 the land than is presently the case.  Socialization of agriculture is
 also expected to facilitate the expansion of the rural labor force.
 The following statement, from an official Chinese news service, is a
 typical example of this somewhat naive faith in reclamation:
 The work of reclaiming wasteland is an easy way
 to increase agricultural production.  There is much
 wasteland in China which has never been reclaimed.
 Therefore, wasteland-reclamation work will undoubtedly
 offer a good opportunity for fully utilizing the sur-
 plus labor force of our country.   In addition, it is
 also necessary to have a large number of the unemployed
 personnel in urban areas participate in agricultural
 production work in rural areas.  In Peking, Shanghai,
 and the Dairen - Port Arthur areas, many unemployed
 personnel and surplus labor forces have left for rural
 areas to take part in agricultural production. 66
 The lack of success in the evacuation of surplus urban population,
 as mentioned before, has forced the Chinese Communists to reconsider
 their entire plan for moving excess labor to the fringes of productive
 land.  Significantly, no migration program was scheduled for 1957, al-
 though movements of excess population from cities have continued.   Instead
 the entire effort was to have been spent on consolidating the 1956 work --
 when 430,000 people 67/ were involved in interprovincial moves -- and
 preparing for the 195  program. 6/  This fact suggests that the Chinese
 Communists now recognize that migration of surplus labor into relatively

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 nonproductive areas is no panacea for employment problems, especially
 when the cost in scarce capital investment funds is realistically
 considered.
 Another significant policy shift has been made in the case of
 working women.  Although women have always assisted in varying degrees
 in farm labor and handicraft work, the Communists encouraged them to
 enter industrial occupations where women had not been represented pre-
 viously.  Women wage workers, under this impetus, increased to approx-
 imately 3 million in 1956, 69 more than 12 percent of the total number
 of wage earners.  Recently, however, this policy has been reversed.
 Now women are encouraged "to restrict themselves to their domestic work
 in the family" in an attempt to convince them that they are "making
 great contributions to society if they do their part in educating their
 children and take care of their husbands." 70
 Having thus complicated the problem of employment by increasing
 the number of competitors for the relatively scarce wage-paying jobs,
 the Chinese Communists are now attempting to work themselves out of
 this self-imposed problem.  The USSR faced a similar paradox on the
 eve of World War II when the Soviet government was encouraging house-
 wives to enter the labor force in as large numbers as possible while
 at the same time acknowledging a surplus of 5 million unused people in
 the agricultural labor force. 1_1  In both the USSR and China the re-
 sponse of housewives to the government's call was impressive, although
 the prime reasons, in both cases, seem to have been the need to con-
 tribute to the earnings of the husband -- which were insufficient for
 the family budget -- and the expansion of child-care facilities.  The
 solution to this problem in the USSR grew out of the enormous loss of
 population in World War II and the subsequent growth of nonagricultural
 jobs.  Because underemployment is far more drastic in China, and because
 there is no basis for predicting a major drop in size of the population,
 and, finally, because nonagricultural employment is scheduled to grow
 slowly through the Second Five Year Plan, the present Chinese Communist
 policy of discouraging the entrance of women into the labor force seems
 to be the only practical alternative.
 In a further effort to slow the growth of nonagricultural labor,
 the Chinese Communists are seeking to divert graduating students and
 apprentices away from the industrial labor force.  Recent policy
 advocates that "those students who are unable to continue further
 studies should be mobilized to take part in agricultural production

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 if their families are in rural areas.  As for those whose families are
 in cities, we should encourage them to take up apprenticeship at the
 public service enterprises and to prepare themselves for seeking em-
 ployment or further schooling in the future." 1.`l  In addition, it has
 been suggested that students who cannot continue their formal education
 would get "state assistance to set up groups to assist one another to
 continue their studies and to learn trades." 73
 As indicated above, Chinese Communist policy on unemployment has
 tended to shift between a "soft line" and a "hard line."  The "soft
 line" has encouraged economic enterprises to retain surplus personnel
 and train them for future opportunities.  This soft approach has also
 encouraged payment of direct relief to the unemployed and subsidization
 of training programs for the jobless.  The "hard line," on the other
 hand, has specified that surplus labor be dismissed with no suggestion
 of training opportunities or relief measures.  This approach has also
 advocated that the government should make the unemployed find work by
 their own efforts without the assistance of the state.  As yet no
 single line of policy has been consistently supported by the government.
 Most recently the tendency has been to stress the difficulties of the
 employment situation and to argue, as did a survey team investigating
 unemployment in Peking, that those who are unemployed do not really
 need to work anyway:
 The survey team.was of the opinion that ours is a
 populous country; at the present time it is also a country
 with a backward economy and low production.  To provide
 employment for all would involve considerable difficulties.
 As long as some member of a family is employed and the
 livelihood of the family can be maintained, it should not
 be necessary for the state to provide employment.
 During the survey the team also discovered that the
 development of diverse types of secondary and handi-
 craft production would not only help the unemployed ease
 their livelihood difficulties to a certain extent, but
 would also be helpful to the general public. 74
 As yet there has been no consistent policy of creating jobs simply
 to keep people occupied.  Work-relief has been used for disaster victims
 in rural areas instead of direct relief, and trainees have had their
 apprenticeship period extended, but keeping surplus labor on the payroll
 merely in order to keep them off unemployment rosters has been strongly

 discouraged.  Practices of paternalism and nepotism, which formerly
 flourished in China, have been drastically cut by the Chinese Communists.
 Raising productivity, at least in official policy statements, is always
 more important than keeping the labor force employed.  This goal, how-
 ever, has not always been achieved.  In 1956, for example, rapid expan-
 sion of wage and salary workers caused a drop in the growth of labor
 productivity through the first three quarters of 1956, 7J when twice
 as many new employees were being added as called for in the plans of
 that year. 76   This upsurge in employment not only exceeded the needs
 for 1956 but also "surpassed the actual needs for 1957," according to
 the National Conference on Labor Assignment, which met in Peking during
 April 1957. 77   This admission of overexpansion in 1956 and readjustment
 in 1957 is not. unique to the labor field but has generally characterized
 the national economy of Communist China in 1956 and 1957.  Labor avail-
 ability, however, will become increasingly abundant in future years as
 the rate of population growth increases.  Productively employing this
 population increase, with the limited investment sources available, is
 steadily being recognized by Chinese Communist planners as the heart of
 their problem, for which no easy solutions are in prospect.
 V.  Prospects.
 Immediate prospects are for continued unemployment in Communist
 China.  The First and Second Five Year Plans, running through 1962, do
 not provide for sufficient new jobs to ease greatly the present con-
 dition of underemployment and unemployment.  With entrants into the
 labor force outnumbering the new jobs in industry and construction, the
 excess of job seekers will have to be accommodated in agriculture, which
 is already burdened with more abundant labor power than it can effi-
 ciently use.  Because the stress of the First Five Year Plan has been
 largely on capital-intensive projects, however, the relatively modest
 demands for labor are expected to make little inroads on the millions
 of rural workers now underutilized by inefficient techniques and in-
 adequate capitalization.  Long-range prospects for employment are
 dependent not only on how rapidly industrialization can be pushed but
 also on how rapidly the population will grow.  If the net annual growth
 of the Chinese population is now about 15 million people, as the Chinese
 Communists claim,      then problems of employment can be expected to
 persist, even with steady progress toward industrialization.
 In spite of conflicting announcements on the level of employment
 in China, there seems to be general agreement that the number of
 workers added in 1956 was excessive and that considerable retrenchment

 CIA-RDP79RO1141 A001000070001-1
 will be required in 1957.  Although the State Statistical Bureau 72
 and the State Economic Commission 8/ have not used the same figures,
 they both have put the number of wage workers at between 24 million
 and 25 million people at the end of 1956.  According to the State
 Economic Commission, more than 1 million workers were employed during
 the fourth quarter of 1956, of whom more than 50 percent were on a
 temporary or seasonal basis.  During 1957, therefore, a reduction of
 approximately 140,000 workers is planned in the total number of wage
 workers in the state plan,* given as 22,400,000 in 1956 and estimated
 at 22,262,000 by the end of 1957. 82
 What is not acknowledged is that the First Five Year Plan called
 for an increase of workers and staff (including both public and private
 employment) from 21 million in 1952 to 25.2 million in 1957.  At the
 end of 1956, according to the State Economic Commission, there were
 24.17 million workers and staff members, of whom 22.4 million were under
 the state plan and 1.77 million still outside of the socialized economy.
 If a reduction of 140,000 workers is planned for 1957, then the number of
 wage workers should total about 24 million at the end of 1957, or 1.2
 million workers fewer than specified in the First Five Year Plan.
 It should be noted that the employment goals of the Five Year Plans,
 unlike the production goals, have not been targets to surpass or over-
 fulfill.  On the contrary, every indication suggests that it has been
 an upper limit beyond which the planners expect depressed productivity
 and inflated wage costs. /  The increased cost of the wage fund is
 already exerting pressure on economic planners to keep the number of
 wage earners in conformity with the previously agreed schedule.  It is
 expected that this pressure will continue through the Second Five Year
 Plan, with efforts being made to keep the growth of wage earners with-
 in the planned limits of 6 million or 7 million workers.  It is assumed,
 of course, that Chinese Communist estimates of planned increases in the
 working force realistically reflect the probable demands of scheduled
 expansion in production facilities.  It appears that the Chinese plan-
 ners, if they are in error on these estimates, are probably erring in
 the direction of overestimating demand for labor.  Thus far the re-
 dundance of labor in the new industrial facilities has been one of the
 *  This number includes, according to the Chinese Communists, "the total
 number of workers and staff members of state-owned enterprises, enter-
 prises operated by cooperatives, state-private jointly operated enter-
 prises, government agencies, people's organizations, and the departments
 of culture, education, science and public health throughout the country,
 which were included in the state plan." J12

 most persistent complaints of those concerned with cost accounting.
 An example of these complaints appeared in a recent authoritative
 statement by Vice Premier Po I-po:
 Our country has a large population and is rich
 in labor resources.  At present there is an excess
 of workers and staff members in the factories, mines,
 and enterprises, throughout the country.  As our in-
 dustry can only be developed gradually, it is im-
 possible to employ large numbers of workers and staff
 members annually.  Therefore, we cannot rely solely
 on industry for the employment of labor.  We should
 put our minds to agriculture, agricultural subsidiary
 production, and handicraft industry, which provide
 greater opportunities. 84
 Assuming that the number of wage-earners increases by an average
 of 1.3 million a year during the Second Five Year Plan as planned,
 this would account for only about one-fourth of the minimum number
 who annually during 1958-62 are expected to enter the labor force in
 search of work.*  The remainder, about 4 million people, would annually
 enter agriculture, handicraft, or some self-employed activity, or would
 remain unemployed.  Agriculture undoubtedly will be forced to absorb
 most of the labor force increase over the period of the Second Five Year
 Plan.  Underemployment in rural areas is both less obvious and less
 costly than in urban areas.  It is therefore likely that surplus urban
 population will continue to be moved out of cities and shifted to rural
 areas for farm work, even though opportunities are.no more plentiful in
 those areas than in cities.  A continued emphasis on massed labor pro-
 jects is probable, therefore, in order to utilize rural labor which might
 otherwise be wasted in unprofitable work.  If Chinese agriculture is to
 continue raising total output, increased capitalization and improved
 techniques will be far more important than increased labor inputs.
 *  Losses to the labor force through death or retirement are expected
 to be quite low through this period.  A survey made in 1955 indicated
 that 92 percent of all industrial and construction workers were below
 the age of 1.5 years and that.only 1 percent of the total were over
 55 years of age.  Workers over 60 years of age included only 0.3 per-
 cent of the total. 8    If this same proportion applied to the 24 million
 wage workers in 1956, then it would follow that only 72,000 wage workers
 were over 60 years of age in 1956.

 Rapid economic development, spurred by emphasis on industrialization,
 would appear to be the long-range solution to the employment problems of
 China.  There is some question, however, whether or not Communist China
 can develop its economy fast enough to provide the necessary capital for
 further investment and at the same time meet the consumption demands of
 its large and rapidly expanding population.  This matter of timing is
 further related to the concentration of investment funds in modern,
 mechanized industrial plants, which obviously are not designed to ease
 the unemployment problem.  The Chinese believe that capital-intensive
 industries will, over the long run, generate a greater surplus for
 capital formation and thus make a bigger contribution to national in-
 come and employment than would the traditional labor-intensive industries.
 In the case of the cotton-textile industry -- as, for example, in
 India (see Table 2) -- it is apparent that small-scale plants not only

 can employ more workers than large-scale plants (per unit of capital
 invested) but also can achieve a higher output for the same amount of
 capital.  In China, similar evidence has been cited for seamless tubing
 plants:  "The funds used for building a highly automatic plant capable
 of producing 60,000 tons of seamless tubing a year are enough to build
 two plants with less degree of automation capable of producing more
 than 100,000 tons of seamless tubing a year." 87   Because there has
 been growing recognition 88  that investment in smaller plants will
 give quicker returns, in both profit and physical output, Chinese Com-
 munist planners are now shifting toward more emphasis on small- and
 medium-scale plants.       This policy shift implies shortcomings in
 previous investment planning -- that is, concentration of investment
 in capital-intensive, modern plants not only used large amounts of
 scarce capital funds but concomitantly failed either to utilize the
 abundant manpower resources or to maximize output.
 Although the comparison of plant size is made within the same in-
 dustry, there are also employment problems involved in investment
 policy between different industries.  Wu Ching-ch'ao, a prominent econ-
 omist, has stressed this fact by pointing out that the Second Five Year
 Plan of Communist China has plans for hiring less than one-fourth of
 the people who can be expected to ask for jobs. 90   To illustrate the
 high cost of raising employment in modern industry, Wu cites the fol-
 lowing examples of the investment cost in India for each additional
 worker by industry 91/:
 Type of Industry
 Investment Required for
 Each Additional Worker
 (Rupees)_
 Basic industry
 20,000
 Consumer goods industry
 8,750
 Service industry
 3,750
 Family industry (including agriculture)
 2,500
 In spite of the far greater cost of raising employment in industry,
 Wu concludes that China must keep the emphasis on rapid industrial-
 ization.  Admitting that this policy will create employment problems
 over the "next few Five Year Plans," Wu recommends birth control as
 the only solution to employment difficulties. 92
 With the population increasing at a reported net gain of approx-
 imately 15 million people a year, birth control has become a major

 objective of the Chinese Communists.  The prospect that the population
 growth of China might level off in the next 10 years, however, is con-
 sidered unlikely, because any decline in birth rates resulting from the
 government's program of birth control would probably be more than bal-
 anced by declines in the death rate.                   In any event, control over the
 growth of population is a long-range solution that has little to do
 with the employment problem over the next 15 years, the labor-force
 candidates for that period having already entered the population.
 The number of Chinese outside the labor force who are neither at
 work nor seeking work is estimated to include more than 320 million
 people in 1957.  This burden of dependency is now growing rapidly as
 reductions in infant mortality allow more and more of the annual crop
 of babies -- believed to number about 30 million a year 93 J -- to
 survive to adulthood.  The proportion of the population aged 0 to 15
 years is expected to increase during the next 10 years, during which
 time the labor-force participation rate will decline.  Thereafter
 the number of entrants into the labor force should increase abruptly
 as the effects of lowered mortality in the post-1950 period are felt
 in the labor force.  The resulting increase in need for employment is
 not expected to be felt before 1965, when the present baby boom reaches
 the labor market; the capital investment necessary to expand oppor-
 tunities for employment, however, will depend on accumulation in the
 interim period.  This accumulation of capital will have to compete
 with the consumption needs of a population which has recently entered
 a stage of rapid growth.
 To summarize, prospects in Communist China for significant changes
 in unemployment and underemployment are largely dependent on official
 policies of investment and manpower allocation.  These policies, with
 their expected effect on employment problems, can be subsumed under
 four general categories:
 1.  A shift of investments to smaller industrial plants can be
 expected to open up new employment opportunities at a relatively
 modest cost.  As this new policy is already being implemented, 94
 it is likely that most of the industrial workers now classified as
 surplus tan be absorbed in the proposed small- and medium-size plants.
 2.  The policy of according priority to heavy industry is expected
 to be maintained.  This policy will continue to require large capital
 investments for each worker added to the labor force, whereas a policy

 favoring consumer, or light, industry would more efficiently utilize
 the large manpower potential, and with lower investment requirements.
 3.  The birth control policy of Communist China is not expected to
 lower significantly the present high rate of population growth, over
 at least the next decade.  Not only is the rapidly growing population
 requiring a large share of the national income for consumption but it
 is thereby limiting capital formation which will be necessary for
 expanding job opportunities in the future.
 4.  The heavy stress placed on socialization by the Chinese Com-
 munists has greatly restricted opportunities in private and self-
 employment.  Recent encouragement of subsidiary occupations in rural
 areas should ease the underemployment problem there, assuming a con-
 tinuation of this relaxed policy.  In urban areas, however, govern-
 mental limitations on self-employment and private employment will
 probably continue to make this sector a poor source for new employment.
 In short, the government of Communist China seems committed to a
 program which offers little hope of expanding job opportunities fast
 enough to keep up with the need. With the population now growing at
 a steadily increasing rate, the demands on the national income for
 both consumption funds and investment funds can be expected to grow
 at an even faster rate.  Only a major shift in investment policy, or
 decimation of the population, could greatly reduce the underemployment
 which is expected to remain through at least the Second Five Year Plan.
