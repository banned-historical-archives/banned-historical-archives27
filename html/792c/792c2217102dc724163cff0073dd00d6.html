 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 "B" USSR. MacArthur Episode Unlikel  to Affect Co rom ;se in,  Korea. A Soviet
 official in Western Europe has allegedly commented that       he dis-
 missal of Gen. MacArthur represents a victory for the "peace" farces .and
 (2) will not make possible a compromise unless US forces leave Korea,, A
 solution on other terms is impossible as both the USSR, and Communist
 China would have no valid argument to give their people. The Soviet official
 stated that the present unfavorable position of Chinese troops in Korea
 25X1 A   is transitory but that the entry into Korea of trop s  now in training,
 z Although
 NMENT
 will change the picture.                               CQ
 this may be only a personal estimate of Sino-Soviet intentions., the pre-
 sent military trend in N. Korea tends to support the report. Should the
 USSR and Communist China wish to negotiate regarding Korea,, the dismissal
 of Gen, MacArthur might afford. a convenient opportunity on which to peg
 such negotiations without "losing .face." However,, Soviet propaganda
 reaction to MacArthurts dismissal indicates that no such move is con-
 templated at this time.
 "B"  EASTERN EUROPE. ALBANIA. Vice Premier J kova    DiffaMj1   1. According
 to Albanian emigre circles in Rome? Vice Premier Tuk Jakova was accused
 of anti-Sovietism at a meeting of the presidium of the Central Committee
 of the Albanian Workers Party (Communist) held on 19 and 20 March,, At
 the meeting Jakova was allegedly charged with negli.gence,,, collaborating
 with anti-Communist resistance since 1946., protecting the clergy and
 releasing known anti-Communists from prison. It is reported that Jakova
 admitted all the charges and was subsequently relieved of his posts as
 Vice Premier and chief of the Soviet-Albanian. Cultural Union. He is
 reported to be in prison together with former Minister of Justice Manol
 Konomi., and OP cadre director Theodor Rebo who are charged with diso-
 25X1A
 25X1 A   beying orders and protecting spies. The same report fore casts a wide
 s read purge of the Albanian Communist Party
 Im CO   lT: The  Tench Minister in Tirana has reported that Jakeva was
 among those in the Communist hierarchy who disagreed with Shehu over the
 implementation of the harsh law against terrorist activities decreed on
 26 Feb. (See OOI Daily Digests of 31 Mar and 2 Apr 51.). For more than a
 year rumors have been in circulation that Jakova was in secret contact
 with the Tito government,
 "A"   POLM. Anti-Soviet Incident in. Stettin,, The US Emb in Warsaw has received
 a report, from two reliable sources of a riot in Stettin on 9 Apr 1951
 following the street killing of two Polish civilians by a Russian officer?
 As a result of the killing,, a crowd immediately began collecting and stoned
 the Russian,, who,, after killing three more Poles, sought refuge in a nearby
 cellar. The crowd demanded that Polish militiamen present shoot the :Russian.,,
 but the militiamen refused. The crowd then became incensed,, shouting that

 TOP SECRET
 the militiamen could and did use their arms against Poles but could not
 even against a Russian murderer, To prevent the crowd from attacking the
 Russian officer, the militiamen fired into the air., with the result that
 the crowd attacked them., killing at least three militiamen and wounding
 others. The demonstration was finally quelled by the Army which surrounded
 the area and arrested some two thousand persons. The US Lrio pointed out
 that because of the complete control exercised by the Polish authorities
 through fear and suppression no rumors regarding this incident are current
 in Warsaw.. (S Warsaw 820, 19 Apr 51). CC      d This incident, if it
 actually happened, is indicative of the bitter hatred by the Poles of the
 Russians and their Communist tools in Poland. Previous reports of popular
 unrest and labor difficulties in Stettin have been received,, (See OC.I
 Daily Digest of 28 Mar 51).
 "B"      Emigration of Jews to Israel Stopped. The Israeli Charge d4Affaires
 in Warsaw has been informed by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 that the Polish Government will no longer permit, the emigration of Polish
 Jews to Israel. The reasons advanced for this decision were Poland's
 manpower needs for the Six Year Plan and Israelts alignment against
 Poland in the present tense international situation. According to the
 Israeli Charge, Polish Government officials desire to retain a strong
 Jewish community in Poland which they hope to transform into a loyal
 Communist bloc. Until 12 Feb 1951 when the last emigrants were permitted
 to depart for Israel, approximately 28,000 Jews out of an estimated
 65,000  had migrated to Israel from Poland. (S Warsaw 821, 19 Apr 51).
 Cam.: Since last July the Polish Goverment has unofficially restricted
 Jewish emigration to Israel, not even permitting professional men such
 as doctors and engineers to leave. This announcement by the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs puts the official stamp on a policy which was already in
 effect,
 "B" YUGOSLAVIA. Yugoslavs Brand Satellite Prevocaticlns as Soviet-aDireete to
 Belgrade Radio,, citing the growing wave of satellite notes and border
 provocations, charges that these incidents are being instigated by the
 USSR to create the impression that Yugoslavia is conducting an aggressive
 policy in the Balkans. A second ulterior motive of the Soviet Union,
 according to Belgrade Radio, is to make use of the situation within
 Albania, which is being exacerbated by agents of reactionary Albanian
 emigres and their imperialist friends in the West.. in order to exert
 pressure on Yugoslavia. The radio broadcast reiterates the Yugoslav
 stand that these machinations against Albania create a pretext for armed
 aggression against Yugoslavia.  R FBLS, 19 Apr 51). CGMIT- As. the
 recent series of diplomatic notes and border incidents has developed,
 Yugoslav propaganda organs have increasingly stressed that these prorvo-
 cations are not isolated acts., but are part o.' a concerted Soviet-directed
 anti-Yugoslav campaign. Yugoslav efforts to pin-_,)oint each of these
 incidents as part of an overall campaign are probably intended to prepare
 the Yugoslav people for any eventuality., as well as to justify the
 acceptance of arms aid from the West.

 "Bn   Q,zech  Closing Yugoslav Consulate in Bratislavia and their ?wn in
 zap Teb, The Czechoslovak-Govt is closing its Consulate in Zagreb on 1
 May and has demanded that the Yugoslav Govt close its Consulate in Bratis-
 lavia by the same date. In a note dated 18 April the Yugoslav Govt has
 announced that it will suspend the work of its consulate in Bratislavia
 on 1 May, but protests this action as a new expression of Czechoslovakia's
 hostile policy whose aim is to bring about further worsening of relations
 between the two countries. (R FBIS, 19 Apr 51). CO MNT: The Czechoslovak
 Consul General was withdrawn from Zagreb in Dec 191+ and the Consulate
 has been operated since that time by one clerk. The Czechoslovak Govt
 recently demanded that the French Consulate in Bratislavia also be closed,
 The Czechoslovak action is not only another provocative action against
 Yugoslaviag but is another step in the program to reduce non-Soviet influence
 in Czechoslovakia.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 "C"     AFGHANISTAN. Prime Minister's Visit ii Washin  M. An extensive program
 for the entertainment of the Afghan Prime Minister, Shah Mahmoud, has
 been arranged for the days he will spend in Washington, beginning 20 April.
 (R State to Kabul 257, 1$ Apr 51).  COMMEENTs Although the Prime Minister
 is visiting Washington unofficially, the attention given him will un-
 doubtedly have favorable repercussions in Afghanistan.
 "B"   PAKISTA. Little Hope for Early Solution of Afghan-Pakistani Di,sput_.
 Colonel Shah, Pakistan specialist in Afghan affairs, upon return from
 Afghanistan where he had. been discussing Afghan-Pakis`}tani relations,
 informed US Embassy that no progress had been made.  Colonel Shah feels
 that most of the tribal Afghans are fanatical Sunnis, more interested in
 the Kashmi.r situation than in the maintenance of the present Kabul regime
 (which has been advocating Pushtoonistan).  Colonel Shah, a Pathan him-
 self, reportedly feels that the GOP should subsidize Afghanistan, admit-
 ting that it could not be depended upon to solve the problem but that it
 was the best immediate compromise.  (C Karachi 972, 1$ Apr 51 - See also
 OCI Daily Digests, 26 Mar and 6 Apr 51).  COMMENT: The US Government in
 early November offered its good offices to help promote a settlement
 between the two countries.  Pakistan has insisted that in any conference
 with Afghanistan the Pushtoonistan issue would not be included on the
 agenda, its position being that the tribal areas which were part of India
 before partition are automatically part of Pakistan.  Afghanistan has
 insisted that Pushtoonistan be discussed.  The opinion of most neutral
 observers is that, while both Pakistan and Afghanistan have been at fault
 in the frontier dispute, Afghanistan bears the major onus for the present
 situation, due chiefly to its intransigency and its anti-Pakistan propa-
 ganda in the tribal areas.  It has long been suspected, moreover, that the
 Indian Government has either directly or indirectly supported Afghanistan
 obstinancy in this matter. Obviously any attempt on the part of Pakistan
 to subsidize the Afghan Government or any elements inside Afghanistan
 would be precarious and would probably produce unfavorable repercussions;
 consequently, it is anticipated that the dispute will remain unsolved.
 RC"   INDONESIA. Masiumi-PNI Coalition Probable. Mohammed Roem, a key Masjumi
 Moslem  Party leader, told US Ambassador Cochran that so much ground for
 agreement exists between the Masjumi and the Indonesian Natiopal Party
 (PNI) that it should be possible to form a coalition government at an
 early date.  He said that views of the two parties are so similar on most
 issues that the policy of the prospective government would differ little
 from that of the last one,which was formed by the Masjumi.  Roem confided
 that President Soekarno is responsible for some of the remaining differences
 between the two parties, since it is he who has prodded the PNI to insist
 upon a denouncement of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union.  The MasJumi

 .prefers to await the- report of a special government mission currently study-
 ing Netherlands-Indonesian relations before committing itself to a definite
 position on the issue.  (C Djakarta 1458, 19 Apr 51).  COMNfENTs Upon the
 failure of Sartono of the PNI to form a cabinet, President Soekarno
 appointed as joint cabinet formers the chairmen of the Masjumi and. the PNI.
 Support of both parties--which are the two largest in Indonesia-mis essential
 for the formation of a stable government.
 "A"   CHINA. USSR Ranks Foremost in China's 1,950  Foreignrae3e. A Peiping broad-
 cast of 8 April announced that Communist China's foreign trade in 1950
 was several times greater than in 19/,+9 and that the USSR was the principal
 trading partner of China.  According to the broadcast, nearly a quarter of
 China's total foreign trade in 1950 v-as with the USSR, as compared. with
 only 8 percent the previous year. (C FBIS9 Far Eest Information Abstracts
 from Rodio Broadcasts, 16 Apr .41).  COMENTg Independent sources confirm
 the high level of Communist Chinas foreign trade in 1950 - estimated at
 between US$l billion and US$11- billion.  Even allowing for the higher
 price level in 19509 this total compares favorably with the value of China's
 foreign trade - US$700 million - under the National Government in the
 peak post-war year of 1947.  Although its foreign--commerce in 1950 was
 still mainly with the West, China has, like the Fastexn European satellites,
 come to depend increasingly on the USSR as a market and source of supply.
 This orientation of China's trade toward the USSR has been promoted by a
 crr.r3it e rnement in February 1950 and by subsequent barter arrangements.
 25X1X
 "C r' A l o, od Sino-Soviet Treaty.                             forwards a
 sum: ,ar?y of a purported Sino-Soviet treaty allegedly ssgnecx by Molotov and
 MAO Tse-tung in December 1950.  The principal points relate to (1) "acqui-
 sition of all Southeast Asia" by Chinese forces under Soviet direction;
 (2) "occupation of all Korea," using satellite forces if necessary; (3) 25X1A
 Soviet provision of 3000 aircraft, plus -naval craft and other materiel;
 (4) assault on Taiwan, at Peiping's discretion; (5) occupation of Kowloon
 25X1X portion of Hong Kong; and (6) completion of arrangements for above program
 by end of  ugust 1951.                notes that "source warns that a fake
 treaty  as ,,repared and permitted to leak out." whereas this treat,y is
 "believed to be genuine."
 C0  ENT: Alleged copies of secret Sino-Soviet treaties have been periodi-
 cally provided by Chinese (principally Nationalist) sources for years;
 they have invariably been proven or judged spurious.  Such documents--
 usually compilations of plausible rumors--gain credence from the presumed
 existence of unpublished Sino--Soviet agreements relating to their respective
 roles in the 'liberation, of Asia and in preparing for global hostilities.
 Source's ' arning" demonstrates his awareness of the volume of earlier
 fabrications, but lends no greater credibility to his own version,  It is
 regarded as most improbable that any such source will be in a position to
 provide a "genuine" copy of top-secret Sino-Soviet agreements.

 "C"   CHINA. UK Korean Forces to Garrison Ho   Ko  . The announcement that
 Hong Kong's 28th Brigade would replace the   l.'i.7th  Commonwealth Brigade in
 Korea and that the 27th would return to garrison Hong Kong is considered
 as an indication that no increase in local forces Is expected in the near
 future,  The relief in Korea was scheduled to take place, by battalions,
 between 19 April and 9 May,  While the return. of the 27th will provide
 Hong Kong with battle seasoned. troops, the possibility exists that morale
 and disciplinary problems will arise because the 27th had earlier expected
 to return to the UK, and because it will now garrison an area surrounded
 by Chinese, a people with whom they have recently been in combat, (S
 Hong Kong, Joint Weeka 15, 13 Apr 51).  CODR ENT: A recent statement by
 Maj. Gen. Evans, commander of Hong Kong land forces, expressing complete
 confidence in ability of present forces to "meet and obliber-ate" any
 Chinese ground attack, suggests the possibility that reinforcements for
 the area are not considered necessary at, this time,                         25X6
 25X6
 states
 that (1) the Chinese Communists are making preparations for seizur?e of
 Nationalist-held islands off Chinese coast, but have no concrete plans
 for either ground, or air attacks on Taiwan at this time; (2) a paratroop
 exercise took place recently in North Manchuria; (3) 60% of Red troops in
 Tibet have been withdrawn and sent to Yunnan's Indo-China border and to
 Manchuria; and. (4) by Soviet advice, the number of students in military
 universities is rapidly being increased in preparation for organizing
 special divisions which, when necessary, will participate in military
 ventures outside Korea under a "volunteer" label,  (S Hong Kong 3058,
 18 Apr 51).  COMMENT: Attacks have long been anticipated on certain off-
 shore islands still. held by the Nationalists.  There; have been several
 reports of paratroop activity in Manchuria and China proper.  The shift
 of the 18th Army Group from the Tibetan area to Korea has been confirmed.
 The above is the first report received on organization specifically of
 students into "volunteer" divisions.
 "A"   KOREA. Jets Reported in North Korean Air Force. An Air Force operational
 summary reporting clashes on the Sino-Korean border between UN and Communist
 aircraft on 16 April, states that two of the MIGs engaged in the air
 battle had North Korean markings "consisting of a red star encircled by
 a red band, and a blue band as the exterior circle."  (S FEAF Tokyo AX
 6431, 17 Apr 51),   COMMENT: This is the first observation of MIGs with
 North Korean markings; heretofore it has been believed that all jets in
 combat in this area were flown by the Chinese Communist Air Force (and.
 possibly by Soviet pilots),

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 t'C" GERMANY.  Berlin Communist Party Censured.      US representatives in
 Berlin -report recent signs that the east German Communist Party
 (SED) is dissatisfied with the performance of its Berlin branch
 The SED paper Neues Deutschland has detailed various "weaknesses"
 of this branch-- particu ar y in west Berlin, charging it with
 (1) insufficient propaganda work, (2) failure to exploit the
 grievances of workers and citizens, and (3) retreating before the
 "war mongering" prevalent in west Berlin.  The organization was
 especially censured for holding its meetings in east Berlin, when
 it is allowed to hold them in the western sectors without reporting
 to the police or obtaining special permissions  (C Berlin unnumbered,
 11 Apr 51).  COMMENT:  This is the first recent indication of SED
 dissatisfaction with its Berlin branch and comes in the wake of
 recent purges within the west German Communist Party.
 "B"  FRANCE.  Communists Retain Control of Railway Unionists.  The Com?-
 munist-doming e  General Labor Con e era ion (CGT  is maintaining
 its strong position among national railway workers judging from
 a recent election which gave CGT candidates two-thirds of the votes
 cast.  Non-Communist union leaders believe wage discontent explains
 the CGT's ability to retain labor's support despite increasing worker
 distrust of CGT political activity.  (R Paris 6354, 19 Apr 51),.
 COMMENT:  Support for CGT delegates is not an accurate gauge of
 ommunlst strength, particularly in the railways where the CGT was
 unable to secure decisive support even in the course of the major
 1948 strike campaign.
 "B"  AUSTRIA.  WFTU Transfers Its Headquarters to Vienna.  The Communist-
 omminated World Fe .rat on o   ra e Unions  WFTU  has decided to
 transfer its headquarters from Paris to Vienna- following the recent
 ban by the French Government on further Paris meetings.  The Federation's
 secretariat declares that Vienna was chosen for its favorable location,
 and for the "cordial welcome which the Austrian workers are;sure to
 give the Federation."  The Viennese Communist paper calls the develop-
 ment a "great distinction" and "moral aid" for Austrian workers who,
 it is sure, will do all possible to show themselves worthy of the
 high honor.  (U Vienna 2388, 19 Apr 51).  COMMENT:  Transfer of this
 Communist-front organization to Vienna may ma e additional. difficulties
 for the Austrian Government, already under pressure from labor, which
 is restive over economic conditions and open to exploitation by. the
 local Communist Party.
 "C"  ITALyo  Communist Move to Force Resignation of the Government Defeated.

 from Parliament, 308 to 150 with 18 abstentions.  The Chamber of
 Deputies' debate concerned the constitutionality of the Prime Minister's
 appointment of pro-tem Cabinet ministers to replace the three Saragat
 Socialist representatives who recently resigned.  The Monarchists,
 neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement and anti-Communist Unitary Social-
 ists (PSU) abstained from voting on the Togliatti motion which
 criticized the Government for not resigning at the time and called
 for Italy's withdrawal from the NATO.  These parties, the Liberals
 and perhaps even some Christian Democrats reportedly would have sup.-
 ported another motion, presented by the philo-Communist Nenni Social-
 ists (PSI), which was not put to a vote.  This motion merely declared
 the Cabinet rearrangement unconstitutional and thus would have amounted
 to a vote of censure.  (R  Rome 4722, 18 Apr 51; R FBID, 17 Apr 51.,
 18 Apr 51; U NY Times, 18 Apr 51).  COMMENT:  The support which the
 PSI motion found among deputies of t Fe -non--Communist parties outside
 the Government is indicative of the increasing resentment of these
 parties at what they regard as high-handedness on the part of De Gasperi's
 Christian Democrats.  The possibility of some Christian Democratic
 support for a vote of censure is consistent with recent evidences of
 dissension within the party.  US observers report diminishing support
 for the Christian Democrats and -a growing anti-clerical feeling among
 the general population which may; show up in the farm of absenteeism
 from the polls at the forthcoming municipal elections u

 "B"   SWITZERLAND.  Swiss Construction of Centurion Tanks to Fill IM  ' tait
 efense -Gap.  The British, Foreign -0  ice  as in ormed- a US Embassy
 o .ficial that the Swiss have been authorized to manufacture Centurion
 tanks under license.  (S State Desp 4644, 30 Mar 51),  C0181ENTs  For
 many months the Swiss have been trying to obtain approxim=a e~yy five
 hundred up-to-date tanks.  The acquisition of Centurion tanks by the
 Swiss army will overcome one of the most serious weaknesses in Swiss
 defenses.  The decision by the Swiss to manufacture7-,their on tanks
 indicates that the Swiss have given up hope of obtaining this weapon
 from the US.
 ''C"   CHILE,' Communist Party Purge.  A high-ranking member of the Communist
 Party of Chile (PCCh)      stated that a purge is being carried out
 by the Central Committee, and that many. names are "on the list'".  The
 purge began following discovery of a movement-reportedly led by
 Luis Reinoso, important and trusted party member in charge of
 organization and labor matters which was directed against PCCh Secretary
 General Galo Gonzalez.  One Santiago radio commentator claims that
 the purge is a result of a "strong Titoist movement", and a party
 member" has remarked that nationalism has taken "strong root in Chilean
 Communism".  The Central Committee is investigating, the youth element,
 "which is considered to be the principal focus of rebellion aimed at
 exerting pressure on the Committee to change its underground policy".

 Several members including Reinoso have been expelled. CO1v  NT:  The present purge may reflect
 the existence of a hardening, bu                            as yet unmeasured, opposition to'
 Gonzalezts leadership and policies,-which have evolved in the past
 year.  Reportedly the PCCh Political Commission recently decided to
 25X1A         seek new blood to replace many old-timers.  Dissatisfied Communist
 elements have.included some old-line militants who, displeased
 generally with the Gonzalez leadership, have been concerned with
 national problems, a group of Trotzkyites, and anarchists who favor
 positive direct action.  Past information has indicated that the
 Communist youth generally has supported Gonzalez.  It is possible
 .that the present tendency for many party leaders .to demand strict
 fulfillment of better defined instructions after a year of vacillating
 policy has caused disgruntled elements to collaborate in a movement
 which may.have influenced segments of the Communist youth.

 interest in obtaining the names and addresses of individuals who
 have Soviet or satellite connections and who are planning to return

 financial help is being offered to these individuals.   Those persons
 who plan to return from Canada, Alaska, and Mexico are of special
 interest in this campaign.  Upon return to their homeland, they are    25X1A

 UK Willing to Concede To Soviet on Agenda,  The UK Government feels
 that "if an agreed agenda can only be obtained at the price of concessions
 to the Soviet government, which in (the UK) view are harmless, then these
 concessions should not be refused", according to a written exposition of
 the British position by the chief of the UK delegation.  The UK holds that
 even if the Soviet position we3e accepted on initial listing of German dis-
 armament and on the order for discussing reduction and level of armaments,
 Soviet propaganda would be unable to deflect the Western powers from con-
 tinuing their declared policies.  Western concessions should be presented
 in a group to the Soviets to see if agreement could not thus be more quick-
 ly reached.  Only if such a move failed could the UK even consider adopting
 a "split agenda" between Soviet and Western proposals.  In a later discus-
 sion, the UK delegate expressed his view that greater harm to the West
 would ensue from the breakdown of the talks than from adoption of a Soviet-
 slanted agenda.  The French and US delegations continue to oppose this
 British approach.   (S, S/S Paris 6328, 19 Apr 51; S, S/S Paris 6337,
 19 Apr 51).  COIIENT:  This is the clearest statement yet presented of the
 UK position, which regularly has minimized the importance of the order of
 items on the agenda.as compared to the demand of the British public opinion
 for an effort to reach agreement with the Soviet Union through the convening
 of a Foreign Ministers' Conference.
 "B"  Possibility USSR Considering Breakdown. of Meeting.  The Chief of the US
 delegation suggests tentatively that the Kremlin may now be debating the
 fundamental question of whether or not to continue the conference.  Ambassa-
 dor Jessup notes that in this case the standard Soviet procedure would be a
 violent propaganda blast from Gromyko in the near future which would make it
 plain that. there was no hope of agreement while asseiting Western responsibili-
 ty for the deadlock.  Mr. Jessup suggests that the Soviet Government might
 then propose the Five Power Conference (i.e. including Communist China)
 which has received such increasing prominence in Communist propaganda.

 "C"   CHINA. Soviet Atomic Energy Program in Sinkiang.
 claims that  1  10,000 tons of equipment has arrived EattIM11iforr es ab
 25X1C   lishing an atomic energy plant,(2) Pontecorvo, an atomic scientist who has
 been missing from the UK since February, and several Soviet atomic scien-        25X1A
 tists are at Tihua, and (3) the Soviets are making a determined search for
 uranium in Sinkiang Province.  Meanwhile, according to a rumor reported from
 Trieste, Pontecorvo is allegedly directing the building of a uranium concen-
 trating plant in Czechoslovakia.
 25X1A                                  COMMENT:  Pontecorvo&s present activities are no
 reliably known but he is presumably working for the USSR atomic energy pro-
 ject.  It is doubtful that the USSR plans to build an atomic energy plant in
 Sinkiang.  Its program in that remote province will more likely be limited to
 the development of Sinkiang as a source of uranium ore.  The equipment. mention-
 ed by the MND may be used in connection with Soviet plans to mechanize the
 mining of uranium in Sinkiang, where low-grade deposits are known to exist.
