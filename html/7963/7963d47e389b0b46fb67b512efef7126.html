 These thirteen target categories are compatible with the Functional Area of Imagery Interpretation established under the National
 Tasking Plan. To enhance the analysis of readout on operationally associated targets, each target is reported relative to its primary functional
 association (i.e., missile range tracking facilities are reported under "MISSILE RANGES," fly-away airfields at aircraft plants are reported
 under "INDUSTRY," airfield nuclear weapons storage facilities are reported under "AIR" etc.-.
