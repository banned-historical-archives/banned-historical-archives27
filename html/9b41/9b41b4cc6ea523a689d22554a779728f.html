 VIETNAM:   TEMPORIZING IN HANOI
 The Communists have sharply denounced the US mil-
 itary moves in Cambodia and over North Vietnam, but
 they have stopped short of any decisive new course
 of action either on the battlefield or at the Paris
 talks.   In Saigon, the Thieu government faces a
 threat of new disturbances from student and Buddhist
 groups, and some despondency in its own ranks may
 incline the regime toward a tougher stance.

 The Thieu government in Saigon finds itself so overloaded with prob-
 lems of political discontent that it is unable to deal effectively with all of
 them at once. Various opposition leaders and groups are acting boldly in the
 face of the government's hesitancy to take more repressive measures. A
 number of top officials are weighing in with gloomy prognostications, the
 police forces have been unable to cope with the daily pace of demonstra-
 tions, some violent, and the government has had to return several battalions
 of regular troops to Saigon, both because of the political turmoil and
 because of an increasing threat of Viet Cong terrorism in the capital.
 Off-balance because key lines of authority are not working, the Thieu
 government may be facing a real crisis.
 On the military front, activity reached substantially higher levels last
 week in I and IV Corps, perhaps indicating the beginning-of the second phase
 of the Communists' spring offensive, but also possibly representing a Com-
 munist effort to divert allied attention away from sweep operations inside
 Cambodia.
 The allied operations aimed at Communist sanctuaries in Cambodia
 have so far not encountered sizable numbers of enemy forces, but have
 uncovered large quantities of supplies. Communist military headquarters
 elements have apparently been able to relocate fairly rapidly to avoid the
 allied sweeps.
 Deeper inside Cambodia, the Communists continue to press hard on the
 Cambodian Army. Two provincial capitals were reportedly captured late in
 the week, and the Communists are still blocking several major transportation
 routes between Phnom Penh and the eastern and southern borders of the
 country.
 On the international scene, Hanoi reacted to US military thrusts into
 Cambodia and bombing of certain targets in North Vietnam by boycotting
 the session of the Paris talks scheduled for 6 May. Peking's denunciation of
 the US moves did not imply any larger role for China in Indochina, but did
 contain a sharp personal attack on President Nixon. Communist China also
 announced the formal severance of relations with Cambodia and in the same
 breath recognized the newly formed Cambodian government in exile, Siha-
 nouk's first major step toward an attempt to re-establish himself in Cam-
 bodia.
 The Indonesian-initiated Asian conference on Cambodia now is sched-
 uled for 16-17 May in Djakarta; 12 nations (all non-Communist) of the 21
 invited have agreed to attend. Although there is little prospect that the
 conference will have any practical effect on the over-all Cambodian situa-
 tion, it probably will generate a degree of international political support to

 VIETNAM:   TEMPORIZING IN HANOI
 Hanoi has temporized so far in
 its public reaction to the allied
 ground operations into Cambodia and
 the US air strikes against targets
 in North Vietnam.   The Communists
 boycotted the plenary session of
 the Paris talks on 6 May, but said
 that they would return to the table
 next week unless the bombing con-
 tinued.   Their failure to rupture
 the conference completely after
 threatening for months to do so
 shows Hanoi's reluctance to close
 off any political options.
 The Communists'  propaganda re-
 action to the new allied moves is
 in the same cautious vein.   They
 lashed out at Washington for the
 ground and air attacks, but care-
 fully avoided committing themselves
 to forceful retaliation.   They
 also have made some general threats,
 but concrete decisions on their fu-
 ture course are yet to be made.
 Hanoi has contended that the air
 strikes violate Washington's
 "pledge"  in November 1968 to halt
 all bombing of the North.   This
 could mean that the Communists,
 in turn, no longer feel constrained
 about large-scale use of the De-
 militarized Zone or attacks on ma-
 jor South Vietnamese cities.
 Hanoi's slight delay in rec-
 ognizing Sihanouk's "government in
 exile" may be caused by the same
 instinct to temporize.   The North
 Vietnamese extended recognition to
 the new "government" a day after it
 was announced, but only after six
 countries,  including China,  already
 had weighed in.   Unlike the Chi-
 nese, Hanoi has not yet announced
 withdrawal of its remaining per-
 sonnel from Phnom Penh..   Thus,  even
 at this late hour,  the Vietnamese
 Communists seem to be reluctant to
 close off completely the possibil-
 ity of dealing with Lon Nol and his
 associates.
 One of the reasons for Hanoi's
 caution may be difficulty in con-
 certing with Peking and Moscow.
 Party First Secretary Le  Duan's pro-
 longed stay abroad suggests that
 difficulties have cropped up.   He
 has been away for three weeks and
 the Polish press reports that he
 took a side trip to Warsaw,  leaving
 there on 6 May.   His absence from
 Hanoi at such a critical time
 strongly suggests that the Vietnam-
 ese are being pulled in different
 directions by their principal al-
 lies, with Peking pressing mili-
 tancy and Moscow counseling modera-
 tion.
 It is also possible that Hanoi
 has been sufficiently surprised by
 the turn of events in Indochina that
 it needs some time to sort out all
 of the implications and to make new
 decisions.   This process, however,
 probably would not impair the Com-
 munists'                                                                        ability to react rapidly
 in tactical battle field situations.
 Communist Military Reactions
 Communist battlefield reactions
 to the US and South Vietnamese oper-
 ations against their long-held sanc-
 tuaries in Cambodia have varied, but
 no major efforts to stand and fight
 or to counterattack have developed.

 Although there was little di-
 rect confrontation with Communist
 combat forces during the opening
 stages of the allied sweep opera-
 tions,                       ground fighting picked up
 as the week progressed and the op-
 erations were enlarged.   Cumulative
 casualties as of 7 May show more
 than 3,000 Communists killed in
 contrast to South Vietnamese losses
 of 162 killed and 840 wounded. Amer-
 ican casualties totaled 37 killed
 and 79 wounded.   Additionally,
 enemy losses included the seizure
 of more than 4,000 weapons and
 1,000 tons of rice.
 Inside South Vietnam,  increased
 enemy activity in IV Corps last
 weekend may have signaled the be-
 ginning of the anticipated "second
 phase" of the Communists spring cam-
 paign.                         The enemy effort gained mo-
 mentum early in the week with some
 strong rocket and mortar attacks
 against US facilities, but they were
 not as intense as those in the early
 April upsurge.   The pattern of prep-
 arations for this phase suggests
 Mortars, recoilless rifles, SKS carbines, antiaircraft
 guns, and light machine guns captured by ARVN
 units in Parrot's Beak area.

 that there will be less coordina-
 tion than the previous month, with
 attacks taking place as each unit
 completes its local preparations.
 In some areas, moreover, enemy of-
 fensive plans may have been thrown
 off schedule or altered as a result
 of the allied cross-border opera-
 tions or other pre-emptive actions.
 Higher levels of enemy action
 will probably continue well into
 May.   Plans for renewed hostilities
 by enemy forces in the central
 coastal provinces,  to get under way
 on 7-8 May, were revealed in a re-
 cently captured document.
 Throughout much of the country
 the enemy's local force units could
 step up the tempo of shellings and
 small-scale attacks on very short
 notice.   In addition,  first-line
 combat units are in a position to
 threaten certain allied bases and
 urban centers,  especially in north-
 ern Quang Tri Province just south
 of the Demilitarized Zone,  in cen-
 tral Thua Thien Province,                                                                             and in
 the coastal lowlands of Quang Nam
 and Quang Tin provinces.    In  II
 Corps, Communist forces are mostly
 concentrated near allied Special
 Forces camps in the international
 tri-border area.   Although many of
 the enemy main forces in III Corps
 are preoccupied with allied opera-
 tions,  they could launch attacks
 designed to divert attention away
 from the allied operations in east-
 ern Cambodia.   Most of the major
 enemy units in the delta provinces
 have avoided contact with South Viet-
 namese forces and apparently are
 not ready for large-scale ground
 operations in the immediate future.

 Violence and Pessimism
 Increase in -Saigon
 The government moved strongly
 this week to head off renewed dis-
 turbances by student and Buddhist
 groups,  and its actions will prob-
 ably engender new charges of re-
 pression.   Following an emergency
 cabinet meeting,  at which officials
 expressed concern that Communist
 agents might be able to exploit po-
 litical unrest in Saigon, the gov-
 ernment ordered all schools and uni-
 versities in the Saigon area closed
 indefinitely.   There had been indi-
 cations that militant student lead-
 ers in Saigon were gaining control
 of the antigovernment protests and
 were organizing further demonstra-
 tions.
 Another serious situation may
 develop out of a clash between two
 antagonistic Buddhist factions for
 control of a key pagoda in Saigon.
 The government is already being ac-
 cused by the militant An Quang sect
 of having intervened on behalf of
 its rival.   The possibility of
 further violence between the Bud-
 dhists represents a new and poten-
 tially explosive problem for Thieu
 government, which has indicated that
 it is prepared to use force if neces-

 SIHANOUK FORMS His GOVERNMENT IN EXILE
 "The Royal Government of Na-
 tional Union" organized by Siha-
 nouk in Peking this week is a
 blend of experienced politicians
 and energetic leftists.   The new
 government is nominally under the
 direction of the  "National United
 Front of Cambodia," which is
 chaired by Sihanouk,  and it prob-
 ably will continue to function
 for the time being in the Chinese
 capital.
 Penn Nouth,  a prominent Cam-
 bodian politician who has acted
 as prime minister in past Sihanouk
 governments, was picked to head
 the new government.   Nouth's po-
 litical prestige and his loyalty
 to Sihanouk made him the logical
 choice for the position, but be-
 cause of age and poor health he
 is likely to be only a figure-
 head.   As expected,  a number of
 well-known Cambodian leftists
 were given key cabinet portfolios,
 including national defense,  in-
 terior,  and information.                 These
 individuals,  three of whom were
 leading members of the National
 Assembly until Sihanouk's 1967
 purge forced them to flee Phnom
 Penh,  at one time had some fol-
 lowing among the youth and in-
 tellectuals in Cambodia.   The
 fact that they were not present
 for the government's unveiling
 in Peking suggests they may ei-
 ther be in Hanoi or with Com-
 munist forces  fighting in Cam-
 bodia.
 The Chinese quickly endorsed
 the new government and then an-
 nounced the rupture of diplomatic
 relations with the Lon Nol regime.
 Although Hanoi and the Viet Cong
 also have recognized Sihanouk's
 government, they have stopped short
 of severing their slim diplomatic
 ties with Phnom Penh.   The Soviet
 Union has not yet taken a position
 on Sihanouk's government.
 In Phnom Penh, meanwhile,
 the Lon Nol government apparently
 intends to break diplomatic re-
 lations with the Provisional Rev-
 olutionary Government and resume
 relations with Saigon.   The Cam-
 bodians are also moving to im-
 prove relations with Thailand,
 but at a slower pace.
 On the military front,  (see
 map on page 4)  government forces
 continue to fare badly in their
 engagements with Communist troops.
 The Communists are still threaten-
 ing to cut Phnom Penh's overland
 access to the southern and eastern
 provinces.   Their reported capture
 of the capitals of Kratie and Mon-
 dolkiri provinces were their most
 significant and bold military
 moves to date.   In addition, they
 captured the strategic Mekong
 River ferry crossing at Neak Lu-
 ong,  some 30 miles south of Phnom
 Penh.   Initial efforts by the Cam-
 bodian Army to retake Neak Luong
 were unsuccessful.   Government
 troops regained control of the gulf-
 port town of Kampot, but Communist
 elements reportedly still had the
 southern towns of Takeo and Angtas-
 som surrounded.
 The Cambodian Army commander
 of the southern border provinces
 recently told a South Vietnamese
 general that morale was low in
 the Cambodian Army and that he

 was pessimistic about the over-
 all situation.   He claimed that
 the Communists were succeeding
 in isolating towns and securing
 a firm hold in rural areas. He
 asserted that many village and
 hamlet chiefs in Svay Rieng Prov-
 ince were Communists,  and others
 in Kompong Cham Province who re-
 mained loyal to the government
 were being killed by the Com-
 munists.
 In an effort to boost mor-
 ale,                              the government recently is-
 sued a communique asking its
 troops to hold on for another ten
 days, after which time the Com-
 munists,  according to the communi-
 que, will be unable to keep fight-
 ing.   The message also noted that
 aid for Cambodia is coming from
 everywhere, particularly from
 ethnic Cambodian troops recently
 flown into   Phnom Penh from South
 Vietnam.
 US military operations in
 Cambodia will almost certainly
 improve the spirits of the lead-
 ers in Phnom Penh and help con-
 vince hard-pressed Cambodian Army
 units that their situation is far
 from hopeless.   Additionally,  in
 the international sphere, the
 forthcoming mid-May Asian confer-
 ence of non-Communist nations on
 Cambodia should help generate   25X1
 more political support,  and pos-
 sibly some materiel aid   for the
 Lon Nol government.
 CHINA FOCUSES ATTENTION ON CAMBODIAN DEVELOPMENTS
 This year's May Day cele-
 brations in Peking were held
 amidst heightened national atten-
 tion to the latest developments
 in Cambodia.   Party chairman Mao
 Tse-tung and his designated-heir
 Lin Piao made public appearances
 for the first time in over six
 months, while the featured for-
 eign guest was Norodom Sihanouk.
 On the domestic side,  the
 celebrations revealed no major
 changes in China's ruling line-up,
 but several important leaders
 failed to show and Peking has
 offered no explanation for their
 absence.   The most notable absen-
 tee among the politburo members
 was Peking boss Hsieh Fu-chih,
 who may be ill or out of the cap-
 ital on some assignment related
 to his additional duties as min-
 ister of public security.   Aside
 from the few puzzling absentees
 from the top leadership ranks,
 the most interesting feature of
 the turnout was the unusually
 large number of officials in at-
 tendance who were identified as
 members of the Peking-based mil-
 itary, party, and government
 machinery.   Their presence sug-
 gests that some of the positions
 in the central departments and
 ministries that were decimated
 during the Cultural Revolution
 are now being filled.

 Indochinese summit conference
 and his announcement on 5 May
 of the official formation of his
 government-in-exile.   Predictably,
 the Chinese loudly acclaimed the
 conference, declaring at the same
 time that the Chinese "resolutely
 oppose" efforts to utilize the
 UN or "any other international
 organization or conference" to
 settle the Cambodian problem.
 The Chinese also blasted the
 Soviets for UN Ambassador Malik's
 encouragement of new Geneva-type
 consultations on Indochina and
 wrote off Indonesia's planned
 Asian conference on Indochina.
 The Chinese role in the
 Indochina summit conference was
 almost certainly far larger than
 public disclosures suggest.   Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai himself was
 probably in attendance, and may
 have urged a more militant line
 than that finally adopted by the
 publicly identified conferees.
 Peking obviously is attempting
 to play the "people's war" card
 with respect to the Indochinese
 situation;  its negative attitude
 toward any sort of negotiations
 on the issue may have made it
 more difficult for Hanoi to con-
 sider such a ploy.   The Chinese
 have probably pledged increased
 materiel support to the actual
 combatants in Indochina, but
 there is no indication that
 Peking plans to intervene in
 the conflict itself.
 Peking wasted little time
 in formally recognizing Sihanouk's
 newly formed Royal Government of
 National Union.   In making the
 announcement,  Premier Chou En-lai
 declared that Peking had officially
 severed diplomatic relations with
 Phnom Penh and was withdrawing
 all staff of the Chinese Embassy
 and Chinese experts."   The Chinese
 ambassador in Phnom Penh subse-
 quently met with Cambodian lead-
 ers and an arrangement was appar-
 ently worked out for reciprocal
 withdrawal of Cambodian diplomatic
 personnel from Peking.   This is
 the first time Peking has taken
 the initiative in breaking rela-
 tions with another state.   The
 move probably was in train for
 some time and flows logically
 from previous Communist actions
 and pronouncements.
 Peking's initial reaction
 to President Nixon's speech on
 30 April and to US bombing raids
 in North Vietnam on 1 and 2 May
 has been relatively restrained.
 The official government statement
 contained a "stern warning" against
 US provocations and reiterated
 China's amorphous pledge to pro-
 vide  "powerful backing"  for the
 Indochinese people in their war
 against the US.   Peking, however,
 did not commit itself to a direct
 role in Indochina, but instead it
 seemed to imply that the Indo-
 chinese could handle the situa-
 tion by themselves.
 Peking saved its best punches
 for personal assaults on President
 Nixon.    The Chinese described him
 as a "god of plague and war" and
 an "executioner whose hands are
 dripping with the blood of the
 Indochinese people."   The Presi-
 dent was also described as a "ma-
 licious war criminal" and the US
 as being "unscrupulous,  truculent,
 and treacherous."   These attacks
 represent China's most virulent
 commentary against the US in sev-
 eral months,  and suggest that Pe-
 king may use the forum of the
 Sino-US Warsaw talks later this
 month to further castigate US pol-
 icy in Indochina.

 USSR REMAINS NONCOMMITTAL ON INDOCHINA
 Authoritative Soviet state-
 ments early this week made clear
 Moscow's concern over the trend
 of events in Indochina.   On 4 May,
 the Soviets took the unusual step
 of calling a press conference to
 dramatize their opposition to
 President Nixon's announcement of
 30 April.
 Premier Kosygin personally
 read the text of a government
 statement denouncing US air raids
 on North Vietnam and "interven-
 tion"                  in Cambodia.   The statement
 contained Moscow's strongest per-
 sonal attack on the President to
 date.   The Soviet Premier took
 pains to stress that US activity
 in Indochina is contributing to
 a worsening in US-Soviet relations,
 but he did not go beyond previous
 pledges of support for Hanoi.
 Kosygin refused to be drawn
 out on the question of the legit-
 imacy of the present government
 in Phnom Penh.   Now that Sihanouk
 has formed his  "government-in-
 exile" and Hanoi and Peking have
 recognized it, however, Moscow
 may soon feel compelled to follow
 suit.   Kosygin also spoke nega-
 tively on immediate prospects for
 a diplomatic solution in Indo-
 china,                          saying that "this is not
 the time for meetings, but for
 actions."   He also promised that
 Moscow's  "comprehensive aid"  to
 Vietnam would be reviewed in the
 light of the current situation.
 The press conference and the
 fact that the Soviet Premier per-
 sonally delivered the attack on
 the President's policies were
 undoubtedly meant to underline
 the seriousness with which current
 US actions are viewed.   There is
 little indication, however,  that
 Moscow feels a need at present to
 commit itself to any dramatically
 new course of action.
 Moscow's attitude seems guided
 by the notion that only China or
 the US can hope to profit from a
 widening of hostilities in Indo-
 china.   The Soviets may now be
 counseling Hanoi to avoid prema-
 ture overreaction to Washington's
 latest moves, but the USSR will
 not fall far out of step with
 North Vietnam's ultimate reaction.
 The Soviets seem also to be re-
 surrecting various proposals for
 united Communist action in aiding
 Vietnam.   There have been a few re-
 cent propaganda broadcasts which
 suggest that the Soviets have re-
 vived this line.   These proposals,
 like those following the intensi-
 fication of the conflict in 1965,
 have probably been raised primarily
 for the purpose of blackening
 China.   The broadcasts themselves
 are cast in such a way as to be-
 tray Moscow's probable view that
 Peking is likely to be no more
 receptive than it was in 1965.

 principal fire base overlooking
 Attopeu town. The provincial
 capital itself remains under Com-

 Enemy forces also launched

 damage resulted, but the raid in-

 creased apprehensions about Com-
 munist intentions in the pan-
 handle.   Local Laotian commanders
 claim to have evidence of substan-
 tial enemy troop movements into
 the Toumlane Valley and the Bol-
 ovens Plateau.
 There is some evidence that
 the Communists may increase the
 threat to the provincial capital
 of Saravane.   Some unusual enemy
 troop movements, have been re-
 ported in areas north and west
 of the town,  and handbills were
 distributed in Saravane announc-
 ing that it will be seized by the
 Communists on 20 May.   Similar
 warnings appeared in Attopeu be-
 fore it was attacked.
 In the north,  the Communists
 confined their activity to in-
 creasing pressure on the Bouam
 Long outpost north of the Plaine
 des Jarres and launching an in-
 effective rocket attack against
 Long Tieng.   Government forces
 have regained some high ground
 within rocket range of Long Tieng
 and Sam Thong.   They believe the
 enemy is having increasing dif-
 ficulty getting enough food and
 ammunition.   An assault on the
 Meo strongholds remains as a real
 possibility, but the Communists
 could have elected to postpone
 this undertaking in favor of
 consolidating their hold on the
 Plaine.

 MALAYSIA WORRIED ON ANNIVERSARY OF 1969 RIOTS
 The Malaysian Government is
 displaying considerable nervous-
 ness as the anniversary of last
 year's postelection communal riots
 approaches on 13 May.   Although
 there is no evidence that any
 group is planning disturbances to
 mark the occasion, government of-
 ficials are trying to damp down
 rumors that trouble will break
 out.
 Last week Prime Minister
 Rahman announced that the govern-
 ment is "ready and capable" of
 tackling any incident that might
 occur "before, on,  or after 13
 May."   Another official has de-
 nied stories that government of-
 ficers have been refused leave
 during the first part of May.
 The government has issued curfew
 passes and other contingency pre-
 cautions appear to be under way.
 At least seven persons have been
 arrested recently on charges of
 rumormongering,  and shopkeepers,
 most of whom are Chinese and In-
 dian, have been officially warned
 not to heighten  Malay   resentment
 by raising prices if people start
 to stockpile food in anticipation
 of trouble.
 Last year, when political
 campaigning was in full swing,
 the atmosphere was more highly
 charged than it is at present.
 The 1969 riots resulted in the
 killing of over 150 people, mostly
 Chinese, and a state of emergency
 was imposed on the country.   The
 government's efforts over the past
 year to assuage racial tensions
 and return the nation to a condi-
 tion in which parliamentary elec-
 tions could be resumed have been
 low key and unimpressive.   If any-
 thing,                                                                 the country has become more
 polarized, with the Chinese lying
 low, the radical Malays unhappy,
 and the government only marking
 As was the case last year,
 the Communists, and by associa-
 tion the Chinese population in
 general, are being billed as the
 potential source of trouble.   The
 setting of booby traps attached
 to Communist flags and the dis-
 tribution of Communist pamphlets
 that took place in late April
 throughout West Malaysia were
 designed to mark the 40th anni-
 versary of the Malayan Communist
 Party.   But more important, the
 organizational ability demon-
 strated by these actions has
 added to the government's worries
 at this time.   Even the prime
 minister, in the past more fair-
 minded toward the Chinese commu-25X1
 nity than many of his Malay col-
 leagues, has been making anti-
 Chinese statements.
 The government appears fully
 ready to handle most incidents
 that might occur, but widespread
 disturbances would sorely tax the
 security forces.   In the event
 of trouble, the predominantly
 Malay forces would be tempted to
 delay intervention in situations
 where their Malay compatriots are
 getting the best of it.   Whether
 or not the Communists become in-
 volved in any outbreaks this year.
 the Chinese would again be the
 losers.

 SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH FRUSTRATES NORTH KOREANS
 Despite intense pressures from
 Premier Kim Il-song,  the North
 Korean economy is not growing fast
 enough to allow an increase in al-
 ready high defense expenditures,
 nor is it increasing the chances
 of successfully winding up a plan
 that has dragged on embarrassingly
 into its tenth year.
 Finance Minister Choe Yunsu,
 in his budget message to the Su-
 preme People's Assembly on 20
 April,  avoided output claims  for
 1969.   His  figures indicate that
 revenue and expenditures  fell even
 further behind plans than is usual
 for North Korea.  Revenue increased
 six percent instead of the 19 per-
 cent planned,  and expenditures
 grew by five percent instead of
 24.   The disappointing performance
 of the economy was attributed to
 unfavorable weather conditions
 and a cut in consumer-goods prices.
 Defense expenditures have
 been the subject of intense propa-
 ganda since 1966, particularly so
 after the Pueblo and EC-121 inci-
 dents.             Last   year,   Pyongyang
 called for another step-up in
 absolute defense spending, al-
 though as a percentage of total
 state revenues it was to remain
 at the 30-31 percent in force
 since 1966.   Pyongyang did not
 meet the 14-percent increase
 planned for 1969, apparently be-
 cause the share of funds devoted
 to defense had already been near
 the maximum supportable by the
 economy.   Defense spending is
 planned to remain at 31 percent
 of total expenditures in 1970,
 but,  on the basis of the planned
 rate of budget growth,  absolute
 defense spending is expected to
 rise by 23 percent.
 Kim I1-song has insisted
 that economic growth under a so-
 cialist system can reach 15--20
 percent annually, but the North
 Korean economy in recent years
 has been growing only at an esti-
 mated four to five percent a year.
 This rate is  less than half South
 Korea's growth rate,  a comparison
 that North Korea finds extremely
 disconcerting.
 Economic development in North
 Korea slowed considerably in the
 middle 1960s following Soviet ces-
 sation of economic aid because of
 Pyongyang's alignment with China
 in the Sino-Soviet dispute.   The
 aid cut-off was one of the primary
 reasons  for failure of the orig-
 inal 1961-67 plan.  An extension
 of the plan to 1970 was adopted
 in order to gain more time to
 achieve the more important goals.
 The Soviet Union resumed
 economic aid during 1968.   About
 30 million dollars was probably
 drawn on credit that year and
 another 30-40 million dollars is
 estimated to have been provided
 in 1969.   Nevertheless, prospects
 for achieving the major goals of
 the current plan remain uncer-
 tain.   Pyongyang, however, no
 doubt will proclaim success when
 the plan nominally ends in Sep-
 tember and a new five year plan

 Soviet propaganda shifted into high gear this week following President
 Nixon's announcement that US troops had moved into Cambodia. A series
 of strident press and radio commentaries directed at the President personally
 and at Washington in general was capped on 4 May with nationwide mass
 meetings and an unusual press conference by Premier Kosygin. Moscow's
 concern about the situation in Indochina prompted Kosygin's appearance.
 Ile bitterly asserted that US activity there has contributed to a worsening of
 Soviet-US relations.
 In answer to a direct question on the future of SALT, Kosygin charged
 that the recent US actions "do not strengthen mutual trust, without which it
 is very difficult to hold the talks." (In Vienna, Deputy Foreign Minister
 Semenov echoed Kosygin's remark, but did not let the issue interfere with
 the conduct of the talks themselves.) Another sensitive area in US-Soviet
 relations, the Middle East, was mentioned. Kosygin virtually admitted that
 Soviet pilots were in Egypt, but did not specify their role. Judging by
 Kosygin's remarks on China, Moscow believes the occasion called for down-
 playing its problems with Peking. Kosygin said nothing critical and signaled a
 Soviet desire to continue the Peking talks.
 Kosygin's criticism of the President by name was something of a
 turning point in itself and suggested that Moscow's opposition to the policies
 of the Nixon administration will now be voiced more stridently. That this
 new hostility coincided with the signs of Brezhnev's strengthened position in
 the leadership suggests that the forces at play in Moscow might now favor
 some hardening of their line in dealing with Washington. It is unlikely,
 however, that such an approach will lead soon to any drastic changes in
 Soviet policy toward SALT, the Middle East, or China. In each of these
 areas, Moscow's policy has all along been based on fundamental calculations
 of risk and opportunity.
 East and West German officials met in Bonn this week to prepare for
 the summit meeting in Kassel. One day prior to the meeting, East German
 Premier Stoph wrote to Chancellor Brandt criticizing Bonn for claiming that
 East German citizens are subject to West German law and for opposing East
 German attempts to join international organizations. Stoph's language and
 that used in describing the letter in the press, however, implies that Stoph
 still intends to meet Brandt on 21 May.
 Ireland's Prime Minister Lynch unexpectedly cracked down this week
 on hard liners in the cabinet who have opposed Dublin's dovish policy on
 Ulster. He expelled the agriculture and finance ministers and willingly
 accepted the resignation of a third. Lynch obviously had advance support of
 most members of his party in parliament and they gave full backing to his

 USSR RESUMES NORMAL MILITARY AID DELIVERIES
 Soviet seaborne military de-
 liveries to Communist and non-
 Communist arms clients have re-
 sumed following an unprecedented
 month-long interruption while at-
 tention was riveted on the intro-
 duction of SA-3 surface-to-air
 missile equipment into Egypt.   Ne-
 gotiations for military assist-
 ance, however,  continued through-
 out that period and resulted in
 another deal with Iran.   Talks
 also were held with Cuba, Paki-
 stan,  and Nigeria.
 During the halt in military
 shipments to other arms clients
 mil-
 itary equipment,  including SA-3s,
 arrived in Egypt.   The shipments
 included ZSU-23-4 self-propelled
 antiaircraft guns and a new radar
 designed to provide early warning
 against low-flying aircraft that
 recently appeared in Egypt.   Nei-
 ther type of equipment had been
 observed before outside the USSR
 or East Europe.
 During the past month Soviet
 deliveries to Egypt have returned
 to a normal pace and have included

 helicopters, and a large number of
 assorted trucks.   Routine military
 deliveries also have been resumed

 world clients.

 BREZHNEV ENHANCES ROLE AS "PRIMUS INTER PARES"
 General Secretary Brezhnev con-
 tinues to press his advantage on the
 Soviet domestic political front.
 There are signs, however, that at
 least some of his colleagues are at-
 tempting to ensure that this not un-
 dermine the principle of collective
 leadership.
 Brezhnev was again the regime
 spokesman at the May Day celebration
 and his  "collected works"--1964 to
 1970--are due to be published later
 this year.  His growing public pre-
 eminence was also underscored by the
 preliminary Pravda report on nomina-
 tions of mem elf the politburo to
 the new Supreme Soviet to be elected
 on 14 June.   Although each member
 stands for election in only one dis-
 trict, he traditionally receives ad-
 ditional honorary nominations.   The
 number he receives provides a good
 reading of his relative political
 standing in the hierarchy.

 Brezhnev, when compared to the
 last election in 1966, is set off
 more distinctly from Premier Kosygin
 and President Podgorny,  and the lat-
 ter two are now close to equality.
 Consistent with other signs over the
 past year, party secretary Kirilenko
 has risen in the listing and now ri-
 vals Suslov.   Shelepin, predictably,
 has dropped back.
 The one surprise is the blatant
 slighting of Mazurov, a first deputy
 premier and former Belorussian party
 boss.   His poor showing supports
 earlier evidence that Brezhnev may
 have been playing politics with the
 Belorussian party organization. Brezh-
 nev's four-day visit to Minsk in
 March and the inclusion of the pres-
 ent Belorussian party chief, Masherov,
 on the Brezhnev-led delegation to the
 treaty signing in Czechoslovakia, may
 be an attempt to wean away Mazurov's
 provincial support. Mazurov has
 been
 critical o  Brez nev s leadership
 and has been rumored as a likely
 25X1
 successor to Kosygin.
 25X1
 Rumors that Kosygin will step
 down due to poor health continue
 to circulate
 his unprecedented
 televised press conference this
 week on Southeast Asia and his par-
 ticipation in the delegation to
 Prague has helped to restore a
 semblance of collective leadership.
 There is some evidence that
 Brezhnev's dominance has been a
 source of controversy and concern
 within the politburo.   In his Lenin
 anniversary speech on 21 April, Bre-
 zhnev defined collective leadership
 in a self-serving manner.   When the
 speech appeared in the press the
 following day, however,  a sentence
 had been added which brought his
 remarks into line with standard
 formulations on the subject.

 SOVIETS SEE CZECH FRIENDSHIP TREATY AS TRIUMPH
 The principle of "socialist
 internationalism," which Moscow
 used to justify its intervention
 in Czechoslovakia, has received
 its most impressive endorsement
 to date in the new Soviet-Czech-
 oslovak friendship treaty.
 The treaty formally requires
 the two signatories to take ac-
 tion in defense of socialist in-
 stitutions wherever they may be
 threatened--the chief tenet of
 the so-called"Brezhnev Doctrine"--
 and implicitly commitsthe Czech-
 oslovaks to fight with the USSR
 in a war against China.   It also
 commits Prague and Moscow to act
 to strengthen mutual cooperation
 in all spheres of relations.   The
 language is forceful enough to
 reinforce the fears some Eastern
 Europeans have had about the
 treaty.
 The importance that the So-
 viets ascribed to the treaty is
 indicated by the composition of
 the delegation sent to Prague for
 the signing on 6 May.   It was
 headed by party General Secretary
 Brezhnev and also included Premier
 Kosygin, politburo member Shelest,
 candidate politburo member Mash-
 erov, central committee secretary
 Katushev, and Foreign Minister
 Gromyko.   In addition,  Soviet
 chief of staff General Zakharov
 was on hand at the head of a
 large military delegation.
 Almost every member of this
 assemblage played a key role in
 the events of 1968-69 that put
 an end to the liberal reform move-
 ment in Czechoslovakia.   Both Kosy-
 gin--who reportedly had been cool
 to the intervention--and Katushev
 conducted crucial negotiations at
 that time with the Czechoslovaks.
 Shelest,  the Ukrainian party chief,
 who reputedly was one of the loud-
 est advocates of the intervention,
 took part in the crucial Dresden,
 Warsaw, and Bratislava meetings that
 preceded the invasion.   General
 Zakharov was vital in the planning
 and execution of the invasion it-
 self.
 For these Soviet leaders,  the
 treaty serves to vindicate the in-
 tervention and to undercut critics
 within the Communist movement and
 even within the Soviet party.     As
 politburo member Kirilenko noted
 last month,  "everyone can now see"
 that Soviet policies were "fully
 justified."   Brezhnev himself is
 probably the chief beneficiary of
 the treaty.   He reportedly had been
 a target for criticism because of
 his handling of the Czechoslovak
 crisis,  and he is likely to use
 this belated justification of his
 policies to advantage.
 Czechoslovak leader Husak has
 also gained.    The Soviets are ob-
 viously content with his perform-
 ance  as the chief architect of
 the "normalization."   The Soviet
 delegation treated Husak with con-
 spicuous warmth during its stay,
 in effect giving him another strong
 endorsement.   Husak will undoubt-
 edly use it to strengthen his po-
 sition against his domestic crit-
 ics.

 ARMS CONTROL TALKS RECESS
 The US-USSR draft treaty to
 limit the use of seabeds  for mili-
 tary purposes remains the best
 hope for substantive progress at
 the 1970 Geneva disarmament talks,
 which recessed last week after
 more than two months of frus-
 trating discussion of the key
 issues.  Following  several weeks
 of intensive review in the cap-
 itals,  the 25 conferees will re-
 sume their talks on 16 June in
 an effort to show some success
 before the fall session of the
 UN General Assembly.
 In their revised version of
 the treaty,  the superpowers took
 into account most of the criti-
 cisms raised during the past year.
 Dissatisfaction with the Moscow-
 Washington positions on some
 maritime issues could, however,
 become so strong as to prevent
 a Geneva endorsement of the treaty.
 Sweden heads a lengthy list of
 nations that want the text to
 include a reference to "appro-
 priate international procedures"
 as one method of verifying com-
 pliance with the treaty prohibi-
 tions.   Moscow opposes such an
 addition,  regarding it as an
 opening that could result in an
 international regime that would
 also govern peaceful uses of the
 ocean floor.   A meeting this
 week at Montevideo of nine Latin
 American states that claim a 200-
 mile limit of their territorial
 waters could determine the ex-
 tent to which that subject will
 further muddy the treaty's pros-
 pects.
 There has been no movement
 toward agreement on either of the
 principal options  for controls
 on chemical and biological weap-
 ons  (CBW) :  the Soviet draft
 CBW convention and the British
 draft BW treaty.   Most of the
 Geneva conferees continue to
 favor action that would deal with
 both CW and BW, but they do not
 regard the Soviets' verification
 mechanism--appeal to the UN Se-
 curity Council to investigate
 suspected violations--as an ade-
 quate response to their concern.
 The Italians have secured
 the creation at Geneva of an in-
 formal nine-nation working group
 on general and complete disarma-
 ment                                                                           (GCD), whose members include
 NATO, Warsaw Pact, and nonaligned
 nations, but exclude the three
 nuclear powers represented at
 the talks.   The working group is
 unlikely to offer a substantive
 GCD proposal soon.   Moscow re-
 cently indicated a revived inter-
 est in GCD, but it is believed
 that the Soviets would not want
 such activity to divert attention
 from the primary issues before
 the conferees--CBW and the sea-
 beds treaty.
 Another disarmament subject,
 a comprehensive ban on nuclear
 tests, probably will not be ac-
 corded much time until the direc-
 tion of the SALT talks becomes
 clearer.   Should the Geneva con-
 ferees be unable to show substan-
 tial progress in any arms control
 area,  there may be demands for
 a convening of the UN Disarma-
 ment Commission, an unwieldy
 entity certain to serve as a
 focal point for grievances against
 the superpowers                          25X1

 SINO-SOVIET TALKS
 Top Chinese and Soviet lead-
 ers have again expressed their in-
 tention to continue the Peking
 talks despite the lack of signifi-
 cant progress during the past six
 months.   The talks have apparently
 been in recess since the departure
 of chief Soviet negotiator Kuznet-
 sov for the Lenin centenary cele-
 brations in Moscow, but he probably
 will return to Peking shortly to
 resume the discussions.
 Chairman Mao,  in an apparently
 cordial conversation at the Peking
 May Day ceremonies,  told the dep-
 uty head of the Soviet delegation
 that China wished the talks to re-
 sume "as soon as possible" and
 gently prodded the Soviets as to
 when Kuznetsov would return.   So-
 viet Premier Kosygin, in his sur-
 prise news conference on 4 May,
 indicated that the Soviets plan to
 continue the talks,  and voiced the
 opinion that both sides were inter-
 ested in reaching a settlement.
 REMAIN ON DEAD CENTER
 Despite these relatively con-
 ciliatory comments,  however, offi-
 cials on both sides have flatly
 stated that no significant: progress
 has yet been made. Kuznetsov him-
 self told a Western diplomat that
 stories of Soviet troop withdrawal
 from the border were without founda-
 tion and that Moscow would not con-
 sider making such a move unilaterally.
 In addition,  the Chinese charge
 in Moscow said in late April that
 Peking has not given agrement to So-
 viet Ambassador-designate Stepakov
 and has no present intention of ap-
 pointing its own ambassador to Mos-
 cow.  Another Chinese official has
 confirmed that Peking views the
 Stepakov appointment as a ,possible
 Soviet attempt to downgrade the ne-
 gotiations.   The Soviets,  in turn,
 have indicated they may seek Chinese
 approval for shifting the talks to
 Moscow. Peking, however, will prob-
 ably be reluctant to accede to such
 a move.
 SOVIETS SQUANDER NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE OIL
 Continuing Soviet efforts to
 boost current petroleum output have
 resulted in serious losses of na-
 tural gas and crude oil.   Failure
 to realize the full potential of
 older producing fields is beginning
 to impinge on export capability and
 makes the Soviet need to develop
 new fields more imperative.
 In the Mangyshlak Peninsula,
 natural gas that was obtained as a
 by-product of crude oil was flared
 off as waste instead of being uti-
 lized or recycled into deposits to
 maintain pressure.   As pressure de-
 clined, numerous wells ceased pro-
 ducing.   The Soviets finally in-
 jected seawater into the deposits
 in an attempt to increase pressure
 and avoid costly pumping.   The
 Mangyshlak oil, however,  is highly
 viscous,  and the seawater cooled
 the oil until it solidified and be-
 came unrecoverable.  As a result, a
 large portion of the Mangyshlak oil
 reserves, which approximated the re-
 serves on Alaska's North Slope, was
 lost,  as were the great quantities
 of gas that were wantonly burned.
 Similar mistakes have been made
 in Belorussia, where a newspaper re-
 cently scored petroleum producers
 for flaring 350 million cubic meters
 of natural gas during the last five

 years. Crude oil has had to be
 pumped prematurely at a number of
 wells because of declining pressure,
 and pumping will be required at still
 more wells in the near future.
 At one Belorussian deposit, many
 wells are idle because of mechanical
 problems,  and production from active
 wells has been increased.   This ap-
 proach will result in fulfillment of
 the current production plan but will
 reduce ultimate recovery of oil from
 this deposit alone by some 100,000
 metric tons.
 Tremendous waste of crude oil
 and natural gas also has occurred
 in the immense Urals-Volga and West
 Siberian fields and elsewhere.   Many
 unrecoverable pockets of oil have been
 formed by improper water injection.
 Last year some 10 billion cubic me-
 ters of gas,  about one fourth of
 all the gas produced in conjunction
 with oil in the USSR, was flared.
 Moreover,  such waste is continuing.
 In many cases, the exposure of scan-
 dalous waste reportedly has led only
 to unfulfilled promises that short-
 comings will be corrected.
 A number of factors contribute
 to the Soviets' profligate treatment
 of their petroleum resources.   The
 incentive system induces maximum
 production in the short-run regard-
 less of technical requirements and
 long-run consequences.   Soviet pe-
 troleum technology and equipment are
 not up to Western standards.   More-
 over, responsibility for oil and
 gas extraction is divided between
 two ministries, resulting in fre-
 quent failure to apply the best
 techniques available for exploit-
 ing associated deposits of oil
 and gas.

 ROMANIA COURTS THE ARABS
 Romania has made a strong bid
 in recent months to improve its re-
 lations with the Arab world, par-
 ticularly with Egypt.
 The Romanian Government has
 never fully recovered its political
 standing in the Arab world since it
 refused to join the USSR and the
 other Warsaw Pact countries in
 breaking relations with Israel af-
 ter the June 1967 war.   Romanian-
 Arab relations fell to a new low
 last August when Bucharest raised
 its diplomatic mission in Tel Aviv
 to embassy level.   Widely consid-
 ered a coup for Israel, the move
 was denounced by Arabs and Commu-
 nists alike.   Iraq recalled its
 charge and Egypt recalled its am-
 bassador, while the Sudan and Syria
 broke relations entirely.
 The Romanians still insist on
 implementation of the 1967 UN reso-
 lution as a solution to the Arab-
 Israeli conflict, but since early
 this year they have been at pains
 to demonstrate limited support for
 the Arab cause in other ways.  Bucha-
 rest staged an international day of
 solidarity with the Arab people on
 25 January.   In February the au-
 thoritative party daily Scinteia
 condemned the Israeli bombe g of
 the Egyptian civilian factory at
 Abu Zabal.   Visits to Cairo by a
 Romanian trade union delegation in
 February and by Foreign Trade Min-
 ister Burtica in March were empha-
 sized in the Romanian press as evi-
 dence of Bucharest's friendly in-
 tentions.   Finally, in a speech to
 the Romanian parliament later that
 month, Foreign Minister Manescu ap-
 pealed for a "full normalization" of
 relations with all Arab countries,
 and significantly, did not mention
 Israel.
 Nevertheless,  the problem that
 probably touches the most sensitive
 Arab nerve has been the emigration
 of Romanian Jews to Israel.   This
 emigration had totaled several thou-
 sand yearly, but was abruptly cut
 off following the June 1967 war.
 In October 1968 it was reportedly
 allowed to resume in trickling num-
 bers.   Reports conflict on whether
 such emigration is still under way,
 but in view of Romania's other moves
 toward reconciliation with the Arabs,
 it is doubtful.
 The Romanians probably feel
 that their policy of neutrality and
 friendship with all has become some-
 what lopsided in the Middle East in
 favor of Israel.   Moreover, while
 they are apprehensive about the con-
 sequences of deeper Soviet involve-
 ment in the Arab-Israeli conflict,
 they do not want to be isolated as
 anti-Arab.  By extending a friendly
 hand to Cairo now they hope to re-
 establish their credentials in the
 Arab world without seriously endan-
 gering their good relations with

 Israeli claims and Egyptian reports since mid-April have pointed to a
 larger and more autonomous role by Soviet military personnel in Egypt, but
 to date there has been no evidence of an aerial engagement between Soviet
 and Israeli pilots. Israeli officials this week reiterated their concern over the
 Soviet presence, but indicated they would proceed cautiously in an apparent
 hope that direct Israeli clashes with Soviet forces could be avoided. Tel
 Aviv's concern over the increasing casualties being inflicted by Egyptian raids
 has so far been manifested only in a higher level of air attacks in the
 immediate area of the Egyptian cease-fire lines.
 Egyptian President Nasir's May Day speech included an appeal to the
 US to force Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories or at least to
 refrain from providing additional support to Israel. Nasir termed this a "final
 appeal for the sake of peace in the Middle East," and warned that further US
 augmentation of Israel's military superiority would affect US-Arab relations
 for decades to come.
 Political violence in the Indian state of West Bengal has gained nation-
 wide publicity as Naxalites-pro-Peking Communist extremists-have been
 staging hit-and-run demonstrations in the Calcutta area. "President's Rule"
 (control from New Delhi) was imposed on the state last March, and although
 the security situation is not likely to get out of hand, the stepped-up
 violence is a cause for concern.
 The launching of the Chinese space satellite has intensified the debate
 in India on acquiring nuclear weapons, but the government still denies it has
 any intention of going nuclear.
 Celebrations for the third anniversary of the Greek military coup of 21
 April 1967 began Sunday following the Greek Orthodox Easter week.
 Premier Papadopoulos reaffirmed more confidently than ever the regime's
 policy of returning to constitutional rule only when the country is ready.
 Security for the celebrations was very tight, and no incidents have yet been
 reported.
 Zanzibar and East Germany have apparently reached an impasse over
 new trade and aid agreements after more than a month of negotiations,
 The Zanzibaris have long been dissatisfied with the poor
 quality of East German goods and services.
 President Milton Obote of Uganda announced that his government
 would purchase a majority interest in nearly all of the country's industries.
 This nationalization will affect several US companies that have small invest-
 ments in oil distribution, banking, and insurance.

 ISRAEL PROCEEDS CAUTIOUSLY WITH SOVIETS IN EGYPT
 The Israeli Government has con-
 tinued to express its  concern over
 what it claims to be growing Soviet
 involvement in Egypt and has sought
 to raise international alarm, par-
 ticularly in the US.      At the same
 time, Tel Aviv, while avoiding at-
 tacks deeper into Egypt and possible
 contact with Soviet pilots, contin-
 ued to mount heavy air attacks along
 the canal and the Gulf of Suez.   The
 Israelis have restated their will-
 ingness for a cease-fire and peace
 talks, but have shown growing irri-
 tation with the increasing number of
 Israeli casualties along the canal.
 These have been approaching the lev-
 els of the summer of 1969, which at
 that time obliged Israel to step up
 its attacks on Egypt.
 Prime Minister Golda Meir and
 two top Israeli military officials,
 Minister of Defense Dayan and chief
 of staff General Bar-Lev, have all
 manifested Israeli reluctance to get
 involved with the Soviets in Egypt,
 but have emphasized Israel's de-
 termination to fight to defend it-
 self and to resist any attempts to
 force them from the present cease-
 fire lines.   Mrs. Meir said that
 Israel was not at war with the So-
 viet Union and had no plans to fight
 one  "but we will not run away if it.
 (war)  becomes necessary for self-
 defense."        Dayan,  in a speech to
 students in Haifa,  said that Is-
 raeli armed forces had had no air
 clashes with the Soviets and hoped
 they would not.   He claimed that Is-
 rael halted its deep penetration
 raids around Cairo because "they had
 served their purpose," but added--
 perhaps more significantly--"now
 that the Russians have entered the
 Page 2 2
 area, we prefer to wait and see what
 we shall be able to do."   Reflecting
 the Israeli desire for a solid show
 of US support in the new situation,
 Dayan said he would like to see the
 US  "as a real tiger with teeth...
 stand up to the Russians."   Dayan
 also sounded what might be a warn-
 ing when he charged that Soviet air
 defense support was enabling Nasir
 to seize the initiative along the
 canal; he noted that the Israeli
 casualty rate had jumped from 9
 killed and 47 wounded in March to
 27 killed and 62 wounded in April.
 Bar-Lev, in a briefing given
 to visiting US National War College
 students,  also stressed Israel's
 current cautious posture.   Asked
 what Israel was going to do about
 the Soviet pilots, Bar-Lev was non-
 committal and said only that the
 Israeli armed forces were gathering
 all the information they could on
 the Russians.   He claimed that the
 Soviet and Arab aim was to force a
 peace settlement on Israel that
 would put it back to the pre-June
 1967 borders.   The chief of staff
 insisted that Israel would maintain
 the status quo until there was a
 chance for "real peace."   Also pres-
 ent was the Israeli director of mil-
 itary intelligence, General Yariv,
 who said that Israel did not take
 lightly the international complica-
 tions involved in the presence of
 Soviet pilots and would exercise
 caution.   But he averred that Is-
 rael would act to defend its exist-
 ence and said what Israel needed
 now was hardware, especially air-
 craft, and a US  "deterrent posture"
 toward the USSR.

 Israeli officials have this
 week repeated their desire for a
 cease-fire and a peace settlement.
 None of these statements indicates
 any change in Israel's  legal require-
 ments for a settlement and may have
 been designed largely for domestic
 and international consumption.   Note-
 worthy of Israeli thinking was a re-

 NASIR ISSUES APPEAL AND WARNING TO US
 In a lengthy review of the Arab-
 Israeli confrontation before an as-
 semblage of workers on May Day, Na-
 sir appealed to the US to order Is-
 rael to withdraw from the Arab ter-
 ritories it occupies and warned that
 a harmful united Arab reaction would
 result from any new US aid commit-
 ments to Israel.
 Nasir called on President Nixon
 to order an. Israeli withdrawal,  and
 if this were not possible, at least
 not to give any new political, mili-
 tary,  or economic aid to Israel.
 Nasir characterized his speech as a
 "final appeal for the sake of peace
 in the Middle East."   Following the
 speech, Egyptian officials person-
 ally conveyed Nasir's                     "peace appeal"
 to the French and the British ambas-
 sadors.
 Nasir has often criticized US
 support for Israeli  "expansionism,"
 and the Egyptians have frequently in-
 dicated they believe that the US has
 the power   or influence to force Is-
 rael to do its bidding.   Nasir's
 speech thus  follows the usual Egyp-
 tian line, but goes somewhat further
 in addressing the plea to President
 Nixon personally and in conveying
 the appeal to other interested par-
 ties.   No new concessions or fresh
 approaches to the Arab-Israeli im-
 passe were offered by Nasir,  however.
 In conjunction with his appeal
 for peace, Nasir made an apparent
 bid to head off any further US aid
 to Israel.   He warned that if the
 US took another step to confirm   25X1
 "Israel's military superiority,"
 it would affect US-Arab relations
 for years.
 In his address, Nasir did not
 directly mention Israeli and US
 charges that Soviet pilots flying
 operational missions have increased
 the USSR's military commitment to
 Egypt.   He did, however,  refer to
 a recent "political propaganda cam-
 paign against the USSR," and charged
 that it was designed to hide the
 fact that the Egyptians were now
 taking the initiative militarily
 and was meant to open the way for
 a "new escalation of US assistance
 to Israel." F                         -1  25X1

 ARMY-FEDAYEEN CLASHES IN JORDAN WEAKEN KING'S POSITION
 The clash last weekend be-
 tween Jordanian troops and com-
 mando elements,  coming on the
 heels of fedayeen charges that
 Jordan is plotting to kill com-
 25X1        mando leaders, has further eroded
 King Husayn's position.
 Saturday's incident was
 touc e    off when a small Fatah
 unit began lobbing shells across
 the Jordan River near the section
 of the East Ghor Canal that is
 now under repair.   After the Is-
 raelis returned fire, Jordanian
 Army units moved against the
 fedayeen in an effort to impose
 a cease-fire.   Two Jordanian sol-
 diers and one commando were re-
 ported killed.   Elements of at
 least three fedayeen organizations
 in the area then attacked the Jor-
 danian troops;                in the ensuing
 fighting, the commandos'  camps
 were destroyed and their arms
 and provisions seized.
 The Palestine Armed Strug-
 gle Command  (PASC),  coordinating
 body for five of the major fed-
 ayeen organizations, immediately
 cited the army's action as fur-
 ther proof that army leaders are
 plotting to crush the fedayeen
 movement.   Earlier, one of the
 commando groups had announced that
 it had foiled a plot by Sharif Na-
 sir,  the head of the army,  to assas-
 sinate Fatah's Yasir Arafat and
 George Habbash,  leader of the
 Popular Front for the Liberation
 of Palestine.   The PASC called
 on Jordanian soldiers to resist
 their commanders and prevent the
 army from being turned into a
 "force for the protection of
 enemy settlements and installa-
 tions."   According to press re-
 ports, however,  commando leaders
 subsequently held an all-night
 session with army commanders in
 an attempt to stave off any new
 flare-ups.
 Nevertheless, the incident
 seems to have confirmed growing
 suspicions among the fedayeen
 and their supporters that the
 regime has been cooperating with
 the Israelis to keep the cease-
 fire lines quiet and to extermi-
 nate the commandos.   Much caustic
 criticism of the King and of
 Sharif Nasir is apparently be-
 ginning to circulate throughout
 the country,  and the more radical
 commando groups are distributing
 broadsides playing up Sharif Na-
 sir's assassination plot. FI

 CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT
 A new civilian government of
 "national union" in Dahomey, com-
 plete with a three-headed presi-
 dency, was sworn in this week,
 but it holds  little prospect for
 bringing long-term stability to
 this coup-ridden former French
 colony in West Africa.
 The joint presidency is
 manned by the country's three ci-
 vilian political kingpins and
 chief regional spokesmen--Hubert
 Maga,  Justin Ahomadegbe,  and
 Sourou-Migan Apithy.   They suc-
 ceed an inept and divisive mili-
 tary triumvirate that has kept
 Dahomey in a state of near chaos
 for the past five months.   Maga,
 a northern leader who was the
 country's first president, is
 "first among equals" and premier;
 that role is supposed to rotate
 among the three presidents every
 two years.   Cabinet ministries
 have been apportioned among sup-
 porters of the three presidents
 and of former president Zinsou.
 Former President Soglo toasts three other
 former presidents-Apithy, Maga, Ahomadegbe-
 who make up new "national union" government.
 Page 2 5
 INSTALLED IN DAHOMEY
 The final agreement on the
 new government came only after
 the army had applied heavy pres-
 sure on civilian politicians,
 including a threat that they might
 find themselves out of the pic-
 ture completely if they did not
 arrange a compromise.
 Given the depth of the mutual
 hostility among the three presi-
 dents as well as their conflicting
 political ambitions,  it is highly
 unlikely that the compromise will
 last for long.  Moreover, even
 if the government survives its
 own built-in divisions,  there are
 a number of unresolved conflicts
 within the military, and between
 the military and civilian leaders,
 which could explode at any moment.
 At the center of the most
 pressing of these disputes is
 the question of the future status
 of the army chief of staff, Lt.
 Colonel Kouandete.
 Meanwhile, the incoming gov-
 ernment has already been threatened
 with a general strike by workers
 and students demanding immediate
 and drastic tax reductions.   Their
 challenge could lead to the early
 crumbling of the fragile new
 structure                                   25X1

 NEW TENSIONS IN
 New tensions have arisen be-
 tween the US and the military regime
 in Somalia, and relations seem
 likely to worsen.   In late April
 the Supreme Revolutionary Council
 (SRC) rounded up a collection of
 civilians and military personnel
 and charged them with plotting
 against the government.   General
 Korshel,  a vice president of the
 SRC and a former police commander,
 was accused of masterminding the
 plot.   Following Korshel's arrest
 and a propaganda campaign that
 stressed the involvement of an "im-
 perialist" power,  five members of
 the US Embassy in Mogadiscio were
 expelled for alleged involvement
 in the conspiracy.
 The expulsion of the Americans
 suggests that some government offi-
 cials may have been aiming more at
 creating new irritants between the
 US and Somalia than at countering
 local coup plotting.   No informa-
 tion has yet emerged to shed any
 light on the plot itself or on the
 few Somalis thus far identified.
 Reports have long confirmed the
 existence of disaffection and pe-
 riodic plotting, but it is unclear
 if those arrested were part of a
 conspiracy or were merely known dis-
 sidents who were jailed to put them
 out of circulation.
 Even less clear is General
 Korshel's part in the plot.   Despite
 the regime's contention, Korshel
 seems ill suited to the role of
 ringleader.   He had few assets to
 contribute to a serious plot, having
 little influence outside the coun-
 cil or with his colleagues.   He was
 a reluctant participant in the army
 Page 2 6
 US-SOMALI RELATIONS
 take-over last October and joined only
 after being threatened with arrest.
 Since then, his position has been
 shaky at best,  and he apparently
 was retained on the SRC partly by
 virtue of his senior rank and partly
 to give the appearance of army and
 police cooperation.
 On the other hand, during his
 long tenure as a top police official
 before the coup, Korshel was closely
 involved with the US police train-
 ing and assistance program.   Although
 Korshel may have been in contact with
 some dissidents,  it also seems prob-
 able that linking him with the plot
 may have been prompted by some SRC
 members as a convenient way of dump-
 ing him from the council and impli-
 cating the US.   At least one source--
 an article datelined Mogadiscio that
 appeared in an Italian Communist
 publication--hinted at such a pos-
 sibility by stating that US repre-
 sentatives are involved in police
 training and alleging that the plot
 was organized by police.
 Sentiment favoring a break with
 the US is known to exist among some
 of the young nationalist officers on
 the SRC.   Although it is not clear
 who is behind the current anti-US
 campaign, US-Somali relations have
 drifted steadily downhill since the
 army seized power in October 1969.
 The army has long been hostile to
 the US for its role as an arms sup-
 plier to Ethiopia and as a close
 supporter of ousted prime minister
 Egal.   Somali suspicion of the US
 has already led to the expulsion of
 the Peace Corps in December 1969,
 and this latest incident may nudge
 both countries closer to a break.

 The May Day holiday passed peacefully in most of Latin America, and reaction
 to President Nixon's speech on Cambodia has been limited. Communists in Vene-
 zuela attempted to organize anti-US demonstrations, but there was little trouble.
 Fidel Castro's statement on 22 April that Cuba will always be ready to have
 closer military ties with the USSR and Raul Castro's prolonged visit to the USSR,
 where fie received an unusually warm reception, underline the continuing improve-
 ment in Soviet-Cuban relations. In addition, Soviet naval vessels that took part in a
 recent exercise in the Atlantic may visit Havana over the weekend and then engage
 in maneuvers in the Caribbean.
 Delegations from nine countries that claim maritime jurisdictions to a 200-mile
 limit are scheduled to finish a week of deliberations in Montevideo today. Among
 the subjects discussed were denuclearization of the seabeds and a Latin American
 position on the US-USSR proposals for a Law of the Sea convention. The results of
 the discussions are likely to be incorporated in a "Declaration of Montevideo," to be
 issued at the close of the conference.
 In the Dominican Republic, President Balaguer still appears to be a strong
 favorite to win re-election in the contest on 16 May. Election-related violence and
 last-minute threats by some of the opposition parties to withdraw have dominated
 the headlines, but opposition efforts do not appear to have eroded Balaguer's
 strength seriously. The major opposition party, led by Juan Bosch, is still abstaining
 and refusing to support any candidate. Even Bosch has publicly admitted that his
 party cannot halt the President's re-election effort. Bosch is likely to continue to cry
 "fraud" and claim that the election is a farce, a theme other opposition parties can
 be expected to pick up.
 The mutiny by the Haitian Coast Guard last month continues to spark arrests
 and ousters of middle-level civilian and military personnel, but there has been no
 widespread purge or bloodbath, as many expected. The government, in fact, has
 shown some concern for its public image and has officially denied that any
 executions have taken place. A further shake-up may still occur, but President
 Duvalier seems satisfied that he can count on the loyalty of the majority of the
 armed forces.
 Colombia remains calm, and the curfew restrictions have been further modified
 in Bogota and removed entirely in other areas. Preliminary returns in the congres-
 sional contests suggest that National Front candidate Pastrana will lack a majority
 and will have to form a coalition if lie is to govern effectively. The final recount of
 the presidential vote may take as long as another month.
 Presidential inauguration ceremonies will be held today in Costa Rica for Jose
 Figueres, who previously held office from 1953 to 1958. Many foreign delegations
 are expected to attend, and the possibility of embarrassing demonstrations cannot
 be ruled out.

 BRAZIL SECURITY FORCES HIT TERRORISTS
 Military forces and security
 units have dealt severe blows to
 terrorists in southern Brazil.   The
 principal target was the Popular
 Revolutionary Vanguard (VPR), which
 has been responsible for many major
 terrorist operations during the
 past two years.
 The security forces'  current
 campaign was largely made possible
 by leads obtained from suspects in
 the attempted kidnaping of US Con-
 sul Curtis Cutter in Porto Alegre
 on 4 April. The abduction was planned
 by the VPR and coordinated with other
 terrorist groups. When this attempt
 failed, they selected other targets,
 including the West German ambassador,
 another US consul, and several Bra-
 zilian military officers and govern-
 ment officials. These plans were
 frustrated by the arrests of sev-
 eral important terrorists in Porto
 Alegre, Rio de Janeiro,  and Sao
 Paulo.   Two of the four members of
 the national command of the VPR were
 captured, another committed suicide,
 and only the organization's leader,
 renegade army Captain Carlos Lamarca,
 remains at large.   In addition to
 many bank robberies and thefts of
 arms, the VPR was responsible for
 the assassination of a US Army Cap-
 tain in Sao Paulo in October 1968
 and the kidnaping of the Japanese
 consul general in that city last
 March.
 25X1
 t e government 25X1
 has mounted a joint operation of
 army, air force, and state police
 units to locate training bases of
 the organization in a remote area
 of southeastern Sao Paulo State
 close to the border with Parana.
 Near the town of Jacupiranga, mili-
 tary forces  found two sites that
 the VPR intended to use for guer-
 rilla training.   The troops also en-
 countered a band of VPR militants,
 and among those captured was Darcy
 Rodrigues,  a former army sergeant
 who deserted with Lamarca and was
 one of his chief lieutenants.

 RENEWED VIOLENCE LIKELY IN GUATEMALA
 Guatemalan President Mendez
 has allowed the state of siege,
 imposed following the assassina-
 tion of German Ambassador von
 Spreti, to lapse despite an in-
 crease in terrorist violence.
 Mendez'  action suggests that his
 government will not undertake
 large-scale counterterrorist ac-
 tions in the remaining weeks of
 his administration.
 The FAR has decided to con-
 tinue its terrorist activities
 both in Guatemala City and in
 rural areas.   On 29 April,  left-
 ist terrorists in Guatemala City
 Page 30
 SI CRET
 tried to kill one of Arana's body-
 guards; a policeman was killed in
 the attempt.
 President Mendez has been
 reluctant to deal strongly with
 the leftist threat because of his
 desire to conclude his term of
 office on 1 July peacefully.   He
 also apparently wants to place
 the burden of solving the ter-
 rorist problem on the incoming
 Arana administration.   His atti-
 tude probably will give the right-
 ist counterterrorists even more
 reason to act.
 The activities of this clan-
 destine unit may result in the
 loss of many innocent lives and
 add to the increasingly tense
 situation.   During the last pe-
 riod when such a unit was active,
 mutual retaliation was the rule
 rather than the exception.

 TRINIDAD FACES A NEW POLITICAL CLIMATE
 Confidence in the government
 has been severely shaken by the
 recent disorders, and cabinet
 changes will probably soon take
 place.   The government also ap-
 pears likely to present new legis-
 lation in an attempt to dramatize
 its awareness of the need for
 social and economic change.
 The arrest last weekend of
 the ringleaders of the army mu-
 tiny, which erupted on 21 April,
 finally ended the drawn-out re-
 volt.   The rebellion, coming on
 the heels of weeks of unrest fo-
 mented by black power dissidents,
 had threatened to topple the ad-
 ministration of Prime Minister
 Williams.   Since the arrests,
 government spokesmen have re-
 fused to divulge any of the de-
 tails surrounding the mutiny,
 but it appeared to stem primarily
 from complaints about internal
 conditions in the regiment.
 Some of the officers, who are
 scheduled to stand trial for
 treason later this month, may
 also have been sympathetic to
 the black power cause.
 of his chief ministers,  a young
 cabinet official regarded as a
 spokesman for the black nation-
 alist wing of the PNM, has also
 tarnished the party's image.
 Williams has tried to re-
 coup some of his lost political
 ground by promising a "drastic
 reconstruction of government" and
 vowing "to support unequivocally"
 the claims of blacks to social
 justice and economic dignity.  De-
 spite the rhetoric, Williams'                                                                              new
 programs are thus far vague.  Ear-
 lier in the year, he tried to
 counter the demands of black
 power advocates by prescribing
 an additional 5 percent tax on
 corporations and individuals in
 high tax brackets and by imme-
 diately creating 1,600 new jobs.
 Even these specific efforts had
 little impact,  in part because un-
 employment, estimated at 15 per-
 cent of the work force, appears
 to affect mainly secondary school
 dropouts who are unwilling to ac-
 cept the common laboring jobs of-
 fered.
 Prime Minister Williams, who
 has held power since 1956, has
 probably now incurred political
 liabilities that could shake his
 party's long-time dominance.
 Williams' personal political
 stock,  upon which the Peoples'
 National Movement  (PNM)  has been
 highly dependent, has undoubtedly
 dropped as a result of his inabil-
 ity to head off the black power
 movement or to take early deci-
 sive action against the muti-
 neers.   The resignation of one
 Williams will probably call
 elections late this year or early
 in 1971; the current parliamentary
 term expires next year.   The prime
 ministers'  difficulties may be
 complicated by a political opposi-
 tion that recently has shown new
 signs of life.   Although his foes
 are still splintered, Williams
 will have to present some practi-
 cal programs in coming months if 25X1
 he is to stave off a serious ero-
 sion of his party's strength.

 EL SALVADOR ADOPTS A TOUGH LINE
 The Salvadoran Government ap-
 pears to be adopting a new and
 tougher approach to domestic and
 foreign politics.   In an obvious
 effort to set the political tone
 for the last two years of the San-
 chez administration,  the government
 is taking steps to restrict politi-
 cal opposition.   El Salvador con-
 tinues to take a tough stance
 against Honduras,  as well.
 Although the government was
 careful to avoid incidents before
 the congressional and municipal
 elections on 8 March,  it made clear
 that its patience with student dis-
 sent was wearing thin.   Concerned
 that terrorist successes in neigh-
 boring Guatemala might inspire Sal-
 vadoran student or extremist groups
 to resort to violence,  the govern-
 ment served notice after the elec-
 tion that it would deal harshly with
 any further public disorders.
 Despite its landslide victory
 in the elections,  the government has
 not made any conciliatory gestures
 to the opposition parties.   Ignoring
 Christian Democratic charges of
 election fraud and voter coercion,
 the administration has treated the
 electorate to a practical demonstra-
 tion of its new get-tough policy.
 Itannulled the mayoral victory of
 a candidate from a minor leftist
 party, which had been used as an
 electoral vehicle by the Communists,
 and later used military reservists
 to break up a peaceful rally of the
 same party.
 Recently,  there have been indi-
 cations that the National Guard com-
 mander and intel-
 ligence chief, Gen-
 eral Medrano,  is
 interested in run-
 ning for the presi-
 dency in 1972 with
 President Sanchez'
 support.   This sug-
 gests that the tough
 line will continue
 and even grow in
 intensity.   Me-
 drano,  a dedicated
 anti-Communist, is
 not above precipi-
 tating leftist violence in order to
 win popular support.
 Medrano has also supported a
 tough policy toward Honduras.   He re-
 portedly is responsible for the cur-
 rent disruption of traffic along
 the Pan American Highway and has been
 uncompromising in his refusal to re-
 move National Guard troops from the
 border areas--a major stumbling block
 in the way of the creation of a de-
 militarized zone.
 The Salvadorans recently became
 aware of reports that Honduras had
 acquired jet fighter aircraft and
 they now fear that a surprise attack
 is planned.   A number of defensive
 measures have already been taken and
 restrictions have been placed on the
 movement of US Military Group person-
 nel.   The restrictions may be aimed
 at masking a repositioning of army
 units

 CUBA AND SUBVERSION: OLD STRATEGY, NEW TACTICS
 Fidel Castro has been involved in subversion and armed struggle in varying degrees
 ever since the Cayo Confites expedition in 1947. Almost every Latin American Republic
 has felt his interference at least once. His involvement has taken many different forms
 ranging from direct personal participation, as in the abortive Cayo Confites adventure
 against dictator Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, to the supplying of tons of arms
 and ammunition, as in Venezuela in 1963. His efforts have consistently met with failure,
 with the single exception of his war against former Cuban president Fulgencio Batista.
 Even then it took two attempts before Batista was ousted. Despite his many setbacks, he
 has adopted revolution as a way of life, and there are no signs that he plans to reject it as
 a basic tenet of his personal philosophy. His tactics might change because of the
 circumstances peculiar to a particular situation, but the fundamental precept seems
 immutable.
 Castro's predilection for armed struggle as the main road to political power has
 brought him into conflict with many of the Moscow-oriented Communist parties of
 Latin America and even with some orthodox Communists in Cuba. His domestic critics
 are too timid and too few to constitute a serious problem; they are handled in typical
 Castro steamroller fashion through public denunciation followed by various forms of
 banishment. The foreign parties, however, have the ear of the Soviet Union, Cuba's most
 important benefactor, and are less easy to silence. Party leaders, many of whom were
 well-established disciples of Marx and Lenin long before Castro began dabbling in
 politics, view the Cuban dictator as a latecomer to the Communist movement and as an
 arrogant, self-appointed oracle of revolutionary doctrine. Castro in turn thinks of them
 as ossified theoreticians corrupted by the soft life and blind to political reality. On
 occasion, Castro has been willing to accommodate Soviet reaction to complaints from
 Latin American party officials by agreeing, as he did in 1963 and 1964, to allow the
 local Communist party leaders to determine the road-peaceful or nonpeaceful-to
 power in their respective countries. Such agreements, however, have been honored only
 for relatively brief periods of time and Castro invariably has returned to cramming his
 guerrilla tactics down their throats.
 When Castro's most carefully conceived guerrilla venture-Che Guevara's operation
 in Bolivia-met disaster in late 1967, party leaders throughout the hemisphere could
 scarcely restrain an audible sigh of relief. In their eyes, Castro's theories of violent
 revolution had at last been proved wrong. A toning-down of propaganda and a hiatus in
 Havana's support of guerrilla warfare operations suggested that Castro had finally
 recognized his folly and was adopting a change of strategy. This hope, however, has
 proved to be false. Evidence of the past two years shows clearly that Castro clings as
 strongly as ever to his theories of armed struggle and violence. His tactics have changed,
 but his strategy remains the same. Moreover, armed struggle and violent revolution seem
 to be such basic elements in Castro's psychological make-up that they will probably

 The capture and execution of Che Guevara
 in October 1967 and the subsequent destruction
 of his guerrilla group in Bolivia caused Fidel Cas-
 tro to pause and reflect at length on his policy of
 exporting revolution. The Bolivian fiasco, which
 was merely another in a long string of fruitless
 and costly Cuban adventures in subversion, was a
 particularly disastrous setback because the nu-
 cleus of the guerrilla group consisted of 16 vet-
 eran Cuban combatants-three of them members
 of the Cuban Communist Party's Central Commit-
 tee-who were hand-picked and led by the man
 whom Castro considered the most experienced
 and daring guerrilla warfare tactician in Latin
 America. The group was theoretically the best
 team that Havana could field.
 The startling lack of success in Bolivia be-
 came apparent to Castro when he finally gained
 access to Guevara's campaign diary in the spring
 of 1968. Castro found out that, far from estab-
 lishing a viable guerrilla front, Guevara's band was
 constantly on the run, was barely able to survive
 the harsh terrain, and was unable to recruit Boliv-
 ians through his highly touted tactic of "armed
 propaganda." The circumstances of the defeat
 indicated to Castro that a rethinking of Cuba's
 strategy was in order.

 In addition, a hard look was taken at the
 Interior Ministry (MININT), which is charged
 with carrying out foreign intelligence operations
 such as the Bolivian affair. A reorganization of
 MININT was initiated in mid or late 1968 at the
 same time a similar process was set in motion in
 the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
 (MINFAR), another government branch deeply
 involved in subversion. That this shake-up was
 long overdue became even more apparent when a
 series of defections of key personnel shook
 MININT in 1968 and 1969.
 The revamping of MININT included both
 personnel and structural changes. In July 1968,
 the first vice minister of the armed forces, Major
 Sergio del Valle Jimenez, replaced Major Ramiro
 Valdes Menendez as interior minister. (Valdes,
 who had directed the ministry since 1961, was
 not in disfavor, however; after completing a
 lengthy high-level course of politico-military stud-
 ies, he assumed in January 1970 the position that
 del Valle had previously vacated.) Major Eddy
 Sunol Ricardo, a member of the party's Central
 Committee, who had often been used by Raul
 Castro as a trouble shooter, was named to the
 newly created post of MININT vice minister for
 political work. The first vice minister, Major

 Manuel Pineiro Losada, who also functioned as
 the chief of the foreign intelligence apparatus
 (DGI), retained the DGI under his general com-
 mand but turned over direct responsibility for its
 management to Major Joaquin Mendez Com-
 inches, a former comrade-in-arms of Raul Castro.
 Pineiro's title is now first vice minister and techni-
 cal vice minister. Major Jose Abrantes Fernandez,
 who as chief of the Department of State Security
 (DSE) was charged with counterintelligence and
 security responsibilities, apparently was "kicked

 room for doubt concerning Cuba's continued ad-
 herence to armed struggle and violent revolution.
 At the conference of the Economic Commission
 for Latin America held in Lima in April 1969,
 Rodriguez answered Venezuelan charges that
 Cuba was still supporting guerrillas by saying that
 "Cuba has the conception that for the develop-
 ment of the revolutionary process of most of the
 countries of Latin America, armed struggle is the
 fundamental instrument. We continue to hold to
 that conception." To those delegates who talked
 of resuming relations with Cuba if the Castro
 regime would publicly reject export of the revolu-
 tion, Rodriguez replied: "Cuba is not going to
 change its position to enter into relations with
 any Latin American government."
 Both the reorganization of MININT and the
 reassessment of Cuba's policy of subversion were
 probably completed by late 1969 or early 1970.
 There apparently never was any intention of dis-
 carding armed struggle; the reappraisal seems to
 have addressed only the problem of how and
 when to employ it.
 With Fidel Castro's almost total preoccupa-
 tion with domestic problems, Minister without
 Portfolio Carlos Rafael Rodriguez emerged as a
 key spokesman for the regime on foreign policy
 matters after late 1968. His statements leave no

 In an interview published in a leftist Chilean

 to clarify "Cuba's position with respect to the
 revolutionary struggle in Latin America," which
 he said had "often been the object of inexact
 interpretations...." He said: "Cuba conceives of a
 `continentalization' of strategy. That strategy is
 based fundamentally on the use of armed struggle
 and, in particular, guerrilla warfare in the major
 part of the countries of Latin America, but it
 does not exclude other forms of revolutionary
 violence or even of nonviolent political struggle."
 He characterized as remote and difficult, how-
 ever, the possibility of attaining power without
 violence or previous armed struggle. Regarding

 the situation in Chile, he derided the decision by
 leftist political parties to attempt to achieve
 power through democratic elections and said that
 "Chilean revolutionaries must be prepared for a
 struggle in which violence will be the decisive
 element, even in the case of their obtaining power
 by the nonviolent electoral road."
 More recently, the Cuban press agency
 Prensa Latina reported that, in conversations with
 newsmen at the United Nations in New York in
 March, Rodriguez said that "Cuba supports the
 liberation movements in Latin America...this is
 not only our right but our duty."
 Finally, on 22 April, on the 100th anniver-
 sary of the birth of Lenin, Castro himself
 staunchly reaffirmed in definitive terms his com-
 mitment to support the subversion of other gov-
 ernments by violence: "Cuba has never nor will it
 ever deny support to the revolutionary move-
 ment. This is not to be confused with support of
 any fake just because he is using the name of
 revolutionary... .That type of pseudorevolutionary
 can expect no aid from Cuba, of course. But
 revolutionaries like Che, willing to struggle to the
 final consequences, ,:willing to fight, willing to
 die-they will always be able to count on Cuba's
 help .... But one-must not worry about our posi-

 tion toward the revolutionary movement. So long
 as there is imperialism, so long as there are people
 struggling, willing to fight for their people's lib-
 eration from that imperialism, the Cuban revolu-
 tion will support them."
 It is the Cuban subversive effort in Latin
 American countries that has been the  most
 affected by Castro's policy reassessment. One re-
 sult was the reduction or complete withdrawal of
 support from groups-such as those in Venezuela
 and Colombia-that have demonstrated. incom-
 petence and leadership weaknesses culminating in
 Venezuelan guerrilla chieftain Douglas Bravo lost
 Castro's support.

 a splintering of the local revolutionary movement.
 By early 1969, for example, all Cuban guerrilla
 advisers in Venezuela had been recalled to Havana
 and material support had been reduced so much
 that several guerrilla leaders complained publicly.
 In his speech of 22 April, Castro admitted that
 Cuban support had been withdrawn from groups
 that had constantly performed poorly, but he
 made it quite clear that he would back those that
 produce concrete results.
 Another outcome of the reassessment was a
 fundamental change in revolutionary theory.
 Previously, the Cubans had maintained that the
 guerrilla unit in the rural areas, basing its support
 on the peasants, was the focal point of the revolu-
 tionary movement. Units in urban areas func-
 tioned only in support of the rural guerrillas. In
 revising this concept, Castro seems to have real-
 ized-probably as a result of Guevara's experience
 in Bolivia-that the peasant in the countryside is
 basically a conservative individual with a rela-
 tively low degree of political consciousness and
 therefore a poor prospect for recruitment. Castro
 thus has apparently adopted a more flexible doc-
 trine in which the students and workers of the
 cities-who have a greater political awareness and
 a more liberal bent-initiate the revolutionary
 process by means of urban terrorism, later moving
 to the rural areas to start the second-or guerrilla
 warfare-stage.
 Carlos Fonseca Amador, president of the
 pro-Cuban Sandino Front of National Liberation
 (FSLN) in Nicaragua, described the new theory in
 early 1969 in a critique of previous FSLN opera-
 tions: "Under conditions in Nicaragua-more or
 less the same as Latin American countries gen-
 erally-the center of action of the revolutionary
 war has to be the countryside. However, the role
 that the city should play also has particular im-
 portance, since in the first stage of the struggle
 Special Report
 the city must provide the countryside with the
 most developed cadres in order to direct the or-
 ganization of the political and military, detach-
 ment. Generally, the urban revolutionary cells can
 be developed more easily in the first stage. Such
 elements include the revolutionary sector of the
 workers, the students, and a certain strata of the
 petit  bourgeoisie."  Havana, which described
 Fonseca Amador as "one of Nicaragua's finest
 sons," gave its imprimatur by publishing the cri-
 tique in Tricontinental magazine in late 1969.
 The same theory appeared again in Tricon-
 tinental in April 1970 when Carlos Marighella's

 "Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla" was pub-
 lished. Marighella, the Brazilian terrorist leader
 who was killed in a police ambush in Sao Paulo
 on 4 November last year, originally wrote the
 "minimanual" last June but apparently had for-
 mulated his ideas of the revolution in Brazil two
 years prior when he made his break with the
 Brazilian Communist Party. Although Triconti-
 nental acknowledged that Marighella had written
 his article with the specific case of Brazil in mind,
 it claimed that the "minimanual" has a "special
 importance" and that it "will become one of the
 principal books of every man who, as a conse-
 quence of the inevitable battle against the bour-
 geoisie and imperialism, takes the road of armed
 rebellion."*
 Marighella himself had explained his thesis in
 an interview granted last September to a repre-
 sentative of a French publication. "Under the
 present conditions of dictatorship in this country
 (i.e., Brazil)," he said, "propaganda and educa-
 tional work is possible, a priori, only in the cities.
 A number of mass movements, particularly those
 organized by students, intellectuals, and certain
 groups of militant unionists, have established a
 climate politically favorable for a tougher strug-
 gle, by which I mean armed actions. All the
 antidemocratic measures taken by the govern-
 ment. . .have created a climate of revolt... .The city
 contains all the objective and subjective condi-
 tions necessary for a successful guerrilla war. But
 out in the countryside the situation is markedly
 less favorable. This means that the war in the
 rural districts will have to come after the war in
 the cities, which will play a distinctly tactical
 role. Besides, the comrades who go out to fight in
 the countryside will already have undergone their
 baptism of fire in the urban struggle. The very
 bravest of them will be sent out into the coun-
 try."
 Special Report
 Marighella, Fonseca Amador, and other rev-
 olutionaries are unanimous in support of Castro's
 conviction that the local Communist parties have
 failed to recognize the validity of armed struggle
 and have been reluctant to put it into practice.
 The footdragging and sometimes outright treach-
 ery of the local Communist parties on this point
 have long been a sensitive issue with Castro. He is
 particularly bitter toward the Venezuelan Com-
 munist Party, which he believes sabotaged the
 guerrilla effort in the mid- l960s, and the Bolivian
 Communist Party, which he largely blames for
 Guevara's downfall. Although his last major state-
 ment on the subject was made almost two years
 ago on the occasion of the publication of Gue-
 vara's diary in Havana, there is ample evidence
 that his sentiments have not changed as a result of
 the policy reappraisal. At the Moscow conference
 of Communist parties in June 1969, for example,
 the Cuban observer, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, ac-
 curately reflected Fidel's views when he chal-
 lenged a portion of the proposed conference re-
 solution that stated that "the Communist and
 Workers Parties head the democratic forces and
 maintain on high the banners on the anti-im-
 perialist struggle, fight selflessly and courageously
 for the demands of the masses and for the attain-
 ment of revolutionary changes...." Rodriguez
 acidly charged that "in our opinion, that image
 does not correspond to reality with regard to
 certain Communist parties in Latin America" and
 then chastised parties that "underestimate the
 dangers of imperialism" and "bourgeois reform-
 ism." Although Rodriguez' criticism of the Latin
 American Communist parties was rather mild
 when compared to some of Castro's bitter dia-
 tribes, the forum in which Rodriguez delivered
 the rebuke indicates clearly that the so-called

 Havana is pure fiction. Castro withdrew aid from
 certain guerrilla groups not to placate the local
 Communist party chieftains but because the guer-
 rilla groups were so ineffective for so long that
 Castro lost faith in their ability and desire "to
 make revolution." To use Castro's own words:
 "They had the opportunity to start and conduct a
 revolution; they did indeed have the opportunity
 and they fumbled it." Furthermore, he has flatly
 stated that he plans to continue support for "rev-
 olutionaries like Che," which is just the type of
 activity that earned him the condemnation of the
 parties.
 The new importance given to armed struggle
 in    urban areas as a result of Castro's policy
 reassessment raised questions in the minds of
 many revolutionaries because it seemed to con-
 flict with the theories expounded by Jules Regis
 Debray in Revolution Within the Revolution? In
 this treatise-much publicized by Havana-Debray
 discussed at length basic guerrilla warfare doctrine
 as he understood it after a year of study in Cuba.
 Although Debray wrote the essay, its concepts are
 generally accepted as being those of Castro and
 Guevara. Thus, the high value now placed on
 urban struggle compared to the low value place
 on it in Revolution Within the Revolution? leaves
 Castro vulnerable to charges of inconsistency in a
 matter of life-and-death importance to revolu-
 tionaries who are putting his theories into prac-
 tice. Juan Antonio Blanco, an instructor in the
 Department of Philosophy at Havana University,
 for example, admits, in the October 1969 issue of
 the  Cuban  theoretical journal Pensamiento
 Critico, that "Debray, for reasons very well
 known, is closely tied to our country and our
 ideas about the problems of Latin America. A
 criticism of his essay Revolution Within the Rev-
 olution? is in part, a criticism of our own ideas."
 Special Report
 To  absolve Guevara,  Castro, and even
 Debray himself of any inconsistency, however,
 Blanco explained further: "Despite the fact that
 Debray tries to summarize the basic ideas of Ma-
 jor Guevara and Fidel Castro, this does not pre-
 vent certain personal viewpoints, or a poor or
 simply brief statement of some aspects, from
 causing different interpretations which do not
 always have to coincide with Debray's own
 thought." When it was first published in 1966 in
 Havana, Debray's essay was highly touted by the
 Cubans as an important work "for those who
 know that `the duty of every revolutionary is to
 make the revolution.' " Blanco claimed three
 years later, however, that "Debray was not trying
 to write a manual of guerrilla warfare or a socio-
 logical treatise on the Latin American revolu-
 tion."
 In a further effort to disabuse the revolu-
 tionary faithful of any misconceptions about the
 theories in Debray's book, Havana published in
 Pensamiento Critico in August 1969 a preface
 that Debray had written more than two years
 earlier for the French edition of the book. Debray
 wrote that the purpose of his book was "to seek a
 maximum of revolutionary efficiency," and he
 then warned the reader to avoid "any definitive
 conflict between theory and practice.... Let the
 combatants figure out for themselves the theory
 of their fight..."
 An article in the January 1969 issue of Tri-
 continental also tried to disentangle Debray from
 the results of his writings. The "acritical mechan-
 ical application" of Debray's theses by some
 Latin American revolutionary circles, said the ar-
 ticle, was "something Debray himself did not
 intend to happen." The article then goes on to
 explain why the Tupamaros National Liberation
 Movement in Uruguay is so successful in waging
 armed struggle in spite of the fact that Debray
 claims in his book that in Uruguay "there are no

 immediate prospects for armed struggle." So, in
 the fashion of George Orwell, Debray wrote what
 he didn't mean and his manual on revolution is
 not a manual after all.
 The de-emphasis of Debray's theories means
 that Havana has become more flexible in its ideas
 on how the armed struggle should be applied and
 not that the importance of the basic doctrine has
 dwindled. The de-emphasis happens to come at
 the same time that Havana has decided to with-
 hold support from lackluster guerrilla groups and
 when a series of disasters involving pro-Castro
 revolutionaries has caused the Cubans to slacken
 the flow of support until the situations of various
 leaderless groups clarify. These disasters include:
 the jailing of Nicaraguan FSLN chief Carlos
 Fonseca Amador in Costa Rica last September for
 bank robbery; the killing of Carlos Marighella-a
 most promising guerrilla prospect-by Sao Paulo
 police last November; the death in prison last
 November of the pro-Castro secretary general of
 Panama's Revolutionary Unity Movement, Floyd
 Britton; the death last September of Guido "Inti"
 Perero Leigue, the survivor of the Guevara de-
 bacle who succeeded in regrouping Che's National
 Liberation Army (ELN) in Bolivia; and the killing
 of Gerald Brisson and many other leaders of the
 Cuban-supported Unified Party of Haitian Com-
 munists.
 Although the three Cubans who survived
 Guevara's defeat in 1967 eventually went back to
 Havana, and the Cubans serving with guerrillas in
 Venezuela had returned home by early 1969,25X1
 Havana is apparently still willing to send Cubans
 to Latin America for special operations under
 certain circumstances.
 Evidence of Cuban support in the form of
 arms or money is extremely difficult to produce,
 particularly in view of Havana's exhortation to
 guerrilla groups to demonstrate their independ-
 ence by robbing banks or other businesses and by
 buying or stealing arms locally. Marighella found25X1
 this to be a successful tactic and claimed that he
 had never received arms or financial aid from the
 Cubans.
 Assistance to rebel groups continued even
 during the period of policy reassessment. Several
 of Marighella's followers had been trained in

 considerably since the mid-1960s, Castro has
 sought to maintain contact with Marxist-oriented
 guerrilla organizations targeted against white Afri-

 Assembly on 8 October 1969, Cuban ambassador
 Ricardo Alarcon said: "Cuba reaffirms her com-
 plete support for the struggle of the African
 peoples for their full national independence and
 proclaims her militant solidarity with the libera-
 tion movements of Guinea-Bissau, Angola, and
 Mozambique, and with the oppressed African
 peoples in South Africa, Namibia, and Zim-

 red carpet treatment is extended to any leaders of

 support, PAIGC war communiques are regularly
 forwarded to Havana by the Cuban Embassy in

 The MPLA maintains a permanent repre-

 payroll holdups, raids on gun shops, and attacks
 on small police or military posts have provided
 various guerrilla groups with more than enough
 money and weapons for their operations. Kid-
 napings for ransom have also proved richly re-
 warding for guerrilla groups in Guatemala, Colom-
 bia, and Uruguay. Demanding the release of polit-
 ical prisoners in exchange for kidnaped diplomats
 or other high-level political figures is another pop-
 ular tactic of terrorist organizations.
 Although Castro is undoubtedly aware that
 his own diplomats serving abroad are vulnerable
 to terrorist attacks, he has made no attempt to
 renounce publicly the kidnaping or assassination
 of foreign service officials. In fact, when 13 of the
 15 prisoners released by Brazil in exchange for US
 Ambassador Elbrick chose to travel to Cuba for
 asylum, Castro was on hand at the airport and
 saw to it that they got red carpet treatment upon
 arrival. A warm welcome was also given to four of
 the five prisoners freed in exchange for the Jap-
 anese consul general in Sao Paulo and to 19 of the
 20 Dominicans freed in a trade for an attache of
 the US Embassy when both groups sought refuge
 in Cuba.
 The Cuban press has been outspoken on the
 subject. A radio commentator in Havana, for ex-
 ample, called the kidnaping of Ambassador El-
 brick "the most brilliant action carried out re-
 cently," while Tricontinental of December 1968
 characterized the assassination by pro-Castro re-
 bels of US Ambassador Mein in Guatemala City as
 "punishment well deserved." Similarly, Verde
 Olivo, the Cuban military weekly, reported the
 assassination by the same rebel group of.two US
 military officers in Guatemala in January 1968 as
 being "the only language that the native oligarchs
 and their patrons, the Yankee imperialists, under-
 stand."
 The Cubans until 1969 had always under-
 played the importance of urban terrorism in the
 revolution of 1957-58. The guerrilla war in the
 mountains had always dominated accounts of the
 overthrow of Batista. Last August, however,
 Pensamiento Critico published the text of a talk
 given in closed session to Latin American journal-
 ists in 1967 by Major Faustino Perez, the man
 who directed Castro's urban apparatus during the
 war. Perez' remarks were probably released be-
 cause by 1969 the policy reassessment had indi-
 cated that added importance was to be given to
 urban terrorism in the revised revolutionary
 theory. Perez' historical review closely paralleled
 the theses expounded by Fonseca Amador and
 Marighella. His reason for employing terrorist
 tactics is simple: urban terrorism creates a "situa-
 tion of insecurity in the so-called economic
 classes.. .who are going to feel that their base is
 shaky and are themselves going to be thinking of
 the necessity of change, the necessity that this
 situation cannot continue.... A state of general
 opinion in the people favorable to change will be
 created. In other words, even those who are not
 revolutionaries realize that this cannot continue
 and will assume an attitude favorable to change."
 RAW MATERIALS FOR REVOLUTION
 Perez laid great stress, as did Marighella and
 Fonseca Amador, on the participation of students
 in the revolutionary process. Students have a de-
 veloped political consciousness, a certain lack of
 caution, and have the fitness of youth. The vio-
 lence that students have precipitated throughout
 both North and South America in the past few
 years has apparently impressed Castro with re-
 spect to revolutionary possibilities. In late 1969,
 he initiated plans to resurrect his old student-
 front group, the Continental Organization of
 Latin American Students (OCLAE), which was
 formed in Havana in 1966 to act as a support
 apparatus for the Guevara adventure in Bolivia.
 OCLAE has lain dormant since Guevara's failure,
 but last December its permanent secretariat in-

 only way," so impressed the Cubans that he was
 invited to the Havana Cultural Congress held in
 January 1968. In January 1970, Radio Havana
 characterized as "one of the most significant
 phenomena in Latin America in recent times" the
 "growing participation of some of the progressive
 Catholic clergy in the struggle of the peoples." A
 month later, the Cubans, apparently searching for
 another Camilo Torres, gave considerable press
 Camilo Torres is Castro's
 example of the ideal
 rebel priest.
 The Cubans are also favorably impressed by
 the growing tide of sentiment within the Catholic
 Church for revolutionary social and economic
 changes. Havana's propaganda contains heavy
 doses of material on members of the clergy such

 play to the reported arrival in the ranks of the
 Colombian ELN of Father Domingo Lain, a
 Spanish priest who was expelled from Colombia a
 year ago for interfering in the country's internal
 affairs. Castro has commented favorably on the
 revolutionary clergy several times in his speeches
 and probably looks on cassocked rebels as having
 excellent potential for guerrilla support activities
 such as those carried out by various religious
 orders in Brazil in conjunction with Marighella's
 terrorists.
 THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
 Castro will continue to support subversion
 abroad but is now being much more cautious as
 to whom he should support and what type of
 support is to be supplied. If the situation were
 particularly promising, he would not hesitate to
 send money, arms, or even Cuban advisers, but
 the rewards would have to be commensurate with
 the risks. He seems to have learned that exporting
 Cubans to lead a foreign revolutionary movement
 is counterproductive, and he will probably de-
 pend on foreign nationals who have the charisma
 and aggressiveness of a Carlos Marighella to pro-
 vide the necessary leadership. He will not insist, as
 he did with disastrous results in Bolivia in 1967,
 that he control the revolutionary movement, and
 he will probably be satisfied to confine Cuban
 participation to support and advice. He is showing
 signs of being parsimonious with financial and
 material assistance, urging revolutionaries to sus-
 tain themselves by means of holdups, bank rob-
 beries, and similar actions that have become so
 prevalent in Latin America in the past year.
 He will exert special care in situations like
 that in Peru where military officers seem to be
 making a genuine effort to institute fundamental
 economic and social changes by means of na-
 tionalization and agrarian reform. In such cases,
 he will soft-pedal violent revolution to avoid up-
 setting the applecart. He considers the case of
 Bolivia a special one, however, and will oppose
 the Ovando government no matter what changes
 are instituted. Castro blames Ovando for the exe-
 cution of Guevara and seems to be intent on
 exacting revenge. Honorato Rojas, the Bolivian
 who led Guevara's rear guard into a fatal ambush
 in August 1967, has already been liquidated by
 the ELN, and the same fate has apparently been
 decreed for Mario Monje, the now-imprisoned
 Bolivian Communist Party official who refused to
 aid Guevara, and for Ovando himself.
 The bulk of Castro's support for revolution-
 aries will probably consist of propaganda and the
 training of recruits in guerrilla warfare and special
 operations techniques. Candidates for training
 will probably be screened much more closely than
 in the past, and this policy may result in a drop in
 quantity but an improvement in quality.
 Castro will establish and maintain liaison
 with, and support, those groups that are willing to
 engage in armed struggle for the overthrow of
 their native governments but will be less dogmatic
 when it comes to the fine points of revolutionary
 theory. He now recognizes that each country has
 its peculiarities and that the Cuban experience
 cannot be repeated in other countries unless his
 general theories on revolution undergo consider-
 able revision. He will continue to scorn most of
 the established Communist parties in Latin Amer-
 ica and will seek out those revolutionary leaders
 who are willing to apply in their respective coun-
 tries the general guidelines of urban terrorism (to
 create the proper revolutionary climate), guerrilla
 warfare (to provide a combat nucleus for con-
 fronting the forces of repression), and the
 people's army (to overthrow the government,
 seize power, and continue the revolution's eco-25X1
 nomic and social phases). Castro is a compulsive
 rebel and will probably remain committed to vio-
 lent revolution.
