 CCP~S TENlI-1 CONGRESS SANCTIONS PARTY RESTORATION ERA
 1'he CCI''s tenth congress held from 24 to 28 August, a milestone
 marking a party restoration era, formalized Lin Piao's downfall
 and certified a power structure in which Chou En-lai's part}?-
 oriente6 coalition occupies the commanding heights beneath only
 Mao Himself.  'I'lie congress also provided dramatic testimony to
 the intense animosity that a Chinese leadership headed by Mao
 and Chou harbors toward the Soviets.  In addition to a denunciation
 of Lin's "antiparty clique"--for waning to capitulate to the
 Soviets, among other charges--the political report Chou delivered
 to the congress featured a bitter excoriation of the "Brezhnev
 reciegacie clique" and even warned explicitly against a Soviet
 surprise attack.
 On the surface the leadership certified by the congress might
 appear to be a balance of contending forces, moderate and radical,
 civLlian and military.  But ir. fact the new constellation possesses
 a strong center of gravity, a convergence of vested interests
 in the patty as an institution that has been regaj:cing the hegemony
 destroyed during the cultural revolutio~.t and challenged in the
 Lin Piao affair.  The meteoric rise of young Shanghai leader
 Wang ;lung-wen, wlio del.{vexed the report on the revised party
 constLtution, symbolizes these vested interests in the party.
 Wang's Shanghai Cotton Mill I~(o, 17 formed the first party
 cununittee (20 June 1969) to be rebuilt after the ninth congress
 in April that year put party reconstruction on the agenda.  The
 parry leas also waxed quantitatively, the congress revealing a
 member.stiip figure of 28 million as comp,~red with the official
 Figure of 17 million before the de.:imations of the cultural
 revolut.iun.
 '1'lte  teeth congress was  unusual '~oth for its  brevity  and  the absence
 of a prior announcement or preceding plenum.  Mao's health--he
 presided at the congress but did clot speak, as he had at the ninth
 congress--and Psking's trend toward streamlining affairs may
 Dave been contributing factors, but the brevity of the proceedings
 may also reflect how those in charge viewed the business at
 hand.  Borh Clcou and Wang in their reports were at pains to
 indicate an underlying continuity between the ninth congress
 and tl~e present.  Thus the tenth congress has formally rectified
 rile deviation of Lin and his associates from the course 4lready
 charted at the ninth congress, and there was nu need to elaborate

 on policy lines.  'lice next step will be the convocation of- the
 .'National People's C~.~ngress, an event that was delayed by the
 Lin Plao affair but which Chou has now promised will come "soon."
 LEADERSHIP       The composition of the new Politburo and Central
 Committee confirms Chou's ascendancy in the wake of
 the Lin affa r and litghlights Wang flung-wen's rise to the formal
 position of third-ranking member of a collective leadership under
 P1ao.  It also registers the enhanced authority of aparty-centered
 coalition at the expense of professional military leaders and
 the two militant "radicals" whose interests were closely identified
 with the cultural arena during tl-e cultural revolution.
 Tlie first  plenucu of  the Tenth Central Committee,  field on 30
 August, revived the collective ln~titution of party vice chairmen,
 naming in apparent rank order Chou, Wang, ailing incumbent
 standing committee member Kang Sheng (folio may have been rswarded
 for loyalty during the Lin affair), party-military leader and
 close Chou asr~ociate Yeh Chien-yang, and Li Te-sheng, dead of the
 PLA General Political Department (GPD) wl:o has been elevated from
 Politburo alternate.  Whether or not the rank order implies the
 line of succession i.s not indicated in the new Party constitution,
 in contrast to the previous constitution's imprudent designation
 of Lin as sole vice chairman and successor to Mao.  With respect
 to party supremacy over the military, it is significant not only
 that the two mili.tar.y men among the vice chairmen are ranked
 behind the others but also that they represent party interests in
 the mili.t.ary:  Yeh as the key figure in the party's Military
 Committee,  and  Lt as GPI) chief .
 '1'iie new standing  committee  includes,  in add~tiott  to Mao and alt
 party vice chairmen, Shangha.t chief Chang Chun-chiao and
 octogenarians Chu 'I'e and Tung Pi-wu, the later two having mainly
 honorary status.  At this stage Chang's status seems perplexing,
 but he may be destined tc stand in the front rank of leader, as
 Party secretary general or, after the NPC, as chief of state or
 some other top title.  'Though there has been no reference to
 revival or a secretariat, Cliang served as secretary general of
 the congress.  The secretary general of the eighth congress in
 1956, 'l:eng Hsiao-ping, became party secretary general but not a
 vice chairman, a possible precedent for now.  Should Chang not
 be awarde4 one of the top positions in the formal hierarch- but
 instead be upstaged by his former Shanghai protege, the stability
 of thF~ new leadership might be questionable with the addition of
 another significant source of dissatisfaction over. the current
 lineup.

 While al.l the Politburo members not purged with Lin have retained
 their posts and all active alternates have been promoted t~ full
 membership, some of the incumbents, notably Chiang Ching and
 Yao Wen-yuan, must surely he dissatisfied with their current
 status.  They directed the cultural and ideological attacks that
 keynoted the cultural revolution, and Chiang in particular has
 lost ground by failir_g to make the standing committee after having
 previously ranked dust below standing committee members.  The
 new list elevates additional leaders above her and Yap.  Similarly,
 the two regional military leaders in the Politburo, Hsu Shih-yu
 and Cheng lisi-lien,  have  suffered a relative  1o~s  i.n c~iew of
 the newly elevated leaders above them and the addition of other,
 nonmilitary provtncial leaders to full Politburo status.  No
 new regional. military leaders were elected to the Politburo.
 Some of the promotions to the Politburo had been previously
 Gignaled in central leadership rankings:  Wang Hung-wen, Hunan
 chief Huau Kuo-feng, and Pelting municipal chief Wu Te had been
 accorded positions in central leadership lists which implied
 future Politburo status.  All are civilians, as are the other
 two new full members of the Politburo, Kwangsi chief Wei Kuo-ching
 anti leader of the model Tachai production brigade Chen Yung-kuei.
 Politburo :alternate members seem to have been selected with a view
 to rounding out representation from various groups:  Wu Kuei-hsien
 From Shensi is a woman wlia was a full member of the ninth committee;
 Ni Ciiih-fu is a model worker; Su Chen-hua, former navy political
 commissar whose successor Li Tso-peng fell with Lin, seems to
 represent the rehabilitated cadres and is the only one to achieve
 Politburo status; and Saifudin, like Wei Kuo-ching, ~?.s a
 member of a national m3.nority.  Unlike the other a~ternate
 members, Saifudin has a power base in his own right as Sinkiang
 party chief.
 CEV"fRAL COf~M1ITTEE         Thouf;h  the total number of  Central Commitr_ee
 full and alterna*.e members rose from 294
 to 319, nearly a third of. the Ninth Central Consnittee members was
 dropped from the new committee, mostl;~ military leaders who fell
 after i,in's demise or "revolutionary" leaders from the provinces.
 On the other. hand, the new Centra? Committee includes some 20
 members of the Eighth Central Committee who were not retained at
 Ninth Congress in 1969.  Two ~f the most prominent returnees,
 former Politburo members Tan Che-i-lin ar:d Ulanfu, made public

 Heilungkiang, who was out of public view for nearly two years
 before reappearing in his province in Jt+.ne, and Shansi first

 by Tachai leader Chen Yung-kuei, now a full. member of the Politburo.
 NE;J CONSTITUTION,     Chou En?-].ai's political. report and Wang
 POLITICAL REPORT       Hung-we:i's report on the new party constitution
 represe~lt determined efforts to link present
 policies with the line adopted at the ninth congress, presenting
 the Lin Piao's group ais a. defeated minority even at the ninth
 congress.  Both Chou and. Wang reaffi?~ned that "the political llr.e
 and organizational line of the ninth congress are correct," and
 Chou pointed out that thr: political report delivered by Lin at
 that congress was "drawl up under Chai.rma.z Mao's personal guidance."
 The thrust of both Chou's and Wang`s reports was thus tt-at business
 will be =ari~erl on largely as it has been fc~r the past tour years
 and that cadres need not expect line changes or detailed new
 programs.
 As Wang noted in his report on the party c~r~stitution, "there
 are not many changes in the articles" and these changes were
 drawn up according to "Chairman Mao's specific proposals."
 Wang's report is closely tied to an explication of the constitution,
 but both he :end Chou stress Lhe same major points--the supremacy
 of the party, t11P_ inevitability of future revolutions like the
 cultural revolution, and the difficult. role of the cadre who must
 be willing to sacrifice everything in opposing erroneous trends.
 Wang delved deeper into the rights of the masses to supe:.~~~;;e the
 party than did Chou, but he did so in explaining the addition
 to the constir..ution of the warning that "it is absolutely
 impermissible to :suppress criticism and to retaliate."

 6 SEPTEMBER 1973
 The two major changes in the constitution are the omission of
 the provision naming Lin as Mao's successor and a revised tr.eatmen.t
 of Mao's thought, an instrument that had been used by Lin and
 cultural revolution forces in the assault on the party.  The
 new constitution omits the claims that Mao's thought is Marxism-
 Leninism of the present era and that he his brought Marxism-
 Leninism to "a higher and completely new stage."  Tn the political
 report Cliou in effect explained this deflation of the Maoist
 universalism that had had suct-. a disastrous effect on Peking's
 foreign relations during the cultural revolution.  After fixst
 citing Mao himself as affirming that this is still the era of
 imperialism, Chou quoted Stalin as saying "Leninism is Marxism
 of the era of imperialism" and then drew the logical conclusion
 that "the era has not changed" and that. "the fundamental principles
 of Leninism are not outdated."  Cl:ou added that these principles
 remain "the theoretical basis guiding our thinking today," but
 elsewhere in the report he paid due deference to Mao's personal
 contributions.  The new constitution posits "Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Tsetung Thought''' as the theoretical basis guiding tnr_ CCP's
 thinking.
 There are no provisions in the constitution for succession to the
 party chairmanship, other than that a Central Committee plenum
 elects the chairman.  There is no mention of a secretariat, as
 there had been in the constitution drawn up by the eighth congresb,
 but "a number of necessary organs...shall be set up to attend to
 the day-to-day c?~rk of the party."  An identical provision appeared
 in the 1969 constitution, but no secretariat emerged after the
 ninth congress.
 Chows claim that the political report given by Lin at the ninth
 congress was a Mao document and not what Lin really preferred
 was a necessary prelude to the denunciation of Lin; most of what
 Lin said in the report is still applicable today.  Chows economic
 attack on Lin and Chen Po-ta, who was also denounced at the
 congress, may relate to actual divergences over resource allocation,
 but it was couched in almost precis~J?~ r:~e same terms used by
 Lin in his attack on Liu Shao-chi for "grasping production" and
 for stating that the question of whether capitalism or socialism
 wins out "is already solved."

 A principal tactic used in Cltou's report is to vilify Lin as
 a Soviet agent, and in the course of doing so the report puts o:~
 public record such details a;~ Lin's alleged attempt to assassinate
 Mao and his death in a plane crash :Cn Mongolia while trying to
 flee to the Soviet Union.  In a notably evasive remark, Chou
 begged off going into detail about the anti-Lin struggle, observing
 that it is already well ki-own and "there is no need to dwell on
 it here."  Such a formula--almost a signal of sensitive and
 contentious issues--has been used on at least two previous
 occasions, by Lo Jui-ching in regard to Lin's strategy of people's
 war in Sr.rtember 1965, and in the 1 July 1971 party anniversary
 editorial in regard to the cultural revolution.
 Chows caution fits with the gingerly way in which the congress
 treated the Lin affair, particularly its implications for faders
 other than those already purged.  Thus Chou observed that the
 Lin clique was "only a tiny group which was extremely isolated."
 The congress communique, while announcing the expulsion from the
 party of Lin and Cheri Po-ta, was unrevealing about the fate of
 "the other principal members" of the Lin clique.  The communique
 merely noted that the congress supported unspecified decisions
 and "all the corresponding measures" taken with regaru to these
 unnamed figures.
 Some of Chou's remarks, like those of Wang on the constitution,
 were less than reassuring to wary cadres, who were warned that
 "unhealthy tendencies" still exist and that "quite a few party
 committees are engrossed in daily routine and minor matters,
 paying no attention to major issues."  If they do not change,
 Chou warned, they will "inevitably step onto the road of
 revisionism."  This admonition, along with Wang's injunction
 against "going in by the back door," may be aimed at the type
 of error that has recently 'o~:en aired concerning educational
 policy.  The emphasis at the congress on individual cadre's
 responsibility for standing firm against an erroneous tide may
 be designed to extol those like the rusticated youth in Liaoning
 who insisted. on a matter of principle in questioning how tYie
 new college admissions policy was being implemented.  His case
 served as a national example during the precongress deliberations
 in Ju?.y and August.

 chairmen by p.l.aying an active role in ending factionalism among
 Shanghai student rebels in 1967 and then hitching his star to
 early efforts to rebuild the party.  As head of the Shanghai
 Workers' Revolutionary General Headquarters, a workers group
 organized to quell factional strife among feuding groups, Wang
 played a major role in seeing that central directives calling
 for an end to violent struggle were carried out in his home
 base,
 The Shanghai radio in August 1967, for example, ,raised Wang's
 group for urging "misled" revolutionaries in a local shipyard to
 forget their factional disputes and to adhere to Mao's correct
 line.  Leading members of Wang's organization blasted two rival
 groups for "hoodwinking young people" and seeking "to stir
 up a second chaos in the yard."  Similarly, in a rally speech
 that same month, Wang himself hit out at "bad elements" for
 taking "to rumormongering and inciting" as a means to take
 advantage of the masses.  Wang charged these groups with
 carrying out perverted forms of armed struggle
 and attack against organizations and individuals
 holding opinions which differ from theirs, causing
 armed struggles...and embroiling themselves in
 violence.  'Chis is incorrect and in contradiction
 to the present general orientation of the struggle.
 It is damaging to the effort to unite the majority
 and isolate and attack the few.
 Wang won a spot on the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee
 in 1967 and was later elected a member of the new Central Committee
 at tl-e ninth party congress, where he delivered a speech.  In
 June 1969, just two months after the party congress ended, Wang's
 cotton mill became the first to establish a party committee at the
 primary level in Shanghai.  Editorials in the Shanghai press
 praised the new committee for providing an inspiration to all
 other units in Shanghai.
 In recent years, Wang has moved rapidly *_o the top rungs of
 Shanghai's power elite.  He was ideni:ified as a vice chairman
 of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee in 1970 and emerged as
 a secretary on Shanghai's new party committee in 1971.  Since
 the turn of the year, Wang has functioned as Shanghai's chief
 when the Politburo duties of Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan
 kept them in Peking.  Under Wang's guidance, Shanghai became the
 first province-level unit to establish a new Communist Youth
 League (CYL) committee last February.  The Shanghai model set

 the pattern for rebuilding the CYL into a tightly disciplined
 organization to funnel youthful energies toward gals set by the
 central party apparatus.  Wang's keynote address at the Shanghai
 CYL congress firmly called upon party organizations at all levels
 to stren3then their leadership over youth work.  In April of this
 year Wa~~g appeared in Shanghai, after one of his stays among the
 upper reaches in Peking, as head of the reconFtructed Shanghai
 Trade Union Council.
 CNOU PORTRAYS GEOPOLITICAL SETTING OF TRIANGULAR RELATIONS
 If the discussion of domestic affairs stressed continuities
 between the ninth and tenth congresses, the treatment of foreign
 affairs reflected the transformed triangular relationship and
 Peking's trend in recent ~~ears toward geopolitical and diplomatic
 approaches to foreign policy.  Chows report to the congress
 pressed the familiar line of forming "the broadest united front"
 against the "hegemonism of the two :;uperpowers," but it did so
 in a way that clearly sanctioned the moves toward Sicio-U.S.
 detente in the interest of counterbalancing Soviet influence.
 Chows report also served as an authoritative rebuttal of the
 recent Soviet polemical offensive against Peking.  Observing
 that "the Brezhnev renegade clique" has recently "talked a lot
 of nonsense" about Sino-Soviet relations, Chou retorted that
 Moscow has been playing up to monopoly capitalists by accusing
 Peking of apposing detente and refusing to improve Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 Chou notably sharpened the formula of great-power rivalry that
 has served as the major premise of Peking's forei;n policy in
 recent yaar:~.  While noting that the superpowers "contend as well
 as collude" with each other, Chou advanced a clear-cut formulation
 of where the balance lies:  "Their collusion serves the purpose
 of more intensified contention.  Contention is absolute and
 protracted, whereas collusion is relati~le and tem?~orary."  In
 the late 1960s, at a time when Sino-U.S. relations were frozen
 in hostility, Peking had stressed the convergence of interests
 between the Soviet Union and the United States, even to the
 point of accusing them of forming a military alliance against
 China.
 In the context of analyzing superpower cont.~ntion, Chou cited
 Europe as "strategically?the key point" in their rivalry.
 According to Chou's analysis, the West always seeks to divert
 the Soviet "peril" toward China, and the Soviets frr their part

 are now feinting to the east while thrusting coward the west.
 The 1 October 1972 PRC National Day editorial had said Moscoc?~
 regarded Europe as the main area of its contention with the
 United States, a:.d in the past year the Chinese have issued a
 stream of reports contrived to question Moscow's detente posture
 in Europe and to promote Western vigilance and concern.
 Consistent with the emphasis on geopolitical considerations,
 Chou all but ignored revoiutianary movements and armed struggles.
 In contrast, Lin Piao's ninth congress report gave pride of place
 to this subject in i.ts discussion of foreign affairs.  Typifying
 Peking's current approach, Chou's report hailed the awakening, of
 the 'Third World as "a major event in contemporary international
 relations," and Chinese efforts to cultivate West Europe and
 Japan were reflected in Chou's reference to resentment in these
 areas toward superpower dominance.
 SING-SOVIET RELATIONS       Chou's report pulled few punches in its
 attack on the Soviets, likening Brezhnev
 to Hitler and all but writing off any hope for an improvement in
 Sino-Soviet relations.  Chou recited a familiar litany of charges,
 accusing the Kremlin of enforcing a fascist dictatorship at home
 and practicing "social imperialism" across the globe.  He reiterated
 Peking's position that the dispute over "matters of principte"
 should not hinder normalization of state relations on the basis
 of peaceful coexistence, and that the border question should be
 settled peacefully through negotiations "free from any threat"--a
 formulation reflecting Peking's demand for a mutual troop withdrawal.
 But that he made these points merely for the record seemed indicated
 bq his sarcastic rhetorical question:  "I?fust China give away
 all the territory north of the Great Wall to the Soviet revisionists"
 in order to demonstrate a willingness to improve Sino-Soviet
 relation?
 Chou made a passing ref erence to Soviet troops massed along the
 Chinese border, but the most direct portrayal of a threat to
 China's security came in the course of an appeal for vigilance
 against "any war of aggression that imperialism may launch and
 particularly againsc surprise attack on our country by Soviet
 revisionist social imperialism."*  The warning against surprise
 *  Wang's report on the constitution referred to surpris~ attack
 by "imperialism and social imperialism," but this was presumably
 a function of format rather than a reflectior. of divergent lines.
 Wang's brief discussion of foreign affairs  encapsulated the
 references  to  both "any war' of  aggression"  and surprise attack.

 attack, which is r.ew, also appeared in the congress communique.
 'Taken as a whole, however, the congress' discussion of foreign
 affairs did not evoke a sense of imminent threat, and Chou's
 report put a gloss un Mao's 20 May 1970 dictum on the danger of
 n new world war by asserting that it is possible "to prevent
 such a war."
 SINO~'J.S. RELATIONS      Chou's report contained a directly positive
 assessment of the Sino-U.S. detente,  In
 the coarse of listing Peking's, successes in foreign affairs, Chou
 observed that "Sino-U.S. relations have bEen improved to some
 extent."  The National Day editorial last October had said that
 rresiden? Nlxon's visit to Peking had e.~ded two decades of
 suspended relations and had opened the ~'~ur to friendly c~^.ta~ts
 between tite peopl? of the two countries.  The upturn j^. these
 relations  carp be measured against Lin's nir_t : congress report,
 which had called the United States "the most ferocirus enemy"
 of ttie world's reople and had criticized the President for
 playing "counterrevolutionary dual tactics."
 In a notable passage, Chou's report justified Peking's moves to
 improve Sino-U.S. relations while denigrating Soviet-U.S. detente.
 Distinguishing "necessary compromises between revolutionary
 ruuntries and imperialist countries" from "collusion and compromise"
 between Moscow and Washington, Chou cited Leninist scripture
 for the observation that "there are compromises and compromises."
 Ctiou Hammered his point home by invoking Lenin's conclusion of
 the Brest-Litovsk Treaty and r,ntrasting it with "thp doings of
 Khrushchev and B~ezhnev" as "betrayers of Lenin."
 In another justification for Sino-U.S, ??etente, ('hou said the
 United States has "openly admitted that it is increasingly on
 the decline" and that it "could not but pull out of Vietnam."
 This portrayal of receding U.S. power contrasted with Chou's
 catalog of the "evil anu foul things" perpetrated by an
 expansionist Soviet Union.
 Chows report failed to repeat. the recent call for "peaceful
 unification" of the motherland, but Peking's conciliatory approach
 during the past year was reflected in Chou's appeal to compatriots
 o,~t the mainland and in Taiwan to "strive together" to liberate
 Taiwan and unify the country.

 i-WNOI MARKS NATIONAL nAY: DEFENSE MINISTER GIAP STILL ABSENT
 North Vietnam ceJ.ebrated the 2 September DRV National Day with
 tradltl.onal observances the preceding day:  Hanoi leaders
 ~ittended a wreath-laying ceremony at a military cemetery, a grand
 rally was held  at  13a  Dinh  Square,  and Prem~~er  Pliam Van Dong hosted
 an evening reception.  The appearance of most Vietnam Workers Party
 (V47P) Politburo members at these events, or at the 31 August
 ceremony welcoming First Secretary Le Duan back from the USSR,
 called attention to the continued unexplained absence of Defense
 Plini.ster Vo Nguyen Giap, who has not appeared in public since
 early July.  lloang Van Hoan, the only other active Politburo member
 who was not present on these occasions, is currently in Peking on
 an undisclosed assignment.  NFLSV Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, who was
 in Hanoi on leis way to the nonalined conference in Algiers, also
 participated in the major national day events and spoke at the
 rally.
 Hanoi did not hold its usual commemorative ceremony to mark the
 anniversary of the death of Ho Chi Minh on 3 September 1969,
 an event which previously had also prompted a turnout of the
 Politburo,  The omission of the :.eremony is consistent with thA
 trend of diminished attention to this anniversary:  Last year
 1-Ianoi held the ceremony but did not continuF she previous two
 years' practice of giving major press attention to the anniversary.

 ceremonies, or at Politburo gatherings greeting
 '.he return to Hanoi of Pham Van Dong ~n 17 August and Le Duan on
 31 August, Further underscores the unusual nature of his recent
 absence from public view.  Since 1965, Giap on at leas; three
 occasions made no public appearances over even longer periods,
 but he had not missed a national day ceremony for more than 10 years.
 During his most exte*-ded absence--from mid-November 1967 to
 5 February 1968--he similarly failed to make a traditional appearance
 at  the  time of  the 22.  December llR".  army anni~?ersary.~          During  this
 earlier absence, Giap may well have been visiting somewhere outside
 the DRV:  A Moscow broadcast on c0 November 1967 reported that Giap

 from 5 May to 27 July 1972 and from 23 February to 1 Mriy 1968.

 deiegatl.on back  to  the DRV,  since an  18 Nov~..aber  l,n :oi  report

 Giap's last, definJte public appearance was on 8 Jul; when he
 was listed among those who saw the Le Dua~'I-Pham ~~an llong delegation
 oEf  to  the  Soviet Union.         'lhe  fir. st  tradil'lonal  public  function
 which he missed was the 31. July PRC embasuy receptiol~ marking

 conference convened by the Standing Committee of the Central
 Military  Party Couaui.ttee.         Again  on  19  and  27 July Elanoi  reported
 that "on the occasion of wounded soldiers and fallen heroes' day,"
 which falls on 27 July, Giap llad accompanied President Ton Duc Thang
 on a visit to Army E(ospital 108 in Elanoi to see wounded and sick
 armymen.  'Thu reports of the visit did not say when it occurred.
 Appropriate messages from Giap have continued t~ appear since he
 dropped from view:  On 26 July Elanoi radio broac:cast a message
 signed by Giap tc: Raul Castro on the anniversary of the Cuban
 uprising; and on 6 August VNA transmitted Giap's con~'.olen:es on
 Ulbricht's death.  There has been no occasion for further Giap
 messages since that date; he would next be expected to sign
 messages on the Bulgarian and Hungarian army days, ?3 and 29
 September respectively.

 "great victory" achieved in the anti-U.S.
 resistance war and pledged that the DRV and PRG would str{.ctly
 respect and implement the Paris peace agreement.  He routinely
 accused the United States and Saigon of violating the Paris
 accord; but, in line with EIanoi's current circumsrect comment, his
 complaints against the United States were kept at a :pow key.  He
 decried U.S. "neocolonialism" in the South slid alleged that U.S.
 reconnaissance planes had continued flights over the DRV and that
 Washington was delaying ''concrete realization of its coms.itment"
 to "healing the wounds ~f war and to postwar reconstruction of the
 DRV."  However, he did not specifically raise the question of
 resuming the U.S.-DRV ,joint economic talks in Paris and did not
