 MEMORANDUM FOR:   The Director of Central Intelligence
 FROM              Robert M.  Gates
 Deputy Director for Intelligence
 SUBJECT           China and Downgrading the US Relationship
 The Chinese' replied on 17 July to the final US position on
 arms sales to Taiwan with a counterproposal that accepts our
 language on arms sales.   Their proposal, however, also removes
 the linkage, which we want, between China's policy on peaceful
 reunification and the future of US arms to Taiwan.   The Chinese
 asked to move quickly to line-by-line negotiations;  the Depart-
 ment is now preparing a response to their latest draft for
 White House approval.   If agreement is not reached by the end of
 August, when Congress will be formally notified on extension of
 the F5E coproduction line on Taiwan, that action is virtually
 certain to prompt China to begin downgrading relations.
 This paper is the latest in our series of analyses for NSC
 and State on the consequences of various moves in the negotiations.
 We were not asked to address whether downgrading will occur, but
 to spell out its mechanics, and implications, and international
 reaction to the process.   Essentially we conclude that the Chinese
 would:
 --    publicly curtail the most visible aspects of their
 political and security relationship, beginning with the
 withdrawal of their and perhaps our Ambassador;
 --    preserve their commercial and educational ties with the
 US, hint at but not follow through on economic
 retaliation and cultivate the political opposition in
 the US to change future US policy; and
 --    try to influence Washington by manipulating allied and
 Soviet reaction, which together would regard downgrading
 as a net loss to the US strategic position.

 THE PROCESS AND AFTERMATH OF A DOWNGRADING OF US-PRC RELATIONS
 Key Judgments
 If the US and china               fail  to reach a public understanding on
 the     Taiwan issue  in the next              few weeks,  Beijing will cite new US
 arms sales  to Taipei  as  the cause for downgrading bilateral
 relations.   Fundamentally, however,  China  will  act on  the
 conviction  that     the potential  for cooperation with  the United
 States has significantly eroded since 1979-80,     when Chinese
 China's criticism  of the Administration's policies on  Taiwan
 and in  several  other areas has  grown slowly but  steadily since
 the presidential campaign  in 1980 when  the Chinese became
 concerned about      the possibility of changes  in US policies
 unfavorable  toward Beijing and favorable  toward Taipei.   Beijing
 regards  a settlement of this problem as a litmus of US
 willingness  to  treat China as a sovereign Dower and an  equal
 In downgrading relations,  the Chinese will make  the costs
 clear  to Washington,  play on US allies'  concerns,  and argue  their
 case   in the US,  where  they  will  suggest that new policies under a

 future  leadership would revitalize  the  strategic benefits from
 the relationship.   Beijing will  also attempt  to pressure
 Washington  through the private sector by  threatening    the loss of
 commercial  opportunities  in China.   The Chinese  will  attempt  to
 manage  their  tactics  carefully, but excessive bureaucratic zeal
 or domestic political    rivalries might accelerate  the downgrading
 process, with unexpected and unfavorable   consequences.
 China is unlikely  to change its approach toward  the USSR_
 following a downgrading,   although Beijing may more actively
 allude  than  in  the past  to its range  of options  in dealing with
 Moscow in  an attempt  to influence US attitudes and policies.   The
 Soviets would  welcome downgrading;     they may step up  their efforts
 to portray  their own  flexibility    toward China, while playing on
 the perception    that the US has  lost a strategic asset.   The
 Allies  in Europe  and East Asia   would see a weakening in  the US
 strategic posit.i'on vis-a-vis the Soviet  Union  because of
 downgrading;  in Southeast Asia,  the reaction would also include
 some concern  about  the  diminished US influence on China's
 behavior.
 Downgrading:   The Mechanics and Chinese Tactics
 China's strategy for downgrading would probably follow the
 precedent set in early 1981, when Beijing reduced its relations
 to the charge level after the Netherlands sold submarines to
 Taiwan.   We believe, however,  that the Chinese want to avoid
 drastic diplomatic action that would make it difficult to
 reinstitute a normal relationship if an agreement on Taiwan is
 reached in the future.  We also believe that Beijing wants to
 maintain diplomatic relations with the US and preserve the
 current structure of trade and educational exchanges--sources of
 real benefit to the Chinese.   Downgrading, therefore, would
 likely be limited to curtailing the most visible aspects of our
 current political and security relationship.
 In this context, Beijing would use the completion of the
 Congressional notification procedure on an arms transaction as-a
 pretext to begin downgrading.   At that time, we believe the
 Chinese would formally withdraw Ambassador Chai and perhaps
 .request the recall of Ambassador Hummel.   The result could leave
 charges d'affaires in place for some time.
 These steps would represent the minimum necessary for
 Beijing to make downgrading a credible pressure tactic.   The
 Dutch "precedent" allows for more dramatic steps, but we do not
 believe that Beijing wants to strictly follow the model.  That
 would require a return to the level of diplomatic
 representation--small liaison offices--prior to US-China
 normalization in 1972.
 In our view, cutbacks in political and security ties almost
 certainly would include the cessation of high-level visits and
 strategic consultations,  a drop in official travel between China

 and the US not related to educational or commercial exchanges,
 and tighter restrictions on official contacts with US diplomatic
 personnel in China.   The Chinese probably would ask for a
 reduction in the size of the Defense Attache Office in Beijing,
 might request the reduction of the overall size of the US
 Embassy, and could delay the planned openings o,f new consulates
 in both countries.
 We believe the currently planned Twelfth Congress of the
 Chinese Communist Party in September or October is a complicating
 factor that could influence the downgrading process.   Deng
 Xiaoping's politicking before the Congress, for example, might
 bring him to attempt to gain concessions on domestic matters by
 accommodating rivals who previously have opposed his policies
 toward the US.- At the same time, he could choose to move toward
 those critics to forestall a more vigorous attack from them on
 the US relationship.   In addition, China already has begun
 restricting contacts with foreigners, which we believe reflects
 growing official hostility toward all foreign influence--not just
 the US.   Such hostility could provoke resentment over a perceived
 violation of Chinese sovereignty following the sale of weapons to
 Taiwan.   At a minimum, it is likely to make bureaucrats at all
 levels anxious to toe the line in any prescribed downgrading
 process, which in turn could lead to a sharper Chinese response
 that we now anticipate.
 Downgradinq:   Costs to the United States
 The Taiwan issue and the more general adjustments  in Chinese
 foreign policy since last year--reasserting Beijing's role in the
 Third World and more sharply defining differences with the US on
 issues such as Israel and South Africa--have already set new
 limits on bilateral cooneration.   In our view, the changes in
 Chinese policy indicate that Beijing has revised its initial
 optimism about prospects for collaboration with Washington.
 Publicly, as well as privately, the Chinese are more downbeat
 about US policies in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere, arguing
 that US behavior is allowing Soviet inroads.  As a consequence-,
 they have put more distance between their stands and US policies
 in several regions, where,  in our view, even an end to the Taiwan
 problem now seems unlikely to bring a substantial)  closer
 alignment with the US.
 Downgrading will make Chinese foreign policy even more
 competitive with the US.  Beijing will accentuate its public
 condemnations of US "hegemonism"--its codeword for Soviet
 behavior--and become more open in exploiting "anti-imperialist"
 themes to enhance its standing in the Third World.  Along with
 more intense rhetorical attacks on US policies, the Chinese may
 try to undercut some US positions.
 For example, Beijing could ignore US nonproliferation
 concerns  in Pakistan and also turn aside US interests  in
 sustained consultations in Southeast Asia.   The Chinese will

 tailor their actions to demonstrate to the US the cost of the
 Taiwan problem, but without attacking those aspects of US policy
 that basically benefit Chinese interests.   Indeed, the Chinese
 probably believe they have some leeway in these areas to
 criticize Washington without undue concern over shifts in the
 anti-Soviet direction of US policy.
 Chinese officials repeatedly have asserted)                      I  25X1
 that downgrading will not affect Beijing's basic 25X1
 policies toward7the USSR.   That message has also been carried in
 the media, which continues to portray China's opposition to the
 Soviet Union as the centerpiece of its  policy.   Increased
 low-level exchanges with the USSR, however, make clear that
 Beijing intends to seek a lowering in tensions with Moscow and,
 in the event of a deterioration in Sino-US relations, will
 attempt to heighten US concern about a significant improvement in
 Sino-Soviet relations.                                                           25X1
 Whether or not downgrading occurs, we believe that China
 will keep pressure on the US regarding Taiwan and the arms sale
 issue.   If the relationship is downgraded, Beijing could
 reintroduce military exercises or similar moves in the Taiwan
 Strait as a way to remind the US that it had not abandoned a
 military option, and that Chinese restraint in the area should
 not be assumed.   We believe that any such actions would be
 limited in scope

 the Chinese would not publicize these
 activities or allude to them in a way that contradicted their
 continuing public emphasis on peaceful reunification.
 Chinese leaders have told visiting US officials that they
 want to keep their economic ties with the US intact, but we
 believe Beijing is certain to threaten obliquely selected US
 firms in an effort to warn Washington about the effect of US arms
 sales to Taiwan.   The Chinese are also likely to point to
 additional economic opportuntiies in China for the Western
 Europeans and the Japanese as a result of US policy actions,
 although decisions on new trade and investment will still depend
 on China's own economic policies and internal conditions.   If any
 major programs now involving US and other competitors are awarded
 to non-US firms--equipment for China's nuclear industry, for
 example--Beijing..will be certain to convey the alleged
 "political" rationale for the choice to official as well as
 private sector US contacts.
 Reactions Among Allies and Adversaries
 In our view, Western Europe and Japan have regarded improved
 US-China relations over the past decade as contributing to
 stability in Asia, encouraging China's turn to the West, and
 adding to US leverage with the Soviet Union.  The Europeans and
 the Japanese also regard relations with China as basic to their
 own Asian policies.  Despite their profitable trade and
 investment links with Taiwan, allied officials at several levels
 have told US counterparts that they doubt that Taiwan's need for
 new weapons justifies actions that would jeopardize the benefits
 of Washington's ties with Beijing.
 Chinese contacts with key US allies have already prompted
 some--the British and the Japanese--to counsel compromise on both
 sides.   These discussions and the regular relay to Washington of
 other Chinese warnings about the dangers in downgrading by the
 allies have probably temporarily exhausted Beijing's ability to
 use these avenues to pressure the US directly.  The Japanese, who
 have dealt with Beijing sufficiently to understand the US
 dilemma, would probably react sympathetically to the US position,
 despite the complications downgrading would create in their
 relations with China.   The West Europeans would probably be less
 understanding and will privately, if not publicly, blame US
 policy for losing a widely perceived strategic asset.   The
 British and the French may attempt to broaden their relations
 with China in order to preserve a bridge between China and the
 If a downturn in the US-China relationship occurs, we
 believe the NATO allies will initially address its implications
 for US and Soviet policy toward European security issues.   Some
 may hope that a cooler US relationship with China will help allay
 the Soviet's security concerns, but most probably will expect
 sharper competition between Washington and Moscow.

 Other reactions in Asia would reflect concern and
 uneasiness.   In private discussions with US visitors, South Korean
 officials consistently have regarded US-China normalization as an
 element for stability on the Korean peninsula.   A deterioration
 in Sino-US relations, we believe, would increase Seoul's
 anxieties about the advice Beijing will give Pyongyang and about
 its own efforts to establish commercial and political links with
 Beijing.   Reaction in ASEAN will vary, although ASEAN leaders
 would be concerned that an element of restraint on Chinese policy
 in Southeast Asia has been diminished.   Despite its previous
 expressions of concern over US intentions toward China, even
 Indonesia would fear that any weakening of the US connection
 would make China a more active threat to its interests.
 Taiwan would be pleased by the downgrading of US-China
 relations, but would be unlikely to express its satisfaction in a
 manner calculated to goad Beijing into further retaliation
 against the US.   How Taiwan would treat the Chinese peaceful
 reunification campaign following downgrading is uncertain, but we
 believe Taipei probably would conclude that there was
 considerably less need to appear responsive for the benefit of a
 Uncertainty in Moscow about the extent and duration of
 downgrading would probably produce an initially cautious
 attitude, although the Soviet media would move quickly to extract
 maximum publicity from the downturn.   The Soviets would attempt
 to play on the view, particularly in West Europe, that the US had
 denied itself a strategic asset and would portray this as an
 indication of incoherence and inconsistency in US policy.
 If the Soviets eventually concluded that downgrading in
 US-China cooperation was enduring, they would believe that the
 potential threat of strategic encirclement had been at least
 temporarily relieved.   At START talks in Geneva, for example, the
 Soviets recently warned that they would demand that the talks
 include Chinese nuclear weapons if the cooperation between the US
 and China were to broaden--a statement, albeit intended primarily
 for the record, that underscores the depth of Moscow's concern
 over a firm US-China relationship.
 In general, we believe Beijing will claim to audiences in
 the US and in key allied capitals that the onus for downgrading
 rests on this Administration and its policies.   In so doing,
 however, the Chinese will not close the door on negotiations over
 the Taiwan issue.   The Chinese also will emphasize that new US
 policies on Taiwan or a new US leadership could expect to gain
 greatly from a re-establishment of normal relations.
