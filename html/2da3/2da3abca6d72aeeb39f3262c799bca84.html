				  	ai^~d  foreign  policy  folloxed  b~  the  new  leaders  of  China~  about  their
				  	attitude  toxaxd  the  ideolo~ical  and  politica,l  herita.ge  of  the  deceased				  	-
				  	cha,irma.n  of  th~  Communist  Party	 	China,    	But  yet  certain  tenriencies
				  	ha,ve  already  appeared  with  a  greater  or  lesser  degree  of  certainty.
			     	~   	The  first  ia  tihe  very  obvioue  conclusion  which  su~eats  ita3elf~  and  is
				  	contained  in  t:ze  ~l.itility  of  the  hopes  that  the  dea,th  of  the  "great
				  	helmaman"   	will  le~,d  to  strengthening  the  unity  of  his  successors.    	As  is
				  	known,  Mao  Zedong  conducted  work  that  was  gigantic  in  its  scope  and
				  	effort  and  unheard  of  in  its  cruelty,  work  directed  against  everyone
				  	who     	even  in  the  slightest  degree  was  able  to  be  suspected  of  opposi~tion
				  	lee,nings  to  his  ideology~  politic~~  or  culture.    	The  "cultural  revolution,"			 	~
				  	which  led    	to  dra,ma,tic  consequences  for  the  politica,l  sysi;e~?,  for  the
				  	higher  leaderehip~  for  the  whole  party,  had  as  one  of  its  main  goals  to
				  	guaxantee  during  the  life  and  after  the  death  of  Ma,o  the  complete  elimina-
				  	t~on  of  opposition  forces,  to  insure  unity  on  the  platform  of  the  '"ideas
				  	of  Mao  Zedong."
				  	ke  see  now  how  illusory  this  hope  was,  how  fruitless  the  gigantic  efforts
				  	an3  sacrifices  were.    	The  death  of  Ma,o  Zecio:ig  led  to  the  most  acute  clash
				  	of  forces  on  the  politica,l  Olympus  of  China,.    	The  ideologica,l  pla,tform  of
				  	Maoism   	~ just  exa.ctly  like  the  "eleven  ~,reat  politica.l  campaigns"  to  which
				  	Hua,  GuoYeng  referred.  at  the  llth  Congress  of  the  CYiinese  Communist  Party
	     	_		  	have  not  given  even  a  minimum  gua,rantee  against  a  new  round  of  an  acute
				  	struggle  for  power~  for  j.nfluence,  arui  even  over  problems  of  ideology  arui
				  	p411tics.
				  	The  second  and  to  a  certa,in  degree  sensationa,l  event  was  the  catastrophic
			.		  	downfall  of  the  "lef'tists"--namely  those  leaders  who  were  closest  of  all
				  	to  Ma,o  Zedong.    	The  defeat  of  the  "gang  of  four"  is  the  defeat  of  the
				  	people  who  had  practically  the  strongest  influex~ce  on  Ma,o  Zedong  in  the
			-		  	last  10  years.
	     	_		  	Thirdly,   	it  is  possible  to  esta,blish  the  temporary  consolidation  of  the
				  	new  politica,l  lea,dership  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party.    	The  rapproche-
				  	ment  of  representatives  of  the  "old  gua,rd"--Deng  Xia,oping,  YA  Jiar~ying  and
				  	others  with  figures  from  the  period  of  the  "cultura,l  revolution~"  and
				  	particula,r~.y  Hua,  Guofeng,  for  a  certain  time  consolidated  the  lead.ership
				  	of  theChinese  Communist  Party  ara.~  the  PRC.    	But  only  for  a  certain  time.
				  	F~Zn~damental  problems  of  policy  sti.ll  a.re  not  praperly  being  discu~sed ~
				  	the  course  of  domestic,  and  paxticula,rly  foreign,  policy  still  is  not
				  	being  worked  out  and  it  is  possible  to  foresee  an  acute  struggle  before
				  	this  course  is  stabilized  for  an  extended  periodo    	There  is  no  doubt  tha�~			    	-
				  	the  struggle  axound  policy  arui  ideology,  just  as  befare,  is  closely  intex-
				  	twined  with  the  struggle.fc~r  power  and  influence.							'			   	'
				  	A  symptom  of  the  acute  struggle  between  the  "raisers"  of  the  ba.nner  of
				  	Ma.o  Zeclong  and  the  "undercutters"  of  this  ba,nner  (this  is  the  terminology
			-		  	of  the  official  Chinese  press)  is  the  speech  of  the  vi~e  cha,irma,n  af  the

				 	which  is  Saudi  Arabia.
				 	What  is  the  criterion  for  rela.ting  state  ownership  to  socialist  ownership?
				 	First  of  all  the  character  of  the  production  relations   	(the  absence  of				   	_
				 	exploitation),  the  nature  of  power  (working  claes   	.and  laborers  lea,d  the
				 	state),  the  way  of  li~'e  (high  living  sta~dard,  satisfaction  of  economic				 	~
				 	and  social    	rights  and  participation  of  the  workers  in  ma,na,gement).    	State
	     	-		  	ownership  becomes  socialist  not  because  it  is  state,  but  because  it  is  in
				 	the  hands  of  a  sociali3t  state,  which  disposes  of  the  property  in  the  in-
				 	terests  of  the  wurking  class  and  all  laborers,    	This  means  that  state				    	-
				 	property  pla,ys  the  same  role  played.  by  the  state  itself.    	An  important
				  	external  indicator  of  the  character  of  the  system  is  the  pol-~cy--economic~
				  	social,   	cultural  and  foreign  policy  as  well.						     	.
				 	Where  does  the  n~ional  income  go  in  China?   	To  the  development  of  military
	     	-		  	prod.uction,   	to  the  solution  of  na,tiona,listic  suger-problems,   	to  turning				 	-
				  	the  country  in  a  short  time  into  the  domina,nt  power  in  the  modern  world?					-
				  	Or  to  the  development  of  public  productlon  and  f~.iller  satisfaction  of  the
				  	needs  of  the  workers?    	Who  is  distributing  the  property?    	Are  the  workers
				  	paxticipa,ting  in  administration of  the  state~  in  determining  the  economic  and
				  	social  goals  of  d~velopment'?    	In  other  words,  is  a  socialis~  3emocracy  being				_
				  	imp7.emented?   	What  is  the  role  of  the  state  on  the  international  arena,
				  	is  it  subordinating  its  own  policy  to  the  interests  of  the  Chinese  workers,
				  	~s  it  entering  into  an  alliance  with  other  eoc3alist  nations  and  countries

				  	to  3udge  properly  the  na,ture  of  the  socioeconomic  and  poli'.ical  system  in
				  	China..
				  	As  the  Chinese  leaders  the~mselves  note,  in  the  last  10-12  years  there  has
			_		  	beon  a  sharp  intensification  of  the  technical  la,g  of  the  PRC  beh~ind  the

			  	The~e  is  no  mention  of  the  policy  of  the  "P~ur  modernizations"  in  even

			  	political  atruggle  on  behalf  of  turning  Clhina,  into  a  mighty  militaxy
			  	power.    	Here  is  all  the  "constructive"  'bagga,ge  of  Ma,o  Zedong,  wtiich  people
			  	like  Roger  Ga~,u~y  clearly  based  on  ideas  of  anti-Sovietism  call  the					  	-
			  	Chinese  "model  of  socialism."
		-		 	Meanwhile  the  sociallst  transformation  of  ownership  is  a  many-sided  act.
			  	It  pursues  different  goals~   	liquidation  of  the  exploiter  cla,sses  and  the					-
			  	social  grounds  for  exploitation  of  ma,n  by  ma,n,  giving  the  masses  access
	 	_		 	to  ma,na,gement  of  the  econo~y,  raising  the  level  of  productivity  of  soci,al
			  	].abor.    	The  socialization  itself  ehould  be  adeq,uately  prepared  in  the
	 	~		 	economic,  social  and  cultural  respects.    	Otherw3s.e  it  can  take  on  a  one-					'
			  	sided  and  even  deformed  chara,cter~  not  contributing  to  a  rise  in  productivity
	 	-		 	ofl  l.abor  or  to  accuatoming  the  masses  to  ma,na,gement  of  production.    	Namely
			  	the  la,tter  is  what  occurred  in  China,.
			  	It  goes  without  saying  ~hat  the  victory  of  sta,te  ownership  in  the  city  and
			  	forma,ti~n  of  cooperatives  in  the  countryside  is  a  ma3or  achievement  of  the
			  	Chinese  revolution.    	But  this  is  only  a  frontler  (although  an  important
	  	~		 	one~,  which  it  was  especially  necessaxy  to  take  into  account  in  China,,  where
			  	there  were  extended  traditions  of  sta,te  socialization  under  feudalism.
			  	The  emergence  of  modern  industry  in  China,  at  the  er~.  of  the  19t~h  and
	  	~		 	beginning  of  the  20th  centuries  in  China,  was  connected  exactly  with  the
	 	-		 	developmant  of  state  cpaitalism,  ar~l  the  first  enterprises  were  under  the
	 	-		 	ownership  and  disposition  of  the  sta,te.    	In  China,  there  was  not  or				    	.
			  	practica.lly  was  not  a  cla,sa  independent  of  the  state,   	like  the  bourgeaisie
	 	-		 	in  E~rope  in  the  period  of  primary  accumula,tion  and  the  first  iruiustrial
			  	revolution.    	The  large  industrial  and  trading  compa,nies  axising  at  that
			  	time  (for  instance,   	the  Chinese  commercial  steamship  line,  coa,l  mines  and.
	 	,		 	others)  belonged  to  the  statA  or  to  officials.    	The  development  arui  flour -
			  	ishing  of  these  or  other  priva,te  companies  also  wholly  depended  on  the  state,
	 	,			on  its  licenses  and  subsidies  at  the  expense  of  tax  monies.    	It  is  not
			  	by  accident  tha,t  the  Ch.iar~g Ba,ishek  government  not  only  did  not  strive  to
	 	-			destroy  this  tradition  but,  on  the  contrary~  helped  to  strengthen  it.    	In
			  	h3s  book  "The  Fa,te  of  China,,"  Chiang  Ka.ishek    	irisisted,  in  particula,r,  on
			  	the    	idea  of  the  developra:t  of  a  state  econo~y.    	Considering  all  this~
			  	after  the  revolution  it  was  necessary  for  the  Chinese  leadera  to  ma,nifest
			  	especial  discretion  in  ca,rtying  out  socialization  of  property  so  vha,t  it
			  	would  actually  bear  a  genuine~y  socialist    	chara,cter.
			  	In  Ma,rxist  literature  of  recent  years  the  opinion   	ha,s  been  ma,inta,ined.  that

				   	The  first  path  is  the  gradua,l   	advancement  toward  scientific    	socialism
				   	on  the  basis  of  development  of  the  economar,  growth  in  the  working  cla.ss~
				   	the  popular  intelligentsi~,,  accustoming  the  peasantry  to  an  active  polftical
			-		   	life~  and  development  of  a  socialist  democracy.
				   	The  second  path  is  restoration  of  ca,pitalism  and  a  return  to  prerevolutiona,ry
				   	rel.a,tions,  which  is  very  unlikely.
				   	The  third  path  is  extended  preservation  of  the  petit~bourgeois  ar~l  semi-			     	"
				   	feudal  forms  of  "socialism,"  the  subsequent  development  of  which  in  the
				   	flzture  cannot  be  imagined  even  on  a  theoretical  level,
				   	Of  course,  we  axe  wholly  in  favor  of  the  first  path  of  development  for
				   	China,  hoWever  the  ~ture  will  show  the  direction  that  China,  will  follow.
				   	The  fact  is  tha,t  in  the  country  the  radica,l-na,tiona,listic  forces  ha,ve
				   	ga3.ned~the  upper  hand  and  they~  reflecting  the  long  traditions  of  the  pa,st,
				   	are  using  the  social,   	cultural  and  politica,l  backwardneas  c,f  the  masses~
				   	the  objective  difficulties  of  the  nonca,pitaliat  path  of  transition  to
				   	socialism  in  a  country  that  is  extremely  backxard  in  an~economi~c  and  social
				   	respect.
				   	Also  appearing  highly  unlikely  is  the  restora,tion  of  ca,pitalism,  since  in
				    	the  country  there  is  not  even  one  class  or  social  group  which  would  be
				    	interested    	in  restoration  of  private  ownership.    	Neither  the  woxkers~  nor			  	`
				    	the  peasants,  nor   	the  intelligen+,sia  is  interested  in  this.    	With  respect
				    	to  the  growing  group  of  the  "ganbu,"  it  even  now  is  enj.oying  all  the
				   	priv ileges  of  power  and  Well-being  in  China,.    	This  group  in  fact  ha,s  cha,rge
		 	-		  	of  state  proDerty,  and  transferrin~  it  to  the  hands  of  some  pr3vate  persons
				    	ar  others,  eva~n  highly-p?aced  leaders,  would  be  of  grave  detriment  to  this
				   	BrouP.
				   	Then~  apparently,  the    	most  proba,ble  is  the  exteruied  development  of  China.
				    	in  the  existing  forms~  which  were  inherited  by  the  new  lea,ders  as  the
				    	legacy  from  the  former  period  of  Ma,o.    	The  slogan  of  the  "four  maierniza-
				   	tions,"  which  does  not  provid~e  for  any  significant  social  transforma,tions     	~
				   	in  the  social  and  politica,l  system,  reflecta  na,mely  this  tendency.    	Thia  is
				   	a  technological  and  technocratic  sloga,n,  but  not  a  sociopolitica,l  one.

					     	[Text]    	One  o�  the  most  important  tasks  where  population  geography  is  ac-
					     	tively  involved  in  a  solution  is  the  task  of  a  long-range  forecast  for  the
					     	distribution  of  the  nation's  population.    	The  forecasting  of  the  population
					     	which  acts  as  a  most  i.mportant  component  in  the  spatial  systems  axising  as
					     	e.  result  of  the  interaction  of  natural  conditions,  the  economy  and  popula-		     	-
					     	tion  at  present  is  assuming  particulaxly  impor-cant  significance.
					     	Considering  that  the  aim  of  social  production  in  a  socialist  sor,iety  ulti-
					     	mately  is  the  f~zllest  satisfaction  of  all  the  needs  of  its  members,   	as  well
					     	as  that  the  distribution  of  the  population  in  the  vaxious  parts  of  the
					     	country  hc~s  formed  in  the  process  of  extended  historical  development  and  is
					     	marked  by  a  substantiel  "conservativeness"  of  the  most  general  features  of
					     	this  distribution,  a  long-range  forecast  of  the  size  of  the  population  (and
		     	-		     	particularly  the  lab~r  contingents)  to  a  significant  degree  will  correct
		     	-		     	the  forecast  for  the  development  of  the  regional  economies  of  the  USSR.
					     	This  in  no  way  plays  down  the  significance  and  possibilities  of  planning
					     	efforts  on  the  optimum  redistribution  of  the  population  between  the  regions
					     	of  the  country.
					     	For  forecasting  the  population  of  a  region,  a  number  of  modeis  can  be  used,
					     	and  these  include  a  demographic  model,  a  model  of  the  migration  balance  and
					     	a  model  of  the  population's  employment  which  directly  establishes  the  rela-
					     	tionship  between  the  number  of  ~obs  a.nd  size  and  structure  of  the  population
					     	(4].    	It  must  be  emphasized  that  the  demographic  model  is  the  most  constant,
					     	"base"  mpdel,  while  the  remaining  models  can  have  a  more  "flexible"  nature,
					    	they  are  marked  by  multivariance,  and  to  a  greater  degree  are  complimentary
					    	to  the  demographic  model.    	This  emphasizes  its  determining  role  for  fore-
					    	casting  the  alreac~y  existing  population  of  a  region.
					    	For  constructing  a  forecast  of  the  population  in  our~multinational  country

		    	-		 	The  forecasting  of  the  national  composition  of  the  population  of  the  nation
						an d  its  individual  regions  for  the  purposes  ot  forecasting  the  populatiion
						per  se,  and  the  population  as  a  component  cf  the  man--econoiqy--nature  sys-
						tem  has  particular  importance  for  the  following  factors.
						l.    	The  various  peoples  are  in  different  stages  of  a"demographic  transi-
						tion"   	[3],  and  this  determines  the  various  types  of  the  natural  movement  of
						th e  population,  and,   	in  turn,  this  influences  the  size  of  the  nationalities,
						th e  age-sex  structure,  the  size  of  the  family,,  and  so  forth  [5).
						2.    	To  a  varying  degree  different  peoples  participate  in  migration  proces-
						ses.    	For  this  reason  over  the  foreseeable  future,  the  national  composition
		     	~		 	of  the  USSR  population  to  a  significant  degree  will  influence  the  possi-
						bilities  of  the  redistr~ibution  of  the  population  between  the  regions  of  -L-he
						country,  particularly  ~hose  with  labor  surplusses  and  labor  shortages  [10].
						3.    	As  a  result  of  the  deepening  process  of  the  ethnic  merging  of  the
		     	_		 	peoples  in  the  USSR,  the  number  of  nationally  mixed  fa.milies  is  growing,
						and  the  indicators  for  the  na-tural  and  mechanical  movement  for  these  fami-
						lies,  as  well  as  their  difference  from  the  corresponding  indicators  for  the
						fe.milie3  of  a  uninational  composition,   	still  have  not  been  given  proper  at -
						tention  by  the  researchers.						~
							A  ma~ority  of  the  types  of  huisan  activity  to  one  degree  or  another
						possesses  an  ethnic  cast,  be  it  the  labor  skills  and  domestic  features
						which  have  accumulated  historica]1y  in  the  ethnos,  or  the  specific  features			  	_
						of  the  effect  of  the  ethnos  on  nature  [1.~5].    	This,   	in   	turn,  cannot  help
				     	.but  influence  the  nature  of  the  long-range  employment  of  the  population  and
						th e  territorial  structure  of  the  econoiqy,  housing  construction,  the  consump-
						tion  structure,  and  the  specific  transformation  and  conservation  of  the  en-
		     	,			vironment  in  regions  wi~h  a  differing  national  composition  of  the  popula-
						tion.
						5.    	The  guiding  line  of  the  party  and  government   	in  nationality  relation-
						ships  is  the  flourishing  and  merging  of  all  the  peoples  of  the  USSR  and
						ac hieving  the  actual  equality  of  peoples  in  all  areas  of  state  and  cultural
						construction.    	In  this  context,  the  placement  a.nd  level  of  socioeconomic		   	~
						development  among  the  various  peoples  of  our  country  for  an  extended  time
						to   	come  will  influence  the  distribution  of  centralized  capital  investments.
						Undoubtedly,  the  designated  factors  cover  only  the  most  important  aspects
						which  determine  the  necessity  of  fbrecasting  the  size,  ratio  and  distribu-
						tion  of  the  Soviet  peoples.

					  	represented,  and.  in  a  number  of  instances  they  are  superimposed  one  on  the
					  	other  and  are  difficult  to  differentiate.
					  	Under  the  conditions  of  multinational  r~gions,   	it  is  essential  to  know  the
					  	direction  and  rate  of~occurrence  of  the  ethnic  processes  depending  upon  the		    	-
		  	_		     	ratio  of  the  number  of  peoples  in  contact.and  the  level  of  "disperseness"
					  	and  the~rec~.procal  penetration  of  the  peoples  "one  with  the  other."
					  	Let  us  exami.ne  a  certain  territorial  unit  in  which  there  is  an  international
					  	eontact  of  ethnic  g~oup  (A)  with  a  surrotinding  people  of  different  nation-
					  	ality.    	For  our  purposes,   	it  is  most.suitable  to  divide  the  territory  int~
					  	elementary  cells  of  intensive  popul~tion  contacts   	(ETC)  which  are  compre-
		  	_		     	hensive  regions  having  complete  sets  of  the  functional  subregions  neces-			  	-
					  	sary  for  the~daily  life  and  activities  of  the  adult  working  part  of  the  in-
					  	habitr~nts   	[16].    	Here  we  would  assume  that  all  the  ethnic  groups  in  the
					  	studied  territorial  unit  live  mixed  together,  and  the  probability  of  the
					  	establishing  of  contact  between  any  two  individuals  does  not  depend  upon
					  	their  national  affiliation.    	The  first  condition  is  best  satisfied  by  tbe
					  	large  industrial  cities  and  new  cities  which  create  "internatianal  cente�...:."
					  	The  realizing  of  the  second  condition.is  a  question  of  the  d~sl;ant  futw  a,
					  	and.depends  upon  a~reakening  of  the  national  aspect  in  the  life  of  the  ~,opu-
					  	lation,  although  a  whole  series  of  reseaxchers  even  now  has  noted  a  teniency
					  	toward  its  weakening.    	The  established  ETC  are  the  operational  units  for  the		 	.
					  	regional  forecast  of  the  population,   	since  Por  precisely  these  territorial
					  	cells  it  is  possible  to  construct  balance  models  of  population  employment;

					  	ing  the  long-range  changes  in  its  territory)  are  the  real  basis  for  the  re-
					  	maining  types  of  forecast  models.    	The  most  suitable  for  the  ETC  is  the  pro-
					  	cedure  proposed  by  ethnographers  for  calculating  the  theoretical  probability
		   	-		     	of  the  coneluding  of  international  marriages  between  the  representatives  of

				    	The  designated  studies  were  based  on  the  notion  that  the  theoretical  proba-

				    	the  frequencies  of  each  phenomenon  individual.ly,  that  is,  the  product  of  the

		  	_		  	~~he  share  of  brides  of  nationality  ,j  in  al'1  the  brides  of  the  same  region
				    	[2].    	In  practiee  we  often  do  not  have  data.available  on  the  national  affil-				_
				    	iation  of  those  entering  maxriage,   	and  the  ethnic  processes  in  no  way  can
				    	be  reduced  to  ,~ust  the  marriage  and  fami.ly  contacts.    	Proceeding  from  this,
				    	the  theoretical  probability  of  the  establishing  of  interethnic  contacts  be-
				    	tween  the~representatives  of  ethnic  group   	(A),   	independently  of  their  na-

		   	_		 	For  example,   	if  the  share  of  ethnic  group   	(A)   	in  the  population  of  the  ETC
				    	is  0.35,  then  considering  all  the  possible  ethnic  contacts  in  the  region  as

				    	(A):    	0.35�(1.00 -  0.35)  =  0.2275.
				    	The  theoretical  share  of  the  intraethnic  contacts  of  ethnic  group   	(A)  is

				 	the  large  cities.    	The  correlation  dependence  is  most  successful.ly  described
				 	by  a  second-order  parabola.    	However,  we  assume  that  the  actual  dependence
		 	~			ascertained  on  the  basis  of  the  ETC  on  a  graph  will  be  closest  to  a  hyper-
		 	~			bola  with  a  symmetrical  axis  y=  x.    	This  reflects  the  intensification  of
				 	the  ethnic  processes,  when  the  share  of  the  ethnic  group  in  the  population
				 	is  either  completely  insignificant,  or  decisively  predominates  over  the
				 	share  of  the  foreign  groups  around   	(the  processes  of  assimilation  or  assimi-

				 	The  nature  of  the  foreign  surro~ndings  of  a  people  also  influences  the
		 	.			amount  of  the  deviation  of  the  actua.l  frequency  of  births  in  nationally
				 	mixed  fa.mili.es  from  the  theoretical  probability  of  interethnic  contacts,
				 	in  addition  to  the  choice  of  the  territorial  cell  for  studying  these  con-
				 	tacts.    	For  considering  the  latter  factor,  using  the  concept  of  a"coeffi-

				 	On  the  basis  of  the  published  materials  of  the  1970  All-Union  Census,  we

				 	spread  of  nat~onally  mixed  families   	(Fig.   	3).    	Regardless  of  a  certain
				 	hypothetical  nature  of  the  comparison  made  (the  ps.tchyness  index  and  the
				 	share  of  nationally  mixed  families  are  given  not  for  the  ETC,~but  rather
				 	for  the  entire  undivided  territory  of  the  national  autonomous  formation),
				 	out  of  the  a~gregate  of  national  autonomous  formations  we  have  selected
				 	those  where  a  significa.nt  portion  of  the  population  is  comprised  of  repre-
				 	sentatives  of  peoples  which  because  of  particular  features  of  everyday  life
				 	and  culture  and  the  existin~  experience  of  international  contact,   	as  a  rule,
				 	tuke  a  ra,ther  active  part  in  the  various  forms  of  in'terethnic  interaction
	 	-				up  to  including  family  and  marriage  relations.    	Thus,  the  northern  and  Far
				 	Ea.stern  national~-autonomous  formations  sta~d  out  in  an  i~creased  share  of
				 	nationally  mixed  families,  and  here  the  population  has  been  formecl  predom-

				 	Ukrainians,  Belorussians,  peoples  from  the  Volga  Region,  and  others)  and
	 	-				representatives  of  the  indigenous  nationalities.    	At  present,  here  there  is
	  	-				occurring  a  process  of  the  assimilation  of  the  ethnic  groups  and  a  reduc-
				 	tion  in  the  values  of  the  patchyness  index  of  the  national  composition  of
				 	the  population  [15~.
				 	We  assume  that  in  constructing  the  regional  population  forecasts,  the  em-
				 	ployed  demographic  model  can  be  broken  up  into  a  series  of  models  according
				 	to  the  nationality  principle.    	The  forecast  of  a  region"s  population  should
				 	consist  of  the  population  forecasts  for  the  individual  nationalities  with
				 	an  obligatory  subdivision  into  urban  and  rural  inhabitants.    	This  corres-
				 	ponds  to  the  differing  type~  of  the  natural  movement  oY  the  population.
				 	The  elaboration  of  the  forecasts  for  the  individual  national  groups  re-
				 	quires  a  thorough  reorganization  of  current'statistical  reporting  and  census

				   	from  one  national  affiliation  to  another,  there  are  equally  essential
				   	"ethnoevolutionary  changes  in  the  ethnos"   	([1],  p  153).    	And  the  latter
				   	play  possibly  not  such  a  marked  role  in  changing  the  characteristics  of
				   	peoples,  but  over  the  long  run  the  failure  to  consider  them  can  to  a  si~-
				   	nificunt  degree  influence  the  accuracy  of  the  forecast.    	In  the  ideal  the
	   	_		     	model  of  ethnic  processes,  like  a  demographic  model,   	should  consider:
				   	1)  the  processes  of  a  weakening  of  national  aspects  in  the  life  of  the  pop-		    	-
				   	ulation   	(like  the  temporary  strengthenings  of  these  aspects  at  certain
				   	stages);  2)  the  spread  of  the  features  of  the  urban  way  of  life  and  the
				   	evening  aut  of  national  features  by  them;   	3)  the  reciprocal  penetration  of
				   	the  national  cultures  of  the  Soviet  p~oples  and  the  selection  of  the  par-
				   	ticular  features  of  everyday  life  and  the  econom~y  which  are  most  successful
				   	for  the  existing  social  and  natural  milieu,  and  certain  other  aspects.
	    	_		     	It  is  essential  to  point  out  that  both  in  the  migration  model  and  to  a  great		   	'
				   	degree  in  the  model  of  population  employment,  the  fixin~  of  ethnic  aspects
				   	is  also  of  substa.ntial  significance.    	At  present,  without  considering  the
				   	national  composition  of  the  population,  we  cannot  construct  either  a  popula-
				   	tion  forecast  or  the  particular  forecasts  of  the  natural  movement  of  the
				  	population,  migration,  urbanization,  environmental  conservation,  and  much

					Our  Soviet  Union  is  a  multinational  state.    	And  experience  has  shown  that
					the  basic  features  of  the  federative  structure  of  the  USSR  has  fully  ~usti-

					CPSU  Central  Committee,  Comrade  L.I.   	Brezhnev  subsequently  emphasized  that
				 	to  the  eovereign  righte  guarded  by  the  USSR,  there  are  "added  new  ones,  such			   	-
					as   	the  right  of   	the  republics'  participation  in  the  solution  of  questions  by
					union  organs  relating  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  USSR."51
				 	In  the  Council  of  the  Union  of  the  USSR  Supreme  Soviet,  Uzbek  SSR  is  repre-

					Permanent  Com~i.saion  for  Foreign  Affaira  of  the  Council  of  the  Union  of  the
					USSR  Supreme  Soviet.    	Two  representatives  of  iJzbekistan  have  been  chosen  to

				 	Regardless  of  the  form  and  methods  of  the  foreign-policy  activity  of  the
