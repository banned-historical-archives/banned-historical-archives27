 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 2 October 1958
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 TAIWAN STRAIT SITUATION
 Propaganda - Diplomacy
 The absence of Mao Tse-
 tung and Liu Shoa-chi from Pei-
 ping  during   the                       latter two
 thirds of September, at a time
 when the standing committee of
 the Chinese Communist party
 politburo would be expected to
 meet frequently over the Taiwan
 Strait situation, suggests that
 Chou En-tai has been directing
 China's campaign to recover the
 offshore  islands  within the
 framework of policy: laid down
 at a politburo meeting in late
 August.
 Peiping's propaganda con-
 tinues to reflect a desire to
 continue the Warsaw talks,  blam-
 ing the deadlock on American in-
 sistence on an immediate cease-
 fire but making no threat to
 suspend the negotiations. Brit-
 ish Foreign Secretary Lloyd told
 Secretary Dulles on 25 September
 that the British charge in Pei-
 ping reported a conversation with
 an Indian Embassy officer there,
 from which it appeared that the
 Chinese Communists "want to keep
 the Warsaw talks going."   The
 charge's report apparently con-
 tained a hint that India might
 undertake mediation between the
 Chinese Communists and  the
 United States.   Peiping is un-
 likely, however, to desire such
 mediation at this time.
 The Chinese Communists ap-
 parently hope to derive from the
 Warsaw talks substantial politi-
 cal benefits which will further
 their campaign to achieve wider
 international acceptance.   They
 clearly believe that bilateral
 negotiations further their ef-
 forts to appear as "near equals"
 with the United States.   Their
 negotiator,   Wang Ping-nan,
 publicly declared on 29 Septem-
 ber that Communist China's au-
 thority in the "international
 arena is rising ever higher."
 Peiping's  propaganda
 strongly suggests a willingness
 to consider "recovery" of the
 offshore islands as the price
 for a temporary renunciation
 of force in the Taiwan Strait
 area.   Repeated commentaries
 state that  Communist  China
 has "every right and necessity"
 to  take  "military measures"
 against the offshore islands
 and imply that other territo-
 ries--Taiwan and the Penghus
 (Pescadores)--could be '!liber-
 ated" by peaceful means.   In
 his National  Day  speech on 1
 October,  Defense Minister Peng
 Te-huai continued this approach,
 distinguishing  between the
 "direct  menace"  from  the off-
 shore islands  and  Communist
 China's aim to liberate Taiwan
 "at a suitable time."
 Mao Tse-tung, appealing
 for international condemnation
 of the United States, recently
 declared that in its threats
 of "atomic war,;" the  United
 States has alienated more than
 90 percent of the "people of
 the whole world."  This approach
 was repeated in a  People's
 Daily editorial on 30 September
 wTi1c'h  stated  that American

 threats of nuclear war confront
 the "people of the world" with
 the task of "staying the hands"
 of the United States.
 Pravda  on  29  September
 echoed andamplified Peiping's
 position that American insist-
 ence on a  cease-fire.in the
 strait area and   "renunciation
 of force" is completely  "out
 of the question," inasmuch as
 a state of war does not exist
 between the United States and
 Communist China.  Pravda also
 charged that the United States
 is seeking to  break  off  the
 talks in order to bring the
 16TAfAN
 EHRTAN
 question before the United Na-
 .tions, where American pressure
 tactics and intimidation could
 be employed.   Soviet propagan-
 dists have instead stressed the
 seating of Communist China in
 the UN, and some have stated
 this to be the "only solution"
 to the crisis.
 The  first  Soviet  hint
 since the onset of the Taiwan
 Strait crisis of willingness to
 supply "volunteer" assistance
 to Communist China appeared in
 the army newspaper Red Star on
 25 September.   In an article
 recounting how Soviet pilot
 volunteers had fought in China
 against the Japanese,   it was
 claimed that Soviet pilots are

 "ready, if necessary, to come
 to the aid of their true Chi-
 nese friends...."  Soviet Avia-
 tion has subsequently rie
 similar items hinting at mili-
 tary support of Peiping; it re-
 ferred on 28 September to the
 comradeship-in-arms of Soviet
 and Chinese Communist pilots
 and asserted that "like brothers
 we will fight the hated enemy
 together if they dare attack
 us."
 The American Embassy in
 Moscow believes these articles
 provide the first indications
 that Soviet military personnel
 are being psychologically pre-
 pared for service in China. So-
 viet military press organs have
 been consistently 1_less:~? re-
 strained inscommenting on the
 Taiwan Strait issue than other
 Soviet propaganda media.
 A Pravda editorial of I
 October repeated previous warn-
 ings that the Soviet Govern-
 ment regards an attack on Com-
 munist China as an attack on the
 USSR itself, adding that the
 Soviet people "are prepared at
 any moment to go to the assist-
 ance" of the Chinese Communists.
 The Chinese Communist De-
 fense Ministry's announcement
 that parts of Sidewinder mis-
 siles fired by Nationalist
 planes have been recovered and
 brought to Peiping for "public
 exhibition" indicates that Amer-
 ican "warmongering" will con-
 tinue to be a major theme in
 Communist propaganda during the
 Warsaw talks.   The announcement
 promised "punitive" action
 against the Chinese Nationalist
 Air Force:   Premier Chou En-lai
 on 30 September made a similar
 promise.
 Military Situation
 Communist artillery con-
 tinues its harassing and inter-
 dictory fire on the Chinmens.
 Delayed-action fuses are being
 used to increase shell penetra-
 tion of Nationalist defenses.
 there are
 200 new Communist gun positions
 in the Chinmen area, making a
 total of over 1,000 positions,
 of which about 650 have guns.
 There has been a corresponding
 rtillery increase in the Matsu
 area, where there are now 105
 guns as compared with 70 on
 30 June.
 The resupply of the Chin-
 men Islands has improved during
 the   past week  despite  bad
 weather and continued Communist
 artillery fire.   The average
 tonnage delivered per day has
 risen from approximately 100
 to nearly 200 tons.   A number
 of innovations have been re-
 sponsible for this increase,
 including off-loading of bulk
 cargo from LST's offshore to
 LCM's for delivery to the beach,
 stepping-up of air drops, use
 of motor junks for delivery of
 foodstuffs, and off-loading of
 partly filled drums into the
 sea to be towed ashore.   As of
 30 September, the Chinmen gar-
 rison still had a supply of ap-
 proximately 30 days of food-
 stuffs and ammunition.
 The loan by the  United
 States of 16 C-119 transport
 aircraft should substantially
 increase air-drop deliveries
 as soon as these are placed in
 operation.   The Taiwan Defense
 Command expects that improvement
 in air-drop tonnage and in sea
 supply will raise tonnages de-
 livered to a total adequate to
 support the islands indefinite-
 ly.
 Civilian food stocks on
 Chinmen are believed to be ade-
 quate to support the civil pop-
 ulation through next spring.
 The supply is believed adequate

 undue hardship. The Nationalist
 press, however, reports that
 the situation of the civilians
 on Little Chinmen is critical,,
 with only a 15-day supply of
 food remaining on the island.
 Chinese Nationalist   of-
 ficials now are optimistic that
 the blockade  of  Chinmen  has
 been broken and that the island
 is "strangulation proof" unless
 the Communists use new weapons
 or new interdiction tactics. They
 are also more hopeful that means

 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Lebanon
 President Shihab has post-
 poned until next week the spe-
 cial session of Parliament which
 will be asked to return A vote
 of confidence for the cabinet
 of Tripoli rebel leader Rashid
 Karame.   The delay will permit
 more time to consider proposals
 for increasing the size of the
 cabinet to admit some members
 acceptable to the pro-Chamoun
 faction.   Karame, however, has
 declared that he will not agree
 to enlarge the  cabinet  until
 it has received parliamentary
 approval.  Chamoun, on the other
 hand,   has  asserted that his
 supporters in the legislature
 will not approve Karame's cab-
 inet.
 Shihab has threatened to
 dissolve the chamber, which is
 dominated by Chamoun supporters,
 if the cabinet does not win
 support.  Dissolution would re-
 quire Karame-controlled elec-
 tions within three months,  with
 results unfavorable to Chamoun.
 Shihab intends to add 22
 seats to the 66-man legislature
 in order to provide "balanced"
 representation,  and he has in-
 dicated that he would also like
 to obtain decree powers and sus-
 pend the legislature for six
 months.   He then could rule
 without interference from the
 pro-Chamoun Parliament.
 All seven ministers origi-
 nally proposed for membership
 in the Karame cabinet are op-
 posed to Chamoun's pro-Western
 foreign policy, and four sided
 with the rebels against Chamoun
 during the rebellion.
 Militant pro-Chamoun forces
 have adopted the tactics former-
 ly used by the  anti-Chamoun
 rebels by employing violence
 to seek more favorable repre-
 sentation in the cabinet.   The
 reported intention of two anti-
 Chamoun Maronite Christian min-
 isterial candidates to resign
 could open the way for a polit-
 ical compromise and for the ap-
 pointment of pro-Chamoun rep-
 resentatives to the cabinet.
 An outright increase in cabinet
 seats is also being discussed
 as a possible solution,  failing
 which,  the Moslem-Christian
 split will widen.   Shihab appar-
 ently has already embarked on
 a policy of removing or reas-
 signing members of   security
 forces who actively opposed the
 rebellion this summer.
 Syrian Interior Minister
 Sarraj recently told a European
 diplomat in Damascus that "noth-
 ing would stop Lebanon's associa-
 tion with the UAR," and that he

 was prepared to use violence,

 deprive advocates of union with
 the UAR, which just proclaimed
 such reforms in Syria, of a ma-

 if necessary, to accomplish this. j
 Jordan
 Extensive political maneu-
 vering by military and civilian
 leaders in Jordan is continuing.
 New rumors are spreading
 in  Amman  and Jerusalem that
 King Husayn is preparing to bring
 representatives of opposition
 groups,  possibly including the
 National Socialist party, into
 the government,  presumably in
 a bid to avert antigovernment
 violence after British troops
 are withdrawn.   Such  a  move
 could also establish a basis for
 an orderly transition toward a
 policy of accommodation with
 Jordan's Arab neighbors.   In-
 stallation of a neutral govern-
 ment in Jordan could also pre-
 pare the way for the King's de-
 parture for a "vacation and
 medical checkup,"  following
 withdrawal of British troops.
 The UAR-operated "Jorda-
 nian People's Radio," which
 broadcasts from Syria, has con-
 tinued a torrent of unusually
 fierce exhortations to over-
 throw the pro-Western government
 in Jordan.
 Iraq
 Baghdad authorities con-
 tinue cautious maneuvering to
 reduce the influence and pres-
 tige of the faction within the
 government favoring union with
 the UAR.   Premier Qasim has
 further strengthened his posi-
 tion by dismissing pro-UAR Dep-
 uty Premier and Interior Min-
 ister Arif, as well as two otheri
 pro-UAR cabinet members.  Arif
 is being sent to West Germany
 as ambassador.

 reform program  is to be imple-
 Reports from Baghdad re-
 flect the existence of a group
 of senior officers, apparently
 emerging as the actual locus
 of power in Iraq.   This group,
 which includes the four division
 commanders, did not participate
 directly  in  the   14  July
 revolt.
 Arif's former brigade has
 been sent on a security mission
 to southern Iraq, and elements
 of Qasim's brigade may also have
 been withdrawn from Baghdad.
 These moves may be intended to
 reduce  the possibility  of a
 countercoup by  politically
 oriented units in the capital.
 Middle East Oil
 Nasir's expected attempt
 to gain ultimate control over
 the terms under which Western
 oil interests operate in the
 Arab states has apparently be-
 gun.                                                        His establishment of a
 Public Corporation for Petro-
 leum Affairs to plan UAR petro-
 leum policy will assure Cairo
 of control in all details over
 Syrian oil matters.   Cairo has
 already stymied Syrian negotia-

 (Tapline)  operating the pipe-
 line from Saudi Arabia--a~ move
 presumably intended to shift
 decisive negotiations to Cairo.

 may well emerge as the instru-

 over-all Arab oil policy toward
 Western oil companies.
 A spokesman for the Egyp-

 that Kuwait, the Middle East's
 largest oil producer, had ap-
 plied for membership, and that
 the league's secretary general

 and Qatar.
 According to the  Cairo
 press, Kuwait's deputy  ruler
 declared in Cairo on 24 Septem-
 ber that Kuwait was prepared to
 join the league and contribute
 to an Arab development bank.
 Britain is empowered by treaty
 and custom to handle Kuwait's
 foreign relations, but in Arab
 affairs the Ruler, who feels
 that accommodation with Nasir
 is necessary, has recently as-
 sumed an increasingly independ-
 ent position.
 The Foreign Office in Lon-
 don has stated that it was not
 consulted on the deputy ruler's
 move.   The Kuwaiti Government
 secretariat has also denied that
 Kuwait would join the league.
 The denial, however, suggests
 that the powerful deputy ruler
 may be attempting to cultivate
 favor with Nasir and with the
 Kuwaiti nationalists at the ex-
 pense of the Ruler, who is tied
 to treaty relations with Brit-
 ain.

 Nasir's Reorganization Plan
 Nasir is expected to re-
 veal soon the details of his
 plan to centralize the govern-
 ment of the United Arab Repub-
 lic, giving Egypt greater con-
 trol over Syria.   His choice
 of personnel is not yet known,
 but it appears certain that
 several prominent officials,
 including Vice Presidents
 Hawrani, Asali, and Baghdadi,
 will be dropped   because of
 their past disagreements with
 Nasir's policies.  Syrian strong
 man Sarraj, at present minister
 of interior for the Syrian re-
 gion, has been mentioned  as
 Nasir's choice to head a new
 "executive council" for that
 region, with the task of im-
 plementing Cairo's policies.
 Preliminary steps have al-
 ready been taken.   Nasir has
 promulgated a state-of-emergency
 decree, announced a land-reform
 program for Syria, abolished
 the extralegal status of Syrian
 tribes, and is reported to be
 transferring numerous Syrian
 military personnel to duty in

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 BRITISH.PUT CYPRUS PLAN INTO EFFECT
 Despite the fact that Brit-
 ain started on 1 October to im-
 plement its Cyprus plan, NATO
 Secretary General Spaak is still
 trying  to  persuade  Britain,
 Greece, and Turkey to confer
 about the island and head off
 a major crisis to the alliance.
 Greece considers any con-
 ference useless now in view of
 Britain's start in implementing
 its Cyprus plan.   Athens is
 still re-examining its ties
 with the West.   The cabinet,
 however, apparently has reject-
 ed, at least for the present,
 :Foreign Minister Averoff's
 recommendation that Greece
 break relations with Turkey, de-
 nounce the Balkan Pact, and with-
 draw from NATO.   Averoff may re-
 sign over this rebuff to his
 policies--a move which would
 probably precipitate a new cri-
 sis in the Greek Government.
 The developing political situ-
 ation in Greece has caused King
 Paul to interrupt his vacation
 in Austria and hurry back to
 Athens.
 On Cyprus, the first of Oc-
 tober and the prior announcement
 of the appointment of the Turkish
 consul general in Nicosia as the
 official Turkish representative
 to the governor of Cyprus were
 celebrated by Turkish Cypriots,
 but Greek Cypriots called a gen-
 eral strike which brought vir-
 tually all activity on the-is-
 land to a halt.   Meanwhile,
 sporadic attacks on British de-
 pendents, ambushes of British
 troops, and island-wide sabotage
 occurred with increasing fre-
 quency.   While the Predicted 1
 October "all-out offensive" by
 EOKA did not materialize, British
 officials continue to predict
 that a major campaign of violence
 will occur but may not be  n for
 another two weeks.
 France's overwhelming ap-
 proval of De Gaulle's constitu-
 tion will probably encourage
 the premier to seek an early
 solution to the Algerian prob-
 lem, even at the risk of alien-
 ating his rightist and perhaps
 some of his military supporters.
 The forthcoming electoral re-
 form will be aimed at reducing
 Communist representation in the
 National Assembly, but there
 is some fear it may also favor
 the right at the expense of
 the center parties.
 Under pressure of a public
 mandate to bring peace to Al-
 geria, De Gaulle must now main-
 tain the momentum of a drive
 for an early solution within
 the framework of his promise
 in June to negotiate with the
 elected representative of the
 Algerian people.   His immediate

 aim, therefore, is to indicate
 the broad lines of the solution
 he favors, so that extremists
 on both sides will not be dis-
 illusioned too abruptly.   In
 view of the almost unanimously
 favorable referendum vote in
 Algeria, De Gaulle may be in no
 hurry to assuage FLN sensibili-
 ties, but his unwillingness to
 support the integration theme
 runs the danger of further ex-
 citing irreconcilable elements
 among the settlers and army.
 The Algerian solution De
 Gaulle envisages will have a
 direct bearing on the electoral
 law under which the new assem-
 bly will be chosen in November.
 He would like to reduce Commu-
 nist strength  to perhaps  30
 deputies, compared with 150 at
 present.   The fear has been ex-
 pressed, however, that this
 could be achieved only at the
 cost of a heavily rightist ori-
 entation of the assembly, which
 would sharply reduce the possi-
 bility of a liberal solution in
 Algeria.  Moreover, such a dis-
 tribution of assembly strength
 would play  into the  hands of
 the Communist party by forcing
 other leftist deputies to align
 themselves in a single bloc with
 the Communists.   If De Gaulle is
 to avoid eventual capitulation
 to the right, he will therefore
 have to consider an electoral
 law which would foster a respon-
 sible left and center.
 De Gaulle has long been
 disinclined to take measures to
 outlaw the Communist party, as
 Soustelle and other rightists
 have demanded publicly.   He
 believes that Communist electoral
 strength--averaging a quarter of
 the electorate under the 1946
 constitution--has been essen-
 tially a protest vote against
 the old system and this convic-
 tion has been reinforced by the
 party's inability to muster all
 its former supporters to oppose
 the constitution.   Instead of
 trying to  reduce   Communist
 strength solely by electoral de-
 vices, De Gaulle will probably
 offer a program of socio-eco-
 nomic reforms to lure the pro-
 test  vote away from the Commu-
 nists.
 FRENCH WEST
 The secession of Guinea
 and the reported intention of
 the rich Ivory Coast, and per-
 haps also of Mauritania, vir-
 tually to cut their ties with
 the Federation of French West
 Africa are likely to destroy
 the federation's ability   to
 function effectively.
 French West Africa--a fed-
 eration of eight territories
 with a total population of over
 19,000,000 diverse peoples--
 covers almost 2,000,000 square
 miles of desert, steppes, and
 jungle.   Only since 1946 has
 the federation,  centered at
 Dakar, had real administrative
 significance.
 Recently many African na-
 tionalists have sought to en-
 hance the powers of the federal
 government as a means of gain-
 ing greater independence from
 France, but representatives of
 at least two territories--the
 agriculturally rich Ivory Coast
 and the backward,   predominate-
 ly Caucasian Mauritania--have
 opposed Dakar's growing   power
 and have  demanded  stronger
 individual  ties  With France.
 The  Ivory  Coast   is expected
 to break  its ties with Dakar
 soon and  to take measures to
 halt the      flow of its tax
 money  for use by  the federa-
 tion's                                                                      poorer  territories.

 Most French West African
 leaders urged their followers
 to vote yes in the constitution-
 al referendum in order to assure
 the continuation of French eco-
 nomic development funds.   At the
 same time, they expect to take
 advantage of the constitution's
 provisions permitting a later
 request for independence.   In
 contrast, Premier Sekou Toure
 of Guinea received the support
 of about 98 percent of the Guin-
 ea electorate when he urged a
 vote for immediate independence.
 Toure has frequently indi-
 cated his desire to retain close
 ties with France after gaining
 independence, and hopes to re-
 main within the franc

 with the French com-
 munity provided for
 by the new constitu-

 ised no "great  up-

 and economic struc-
 tures, since Guinea,
 which is rich in min-

 needs assistance for
 economic development.

 a firmer pro-Algerian line, how-
 ever, in view of Khrushchev's
 recent strong attack on the De
 Gaulle government's policies,
 including its failure to end
 the "iniquitous colonial war
 against the Algerian people."
 N. A. Mukhitdinov, a top
 Soviet spokesman on Middle East-
 ern and Arab affairs, had two
 "frank and sincere" meetings
 with "ministers" of the Algerian
 provisional government during
 his recent visit to the UAR.
 The heavy publicity given by
 Moscow to these meetings--the
 first such high-level Soviet
 contact with the rebels--is de-
 signed to impress Afro-Asian
 opinion with its sympathy for
 the new regime.   Soviet leaders
 may be deferring a decision on
 the question of recognition,
 however, pending receipt of
 Mukhitdinov's report on the
 prospects of the new government
 and an assessment of De Gaulle's
 policies following the consti-
 tutional referendum.
 The European satellites
 will probably follow Moscow's
 lead, although East Germany,
 which does not have diplomatic
 relations with France, might
 undertake recognition in advance
 of the other Communist regimes
 in Europe.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA
 Communist China this year
 is seeking greater economic ad-

 now that it has begun to achieve
 its earlier objective in this
 trade--enhanced political status
 in the area. Peiping established
 ticularly Morocco and Tunisia--
 for its own efforts to win in-
 creased foreign recognition.
 North Korea and North Vietnam,
 which quickly followed Peiping's
 lead, have found it very diffi-
 cult to gain international ac-
 ceptability.   Hanoi's relations
 outside the bloc are limited to
 a few consulates,while Pyongyang
 has never received even de facto
 recognition from the most strin-
 gently neutral countries.   Al-
 though neither North Vietnam
 nor North Korea is represented
 in the United Nations, both try
 hard to identify themselves with
 the Asian-African bloc, and
 recognition of the Algerians
 is a logical extension of this
 policy.
 Peiping's move undoubtedly
 reflects its impatience with
 Paris, which, despite sporadic
 signs of interest, has neverthe-
 less refused to take actual steps
 to establish diplomatic exchanges.
 The risk of offending France
 thus has little meaning for Pei-

 The Sino-Soviet bloc is
 conducting an apparently well-

 In this attack, definite limits
 appear to have been set.   Bloc
 countries are not to sever re-

 blame for any diplomatic rup-
 ture must clearly fall on Yugo-

 bloc is attacking Yugoslavia
 on specific issues which each
 has determined would be most
 embarrassing.   Moscow probably
 feels that a return to the
 heavy-handed approach Stalin
 adopted after 1948 would only
 increase international sympathy
 for Tito and permit him to re-
 taliate in a manner embarrass-
 ing to Khrushchev's interna-
 tional position.
 The pyrotechnics charac-
 teristic of the anti-Yugoslav
 campaign last spring have sub-
 sided, and ideological argumen-
 tation, previously the primary
 element in the dispute, now
 plays a role secondary to spe-

 selves to propaganda assaults,
 except for Poland which has re-

 The USSR, in what-is prob-

 now to have reversed its earlier
 decision to withold its wheat
 shipment, hoping thereby to
 discredit insistent Yugoslav
 arguments that economic rela-
 tions with the USSR are corre-
 lated with political compati-
 bility and to undermine Bel-
 grade's position in its economic
 talks with the United States.
 Such economic harassment will
 probably continue, and the bloc
 can be expected to take an
 equivocal position on the de-
 livery of vital commodities to
 Yugoslavia.   Khrushchev has
 stated, however, that trade
 will continue when mutually
 advantageous.

 As more and more elements
 of Yugoslav public life have
 become involved in the polemics,-
 the sensitive question of Yugo-
 slavia's policy toward its Al-
 banian and Macedonian minori-
 ties has  arisen again.  Tirana
 and Sofia have become exceed-
 ingly vituperative on the sub-
 ject, and the Yugoslavs have
 publicly accused both of "openly
 expressing aspirations to some
 territories of our country."
 The Yugoslavs have main-
 tained a fairly calm and re-
 strained attitude throughout
 the campaign, but have--when
 they considered it necessary--
 stubbornly defended their
 position.   For the present, Tito's
 objective apparently is to prove
 to the world that Moscow is
 carrying the fight to extremes
 by interfering in the internal
 affairs of Yugoslavia, attempt-
 ing to discredit his policies,
 and  seeking  to  separate
 him  from  his    people.  Whether

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 USSR DISCLOSES LARGE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
 The Soviet delegation to
 the Second International Confer-
 ence on the Peaceful  Uses of
 Atomic Energy at Geneva  an-
 nounced-that a nuclear electric-
 power plant is in operation at
 an undisclosed location in Si-.-
 beria. The announcement stated
 that the power plant, now oper-
 ating at a power level of 100,-
 000 electrical kilowatts, was to
 be expanded to a total capacity
 of 600,000 kilowatts,   which
 would make it the largest in
 the world.
 The plant may be located
 at the large atomic energy com-
 plex just north of Tomsk, where
 what appeared to be dual-purpose
 reactors and associated power-
 generating facilities were ob-
 served under construction in
 1957.   Some or all of the elec-
 tric power generated may be con-
 sumed by the gaseous-diffusion
 plant being expanded at this
 highly secret nuclear-energy
 complex.
 This plant was not specifi-
 cally mentioned among those
 which, according to the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan, would make up
 most of the 2,000,000-'to 2,500,,-
 000-kilowatt nuclear-power plant
 capacity scheduled to be in op-
 eration by 1960.   Present indi-
 cations are that the installed
 capacity of stations specifi-
 cally designed for power produc-
 tion will not exceed 700 mega-
 watts by that time.   It is be-
 lieved that the lag in the con-
 struction program of these plants
 prompted the USSR to publicize
 this dual-purpose reactor, and
 that it considers the propaganda
 advantages sufficient to out-
 weigh the possible security
 hazards involved.
 Only one of the large nu-
 clear-power plants scheduled
 under the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 was reported by V. S. Yemelyanov,
 chief of the Main Administra-
 tion for Peaceful Uses of Atomic
 Energy, to be under construction--

 that 29 had diverted some 428,-

 EAST GERMANS MAY EASE DOMESTIC POLICIES
 The East German regime,              cultural and economic policies
 disturbed by the mass flights
 of intellectuals, professional
 personnel, and technicians to
 the West and by other signs of
 increasing popular dissatisfac-

 ed at the fifth congress of the
 East German Communist party in
 July.   A party plenum scheduled
 for mid-October may decide on
 a new approach intended to slow
 the exodus and to encourage
 greater productivity.
 In following a less rigid
 course, the Ulbricht regime
 would in part be adopting the
 moderate program advocated by
 the purged Schirdewan and Oels-
 sner and by Fritz Selbmann,
 whose opposition to Ulbricht
 cost him his central committee
 seat and, quite recently, his
 post as deputy premier.   Selb-
 mann remains a deputy planning
 commissioner., however, and may
 yet have a hand in carrying
 out a more liberal economic
 program.
 The recent concession to
 physicians and an easement of
 hinted at by regime leaders at
 a recent central committee meet-
 ing suggest that a relaxation
 is in the offing.   The decree
 affecting the status of physi-
 cians stated that the "apoliti-

 East Germany, suggesting that
 the replacement of industrial
 specialists by party hacks dur-
 ing the current reorganization
 of the economic admistrative
 structure will cease.   The ranks
 of specialists and technicians
 have been the hardest hit of all
 manpower categories by the
 flights to the West, and East
 German manpower reserves are
 almost exhausted.

 PRE-ELECTION DEVELOPMENTS IN PAKISTAN
 The success of Pakistan's
 ruling parties in dealing with
 political disturbances in East
 and West Pakistan fomented by
 the opposition has apparently
 strengthened the national gov-
 ernment's position.   It should
 lso reduce the possibility of
 authoritarian moves to suspend
 parliamentary government or to
 curtail political party activ-
 ity.   These developments should
 clear the way for holding the
 country's first national elec-
 tions as expected in February,
 although the government's sin-
 cerity in this respect is still
 open to question.
 In East Pakistan, sessions
 of the provincial assembly on
 20 and 23 September ended in
 violent clashes and the arrest
 of 12 opposition members.  The
 deputy speaker later died of
 injuries.   While the ruling
 Awami League members appear' to
 have shared responsibility for
 the disorders, the opposition
 politicians probably sparked
 the violence in an attempt to
 force the national government
 to impose President's Rule and

 COMMUNIST WEAKNESSES APPEAR IN INDIA'S KERALA STATE
 Attention in India now is
 becoming focused on the failure
 of Kerala's Communist-controlled
 government during 18 months in
 power to make any progress in
 solving the state's basic eco-
 nomic problems.
 Prior to July, the Commu-
 nists had appeared to be firmly
 entrenched in Kerala.  In July,
 however, violent Communist at-
 tacks on student and labor agi-
 tators resulted in several
 deaths,  producing widespread
 fear that the government would
 not maintain law and order ex-
 cept in favor of the Communists.
 Popular indignation in
 India reached such a pitch that
 the Kerala government finally
 granted all student demands,
 thus suffering its first major
 defeat since it took office in
 April 1957.   Additional pub-
 licity regarding the possibility
 of an investigation by New Delhi
 has put the state government on
 the defensive and made it neces-
 sary for Communists in other
 states to abandon attacks on
 New Delhi and spring to the de-
 f ense of the Kerala regime.
 More significant,  however,
 is the fact that public atten-
 tion is turning from immediate
 incidents to longer range ap-
 praisals which are bringing to
 light the Communists' failure
 to keep pace with other states
 over.   Kerala ministers have un-
 successfully toured India and
 foreign countries attempting to
 attract private capital and as-
 sure Kerala's achievement of its
 Second Five-Year Plan targets.
 Preliminary negotiations with
 Indian industrial interests for
 establishing a rayon pulp factory
 in Kerala have produced much
 adverse publicity for the Com-
 munist government, whose tenta-
 tive agreement to assist the
 project and to give management
 considerable control over factory

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 General Ne Win's military
 take-over in Burma on 26 Sep-
 tember, welcomed by all but the
 Communists and the crypto-Com-

 the country's drift toward po-
 litical violence and chaos.
 Government authorities in Ran-

 "coup," that the full cabinet
 approved the move, and that
 Premier Nu "invited" Ne Win to
 Strongly anti-Communist
 General Ne Win can expect nearly
 unanimous support from the feud-
 ing factions of the Anti-Fascist
 People's Freedom League (AFPFL)
 when he is nominated in Parlia-
 ment on 28 October as interim
 premier.   He is pledged to give
 the country six months of non-
 partisan government and to sup-
 ervise national elections next
 April.  The rival leaders of the
 factions of 'the AFPFL--U Nu on
 the one hand and Ba Swe and Kyaw
 Nyein on the other--will have
 an opportunity for a reconcilia-
 tion under conditions involving
 a minimum loss of prestige to
 either side.
 Members of the Communist
 People's Comrade party have
 left Rangoon and returned to
 the jungle.   This group, con-
 sidered the best disciplined of
 the Communist-front organiza-
 tions, has maintained close
 liaison with the Burma Communist
 party of Than Tun.   Presumably,
 it now will resume its guerrilla
 warfare with weapons known to
 have been cached in the jungle
 as its members surrendered dur-
 ing recent months.                                                               The crypto-
 Communists of the National United
 Front, who have supported Nu
 since June, have denounced the
 government move, charging that
 Ne Win has been made a tool of
 right-wing reactionaries.
 Ne Win, apparently prompted
 by Home Ministry plans to con-
 vert the army into a government
 party instrument through arrest
 or retirement of its top lead-
 ers, delivered an ultimatum to
 U Nu on 23 September.   Although
 this demand was backed by the
 armed forces surrounding Rangoon,
 Nu appears to have accepted the
 move as a much-needed reprieve.
 His gamble to continue control
 with Communist support was fail-
 ing, he appeared to have lost
 his parliamentary majority, and
 the prospects were for inconclu-
 sive returns and large Communist
 gains in the projected November
 national elections.
 The AFPFL faction of Ba
 Swe and Kyaw Nyein is favored
 by the development.   Under the
 heavy and clumsy hand of Home
 Minister Bo Min Gaung,  its mem-
 bers had been persecuted and
 could have expected increasingly
 severe repression as the elec-
 tion date   approached.   Now
 government   pressures have        25X1
 been  halted  and  the faction's
 prospects for  election  gains
 have  much   improved,

 The lack of progress by
 Singapore's moderate parties
 toward developing an. effective
 political coalition during more
 than a year of negotiations
 points'up the growing Communist
 threat as this British colony
 approaches internal self-govern-
 ment next year.  Formation of
 the United Socialist Front (USF),
 proposed by Chief Minister Lim
 Yew Hock in June, has again been
 postponed several times.  Even
 if formed in the near future,
 there seems to be little chance
 that the USF, or any other mod-
 erate coalition, can develop in
 time to compete effectively with
 the Communist-influenced Peo-
 ple's Action party (PAP)  in the
 Legislative Assembly elections
 which are to precede self-rule.
 The party's strength appears un-
 diminished since its candidates
 won 13 of the 14 seats it con-
 tested in last December's city
 council election and since,
 more recently, it won a by-elec-
 tion against united moderate
 opposition.
 The Singapore government's
 chief legal weapon against Com-
 munist subversion,  the Preser-
 vation of Public Security Ordi-
 nance (PPSO), will probably be
 extended by the Legislative As-
 sembly prior to its expiration
 this month.   While the PPSO has
 been an effective weapon under
 Chief Minister Lim's strongly
 anti-Communist government, a
 PAP victory in the elections
 next year would put leftists in
 a position to set aside the law
 and obtain the release of key
 leftist leaders now imprisoned
 under the law's detention clause.
 These leftists could then rejoin
 the PAP with the prospect of
 achieving early Communist con-
 trol over the party, now "moder-
 ately" led.  Thus, the Communist
 position in the PAP and the like-
 lihood of a PAP election victory
 next year increase the Commu-
 nists' chances of controlling
 the new government of the state
 of Singapore.
 Communist domination of the
 PAP, and through it the govern-
 ment, might still lead to the
 appearance of a moderate govern-
 ment in Singapore, however, for
 the Communists presumably would
 wish to avoid any provocation
 which would cause the British
 to use their reserve powers to
 rescind the constitution.   Fur-
 thermore,  the Communists know
 their hope of an eventual merger
 of Singapore and the Federation
 of Malaya can be realized only   25X1
 by allaying Malayan fears of an
 extreme left-wing government in
 Singapore.
 The inauguration this month
 of the first international pe-
 troleum pipeline in South Amer-
 ica,                   from Sicasica in Boliva to
 Chile's Pacific port of Arica,
 will provide. a new impetus to
 Bolivian petroleum development.
 The capacity of the new pipe-
 line is 50,000 barrels a day,
 an indication of the great in-
 crease contemplated for Boliv-
 ian production.   Present pro-
 duction,  however,  cannot provide
 a steady flow, even at the ini-
 tially planned rate of 7,000
 barrels a day.  Exploitation by
 the Bolivian Government amounted
 to only 2,000 barrels a day in
 1952, but it jumped nearly 300
 percent   by   1954  and  almost
 equaled local demand.   Steady
 increases since then have pro-
 vided about 5 percent of the
 country's export earnings.

 Bolivia's successful ef-
 forts to become a net exporter
 of oil increased its. awareness
 of the costs of oil development,
 and in 1955 the government pro-
 mulgatbd a new oil
 code that attracted
 substantial invest-
 ment  by  American
 companies, as well
 as  by  Royal Dutch
 Shell.  These com-
 panies have complet-
 ed considerable geo-
 logical exploration
 and seismic work, but
 production  still
 comes exclusively
 from  the  national
 company, which in-
 creased its produc-
 tion only 12 percent
 in 1957, basically
 because of the ab-
 sence of adequate
 transportation from
 the fields to ports.
 The Bolivian-
 Brazilian impasse
 over the development
 of  promising  oil
 land in eastern Bo-
 livia has been over-
 come,   and  several
 private Brazilian
 companies have taken
 initial  steps to
 meet the requirement
 of beginning operations in Bra-
 zil's  sector  before  Septem-
 ber 1959.                  All land not under
 concession by that date will
 revert  to  Bolivian control.
 Because of its acute financial
 crisis, Bolivia has been inter-
 ested in granting the land to
 foreign concessionaires, who
 would not only bear the produc-
 tion costs but also pay royal-
 ties and provide foreign ex-
 change.
 Leftist forces are threat-
 ening this source of new foreign
 exchange earnings with a con-
 gressional amendment to Boliv-
 ia's oil code.  Leftist labor
 leader Juan Lechin, President
 Siles' chief political rival,
 has proposed an amendment pro-
 viding for ratification of cer-
 tain oil contracts by Bolivia's
 erratic and frequently leftist-
 inclined Congress.   Such a
 change would be likely to have
 an unfavorable effect on the
 development plans of foreign
 companies now operating in Bo-
 livia, as well as on prospec-
 tive investors.

 An adjustment of Austria's
 pro-Western foreign policy has
 become apparent since Chancel-
 lor Raab's visit to Moscow last
 July.   Vienna's ties with the
 West basically are still strong,
 but a continuation of this trend
 may make uncertain Vienna's sup-
 port on major East-West issues.
 Austria's intention to
 pursue a "balanced" policy has
 been evidenced in various ways
 in recent weeks--including ab-
 stention in the UN vote on the
 Chinese moratorium issue. Vienna
 is still maintaining most of
 the restrictions placed on Amer-
 ican overflights during the Mid-
 dle Eastern crisis, and pros-
 pects are fora much less lenient
 policy than heretofore.   By con-
 trast, Austria is trying to im-
 prove relations with Prague and
 has hesitated to take a strong
 stand with the Kadar regime in
 Hungary over serious border
 provocations.   There has also
 been a sharp increase in offi-
 cial visits between Austria and
 the bloc--Defense Minister Graf
 is expected to leave for a week's
 visit to Moscow on 4 October.
 Various factors are in-
 svolved in these developments.
 Many Austrians, including Chan-
 cellor Raab, think of Vienna as
 a central European capital and

 plans to seek early UN consid-

 ently in the belief that polit-
 ical decisions must be made
 of Austria as a potential medi-
 ator in East-West affairs.   Com-
 petition between the Socialists
 and the People's party in the
 coalition government has made
 the chancellor particularly anx-
 ious to score successes in nego-
 tiations with the bloc.   Other
 Austrians, from a feeling of in-
 security, want to pattern Aus-
 tria's neutrality after that
 of Sweden or Switzerland, or
 even to equate Austria's inter-
 national status with that of
 Finland.
 A "policy of no principles,"
 however,  does not appeal to many
 Austrians, and, with  elections
 in prospect next year, Raab may
 hesitate to expose himself to
 Socialist charges of too cordial
 a relationship with the Kremlin.
 Austrian politicians in the past
 have been disillusioned by de-
 velopments in the bloc.

 THE COMMON MARKET AND THE FREE TRADE AREA
 The meeting of the Council
 of the European Common Market
 (EEC) in Venice from 18 to 20
 September appears to have dimmed
 considerably the prospects for
 an early conclusion of the nego-
 tiations on the free trade area
 (FTA).   Although progress was
 made toward the objective of a
 joint policy toward the free
 trade project, the six EEC mem-
 bers--France, Italy, West Ger-
 many,.and the Benelux countries
 --are still some distance from
 that goal.   Both in timing and
 substance there appears to have
 been a general retreat  from
 more negotiable positions taken
 earlier this year.

 to be completed in three to six

 for excluding from the FTA or

 not be easy to agree on the

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 UAR President Nasir, seek-
 ing to expand his influence in
 the Middle East and Africa,  is
 faced with problems which may
 severely test his leadership.
 Divisive forces in the Cairo
 regime and within the UAR, an
 independent attitude on the
 part of Iraq, and possible new
 alignments within the Arab
 League are all potential sources
 of difficulty.   Although he con-
 tinues to depend heavily on
 Soviet economic and military
 aid,  he is concerned over the
 USSR's backing of Middle Eastern
 Communists and over activities of
 UAR elements in Iraq
 and Syria.   Nasir's
 attitude of suspicion
 and his uncompromis-
 ing actions toward
 the West show little
 sign that he will try
 to better relations.
 Nasir  has  become
 deeply  committed
 through propaganda
 and subversive ac-
 tivities to an ex-
 pansion of UAR in-
 fluence throughout
 the Middle East and
 Africa, and he would
 probably be unable to
 withdraw without
 risking loss of sup-
 port at home,  since
 SECRET
 Egypt's stagnating economy and
 restrictions on individual free-
 dom are continuing causes of
 public discontent.   Nasir has
 indicated dissatisfaction with
 his subordinates' handling of
 domestic problems, and the re-
 ported plan for reorganization
 of the UAR Government is likely
 to include measures designed to
 provide scapegoats and give the
 appearance of positive steps
 toward improving unsatisfactory
 conditions.
 Trouble within the regime's
 inner circle has been widely re-
 ported.   Able Egyptian
 Vice President for
 Economic Affairs Abd
 al-Latif Baghdadi is
 slated for removal,
 and rumors are grow-
 ing of the pending
 dismissal of Nasir's
 heretofore closest
 .adviser,  All Sabri.
 Past differences in-
 volving key figures
 in the regime have
 been settled rela-
 tively smoothly, how-
 ever, and the present
 difficulties will
 probably be handled
 in the same fashion.
 Rumors of these dis-
 putes nevertheless
 it is primarily the appearance
 of dynamism which sustains his
 regime.
 In Egypt,  Nasir has never
 been free from concern over his
 regime's stability,  but judi-
 cious placement of personnel in
 lucrative or influential posi-
 tions and the maintenance of
 extreme security precautions
 have stifled individual and
 group opposition.   The forma-
 tion of any potentially suc-
 cessful opposition in the near
 future appears unlikely,  but
 reach the public and increase
 popular distrust of the regime's
 motives and activities.
 After the first surge of
 enthusiasm,  the process of merg-
 ing Egypt and Syria into a
 United Arab Republic slowed down
 markedly.   The reality of Egyp-
 tian dominance instead of the
 hoped-for goal of equal partner-
 ship has not been well received
 in Syria.   Although Nasir's per-
 sonal popularity does not appear
 to have suffered appreciably,
 Cairo's efforts to suppress some
 of the individualistic tendencies
 of the Syrians have met resistance,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 2 .October 1958
 Syrian  politicians  and
 businessmen appear particularly
 disillusioned by Nasir's at-
 tempts to curb party activities
 and to regulate the free Syrian
 economy.   Syria's outstanding
 political figure before the
 union, Akram Hawrani, has re-
 portedly alienated Nasir by
 his independent behavior.   He
 may lose his vice presidency
 and perhaps all real authority
 if Nasir effects his govern-
 ment reorganization plan, which
 would centralize control in
 Cairo over both the Syrian and
 Egyptian regions.
 Syria's reaction to a pro-
 gram  patently  designed  to
 tighten Cairo's control of
 Syrian affairs is likely to be
 an intensification of the re-
 sentment already prevalent
 there.   The compulsory land re-
 form program recently announced
 may well mitigate the resent-
 ment of the public, even though
 it antagonizes large landhold-
 ers who stand to lose both eco-
 nomic and political influence.
 Another problem facing Na-
 sir,                    which also involves Syria,
 is the independent spirit being
 shown by the new leaders of
 Iraq.   The natural affinity be-
 tween Syria and Iraq,  based on
 geographic,  economic, and cul-
 tural factors, may be accentuat-
 ed by Syrian dissatisfaction
 with union and the possibility
 that Iraqi leaders may attempt
 to challenge Nasir's pre-emi-
 nence in the Arab world.   Egyp-
 tian efforts to rush Iraq into
 formal union or federation with
 the UAR have been at least
 temporarily parried.   Iraq's
 ardently pro-UAR deputy premier
 Abd al-Salaam Arif,  appears to
 have been stripped of much of
 his authority by Premier Qasim,
 who is showing extreme caution
 on the question of union and is
 assuming a more individualis-
 tic,nationalistic role.
 Egyptians believe that the
 Iraqi Communists,  fearing that
 a growth in Nasir's influence
 would result in their suppres-
 sion as in Syria and Egypt,
 have done much to retard a move-
 ment toward union.   Nasir has
 said he complained to Soviet
 party presidium member Mukhit-
 dinov,  during the latter's re-
 cent nine-day visit to Cairo,
 about Soviet backing of Commu-
 nist activity in the area,
 especially in Iraq.
 The role of Iraq in the
 recent accession of Morocco
 and Tunis to the Arab League
 immediately following the visit
 of Iraqi Foreign Minister Jumard
 to each country is not clear.
 There is evidence,  however,  that
 Iraq may hope to form a bloc to
 counter UAR influence and change
 the league from an Egyptian in-
 strument to a more nearly rep-
 resentative Arab body.                                                                           The
 Cairo meeting of the league be-
 ginning on 1 October may pro-
 vide some indication of whether
 or not Nasir will continue to
 dominate the organization.   The
 future role in the league of
 oil-rich Kuwait,  which has re-
 cently indicated its intent to
 join, may prove important on
 this question.
 The apparent,  if not always
 real, success of Nasir's for-
 eign ventures has been the main-
 stay of his regime.   "Victories"
 in the name of Arab nationalism
 and anti-imperialism have fore-
 stalled internal opposition by
 diverting public attention from
 the regime's failure to cope
 with basic problems at home.
 Nasir's appreciation of the ef-
 fectiveness of such a policy
 will probably compel him to con-
 tinue intrigues abroad.
 Nasir continues publicly
 to use opposition to "Western
 imperialism" as a popular rally-
 ing point,  despite private as-
 surances that he desires friend-
 ship with the West.   He has main-
 tained a steady attack on Amer-
 ican and British intervention
 in Lebanon and Jordan,  and has

 subversive activities which
 helped precipitate the crises
 in those countries.   The pos-
 sibility of a rapprochement
 with the British was set back
 by Nasir's refusal to ease his
 demands in the UK-UAR financial
 discussions in  Rome early in
 September.   He now appears to
 be planning to put pressure on
 the West by assuming a stronger
 role in determining Arab oil
 policy.   As a first step he has
 made an impossible demand for
 higher revenues from the Tapline

 constant percentage gains from
 a growing base.
 The individual output goals
 revealed thus far for 1965 and
 the broader objectives of the
 forthcoming Seven-Year Plan
 (1959-1965), suggest no letup
 in the continuing Soviet ambi-
 tion to catch up with the West
 in the shortest possible time.
 Industrial growth goals during
 the period of the Seven-Year
 Plan--to be discussed at the
 21st party congress in January
 --probably will be maintained
 at rates nearly as high as those
 achieved during the past two
 years.   Those rates, although
 lower than those of the Fifth
 Five-Year Plan (1951-55), were
 still considerably higher than
 level soon.   Limited changes in
 industrial administration and
 increased use of incentives were
 expected to give another boost
 to industry.   However, during
 those years faulty coordination
 of plans for new plant capacity
 with plans for increases in the
 output of raw-material industries
 led to a severe shortage of in-
 dustrial raw materials during
 1956.
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan
 (1956-60), which relied on mod-

 the eastern areas to solve the
 productivity and raw-material
 problem, proved inadequate to
 cope with the emergency.  The

 plan, cut back industrial out-
 put goals for 1957 and subse-
 quently for 1958, and ordered
 the formulation of a seven-year
 plan.   It also launched a re-
 medial investment program in
 raw-material industries, while
 maintaining ambitious programs
 in agriculture and housing, and
 in July 1957 instituted a sweep-
 ing reorganization of the in-
 dustrial administrative struc-
 ture.
 The industrial reorganiza-
 tion was intended to achieve a
 more efficient management of the
 economy by reducing the amount
 of detail planned in Moscow and
 thereby giving greater opportu-
 nity for local initiative.
 The revised industrial out-
 put goals, calling for increases
 of'only 7 and 7.5 percent in
 1957 and 1958,  proved unneces-
 sarily low, since actual growth
 was reported to be 10 percent
 in 1957 and 10.5 percent at mid-
 year 1958.   Nevertheless,  the
 performance of some basic ma-
 terials industries,  particular-
 ly those producing ferrous met-
 als, remained poor. Production
 capacity additions in these in-
 dustries fell considerably short
 of goals in 1957 and will be
 inadequate in 1958 as well.
 Production goals for 1965 in
 the basic materials industries
 suggest that priority treatment
 for these industries will have
 to be continued.
 There will probably be no
 increase in   the   industrial
 growth rate above the 10-per-
 cent level of the past two
 years, since this would require
 a substantial overfulfillment
 of production goals in the basic
 materials industries.   An an-
 nual rate of 8 to 10 percent
 over the next seven years is
 more likely.   In ferrous met-
 allurgy the present investment
 plan is likely to produce an
 average annual growth rate of
 only some 6 percent during the
 next seven years.   Even if re-
 sources devoted to this indus-
 try were increased,  it is un-
 likely that the growth of steel
 output could approach the aver-
 age annual rate of 9.5 percent
 achieved during the past seven
 years.
 The slower growth of steel
 output will in turn limit the
 growth of machinery output at a
 time when the slower increase
 of the labor force is heighten-
 ing the demand for labor-saving
 machinery.   The construction
 portion of investment is not
 subject to the same raw materials
 constraints as machinery and
 equipment, but industrial  con-
 struction growth is restricted
 by the availability of equipment
 and manpower for use in new fac-
 tories.
 In order to assure suf-
 ficient industrial manpower to
 maintain projected industrial
 growth rates, substantial trans-
 fers of labor from agriculture
 to industry will be required,
 since the total increase in the
 labor force over the next seven
 years will be approximately
 3,000,000 men fewer than during
 the past seven years.   The hous-
 ing program promises to provide
 continuing improvement in the
 well-being of the labor force
 and will facilitate the transfer
 of workers from agriculture to
 industry, but present ambitious
 agricultural programs will ex-
 ert pressures to hold labor in
 agriculture.
 The reorganization of the
 industrial administrative struc-
 ture, now in existence for a
 year, has not greatly eased the
 regime's problems in removing
 the restraints on future high
 industrial growth rates.   Some
 simplification of decision-mak-
 ing at the center has   been
 achieved,  the role of the party
 has been   strengthened, and Gos-
 plan's influence in planning
 and controlling economic activ-
 ity has been increased.   However,

 forestall any serious erosion
 of central leadership and con-
 trol.                        These actions have pre-
 cluded the freedom of action at
 the local level which would be
 necessary to bring about great-
 er efficiency in the use of re-
 sources.
 Agriculture
 The average annual rate of
 increase  in agricultural pro-
 duction during the next seven
 years will probably be about 3
 percent,  compared with
 the
 7.5-
 percent average annual
 rate
 dur-
 ing the past five years.   There
 are several reasons for this:
 the average annual rate of in-
 crease in sown acreage will be
 only about one fourth that
 achieved in recent years; the
 corn program will not contribute
 to future agricultural output
 on the same scale as in the
 past;  and the new "single-price
 system" may provide less in-
 centive than the previous multi-
 price system.
 Transfer to collective-
 farm control of most of the
 machinery formerly under the
 machine-tractor stations  (MTS)
 may help to increase output,
 as it will eliminate the area
 of conflict between the collec-
 tive farm chairman and the MTS
 director.   The collective farm
 chairman now has a free hand in
 managing the utilization of
 machinery and has the undivided
 use of more skilled labor.   On
 the other Band,  the central or-
 gans continue to determine pro-
 curement goals, and there are
 few indications that the enter-
 prise manager is exercising a
 significant choice in what and
 how much he will produce.
 State control over agri-
 cultural activities apparently
 will not be weakened by recent
 organizational changes,  as po-
 litical functions of the former
 MTS's are being shifted to other
 organizations.
 The Soviet leaders, with
 an eye to propaganda gains, have'
 designated per capita consump-
 tion as a new area of competi-
 tion with capitalist countries.
 Even if the USSR succeeds with-
 in the next seven years in its
 effort to match the United
 States in per capita consump-
 tion of selected food products
 such as meat and milk,  over-
 all per capita  consumption in
 the USSR will remain well below
 that in the United States and
 most of Western Europe because
 of the lag in other areas,  es-
 pecially consumer durables and
 housing.   Moreover,  the Soviet
 consumer will not experience as
 rapid an increase in over-all
 consumption as he did during
 the past seven years,  but there
 will be a qualitative improve-
 ment in consumption,  and the

 Prime Minister Karamanlis'

 a solid working majority in the
 Greek Parliament, but there are
 some indications that the rel-
 ative government stability which
 Greece has enjoyed for six years
 may be threatened.  Foreign and
 domestic problems alike are
 mounting.  Developments in the
 explosive Cyprus issue could
 at almost any time lead Karaman
 lis to resign and in time even
 result in some degree of Greek
 disengagement from NATO obli-
 gations.  There is no potential
 successor to Karamanlis who
 would be better able to cope
 with the government's pressing
 issues. The Communists or Com-

 Present Political Parties
 Greek politics today are

 and his National Radical Union
 (ERE), which controls 170 of the
 300 seats in the Greek Chamber of
 Deputies but had the support of
 only 41 percent of the electorate
 in the May 1958 election.  The
 ERE is a heterogeneous group
 of right-center politicians
 held together by Karamanlis,
 the absence of effective non-Com-
 munist opposition parties to
 which-disaffected politicians
 might defect, and.the fear of the
 increasing strength of the Commu-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 2 October 1958
 The premier has the sup-
 port of the monarchy, and Greeks
 generally believe he also enjoys
 the backing of the United States
 He has often threatened to re-
 sign and has actually taken
 steps to do so on several occa-
 sions during the recurrent
 crises over Cyprus.   A further
 deterioration in the Cyprus
 situation--particularly if com-
 bined with publicly proclaimed
 American support for the Brit-
 ish--could cause him to insist
 that the King accept his resig-
 nation.
 The major opposition to
 Karamanlis is furnished by EDA,
 the legal front for the out-
 lawed Communist party of Greece
 (KKE). While EDA has the back-
 ing of international Communism,
 it also has the support of many
 non-Communists.  Its figurehead
 chairman,  John Passalides, is
 apparently a left-wing social-
 ist.   EDA, as a tactical move
 to attract left-of-center sup-
 port, espouses a neutralist for-
 eign policy and domestic objec-
 tives in line with generally
 propounded "socialist" aims
 rather than openly advocating
 out-and-out Communist pol-
 icies.
 Because of its known con-
 nection with the KKR, EDA for
 years seemed incapable of gain-
 ing more than 15 percent of:the
 vote in a national election.
 The 25 percent it received in
 May 1958, which enlarged its
 parliamentary representation from
 17 to 79, has caused a general
 reappraisal of Greek politics.
 While the number of Communist
 votes in Greece has grown signif-
 icantly in recent years, as shown
 in the last election, it is be-
 lieved that not more than 15 per-
 cent of the EDA vater came from
 ideological supporters of the ex-
 treme left.   The rest of the EDA
 vote came from a large and grow-
 ing section of the Greek elec-
 torate which is dissatisfied with
 the economic situation and the
 foreign policies of the national-
 ist parties.
 The non-Communist opposi-
 tion parties in Greece were
 seriously-weakened in the May
 elections.   The traditional
 centrist pro-Western Liberal par-
 ty fell behind EDA in the vote
 and had its parliamentary repre-
 sentation cut from 67 to 35.   A
 lack of constructive leadership,
 a program not easily differenti-
 ated from that of ERE, and a
 growing polarization of Greek
 politics between the right and
 extreme left caused the Liberal
 loss..  There is no indication
 at present that the Liberals can
 regain their former position in
 Greece.   Their parliamentary
 leader, George Papandreou, is
 striving without appreciable

 success to unite all national-
 ist opposition parties into a
 new political party.
 Several small parties in
 the Chamber of Deputies,   al-
 though relatively insignificant
 in size, contain ambitious and
 controversial politicians.  Of
 these, the most vocal is the
 brilliant but erratic Spyros
 Markezinis, a spokesman for the
 Progressive Agrarian Democratic
 Union, who considers himself
 Greece's "man of destiny."
 a  a z s,   ea  o  the Agrarian
 party,  is actively attempting
 to keep the Greek rural vote,
 a current target of EDA, from
 going to the far left.
 Karamanlis' major internal
 problems are related--the growth
 of Communist influence,which in
 turn has resulted in part from
 the   government's  failure  to
 more rapidly develop the economy
 of the nation.
 Following EDA's success in
 the elections, Karamanlis estab-
 lished an anti-Communist commit-
 tee within the government to
 recommend action against the ex-
 treme left.  A subsequent gov-
 ernment campaign to acquaint
 the public with EDA's close ties
 with the KKE has been accompa-
 nied by the arrest of several
 EDA leaders and other harassing
 tactics.  Rumors are increasing
 in Athens that EDA will soon be
 outlawed.
 .  Such a move might destroy
 EDA as an organization and at
 least temporarily crush    the
 morale of the extreme leftists.
 On the other hand, other camou-
 flaged left-wing parties would
 probably soon arise, while popu-
 lar dissatisfaction with the
 nationalist parties and support
 for EDA's principles would not
 be erased..  Possibly anticipat-
 ing repressive action, EDA re-
 cently created a new left-wing
 party--the   Democratic  Union.
 This new party, and others which
 are expected to appear, probably
 was formed as'a haven for EDA
 members when and if the parent
 party is proscribed and also
 will be used by EDA as a bridge
 to the political center.
 The armed forces are an
 element of stability in Greece,
 since their leaders are anti-
 Communist and almost universally
 loyal to the crown.  The Sacred
 Bond of Greek Officers (IDEA),
 formed during World War II, is

 a secret, ultrapatriotic, and
 anti-Communist organization
 within the armed forces.   IDEA
 has been largely quiescent since
 1951 but EDA's recent success
 at the polls may lead to a re-
 vival of IDEA activity.   If a
 leftist rise to power appeared
 imminent,  by either legal or
 extralegal means, the armed
 forces would probably attempt
 to establish a right-wing au-
 thoritarian regime.
 In the economic field,Kara-
 manlis  has; recently indicated
 that he intends to put increased
 emphasis on the development of
 agriculture--backbone of the
 Greek economy.   Also,  partly to
 combat left-wing charges that
 the government has failed to
 solve economic problems, he
 has proposed measures aimed at
 slashing imports of luxury
 goods, stamping out tax eva-
 sion, and ensuring a more
 equitable distribution of the
 national wealth.   The drive to
 speed development of the Greek
 economy is handicapped by a
 lack of available capital, how-
 ever, and this largely accounts
 for the emphasis in the press
 on the need to secure large-
 scale West German credits--pres-
 ently under discussion in Bonn.
 Soviet blandishments in the
 economic field have largely
 been ignored thus far.
 Foreign Problems
 Nearly all foreign and do-
 mestic issues in Greece are af-
 fected by the Cyprus problem.
 This highly emotional issue
 could result in the govern-
 ment's resignation, and both
 Communist and nationalist oppo-
 sition leaders have vainly
 sought to bring this about. The
 premier and foreign minister
 have long since tired of the
 Cyprus controversy and desire a
 settlement, but they are forced
 by intense Greek nationalism and
 the leaders of the Greek Cyp-
 riots to take the lead in the
 fight against British "colonial-
 ism."
 The Cyprus problem has at
 least temporarily ended Turkish-
 Greek collaboration in NATO, has
 damaged traditionally friendly
 Anglo-Greek relations, and has
 caused a steady decline in Amer-
 ican prestige in Greece--the
 United States being accused of
 supporting Britain and Turkey
 in the dispute--and has even re-
 sulted in recurrent Greek threats
 to leave NATO.   Greek disillu-
 sionment with the West was re-
 cently reflected in the UN Gen-
 eral Assembly, when the Greek
 delegate abstained on the Indian
 resolution for Chinese Communist
 representation.   This indication
 of a new "independent" Greek
 foreign policy was warmly ap-
 plauded by all segments of the
 Greek press.
 Traditional good relations
 between Greece and certain Arab
 states, notably the UAR, have
 improved during the past two
 years. This results partly from
 the existence of Greek communi-
 ties in the Middle East and the
 position of the Greek Orthodox
 Church in that area, but is also
 based on UAR support for Greece
 in the Cyprus dispute.   Conse-
 quently, when American and Brit-
 ish troops were dispatched to
 Lebanon and Jordan in July, the
 Greek press was nearly unanimous
 in criticizing the Western moves,
 although the government quietly
 cooperated with the United States
 by granting facilities for Amer-
 ican planes.   Many Greek Govern-
 ment leaders have expressed the
 view that the United States fails
 to appreciate Greece's potential
 value as a bridge between. the
 West and Nasir.
 Diplomatic relations with
 the Soviet Union are correct but
 cool.   A recent agreement with
 the USSR envisages a large in-
 crease in trade between the two
 countries, but the level pro-
 posed remains a small percent-
 age of total Greek foreign trade.
 However, in certain products,
 such as tobacco, the increased
 levels will have an important
 economic and political impact.
 Moscow's attempts to expand cul-
 tural exchanges have recently

 been rebuffed by Athens, which
 also took action to reduce the
 volume of Soviet propaganda
 disseminated in Greece. Never-
 theless, the entire Soviet bloc
 has backed Greece on the Cyprus
 issue, although not as vigorous-
 ly as might have been expected.
 In light of the supreme impor-
 tance of this problem to the
 Greek people, the USSR can ex-
 ploit this support in an effort
 to reduce the traditional ties
 of Greece with its Western al-
 lies.
 FIDEL CASTRO'S "26TH OF JULY" MOVEMENT
 Fidel Castro's "26th of
 July" movement has in less than
 two years become the symbol of
 revolutionary opposition to
 the regime of Cuban' President
 Fulgencio Batista.
 As the revolutionary move-
 ment has spread and become more
 violent, heretofore uncommitted
 Cubans have been forced to take
 a stand for or against the gov-
 ernment, but the bulk of the
 population probably still favors
 a peaceful transition to con-
 stitutional government through
 elections.  It is more the move-
 ment's success than its revolu-
 tionary program which has won
 it a widely varied following,
 including some respected civic,
 business, and religious groups.
 A good many supporters,
 however, would not want to see
 Castro become president.   De-
 spite his frequent statements
 to the contrary, Castro is be-
 lieved to entertain personal
 political ambitions, and many
 responsible members of Cuba's
 political opposition fear he
 could become a more formidable
 dictator than Batista.
 Organization, Accomplishments
 The "26th of July" move-
 ment, so called after the date
 of an unsuccessful coup in 1953,
 is a loose organization nominal-
 ly headed by Fidel Castro,'whose
 long record of revolutionary
 activity and whose penchant for
 the dramatic. provide a strong
 emotional appeal for Cuban
 youth.   In practice, Castro
 wields direct control only over
 the rebels under his command in
 the Sierra Maestra of Oriente
 Province.   Other rebel groups,
 such as that under the command
 of his brother Raul in eastern-
 most Oriente, are at least semi-
 autonomous, principally because
 of difficult communications.
 The Castro movement has
 grown from 12 survivors of the
 expedition which landed in
 Oriente in December 1956 to an
 island-wide organization with ef-
 fective branches in -several
 other American republics.   Re-
 cent estimates place the number
 of armed rebels in Oriente
 Province-between 4,000 and 6,000,
 with the majority under Raul's
 command in the larger "second-
 front" area.   There are prob-
 ably a substantial number of
 "part-time" rebels who take up
 arms during night raids and
 others who could be counted on
 to join the movement under con-
 ditions of intensified hostili-
 ties.                                                         A shortage of arms and
 other supplies has limited the
 size of the fighting force.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The rebels control, most of
 Oriente Province, except the
 cities and areas of army con-
 centration, and reportedly have
 opened "fronts" in Camaguey,
 Las Villas, and Pinar del Rio
 provinces.   One of Fidel Castro's
 principal lieutenants has re-
 cently moved into Camaguey Pi,ov-
 ince with a column of men,  in-
 dicating that the movement may
 attempt to gain control over
 Camaguey similar to that exer-
 cised in Oriente,   The rebels
 have demonstrated their ability
 to paralyze transportation in
 Oriente Province*at will.   They
 have not, however, shown them-
 selves capable of inspiring
 spontaneous popular support for
 "all-out" offensives and twice
 have failed in attempts to call
 nationwide general strikes.
 An underground organization
 of nonfighting members operates
 in many cities and carries on
 liaison with other opposition
 groups,  both inside and outside
 Cuba, as well as with "26th of
 July" groups in exile.   Exile
 groups are most active in Mexico,
 Venezuela, and the United States,
 and provide the rebels with im-
 portant financial and logistical
 support;   Smaller groups operate
 in other Latin  American  coun-
 tries.
 At present the Castro move-
 ment is supported by the, major-
 ity of opposition groups,  both
 in Cuba and in exile, although
 this unity,  as in the case of
 earlier movements,  could prove
 short-lived.   The two opposi-
 tion political parties which
 have offered presidential candi-
 dates for the 3 November general
 elections--the "autenticos" of
 former President Ramon Grau Sari
 Martin and the Free People's
 party formed in August 1957 and
 led by Carlos Marquez Sterling--
 have been excluded from the
 unity pact and have renounced
 revolution as a means of solv-
 ing Cuba's political problems.
 Support for the rebels also
 emanates from such groups as
 the Civic Resistance Movement-,
 an  organization of respected
 businessmen-and civic leaders
 which has provided important
 financial backing.   Some indi-
 vidual members of the Roman Cath-
 olic hierarchy are believed to
 support the movement, but the
 church itself,  although increas-
 ingly anti-Batista, has never
 indicated a pro-Castro policy
 and officially favors a peace-
 ful change in government.
 Organized labor, although
 declaring itself neutral, has
 placed itself firmly in Batista's
 camp and has endorsed the labor
 program offered by the govern-
 ment's presidential candidate,
 Andres Rivero Aguero.
