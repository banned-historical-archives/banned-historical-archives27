TEN YEARS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY 
Section I: Policy Toward the U.S. and the 
Diplomatic Isolation of Taipei 
This is a working paper of the DD/I Special Research 
Staff. It is the first in a series which will include 
separate papers on Peking's effort to limit U.S. involve-
ment in countries near China, policy toward Communist 
regimes, policy toward countries far from China, and Mao's 
doctrines on war and armed revolution. 
Mao's policy toward the U.S. in recent years reflects 
his willingness to discard shrewd diplomatic behavior and 
to make it easier for Peking's opponents to demonstrate 
that he, rather than the American leaders, is the intran-
sigent party preventing any improvement in Sino-American 
relations. His view that revolutionary elements should 
dominate diplomatic tactics in foreign policy has retarded 
Peking's effort in recent years to gain international 
recognition and has eroded much of the goodwill Chou En-
lai had created among Japanese politicar.and intellectual 
figures. 
It is the writer's view that Chou has been, and 
continues to be, dominated by Mao's general lines on 
foreign policy. Chou has tried to make Mao's obsessions 
--that is, the fetishes of his "thought," "class struggle," 
and "world revolution"--appear to be ratioral by demon-
strating remarkable dexterity within Mao's intransigent 
policy lines. But increasingly since 1964, Chou has had 
to work within an even more restricted diplomatic frame-
work, has had to give more tactics the third degree to 
make sure they were "revolutionary," and has had to accept 
a debasement of diplomacy in which Chinese officials in 
1967 mongered Mao's ego-cult from their posts in foreign 
embassies and when the established practice of diplomatic 
immunity was discarded. In the periods of revolutionary 
advance in 1967, Mao apparently permitted fanatics ? . 
'(namely, Wang Li.'And Yao Teng-shan) tb -operate rather... 
freely under a general (and, therefore, permissive) guide-
line, as witness the attacks on British officials and the

burning of the charge's office in Peking on 22 August. 
But in the subsequent period of revolutionary retreat, 
the area of permissive action was drastically constricted, 
as witness Chou's "five prohibitions" on embassy attacks 
(1 September) and the Central Cbmmittee-State Council 
decree specifying that only "competent authorities" are 
permitted to carry out and supervise embassy demonstrations 
(7 October). Although Chou now presides over a period 
of withdrawal from some of the most extreme positions in 
foreign policy, he still acts as Mao's subordinate, as 
is suggested (among other things) by his sycophantic 
speech of 30 September 1967, in which he reiterated, in 
the face of foreign diplomats, ludicrous eulogies to Mao's 
"thought." 
The views expressed in this, the first paper in 
the series, are those of the writer and do not reflect 
an official position of the Directorate of Intelligence.

TEN YEARS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY 
THE BASIC PERSPECTIVE: REVOLUTIONARY DIPLOMACY 
In attacking foreign policy problems, Mao Tse-
tung's shrewd behavior--that is, his willingness to act 
dexterously on the basis of an informed calculation of 
the probable effects of a political move--seems to have 
been gradually changed, More than ever before, he seems 
to have contempt for the idea that a wise leader must be 
alert to everything his aides tell him about the consequ-
ences of major foreign policy moves. As a result, there 
are more irrational elements in Chinese Communist foreign 
policy than ever before. 
Comparing Chinese Communist foreign policy of the 
mid-1950s with that of the mid-1960s, the most fundamental 
change in Peking's affort against Washington is Mao's 
significantly increased willingness to expose himself to 
the charge that he is the unreasonable and intransigent 
party. Whereas in the earlier period he and Chou En-lai 
had worked to put the art of diplomacy at Peking's service, 
to make it a sharply pointed political weapon in the in-
ternational struggle against the United States and the 
Chinese Nationalists, in recent years Mao has become less 
concerned with the matter of avoiding diplomatic blunders. 
He apparently is annoyed by the diplomatic road because 
it has led to small advances rather than complete victory 
on the issues of control of Taiwan, admission to the UN, 
and universal diplomatic recognition. Beyond that, the 
diplomatic road has cut across the grain of his revolu-
tionary compulsion. It had required a significant down-
grading of the pre-1952 appeal for international revolu-
tion (especially in Asia) and a significant upgrading of 
the tactful effort to create pro-Peking and anti-Washing-
ton sentiment in various countries, It had required 
practical expediency and maneuvering room, and Mao showed 
good sense in the mid-1950s by permitting his chief foreign 
policy adviser, Chou En-lai, to exercise his remarkable 
diplomatic skill. Whenever Mao has permitted Chou some 
leeway to maneuver, the Chinese premier has proven to be

.he most effective opponent of U.S. policy in the Chinese 
leadership. Increasingly in recent years, however, Mao 
has acted mafe on his revolutionary compulsion and has 
provided Chou with less maneuvering room than ever before. 
Chou has had to comply with Mao's 
celn with world reiiolution even at times 
fence-mending was the immediate problem. 
in the final days of his African tour of 
Chou had been on the brink of ending effectively a major 
effort to refurbish Peking's international image which 
had suffered from Chinese. Communist attacks on Indian 
forces Ootober-November 1962) and criticism of the partial 
test-ban treaty (summer and fall of 1963). Chou had also 
made some advances in competing with the USSR and the U.S. 
for increased influence in the area, in moving some regimes 
c:oser to formal recognition of Peking, and in arguing 
for the convening of a second conference. of Afro-Asian 
countries, Even Ethiopia's prime minister, who had dis-
puted with Chou on several points, told the U.S. ambassa-
dor (on 6 February 1964) that the Chinese premier had 
made an "excellent impression" primarily because his 
behavior indicated he was "cultivated, subtle, intelligent, 
and conciliatory--not at all like Molotov," When, however, 
Chou in Somalia in early February described Africa as an 
area "ripe for revolution," the phrase raised deep suspi-
cions among relatively moderate African leaders regarding 
Peking's subversive goals on the continent and Chou's 
motives in making the trip. Even when, at a later period, 
the Chinese Communists acted to reassure African leaders 
that they were not trying to bring down their governments, 
they seemed to be saying: not now trying. For example, 
People's Daily on 28 October 190-stated that the common 
.erfemgmlit present" is the West and that Peking does not 
call for "socialist" (i.e., Communist-led) revolution in 
the present historical stage. But this qualification 
as to the timing of a Communist revolution defeated the 
diplomatic intention to give reassurance and to dispel 
suspicions. Mao's revolutionary compulsion does not mix 
well with Chou's diplomatic skill. Nevertheless, Chou 
has been willing to comply with this self-defeating in-
congruity in order to retain Mao's favor,

Chou continued to defend Mao's global strategy, 
and by December 1964, he declared that Mao's speeches 
and statements "reflect the revolutionary will of the 
people of the world in a highly concentrated form." By 
the fall of 1965, following a series of international 
setbacks, Chou had to insist that these developments 
would not force Peking to change the policy of support-
ing revolutions everywhere. On the contrary, Chou En-
lai declared that in connection with supporting the "just 
causes" of revolution 
We will never retreat a single step from 
this principled stand, whatever storms may 
arise on the international scene and how-
ever much the U.S. imperialists and their 
partners may curse and threaten us, even to 
the point of imposing a war on us?. .At 
present, an excellent revolutionary situa-
tion lies before the people of the whole 
world. The revolutionary struggle of all 
peoples against U.S. imperialism has never 
been so vigorous as today. (Speech of 30 
September 1965) 
Although he claimed that Peking was also adhering to the 
five principles of "peaceful coexistence," Chou's emphasis 
was decisively on world revolution and he listed the various 
national struggles Peking was supporting, including those 
for "national liberation," Mao clearly was in no mood 
to concede to domestic and foreign critics that his militant 
foreign policy had been wrong, and his aides subsequently 
persisted in giving revolution precedence over diplomacy. 
Lin Piao was chosen to state the kind of revolu-
tion Mao preferred; on 3 September 1965, Lin's extensive 
statement on all aspects of Mao's "people's war" strategy 
was depicted as a major pronouncement relevant to global 
policy. This statement completed the two-part global

strategy that Mao had been developing ever since the in-
tensification of the Sino-Soviet dispute in the period 
1960-1963. Mao had emphasized the first part--the anti-
U.S. "united front"--in a series of five major pronounce-
ments on "revolutionary struggles" in 1963-64. Lin Piao's 
statement was the second part. The two parts were depicted 
as "the two magic weapons" for defeating the U.S. in the 
international arena--"people's war and the united front 
against U.S. imperialism"--by Liao Cheng-chih on 26 April 
1966. 
In a basic sense, the formulator of Peking's 
foreign policy strategy is Mao, and it is to his basic 
strategy that Chou En-lai must resfond in implementing 
a revolutionary foreign policy. But Chou's troubles have 
been increased. Since 1965, Mao has been raking it dif-
ficult for him to work effectively even within the con-
fines of the "united front" part of the strategy. By 
abusing government leaders of underdeveloped and capital-
ist countries, Mao has violated his own dictum to "unite 
all the anti-U.S. forces that can be united." He has 
also acted against his own concept of a second intermediate 
zone--i.e., the capitalist countries, excluding the U.S.--
by maligning the leaders of Britain and Japan, The forces 
that can Le united in either the underdeveloped world 
(the first intermediate zone) or in developed countries 
(the second intermediate zone) have been reduced drastically 
in number. 
Mao is an unregenerate Stalinist who believes in 
and acts on the dictum that "class struggle" is also an 
international conflict and that the struggle ageinFt the 
U.S. is irreconcilable, "With U.S. imperialism, peaceful 
coexistence will never be possible" (Chou En-lai's speech 
of 29 March 1965). Unlike the post-Stalin Soviet leaders, 
Mao's view of American presidents has been impervious to 
change and there has been no amelioration in his hostile 
image of them, as witness Chou's undifferentiated condemna-
tion of "Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson" in 
his report of 21-22 December 1964 to the National People's 
Congress. On the contrary, each successive president 
since President Truman has been depicted, in a ritualistic 
formulation, as being worse than the previous one. Further,

Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have 
been depicted as equally wicked and as similarly repre-
sentative of U.S. monopoly capital and hostile motives. 
In contrast to Khrushchev and certain post-Khrushchev 
Soviet leaders who have conceded that some American states-
men are "sober-minded," Mao has had his propagandists 
reject the concept and attack the Soviets for expressing 
it: 
In the U.S., whether in power or out, the 
ruling cliques consist of wolves,...Whether 
Kennedy or Johnson, are they not 'beasts of 
the same pack?'. Have not the modern 
revisionists long been shouting that there 
are also 'clear-headed elements' in U.S. 
imperialism? (Peking Red Flag article of 
23 September 1964) 
Mao's code of undifferentiated hostility to American 
presidents is retained with a curious intensity and con-
tinuity, reflecting his determination to sustain Sino-
American tensions so long as Washington does not sur-
render to his demands on the Taiwan issue. 
Mao has been aware that a series of foreign policy 
defeats in 1965-66--e.g,, in Burundi, Tunisia, Kenya, 
Indonesia, Ghana, Dahomey, and the Central African Republic 
and in connection with Peking's line on the Japan-ROK 
treaty, the second Afro-Asian conference, and the Pakistan-
India war--exposed his global strategy to international 
and internal criticism. Although certain of these set-
backs were not specific reactions to Chinese Communist 
initiatives--e.g., the coups in Indonesia, Dahomey, the 
Central African Republic, and Ghana--others took place in 
countries and on issues where the Chinese had tried to 
make gains. Mao made an effort to dispel the general im-
pression that he was in any way responsible for any of

He has had his propagandists 
try to demonstrate that a mysterious "natural" process, 
rather than Mao personally, has been responsible for 
defeats. "Marxists,., .regard the great international up-
heaval as the natural outcome of the sharpening of the 
international class struggle." (People's Daily article 
of 1 March 1966) Regarding (2), after his propagandists 
declared, in the winter of 1965, that the U.S. was gradu-
ally shifting the "focus of its global strategy" from 
Europe to Asia, centering it on the mainland, Peking im-
plicitly denied that this reflected a fundamental failure 
of foreign policy. But the argument was weak and, at 
points, not credible. It was strained, and it contained 
an implicit demand that one of Mao's characteristically 
self-defensive dictums should be taken as literal truth: 
"To be opposed by our enemy is not a bad thing; it adds 
to our honor" (People's Daily Observer article of 20 
February 1966 commenting onSecretary Bundy's  
speech of 12 February)./ 
Mao's genuine confidence in the prospect of ad-
vances against the U.S. has changed, In contrast to the 
hardline period of 1957-58 when Mao and his foreign policy 
aides really seemed to believe that the Communist bloc 
could significantly reduce U.S. influence in various coun-
tries by a more aggressive political strategy; and make 
"the east wind prevail over the west wind" (Mao's state-
ment in Moscow in November 1957), in recent years their 
confidcnce appears to be more contrived, This ersatz 
confidence is a result of Mao's split with the Soviet 
leaders (destroying the concept of an "east" wind) and 
setbacks in 1965-66 (destroying the concept of a receding 
"west" wind). Viewed in the context of coups among pro-

"national liberation movements," Chou's statement of 30 
September 1965 that "an excellent revolutionary situa-
tion" now exists in the world does not carry the same con-
viction as the ringing Peking declarations in 1957-58 that 
the U.S. will be rolled back "with the force of millions." 
Mao's foreign policy aides had to "explain" that, regard-
ing the Communist bloc, first of all it has to be recon-
structed because "a new process of division will inevit-
ably occur in the revolutionary rnnks, and some people 
will inevitably drop out; but at the same time, hundreds 
of millions of revolutionary people will stream in" (Red-
Flag-People's Daily joint article of 11 November 19657 
:-
They also had to "explain" that, regarding the revolution-
ary struggle, "a great upheaval, division, and realign-
ment is taking place in the world.. If the imperialists, 
revisionists, and reactionaries get the upper hand in 
some places and retrogression sets in temporarily, that 
would be a mere twist or turn in the advance of history" 
and the tide would "eventually" turn in Peking's favor 
(People's Daily article of 4 April 1966). These "explana-
tions" take the line of Mao's old procedure of trying to 
convince his cadres (and the populace) that while his 
forces may be in the process of retreat before an advanc-
ing enemy and have lost a battle or two--"To ask the revo-
lutionary army to win every battle it fights is asking 
the impossible" (People's Daily article of 11 April 1966)--
they will win in II7e- future by pugnacious adherence to 
Mao's strategy. The intensity of the 1965-66 articles, 
in which Mao's foreign policy aides tried to justify his 
world strategy as correct (especially after the coups in 
Indonesia and Ghana), apparently reflected their aware-
ness that these and other setbacks had created an extreme 
and unprecedented decline in Peking's international 
prestige, 
Mao's aides apparently convinced him that the general 
impression gaining credence among other countries was that 
Peking was (1) encircled by its opponents, was (2) aggres-
sive and intransigent, and was (3) isolated. Mao's will-
ingness to try to dispel thIi-general impression was only 
temporary. He apparently permitted his aides in late

revolutions everywhere, This was a drastic change from 
the previous emphasis on global revolutionary strategy. 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Burma were selected as the 
best countries for Liu Shao-chi and Chen Yi to visit in 
the effort to demonstrate that Peking was not (1) encircled, 
inasmuch as at least one significant ii-c iround the main-
land remained open, (2) was not aggressive, inasmuch as 
its policy was peaceful -Ciiiiiistence of the 'Bandung type, 
and (3) was not isolated, inasmuch as it still had important 
friends and international respect, The People's Daily 
editorial of 27 March 1966, published at the start of the 
Liu-Chen trip, revived the dictums of the Bandung era of 
the mid-1950s and placed the trip in the context of an 
"unending flow" of contacts between Peking and its neigh-
bors. The editorial attributed this policy of "peace and 
amity" to Mao's October 1949 view of friendly relations, 
declaring it to be part of his "socialist foreign policy" 
which the PRC has "steadfastly pursued," Only secondary 
importance was given to world revolution and to Mao'S 
statement on the need to support revolutionary straggles. 
Significantly, however, Mao's statement on support-
ing revolution was described in this editorial.as.a policy 
which will be "immovable under any circumstances.," This 
apparently reflected Mao's inability to resist reassert-
ing and defending his revolutionary strategy even at a 
time when his aides had convinced him that Such a'reas-
sertion would be detrimental to Peking's immediate inter-
ests. Late- in the trip, Chen Yi shattered the image 
of moderation which he and Liu were projecting in the 
earlier part of the trip in West Pakistan and Afghanistan, 
and he reasserted. Mao's militant view of global strategy, 
making no references to peaceful coexistence (speech in 
Dacca of 15 April 1966), Although the Liu-Chen trip was 
finally appraised as "a major victory for China's foreign 
policy of peace" in the People's Daily editorial of 21 
April 1966, elements of the ffiEffuTii-giiirit were gradually 
displaced in May by comments on the revolutionary strategy.

By 1 June 1966, 
the revolutionary line was forcefully reasserted in a 
People's Daily article, which insisted that Peking would 
"side with the revolutionary people of all countries," 
would never abandon its "revolutionary stand," and had 
never felt isolated and "never will be." In short, the 
return to Bandung image-building in March and April 1966 
was a temporary change of course, an aberrant shift, and 
it was followed by the adamantly revolutionary line, the 
line of mobilizing a "united front" against the U.S. and 
struggling with "the revolutionary people of all countries" 
against the U.S. and USSR "to the end" (Lin Piao keynote 
speech of 1 October 1966),

Mao's revolutionary compulsion has led to self-
isolation. Although he does not want to concede that 
he is the leader of an internationally isolated regime, 
his revolutionary compulsion has become so dominant in 
recent years that he is unwilling to act tactfully for 
any extended period in order to avoid isolation. This 
incongruity was demonstrated in his statement 
in November 1966 that "we are not afraid of 
being isolated and we shall never be isolated." In the 
past decade, shifts to the left in Peking's basic foreign 
policy seem to have been products of Mao's own refusal 
to allow the rational political calculations of his aides 
to dominate the fanatical elements in his revolutionary 
view of the international process. 
Mao's purge of many of his lieutenants, and his 
effort to revolutionize those he has retained, was re-
flected in foreign policy in early 1967 by a radical 
shift to the left, In order to make the instruments of 
his militant diplomacy more revolutionary, he has applied 
a form of organizational shock treatment to the Foreign 
Ministry and all of its officials. Artificial convulsions 
were produced in the Ministry shortly after the establish-
ment within it of a "Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station" 
on 18 January 1967. "Rebels" and Red Guards sent into 
each Ministry department or individually assigned to the 
Foreign Minister and his deputy ministers, began to subject 
the professionals to criticism and surveillance to ensure 
that revolutionary vigor dominated their daily routines,

A number of ambassadors and part of their staffs, who were 
recalled in late 1966, Nece subjected to special indoctrina-
tion courses in Mao's "thought," and diplomats who returned 
to their foreign posts in the spring of 1967 were impelled 
to preserve their political future by disseminating the 
symbols 6quotations and buttons) of Mao's ego-cult This 
tactless ritual practice, carried out in Burma, Nepal, 
and Cambodia (among other Countries) immediately aroused 
nationalistic indignation and created major disputes with 
foreign leaders who previously ha C been designated as 
"friendly," and even with notorious sychophants of Peking, 
Sihanouk ihat this ritual practice, reflecting 
an extension to diplomacy of Mao's insatiable craving for 
adulation, was encouraged by Mao himself is suggested by 
Chou's decision to swim with this tide of irrationality. 
Chou in mid-August 1967 asked Cambodia's foreign minister 
to permit Overseas Chinese "to show their love for Mao 
Tse-tung and Communism" Chou's attitude still seems 
to be that of a subordinate who prefers rational policies 
but is constantly impelled (even in relatively sane periods) 
to comply with the fits of self-love which seize Mao's mind. 
His willingness to comply with irrational policies 
and, at the same time, to establish a rational procedure 
for these policies was reflected in his handling of the 
revolutioniza:ion of foreign affairs machinery in 1967. 
On the one hand, following formation in January of a "liai-
son station" and Mao's directive in March that Red Guards 
and rebels "should not only be internal revolutionaries, 
but should also be international revolutionaries," Chou 
stated that he gave "full support, come what may, to the 
liaison station set up by the revolutionaries to lead 
revolution and supervise businss operations" in the Foreign 
Ministry, (Chou speech of 26 May) On the other hand, 
he criticized outside Red Guard units which had stormed 
into the MinisiTi?ciii-13 May and invaded the State Council's 
foreign affairs staff office on 29 May. He has also pre-
sided over retreats from the extremes of fanaticism in 
certain aspects of foreign policy in 1967. For example, 
he tried to deny Red Guard revelations about Peking's real 
contempt for the Pyongyang regime in January, made the 
fallback speech ending the siege of the Soviet embassy 
in February, acquired direct responsibility for running 
the Foreign Ministry on 23 August (the same day Red Guards 
were ordered to stop their activities within it under the 
guidance of Yao Teng-shan), and formulated five prohibi-
tive regulations regarding demonstrations against embassies 
on 1 September.

The basic source of Mao's current view of foreign 
policy strategy is primarily doctrinal, thus by defini-
tion more impervious to change than a less dogmatic and 
militant view of the world would be. Increasingly in 
recent years, Mao seems to have acted on the following 
warning of Stalin against losing the international revo-
lutionary perspective: 
The distinctive feature of that danger is 
the lack of belief in the international 
proletarian revolution; the lack of belief 
in its victory; skepticism with regard to 
the national liberation movement of the 
colonies and dependent countries; the fail-
ure to understand that, without supporting 
the revolutionary movement in other countries, 
our own country cannot cope with world im-
perialism; the failure to understand that 
the victory of socialism in a single country 
cannot be final because no country can be 
guaranteed against intervention until the 
revolution has triumphed at least in a cer-
tain number of countries; the failure to 
understand the basic demand of internation-
alism, that the victory of socialism in a 
single country is not an aim in itself but 
a means for developing and supporting revolu-
tion in other countries. (Stalin's speech 
of 9 June 1925) 
These propositions have appeared, in various forms, in 
Chinese Communist statements on world revolution in recent 
years. However, Stalin soon became much more conserva-
tive in pushing international revolution, and he was at-
tacked by Trotsky for his cautious approach to the needs 
of foreign revolutionaries. Mao seems to pride himself 
on sustaining and stimulating the world revolutionary 
process "uninterruptedly," as Peking puts it. Neverthe-
less, he prefers that revolutionary wars be fought by 
others and that Chinese military aid should be given in 
such a form as not to invite U.S. retaliation against 
the mainland,

SF( :111-4"1' 
In the immediate future, tactical shifts in Mao's 
foreign policy almost certainly will not dilute this 
revolutionary compulsion. The pattern of the past decade 
suggests that Mao, so long as he lives, will permit Chou 
(who "implements" his foreign policy, as Madame Mao told 
Red Guards in September 1967) to return to reality, to 
policies calculated to make diplomatic advances, only 
for short periods. The worst aberrations probably will 
be moderated temporarily, and the prospect for the im-
mediate future seems to be (1) for caution rather than 
aggressiveness in exporting Mao's ego-cult, and (2) for 
reduced harassment of foreign embassies and diplomats. 
These gauche policies probably will not be abandoned 
entirely, however. In every case in which a new hard 
line has been imposed toward a foreign country in recent 
years, the line probably will be retained, because Mao's 
dominant practice has been to wage "blow-for-blow" strug-
gles rather than to retreat from tensions once they have 
developed in inter-government or inter-party relations. 
Expedient policies (primarily the need to revive trade) 
probably will be advanced and the extremes of violent 
strikes and harassment of personnel will be reduced, but 
the new hard line will be sustained, as witness the crude 
polenlical attacks on Tokyo and Hong Kong government offi-
cials. Because the moods of Mao's mental caprice and his 
craving for international adulation defy rational inquiry, 
Judgments about the duration of the relatively rational 
periods in policy toward various countries are not worth 
much.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Policy toward the U.S. has always been adamantly 
hostile, but in the mid-1950s, Mao had permitted Chou 
to use his diplomatic skill to deflect from Peking the 
real responsibility for intransigence. Chou performed 
effectively. However, Chou's leeway for maneuver was 
reduced following the interdiction effort against the off-
shore islands in the fall of 1958. The overall Taiwan 
Strait situation--the main Sino-American issue for many 
years--was placed thereafter in political limbo as a 
result of two basic shifts in line. First, Mao retreated 
from a policy of using limited military means to attain 
the offshore islands, to a policy of avoiding any new 
military interdiction effort. Second, he movid?Trom the 
relatively flexible political tactic of temporarily 
separating the offshores issue from the Taiwan issue to 
the political strategy of combining them as territorial 
claims to be settled simultaneously. 
On the island of Chinmen there are only 80,000 
people, and it is now known to the world that 
the U.S. does not object [sicj to returning the 
islands of Chinmen and Matsu to us, but in 
exchange they want to keep Taiwan for themselves. 
This would be a disadvantageous deal. It will 
be better if we wait. Let Chiang Kai-shek 
stay on Chinmen and Matsu and we will get 
them back later together with the Pescadores 
Islands and Taiwan. (Mao's statement of 3 
March 1959 
Using this argument, Mao has converted conquest of the 
offshore islands into a distant goal and the entire Strait 
situation into a political struggle. 
Mao has been convinced that Washington is determined 
to support the Nationalists on the islands. Further, he 
has been forced to accept the consequences of the Sino-
Soviet dispute for his Taiwan Strait policy. The dispute

has deprived him of the Soviet deterrent statements (which 
implied a nuclear shield in defense of the mainland)--state-
ments which, in 1954 and 1958, Mao had considered neces-
sary for going to the brink of war against the American  
military capability in the Far East.,  
The controlling formulation for the military aspect 
of the Taiwan Strait situation--namely, in the Strait 
"our war is political war" (PLA General Tu Ping's state-
ment of 10 June 1959)--has become dogma. As for Peking's 
military strategy of 1962 in handling a hypothetical Chi-
nese Nationalist attack on the mainland, there apparently 
was once a dispute over the alternative plans of luring 
the invader in deep or blocking him at the Fukien Front 
beaches. People's Daily on 7 September 1967 claimed that 
Liu Shrl-chi and Lo?Jia=ching preferred the latter strategy, 
and it implied that Lin PiaW,was the advocate of absorbing  
the attack farther inland./ 
This real issue is a sensitive matter, which is 
usually avoided by Mao and his aides because detailed 
discussion of it would clearly expose the disparity in 
the military capability of Washington and Peking. Chou 
En-lai commented on it briefly in the context of escala-
tion of the Vietnam war, differentiating between an air 
(or naval attack) and a ground attack.

bombard China by relying on their air and 
naval superiority and avoid a ground war. 
This is wishful thinking. Once the war 
gets started with air or sea action, it will 
not he for the U.S. alone to decide how the 
war will continue. If you can come from the 
sky, why can't we fight back on the ground? 
That is why we say the war will have no 
boundaries once it breaks out. (Chou's 
four-point statement on Peking's policy to-
ward the U.S. from his interview with Pakistani 
correspondent of the paper Dawn on 10 April 
1966. NCNA version of 9 May IT66) (emphasis 
supplied) 
Chou emphasized the PLA's capability to overrun countries 
in Indo-china but remained silent on whether the PLA could 
interdict, cripple, and turn back a U.S. nuclear weapons 
air (or naval) attack on the mainland. 
The intensification of the Vietnam war seems to 
have made it even more necessary for Mao to keep the strug-
gle in the Strait a political matter. The war apparently 
has increased his fear that the Chinese Nationalists would 
use any resumption of heavy shelling against the offshores 
to try to induce Washington to support a major attack 
against the mainland (or an airstrike against Mao's nuclear 
weapons development facilities). Further, another unsuc-
cessful military interdiction effort against the offshore 
islands would again draw attention to the disparity be-
tween the American and the Chinese Communist military 
capabilities. Much of the verbal aggressiveness, so long 
a standard feature of Mao's demand for the "liberation" 
of the NationaU.st-held islands, has been reduced in Peking's 
propaganda in recent years. 
The unsuccessful interdiction effort of 1958 in-
creased Mao's intransigence on the matter of Sino-Ameri-
can contacts. Shifting from the pre-1958 period, when 
the matters of release of U.S. prisoners and visits of 
Americans (e.g., dignitaries and newsmen) were discussed, 
Mao has had his diplomats insist that a complete surrender 
in the Strait must precede discussiou of all other matters.

\ a-/ 
In the Sino-US, talks, we have insisted on 
a settlement of the Taiwan issue before 
other discussions can proceed--a reversal 
of our previous strategy of handling details  
before the matter of principle./ 
In recent years, Mao has become less concerned than ever 
before about deflecting international criticism of him-
self as the intransigent party in Sino-American relations. 
In contrast with the earlier policy, which was centered 
on a major effort to avoid publicizing the crude fact 
that the start of even low-level contacts required first 
of all a U.S. surrender on the Taiwan issue, the People's  
Daily declared on 29 March 1966 that 
So long as the U.S. government does not 
change its hostile policy toward China 
and refuses to pull out its armed forces 
from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, the 
normalization of Sino-U.S. relations is 
entirely out of the question and so is the  
solution of such a concrete question as  
the exchange of visits between personnel 
of the two countries. (emphasis supplaid) 
Mao apparently is determined to insist on this obdurate 
policy indefinitely, that is, until his death. In attack-
ing Liu Shao-chi, he has had his propagandists adopt an 
even more intransigent position, implying thtst a U.S. 
withdrawal would not lead to the "development of friendly 
relations." (Peolile's Daily article of 16 October 1966) 
Regarding participation in the UN, Mao's policy 
has been encrusted with an incongruous duality. From the 
time of the establishment of his regime, he has insisted 
on entry only on his own conditions, and he has added to 
these conditions, making them even more difficult for 
other countries to accept. Since January 1965, revolu-
tionization of his UN policy was expressed in his shift 
from a simple demand for the eviction of the Nationalists 
prior to Peking's entry, to an entire series of demands, 
all of which militate against the effort to attain that 
eviction. Mao has become more contemptuous of the opinion 
and political goodwill of member countries, as witness 
his demand of March 1965 that "a new organization" should 
be established. Chen Yi's ludicrous demands of 29 September

1965 for the UN to submit to various forms of self-
disparagement and Chou En-lai's reiteration of the idea 
of "a new, revolutionary UN" on 24 June 1967 indicate 
that intelligent foreign policy aides have been impelled 
to work within the confines of a self-defeating policy. 
If Mao, in his lifetime, were to succeed in expelling 
the Nationalists from all UN bodies, the victory would 
be less a product of diplomatic skill than an expression 
of the view of some national leaders that it is good 
policy to mollify the Chinese dictator by handing- to 
him gratis China's UN seat. 
Chou En-lai has performed brilliantly in the long-
term effort to displace the representatives of Taipei in 
various countries and establish Peking's missions. At 
an earlier time, temporary flexibility had been tolerated 
(and even encouraged) by Mao in order to initiate offi-
cial activities with countries which also maintained diplo-
matic relations with the Chinese Nationalists. In Laos 
(1962) and France (1964), tactical "two Chinas" situations 
developed. But Mao would not permit these to become 
permanent. Mao has permitted only the UK to maintain a 
charge in Peking while an official representative, a 
consul, is accredited to the "provincial" Taiwan govern-
ment. The successive steps in the effort to induce De 
Gaulle to make the final move to break relations with 
Taipei (January 1964) suggest that Chou was acting within 
a guideline from Mao. This guideline permitted him to 
remove France from the doctrinal category of a colonial 
power. Mao participated in the effort, and centered his 
attention in 1964 on De Gaulle's anti-American obsession. 
Toward the conclusion of the successful effort, Mao estab-
lished an identity between himself and the French leader 
as two soldiers, and Mao in January 1964 urged a visiting 
delegation to ignore "slippery' diplomats (so that formal 
relations could begin). Since that time, De Gaulle's 
aggressive anti-American attitude has been the principal 
factor preserving the thin glaze of political restraint 
in Mao's view of relations with Paris. He apparently hopes 
that De Gaulle will remove West European countries from 
close ties with the U.S. and will pull together a second 
"intermediate zone" of capitalist countries.

But Mao's refusal to accept permanent "two Chinas" situa-
tions continues to deprive his diplomats of the opportunity 
to gain recognition for Peking from other capitalist coun-
tries and then work to displace Chinese Nationalist repre-
sentatives-Yr:6m their capitals. Since the beginning of 
his purge in 1966, Mao's willingness to violate the con-
vention of diplomatic immunity has further hampered the 
long-term effort to isolate Taipei among the nations. 
As of August 1967, the number of countries which had 
diplomatic relations with Peking and Taipei was 47 and 
62, respectively. SUbsequently, Tunisia (in September) and 
Indonesia (in October) have suspended relations with Peking. 
Japan, unlike France, has been a difficult country 
to move toward recognition, and in the past decade the 
prospects for success have been dimmest when Mao's revolu-
tionary compulsion has dominated policy. The policy over 
the years has run a zigzag course because Mao has permitted 
Chou to maneuver freely in some periods but only within 
narrow limits in other periods. 
After Mao in the fall of 1955 insisted that the 
establishment of diplomatic relations "first" was neces-
sary for the solution of smaller concrete issues, he per-
mitted Chou to begin a general step-by-step policy of non-
official political contacts and semi-official trade ex-
changes. However, the boycott on trade with Japan in may 
1958 impeded this gradualistic policy. Chou had to use 
his remarkable dexterity to remain within Mao's hard line 
while working out a formula for non-governmental trade 
with "friendly" firms in 1960. This hard line made ad-
vances in overall policy toward Tokyo difficult for Chou 
and for Communists and leftists in Japan. Mao apparently was

defending the self-defeating aspects of this hard line 
when he warned Japanese visitors in October 1961 that 
"a tortuous road of struggle" lay ahead of Japanese left-
ists. 
The intensification of the Sino-Soviet dispute 
and the need to recuperate economically impelled Mao to 
return to a softer li.e, permitting Chou to work out a 
semi-governmental trade relationship in October 1962--the 
Liao-Takasaki agreement--which facilitated Peking's ad-
vance beyond limited trade with "friendly" firms. In 
1964, the softer line remained dominant in policy toward 
Tokyo, and doctrine was partly discarded to clear the way 
for possible diplomatic recognition of the Peking regime. 
Chou in May transgressed doctrine to blur the line between 
Japanese businessmen and big capitalists, and Mao himself 
in July included them in his anti-American camp: "I can-
not believe at n11 that Japanese monopoly capital would 
lean forever toAard US imperialism." However, the Chinese 
leaders failed in this effort to cultivate a wider spectrum 
of Japanese opinion to press Tokyo to follow De Gaulle's 
example, and when, in November 1964, Prime Minister Sato 
upset their calculations by acting more openly against 
Peking than former Prime Minister Ikeda had acted, Chou 
and Chen Yi were impelled to attack the new government 
and to impose an unprecedently hard line. 
This new line became increasingly crude in mid-
1965, and Peking's hectoring statements included vague 
(but unmistakable) military threats against Tokyo for 
supporting the U.S. effort in Vietnam. The primary reason 
for this unprecedented political cudgeling of Tokyo was 
implied in Liao Cheng-chih's complaint of 24 Decemter 
1965: Sato is not willing to be the "De Gaulle of Japan." 
Peking's attacks took on the aspect of a series of ultima-
tums to Sato to comply with Mao's view on a wide range of 
international issues, the intention being to supply pro-
Peking Japanese (and businessmen who desired mainland 
business) with a reason to press Tokyo to modify its 
China policy. 
Mao's line had been changed from a gradual step-
by-step approach to an all-out political attack. More

importantly, it was shifted to the left as Mao rejected 
former allies, including the JCP, which would not associate 
itself with his view of Moscow or with his unrealistic 
plan for the revolution in Japan. Liu Shao-chi emerged 
most prominently as a participant in policy when that  
policy became increasingly militant./ 
Mao's personal responsibility for the open split 
with the JCP, after his meeting with its leaders in late 
March 1966, indicated once again that, like Stalin, he 
dominates his chief aides and has the authority to reject 
their advice whenever irrational caprice seizes his mind. 
After discarding the JCP central leadership and 
supporting only pro-Peking elements among the Japanese 
Communists, he apparently has insisted that in recruit-
ing new allies in Japan, his officials require that they 
will be obsequiously pro-Peking and will militantly oppose 
the government. This shift to the left, partly influ-
enced by his purge on the mainland, has been applied to 
business firms trading with Peking. More than ever before, 
trade is being revolutionized and tied openly to political 
matters. When, therefore, Liao Cheng-chih, who was under 
attack for being too willing to trade with non-political 
Japanese businessmen, signed a trade protocol with "friendly" 
Japanese traders in February 1967, Liao made the protocol 
a written, formal appeal for an all-out revolutionary  
"struggle" against the government.  
However, Peking has stopped short of demanding overthrow 
of the government (which it has called for in Indonesia 
and Burma). Mao's new

revolutionary line, which includes vague military threats 
against Japan, abuse of some visiting businessmen and 
newspaper reporters, and a demand that his "thought" be 
disseminated beyond Overseas Chinese to native Japanese 
in the country, has provided Tokyo with one of its 
easiest periods in resisting pressures for recognition 
of the Peking regime. 
Chou En-lai must now work in the narrowest poli-
tical framework ever in policy toward Tokyo, especially 
at a time when Mao is training "red diplomatic fighters" 
who will "never praise the bourgeoisie in an unprincipled 
way or curry favor with them" (People's Daily editorial 
of 28 June 1967). Because most Japanese leaders, intel-
lectuals, and businessmen are now undifferentiated members 
of "the bourgeoisie," the prospect is that Mao's policy 
of reducing the categories of acceptable allies will 
further erode pro-Peking sentiment in that country. Trade 
and non-official contacts will ta%e place against the 
backdrop of political hostility and the effort to attain 
formal diplomatic relations will be handled by Peking-
controlled leftists (excluding most members of the Japan-
est Communist party), who will Also work to establish a 
base for future revolution in Japan.

TEN YEARS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY 
Section I: Policy toward the U.S. and the 
Diplomatic Isolation of Taipei 
Introduction 
25X1 
Mao's foreign policy in the past decade has reflected 
his obsession with a few basic concepts, the most funda-
mental being enmity for the U.S. This obsession caused 
him to direct Peking's entire foreign policy strategy, 
prior to the intensification of his dispute with the post-
Stalinist Soviet leaders, against Washington: 
In our international struggle, our strategic 
policy is to unite all the forces which can 
be united and to point the tip of our sword 
at U.S. imperial.ism. This is the whole and 
also the core of our strategy. All our work 
should evolve around this general strategy.  
He has had his aides conduct this strategy in such an un-
compromising way as to indicate that he is neurotically 
obsessed with a desire to make advances against this enemy. 
For many years in the past decade, governments which have 
been willing to accept a hostile view of Washington, or 
something close to this view, have been treated as partners 
in a common cause. Fragments of this attitude remain in 
the ruins of Mao's foreign policy in 1967. 
Mao's policy toward the U.S. had center9d on two 
basic goals, namely, to destroy the Nationalist regime 
on Taiwan and, as a necessary prerequisite for this, to 
weaken Washington's determination to defend it. He has 
failed to attain either, however, and has been forced 
to accept a less decisive goal, namely, that of reducing 
Taipei's international prestige.

The Taiwan issue is also an obsession, a vestige 
of the enmity developed during the civil war.* Mao has 
even made it the basic reason for rejecting Khrushchev's 
policy of improving relations with the U.S. r 
Khrushchev's footdragging on this issue since late 1958. 
and, subsequently, his depiction of Peking as the real 
culprit in sustaining tensions in the Taiwan Strait has 
been deeply resented. Maoist Malayans reflected 
this resentment by complaining that 
Throughout the course of US imperialist 
armed occupation of Taiwan, the Tito ? 
clique [i.e., the Khrushchev leadership] 
blames not the U.S. imperialists but the 
PRC for causing 'tension' in the region. 
(NCNA's 3 February 1962 broadcast of a 
Malayan Monitor commentary) 
*Mao has drastically shifted his position. In July 
1936, he had told Edgar Snow that he favored "independence" 
for the Taiwanese. When, however, Chiang took refuge on 
the island in 1949 from the military blows of Communist 
forces, the destruction of this Nationalist government 
in exile became a revolutionary compulsion. Peking began 
to insist on "liberation" as an absolute necessity and 
obscured the revolutionary compulsion by using a legal 
and historic argument?i.e., Peking has "rights" to this 
piece of Chinese territory.

This charge distorted Khrushchev's early record of sup-
port, and it concealed the warning he directed toward 
President Eisenhower in two strong letters in Septerber 
1958. Nevertheless, it reflected the change in the nature 
of Soviet support after the Offshore island crisis in 
the fall of 1958 and after the Sino-Soviet dispute inten-
sified in 1960. The Soviet shift was from propaganda sup-
port for the right to acquire Taiwan to propaganda sup-
port only for the defense of the mainland. This shift 
in policy is reflected, on the one hand, in Khrushchev's 
speech of 30 September 1954--the Chinese Communist desire 
to "liberate Taiwan_is dear and entirely understandable 
to the Soviet Union"--and, on the other hand, in his 
speech of 2 July 1962, which supported only defense of 
the mainland.* Khrushchev's successors now are silent 
on the "liberation" aspect and even on defense of the  
mainland. 
By demanding a complete American surrender--i.e., 
withdrawal of all support from Taipei--Mao hms set Peking's 
policy in a mold of inflexibility, closing off all avenues 
for an improvement in relations with Washington. His 
seizure of some, and probes against other, offshore islands 
have been initiatives which strengthened rather than 
weakened Washington's determination to support the Nation-
alists. An account of his initiatives way give precision 
to an understanding of Chou En-lai's maneuvering within 
an inflexible policy. And Chou's brilliant raneuVaqiii 
emerges as only a device to conceal Mao's obsessively 
sustained demand for an American surrender. 
*"He who dares attack the PRC will meet with a crush-
ing rebuff from the great Chinese people, the people of 
the Soviet Union, and the entire socialist camp." (For 
a discussion of this deterrent statement, see pages 31-32.

I. Military Conquest of Taiwan Converted to Political  
Struggle 
Mao's obsession with Taiwan-conquest is in fact 
a distant goal, but he has tried to sustain it as a live 
issue. Mao was impelled to, make seizure of the island 
a distant goal when President Truman on 27 June 1950 
ordered the Seventh Fleet to be used as a blocking force 
in the Taiwan Strait area. Earlier, in the spring of 
1950, Peking's public statements had made seizure of the 
island a "task" for the same year. Preparations went 
forward as U.S. statements convinced Mao and his advisers 
that Washington would not intervene against a PLA attack.* 
But President Truman's action, triggered by Communist 
aggression in Korea, surprised Mao; Peking never again 
publicized a precise time-table for _onquest. Postpone-
ment of conquest was attributed to a decisive change in 
the balance of opposing forces, reflecting Mao's respect 
for the U.S. Seventh Fleet's military capability; 
Before 27 June 1950, the problem of liberat-
ing Taiwan pitted the strength of the PLA 
against the Chiang remnants, with the help 
of the U.S. imperialists in a background posi-
tion. Since 27 June, the problew...pits 
the strength of the PLA against the U.S. 
*The task was estimated to be extremely difficult even 
without the presence of U.S. forces and in the situation 
of a direct military showdown with only Nationalist forces. 
"I must first of all point out that the liberation of the 
islands along the southeast coast, especially Taiwan, is 
an extremely big problem and it will involve the biggest 
campaign in the history of modern Chinese warfare.... 
Only when we have fully prepared the material and tech-
nical conditions for overcoming these difficulties can 
we smoothly carry out this tremendous military assign-
ment and thoroughly eradicate the Kuomintang remnants."

Army published in People's China on 16 February 1950)

imperialists, with the KMT bandit remnants 
moving into the background. (Article in 
Peking World Knowledge of 7 July 1950) 
The Chinese Communists later indicated that the island 
could have been "liberated 10 years ago if Chiang had been 
unprotected" (Chen Yi's statement to newsmen in Geneva 
on 23 July 1962). Given the presence of a U.S. military 
force which Peking had no capability to destroy without 
disar=trous results to itself, the problem for Mao became 
political. That is, the U.S. had to be induced or inti-
midated to withdraw. Only after that event could the prob-
lem once again become military.* 
*"As soon as the U.S. withdraws its Seventh Fleet 
from the Taiwan Strait, the problem immediately will be 
simplified. What is left will be the settling of ac-
counts between the Chinese people and the Chiang traitor-
ous group." (Tientsin Ta Kung Pao editorial of 20 
November 1954) 
But even if the U.S. were to withdraw from the Strait, 
Peking would have an extremely difficult military problem  
in taking Taiwan./ 
 /First, large 
stocks of POL would be accumulated in Fukien Province 
and then troops would be massed in the same area; jet 
fighters and bombers would then be moved in to Fukien 
airfields. This first step would take several months. 
Second, the assault would begin with action against and 
occupation of Chinmen and Matsu, and then the attack on 
Taiwan would follow. The Chinese estimated that this 
second step would be completed in about two weeks. General 
Jani and his delegation later commented on the serious 
POL deficiency on the mainland, which the Chinese acknow-
ledged, and its importance as an impediment to an attack 
in the near future.

A. Maneuvering Against a Washington-Taipei 
Treaty (1954) 
Mao apparently gave Chou the major role in the 
political effort to annex Taiwan. Chou stayed within  
Mao's concept of an obsessively held goal: "The Chinese 
people are determined to liberate Taiwan from the grip 
of the US. aggressors and will never relax until they have 
achieved that end" (Chou's speech of 23 October 1951). 
Chou later devised an ostensibly flexible formulation, 
but did not explicitly renounce the use of force against 
the island. In the spring of 1954, he stated that "the 
Chinese people are willing to strive for the liberation 
of Taiwan by peaceful means so far as possible," bring-
ing Mao's position closer to the Soviet line on negotia-
tion and coexistence. Even when, in the summer of 1954, 
the Chinese Communists stepped up their clamor for Taiwan 
and intensified the military threat to the offshores, 
Chou tried to maintain two lines simultaneously and de-
clared in August 1954: Peking "must take determined 
action on the liberation of Taiwan," but also "the achieve-
ments of the Geneva conference demonstrate that interna-
tional disputes can be settled by the peaceful means of  
negotiation..." / 
Chou tried to prevent the indefinite postponement 
of conquest from being understood as abandonment of Mao's 
goal. He insisted on Peking's right to possess all 
Nationalist-held territory, and in January 1955, he pub-
licly rejected any "so-called cease-fire" with Chiang and 
reaffirmed that the conquest of Taiwan was an "internal 
affair in which foreign interference" would not be

tolerated. 
The Chinese Communists, in one important period, 
used limited military measures to try to prevent a mili-
tary alliance from being formalized between the U.S. and 
the Nationalists. In July 1954, a Washington-Taipei 
mutual security treaty was under consideration. Follow-
ing the Geneva conference settlement on Indochina, the 
Chinese Communists increased their forces on the coast 
opposite Taiwan and sharply increased their shelling of 
Chinmen on 3 September, calculating that this tension 
would impel Western and Asian governments to press Washing-
ton to withdraw its protection of the Nationalists, or 
at least decide against making a treaty with them. But 
Peking's limited military actions (shelling) stimulated, 
rather than deterred, Washington to act formally to con-
clude the mutual security treaty, agreement on which was 
announced on 1 December 1954, Failure to prevent the 
conclusion of the treaty led to resumed shelling of the 
offshores and further military preparations on the East 
China coast. The Chinese Communists apparently decided 
to accept a slightly greater risk by taking some other 
form of limited military action in the hope of spiking 
the internationally held view that the treaty had stabi-
lized the status of Taiwan as a second, and safely pro-
tected, China. 
As the PLA prepared to attack the Tachen Islands, 
Chinese Communist spokesmen exploited the deterrent value 
of the Sino-Soviet treaty of February 1950, declaring that 
"we are firmly linked with our great friend, the USSR, 
in an unbreakable alliance which stands for peace but 
which commands such strength as to spell doom for anyone 
who tries to violate our rights or borders" (Madame Sun

Yat-sen speech of 28 December 1954).* PLA units took I 
Chiang Shan on 18 January 1955 and forced the Nationalists 
to withdraw from the other Tachen Islands. This action 
(which included the use of Communist tactical airstrikes) 
reduced Nationalitt holdings to the island complexes of 
the Matsus and Chinmen. Politically, it rebuffed Western 
efforts to ease tension and attain a cease-fire. Peking 
kept alive the political issue of Taiwan by claiming that 
the Tachens had become "stepping stones" to the large is-
land. Sporadic artillery duels with the defenders of 
Chinmen continued, the political intention being to remind 
the world that Mao would not accept the continued exist-
ence of his revolutionary war enemy in the Strait area 
indefinitely and would not accept any compromise formula 
to ease tension which did not recognize his "right" to 
seize the island. 
But once again, the Chinese Communists had entered 
on a course which strengthened rather than weakened the 
U.S. commitment to Taipei. President Eisenhower asked 
Congress for authority--which was granted' on'28 January 
1955--to employ U.S. forces in the Strait to defend Taiwan 
and "related positions"--i.e., the offshores. The Com-
munist leaders' anxiety almost certainly was increased 
by U.S. statements regarOng the possible use of atomic 
weapons in the Far East.** Mao's spokesmen invoked the 
*Madame Sun referred several times to the treaty's 
anniversary date as "almost" arrived, suggesting Peking's 
intention to exploit its deterrent value at least two 
months before its fifth anniversary at a ;time of crucial 
need. 
**Reflecting considerable concern, the Chinese Commun-
ists picked up and cited Admiral Radford's statement of 
2 January 1955 that the U.S. would use atomic weapons if 
the Korean war were resumed and that the use of these 
weapons in other parts of the Far East would depend on 
the actual situation. They interpreted it to be a U.S. 
threat intended to deter further PLA operations against 
the Nationalists. C1ou En-lai directly attacked the U.S. 
for "brandishing atomic weapons" (statement of 24 January 
1955), but he probably was a leading proponent of caution 
in advising Mao to settle, at least temporarily, for the 
Tachens and to avoid further island seizures.

We thank the Government of the Soviet Union. 
In his speech at the session of the Supreme

count on the help of their true friend, the

The production of these weapons has long

cannot be used without consideration of  
the retaliation this will incur. 
The USSR and China are vast in size and 
the density of their population is not

B. Sino-US. Talks: Stress on Political Maneuver 
(1955-57) 
The result of Mao's retreat was to be Sino-Ameri-
can talks begun in the summer of 1955, but the Chinese 
leader remained obsessed with his view of Peking's "right" 
to use force in the future. Prior to the start of those 
talks, Chou En-lai had made it clear that the only topic 
for discussion would be an international one--i.e., ten-
sion created by the U.S. "occupation" of Chinese terri-
tory--and not a domestic one?i.e., a Communist-National-
ist cease-fire. Peking's "right" to seize Taiwan was a 
domestic matter which could not be debated. Chou set 
forth this position at Bundung in April 1955 and later 
made Peking's formal definitive statement on Taiwan and 
the American role In his report to the Standing Com-
mittee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on 13 
May 1955, Chou stated that 
Taiwan is China's territory, the people 
living in Taiwan are Chinese people, and 
the liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese 
people is China's domestic affair. The 
U.S. occupation of Taiwan has created 
tension in the Taiwan area, and this con-
stitutes an international issue between 
China and the U.S. The two questions 
cannot be mixed up. 
There is no war between China and the U.S., 
so the question of a so-called ceasefire 
does not arise. The Chinese people are 
friendly with the American people. The 
Chinese people do not want to have a war 
with the U.S. To ease tension in the 
Taiwan area, the Chinese government is 
willing to sit down and enter into negotia-
tions with the U.S. government. 
As to the form of negotiations, the Chinese 
government supports the Soviet proposal for 
a 10-power conference and is also willing

to consider other forms. However, no negotia-
tions should in the slightest degree affect 
the Chinese people's exercise of t:leir 
sovereign rights--their just demand and 
action to liberate Taiwan. At the same 
time, the Chinese government can at no time 
agree to participation by the Chiang Kai-
shek clique in any international confer-
ence. 
The Chinese people have two possible means 
of liberating Taiwan--namely, by war or 
peaceful means. The Chinese people are 
willing to strive for the liberation of 
Taiwan by peaceful means so far as this is 
possible. (emphasis supplied) 
This position meant that Peking would agree to talk about 
inducing the U.S. to withdraw ("ease tension") but would 
not negofria-ii-Zease-fire or a renunciation of the use 
of force against the Nationalists on Taiwan. In order 
to avoid international criticism for not suppressing his 
desire to conquer the island, Mao tried to gain credit 
for a willingness to talk about (rather than take) Taiwan, 
remaining silent on the decisive fact that Peking had 
already conceded his forces could not take it. This was 
a sophisticated line which probably reflected, in part, 
Chou's thinking and advice. 
At 'nit time, Mao showed sufficient moderation and 
good sense to permit Chou to gain credit among Asian 
neutrals for advancing a flexible and "reasonable" policy 
and to depict Washington as the inflexible party. It 
is a tribute to the diplomatic skill of Chou that he 
succeeded in convincing many Asians (and some influential 
men in the West) that Peking was moderate (without having 
jettisoned Mao's obsessively held goal). Whenever Mao  
has permitted Chou some leeway to maneuver, the Chinese  
premier has proven to be the most effective opponent of  
U.S.  Oicy in the Chinese leadership.

Chou's task was to move Sino-U.S. talks from the 
consular to the ambassadorial level, and finally to the 
foreign minister level. The U.S. was to accept this 
political ascent, or appear to much of the world to be 
unreasonable in refusing. Chou used a conciliatory line 
on detained nationals to induce the U.S. to move negotia-
tions to a higher level. By the start of the talks (1 
August 1955), of 51 Americans known to have been held on 
the mainland, 10 were released; by mid-January 1956, 28 
more were freed as a result of the agreement reached in 
mid-September 1955. Chou had said that "first of all" 
the ambassadorial level talks would reach such an agree-
ment, but as negotiations bogged down on the major issue 
of renunciation of force, some Americans were retained 
as hostages to induce Washington to raise the level of 
the talks, or at least to sustain them.*  / 
 /Peking declared publicly 
on 18 January 1956 that "it is obvious that only through 
a Sino-American conference of foreign ministers will it 
be possible to settle the question of relaxation and 
elimination of tension in the Taiwan area." Chou was 
aware that such a conference would greatly exacerbate 
Washington-Taipei relations and induce other governments 
to move toward formal recognition of the Peking regime. 
Chou's position on the renunciation of force was 
slippery. In his speech of 30 July 1955, his formulation 
left him free to renounce force without modifying his 
previous position. That is, he was free to renounce 
force under a clever formulation which would permit him 
to demand an American withdrawal but would not oblige the

Communists to desist from attacking Taiwan if military 
force were necessary. 
...there are two possible ways for the 
Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, namely, 
by war or by peaceful means. Conditions  
permitting, the Chinese people are prepared 
to seek the liberation of Taiwan by peace-
ful means. In the course of the liberation 
by the Chinese people of the mainland and 
the coastal islands, there was no lack of 
precedents for peaceful liberation. Provided 
that the U.S. does not interfere with China's  
internal affairs, the possibility of peace-
ful liberation of Taiwan will continue to 
increase. (emphasis supplied) 
Chou went on to hint of circumventing the U.S., expressing 
a willingness to begin negotiations with "the responsible 
local authorities of Taiwan..." This suggested negotia-
tions below the level of Chiang.* However, after several 
months of discussions at Geneva of the concept of renun-
ciation of force, the Chinese Communists declared (on 
18 January 1956) that they "absolutely cannot accept" any 
formula which would permit the U.S. to defend Taiwan 
against attack. 
To sum up; "negotiations" was conceived by Mao and 
Chou as a procedure to improve Peking's chances of attain-
ing international recognition and a withdrawal of Ameri-
can forces from Taiwan. Following such a withdrawal, 
"negotiations" would be attempted with the Nationalists 
*In 1959, this level was raised to include Chiang and/or 
his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who in fact received several 
Chinese Communist bids to defect or "negotiate." Chiang 
himself was promised a place in the central or "local" 
(Taiwan) government in the course of several facetious 
statements made by Chou and his aides, and later, in 
September 1964, by Mao himself.

C. Sino-U.S. Talks Interrupted: Stress on 
Sino-American talks moved into a complete stale-
mate, and were interrupted in December 1957, when Ambas-
sador Johnson was transferred to Bangkok. Mao refused 
to accept further talks between Peking's ambassador and 
a U.S. representative of lower rank.* Major internal 
developments had impelled him to return to hardline 
Stalinist policies by early 1958, and he began to dispute 
with Khrushchev, demanding a more aggressive global 
strategy for the bloc against the U.S. During discus-
sions with Khrushchev in Moscow in November 1957, Mao 
apparently recognized that the Soviet ICBM and earth-
satellite successes could be exploited to make the Soviet 
deterrent apply to an interdiction effort against the 
offshores. On 23 August 1958, the Chinese began their 
interdiction effort against the Chinmen and Matsu island 
*In the first years of the Sino-American ambassadorial 
meetings, the Chinese often proposed that they be raised 
to the foreign minister's level (in order to suggest at 
least partial U.S. recognition of Peking). But during 
the temporary suspension of these talks (December 1957 
to September 1958), the Chinese denied that they had 
ever desired acceptance: "The Chinese people...have 
never been concerned about U.S. 'recognition.'" (People's 
Daily editorial of 18 August 1958) Mao's anti-U.S. 
obsession had deopened in the interval.

complexes, and on 1 September, Chou, trying to frighten 
neutrals into demanding a U.S. retreat, insisted 
that the PLA would take both com-
plexes by invasion. But Secretary Dulles' speech of 4 
September, in which he implied that the U.S. would regard 
an attack on Chinmen as preparation for an attack on Tai-
wan and therefore a reason for war, convinced Mao and 
Chou that the U.S. commitment to Chiang was solid. In 
their apparent view, it became necessary to convey to 
Washington a sign that Peking was willing to avoid a 
direct clash with U.S. military forces. But, short of 
that, Mao had PLA artillery keep the pressure on the 
Chinmen garrison, and he had his diplomats retain the 
atmosphere of war crisis, the latter being a form of 
international pressure on the U.S. 
In order to avoid a direct Sino-U.S. clash, the 
Communists officially declared (on 4 September) that 
Peking's territorial waters extend 12 miles from a base 
line drawn to include all coastal islands. The inten-
tion was to deter the Seventh Fleet from convoying Nation-
alist resupply vessels to the island garrisons. The 4 
September declaration warned the U.S. that "no airplane 
or military vessel of any foreign country" shall "enter 
the territorial waters of China or the skies above" with-
out Peking's permission. Mao and his aides also required 
a Soviet statement to keep the U.S. from supporting a 
Nationalist counterattack and attained this from Khru-
shchev when the American convoying activity began on 7 
September. 
In order to continue pressure on Chinmen and the 
Mat3us, Chou En-lai, in agreeing on 6 September to a 
resumption of ambassadorial-level talks with the U.S. 
--reaffirmed Peking's "absolute right" to take the"neces-
sary military action" against Nationalist forces on the 
offshores (even after the talks began). Artillery fire 
was sustained, hampering the Nationalist resupply ef-
fort--the necessary pressure preparatory to the 15 
September Sino-American meeting. 
In order to retain a tense atmosphere of war crisis, 
Chinese Communist statements claimed that convoying activity

by American forces would place the U.S. in a "most precarioilR 
situation involving direct armed conflict with China at 25X1 
any moment" (People's Daily editorial of 9 September).* 
Careful to control the risk of a clash with the 
U.S., the Chinese Communists used the leeway they had to 
continue military pressure on the Nationalist garrisons 
and psychological pressure on Washington. They clearly 
intended to use the general international atmosphere of 
apprehension to try to force a U.S.-supported withdrawal 
from theeffshores, Peking's propaganda in early, middle, 
and late September made a distinction between acquiring 
the offshores immediately and acquiring Taiwan later, the 
line having been that Chinumn and the Matsus were the 
"immediate threat" to the mainland while Taiwan was in 
the category of territory which would be "restored, sooner 
or later." 
Mao's effort became less risky but was not scrapped 
after Chou (on 6 September) had agreed to negotiations. 
On the contrary, the Warsaw talks became the venue for 
trying to attain an American surrender. As the day (15 
September) when Sino-American talks would begin moved 
closer, the Communists sustained their artillery inter-
diction effort against Nationalist re-supply vessels and 
the island garrisons, Mao apparently still viewed the 
*Convoying of Nationalist resupply vessels by U.S. Navy 
ships, which began on 7 September, had impelled the Chinese 
Communists to be more careful about provoking U.S. retali-
tation, but convoying did not make them back away from 
the interdiction effort. Shelling of Chinmen was stopped 
for one day, but was resumed on the following day, targeted 
against Nationalist re-supply vessels within the three-
mile area not covered by the U.S. convoying operation.

as containing a small degree of risk, parti-
cularly after American convoying activity began on 7 
September, and he may have asked for a Soviet statement 
of warning to Washington. In his first letter to Presi-
dent Eisenhower, Khrushchev on the 7th warned the U.S. 
against direct involvement which would lead to an Ameri-
can attack on the mainland: "An attack on the PRC...is 
an attack on the Soviet Union." The Chinese Communists 
exploited this statement extensively. American naval 
convoying continued up to the three-mile limit while 
Nationalist supply vessels dashed for Chinmen's beach, 
? 
occasionally receiving hits at the offloading area. The 
bombardment of Chinmen during a re-supply effort on 11 
September was one of the most intense delivered during 
? 
the crisis, the intention being interdiction while, on 
the same day, the U.S. was given Peking's "fourth warning" 
against convoying in mainland-claimed waters. Heavy 
and accurate artillery fire harassed Nationalist re-supply 
vessels on 13 and 14 September, and Mao apparently still 
believed that the U.S. might be induced in the Sino-Ameri-
can talks at Warsaw to apply pressure to Chiang for a 
withdrawal. 
Accommodation to Mao's demand was in effect the 
line advanced by Chou En-lai to worried neutrals after 
Wang Ping-nan on 15 September had probed Washington's  
willingness to retreat. Chou told 
that Peking can accept nothing less than the evacua-
tion of the offshores as a condition for ending the 
crisis and, in line with the Chinese Communist emphasis 
on the "immediate threat" from the offshores, Chou stated 
that his government would be willing to consider Taiwan 
as a "separate issue," subject to negotiation after set-
tlement of the immediate offshore island situation, or 
after an interval of perhaps "five years." Wang Ping-nan 
at W'rsaw reiterated Peking's refusal to agree to a 
cease-fire, the calculation being that this should be 
reserved as the price for a Nationalist withdrawal. 
Further pressure was required as well as a state-
ment warning against a major American military action, 
and this was supplied by Khrushchev in his letter of 19 
September to President Eisenhower. The Chinese Communists

had already extensively exploited Khrushchev's first warn-
ing that an attack on the mainland was an attack on the 
USSR and they went on to deny that Washington could impel 
Peking to back away from its effort by means of "atomic 
blackmail." Regarding his warning of the 19th--namely, 
that an atomic or hydrogen weapons attack on China would 
trigger "at once" a rebuff "by the same means" and "May 
no one doubt that we shall completely honor our commit-
ments" under the 1950 Sino-Soviet treaty--they used it 
as psychological-political support for their interdiction 
effort, warning the U.S. of retaliation "as Comrade Khru-
shchev" said in his letter. The People's Daily editorial 
of 21 September asserted that Chinmen and the Matsus are 
"situated in China's inland sea" and that attacks against 
Chinmen were part of a "civil war," implying that the U.S. 
should discontinue convoying activity. It distinguished 
between the immediate issue of the offshores and the 
long-range goal of seizing Taiwan. Khrushchev's letter 
of the 19th had been intended not only to deter a possible 
U.S. attack if a clash occurred, but also to bolster Peking's 
demand for 8 U.S. concession. It tried to convey the 
impression that accommodation to Peking's demand provided 
the only alternative to a major clash--the U.S. must with-
draw its forces from the area, and if such action were 
not taken, Peking "will have no other recourse but to 
expell the hostile armed forces from its own territory." 
There was a real possibility that the Nationalists 
would attack mainland artillery emplacements with air-
strikes, and the Communists noted that Chiang and his 
lieutenants were trying to convince U.S. officials of this 
necessity in mid-September. Peking viewed this prospect 
as leading to eventual American involvement in, or support 
of, the airstrikes. Khrushchev's warning, therefore, 
while specifying only U.S. military action against the 
mainland, was also intended to impel Washington to restrain 
Chiang from expanding the scope of hostilities. Moreover, 
the-antinuation of U.S. naval convoying activity and 
night air cover had confronted Mao with a military chal-
lenge he had been unwilling to meet with direct action, 
and the political-psychological fiction he had created 
of the American "paper tiger" was being exposed as just 
that--a fiction intended to conceal Peking's real military

inferiority and American superiority. Incongruously, the 
Chinese Communists leaned heavily on Khrushchev's deter-
rent statements to dispel the idea of their relative 
military weakness, and it is unlikely that they would 
have so conceded their reliance on Moscow if they had not 
been worried about a possible U.S.-Nationalist attack. 
Despite the increasing success of the Nationalists 
in resupplying their garrisons in late September, the 
Chinese Communists apparently hoped that temporary com-
pliance with the U.S. request for a cease-fire might get 
them the islands. Defense Minister Peng Te-hual-rilued 
a seven-day cease-fire order (on 6 October and extended 
on 12 October)/ 
 _// Militarily, 
Peng's order was intended to disengage the U.S. from 
any active support Of the Nationalist garrisons. Cessa-
tion of the shelling on condition that the U.S. discon-
tinue convoying activity provided a convenient way for 
Peking to further reduce the risk of a Sino-American 
clash. On 8 October, Peking issued its 24th "serious 
warning" against U.S. naval and air "intrusions." 
However, Washington's determination to support 
Nationalist garrisons (despite Khrushchev's lettci)-ind 
a new move by Asian and African neutrals to debate the 
situation in the UN apparently convinced Mao that the in-
terdiction effort not only had failed, but had created 
a new problem. This new problem was the appearance of 
neutral-initiated proposals for a "two Chinas" settle-
ment, using Peking's own distinction between the offshores 
and Taiwan as two separate issues. Chou En-lai and Chen 
Yi were given the task of keeping the issue out of the 
UN, insisting that Sino-American bilateral talks required 
no mediation by third parties. 
As the Chinese Communists retreated, they returned 
to their pre-September 1958 position, blurring the dis-
tinction between the long-range demand to acquire Taiwan 
and the "immediate" demand to get the offshores. By early

October, Taiwan and the offshores were wrapped together 
in an undifferentiated package, the message to neutrals 
being that the large island could not be separated from 
the offshore island issue and considered as a second 
China.* Khrushchev, aware of the retreat and the begin-
ning of the end of Mao's effort, tried to dissociate 
Moscow from the charge of intervention, making (in a speech 
on 5 October) his most explicit statement on the precise 
nature of the Soviet commitment. He had viewed the 
crisis as a "civil war," he said, and had committed the 
USSR only to defense of the mainland: "The USSR will 
come to the help of China if the latter is attacked from 
without; speaking more concretely, if the U.S. attacks 
China." By implication, he was also saying that Ameri-
can "interference" had not constituted a sufficient 
provocation to trigger his commitment of defense. 
Nevertheless, the Chinese Communist lcaders had 
viewed his September letters of deterrence as important 
and necessary, and on 15 October, Radio Moscow broadcast 
the text of a letter signed by Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi, 
and Chou En-lai to Khrushchev and Voroshilov. Dated 10 
*This concept of an undifferentiated offshores-Taiwan 
package was also used by Mao to justify his retreat from 
the effort to interdict the offshores. He told leaders 
of various Latin American Communist parties in an inter-
view on 3 March 1959 that "You know of the events of 
last year. On the island of Chinmen there are only 80,000 
people, and it now known to the world that the U.S. does 
not object to returning the islands of Chinren and Matsu 
to us, but in exchange they want to keep Taiwan for them-
selves. This would be a disadvantageous deal. It will 
be better if we wait. Let Chiang Kai-shek stay on Chin-
men and Matsu and we will get them back later together  
with the Pescadores Islands and Taiwan. We have a vast 
territory and we can live for the time being without these 
islands." (Interview extracts reprinted in Izvestiya of 
18 June 1959 as taken from article by Costa Rican Commun-
ist leader Eduard Moro Valverde) (emphasis supplied)

October, the letter expressed official gratitude for 
Soviet support and, specifically, for the statement by 
Khrushchev that "an attack against China was an attack 
against the Soviet Union." The letter referred to "U.S. 
military provocations" and suggested that Khrushchev's 
statement had been "very effective" in "forcing the ag-
gressors to think hard about their fate." When, there-
fore, during intense Sino-Soviet polemics in the fall 
of 1963, the Chinese leaders sarcastically stated that 
in 1958 there was no possibility that a nuclear war would 
break out and "no need for the Soviet Union to support 
China with its nuclear weapons," they omitted their use 
of Khrushchev's statements to try (1) to deter the U.S. 
from convoying activity and (2) to warn the U.S. to re-
strain Chiang from initiating airstrikes against mainland 
artillery emplacements.* The Chinese leaders also re-
mained silent on their quick action to extensively exploit 
Khrushchev's letters, particularly at a time when they 
were still demanding a major U.S. concession regarding 
the offshores. 
*The Maoist distortion of events was expressed in Pek-
ing's polemical government statement of 1 September 1963: 
"In August and September of 1958, the situation in the 
Taiwan Strait was indeed very tense as a result of the 
aggression and provocations by the U.S.imperialists. The 
Soviet leaders tKhrushchev] expressed their support for 
China on 7 and 19 September respectively. Although at 
that time the situation in the Taiwan Strait was tense,

out and no need for the Soviet Union to support China 
with 3ts nuclear weapons. It was only when they were

failed to mention the fact that the interdiction effort 
was sustained, and on some days intensified, after Khru-
shchev's letter of the 7th, that the Chinese Communists  
were not absolutely certain of immunity from Nationalist 
counteraction, and that Khrushchev had made the strong-

land ever articulated by a Soviet leader.

Mao's hope for a U.S. surrender further declined 
when the cease-fire orders of 6 and 12 October "to see 
what the opposite sidR was going to do" at Warsaw (quote 
from Peng Te-huai's shelling-halt order of the 12th) 
resulted only in sustained U.S. support for Chiang's 
desire to hold the offshores. Peking began to complain 
that the U.S. and Nationalist China were playing "a duet," 
with the U.S. expressing its desire to "reduce the Chiang 
army on Chinmen and the Matsus," while the Nationalists 
re-emphasized the importance of maintaining troops on 
these islands (People's Daily editorial of 21 October 
1958). Moreover, the Natioalists were claiming that 
the two cease-fire orders represented a "victory" for 
them. The Chinese Communists changed course temporarily 
to try to demonstrate that Pddng was not acing from weak-
ness (Peng Te-huai ordered resumption of shelling on the 
20th), but then reduced the entire situation to a low-
boil with an announcement on the 26th (clarifying Peng 
Te-huai's limited-shelling order of the 25th) to the 
effect that Chinmen would not be shelled "on even dates" 
on the calender. This was a political formulation of 
Mao's intended to (1) give credence to the claim that 
the Nationalists on Chinmen could maintain their garri-
son only by Communist sufferance, (2) retain flexibility 
to fire or not to fire without appearing to accept U.S. 
proposals for a de facto cease-fire, and (3) reduce ten-
sion in order to avoid the risk of expanded hostilities 
such as Nationalist counteraction supported by the U.S. 
D. The Retreat to Political Struggle (1958-62) 
Mao's effort was concluded. The problem became 
more political than ever before.* As on previous (and 
*Mao himself apparently marked out the general line 
of retreat by describing the matter as political and by 
pretending to be merely reducing the leVii-a-ifielling

ing the true scope of Mao443 failure, which he tried to 
do at a hastily convened meeting of CCP propaganda of-
ficials in November 1958, establishing a new line by using 
the retreat half of Mao's dialectical formulation that 
the U.S. as a "paper tiger," should be disparaged strategic-
any, "but taken into account tactically."(

1958] regarding the military struggle on the Fukien Front 
is an outstanding example of military struggle subordin-
ated to political struggle. At first, many foreign mili-
tary experts simply could not understand our method of 
fighting. They said that China's method of fighting is 
unprecedented in military history. They never heard of 
not shelling on even days, but shelling on odd days and, 
on no-shelling days, permitting the enemy to replenish 
ammunition. Later, they came to understand that our war 
is political war." (General Tu Ping article in New China 
Semi-Monthly of 10 July 1959) Typically, Mao's formula-
tion became a ritualistic concept and mere mention of an 
alleged breach of the policy it implied is now considered 
to be a major offense against Mao's strategic view. When, 
therefore, Lo Jui-ching was under attack for a whole 
range of "mistakes," included in the charges was that of 
a breach of discipline on this matter. Lo, it was claimed, 
failed to recognize that "the struggle in the Taiwan 
Strait is not simply a struggle against the Chiang Kai-
shek bandit gang, but primarily one against U.S. imperi-
alism. It is not simply a military problem, but primarily 
a political problem." (Peking Combat News article of 30

The failure of this effort was for Mao the signal 
to become more intransigent and to drop the step-by-step 
approach that had marked the Warsaw talks during the period 
from August 1955 to December 1957. He and his aides for-
mulated a new line, insisting that no real Peking-Washing-
ton discuosions (at Warsaw) could be held on small matters 
--that is, on the release of U.S. prisoners, exchange of 
newsmen, and visits of prominent Americans--until the basic 
matter of U.S. withdrawal from the Strait area was first

surrender without compromise. Mao had .Started on the road 
to taking even the pretense of flexibility out of the 
Chinese Communist negotiating position, and Chou had to 
discard the step-by-step approach.* 
E. Fear of Nationalist Attack (1962) 
In 1962, disillusionment in the party, PLA, and 
populace and economic dislocations disturbed the Chinese 
Communist leaders as they continued to tidy up the mess 
left by Mao's leap forward and commune policies. Their 
anxiety was augmented by the appearance of a small threat 
from India--firefights along the Sino-Indian border in 
the spring of 1962--and a larger assumed threat frow Tai-
wan, i.e., Nationalist plans for an invasion of the Fukien 
coast.** They viewed both threats as real and acted on 
*Of the few words Mao permitted Edgar Snow to quote 
from a long interview of October 1960, the following were 
included in his remarks on policy toward the U.S.: "Tai-
wan is China's affair. We will insist on this." 
**Chiang Kai-shek had in fact planned an increase in 
small-scale operations against the mainland. On 30 May, 
he told an American official that he had ordered Nation-
alist intelligence agencies to make intensive efforts to 
infiltrate agents onto the mainland. He said that the 
Nationalists should make repeated infiltration efforts, 
including numerous small airdrops, regardless of the cost.  
The Communist leaders apparently were not clear regard-
ing the size of the prospective Nationalist operations, 
but they adopted the strategy of expecting the worst--namely, 
big ones./

the view that the larger one could prove disastrous. They 
tried to deter the anticipated Nationalist invasion by 
building up a deterrent force in Fukien and by seeking

They later stated that they believed Chiang was 
gearing up for "an  invasion" in early April 1962 (Chou 
En-lais s statement on 15 Septem-
ber 1962). In early June, they began an air, sea, and 
land buildup of military forces in the Foochow !Vilitary

their buildup and by bluster, warning that an attack would 
be "suicide" in the face of the "overwhelming superiority

in a broadcast of the 23rd, and again in a major speech 
by Chen Yi on the 25th. Chen declared that if the U.S. 
persists in using the Nationalists "to impose war" on the 
Communists, Peking will have "no alternative but to go 
along with it to the very end." He implied that the Com-
munist buildup in Fukien was defensive in intent: Peking 
had been trying "to ease tension in the Taiwan area," 
had been engaged intalks with the U.S. for more than six 
years, and had been striving to attain "by peaceful means" 
a U.S. withdrawal from the area.* Despite Washington's 
initial assurance that the U.S. had no intention of pro-
viding Chiang with support (conveyed to the Chinese ambas-
sador in Warsaw privately on 15 June), the Communist 
leaders were not yet entirely convinced and continued 
to underscore U.S. responsibility for any invasion (Chen 
Yi and Tao Chu speeches of 1 July). By late June, they 
apparently believed that they had a sufficient number 
of forces in the region to deter an attack or to handle 
it if it came. 
The Chinese Communists, still angered by Khru-
shchev's anti-Albanian (read, anti-Chinese) performance 
at the 22nd CPSU Congress in October 1961, nevertheless 
implied Soviet support for their cause. No force on 
earth "can disrupt the great socialist camp" was Chen Yi's

Thailand into Laos while supporting a Nationalist inva-

1961, they invited frank, off-the-record discussions and 
said they warted a reduction of Sino-American tensions. 
Through mid-July 1962, they continued to state privately 
to U.S. officials their desire to reduce tensions, point-
ing with satisfaction to the settlement in Laos and sug-
gesting that "further understandings" could be attained  
with the U.S. /

way of hinting at international support (speech of 25 
June). But the Chinese leaders were not provided with 
a Soviet deterrent statement until after Washington had 
assured them of non-involvement in any Chiang invasion. 
In his speech of 2 July, Khrushchev tried to gain credit 
in the Communist movement at no real risk to Moscow for 
support of Peking, while in fact his warning was vague. 
In sharp contrast to the two letters he sent President 
Eisenhower in September 1958 regarding Soviet nuclear 
retaliation, Khrushchev, avoiding use of his old formula 
tion that an attack on the mainland was an attack on the 
USSR, stated ambiguously that China would be supported 
by the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc in administer-
ing a "crushing rebuff" (unspecified) to any attack on 
the mainland.* He did not refer to the Sino-Soviet treaty 
and used another weak locution: united Communist parties 
"reliably guarantee each socialist country from encroach-
ments by imperialist reaction." Aware of the absence of 
a specific Soviet nuclear threat to deter the U.S. and 
Nationalists, the Chinese Communists nevertheless tried 
to exptoit hts statement, giving it front-page coverage 
in People's Daily oli 4 July. The Chinese not only tried 
to squeeze some deterrentvalue from Khrushchev's vague 
statement, but also tried to puz the best face on strained 
Sino-Sovic.t relations, going so far as to imply praise 
*His exact words were: "He who dares attack the PRC 
will meet with a crushing rebuff from the great Chinese 
people, the peoples of the Soviet Union, and the entire 
socialist camp." Khrushchev's failure to mention the U.S. 
as the attacking party or as the ally supporting the 
prospective attackers contrasted sharply with the practice 
of the Chinese leaders in specifying the U.S.: "I must 
warn the U.S. government again that any military adventure 
undertaken by the Chiang gang, regardless of when it 
starts and on what scale, would be a responsibility of 
the U.S. government" (Chen Yi speech of 12 July). In 
Khrushchev's letters to President Eisenhower in September 
1958, there was no blurring of the reference to the U.S.  
as the prime target of hypothetical Soviet counteraction.

for Khrushchev--an unprecedented action after the behind-
the-scenes showdowns in June and November 1960 and the 
polemics at conferences in 1961 and 1962. Mao Tun, the 
Chinese delegate to the Moscow World Peace Congress, was 
quoted in Pravda on 8 July as saying that the Chinese 
people had received Khrushchev's speech "with great joy" 
and "are grateful to the Soviet people for their aid." 
Mao Tun represented Khrushchev as statilig that the USSR 
"is ready, if necessary, to come to the assistance of the 
Chinese people" and went on to warn that "The war gamblers 
will have to think twice after Nikita Khrushchev's speech." 
Peking's "joy" in receiving Khrushchev's speech was a 
line so contradictory to the internal Chinese line on 
Khrushchev that it was not carried in any Chinese Communist 
media. Mao Tun went on to pledge, by way of a reciprocal 
friendly action, "close cooperation" of his delegation 
with the Soviets at the Moscow World Congress for General 
Disarmament and Peace, although the Chinese had attacked 
Soviet disarmament policy earlier (in December 1961 at 
Stockholm). In a :statement at that time unprecedented 
in Pravda, Mao Tun openly referred to "alleged differences 
between Chinaand the USSR," implying falsely the exist-
ence of a working alliance. (This same delegation leader 
earlier had led a Chinese group in a clash with Soviet 
delegates over disarmament in Cairo at the Afro-Asian 
Writers Conference in February 1962.) 
Never again were the Chinese leaders to profess 
such goodwill to Khrushchev, as the mutual bond between 
Mao and Khrushchev continued to deteriorate into a rela-
tionship of inveterate hatred. :ally 1962 was the last 
time Mao permitted a degree of flexibility to be used in 
relations with him, the final favorable reference to him 
having been made by Chen Yi, who quoted Khrushchev on a 
"crushing rebuff," mentioning him by name--a reference, 
however, which was carried only to international audiences 
but not in the domestic version of Chen's 12 July speech. 
By that time, the Chinese leaders were resting some-
what easier and did not view an attack as imminent. Chiang 
Kai-shek had been strongly impressed by the major buildup 
in Fukien, and by mid-July, the Nationalists were moving 
at a slower pace in preparing operations. A cabinet member

obvious Soviet ambiguity on the USSR's military alliance

to touch one of us, we will stand together."* 
It was in this general defensive context that

press its claims to Nationalist held territory by the use 
of force and that Peking had not thus far sought a settle-
ment of the Taiwan issue by force, but the "whole situa-
tion would change" if the Nationalists attacked. On 20 
July, Chen Yi told Malcolm MacDonald that Peking would 
not attack Chinmen and the Matsus (meaning not now). This 
amounted to a renunciation of a temporary nature, being 
somewhat more explicit on not using force than Chou's 
major formulation of May 1955 (China is "willing to strive 
for the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means so far 
as this is possible"), and repeated by him, Mao, and Chen 
in 1959. It was also in this general context of anxiety 
that the Chinese leaders for the first time made state-
ments about U.S. policy regarding Taiwan in a vein of 
qualified approval. Chen Yi told newsmen at Geneva in 
late July that the U.S. had assured Peking at Warsaw it 
would not approve or support a Nationalist invasion; 
China appreciated this gesture "to a certain extent." 
"It is not bad of them." He later said; this U.S. as-
surance was "most welcome." (Chen Yi speech of 1 August; 
this favorable reference to the U.S. was not carried in 
Peking's domestic broadcast of his speech) 
In short, Mao and his lieutenants were more con-
cerned and uncertain about the regime's security in the 
summer of 1962 than at any other time in the post-Stalin 
period. He was impelled to sanction favorable refer-
ences to Moscow (Khrushchev) and Washington, his two 
major enemies. This unusual behavior again indicates that 
Mao's irrationality on the issue of a war to annex Taiwan 
does not extend to a death wish  and that he believes an 
American nuclear weapons attack against mainlandtargets  
would be disastrous and must be prevented by avoiding 
a direct provocation to U.S. military power in the Far 
East. And the Maoist position, expressed since the fall 
of 1958, exclusively in terms of absorbing a hypothetical 
U.S. invasion by falling back to the interior and conduct-
ing guerrilla warfare, is rhetorical "rubbish" (Khru-

*In this speech, Khrushchev reported that Mao had told 
him (apparently during the July-August 1958 discussions) 
that in the event of a U.S. attack, the USSR should not 
intervene. The Chinese, Mao continued, would fight alone 
and retreat as the Soviets had done when attacked by Ger-
many. According to Khrushchev, Mao was talking "rubbish" 
in an effort to rebut Marshal Zhukov'E, assertion that 
the USSR would defend China. Mao's statement was "rubbish" 
apparently because he deliberately avoided the real issue 
of a possible nuclear weapons attack (in which case, the 
Soviet nuclear deterrent was necessary for the defense 
of the mainland) and disc-jigged only on a possible U.S. 
ground invasion (in which case the PLA could handle the 
purely conventional man-for-man battles). 
Mao's strategy--to fight alone and retreat--is relevant 
only to a situation in which the Chinese Nationalists 
invade and are not supported by the U.S. nuclear capability. 
Strategy to meet a purely conventional-forces invasion 
apparently was discussed in the Chinese leadership in the 
spring and summer of 1962 during the Chinese Communist 
buildup for a possible large-scale Nationalist attack. 
Lo Jut-ching apparently argued for a plan to engage the 
Nationalists on the Fukien Front beaches--referred to as 
"blocking the water"--and Liu Shao-chi seems to have sup-
ported this view by arguing that "It will be bad if the 
enemy comes in." (People's Daily article of 7 September 
1967 attributes thele?g.ta.--Ttiegic views to Lo and Liu in

Piao) place a high value on caution and reluctance to take 
big risks. Although it can be argued that involvement 
in the Korean war was such a major risk, Mao and his lieu-
tenants apparently believed that the U.S. would keep the 
war limited to the peninsula and would not use its atomic 
weapons. That 's, they calculated, rightly, that the big 
battles would be fought by conventional armies with World 
War II tactics, providing them with an advantage in man-
power to make up for superior U.S. firepower. Mao did 
not take a great risk in October 1962 when he unleashed 
the PLA to sweep Indian units back from their border posi-
tions because in that assault the calculation was to make 
the enemy lose a quick-decision engagement, decisively, 
before the major powers (the U.S. and the UK) could decide 
on the best means to help in the remote Himalayan border 
area. 
Reckless ("adventurist") attacks and fighting-without-
preparation are two sins constantly criticized by Mao in 
his military writings. It is part of PLA military doc-
trine./

F. Sino-Soviet Differences on "Renunciation of 
Force" Issue (1954-64) 
It has always been a glaring contradiction in Sino-
Soviet foreign policy that the Taiwan issue was crucial 
to Peking's goals but rnly marginal (or of no importance 
whatsoever) to Moscow's goals. Even at an early date in 
the 1950s when relations were friendly, the Soviets were 
not enthusiastic, at one time expressing understanding 
and "support...for the liberation of Taiwan" (Khrushchev's 
speech in Peking on 30 September 1954) while avoiding 
support for the use of any means to seize the island, 
merely "recognizing the rights of China to the island" 
(Bulganin's statement at Geneva on 19 July 1955). The 
strongest Soviet statements of support, made by Khru-
shchev in September 1958, had centered on defense of the 
mainland and may have been soli.ited (if rot demanded) by 
the Chinese leaders rather than freely given by the Rus-
sians. Their primary purpose--namely, to sustain the 
Sino-Soviet relationship as a meaningful alliance--was 
no longer compelling after Mao began to attack Khrushchev's 
policies in 1959-60. 
Mao, obsessed with the need to sustain rather than 
reduce international pressures on Washington, had rejected 
Khrubhchev's temperate policy of 1959. His rejection was 
converted to hostility when, in October 1959 in Peking, 
the Soviet leader made a strong plea for compromise, sug-
gesting that the Taiwan issue should be settled by 'negotia-
tions or shelved. The Chinese subsequently have claimed 
that in the talks, Khrushchev stated that the issue was 
"an incendiary factor" on the international scene which 
could lead to "a great war" because of the conflict between 
U.S. support for Taipei and Soviet support for Peking.

there is more than one way to solve every 
complicated question, depending on what 
basis you took. For example, after the 
October Revolution, there was established 
in the Soviet Far East the Far Eastern 
Republic, and Lenin recognized it at the 
time; this was a temporary concession and 
sacrifice, but later on it was united with 
Russia. (Quoted in the Chinese government 
statement of 1 September 1963) 
For Mao, there was only one way (eventual seizure), and 
to be told that "concession and sacrifice" was another 
way was tantamount to asking him to accept the Nationalist 
regime permanently. The Chinese complained that Khru-
shchev, by taking this stand, in effect had asked them 
to agree to a "two Chinas" situation. The Soviets did 
not deny that Khrushchev had raised the Taiwan issue, 
but they did deny he had suggested a "two Chinas" settle-
ment. Nevertheless, their version--namely, that he 
merely touched on possible ways to solve the matter, these 
being not only military, but peaceful, too (Soviet govern-
ment statement of 21 September 1963)--was an evasion. 
Khrushchev was aware that a "peaceful" solution neces-
sarily included a pledge to renounce the use  of force, 
that is, to accept the status of Taiwan. The Chinesegovernment statement warned that the CCP "has not for-
gotten and never will forget" this plan for "two Chinas."* 
*Atcepting the status quo indefinitely had been attacked 
as a view of "some people" in private Chinese Communist 
materials prior to publicizing Khrushchev's suzerainty

\Non-support of the Taiwan issue was one of 
the many deprivations which Mao suffered as he disputed 25X1 
with the Soviet leader on basic international strategy. 
Khrushchev tried to undercut the general basis of Mao's 
position on his "right" to capture Taiwan; his proposal 
of 31 December 1963 to heads of states calling for a peace-

rejection of the Chinese leader's refusal to renounce

but no island off the Soviet coast," implying that unlike 
Soviet-U.S. interests, Sino-American interests clash 
directly on a territorial matter. Khrushchev in 1962, 
on the other hand, seemed to be arguing that Washington-
Moscow relations should not be as tense as Washington-
Peking relations primarily because territory was not an 
issue. "Our interests do not clash directly anywhere, 
either territorially or economically." (Quoted in Pravda,

inflexibility of Mao's position to the ridicule of other 
national leaders.) Mao responded by having his clever-
est lieutenant declare, on 24 April 1964, that "boundary 
questions" can be solved peacefully, but questions of 
"imperialist occupation" are different. Chou En-lai in-
sisted that countries whose territories were occupied 
naturally have every right to recover their 
lost territories by any means. To ask those 
countries...to renounce the use of force in 
any circumstances is in fact to ask their 
people. .,.to submit to imperialist enslavement.

G. Future of the Taiwan Issue and Sino-American 
Relations 
This pugnacious insistence on the right to use 
force against Taiwan probably will not be dropped or 
moderated so long as Mao lives. Only a less stubborn 
and more moderate man than Mao would be willing to re-
nounce force on this issue, or act as if such a renuncia-
tion is implicit in his position. Mao's pugnacious 
view has set the pattern for his aides thus far. Reject-
ing any mutual concessions, they apparently see no change 
in the status of the island at least for "10 or 20 years" 
Chen Yi's statement to newsmen on 23 July 1962). They 
have only a very faint glimmer of hope that a National-
ist or Taiwanese insurrection will occur, and they dis-
cuss the matter in a  long-range and very indefinite his-
torical perspective.i

to insist on a U.S. surrender and will continue to reject 
any American initiatives which fall short of indicating 
willingness to withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area.* 
Chou En-lai made this clear to Edgar Snow in October 1960.** 
He made it clear again in his report to the National Peo-
ple's Congress on 21 December 1964: all U.S. armed forces 
should withdraw from Taiwan; prior to the settlement of 
this "fundamental problem, the settlement of concrete 
problems in Sino-American relations is out of the ques-
tion." The Chinese Communists had already acted on this 
line, rejecting U.S. overtures (in 1960) for visits to 
the mainland of prominent Americans. 
We have received bids from Americans to 
visit our country. We have welcomed left-
ist Americans, but we have no interest in 
American leaders. We reveal this to you 
for the first time We were notified of 
the wishes of Democrat Stevenson, Mrs. 
Roosevelt, former New York Governor Harri-
man, and five Republican senators to visit 
our country.... 
U.S. imperialism still occupies our Taiwan 
and adopts an unfair attitude toward China. 
If we were to welcome them, it would be 
tantamount to yielding to U.S. imperialism. 
(Chen Yi interview of 21 November 1960) 
*Regarding the possible expansion of Sino-American 
talks, he has had his spokesmen reject it: talks will 
continue but "We will not have talks other than those 
in Warsaw." (Chen Yi statement 
in the first week of September 1966) 
**In addition to Chou's own remarks, his secretary, 
Chiang HsiLo-mai, told Snow that it was true that Peking 
had not provided U.S. policy-makers with a rear exit.

out of Taiwan for the Americans. They will eventually

The Chinese Communists have also refused entry to 
less prominent Americans, particularly when there has been 
publicity on their pending visit which reflected favorably 
on Washington. For example, following a renewed invita-
tion by Peking to ear specialist Dr. Samuel Rosen of 
Colombia University in March 1964, publicity in December 
regarding official validation of his trip for humanitarian 
reasons rankled the Chinese leaders, who demanded that 
he cancel his trip, the implication being that it might 
make the U.S. look good. ("Washington is trying to make 
use of friendly contacts between Chinese and American 
scientists to gain political benefits." NCNA dispatch 
of 20 December 1964) Nevertheless, to gain "political 
benefits" for themselves, the Chinese leaders had pre-
viously insisted on a formal agreement for exchange of 
newsmen because this would imply official U.S. recogni-
tion of their regime and create strains in Washington-
Taipei relations. 
Peking has made clear Mao's reason for remaining 
inflexible on exchanges. They can begin only after the 
U.S. surronders on the Taiwan issue. Peking's public com?
ment on the State Department's announcement of 27 Decem-
ber 1965, which eased passport restrictions against the 
travel of doctors and public health specialists to the 
mainland, reflected sensitivity to having been depicted 25X1 
(rightly) as the intransigent party. ("Nauseating hypro-

exposed, and when Washington in March 1966 (following

American policy," (Wen We Pao editorial of 16 March 
1966), and their commentaries reflected concern that this 
view might prevail in neutral and some Western countrias: 
"Surely nobody will allow himself to be fooled" was the 
defensive comment of People's Daily on 29 March 1966. 
The party paper on that date also reflected con-
cern over the reception that this U.S. line might get 
affiong :hinese on the mainland, the sensitivity displayed 
reflecting Mao's suspicion that there might be a reduction 
of anti-U.S. sentiment internally at a time when he was 
trying to wall-off the PLA, CCP, and populace from the 
Western idea of a possible 'peaceful evolution" in the 
attitudes of mainland officials. Although the 29 Yarch 
article stated that Washington's desire to increase con-
tacts could not change the hostile attitude of Chinese, 
it seemed to be warning as well that this attitude should 
not change: "The U.S. imperialists think that by mirETNIT 
some 'contact' and 'visits' they could weaken the revolu-
tionary will of the great Chinese people and shake their 
firm stand of combating U.S. imperialism and supporting 
the revolutionary struggle of all peoples. ....The Chinese 
people are sober-minded. Neither will they be intimidated 
by U.S. imperialism's threats, nor will they believe in 
'find words.'" Another article seemed to be directed 
precisely at reminding Chinese that they had a "high 
degree of hatred, scorn and contempt for the U.S." and 
had completely wiped out ideas oW admiring, pleasing, 
and fearing" the U.S. (Liberation Army Daily editorial 
of 6 April 1966). In short, Peking's reaction to Washing-
ton's statements and the testimony of academic f: was re-
markably irritable and seemed to reflect Mao's morbid 
anxiety that the combat zeal and self-sacrificing mental-
ity he was trying to sustain among Chinese on the main-
land would be diluted if young Chinese officials and 
cadres were to begin to view the U.S. with any degree 
of moderation and reasonableness. He was well aware 
that fanatical hostility is an attitude very difficult 
to sustain over long periods of time, and that this:is 
particularly true if it has to be sustained artifically 
(through propaganda and the exclusion of external in-
fluences).

The article of 29 March made a distinction between 
big and small issues. Continued strains in Sino-American 
relations did not stem from disagreement on exchanges of 
doctors or newsmen, but rather "primarily from U.S. oc-
cupation" of Taiwan. It reiterated the basic line of the 
post-1958 period: "So long as the U.S. government does 
not change its hostile policy toward China and refuses 
pull out its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan 
Strait, the normalization of Sino-U.S, relations is en-
tirely out of the question and so is the solution of such  
a concrete question as the exchange of visits between  
personnel of the two countries." (emphasis supplied) 
On 0 April, Peking attacked the State Department's an-
nouncement on inviting Chinese scientists to visit U.S. 
universities, making it clear that small steps were re-
jected (while, in doing so, further exposing itself as 
the intransigent party). On the matter of possible ex-
changes in the future, it seems clear that only more 
moderate leaders, who, by Mao's death, have been released 
from the restrictions of Mao's Taiwan obsession, might 
be willing to change the obdurate policy. Mao apparently 
will not in his lifetime, and in an attack on Liu Shao-chi, 
his propagandists have implied that even a U.S. withdrawal 
from Taiwan would not lead to the "development of friendly 
relations." (People's Daily article of 16 October 1966)*

*Regarding possible Sino-American trade, Chen Yi pub-
licly attacked the idea: "Frankly speaking, some Chinese 
democrats maintain that the improvement of Sino-U.S, re-
lations will prove advantageous to China. They are right, 
because we would be admitted to the UN, be able to import 
machines, and obtain American loans; but we do not seek 
such petty profits. Our political stand is to oppose 
? imperialism and colonialism in the world. Political value 
outweighs economic value." (Interview of 21 November 1960) 
Regarding possible U.S. aid to Peking, Chen Yi stated?that 
? "Even if we receive aid from somewhere, we will refuse 
American aid. The American plan to utilize food for peace 
[President Kennedy's expressed willingness to send food 
as stated on 25 January 1961j is a plan for subversion 
and designed to open the way for American occupation."

The Issue of UN Entry 
A. The Demand for Prior Expulsion of the Nationalists 
(1950-64) 
Mao has been aware of the prestige which a place 
on the Security Council reflects, and he has complained 
about the "thPft of China's UN seat" (interview with 
Mitterand as reported in TASS dispatch of 23 February 
1961). But his obsession regarding no compromises with 
Chiang has impeded, at certain times, his effort to at-
tain the expulsion of the Nationalist representative from 
the UN. He seems to have become more adamantly opposed 
to any "two Chinas" situation in the UN as his obsession 
developed further. in November 1950, he had permitted 
his aides to accept an invitation to participate in the 
UN debates on Korea, but in 1955, his aides had to refuse 
another UN invitation to participate in Security Council 
debate over the Taiwan Strait crisis.* Mao seems also 
to have become more deprecatory of the value of the UN. 
At an earlier time, his spokesmen had conceded the import-
ance of the international organization.** But UN discus-
sion over the years of issues related to Peking's interetts, 
*On 3 February 1955, Chou En-lai stated that "only when 
the representative of the Chiang clique has been driven 
out from the Security Council and the representative of 
the PRC is to attend in the name of China, can the PRC 
agree to send a representative to take part in the discus-
sions of the Security Council..." This was Chou's reply 
to Secretary General Hammarskjold's invitation of 31 Jan-
uary 1955, reflecting Mao's anti-"Two Chinas" obsession. 
**"Although the UN, as a result of US manipulation, has 
time and again been used to serve American policy, it still 
has an important position in international affairs. It 
is possible to make the UN play its role in benefitting 
world peace." (People's Daily editorial of 2 December

and criticism of Peking's abominations on the international 
scene, have impelled Mao and his aides to profess lack 
of interest in pressing for the seat which they say is 
lawfully theirs. Following the vigorous Maoist suppres-
sion of the Tibetan rebellion in the spring of 1959, and 
anticipating UN criticism of this suppression in the fall 
meeting of the General Assembly, Chou En-lai in August 
1959 told that he should not 25X1 
emphasize India's action in placing the matter of repre-
sentation before the UN, as Peking "is not now nvc.cly 
anxious to join." When General Assembly censure was pub-
licized, Peking's response was to deprecate the UN: the 
resolution on Tibet "will only further lower the prestige 
of the UN in the oyes of the Chinese people..." (PRC 
government statement of 23 October 1959) 
Mao's obsessive refusal to accept any "two Chinas" 
representation situation in the UN--an acceptance which 
might force Chiang to withdraw his representative--has 
led to an immobile policy justified only by the long-
range calculation that obduracy will pay off eventually.* 
He has suggested the setting up of a rival UN, as had 
Khrushchev. Mao told Edgar Snow on 22 October 1960 that 
he could form his own UN. 
*Most UN members favor a "two Chinas" resolution, and 
if one were introduced, it almost certainly would receive 
a majority or even a two-thirds vote. Chiang probably 
would not aCcept entry of Mao's representatives and would 
withdraw his delegation if Mao's were permitted to sit 
in the UN. However, Mao is also unwilling to accept even 
a temporary "two Chinas" situation in the international 
organization and refused to join until Chiang's men are 
expelled. He will not permit his aides to use flexible 
tactics because, unlike bilateral relations with some 
individual countries, he cannot be certain that Chiang 
will withdraw his representatives. He cannot risk a 
temporary "two Chinas" situation because his attitude 
toward the organization would receive far more interna-
tional publicity than his action toward individual coun-
tries.

But he has had his aides work to defeat U.S. efforts 
to exclude Peking from the organization. Even after the 
setback forced on him by the "important question" tactic,* 
his aides have worked to gain support from such countries 
as Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Nigeria.  
But they have insisted on Mao's obsession.

foreign policy in the fall of 1964 and the wild "revolu-

*In 1956, as new members joined the UN, the vote in 
favor of putting off debate of the Chinese representa-
tion question (i,e., the procedural device known as the 
moratorium) began to decline. This took place primarily 
because the new, Afro-Asian members actively worked for 
Peking's entry. The voting margin on the moratorium in 
1960 was so slim that in 1961 it was found advisable to 
abandon the moratorium device and for the first time to 
deal directly with the substantive question itself. This 
"important question" of changing the representation of 
China in the UN required the approval of two-thirds of 
those present and voting, and use of the "important ques-
tion" tactic since 1961 has set back Mao's effort to gain 
admission on his own uncompromising terms.

countries to withdraw from the UN. Sukarno's move in 
pulling his delegation out of the UN on 7 January 1965 
provided Mao and his aides with the opportunity to at-
tack the organization openly and to demand thnt it should 
be "thoroughly reorganized." (PRC government statement 
of 10 January 1965) Mao personally seems to have fired 
the first shot in Peking's open attack, as witness the 
rusticisms published in the major deprecatory documents.* 
He insisted that other countries must view Sukarno's 
action as a precedent: 
If a country throws off its blind faith in 
the UN, recognizes its true essence, and 
dares to fight against U.S. imperialist con-
trol of the organization, the latter can 
do nothing about it. Don't you see that 
U.S. imperialism was seized with panic the 
moment Indonesia announced its withdrawal 
from that organization? ...This is a 
courageous, just, and revolutionary preced-
ent. (People's Daily editorial of 10 
January 007-Temphasis supplied) 
*Only the barnyard phrases of Mao would have been 
printed on the front page of the People's Daily and in 
major official statements. The party paper on 10 Janu-
ary front-paged his distinctive scatological style. 
"Some people say that the UN is something formidable, 
and that the buttocks of a tiger must not be touched: 
But President Sukarno has touched the buttocks of this 
tiger. This greatly helps liquidate the blind faith in 
the UN." (PRC government statement of 10 January) "In 
their efforts to overawe and attack Indonesia, the US 
and British imperialists have militarily massed a heavy 
force and turned 'Malaysia' into a bridgehead, and, 
have politically thrust it into the UN Security Council 
to raise its status. This is like sh g on one's head 
while pointing a sword at his throat.17--(people's Daily

Mao attacked the argument that withdrawal is wrong and 
implied that the newly independent countries might want 
to followthe Indonesian precedent: "think it over: what 
has this so-called world organization been reduced to 
after all!" (PRC government statement of 10 January) 
He insisted that "now is the time" to end U.S. influ-
ence ("control") and to effect "a thoroughgoing remold-
ing of this so-called world organization" (People's Daily 
editorial of 10 January). He did not immediately sur-
face his idea--expressed in 1960 to Edgar Snow--of form-
ing his own UN. 
By late January, however, Chou En-lai apparently 
was directed to float it as a trial balloon.  
I* Chou 
was impelled to use arrogant ("revolutionary") language 
--which was tactless and harmful to Peking's image on 
the international scene--expressing Mao's desire to create 
a rival organization: 
The UN must correct its mistakes. It must 
be reorganized ..Another UN, a revolution-
ary one, may well be set up so that rival 
dramas may be staged in competition with 
that body,.. (Speech of 24 January 1965)

UN, and Chen Yl sustained the new line.* By February, in 
the course of making, to Afro-Asians, a thinly veiled 
demand for withdrawal. Chou complained that 
some African and Asian countries believe that 
it is better to carry out the struggle inside 
the UN by making corrections. Let us invite 
them to do so. Indonesia has tried to do the 
same thing, without results, and therefore 
has withdrawn from the UN. Also, we Chinese 
have tried to do so, without results. Indo-
nesia and the PRC have experience in this 
matter. We now no longer have trust in the 
UN. (Interview with Indonesian journalists 
published in Harian Rakjat and broadcast on 
3 February 19-65) 
He went on to try to mollify these countries by professing 
non-interference with their refusal to withdraw--"We are 
not going to obstruct them"--and then invited them to 
choose one of "two roads." Chou suggested that they 
either "reorganize and retool" the UN or consider the 
formation of "a revolutionary UN outside the existing 
*"Indonesia's withdrawal from the UN is the first step 
that will promote such a reorganization. Consideration 
can also be given to the setting up of a revolutionary 
UN which will differ from the one manipulated by the U.S." 
(Chen Yl speech of 26 January 1965) Chen had been impelled 
by Mao's new line to go beyond mere support for Afro-Asian 
efforts to increase their seats in major UN organs on "a 
fair and reasonable basis" (Chen's speech of 2 October 
1963) to a more hectoring position which suggested with-
drawal and forming a rival UN. (In December 1963, the 
Chinese Communists had been anxious to cultivate Afro-
Asian opinion and even informed Moscow that they agreed 
to a separation of the issues of expanding the Security 
Council and ECOSOC prior to the PRC entry into the UN.)

UN."* But regarding a Chinese Communist initiative to 
call a conference with the intention of establishing a 
rival UN, Mao apparently was advised against it. Chen 
Yi told  in mid-March 1965 that 
"For the time being China will abstain from taking such 
a step" because "it is necessary to secure the agreement 
of all"--a clear sign of Chen's awareness of significant 
international opposition to Mao's new obsession. Short 
of acting to try to set up a rival UN, Chen said that 
countries in the UN "should lead a campaign from within 
to reorganize it, while China and the countries that 
are not in the UN should foretell, from without, its 
reorganization." Wary of adverse international criticism 
which had developed, Chen concluded by suggesting that 
pullouts would occur in the future, not because of pres-
sure from Peking, but because "it is natural." 
In sum, Chou and Chen had implied that Peking 
was not seeking entry and they had stated that Peking 
would remain outside and would demand a reorganization.** 
Thus Mao's basic position on the UN had become more 
adamant, and he was far out of step with international 
*A variant formulation implied but did not state the 
demand for a rival UN. It declared that either the UN 
"corrects its mistakes and is thoroughly reorganized 
with the desire of the peoples, or it continues to sub-
mit to the dictates of the U.S. and thereby commits 
suicide; there is no other way." (People's Daily Irticle 
"of TFTebruary 1965) (emphasis supplied) Cffra-ge Com-
munist comment had not yet defined the word, "reorganized," 
which was in fact a euphemism for the process of expell-
ing the Chinesc Nationalists. 
**Regarding Mao's intention to stay out, Chou hinted 
at it in an interview on 3 February 1965: "Indonesia has 
withdrawn from the UN. Is it thinkable that the PRC will 
join the UN?" It is important that Chou did not say what 
Mao would do if Peking were voted in on his own uncom-
promising terms--i.e., voted in at the same time that the 
Nationalist delegation was expelled.

pose his view and in displaying arrogant ("revolutionary") 
contempt for all opposition. In an interview on 24 March 
1965 with a Palestine Liberation Organization delegation, 
Mao complained that the UN was "an illegal organization," 
and told the delegation that "You Arabs are the nucleus 
of a new organization which will be better and more repre-
sentative than the present UN organization, We shall 
all together create such an organization," The idea ex-
pressed in the final sentence was contemptuous of condi-
tions in the real world, 
A "revolutionary" anti-Western UN had become an 
obsession; like his other obsessions, this one reflected 
his image of himself as a super-revolutionary who will 
fight all existing odds and who is buoyed up in the fight 
primarily by the unwarranted belief that the odds will 
fall his way in the future. Further, this obtession 
influenced his foreign policy toward neutrals, In this 
sense, his mood was one of irrationality because he was 
willing to injure his current policy (by harassing and 
even insulting certain friendly neutral governments 
which insisted on remaining inside the organization) in 
the hope of an illusory future advance. For example, in 
mid-April 1965, Algerian Foreign Ministgr Bouteflika com-
plained to the U.S. ambassador in Algiers that the Chinese 
Communis were trying to muster support for the idea of 
a "revolutionary" UN, but Bouteflika, reflecting his 
government's increasing disenchantment with Mao, told the 
Chinese that instead of trying to take countries out of 
the UN, they should work with others to get the PRC into 
that organization,* 
*But Mao was_controfled by his obsession. Rather than 
adjust and jettison his idea, he persisted. On 11 May, 
the Chinese Communist delegate to the 4th AAPSO Conference 
in Ghana set forth the entire arrogant Maoist position 
on the UN's "crimes," "mistakes," and need for "reorgani-
zation," warning that "it may be necessary to consider 
the establishment of revolutionary UN as a rival drama." 
This gaucherie provided the -loviets with the opportunity 
to join with delegates from several African countries 
to attack Mao's idea.

Chou En-lai, who probably took a calmer and more 
balanced view of the UN issue than Mao, was impelled gradu-
ally to harden his position. He probably was more aware 
and concerned than Mao that it would be irrational to dis-
card the former position (already inflexible and injurious 
to Peking's interests) and implement a new position (even 
more inflexible and injurious). He seems to have held 
to the former position, namely, that Peking would join  
the UN if the Nationalists were expelled from it/ 
 /The former position was retained in 
April, and as late as 1 September Peking's public posi-
tion suggested that expulsion of the Nationalists was 
still the only real precondition for joining.* Chou had 
been equivocal on the matter of Peking's desire to join.

he would not insist on entry, and on the other hand as-
suring in July that his government was mildly 
interested in joining the UN if it were reorganized; he 
*The only explicitly stated precondition for entry 
had been expulsion of the Nationalists. "...the Chinese 
government declared long ago that China will have nothing 
to do with the UN as long as the latter, under the thumb 
of the US, refuses to restore to China its legitimate 
rights in it and to throw out the representative of the 
Chiang Kai-shek gang from all its organizations. This 
firm stand of ours is unshakable..." (People's Daily 
editorial of 12 April 1965) (emphasis supplied)--Ii-late 
as September, Chinese commentary still centered on one 
"mistake" made by the UN: "One of the serious mistakes 
it has committed is that the PRC...has long been deprived 
of its legitimate rights in the UN, whereas the Chiang 
Kai-shek clique, repudiated by the Chinese people, has 
up until now usurped China's seat there....The UN must 
correct this serious mistake by ousting the Chiang Kai-
shek clique and restoring to the PRC its legitimate 
rights." (NCNA "Statement" of 1 September 1965) The 
other "mistakes" were not articulated. Although the 
still vague concept of UN "reorganization" was reiterated, 
it was not made a precondition for entry.

view) for moving the UN from New York to a neutral site, 
such as Geneva. Peking praised Ne Win's call for the 
"urgent restoration" of PRC rights in publicizing the 
Siro-Burmese communique of 1 August. However, after the 
Fmnch weekly, Le Nouvel Observateur, on 24 August claimed 
that Malraux had been told by the Chinese leaders that 
if Peking were reinstated as a full member of the Security 
Council, there would be an appropriate framework for dis-
cussing Vietnam within the UN--after this claim, Chou 
moved to the harder position, On 12 September, Chou, 
after trying to clear his name with Mao and to mollify 
Sukarno by attacking the idea of "linking" restoration 
of Peking's "legitimate rights" in the UN with the settle-
ment of the Vietnam war, demanded (in replying to questions 
of a news agency editor) the voiding of the UN resolution 
condemning Peking for its attack in Korea. However, he 
did not say that this was a precondition for Peking entry.* 
The only explicitiy cited precondition, as precondition, 
continued to be expulsion of the Nationalists and restora-
tion of the Communists' claimed seat. 
Despite the fact that Chen Yi, in his important 
press conference of 29 SeptPmber 1965, raised new demands, 
he did not say they were preconditions for Peking's entry 
into the organization.** He downplayed the idea of a

imprecise on what Peking meant by "reforming" or "reor-
ganizing" the UN, reiterating that the aim of such an 
overhaul would be to end U.S. "control." However, he 
hinted that Peking would not agree to enter even if the 
Nationalists were expelled and Peking's "rights" were 
restored becnv,......r. the matter of U.S. "control., .would still

which is the absolute prerequisite for Peking's entry, 
the Maoist position is ambiguous on when the abovementioned 
demands must be implemented. The Chinese Communists them-
selves might rationalize any future act of joining by argu-
ing that they would work to reorganize the UN from within, 
as they had suggested, from time to time, that other coun-
tries should do just that. They published Sihanouk's 
statement of 24 September 1965 that Cambodia had not with-
drawn: "It remains there so as to wage a struggle of non-
cooperation for the reorganization of the UN, turn it into 
a universal organization, and thus fulfill the mission 
laid down by the UN Charter." 
*Soviet statements began gradually 
to downplay the standard line of expelling the National-
ists following Gromyko's New York press conference of 12 
October 1962, when he failed to call for expulsion in com-
menting on the representation issue. This reflection of 
Khrushchev's dispute with Mao was carried over into the 
post-Khrushchev period, but for tactical reasons, the new 
Soviet leadership has not replaced the standard position 
with a "two Chinas" position. The most explicit and 
sharpest Peking complaint regarding declining Soviet 
enthusiasm attacked Grcmyko and Federenko for their cri-
tical and perfunctory speeches in the 1965 UN sessions,

obduracy had not hurt his cause, and the People's Daily  
editorial of 19 November claimed that there had been 
slippage in the U.S. position as a result of the General 
Assembly vote, which it depicted as a "humiliating set-
back" to efforts aimed at keeping Peking from taking its 
"rightful place."* The editorial set forth the signifi-
cant distinction basic to Peking's position, namely, the 
difference between the absolute prerequisite of expelling 
the Nationalists, on the one hand, and a series of demands, 
on the other hand. 
To return to the path of its purposes and 
principles, the UN zw.Ist free itself from the 
control of the U.S., rectify all its mistakes, 
and undergo a thorough reorganization and 
reform. To expel the elements of the Chiang 
Kai-shek clique from the UN and restore its 
lawful rights to China is an indispensable  
step for the UN to rectify its mistakes and 
undergo a thorough reorganization. 
But merely doing this is far from enough. 
The UN must also resolutely condemn U.S. 
imperialism, the biggest aggressor of con-
temporary times, and cancel its slanderous 
resolution condemning China and the DPRK 
as aggressors and all its other erroneous 
resolutions. The UN Charter must be reviewed 
and revised by all countries of the world.

issue is an "important question" and thus needs a two-

vote--i.e., the vote on the resolution calling for expul-
sion of the Nationalists--taken in the General Assembly

Its membership must include all independent

While Mao has adopted a posture of indifference, and even 
contempt, for joining--"As a matter of fact, the U.S. may 
keep China out of the UN for 1,000 or even 10,000 years 
without harming China one iota," (People's Daily editorial 
of 19 November)--he has permitted his spokesmen to sustain 
a distinction which could be used as justification for 
entry at some future date,* 
As with other foreign policy positions which have 
been predominantly irrational, Mao has permitted a small 
part to be rational. He has permitted his aides to stress 
the rational part when Peking seemed to be gaining new 
votes. For example, still exuberant over the increase in 
General Assembly support, Chou stated that "of late, during 
the 20th session of the UN General Assembly, Albania and 
Cambodia, together with many other countries, persisted 
in the fight to expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique and to 
restore to China its legitimate rights in the UN" (Speech 
of 29 November 1965), The ideas of withdrawal for other 
countries and a rival UN were drastically soft-pedalled 
in subsequent months, and no mention was made of the 
specific series of demands raised by Chen Vi on 29 Septem-
ber. Indonesia returned to the UN in 1966, and this

Cheng-chih interview with Japanese journalists published

say what Peking's reaction would be if the Nationalists 
were expelled, that is, whether this very act would not 
be used by Mao and his aides as the opportunity for de-

down-playing procedure was carried through to the time 
of the General Assembly meetings in 1966. It was sus-
tained even when Peking, in a commentary on 22 November 
1966, denounced the Italian "study committee" proposal 
and, in a commentary on the 24th, denounced Canada's 
"two Chinas" plan; Chen's demands were not revived. 
Peking demanded only the expulsion of the Nationalists 
and, vaguely, called for an end to American and Soviet 
use of the UN as a political "marketplace." This prac-
tice was retained even after the Albanian resolution, 
calling for expulsion of the Nationalists and seating 
of the Communists, was rejected on 29 November 1966 by 
a 57-46 majority. (Peking did not acknowledge the magni-
tude of the defeat, and the silence maintained by its 
media for two days thereafter strongly suggested that 
Mao and his aides had anticipated a favorable vote and 
were exasperated by their setback. Peking's greatest 
loss of supporters was among the African countries, where 
leaders had been angered by Chinese Communist appeals for 
"revolution" on the continent and by Peking's political 
interference in the war over Kashmir territory.) Peking 
on 1 and 2 December 1966 broke silence, but merely re-
peated the old demands for ending U.S. "control" and for 
reorganizing the UN and rectifying its "mistakes." The 
commentaries did not raise all of the demands that Chen 
Yi had publicized on 29 September 1965, and they did not 
say, as he had, that Peking "may as well stay out of a 
UN like this."

1967 reception in Peking for visiting President Kaunda 
of Zambia, repeated what he had said (on 24 January 1965): 
regarding the struggle of Afro-Asian nations inside the 
UN if the goal of reorganization is not attained, "then 
the possibility that a new revolutionary UN will be set 
up will increase." This act of revival suggests that the 
Chinese Communist leaders will continue to reassert vari-
ous parts of the adamant Maoist position at various tines 
while Mao lives, professing only a qualified desire to 
enter the UN. However, when General Assembly voting is 
about to begin every fall, they will probably continue 
to agree to have one of their supporters--most likely, 
the Albanians--introduce the standard resolution calling 
for the restoration of their "legitimate seat" and expul-
sion of the Nationalist representative from the organiza-

III. Diplomatic Isolation of Taipei 
A, Breaking Relations With Taipei 
Even before the Seventh Fleet was positioned as 
a blocking force against Communist invasion, Mao had begun 
his effort to isolate Taipei among the nations by denying 
it was in any sense the government of China, insisting 
that other governments make a similar denial. He did 
not, however, say when this denial must be made and his 
ambiguity on this -Poiiit was deliberate, reflecting one 
of the most flexible (in a tactica2 sense) aspects of 
his entire foreign policy. Chou En- lai was the man who 
carried out this policy. 
Chou's partial success in isolating Taipei was 
due to the leeway he had in applying a principle. Any 
country desiring diplomatic relations with Peking was 
required, on principle, to sever diplomatic relations 
with the Nationalists. But major statements regarding 
this principle--e.g., those in the Common Program of 1949 
and in Chou En-lai's report of 1959--were significantly 
ambiguous on the matter of when relations with Taipei 
must be broken, providing Chou with manuevering room in 
moving governments toward the Communists and away from 
the Nationalists.* In this way, countries willing to

break away from Washington's apparent position (that is, 
opposing reccgnition of Peking but, if unavoidable, ac-
cepting dual Chinese representation) were not rebuffed 
immediately. Chou counted on the Nationalists to play 
a key role in preventing an indefinite dual representa-
tion situation (Taipei's position being against recogni-
tion of Peking and against acceptance of an unavoidable 
dual representation arrangement). 
It appears that Mao's opportunism and flexibility 
--reflected in his willingness to tolerate a "two Chinas" 
situation (not in name) temporarily in order to force the 
Nationalists to withdraw their diplomatic representatives--
were greater than Chiang's, as witness the leeway he per-
mitted his advisers in moving toward the UK and Laos in 
response to their moves toward Peking. Chiang, however, 
made a better showing regarding France's move toward 
recognition. 
Formal recognition of Peking by the UK on 6 Janu-
ary 1950 opened the way to Sino-British negotiations by 
a "Negotiating Representative"--an anomalous situation 
for London, which was seeking an ambassadorial exchange. 
It permitted the Chinese Communists to hold up their reply 
to the British recognition initiative until after the 
tensions stirred up by the Korean war subsided while con-

Eden 
had chided Chou En-lai at the Geneva conference for not 
having a diplomat in London), the Communists did not 
permit the British to send an ambassador, limiting repre-
sentation to the level of charge d'affaires in order to 
remind London of their irritation with (1) the continued 
presence of a British consul on Taiwan (accredited to the 
"provincial," 
rather than the Nationalist, government) 
and (2) the distinction the UK maintained between diplo-
matic relations with Peking, on the one hand, and support 
for the U.S. position--not to permit the Communists to 
seize Taiwan--on the other hand. Nevertheless, Mao and 
his advisers did not make withdrawal of the consul on 
Taiwan a condition for the exchange of charge-level

Chinas" situation in fact--that is, with a British charge 
in Peking and a consul in Tamsui (north of Taipei), which 
was tantamount to recognition of the independent status 
of T4iwan--in the hope of eventually splitting the British

The policy to accept temporarily a "two Chinas" 
situation with countries showing some degree of goodwill 
or amenable to pressure to cut ties with Taipei at an 
early date opened the way for the Chinese Communists to 
"work over" friendly governments prior to the establish-
ment of full diplomatic relations. Chou En-lai had referred 
not only to "full," but also to "partial" diplomatic rela-
tions in his report to the NPC on 18 September 1959, sug-
gesting that Mao had made it a policy to get what could 
be had (such as a trade office, an NCNA office, or just 
an agreement to exchange individual visitors) despite the 
existence of relations between a particular government 
and Taipei.** This opportunistic departure from the anti-
*Despite occasional requests, London has not been per-
mitted to raise its mission in Peking to ambassadorial 
level, and the status of its charge has been qualified 
and insecure. Statements from high-level British officials 
regarding the Taiwan issue have usually provoked a hot 
Maoist reaction, and the charge has had to acquiesce 
from time to time in verbal "floggings" from Chinese Com-
munist Foreign Ministry officials. For example, the 
charge was "flogged" in this way in 'lay 1964 after Foreign 
Secretary Butler had depicted the Taiwan issue as "an 
international problem," and when he declared that Britain 
"would be glad to take part in any conference on the future 
of Taiwan, provided it took into account the wishes of 
the inhabitants of Nationalist China," the People's Daily  
on 12 May thundered that Britain had thus far only ".partial 
diplomatic relations with China." 
**Even countries which have not been disposed to cut 
ties with the Nationalists have been approached, and 
Peking has not broken off contacts until signs of com-
plete intransigence have become clear. For example, the 
Chinese Communists began a step-by-step approach to Beirut 
in 1956, but when, in April 1960, this flexibility had 
not gained them any advantage, they gave up their four-
year effort to obtain recognition, closing their trade 
office following clear signs of increasing Chinese Nation-

in Sino-American matters) and this use of flexibility to 
gain eventual formal recognition was authoritatively 
sanctioned in the Foreign Ministry directive of January 
1961: 
In the case of "two Chinas," we oppose firmly 
the conspiratorial activities of the US. and 
Chiang Kai-shek for the creation of 'two 
Chinas.' We do not carry on any oZficial 
activities with countries which recognize 
Chiang. 
Having made this categorical statement of "principle," 
the directive proceeded to shelve it in the name of the 
"tactir: of flexibility" in actual conditions: 
Nevertheless, in consideration of the actual 
conditions in Africa and Latin America and 
the special relations Chiang and the U.S. have 
in these countries and for the purpose of 
seeking a right opportunity for establishing 
our beachhead in Africa and Latin America 
and of preventing the U.S. and Chiang from 
carrying out their conspiracy, our strategy 
adopted in Africa and Latin America is dif-
ferent from that adopted in Europe and Asia. 
While Cuba still had diplomatic relations 
with Chiang, we established official con-

Chiang's envoy from Libya, our ambassador 
reported for dul,y. We understand the 
predicament of those countries in Africa

Although the directive stated that this flexiblity was 
a strategy for approaching countries in Africa and Latin 
America rather than those in Asia and Europe, the cases 
of Laos and France indicate that even this distinctive 
limitation was dropped in the name of expedient diplomacy. 
1. Two Examples 
a. Laos (1962) 
At a time when the Nationalists maintained consul-
level relations with Laos, Souvanna Phouma agreed to sign 
a joint statement with a Chinese Communist delegation on 
establishing diplomatic relations (25 April 1961), Chou 
En-lai thereupon started an exercise to exploit this 
newly acquired consul-level opportunity to force the Na-
tionalists to withdraw, but did not appoint an ambassa-
dor while the Nationalists remained. On 14 November, the 
Chinese Communist ambassador to Hanoi presented his cre-
dentials to Souvanna only as Peking's "economic and cul-
tural representative" and took up his new post in the 
Plaine des Jarres; on 17 November, Peking's consul general 
took up his post in Communist-held Phong Saly. Chou ap-
parently was anxious to establish higher level representa-
tion following the 11 June 1962 agreement to form a coali-
tion government/ 
  and when, on 2 July, the Souvanna 
government announced that it had recognized the Peking 
regime (among others), the Chinese Communists moved quickly 
to displace the Nationalist representatives. They sent 
their "economic and cultural representative" from the 
(footnote continued from page 66) 
independence celebrations because Senegal had rejected 
their demand that the Nationalist ambassador should be 
ejected. Senegal today has recogniz.id both Peking and 
Taipei, but has ties with neither.

Plaine to Vientiane (accompanied by Communist leader Soup-
hannouvong) on 11 July and presented him, Liu Chun, as 
the new charge d'affaires with "a letter of appointment" 
to Souvannas acting foreign minister. Angered by the 
higher level to which Peking had moved the "two Chinas" 
situation in Laos, the Nationalists, who prior to the 
establishment of the coalition government had agreed with 
Vientiane for an exchange of ambassadors, at first were 
reluctant to have their ambassador (sent from Thailand 
to be concurrently ambassador to Laos) present his cre-
dentials, but finally did i'.after the Chinese Communist 
charge had presented his own). 
The Chinese Communists made the Nationalist ambas-
sador the carget of gauche maneuvering. On 3 August 1962, 
as Souvanna stepped off his plane on returning to Vientiane, 
the unaccredited Chinese Communist charge rushed up and 
inserted himself just in front of Taipei's ambassador 
in the reception line, seized Souvanna's hand, and said 
that he represented the only legal government of China 
and thousands of Chinese in Laos. After he and another 
Chinese Communist diplomat completed their maneuver, 
Souvanna brushed them aside and shook the hand of the . 
Nationalist ambassador in order to demonstrate to Taipei 
that he desired the "two Chinas" situation to continue. 
But he also continued to move toward Peking on the 
diplomatic level. Although his government had recognized 
Peking on 2 July and made known its intention to establish 
relations, formal approval from the cabinet of the coali-
tion government was not given until 4 Sepi:ember (and pub-
licized on the 7th). This formal action was viewed by 
Taipei as the last insult, and Chiang apparently decided  
not to endure any others./ 
  / On 
7 September, the Nationalist government announced its 
decision to withdraw the ambassador and his embassy staff 
and formally broke off diplomatic relations with the 
angry statement that "we cannot allow Laos to become a 
testing ground for a 'two Chinas' arrangement." (Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's statement of 7 September 1962) Yet

b. France (1964) 
Chou En-lai calculated correctly again in 1963 
that the operative factor in inducing a Nationalist with-
drawal from France would be a temporary "two Chinas" 
situation. Mao personally participated in the effort. 
De Gaulle's officious anti-American attitude was viewed 
by the Chinese Communist leaders as providing thel, with 
an opportunity to turn Paris irrevocably away from Wash-
ington's ally (Taipei). Their operation demonstrated 
that Mao (as well as Chou) was more willing than Chiang 
to be duplicitous about "two Chinas" and as opportunistic 
as the Soviet leaders in friendly dealings with a West-
ern capitalist government. 
Cutting ecross the strong revolutionary and anti-
imperialist line they themselves had arrogantly advanced 
in the series of "open letters" in 1963, the Chinese Com-
munist leaders had to climb down from a doctrinal high 
horse and cast about for some idea--almost any idea--which 
would indicate a common Sino-French goal or grievance. 
They had hinted cautiously in the spring of 1963 at "cer-
tain new developments in the capitalist forces of France, 
which are beginning to be bold enough to stand up to the 
U.S." (Red Flag article of 4 March 1963; this important

basic, doctrinally coherent rationale for their policy 
of flexibility in maneuvering for French recognition. 
They acted first, leaving their doctrinal position, which 
had been rigid in the wake of their advance, to be adjusted 
later. 
France is "China's greates ally," Chou En-lai had 
declared (in a speech of 29 ;January 1963, 
because it was "also struggling 
for independence;" while Peking was opposing the U.S. from 
the left, Paris was "digging at the bottom of the American 
wall from the right." By the spring of 1963, the Chinese 
began to probe De Gaulle's attitude on recognition in a 
series of steps, starting with economic matters. In May, 
Peking's vice minister of Foreign Trade met with French 
officials in Switzerland; in October, the Georges-Picot 
mission was encouraged to explore the matter of an ex-
change of technical missions and data, When Georges-Picot 
discussed Sino-French trade, the Chinese leaders insisted 
that a serious exchange could not develop without diplo-
matic relations. Ex-Premier Edgar Faure( 
  in November) told the AFP 
correspondent in New Delhi that these Chinese leaders 
had specified "no conditions" regarding French relations 
with Taipei.* 
*Faure took this line in his article in Figaro on 9 
January 1964, declaring that France would accept "no pre-
conditions" to recognition and that, in his opinion, Paris 
would have no obligation to withdraw recognition from Tai-
pei. However, he reflected some sensitivity on the matter 
of whether recognition would impel the Nationalists to 
break off relations: he dodged the issue of what French 
representation in Taiwan should be and denied that he had 
told the Chinese Communists that the problem of French 
relations with Taipei was academic because the National-
ists would break immediately upon French recognition. In

OVAAMII I 
But Ambassador Bohlen's report of what Faure told 
him in Paris after his trip to the mainland seems to be 
the most plausible. That is, the Chinese leaders, while 
"basically" insisting that there would have to be a com-
plete rupture with Chiang, nevertheless were somewhat 
taken with Faure's suggestion to set aside the whole ques-
tion of French representation on Taiwan. He also told 
Bohlen that in reporting to De Gaulle, he suggested three 
possibilities for action: (1) do nothing and leave things 
as they were; (2) start at an intermediate step with the 
appointment of a permanent trade mission to Peking; or 
(3) go the whole way and extend recognition to the main-
land regime. He recommended the third course to the 
General, was not sure which he would decide on, and then 
ventured the conjecture, as a student of the General's 
psychology, that he would go "whole hog" and recognize 
the Communist government. 
For their part, the Chinese Communist leaders 
tried to induce De Gaulle to make the recognition leap

to discuss world revolution than the independence of

American policies.* They even tried to depict France as 
having discarded colonial policies (and as having become 
acceptable as a good imperialist country), but were care-
ful to use a formulation which did not touch on the embar-
rassing matter of French colonial possessions. Chen Yi, 
who had joined Chou in Africa, told the Algerian foreign 
minister in late December 1963 that "We believe there is 
an important and positive role which France could play 
in Asia, now that France is no longer engaged in any 
colonial war." (emphasis supplied) At the same time, 
Chou was 'Fated as stating to President Ben Bella that 
De Gaulle's independence contributed to a healthy balance 
of power in the world, which Peking believes is in the 
interest of world peace. Chou continued his exposition: 
"In this contest, it way not be unthinkable that France 
would like to redress the unjust discrimination that has 
befallen some of the nations of the world because of 
the policy of atomic monopoly which prevails today." 
These tributes to French independence and goodwill, in-
tended as pragmatic justifications for Mao's drive for 
recognition, did not contain an adequate expanation of 
how a capitalist leader could suddenly develop a benevol-
ent aspect. The "explanation" was to come at a time when 
Peking was vulnerable to attack by the Soviets on the 
*Chou En-lai stressed this mutuality of interest at 
the farewell banquet for Edgar Faure in Peking on 31 
October 1963: "We...both suffered from foreign occupa-
tion in the anti-fascist war and carried out protracted 
resistance to this occupation. Now both our people are 
striving for the sovereignty and-lEdependence of their 
countries. This is what we have in common and is a tie 
making for friendly exchanges." (emphasis supplied) This 
was Chou's subtle way of aligning De Gaulle with Mao in 
a common cause, first against the fascist powers and then 
against the U.S. Chou flattered De Gaulle personally in 
Conakry in a statement to Edgar Snow on 23 January 1964: 
he is "courageous in facing realities and dares to act 
accordingly"--a characterization which contrasts with 
earlier imagery depicting the General, in Peking media, 
as the representative of "big finance" rather than a 
daring statesman.

matter of opportunistic maneuvering with a major capital-
ist country for purely national interests, 
In the course of what seemed to be a routine discus-
sion of U.S. troubles with its allies, the People's Daily 
editorial of 21 January 1964 made several statements?inZh 
were strikingly moderate (and unprecedented) when compared 
to earlier Chinese Communist attacks on the Western demo-
cracies. Because leaders of these countries allegedly 
want to free themselves of U.S. control, 
They therefore have something in common with 
the socialist countries and the various 
peoples, 
The editorial went on to establish a new position that 
rulers in these countries have a "dual character"--that 
is, they are on the one hand expluiters, but, on the 
other hand, opponents of the U.S. (This is strikingly 
similar to the tactical formula Mao had employed during 
the Chinese revolution, which depicted the national 
capitalists as allies of the CCP because of their "dual 
character"--that is, as exploiters, but at the same time 
as opponents of foreign imperialism,) In extension of 
the latter point, the editorial stated that "there is 
not a single country or people in the world today which 
is not subjected to the aggression and threats of U.S. 
imperialism." In this way providing room for the French, 
it also served as "the objective basis for the establish-
ment of the broadest united front against U.S. imperial-
ism." 
Mao's move toward the French required a minor modi-
fication in his own concept of 1946 on the "intermediate 
zone" in the world. This concept, advanced by Mao in 
August 1946 to Anna Louise Strong, already had been re-
fined, in the 4 March 1963 Red Flag article, to include 
not just "many" but "all" capitalist countries in a large 
front against the U.S. The 21 January editorial stated 
that there really were two intermediate zones (not just 
one), the first including countries of Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America and the second consisting of "the whole of 
Western Europe, Australasia, Canada, and other capitalist

two zones enabled the Chinese to argue that the under-
developed countries (zone one) are in the forefront of 
the anti-U.S. struggle while the capitalist countries 
(zone two) are not far behind even though exploitation 
of the worker is a feature of their governments by defini-
tion. 
Mao personally seems to have sanctioned this doc-
trinal innovation--namely, that leaders in major capital-
ist countries have a "dual character," the good half

than Khru3hchev's Leninist description of some of these 
leaders as "sober-minded." On 30 January 1964, Mao per-
sonally departed from a dogmatic doctrinal line-which 
placed all "imperialists" in one camp and all bloc coun-
tries in the other camp. He also lifted France out of 
the category of "colonial" power. He explained 
 I his view of the second inter-
mediate zone, called the "third world" by the French. 
France can regain all of its influence in 
Asia. It has completed its decolonization 
and we know quite well that it does not 
want to come back here just for commerical 
purposes. France itself Germany, Italy, 
Great Britain (provided it stops being the 
courtier of the U.S.), Japan, and we our-
selves--there you have the third world.

To return to developments regarding the problem 
of establishing Sino-French relations, the Chinese Com-
munist plan to avoid insisting explicitly that the French 
must break off relations with the Nationalists (holding 
such a demand in reserve until after Paris announced 
its intention to establish diplomatic relations)apparently 
did not begin to worry the French until January 1964. 
On 21 January, a key French official told a U.S. enbassy 
officer that Peking might reject a "two Chinas" arrange-
ment, and this prospect seemed to be presaged by a Chinese 
Communist attack on the concept emanating from their em-
bassy in Mali. He reiterated the French position--namely, 
De Gaulle had accepted "no conditions" (meaning no condi-
tions explicitly stated) on recognition which required 
that Paris rupture relations with Taipei. His attitude 
reflected official French concern that Chiang might not 
take the initiative to break off relations (Paris ana--
Peking had calculated he would). American officials 
were encouraged by this sign and acted to persuade Chiang 
to avoid such an initiative, hoping to deter an exchange 
of missions or, failing in that, to place the responsibility

SFCR FT 
  On 26 January, a Nationalist spokesman pub-
licly declared Taipei's opposition to any "two Chinas" 
arrangement, but then proceeded cautiously: "Should 
France announce recognition of the Chinese Communists, 
we will decide to break relations with France in principle, 
but the question of when to break relations involves a 
subtle technique and must be 'considered carefully." 
When, therefore, on the 27th, Peking and Paris 
simultaneously announced their "mutual agreement to 
establish diplomatic relations" and to "appoint their 
ambassadors within three months," Taipei condemned it 
(in the same evening), rejected any "two Chinas" formula-
tion, but did not sever relations with Paris. Chiang 
had been persuaded to allow De Gaulle the privilege of 
taking the responsibility for his own action rather than 
passing it off on others, 
Both De Gaulle and Mao apparently were taken by 
surprise by Chiang's restraint, and Mao' lost no time 
in applying pressure on Paris by having ecimmetitaries make 
explicit what had been implicit in Sino-French discussions 
of the mechanics of recognition: 
...recognition of the government of the 
PRC by any country implies that it ceases 
to recognize the Chiang Kai-shek group,... 
and naturally it cannot permit the repre-
sentatives of this group to be present side 
by side with representatives of the PRC 
in that country or in any international 
organization. (NCNA's 28 January account 
of People's Daily editorial of the 29th) 
(emphasis supplied) 
However, De Gaulle kept to his plan to have Chiang make 
the final break and on the 28th, a French spokesman re-
jected the Maoist demand, declaring that "France has no 
intention or desire to break relations with the Chinese 
Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek." Responding 
specifically to the statement of Paking's Foreign Ministry

(see footnote)O, French spokesmen were quoted by AFP on 
the 28th as reiterating the line that recognition was 
extended "without any condition" and that the Peking 
statement commits only "the Peking authorities," not the 
French. The spokesmen also declared that Peking's posi-
tion had not been reflected in the Sino-French communi-
ques announcing the establishment of relations and "if 
the government of Peking sees things thus, that's its 
business." AFP also reported on the same day that a 
French spokesran conceded that the Communists might be 
demanding expulsion of the Nationhlists from Paris, but 
"this is out of the question." France, he said, was 
recognizing Peking as the effective government of the 
territory which it governed--i.e., the mainland--while 
the CRC continued to be recognized as the effective 
government of Taiwan.** 
Regarding De Gaulle's maneuvering to impel Chiang 
to make the break, the AFP account had French spokesman 
asserting that if Taipei rejects the line taken by Paris, 
"it is up to them to take their responsibility, not 
France." As the Taipei China Post noted in an editorial 
on the 28th, "By biding his time, De Gaulle hopes to goad 
Free China into breaking off ties to keep his own hands 
lily white." 
*Mao's flexibility in earlier French-Chinese discussions 
on recognition was to avoid making a specific demand for 
Paris to break with Taipei until he had De Gaulle's state-
ment of recognition in his pocket. His spokesman later 
insisted that it was with the "understanding" that France 
would cease to recognize Chiang's government and would 
not permit his representatives to be present "side by side" 
with Peking's representatives that the agreement was 
reached to establish diplomaLic relations. (Peking Foreign 
Ministry statement of 28 January). 
**This part of the statement was detrimental to the 
Nationalist position and provocative, as it was made in 
full knowledge that this formulation previously had been 
unacceptable to Taipei.

Nationalist restraint* led to a situation (described 
by Ambassador Kohler as "a game of diplomatic mah Jong 
between the Emperor of the West and the twin Emperors of 
the East"). De Gaulle had to walk a rougher road than 
he had planned, and his dilemma demonstrated to other 
governments that Peking would not permit them to sustain 
a "two Chinas" formula after they had extended recogni-
tion. (Japan, for example, was warned against using De 
Gaulle's procedure as an example, against "establishing 
relations with Peking while keeping the French consulate 
in Taiwan intact"--Peking broadcast to Japan on 26 Janu-
ary). 
Mao personally had played an active role. He had 
flattered De Gaulle for his anti-Americanism in the inter-
view on 30 January with visiting French parliamentarians, 
who were later described (by Paris journalists) as hav-
ing been thoroughly exposed to all the power of seduction 
of this great historic figure. The seducer began the 
interview by displaying his admiration for French culture 
--"I have read Diderot and in fact all of your encycloped-
ists...I have read Fourier. But above all, I am a great 
admirer of Napoleon. I know every one of his works." 
Mao then employed his favorite political style--that is, 
a rusticism--to attack the U.S. and USSR for the partial 
test ban treaty: "Have they consulted General De Gaulle? 
The Moscow Treaty is a fraud. Those two countries must 
not come and sh on our heads." Having in this manner 
defined the common ground (or barnyard) on which he and 
De Gaulle stood, he asserted (incorrectly) that France 
had "completed its decolonization," and then indirectly 
asked that ambassadors be exchanged as soon as possible 
*On 29 January, Reuters quoted Nationalist Economic 
Minister Yang as saying that "We are waiting for France 
to initiate the break. If France does not break rela-
tions with us, we will still maintain relations as long 
as it suits us." On the same day, the Nationalist 
charge in Tokyo stated that his government would not 
immediately withdraw its embassy from Paris.

without troubling over diplomatic maneuvering: 
General De Gaulle is a soldier; I too am 
one--I served under arms for 12 years. Not 
one of you is a diplomat, correct? Then I 
can freely say, let us distrust diplomats; 
they are too slippery. (Interview with 
French parliamentarians, printed in the 
Gaullist daily paper, Paris-Presse-L' 
Intransigent, 21 February 1964) 
Mao was at the very center of the effort to make De Gaulle 
take steps that would lead Chiang to withdraw his repre-
sentatives, and the overall effect of Chinese Communist 
pressures was to make the General move faster than he 
had desired in cutting ties with Chiang, 
The French on 29 January released information which 
was designed to anger Chiang and provoke him into with-
drawing his diplomats immediately. AFP was informed in 
Paris that Peking had designated its  charge and that the  
French would soon name their charge;1 
  De Gaulle maintained the 
fiction that he was not forcing a break--even as he took 
steps to exchange charges with Peking--and in his press 
conference on tne 31st, he praised Chiang's "worth, nobility 
of soul, and patriotism" while remaining silent on the 
behind-the-scenes steps he was taking to destroy future 
relations with Taipei? Having implied that Chiang was

was not under Mao's control), and having rejected the 
"two Chinas" formulation (opposed by both Mao and Chiang), 
he prepared to inform Chiang that recognition of Peking 
would be implemented by  sendinr; the French charge to the 
mainland. 
De Gaulle may have thought he could attain and sus-
tain a "two Chinas" arrangement, but the Chinese Commun-
ists had dispelled that idea with Peking's statement on 
28 January. As for Chiang, he could tolerate a situation 
where Paris ambiguously declared it would recognize both 
Chinese governments without defining what this meant, but 
he was unwilling to accept the implication of the General's 
statement: The Chinese Communist representative would 
be accredited from "almost the whole of China," implying 
that the Nationalist charge would be henceforth accredited 
from Taiwan only. On 6 February a Foreign Office official 
in Paris told Ambassador Bohlen that the Isrench had not 
recently talked with the Nationalist charge and that "if 
he doesn't draw the obvious conclusions" they will have 
to inform him that France has ceased to recognize Taipei 
as the government of China. Nevertheless, Chisag did 
not withdraw his charge and embarrassed the French by 
having the Nationalist UNESCO delegation transferred to 
the Chinese embassy, complicating French plans for acquir-
ing real estate reciprocally in Peking. 
Mao's advisers sustained the pressure, and Chou 
En-lai declared at a press conference in the Somali 
(footnote continued from page 80) 
repudiated long ago by the Chinese people"), referred to 
Peking's "implacable control of the masses," and even 
asserted that French recognition implied no approval of 
"the present Chinese regime." De Gaulle was considered 
to be, therefore, a partial friend only, whose loyalties 
were mixed and whose euologies (unlike Sihanouk's) were 
misdirected, This 31 January news conference detracted 
from Mao's earner professed view of the General as some-
thing like a comrade-in-arms. ?

Republic on 4 February that "From the day France announced 
the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, the 
personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Paris lost their 
qualifications as Chinese diplomatic representatives." 
When, however, at the same press conference, Chou used 
a mild diplomatic formulation intended to suggest no Chinese 
Communist pressure--the intention "attributed to France" 
not to break relations with Chiang was "a mere procedural 
question or a question of courtesy" (AP and Reuters ver-
sion)--NCNA did not report it because it implied that 
the matter concerned only the French government, which 
might do as it desired, Chou's diplomatic language was 
intended to deflect criticism that Peking was interfer-
ing in internal French matters. But Mao apparently was 
concerned at that point only with the need to force De 
Gaulle to get on with the job of expelling the National-
ist officials. 
As the Nationalists continued to hold their posi-
tion in their Paris embassy and Vice President Chen Cheng 
declared that they would "fight to the last man" (state-
ment of 8 February), De Gaulle prepared to concede to 
Mao by making the crucial move to "break" (preparation  
was reported in Le Monde of 7 February).  
This message, Chiang told Ambassador Wright, ended 
the period of maneuver, and now every effort would be 
rade to assure that in the eyes of the world the onus for 
the break rested with the French. Early in the morning 
of 11 February, Chiang's Foreign Ministry referred to the 
crucial message and asserted that by this action Paris 
"has damaged beyond repair" Taipei-Paris relations, which 
were severed on the 10th as a consequence.* The French

earlier activity pointed up the fatuous nature of Mao's 
professions to be above "soliciting" recognition of his 
regime. He had bragged to French Senator Mitterand in 
1961 that

devote itself to the building of social-
ism. (TASS dispatch of 23 February 1961) 
But the almost Taoist possiveness suggested by Mao in that 
interview had never been part of his foreign policy. And 
in 1964, he tried vigorously to gain recognition. One 
tactic was to send a "goodwill" delegation led by Vice 
Minister of Foreign Trade Lu Hsu-chang (accompanied by 
their ambassador to Mali and the Vice Chairman of the 
Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries) 
to west and central Africa, starting in late July 1964. 
They made no headway in visits to Niger and Nigeria. But 
other governments, influenced partly by the French action 
and partly by pressure from sister governments complied: 
Tunisia in January, the Congo (B) in February, the Central 
African Republic (CAR) in September, Tanzania and Zambia 
in October, Dahomey in November, and (after clear signs 
of ground preparation in November) Mauritania in July 
1965.* Recognition from these seven states represented 
a considerable success and a blow to Taipei's prestige 
*Mao's principle of rejecting any "two Chinas" or dual 
representation situation after relations have been estab-
lished was demonstrated by Peking's demand to have the 
government of the CAR expell Nationalist representatives. 
Within a few days after the issuance of the joint communi-
que announcing the establishment of formal Peking-Bangui 
relations in late September 1964, the People's Daily on 
3 October insisted that "from the day of the reTiiiiii" of 
the joint communique, Taipei's officials in Bangui "can 
no longer pass themselves off as diplomatic representa-
tives of China." 
However, in countries where the government has continued 
to drag its feet on expelling the Nationalists, the Chinese 
Communists have accepted a temporary situation (which would 
be construed as dual representation although Peking rejects 
the concept). For example, following Dahomey's recogni-
tion of Peking as the "sole legal government" of China in 
early November 1964, the Chinese Communist charge presented 
his credentials (in late December) despite the continued 
presence of Taipei's charge.

open the way to subversive activity. Ethiopia, Niger, 
Nigeria, Chad, and the Cameroon did not move with the

By early January 1965, Ethiopia had made no additional

agreed with his view that no Chinese diplomatic missions 
? 
should be accepted at that time. Diori had cited the 
speech with which the Chinese Communists had moved into 
the CAR and the extent of Peking's activities elsewhere 
in Africa as factors promoting increased caution. By the 
close of 1965, Taipei came away from its encounter with 
Peking in Africa with some prestige remaining and with 
a position of ties with roughly one-half of the contin-
ent's countries, the other half having established rela-
tions with the mainland regime.

As of August .1967, the number of countries which 
had diplomatic relations with Peking and Taipei was 47 
and 62, respectively, and 18 countries did not have rela-

with Western European governments in 1964, but established 
some footholds by way of trade and NCNA offices (or agree-
ments looking to setting up of such offices) in Austria, 
Italy, and West Germany. 
Yet his strategic inflexibility--that is, his dictum 
that no temporaryritTiicirihinas" situation will be permanently 
accepted--made it clear to Western governments that the 
French example had not solved the dual representation 
dilemma for any of them, and their hopes of seizing upon 
a breakthrough in the "two Chinas" tangle were quickly 
dispelled. Were Mao to accept a more nearly permanent 
dual representation policy, he might eventually score 
heavily in Africa, Europe,* Japan, Austria, New Zealand 
and the Americas, but such prolonged acquiescence in a 
tandem situation with diplomats of his civil war enemy 
and continuing opponent is more than his revolutionary 
animosity will permit him to bear. 
In Moscow, De Gaulle's recognition action, which 
impeded the Soviet effort to isolate Peking and restrict 
the spread of its influence, was not enthusiastically re-
ceived. Short and uninspired commentaries in Pravda and

4.mply that his maneuvering conceded the validity of Mos-
cow's position in the Sino-Soviet polemic on improving

they were considerably piqued.r

Mao's new tie with Paris left him open to the 
charge of opportunism and hypocrisy, and the Soviet lead-
ers attacked his chauvinistic diplomacy as inconsistent 
with his revolutionary preaching. Presidium member M. 
Suslov, speaking against the CCP on a wide range of issues, 
made a direct attack on the Chinese leaders at the CPSU 
central committee plenum on 14 February 1964 (precisely 
on the 14th anniversary of the Sino-Soviet treaty). Sus-

geois" statesman, Palmerston, whose principle of foreign 
policy was, "We have no eternal allies and eternal enemies; 
only our interests are eternal for us." He then implied 
that Mao's preaching had been insincere because it did 
not correspond to the practice of the preacher: 
The CCP leaders themselves, when the subject 
is practical steps in the international arena, 
prefer to act not at all from positions of 
revolutionary struggle with imperialism....

This strong Soviet polemical position exposed Mao's op-

in arguing that the Soviets do not see the "growing divi-

dealing with imperialism as a monolithic whole" (NCNA version

Chinese effort, this same concept was later used (in late 
1965 and early 1966) to try to rationalize the series of 
major Chinese defeats. The "realignment" concept was 
used on both occasions--first to defend a non-revolution-
ary opportunistic success and later to defend a series 
of revolutionary failures--because it implied the working 
out of "natural" forces, incapable of being controlled 
by even the best revolutionary leader. In defending a 
series of foreign policy faiures, various Chinese lead-
ers probably were quoting from a high-level party formula-
tion which may have been produced in September and October 
1965 to justify reverses. "...all kinds of political 
forces are now going through a process of drastic differ-

the Soviet leaders have been as opportunistic as the Chi-
nese in dealing with Western governments, but they have 
not professed to be unalterably anti-imperialist with the 
same frequency, intensity, and explicitness as have the 
Chinese. 
The Chinese leaders have continued to justify their 
official contacts with Paris by centering their comment-
ary on De Gaulle's anti-American obsession. They have 
even tried to portray him as being more anti-American than 
the Soviet leaders: 
There are a number of questions over which 
China and De Gaulle have conflicting views 
--De Gaulle advocating the neutrality of 
Vietnam--but our measure of the good and 
the bad is based on the degree of one's op-
position to the U.S. By this standard, 
President De Gaulle is greater than Brezh-
nev, first secretary of the CPSU, and 
Premier Kosygin. (Liao Cheng-chih inter-
view with Japanese correspondents on 24 
December 1965)

5 November 1965) "The world is going through a process 
of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganiza-
tion." (Chou En-lai statement of 29 November 1965). In 
each case, the Chinese indicated that the reverses would 
not force them to revise Mao's policy of pushing forward 
Ili revolution in various countries. On the contrary, 
Liu and Chou, using the same formulation, insisted that 
the world revolutionary struggle "is developing in depth" 
and that "new" revolutionary storms are rising against 
the U.S. Chou probably had personal doubts about the 
policy of pushing revolution even before the defeats of 
the summer and fall of 1965, but his statement suggests 
that it was necessary for him to comply with Mao's sus-
tained revolutionary compulsion in foreign policy.

Despite the frictions which developed in Peking-Paris re-
lations in the wake of the aberrations of Mao's purge in 
1966, the Chinese leaders continue to point to the justi-
fication of De Gaulle's anti-Americanism. 
B. Failure of a Major Effort: Japan (1952-67) 
When Japan's sovereign status was established in 
the peace treaty effective in April 1952, Mao and his aides 
had already established their policy of eroding U.S. and 
Chinese Nationalist influence in Tokyo. While seeking 
to gain recognition from Tokyo, the Chinese Communists 
tried to prevent the expansion of treaty relations with 
Taipei (which had been established in April 1952 on the 
basis of Premier Yoshida's December 1951 letter to gecre-
tary Dulles) and to destroy support for the bilateral 
security treaty (which permitted continued stationing of 
U.S. forces in Japan). Chou En-lai, entrusted with the 
major role in planning and implementing Japan policy, 
seems to have been at his natural best when permitted 
to advance a policy of maneuver and finesse. Chou ap-
parently has complied with the hardest aspects of this 
policy and seems to have implemented Mao's will in every 
shift. 
*Peking's first private (non-official) trade agreement 
with Japanese businessmen was signed in June 1952. The 
left-socialists used it to demand a reduction of the re-
strictions on trade with the mainland, as did the JCP. 
The Chinese Communists tried, in the fall of 1953, to get 
Tokyo to sever relations immediately with Taipei as a 
precondition for expanded trade, but when this hard line 
proved unsuccessful throughout 1954, it was downplayed 
and replaced by a gradual, "step by step" approach.

By May 1956, Chou was again smiling upon Japanese 
visitors, assuring them that "war criminals" would be re-
patriated. By June, the NPC was reported to have taken 
up a new policy of leniency, and in August, most of the 
"war criminals" had been returned to Japan, where Peking's 
prestige was given a new lift at a time when Moscow's was 
being tarnished in discussions about Soviet retention of  
the Kuriles and southern Sakhalin.-

 /Chou's efforts led to the sign-
ing of the fourth agreement in Yarch 1958, and he persisted 
in maintaining a Chinese Communist trade mission despite 
the Japanese government's refusal in April to recognize 
the mission's right to raise the PRC flag. However, when 
that flag was torn down from the PRC trade office in 
Nagasaki in May, and when the incident was publicized 
internationally, Chou had no recourse but to drop his 
conciliatory line. Probably reflecting Mao's decision 
to retaliate, Peking's actions thereafter suggested no 
nuance of restraint: all trade was suspended, Japanese 
firms were boycotted, the Sino-Japanese fishing agree-
ment was not renewed, some Japanese fishing boats were 
seized, and Chen Yi (on 9 May) was permitted to exercise 
his vituperative powers, denouncing Premier Kishi as an 
"imperialist" And. an "idiot." 
The crude Maoist acts of boycott and suspension 
of existing contracts angered political and business 
leaders in Japan, impeding the widely anticipated advance 
of the JSP in the elections and whittling down the good 
will Chou had been building in Japan. This policy, com-
bined with nppeals beyond the government to the "Japan-
ese people" to abrogate the security treaty with the U.S., 
had the net effect of backfiring on Mao, making it easier 
for Tokyo to sustain close relations with Washington and 
Taipei. 
Policy toward Japan was further frozen in this 
peculiarly Maoist period of revolutionary fanaticism, in-
ternally expressed in the aberrations of the commune and 
"leap forward" programs, and externally expressed in re-
jecting Soviet strategy toward the U.S. and in the inter-
diction effort against the offshores. In August 1958, 
Peking, in a hectoring way, raised six conditions for 
resumption of Sino-Japanese relations: the government 
of Premier Kishi must (1) change its hostile attitude 
toward China, (2) stop promoting the "two Chinas" concept, 
(3) stop interfering with efforts to restore diplomatic 
relations, (4) apologize for the Nagasaki flag incident,

(5) openly declare its intention to restore formal rela-
tions, and (6) send a delegation to negotiate differences. 
The final three demands were unrealistic, vindictive, and 
arrogant. They apparently reflected Mao's intervention 
(in the same way that Peking's November 1964 demands on 
the post-Khrushchev leadership later reflected his personal 
style).* 
25X1 
After Chou's conciliatory line was reinstituted 
in august 1960 (almost simultaneously with Khrushchev's 
withdrawal of Soviet technicians from the mainland), the 
final three demands were dropped. Mao apparently was 
convinced of the need for some trade with Japan and per-
mitted Chou to begin to climb down from the limb on which 
Mao had placed him following the Nagasaki flag incident. 
The policy during the intervening boycott period 
had been to trade, irregularly, only with small-and-medium-
sized firms, rather than with the bigger "monopoly capi-
talists," which were closer to the government (Chou's state-
ment to a Hong Kong Communist newspaper editor in July 
1959). These small firms were designated by Peking as 
"friendly," thus circumventing the government-subsidized 
Japan-China Export/Import Association, which had been set 
up prior to the Nagasaki flag incident as the focal point 
for semi-governmental trade with the mainland. In August 
1960, Chou supplemented his "three political principles" 
with "three trade principles" to cover Sino-Japanese com-
merce.** In this way, Chou, who was credited with formu1ating25X1

formulating the principles which were the guidelines for 
Sino-Japanese trade. (Chou already had gained credit for

the "friendly" firm trade policy, pre-empted any future 
break in trade exchanges (which had left Japanese firms 
holding breached contracts and had embittered Japanese

Communist aid to underdeveloped countries. These are among 
the few pieces of originality which Mao has conceded him.) 
Chou's political principles are: (1) not regarding Peking 
with hostility, (2) not participating in the U.S. "plot" 
to create two Chinas, and (3) working toward the normaliza-
tion of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. His trade 
principles are: (1) to work toward the conclusion of
trade agreements, (2) in the mean-
time, to conclude and successfully carry out private trade 
agreements, and (3) to give "special consideration" to 
certain industries and commodities (i.e., Japanese small-
medium enterprises). Tokyo was provided with considerable 
latitude by Chou's loosely formulated requirement that 
it must always be "working toward" formal ties with Peking.

In this way, easing out of the confines of Mao's punitive 
boycott palicy, Chou was able to devise a means for making 
trade arrangements, based on "friendship," which could 
eventually lead back to the establishment of more regular 
trade and then a Chinese Communist trade office in Japan. 
In devising this policy, Chou displayed again his remark-
able dexterity, his ability to maneuver within the narrow 
boundaries of an absurdly inflexible Maoist policy and 
to argue Mao into a little more rationality. 25X1 
Chou did not take a softer line toward the Ikeda 
government, but worked out a differentiated approach, which 
sustained contacts with some businessmen and made new ones  
with other traders./ 
However, in the fall of 1962, at a time when the 
regime was still struggling to recuperate economically 
and competition with the USSR was extended to all coun-
tries, Mao apparently was persuaded to move again toward 
a semi-governmental and regular trade relationship. Chou 
took a conciliatory line in a series of initiatives. He 
invited the pro-Peking LDP member, Matsumura, to Peking 25X1 
to increase trade and political contacts on a stee-bv-
step basis,_

between the two countries by linking them 
together, as well as by developing them side 
by side Moreover, these relations should 
influence and promote each other, and not 
the contrary. 
Chou's point was that his policy of "gradual and cumula-
tive methods" of advance should pave the way for Tokyo's 
recognition of Peking and should not be separated from 
that crucial goal by a fanciful hope of retaining ties 
with Taipei indefinitely. He was urging Tokyo to drop 
its line that politics and trade were separable. He was 
also implying that a sustained advance had been impeded 
by Ikeda's acceptance of U.S. policy on the issue of 
Chinese representation in the UN and should not be repeated 
in the form of overt opposition.* 
*Japan and four other countries including the U.S. 
sponsored a resolution in 1961 to set the matter of Pek-
ing's UN entry as an "important question" requiring a deci-
sion by a two-thirds majority. When, on 15 December, this 
anti-Peking resolution was adopted, the Chinese Commun-
ists denounced Ikeda in a sustained campaign which made 
it difficult for pro-Peking Japanese political figures  
to increase trade and other relations.r

were "unnecessary and provocative;" admission would have 
been defeated without any action by Japan; Peking would

The Chou-Matsumura "political understanding" (Chou's 
term) was used as an opening wedge in the effort to return 
trade to the semi-governmental status it had had in 1958. 
Next, LDP member Takasaki (who, in October, signed a memo-
randum for trade from 1963-1967) was used by Chou to un-
derscore the political significance of expanding Sino-
Japanese trade,,  
 / Although Peking was "displeaied" with Ikeda's 
political attitude, Chou recognized his "difficult posi-
tion" and for that reason would not allow anything to 
become an "obstacle to improved trade relations." This 
dexterity was retained by Chen Yi who, in describing the 
memorandum and annexed documents on over-all Sino-Japanese 
trade which had been signed in October by Liao Cheng-chih 
(with Takasaki), declared that they represented 
a private treaty, in one way, and a govern-
ment-to-government treaty, in another way,

business circles who have close relations 
with the government. (Press conference 
for Japanese reporters on 9 November 1962) 
The Liao-Takasaki memorandum specified the items to he 
exported by each country and agreed that trade would 
total $500 million both ways during the first five years, 
beginning in 1963--the first document since the Maoist 
boycott of 1958 to re-establish a regular channel for 
trade expansion. 
Chou, appareatly concerned that the Ikeda cabinet 
might not approve the memorandum and the deferred payment 
terms and interest rates stipulated in it, played down 
the political aspects of the agreement in November and 
December, while his subordinates pressed Japanese business-
men to begin "concrete" negotiations on the purchase of 
fertilizer, steel, agricultural machinery, and the vinylon 
plant. He gradually succeeded in dispelling fears among 
Japanese traders that high political demands would be 
raised immediately after government approval, but his re-
assurance effort had to be carried out well intL 1963. 
On 11 September 1963, Liao Cheng-chih reassured 
the Japanese that although Peking would not "compromise" 
on the "two Chinas" issue--i.e., Japan's relations with 
the Chinese Nationalists--there was "no alternative at 
present but to go ahead with the step-by-step formula."  
The Chinese also formed a China-Japan Friendship Associa-
tion (CJFA) and prepared to double the number of Chinese 
political activists ("cultural delegations") to be sent 
to Japan in 1964. While Premier Ikeda continued to op-
pose any rapid expansion of trade or credit, other Japan-
ese political figures were encouraged by Chou's concilia-
tory line to work for an expansion of trade, and his im-
plementation of the September 1962 understanding to ex-
pedite Sino-Japanese trade, augmented optimism in Japan. 
The Chinese Communist goal was long-range, targeted on 
one fine day in the future: "Chiang's ambassador is in

we promote friendly relations, one day Japan will prob-
ably expel Chiang's ambassador and conclude relations 
with us." (Chen Yi statement to Japanese reporters on 
28 October 1963) 
The main devevelopment in early 1964--i.e., De 
Gaulle's recognition of Peking--apparently convinced the 
Chinese that Ikeda might be influenced by the pressure 
of Japanese opinion to move toward recognition. Chou 
tried to exploit De Gaulle's initiative and, apparently 
with Mao's concurrence, removed purely doctrinal obstacles 
from the road of recognition. A partial beginning had 
been made in January, when the Peking Ta Kung Pao on the 
28th had laid it down that "part of theThii-eafaialists" 
in Japan could be included in the anti-U.S. united front. 
Chou followed this up on 14 May when he told LDP members 
that he no longer regarded Japanese businessmen as repre-
sentatives of "monopoly capital," that he welcomed their 
visits, and that the Chinese had much to learn from them. 
Chao An-po stated in late March, with sore exaggeration, 
that the demand in Japan for formal relations "has been 
growing in intensity...since France's establishment of 
diplomatic ties with China." Chou and his aides tried 
to convince the Japanese that his step-by-step formula 
was not a dogma and that "courageous steps" (toward 
recognition) should be taken. Nan Han-chen on 9 April 
at first denied that Peking was pressing for an inter-
governmental trade agreement, but then declared that the 
step-by-step trade expansion formula was too "time-con-
suming." Chen Yi on 7 May stated economic 
and political relations should improve "at the same time,"

its quality is changed. I urge Japan to 
change the quality of its policy and at 
an opportune time, take a step forward. 
The "step forward" implied recognition on the De Gaulle 
precedent, but Chou did not want to be tied to an explicit 
statement, to an appearance of pushing too hard and setting 
a precondition for increased trade. He did not want to 
jeopardize important advances just then in the making. 
Chou and his aides in April had concluded two agree-
ments with Matsumura that represented a tactical gain. 
These were for a mutual exchange of eight newspaper report-
ers and the opening of trade liaison offices staffed by 
five men each, the Takasaki office in Peking and the Liao 
office in Tokyo. The agreements were semi-governmental, 
as the Japanese government had to approve them. 
However, Chou rejected bids for postal, meteorological, 
and telecommunication agreements because these would have

and economics are separate." He said: "Quite frankly... 
the meaning of the thesis...is that politically the atti-
tude of non-recognition of China should be maintained" 
while limited progress continued in trade. He complained 
that the Japanese were using the step-by-step formula to 
maintain the "status quo" in Sino-Japanese political rela-

required a direct exchange with the Japanese government 
departments concerned (rather than mere governmental ap-
proval of non-governmental trade and news arrangementiT. 
This exchange would have established a situation which 
Tokyo preferred?i.e., acceptance of the Japanese concept 
of "one China, one Taiwan." Chen Yi made the definitive 
statement on this matter in an interview with Japanese 
reporters on 7 May 1964: 
[The Japanese government] should sincerely 
settle the big problem of normalizing rela-
tions between China and Japan step by step. 
As soon as diplomatic relations between the 
two countries are resumed, other concrete  
issues will easily be solved through friendly 
negotiations. (emphasis supplied) 
"Other concrete issues" referred to concluding government-
to-government agreements, settling the issue of war repara-
tions, and permitting the Japan Air Lines to operate across 
the mainland. From Tokyo's viewpoint, these were not pr-xss-
ing matters, being only second in importance to trade and 
to sustaining close relations with Washington and Taipei. 
Short of formal government-to-government agree-
ments, Tokyo apparently was willing to consider contacts 
between Chinese Communist and Japanese officials, On 14 
May 1964, Chou had used LDP members to convey Peking's 
interest in establishing such contacts. He suggested that 
these might start in Hong Kong, informally (between NCNA 
and Japanese consulate officials), or in Paris; later, 
formal contacts in other countries could be started between 
the Japanese and Chinese Communist ambassadors. Ikeda 
apparently was interestcd, and on 26 June, he seems to 
have tried to probe the U.S. attitude by having a Japanese

Before Sato took over, however, Chou tried to per-
suade Tokyo to avoid statements which he would be impelled 
to rebut. During the mid-May 1964 discussions with LDP 
members, one of Chou's aides, Chiao Kuan-hua, stressed 
the Chinese permier's forbearance. Chiao, describing 
himself as the anonymous author of some editorials in the 
Peking People's Daily, recounted his editorial criticiz-
ing British Foreign Minister Butler for supporting the 
concept of "self-determination" for Taiwan. In the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs draft of the editorial, he had also 
severely attacked Premier Ikeda and Foreign Minister 
Ohira for defending a similar concept, but "Premier Chou" 
had deleted the attack.** Chou himself told the LDP

Diet (regarding the "undefined" status of Taiwan) had 
aroused a "very strong reaction" in Peking, where a deci-
sion to lodge a formal protest with Tokyo had not yet 
been reached. He implied that restraint was still the 
dominant consideration of the Chinese leaders, but he 
also indicated that Japanese officials should themselves 
show forbearance in return. Chou said that Peking didn't 
care about statements from jurists and journalists regard-
ing Taiwan, but those from government officials were 
"most important," and he asked Matsumura to stress this 
view to Ikeda. Although Mao had provided Chou with the 
leeway necessary for maintaining dexterity in handling 
policytoward Japan, Chou must have been aware that this 
relative freedom was a transient matter, allowed to 
endure only for so long as Mao saw it was creating re-
striint on Tokyo's side.* 
Chou continued to absorb small insults and tried 
to maintain his moderate course. He remained silent 
about the visit on 13 August of an important Chinese 
Nationalist official in Tokyo which coincided with the 
arrival of the five Chinese Communist trade liaison per-
sonnel led by Sun Ping-hua to open the trade office. On 
14 August he agreed to implement the Liao-Matsumura agree-

permitted Sun Ping-hua to hint about a higher-level visit 
of Chinese Communist officials (including Liao Cheng-chih) 
to Japan in the fall. On 17 October, one day after the

to anti-mainstream leader Sasaki on 10 July, Mao had tried 
to make the Soviet leaders look like imperialist land 
thieves, while he defended Japan's right to demand the 
return of the Southern Kuriles. However, the accusation 
backfired when the Japanese press interpreted it, correctly, 
as an anti-Soviet ploy and a play for public opinion in 
Japan. Chou had to bail out his principal, insisting, 
in a conversation with a JSP Diet member on 19 July, that 
the press had "erred" because as far back as January 1957, 
Chou had told the Soviet leaders they had taken "too much 
territory," and Mao's recent statement was not a new charge.* 
His defense of Mao was undoubtedly viewed by the Titter 
as yet another sign of Chou's loyalty.** 
Mao and Chou looked for further advances with the 
accession of Sato, who had previously established a reputa-
tion for desiring a policy toward Peking which was "inde-
pendent" of Washington's. By 9 November 1964, when Sato 
took over from Ikeda, Chou's policy of suppleness and 
maneuver had led to a high point of contact with Japan 
and it was unprecedented in its moderation toward a coun-
try which did not recognize the Peking regime. Within 
two weeks, however, Nao's reaction to Sato's unexpected 
hard line cracked the fine glaze which Chou had been so

islands returned to the Soviet Union." (Cited in Pravda

long in perfecting, it is not credible that Chou would 
have marred his own handiwork if Mao had not directed him 
to do so. 
After having permitted Chou to tolerate small in-
sults from journalists in July and the JSP in October, 
Mao apparently was not willing to have him tolerate major 
rebukes from the Japanese government. In his view, that 
was precisely what had been hurled at his regime in the 
speeches of Sato and Foreign Minister Shiina to the Diet 
on 21 November. These men made it clear that Tokyo would 
maintain official diplomatic relations with Taipei while 
trading only through private channels with Peking ("separat-
ing economic matters from politics"); they rejected the idea 
of expelling the Chinese Nationalist representative from 
the UN on the eve of the 1964 session, expressed regret 
over Peking's first atom bomb test--a "poorly considered" 
Chinese Communist action--"strongly demanded" that Peking' 
should "refrain from conducting further tests and take 
the initiative to accede to the partial nuclear test ban 
speedily," and advocated the strengthening of ties with 
the U.S. The new government, on the very same day, took 
concrete action, denying entry to the CCP delegation led 
by Peng Chen which was to attend the JCP's 9th Congress--
on the grounds that, once in Japan, it "would aggravate 
the conflicts and strife in the country and would be 
inimical to Japan's interests and security." And this 
from Sato, a man who, earlier in November, the Chinese 
Communist leaders believed would be as friendly as, or 
even friendlier than, Ikeda had been.* Mao apparently 
decided that careful cultivation of Japanese opinion would

"De Gaulle of Japan," but that this had not occurred and 
that the LDP official had "let us down." (Liao Cheng-
chih interview of 24 December 1965) Chen Yi indicated 
that Sato had beeL the real source of Peking's miscalcula-
tion: "Before he became prime minister, Sato told Nan 
Han-chen...that he would not separate economics from 
politics, but as soon as he attained power, he did an 
about-face. We do not like this." (Chen's statement to

have to take second place to a punitive attack against 
Sato to teach him a lesson in servility. There was a 
method in this Maoist plan, but madness was its over-ill 
effect on Chou's policy. 
Maoist shouting began in a Foreign Ministry state-
ment on 21 November 1964; it continued on the 23rd in a 
People's Daily commentary which "warned" Sato against his 
"perverte-r?iriti-Peking course; it was sustained on the 
25th in a People's Daily Observer article which predicted 
Japan's iriVOTWITat in a "nuclear holocaust" if it con-
tinued to allow the U.S. to "drag Japan further into its 
nuclear strategic system." This threat was made roughly 
one month after the Chinese Communists exploded their 
first atom bomb and is an early instance of nuclear sabre-
rattling. Mao's new feeling of strength--i.e., that Peking 
had become a nuclear power--may have intensified his re-
action to Sato's stand. 
Psychological warfare was also started on the trade 
front, where the Chinese Communists had a real capability 
to act. They did not revert to the 1958 policy of com-
plete boycott, but rather maintained a policy of selective 
delays in concluding contracts. On 27 November, Sun Ping-
hua, head of the Liao trade office in Tokyo, notified the 
Takasaki office there that he had been instructed not to 
sign the $80-million dollar fertilizer purchase contract 
for 1965; a Chinese Communist official in the Liao office 
"explained" that this was Peking's way of showing "disap-
proval" of Sato's overall policy of hostility toward China, 
However, Chou again showed his dexterity, on the one hand 
attacking Sato's policy as being "full of contradictions," 
while on the other hand reassuring Tokyo that the Liao-
Takasaki trade agreement (for the period 1963 to 1967) 
would be fulfilled "without fail" (interview with Kyodo 
correspondent in early December 1964). Chou and his aidesapparently were under new instructions (almost certainly 
from Mao) to hit back at Sato's anti-China moves and state-
ments without permitting any one of them to pass unanswered. 
This was Mao's "tit-for-tat struggle" concept, represent-
ing a shift from Chou's policy of not retaliating for every 
insult. Despite Chou's maneuvering, the struggle concept 
significantly hardened the line toward Japan.

Working within the narrow confines of this line, 
Chou and his aides tried to apply the pressure of Japanese 
opinion on Sato to make him less outspoken in defending 
U.S. policy on Taiwan and Vietnam. By 30 December, they 
threatened a reduction of trade with Japan if Sato should 
decide, after his visit to Washington, against government-
supported credit (through Export-Import Bank funds) for 
three pending trade agreements. At the same time, they 
rejected a meeting with Tokyo's Foreign Ministry China 
Section chief because the Japanese government had refused 
to allow a Japanese lawyer to defend Chinese Communist 
officials under arrest in Brazilf 
 / Chen "appreciated" the fact that Sato in 
Washington had made no decision to align Japan with U.S. 
nuclear strategy, to arm Japan with U.S. nuclear weapons, 
or to make the security treaty a permanent pact--all mat-
ters of major concern for Peking. But Chen attacked Sato 
for voting with the U.S. in the UN on the "important ques-
tion" issue; he attacked him on other grounds?i.e., for 
reversing his earlier position on not separating trade 
and politics as rigidly as Ikeda had done. This Chen 
Yi attack was intended to have domestic repercussions in 
Japan to the detriment of Sato's foreign policy, and a 
People's Daily Observer article on 20 January 1965 stated 
that his pro-U.S. course "will only increase dissatis-
faction among broad sections of the Japanese people." 
Observer was wrong, as this crude cudgeling strategy in-
creased popular distaste for Peking's tactics. 
The hardened line on Japan was implemented by Chen 
Yi in an even cruder way during his 4 February interview 
with Japanese members of the Takasaki trade office in Peking. 
Sato's continued refusal to approve the use of government-
supported Export-Import Bank funds evoked even more Maoist 
shouting in an unsuccessful attempt to scare him into a 
backdown. Chen shouted in a "loud and aggressive tone"

issues were increasingly tied to trade, Sino-Japanese com-
merical interchange continued to increase. In November 
1965, Liao Cheng-chih told  that trade would move 
from $400 million in 1965 to $500 million in 1966. 
As suggested earlier, Sino-Japanese relations, 
which had been on a downward spiral since Sato took over 
from Ikeda in November 1964, were worsened by Peking's 
demand that he end his support for U.S. policy on Vietnam. 
In September 1965, Chen raised the spectre of Japanese 
collusion with other major powers in an attack on the 
mainland: 
We welcome U.S. imperialism to come and come 
early; come with the Indian reactionary 
nationalists, come with the British imperi-
alists, come with the Japanese militarists. 
We are certain to win even if the modern 
revisionist leadership in the north combines 
with them....China is a large country; even 
if the U.S. and its lackeys send several mil-
lion troops to the China mainland, it will 
not be enough. (Chen Yi Press Conference 
of 29 September 1965) 
By casting the Japanese in the light of something more 
than political opponents, Chen apparently tried to stimulate 
more anti-Sato opinion in Japan than had yet arisen and 
to warn implicitly against Diet ratification of the Japan-
ROK treaty. He failed on both scores, and when the Lower 
House ratified the treaty in November, Peking depicted 
it as part of the military alliance allegedly under con-
struction by the U.S. to serve as the instrument for a 
major war in Asia which would include an attack against 
China. (People's Daily editorial of 15 November 1965; 
the editorial used-ririivage from Chen's press conference 
of 29 September to reiterate the hypothetical prospect 
of Japanese participation in an attack on the mainland.) 
Kuo Mo-jo tried to conceal this policy defeat on the 
Japan-ROK treaty by devising a weak rationalization: the 
U.S. "had to step up its collusion" with "reactionary 
forces" in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan because it was 
in trouble in Vietnam (speech of 19 November).

The new style in policy toward Japan which gradually 
replaced Chou's step-by-step approach had appeared in late 
November 1964 and, increasingly thereafter, Chinese Com-
munist statements appeared to be little more than simple  
ultimatums. That is, Sato was instructed 
either to comply on a large range of issues 
or Peking would attack his administration as being incap-
able of promoting Sino-Japanese contacts (Liao Cheng-chih 
interview of 30 August 1965), Ambassadorial-level talks 
between Japanese and Chinese Communist officials were un-
acceptable until Tokyo agreed to discuss "all" matters 
at issue the ke one a arently being support of Washing-
ton 
* Acting on this line, Chinese Communist 
officials were said to be taking an increasingly rigid 
attitude in refusing to develop contacts with Japanese 
embassy personnel in Switzerland/ 
Mao seems to have insisted \ Ithat relations 
with Tokyo would develop rapidly and in an anti-American 
direction, or not at all, The Chinese Communists made 
no effort, as Chou had made earlier, to cover up the un-
compromising aspect of this policy, and a take-it-or-
leave-it attitude pervaded their statements. 
Developments in the Vietnam war and Mao's apprehen-
sion that it might escalate eventually to the mainland 
impelled him to take a harder line to mobilize all possi-
ble international forces against the U.S. and its allies.

  By the fall of 1965, Mao 
tried to put a more militant spirit into policy toward 
Japan. For example, increasingly obsessed with the 
radical political potential of young people, he stressed 
the "important role" which Japanese youth must play in 
the "harsh and tense" situation (interview with Japanese 
delegation leaders on 25 November 1965).** Other lead-
ers, including Liu Shao.-chi, Chou En-lai and Peng Chen, 
outlined a four-point action program for the visitors: 
they were asked to strengthen (1) contacts between the 
youth of Japan and the mainland, (2) the "common struggle" 
25X1 
25X1 
**Peng Chen apparently had had a major role in imple-
menting the Youth Exchange Program with the JCP and other 
Japanese leftists. On 14 'June 1966, as CCP-JCP relations 
deteriorated and after Peng Chen had been purged, the 
head of the jCP's cultural department suggested to other 
leaders that youths "who feel greatly indebted to Peng 
Chen for his assistance during their visits to China" 
under the program should not be retained in the Sino-
Japanese Friendship Association. 
Peng was later blamed for taking a moderate line; in 
fact, he was no more moderate than Chou. On 9 September 
1966, a newspaper of the Mao Tse-tung Red Guards of People's 
University made an "Urgent Proposal for the China-Japan 
Youth Interchange Program," demanding that it should be 
warlike--unlike the first interchange program which had 
been "peacefully conducted by the former Peking Municipal 
Committee." Among the Red Guard proposals were; instill 
people's war theory in the minds of Japanese youth, train 
them to participate in revolution, and require daily study 
of Japanese editions of Mao's works.

relations with Peking, and support for Hanoi in the 
war. On 12 December, Liao Cheng-chih spoke to the dele-
gations in Shanghai on the need to struggle against U.S. 
policy in Japan by forming a "people's front", of which 
the delegations were said to be a symbol. 
 jOn 24 
November, an NCNA official in Tokyo was quoted as saying 
that the Chinese Communists believed the .JCP was shifting 
away from its "full support" of Peking's positions and 
that clear signs of JCP-CCP differences would emerge with-
in six months. The same official was quoted as pointing 
to the jCP's relative passivity in creating opposition 
to the japan-ROK treaty and its failure to incite violent 
political action against it as a clear example of the JCP's 
reject4.on of CCP advice.,  
Sato, 
Sato, however, was still their main target and they 
suggested that his support of escalation in Vietnam might 
lead to a China-U.S, war and then a Sino-Japanese war.* 
*This line did na?Nurt Sato politically as much as it 
helped him to argue for greater recognition of the Chinese 
Communist potential nuclear threat. His statement to the 
Diet in late November 1965 reflected his desire to tighten 
Tokyo's control over shipments to the mainland of goods 
on the COCOM list which were useful for Peking's nuclear 
weapons program. He said that Pe:ing "is a threat with-
out being armed with nuclear weapons. This threat to 
Japan is real, now that China is a nuclear power." It 
also helped him in gaining ratification in November of 
the Japan-ROK treaty on the argument that Japan needed 
alliances directed toward increased security.

These Chinese Communist threats, taken together with 
Ambassador Reischauer'e suggestions in January 1966 and

at about the same time these crude threats were being

March 1966 that he must prepare the JCP for "armed strug-
gle" to oppose the renewal of the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security 
Treaty in 1970 because the U.S. was preparing for an 
eventual attack on China. This apparently was Mao's 
egregious way of dictating a new line to the JCP which 
would have the main element of the Chinese model in it. 
This new line was to replace the line of "peaceful tran-
sition" and was to be imposed regardless of political 
realities in Japan. U.S. bases were to be the targets. 
the 
Chinese leaders told Miyamoto that he should be prepar-
ing the party to wage "guerrilla warfare against American 
military bases in Japan" and should "reconsider"--i.e., 
abandon--the concept of peaceful  transition to socialism  
as defined in the JCP's program.

as the CCP position as conveyed to him in Peking in March 
1966: "China's view was that preparations are necessary 
for the outbreak of a Sino-U.S, war--a third world war. 
Imperialism's war strength can be diverted more effectively 
by tens of thousands of people armed with weapons than 
by one million party members or mass movements. In other 
words, they did not say that Japan should immediately launch 
an armed uprising." (Interview published in Tokyo Akahata

"flunkeys" had always been calling for violent revolution, 
drawing on the documents of "a certain party," but were

Japan must have a people's war or armed struggle."

introduced into Sino-Japanese relations which seems to 
have gone beyond anything which Chou En-lai would have 
permitted on his own initiative.* 
A new area of concern developed with the rise of 
a friendly atmosphere between Tokyo and Moscow on Soviet

been to cultivate Japan as a counterforce to Peking in

Shiina's visit to Moscow in January 1966, Gromyko toned 
down his statements on the Ua and declared that the USSR 
does not wish to harm Japanese relations with "third coun-
tries". The Maoist response--to clear signs that the CCP 
dispute with the CPSU leaders was having a softening ef-
fect on Tokyo-Moscow relations--was to attack both govern-
ments openly; Japan is "following the U.S. and is aligning 
itself with the USSR to oppose China" and Moscow wants 
to "collude" with Tokyo because the Russians oppose Peking 
(People's Daily Observer article of 4 February 1966). 
This stritegy of cudgeling Tokyo deterred neither the 
Soviet leaders nor Sato from signing a five-year trade 
agreement; the Soviets were encouraged by these Maoist 
complaints, and later made concessions in the talks on 
fishing matters (in April 1967). 
Mao had no real leverage on Sato, who still separ-
ated trade from politics. Vituperation did not prevent 
Sato from refusing (on 29 March 1966) to permit the Chinese 
to send a delegation, prospectively to have been led by 
Liao Cheng-chih, to hold discussions with Sasaki and other 
JSP officials. The grounds for refusal were that previous 
attacks by Peking's officials in Japan had constituted 
interference in domestic affairs. Peking reacted with 
a threat--Sato will "push the Japanese nation again into 
the abyss of disaster" (People's Daily Commentator article 
of 5 April 1966), and with the cancellation of some visas 
for Japanese travel to the mainland. If Mao could see  
that he was helping Sato, he did not care.F

indicated that they had not barred the door. 
The hard political line was not duplicated in the field 
of trade, and, despite the overt Peking position that 
politics and trade are inseparable, the Chinese Communists 
in fact kept them separate in most of 1966. 
The Maoist purge and the hard line toward Sato did 
not result in a reduction of trade in 1966.* The Chinese 
were deliberate in assuring the Japanese that this would 
not occur. Sun Ping-hua, head of the Liao trade office 
in Tokyo, was quoted in September 1966 as pledging that 
the total amount of transactions between Japan and the 
mainland at the Canton fair would be "double" the highest 
previous figure. At the preliminary Liao-Takasaki trade 
talks in mid-September, the Chinese agreed to pay cash 
for purchases instead of using the deferred payment system, 
and the ac uiesced in most other Japanese proposals. 
  the U.S. embassy in Tokyo in October esti-
mated that the 300-350 "friendly firms" accounted for 60 
to 65 percent of the total trade. The Chinese on 21 Nov-
ember signed the final agreement on the level of trade 
under the fifth and final year of the Liao-Takasaki agree-
ment; they did not stall or try tc disrupt the negotiations.

Chinese have not used it as a pretext to curtail trade. 
Chou told LDP members on 12 September 1966 that although 
restoration ef diplomatic relations was "an important 
problem," the interchange of people and trade at present 
was "even more important," inasmuch as it is obvious that 
diplomatic relations "cannot be restored in a short time." 
Mao's purge and his ubiquitous demand that revolu-
tionary attitudes must prevail in all aspects of Chinese 
CommuniSt activity, however, eliminated a different part 
of Chou En-lai's differentiated policy, namely, the part 
in which Peking professed non-interference in Japan-U.S. 
relations. As late as December 1966, Chen Yi was still  
permitted to profess(   
25X1 
  that Peking had no desire to inter-
fere with these relations. But by 27 February 1967, the 
linc had been shifted, apparently after the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry and its officials had been opened up to criticism 
by Maoist Red Guards. On that day, during the signing 
of the protocol on "friendly" trade, Liao Cheng-chih, who 
had been subjected to Red Guard criticism sessions in 
January, urged the Japanese "friendly" trade negotiators 
"to struggle against Washington, Moscow, the Sato-Kishi-
Kaya government, and traitors in Yoyegi [JCP leadership 
headquarters]."* This formulation reflected the shift 
*The protocol replaced the private trade agreement for 
the promotion of "friendly" trade signed on 15 December 
1962 between representatives of the Japan-China Trade Pro-
motion Association and the China Council for the Promotion 
of International Trade. It reflected the hard line: by 
contrast with the 1962 agreement, it was highly polemical 
and contained sycophantic praise for Mao's purge and 
"thought," it committed the newly-favored Japan Interna-
tional Trade Promotion Association (purged of pro-JCP 
elements) to struggle against "U.S. imperialism, Japanese 
reactionism, and Soviet revisionism," and it stated Mao's 
policy to "eradicate" the "evil influence" of the JCP from 
Japanese-Chinese trade. The comparatively non-polemical 
1962 agreement had been arranged and signed by Nan Han-chen.

cultivated by a step-by-step approach) and a greater desire 
to put them all in the same camp, the black camp of im-
perialism and revisionsm, which were equally pejorative 
terms in. Mao's vocabulary. Mao had more enemies, to fight 
in Japan than ever before--the result of an uncompromis-

temper. But Mao apparently does not pay for his unful-
filled hopes, by any proportionate depression of spirit 
and seems to have an ability to fly over a present policy 
setback by beginning to hope for a new kind of future. 
Mao's new future required new men (or remade old 
ones). His purge extended into the group responsible for 
implementing the step-by-step policy. Several men, includ-

the Promotion of International Trade, fell from favor AR4

*Nan Han-chen had to accept the benefits of Maoist mental 
therapy--i.e., Mao's version of the Bolshevik practice 
of subjecting scapegoats to "criticism and self-criticism." 
Since January 1967, Liao Cheng-chih, another scapegoat, 
has had to accept a major part of the blame for the earlier 
Japan policy, but Chinese officials in the Liao trade of-
fice in Tokyo reassured anxious Japanese trade negotiators 
that criticism of Liao was different from that of men as-
sociated organizationally with Liu Shao-chi and that Liao 
would "pass the test" of loyalty to Mao. Chen Yi, too, 
has been subjected to the process of accepting blame for 
Mao's and Chou's earlier policies. He and Liao probably 
will continue to be subjected to a protracted routine of 
psychological abasement, but they probably will not be 
purged. . ? 
Red Guard persecution of Liao provides a revealing 
example of Mao's use of the scapegoat procedure. Liao

for expanded Sino-Japanese contacts, and most of the Jap-

anese press did not report on this anti-American aspect 
of the protocol. The Japanese government and businessmen 
were further distressed by the political activity of Sun 
Ping-hua, chief of the Liao trade office in Tokyo, who 
was obviously instructed from Peking to attack the JCP 
for provoking a fight between 20 Chinese students and 
members of the pro-JCP Sino-Japanese Friendship Associa-

statement of political protest, declaring that the "Jap-

of the international Communist movement, and, shifting 
to an attack on the police for inaction, he concluded 
with a "demand" that the government immediately punish 
the pro-JCP group. On the previous day, Sun, apparently 
acting on an instruction from Peking to take a hard revo-
lutionary line, told a meeting of "friendly" firm repre-

the jITPA called for a revolutionary "struggle against 
revisionism"--a campaign to begin on 2 April led by 
"friendly" firms at the hall where the fight had taken 
place. Sun was recalled to Peking in mid-April, and his 
last major act before that time was to demand that photos 
of the struggle meeting at the hall should be sent to 
Peking (for fuel in the fight against the JCP and to ap-
ply pressure on the government to punish the men who had 
attacked the Chinese students).* (The students had placed 
anti-JCP slogans on their dormitory walls, virtually in-
viting retaliation.) On 6 March, Liao Cheng-chih said 
that Sato's failure to protect the students WdS another 
sign of hostility and that he might reduce the activities 
of the trade office in Peking or recall senior Chinese 
trade representatives from Tokyo. Actually, he did not 
act on this threat and trade was sustained. 
The new Maoist revolutionary approach to influenc-
ing opinion in Japan required a drastic reconstruction 
of the CCP's basis of support and a major effort to replace 
JCP influence in Japan's contacts with the mainland. Once 
again, the chief "trade" official engaged in political 
organizational activity. On 23 March, Sun Ping-hua pre-
sided at the founding meeting of ,the China News Agency 
(CNA)--a replacement for the JCP-controlled Asian News 
Service--charged with the job of relaying NCNA stories 
and photographs to Japanese audiences. Sun said that the 
CNA would "disseminate the great thought of Yao Tse-tung, 
explain China's socialist revolution and socialist con-
struction, and promote the solidarity and friendship of  
the Chinese and Japanese people". (

a wide range of enemies. On 18 April, Sun Ping-hua's 
deputy in Tokyo demanded that leading members of the 
Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association should make plans for 
the possible withdrawal of the Chinese Communist trade 
office from Japan in 1970 so that they too could with-
draw This demand may have reflected Mao's desire to 
create the impression that Sino-Japanese trade contacts 
would deteriorate if the Japan-U.S. security treaty was 
to be kept intact in 1970. The inference was: Overseas 
Chinese in Japan must begin immediately to prepare an 
effective organization to act as a "stay-behind" asset 
to support Peking. The real intention seems to have been 
to attain immediat support from the Overseas Chinese com-
munity for closer supervision from Peking, to remove 
Chinese Nationalist influence, and to generate support 
for Mao, "love of Mao Tse-tung" having been newly stipu-
lated as one of the fundamental principles to guide the 
thoughts of Chinese in Japano*

center of these activities was said to be the Liao-Takasaki 
office building which would serve as a "quasi-official 
embassy" housing trade officials, an Overseas Chinese work 
unit, and NCNA personnel. Indoctrination of businessmen 
who were to visit the mainland apparently is one of the 
work 'nit's functions, and in late August 1967, the Liao-
Takasaki office used the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Associa-
tion to send out requests to firms expecting to attend 
the Canton trade fair in the fall, instructing them to

responded. They held a denunciatory meeting in Tokyo, 
put forward "demands" that Sato lift the ban and rescind 
all other COCOM restrictions, and sent a five-man dele-
gation to protest to the Minister of International Trade 
and Industry, Wataro Kanno. Their activities gained them 
only a strong rebuff from Kanno, and Peking was left to 
lament that Sato, after all these years, "still sticks" 
to the COCOM regulations--an indirect admission of a major 
defeat for one aspect of Mao's policy toward Japan. (NCNA 
dispatch of 31 May 1967) 
Even in its moderate stages, Mao's policy toward 
Japan has been a failure. Tokyo continues to maintain 
close ties with the U.S. and Taiwan and has refused to 
recognize the Peking regime. The small successes in 
changing Japanese attitudes, attained by the flexible 
approach of Chou En-lai, have not been expanded into any 
major victory. More importantly, Mao undoubtedly is aware 
of the basic failure and may now believe (more than Chou 
believes) that there is nothing to lose in advancing the 
new revolutionary line. But the effect of this new line 
and the impact in Japan of news of his purge have been 
making it easy for Tokyo to resist pressures for a con-
ciliatory line toward China. A Japanese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman stated on 22 September 1966 that the Red Guard 
movement "has had a most deep and profound effect on the 
Japanese people, particularly the intellectuals, and it 
has caused them to observe China in a different light." 
Chou almost certainly has informed Mao that Japanese good-
will is being rapidly dissipated, and Chou has probably 
been the leader who encouraged Chen Yl to try to reassure 
Japanese visitors that there was nothing abominable in 
Red Guard abominations? But such efforts have had no ef-
fect, and the change to a criticial attitude toward Peking 
in the Japanese press, among intellectuals and leftists, 
and in parts of the business community has produced :or 
Tokyo's Foreign Mtnistry what one official described (to 
a U.S. embassy officer in August 1967) as "the easiest 
period in many years on the China question."

"big capitalists") to a more revolutionary struggle line 
against Tokyo (i.e., exploiting aggressive pro-Peking 
leftists and mobilizing Overseas Chinese) required a 
defense of Mao for previously having sanctioned the gra-
dual approach and alliance with tha jCP. The main part 
of this defense required the use of Mao's scapegoat pro-
cedure, which had been employed by the Chinese leader for 
many years after he had acquired it from observing Stalin's 
practice. 
The scapegoat procedure required (1) suppression 
or distortion of Mao's own earlier sanction for the policy 
and (2) attribution of the discarded policy to junior 
foreign policy officials whose lower position in the lead-
ership hierarchy made them vulnerable to the distorted 
charges. Regarding (1), although the record indicates 
that Mao personally included the "monopoly capitalists" 
in the gradual effort to pressure Tokyo toward recognition, 
Peking now avoids all mention of the fact, Regarding (2), 
a Red Guard newspaper on 18 June 1967 attacked Liao Cheng-
chih--a japan specialist, a subordinate of Chou En-lai, 
and the Deputy Director of Chou's State Council Foreign 
Affairs Office--for formulating the line which Mao himself 
had formulated (i.e., that "we must also work on the mono-
poly capitalists"). In addition to clearing Mao's name 
by this scapegoat procedure, Chou has used it in an ef-
fort to clear his own record, inasmuch as he has been the 
most active "rightist" (i.e., rational mind) in Japan 
policy. Chou has continued to be the dominant figure in  
policy toward Japan/ 
But Chou must now work in the narrowest political 
framework ever in policy toward Tokyo, especially at a 
time when Mao is training "red diplomatic fighters" who 
will "never praise the bourgeoisie in an unprincipled way 
or curry favor with them" (People's Daily editorial of 
28 June 1967). Because most Japanese faders, intellectuals, 
and businessmen are now undifferentiated members of "the 
bourgeoisie," the prospect is that his policy of reducing 
the categories of acceptable allies will further erode
