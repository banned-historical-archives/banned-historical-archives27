1960 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX 
tablishing justice and freedom. It is not too 
much to say that, while freedom from inva-
sion could be established by repelling in-
vaders, freedom and justice for the individ-
ual could not possibly be secured withOut 
the enactment of law defining individual 
rights and obligations. Since the time of 
Hammurabi and since the bringing of the 
Ten Commandments down from Mount Si-
nai, civilization has realized that there must 
be law in order to protect the rights of in-
dividuals, the family, and the community. 
Certain basic principles have developed. One 
of them is that we shall secure justice more 
completely under a rule of law than under 
a rule of men. Another is that individuals 
shall be equal before the law. Most import-
ant of all, the law in its gradual develop-
ment has always expressed an ethical pur-
pose. 
All of this has been a slow growth through 
the centuries but, as historians counted the 
gain, they rightly felt that tremendous ad-
vances had been made. And then, all at 
once, freedom and justice were destroyed be-
fore our eyes, first by Hitler and the Nazis 
and then by communism. We saw the hor-
rors not only of war, but also of the gas 
chambers, of slaughter of groups like the 
Polish officers at Katyn. Not only has life 
been ruthlessly destroyed but human rights 
have been utterly disregarded through the 
concentration camp and the hideous system 
of forced labor. Countless millions through-
out the world live in terror because of 
"thought control" imposed by despotic gov-
ernments. The little Chinese tailor who cas-
ually rembzked that "the cloth was not so 
good as formerly" is subject to a charge of 
wrong thinking, of being deviationist and 
antirevolutionary. And this is a charge car-
rying a sentence of forced labor or even 
death. We know now the cruelties of the 
denunciation process in which men and wo-
men supplied with printed forms for the 
purpose are urged, under heavy penalty of 
refusal, to accuse their friends, their neigh-
bors, their fathers, their mothers, their wives, 
their husbands, their children. Through 
vast areas of the world freedom and justice 
have been destroyed, and why? Because 
Stalin spoke, the Polabor? spoke, and 
Mao Tse-tung speaks, and that is the law. 
Today in vast and powerful countries we 
have the rule of men, not of law, and so in 
these countries freedom and justice are 
abolished. 
In Soviet Russia, Vyshinsky and Undrev-
ich, in their book on Soviet law attack the 
idea of penologists who "hold the view that 
the purpose of a court is to apply the law 
and to apply it uniformly to all classes of 
society." They thus ring the death knell 
for equality before the law. To hold such 
a view, according to Vyshinsky, is to "ignore 
the task of stamping out our class enemies" 
and "to emasculate the class content of 
judicial practice." As Vyshinsky states: 
"The law of the Soviet regime is a political 
directive and a judge's work is not to apply 
the law according to the requirements of 
burgeois legal logic, but to execute the law 
unwaveringly as an expression of the policy 
of the party and the government." In a 
later passage it is explained that "the Soviet 
State openly repudiates the 'political inde-
pendence of judges * * *. We openly re-
quire our judges to carry out the policy of 
the proletarian dictatorship ? ? s." Thus 
openly is abandoned the principle of justice 
applicable to all persons, even against the 
state itself. Written constitutions purport 
to establish freedom of speech, of public 
meeting, of the press, of association, etc.: 
but the laws as interpreted set aside these 
constitutional declarations. This is in ac-
cord with Soviet law, for, as declared by the 
Law Institute of the Academy of Science in 
Moscow, a party directive has the force of 
law. This explains why in Russia, the gov-
ernment is so willing to ratify treaties. It is 
bound only by the directive of the party. If 
the directive conflicts with the constitution, 
or with the treaty, or with any express law, 
the directive of the party controls. 
I am aware that in certain directions Rus-
sia has relaxed the rule of terror and the 
abuses of the secret police. But eminent po-
litical scientists recognize that this rule 
as to judges still is in force. 
In these days then, when we see the ethical 
basis of law attacked, when we see govern-
ment of men, not of laws, government which 
openly repudiates the equality of men before 
the law, their right to personal freedom, 
their right to work at whatever calling they 
choose, when, in a word, the principles of 
justice are discarded in powerful countries, 
*e as lawyers, face a specific challenge. It 
is not enough for us to enjoy employment 
in a luctrative, learned, and honorable pro-
fession. It is not enough to practice law 
ethically. We have to help teach the coming 
race the ethical basis of law. We have to 
fight as lawyers against the movement to 
abolish the conception of right and justice 
which lie at the basis of civilization. 
The Constitution of the United States, a 
landmark in organized law, was not only 
written by lawyers but its purpose and mean-
ing were explained by lawyers. Never before 
in history had such a pamphlet been issued 
to the world as the Federalist. Never before 
has such a legal classic been written at the 
founding of a government. The very ?reason 
it was written was that lawyers recognized 
their obligation in this crisis to teach and 
lead the people. Hamilton, Madison, and 
John Jay in eloquence as simple as it was 
profound, explained the various proposals of 
the Constitution and their significance in 
the building of that Union so essential to 
the maintenance of peace and freedom. In 
these distinguished essays they won the 
support, not only of Washington and Jeffer-
son but of the man in the street. It is not 
too much to say that, if the Federalist had 
not been written, if Hamilton had not ex-
plained the Constitution to New York, and if 
Madison had not performed a similar serv-
ice in Virginia, the Constitution would not 
have been adopted. 
Exactly the same public service is de-
manded of lawyers and of laymen today. 
Unless we inspire the coming race with a 
conception of the ethical basis of law, the 
precious freedom built up through the cen-
turies will inevitably be destroyed. The 
ethical basis of law implemented in the free 
countries is the real defense against com-
munism. And to the protection of this 
ethical system of law every member of the 
bar, and every true American, is called. This 
Is today at once our challenge and our

The Great White Fleet?A Step Forward 
Toward World Peace 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. KENNETH B. KEATING 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Tuesday, June 28, 1960 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. President, the re-
cent tragic disasters in Chile and other 
manifestations of nature's wrath around 
the world have served to focus atten-
tion once more on the proposal to estab-
lish a Great White Fleet. A vehicle for 
the creation of this great humanitarian 
armada is Senate Concurrent Resolution 
66, which I am proud to be one of the 
cosponsors. 
STAT 
A5573 
In my view, this mercy fleet could 
carry to the corners of the world a mes-
sage of America as it really is today?
dedicated to helping people everywhere 
to build healthier, happier lives. It is 
my hope that the recent tragedies in 
Chile and elsewhere, regrettable as they 
are, will help speed progress on this pro-
posal which can mean so much in the 
cause of world peace and understanding. 
The man who first suggested the Great 
White Fleet, Comdr, Frank A. Manson, 
recently delivered an interesting address 
on this subject. I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be printed in the Appendix 
of the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE WHITE FLEET 
(By Comdr. Frank A. Manson, U.S. Navy, 
before the London International Chapter 
of the National Defense Transportation 
Association, London, England, May 17, 
1960) 
I am fully conscious of the honor it is to 
address this distinguished group of Anglo-, 
American executives and their guests. It is 
with pleasure and humility that I discuss the 
White Fleet, a topic close to my conscience, 
and the one which you chose for me. 
This being my first public statement on 
the White Fleet since Life published the 
original proposal last July, I feel particularly 
rewarded to exchange views with a group of 
transportation authorities. Economic trans-
portation is one of the keys to the success 
of the White Fleet, the economic transporta-
tion of one nation's strength to another na-
tion's weakness. 
Undoubtedly many of you have not heard 
of the White Fleet until this moment. 
Therefore, I think I should begin by briefly 
clescribing what it is. Since this is an Anglo-
American audience I should also say at the 
outset that the White Fleet idea was first 
presented to the people of the United States. 
Some people have asked why I did not take 
the original proposition to something like 
NATO. SEATO, or to the United Nations and 
call for the creation of a worldwide White 
Fleet. / did not have sufficient data from 
countries, other than my own, to conclude 
that this would be a feasible proposition. 
I had no inkling how such a thing would be 
received and furthermore, I felt it was pru-
dent to see what my fellow citizens thought 
of it before I presented it elsewhere. Al-
though I felt in my heart that American 
reaction would be favorable I had no way of 
knowing for sure. Nor did I know what the 
reaction would be in newly developing coun-
tries. So much currently is facing humanity. 
Essentially the White Fleet is a new instru-
ment for harnessing America's strength po-
tential into her mothball fleets to help make 
the benefit of civilization available to the 
newly developing countries. 
In view of such programs as the Marshall 
plan and point 4, which to my mind sym-
bolize the real care of U.S. thinking, I did 
not consider that the White Fleet represented 
a radical departure from past U.S. efforts. 
A White Fleet of mercy ships is something 
tangible. It is something that people, re-
gardless of their education or station in life, 
can see and comprehend. Its only motives 
are humanitarian and these motives are easy 
to understand. They are difficult to distort, 
and this, I feel, will be of increasing impor-
tance as we move into the sixties. 
The exact composition of the White Fleet 
Will vary depending on the mission. Its over-
all capability will include ships designed to 
render assistance in such fields as elementary 
education, agriculture, nutrition, medicine, 
various types of engineering specialties, elec-
trical power and research and these are by

no means all. The ships will be combat 
loaded to fight the many human problems 
which beset newly developing countries. The 
, long-range missions is to help people who 
want to help themselves and become self-
supporting. 
The real purpose of the White Fleet is to 
render technical assistance in areas of con-
tinuing need. Additionally the White Fleet 
should prove helpful in times of disaster and 
? crisis such as those brought about by floods, 
earthquakes, and storms. While dramatic, I 
do not envision that the disaster capability 
of the While Fleet will provide its most im-
portant function. In the first place, the 
V.S. Navy, which is now deployed world-
wide, has demonstrated time and again that 
it can render emergency assistance within a 
matter of hours to virtually any spot in the 
world. This type of emergency service is al-
ready in being and would hardly provide the 
best utilization of the White Fleet. In some 
instances, such as Agadir, the Navy might 
call for the assistance of the White Fleet 
after it has handled the most urgent part 
of the situation. 
Many people have asked me whether a 
White Fleet would have been useful at Ag-
adir in view of the tremendous emergency 
support rendered by the military and ci-
vilian personnel of many Western countries. 
I went to Agadir in connection with my 
official Navy duties and frankly I don't see 
? how the rescue operations during those first 
few hours or first few days could have been 
greatly improved. The French Navy, with 
a base at Agadir, began rescue operations 
within a matter of hours as did the U.S. 
Navy and U.S. Air Force. Soon the military 
and civilian forces of other nations were 
sending various types of assistance. We 
sent out a call for clothing and food from 
our Naval headquarters in London and the 
response was so overwhelming and the ton-
nage so great that a ship had to be sent 
from Norfolk to make the final delivery. 
But the military forces could only stay 
in Agadir during the most agonizing part 
of the emergency. They all had their jobs 
to do and they had to return to their as-
signed military duties. A French doctor at 
Agadir who knew of the concept said the 
White Fleet would have proved most useful 
after the military forces had completed the 
dramatic rescue operations. 
The situation today in Agadir appears 
most appropriate for a White Fleet opera-
tion. The city is in shambles, about 90 
percent destroyed; it is without electric 
power or a water system. Most of the sur-
vivors are living in tents-24 canvas cots to 
a tent. Many of the people still walk half 
dazed about the countryside. There are no 
schools. The medical clinics and maternity 
wards are nothing more than canvas cots 
on the bare earth. The people are in need 
of a continuing supply of the basic neces-
sities until they can get themselves organ-
ized once again. The city of Agadir is in 
need of technical assistance?and this will 
be so for some time to come. In fact there 
is virtually no White Fleet capability en-
visaged which could not be utilized in Aga-
dir because virtually everything was lost. 
But Agadir is only one part of Morocco 
where the White Fleet could serve a worth-
while purpose. 
I use Agadir as an example because pub-
lic attention has been recently directed 
there. There are literally hundreds of situ-
ations in Africa, Asia, and South America 
that lend themselves to a White Fleet 
solution. 
Now, a few words about the future of the 
White Fleet. The idea continues to grow in 
the United States and throughout the West-
ern World. Only recently I received a letter 
from a friend in Africa enclosing a clipping 
of a ship recently acquired by the Indonesi-
an Government to light against yaws. It is 
a floating dispensary and its only mission is 
to examine the population for yaws and 
treat all the cases which it finds. This is 
very heartening to know that such a ship is 
now in existence. A few weeks ago a poultry 
processing group in the United Kingdom 
contacted me regarding the feasibility of 
in:stalling some sort of a poultry processing 
unit in the White Fleet. They said they 
thought it would be possible and effective. 
Then only a few days ago I received a letter 
from a manufacturer here in London and I 
quote from his letter. "I have reread the 
Life article on the White Fleet and am more 
than ever assured of the importance of this 
concept of aid to stricken areas. I can 
say on behalf of my company that we pledge 
what support we can give to you and the 
American organizers of this effort. * * * 
While the material support we can give will 
necessarily be small compared to the vast-
ness of the enterprise?it could be im-
portant. Our Dexion material is a funda-
mental basis for building almost anything." 
I had never heard of Dexion material until 
I received this letter. I have subsequently 
investigated the material and discovered 
they can build anything from a school desk 
to a medical clinic. Actually it is what I 
call a man-sized erector set and it is such a 
marvelous idea that I am surprised it was 
not thought of years ago. In any event, I 
am delighted with this generous offer and 
am forwarding it to the White Fleet sponsors 
in the United States. 
The first ship to sail from the United 
States will be the SS Hope, as the sponsors 
of the White Fleet and those responsible 
for Project Hope have joined forces. I am 
confident that this ship, whose first call is 
Indonesia, will emphasize the urgency of the 
White Fleet. I personally hope that the next 
White Fleet ship will be an LST, a landing 
ship tank. It is inexpensive to activate and 
operate and can gain access to most any 
coastal area. It can be multipurpose, carry-
ing an assortment of capabilities and be most 
useful in numerous situations. Other types 
of amphibious ships and merchant hulls 
should be considered for the White Fleet. 
Some people have suggested that the nu-
clear-powered merchant ship Savannah 
would make an excellent White Fleet flagship. 
I do not know of the plans for Savannah 
but feel that this suggestion is worth con-
sideration. 
A few people have thought that I advo-
cated Defense Department sponsorship of 
the White Fleet and budgetary support from 
the U.S. Navy. I have never entertained 
this thought nor would I recommend it. In 
fact I feel that such a policy might prove 
self-defeating. To organize and operate a 
White Fleet at the expense of military and 
naval preparedness would be foolhardy. Our 
defense funds are needed to meet the very 
real military challenge confronting the 
Western World. Financial support should 
come from civilian sources. 
As to the long-range implications of the 
White Fleet, I am ? reminded of the recent 
talk with one of England's most gracious 
and talented people. As we walked about 
his estate looking at the beautiful gardenS 
and trees he said that the White Fleet had 
brought to mind three people he knew who 
had planted gardens. One man had planted 
his garden studiously, with the careful 
planning of an industrious banker. He 
walked the grounds many times before he 
spotted the first plant. When he had fin-
ished his planting his garden was beautiful, 
it was professional, but it had required a 
rather long period to complete the project. 
The second man had planted his garden 
with a reckless abandon of a Johnny Apple-
seed. While there was no particular de-
sign or discernible pattern to his work he 
had utterly blanketed his estate in beauti-
ful flowers. The third man that he knew 
lived near the Scottish border. He had 
planted no flowers at all. Instead he had 
torn down the old buildings and replaced 
June 28 
them with beautiful stone structures. My 
friend told this man that these structures 
should last for a generation and the man 
replied, "I intend for them to last for at 
least three generations." "But where are 
your flowers?" my friend asked. The man 
replied that he had no flowers and he point-
ed to a group of small trees and. stated "I 
planted trees instead. There is something 
about trees which reflect a man's faith in 
future generations. There iS something 
about trees that is indestructible." 
Gentlemen, I would like to close with the 
suggestion that what my friend said about 
trees also applies to the White Fleet. There 
is something about this plan that suggests 
faith in future generations and the inde-
structibility of ships. I have said many 
times that I have no illusions that the 
White Fleet will bring peace in one sweep-
ing movement. Peace can only come a bit 
at a time, but one step forward is worth-
while and I am confident that the White 
Fleet is a step forward.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDMUND S. MUSKIE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Tuesday, June 28, 1960 
Mr. MUSKIE. Mr. President, on 
March 28, 29, and 30, Mrs. May Craig 
published three columns which were 
printed in various Maine newspapers. 
In the first, Mrs. Craig tells of Ethi-
opia's rich products and customs. 
In the second, she recounts an un-
precedented conference with his Im-
perial Majesty, Haile Selassie, Emperor 
of Ethiopia. 
In the third, she describes the Repub-
lic of Sudan as a "benevolent dictator-
ship." 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have these three articles printed 
in the Appendix of the RECORD. 
There being no abjection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
AFRICA ON THE MOVE?COFFEE WAS ONE OF 
ETHIOPIA'S FAMOUS SPICES 
(By May Craig) 
ADDIS ABABA.?If you drink the best mix-
tures of U.S. coffee, you get Ethiopian coffee 
blended into it because this is the home of 
coffee, originating in the province of Kaff a, 
and was one of the famous "spices" for 
which ancient Ethiopia was famous. The 
country is rich in rivers, forests, minerals. 
There is power in the Blue Nile as it drops 
5,500 feet through gorges sometimes 4,000 
feet deep before it gets to the plain of Sudan 
where it meets the White Nile at Khartoum. 
She has fertile soil, abundant seasonal rain-
fall, year-round growing season. It is no 
wonder Mussolini tried to take Ethiopia to 
feed the Italians as he set up collective 
farms in the green hills that rim the North-
ern Mediterranean opposite Italy. Since his-
tory began, there have been struggles for 
land, food, cattle?now for minerals and oil. 
The language here resembles Hebrew, 
Arabic, and other semitic languages, since 
the origin of the people is Hamitic and Se-
mitic. The language is called Amharic, and 
English is the second language. When we 
asked our Ambassador, Don C. Bliss (Ver-
mont, Dartmouth), whether any of his staff 
spoke the language, he said his wife did,
