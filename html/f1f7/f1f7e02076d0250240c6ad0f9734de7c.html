 The Politics of
 Corruption in China
 Key Judgments          Beijing's anticorruption campaign poses a dilemma for China's reform
 leadership. Some leaders, most prominently Chen Yuri, see the campaign
 as an effective way to improve the party's blackened image and to discredit
 the critics of reform. Deng Xiaoping, however, apparently has reservations
 about the effort. If not handled with the utmost care, it could boomerang,
 threaten Deng's political allies, further tarnish the party's image, and
 discredit the very policies that the reformers seek to advance.

 Secret
 The Politics of
 Corruption in China
 A "Life or Death Matter"
 Beijing launched the anticorruption campaign in Jan-
 uary with a propaganda blitz promoting the elimina-
 tion of smuggling, bribery, profiteering, speculation,
 and graft as well as their causes. The "Decision on
 Economic Crimes," jointly issued by the Central
 Committee and the State Council on 13 April, specifi-
 cally targeted crimes involving large economic losses
 and party or state officials. Official and unofficial
 commentary implied that senior political figures
 would be indicted and that a few serious violators
 would be executed as examples.
 Politburo member Chen Yun-after Deng perhaps
 the most esteemed figure in China and the leader
 most closely associated with efforts to restore party
 discipline- flexed his political muscles to win a eam-
 paign against economic crimes.
 Deep concern about the party's image and the specter
 of Poland must have figured in the leadership's
 deliberations. Chen has called the rehabilitation of
 party prestige and the correction of its work style "a
 matter of life or death for the party." Party docu-
 ments and editorial comment indicate that the Chi-
 nese leadership has drawn one lesson from events in
 Poland: party degeneration begets social disorder; a
 party lacking credibility can no longer rule. The
 Cultural Revolution, the privileged lifestyle of party
 cadres, and the well-known excesses of relatives of
 senior officials have led many Chinese  particularly
 intellectuals and youth  to conclude that the party is
 spiritually bankrupt, is devoid of its earlier vision and
 dynamism, and now merely seeks its own preservation
 and preferment for its members, their families, and
 friends. A crackdown on corruption would help initi-
 ate the long process of restoring the party's legitima-
 side effects
 The reformers also saw a need to absolve their
 program from the widespread criminal abuses that
 had become popularly associated with it. Critics of
 reform have argued privately and in the media
 whether from conviction or political expedience  that
 the reform measures themselves are responsible for 25X1
 the increased corruption among party, state, and
 military officials. Indeed, the critics cite official cor-
 ruption as clear evidence that Deng's program is
 flawed, that it appeals to the baser, acquisitive in- 25X1
 stincts, and that the reforms have unleased these
 instincts with destabilizing effect. The anticorruption
 drive is intended to refute this argument and to    25X1
 further isolate those party conservatives who would
 "stop eating for fear of choking"  that is, who would
 rather halt the reforms than live with the unintended
 Dilemmas
 Having promoted the anticorruption campaign as one
 of two overriding tasks of 1982, we believe Deng and
 his associates cannot abandon it without further
 damaging the party's image. Nor can they afford to
 permit the corrupt practices to continue, because such
 abuses undercut the effectiveness of the reforms and,
 more importantly, increase the political capital of
 critics. A full-fledged assault on cadre corruption,
 however, would implicate some members of the re-
 form coalition and other high officials whom the
 reformers wish to protect; it would, moreover, alienate
 allies who value the campaign less highly than other
 political goals. Yet, a failure to deal with corrupt
 senior officials fuels public cynicism and diminishes
 the leadership's credibility.

 Secret
 Protecting Friends. Beijing has decided to avoid
 indicting senior officials or even admitting the possi-
 bility of misconduct in China's upper political stra-
 tum. A speech by then Deputy Propaganda Depart-
 ment Chief Zhu Muzhi-now Minister of Culture-
 which has been circulated as official guidance,
 stressed that propaganda should assure the Chinese
 people that senior officials would never commit eco-
 nomic crimes.
 Deng's
 apparent reluctance to unfold a nationwide campaign
 demonstrates his awareness of its potential dangers.
 The leader whose name is whispered most frequently
 in connection with corruption is Ye Jianying, aged
 and ailing member of the Politburo Standing Com-
 mittee and Chairman of the National People's Con-
 gress. Ye is widely rumored to dispense patronage to
 his large family and their associates in south China
 and to provide protection for their shady enterprises.
 Ye has differed with Deng in the past but is apparent-
 ly going along with present reformist initiatives and
 thus is unlikely to become a target of a corruption
 expose. He remains useful in preserving the current
 leadership consensus and, as a respected "old mar-
 shal," in keeping the military in line. Deng therefore
 appears to be in the difficult position of having to
 accommodate a formidable and independent-minded
 ally, Chen Yuri, while preserving the appearance of
 leadership unity that in part depends upon coopera-
 tion from the influential Ye.
 Apart from the question of Ye, the larger concern is
 to restrict the scope of the investigations. Once the
 prohibition against high-level disclosures is breached,
 virtually everyone at the top becomes vulnerable.
 Geng Biao, the Minister of Defense, and Chen
 Muhua, the new Minister of Foreign Economic Rela-
 tions and Trade, were denied places on the party
 Secretariat for abusing their high rank. Both have
 generally supported reform policies. Most of the
 members of the Politburo Standing Committee and
 many other Politburo and Central Committee mem-
 bers have relatives studying abroad. The sheltered,
 privileged lives of the topmost leadership can at many
 points be exaggerated into tales of Sybaritic indul- 25X1
 gence. Hence the discussion of malfeasance among
 high leaders needs to be prevented, because Deng and
 his associates might, as the Chinese saying goes, "be
 lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet."
 The case of Yang Yibang, who was Vice Minister of
 Chemical Industry and General Director of the Yan-
 shan petrochemical works, illustrates how Beijing is
 attempting to have it both ways on this issue. In 1979
 Yang was criticized for improprieties in dealing with
 foreigners; he received additional criticism at the
 National People's Congress in 1980, when his story
 leaked to the Hong Kong media. In early 1981 the 25X1
 Discipline Inspection Commission decided to take
 formal action against him. For a year, however,
 nothing was done. Then, in February or March 1982,
 the Commission circulated a notice to party cadre
 stating that Yang had received a "serious party
 warning" for his offenses. Still, the listed transgres-
 sions were distinctly minor: accepting small appli-
 ances as alleged bribes and arranging for a foreigner

 Approved For Release 2008/07/29: CIA-RDP03TO2547R000100800001-3
 to adopt a Chinese orphan. As though to soften even
 this mild censure, the circular also noted that Yang
 had been a high achiever in his ministry and that he
 would probably learn his lesson and continue his good
 work
 Yang's ties to senior officials almost certainly pre-
 vented the Commission from taking sterner action
 earlier.                                 ang's
 powerful friends include ormer party   airman Hua
 Guofeng, former Vice Premiers Yu Qiuli and Kang
 Shien-newly named "state councilors"-and Minis-
 ter of Agriculture, Forestry, and Aquatic Products
 and former Beijing party boss Lin Hujia. Although
 their political fortunes are in decline, Yang's patrons
 have retained high official positions and contribute to
 the image of stability at the top so valued by the
 Chinese. Any deeper inquiry into Yang's case
 perhaps to question why he was not disciplined in
 1979 when his problems first surfaced  would impli-
 cate his protectors, threaten other high officials, and
 create fresh splits among the leadership.
 Some officials within the party have objected to such
 kid glove treatment and have strenuously argued that
 no one should be exempt from the glare of public
 disclosure. The US Embassy, for example, reported
 that Hu Jiwei, editor of People's Daily, had been
 ordered against his wishes not to print articles on the
 involvement of senior officials in criminal acts. Ap-
 parently in response to this muzzle order, Ruo Shui-
 a probable pseudonym for Hu's deputy editor, Wang
 Ruoshui-published a piece in the 25 February edi-
 tion arguing by analogy that it is the newswriter's
 duty to record faithfully the misdeeds of the mighty.
 Ruo also alluded to high-level pressure that can
 prevent the press from fulfilling this duty.
 Protecting the Reforms. We believe the 13 April
 Decision was, among other things, an attempt by the
 reformers to curtail an open debate on the principal
 cause for the increase in economic crimes involving
 officials. In the months before Beijing expressed itself
 authoritatively, media commentators appeared to dif-
 fer on the extent to which the Third Plenum policies
 were responsible. Some not firmly within the reform
 camp, such as Secretariat member Wang Renzhong
 and an unidentified "commentator" within the Gener-
 al Political Department of the People's Liberation
 Figure 4. Yang Yibang-guilty
 of influence peddlingF--]
 Army, placed substantially greater emphasis on the
 corrupting effect of foreign influences and, especially,
 "bourgeois ideology."
 Apart from concern over the impact of reforms on
 social order, the motives of conservative critics are
 unclear but are almost certainly related to the other
 political business of 1982: the state reforms, party
 rectification, and the 12th Party Congress. Deng has
 previously made concessions to critics who pressed
 him on the social order question. Consequently, the
 need to reduce his vulnerability on this issue will
 almost certainly work to constrain additional policy
 initiatives now under consideration. The reformers
 also must beware of the latent xenophobia running
 just beneath the corruption campaign. Too strident a
 tone against "bourgeois" Western values threatens to
 activate antiforeign sentiments among the population;
 Deng and his allies would prefer to keep these senti-
 ments dormant.
 Conservative criticism and other such rumblings have
 a dual and-from Deng's presumed point of view-
 negative effect. In the absence of authoritative pro-
 nouncements such as that issued on 13 April, such

 Secret
 criticism legitimizes an avenue of opposition to reform
 policies. It also unnerves loyal supporters of the
 reform program who anxiously view such expressions
 as harbingers of possible policy reversal. Therefore, in
 the 13 April Decision and subsequent commentary,
 the reformers have sought to curtail public discussion
 by generally absolving present policy and by clearly
 blaming the weakness of individual members for the
 rise in corruption. As a People's Daily "commenta-
 tor" recently argued, the program is justified by
 experience, is "completely correct," and "the achieve-
 ments gained outweigh anything else."
 Still, the reformers have had to concede in media
 commentary that their policies are partially responsi-
 ble for official corruption but have shifted the primary
 blame to safe or politically useful targets. While
 acknowledging that the reforms have created loop-
 holes that would-be criminals can exploit, the reform-
 ers emphasize the role of Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and
 the Cultural Revolution in creating the conditions -a
 general erosion of respect for law, moral standards,
 and so forth-that encourage weak-willed Chinese to
 follow their acquisitive desires. At the same time, the
 reformers have found it useful to pin the primary
 blame on shortcomings within the party and state,
 thereby providing a convenient rationale for further
 reforms. By such tactics, the party and state are held
 culpable for failing to establish effective political,
 ideological, and administrative measures to immunize
 Chinese society from germs that blow in through the
 open door.
 The Months Ahead
 In keeping with official prescriptions and with Deng's
 preferences, the campaign against economic crimes
 has been moderate. Moreover, it has taken a clear
 second place in action, if not in media coverage, to the
 state reorganization. We expect the campaign will
 wind down and disappear in two or three months, as
 the party and state address the other important tasks
 of 1982. Even if Deng acquiesced under pressure to
 the anticorruption drive, he appears to be running it
 his way, and there are no signs that it will exceed its
 established bounds
 Despite efforts to limit the scope of the campaign, the
 level of corruption probably will be reduced, at least
 for the short term. New, stiff penalties  including
 25X1
 25X1
 capital punishment for some serious offenses  came
 into effect on I May, and public security and legal
 departments are busily expanding to meet the expect-
 ed surge in business. Further, local Discipline Inspec-
 tion Committees have been activated and will now
 serve as permanent "guardians of the guardians." The
 campaign will probably peak in late May or early
 June, when the new penalties begin to take hold and
 the propaganda organs have a chance to trumpet a
 few exemplary cases of misdeeds, which are certain to
 provoke severe punishment  all to the "immense sat-
 isfaction of the people." The party's demonstration of
 determination probably will have a deterrent effect at
 the local level.
 The party's ability to use the anticorruption campaign
 to improve its image will depend more on the success
 of the state reforms, party rectification, and Beijing's
 economic policies. If, in the course of the campaign,
 the party treats high officials as untouchables, it will
 only reinforce the perception of the party as a benevo-
 lent society for the corrupt.
 Beijing's convoluted defense of its reform program
 will not satisfy those critics who point to the pro-
 ram's undesirable side effects. However, the reform-
 ers have shown themselves to be adept at co-opting
 25X1

 the high ground of principle. Recent press commen-
 tary seems intended to disarm critics by acknowledg-
 ing the harmful results of the reforms while stressing
 their overriding benefits. Deng will have to deflect
 criticism of his program continually and further iso-
 late his opponents who, as the 12th Party Congress
 approaches, will seek to utilize any political handhold
 to forestall a sweep for the reformers. However, the
 critics in the party and state should become fewer in
 number and weaker in political strength as the con-
 gress draws close and personnel reforms proceed.                                                     25X1
