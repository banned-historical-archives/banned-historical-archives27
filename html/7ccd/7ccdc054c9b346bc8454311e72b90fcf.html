 FAR EAST
 Indochina
 President Thieu has not only succeeded in
 denying Vice President Ky a chance to compete
 in the election, but he may also have so discour-
 aged Big Minh by the heavy-handed methods of
 the government's powerful political machine, that
 Minh, too, will abandon the contest and leave
 Thieu with an empty victory.
 Ky has been disdainful of filing a formal
 appeal  against his disqualification with the
 Supreme Court, and the final deadline for doing
 so has now passed. Ky has maintained that the
 court's first listing of the candidates was illegal
 because it was not determined by a full sitting of
 the court. He also claims that he has a constitu-
 tional right to Supreme Court review without
 having to submit an appeal, but neither argument
 is likely to carry much weight with the court.
 Although his legal options have been played out,
 Ky has remained in the public eye. wearing a
 somewhat unaccustomed martyr's halo. If Minh
 remains in the presidential race, public sympathy
 for Ky will undoubtedly be short-lived.
 Minh, however, is under considerable pres-
 sure from his advisers to withdraw from the elec-
 tion because of alleged fraudulent electioneering
 practices by the government. It now appears
 likely that he will pull out, although he may delay
 his decision until the last possible moment-24
 August, when the second posting of the candi-
 dates is announced-in the hope that the US may
 somehow intervene in his favor. Minh has shown
 little taste or energy for political infighting, and it
 is doubtful that he would take up the role of
 "leader of the opposition." Should he withdraw
 as he is threatening, Ky could remain a prominent
 opposition spokesman and continue to be a thorn
 in Thieu's side.
 Thieu's success in forcing Ky out of the
 election and the substantial advantage he enjoys
 over Big Minh by virtue of his control of the
 government bureaucracy have no doubt assured
 him of victory, but they have also tended to
 discredit him in the public eye. Thieu is coming
 under criticism from some independent and pro-
 government elements, as well as from the opposi-
 tion, with regard to Ky's disqualification. Many
 government supporters apparently believe Thieu's
 ham-fisted exclusion of Ky was a mistake which
 could backfire and hurt the President's political
 position; others are concerned that the affair
 damages the country's young constitutional sys-
 tem.

 If Minh now withdraws and can convincingly
 argue that the election was fraudulently arranged
 against him, public disillusionment will increase,
 not only with the Thieu regime, but probably
 with the constitutional system as well. Thieu then
 could well face an opposition once again com-
 mitted to more violent means of protest.
 The first fairly clear indication of the reac-
 tion by the public to Ky's elimination-and to
 Minh's withdrawal if he goes through with it-is
 likely to be provided by the Lower House elec-
 tion on 29 August. If most government-backed
 Lower House candidates do about as well as ex-
 pected, Thieu is likely to read this as evidence
 that his tactics have not damaged the domestic
 position of his government. Others would not
 share this view, of course, if many government
 candidates seem to have won by virture of unfair
 official interference in their behalf. If, however,
 opposition candidates should do unexpectedly
 well, perhaps winning a majority of the seats in
 the House, most politically conscious Vietnamese
 would probably regard this as a repudiation of
 Thieu and his recent tactics.
 North Vietnamese forces this week carried
 out their heaviest attacks since early summer in
 the area just south of the Demilitarized Zone.
 Enemy troops mounted a strong ground assault
 against South Vietnamese  Marines,  inflicting
 heavy losses and forcing them from hilltop posi-
 tions. North Vietnamese forces also hit the net-
 work of South Vietnamese strongpoints with ar-
 tillery and rockets.
 Elsewhere in South Vietnam, the week was
 generally quiet but evidence continues to suggest
 Page 2
 that the Communists plan to increase action just
 before the Lower House elections on 29 August.
 iFarther
 south 1-here-have been new reports that Commu-
 nist forces are moving closer to Saigon from the
 Cambodian border area.
 The Communists are capable of conducting
 small attacks in many areas before the elections.
 It is only along the DMZ and near Saigon, how-
 ever, that they threaten to press heavier attacks
 that could go beyond their limited initiatives of
 recent months. It still appears that enemy mili-
 tary and terrorist actions will ease on election day
 when, in a shift from their usual tactics aimed at
 discrediting elections, Communist cadre in some
 areas will encourage voters to su  ort certain
 "progressive" candidates.
 Cambodia: Serving Notice on Saigon
 The always delicate relations between the
 Cambodians and the South Vietnamese may be
 subjected to new complications as a result of
 Phnom Penh's efforts to reduce its military de-
 pendence on Saigon. According to a plan recently
 drawn up by Phnom Penh, the Cambodian Navy

 (MNK) is to assume full command and control
 responsibility from the South Vietnamese Navy
 for escorting and protecting all ship convoys on
 the Mekong River on 1 September-rather than
 gradually taking over those duties as had been
 recommended by South Vietnamese and US offi-
 cials. The Cambodians have let the South Viet-
 namese know that they also want to assume re-
 sponsibility for all riverbank security operations,
 but no firm arrangements apparently have been
 reached yet.
 A senior MNK officer has stated that the
 Cambodians want to have immediate, complete
 control of military operations on the Mekong
 because they cannot work with the South Viet-
 namese with the "mutual trust" that a phased
 turnover would require. There are indications,
 however, that the Cambodians are ill-prepared
 and equipped to replace the South Vietnamese in
 maintaining security along the river. The MNK,
 for example, has less than half the number of
 boats presently being used by the South Viet-
 namese and most of them are in bad condition.
 The MNK's support facilities are similarly inade-
 quate.
 It is likely that Phnom Penh's apparent
 determination to go forward with its plans has
 been influenced in large part by domestic political
 considerations. In addition to trying to demon-
 strate that it is becoming militarily more self-
 reliant, the Lon Nol government undoubtedly
 also wants to decrease the South Vietnamese
 presence in order to reduce the likelihood cf
 further depredations by South Vietnamese troops
 operating on Cambodian soil. Despite its recent
 moves,  however,  Phnom  Penh  probably
 recognizes that it will have to continue to rely on
 Saigon for many forms of military support for the
 foreseeable future.
 There are a number of indications that the
 recent easing of economic pressures in Phnom
 Penh is almost certainly temporary. Despite a
 high level of rice deliveries since early July,
 official stock figures indicate rice reserves in the
 capital  have  declined  substantially.  The gov-
 ernment has yet to take steps necessary to
 discourage hoarding, and its ability to obtain rice
 on concessional terms from Taiwan or Japan is
 uncertain- Although it still is too early to' make
 firm  predictions  about  next  year's  harvest,
 planting reportedly is lagging with only a month
 or so left in the planting season.
 The economy faces the prospect of further
 inflation even though the price of best-grade rice
 has recently declined and prices of other' com-
 modities  have  been  relatively  stable.' The
 government's foreign exchange position is at a
 near crisis level, and the International Monetary
 Fund  (IMF)  representative  in  Phnom  Penh
 believes a substantial devaluation of the riel to
 be imperative. The government has nevertheless
 postponed action on the potentially unpopular
 reform measures proposed by the IMF, which
 will have a negative impact on the willingness
 of  prospective donors  to  participate  in  the
 Exchange Support Fund, an arrangement now
 under  consideration  to    help  stabilize  the
 economy.
 The  North  Vietnamese  have  at       least
 temporarily halted the government's drive to
 retake Paksong on the Bolovens Plateau. Three

 approach the town from the northwest were
 forced to abandon their mission after they
 were hit hard by North Vietnamese units on
 11  August.  Elements of four battalions at-
 tempting to move east along Route 23 have
 been halted about four miles from Paksong by
 well-entrenched North Vietnamese troops.
 North of the Bolovens, the government
 has decided to return elements of the civilian
 government to Saravane and garrison the town
 with  regular  army  troops.  The  government
 presence   probably  will  be maintained only
 until such time as North Vietnamese pressure
 on the town increases. Initially Saravane was
 considered purely a tactical target in this part
 of the government's rainy season offensive in
 south  Laos,  but the government apparently
 now sees political and psychological benefits in
 retaining control of the town for a time.
 Developments in the North
 The Communists have inflicted a setback
 on government troops operating east of the Plaine
 des James. On 16 August, some 100 to 200 North
 Vietnamese troops overran four irregular po-
 sitions about six miles west of Xieng Khou-
 angville. Elements of three irregular battalions
 occupying these positions withdrew to the south
 and the west. Military activity was light elsewhere
 in the area, with several small clashes and shelling
 attacks in the north and northeast Plaine.
 The government operation to retake Muong
 Soui, the former neutralist headquarters west of
 the Plaine, has progressed very slowly. The for-
 ward movement of the three-battalion force has
 been impeded by Communist harassing attacks
 and bad weather which has caused mud slides
 along  Route 71 and has limited air sup-
 port.

 Sinn-Burmese Relations:  Best Foot Forward
 Considerable cordiality prevailed throughout
 Prime Minister Ne Win's visit to China last week,
 but relations have yet to reach the warmth of
 pre - Cultural Revolution days. The Chinese went
 to some length to flatter Ne Win; he was honored
 by a visit with Mao Tse-tung and was personally
 accompanied from Pekin  to Canton b  Chou
 En-lai.
 Talks with Chinese leaders were conducted in a
 "friendly and down-to-earth atmosphere," which,
 according to the Burmese, did much "to put
 relations back on a sound footing."
 Despite this  private  cordiality,  however,
 treatment of the visit in Chinese media was rela-
 tively restrained. The official New China News
 Agency limited its coverage to straightforward
 reporting and so far has failed to publicize
 speeches made by either side. Its excerpts from
 Chou En-lai's toast at a banquet on 6 August
 typified Chinese public reserve. Chou expressed
 pleasure that Sino-Burmese relations "have re-
 turned to normal" and predicted that relations
 would improve further as a result of Ne Win's
 visit, but he omitted the standard reference on
 such occasions to the five principles of peaceful
 coexistence and failed to praise the achievements
 of the Burmese Government. No mention was
 made of the Sino-Burmese treaty of friendship
 and nonaggression.
 The visit, nonetheless, represents another
 step in a return to the friendly relations that
 existed prior to the 1967 anti-Chinese ripts in
 Burma. Indeed, the fact that the Chinese issued
 the invitation at this time suggests they' were
 prepared to discuss such thorny problems as con-
 tinuing Chinese support to Burmese insur a is-a
 major bone of contention with Rangoon.
 There may have been a meeting of minds,
 nonetheless, on the question of the Overseas
 Chinese in Burma. The Chinese apparently con-
 vinced the Burmese that Peking's courtship of the
 Overseas Chinese, which led to the disturbances
 four years ago, is over. Peking's reassurances on
 this score appear to be part of a new approach to
 Chinese living abroad, which, as Chou En-lai re-
 cently made clear to a visiting Malaysian delega-
 tion, is to encourage Overseas Chinese to integrate
 themselves more completely as citizens of the
 country in which they are living.
 the recent resumption of Chinese

 pure ases of Burmese rice and the improved po-
 litical relations will almost certainly in time lead
 to greater exchanges. However, there has been no
 information on a possible renewal of Chinese
 economic assistance to Burma.              25X1

 Korea: New Flexibility on Both Sides
 The agreement for direct bilateral talks be-
 tween North and South Korean Red Cross repre-
 sentatives at Panmunjom on the problem of di-
 vided families is but one of many recent indica-
 tions of a significant new flexibility in South
 Korean foreign policy. In testimony before the
 Foreign Affairs Committee of the National As-
 sembly on 16 August, one cabinet officer even
 acknowledged the possibility of eventual official
 bilateral discussions with the North Korean Gov-
 ernment. He indicated that ways are now being
 studied to develop contacts gradually and move
 from nonpolitical to political subjects. This is a
 major shift from the position set forth in Presi-
 dent Pak's Liberation Day speech a year ago when
 he maintained that North-South government-
 to-government contacts would be possible only in
 a UN forum.
 Unprecedented realism was shown in Prime
 Minister Kim Chong-pil's statement on 14 August
 that South Korea would not necessarily oppose
 simultaneous admission to the United Nations of
 both Koreas. He acknowledged that simultaneous
 admission may in fact become "unavoidable" be-
 cause of changes in the international situation.
 The South  Korean shift in attitude is
 prompted in part by the government's recognition
 that there is growing public criticism of President
 Pak for excessive rigidity and for his failure to
 make progress on the emotion-charged unification
 issue-points on which the opposition candidate
 scored heavily in the presidential campaign last
 spring. The movement in Sino-US relations has
 also had an effect.
 There have recently been signs of a greater
 flexibility on Pyongyang's part as well. The shift
 seems to have occurred as Peking sought to reas-
 sure the North Koreans that their interests would
 not be sacrificed by the movement in Sino-US
 relations. Not only were the Chinese apparently
 able to allay Korean uneasiness during an ex-
 change of high-ranking delegations in mid-July,
 but they also appear to have persuaded Kim II-
 song of the efficacy of dialogue. The North
 Korean premier in a major policy speech on 6
 August went out of his way to justify and im-
 plicitly to endorse Chinese contacts with the US.
 He also for the first time raised the possibility of
 talks with the government in the South. This was
 followed by a moderation in propaganda invective
 and by the prompt and favorable response to the
 South Korean Red Cross proposal.
 The North Koreans appear to believe that
 direct contacts will serve to project a more
 "reasonable" image, and they probably hope
 thereby to create an atmosphere that will hasten a
 US military withdrawal from the peninsula. They
 may also believe that bilateral talks at Panmun-
 jom and expanded contacts could upstage the
 continuing multilateral contacts under UN aus-
 pices and eventually bring into question the need
 for UN involvement in Korean affairs.
 It i:s most unlikely, however, that either
 Seoul or Pyongyang anticipates any rapid expan-

 AUSTRALIA:  Prime  Minister  McMahon
 strengthened himself both as government and
 party leader when on 12 August he demanded
 and received the resignation of Australia's con-
 troversial defense minister, John Gorton. Gorton
 also resigned as deputy leader of the Liberal
 Party, thus reducing party tensions and giving the
 Liberals the opportunity to close ranks and pre-
 sent a less divided appearance to the public.
 Gorton, who has been one of McMahon's chief
 political rivals, virtually invited the action taken
 against him when he published an article highly
 critical of cabinet ministers past and present:
 The new defense minister, David Fairbairn,
 who has served in several cabinet posts since
 1962, for the time being will concurrently hold
 the portfolio of Education and Science. Fairbairn,
 like McMahon, is grouped among the conserva-
 tives in the Liberal Party as opposed to the
 younger, more nationalistic and liberal politicians
 such as Gorton.
 EUROPE
 International Economic Developments
 In order to gain time to respond to the new
 US economic policy, Western Europe this week
 closed most of its foreign exchange markets while
 national and intra-European groups met. Tokyo
 maintained the yen-dollar parity by sopping up
 dollars held by Japanese commercial banks and
 exporters. Ottawa, viewing uneasily the rate of
 exchange of its floating currency against the dol-
 lar, is appealing to have Canada exempted from
 the ten-percent import surcharge.
 Paris and Bonn went into an EC meeting on
 19 August with widely divergent views. The meet-
 ing of finance ministers, central bank governors,
 and other senior officials in Brussels was charged
 with seeking a common policy. Just two days
 earlier, the monetary committee had concluded
 that a coordinated float of the five EC currencies
 against the dollar would be the most likely course
 of action, but the French delegate then was un-
 able to speak because his government's official
 position had not yet been determined.
 On Wednesday afternoon, however, a French
 cabinet decision rejected the possibility of a joint
 float. Instead, Paris proposed an alternative action
 involving the establishment of a dual rate system,
 similar to that practiced with some success by the
 Belgians. In effect, this would require a partial
 re-establishment of a fixed parity for the mark,
 which the French have long sought. Bonn has
 already voiced its objection to such a solution
 because of the extensive bureaucratic controls
 they believe will be necessary. The Germans are
 determined to continue the present mark float
 pending the adoption of significant reforms to the
 international  monetary  system,  most notably
 wider exchange bands against the dollar. The EC
 Commission, working for a compromise, tabled a
 proposal encompassing some features of the
 various positions. The outcome of the EC meeting
 will likely serve as the basis for discussion among
 the Group of Ten countries meeting in Washing-
 ton this weekend.

 All the major foreign exchange markets ex-
 cept Tokyo remained officially closed pending
 the outcome of the series of international mone-
 tary meetings this week. In small amounts of
 unofficial activity to finance commercial transac-
 tions in Europe, the dollar generally traded at a
 two- to five-percent discount. Tourists have had
 to pay upwards of ten percent more dollars for
 European currencies. When the gold markets re-
 opened on Tuesday afternoon, after having been
 shut down for a day and a half, there was little
 change in the price of gold with a rather low
 volume of activity. Speculators apparently no
 longer expect an increase in the official price of
 gold.
 In the first four days of this week the Bank
 of Japan absorbed about $2.2 billion in opera-
 tions to support the dollar. The rate of dollar
 purchases on Wednesday fell to about half the
 level of the first two days but rebounded again on
 19 August amid speculation of imminent upward
 revaluation of the yen. Tokyo's dollar reserves
 were approaching $11 billion by close of business
 on 19 August. Despite the government's per-
 sistent public statements that the exchange rate
 will be maintained, some flexibility is indicated
 by Prime Minister Sato's request that the Finance
 Ministry study the possibility of widening the
 margins within which the dollar is permitted to
 fluctuate. It was probably this request, made
 Wednesday, that accounted for the wave of dollar
 selling when the exchange market opened Thurs-
 day. Japanese Government officials probably feel
 that upward revaluation of the yen is inevitable,
 but would like to delay any move until the Eu-
 ropeans take some action.
 A Canadian delegation, now in Washington,
 is basing its case for exemption from the ten-per-
 cent surcharge on the grounds that Canada has
 not maintained unfair exchange rates or engaged
 in discriminatory trade practices. The delegation,
 headed by Finance Minister Benson, notes the
 Canadian dollar has appreciated to over US $0.99
 since it was allowed to float in May 1970, and
 maintains that there are no unfair restrictions on
 imports from the US.
 Canada estimates that about one quarter of
 its exports to the US-some $2.5-$3 billion-will
 be affected by the surcharge, primarily manufac-
 tures. This in turn will add to unemployment in
 Canada, which presently is over six percent, and
 hinder economic recovery. Canada's unique de-
 pendence on the US market-and the unusual
 importance of the trade sector in the economy-
 makes this an issue of extreme importance to
 Ottawa. The Canadians could employ such lever-
 age as a toughening of regulations governing for-
 eign ownership, including control of Canadian
 industry by US firms; restrictions on additional
 gas sales to the US; and recalcitrance in negotia-
 tions for cooperative arrangements with the US in
 the energy area to gain special concessions.
 While many other countries have adopted a
 "wait and see" attitude, India and Indonesia have
 expressed concern about the impact of proposed
 aid cutbacks on their economies, and Central
 American countries meet today to assess the new
 policy. Arab oil producers are fretting over poten-
 tial losses from a floating dollar, a development
 not covered by the recent five-year price con-
 tracts that provided automatic adjustments only
 to compensate for inflation.
 Although Communist China has thus far not
 commented on the new economic policy, the
 USSR is engaging in a propaganda field day,
 charging that the US worker will bear the brunt
 of the domestic program, and that the US is
 attempting to transfer its economic problems to
 its allies.

 The Balkan Gridiron
 Romania and Yugoslavia have become the
 targets of increased Soviet-inspired propaganda
 attacks in recent weeks. The ostensible reason for
 these attacks is the apparent willingness of Bucha-
 rest and Belgrade to use Peking as a counter-
 weight to Moscow's dominance in the Balkans.
 Neither the Romanians nor the Yugoslavs, how-
 ever, show any sign of wilting in the face of heat
 generated by this campaign.
 Moscow's carefully orchestrated campaign
 has emerged since the Crimea meeting on 2
 August that was attended by the party chiefs of
 all CEMA countries except Romania. The Krem-
 lin's aim is to block Chinese attempts to erode
 Soviet influence throughout Eastern Europe, but
 particularly  in  the  Balkans  where  Tito  and
 Ceausescu accept Peking's recent preachments on
 the virtue of regionalism. Furthermore, the So-
 viets appear especially irate over Romania's recent
 attempts to exploit its ties with China in order to
 widen the room Bucharest has for maneuver vis-
 a-vis the USSR.
 Moscow  fired one of its first salvos at
 Romania on 11 August, when it reprinted a Polish
 article that declared "all nods of approval" for
 Peking's policies "could only be considered as
 harmful to the unity of the socialist community."
 The  phrasing,  "nods of approval," was sub-
 sequently repeated in East German and some
 other East European news journals. The Kremlin
 assigned its sharpest pronouncements, however,
 to Hungarian and Slovak newspapers. Thus, the
 Hungarian paper, Magyar Hirlap, reported on 13
 August that Chinese Premier Chou En-lai planned
 to visit Tirana, Belgrade, and Bucharest this fall,
 but the article warned that if the visit should
 result in an "anti-Soviet axis," an "extremely
 dangerous situation" would be created in the
 Balkans. Earlier, on 11 August, the Slovak youth
 newspaper, Smena, directly criticized Romania's
 nonparticipation in the Crimea meeting, thereby
 conveying the almost certainly false impression
 that Bucharest had refused an invitation. The
 Slovaks also growled that "the policy of walking
 on a tightrope will be paid for sooner or later."
 The linkage of Romania with the disparate
 Balkan heretics-Albania and Yugoslavia-is al-
 most unprecedented; it indicates the deep: con-
 cern  that Moscow has about the potTntial
 influence of China in the USSR's own backyard.
 The Hungarians are also vulnerable on this issue,
 since there have been rumors that they too are
 interested in improving relations with Peking by
 means of increased visits.
 As the Soviets have increased the pressure on
 Romania and Yugoslavia, official and popular
 attitudes in  Bucharest and  Belgrade appear
 designed to convey confidence. Thus, Romanian
 and Yugoslav leaders are following normal vaca-
 tion plans, but their activities appear especially
 attuned  this year to mutual consultation.
 Ceausescu particularly seems to be having a
 working vacation during which his efforts are
 directed both at strengthening patriotic fervor,
 especially among Romania's large ethnic Hun-
 garian minority, and reaffirming his regime's
 independent stance.
 At week's end, Moscow's tolerance of in-
 creased Chinese activity in the Balkans, in par-
 ticular, faced yet another test. A 15-member
 Chinese military delegation had arrived in Tirana,
 and it is possible that the delegation may stop
 over in Bucharest as well as Bel rade on its way
 back to Peking.

 official response to the US-Soviet draft conven-

 MIDDLE EAST-AFRICA
 Guinea :  US, The Next Foreign Target?
 Allegations that a US-directed spy network
 has been operating in Guinea were included in the
 most recent of the "confessions" of alleged fifth
 columnists now being broadcast over  Radio
 Conakry. President Toure, however, still may not
 intend to mount a major campaign against the US
 for plotting against him-charges he has already
 leveled at Portugal, West Germany, and France.
 The most detailed allegations to date of US
 involvement in Guinea's current troubles were
 part of the "confession" of ex - cabinet member
 Kassory Bangura. After describing his "recruit-
 ment," Bangura outlined the objectives of the
 "American network" as "economic sabotage" and
 "implanting American influence." He also named
 four other high-ranking officials, who have been
 arrested, as forming part of the "network."
 Nevertheless, Guinean officials-in response
 to a US protest-have given assurances that the
 testimony does not represent the government's
 position and that Conakry desires continued good
 relations with Washington. Moreover, the rela-
 tively mild objectives attributed to the US suggest
 that President Toure may not wish to launch an
 all-out propaganda assault on the US similar to
 the one he has directed against other Western
 countries, notably West Germany, for the past
 eight months. There has also been no attempt as
 yet to specifically link the US with the invasion
 of Conakry last November or to the many alleged
 plots to assassinate Toure. The "confessions" of
 the newly implicated officials, especially that of
 Karim Bangura, a former cabinet officer and
 ambassador to Washington who was closely as-
 sociated with American economic involvement in
 Guinea, should indicate more clearly how far
 Toure will carry his attack on the US.
 It would have been remarkable if the US had
 escaped the current political turmoil unscathed,
 given the strongly anti-Western atmosphere in
 Guinea. Guinea's leaders have always regarded
 Washington's NATO ties to Portugal, the country
 that directed the attack on Conakry last Novem-
 ber, as tantamount to proving US foreknowledge
 of and acquiescence in the attack. Guinea's influ-
 ential leftists have also probably pushed hard for
 an anti-US campaign. The relative cordiality of
 US-Guinean  relations throughout the current

 reluctance to drive out the last significant Western

 by lower exports of karakul (lamb's wool) and
 other animal products.

 India-Pakistan: Major Problems Persist
 The Indo-Soviet friendship treaty has won
 wide acceptance in India, despite misgivings in
 some quarters. On 14 August, the budget session
 of Parliament ended with a comprehensive and
 highly favorable discussion of the treaty in the
 upper house. A few opposition members voiced
 some doubts, but they had little impact on the
 government's steadfast defense of its action.
 The most commonly heard criticism is that
 India has agreed to withhold recognition of the
 independent government of Bangla Desh as the
 price for the treaty. Prime Minister Gandhi denied
 this allegation in Parliament.
 ~ The
 opposition also worried that the 20-year duration
 of the treaty may have limited India's maneuvera-
 bility for too long a period. Others speculated
 that closer ties with the USSR may lead to ex-
 panded Soviet activity in the Indian Ocean and
 possibly foreclose India's desire for an easing of
 relations with Communist China.
 Since the signing on 9 August, the Indian
 Government has made extensive efforts to empha-
 size what the treaty is not. In her Independence
 Day speech on the 15th, Mrs. Gandhi pointed out
 that the treaty did not mark a change in Indian
 policy, implying that Indian nonalignment has
 not been compromised. Defense Minister Ram has
 also insisted that the treaty does not preclude any
 previously held options, including the right to
 develop nuclear weapons.
 As Indian exuberance over the signing dis-
 sipates, however, there is likely to be a growing
 realization that the treaty does not address itself
 to the major problems intrinsic to the crisis. The
 three protagonists-India, the West Pakistani Gov-
 ernment, and the East Bengal secessionists-all
 remain committed to their previous positions.
 Tensions may, in fact, increase in coming weeks.
 As the monsoon ends, the refugee flow
 could accelerate, pockets of famine may develop
 in East Pakistan, and New Delhi's desire for a
 "political" settlement in East Pakistan might
 manifest itself in stepped-up support for the
 Bengali liberation forces.                       25X1

 A guilty verdict and a death sentence in
 the current treason trial of East Pakistani leader
 Mujibur Rahman would  raise emotions even
 higher
 Last week, Pakistan proposed that the UN
 Security Council create a "good offices" com-
 mittee to examine the situation on both sides of
 the border. Reactions from the Indian and Soviet
 delegations were negative.  Reference in the
 Pakistani proposal to both sides of the border
 runs counter to New Delhi's view that the conflict

 Bengal.
 In other aspects, however, it is the Pakistanis
 who are posing problems for the UN. An official
 note sent to Secretary General Thant protested
 his expression of concern on 10 August over
 Mujib's trial. Islamabad has also questioned the
 planned staffing of the UN's relief operations in
 East Bengal. This has caused some delay, but
 apparently some UN personnel should be on the
 scene by 1 September. They continue to be con-

 Syria-Jordan: The War That Wasn't
 Last week's brief crisis began on 12 August
 when Syria publicized border clashes that had
 occurred that day and the day before, broke
 relations with Amman, and closed its airspace to
 Jordanian planes. On 11 Augus
 a small Jordanian
 patrol-two  tracked  vehicles and a jeep-had
 crossed less than a mile into Syrian territory and
 had killed a Syrian at an observation post. The
 next day, the two sides traded artillery and tank
 fire  in the Daraa-Ramtha area; the Jordanians
 apparently knocked out several Syrian tanks, de-
 spite Syria's claims to have inflicted the losses on
 Jordan.
 Damascus' harsh reaction caught Jordanian
 officials by surprise. Border incidents are frequent
 because of the concentration of forces in the area,
 but the Syrian Government had previously' re-
 acted with restraint. President Asad has his own
 problems with the fedayeen, and had been gener-
 ally sympathetic with King Husayn's efforts to
 keep them in line. Syria's retaliatory measures in
 this instance probably stem from two factors:: the
 overaggressiveness of the Jordanian Army and
 Syria's need to refurbish its pro-Palestinian cre-
 dentials, particularly now that its policy of quiet
 cooperation with Jordan has become more widely
 known.
 Jordan reacted by attempting to smooth
 Syria's ruffled feathers. Public Jordanian state-
 ments promised a full investigation of the "de-
 plorable" incidents and urged Syria to reconsider.

 Despite these efforts, another clash took place on
 13 August when an artillery duel brought on an
 attack by four Syrian MIGs, but Jordan refused
 to commit its aircraft and the actual damage was
 slight.
 There have been no further incidents, and
 even the break in relations seems to have been
 more technical than actual; the Syrians have al-
 lowed Jordanian Embassy officials to remain in
 Damascus, although the Saudis are officially rep-
 resenting Jordanian interests. Syria also made it
 clear that the closure of its airspace affects only
 Alia, Jordan's state airline, and not other carriers,
 although the Lebanese airline has canceled flights
 to Amman in response to a bomb threat. Oddly
 enough, on 13 August Syria relaxed its restric-
 tions on vehicles crossing the border, which had
 been partially closed following the fighting with
 the fedayeen in July.
 Egypt moved quickly to help defuse the
 crisis. President Sadat phoned Asad on 13 August,
 presumably to plead for calmness, and  Egypt's
 war minister met with the Syrian leader the same
 day. Cairo's attitude may be decisive in determin-
 ing the outcome of the current meeting in Da-
 mascus of the Syrian, Egyptian, and Libyan heads
 of state. According to press reports, the three
 leaders intend to take up the problems of friction
 between Syria and Jordan as well as Jordan's
 treatment of the fedayeen.
 Meanwhile,  the two-man  Saudi-Egyptian
 mediating team formed to work out an agreement
 between King Husayn and the Palestinian guer-
 rillas appears to be in limbo. The men had arrived
 in Amman on 12 August armed with a six-point
 plan that would seem to go a long way toward
 meeting Jordan's needs. Among other provisions,
 Page 16
 it called for the fedayeen to dissolve all secret
 organizations and to end their propaganda against
 the government. Amman apparently objected to
 the resurrection of the old pan-Arab political and
 military committees to supervise the agreement
 and the need to release commandos under de-
 tention.
 The Jordanians also had some demands of
 their own, including the renewal of all Khartoum
 subsidies and the ending of such economic and
 political pressures as the freezing of relations and
 the closing of borders by Syria and Iraq. In addi-
 tion, the government insisted that the King be
 recognized as the representative of all Jordanian
 citizens on both banks of the river, a provision
 that would rule out the formation of a separate
 Palestinian state, whether on the West Bank or in
 exile. The Jordanians have said that the mediating
 team accepted Jordan's revisions, but it seems
 more likely that the team agreed only to convey
 Jordan's terms to the fedayeen and other inter-
 ested countries.
 If Jordan's stance remains inflexible, any
 settlement is a long way off. The Palestine Liber-
 ation Organization has agreed to the six-point
 plan, but stressed that Amman's additions were
 entirely unacceptable. For their part, the Arab
 mediators probably would be content with a mere
 facade of pan-Arab supervision in Jordan, as well
 as lip service to the Cairo and Amman agree-
 ments, which have been superseded by events.
 The Jordanians, if they choose, could live with
 this and  other unpalatable provisions; for in-
 stance, Amman could probably hold on to most
 of its fedayeen detainees by charging them with
 civil crimes. If the King maintains his unyielding
 position, however, he may dangerously impair the
 sympathy he might otherwise receive from other
 Arab governments.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Latin America: The China Initiative; the Cuban Question
 The announcement that President Nixon will
 visit China has produced a hemispheric spin-off,
 causing several Latin American states to draw a
 parallel between the cases of China and Cuba.
 They point, for example, to Castro's presence as
 one of the realities of political life in the hemi-
 sphere.
 In the last several years, sentiment for the
 reintegration of Cuba into the Latin American
 framework has manifestly grown. Mexico, which
 maintained relations with the Castro government
 despite the OAS sanctions imposed in 1964. was
 joined in November 1970 when Chile re-estab-
 lished relations with Cuba. Peru has announced
 plans to establish  relations with  Peking, and
 Bolivia is seriously considering the move. Both
 nations also have the Cuban question under active
 study and may soon follow the Chilean lead.
 Bolivia has already formally approached Argen-
 tina with a proposal that the two countries
 simultaneously  re-establish  relations  with  the
 Castro regime. Peru concluded a major sale of
 fishmeal to Cuba in June, although the agreement
 contravened an OAS ban. Even Venezuela, which
 brought the charges of intervention that led to
 the 1964 sanctions, presently favors a re-examina-
 tion of the situation. In addition, with a formal
 request for OAS consideration of the Cuban issue
 only a matter of time, several of the Latin Ameri-
 can countries want to ensure that they are in the
 forefront of any move toward a rapprochement.
 The US initiative on China caught Latin America
 by surprise and most countries now are chary of a
 possible future shift of US policy toward Cuba.
 Chile is leading the current effort to normal-
 ize relations with Cuba. A Chilean-Cuban com-
 munique issued on 1 August denounced the OAS
 agreements as obstructing the development of
 normal relations between Cuba and the hemi-
 sphere. President Allende raised the matter of
 Cuba's hemispheric role during his recent visit
 with Argentine President Lanusse and plans to
 press the issue during a planned visit later this
 month to Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. In addi-
 tion, Chilean diplomats in Latin America have
 been seeking support for Cuban participation in
 the special Committee for Latin American Coor-
 dination (CECLA), an all Latin American caucus
 which coordinates hemispheric positions on trade
 and economic matters.
 Readmittance of Cuba to the OAS is. not
 feasible under present conditions. Brazil would
 resolutely oppose such a move as would several of
 the Central American and Caribbean countries.
 Other countries that have benefited from the re-
 distribution of the Cuban sugar quota would also
 be reluctant to sponsor a total rapprochement.
 Castro himself is a major stumbling block to senti-
 ment for complete reintegration. He is convinced
 that the OAS will eventually be replaced by a
 purely Latin American body and would probably
 refuse readmission even if offered.
 In light of these realities, recent discuslions
 within the OAS have focused on the possibility of
 a proposal to allow each nation to conduct bilat-
 eral relations with Cuba without regard to Cuba's
 relations with the hemispheric organization.
 Those favoring some normalization of relations
 with Cuba probably recognize that they lack the
 two-thirds majority needed for a complete re-
 versal of the sanctions policy. Formal consi{iera-
 tion of the issue, however, may well show a
 simple majority in favor of a change in present
 policies, which would provide a justification for
 those governments wishing to  deal bilaterally

 Chile This Week
 Despite continuing dissatisfaction with his
 administration's performance, President Allende has
 put off a cabinet reorganization until the fluid
 25X1    Chilean political situation settles. Of five resigna-
 tions offered, he accepted only that of the minister
 of health and shifted the post from one small party
 of his Popular Unity (UP) coalition to another.
 The President said that the coali-
 tion could claim at most only 25 percent success in
 carrying out its program.
 Allende's increasing inclination to express im-
 patience with his followers' shortcomings indicates
 that he may rely even more heavily in the future on
 his own political judgment. He apparently takes few
 pains to disguise either his approval of the contribu-
 25X1         tion of the Communist Party (PCCh) or his resist-
 ance to certain pressures from radical Socialist Party
 (PS) leaders and from the proliferating political
 groups supporting him.
 One irritant to the President is the Socialists'
 private, public, and persistent demand for rapid and
 far-reaching institutional changes. They particularly
 insist upon the creation of a unicameral "people's
 assembly"-by resort to plebiscite if necessary-a
 25X1    move that Allende considers risky now.!
 Allende agrees with the
 PC     ath t the coalition's defeat by a united opposi-
 tion in a recent by-election, although narrow, was a
 signal that cannot be ignored. Another consideration
 is that Allende's overtures to disgruntled leftist
 Christian Democrats did not lure as many break-
 aways from his chief opponents as he had hoped.
 Allende is again facing a challenge from the
 extremist Movement of the Revolutionary Left
 (MIR), which is stepping up efforts to prove that
 violence is the only effective means to accomplish
 revolution. The political and ideological rivalry be-
 tween the MIR and the PCCh has been intensified
 by continued illegal armed seizures of farms and
 factories and by rumors that the revolutionaries are
 stockpiling arms. The PCCh fears that the M I R's
 dedication to armed struggle could provoke a right-
 ist or military coup attempt against the Allende
 government. The use of the Trade Union Confedera-
 tion building to honor MIR leader Luciano Cruz,
 who died this week, was particularly galling to the
 PCCh, since it resents MIR intrusions in the labor
 field that the Communists consider their own baili-
 wick.
 On the major issue of compensation to US
 copper companies, however, the hard-line stand of
 the PS is gaining ground. Chilean newspapers of all
 political viewpoints have criticized, as unjustified or
 counterproductive to Chilean-US relations, the de-
 ferral of the Export-Import (ExIm) Bank decision
 on a loan to the Chilean national airline to purchase
 US aircraft. Recurrent difficulties at the former US
 mines, whatever their real cause, are being blamed
 by the government on inherited problems deliber-
 ately triggered to reduce Chile's benefit. The long
 programmed winddown in US economic aid and the
 ExIm Bank response are being cranked into this
 campaign to prove that the Allende government is
 not responsible for unpleasant developments in its
 relations with the US.
 Allende pays close attention to international
 relations, giving high priority to demonstrations of
 cordial relations with other Latin American coun-
 tries. Pleased with his recent meeting with Argentine
 President Lanusse, Allende will leave on 23 August
 to visit Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.

 Guatemalan Terrorism Continues
 The assassination of two police officials
 barely two weeks after the kidnaping of a promi-
 nent right-wing politician again demonstrates the
 terrorists' ability to carry out selective acts of
 violence despite serious losses in leadership, per-
 sonnel and safehouses caused by the Arana gov-
 ernment's nine-month-old state of siege. The
 Mexican Government's crackdown on some sup-
 port activities of Guatemalan exiles will probably
 not have any immediate effect on Communist
 terrorist activity either.
 A national police detective inspector and his
 assistant were shot last week near the inspector's
 home in Guatemala City. The assassinations were
 probably carried out by the Rebel Armed Forces
 (FAR), although roadblocks set up in the area
 failed to capture the attackers. Meanwhile, the
 Revolutionary Armed Forces (PGT/FAR) is still
 holding Roberto Alejos, who was kidnaped on 3
 August. They are demanding $500,000 ransom
 and are moving Alejos from one safehouse to
 another to foil government attempts to locate
 him.
 CUBA: The appointment of another top official
 of the Armed Forces Ministry (MINFAR) to an
 unnamed high-level economic post is further evi-
 dence of Fidel Castro's dependence on the mili-
 tary establishment as a source of personnel for
 key management positions. According to a Cuban
 military magazine, MINFAR's first vice minister
 and chief of the General Staff, Major Diodes
 Torralba Gonzalez, was selected for "an impor-
 tant task in the national economy" in late July.
 In addition to Torralba's new assignment, three
 cabinet offices and a provincial party secretariat
 are now directed by former chiefs of the General
 Staff. Torralba's replacement as third-ranking of-
 ficer in MINFAR is Major Senen Casas Regueiro,
 formerly chief of staff of the newly formed Ha-
 vana Army; Casas' brother is also a major and
 The Mexican Government has been inves-
 tigating the activities of a group of Guatemalan
 exiles engaged  in distributing propaganda on
 behalf of the terrorists and in furnishing them
 with materials for making bombs and manuals on
 terrorism. Several members of the group have
 been arrested, and two have already been expelled
 from Mexico.
 The Mexican moves may be a result of the
 meeting between Presidents Arana and Echeverria
 in May. Security and terrorism were the major
 topics discussed, and Echeverria promised to
 crack down on Guatemalan exiles operating in
 Mexico and even told Arana that Mexico would
 "cease to be a bridge between Cuba and the
 insurgents of Latin America." If the Mexicans
 continue their activities against illegal exile op-
 erations, it may in the long run serve to weaken
 terrorist capability within Guatemala, but thus far
 the effect appears to have been negligible.          25X1
 Major Torralba Gonzalez
 holds one of the four remaining vice ministerial
 slots in MINFAR.
