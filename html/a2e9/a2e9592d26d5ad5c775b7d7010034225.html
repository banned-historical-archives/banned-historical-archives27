 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 July 1958
 PART I
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 General Shihab's election
 on 31 July as the new president
 of Lebanon will almost certain-
 ly be followed by opposition de-
 mands that President Chamoun
 retire immediately and that the
 American and UN forces be with-
 drawn.  The opposition clearly
 anticipates that Shihab will
 be merely a caretaker president
 until a new parliament can be
 elected and another president
 chosen--possibly in six months'
 time--who would be even more to
 the  opposition's  liking  than
 Shihab.   If Chamoun remains in
 office until the legal expira-
 tion of his term on 23 Septem-
 ber, and if "loyalist" elements
 seek to frustrate the opposi-
 tion's efforts::to gain control
 of the government quickly, there
 may well be a new.crists.  An-
 other critical issue is likely
 to be the choice of an army
 commander to succeed Shihab.
 While weariness with ter-
 rorism and the exhaustion of
 the politicians may temporarily
 produce a calm internal situa-
 tion in Lebanon, the "manifesto"
 put out by part of the opposi-
 tion this week is indicative of
 longer range Moslem demands for
 a radical revision or abolition
 of the traditional structure of
 Lebanese politics.  The mani-
 festo, attacking the fiction
 that the Christian population
 of the country constitutes a
 majority, demanded that hence-
 forth half the offices be given
 Moslems and that parliamentary
 constituencies be on a geograph-
 ical rather than coAfessional
 basis.  The authors of the mani-
 festo  originally  said  they
 would insist that Shihab sub-
 scribe to the document, but
 subsequently backed down and
 indicated the statement was
 merely to "appease the mob."
 Such statements nevertheless
 tend under present conditions
 to become positions from which
 radical Arab nationalist lead-
 ers dare not retreat.
 Iraq
 The Baghdad regime, which
 has succeeded in obtaining gen-
 eral  diplomatic  recognition,
 has continued to express itself
 publicly in moderate terms and
 to profess friendship for the
 West while pressing for Ameri-
 can recognition. The basic be-
 lief in Western antagonism to-
 ward the new regime found ex-
 pression on 30 July, when a fire
 which broke out in the tank farm
 of a British-owned oil company
 in Baghdad was popularly attrib-
 uted to "imperialist" sabotage.
 The regime, obviously fearing an
 outbreak of anti-Western vio-
 lence, quickly imposed a curfew
 and asked the populace not to
 believe rumors regarding :the
 origin of the fire.
 King Husayn's effort to
 make Jordan some kind of pro-
 Western  "fortress"  has  been
 further undermined by the fa-
 tigue of Prime Minister Rifai.
 Rifai's disability, added to the
 burden': of other problems and to
 evidence of increasing disaf-
 fection, may lead Husayn to
 capitulate  to  UAR  pressure.
 At the present time, the King's
 only secure safeguard is the
 presence of British troops; if

 these leave the country, the
 King would seem to have little
 choice but to go with them or
 bow to Nasir.      For the present,
 the Jordan radio has been in-
 structed to take a "softer" line
 toward Nasir, and there are some
 indications that Nasir, besides
 preparing for Husayn's over-
 throw, may be making an effort
 to persuade him to surrender.
 he believes the Arab peop a are
 behind Nasir,   right or wrong,
 and that, even if Nasir intends
 eventually to  overthrow  the
 Persian Gulf  sheikdoms, one
 cannot resist "Kismet."  At
 present, however, the security
 situation in Kuwait appears
 fairly good following a strong
 stand by the police against
 demonstrations.
 Prime Minister Khalil has
 retained office through the end
 of the parliamentary  session,
 but his pro-Western policy has
 been attacked heavily in both
 houses,  which passed unanimous
 resolutions condemning the Amer-
 ican and British use of troops
 in Lebanon and Jordan.   The pro-
 Egyptian elements which seek
 Khalil's ouster now have turned
 to arousing  the sentiment of
 the "street" against him.
 Kuwait
 The Ruler of Kuwait re-
 t4rned-from Damascus this week
 in a "defeatist" mood following
 talks with Nasir.
 The Israeli military re-
 main alert for possible trouble,
 especially a deterioration in
 the Jordanian situation.   Most
 Israeli activity at present is
 in the diplomatic field, how-
 ever, and is concentrated on
 trying to ensure that Israel's
 interests do  not suffer from
 any high-level international
 discussions on the Middle East.
 While French-Israeli col-
 laboration appears to remain
 close, the Israelis may have
 been rebuffed in an attempt to
 obtain more formal commitments
 from France.   Foreign Minister
 Meir plans a trip to Paris next
 week.

 ing ways and means of avoiding

 Afro-Asian circles as handmaid-
 ens of imperialism.   The, immedi-
 ate problem is their acquies-
 cence in the overflight of Brit-
 ish and American aircraft sup-
 porting the British forces in
 Jordan.   However, they also face
 a longer range danger of being
 completely isolated in an area
 dominated by Nasir, who in turn
 would be backed by the  USSR.
 A shift by Israel  to a more
 neutralist position in an effort
 to diminish Soviet  hostility
 is one of the long-range tac-
 tics reported being discussed.
 Moscow on 30 July named
 G. T. Zaytsev, head of the Near
 East department of the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry, as ambassador
 to Iraq and continues to move
 rapidly to establish close work-
 ing relations with the new Iraqi
 Government.
 Soviet leaders apparently
 believe that the possibility of
 early Western military action
 against Iraq, either alone or
 in cooperation with Middle East
 allies, has diminished.
 Peiping continues to con-
 centrate on Asian states in ef-
 forts to gain popular support
 for the bloc's case against the
 Western intervention.   Peiping,
 like New Delhi,  refers in its
 statements to the "tense situa-,
 tion  in Western Asia" rather
 than the Middle East.   Chinese
 Communist ambassadors in Karachi
 and Djakarta have called on
 Prime Minister Noon and Presi-
 dent Sukarno respectively, and
 the envoy  in New Delhi has con-
 tacted  Nehru.
 Peiping has begun accusing
 the Chinese Nationalists of us-
 ing the Middle East crisis to
 "step up war preparations" and
 carry out  new "harassment."
 Large numbers of military per-
 sonnel  and civilians in the
 coastal provinces have partic-
 ipated in mass demonstrations
 protesting against Chinese Na-
 tionalist activity and pledging
 readiness to "liberate" Taiwan
 "at any time."
 Baghdad Pact Meeting
 The Baghdad Pact Ministe-
 rial Council meeting in London
 on 28-29 July focused primarily
 on the altered situation in the
 Middle East as a re{ult of the
 Iraqi coup and resolved to carry
 out the purposes of the pact
 despite the probable loss of
 Iraq as a member.   Turkey,  Iran,
 Pakistan, and Britain decided
 the new Baghdad regime should
 be recognized this week.
 The question of Iraq's mem-
 bership was left to  Baghdad's
 initiative and it was decided
 to avoid any action that might
 drive Iraq from the organiza-
 tion.   This policy will permit
 the members to maintain flexi-
 bility until Iraq's intentions
 are clear.   It had been feared
 that the new Iraqi regime might
 send delegates, especially to
 the Military Committee sessions,
 in an attempt to learn pact in-
 tentions.   In view of the in-
 tense Arab nationalist opposi-
 tion to the Baghdad Pact,  Iraq's
 continued membership is consid-
 ered unlikely.   Meanwhile the
 headquarters of the pact is
 being transferred to  Ankara,
 and plans are being made to
 counter Egypt's exploitation
 of alleged pact documents.
 The delegations all ex-
 pressed concern over Iraq's new
 orientation, and Iranian Prime
 Minister Egbal especially noted
 the added threat to Iran,   ex-
 pressing fear that his country

 SOVIET TACTICS ON
 Khrushchev's latest notes
 on 28 July calling for an im-
 mediate conference of the Big
 Four heads of government,plus
 Indian Prime Minister Nehru
 and UN Secretary General Ham-
 marskjold, reflect Moscow's
 hope that it can exploit Premier
 de Gaulle's dislike for a sum-
 mit conference in New York to
 force the United States and
 Britain to accept a meeting sub-
 stantially on Soviet terms.
 Comments of De Gaulle's
 foreign policy advisers suggest
 that he actually is not eager
 for summit talks at this time,
 particularly in the UN frame-
 work, which he feels would of-
 fer the Russians too many prop-
 aganda advantages.   They also
 believe Khrushchev's proposed
 inclusion of India would make
 difficult an agreement on the
 agenda and a list of other par-
 ticipafts.        Preoccupied with
 constitutional reform and Al-
 gerian problems, De Gaulle pre-
 fers a later, carefully prepared
 and discreetly conducted con-
 ference.
 Although on 23 July Khru-
 shchev had ostensibly accepted
 en the Baghdad Pact, and the
 prospect: of closer' American
 affiliation appeared to bolster
 the morale of the  delegates.
 The further consolidation  of
 Arab nationalism and the in-
 creased fear of Soviet actions
 will encourage heavier demands
 on the United States for mili-
 tary equipment and guarantees.
 SUMMIT MEETING
 American and British suggestions
 that the meeting be held within
 the context of the UN Security
 Council, the latest Soviet notes
 back away from this position.
 Alleging the United States and
 Britain abandoned their earlier
 proposals for a special session
 of the Security Council at the
 heads-of-government level in
 favor of an "ordinary session"
 of the Security Council, the
 Soviet leader, calling this a
 step backward on the West's
 part,?endorsed Premier de Gaulle's
 suggestion for a "private" meet-
 ing of the major powers in a
 European city.
 Moscow has been careful
 not to close the door to a com-
 promise formula for a summit
 meeting within they UN frame-
 work.
 Khrushchev, in his 28 July
 letters, adopted a pose of un-
 concern for procedural details
 in the face of the overriding
 importance of an immediate meet-
 ing to ease Middle East tension.
 Moscoi continues to insist on
 the parti+6ipatioh of India,
 but, unlike the 23 July notes,
 the latent `Soviet messages-do
 not mention the "natural" par-
 ticipation of the Arab states.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 July 1958
 Moscow's charges of Western ,
 duplicity. and procrastination
 in the face of the "extraordi-
 narily serious situation" in
 the Middle East are designed
 to place the West on the defen-
 sive regarding time, place,
 and composition of the  pro-
 jected conference and, if no
 conference is held, to place
 the blame for the failure on
 the West.
 Khrushchev's letters con-
 tinue Soviet efforts to create
 a sense of  extreme emergency
 with charges that "preparations
 for armed interference in Iraq
 are proceeding at full speed."
 On 30 July, Moscow protested
 against the alleged violation
 of Soviet air space by an Amer-
 ican bomber from Iran, stating
 the USSR attaches "especially
 serious importance" to this in-
 cident because of the tense
 situation in the Middle  East
 created by American and Brit-
 ish armed intervention.
 SECRET
 PART I                    OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 On 30 July, Moscow also is-
 sued a sharply worded TASS
 statement accusing the London
 meeting of the Baghdad Pact mem-
 bers of "evolving new aggres-
 sive measures directed toward
 further aggravation of the mil-
 itary conflict."  On 26 July,
 Moscow in a note to the Bonn
 government protested the use of
 air bases in West Germany for
 the redeployment of American
 forces and called on Bonn to
 take effective measures to halt
 such operations in accord with
 the "vital national interests"
 of West Germany.
 A Soviet aide-memoire to
 Turkey on 24 July  reviewed
 press reports of Turkish troop
 concentrations on the Syrian
 and Iraqi borders  and warned
 Ankara of "grave responsibilr-
 ity fbr,possible ' consequences"
 of an  attack  on  Iraq.

 31 July 1958
 The TASS summary of the
 Soviet economic plan fulfill-
 ment report for mid-1958 shows
 a 10.5-percent increase in in-
 dustrial production over the
 first half of 1957, indicating
 that the economy has not been
 disrupted by the industrial re-
 organization.   Prospects for a
 good harvest in 1958 and the
 large reported increase in in-
 vestment, in light and food in-
 dustries promise continuing
 steady improvement in the stand-
 ard of living for the Soviet
 consumer.
 The report points out that
 all but one sovnarkhoz over-
 fulfilled their plans,   and
 stresses that production suc-
 cesses were a result of the
 reorganization.

 Industry
 The reported increase in
 industrial production of 10.5
 percent over that for the first
 half of 1957 maintains approxi-
 mately the same rate of growth
 as that achieved in the past
 two years.
 The physical output data
 included in the report indicated
 that 1958 production goals for
 the basic branches of industry
 will be fulfilled without dif-
 ficulty.   The 1958 goals, how-
 ever, like those for 1957, rep-
 resent lower rates of growth
 than were attained during the
 early  postwar  years  and
 than  were  originally  planned
 for  the Sixth   Five-Year
 Plan.

 The reported increase in
 industrial labor productivity
 of 6 percent is  the same  as
 last year, suggesting that the
 steady decline in the rate of
 increase of labor productivity
 from the 8 percent achieved in
 1955 may have been halted.
 The volume of capital in-
 vestment increased 11 percent.
 An increase of 28 percent in
 capital investment in ferrous
 metallurgy suggests that plans
 were implemented for expanding
 production capacity in those
 critical industrial materials
 industries which affect  the
 growth of dependent economic
 sectors.   The reported 23-per-
 cent increase in investment in
 the light and food industries
 is striking compared with the
 modest increases accorded these
 industries in past years.
 Agriculture
 The report states that the
 plan for sowing spring crops
 was overfulfilled and that the
 total area under crops for the
 1958 harvest is 3,700,000 acres,
 or about 1 percent greater than
 in 1957.   This would place the
 area under crops slightly above
 that during the record harvest
 year of 1956. Good growing con-
 ditions have prevailed, partic-
 ularly in the main grain areas,
 thus enhancing the prospect for
 a bumper harvest in 1958.
 Livestock flocks and herds,
 at least in the socialized sec-
 tor, were considerably larger
 in mid-1958 than in mid-1957,
 and the state procurement and
 purchase plan for the first
 half of 1958 was reported over-
 fulfilled for meat, wool, and
 eggs.   Milk procurements re-
 portedly increased 9 percent as
 compared to the first half of
 1957, but no mention was made of
 plan fulfillment. Milk produc-
 tion may have increased only
 slightly, if any, over last
 year, when milk output was fa-
 vored by good pasturage from
 an early spring and relatively
 abundant feed supplies from
 the 1956 harvest.
 According to the report,
 '65 percent of the collective
 farms by 1 July had purchased
 machinery, and in  June  the
 collective farms conducted 73
 percent of the total volume of
 tractor work performed on all
 collective farms with their
 own tractors.
 Retail trade, which grew
 more rapidly than planned during
 1957, is increasing at a slower
 pace  in 1958, slightly above
 the 7-percent  rate  planned
 for  the year  in  contrast
 to the  10  percent  planned
 and  14  percent achieved in
 1957.   Housing goals achieved
 indicate that the state plan
 calling for a 19-percent in-
 crease                                                             for     the  full year
 is  being  'fulfilled.

 LAOTIAN CABINET CRISIS
 Prospects for a revitalized
 Laotian Government dominated by
 young, anti-Communist civil and
 military leaders appear to have
 diminished.  Premier-designate
 Souvanna Phouma has offered the
 "Young Turks" 5 seats in a 14-
 man cabinet that is otherwise
 in character with previous in-
 effectual governments.
 The Communist-dominated
 Neo  Lao  Hak  Zat  is  report-
 ed willing to back this or any,
 other cabinet headed by Souvanna.
 It apparently regards Souvanna
 as tractable and fears that op-
 position would ultimately lead
 to the closure of the National
 Assembly and the imposition of
 a strong government by Crown
 Prince Savang or the army.
 The young reformists--or-
 ganized as the Committee for
 the Defense of the National In-
 terests (CDNI)--have  refused
 Souvanna's offer and are threat-
 ening a coup unless giving a ma-
 jority representation in the new
 cabinet.  The committee, recent-
 ly formed and without organized
 popular support, has had to rely,
 on threats of extra constitu-'
 tional action to give weight
 to its demands.

 and the placing of the army on

 Cambodian Premier Sihanouk
 may accept some form of military
 assistance from Communist China
 when he visits Peiping about 10
 August unless Cambodia's border
 disputes with South Vietnam have
 been settled.  Most Cambodian
 officials oppose such a drastic
 step, but Sihanouk feels sure
 of broad mass support in view
 of inflamed public opinion over
 the border incursion by Viet-
 namese forces in Stung Treng
 Province in June.   Sihanouk re-
 cently has spoken of "dwin-
 dling" American military assist-
 ance to Cambodia, in contrast
 to "ample" amounts given the
 "enemy" Vietnamese, and he has
 even warned his people  that
 this aid may soon be terminated
 altogether.
 Sihanouk's act of according
 full diplomatic recognition to
 Peiping  has  already  aroused
 some internal opposition.  Gen-

 aggression.
 NORTH VIETNAM ACKNOWLEDGES CHINESE MODEL FOR DOMESTIC PROGRAMS
 The slogan "We Must Learn
 From Chinese Experience" is be-
 coming commonplace in  North
 Vietnam as Hanoi begins its
 much-heralded "transition to
 socialism."   To popularize the
 programs which form the "new
 phase" of the revolution, the
 regime is telling the peasants
 how much better off they would
 be in cooperatives like their
 Chinese colleagues, and  the
 bourgeoisie is being lectured
 on the merits of Peiping's joint
 state-private ownership system.
 The army has promised to "catch
 up" with the Chinese People's
 Liberation Army as it carries
 out its modernization program.
 Although North Vietnam's new
 programs are being advertised
 as Chinese in origin, the deci-
 sion to adopt them was probably
 made on Hanoi's initiative rath-
 er than Peiping's.
 President Ho Chi Minh urged
 last month's Congress of Labor
 Heroes "to study the experience
 of fraternal countries, par-
 ticularly China."  Practically
 no strata of society has been
 immune to this admonition.

 licity being given to Peiping's
 tactics became particularly
 noticeable when Nhan Dan, the

 experiences."Rectification" has
 received special attention and
 praise, perhaps because Hanoi
 has declared its intention to
 thoroughly house clean the party
 apparatus this year.   "Coopera-
 tivization of agriculture" has
 been given wide play, and Chi-
 nese movies illustrating
 the
 joys of the peasant's
 new
 life
 were shown to members
 of
 the
 National
 Assembly at
 its
 last
 session.
 The
 regime hopes
 the
 prom-
 ise of achievements matching
 China's will offset the tradi-
 tional distaste bordering on
 antipathy which Vietnamese feel
 for their northern neighbors.
 Although the Lao Dong party
 statutes enjoin the North Viet-
 namese Communists to "follow
 the thinking of Mao Tse-tung,"
 the regime in the past has
 adopted programs such as land
 rent reduction, the agricultur-
 al tax, and ag-rarian reform
 without acknowledging their
 Chinese inspiration.   The word-
 ing of the Vietnamese directives
 were virtual translations of
 the Chinese prototypes.
 Whether Vietnamese cadres
 showed less imagination and
 adaptability or whether condi-
 tions in Vietnam  are less like
 those in China than it would
 appear, these programs were not
 nearly so successful in the
 smaller country. Agrarian re-
 form in particular was bungled
 so badly that the regime had
 to backtrack on its goals.  If
 Hanoi should prove inept or in-
 competent in carrying out its
 present programs, which for the
 first time are frankly acknowl-
 edged to be Chinese in origin,
 it might weaken the appeal of
 Peiping's argument that Chinese
 Communist methods are applica-
 ble to other underdeveloped
 countries.
 LEFTISTS EMERGING AS DOMINANT POLITICAL FORCE IN SINGAPORE
 The Communist-influenced
 People's Action party (PAP) ap-
 pears likely to become the dom-
 inant political party in Singa-
 pore when internal self-rule is
 achieved next year.   The PAP
 victory in the recent city-coun-
 cil by-election in the Kallang
 district, widely regarded as
 an important test of strength,
 is further evidence of the con-
 tinuing left-wing trend in Sin--
 gapore. The party is now in a
 strong position for the elec-
 tions to rural district coun-
 cils in September and those to
 the Legislative Assembly next
 spring which will precede the
 institution of self-rule.
 The PAP  success  was
 achieved despite a major effort
 by the moderate parties.   The
 Labor Front and the Liberal' So-
 cialists combined to support a
 single candidate, and Chief
 Minister Lim Yew Hock campaigned
 strongly for him.   The PAP over-
 came the further handicap of
 running a Malay in a predomi-
 nantly Chinese district.   This
 victory, after the PAP had won
 13 of the 14 seats it contested
 in last December's city-council
 elections, seems likely to have
 a bandwagon effect which no mod-
 erate coalition can arrest.
 Chief Minister Lim's embryonic
 United Socialist Front (USF)
 seems to have little chance to
 stem the leftist tide, especial-
 ly since the  USF's  primary
 strength must be drawn from the
 Labor Front and the Liberal So-
 cialists, which have already
 failed in their first coopera-
 tive efforts.

 NEW CHINESE PROGRAM MAY SOLVE BLOC COPPER SHORTAGE
 As part of the present pol-
 icy of bending all efforts to
 achieve "more, better, faster,
 and more economical results,"
 Peiping has launched a program
 to increase China's copper-
 smelting capacity by 150,000
 tons within a year.   It intends
 to get this tenfold increase
 by setting up some 3,000 small
 copper-smelting furnaces, each
 with a capacity of 50 to 100
 tons.   Built by local capital,
 the furnaces will be scattered
 throughout the country, in some
 instances to take advantage of
 minor deposits which might oth-
 erwise not be workable.
 Copper is in short supply
 throughout the Communist world,
 which over the past five years
 has imported an average of 120,-
 000 tons a year from the free
 world.   If the new program is
 successful, China will be pro-
 ducing about 165,000 tons of
 copper a year, some four times
 its annual domestic requirements,
 and may have around 120,000 tons
 a year for sale to its bloc
 partners.
 Peiping will doubtless run
 into administrative problems
 in getting this program under
 way.  The supply of the neces-
 sary raw materials does not ap-
 pear to present any special dif-
 ficulties, and China has had
 centuries of experience in op-
 erating small smelters, which
 require a minimum of technologi-
 cal know-how for construction
 and operation.   Capital outlay
 is minimal; Peiping has cited
 one such smelter built out of
 local materials at a total cost
 of only $60.
 On the other hand, wide
 employment of smelters of this
 type is wasteful and inefficient.
 The quality of ore used must in
 general be a good deal higher
 than is the case with more mod-
 ern smelters.   Metal losses
 will run high. The crude cop-
 per produced will contain a'high
 percentage of impurities and re-
 quire further refining prior to
 use.
 Peiping's motive in build-
 ing such plants doubtless is to
 get the largest possible in-
 crease in output in the least
 time and at the least cost.  It
 probably looks on the program
 as a useful stopgap until the
 larger, more modern facilities
 now under construction at places
 such  as Paiyinchang in Kansu
 Province and Tungchuan in Yun-
 nan Province go into production
 in a few years, and replace
 the less efficient  small plants.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 July 1958
 Widespread violence be-
 tween the Greek and Turkish com-
 munities on Cyprus continues
 despite a major security offen-
 sive, during which about 1,600
 Greek- and 50 Turkish-Cypriots
 were placed in detention camps
 and the Turkish Resistance Or-
 ganization  (TMT)  'proscribed.
 Over 100 people have been killed
 and nearly 200 injured in the
 intercommunal fighting since
 early June--over  half in the
 past three weeks.
 Although Greek- and Turk-
 ish-Cypriot leaders, including
 Archbishop Makarios, have joined
 Governor Foot in public appeals
 for an end to the violence, ex-
 tremists refuse  to  heed the
 call.   Following the mass ar-
 rests,                   EOKA leader Grivas pro-
 claimed in a new leaflet that
 he preferred "total destruc-
 tion" in Cyprus to continued
 British rule. Foot, while aware
 that EOKA would probably react
 to the security drive by all-
 out attacks on the British po-
 lice forces, had hoped that the
 roundup  might cause EOKA  to
 cease its assaults on the Turks
 and thus  prevent a continued
 drift toward civil war.
 In Greece, the arrests have
 been denounced as a further in-
 dication that Britain favors
 the Turkish Cypriots.   Athens
 has protested the recent securi-
 ty measures to London and Wash-
 ington, as well as to the secre-
 taries general of the UN and
 NATO.   Within the next two weeks
 Greece will probably again ask
 the UN General Assembly to place
 the Cyprus issue on the agenda
 of its forthcoming session.
 In Turkey, the press and
 radio, inspired by pleas for
 help from Turkish-Cypriot lead-
 er Fazil Kuchuk, are reiterating
 the demand that Turkish troops
 be sent to Cyprus to protect the
 Turkish Cypriots, a move which
 London has been firmly reject-
 ing.   Ankara has recently in-
 structed Kuchuk to cooperate
 with the British, but Turkish
 Foreign Minister Zorlu  has
 stated that future Turkish ac-
 tion regarding Cyprus will be
 determined by the success or
 failure of the British drive
 against EOKA.
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister
 Macmillan discussed Cyprus with
 Turkish Premier Menderes follow-
 ing the Baghdad Pact Council
 meetings in London, and is ex-
 pected to confer with Greek Pre-
 mier Karamanlis at some early
 future date.  In Paris, NATO Sec-
 retary General Spaak is continu-

 form of compromise agreement re-
 garding the new British plan;

 of Greece-Britain  and Turkey.

 Bourguiba, claiming that

 May when French forces in south-

 requested arms from the United
 States and Britain.  French of-

 have  offered  him  arms  from
 stocks issued to the French
 forces now leaving the country,
 but Bourguiba fears acceptance
 would incite charges by the FLN
 that he had made some kind of
 military peace with  France
 against the Algerians.
 Bourguiba, still wary of
 any French attempts to maintain
 a monopoly over Tunisia's arms
 sources, prefers alternate West-

 but they have been lethargic and
 have left the field open to new
 groupings.
 Daniel Mayer's "Union of
 Democratic Forces," most left-
 ist of the new groupings, in-
 cludes several left-wing Social-
 ist party (SFIO) leaders in ad-
 dition to ex-Premier Mendes-
 France, the Orthodox Radical
 leader, and Francois Mitterrand,
 left-wing Democratic Resistance
 Union (UDSR) leader.  A number
 of long-established splinter
 Bidault as too rightist-oriented,
 and such stalwarts as ex-Premier
 Robert Schumann are organizing
 a National Committee of Liaison
 for Christian Democracy.
 A potential rightist throat
 to De Gaulle's program is the
 recent appearance of Informa-
 tion Minister Jacques Soustelle's
 Union for the Renovation of
 France, stemming from his Union
 for the Salvation and Renova-
 tion of Algeria (USRAF), which
 played a key role in preparing
 movements in the
 non-Communist
 for the 13 May coup there.

 Communists, its opposition to
 the revised constitution will
 play into Communist hands.
 It could permanently breach
 the already badly divided SFIO
 and may attract left wingers of
 other parties as uneasiness over
 rightist influence on De Gaulle
 mounts.   It faces minor competi-
 tion on the non-Communist left
 in a new grouping of "leftist
 Gaullists," mainly a group of
 Radicals who followed Mendes-
 France during De Gaulle's long
 political eclipse and who now
 hope to "save" De Gaulle from
 extremists on both sides.
 In the center, former Pre-
 mier George Bidault proposes
 to build his new Christian Demo-
 cratic Movement into a broad
 center and right-center organi-
 zation, combining elements of
 his own Popular Republican par-
 ty (MRP), the Social Republicans
 (GRS), various Radical groups,
 and the Independents.   Most MRP
 members, however, now regard
 It seems probable, however,
 that he felt it unwise to form
 a new political party while
 still a member of the govern-
 ment, particularly in view of
 De Gaulle's dislike for a multi-
 plicity of parties, and that
 he also sees possibilities in
 tapping the USRAF apparatus of
 Committees of Public Safety,
 veterans' organizations, and
 other "nonpolitical" rightist
 groups as vehicles both for
 exercising more influence on
 De Gaulle's policy and for en-
 hancing his own personal power
 position later.
 Only a few of the new
 groupings are likely to have
 much  impact  on  the  politi-

 tion weakens the existing par-
 ties, probably facilitates the
 growth of extremism, and, in
 any case, will complicate the
 period of transition to new
 political institutions.             25X1

 avoided any dangerous politi-
 cal commitments, and Vienna's
 pro-Western neutrality is still
 intact.
 Of the various minor con-
 cessions won by Raab, the most
 important--expected ultimately
 to be worth about $70,000,000
 --is the USSR's agreement to
 supply free of charge quanti-
 ties of oil equivalent to 50
 percent of Austria's annual
 oil reparations deliveries.
 This arrangement, rather than
 a straight reduction, was ap-
 parently worked out to pre-
 serve established trade routes
 for Austrian oil, much of
 which--under Soviet account--
 is taken by the European satel-
 lites.
 As a graceful gesture to
 the Soviet Union, the Austrians
 on their own initiative declared
 an intent to adhere to the
 Eastern Danube Convention.
 This Soviet-dictated instrument,
 which regulates Danube traffic
 east of the Austrian border,
 has never been recognized by
 the West, and Vienna has here-
 tofore limited its recognition
 to the sending of observers to
 technical meetings.   In response
 to an Austrian suggestion, more-
 over, Bonn is already consider-
 ing following Vienna's lead.
 Khrushchev claimed on Raab's
 departure that a "unanimity of
 views on a wide range of inter-
 national subjects" had been
 reached, but from the content
 of the final communique and from
 comments by both Soviet and
 Austrian officials, it is clear
 he did not press the Austrians
 for pro-Soviet policy statements
 on principal East-West issues.
 While it can be expected that
 on appropriate occasions Moscow
 will claim Austrian "agreement"
 with Soviet international policy,
 Khrushchev's primary efforts
 were directed rather toward the
 more realistic objectives of en-
 couraging Austria's neutrality
 and demonstrating to the smaller
 neutral nations continuing Soviet
 interest in their welfare.
 Nearly all Austrians have
 welcomed alleviation of a burden
 they considered unjust, but it
 is doubtful that their basic
 suspicion of the USSR will be
 greatly affected.   Raab's role
 in the agreement has made him
 a national hero in some quarters,
 but his very friendly attitude
 toward the USSR has also provoked
 alarm and consternation even
 among those sympathetic toward

 1958 fix the rate of: growth of
 the GNP at 2-3 percent in con-
 trast to a rise in 1957 of 5.6
 percent.
 The only marked improve-
 ment has been in foreign-ex-
 change reserves, which reached
 a postwar high of $1.215 billion
 by March 1958,  largely as a re-
 sult of a 15-percent
 drop in imports and
 a 3-percent rise in
 exports, along with
 continuing US mili-
 tary expenditures and
 loans.   Slackening
 world trade, however,
 has since retarded
 the expansion of
 Italian exports, while
 imports for industri-
 alization have con-
 tinued at a high
 level, leading to a
 foreign payments def-
 icit.
 The sharp reduc-
 tion envisaged in
 the 1958-59 budgetary
 deficit and the pos-
 sibility that foreign
 demand will continue
 to decline could re-
 duce economic activi-
 ty.   With this in
 mind, the government has lowered
 the discount rate from 4 to 3.5
 percent and boosted state ex-
 penditures, even though this
 will make more difficult the
 reduction in the budget deficit.
 Even so, a decline in economic
 activity during the second
 half of 1958 is now predicted
 by many prominent Italian in-
 dustrial, commercial, and bank-
 ing leaders.
 If deteriorating economic
 conditions in other European
 countries force large numbers
 of Italian immigrants to go
 home, the unemployment problem
 in Italy could be seriously
 aggravated.  An increase in
 the 1,700,000 unemployed would
 increase the Communists' popu-
 lar appeal and add to the
 government's instability.   The
 Democratic Socialists are al-
 ready divided on continued
 participation in the Fanfani
 coalition.  At the same time,
 the right would reiterate
 recent charges  that  the
 government's public  spending   25X1
 program  will involve economic
 and financial ruin.
 Iceland's unilateral ex-
 tension of its fish conserva-
 tion limits to 12 nautical miles
 becomes effective on 1 Septem-
 ber, and it is unlikely that
 any compromise will be reached
 before that date with other
 nations having fishing in-
 terests in Icelandic waters.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY S:URY
 31 July 1958
 In late June the Icelandic
 representative to the North
 Atlantic Council indicated
 that his government was will-
 ing to negotiate special rights
 for a limited number of years
 in the outer zone of the new
 belt.   Late in July, however,
 he still had not made any spe-
 cific or practical suggestion.,,
 and the British Foreign Office
 is extremely pessimistic about
 the prospects of negotiations
 on any basis.   In mid-July,
 the West German Government ex-
 pressed the hope that Iceland
 would enter into negotiations
 to achieve agreement before
 1 September.
 Representatives of the
 fishing industries of the
 United States, Britain, France,
 Spain, Belgium, Holland, and
 West Germany met in the The
 Hague on 20 July and passed a
 resolution condemning Iceland's
 action and stating     would be
 disregarded.   Press r~,,ports
 hint that the group may recom-
 mend joint economic action a-
 gainst Iceland if the situation
 does not improve.
 Iceland's leftist coalition
 government is under strong local
 Communist pressure to remain
 adamant.   The Commu-
 nists have intimated
 that they will with-
 draw from the govern-
 ment if the Social
 Democratic foreign
 minister attempts
 negotiations permit-
 ting foreign trawlers
 within the 12-mile
 limit.   The Progres-
 sives and the Social
 Democrats will go to
 any length to avoid
 an election, which
 they feel would only
 benefit the Communists
 and the Conservatives.
 The Progressive press
 opposes any compro-
 mise and hints that
 Iceland will ask the
 United States for as-
 sistance if Britain
 gives its trawlers naval pro-
 tection.
 The USSR has reportedly
 suggested a Soviet naval visit
 to Iceland around 1 September
 and is also urging Iceland to
 request any assistance required
 to implement the 12-mile limit.
 If no compromise is reached,
 the Communists will have created
 dissension between Iceland and
 its NATO allies; if the NATO
 countries recognize the new
 limit, the Communists will claim
 the victory.                             25X1

 31 July 1958
 ARGENTINE PETROLEUM POLICY ANNOUNCED
 President Frondizi's out-
 line of his petroleum policy on
 24 July emphasizes private par-
 ticipation in Argentine oil de-
 velopment under contract with
 the State Oil Fields (YPF).  He
 said that foreign private firms
 had agreed in general terms to
 invest approximately one billion
 dollars on this basis and men-
 tioned a last-minute Soviet of-
 fer to supply $100,000,000 worth
 of oil equipment payable in Ar-
 gentine products over a long
 period.
 Frondizi declared the main
 obstacle to Argentina's economic
 progress was its dependence on
 fuel and steel imports at a cost
 which forced Argentina to remain
 a producer of primary materials.
 He plans to triple oil produc-
 tion by 1962.  Argentina pro-
 duced only 34,000,000 barrels
 in 1957--about 37 percent of
 domestic needs.
 Frondizi specifically men-
 tioned eight final or prelim-
 inary contracts with private
 firms, six of which are Ameri-
 can, one Argentine, and one Bel-
 gian.  He made no detailed com-
 ment on the offer delivered by
 the Soviet ambassador shortly
 before his broadcast.  He did
 refer, however, to the favorable
 terms of Argentina's purchase
 last June of 7,266,000 metric
 tons of Soviet crude.
 The principal agreement,
 "signed in general terms," is
 with a "US group" which includes
 one German firm.  This calls for
 an estimated investment of
 $700,000,000 to: 1) drill about
 4,000 wells; 2) establish a
 factory to produce oil-field
 equipment; 3) furnish at least
 18,000,000 barrels of crude oil
 and derivatives on two to three
 years' credit; 4) construct a
 new gas line; 5) loan $30,000,-
 000 to the 'Central Bank for five
 years; and 6) supply $50,000,-
 000 worth of machinery and
 equipment on credit.
 Frondizi plans to submit to
 Congress a proposed petroleum
 law affirming national control
 over oil resources and assuring
 the provinces of participation
 in the profits.  No new conces-
 sions will be granted, but the
 situation existing prior to 1
 May 1958 will be respected.
 Frondizi's party controls Con-
 gress, but the bill will prob-
 ably be attacked by the minority
 party as well as by some of his
 own followers.  At the same time,
 his new policy may serve to
 offset criticism that he has
 concentrated on pacifying the
 Peronistas and has neglected
 Argentina's pressing economic
 problems.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 MOSCOW'S POLITICAL PROBLEMS WITH EASTERN EUROPE
 Campaign Against Revisionism
 Moscow's present campaign
 to achieve bloc unity, of which
 the execution of Nagy and the
 ideological break with Yugo-
 slavia are but parts, began in
 mid-1956. At that time the
 Soviet Union was attempting to
 restore its prestige and au-
 thority over the Communist move-
 ment,                    after both were shaken
 as a result of the de-Stalin-
 ization campaign and Moscow's
 encouragement in 1955 and 1956
 of the "separate roads" theme
 and more local initiative by
 satellite leaders.
 Moscow realized the dangers
 of this course when the riots
 occurred at Poznan in June 1956,
 but its indecisive attempts
 prior to the Hungarian revolu-
 tion to close its Pandora's box
 were ineffectual.   Even after
 Gomulka returned to power in
 October, Moscow was reluctant
 entirely to abandon its "liberal"
 course, and its admission of
 past mistakes in handling the
 satellites in its declaration of
 30 October was made even more
 emphatic by the Chinese state-
 ments at the time criticizing
 "great-power chauvinism."
 The uprising in Hungary
 was the last straw for the Com-
 munist leaders, however, and,
 from November on, the preoc-
 cupation was not with the evils
 caused by past arbitrary prac-
 tices toward the satellites
 but with the dangers posed by
 separatist trends and the prac-
 tice of ignoring the experience
 of the Soviet Union in building
 "socialism."  At the same time,
 bloc leaders began to speak
 more and more of the "basic
 principles"  of  socialist
 Revisionism can be defined as the attempt to revise fundamental Marxist-Leninist principles as
 accepted by Moscow.  The main fundamental principles were listed in the 12-nation Moscow declara-
 tion of November 1957 and included:
 a) establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat by
 means of a proletarian revolution in one form or an-
 other and leadership by a Marxist-Leninist party;
 c) abolition of capitalist ownership and establishment of
 public ownership of the basic means of production;
 d) the gradual socialist reconstruction of agriculture;
 e) planned development of the national economy aimed
 at building socialism and communism;
 f) proletarian internationalism (i.e., Soviet leadership);
 g) the defense of achievements of socialism against at-
 tacks by, external and internal enemies.
 One of these principles, (d), was vaguely worded in the November declaration in deference to Go-
 mulka, to whom gradualism in agriculture is a cardinal element of his "Polish road to Socialism:'
 Many of the other bloc leaders would have preferred to omit the term "gradual:' Similarly, although
 Gomulka subscribed to "proletarian internationalism" in the declaration, his subsequent interpretation
 of this principle differed considerably from that of, say, the Chinese leaders.  In any case revisionism
 could easily be expanded by Moscow, if it suited the needs of the moment, to cover opposition in various
 forms--e.g., the "right-nationalist deviation" of Gomulka.

 construction derived from So-
 viet experience--an approach
 which had been de-emphasized
 after Stalin's death.
 Clearly, both Moscow and
 Peiping were apprehensive after
 Hungary over the trend toward
 "national Communism."  Only two
 countries at the time posed
 any immediate danger--Poland
 and Yugoslavia--the latter be-
 ing outside the bloc and thus
 less accessible to pressure to
 conform.   Therefore, the first
 goal had to be to ensure that
 the "national Communism" of
 Poland would be kept within
 bounds--that it would be pre-
 vented from heading toward
 another Hungary.   Both Chinese
 and Soviet leaders made state-
 ments in November and December
 1956 about the "basic princi
 ples," and in January 1957
 Chou En-lai went to Warsaw and,
 acting on behalf of Moscow, ap-
 parently made some progress
 selling these principles to Go-
 mulka.
 Shortly afterward, Gomulka
 made a gesture toward accepting
 the Soviet lead in intrabloc af-
 fairs--by altering his position
 on the Hungarian rebellion and
 subscribing at the central com-
 mittee plenum in May to the
 "basic principles."  Gomulka
 still hedged on the question
 of recognizing unqualified So-
 viet leadership of the bloc
 parties and insisted that the
 principles which might affect
 the most important aspects, e.g.,
 agriculture, of his "Polish road
 to socialism" be vaguely worded.
 Nevertheless, his agreement pro-
 vided some assurance to Moscow
 and Peiping that his "road" would
 not go in the same direction as
 Nagy's and thus the immediate
 danger posed by Poland was re,-
 moved.
 Yugoslav Revisionist Threat
 Yugoslavia remained a men-
 ace, however, since it continued
 to exert great influence in all
 the Communist countries, the
 more so since it was outside
 the bloc.     The polemics between
 Moscow and Belgrade between No-
 vember 1956 and April 1957 clear-
 ly reflected Moscow's considered
 view that Yugoslav influence,

 rapport was restored.  They
 agreed that although they had
 opposing viewpoints, there was
 no point in stressing them in
 public.
 Turning Point--November 1957
 The November meeting of
 bloc leaders in Moscow had
 great significance for the sub-
 sequent dispute with Belgrade.
 From Khrushchev's speeches to
 Moscow had reason to feel in the
 fall of 1957 that Tito might re-
 join the bloc by signing this
 declaration, it would certainly
 explain why so much importance
 was attached to the declaration,
 as well as to Tito's failure to
 sign it.
 Tito's attitude toward
 Khrushchev apparently altered
 suddenly in late October, how-
 ever, following Marshal Zhukov's
 visit and subsequent removal, and
 Belgrade announced on 29 Octo-
 ber that Tito would not attend
 the Moscow meeting in November.
 These developments probably
 led to the decision in Moscow
 that since Tito could not be en-
 ticed into the bloc, other tac-
 tics were necessary to counter-
 act the serious influence of
 The Communist party of the Soviet Union will continue to dress down the attacks of opportunists and revision-
 ists quite decisively.  We shall do this not by interfering in the internal affairs of this or that party, but through
 comradely criticism and influence on the part of the revolutionary world movement and Marxist-Leninist parties
 on mistaken positions which may appear in one party or another.
 We do not want the interference of parties in the internal affairs of other parties, or even the interference
 of states in the home affairs of other states, but comradely criticism, which also brings comradely aid, of those
 who make mistakes, but are capable of appreciating them, of understanding how they arose and of correcting them.
 As for the leadership of this or that party and the leadership of this or that country, they are a matter for the party
 and the government of the people in question to decide for themselves.
 --from speech at East German party congress, 11 July 1958
 the Bulgarian and East German
 party congresses ion 3 .June ;and
 11 July 1958., it appears that
 Moscow had hoped to secure Tito's
 signature to the bloc declara-
 tion.   Khrushchev argued in Ber-
 lin that it was not Moscow but
 the "other fraternal parties"
 which made alterations in the
 draft declaration--which Tito
 had been shown before November
 --to include mention of "Soviet
 leadership of the socialist
 camp and of the socialist par-
 ties."
 Tito was apparently will-
 ing at the time of the Bucharest
 meeting in August to associate
 himself formally with the "so-
 cialist camp" provided the com-
 mitment would not involve sub-
 servience to Moscow.  If indeed
 Yugoslav ideas within the Com-
 munist movement.  As Khrushchev
 said on 11 July in East Berlin,
 he drew the "necessary conclu-
 sions."
 "Antiitbvisionist't Campaign
 Accordingly, the November
 meeting was followed by a full-
 scale ideological campaign
 against "revisionism" directed
 against such well-known Western
 European "revisionists" as
 Kolakowski (Polish), Lukacs
 (Hungarian), Djilas (Yugoslav),
 and Harich (East German).   The
 similarity between their ideas
 and those of the Yugoslav party
 leaders was obvious, but Yugo-
 slavia was not explicitly linked
 during this period to the re-
 visionist heresy.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 July 1958
 Tito had meanwhile drawn
 his own conclusions, as seen in
 the draft Yugoslav party pro-
 gram published on 13 March,
 which codified his heresies.
 His defiance,   at a time when
 Moscow and Peiping both attached
 great importance to re-estab-
 lishing discipline under Soviet
 authority,  had to be answered
 and vigorously condemned. With
 the mid-April Kommunist article
 on the Yugoslav program, an-
 swered by defiant replies at
 the Yugoslav party congress,
 the polemical exchange. between
 the bloc and Belgrade was re-
 newed.   Moscow's and Peiping's
 efforts, however, could never
 be successful if something were
 not done to negate the influence
 of the major revisionists, and
 thus Moscow could not ignore
 the man who of all others trans-
 lated  revisionism  into  ac"
 tion--who  actually restored
 a  multiparty system  and
 called  for  the  severance
 of  his  country from   the
 Communist  camp--Imre Nagy,
 Necessity for Nagy's Execution
 Nagy had long ago been de-
 clared a traitor and a detailed
 case built up against him.  A
 severe sentence at some time
 was to be expected, but there
 was no pressing internal need
 to execute him.   Externally,
 the move had many serious dis-
 advantages.   Moscow doubtless
 appreciated that Nagy would be-
 come a martyr in the West and
 that his execution would shock
 world opinion.   Many relatively
 minor counterrevolutionaries
 had already been executed in
 Hungary, but Nagy's secret trial
 and execution were viewed by
 many Communists in Eastern
 Europe to signify a return to
 methods which had been dis-
 credited and disavowed only a
 year or two before.
 Thus it would appear that
 the Nagy execution was decided
 on by Moscow as a symbolic step
 in the antirevisionist campaign,
 the necessity for which far out-
 weighed the damage it
 would do abroad. The
 necessity arose from
 the fact that the
 paramount task of neu-
 tralizing Yugoslav
 ideological influence
 had not been accom-
 plished by the polem-
 ics waged against Bel-
 grade up to that point.
 The Problem of Gomulka
 SECRET
 Gomulka presents
 a problem to Moscow,
 not so much because
 of his internal pro-
 gram, but because of
 his refusal to accept
 unconditional Soviet
 leadership. and to as-
 sociate himself un-
 reservedly with the
 line set by Moscow.
 This has obstructed
 bloc unity and exerts
 a dangerous influence
 on the other satel-
 lites.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 July 19 58
 Unlike Tito,  however,  Go-
 mulka has not been accused of
 harboring revisionist views
 himself.   Since October 1956,
 moreover, the Polish leader has
 demonstrated that by conviction
 he is strongly opposed to re-
 visionism and has dealt firmly
 with Polish revisionists.   He
 has committed Poland to the
 basic principles of socialist
 development based on Soviet ex-
 perience,  which provides a safe-
 guard for Moscow against re-
 visionist influence in his in-
 ternal program.   Gomulka still
 refuses,  however,  to submit to
 Soviet control over his inter-
 nal program,                  and, by doing this,
 runs the risk of one day being
 tagged a revisionist who re-
 fused to subscribe fully to
 Moscow's interpretation of the
 letter and spirit of "proletar-
 ian internationalism;"  i.e.,
 Soviet leadership.
 In mid-June, however, Mos-
 cow's main concern was with Go-
 mulka's obstruction of the bloc
 line toward Yugoslavia,  and the
 Nagy execution was doubtless a
 warning to him, and possibly to
 Kadar as well,  not to cause dif-
 ficulty for Moscow in this most
 important sphere.
 Moscow is caught up in the
 same dilemma it faced when it
 first attempted to change its
 methods of dealing with the
 satellites--loosening the reins
 has the effect of undermining
 basic discipline with disastrous
 possibilities, while, on the
 other hand, direct exploitative
 methods, as practiced under
 Stalin, only antagonize the
 satellite peoples and  build
 up anti-Soviet feeling.
 The Soviet leaders,  by
 altering their relationships
 with these countries after the
 death of Stalin, themselves
 contributed in large measure
 to the very undermining of bloc
 unity and discipline, not to
 mention the authority and pres-
 tige of the USSR, which they
 now desire so strongly to re-
 store.   If they use the neces-
 sary measures to restore dis-
 cipline, then they will be re-
 turning to the practices which
 they discredited in 1955 and
 1956, and, moreover, will run
 the risk of building up the
 same resentments and animosities
 which contributed so much to the
 upheavals of 1956.
 One of the most curious
 aspects of recent developments
 has been the frequent changes
 in the Soviet position, first
 of all during the anti-Tito cam-
 paign and later concerning the
 execution of Nagy.   Thus, the
 original relatively mild lan-
 guage  of the Kommunist article
 was soon followed  y increas-
 ingly insulting attacks on the
 Yugoslavs.   Later, the emphasis
 changed to maintaining correct
 "state" relations, as if the
 previous articles had gone too
 far.
 There were also variations
 between the tone of the attacks
 on Yugoslavia by some of the
 bloc countries and the less un-
 relenting line of Moscow.   In
 the case of Nagy, there was the
 shift in position between the
 indictment itself, which stressed
 the connection between "revision-
 ist ideas" and Nagy's fate, and
 later reassurances from Moscow
 (as well as from Kadar) that the
 execution resulted solely from
 his treason.   The threatening
 attitude of Peiping toward the
 Yugoslav leaders also contrasted
 with Moscow's more moderate ap-
 proach.
 These contrasts and incon-
 sistencies suggest indecision,
 perhaps reflecting disagreement
 in Moscow on these issues,  or
 at the very least indicate that
 bloc Communist leaders have not
 received clear directives on
 the proper line to follow.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 31 July 1958
 of Moscow's present approach to
 this problem.     In his speech
 in mid-July at the Czech re-
 ception in Moscow, Khrushchev
 referred to a "brotherly com-
 monwealth of states with equal
 rights," the establishment of
 which,  he said, was the major
 task at the moment.   This same
 commonwealth was mentioned ear-
 lier in the 12-nation Moscow
 declaration of November
 1957,
 although at the time it
 was
 not clear how the various par-
 ticipants would deal with one
 another.
 in his 11 July speech in
 Berlin, as in an earlier speech
 in Bulgaria,   Khrushchev  ap-
 parently attempted to reassure
 Gomulka that his "equality" and
 "national sovereignty" need not
 be affected if he were  to as-
 sociate himself fully and un-
 reservedly with such a common-
 wealth under Moscow's leader-
 ship.   At the same time,  how-
 ever, Khrushchev made it clear
 that all satellite leaders, in-
 cluding Gomulka, are expected
 to consider not just their own
 country but the interests of
 the socialist camp as a whole.
 To do otherwise  would "harm
 the lives and interests of their
 own people, and the interests
 of socialism."
 The Cominform, it might
 be recalled, was organized in
 1947 ostensibly as a "voluntary"
 association of countries partic-
 ipating   on an equal basis.
 The present approach is not dis-
 similar, although the conditions
 have drastically changed. Khru-
 shchev referred in his 11 July
 Berlin speech to the socialist
 camp as a "voluntary alliance
 of equal sovereign states in
 which no one aspires to special
 rights or seeks privileges and
 advantages."
 Moscow is apparently at-
 tempting to attain its goal of
 restoring control and discip-
 line through the medium of this
 ostensibly free and voluntary
 "commonwealth."  In this way
 the satellite leaders receive
 assurances that their positions
 and internal programs will not
 be  interfered with by Moscow
 as long as they subscribe in
 essentials to Moscow's leader-
 ship.   This cautious approach
 is influenced by the necessity
 of not antagonizing Gomulka, the
 chief problem child,  into tak-
 ing a hostile stand in the be-
 lief that his internal independ-
 ence is threatened.
 Moscow probably hopes that
 by persuasion and indirect pres-
 sures Gomulka can be slowly
 pushed to a point where his in-
 dependence and control over in-
 ternal policy will be different
 only in degree from that of the
 other satellites.   Moscow,  more-
 over, has apparently already
 achieved considerable success
 in talking Gomulka into going
 along with this scheme.  As early
 as last November, on his return
 from the 40th anniversary cele-
 brations in Moscow,Gomulka ap-
 peared pleased with the pros-
 pects for this new commonwealth.
 In discussing the proposed
 "practical ties" between the
 Communist parties--bilateral and
 multilateral meetings--he still
 cautioned that:
 ...the question of the internal
 policy of each party cannot
 be determined  by  inter-
 party conferences.   We  must
 hold to the principle that
 each party should decide the
 best line of policy for it-
 self and its country.
 Since that time,  however,
 the   Poles  have committed them-
 selves to participate in the
 new international Communist
 journal,   a sign that Gomulka's
 initial objections  to  this
 publication have been overcome.
 Indeed, Gomulka  would  seem
 to   present no obstacle  at the
 moment to Moscow's plan for in-
 trabloc relations.   Khrushchev,
 in his Moscow speech on 12 July,
 even gave  Gomulka an "out" on
 the question of Western aid, al-
 though he warned that its accept-
 ance was permissible only if the
 country concerned "marches  in
 step  with  all  socialist coun-
 tries."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUU&RY
 31 July 1958
 POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN IRAN
 The Shah,:who has always
 been unusually suspicious of
 subordinates, seems to be con-
 cerned that ambitious men in
 his entourage will nor associate
 with dissatisfied groups to
 force either his removal or a
 serious limitation of his pow-
 ers.   The recent placing of
 tanks, antitank weapons, artil-
 lery, and additional troops
 around Saadabad Palace in Teh-
 ran is regarded by Iranian mili-
 tary men as a sign of f ear and
 weakness on the part of the
 Shah.   Indications that he is
 primarily concerned about his
 own safety will probably have
 an adverse effect on the morale
 of the army, on which he relies
 heavily to preserve his regime.
 The Shah has consolidated
 his power until he is a virtual
 dictator, but has created op-
 position which, under certain
 conditions, could overthrow him.
 Having observed ex-Premier Mos-
 sadeq arouse nationalism and
 having witnessed the fates of
 other Middle Eastern monarchs,
 he realizes he must push through
 political and economic reforms
 or eventually face revolution
 from urban leftists.   At  the
 same  time,  his ref orms must
 not antagonize large landowners
 and other wealthy groups into
 organizing a rightist coup.   In
 addition, he is trying to hold
 the loyalty of the peasants,
 who constitute 80 percent of
 the population, and who could
 become a decisive political
 force.   He is doing this through
 the distribution of crown lands.
 Although Iran's moderniza-
 'tion program and preservation
 of the delicate political bal-
 ance demand  the most effective
 use of all available  talent,
 the Shah refuses to delegate au-
 thority for fear that persons of
 ability may usurp power.   He
 wants to surpass the achieve-
 ments of his father, Reza Shah,
 but lacks the will and  desire
 to use similar ruthless methods.
 The Shah, moreover, while sin-
 cere in his intention to elimi-
 nate corruption in general, has
 not taken measures to prevent
 members  of  ,the .. royal  fam-
 ily  from                                                               using -. their  posi-
 tions :._m tou , inctBaSe  their
 fortunes.
 Typical of the Shah's un-
 willingness to delegate author-
 ity is his treatment of Prime
 Minister Eqbal.   Eqbal, a force-
 ful and popular personality when
 he took office in April  1957,
 has now become completely  sub-
 servient to the Shah and                                                                   thus

 has lost his political prestige. 1  merous opposition members.  Al-
 As the public has become aware
 that the Shah has taken full re-
 sponsibility for directing af-
 fairs, public criticism of gov-
 ernment failures has been in-
 creasingly directed at the mon-
 arch.   Veiled threats  by the
 Shah to ensure prompt passage
 of desired legislation have in-
 creased parliamentary dissatis-
 faction with his methods.
 The Shah's apprehension
 that his power will be usurped
 precludes the development of
 political parties in the West-
 ern sense.   To ensure that no
 political groups acquire real
 strength, the Iranian intelli-
 gence agency is charged with
 overseeing the membership of
 the two existing "parties."
 In an effort to give the
 impression that Iran is a de-
 veloping democracy, the Shah
 has artificially created the
 Nationalist party and the Mar-
 dom (people's) party. The Na-
 tionalist party is designed to
 be "progovernment" and was re-
 luctantly formed by Prime Min-
 ister Eqbal at the Shah's in-
 sistence in February.   Eqbal
 has shown little enthusiasm to
 organize its membership and,
 as a result, the party has re-
 cently lost some important com-
 mittee chairmanships in the
 Majlis to the "opposition" Mar-
 dom party headed by Assadollah
 Alam.
 Alam formed his party in
 May 19 57 and has moved ener-
 getically to enlarge its mem-
 bership.   The Shah may be groom-
 ing Alam for the prime minister-
 ship; however, if Alam is too
 successful in enlarging his
 party, the Shah will probably
 undermine his position.
 Non-Communist Opposition
 If political groups were
 permitted to develop naturally
 in Iran,  nationalists who for-
 merly were followers of Mossadeq
 would probably be the most nu-
 though the government uses
 various repressive tactics on
 them, they continue to meet and
 plan.   They are plagued by dis-
 putes as to the tactics they
 should adopt to oppose the re-
 gime.                                                                The arrest of over 70
 nationalists last year may have
 inclined them toward planning
 extremist measures.   The Shah's
 recent success in gaining favor-
 able oil agreements with Ameri-
 can companies temporarily raised
 his prestige, removing some of
 the nationalists' appeal.
 The Shah apparently has no
 program to obtain the support
 of the growing urban middle class,
 which  admired  Mossadeq and is
 either actually or potentially
 the enemy of the regime.   The
 Shah's hatred of all-who  were
 associated  with the  Mossadeq
 movement keeps him from utiliz-
 ing the talents of even the
 conservative leaders of these
 groups.   The discontent of the
 middle class is a grave politi-
 cal danger in Iran, and should
 this group ever seize the gov-
 ernment, moderates might soon
 be replaced by Nasir-type dema-
 gogues.
 The Shah still has something
 to fear from the Communist Tudeh
 party.   Declared illegal in 1949,
 the party continues to operate,
 particularly in Tehran and the
 oil center of Abadan, despite
 the best efforts of the Iranian
 security forces to eliminate it.
 Although Khosrow Ruzbah, the
 Tudeh leader, was executed in
 May, his death seems to have had
 little effect on the organization.
 The present size of the Tudeh is
 unknown, but in 1953 it had about
 35,000 members before the Iranian
 Government sought to annihilate
 it.
 The party continues to de-
 velop by recruiting Iranian
 youths and students abroad  and
 receiving assistance from for-
 eign Communist parties.   In an

 effort to ease some of the bit-
 terness left over from the Mos-
 sadeq period, the Shah in March
 ordered the release from prison
 of certain Tudeh members for-
 merly in the army and reduced
 the sentences of others.
 Tribal Loyalties
 Many tribal leaders are
 dissatisfied with the regime's
 policies, but the tribes are
 unlikely again to play a large
 political role in Iran without
 foreign assistance.   Develop-
 ment of the Iranian military
 forces, rapid communication,
 higher educational levels,  and
 increasing prosperity among the
 tribes have reduced tribal in-
 clinations to struggle against
 the central government.
 The powerful Bakhtiari .;
 tribe in west-central Iran has
 been closely allied with the
 regime, and a number of its mem-
 bers hold important positions
 in the government.   Since Sor-
 aya,            a  Bakhtiari, was divorced
 by the Shah in March, however,
 there have been rumors that
 the tribe has been losing in-
 f luence.
 The 500,000-strong Kurdish
 tribe in northwestern Iran of-
 fers a potential threat to.Irani-
 an  security, since members could,
 along with some of the 800,000
 Kurds in Iraq, 250,000 in Syria,
 and 1,500,000 in Turkey, agitate
 for an independent Kurdish state.
 Kurdish-language broadcasts from
 the UAR, aimed at arousing Kurd-
 ish nationalism, began in June.
 These,  together with the influ-
 ence of a pro-Nasir government
 in Iraq, could cause widespread
 unrest in northwestern Iran.
 Iran is counterattacking by us-
 ing propaganda and agents to
 convince Kurds in Iran and Iraq
 that they are an Aryan people
 having nothing in common with
 Arabs,  who are using them to
 advance Arab imperialism.
 Iran is especially sensi-
 tive to Kurdish nationalism be-
 cause Mullah Mustafa Barzani,
 former leader of the Barzani
 Kurdish tribe of Iraq, helped
 organize a Soviet-sponsored
 Kurdish republic in Iran in
 1945-46.   When the incipient re-
 public was overthrown by Irani-
 an troops, Barzani and some
 of his followers fled to the
 USSR.
 The Army
 The Shah relies heavily on
 his 143,000-man army to pre-
 serve his power, and he devotes
 considerable time to ensure the
 personal loyalty of its command-
 ers.                                                               To prevent conspiracies,
 he plays one leader against the
 other.   In spite of the Shah's
 precautions, General Valiollah
 Gharani, former G-2, was able
 to form a group, uncovered by
 the Shah early this year, which
 had been plotting for almost a
 year to reduce the Shah to a
 figurehead.   While the army is
 the most dependable of the Shah's
 supports, it contains weaknesses
 which, in a period of severe po-
 litical pressure on the monarch,
 might cause elements to support
 opposing political forces.
 A major weakness is the
 growing rivalry between the old
 officers and the young.   The
 older commanders are disturbed
 by. the threat to their positions
 which arises from young officers
 who are returning from the United
 States after being exposed  to
 the latest military doctrine and
 advanced equipment.   These young
 officers in turn,i who now see
 their senior officers in a new
 light,   are dissatisfied with
 the army's inefficiency and with
 promotions based on family con-
 nections rather than on merit.
 The Shah has assured Ameri-
 can officials he intends to pro-
 mote trained officers into high
 positions.   If he does so rapid-
 ly, however, the older officers
 may attempt to limit his powers
 or remove him.   On the other
 hand, if opportunities for ad-
 vancement occur too slowly, the

 change before they are ratified
 by the USSR Supreme Soviet,prob-
 ably toward the end of the year.
 While major overhauls are un-
 likely, there have been signs
 of continuing disagreement among
 legal experts which might re-
 sult in minor revisions.
 The draft statutes, which
 to a considerable degree merely
 update the old codes first f or-
 mulated in the 1920's and em-
 body recent legislative enact-
 ments, contain no surprises and
 envisage no drastic revision
 of present legislation.   They
 contain some innovations for
 protecting the rights of the
 accused,   suggested  during a
 period of  public  discussion,
 over the past several years,
 but fail to incorporate several
 of the more liberal proposals.
 This failure and evidence of
 compromises can be traced not
 so much to opposition of the
 leadership to adopting moderate
 legal reforms, but rather to
 conflicts of interests among
 the various branches of the
 legal profession--jurists, the
 procuracy, collegia of lawyers
 --and also the police and se-
 curity organs.
 Most of the changes intro-
 duced by the draft statutes are
 apparently designed to give the
 Soviet citizen a fuller expecta-
 tion of a fair trial and, in
 this, they supplement earlier
 measures--the abolition in 1953
 of the MVD's summary trial
 boards and the abrogation in
 1956 of legislation which pre-
 scribed special trial procedures
 for political crimes.  While
 the draft codes still assign
 the Soviet legal system the
 prime political function of pre-
 serving the present political
 and social structure, they also
 acknowledge for the first time
 the "personal, political, prop-
 erty, and other rights of citi-
 zens."
 Thus, without seriously
 weakening its coercive power,
 the party leadership has sought
 to adjust the code to the rela-
 tively more stable conditions
 of Soviet society, and, at the
 same time, garner whatever pop-
 ularity is to be gained from
 a relaxation of criminal penal-
 ties.
 Many questions about crimi-
 nal legislation are left unan-
 swered by the draft statutes,
 and a final appraisal of the
 criminal law and procedure must
 await the appearance of the re-
 public codes.   This is particular-
 ly true in the case of criminal
 law, as opposed to the code of
 criminal procedure, because the
 draft statute provides only a

 frequently advocated in the
 public debate.   Its literal
 adoption was opposed by the
 procuracy and investigative or-
 gans on the grounds that it
 would  inhibit  the prosecution
 of a case--the prosecutor must
 be convinced that the data from
 the    pretrial investigation
 supports the charge against the
 defendant or else he must re-
 fuse to prosecute.
 As a compromise,  Article
 13 states that "the obligation
 to prove the guilt of the ac-
 cused lies with the prosecutor.
 A verdict of guilty may not be
 based on assumptions and may
 only be passed if guilt of the
 accused for the commission of
 the crime is proved."
 Trial:   During the public
 discussions,     it was recommended
 that the number of "people's
 assessors" participating in a
 criminal trial be increased
 over the present two, and there
 were even suggestions that the
 assessors be organized into a
 kind of jury which would de-
 liberate without participation
 of the judge.   These proposals
 were categorically rejected as
 repudiating time-proven Soviet
 court procedure and as marking
 a return to Tsarist court prac-
 tices.   Soviet legal authorities
 would be wary of relying on a
 group of citizens to make a
 decision without benefit of a
 trained jurist.
 Trials are to be held in
 open court except where state
 secrets or information about
 the intimate life of the par-
 ticipants are involved or where
 a minor is concerned.   The court
 is obliged to base its decision
 on a review of all of the infor-
 mation presented,  not just one
 type of evidence, to preclude,
 Baranov states, the "overevalua-
 tion" of a confession.   How-
 ever,  suggestions that a con-
 fession be given a secondary
 status were rejected.
 The procuracy is charged.
 with the general responsibility
 of ensuring that persons sus-
 pected of a crime are appre-
 hended, detained, and charged
 only in accord with legal pro-
 cedures.   According to Article
 17, an arrest may be made only
 by decision of the court or by
 sanction of the procurator, and
 detention of suspects must be
 duly reported to the procuracy.
 Until the new republic codes
 are drafted, it will not be
 clear what, if any, exceptions
 to the procuracy's supervisory
 functions exist.   All of these
 prerogatives were granted in
 the 1955 Statute on the Proc-
 uracy, and, yet, in the 1956
 edition of the RSFSR Criminal
 Code, it was stated in a foot-
 note that the method of sanc-
 tioning arrests by the MVD is
 provided for "in special rules."
 Certain features of the
 draft statute on criminal law
 apparently have been operative
 for some time but have not ap-
 peared in the official code un-
 til now.   According to Article
 4, only "the courts, in accord-
 ance with the law," may sentence
 persons for criminal offenses.
 D. S. Karev, dean of the Law
 Faculty at Moscow University,
 indicated in a recent article
 that this clause was included
 in the draft statute to  ac-
 knowledge that the Special Board
 of the MVD, which was authorized
 to sentence administratively,
 had been abolished.   The lan-
 guage of the statute confirms
 that corrective labor camps
 have been reorganized into cor-
 rective labor colonies.   Special
 colonies have been established
 for juvenile offenders.
 According to Article 3,
 criminal proceedings are not to
 be brought against anyone ex-
 cept for "crimes provided for in
 the criminal code."   This elimi-
 nates the "analogy article" which
 permitted a court to prosecute
 an action "constituting a so-
 cial danger," even if not direct-
 ly specified by the codes,  by
 means of applying sections of

 of the most nearly similar na-

 could circumvent  Article 3
 through loose and vague defini-

 Section 58 on counterrevolu-

 economic   and  administrative
 crimes.
 The severity of the terms

 Criminal Code now in force,
 persons  may be  sentenced for
 imprisonment up to 25 years for
 very serious crimes.   The upper  !
 limit has been reduced in the
 new draft to 15 years.  In addi-
 tion,  the maximum term of exile
 has been reduced from 10 to 5
 years; the terms of parole have
 been liberalized so that a con-
 vict may be released after com-
 pleting  one half  of his term
 instead of two  thirds, and the
 conditions under which an indi-
 vidual can have his criminal
 record expunged have been eased.
 The death penalty has been
 retained for treason, espionage,
 sabotage,  terrorist acts,  pre-
 meditated murder under                          aggra-
 vated circumstances, and, in

 Several distinguished ju

 of the RSFSR Supreme  Soviet,
 have objected to the "parasite
 laws" on the grounds that they
 are unconstitutional and usurp
 the judicial function.   It is
 apparent that the regime,  in
 order to correct what it con-
 siders a serious domestic prob-

 criminal codes and the new

 In addition, the  regime
 has recently taken a Step back-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMIARY
 31 July 19 58
 Colombia--Latin America's
 fourth most populous country
 and the world's second largest
 coffee producer--is faced with
 serious economic problems,  de-
 spite substantial real gains in
 output, new record highs for
 commerce and industry,  in-
 creased employment, and other
 indications that the domestic
 economy is operating at a high
 level.   The drop in coffee
 prices and the poor prospect
 for any reversal of this trend,
 inflation,  and the burden of a
 large commercial debt are
 threats to the stability of
 the democratic government of
 Lleras Camargo which takes of-
 fice on 7 August.
 Background
 The financial mismanage-
 ment of the Rojas dictatorship
 from 1953 to May 1957 left
 Colombia with a rapidly grow-
 ing inflation, a critical defi-
 cit in the balance of payments,
 and an annual budget deficit
 of 10 percent.   The gross na-
 tional product grew at an aver-
 age annual rate of 6 percent
 during this period, but money
 in circulation rose at a rate
 of 18 percent.   Dollar earn-
 ings increased rapidly, but
 imports expanded at an even
 faster rate, leaving a foreign
 commercial debt recently esti-
 mated at $470,000,000.   Since
 the downfall of the Rojas re-
 gime, the military junta and
 civilian cabinet have taken
 steps to free the exchange rate
 and settle the backlog of com-
 mercial debt.   They have also
 restricted credit and imports.
 and conducted a limited eco-
 nomic austerity program.
 A deepening of the eco-
 nomic crisis could threaten
 Colombia's attempt to achieve
 social and political stability
 after some ten years of auto-
 cratic government, bitter po-
 litical warfare, and rural
 violence which have resulted
 in an estimated 100,000 deaths.
 While the scheduled inaugura-
 tion on 7 August of Lleras
 Camargo as the joint Liberal-
 Conservative president will give
 Colombia for the first time in
 many years a leader elected by
 a majority of the people, the
 long-standing political and so-
 cial conditions which have re-
 sulted in instability and vio-
 lence still remain.
 Neither of the parties
 comprising the government has
 pressed for a program of basic
 social or economic reforms to
 better the position of the low-
 er classes.   Both parties repre-
 sent the landed upper classes
 and will probably do little to
 make the needed changes in the
 agricultural sector  of  the
 economy, except to rehabilitate
 the peasants driven off their
 farms by partisan guerrilla
 warfare.
 In spite of credit and
 import restrictions, the econ-

 omy on the whole continues
 prosperous under the momentum
 generated by the inflationary
 growth of previous years.   The
 reduction in imports of capital
 goods,  however,  is likely to
 have an adverse effect on the
 long-range productive capacity
 of Colombian industry.
 The present inflation is
 a source of great bitterness

 The rising cost of living could

 the delicate balance of the

 The burden of the huge
 commercial debt left by the
 Rojas regime, coupled with the
 drop in exchange revenues from
 coffee, is a further obstacle
 to the government's attempts
 to restore the country's eco-
 nomic position.   The backlog
 has been settled by drawing on
 reserves and current income
 from coffee sales, by funding
 arrangements with US banks, and
 by borrowing from the Export-
 Import Bank and private banks.
 As a result,  Colombia must de-
 vote 15 percent of its future
 dollar income to servicing its
 foreign governmental and com-
 mercial debt, a burden further
 compounded by falling foreign
 exchange revenue from coffee
 sales.   The prospect that such
 revenue would be inadequate to
 cover minimum essential imports
 led Colombia to obtain a $103,-
 000,000 credit line from the
 Export-Import   Bank  and  pri-
 vate  US  banks                   in  June.
 The world overproduction of
 coffee has forced prices down
 from 72 to 52 cents per pound
 in New York during the past year,
 and has drastically reduced Colom-
 bia's dollar exchange earnings,
 85 percent of which are obtained
 from coffee exports.   Since last
 October, when it signed the Mexi-
 co City Agreement, in which the
 members agreed to withhold a
 percentage of their crops from
 export, Colombia has accumulated
 a surplus of over 3,000,000 bags
 of coffee, and exports have de-
 clined steadily during recent
 months.   Unless exports increase
 substantially in the second half
 of the year, the annual level
 will be the lowest since 1942.
 The government has been
 forced to print money to pay

 of coffee would drop sharply
 if the Latin American coffee
 surplus were put on the market.
 This drop would not be offset
 by an increase in sales, since
 the demand for coffee is fair-
 ly constant regardless of price
 variations.   Opponents of
 Colombia's coffee policy feel
 the market for Colombian cof-
 fee would not drop as much as
 that for other stronger varie-
 ties, such as Brazilian and
 African.
 Nevertheless,  the policy
 of the National Coffee Federa-
 tion is supported by many in-
 fluential government officials
 and is not likely to change in
 the near future.   Meanwhile,
 the United States may expect
 continued pressure for an in-
 ternational pact to stabilize
 coffee prices.
 Economic Prospects
 The government can  be
 expected to maintain its tight
 SECRET
 money policies under the lead-
 ership  of                                                               Lleras Camargo,
 who  has  promised  to  direct
 major  efforts  to  the solu-
 tion                                                            of        the  country's eco-
 nomic                                                              problems,   and  this
 will also     have some arrest-

 ent                                                            high level  of  activity.
 Inflationary  pressures
 show no  signs  of  abating,
 and, unless a  new  coffee
 arrangement is  reached,
 the  government may  be forced
 to  print     more money  to pay
 for  the coffee  retention
 program. The  $103,000,000
 loan from  the  United States
 will ease  the  austerity of
 import  restrictions, but will
 not  provide  sufficient  im-
 ports  to  eliminate  the  ex-
 cess                                                            demand   for  imported
 goods and   services.   These
 inflationary  pressures and
 the  foreign  trade   deficit
 will continue  to  threaten
 political  stability.
