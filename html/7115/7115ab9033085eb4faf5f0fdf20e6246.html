 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE STAFF STUDY
 The Chinese Communist Party and the Intellectuals
 This study is a working paper, reflecting informa-
 tion received through 1 May 1958.  Examining only one
 policy among the many inter-related policies of the Chi-
 nese Communist party,- this paper attempts primarily to
 illuminate certain hypotheses which are central to the
 work of the Polo project.   These hypotheses are:   that
 there can be a significant range of disagreement among
 party leaders on major issues; that disagreement can per-
 sist even after Mao Tse-tung has decided what policy to
 pursue; that the views of individual leaders can some-
 times be conjectured from their roles in the party's
 presentation of its policy; and that the positions taken
 by leaders on a matter of policy can affect their status
 in the party.   That these hypotheses are valid has been
 strongly suggested--and in some instances demonstrated--
 by developments in other areas of policy which have been
 examined by Polo but have not yet been formalized in a
 Polo paper.   It is believed that the development of the
 party's policy toward intellectuals gives further sup-
 port to the first three of the above hypotheses, although
 information has not yet come to hand which would demon-
 strate that this particular issue has appreciably af-
 fected the status of individual leaders.

 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE INTELLECTUALS
 (SUMMARY)
 Party Policy Toward Intellectuals,  1921-1949  . . .  .  .  . Page 1
 Like the Soviet Communist party, the Chinese Communist
 party distrusted intellectuals from the start.  The CCP fol-
 lowed Stalin in attempting to reconstruct old intellectuals
 and produce a new set of Communist intellectuals.     Mao Tse-
 tung himself made clear that the price for even the qualified
 trust of the party was the destruction of the intellectual
 as a free intelligence.
 Early Years of the Peiping Regime,  1949-1954  . . .  .  .   Page 3
 The Peiping regime soon undertook the thought-remolding
 of intellectuals.   Beginning in 1950,  intellectuals lived in
 the same fear as did the "capitalists."  Writers and artists
 were attacked in 1951 and early 1952.   In spring 1952, how-
 ever, Peiping shifted to a "soft" line on the capitalists.
 There appeared to be concurrently a somewhat softer policy
 toward intellectuals.   There was not another major campaign
 against the intellectuals until 1954.
 New Attacks on the Intellectuals,  1954 .  . .  .  . .  .  .   Page 7
 Mao's two top lieutenants,  Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-
 lai, differed somewhat in discussing intellectuals in Sep-
 tember 1954.   Liu, closely following Mao's line, emphasized
 the need for long and difficult remolding, whereas  Chou
 said that remolding had been generally succe ;sful and in-
 tellectuals were already playing a major role.  Thereafter,
 the party launched two new campaigns, against classical
 scholars and philosophers.   Proteges of Mao appeared to be
 directing these campaigns.   Attacks or a philosopher critical
 of the CCP's rural policies coincided with Mao's decision
 to speed up agricultural collectivization.
 The Hu Feng Case,  1954-1955 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . .  .  . Page 11
 Attacks on intellectuals within the Chinese Communist
 party soon focused on the independent-minded writer              Hu
 Feng.   He had long believed that Mao's policy on the arts
 should be interpreted more liberally.         Hu was finally
 branded a "counterrevolutionary" and imprisoned, thus :'in-
 dicating the illiberal exponents of Mao's policy.  While
 some members of the CCP central committee may privately
 have sympathized with Hu's view, apparently none was active

 on Hu's behalf.   The case was followed by warnings against
 pollution of the CCP by unreliable intellectuals.  By late
 1955,  party leaders had badly frightened the intellectuals
 and had reduce their ability and inclination to do useful
 work.
 Chou En-lai's "Soft" Line,  January 1956 .  .  .  .  . . .  .Page 16
 Chou En-lai in January 1956, citing the regime's ur-
 gent need to advance in the modern sciences, called for
 much better treatment of those intellectuals willing to
 work within the limits of Communist dogma.     He asserted
 that about 80 percent of the intellectuals were politi-?
 cally reliable, proposed a number of practical measures
 to improve their lot, and asked that a large proportion
 of them be taken into the party by 1962.   Of the CCP's
 top leaders, Mao Tse-tung and Chou were presum#bly in
 agreement on this new tack; Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping,  however, were probably reluctant to see even this
 much "liberalization."  The party propaganda department
 promptly supported Chou's new line.
 Mao Inaugurates "Liberalization," Spring 1956 .  . .  .   Page 21
 The Mao-Chou line was reflected in Peiping's hand-
 ling of de-Stalinization in April.   The Chinese state-
 ment asserted that a perfect harmony of views would nev-
 er exist in any society.   Then in May,  in an unpublished
 speech, Mao took another big step in offering the slogan,
 "let all flowers bloom,  let various schools of thought
 contend."  Mao's propaganda chief, Lu Ting-i, soon pro-
 vided an authorized explication of Mao's position.  Cit-
 ing, lake Chou, the need for scientific advance, Lu de-
 nied that the natural sciences have a class character.
 Lu called in various ways for a relaxation of party con-
 trol over both the theories and the thinkers  in  the
 natural sciences.

 Lu's speech was first interpreted by regime spokes-
 men in a conservative way.   The propaganda department
 then decided on a "soft" interpretation.                    At the party
 congress in September, CCP leaders again differed                       in
 their discussion of intellectuals.   Liu Shao-chi endorsed
 the "hundred flowers" policy, but emphasized the need for
 long-term remolding of intellectuals,   warned  of                      their

 corrupting influence, and left no room for criticism of Com-
 munist doctrine.   Teng Hsiao-ping did not even mention the
 "hundred flowers," and emphasized the need for careful se-
 lection and supervision of party members.   Chou En-lai was
 more conciliatory than either. A conservative interpreta-
 tion of the "hundred flowers" became dominant after the
 troubles in Eastern Europe, and continued into February.

 Mao Tse-tung in February and March reaffirmed his "hun-
 dred flowers" policy in unprecedentedly liberal terms.   In
 discussing "contradictions among the people," Mao argued
 that there are conflicts of interests between the leaders
 and the led in a Socialist society, and that,  in dealing
 with the problems arising from such conflicts, the party
 would require constant criticism from outside the party.
 the "hundred flowers" policy  had    25X1
 been opposed by most other CCP leaders, but that he had in-
 sisted on it because he was sure he was right.   Neither of
 Mao's speeches included the criteria for acceptable criti-
 cism--which in fact cut off free discussion--that appeared
 in the later published version of the February speech. Zar'.y
 in March, the propaganda department shifted its emphasis to
 get in step with Mao's liberal line.  Other party leaders,
 however, remained silent through March.
 Confusion and Opposition in the Party, April 1957 .
 .  . Page  35
 Throughout April, there were continuing indications                25X1
 of confusion about Mao's line
 and of party opposition to the "hundred flowers"  25X1
 policy, which was in conflict with long-established pat-
 terns of thought.   To the orthodox, Mao's policy must have
 seemed a dangerous novelty.   The party press tried to rep-
 resent the party as united in support of the "hundred flow-
 ers."  Peng Chen did strongly endorse Mao's line.                                           25X1
 In late April, the central committee
 made the "hundred flowers" policy an important part of its
 party "rectification" campaign.   At the end of April, Mao
 spoke again for his policy                                     25X1
 apparently condemned his op-
 ponents in strong language, and seems even to have suggested
 an inclination to modify the party's organizational methods.

 An indication that "liberalization" would be reversed
 was provided by Mao himself on 25 May, by which time CCP
 leaders were probably united in that decision.   The public
 reversal came on 18 June, with the appearance of an offi-
 cial version of Mao's February speech on "contradictions."
 While Mao reaffirmed that contradictions among "the peo-
 ple" were to be handled by generally conciliatory means,
 Mao made clear that serious opponents were excluded from
 the ranks of the people and that the party intended to
 convert all who questioned any part of Communist dogma.
 In discussing intellectuals, Mao reflected Liu Shao-chi's
 abiding suspicion of that class rather than his own recent
 confidence.   While asserting that the "hundred flowers"
 policy would continue, Mao stated criteria for distinguish-
 ing flowers from weeds which forbade criticism of the par-
 ty's monopoly of power and of its basic program--Just those
 things which had been most enthusiastically criticized in
 May.   The CCP propaganda department tried to conceal Mao's
 original miscalculation by encouraging the view that a
 trap had been laid for the intellectuals.   By the end of
 June, the conclusion was clear to the party and the popu-
 lace:   "liberalization" ova:, finished.
 Solidarity of CCP Leaders, Summe' 1957 .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .Page 45
 Chinese Communist leaders were at pains throughout
 summer 195? to demonstrate their solidarity on the deci-
 sion to reverse "liberalization" and to take a harder
 line toward the intellectuals.   Those of Mao's lieutenants

 The Intellectuals Attack the Party, May 1957 .  .  .  .  . . Page 38
 Many intellectuals, while correctly believing that
 Mao's "hundred flowers" policy had not been designed as
 a trap, failed to realize that Mao had not anticipated
 fundamental criticism of the party.   Many intellectuals
 therefore spoke out boldly in forums held during May.
 They struck hard at the CCP's monopoly of power,  its meth-
 ods of asserting ita monopoly, and its basic policies--
 including the speed of socialization, the scope of the re-
 gime's security and indoctrination programs, and its fideli-
 ty to the USSR.   There was some slight effort during May to
 keep criticism within bounds, but not until late May was
 there a signal from a top-level leader that the party was
 about to crack down.

 who had had the most important roles in promoting "lib-
 oralization"--Chou En-lai, 1Lu Ting-i, and Peng Chen--made
 major speeches lining themselves up with Mao's revised
 position.   Several other politburo members had lesser
 roles in explicating the new line, as did central commit-
 tee members directing the important central departments
 of the party.   Liu Shao-chi, who was publicly and plausi-
 bly charged by one rightist in this period with having
 opposed "liberalization" from the start, remained silent.
 This he could well afford to do, if he were known by other
 party leaders to have been right.   Teng Hsiao-ping, be-
 lieved to have stood with Liu against "liberalization,"
 also remained silent in this period, biding his time until
 September.
 Teng Hsiao-pin   Sums It Up, September 1957 .  . .  .  . .   Page 48
 In September 1957, Secretary General Teng Hsiao-
 ping reported on the party's decision to merge its
 "rectificatiod'movement and the "antirightist campaign"
 into one nationtide "rectification" movement.  Addressing
 the Intellectuals,  Teng stated flatly that thera would be
 no change in any of the CCP's principles and major poli-
 cies.   in contrast to the view held by Mao and Chou En-,
 lai in 1956 and early 1957, Teng said that most intellec-
 tuals were still hostile to the party, and called for in-
 tensive "socialist education" and vigorous organizational
 measures to ensure party control of them.  Teng further
 observed that the party would raise its standards for re-
 cruitment of intellectuals, and that most of those already
 in the party would have a harder time.   By the time Teng's
 speech was published, hundreds of "rightists" had been "ex-
 posed" and ruined, many had been arrested, and some had re-
 portedly been shot.   It must have been clear to the intel-
 lectuals that their position in October 1957 was, and would
 rem:.in, considerably worse than it had been in early 1956
 when the experiment with "liberalization" began.

 The failure of Mao's experiment with "liberalization"
 in 1956-57 followed at least two other instances of Mao's
 personal intervention in 1955-56 which had disappointing
 results.   By mid-1957, Mao had probably brought nearer the

 En-lai, as a spokesman for "liberalization," presumably did
 not decline in stature in Mao's oyes, but  probably  lost
 some f&.ce with "organizational" leaders who had avoided as-
 sociation with the policy.   Lu Ting-i was so well known as
 simply a reflector of Mao's position thsLt his status could
 have remained unchanged, but he may have lost a little.
 Deng Chen similarly may have slipped only a little, but, if
 his strong support of Mao's line in spring 1957 represented
 a deliberate bid for Mao's favor over Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Hsiao-ping, Peng injured himself seriously with the latter
 pair.   Among the conjectured defenders of orthodoxy, Liu
 and Teng seemed to come out very well.   They apparently re-
 tained the high favor of Mao and gained in stature with
 other party leaders, enhancing their prospects, together
 or separately, to dominate the post-Mao party leadership.
 Ko Ching-ship apparently improved his chances to be taken
 into the party's inner circle, and Kang Sheng may have im-
 proved his previously declining position.

 Party Policy Toward Intellectuals, 1921-1949
 Under the influence of Comintern agents in the 1920's,
 the Chinese Communist party (CCP) reflected Lenin's and
 Stalin's distrust of intellectuals.  As early as June
 1922,  the CCP central committee's First Manifesto stated
 that "The government /That is, the Chinese Nationalist
 party (Kuomintang)7 opposition game, played by the
 bourgeoisie, the, Tntelligentsia, and the politicians,
 cannot be trusted."
 The CCP also criticized intellectuals within its
 own ranks,  Stalin had conceived the device of blaming
 the executors--not the originators--of a policy for its
 failure, and had held that the class status of the exec-
 utors was partly responsible for their incompetence.  When
 his China policy resulted in a sequev..e of severe defeats
 for the CCP and he was obliged to change the line, Stalin
 baited the "intellectuals" in the Chinese party.   Follow-
 ing suit, CCP leaders in 1927--under the guidan^e of Com-
 intern agent Lominadze--attacked other unspecified CCP
 leaders as intellectuals.   These latter were criticized
 for "vacillation, irresolution at critical moments, and
 false, unrevolutionary theories which were contradictory
 to Communism."  Similarly, the Political Resolution of the
 CCP's sixth congress, which was held in Moscow id "September
 1928, characterized some members of the Chinese party's
 "revolutionary intelligentsia" as "class-alienated ele-
 ments" whose line of thought led the Chinese party into
 the practice of putschism.
 In the late 1920's, Stalin also attacked the Russian
 intelligentsia in order to maintain his prestige in the
 USSR.   He made intellectuals the scapegoats for discontent
 created by his policy of rapid socialization between 1928
 and 1931.   They were charged with economic sabotage and
 conspiracy with foreigners against the Soviet regime.
 The pressing need for a technical intelligentsia,
 however, resulted in a new line in June 1931, when Stalin
 announced a change from the policy of "routing" intel-
 lectuals to a policy of "enlisting them and solicitude
 for them."  In addition to utilizing the remnants of the
 old intelligentsia, Stalin set in motion a vast training
 program to produce a new Soviet-bred technical intel-
 ligentsia.                                   In June 1931 he called on the party to "create
 its own industrial and technical intelligentsia," and in
 November 1936 he remarked that the Soviet intelligentsia

 was "entirely new, bound by its very roots with the work-
 ing class and peasantry."  In order to maintain doctrinal
 consistency, Stalin described it as a class "stratum,"
 rather than a class, and designated it the "working intel-
 ligentsia."
 The change in Stalin's attitude--from total distrust
 of intellectuals to qualified trust of reconstructed or
 Soviet-produced intellectuals--was reflected in the CCP's
 policy.   For the Chinese party,  the intellectuals were
 desired as political rather than economic allies.
 Chinese intellectuals enjoyed considerable political
 prestige in China, where the masses of people were (and
 are) illiterate.   In 1.939 Mao described them as having a
 "keen political sense" and as "generally quite revolu-
 tionary."                                  He placed most of China's intellectuals in the
 petty bourgeois class--a class which he described as "a
 reliable ally of the proletariat."  For reasons that are
 not clear, Mao declared that the intellectuals do not
 constitute either a separate class or a "stratum."
 Although Mao's doctrinal definition of the intel-
 ligentsia differed from Stalin's, he raised a requirement
 for cooperation with intellectuals which was similar to
 Stalin's.  He specified that only a reconstructed, Commu-
 nist-bred intelligentsia could work together wi'h the
 party.   In a 1939 article, he stated that:
 The ultimate line of demarcation between the revolu-
 tionary intellectuals and nonrevolutionary and
 counterrevolutionary intellectuals lies 'n whether
 they are willing to, and actually do, become one
 with the workers and peasants.   The ultimate line
 of demarcation between them lies in this alone,
 and not in whether.they talk about the Three Peo-
 ple's Principles or Marxism.
 For the intellectuals "actually" to unite with the workers
 and peasants (that is, to become loyal to the CCP) implied
 that a new mental attitude might be created among them by
 the party.   Mao seems to have had a belief similar to Sta-
 lin's that ideological indoctrination could "create" for
 the Communists their "own" intelligentsia.
 The December 1939 Decision on the Absorption of Intel-
 lectuals of the CCP's central committee removed the barrier
 to the induction of intellectuals into the party.   It

 criticized party units for their reluctance to enroll in-
 tellectuals and called for a policy of "absorbing intel-
 lectuals en masse."
 In his 1942 Speech at the Yenan Forum of Literature
 and Art, Mao made     clear that the price of gaining even
 the qualified trust of the CCP for any intellectual  was
 his self-destruction as a free intelligence.
 Will not Marxism-Leninism then destroy the crea-
 tive spirit?  Yes.   is will destroy any brand of
 creative spirit which is not of the masses and
 of the proletariat.  And is it not right that
 these brands of creative spirit should be destroyed
 as far as proletarian writers and artists are con-
 cerned?  I think so....The intellectuals must
 identify themselves with the masses and serve the
 masses. This process may, in fact it definitely
 will, produce much suffering and friction.
 Mao thought that Chinese intellectuals--although most-
 ly of the "scribbling set," writers, philosophers, and
 philologists--might become a cohesive political force.
 That is, they might develop group attitudes and group in-
 terests sufficiently strong to make large numbers of them
 behave in the way that is usually associated with the con-
 cept of social classes.  He would not tolerate attitudes
 and interests basically different from those of the CCP.
 The policy embodied in Mao's 1942 speech reflected
 Stalin's view that the potential of the intelligentsia
 to oppose the party dictatorship must be eliminated.   In-
 deed, Mao emphasized more strongly than Stalin the need
 to remold the thoughts of intellectuals, especially the
 thoughts of the older men.,   Mao's emphasis apparently be-
 came a CCP policy.   There is some evidence that an indi-
 vidual whose mind was being remolded by the Chinese Commu-
 nists was treated by his reformers more destructively and
 over a longer period of time than one subjected to Soviet
 Communist indoctrination.   Even as early as 1942, however,
 Mao was careful to speak of this policy in terms of a need
 to "persuade and educate" deviators.
 Early Years of the Peiping Regime, 1949-1954
 A number of Mao Tse-tung's proteges were charged with
 stating Mao's policy toward intellectuals after the Peiping
 regime was established in 1949.  The key figures in the

 party's propaganda department were Lu Ting-i,  the depart-
 ment director, and Chen Po-ta and Hu Chino-mu, Lu's ef-
 fective deputies.   Lu had become important in the party
 after Mao took over the party leadership in 1935.  Both
 Chen and Hu had been secretaries to Mao.   All three had
 been Mao's spokesmen for many years.  The three were
 probably the writers of most of the leading editorials
 in the party's newspaper,  the People's Daily.   A fourth
 important spokesman in this fi id was the Yenan-trained
 Chou Yang, who was apparently to specialize in party
 policy toward the arts.
 The CCP's effort to extend its control over China's
 old intellectuals and to train new intellectuals was in-
 tensified within months after the establishment of the
 Peiping regime in October 1949.   In a June 1950 speech,
 Mao Tse-tung personally sparked a drive for the thought-
 remolding of intellectuals--an effort'whic h had been
 under way but had not assumed campaign proportions.
 In imposing the method of "criticism and self-
 criticism," Mao was following a Stalinist precedent for
 attaining complete submissiveness of intellectuals.  Self-
 criticism in China was actually a public confession of a
 number of practical and "thought" crimes which a Commu-
 nist cadre had "exposed" in his criticism of an intel-
 lectual.   This public confession presumably helped the in-
 tellectual to align himself with the CCP's program.                                    It
 was intended to impress on the populace that the party
 was both wiser and more powerful than the intelligentsia.
 Beginning in 1950,  the intellectuals apparently lived
 in the same atmosphere of fear that oppressed the "capital-
 ists."                               Many later spoke of the "wounds" they had received
 in thought-remolding drives.
 Writers and artists were the first group attacked by
 the party.   In April 1951, the CCP concentrated its efforts
 on a film,  the Story of Wu Hsun, which depicted the life
 of a 19th-century individualist who raised money for a
 school by begging and shrewd investments.
 In attacking the film, the Peiping regime reversed
 a public stand on intellectual policy taken by one of its
 top puppets.  The film had been praised by Kuo Mo-jo, the
 professional "non-Communist" whom the CCP had chosen to
 head the All-China Federation of Literature and Art.  Kuo
 later felt obliged to state that he, like other non-Commu-
 nist intellectuals, was still "remolding" his thoughts.

 This admission was apparently meant to show any intel-
 lectuals who might resist "remolding" that even an in-
 tellectual with impressive party support was required
 to endure it.
 Playing a major role in the drive to impose tighter
 party control over waiters and artists was Chou Yang.
 Chou clearly regarded himself as acting for Mao.  When,
 in May 1952, he called for the strengthening of "organi-
 zation" of creative work, Mao's 1942 Speech was his text.
 In a People's Daily article, Chou stres-se -Mao's view
 that the arts musVserve the revolution, must be based
 on the "science" of dialectical materialism, and must
 prevent the encroachment of bourgeois standards.
 In the same May article, Chou expressed Mao's realis-
 tic view that it would require considerable time to ef-
 fect thought-remolding among literary and art workers. Mao's
 determination to reduce these intellectuals to loyal fol-
 lowers of the party line, regardless of obstacles, was
 reaffirmed in Chou's article:
 Thought remolding--that is, the defeat of all
 backward ideologies by means of the progressive
 ideology of the working class, involving changes
 in a man's entire world-view, sentiments, psy-
 chological make-up, hat:Lts, and interests--is a
 long and painful process.
 As pointed out by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, "The
 complete solution of this problem necessitates
 a long period of 8 to 10 years."
 However, Comrade Mao Tse-tung also pointed
 out with the greatest determination that, "No
 matter how long it takes us, we must have the
 problem solved--irrevocably and once and for all."
 In the spring of 1952, Peiping released Mao's essay
 On Contradiction.  The release apparently was the signal
 for a shift to a "soft" line on "capitalists."  The essay
 took the line that the principal "contradiction"--the
 class struggle between capitalist and worker--may in some
 circumstances be regarded as nonprincipal, so that it
 may be minimized.  The party apparently was being informed
 that cadres must not insist too much on the fundamental
 doctrine of class struggle because there were more urgent,
 practical issues to consider.

 Stalin's policy of "smashing" the capitalists--a policy
 which was being carried out in Eastern Europe at the time--
 was in effect being criticized between the lines of On Con-
 tradiction.  The scapegoats were theorists who had assiduous-
 y  o  owed the party's previous "hard" line in writing for
 Study, the CCP's theoretical journal.   Prominent theorist
 Ai Ssu-chi had written, in a March issue, on the "reactionary
 nature" of the capitalists; others had declared, in a Feb-
 ruary issue, that  the capitalists had launched a "ferocious
 attack" on the working class.
 On 10 April, the publication of Study was suspended.
 The editorial board stated that:
 In several recent issues some articles on the ques-
 tion of the capitalists made the mistake of one-
 sidedness, which is also related ti  dogmatism and
 party je rgon.... The republication of Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung's On Contradiction awakens us and makes
 us feel that we must adopt an extremely sober at-
 titude and quickly correct these shortcomings
 and mistakes.
 The change in line apparently resulted in the temporary
 demotion of propaganda chief Lu Ting-i, whose duties pre-
 sumably included supervision of Study.  Lu is reported to
 have made a self-criticism in April 19 52.  Hsi Chung-hsun
 was later identified as the new propaganda chief.
 Fragmentary information indicates that Chen Po-ta
 publicized the new line for the propaganda department dur-
 ing the shake-up period.   In an article in the 21 April is-
 sue of the People's Dail   he noted that the party's policy
 toward the bourgeoisie was "to unite with it, not to eco-
 nomically liquidate it."         In the 13 May issue of the People's
 Da iy, he praised Mao's understanding of the "transformation"
 of contradi.ctions.
 The delay in reissuing Study probably reflected Lu
 Ting-i's demotion and the confusion resulting from it.  The
 editors of the People's Daily on 28 June stated:
 When the publication of Study was suspended for a
 review of its work, we i1.ended to resume publica-
 tion by June 1952.  Inasmuch ae preparatory work
 is still unfinished, we have decided to postpone
 publication until 1 August.

 The decision on a "soft" line toward China's capital-
 ists was apparently taken concurrently with a decision to
 adopt a somewhat more moderate policy toward China's in-
 tellectuals.  The party did not start another major drive
 against the intellectuals until late 1954, when Kuo Mo-,jo
 stated that "during the past few years.... the ideological
 struggle in learning and literature has been a bit too
 quiet and unruffled.!'
 New Attacks on the Intellectuals,, 1954
 In September 1954, Liu Shao-chi, Mao's first lieu-
 tenant for party affairs, reported to the National Peo-
 ple's Congress on the draft constitution of the Peiping
 regime.  Liu held out the possibility, to the great ma-
 jority of intellectuals, of becoming "working-class in-
 tellectuals," but again made clear that this achievement
 would require a long-term process of "remolding."  Liu
 called on the state to "rally all intellectuals, except
 the handful of reactionary intell ectuals...,(and) help
 them to remold their ideology...."  Liu cited Mao to
 the effect that intellectuals "who have distinguished
 themselves in the service of the people-must be respected
 as valuable assets to the State."  This formulation did
 not assert that the intellectuals in their-then current
 character were to be regarded as major assets, but that
 remolded intellectuals who had proved their value to the
 ommun st cause would be so regarded. Liu strongly im-
 plied that the road ahead for the intellectuals would be
 rough..
 Chou En-lai's emphasis, in his remarks on the intel-
 lectuals on the same occasion, was somewhat different.
 Chou reflected the regime's intention to create its own
 intellectuals, noting the establishment of "short-term
 secondary schools in which we are training our new intel-
 lectuals--of worker and peasant origin."  Chou's account
 of the results of the remolding of old intellectuals
 seemed, however, more sanguine than Liu's.  Citing "con-
 siderable reforms" in education in recent years, Chou
 described these reforms as "successful." Further, relat-
 ing these reforms to the "ideological reform of vast num-
 bers of our intellectuals," Chou said flatly that "the
 work of ideological reform of the intellectuals is ef-
 fective."  Finally, somewhat in contrast to Liu's implica-
 tion that the usefulness of the intellectuals lay in the
 future, Chou said that "it is generally admitted" that

 indoctrinated and technically trained intellectuals are
 "now playing a much more important role" in national con-
 sTruction.
 The party in the last few months of 1954 launched
 two new campaigns--one against classical scholars, one
 against philosophers.  First to be hit was Professor Yu
 Ping-po's interpretation of the Red Chamber Dream--a
 famous 18th century Chinese novT -wwhii chi was criticized
 for viewing the novel as "mystical, noncommittal, and
 naturalistic" rather than as a criticism of 18th-century
 Chinese feudal society.
 The vigor and suddenness of the attack seem to have
 been the work of a competent, orthodox-line group of party
 leaders.   It is possible that Lu Ting-i had been restored
 to his post of propaganda department chief and that Chou
 Yang and Chang Chi-chun, later identified as two deputy
 directors, had been chosen at that time.  Veteran deputy
 director Hu Chiao-mu and People's Daily editor Teng To
 were also active in the pr`opagan a-department's attack.
 The attack apparently caught literary circles by
 surprise.   In September and October 1954, the party's
 major literary magazine (Literature, Wen I Pao) and a
 Peiping newspaper pui;lishe  articles by who young Chi-
 nese.   The articles criticized Professor Yu's views. The
 editors of both publications, however, apparently were un-
 aware that the young Chinese were being used by important
 party leaders to impose a "hard" line.  The editors pref-
 aced                      the articles with a derogatory remark about the im-
 maturity of the authors' views.
 The young  critics were supported by their powerful
 mentors through the People's Daily, which on 23 October
 1954 hailed their attack -on Yu s  nterpretation of the
 Dream as the "first valuable shot" fired against idealist
 methodology in the study of classical literature "in the
 past 30 years."  Their attack served as the spearhead in
 a subsequent campaign against "bourgeois idealism" in
 literary criticism which spread to every part of China.
 One of the propaganda department's deputy directors,
 Hu Chiao-mu, apparently had alerted the propaganda depart-
 ment to the feasibility of using Professor Yu Ping-po as a
 whipping by in its attack on literary critics.   Yu earlier
 in 1954 had sent the manuscript of his heretical monograph
 "Short Discourse on the Red Chamber Dream" to Hu Chiao-mu.

 The latter returned the manuscript to professor Yu "with
 many suggestions, asking for it to be rewritten."
 Chou Yang,  the most aggressive of the deputy direc-
 tors of the party's propaganda department, apparently had
 failed to get the word on the Dream case.  In December
 1954 Chou confessed that the error of Literature, in
 "suppressing" the youths who had attacKed Prof    or Yu,
 was also his error.
 For the past few years, I hisve devoted a great
 part of my energy to cultural administrative
 work in the government and have paid scanty at-
 tention to the question of ideology in literary
 and art works.   I have rarely read any writings
 in earnest and,as a resu    have made insuf-
 ficient contact with various writers....I
 should hold myself responsible for the error
 made by Literature....
 The confession appears to reflect Chou's primary responsi-
 bility in the propaganda department--that is, as an or-
 ganizer of writers, rather than an originator of party
 lines.
 The party sought to compel scholars of classical
 literature to accept its views--that the Dream was a criti-
 cism of feudal society--by polemic argumens and threats.
 Of the many widely publicized articles upholding the
 "correct" interpretation of the Dream, only Teng To's, ap-
 pearing in 9 January 1955, seemed to be both ideologically
 sound and an impressive job of research.  Making a case
 for the novel as one reflecting the beginnings of both a
 "popular ideology and consciousness" and "capitalist rela-
 tionships" in 18th century China,  the article showed Teng
 to be a persuasive and accomplished exponent of the party
 line.
 The party leadership's effort to eliminate all modes
 of thought except the official mode soon turned to the
 philosophers.   The philosopher-baiting campaign was from
 its beginning in late 1954 directed primarily at the most
 influential living non-Communist Chinese philosopher,
 expatriate Hu Shih.   Intellectuals were directed to write
 criticisms of "Hu Shih-ism" and to show why and how his
 ideas were unacceptable in the "new" China.

 Hu had been attacked in 1951.   It was asserted in
 late 1954, however,  that the former attacks had only
 touched on his reactionary politics and his domination
 of the academic world of his day, and that his reactionary
 bourgeois "ideology" had not been "penetratingly analyzed."
 Hu's ideas we.-,-e denounced apparently because the
 CCP believed that they were shared by many intellectuals.
 An article in a November 1954 issue of the People's Daily
 stated that Hu's political ideology "perished with old
 China, but his pragmatism still everts considerable in-
 fluence on our intellectuals."  In April 1955, an article
 in the party's theoretical journal declared that "Hu
 Shih's influence has not been completely removed....Hu?s
 ideology is a type of bourgeois-imperialistic thought
 which in the past has sought to obstruct the people's
 democratic revolution in China and now it may again ob-
 struct the work of socialism.  Therefore, to repudiate
 the ideology of the Hu Shih clique is still necessary."
 Hu's belief in individualism, his skepticism about
 "established" or absolute principles, and his advocacy
 of extreme democracy approaching anar"hy were the CCP's
 chief targets.  The party leadership probably believed
 that its failure to criticize these ideas might hinder
 the implementation of drastic social reforms and the use
 of shock and pressure tactics in socialization and in-
 dustrialization.
 Another influential Chinese philosopher whose ideas
 were incompatible with the party's program--Liang Shu-ming--
 was severely pilloried in official publications from Decem-
 ber 1954 to November 1955.   Instead of regarding industrial-
 ization as the panacea for the populace's low standard of
 living, Liang in the 1930's had placed first importance
 on the regeneration of China's rural life, economy, and
 local self-government.   He had been sufficiently curious
 about the Chinese Communists' land policy to pay a visit
 to Mao Tse-tung at Yenan in 1938, but he soon returned
 without having been converted.   In all his writings he re-
 jected radical political change and opposed Communism,
 denying the existence of sharp class divisions in China.
 and condemning the Communist instigation of class strug-
 gle as senseless.
 Since 1949, the party had succeeded only in persuad-
 ing, or compelling, him to make several public confessions.
 The first, published in October 1954, contained an

 acknowledgment  that clasE struggle could create a stable
 political power; the second, made in November, showed a
 flicker of independence; the third, made in an "open
 letter" to Chinese on Taiwan in February 1955,  showed
 between the lines his continued rejection of official
 thought.
 The criticism campaign against Liang was intensified
 in July 1955 and continued until November.   It coincided
 with Mao's decision to press on rapidly with the formation
 of agricultural cooperatives.   Several articles in the
 press implied that Liang had opposed the collectivization
 of agriculture, and that his defense of peasant welfare
 had led him to oppose the Five-Year Plan with its strong
 emphasis on heavy industry.
 Early in 1955, party theorist Ai Ssu-chi again ap-
 parently failed to get the line, just as he and Chou Yang
 had slipped up earlier.  Ai's first article on Hu Shih,
 appearing in Study, was evidently milder than the party
 leadership desired.  An abridged and entirely rewritten
 version of it appeared in People's Daily later in January.
 In the first version of Ails article, 3f was not explicit-
 ly denied that there was some good mixed with the "poison"
 of Hu Shih's ideas; in the second version, it was explicit-
 ly denied.
 The Hu Feng Case, 1955
 In late 1954, the propaganda department's orthodox
 and hard line leadership also started an attack against Com-
 munist party members who still dared to think for themselves.
 Independent,  "subjective-minded," pro-Marxist writer Hu Feng
 was the chief target of this attack.
 Hu Feng had been fairly well known in Communist liter-
 .,try circles as a critic and poet, and as a friend and dis-
 ciple of China's leading leftist figure in modern litera-
 ture, Lu Hsun (d. 1936).   His prestige in Communist liter-
 ary circles rivaled that of Chou Yang.   Unlike Chou Yang,
 Hu apparently could not endure servile subjection to a
 party line.   As early as 1945, his relations with other
 CCP literary leaders in Chungking--Feng Hsueh-feng and
 Mao Tun--were strained.   In 1945, his defense of an article
 on Subjectivism resulted in a reprimand from Hu Chiao-mu,
 who   ogeTherwwith other Yeran-trained writers, apparently
 has for many years insisted on an essentially Stalinist
 interpretation of the general political and artistic

 Feng noted in 1949 that the writers in Peiping "seemed to
 be carrying cangues" /57 cangue is a kind of portable wooden
 collar once used in punishing criminals in Chin7.
 One reason for the sharpness of CCP attacks on Hu Fong
 probably was his skill in disseminating anti-Maoist views
 under the cloak of orthodoxy.   In August 1950 he wrote to
 a Shanghai friend, advising him not to display dissatis-
 faction with the regime's literary policy in letters to
 the press, but to contribute short articles, putting for-
 ward complaints between the lines.   In June 1952, when
 Hu sought to avoid a showdown with Chou Yang on the lat-
 ter's "mechanical" interpretation of Mao's directives, he
 advised his friend as follows:
 No matter what kind of policy, either soft or hard,
 Ku I (Chou Yang) adopts,,we must use a hard-inside-
 and-soft-outside attitude toward him.
 Hu apparently believed that a more liberal interpre-
 tation of Mao's 1942 Speech should have been made by the
 CCP's Yenan-trained literary authorities, and had informed
 one of his colleagues that the Speech had been made a
 "primitive totem."  Hu wrote:  !'The question is not the
 effect of the Speech itself, it is the way in which incom-
 petent people handle the matter."
 Starting in 1952,  several of Hu's friends and dis-
 ciples left his small group and publicly confessed their
 opposition to the propaganda department's literary line.
 But Hu, himself, in 1954, rose in party literary circles.
 "Still regarded as a progressive writer" he became one of
 the directors of People's Literature, an important party
 paper.   Three of his disciples were employed by important
 Shanghai literary publishers.   With this support, in April
 1954 he prepared to "attack" Chou Yang and Fegg Hsueh-
 feng; the latter was at that time the editor of Literature.
 He sent an outline of a "memorial"--which he waspreparing
 for presentation to the party's central committee--to
 friends in Peiping, Shanghai, and Nanking.
 Not understanding the true nature of Chou Yang's sup-
 port in the central committee, in July 1954, Hu sent the
 300,000-word "memorial" to the party central committee ap-
 pealing for the removal of the "five daggers" which, he
 complained, literary dictatorship was thrusting into the
 brains of writers.   These were that (1) writers must have

 a Communist world-view,  (2) must submit to thought-re-
 molding,  (3) must "penetrate" the lives of workers, peas-
 ants, and soldiers,  (4) must produce work of prescribed
 national form, and (5) must treat only topics declared
 to be of great significance.   He boldly suggested to the
 central committee a plan of reform, in which he proposed
 that writers,  instead of being indoctrinated by compul-
 sion, should "be allowed to decide on their own schedule
 of studies," that the official literary papers should be
 replaced by popular journals edited by established writers
 with diverse views, and that the Chinese Writers'Union
 should be abolished.
 In effect, Hu called for steps to eliminate the par-
 ty's "leadership" in literature and art--that is, to elimi-
 nate Chou Yang's control.  Hu clearly attempted to isolate
 Chou from central committee support, noting in his memorial
 that "sectarian rule" was destroying the arts.
 It is probable that Hu Feng was marked down for destruc-
 tion by the party's top leadership after it received hip Ju-
 ly 1954 memorandum.   The party member whom he had attacked--
 Chou Yang--was to be his executioner.   At "struggle" meet-
 ings held in November and December 1954, Hu Feng was encour-
 aged by Chou to express his real views further.  Chou's call
 for "free discussion" was supported by Kuo Mo-jo, who noted,
 however, that all criticism must be "constructive." Hu Feng
 apparently misinterpreted these and previous statements, and
 delivered strong attacks on Chou Yang and the People's Daily.
 The top party leadership apparently Y                            believed that Hula
 opposition to the CCP could be demonstrated to other intel-
 lectuals if Hu could be led to speak out.   Hu's memorial to
 the central committee was printed as a separate pamphlet of
 more than 200 pages, and free copies were disseminated to-
 gether with Literature. His attacks against Chou Yang and
 the People's Daily were also published in Literature.
 After Chou Yang's 8 December attack on Hu Feng, the lat-
 ter was compelled to express his agreement with Chou's views.
 But Hu apparently did not submit completely, and this led
 to stern action against him.   In early February 1955,  the
 Chinese Writers Union formally condemned him; on 15 March,
 Mao Tun, who had been reappointed minister of culture the
 previous September, called for the "launching of a general
 campaign against Hu Feng."

 A writer in People's China has claimed that during
 this period, Hu and His followers "were still treated as
 being within the ranks of the people," but that after a
 colleague of Hu's on 13 May made public 34 secret letters
 written to him by Hu, it became clear that:
 These were no friends of the revolution, no literary
 clique, but a gang of counterrevolutionaries operat-
 ing within the ranks of the revolutionary people, car-
 rying on a double-faced intrigue under the disguise of
 progressive writers.
 On 25 May 1955, Chou Yang branded Hu and his group as "pre-
 tended revolutionaries who had made their way into the par-
 ty, the army, the government offices, and social organiza-
 tions."   Hu was deprived of all his posts, expelled from
 the party's literary organizations, and arrested.
 Hu apparently has continued to refuse to submit com-
 pletely.   In September 1956, Kuo Mo-jo stated that Hu might
 be released from prison "if--and it is a very big if--Hu
 Feng confesses his crimes and shows signs of improvement."
 The destruction of Hu Feng was clearly a feather in
 the cap of Chou Yang.   It may also have been a triumph for
 the head of the propaganda department, Lu Ting-i, as Chou's
 presumed director.   Both men are the Yenan-trained inter-
 preters of Mao's literary line.  Their success wrecked the
 attempt to officialize a new, more liberal interpretation
 of Mao's 1942 literary directives.
 The Hu Feng campaign was primarily intended to warn
 intellectuals against questioning the necessity of the
 CCP's total control of the arts.  However,  there may have
 been some sentiment even in the party's central committee
 for a liberalization of creative work.  In sending his
 memorial to the central committee and later attacking Chou
 Yang and the People's Daily, Hu Feng apparently acted on
 his belief that he and   s friends would be supported by
 some central committee members.  An editorial in a June
 1955 issue of the People's Daily complained that support-
 ers of Hu :
 have also infiltrated the Chinese Communist
 party, with some taking up posts of consider-
 able importance.  This group of "Communist
 party members" are loyal to the counterrevo-
 lutionary Hu Feng but are deceitful toward
 the party,

 The People's Daily has denied that any sympathy for
 Hu has existed on  He central committee level, and in fact
 no central committee member has 3;een pilloried in connec-
 tion with Hu's case.   While the People's Dail 's assertion
 need not be accepted at face value,     seems  a r to con-
 clude that no central committee member was active on Hu's
 behalf.   When Chou Yang directed the attack of the party
 nucleus in the Chinese Writers' Union against "rightists"
 during the summer of 1957, his victims were the political-
 ly unimportant writers Chen Chi-hsia, Frng Hsueh-feng and
 Ting Ling.  Madame Ting had headed the literature bureau
 in party central committee's propaganda department, but
 she was not a member of the central committee.
 In the wake of the Hu Feng case, party journals
 warned during the summer and fall of 1955 against the
 dange' of pollution of the party, particularly by unre-
 liable intellectuals.   In June 1955, the People's Daily
 observed mildly that "more than 90 percent"     party mem-
 bers were of "good character."  But this meant that almost
 10 percent of CCP members were not so regarded, and that in
 this respect the party, after four years of "reorganization,"
 was in effect back where it started.
 People's Daily in July used the Hu Feng case to demon-
 strate the need for "further purifying" the party.  Later
 in July, a writer on party affairs for Study, the party's
 journal of theory, criticized superficia   nvestigation of
 applicants for party membership, asserting that the princi-
 pal weakness of such investigations was an emphasis on "pro-
 fessional ability" instead of "virtue," i.e., an emphasis
 on intellectual skills rather than on political reliability.
 People's Dail  in August editorialized on the need for care-
 TO investigation even of "old party members."  Then in No-
 vember 1955, An Tzu-wen, director of the party's organiza-
 tion department and a man  to be feared, called for a "ruth-
 less struggle" against class enemies and fir a purge of "in-
 corrigibly hostile" elements from the party.
 By late 1955 the CCP leadership had badly frightened
 the intellectuals and had almost certainly reduced their
 ability and inclination to perform useful work.   It had
 also fortified the existing barriers against their joining
 the party in significant members.

 Chou En-lai's "Soft" Line, January 1956
 On 14 January 1956, premier Chou En-lai made a long
 speech to the party central commi':tee and more than 1,100
 other party members occupying key posts throughout China,
 devoted entirely to "questions concerning the intellec-
 tuals."  That Chou's line was to be the party's policy
 was made clear in Peiping's further notation that it was
 given "full support" by some 90 speakers during the week-
 long meeting and was endorsed by Mao Tse-tung on the last
 day.
 The line introduced by Chou in the January 1956 meet-
 ing was the nearest thing to a "soft" line on the question
 of intellectuals which had ever been taken by a top party
 leader.   Chou seemed to be the right man to introduce such
 a line.   As premier, operating the government for which al-
 most all of the intellectuals worked and which had ambitious
 plans for them, Chou had the most direct interest in exploit-
 ing their technical skills.   Moreover, Chou, who, as Commu-
 nists go, is an intelligent and cultivated man with some
 appreciation of the arts, had apparently been viewed by
 many intellectuals as more sympathetic to their cause than
 other party leaders.  Chou's previous statements about the
 intellectuals, especially those of September 1954, had sug-
 gested that there might be some merit in that view--that is,
 that Chou was less inclined to harry the intellectuals than
 were party organizers and ideologists such Liu Shao-chi.
 Chou's line did not in any way represent a retreat
 from Communist dogma.  Most of the intellectuals who read
 his speech probably realized, and the others should have re-
 alized, that Chou was not proposing that any intellectual
 be permitted to function as a free intelligence.   What he
 was proposing, in considerable detail, was better treatment
 of those intellectuals who were willing to work within    e
 limits of Communist dogma--  a  is,  who would not c a  enge
 Communist party control of the state or the basic program
 of the party.
 Chou stated, in opening his speech at the January meet-
 ing, that the meeting aimed at strengthening party "leader-
 ship" over the intellectuals and the "entire work" of science
 and culture, with a view to enlisting the intellectuals for
 the enormous tasks facing the regime.   Chou stated the par-
 ty's effort in terms of a struggle against "rightist con-
 servatism," in accordarce with the "proposal" of Mao Tse-
 tung.   Choti cited, among other things, the decision (which

 was Mao's) greatly to increase the rate of socialization
 of agriculture.   Thus, those who were hostile to the par-
 ty's effort to get maximum mileage out of the intellectuals
 were placed immediately in the position of being "rightist
 conservatives" opposed to Mao Tse-tung--a position no par-
 ty member in his right mind would willingly occupy.   Chou
 further remarked--which turned out to be incorrect--that
 "opposition to rightist conservatism" would be the theme
 of the party's eighth congress later in 1956.
 Chou reviewed the types of contribution to the re-
 gime's cause which the intellectuals were capable of mak-
 ing, and said, as he had in 1954,  that they "have become
 important elements in all aspects of life in our country."
 Chou stated the "fundamental problem" as being that the in-
 tellectuals were inadequate, for the regime's purposes, in
 number, in skills, and in ideology. He then declared that
 the   eevelopment of the intellectuals--presumably in all
 three respects--was being obstructed by "certain unreasona-
 ble" practices on the part of party members.
 Chou described "most" of the intellectuals as having
 become a "component of the working class," a departure from
 the previous view--expressed by Mao and others--that they
 were to be regarded generally as a part of the petty bour-
 geoisie.  Chou then made a plea for recognition of their
 general reliability, much as he had in 1954.   He asserted
 that about 40 percent of the "high-level intellectuals"
 (estimated by him as about 100,000 persons) strongly sup-
 ported the Chinese Communist party and the Peiping regime,
 another 40 percent supported the party and regime but lacked
 fervor, and only 20 percent fell in the categories of "back-
 ward" or "undesirable."  This description of the intellec-
 tuals--as 80 percent reliable--was in sharp contrast to
 statements by other party leaders in 1957 after the nasty
 surprise of the intellectuals' response to the "hundred
 flowers" campaign.
 Chou went on to criticize those who underestimated the
 ideological progress of the intellectuals and their impor-
 tance to the socialist cause.  He derided those who reasoned
 that intellectuals were not "a component of the working class...
 since work in production is performed by workers and techni-
 cal guidance may be provided by Soviet experts."  Chou  de-
 clared his opposition also to any tendency toward "one-sided
 conciliation" of intellectuals, but his heavy fire was di-
 rected against the anti-intellectuals.

 Chou proposed a number of practical measures to im-
 prove the lot of the intellectuals.   He mentioned first the
 need to assign intellectuals properly, i.e., to their fields
 of specialization, to avoid  the waste of the most pre-
 cious property of the state."                   He asked that the intel-
 lectuals be given "our confidence and support, which
 they deserve."  Chou called for the biographical back-
 ground of intellectuals to be  "correctly evaluated...so
 as to release a number of them from prolonged, unjustified
 suspicion....Only a small number of them are politically
 questionable."  Chou further asked that nonparty intel-
 lectuals not only be given important posts but be per-
 mitted to exercise genuine power.  Further, Chou said,
 there should be an improvement in the working conditions
 of intellectuals (in particular, freeing them from profit-
 less conferences and administrative matters), and an im-
 provement as well in their living conditions, such as
 better housing and pay and faster promotion.
 Chou  went on to ask the party to help the intellec-
 tuals in their "self-reform."   He called for the purge
 of the "very small percentage of counterrevolutionary and
 other bad elements" among the intellectuals, and for con-
 tinued criticism of "the few" who oppose or misunderstand
 socialism.   In a gesture which must have been particularly
 welcome to the intellectuals,  Chou said that the struggle
 against counterrevolution in China "must not involve" those
 whose relationship with counterrevolutionaries had been or
 remained "merely social."  In sum, Chou said, the party
 would work to "reform the backward," to "educate the neu-
 tral...to become progressive," and to make the progressive
 into "red specialists."   (This latter phrase is similar to
 the formulation--"red and expert"--later used by Liu Shao-
 chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, and means "politically reliable
 and technically proficient."  Liu and Teng on one hand,
 and Chou on the other, have been united in this objective,
 but there have been possibly important differences in their
 views of the party's progress toward it.)
 Chou admitted that the party in the past few years--
 meaning, probably, since 1951--had "very rarely" admitted
 intellectuals, and described this policy as "closed-door-
 ism."  Chou said that "we"--presumably the party leader-
 ship--now (January 1956) think it "proper" to admit one
 third of the high-level intellectuals,  i.e.,  about 35,000
 of them, to the party by 1962.

 Only in the concluding portion of his speech did Chou
 make clear the compelling reason for the new emphasis in
 the party's line on intellectuals.   It was the Peiping re-
 gime's "backwardness" in modern science, as contrasted with
 the rest of the world's rapid advance.   Chou said that the
 regime "must try to catch up,...must make our greatest effort
 to win this race," in order to be victorious over the West
 "both in peaceful competition and  aggressive wars. .,."?
 Chou derided Peiping's practice of sending high-school grad-
 uates to the USSR rather than scientists for advanced train-
 ing, remarking that under this policy Peiping would never
 he able to improve its position of "dependence and appren-
 ticeship."  Chou called for certain other improvements, such
 as inviting bloc scientists to establish research organs in
 Peiping, training Chinese under Soviet scientific and tech-
 nical personnel then in China, assigning outstanding Chinese
 scientists and students to the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
 formulation of a national plan for scientific research, and
 so on.
 Chou concluded his speech b: proposing   a division of
 labor with respect to the various tasks outlined in his
 speech.   "Administrative" questions concerning intellectuals
 would be handled by a Specialists' Pureau under Chou's State
 Council (cabinet).   (This bureau was soon set up, under a
 protegd of Chou's, Chi Yen-ming.) The handling--by the gov-
 ernment departments concerned--of questions of a "political"
 character, and questions related to ideological reform and
 disposition of counterrevolutionaries, would be "supervised"
 by the party's propaganda department, which all along had
 had the largest  role in indoctrinating intellectuals.  The
 work of admitting intellectuals to the party would be handled
 by the party's organization department, in coordination with
 the propaganda department.   The party, rather than the gov-
 ernment, would thus continue to have the final word on the
 question of the reliability of the intellectuals.
 It seems very probable, in view of Chou's position in
 the government, his own character, and his previous state-
 ments,  that the line taken in Chou's speech was one which
 he personally approved.   Whether he, or instead Mao Tse-tung,
 first broached the matter to the party's  other top leaders, is un-
 certain.   The confident tone and the willingness to take a
 chance were equally features of Mao's decision on agricultur-
 al socialization a few months earlier.   It is fair to assume,
 it a minimun,.that Mao approved of'the new line.   It cannot
 be assumed,.however, that other party leaders at this level
 approved of it, and both the previous records and subsequent

 actions of some of them suggest that they were reluctant
 to see even this much of "liberalization."  The other key
 figures in the politburo's inner core, where the policy
 would probably have been originated for submission to the
 full politburo, were Liu Shao-chi and Chen Yun, and, pro-
 bably, Teng Hsiao-ping, although Teng was not revealed to
 be a member of this elite body--then called the secretariat,
 now called the standing committee--until September 1956.
 Chen Yun, as Chou's senior deputy premier and close asso-
 ciate, would probably have stood willingly with Mao and
 Chou.   However, Liu and Teng, as directors of the party's
 organizational and ideological work, were (and remain) re-
 sponsible for the party's purity; and Liu directly, and Teng
 indirectly, had previously indicated their sensitivity to
 the potential of the intellectuals for polluting the prole-
 tariat's vessel.   Neither Liu nor Teng had major responsi-
 bilities in the government, and neither could be expected
 to be as sensitive to Chou's problems as Chou was.  The
 reservations of Liu and Teng, at this early stage, may have
 been expressed to Mao and Chou in some such form as this:
 'We don't have as much confidence in the intellectuals as
 you do, and we don't think that the new line will be as pro-
 ductive as you do, but it may work if it's handled very care-
 fully.'   In any case, Chou Nn-lai became personally identified
 with the new line.
 The propaganda department's suppo"'t for Chou's line was
 prompt. The PPeeop_l~ee''s~ Daily the next day published an article
 by a Peking University phis losophy professor in which ho noted
 that "the very great majority" of intellectuals are receptive
 to party leadership.   People's Daily then published a Tsinghua
 University professor's assurance that the intelligentsia's
 ideological reform had been "tremendous" since 1949.  Other
 professors submitted similar articles in subsequent January
 and February issues.
 Articles in other publications stressed the need to im-
 prove party-intelligentsia working relations, and, in so do-
 ing, pushed the question of political reliability into the
 background.  A writer in the 3 February issue of one of the
 regime's major economic journals, New Construction, asserted
 that since "all" specialists and scholars suppor  the CCP
 "wholeheartedly," their problem now is "how to gain party
 help and guidance in their profession."  He stressed the need
 for each specilaist.and scholar to improve himself in his pro-
 fession "along his own line," which means, he stated, "the
 blooming of all flowers."

 Anticipating opposition in lower party ranks to
 Chou's progra; the propaganda department attacked young
 zealotG for advocating total ideological conformity.  A
 writer in China Youth criticized young Communist party
 members for    avin placed "one-sided" stress on reforming
 veteran professors, neglecting methods which might be used
 to "develop the professors' special talents and learn from
 them."  They were advised that in combating idealism "vet-
 eran professors should not be regarded as targets of criti-
 cism and reform."
 Complaints were made against Youth League members who
 baited scientists at Peking University.   A writer in China
 Youth complained that there prevailed at the university ' a
 sor   of 'public opinion,' under the pressure of which young
 instructors are afraid of being condemned as 'individualis-
 tic'or 'ignoring politics."  Consequently,  they hesitate
 "to engage wholeheartedly in their research work."  The
 writer noted that although the university's president had,
 following Chou En-lei's speech, launched a campaign to en-
 able instructors and students to pursue their studies with-
 out intimidation, some League cadres--who were wont to quote
 Stalin's dictum that "A scientist must also be an active poli-
 tician"--persisted in stressing politics.
 Mao Inaugurates "Liberalization," Spring 1956
 The Mao-Chou policy of gaining the confidence of the
 intelligentsia by relieving it of fears of political perse-
 cution was reflected in Peiping's t3.atment of the de-Stalini-
 zation issue.  On April 1956, the People's Daily printed an
 editorial,  "On the Historical Experience oof'-the- Dictatorship
 of the Proletariat," which expressed the views of an enlarged
 meeting of the politburo.   The editorial, critical of the So-
 viet handling of de-Stalinization, attempted in part to show
 that the CCP had not been guilty of "Stalinist" mistakes after
 Mao Tse-tung became its dominant figure in 1935.   It stated
 that a major mistake in the CCP's early years had resulted
 from a crude application, by dogmatists, of Stalin's dictum
 that middle-of-the-road forces must be smashed.    In conse-
 quence,  "instead of isolating the real enemy we had iso-
 lated ourselves."
 The point was made that the middle-of-the-
 road forces which the party had erroneously attacked were the
 national bourgeoisie and the democratic parties--the groups
 which represent the majority of China's intellectuals.
 The editorial apparently was intended in part to be
 viewed as another sign of the party's willingness to permit

 a sector of intellectual life to go on without the degree
 of interference which had characterized Stalin's leader-
 ship of the USSR.   It contained passages which seemed de-
 signed to encourage the intelligentsia to believe that the
 regime should be viewed as authoritarian but not totalitar-
 ian.   That is, it was to be viewed as a dictatorship which
 could not hope for total standardization of thought "among
 the people" because contradictions would continue to exist
 "between idealism and materialism in a socialist and even
 a Communist society...; there will still be people with
 comparatively correct thinking and others with comparatively
 incorrect thinking."
 Mao's hand can be detected in the cited #tatement.   It
 is a new gloss in Marxist-Leninist philosophy, explicitly
 denying the perfectibility of human nature which had been
 implicit in Soviet doctrine on the Communist state of the
 future.   (This gloss and the editorial's statement that "the
 existence of contradictions between the individual and the
 collective in a Socialist society is nothing strange"  ap-
 parently were viewed as unorthodox by Soviet leaders.                                They
 were omitted from Pravda's 7 April reprint of the editorial.)
 The repudiation of-'h Soviet view provided Mao and the party
 leadership with a basis for a "soft" policy toward expres-
 sions of idealism--a policy which was designed gradually to
 cure a long-lasting disease rather than forcibly to extirpate
 a counterrevolutionary ideology.   Intellectuals apparently
 were expected to infer that if an absolute harmony of views
 was held by the politburo to be inconceivable even for the

 less likely to exist in present-day China.
 On 2 May in an unpublished speech, Mao took another
 step along the "soft" line, calling on the party and govern-
 ment to relax the rigid structures under which intellectuals
 had been working in the arts and sciences.   He sloganized
 the new line in an eight-character couplet--"let all the flow-
 ers bloom, let various schools of thought contend."  The cou-
 plet was written in the classical style to evoke enthusiasm
 among intellectuals, and had a-n emotional power which Chou En-
 lai's more restrained and precise statements of January did
 not have.   Mao's speech inaugurated "liberalization," whereas
 Chou's had simply promised better treatment to docile intel-
 lectuals.

 job of selling the Chou line to the intellectuals,  it does

 not seem to have promoted a new atmosphere of greater in-
 tellectual freedom until Mao personally demanded it.   Mao
 emerged again in the eyes of the populace and the party
 rank and file as the bold pioneer who had conquered a new
 frontier of policy.
 Propaganda chief Lu Ting-i, addressing a gathering of
 Communist party members, natural and social scientists,
 doctors, writers, and artists on 26 May, told his audience
 that his speech would express "my personal understanding"
 of the CCP's policy toward work in the sciences and the
 arts.  This speech was, however, almost certainly an au-
 thorized explication of Mao's 2 May speech, and may be
 read almost as a published version of Mao's speech.
 Lu's speech was generally in line with Chou's, calling
 for better treatment of intellectuals within the limits of
 Communist dogma.   However, Lu implied that the definition o  o   cia   thought should be enlarged to protect many in-
 tellectuals with independent ideas.   He attempted to make
 clear that the CCP was now authorizing and encouraging the
 expression of divergent views.  He noted that the arts could
 not advance "if there is 'only one flower in bloom'" and that
 China's history had shown "stagnation" in the sciences'to
 be the result of repressed discussion.
 Lu went on to provide a shelter for intellectuals with
 independent--but not antiparty--ideas by introducing Mao's
 1949* ideological formu a:  "freedom within the ranks of the
 people."  He advocated "broadening" this freedom to the
 point where it would include permission for intellectuals
 to "publicize idealism."  He noted, in line with the 5
 April People's Daily editorial on de-Stalinization, but more
 liberaly than Chou,  that as realists Communists recognize
 that the contradiction between materialism and idealism
 will remain in the "Socialist and the Communist society" and
 that ideological struggle among the "people" must be "rigid-
 ly distinguished" from tb,3 struggle against counterrevolu-
 tionaries.    He stated that any attempt to solve the struggle
 *In On the People's Democratic Dictatorship (July 1949),
 Mao promised freedom tq those within the 'ran s of the people,"
 i.e., workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bour-
 geoisie.  The last two groups have an "idealise" world-view,
 however, which should be dispelled by thought remolding.

 between backward idealism and progressive materialism with
 "administrative orders" cannot be effective.  Only through
 "open debates" can materialism "gradually" overcome idealism.
 Lu assured prospective opponents and die-hards in the
 party that the CCP was acting from a position of strength
 in urging adoption of the "hundred flowers" policy.  He
 cited four conditions which guaranteed the policy's suc-
 cess:                       (1) the "decisive victory" of socialization, (2)
 the "fundamental change" in the political thought of in-
 tellectuals, (3) the "great weakening" of enemies, and
 (4) the "great strengthening" of official thought.  It
 reflected an optimism similar to that expressed by Chou,
 when he asserted in January  that "most" of the intel-
 lectuals were politically reliable.
 Enlarging upon the definition of official thought,
 Lu introduced a new element in party-intelligentsia rela-
 tions.  This was an apparent intention to stop forcing
 scientists to write confessions against their professional
 convictions and to allow them to reply to criticisms o
 their ideas on academic matters without f c:r of being in-
 timidated into silence by "the method of administrative
 order." The general principle that the minoz- ty must fol-
 low the majority must no longer be applied in nonpolitical,
 scientific debates, Lu noted.
 The minority who believe in something different
 should be alloweu to retain their own views, and
 the principle of making the minority yield to the
 majority must not be enforced.  After due criticism
 and discussion, those who make mistakes on academic
 problems must not be forced to write articles to
 review their mistakes if they themselves are not
 willing.   In academic circles, if a different view
 is brought up after a certain academic problem has
 been closed, such a view should still be allowed
 to be discussed.
 Lu's conclusion is thus that all honest workers in the arts
 and sciences should be free from attack.
 In a brief passage Lu jade it clear, however, that in
 liberalizing criticism and in relaxing the tight controls
 on intellectuals, the party leadership would not permit
 freedom in political matters.  Hu Shih (now free in the
 United States) and Hu Feng (now in jail in Communist China)
 were criticized for being counterrevolutionary in politics

 as well as idealistic in ideology.   The criterion for dis-
 tinguishing between apolitical idealist who is counter-
 revolutionary and an idealist who is "within the ranks of
 the people" would thus continue to be general support of
 the party's policies.  Lu reminded nonparty intellectuals,
 quoting from Chou En-lai's January speech, that cooperation
 is a two-way street and that an attitude of reservation
 toward socialism would work against the new policy.
 Lu gave a practical reason for the party's call for
 "blossoming" in literature and art and for "contention" in
 science.  The CCP hoped to enrich China's art and enable
 scientists to "catch up" with advanced world levels.  The
 new policy was, moreover, "an important guarantee" for the
 successful formulation and implementation of 12-year plans
 in natural science and the humanities.
 Lu's effort to expand the definition of official thought
 and provide a free market of ideas in the arts and sciences
 apparently necessitated an innovation in Marxist-Leninist
 doctrine.  Like Stalin, he called for free discussion in
 science.  He departed from the views of Stalin and the pr w-
 ent Soviet leadership, however, in explicitly denying that
 natural science has a class character.       is a new corcept
 which, according to Lu, the CCP had "groped out" in the
 course of struggle.
 Natural sciences including medicine have no class
 character.  They have their own laws of develop-
 ment....It is erroneous to put class labels such
 as "feudal," ?"capitalist," "socialist," "pro-
 letarian," or "bourgeois" on certain medical
 theories or theories in biology or other natural
 scieuces....We must never believe this fallacy.
 Some people fall for it because of their sectarian
 views.   Some fall for it because they want to stress
 the need of learning advanced Soviet science.
 Lu's remark that the natural sciences have their "own laws
 of development" apparently was intended to imply that even
 the CCP may not be able to foresee which scientific theory
 will prove right and which wrong.   Accordingly, scientists
 were free to advance all academically feasible theories
 or techniques, even those of capitalist states, for Lu
 also made a clear distinction between the "reactionary sys-
 tems" of capitalist states and "what is valuable in their
 management, science, and technology."

 Turning to literature and art, Lu stated briefly that
 the CCP considered socialist realism as the best "but by
 no means the only" method of creation.  He asserted that
 the party had laid down "no restriction" on subjects to
 write about because "puritanical rules" would only lead
 to suffocation of artistic work and the emergence of
 formalism and vulgarity.  The only new element in Lu's
 approach to the arts appeared to be that of permitting
 descriptions of "bad" people and heretical views--pre-
 viously such descriptions were taken as a sign of im-
 plicit opposition to the party--in order to contrast
 these with "good" people and correct views.
 Lu coupled his doctrinal rationale for liberalization
 with a practical one, complaining that sharp criticism of
 specialists had "frightened them" and hampered their work.
 He directed party specialists to listen to the criticism
 of nonparty experts and told them to devote more time to
 "study."  He was sympathetic to the view of a -scientist
 who had written to him, requesting that incompetent re-
 searchers be prevented from using the term "idealistic" as
 a club to shatter demands for careful, experimentally
 verifiable research.
 Lu proposed that the form of criticism be changed from
 attempting to "kill with one blow" (reserved exclusively for
 counterrevolutionaries) to comradely advice.
 It is common for good men to make mistakes. Nobody
 in the world can be completely free from mistakes.
 Such mistakes must be rigidly distinguished from
 counterrevolutionary statements.  Criticism of
 such mistakes should be well-intentioned, calm,
 and cool-headed; reasoning should take the whole
 matter into consideration and criticism should
 proceed only from unity with a view to reaching
 unity.
 Lu was advocating a corrective method, free from the
 Stalinist compulsion to shoot political opponents or dis-
 honor their names.   Implying falsely that Mao Tse-tung had
 always been' a lenient confessor of misguided comrades, Lu
 recommended as models the mild criticism which Mao had
 directed against Chen Shao-yu and Po Ku in the early 1940's
 and which the CCP politburo had directed against "Comrade
 Stalin...who had more merits than mistakes" in April 1956.
 This form of criticism was "neither overdone nor undercooked"

 and was designed to "benefit many people."  Applied to in-
 tellectuals "who work honestly," tolerance should be basic
 in the party's approach, for it is "impossible" to carry
 out "creative work without committing mistakes."
 In sum, Lu's speech was in line with Mao's desire to
 fire the imagination of intellectuals and commit them
 emotionally to the party's goals; and it was in line with
 Chou En-lai's promise of better treatment of those intel-
 lectuals who were willing to work within the limits of
 party control.   It went beyond Chou's speech in providing
 a doctrinal basis for a relaxation of party -ontrol over
 theories and thinkers in the natural sciences.  It seems
 clear that, in May 1956, Mao was convinced that Chou's
 speech had been merely a first step which had not re-
 sulted in the desired momentum for gaining the allegiance
 of intellectuals.
 Uncertainty About "Liberalization,', June 1956 - February 1957
 Lu Ting-i had called for free discussion and had implied
 that even the party might not be able to distinguish a right
 theory in science from a wrong one--a view which led some in-
 tellectuals to probe the limits of free discussion.  The first
 response of regime spokes.-"en to this probing was to give Lu's
 speech a conservative twist.
 "Liberalization" speeches made at the National People's
 Congress in June 1956 were sprinkled with reminders of the
 party's mon'.poly of power.   In a speech published in the
 People's Dail ix,  Kuo Mo-jo told the congress that the party's
 policy was to improve ideological studies and to promote
 "correct contention," defining contention as "socialist"
 competition.   Socialist competition had been demanded dur-
 ing the Hu Feng camps gn and intellectuals could hardly
 avoid the inference that the "contention" which Kuo now
 desired in the name of the party was the same protective
 mimicry which had repressed independent thinkers in previous
 years.
 There is some evidence that the propaganda department
 itself was unsure of the limits of liberalization, trying
 out various definitions of "contending" in an effort to
 establish a formula which wotild not again alienate the in-
 telligentsia.   In the 14 July issue of People's Daily,  the
 minister of culture defended Kuo Mo-jo's conservative inter-
 pretation of Lu Ting-i's speech.  He attacked "fanciful"
 schools of thought--such as one scholar's view that the

 ancient-period Chinese philosopher Mo Tzu was not Chinese
 but Indian--which contradict "publicly recognized con-
 clusions."                           He declared that Kuo's demand for "correct
 contention" did not restrict the party's new policy.
 However, a writer in the same issue of People's Daily op-
 posed the hard interpretation, describing uo s demand
 for correct contention and intensified indoctrination as
 "irrelevant talk."  He sought to strengthen his argument
 by citing Lu's promise of freedom to publicize idealism.
 Since the articles were juxtaposed on the same page,
 it appeared that the propaganda department was seeking
 to gauge the reaction to both views and later make a
 final ruling.
 The propaganda department apparently decided in
 late July to use a soft interpretation of Lu Ting-i's
 speech.  An editorial in the People's Daily on 21 July
 ruled that there always will be an   ncorrect element"
 in correct contention and that proponents of different
 views need not play the same tune like instruments in
 an orchestra, but should be permitted to create their
 own tunes, provided that their "music is not counter-
 revolutioi,ary."                   Permission to "doubt or criticize Marxist
 dialectics" was granted.  Apparently only political criti-
 cism of the regime was ruled out.
 The soft interpretation prevailed after the 21 July
 editorial had set the tone.  There were few indications,
 however, that intellectuals were being brought out of
 their demoralized state and up to a condition of high work-
 ing morale.
 The propaganda department's first significant experi-
 ment with its soft interpretation of Lu Ting-i's speech
 was linked to the CCP's effort to expose and reduce bureau-
 cratic practices in its ranks. Writing in the party's liter-
 ary journal--People's Literature--Communist party member Wang
 Meng in Septem er     6 described the loss of enthusiasm among
 old cadres--"who neither love nor hate, and are interested
 only in a good record"--and the shattered party-spirit of a
 young cadre, "whose way of thinking comes from Russian
 films; but real party life is different."  Wang's short
 story, A New Young Man Arrives at the Organization Depart-
 ment, was roughly similar to V. Du n sev s novelNot By
 Ire-ad
 Alone, the first installment of which was published
 in the USSIE  in August 1956, preceding New Young Man by
 one month.

 The use of fiction rather than the press to attack
 party shortcomings  was unique for the CCP.   There was
 more risk involved, for expressions of party defects in
 literature terd to indict not individuals but the entire
 party'"'environmefat. For example, Wang described bureaucratic
 habits and disillusionment among members of the organiza-
 tion department in a Peiping district party committee as
 follows:
 In the whole atmosphere there is something like
 dust in the air.  You can smell it but you can't
 lay hold of it....We /veterans7 created the new
 life but the new life does nol fire our imagina-
 tion.
 Received with enthusiasm in some quarters and with
 outraged criticism in others, the short story apparently
 stirred the "open" debate which the propaganda department
 had envisaged as a method of curing lethargy in party
 ranks.   Publication of readers' reactions, however, was
 postponed until the eighth party congress had been held
 in mid-September.
 Major speakers at the party congress underplayed
 and almost ignored the "hundred flowers" policy.
 In his brief reference to the policy in his report,
 Liu Shao-chi expressed support for it and agreed with
 Lu Ting-i's remark that the CCP should not rely on "admin-
 istrative orders" to exercise its leadership.   However,
 Liu stressed the need for long-term remolding of intel-
 lectuals from the ranks of the bourgeoisie.   Moreover,
 in calling for the party to enlist the services of exist-
 ing intellectuals while training a great number of its
 own, he warned of the danger that the bourgeois ideas
 of the intellectuals would "corrupt the ranks of the pro-
 letariat."  Unlike Chou En-lai, Liu did not encourage the
 recruitment of intellectuals for party membership, and,
 unlike Lu Ting-i, he left no room for criticism of Com-
 munist doctrine.
 The central committee resolution on Liu's report
 set forth the party's position.  The resolution stated
 that the party must "steadily carry out" the "hundred
 flowers" policy, and must "unite" with the intellectuals
 while educating and remolding them.

 A second major speaker at the congress was Teng
 Hsiao-ping, Liu's principal lieutenant for party affairs.
 Teng did not once mention the "hundred flowers" policy.
 Teng did call for the party to admit qualified intel-
 lectuals, but his emphasis throughout his report was on
 the need for careful selection and supervision of mem-
 bers.
 The third major speaker was Chou En-lai, whose ap-
 proach was less cautious than Liu's or Teng's.   Speaking
 at length of the regime's need for intellectuals, and
 endorsing the "hundred flowers" policy, Chou said noth-
 ing of the need for a long-term remolding of intellectuals.
 The Second Five-Year Plan proposal adopted by the
 congress reflected Chou's position primarily, just as
 the central committee resolution on Liu's report had re-
 flected Liu's primarily.  The FYP proposal, endorsing
 both the "hundred flowers" policy and the policy of "unit-
 ing, educating, and transforming" intellectuals, went on
 to state that they should be "encouraged to think inde-
 pendently and to discuss freely," and that they should
 receive better treatment in many ways from the regime.

 Peiping's response to the Hungarian developments and
 the Soviet-Yugoslav debate was to support Moscow in strong
 terms.   The qualifications which the CCP leadership at-
 tached to this support did not soften its attack on re-
 visionists.   The "hundred flowers" policy was lost in the
 mass of statements on the irreducible-elements in Marxist
 doctrine, and a conservative interpretation of the policy
 appeared to be dominant.  Peiping's long statement of 28
 December reaffirmed the Chinese Communist view that the
 "road to socialism"--for Peiping or any other Communist
 regime--necessitates essential fidelity to the Soviet
 model in constructing a new society, and a close alliance
 with the Soviet party and state.   It thus rejected key

 features of Yugoslav domestic and foreign policy and made
 clear to the Poles that the Chinese--while supporting Pol-
 ish freedom within the bloc--did not approve all features
 of Gomulka's liberalization program.
 While the need to support Moscow had forced China's
 version of de-Stalinization into the background, a pre-
 tense of free discussion was continued in connection with
 Wang Meng's short  story, New Young Man.   "Spontaneous"
 letters to the editor in the   cem er issue of Literary
 Studies (carefully screened by the propaganda department)
 apparently
 were meant to draw attention the party's
 desire
 to champion
 free discussion even after the Hungarian
 de-
 velopments.
 Some contributors favored the views of
 the
 shocked New
 Young Man, others denied that old cadres
 were
 degenerate.
 taut the "hundred flowers" policy was not extensively
 discussed until January--a time when the CCP was criti-
 cizing middle-school students for having "wrong thoughts"
 on intrabloc relations and university students for over-
 emphasizing "democracy and even individual freedom above
 collective interest."  A relatively unknown Communist
 playwright, Chen Chi-tung, and three colleagues called
 for a halt to liberalization in literature and drama.
 In an article in the 7 January 1957 issue of the People's
 Daily, Chen complained that in 1956 less and less men  on
 was made of writing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers--
 an attempt to invoke Mao's formula and authority--as well as
 Socialist realism in writing.   He was aware of the subtle
 attempt by some writers to discuss only realism, not So-
 cialism, or merely "realism of the Socialist era."  He
 noted that the charge of "formalism"--that is, stereotyped
 phrases and descriptions--was incorrectly used to oppose
 the use of literature to serve politics, and criticized
 short essays--an apparent attack on New Young.Man--which
 register "dissatisfaction and disillusionment."  He was
 firm in his demand for drama which is simultaneously new
 and Socialist.
 There are other indications that the propaganda de-
 partment had decided to advance a conservative interpre-
 tation of "hundred flowers."  Its theoretical journal
 Study cn 18 February 1957 printed an article by a lesser
 Communist writer flatly stating that:

 Whatever the ideology or standpoint, we absolutely
 cannot allow on our soil propaganda counter to
 Socialist construction.
 The writer- then declared that "A stand of patriotism
 and support of Socialism is the minimum requirement for
 letting all flowers bloom and all schools of thought
 contend."  His complaints clearly reflected the depart-
 ment's concern over liberal interpretations which, for
 example, led cinematography workers in Shanghai to re-
 ject Communists from their crews.  Thus, roughly one
 week before Mao Tse-tung gave his speech on contradic-
 tions, the propaganda department was stressing a con-
 servative interpretation of "hundred flowers."
 Mao Reaffirms a Liberal "Hundred Flowers ," Early 1957
 Mao Tse-tung's speeches of 27 February
 25X1
 and 12 March, to a meeting of the Supreme State Conference
 and to a national conference on propaganda work, were ap-
 25X1
 parently directed to the party as a whole, and were not
 concerned primarily with intellectuals.   However,
 Mao in these speeches reaffirmed his 25X1
 "hundred flowers" policy in unprecedentedly liberal terms.
 Mao apparently sought to impress on all party per-
 sonnel the need to handle popular grievances in such a
 way as to avoid exacerbating them.  Although Mao was
 aware that thousands of Hungarians had almost overnight
 been stirred to anti-Communist action, he apparently
 did not fear the development of large-scale opposition
 to his regime;                                           90        25X1
 percent of the Chinese people were favorably disposed
 to the CCP.  Mao's evident interest, similar to that
 of Chou En-lai a year earlier in proposing better treat-
 ment of docile intellectuals, was that of enlisting all
 available talent to speed the regime's very ambitious        25X1
 program of economic and scientific development; Mao
 said just that in the February speech.         25X1

 fundamental--exists between the leaders and the populace
 in a Socialist state.   Taking their cue from Zhdanov's

 the class struggle as society's motive force,  Soviet
 theorists had discussed contradictions in the USSR.  How-
 ever,                       their general descriptions avoided what Mao later
 made explicit:   that there is a leader-populace contradic-
 tion in Socialist countries.*
 The second original view was that the Communist party
 requires the constant stimulus of nonparty criticism--in-
 cluding even hostile criticism--to retain its alertness and
 strength.   The Soviet view has been and continues to be that
 the Communist party has sufficient inner resources to provide
 whatever rectification or self-criticism is necessary.
 Mao                          made the following points about   25X1
 the "hundred flowers" policy:that this }policy was not a luxu-
 ry but a necessity; that Marxism itself would profit from
 free discussions, as strong flowers cannot be grown in hot-
 houses;                       that views hostile to the Communist world view would
 not find a fertile soil in China; and that criticism of the
 "hundred flowers" policy was  shortsighted  and incorrect.
 Mao, on this last point, said that     25X1
 90 percent of the party's "high-ranking cadres" had opposed
 his introduction of the "hundred flowers" policy, but that
 he had insisted on it because he felt certain he was right.
 As it turned out, Mao considerably overestimated the regime's
 popular support, and those who had been doubtful of the poli-
 cy--or at least of Mao's presentation of it--were vindicated. 25X1
 No               report    that Mao, in either the February
 or the March speech, set  orth the criteria for acceptable
 criticism--which clearly prohibit free discussion--appearing 25X1
 in the official version of his speech published in June (and
 *Xhrus c ev s Apr     957 denial that this contradiction is
 present in the-Soviet Union indicates that the Soviet leaders
 preferred to have the regime's theorists treat Mao's remark
 with silence implying dissent.   The Soviet leaders have acted
 to prevent a Chinese monopoly over the discussion and interpre-
 tation of contradictions by repeating the views of Lenin and
 Stalin.   When in Kommunist (Nov 2, 1957) A. Sobblev finally at-
 tempted to put Soviet theorists straight on how to discuss Mao's
 theory, he stated that nonantagonistic contradictions existed in
 Socialist society between action of the people and "low-level"
 leadership on the part of "a number of organizations."  This
 watered-down statement is one to which Mao might now (in 1958)
 subscribe.

 Mao's speech appeared to represent an important change
 of emphasis in party policy.   Indeed, the propaganda depart-
 ment was so strongly committed to an opposite emphasis that
 as late as 28 February--one day after Mao's speech--the prop-
 aganda department of a provincial party committee in the
 Northeast "unanimously" supported the hard-line article by
 Chen Chi-tung which Mao had derided in his speech.   The pro-
 vincial committee found that Chen's article presented points
 of view "which were all correct."
 The propaganda department responded quickly to Mao's re-
 newed stress on liberalization.   Lu Ting-i's personal friend,
 Lin Mo-han, set a moderate tone for discussions of literary
 works which were critical of the party.   In an important ar-
 ticle in the 12 March issue of People's Daily, Lin, unlike
 other critics, presented a balanced crit queue of Wang Meng's
 A New Young Man Arrives at the Organization Department.   He
 attacked the crime, g   rrmputing evil mot ves to    the-author
 for his realistic view of party mistakes and complained that
 "dogmatism"--which was "still rampant"--contravened the "hun-
 dred flowers" policy and damaged the creative spirit of authors.
 On the other hand, he criticized the author for suggesting that
 the new life "itself" can corrode a party member, that isola-
 tion from the masses is a praiseworthy attitude, and that the
 old life may not be vanquished by the bright new life.
 Similarly, Chou Yang's ward, Minister of Culture Shen Yen-
 ping, in the 18 March People's Daily reassured party workers
 that the appearance of  weed'--   erature devoid of ideologi-
 cal character, or of bad character--should not cause consterna-
 tion.   He then attacked Mao's specific target, Chen Chi-tung,
 for being "worried and even terrified" for using dogmatic meth-
 ods of criticism and giving the wrong impression that the "hun-
 dred flowers" policy was harmful.                           Shen stated that Chen's ap-
 proach was dangerous, as "it splashes cold water in the face
 of intellectuals, who are inspired and animated by the policy
 on the hundred flowers and schools of thought."
 Shen then said that it is impractical to prevent writers
 from wresting until they are indoctrinated, that free discussion

 is "our" way of indoctrinating intellectuals in Marxism,
 since thought reform is a complex and "delicate" task.
 Shen's statement--which may have been worked out with
 Chou Yang--was in line with Mao's apparent belief that skill
 and tact must replace bullying methods in winning adherents
 to the party's program and official thought.
 Chinese Communist party leaders, aside from Mao and his
 spokesman of the propaganda department, remained silent about
 "contradictions" through the month of March.
 Confusion and Opposition in the Party, April 1957
 Throughout April, there were continuing indications of
 confusion about Mao's line on "contradictions," and of opposi-
 tion specifically to the "hundred flowers"  olic                 25X1
 the various vers ons of Mao's
 position were in conflict with patterns of thought and action
 established in the party for many years.
 Perhaps of most importance, there was no precedent for
 recognizing the existence of abiding conflicts of interest
 between the leaders and the led in a Socialist society.   The
 orthodox position was that there could be no such conflict
 between leaders and led, and that other conflicts in society
 were manifestations of an uncompleted class struggle, to by
 resolved by means appropriate to a struggle.   Those party
 leaders who had opposed Mao?'s line had presumably argued in
 this fashion.
 As a corollary, there was no precedent for encouraging
 significant criticism of the Communist world-view. "Criti-
 cism and self-criticism" had long been employed by the CCP,
 but in the Soviet form.   Liu Shao-chi had stated the ortho-
 dox view in 1942 in discussing "innerparty struggle":   this
 struggle is not an open debate aiming at the attainment of
 truth; the party already possesses the truth; the task of
 the struggle is to bring into the open tendencies in the par-
 ty which run counter to the truth, and to  eliminate  them.
 "Struggle" is a method for achieving uniformity of views,
 not a device for encouraging independent views. This view
 of the proper function of criticism had also prevailed in
 the patty's adaptation of innerparty struggle, since 1949,
 to the national scene.   That is, like "criticism from be-
 low" in the USSR, the criticism permitted by the CCP to come

 from outside the party had been directed by the parts, itself,
 and directed against individuals or specific instances of mis-
 management; it had never risked criticism of "Marxism-Leninism"
 in theory or practi,'e.
 Thus a Communist official hearing Mao's speeches--or the
 various oral versions of them--might reasonably have been con-
 cerned.   Mao's new line would take away his belief in his total
 justification as a leader of the new society, would expose his
 most cherished convictions to attack, and would commit him to
 deal kindly with the attackers.  To the orthodox--not merely
 to recent graduates of the Marx-Lenin Institute but also to
 party seniors long trained by Mao himself in a much more rigid
 and self-righteous view--Mao's 1957 line must have seemed a
 very dangerous novelty indeed.
 The People's Daily throughout April tried to reassure the
 doubtful both   ns de and outside the party.   One editorial ob-
 served that "not a few" party members had tried to prove that
 there was "danger" in Mao's policy, and had "advised" the pa-
 ty to change it quickly.   The editorial rejected these fears
 as unworthy of the new China where Marxist thought was domi-
 nant.
 Another editorial declared that "preliminary results ara
 good," reaffirmed the "hundred flowers" as a "long-tern guid-
 ing principle," and derided as dogmatists and sectarians "cer-
 tain people" who held contrary views.   Another editorial as-
 serted that the encouragement of criticism would not make "con-
 tradictions" worse, as some alleged, but would merely be tempo-
 rarily embarrassing to the organs criticized.
 Similarly, Chou Yang hailed the "positive developments"
 under the "hundred flowers," and rebuked party cadres by not-
 ing that many intellectuals had cast off the fetters of bour-
 geois idealism only to be re-fettered by the dogmatism of par-
 ty administrators.   The latter, Chou said, still did not rea-
 lize that there was "nothing to fear" in the continued existence
 of differing ideologies.   Chou rejected "pretended belief and
 blind obedience" and declared that "we" (the party) believe that
 "truth can only develop in a struggle with untruth."
 Chou in that interview distinguished two "deviations" which
 were impeding the new policy.   The doctrinaire error was to re-
 ject the "hundred flowers" in order to hide weaknesses, while
 the opportunist error was to seize on the policy as a means of
 discrediting the regime's achievements.   Chou's formulation
 seems not to have been very helpful.    People's  Daily  noted

 shortly thereafter that cadres in Shanghai were so afraid
 of committing either a leftist or rightist error that they 25X1
 felt "bound, hand and foot."
 Chou Yang's "we"--toe party--was clearly not unanimous,
 and some exponents of the doctrinaire (leftist) error m&y
 have been high in the party./__
 A few intellectuals responded to the propaganda depart-
 ment's efforts in April to induce them to speak out boldly.
 One professor of theoretical physics wic1e that the CCP was
 "not now" capable of leadership in certain technical fields.
 Another wrote that some CCP members feared the "hunded flowers"
 because they were "unprepared to defeat in debate" the defend-
 ers of idealism.   This same professor attacked the party's de-
 cision to adopt a Latin phonetic alphabet.
 The propaganda department went to considerable lengths
 to encourage this trend.   For example, People's Daily printed
 a professor's observation that Marxist soc a  science had not
 advanced since 1895.   The newspaper's editors replied that
 "everyone knows" Lenin developed Marxism with his theory of
 imperialism, but the editors did not attack the professor per-
 sonally, called for a discussion of both views, and later
 printed his letter of defense.   The treatment of this profes-
 sor was meant as an example to party members "unduly" fright-
 ened by heresy.   Cadres were told "not to change color when
 discussing the fierce tiger."
 A top-level reaffirmation of Mao's line came on 20 April
 from Peng Chen, a politburo member and mayor and party first
 secretary of Peiping, in a speech to a conference of propa-
 ganda workers.   Peng, known for his bold manner, declared
 roundly that-any man who trembles at blooming and contending
 is "a coward and a man of no talent."  He went on to assert
 that the main problem had been the lack of sufficient 'loom-
 ing arad contending.   Peng called on the "entire party" to
 carry out rectification in the spirit of Mao's line.

 Another CCP politburo member, Kang Sheng, spoke at this
 same propaganda conference.
 As Kang's career had
 been spent almost entirely in party police work, he would be
 expected to be unsympathetic to the "hundred flowers" policy.
 On 27 April the central committee of the CCP issued a di-
 rective on "rectification" of the party, a development which
 had been implied in speeches at the eighth congress and had
 been explicitly forecast since early March.   ("Rectification"
 is a much larger subject than party policy toward intellec-
 tuals, and will be treated in a separate Polo paper.)  The
 directive specified, inter alla, that party organs at all
 levels must review the execution of party policies, notably 25X1
 the "hundred flowers" policy.
 Mao Tse-tung on 30 April made a speech,
 in which he almost certainly gave new impetus to "blooming
 and contending."   It seems likely, from the subsequent behavior
 of the regime's critics, that Mao in this speech guaranteed
 that critics would not be punished.   He apparently condemned
 opponents of free criticism as being "tainted by the Kuomintang
 style"--a charge which appeared in a People's Daily editorial
 two days later.   He seems to have gone even fur  er--into the
 party's organizational methods--by suggesting that the party's
 committee system In universities might be jettisoned.   It was
 later denied that Mao said this, but he must have said some-
 thing like it; the question of party committees in schools be-
 camc a very popular subject in May, and the Peiping press re-
 ported at the end of May that the committee system had already
 been abolished in one university in Shanghai.
 The  Intellectuals Attack the Party, May 1957
 The end of April 1957 was the high point of Mao Tse-tung's
 personal encouragement of his "hundred flowers" policy.   At
 that time, Mao's personal prestige was more strongly committed
 to the suc'ess of this policy than of any policy since mid-
 1955, when the speed-up in agricultural collectivization was
 personally ordered by Mao.
 Moreover, several of Mao's top lieutenants had publicly
 associated themselves with the policy and had reassured the
 intellectuals who were to "bloom and contend."  Chou En-lai
 had been wooing the intellectuals for more than a year, and
 reaffirmed his position early in May. Peng Chen had spoken
 emphatically in late April, and did so again in early May.
 Lu Ting-i had been explaining Mao's line for months.

 As of mid-April, almost all intellectuals, many of whom
 had suffered in the "three-anti's" and "five-anti's" campaigns
 of earlier years, were still suspicious of the new line.  As
 a Marxist historian wrote in People's Daily on 20 April, the
 intellectuals were concerned as-to whether "the loosening of
 the grip is genuine or false, a true goal or a trap."   Most
 of them remained suspicious to the end, and declined to bloom
 and contend.   However, in late April and early May, many in-
 tellectuals apparently concluded that the party was sincere.
 They were almost certainly correct in believing that
 Mao's policy had not been designed as a trap.   Mao's prestige
 would suffer too seriously-~-in mew of his repeated assurances
 --when such a trap was sprung.   There were some fatal flaws,
 however, in the  -thinking of those intellectuals who let them-
 selves be cozened, during May, into speaking out boldly.
 The most important was a failure to realize that Mao did
 not anticipate fundamental criticism of the entire Communist
 position, except perhaps from isolated individuals who could
 be easily dealt with.  The evidence is strong that Mao be-
 lieved that the intellectuals had been generally won over. Mao
 seems to have made the error, perhaps natural in his position
 of isolation from the daily life of China, of taking obedience
 for' love .
 Another mistake, on the part of those intellectuals who
 spoke out, was to think that those of Mao's lieutenants who
 had publicly endorsed his policy were as strongly in favor of
 it as he was.   Some party leaders who publicly associated
 themselves with Mao's policy almost certainly did so out of
 opportunism, whereas others may have disapproved the policy
 but wished to help party members govern under the new and
 more difficult conditions imposed by Mao.   In any case,  the
 intellectuals could not reasonably have expected any of Mao's
 lieutenants to stand up firmly for them if Mao were to change
 his mind.
 A third bad mistake was failure to recognize that certain
 key figures in the party leadership--notably Liu Shao-chi and
 Teng Hsiao-ping--had not associated themselves with the "hun-
 dred flowers."  Liu hid spoken of the policy without ei:thusiasm
 the previous September, and had said nothing for the record
 since.   Teng had said nothing at any time.   Both Liu and Teng
 made brief speeches in Peiping during May, and neither referred
 to the "hundred flowers."  These were the persons--as the prin-
 cipal directors of the party apparatus--who would be expected
 to be the most concerned with Mao's tampering with the party's

 basic and time-tested methods of organizing,  indoctrinating,
 and exploiting the Chinese people.  By early May,   Liu and
 Teng and their subordinates had plenty to worry about, with
 Mao encouraging the refractory human material of China to be-
 come even more refractory, and in effect advising the party
 cadres that their fitness reports were henceforth to be based
 in large part in their success in undermining their own po-
 sitions.
 During May, the Chinese Communist party held a series
 of forums in which non-Communists--mainly intellectuals--
 were encouraged to speak out.   Li Wei-han, director of the
 party's united front department and a party leader regarded
 as close to Chou En-lai, called for "revelations of the mis-
 takes of Communist party members...for the first time" in
 party history.   It was not the unfortunate individual bureau-
 crat, but the entire Communist party, that was subsequently
 assailed.
 The sharpest criticism--coming mainly from intellectuals
 belonging to the puppet parties--struck at the CCP's monopoly
 of power and its methods of asserting that monopoly.  Deteriora-
 tion of relations between the CCP and the people were said by
 the critics to be the natural consequence of the party's belief
 that it should control "everything under heaven."  It was said
 that in China there was "only party, not government," and that
 in reality the party made all the decisions which under  the
 law belonged to the government.   It was further asserted that
 the CCP was not qualified to act as leader over the full range
 of its concern, and that non-Communists should be allowed to
 participate in the making of policy and in the review of "in-
 justices" resulting from previous policies.   It was proposed
 that CCP committees in educational institutions be abolished,
 that newspapers be allowed to print news, that scientists be
 free to act as scientists, and so on.
 The party's basic policies were also hit hard.   It was
 said that the tempo of socialization--fixed by Mao himself--
 should be slowed.   It was argued that the party's domestic
 security measures, and the scope of its ideological "remold
 ing" of the populace, had been excessive.
 It was suggested that in Peiping's relationship with the
 USSR--based on Mao's own formulation of "leaning to one side"
 --the regime had leaned so far to one side that it had fallen
 flat:   Peiping should be compensated for the Soviet looting
 of Manchuria in 1945-46, China should not have to bear the
 full cost of Chinese participation in the Korean war, China

 should get more favorable terms for Soviet aid.   Moreover,
 the Soviet party's 20th congress had admitted that Soviet
 policies had been mistaken, and, judging from events in Po-
 land and Hungary, mistakes were still being made.             25X1
 There was apparently a low-level, poorly coordinated
 effort by the party--or by elements of the party--during May
 to keep criticism within bound .
 Mao Reverses "Liberalization," June 1957
 An indication that the course of "liberalization" would
 be reversed was provided by Mao himself in an address to a
 Youth Corps congress on 25 May.   It may be that increasing
 signs of disaffection and indiscipline among Chinese youth,
 from whom the party expected much more than from their elders
 long hardened in sin, precipitated Mao's decision.   In any
 case, Mao told his audience flatly:   "Words and actions which
 deviate from the cause of socialism are completely wrong."
 It seems likely that the CCP leadership had closed ranks,
 on the decision to crack down, by the time of Mao's remarks
 to the Youth Corps.  The circumstances of Mao's appearance
 -there seemed designed to symbolize solidarity among the lead-
 ers.  Mao was accompanied by all five of the other officers
 of the CCP central cnmmittee--Liu, Chou, Chu Te, Chen Yun,
 and Teng Hsiao-ping--and by Peng Chen, Lp Ting-i, and four
 other politburo members.  The group included both those lead-
 ers who had been most active in promoting "liberalization"--
 Chou, Peng, and Lu--and those leaders who had been most con-
 spicuously absent from that campaign, Liu and Teng.
 The party press from 8 May to 7 June--the most lively
 period of blooming and contending--was operating under a cen-
 tral committee directive to refrain from serious counterattacks
 on "erroneous ideas," according to a later statement in People's
 Daily. On 8 June there began to appear in People's Daily some

 editorials providing further support for the belief that
 "liberalization" was receding.   One editorial reported that
 a non-Communist government official had received an anonymous
 threatening letter after stating at one "forum" that criti-
 cism should not be one-sided and that the CCP had a right "to
 reply" to criticism; this official had been accused in the
 letter of "holding candles for the devil."  The editorial
 noted ominously that "threats and insults" would only sharpen
 the party's awareness that class struggle continues.
 The following day, an editorial stated that many er-
 roneous views "detrimentgl to socialist undertakings" had ap-
 peared, and that correct countercriticism                                  must be developed.
 A day later, an editorial cited the "reactionary, antisocial-
 ist views of an extremely small number of "rightists," identi-
 fied as mainly students and professors.
 People's Daily summed up the situation on 12 June.   An
 editorial  escribed the "overwhelming majority" of criticism
 thus far as "good, correct and beneficial," but noted that
 some of it had been "ill-disposed, hostile, and destructive."
 The newspaper stated that critics of the latter character
 must be counterattacked, in order that mass criticism might
 develop "healthfully."
 The blow that blighted Mao's "hundred flowers" policy, as
 originally conceived, came from Mao himself.   It came in the
 form of an official version, appearing on 18 June, of Mao's
 hitherto unpublished February speech on the handling of "con-
 tradictions."  The June version admittedly contained certain
 of the author's "revisions and additions."  These emendations
 were in effect an admission that Mao's policy had been a mis-
 take and that the Kremlin had been right in its coolness to-
 ward the policy.
 Mao in this official version reaffirmed his view that
 there are "contradictions" in a socialist society, including
 conflicts of interest between the "leadership and the led."
 He also reaffirmed his distinction between "antagonistic"
 contradictions, i.e., those "between ourselves and our ene-
 mies," and 'lnonantagonistic" contradictions, i.e., those
 "among the people."  However, Mao specifically excluded from
 the ranks of the "people" all those who are "against the so-
 cialist revolution" and/or "try to wreck our socialist con-
 struction."
 Mao in this version went to some length to defend the
 concept of a dictatorship exercised by the party in the name

 of the "people."  He derided those who had been led by events
 in Hungary either (a) to hope for a similar uprising in China,
 or (b) to seek a two-party system of the Western type for
 China.
 Mao went on to assert that, under the Communist order,
 "the people enjoy a wide measure of democracy and freedom,
 but at the same time they have to keep themselves within the
 bounds of socialist discipline."  Within these confines, "in
 settling matters of an ideological na ure"-among the people,
 the party chooses to employ "democratic methods, methods of
 discussion, of criticism, of persuasion and education."  In
 other words, as Liu Shao-chi made clear in 1942, the party
 leadership already has the truth, and, so long as this truth
 is not fundamentally challenged, will try by generally con-
 ciliatory means to bring everyone to the truth.
 Later in. this version of his speech, after discussing
 several of the regime's policies and problems, Mao turned to
 the intellectuals.  Noting that "most" of them had "made
 marked progress" since x,950, Mao said that "we should trust
 intellectuals who are really willing to serve the cause of
 socialism."  Reflecting the emphasis in Liu Shao-chi's re-
 marks on the intellectuals in September 1956, Mao observed
 that a thorough change in the world-view of intellectuals
 "takes quite a long time."  Mao criticized the decline in
 the ideological fitness of intellectuals and students, and
 called for a greater effort toward their "remolding."
 A major section of Mao's speech was devoted to his "hun-
 dred flowers" policy.   Mao defended the policy as designed
 to speed China's scientific and cultural development, and
 noted again that many "correct and good things"--including
 the Copernican theory, Darwin's theory of evolution, and
 Marxism itself--had originally been regarded not as flowers
 but as weeds.   He reaffirmed that Marxism must develop through
 struggle, and that the "hundred flowers" policy would help
 Marxism to triumph in China.   However, in contrast to Mao's
 reported view in February that concepts hostile to Marxism
 would no longer find a receptive audience in China, Mao in
 this official version called for suppression of "unmistakable
 counterrevolutionaries and wreckers" and for an attack  on
 "poisonous weeds...wherever they crop up."  Mao abjured the
 party to "distinguish carefully" between fragrant flowers
 and poisonous weeds.
 At just that point in the official version, Mao added
 the criteria, for distinguishing flowers from weeds  which

 SECRET
 killed the "hundred flowers." The addition of these criteria
 were, as a British observer remarked, as if Moses, in review-
 ing his works for publication, had casually inserted the Ten
 Commandments.
 "Words and actions can be judged proper," Mao said, if
 they help to unite the nationalities in China, benefit "so-
 cialist transformation and construction," help to consoli-
 date the dictatorship, help to strengthen "democratic cen-
 tralism" (obedience to upper levels), tend to strengthen
 party leadership of the regime, and benefit "international
 socialist solidarity."  The most important of these criteria,
 Mao added, related to the "socialist path and the leadership
 of the party."  In sum, no one would be permitted henceforth
 to criticize the CCP's monopoly of power and its basic pro-
 gram--exactly those things which had been most enthusiastical-
 ly criticized in the blooming and contending.   (Mao added that
 "Those who do not approve of these criteria can still put for-
 ward their views and argue their case"--but it seems unlikely
 that even the most naive of the regime's opponents believed
 this, after Mao had spoken.)   With respect to "supervision"
 of the Communist party by other parties, Mao remarked that
 "advice and criticism...will play a useful role...only when
 they conform to the six political criteria given above."
 Although Mao's original miscalculation of the party's
 support among the intellectuals had become apparent before
 the official version of his February speech was released in
 June, and was evident beyond question in the "revisions and
 additions" appearing in the official version, the CCP's propa-
 ganda department strove manfully to conceal Mao's mistake.
 The department's tack was to attempt to create the impression
 that a carefully contrived trap had been laid, and that the
 intended prey had fallen into it.
 The People's Daily asserted on 20 June that the party in
 its 'Wisdom   a  planne  to encourage "poisonous weeds to show
 themselves" so that they could later be uprooted.   The same
 editorial gave away the show, however, by stating that the
 party's "rectification" campaign could proceed "smoothly" only
 when the attacks of the rightists had been smashed--in other
 words, that the antirightist part of the campaign had not been
 planned by the party but had been forced on it.
 Similarly, People's Daily on 22 June argued that CCP mem-
 bers who had feared   a   Mao's policy would arouse "great dis-
 order" in China, and that the people would "attack them," had been
 proven wrong.   Actually, they had been proven right.

 Iia any case, apart from the wriggling of the propa-
 gandists to persuade the party and the populace that Mao
 had been right all along, the conclusion was clear to them
 both:   "liberalization" was finished.
 Solidarity of CCP Leaders, Summer 1957
 Following the publication of the official version of
 Mao's speech on "contradictions," CCP leaders were at pains
 throughout summer 1957 to demonstrate their solidarity on
 the decision to reverse "liberalization" and to take a hard-
 er line toward the intellectuals.   In particular, those of
 Mao's lieutenants who had had the most important roles in
 promoting "liberalization"--Chou En-lai, Lu Ting-i, and
 Peng Chen--found occasion during summer 1957 to make major
 speeches lining themselves up with Mao's revised position.
 Chou En-lai was first in line, on 26 June.   In contrast
 to the tendency of CCP pronouncements after September 1956
 to minimize the class struggle, Chou called for recognition
 that a serious struggle continued.   Reflecting Mao's cri-
 teria, Chou set high above criticism the concepts of "so-
 cialism...,the basic system of our state,...the leading role
 of the Communist party," and...national and international
 unity."  Further indicating the type of criticism which Mao
 and perhaps Chou had expected during "liberalization," and
 which was henceforth the only kind to be permitted, Chou
 conceded that there were defects in the working style of
 party and government functionaries.   Chou called for a "de-
 termined struggle" against the "rightists"  (fundamental crit-
 ics), and warned that those who did not repent and "remold
 themselves" would "cut themselves off from' the people."
 On 1 July, the party began to attack individual right-
 ists, rather than the general rightist position.  People's
 Daily also admitted that there were "bourgeois rightists"  In
 the   CP and its youth auxiliary as well as in the puppet par-
 ties whose ranks had provided most of the fundamental critics.
 On 11 July, Lu Ting-i added his personal voice, rather
 than simply speaking through the propaganda department.   De-
 fending the original conception of the "hundred flowers" pol-
 icy, Lu specified that up to 3, percent of university students
 and  a  "few percent" of intellectuals had proved themselves
 to be corrupted.   Reaffirming the new emphasis on a continu-
 ing class struggle, Lu called for a long process of "remold-
 ing."

 An interesting sidelight on the question of disagree-
 ment among CCP leaders over the "liberalization" policy came
 on 16 July,  in a , forum of scientists in Peiping.  According
 to Peiping itself, one delegate asserted that "liberaliza-
 tion" had developed poorly' ,because high-ranking CCP members--
 for example, Liu Shao-chi au  Peng Chen--had opposed it and
 had attempted to sabotage it.  This delegate further asserted
 that Mao had been forced to compromise, and to agree to the
 counterattack, by these other leaders.   Peiping denied these
 charges.   The delegate was probably mistaken in part--insofar
 as he implied that there was still a high-level split in the
 party after the critics had attacked the CCP's entire position.
 The de ega a was very probably right in part, however, as dis-
 agreement had apparently persisted well into May, Liu Shao-chi
 had probably been unsympathetic to the "hundred flowers"  (and
 Peng Chen may have been, despite his role in promoting the pol-
 icy), and Mao may well have been offered serious counsel by
 Liu and others from the early stages of blooming and contend-
 People    Daily on 28 July, possibly reflecting the recent
 activity o  par y guardians such as Lill Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping, stated that the "antirightist atruggle...has exposed many
 rightists" within the Chinese Communist party, and had revealed
 considerable receptivity in the party to "bourgeois ideas."
 This admission did not suggest the presence, at the top levels
 of the party, of a "rightist" clique sympathetic to the funda-
 mental critics.   Among the leadership, as distinct from the
 Party mass, the evidence indicated only a "leftist" or ortho-
 dox opposition to Mao's earlier line.   It was the orthodox po-
 sition which, in late May or early June, had triumphed.
 Peng Chen on 4 August became the last of the three prin-
 cipal exponents of Mao's earlier line on "liberalization" to
 stand up for the new line.   Peng, the most emphatic of Mao's
 lieutenants in espousing the old line, was among the most em-
 phatic in endorsing the new one.  The party, Peng declared,
 cannot tolerate rightist attacks, and the rightists must recog-
 nize that it is a choice between "absolute right and absolute
 wrong."  Like other party leaders, Peng said that the party
 would continue to welcome criticism of the "work and working
 style" of party and government functionaries.
 Lu Ting-i spoke up again on 16 August,  Lu described the
 antirightist campaign as"life-and-death" struggle.   He reaf-
 firmed the orthodox objective of "an intelligentsia of the
 working class," which was to include only those intellectuals
 the old society who had "truly transformed" themselves and
 Id be relied on to oppose every manifestation of bourgeois
 thought.

 Perhaps the most amusing illustration of the new line
 came in a People's Daily editorial of 16 August.   The edi-
 torial observed that   He development of the anti-rightist
 campaign had been uneven,  in large part because of "dif-
 ferences in the seriousness of the leadership" of various
 organs in various areas.   Some of the "principal responsi-
 ble cadres" had failed to assume a "serious, responsible
 attitude...."  In other words, whereas party cadres had
 previously been told that their prospects for advancement
 would depend on their success in stimulating criticism, they
 were now being told that their prospects would depend on their
 alacrity in apprehending and punishing the critics.
 Many other party leaders took some part, during summer
 1957, in the explication of Mao's new position.   The summer
 was a period of "Great Debate"--that is, reaffirmation of
 principles which were not henceforth to be questioned, in the
 guise of finding overwhelming popular support of those prin-
 ciples.
 Of the other members of the politburo--i.e., in addition
 tD Mao, Chou, Lu Ting-i and Peng Chen--Kang Sheng made a fair-
 ly important address in support of ideological orthodoxy.  Kang,
 whose speech in April during the period of blooming and contend-
 ing had not been published, was evidently on more congenial
 ground on this occasion.   Lesser statements, on one or another
 feature of the new line, were delivered by Chu Te, Tung Pi-wu,
 Peng Te-huai, Chen Po-ta, and Po I-po.
 Below the politburo level, the most ambitious speech on
 the "antirightist struggle" was given by Ko Ching-shih, head
 of the Shanghai regional bureau and the Shanghai municipal
 committee of the party.   Ko, who has seemed close to the con-
 jectured "organizational" group of party leaders led by Liu
 Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, and who in 1958 has seemed to be
 a personal friend of Mao's as well, gave a long report in Shang-
 hai in mid-August.  Ko's report was the sort of exegesis of Mao's
 line ordinarily expected only from a member of the inner circle,
 and anticipated certain features of Teng Hsiao-ping's definitive
 report on "rectification" given in September.   Other  important
 members of the central committee getting into the act during
 the summer were An Tzu.-wen, Li Ko-nung, Li Hsueh-feng, Li Wei-
 ban,  Teng Ying-chao, and Lai Jo-yu, directors of important cen-
 tral departments of the party.
 Important members of the politburo missing from the "anti-
 rightist struggle" of summer 1957 were Liu Shao-chi, Teng Hsiao-
 ping, Chen Yun, Chen I, Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien, Ulanfu, and
 Chang Wen-tien.   Also missing was Teng Tzu-hui, director of the

 party's rural work department.   None of these persons is
 known to have taken a strong position, prior to the crack-
 down, which had to be publicly reversed, but they were prob-
 ably missing for different reasons.   As for the first three
 persons named above, each of them an officer of the central
 committee, it seems likely that Liu and Teng had been un-
 sympathetic to "liberalization" and thus saw no need to hur-
 ry to go on record after they had been proved right; whereas
 Chen Yun's absence seemed to be related to a general decline   25X6
 in his activity.
 The two Li's, as economists, were not as directly 25X6
 concerned with "liberalization" as party ideologists and or-
 ganizers.   Ulanfu was important primarily as party boss in
 Mongolia, where "liberalization" was apparently not much of
 an issue. The absence of Chang Wen-tien and Teng Tzu-hui
 seemed likely to be the result of a decline in their import-
 ance in party councils.
 Teng Hsiao-ping Sums It Up, September 1957
 The People's Daily announced on 5 September that the
 CCP's "rectification movement, under way since May, and
 the party-directed "antirightist campaign," under way since
 June, would be merged to become "a rectification movement of
 all the people." On 23 September, Teng Hsiao-ping, the party's
 secretary general, speaking before a plenary session of the
 central committee, gave a long report on the new "nationwide
 rectification movement."  In laying out guide lines for the
 movement, Teng made clear the party's decision to return to
 a hard orthodox policy toward the intellectuals.
 Teng in his report gave Mao Tse-tung credit for having
 decided, in July, to merge the two campaigns into one move-
 ment, and for having set forth the "clear-cut principles"
 for its development which Teng's report was to explicate.
 Orthodox party leaders' view of Mao's earlier role was per-
 haps involuntarily illuminated in Teng's statement that de-
 velopments "during the past four months," i.e., since late
 May, the time when Mao apparently decided to reverse "lib-
 eralization," had been "fully compatible with the analysis
 of the central committee and Comrade Mao Tse-tung...."   In
 other words, Mao's assessment prior to late May had been mis-
 taken.
 Teng called for a continuation of the "great national de-
 bate" on such fundamental questions as whether the party's
 achievements or its mistakes were more important; whether the
 goal of "socialism" was correct; whether "Communist party

 leadership, proletarian dictatorship, and the system of dem-
 ocratic centralism" were desirable; and whether Peiping's
 foreign policies were correct.   Teng was thus calling, like
 Mao in June and others since, for intensive indoctrination
 of the populace and the party masses in orthodox Communist
 dogmas which were not henceforth to be questioned.
 Teng devoted one major section of his report specifically
 to the "bourgeoisie and the intellectuals."  Mao's discussion
 of this subject in the official version of his speech could
 be seen by careful examination to be hard in substance, but
 Mao's manner had been kindly.   Teng took care to be harsh
 enough in both substance and manner to prevent any misunder-
 standing.
 Noting that the 'antirightist struggle" had been conducted
 mainly among the bourgeoisie and (their) intellectuals, Teng
 specified that "the bourgeoisie, especially their intellectuals,
 now constitute the main force that can challenge the prole-
 tariat"--in other words, the source of the most dangerous op-
 position to the party.   Unless they "transform themselves...
 to serve socialism;' Teng warned, they will become suspended
 in mid-air.
 Teng said that blooming and contending would continue in
 academic and cultural fields, but "socialism is the premise"
 for all such discussion.   Specifically,  there would be no
 change in the principles'of "party leadership, the proletarian
 dictatorship, and the system of democratic centralism."  Sim-
 ilarly, the "primary policies of the party, such as...elimina-
 tion of counterrevolutionaries, collectivization, and state
 purchasing and marketing of major farm products,...will not
 undergo any change."  Teng noted that the sole purpose of en-
 couraging "poisonous weeds"--the expression o  opinion hostile
 to the party's principles and policies--was "to use them as
 fertilizer."' He added that those who do not accept these prin-
 ciples and policies would find themselves in the position of
 enemies of the people.
 Teng went on to describe the intellectuals in terms of
 three groups:   the "leftists" who support socialism and the
 CCP, the "rightists" who oppose them, and a group larger than
 the other two together, the "middle-of-the-roaders."  Teng
 added that the.rightist attacks had proved that the majority
 of intellectuals were "still unwilling" to accept Communist
 leadership.   (This was a harsher and more realistic assess-
 ment than Chou En-lei's in 1956 and Mao Tse-tung's in 1956
 and early 1957, when a belief that the majority of intellectuals

 were supporters of the party and its program clearly underlay
 the experiment in "liberalization.")  Teng observed that the
 antirightist campaign had begun to induce some change in the
 thinking of this majority, and called for the campaign to
 continue "to the end."
 Returning to Mao Tse-tung's line of 1942, which had been
 reaffirmed by spokesmen for orthodoxy at various times t here-
 after, Teng stated that the ideological reform of intellec-
 tuals is a "long-term task," requiring perhaps ten years or
 more. In addition to providing the intellectuals with in-
 tensive "socialist education," Teng said, the party must
 take vigorous organizational measures to ensure its control
 over the intellectuals.
 Teng went on to state that the party must produce its
 own intellectuals:  "professors, teachers, scientists,  jour-
 nalists,  writers, artists, and Marxist theoreticians."  All
 central and local organs of the party, Teng said, must draw
 up concrete plans to this end.   As a part of this effort,  the
 party would "absorb in a planned manner revolutionary intellec-
 tuals of fine character."  This was consistent with the con-
 servative approach to the recruiting of intellectuals taken
 by Liu Shao-chi and Teng himself at the CCP congress in'Sep-
 tember 1956, in contrast to the confidence displayed by Chou
 En-lai earlier in 1956 in his call for the recr.itment of
 one third of all high-level intellectuals by 1962.  However,
 Teng did call, as had Chou in 1956, for better treatment of
 intellectuals submissive to the party.
 Teng also had a few words to say about members of the
 CCP classified as intellectuals.   In comparison with June
 1956,  by September 1957 (Teng's figures, in both cases) the
 number of party members cl'assi'fied as intellectuals had risen
 by more than 600,000 to a total of 1, 880, 000, and, in terms of
 percentage, had risen from about 12 to about 15 percent.  Teng
 observed sourly that "during a certain period"--presumably
 since mid-1956 and presumably as a result of the Mao-Chou con-
 fidence in the intellectuals--the party had "absorbed too many
 young intellectuals who had not undergone productive labor,
 steeling, and actual struggle...."  Teng said that intellec-
 tuals accepted in the future would be only those "steeled in
 production and struggle," and that those who had not had that
 experience would be sent down to lower levels to get it.
 By the time Teng's speech was published, in October 1957,
 there was plenty of evidence that the party meant what Teng
 said.   Hundreds of "rightists" had been "exposed" and profes-
 sionally ruined,  and the total bag was obviously to be thousands.

 Many "rightists" who had slipped into the category of "coun-
 terrevolutionaries" had boen arrested, and some had report-
 edly been shot.
 It must have been clear to the intellectuals that their
 position in October 1957 was, and would remain, considerably
 worse than it had been in early 1956, when Mao and Chou began
 the experiment with "liberalization."  Not only had the party
 been confirmed in an orthodox distrust of them but that dis-
 trust had increased, and the party now had a substantial rec-
 ord of their feelings with which to keep distrust alive and
 to discourage any future temptation to !'liberalize."  Not
 only would the intellectuals be unable to modify Communist
 dogmas and institutions, but they would be forced to suffer
 longer indoctrination and more severe repression.   Not only
 would it be difficult for them to find work they could respect
 in a field of their choosing, but very few of them--even, among
 those who were taken into the party--could look forward to any-
 thing more than ill-paid drudgery for life.   The hope of a de-
 cent accommodation with the Communists was extinguished.

 Effects on Party Leaders
 The status of several Chinese Communist party leaders
 may have been affected by developments related to party poli-
 cies toward the intellectuals in the past few years.   Those
 most likely to have been affected, at the politburo level,
 would appear to be Mao Tse-tung himself,  Chou En-lai, Lu
 Ting-i, and Peng Chen, the principal spokesman for the soft
 phase of Mao's ;:hinking, and Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping,  the conjectured defenders of orthodoxy.
 Mao Tse-tung, despite his orthodox background of distrust
 of intellectuals, was almost certainly primarily responsible
 for the experiment with "liberalization" in 1956-57.   In Jan-
 uary 1956, acting with Chou En-lai,  Mao proposed better treat-
 ment of tame intellectuals.   In May 1956, Mao personally in-
 augurated "liberalization" with his "hundred flowers" slogan.
 In February and March of 1957, Mao strongly reaffirmed his
 soft policy
 strongly for his                  In April 1957, Mao again spoke
 policy, and apparently suggested an incliua -
 tion to alter the party's orthodox organizational as well as
 ideological procedures.   Only after his policy had clearly
 failed--i.e., in late May 1957--did Mao reaffirm an orthodox
 position.  Following Mao's reaffirmation,  the party was in
 an ever: worse position, with respect to enlisting the intel-
 lectuals, than it had been before Mao stirred them up.
 In sum, Mao in May was exposed to the party as foolish
 (on this issue), and Mao in June was exposed to the intel-
 lectuals  (in China and wherever the campaign had been fol-
 lowed) as treacherous.  The latter is probably of little im-
 portance, with regard to Mao's status in the party, but Mao's
 miscalculation and his persistence in a wrong-headed policy
 would seem of some importance.   Moreover,  his failure in this
 instance was not unique, but followed at least two other in-
 stances of personal intervention which also had less gratify-
 ing results than Mao had promised.   One of these was his in-
 sistence in late 1955 that "rightist conservatism" in econom-
 ic planning must be overcome, with the result that planning
 for 1956 was excessively ambitious and led to dislocations
 in the economy that took about a year to correct.  Another
 was his encouragement of Gomulka in conversations and by oth-
 er actions in the fall of 1956, which had the effect of em-
 boldening "revisionist" thinking throughout Eastern Europe and
 in China itself.   All three of these mistakes derived from
 Mao's over-confidence in his assessments.

 Mao's position in the party was so strong that he could
 survive--perhaps only he could survive--three consecutive mis-
 takes of  this magnitude.     It seems fair to conclude,  how-
 ever, that by mid-1957 Mao's stature had somewhat diminished,
 in the eyes of some if not most of his lieutenants.   It seems
 likely that Mao had brought the time nearer when one of his
 personal policies would be actively opposed by a bloc of his
 own lieutenants, and the time nearer also when he would be en-
 couraged to step aside by becoming the party's "Honorary Chairman."
 Chou En-lai, with a background of less hostility to in-
 tellectuals than most party leaders, and with a government
 Job which gave him a strong interest in getting more use out
 of intellectuals, probably approved the "soft" line which he
 introduced in January 1956.   His personal views were probably
 again reflected in his conciliatory remarks at the party con-
 gress in September 1956.   It is very doubtful that Chou suf-
 fered any decline in status, in Mao's eyes, for having sup-
 ported Mao's line on "liberalization."  Moreover, K o's per-
 sonal identification with the policy was so marked that he
 could not have made Chou the scapegoat for the failure of the
 policy, in the eyes of other party leaders, even if he had
 wanted to.   It is possible that the defenders of orthodoxy
 did not blame Chou appreciably for his association with the
 policy.   It seems more likely, however, that Chou lost at
 least a little face with this group, because, after all, they
 had managed to avoid identification with the policy, and Chou,
 whatever his reasons, had not.
 Lu Ting-i, with a background as a spokesman for Mao which
 left uncertain his own attitude toward the intellectuals, was
 a spokesman for all phases of Mao's thinking.   Lu's propaganda
 department administered the policy of attacks on the intellec-
 tuals in 1954-55, and then supported Chou's, soft line in early
 1956.   Lu personally explicated Mao's line on "liberalization"
 in the spring of 1956.   The propaganda department took a more
 conservative line after the troubles in Eastern  Europe in the
 fall of 1956, and then got in step with Mao's reaffirmation
 of his liberal position in the spring of 1957.   Lu announced
 the imminent "rectification" campaign in the party in April
 1957, and finally lined up with Mao in the reversal of  "lib-
 eralization" in summer 1957.   In sum, Lu was so well known
 to other party leaders as simply a reflector of Mao's position
 that his personal situation could have remained unchanged. How-
 ever, he may also have lost some face with the "organizational"
 group.   Lui's position in the party has seemed to depend so
 heavily on Mao that, in terms of Lu's future,  Lu's personal
 line on any given issue in recent yea,-,. may not much matter.

 That is, the party leadership which succeeds Mao may get
 another propaganda chief in any case.
 Peng Chen's intentions, in playing his role in the en-
 couragement and then reversal of "liberalization," are very
 hard to assess.   Peng has been regarded as a protegd of both
 Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-chi, and has been thought to belong
 in the conjectured "organizational" group of party leaders
 centered on Liu and Teng Hsiao-ping.   However, it has been
 thought possible that Peng is less than a whole-hearted com-
 rade of either Liu or Teng, because Teng replaced Peng from
 about 1953 as Liu's first lieutenant for party affairs.   On
 the basis of his pre-1957 record, Peng's strong support   of
 the reversal of "liberalization" in summer 1957 was the line
 which Peng would have been expected to approve, rather  than
 the line strongly in favor of "liberalization" which Pe n6
 had taken in April 1957.   If Peng's hard line of August was
 known by other party leaders to represent his true attitude,
 it seems likely that Peng, like Chou En-lai, would have lost
 only a little face with the "organizational" comrades for hav-
 ing been induced to play a role during the soft phase of Mao's
 thinking.   However, it is conceivable that Peng, in associat-
 ing himself so strongly with Mao's policy in spring 1957, was
 making a deliberate bid for Mao's favor over Liu and Teng,
 with the hope of eventually displacing them both.   If this is
 true, and on the assumption that it would have been apparent
 to Liu and Teng if it were true, Peng injured himself sorely
 and perhaps irreparably with the latter pair.
 Liu Shao-chi, with a background of distrust of intellec-
 tuals at least as strong as Mao's pre-1956 attitude, is sur-
 mised to have been throughout the leader of forces unsympa-
 thetic to "liberalization."  Liu did not go on record to sup-
 port Chou's soft line of early 1956, and, while he formally
 endorsed the "hundred flowers" concept in September 1956, his
 emphasis was definitely on the unreliability of the intellec-
 tuals and their potential for corruption.   Liu's speech of
 April 1957, following Mao's reaffirmation of a liberal posi-
 tion, was not published, and, particularly in the light of
 the increasing threat to orthodox ideological and organi na-
 tional procedures, seems likely to have had the same disagree-
 able emphasis as his remarks of the previous September.   When
 Liu's presumed position was vindicated in the spring of 1957,
 Liu remained silent, as he could certainly afford to do if his
 position were already well known to other party leaders.   In
 sum, it seems likely that Liu was both right on this issue and
 tactful about being right.   He apparently retained his status
 as Mao's favorite lieutenant and presumably gained prestige

 with other party leaders, and thus enhanced his prospects to
 dominate the group which dominates the party after Mao's death
 or retirement.
 Teng Hsiao-ping, with a background of attitudes similar to
 Liu's and a recent history of close association with Liu, first
 took a hand in stating party policy toward intellectuals in
 September 1956.   At that time, he avoided endorsing the  "hun-
 dred flowers" policy and took a line on the intellectuals sim-
 ilar to Liu's although less pronounced than Liu's.  Teng did
 not associate himself with "liberalization" in any way in the
 following year, and may reasonably be conjectured to have
 shared Liu's view of the entire affair.  At the same time,
 Teng apparently retained Mao's good opinion, as he was chosen
 to lay out the guide lines for the nationwide "rectification"
 in September 1957.    In go doing, Teng reaffirmed an orthodox
 hard policy toward intellectuals believed to be entirely in
 agreement with Liu's position.   Teng seemed to come out of it
 at least as well as Liu.  He apparently stood with Liu and
 thus enhanced his prospects to be a key figure in the succes-
 sion, and he may even have improved his chances for displac-
 ing Liu if that temptation should arise.
 Ko Ching-shah, the party boss of East China, also seemed
 to come out very well.   Regarded as a member of the "organiza-
 tional" group around Liu and Teng, Ko played a major role only
 after the reversal of "liberalization."  By playing this role
 in summer 1957 along the lines of both Mao's official position
 of June 1957 and Teng's position as later stated in September
 1957, Ko probably gained favor with both Mao and the "organiza-
 tional" figures, and improved his chances to be taken into the
 inner circle.
 Kang Sheng, with a background of party police work and a
 presumed aversion to intellectuals, played no public role in
 encouraging "liberalization" and played a fairly important
 role in reaffirming orthodoxy after "liberalization" was re-
 versed.   In appearing to stand with Liu and Teng, Kang may
 have improved his position, which had not seemed strong since
 his demotion from full to alternate member of the politburo
 in 1956.
 At the time of this writing (May 1958), it cannot be
 demonstrated that the particular issue of the intellectuals
 has affected the status of individual leaders--not, that is,
 to the same degree that the particular issue of the speed
 of agricultural collectivization can be shown to have affected

 the status of Tong Tzu-hui. Teng at the party congress in
 September 1956 stated publicly that he had taken a mistaken-
 ly conservative position on this question; the congress failed
 to elect him to the politburo and indeed dropped rim 12 slots
 on the central. committee, and he was subsequently displr".ced
 by Tan Chen-lin (an "organizational" type) as the party s
 mein spokesman on agriculture.   Similar admissions of error,
 or assertions of virtue, may never appear, with regard to
 policy toward intellectuals, as Mao himself was most at
 fault.   It may be that the issue can only be presumed--never
 demonstrated--to be a contributing factor in the rise or de-
 cline of the figures discussed in this paper.
