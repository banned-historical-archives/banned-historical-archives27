 All levels of the political structure in Communist
 China have been profoundly shaken in recent months, and
 an end to the turmoil is not yet in sight.   The chief
 unsettling force appears to be Mao Tse-tung's growing
 mistrust of the leaders who run the party machinery and
 of the machinery itself,
 Whether Mao has felt sharp misgivings about several
 of the men around him for a long time--as the official
 record now asserts--or developed them only after resuming
 public appearances last spring after a five and one-half
 months absence is, in a sense, unimportant.  There is little
 question that since May he has been back in the saddle,
 morbidly suspicious of once-trusted comrades, and ready
 to sweep away all sorts of "freaks and monsters" which he
 imagines are opposing him in virtually all sectors of
 society and the party.
 The most significant change has been the breakup of
 the group of radical hardliners who had run the party machin-
 ery for more than a decade.  Mao has evidently come to believe
 that many,  in varying degrees, are disloyal or ineffective.
 This group was led by Liu Shao-chi and party General Secretary
 Teng Hsiao-ping, men who seemed to hold radical views con-
 genial to Mao.  Both seem to have been weakened, Liu more
 than Tengn   Important figures dismissed in recent months--
 Peng Chen, Lo Jui-ching (although army chief of staff, party
 security affairs seemed to be his major field of responsibility),
 and propaganda chiefs Lu Ting-i and Chou Yang--were all party-
 machine figures who apparently held similar views.   One of
 the few party-machine men who have gained in the recent up-
 heaval is Fang Sheng                                         Iwho appears    25X1
 to be the chief investigator  or the cultural revolution
 campaign.
 Mao's new lieutenants were drawn mainly from outside the
 party apparatus.   He turned to his favorite general Lin Piao,
 apparently the only leader now fully trusted, to replace Liu
 Shao-chi as first deputy.  The flexible premier Chou En-lai
 retains a firm grip on third place, a position held for many
 years.   In fourth place in the list of leaders attending the
 mammoth 18 August rally in Peking was Tao Chu, former Central-
 South China boss and a loner, who had been brought to Peking
 in July to be new propaganda chief.

 The situation is puzzling, especially with respect to
 policy implications,   With Mao seemingly intent on pushing
 radical programs to reshape society,  it would seem paradoxical
 for him to turn against old comrades who shared his radical
 views and to retain or promote men like Chou En-lai, and the
 economists Li Fu-chun and Chen Yuan, relative moderates who in
 the past have espoused pragmatic views of the kind now con-
 demned as "revisionist."
 The social upheaval which since mid-May has accompanied
 the shake-up in the political structure appears to be level-
 ing off.   Since about mid-July Peking has been trying to curb
 the excesses of its "cultural revolution" in schools and
 local organizations.   There apparently is less disruption of
 foreign trade negotiations and foreign travel to China.   On
 8 August the central committee formally directed that in
 future attacks upon individuals strict distinction be made
 between persons loyal to the party who have expressed mistaken
 views and those who seek to undermine party control,
 Educational institutions have borne the brunt of the
 "cultural revolution,"  Classes have been suspended since
 mid-May and replaced with day-long denunciations of teachers
 and university officials.   Professors have been publicly
 humiliated and some reportedly committed suicide.   Peking
 has dismissed numerous university administrators for opposing
 party policies.
 It is still far from clear how far Peking intends to
 push the "thorough reforms" in education promised in a 13
 June Central Committee and State Council notice.   The only
 firm steps taken thus far have been a six-month postponement
 in the enrollment of the 1966 freshman class at universities
 and the retention of univerity and high school students at
 their schools for indoctrination this summer.   However, since
 June the party press has published numberous suggestions for
 radical departures in enrollment procedures, curricula and
 operating methods.   The practical impact of these proposals
 may be limited since most resemble practices already in
 effect in 1964 and 1965.

 Scientists and technicians have come in for less
 harassment than any other segment of Chinese society.
 The   8    August central committee directive ordered
 party officials directing the ideological purification
 drive not to disrupt scientific and technical work.  At-
 tempts to denigrate western scientific theories, prominent
 last winter, have not been highlighted this summer.
 The Chinese have been cautious in their approach to
 agriculture.  Floods and droughts having seriously damaged
 crops in many areas this year, and under these conditions
 the party is unlikely to initiate new policies that might
 antagonize peasants and further reduce food supplies.
 Although reports are occasionally received indicating that
 privately cultivated land has been reduced, such reports
 probably refer to restrictions imposed in 1964 and 1965
 during "four clearance" drives.
 The presence in cities of large numbers of idle, dis-
 affected youth persists as a serious social problem.   Make-
 shift solutions--the sending of youth to the countryside
 and the development of "street-run" industry--have not met
 with great success.   One government program to deal with
 unemployed youth--the sending of them to Sinkiang--continues
 on about the same small scale as in previous years.
 China's preoccupation with the domestic cultural revolu-
 tion has been reflected in the sharp dropoff in Peking's
 public commentary on Vietnam and all developments abroad.
 The little that has been said, moreover, follows well-
 established lines,  and Peking's foreign policy still appears
 to be marking time.   The central committee plenum communique
 contained nothing more than a perfunctory reaffirmation of
 foreign policy positions expounded on at length over the
 last few years, and there has been no change in the general
 tenor of recent pronouncements by Chinese officials.  During
 the summer there were new indications that the North Koreans,
 long among Peking's staunchest supporters, were edging
 further toward Moscow and had grown increasingly critical
 of certain Chinese policies.   Chinese military aid continued
 to arrive in Pakistan

 I,   The Leadership
 A new team of leaders, headed by Mao Tse-tung and
 Defense Minister Lin Piao, was unveiled at a mammoth rally held
 in Peking on 18 August.   Profound changes in the power structure
 of the party apparently have taken place, the most significant
 being the decline in stature of the "party-machine" group of
 radical leaders who had dominated the party for more than a
 decade.   The implications all this has for policy are unclear,
 since Mao himself seems intent on pushing radical programs,
 but, paradoxically, has retained or promoted some of his most
 moderately inclined advisers,
 The selection of Lin to succeed Mao may be a reflection
 of Mao's growing mistrust of other elements in the leadership,
 Lin Piao was described on 18 August as a "close comrade in arms"
 of Mao,  the only leader to receive this accolade in nearly two
 years.   Lin's views on policies are unknown.   He is a profession-
 al soldier whose few political pronouncements have usually been
 limited to exhortations to study the thought of Mao.   In spite
 of Lin's limited experience in running party affairs and his
 long history of ill health, there seems little doubt that he is
 Mao's chosen heir,
 Liu Shao-chi, who had held this position since at
 least 1956, still holds his ceremonial job of chief of state, but
 was eighth in the list of officials attending the 18 August rally,
 General Secretary Teng Hsiao-ping also appears to have lost some
 ground, though not as much as Liu.   He was the sixth in the list
 of officials at the rally; in the normal order of party rank he
 would have been in fourth place.
 Premier Chou En-lai retains his position in third place,
 one he has held for many years.   He was the only leader besides
 Mao and Lin Piao singled out for honored treatment at the rally.
 He made a speech and sat on Mao's right,   An NCNA English-language
 account of the rally linked Lin and Chou together as Mao's
 "comrades in arms".  Newspapers in Peking the next day published
 many group photographs of Mao, Lin,and Chou, while slighting other
 leaders,
 These shifts in relative standings of leaders, and other
 as yet unannounced changes, presumably were worked out at the
 central committee plenum held from 1 to 12 August,   The sweeping
 nature of the changes, and signs of press disarray from 8 to 12
 August, suggest that the final decisions were reached only after

 Approved F4
 sharp debate toward the end of the plenum.   The failure to clarify
 more explicitly positions of top officials, normally done after
 central committee plenums, implies that the situation is still
 fluid.
 The published list of about 200 officials who were on
 the rostrum with Mao on 18 August indicates that only the top
 level of the hierarchy has been shaken up.  Most of the first
 eleven names on the list are out of normal order of rank, but from
 then on the list adheres, with few exceptions, to.the long-
 established order of party rank.
 The appearance of three members of the party's cultural
 revolution team--Chen Po-ta,, the head, and Tao Chu and Kang Sheng
 --in the top eleven is not necessarily a measure of their true
 party standing.   They may have been accorded prominent treatment
 merely because the rally was held to celebrate the cultural
 revolution.  On the other hand, since Mao apparently regards the
 cultural revolution as the single most important political program
 of the day, he may want the officials charged with conducting that
 program in his inner circle of advisers.
 The chart following page 6 presents the possible current
 politburo lineup, based on the list of officials attending the
 18 August rally.
 The most striking aspect of the new leadership is the
 apparent breakup of the "pasty-machine"  roup of leaders.  Earlier
 F analyses of the Chinese leadership

 dominated the party, chiefly because such men had a radical or
 "leftist" approach to policies which was pleasing to Mao.  The
 major party figures dismissed recently--Peng Chen, Lo Jui-ching,
 Lu Ting-i and Chou Yang--seemed to be "party-machine" men.
 Neither Liu nor Teng, powerful general secretary of the
 party, has been credited with playing any role in the cultural
 revolution, the party's major program of the past twelve months.
 Since Teng in particular must have been closely involved, at
 least in the early stages when three or four members of his
 secretariat were brought down, his apparent decline implies that
 he may have overplayed his hand.
 Whatever the full reasons for Mao's change of heart, he

 evidently has been persuaded that leaders who had run the party
 machinery for the past decade were, in varying degrees, untrust-
 worthy or ineffective, and has turned to other elements in the
 party to carry out his programs.   Lin Piao represents the army,
 Chou En-lai the economists and administrators in the government,
 and Tao Chu is a loner--a regional official who built his own
 power base in the Central-South and who cannot be associated
 with any leaders at the center,
 With Mao seemingly intent on pushing a radical program
 for reshaping society, there is no satisfactory explanation for
 his willingness to turn against old comrades who seemed to share
 his radical views and to retain men like Chou En-lai, Li Fu-chun,
 and Chen Yun, relative moderates who have in the past expoused
 pragmatic economic views of the kind now condemned as "revisionist,"
 In view of this contradiction and signs that the situation
 is still unstable, it is difficult to speculate fruitfully on
 possible policy implications of the recent leadership upheaval.

 II.   Domestic Political Developments
 A,   Slowdown in the Cultural Revolution
 Since about mid-July Peking has been trying to curb
 the excesses of the "cultural revolution" in schools and local
 organizations.   The campaign continues, but party pronouncements
 have borne down hard on the theme that there are only a "hand-
 ful" of irreconcilable "class enemies"--and circumspection is
 to be used in judging who these are and in dealing with them.
 Less harsh treatment has been ordered for intellectuals and
 students; physical punishment and forced confessions have been
 disallowed,   The first signs of dampening were noted in mid-
 July when the provincial party secretaries of Anhwei and Fukien
 directed their subordinates to "reason with facts" against a,nti-
 party elements.   On 26 July the Liberation Army Journal
 criticized the disorder of the camps gn.
 Significant curbs were formally promulgated by the central
 committee in a 16-point directive issued on 8 August.  According
 to the directive, strict distinction is to be made between
 persons who are loyal to the party but who have "expressed certain
 erroneous views, made certain mistakes, or written certain bad
 articles" and those who seek to undermine party control.
 Scientists and technicians are explicitly exempted from political
 abuse. Under no circumstances are students to "struggle" against
 students.   Party committees at all levels are to "encourage"
 those comrades who had committed mistakes to repent and mend their
 ways.

 B.    Effects of the Cultural Revolution
 1.               On Schools
 The "cultural revolution" has hit China's
 educational institutions especially hard.   Propaganda de-
 nunciations of "black" cultural activities have concentrated
 fire upon educational figures--who are charged with urging
 scholastic a.chievment upon their students rather than the study
 of Mao--and there have been reports of university riots and

 2,  On Educational Policy
 It is still far from clear how far Peking intends
 to push the "thorough reforms" in education promised in the 13
 June Central Committee'and State Council notice.   The only firm
 steps thus far taken have been a six-month postponement in the
 enrollment of the 1966 freshman class at universities and the
 retention of university and high~ischool students at their
 schools for indoctrination this summer.
 Since June the Peking press has published numerous
 suggestions for radical departures in enrollment procedures,
 curricula, and operating methods.  Among these suggestions,
 all attributed to students, have been recommendations that liberal
 arts and even scientific courses be shortened, that universities
 not limit admittance to those persons who have completed senior
 middle schools and that faculty titles be abandoned as were ranks
 in the armed forces.   The students are depicted as "demanding"
 that senior middle school graduates participate in manual labor
 before going on to higher education and that the half-work half-
 study system be implemented in all universities.

 The 8 August Central Committee directive endorsed such
 proposals in general terms, but their practical impact may be
 limited, since most resemble practices which were already in
 effect.      The regime has been rigorously screening new college
 entrants for political reliability for several years.  Since
 1964 it has drastically reduced study courses by assigning both
 teachers and students to long stints of manual labor and tours
 Peking claims that there has been widespread opposition to
 these party policies among university administrators.  Since
 May dozens of presidents, vice presidents and party secretaries
 of universities, such as the prestigious Peking and Wuhan
 Unviersities, have been dismissed in disgraced
 The evidence suggests that few of these officials refused
 to implement party policies, merely that they argued against them.
 It remains to be seen what procedures will actually be put
 into effect when schools reopen this fall.   If the present witch-
 hunt for heretics keeps up, the already disorganized educational
 system may be further impaired.   Some moderate passages in the
 8 August Central Committee directive on the cultural revolution,
 however, suggest that attempts will be made to restore order to
 the system.
 On Scientists and Technicians
 Scientists and technicians have come in for less
 harassment than any other segment of society.  Although Peking
 occasionally deplores the "bourgeois tendencies" of scientists,
 especially those trained abroad, the 8 August directive
 specifically enjoined party officials directing the purification
 drive not to disrupt the work of scientists and technicians.
 Attempts last winter to denigrate western scientific theories and

 urge scientists to consult Mao's works for solutions to technical
 problems almost reached campaign proportions, but these themes have
 not been prominent this summer.
 5.  On'Agricultural Policy
 The Chinese continue to be cautious in their approach
 to agriculture.   Floods and droughts have seriously damaged crops
 in many areas this year,   Under these conditions the party is

 unlikely to initiate new policies that might antagonize peasants
 and further reduce food supplies.  Although reports are occasion-
 ally received indicating that privately cultivated land has been
 reduced, such reports probably refer to restrictions imposed in
 1964 and 1965 during "four clearances' drives.

 7.   On Foreign Visitors
 No blanket ban on foreign travel to China exists but
 Peking has been curtailing the influx of foreigners since May.
 These restrictions on travel are almost certainly directly linked
 to the internal political turmoil, since personnel handling
 foreign visitors are undoubtedly being subjected to rigorous and
 thorough ideological "purification".   The Chinese,  too,  probably
 do not want to be bothered with inquisative foreigners in a
 period of political upheaval.   Peking evidently expects the
 dust to have settled by the fall, for prospective visitors are
 now being encouraged to take in autumn trade fairs and the 100th
 anniversary in November of Sun Yat sen's birth.
 C.   Youth Problems
 The presence in cities of large numbers of idle, dis-
 affected youth has been a serious social problem for several years.
 There are numerous signs that it persists.
 In one of the rare discussions of the problem in the party
 press, Peoples Daily on 31 March admitted with unusual candor
 that the regime cou d not satisfy young people's demand for
 education and that job opportunities were limited.   Conceding
 that the problem was "complex", Peoples Daily insisted, however,
 that some solution had to be found because   dle youth" were a
 fertile breeding ground of "revisionism".   It urged urban
 authorities to step up the "planned emigration" of youth to the
 countryside and to develop "street-run industry" for those left
 behind.

 III.   Foreign Affairs
 China's preoccupation with the domestic cultural
 revolution has been reflected in the sharp dropoff in Peking's
 public commentary on all developments abroad.   The little that
 has been said, moreover, follows well-established lines, and
 Peking's foreign policy still appears to be marking time.   The
 central committee plenum communique contained little but a
 perfunctory reaffirmation of foreign policy positions expounded
 on at length over the past few years, and there has been no change
 in the general tenor of recent pronouncements by Chinese officials.
 Vietnam:  Even Vietnam has been given short shrift.  For example,
 ur ng the third week in June it featured in less than three
 percent of Peking's broadcasts.  The first US attacks on North
 Vietnam's POL storage facilities did provoke a short-lived torrent
 of commentary, and Peking propagandists sought to convey the
 impression that China was more determined than ever to assist
 Hanoi in resisting this new escalation.   In reality, however,
 Peking's ambiguous statement that China was the "rear area" for
 Vietnam did not  extend previous public commitments.   Pro-
 paganda on Vietnam dropped off again sharply in August.
 The violence of Peking's reaction to the 29 June air
 strikes on Hanoi and Haiphong. did not approach that of its
 response to the August 1964 Tonkin Gulf crisis or to the start
 of regular US air attacks on North Vietnam in February 1965.
 Chinese declarations of "resolute support" for the Vietnamese,
 moreover, did not exhibit the ring of enthusiasm that marked
 similar statements on this subject a year ago, and the emphasis
 was on self-reliance by the Vietnamese.   An article in People's
 Daily on 10 July exhorted Hanoi to "rely on your own efforts, and
 your position is invincible,"  On 18 July, an editorial in the
 People's Daily referred to the possibility that all of Vietnam will
 e turns  into a US colony without specifying what China would do
 in this event.

 North Korea:  This summer there have been new indications that
 Ana  as  ost considerable ground to the Soviet. Union in
 neighboring North Korea.   The Korean Communists, long among Peking's
 staunchest supporters, have been edging toward Moscow and are
 increasingly critical of certain Chinese policies, particularly
 those dealing with Vietnam.
 Publicly, Peking and Pyongyang have avoided attacking each other
 by name, but the growing coolness in relations was pointed up at
 the ceremonies in July marking the fifth anniversary of the Chinese
 -Korean treaty of friendship and mutual assistance.   In their
 formal messages and in speeches at diplomatic receptions, the
 Chinese omitted all references to the Korean Workers Party (KWP)
 "headed by Kim I1-sung,"  This was in marked contrast to Peking's
 practice on all previous anniversaries and in contrast to the
 reference by the Koreans in their message this year to the
 "Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao-Tse-tung,"  Chinese state-
 ments on the sixteenth anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean
 war also conspicuously avoided references to the KWP and Kim.
 Pyongyang's clearest and most explicit public declar-
 ation of independence from Peking came on 12 August when Nodong
 Sinmun in a lengthy declaration of independence condemned
 un- yism" to foreign Communist parties.  Although the editorial
 did not attack the Chinese by name, it contained much thinly
 veiled criticism of Peking,   It endorsed Moscow's call for united
 bloc action.on Vietnam and-welea?iy referring to the Chinese--
 chided those who criticize a party's "independent attitude" as
 "neutralism" or "opportunism'.'.

 Peking was continuing to supply military assistance, to Pakistan,

 Peking's willingness to provide a significant quantity
 of relatively modern aircraft and armor from its modest stock
 demonstrates the value the Chinese put on their ties with
 Rawalpindi.   They apparently see this aid as the price they must
 pay to keep alive a.~marriage of convenience based largely on a
 common antipathy to India,   In the past year the Chinese have
 suffered a number-of serious setbacks in their relations with the
 Afro-Asian world, and they probably see assistance to Pakistan as
 providing them at least one important non-Communist friend.   There
 are other more tangible advantages.   The Chinese recognize that
 their military aid will lead to increased tension between Pakistan
 and India and will force New Delhi to divert forces which would
 otherwise be deployed along the sensitive Sino-Indian frontier.
 The.Chinese also know that their support causes strains between
 Ayub_and the US and complicates Soviet efforts to follow up the
 Tashkent declaration and increase Moscow's influence in the sub-
 continent.
 Diplomatic Embarrassments:   Peking was also embarrassed abroad
 by the successful  e ec  on of a member of the Chinese Trade
 Commission in Syria and by the expulsion of the Chinese charge in
 the Hague following the mysterious death of a Chinese engineer who
 apparently attempted to defect.   The engineer, a member of a
 visiting Chinese technical group, died in the Chinese chancery on
 17 July after having been abducted by Chinese goons from the
 emergency room of a Dutch hospital where he was receiving emergency
 treatment for a skull fracture and other serious injuries.   The
 case became a cause celebre which has seriously strained Sino-
 Dutch relations; The`   u ch have declared the Chinese charge
 persona non.grata and issued subpoenas to prevent the other members
 o  the engineers delegation from leaving the Netherlands until.
 the investigation of the case is completed.   The Chinese, in turn,
 Approved Igor Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP79T00826AO0110001 g050-8

 declared the Dutch charge in Peking persona non grata but refused
 to let him leave China.  He continues to be  e   un er virtual
 house arrest as a hostage for the Chinese technicians in the Hague.
 On 26 July, Miao Chen-pai, a member of the Chinese Trade
 Commission in Syria, entered the US Embassy and requested political
 asylum.      Peking has still not commented publicly on this defection,
 although reports of the case have appeared in the Western press.
