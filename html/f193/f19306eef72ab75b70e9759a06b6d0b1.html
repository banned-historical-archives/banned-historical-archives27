1,!ASHINGTON POST 
22 June 1975 
asas 
? 
By George Lardner Jr. 
Wfisbington Post Stsff Writer 
s" The Central Intelligence AgencY. 
: conducted a hurried, cursory check oft 
.CIA misdeeds in the vvake of thei 
.Watergate scandal, failed to tell the 
_White House of its findings and de-
stroyed some of the records of ita 
,gal activities. 
CIA Director William E. Colby 'said': 
ehe ordered the destruction of various 
". CIA files in 1973, but said he regarded 
?it as a routine step at the time. 
. "Even before 1973, prior to that 
time," Colby said, "people had been 
tburning up collections -of files that we 
really had nu business oWning. This is 
a. natural process of any bureaucracy." 
Now, with the benefit of hindsight, 
Colby said he recognizes that he 
"should have reported the missteps to 
!the Justice Department, that the old 
standards which made the CIA virtu-. 
ally sacrosanct have slipped away.. ." '! 
e The CIA director discussed these.t, 
matters in an hour-long interview in 
his 7th-floor suite at the agency's head- : 
'quarters Friday, coupling candid ad- . 
missions with repeated expressions of 
conceril about the hazards of unaccus-a 
iomed public exposure. 
r In. Colby's view, there? has been toot 
much publicity already. The agency,t 
he insisted, has served the country far, 
.better than it realizes., . at. 
But Colby acknowledged, too, that 
even he had no clear idea Of the abuses 
lurking in its past until the investiga-
tion by the Rockefeller commission 
was completed this month. Even more 
sweeping congressional inquiries lie' 
ahead. - 
' The seeds were planted on May 
1973, when then-CIA Director James 11.. 
'Schlesinger sent a memorandum to all,.
'employees calling- for immediate re-
ports on any questionable activitiesa 
past or present, that they might know; 
about. ? 
, The impetus for.the directive cane-
from the Watergate scandal. The 1971. 
tEllsbera case, burglary, which G. Gor-
don LicrdY and E. Howard Hunt Jr. car-
ried out with CIA technical assistance,. 
had just come to light,' and Schlesinger 
,said he intended to do all he could "to 
econfine CIA activities to those which: 
*fall within a strict interpretation of its 
legislative charter." 
The result, Colby agreed, was a rush 
'job that could not even be called a 
'genuine. investigation. The CIA inspec-
tor general's office, which handled the , 
*assignment, submitted a report just 11 
days later, on May 21, 1973. . 
d "It was an accumulation rather .an
Alum an investigation, if you get. the'. 
_distinction," Colby said. 'In other, 
words, the Schlesinger memo went to 
'all employees. Well, the first employ-
ees it went to, was the' roininftTvd 
And the command line basically 
ported what it heard down through the, 
regular hierarchy: what do you know, 
what do you know,? what do you , 
know. And that was gathered together 
and given to the inspector gAppxprA 
_ 
. "In addition," Colby said, "few em-
- ployees went to the inspector general 
.with something they remembered. But 
. ... inspector general didn't go out and 
look through every, file drawer in the 
place or anything like that." 
The report included a. section on as-
sassination plots and -schemes.. Other 
:portions were just. a rehash of "old ins' 
spector general reports that CIA offi-
cials pulled .out of their desks, appar-
ently including information on testing 
LSD on Unsuspecting subjects, part of 
.a controversial program . that lasted. 
:from 1953 to 19b3. 
The White House was not informed,. 
but not, by Colby's account, because of. 
any preoccupation with the Watergate 
:scandal. The day after Schlesinger 
wrote his May 9, 1973, memo, President 
Nixon nominated him to become Secre-
tary of Defense, and Colby, who was 
,then CIA deputy director for covert 
operations, was named to take over the. 
spy agency. 
"This one does embarrass me a bit," 
Colby said of the failure to notify the 
White House. "I think What happened, 
quite frankly, is that it fell between 
the t tools?of Schlesinger's leaving 
and my taking over. I imagine he 
ttisougat mayne i was g,omg to take 
care of the National Security Council 
[the White House agency which is sup-
posed to supervise the CIA] and I lane 
_agine that I thought he was." . . 
The Justice Department also was ' 
kept in the dark by virtue of a long- , 
standing agreemerit, disclosed and dee' 
nounced by the Rockefeller commis-
Sion, to let the CIA decide whether a , 
I crime had been committed by its em-
ployees or agents and whether security 
considerations precluded prosecution 
even when a crime had taken place. 
es Organized in January with the in-
spector general's 1973 report as one of . 
its basic primers, the commission con-
-eluded this month that the CIA had 
,engaged in "plainly unlawful" conduct 
?from burglary through bugging to 
the LSD ,testing and other activities. 
But .Colby indicated that he never 
even contemplated going to the Justice 
Department at the time. 
; "In retrospect, I would say yes, I 
should have," the 55-year-old Colby ac-
knowledged. "No question about it, we 
'Should have done it." 
? Colby said he first reached that coo-
' elusion "sometime in December"?
which was the month that The New. 
York Times disclosed some of the ac-
etivities recounted in the 1973 report.. 
. The CIA director said he realized that 
'month that "I do have an obligation to 
actually carry down to the Departmont 
'of Justice and let them make the deci-
sion as to whether anything should be , 
, 
prosecuted or not." 
.Afterconferring with Schlesingera 
? 
. _ 
? Capitol Hill, Colby said he briefed 
'both Rep. Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.) and 
Sen. John C. Stennis (D-Miss.), the 
? chairmen of the Senate and House sub-
committees in charge of CIA oversight, 
.in late May, 1973, on the agency's ime 
Proprieties. But clearly, Colby agrees 
.now, "that isn't enough." - ? 
' Now chairman of the speCial House 
-committee investigating the CIA, 
Nedzi, who has recently tome under 
fire for taking no action two years ago, 
"asked a lot of additional questions," 
-Colby retailed, but was apparently sat-
lafied with the answers he .got and did. 
not inform his colleagues. .not'? 
s Colby did no characterize Stennis' 
:reaction, but he has long been a stolid' 
i.defender of the CIA. Apparently both 
'-he and Nedzi accepted Colby's assur-
arices that corrective action ? would be 
taken. 
No follow-up investigation was con-- 
tducted, including within the CIA, to 
whcthc: any cf thz-. 
ties warranted prosecution or to find 
:mit how extensive they actually were.: 
Repeatediy, Colby emphasized that his-
'mind was on the future, on making 
..sure they didn't happen again. 
'`,;? He said he issued "specific instrucs 
-tions with respect to each of the catee 
-tgories of activities included in the in-
?spector general's report? on Aug. 29,. 
4973, banning some, laying down strict 
-rules for others and declaring still oth-
ers permissible. 
a Concerning the CIA's "following of 
!people around in America," Colby said, 
?.tfor example, he "issued a directive say?
ting 'you won't do that any more' la.... Ipoint'rfrankly didn't care at that point' 
whether it was 20 eases or' 40 cases. The 
fact was there weren't going to be any 
more." 
The Rockefeller commission found 
more instances of burglary, bugging, 
and other misdeeds than he was aware 
of, Colby indicated. Another reason for, 
the escalating statistics, he said, was 
the fact that he agreed with the com-
mission at the outset that the CIA 
Would not interview former employees 
to avoid any suggestion that the 
agency .was trying to influence their 
testimony. 
t Consequently, Colby said, "the com-
mission knows more than I 
do . . . There's a couple of cases, a 
couple of incidents mentioned [in the 
commission report] that I didn't know 
about. I don't. challenge the fact that 
they happened. Put they're not in our 
records.", 
'' The commission also said in its re 
ciAlt.leaSe 40011,0 rabet4R0 R77-000/14 
6.9*-wlfivicowds had been 
r ere eVroYeenn 1973, including 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100370007-0 
-152 separate files on the drug-testing 
? 
4progretn. 
Colby said he had various documents 
destroyed, and indicated that the drug-
testing records were among them. ? . 
"We had files around here we 
ehouldn't own, some of these surveil-
.lance things and stuff like that," he. 
said, "and I had directed, `let's get rid 
of that stuff,' in 19'73." Colby recalled. 
that former CIA Director Richard M. 
Helms tack a. 'similar step with tapes. 
he had on leaving the agency in Janu-
ary, 1973. ? . ? 
. .1 
"He [Helms] said it didn't have any-
thing to do with Watergate, (that] he 
was just getting rid of all this junk 
people collect, you know," Colby said. 
Asked whether he now felt that the 
documents he ordered destroyed 
should have been sent to the Justice 
p.De artment in 1973 along with the in-
.spector ? ? general's findings, Colby 
paused and said softly, "I guess, 
..maybe. I don't know." Then he added 
that not all should have gone to Jus-
tice, since ? some of the incidents were 
rather flimsy, but other documents, he 
agreed, probably Should have been 
sent. over. . 
The Justice Department is studying 
the evidence compiled by the Rockefel-
ler commission, concerning both do-
mestic spying and CIA involvement in 
assassination plots, to determine 
whether any prosecutions ? should be 
undertaken. - 
Colby said he was confident that no 
CIA employees will be indicted be-
cause, he said, he fells, they were act-
ing under the belief that whatever 
they did, while perhaps ' "technically" 
illegal, was permissible "in the course 
of their dutieS." 
Among Colby's August, 1973, &raw 
tives was an order that the 'CIA will 
not engage in assassination nor induee, 
assist or suggest, to others that assas-
sination be employed," but he said an 
earlier ban had been issued by Helms 
in March 1972, three months before 
the Watergate break-in. 
Asked what prompted the Helms 
edict, Colby said it was issued because 
of the heavy amount of publicity stem-
ming from Colby's 1971 congressional 
testimony on Operation Phoenix in 
South Vietnam, which critic's chnrged 
relied -heavily on torture and assas-
sination. 
The 1972 directive, ColbY said, was 
written "just to make clear what his 
[Helms] policy and my policy were ... 
to clarify the records so that it's clear 
what our policy was." 
The Helms order was not widely dis-
seminated, however. Neither the White 
House nor congressional . overseers 
were told about it at the time, Colby 
said. Even the CIA's general counsel 
TI-IE VDT: TIMES, FRI.134 Y, ? .).?T '2;?, 
in 1972, Lawrence Houston, who is ilon! - 
retired, said he never heard of it until 
it .was publicly disclosed several dates 
ago.. 
Voicing high praise for the CIA aal` 
its employees de:mita the cureent furor, 
Colby said he has no Idea when tne 
investigations will end, but made plaid 
? that he hopes they will close down as 
\quickly as possible. 
. "I think anyless dedicated group oZ 
people would have all flown away 
long ago, but this is an enormously 
? highly Motivated, dedicated, talentad 
:group of people," Colby said. "Our in-
telligence is the best in the world.". 
Unquestionably, Colby said, the CIA 
made mistakes, but he called this the 
result of an old tradition that its worir 
was not supposed to be talked about 
a climate that no longer exists. 
"If you let any large organization 
-operate without controls and without 
supervision, it will get in some trou-
ble," Colby said, but even so, he said, 
"the country's been well served by 
this agency and I think it will be well 
served by it in the future, ? even. 
better." 
any case, Colby said with a grin, 
he plans to "tear up" a lot more files 
? as soon as investigators are done with 
them. 
Have a bonfire? he was asked. 
"Damn right," the CIA director said, 
pointing out the windows to the closely 
guarded 219-acre site. "Right out 
.there." 
Colby Says 
WASHINGTON, June 19 (AP). 
?William E. Colby, Director 
of Central Intelligence, said to-
day that over the years foreign-
?ers. had suggested assassina-
tions-to him and United States 
Government employes had dis-
cussed the possibility of assas-
sinations with him, but that 
he had rejected the ideas every 
time. ' 
The 55-year-old head of the 
'United States spy agency de-
clined to name the suggested 
or potential targets or the per: 
sons who had-made the sugges-
tions. Nor would he give the 
'dates or locations of these con-
versations. 
Mr. Colby said that he op-
posed public disclosure of factsi 
behind th these or other alleged 
assassination schemes involv7 
ing the C.I.A. because "I think 
there is positive harm to the 
reputation of the country to; 
go into great detail on these' 
things." ? 1 
' He said, "Our policies today' 
are clear . .? I am opposed 
to assassinations because 
think they're wrong and be-
cause I think they frequentlyi 
bring about absolutely uncon-1 
rolled and unforeseeable re-I 
suits .? usually worse re?sultsl 
than by continuing to suffer 
the problem that you're .fac-
ing." ?

Mr. Colby discussed a wide

'points in the .first. interview

in this country justified their 
? violating the legal limits on 
.the agency's domestic activity.

any C.I.A. employes will be 
convicted of crimes or even 
prosecuted for illegal activities. 
He cannot be certain that

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, June 30, 1975 
* * * ?

/TN AN ERA of budding detente the , 
1.11 clandestine operations of the KGB.: 
iand CIA are an anachronism. Even so, 
both sides will continue to engage In y 
!secret political warfare and espionage 
.as long as the other side conducts such 
operations. But the decline of the Cold 
..War and technological advances in in-
vfonnation-gathering clearly challenge 
ethe validity of. these operations. The 
time has come to add this subject to 
the agenda of U.S.-Soviet negotiations 
toward the goal of phasing out the 
clandestine functions of both the KGB 
and CIA.. 
For years Washington and Moseow 
have used the clandestine operations 
of the other side as a sort of litmus 
paper to measure true- intentions. A 
U.S. President or a Soviet Communist 
?Party secretary might talk of peace, 
'but the knowledge of on-going clandes-
tine operations is always hard evi-
dence of the other side's continuing 
"ag.e4reneiva intentions. Tlus,tnt inAtee. 
(ties of the KGB and the CIA reinforce 
ithe continuity of each other. If the 
?Soviets are going to conduct secret 
political action and espionage, then we 
'should, too. - 
J Yet, General Secretary Leonid 
Xrezhney says time and again that "the 
:Process of detente is irreversible." De-
.itente means a relaxation of tensions 
for the purpose of reducing the possi-
bility of war. But the clandestine opera-
tions of the CIA and KGB manifestly 
increase tensions. They are,a form of 
warfare. 
:KGB Blunders ? 
IF THESE CLANDESTINE programs 
were achieving important foreign 
policy gains for either the U.S.S.R. or 
,the U.S., then their continuation, 
;though debatable, would be under-. 
standable. But that is not the case. 
The KGB has had very few political 
warfare successes in recent years. The 
same is true of the CIA, unless the 
"destabilization" of the Chilean gov-
ernment is considered a success. The 
U-2 incident, ,the Bay of Pigs and the 
CIA failure in Vietnam have been 
highly publicized, but less is known 
about some of the reversals for So-
viet foreign policy, caused by the KGB. 
For example: 
? In early 1969 there were a num-
ber Of serious military incidents on 
the Sino-Soviet border. The S;2.fiets 
demanded that the Chinese sit down 
at the negotiating table to settle the 
matter, but the Chinese refused. In 
? 
. 
Sino-Soviet affairs., Soon there was a. 
story in the American press indicating 
that the Soviets were considering a 
- pre-emptive nuclear strike against 
China. In September a story appeared 
in the London Evening News signed 
by Victor Louis, undoubtedly the most 
publicized of all KGB operatives,which 
-speculated about a Soviet strike to elim-
inate Chinese nuclear bases.- These 
stories were followed by a flurry of 
news items, datelined from Hong Kong 
to Helsinki, about Soviet aggressive 
.intentions against China. 
In December, 1969, under a headline 
saying "Chinese Communists Appear 
to Expect a Russian Attack," Joseph 
Alsop reported that long-stalled talks 
dealing with border incidents were 
proceeding between the Soviets. and 
Chinese. "It is perfectly clear," he 
wrote, "that .the Chinese only con-
serted to talk at all because of Soviet 
threats.._. . The language of the Chin-
:Tx annnuneeinent -o.L' the talks quite 
openly implied that there had been 
Soviet threats of an extremely crude 
and brutal kind.' 
So the KGB operation succeeded in 
pressuring the Chinese to resume the 
talks, but it also alarmed the Chinese 
leaders so Much that they signaled in-
terest in secret negotiations with the 
U.S. Soon there was ping-pong diplo-
macy, and not long thereafter Henry 
Kissinger was on the way. to the break-
through which led to President Nixon's 
visit to China, the beginning of more 
friendly U.S.-Chinese relations , and 
membership- for- China in _the United 
Nations. Surely, no development in 
recent history has been a greater set-
back for Soviet foreign policy. 
In 1955 and '56 Secretary of State 
John Foster Dulles turned down the 
? \ 
appeals of Egyptian President Abdel 
Nasser for U.S., arms aid and help in 
building the Aswan dam. So the So-
viets filled the vacuum and. their re-
lations with the Egyptians became very 
, close. 
'..11owever, things began to change 
when Nasser died in 1970 and was suc-
ceeded by Anwar Sadat. Sadat was 
neither pro-Soviet nor anti-Western,. 
but he was very much of an Egyptian 
nationalist. He showed such independ-
ence that the Soviets began to worry 
whether they_weuld have sufficient po-
litical influence to protect their vast 
in-sestment in Egypt. By. the spring 
of 1971 the Soviets were so alarmed 
that they instructed the KGB to art;range a coup to eliminate Sadat from 
August Boris Dayid ov, a senior KGB povve 
officer in the Washington errtAiwol,*id For Rtiteasttt2001146408 toQJAA:47:7-004421*0049314837000A-Qo crucial Soviet 
lunch with an American sp"alEfist in s) foreign policy objectives, the KGB 
moved swiftly to arrest more than 90, 
? r 
plotters. He was astounded to discover' 
that his trusted chief of intelligence, 
Sami Sharaf, was a KGB agent. The 
KGB had begun cultivating Sharaf in 
1955, and by 1959 he had emerged as 
the de facto chief, of Egyptian intelli-
gence. By 1967 he had become Nasser's 
closest adviser. Sharaf was the key. 
KGB agent in the plot against Sadat. 
; After the failure of the attempted 
:coup it looked as though Soviet Middle 
East policy would collapse. The Soviets 
were so desperate that they presented 
,Sadat with a 15-year Treaty of Friend-
ship, pledging to stay -out of the in-
ternal affairs of Egypt and agreeing 
to provide vast quantities of weapons. 
.Later, even after Sadat had expelled 
110,000 Russian technicians, the So-
viets continued to send planes, tanks 
and ground-to-air missiles. 
Sadat accepted anything he could 
!get until he had achieved his purpose 
;in the 1973 Yom Kippur War with Is-
rael. However, he has not forgotten 
how close the KGB came to ending 
his career. This explains, in part, the 
restoration of U.S.-Egyptian diplomatic 
relations and Sadat's extraordinarily 
,friendly talks with Kissinger and now 
Mr. Ford. ' 
; ? In the years after World War II 
the Soviets' greatest concern was 
that German rearmament might lead 
,to a. Bonn attempt to take over East 
Germany and Berlin?and to war. But 
then Willy Brandt emerged as Chan-
cellor of the Federal Republic with 
his Ostpolitik.. The most important 
step in the policy, designed to pro-
mote relaxation of tensions with the 
Soviet bloc, was Bonn's recognition 
of Pankow as a separate, independent 
nation, - marking the abandonment 
once and-for all of the concept of a 
reunited Germany. General Secretary 
Brezhnev vigorously supported all 
elements of the Ostpolitik, but espe-
cially Bonn's recognition of East 
Germany, , 
-Under the circumstances Brandt's 
sudden decision to resign must have 
come as a stunning blow to the 
Kremlin. And yet Brandt resigned be-
cause of the discovery that one of his 
highest ranking assistants, Gunter 
Guillaume, was a Spy. What happened 
is now amply on the record: 
. In .1956 the East German intelli-
gence service, which for years had 
been directed by the KGB, sent Gull-
lauine to West Germany. Posing as an 
escapee from communism, he did re-
markably well?for himselt and for 
his bosses. In 17 years he progressed 
from running a wurst and flower stand 
to the position of personal assistant 
to the federal chancellor. Despite

to imagine what would have happen-' 
.ed had Brandt's successor rejected 
his Ostpo/itile, 
? 
Electronic Intelligence 
TrillE EGYPTIAN AND German 
X. stories illustrate the fact of in-
telligence life that spy operations can 
be conducted with remarkable success 
? over aslong period of time?and yet end 
up having disastrous or potentially dis-
astrous results for policy. It is 
? clear that, in an era when negotiation 
is supposed to be replacing Cold War 
confrontation, the clandestine operations 
of' the KGB and CIA are archaic. They 
are hostile, provocative acts running' 
'counter to the professed objectives of' 
the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. 
Of course, good intelligence will. 
continue to be important for both 
sides'-But intelligence data does not 
have to be obtained through espion-
age. 
Strategic intelligence nf utmost int.: 
portance can now be obtained through' 
technological, rather than human, 
means; We are able to observe Soviet 
medium, intermediate and interconti-
nental range ballistic missile tests . 
through the use of radar and .clecd 
tronic interception of telemetry sign 
nals. We- know what they have tested 
and what they have not tested. 
Through seismic and acoustic re-
ceivers we know the size and location 
of all their nuclear tests. Through, 
the precision cameras of space recona. 
'naissance we know the size and loca-i 
tion of their missile silos. 
For years We have known how big,' 
.and approximately how accurate, their 
missiles are?and how many they. 
have. We are able,- via sonar .and ?the, 
er sophisticated devices and tech-
niques( to track ? their missile-firing 
submarines. 
The miracles of high-flying camerae, 
which can photOgraph the entire 
-U.S.S.R. in a few days, . combined 
. with the ?information obtained from 
electronic' interception, radar and. 
computers, provide us with much more 
accurate intelligence than we had. 
:available when espionage was ram-
pant at the' height of the Cold War. 
In fact, in an era of strategic parity-
or essential equivalence it is, impera: 
dive that both sides have excellent in-
formation about the capabilities -of the 
other. That is the only way the bal-
ance of deterrence can work. 
In , the interim SALT agreement 
signed i.n Moscow in 1972, both sides 
acknowledged the importance of space 
reconnaissance as an essential means 
of verifying that the terms of the 
agreement are fulfilled. If the Soviets - 
had not developed accurate space re-
connaissance of their own, it would 
have been in our interest to make' - 
such facilities availalale to them. If , 
both sides intend to limit strategic 
arms, it will be essential that inform- -' 
lion about the systems of eaen be 
open, not secret. 
There remain, for example, problems 
about verifying the limit on the num-
The high-flying cameras can locate the 
missile silos, .but if the silo is covered, 
the cameras cannot determine whether-
the missile within it has multiple war- 
-heads. One solution is simply to as-
.sume that all categories of missiles 
successfully tested with multiple war-
heads will be so equipped when placed 
in the silo. 
Since the days of the McCarthy era 
and the national hysteria over corn-. 
inunist penetration and spies there 
has remained in this country- an ex-
aggerated sense of the threat of the 
-KGB. Even if the FBI were not doing 
its job, there are very fear vital secrets 
for the KGB in the United States. We 
want the Soviets to have a very thor-
ough understanding of our strategic 
strength. That is the point of deter-. 
-rence. 
Code machines and computers have 
made our codes and cryptographic 
systems virtually impenetrable. Our 
war plans are supposed to be secret, 
but a careful reading of the annual 
Defense Department posture state-
ment, the congressional hearings and 
the technological journals 'gives any 
trained observer most of the essential 
data. There are diploMatic secrets, 
but those secrets -arc very short-lived,, 
usually valid only during the period 
of negotiation. 
Secrecy Hurts 
ACTUALLY, SECRECY. is often an' 
impediment to national security in a 
democracy. In 1970 the Pentagon asked. 
its Defense Science. Board to estab-
. 
lisle a =tr. :tore& to study the effects 
of the secrecy system. The, board-
concluded that as,much as 90 p,er cent 
of classified scientific and technical 
defense information should not be so 
designated. The board members es-
timated that most secret information 
would become known within .a year. 
They noted that excessive' secrecy 
tended to stifle inventiveness and use-
ful research in weapons systems. 
One member said, "If present trends 
continue for another decade our na-
tional effort in weapons research will 
become little better than mediocre." 
Another member concluded that, 
,"while secrecy is an effective instru-
ment in a closed society,, it is -much. 
less effective in an open society in 
the long run; instead, the open society, 
, 
-should recognize that openness is eine 
*of its strongest weapons." 
The U. S. Moon program was open;' 
'the Soviets' was secret. It was the U.S. 
'which landed on the moon. 
As in the Past, most essential informa-
tion will continue to come from open 
sources. The technological means for 
information-gathering will provide most 
of the additional required material. Of 
course, there will also be a continuing 
'guest for information by diplomatic es- 
tablishments. Just as newspaper report.; 
ers have confidential sources, so dip-
lemats will have confidential sources. 
-Whether the diplomat is called a KGB 
,or CIA officer era fol:cigx-L'ervirr.: off 
i-
cer makes little difference. If he is part 
of the diplomatic establishment he has 
,the same privileges and the same risks 
. of being made persona non grata. , 
and the reerUitment of agent!! within' 
.the opposing government: The latter 
is a much more provocative -and hostile 
action. When discovered, stick ,acts 
sharply increase tensions. In a time 
:when both sides are advocating detente, 
,the risks of developing a Penkovsky, .or 
Philby outweigh the benefits-. 
Now it will be said that the Soviets?
'because they have a. closed society, a 
police' state and an ideology which ad-
vocates conspiracy?will never give up 
their clandestine operations. Perhaps .so, 
but if we intend to move ahead with a 
growing detente, now is the time to 
find out. 
It must be anticipated that there. will 
be vigorous opposition in the Kremlin, 
both bureaucratic and doctrinal. Never-
theless, Brezhnev and his fellow polit-
buro members have demonstrated that 
their advocacy of detente may be over-
'riding. In the struggle for power. in 
the Kremlin the politburo has ousted 
Shelest and Shelepin, both anti-detente 
hawks. It is worth noting that Shelepin 
was a former chief of the KGB. Brezh-
nev and the others know that the KGB 
bee made serious blunders and has some- 
-times set back Soviet foreign policy. o 
Phasing Out Spying 
'rliFIERE IS A LONG history of nego-
Il. tiations between the US. and-So-
Nies in the field of clandestine opera-
tions, but never an attempt to negotiate 
a broad reduction. There have been 
many spy exchanges, some of them high-
.iy publicized, such as the swap of -Col. 
Rudolf 4.--bel for IT-9 pilot :Ty 
There have been' deals about provocative' 
"black" radio broadcasts, and Soviet 
jamniing has been reduced as inflamma-
tory political commentary has been 
phased out. 
Political warfare and espionage, like 
..strategic missiles, form a eubject- for 
negotiation. One technique that has 
-worked before is to announce that we 
are unilaterally phasing out certain Op-
erations and will be carefully watching 
to see whether the Soviets follow suit. 
This was the technique used by Preei-
dent Kennedy which led to. the partial 
nuclear test-ban agreement. 
As the ,phase - out proceeded both 
sides would verify the implementation 
of the arrangements through the tech-
'niques of counter-espionage. The FBI 
.would have responsibility within' the 
U.S., while CIA counter-espionage and 
liaison with friendly foreign intelli-
gence services would bear responsibil-
ity abroad. The KGB counter-espio-
nage system would obviously monitor. 
.whether the U.S. was carrying out its 
side of the bargain. . ' 
Once the dialogue begins, all sorts 
of possibilities will come into view. 
There will, as noted, be strong resist-
ance by the hawks on both sides., If 
.the Soviets are unwilling to go along, 
it is important that we should know 
that, especially in these days of reVievi 
'of the role of the CIA, But if we have

NEWSDAY 
13 Jun 1975 
On the surface are charges of assassination plots and illegal 
deeds, 8ut -underneath, there is' an everyday human side.: 
Jane Morse 
Newsday S...te.ff Correspondent 
_ . 
ntil quite recently, one of the few prov-
able facts known about the cloaked and. 
secretive Central Intelligence Agency is 
that its headquarters are in Langley, 
1.7a., just outside WaShington. Current 
probes of the. organization suggest, however, that 
it may be a way out, and that anything at all could 
be going on there. 
Indeed it is. - . 
Although the knitting and crocheting club has 
actiourned for the est.n.---cea the 60-voice eherres ece-r-
t.lnues to hold once-a-week practice sessions, the 
grand slam bridge club hairegular -duplicate games 
every Tuesday at 6:15 and .the Bible study deal 
gets together twice a week at midday. 
The fact is that behind the shadowy,. faceless 
say facade and in the midst of recent revelations 
and investigations, there exists a not-so-faceless 
bunch of individtsile linked by federal-style bu-
reaucracy that's complete with a hyperactive em-
ployee activities association, a private washroom 
for the director, a credit union and a ? car pool. It 
has, as well, carved-in-marble a testimonial to honor 
31 of its people killed in the line of duty, a clinic 
set up with the specialized equipment needed for 
the prompt treatment of heart attack victims (some-
thing that's required with startling regularity it is 
said),. and a "helping hand" fund that takes up 
voluntary, anonymous collections to help staff anent,-
bars in need.. . 
Nonetheless, these . days, anyone who veers off 
the highway after the sign that says "CIA Next

The Tare visiting outsider would find that wInt's 
inside is a magnificently wooded, 213.1-acre campus; 
?and campus is what its called. Like most cam-
puses it's a little short on -clerking, but that's partly 
because Allen Dulles, who was the agency director 
when the new headquarters were built, had strong. 
feelings about frees. 
"He'd say, `Gee, 
tie something around it to mark it for saving, even 
if it had to be moved. I figure he cost us something 
like 250 parking spaces," an associate recalls.. 
Dulles hired the architectural firms of Harrison 
and Abramowitz and Frederic R. King, reportedly 
outmaneuvering the General Services. Administra-

murdered last week, and an investiga-

if he didn't wonder about the C.I.A. 
Mr. Giancana was killed in his

in and around his head, but no wit-

ssassindion Plot ThcLt Failed 
Of all the charges of wrongdoing by 
the Central intelligence Agency, the most 
disturbing arc those that implicate the 
agency in plots to assassinate foreign nil-
ers who were deemed inimical to U.S. in-
terests. Among the putative targets were 
Congolese Nationalist. Leader Patrice* 
Luntztrnba and Dominican Republic Dic-
tator Rafael Trujillo, who were assassi-
nated in 1961; South Viet Nam Presi-
dent Ngo Dinh Diem, who Was murdered 
in 1963; and Cuban Premier Fidel Cas-
tro. The allegations are being investigated 
by a Senate committee, which last week 
continued to question past and present 
CIA officers about the alleged plots. At 
TIME'S request, Charles J. V. Murphy, a 
former editor and Washington 
correspondent of FORTUNE, 
talked with his long-time sourc-
es in the U.S. intelligence field 
about the charges and sent this 
report: 
The suspicion is that two 
Presidents?Dwight Eisen-
hower and John Kennedy 
?authorized or condoned foul 
plots by the CIA to do in sev-
eral foreign leaders. Democrat-
ic Senator Frank Church of 
Idaho, who heads the Senate 
investigating committee, has 
claimed to have "herd evi-
dence.' of the agency's com-
plicity but nothing that would 
implicate any President. Still, 
in the singular relationship of 
the agency to presidential au-
thority, evidence of a CIA as-
sassination plot would seem to 
implicate one President or the 
other, even both, unless, of 
course, the CIA had become a 
Jaw unto itself. What the 
Rockefeller commission report 
revealed was "in all likelihood 
just the tip of the iceberg." ac-
cording to Church. The real 
likelihood is that so far as the 
actual assassinations are con-
cerned, there was never much 
more to this floating body than 
a deceptively shimmering tip. 
Castro, however, was another 
matter. The n3ency version or 
the charges is this: 
TRUJILLo. Former senior 
officers of the CIA maintain that neither 
the agency nor Presidents Eisenhower 
or Kennedy had anything directly to do 
with the dictator's death. Officials in the. 
American embassy had tried to per-
suade Trujillo to resign to end the do-
mestic unrest that the U.S. feared might 
make the country ripe for Communism. 
They had also been gingerly in touch 
with leaders of the political opposition 
and as a token ofsthe American interest 
in seeing a change. had provided one 
faction with three rifles. A group of sev-
en or eight men ambushed Trujillo on 
the road from' hiS honse to the presi-
dential palace. Whether any of the U.S.-
supplied rifles were used in the killing 
has never been determined to the se-
nior CIA men's satisfaction. -

ported him with money and arms in the 
contest to take the former Belgian Con-
go out of the West's orbit. While the 
CIA supported President MoTse Tshombe 
of Katang,a against Lumumba, it had no 
part in Lumurriba's arrest and murder 
by Katanganese soldiers. He was a ca-
sualty of African tribal politics. 
DIEM. The coup against Diem was 
planned with the knowledge of Dean 
-Rusk and Averell Harriman at the State 
Department, Robert S. McNamara and 
Roswell Gilpatric at the Defense De-
partment and the late Edward R. Mar-
row at the U.S. Information Agency. 
The U.S. hoped Diem's overthrow would 
halt the domestic turmoil that had weak-
ened South Viet Narn. But the CIA's di-
rector, john A. McCone. vigorously op-
posed the overthrow of Diem on the 
reasoning that none of the generals en-
listed in the coup would be half as ef-
fective a leader as the man they wanted 
to bring down. After the coup, Diem was 
murdered. Former senior CIA officials 
insist that the slaying was the private 
work of the Vietnamese generals' junior 
officers and was done without the U.S. 
Government's foreknowledge. 
CASTRO. Though Castro is still alive, 
it is not because the CIA did not con-
sider various ways of doing him' in. The 
det:an on the "maximum leader's" life 
burgeoned over a span ofsoase two years 
into a corpus of schemes. As best the 
principals remember, the idea first 
emerged in the late spring or early sum-
mer of 1960 as a simple, even simple-
minded plot to poison Castro's-food or 
slip him a poisoned cigar. By some ac-
counts, the notion originated with a se-
nior officer in the agency's Western 
Hemisphere division whose ideas inter-
OS STOREY ested Colonel Sheffield Ed-
wards, director of the agency's 
Office of Security. Edwards 
passed the idea on to Deputy 
Director for Plans Richard M. 
Bissell Jr. 
He instructed Edwards to 
explore the feasibility of the 
project. For help, Edwards 
turned to a former FBI agent 
and. later Howard Hughes as-
sociate, Robert A. Maheu. 
? Matieu, then a private consul-
? tant and investigator, was be-
lieved to have a line to Mafia 
interests that, had operated 
gambling casinos in Havana. 
Through the connection, Ed-
wards sought to find out 
whether the Mafia could pro-
duce, if need be, a man in Ha-
vana in a position to liquidate 
Castro. 
- Through Chicago Mafia 
Chieftain Sam Giancana, who 
was murdered last week in his 
suburban Chicago home, and 
his lieutenant. John Roselli, 
?. the da recruited a gangster re-
puted to be in Castro's eatou-
rage of bullyboys. In late Sep-
tember I3issell and Edwards 
informed Director Allen Dul-
les of the results of their ten-
with Dulles was in the most 
general terms: he was merely 
encouraged to test the ground 
. further. 
? ? ; The medical section of the 
CIA produced some exotic pills and even 
"fixed" a box of fine Havana cigars. The 
cigars seem never to have left the lab-
oratory, but the pills ware turned over 
to the Mafia. The would-be assassin was 
to have been paid S150,000 if he suc-
ceeded; some earnest money, "a few 
thousand dollars," was turned over to 
him. Giancana and Roselli expected 
something more important than money: 
both were under investigation by the De-
partment of justice and hoped to escape 
prosecution. In due course, the pills 
moved to Miami but no farther. 
No one seems to know why nothing 
happened. Perhaps the man in Havana 
got cold feet. Or he may have been eased 
out of his former close proximity to Cas-
tro. By some accounts, Giancana and 
Roselli found a replacement for the orig-
inal assassin and turned the pills over 
to him. The substitute later claimed to 
have put two separate three-man teams 
of infiltrators ashore in Cuba. If he did, 
nothing more was ever heard of them. 
There is. a further mystery as well. 
It would scarcely have been in charac-
ter for Dulles to proceed in such a del-
icate, potentially notorious enterprise 
without Eisenhower's sanction or at 
least the authorization of the National 
Security Council. But there is no record 
of such authority. 
Prebhetss of One of -Die-
seas senior lieutenants in the Cuba busi-
ness later stated he was advised by Bis-
sell on two different occasions that the 
plan had White House authority. Bissell 
claims to have no memory of making 
such a statement. But he has also said he 
would not dispute his colleague's mem-
ory. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller 
has described "a real problem of a .mne-
sia" that 'pervadesthe recollection of the 
principals still alive. Bissell swore an 
oath to keep secret whatever they were 
called upon to do in the national inter-
est. In their view, amnesia may well be 
another word for integrity in these times 
of damaged vocabularies. 
With the advent of the Kennedy Ad-
ministration, the CIA plainly assumed 
that the new President would favor the 
enterprise against Castro. In February 
1961 Bissell brought a new personality 
into the plan: a CIA officer. named Wil-
liam K. Harvey. Long retired and liv-
ing now in Indianapolis, Harvey was a 
pear-shaped . fellow with a. swinging 
stride. An intelligence officer of the di-
rect-action school, he habitually carried 
a revolver in his belt. 
Bissell charged Harvey with the re- - 
sponsibility for preparing the ground for 
what in the jargon of the intelligence 
trade is called an "executive action." 
That is the term for an action calcu-
lated to neutralize an adversary. The 
means may include defamation of char-
acter by propaganda or luring a leader - 
out of his post of influence with the 
nromise of a fine villa on the Cote d'Azur 
and a bottomless Swiss bank account. 
The form, in theory, also includes as-
sassination, though the CIA possessed no 
machinery for this kind of executive ac-
tion. Harvey had no authority to act,

of Pigs in April 1961 Dulles and Bissell 
both left the agency. They were succeed-
ed by McCone as director and Richard 
M. Helms as deputy director for plans. ? 
Helms, who had known nothing about 
the schemes against Castro until he suc-
ceeded Bissell, did not inform McCone 
about them until some months after Mc-
Cone took charge. His reasoning: "Har-
vey was merely looking into various pos-
sibilities. If he came up with anything 
realistic, that would be the time to both-
er John with the decision." 
By then, of course, the Mafia con-
nection was dormant, but a blunder 
threatened to blow its cover a year later. 
because of an unrelated bit of skuldug-
gery in October 1960. As TIME has re-
ported, Giancana became upset because 
his girl. friend, Singer Phyllis McGuire, 
took up in Las Vegas with Comedian 
Dan Rowan. It was arranged to have 
Rowan's hotel room bugged. Through 
ill.chance, the snooper was caught in 
the act of planting his gear. The inves-
tireai ion progressed slowly, but eventu-
ally the Las. Vegas police insisted on put-
ting the evidence before the FBI, and 
Maheu informed Colonel Edwards that 
Giancana and Roselli expected to be 
protected. By May 1962 the FBI got in 
touch with Edwards about the matter. 
With Edwards in tow, CIA General 
Counsel Lawrence Houston warned As-
sistant Attorney General Herbert J. , 
? Miller Jr. that the clis's connection with 
the Mafia faced exposure if the snoop-
ers siere prosecuted. A day or so later, 
Houston and Edwards met with then 
Attorney General Robert Kenney. 
was upset but apparently not unduly 
alarmed. There would be no prosecu-
tion. His parting words were: "If you 
people want to get involved again with 
Mafia types, I want you to consult me 
first." It was Houston's impression that 
Kennedy had not known of the oper-
ation until that afternoon but had no ob-
jection to its going forward. 
Special Meeting. In. August 1962 
the assassination project came under 
? 
discussion at the highest levels of the 
Government. McCone called a special 
meeting of officials?among them Rusk, 
McNamara and Murrow?to discuss the 
growing Soviet activities in Cuba. Mc-
Cone and another man present remem-
ber that McNamara raised the question 
of disposing of Castro. Murrow at once 
objected to any discussion on that point. 
McCone echoed the protest. Neverthe-
less, a memorandum circulated two days 
later by Air Force Major General Ed-
ward Lansdale. a counterinsurgency ex-
pert attached to McNarnara's office, in-
cluded a mention of a plan for 
"eliminating- or "liquidating" or other-
wise doing Castro in?no one remem-
bers the exact phrase. 
When the memo was hand-carried 
to McCone. he hit the roof. He tele-
phoned the Pentagon and demanded 
that the memo be w ithdra wn at once. 
That was done, but a copy, with the ob-
jectionable terms blanked out, somehow 
-survives, and was the object of much 
speculation among the Rockefeller and 
;Senate panels. Two incw th.:i after the Au-
gust meeting. the Soviet missiles were 
discovered in Cuba. In the turmoil, Har-
vey's executive action and the Mafia 
connection all disappeared into the void, 
never to be revived.

The Rockefeller commission's re-
port on the Centre: Intelligence Agen-
cy is something of a s indication for the 
New York Tmies, which bloke the sto-
ry of CIA domestic spying in an article 
last Dec. 22 by Investigative Reporter 
Seymour Hersh. Yet for months the 
Times sat on an even juicier part of the 
CIA story?President Ford's concern 
:over the agenay's alleged role in foreign 
assassination plots?but chose not to 
print it. Times editors last week were 
standing by their decision, but the ep-
isode underlined the hazards of giving 
and taking off-the-record information. 
Shortly after Hersh's. CIA story,. 
White House Press Secretary Ron Nes-
sen called Clifton Daniel, the Times 
Washington bureau chief, and told him 
that invitations Were being sent for an 
"informal" lunch with the President. On 
Jan. 16, seven top Ttmesnien were ush-
ered into a small dining room in the East 
Wing for lamb chops with Ford, Nes-
sen, ? Chief of Staff Donald Rurnsfeld, 
Economic Adviser Alan Greenspan and 
Special Consultant Robert Goldwin. 
The gathering was cordial, though Ford 
occasionally interjected -Now this is off 
the record" and -This is not for pub-
lic." Talk eventually turned to the 
Rockefeller commission. Ford ex-
pressed concern that the inquiry could 
uncover embarrassing CIA activities not 
related to domestic spying. "Like what?" 
asked Managing Editor A.M. Rosen-
thal, always the reporter. Replied the 
President: "Assassinations," 
Ford's Cormosr(!. e,LI-
hors gathered in Daniel's office and 
agreed that since the lunch was off the 
record, the Times could not print the 
President's disclosure. When Daniel 
tried to get Nessen to relent and put the 
quote on the record, the press secretary 
stood firm. A day or two later, Daniel 
chatted with Reporter Hersh about the 
CIA's possible role in foreign assassina-
tions, but Daniel says he did not reveal 
the President's mention of the subject; in 
any case, Hersh kept busy on the story's 
domestic angle. "Why didn't I tell him to 
drop everything and get on the foreign-
assassination story?" asks Daniel. "Be-
cause it Wasn't new. What was new was 
that Ford was concerned. We couldn't 
print that story. I don't take my word 
lightly. I don't think gentlemen and jour-
nalists are mutually exclusive." 
Word of the lunch eventually got to 
CBS Newsman Daniel Schorr, who on 
Feb. 28 reported the President's concern 
about CIA assassinaticn plots. Schorr's 
report stirred a mild sensation, and for-
mer CIA Director Richard Helms de-
nounced the reporter as "Killer Schorr! 
Killer Schorr!" But by then the Rocke-
feller commission was well into its in-
vestigation, and its final 'report pleads 
?not too convincingly?that there was 
? not enough time to examine the subject 
fully. Schorr refuses to identify his 
source. 
Did the President deliberately make 
that off-the-record lunchtime disclosure 
in order to keep the paper?and the 
hard-charging Hersh?off the assassina-
tion trail? Government and corporate 
Officials occasionally try to -lock up" 
news . organizations with strategically 
placed not-for-publication disclosures. 
In the President's case, it is unlikely that 
he spoke out of guile. "I don't know how 
devious the President is," answers Ron 
Nessen, "and I'm not going to ask him." 
Managing Editor Rosenthal sees no 
skulduggery in the President's remark. 
Says he: "How did he know that we

elected to be so trustworthy. "As far as

Tom Wicker, who attended the lunch. 
"But I work here, so I accepted the de-
cision." Says Hersh: "Things have a way 
of leaking?which is why it's ridiculous 
to make those agreements." 
Ridiculous it may be, but journalists 
often find it essential to let their sourc-

never say otherwise. Some of these 
sources may try to entomb sensitive in-

president of the United 
States for cash. The CIA 
has good reason to fear that 
men will start talking. 
The fear that men will 
talk is an unhealthy thing in 
a democracy. It gets more 
unhealthy as the number of 
men being gagged multi-
plies, and the justification 
for their silence diminishes. 
What the CIA fears is the 
light of day. 
We taxpayers have, with 
billions of dollars, furnished' 
a thousand dank little cel-
lars we know nothing about, 
and our own menet, will be. 
used in the future to make 
sure we learn-as little about 
them as possible. 
If you doubt this, look at 
the recommendations of the 
Rockefeller Cotrunission it-
self. After criticizing the 
CIA, and saying it should 
stay, out of domestic spying, 
the report makes these four 
exceptions: 
I. When the agency is 
keeping a watch over its

past ? a large domestic 
personnel. 
2. When it is countering

? The spies must spy not only' 
on their own spies, but on 
anyone who Might be 
spying on these spies. 
3. When a domestic target 
is "suspected of espio-
nage." In the past, receiv-
ing mail from abroad was 
enough to qualify under this: 
proviso. 
4. When ? information 
"incidental" to foreign ac-
tivities has been uncovered 
and is referred to other 
agencies. 
in other words, even the 
commission, in trying to cut 
back on the CIA's home ac-
tivity, specifies four powers 
by which it can police its: 
own, maintain its domestic 
fronts, use deceit about its - 
financing, and harass those 
who are suspected of for-
eign activities or any illegal 
activities. 
We are asked to give the 
agency money for guarding 
its spies from exposure. We 
pay to insure our own 
deception. If the CIA is 
authorized to cover up, it is 
de facto authorized to avoid 
accountability. It makes no 
sense  for the Rockefeller 
Commission to call for ac-
countability. 
The CIA is already a cyst 
in our government, a can-
cerous growth more loyal to 
itself than to any law, for-
eign or domestic. It is an 
enemy of our enemies; but 
also an enemy to us. 
With such friends we 
41x need enemies. One

cer. One cuts is out.

Soon the employer must 
work harder to keep up this

the taxpayers are being 
worked to keep up the canni-
balizing efforts of the bu-

bureaucratic agencies. 
But recast the fable to al-
low for the secrecy factor. 
The nine original servants 
must conduct hidden liv.es. 
Even the large house built to

proposal that we abolish the CIA' 
provides us with a clear example of 
neo-Jeffersonian folly. To the liber-
al mind, the solution to unchecked 
power is it abolition. Institutions 
are evil inasmuch as they restrain 
the creative and virtuous individu-
al. Lurking in the background of 
liberal idealism is that nation of 
small farmers that would theoreti-
cally allow maximum liberty for the, 
individual by severely limiting govm 
ernmental power over his life. 
But it is clear that our system is 
founded on the restraint of power, 
not its non-exercise. And, for the,i 
most part, our institutions have. 
'exerted a force to expand individual - 
liberty, not to restrain it. The end.

my opinion, not a Jeffersonian para-
dise of free men tilling their own,

The CIA is a necessary and vital' 
agency whose functions are indis-

As a CIA retiree whb served 23 ' 
years with the agency, I resent 
deeply the implicit suggestion by 
Wills that all those who are serving 
and have given service with CIA ' 
should put on sackcloth and ashes 
and be stoned in the public square. 
During those 23 years, I suffered 
some fools in the organization and 
found it necessary to work with the , 
occasional bastard. (There must be 
.a few such folk in, say, the depart-

perhaps, perish the thought, even in

Bastardly they may have been,' 
but, with a single exception, I had

was, at best, significant and impor-

simply dull, plodding work.

would be deflected by a wall. In the case of 
the Oval Office it had to go through the 
panes of the French doors leading to the 
Rose Garden. 
Highly reliable sources told Penthouse 
that one or more senior officials of the Secret 
Service and the Central Intelligence Agency 
are familiar with the "Easy Chair" situation in 
the White House, although they could not 
say whether they learned of it only when the 
laser device was discovered and removed 
early in August 1970, or whether they knew 
at some earlier date. The sources would not 
rule out that the late J. Edgar Hoover, then 
director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, was also privy to "Easy Chair." 
In any event, this super-bugging of the 
presidential office looms as one of the most 
bizarre episodes in the still unfolding story 
of domestic spying carried out by six suc-
cessive administrations, but climaxing most 
spectacularly during Nixon's tenure. 
Penthouse learned of this bugging of the 
Oval Office as a result of a lengthy investi-
gation. According to highly authoritative 
sources, the person who installed the laser 
transmitter, possibly on a second attempt 
when an original device did not function 
properly, is a foreign-born individual em-
ployed as a painter by the government and 
apparently controlled by one of the intelli-
gence agencies. His name as well as a 
number of other relevant details are with-
held from publication to avoid causing suf-
fering and embarrassment to persons inno-
cently involved in this operation. 
Investigations by Penthouse have also 
produced the significant fact that officials of 
the General Services Administration, which 
is responsible for the maintenance of gov-
ernment buildings, have been under strict 
orders from the Secret Service since 1970 
not to discuss with outsiders anything per-
taining to the painting of the interior of the 
White House. The Secret Service also is-
sued orders that all inquiries on the subject 
be immediately reported to it. These orders 
tants, dissidents in general, and real or sus-
pected radicals. 
e Court records, disclosed in April of this 
year (months after Ford ordered the inves-
tigation of the Intelligence Community), 
show that at least twenty federal agencies 
still maintain electronic surveillance of 
Americans at home and abroad. Overseas, 
particularly in Germany, the targets are U.S. 
military personnel. This surveillance in-
cludes telephone tapping and the secret 
recording of face-to-face conversations 
either through hidden devices or informers 
secretly wired for sound. (It is unclear. how-
ever, whether all this surveillance is based 
on court orders or is conducted illegally.) 
The immense scope of this activity Can be 
appreciated from this list of .agencie-en-
gaging in domestic and foreign electronic 
surveillance of Americans: the FBI; the CIA; 
the National Security Agency; the Defense 
Intelligence Agency; the Department of the 
Air Force; the Postal Inspection Service: the 
IRS Intelligence Division; the IRS Inspection 
Service's Internal Security Division: the 
Drug Enforcement Administration; the

If subsequent legal determinaticn whether 
the incorporation of the proprietaries and 
their operations have been in violation of 
laws. The existence of the CIA corporate 
empire, estimated at some 5200 million an-
nually in sales and services, has long been 
a secret and there have been no court tests 
of the legality of these proprietary come 
panies. Since none of these companies has: - 
publicly owned stock, problems with the: 
SEC are unlikely to arise. 
The CIA began putting together its pro-' 
prietary corporate network in the early. 
1950s in order to acquire dornsetic and 
foreign covers for secret operatiorit and to 
Oar:inert' funds discreetly to its overseas 
operatives. Only top CIA officials know how 
smarty of these companies are or have been 
in existence?what is known of the opera-
tion suggests that the agency has been clos-
ing down some of them and creating others, 
according to need?but the system is being 
used to this day. Colby, in fact. confirmed it 
earlier this year when he denied a charge 
that profits generated by the proprietaries 
an be uSed for covert foreign operations, 
thus bypassing restrictions written into law 
by Congress late in 1974. 
Most of the proprietaries were incorpo-
rated fe Delaware, a state that does not levy 
local corporate taxes, and there are reasons 
to believe that the CIA even has its own 
incorporating company in Dover to handle 
the business away from prying eyes. CIA 
officials say, however, that in some in-
stances officials in the office of the Dela-
ware secretary of state had to be informed of, 
the true nature of the proprietaries to avoid: 
blowing the CIA covers. 
Probably the oldest major proprietary is 
the Pacific Corporation, with headquarters 
in a third-floor suite in an office building at 
1725 K Street in Washington. Incorporated 
in 1950. Pacific is one of the principal CIA 
holoing companies because it provides fi-
nancial and management controls for other 
irrportant proprietaries. Pacific's president 
is Hegh L. Grundy, believed to be a long-
time CIA official, who actually lives just a 
few blocks away from the agency's Langley 
be.adquarters. 
Operating directly under Pacific are Air 
Arre.rica. Inc.. the "private" CIA airline thee 
has operated planes and helicopters for 
yeao:-.. throughout Indochina in support of the 
ageocys "clandestine army" in Laos and

a cover for the. CIA's operations in Asia and 
eee.ahere. The CIA refunds AID through a 
complex bookkeeping system involving the,

14 JUNE 1975 
investigative stories 
As a result of a New York Times_ 
investigation first published on Decem-
ber 22, 1974, the Rockefeller Commis-
sion this week (June 10) released a re-
port that substantially confirms alle-
gations that the Central Intelligence 
Agency has conducted unlawful and 
uncontrolled domestic operations. 
On the release date, the commission 
also recommended tightened controls on 
the agency and criticized the Justicc 
Department for abdicating "its statu-
tory duties" for more than 20 years in 
a secret agreement with the CIA. 
The events of the week substantiated 
stories that both plagued President 
Ford's administration in its early days 
and shocked Washingtonians from the 
highest levels down. 
Although hardly as shattering as the 
Watergate revelations, the CIA investi-
gation revealed a number of suspect 
operations conducted by the agency 
long before the commission report. 
Among early allegations by Times 
reporter Seymour M. Hersh and others 
were: 
?charges that the CIA had estab-
ished files on at least 10,000 American 
citizens as part of a special agency 
unit. This now has been confirmed by 
the commission which said that a unit 
called Operation CHAOS had main-
tained 13,000 files on individuals as 
well as 11,000 FBI memoranda and 
3,500 internal memoranda. A computer 
system, it was revealed, has indexed 
over 300,000 names and organizations 
that apparently are not connected with 
espionage. An additional 800 files were 
created on dissenting organizations 
with some 12,000 to 16,000 names in-
dexed in them. 
?charges that the CIA had used il-
legal methods for their operations in-
cluding break-ins, wiretaps, and mail 
inspection that began as early as the 
1950s. The commission found that the 
CIA had logged-32 wiretaps, 32 bug-
gings, 12 break-Ins. None were con-
ducted under auclicial :?arar.ill.t and 
only one was with the approval of the 
Attorney General. Further, mail open-
ings in New York City alone accounted 
for more than 4,350,000 incidents. 
?charges that the CIA,. had followej 
anti-war and other cauliPPAQVArk.Or 
tors. This was confirmed. 
?charges that the CIA had set up 
a network of informants in anti-war 
groups. This too was confirmed al-
though the commission reported that 
CIA actions went far beyond just moni-
toring such organizations. 
?charges that the CIA had placed 
members of Congress under surveil-
lance. This too was confirmed. 
?ell^ -gee the t the agecy 1rd - 
stroyed many of the filesn proving its 
guilt just prior to the CIA investiga-
tion. In this instance, the commission 
found that some files on a test of LSD 
on persons who were unaware they 
were being tested were destroyed. In 
one instance, a person died (1953). 
?charges that the CIA had estab-
lished a secretive unit for domestic in-
telligence operations. The report con-
firmed that Operation CHAOS was in-
deed this unit and that in some in-
stances had overstepped its legal 
authority. 
Further in the report, it was revealed 
that among those individuals kept un-
der surveillance by the CIA were news-
men who were watched in five different 
investigations in an effort to determine 
their sources who leaked classified in-
formation. 
The report's section on reported plots 
to assassinate foreign leaders has been 
withheld although the commission has 
collected information on the subject. 
The one allegation that the report 
pointedly did not confirm was the use

"internal passports- be issued to aliens in 
the United States, a step that could -have 
led to a national identification system en the 
Soviet model. However Attorney General 
Levi vetoed the scheme. 
Spying and covert activity is now an cfli-
cial government pastime in the United States. 
Can the president or Congress arrest this 
trend toward an American police state? The 
answer is vital in determining the kind of 
society in which we will live. 9-i-a 
Of the word "massive" in conjunction 
with CIA operations. According to 
' Times associate editor, Clifton Daniel, 
the commission report avoided the word 
and used in its place terms such as 
"considerable," "large scale" and "sub-
stantial." 
The commission report served a dual 
purpose in the eyes of many reporters. 
? The first was ita confirmation of re-
ports by Hersh as well as some allega-
tions made by a former CIA Inspector 
General. This confirmation, many feel, 
was necessary since the running of 
stories on the highly secretive CIA was 
considered both daring and, at times 
perhaps, speculative. 
The second' purpose was to clear the 
Rockefeller commission of any charges 
of a possible whitewash of the entire 
subject, although.e.vEal Ll(ings includ-
ing the assassination attempts were 
withheld from the public. 
Daniels' article in the June 11 edi-
tion of the Times traced the history of 
the story from its appearance to Wil-
liam E. Colby, director of the CIA, who 
denied the allegations. 
Daniel reported that on January 16-, 
Times publisher Arthur Ochs Sulz-
berger and principal editors had met 
with President Ford for a luncheon at 
the White House. During this occasion, 
Daniel reported, ". . the President, 
under questioning, used the word 'as-
sassinations' in a discussion of the 
activities of' the CIA." His conversation 
was off-the-record, however. 
As well .as tighter restrictions 
through a Congressional committee, the 
commission also suggested that the 
'President tighten executive control by 
making the Foreign Intelligence Ad-
visory Board an effective watch-dog 
agency, open the CIA director's job to 
people outside the government and put 
a 10-year limit on the director's term 
of .service. 
Q. I understand that Columbia Pictures is secretly 
negotiating with Victor Marchetti, author of The CIA 
and the Cult of Intelligence, to write a film called 
The Director. It would be based on the clandestine 
activities in Italy of William Colby, director of the 
CIA. In this film Colby would be depicted as having 
fallen in love with Clare Boothe Luce, who was U.S:

Otert 
o counter 
etion Cal4d-
tance the ,Soviets 
By MIKE ACKERMAN 
With WILLIAM MONTALBANO 
(o) 1913, Miami Herald Publiehine Co. 
Intelligence is like an air condi-
tioner in the summertime. It is nice 
to have. But it is no good unless 
you use it. 
The Soviet KGB and the Cuban 
DGI are experts in translating intel-
ligence into effective covert action.i. 
They use a worldwide network of' 
allied Communist parties to help. 
The CIA must be able to counter-
balance these activities. That, pure 
and simple, is the 'case for covert 
action. However great the uproar in 
the United States over its propriety, 
covert action is g necessary tool of 
the CIA. ? 
AN EXAMPLE: , 
One steamy morning in aa Latin 
American?country a few years ago, 
a source tipped me that a Commu-
nist group was secretly plotting 
takeover of the port workers' union. 
They planned to sow discord 
among the workers by spreading 
rumors of corruption, by disrupting 
meetings, and by stealing an up-
coming election through a secret 
sympathizer on the election corn-
mittee. ? 
That was intelligence. The Com-
munist takeover could have mortal-
ly wounded a new, weak and unsta-
ble democratic government._ _ 
. My CIA station chief directed me 
to act on the intelligence. I sought 
out the incumbent union leader, a 
tough, basically honest but un-
lettered former stevedore. I told 
him what the Communists were 
planning, and I offered to help him. 
FOR TWO WEEKS, I lived with 
the man in a safe house- outside the 
-Capital-- City. By the time he went 
back to his union, he knew propa-
ganda theory; he knew how to 
counter Communist attempts at dis-
ruption; he knew how to guard 
against election-rigging. He was his 
country's foremost authority on 
parliamentary procedure. He also 
had a modest sum of money to start 
a health insurance plan among his 
workers. 
He won the election. The new 
government still had its problems, 
hut at least it did not also have a 
Communist . union threatening to 
close down the country's ports. 
That was covert action. Most of 
the operations I ran between 1965 
and 1970 as a CIA street man were 
in this field. I worked in Latin 
America and in Africa. _ 
Covert action is an attempt to - 
clandestinely influence the politics 
of another country without showing 
your own hand. Like it or not, it is 
a major part of the intelligence 
business. 
? ? ? Approved Fi&r. 
To those who insist we have no 
business interfering in the affairs 
of other countries, I say, "Fine, if 
no one -else will interfere either." 
- EVERY MAJOR intelligence 
agency in the world has covert ac-
tion specialists. It is true of the 
British MI-6, the French SDT, the 
Israeli'Moisad, and it is even more 
emphatically true of the . Soviets, 
the Cubans, the Chinese and the 
East European satellites. All use co-
vert action as an adjunct-to' diplo-
macy. 
Once, the CIA leaned heavily on 
covert action as a clandestine 
means of furthering the objectives 
of U.S. foreign policy, as a halfway 
house between diplomatic gumbeat-
ing and military intervention. 
Today, if the CIA again needed 
to help, the Latin American union 
leader, it would legally have to ad-
vise between 50 and 150 members 
of the House end Senate. In those 
circumstances, it might as well take 
an ad in The New York Times. 
In countries where covert action 
used to be the CIA's bread and but-
ter program, the term isn't even 
heard anymore. I know that first-
hand. 
About five years ago, the CIA ? 
rightfully ? began cutting back its 
covert-action operations. The agen-
cy recognized that it didn't need co-
vert operations in every banana re-
public. 
NOW, THE 'PENDULUM has 
swung too far the other way. We 
are out of the business altogether. 
The Soviet KGB admits to no re-
straint. Cuba's DGI encounters no 
public pressure to curtail its wide-
spread international activities: We 
have dropped our guard, but they 
keep punching. 
Covert action can follow many 
paths, and the Soviets and the Cu-
bans have been down all of them. 
In the mid-1960s, local terrorists 
allied with the DGI firebombed the ! 
offices of a moderate newspaper in 
one Latin American. -country. I I 
passed funds to the publisher to get 
the newspaper back on the street. 
In another country, Communist 
infiltrators secretly engineered the 
takeover of a Muslim religious or-
ganization, intending to use it as a 
platform for anti-government and 
anti-American propaganda. 
I FORMED a counter organiza-
tions that was more rigorously or-
thodox. It was nonpolitical. Given 
? an alternative, the country's serious 
Muslims opted for what some of my 
.. CIA friends. teasirtgly called ? the 
"Abdul Ibn Ackerman Benevolent 
Society."' 
In another country, Communist 
agents were successful in placing 
one of the ix _ syfeepatletzere_eo 
Rely*KG29911031/914 
party. 
In a prolonged and often angry 
dialogue with a young moderate 
who was a natural antagonist of 
the sympathizer., I persuaded him to 
enter public life. He did, and came 
to be a vital counterweight to Com-
munist influence. He may one day 
be his country's president. 
On other occasions, I worked ? 
with another union leader to break. 
a general strike called by the Corn; . 
.munists to upset an elected Latin-
American government. Once, I pro-
vided advice and ? financial aid to. 
African politicians locked in an!. 
election battle with Communist and! 
Communist-leaning parties. 
Although covert action is usually ? 
directed against a clear Corrimunist 
_threat, theee are exceptions. 
Once in Latin America I worked 
covertly with other case officers to 
help cool both sides in a Latin 
American border dispute that came 
.perilously close to bloodshed. 
? THE MOST EFFECTIVE covert 
operations are pot the ones that 
make '.eadlines. 
In Moscow, the Ic.C.31.; never 
-makes headlines. It Ls well-trained, 
well-financed and historically com-
mitted to the art of covert action. 
It is the pride of a society. which 
has elevated conspiracy tca life-
style. 
???? 
Americans take for granted that 
back-room maneuvering plays a 
la1.ge role in their own domestic po-
litical flux. Why do they then recoil 
with horror at the reality of clan-
destine political intrigue at the in-
ternational level? 
International politics is not a po-
lite bridge. game. There are no Mar-
quis of Queensbury rules. The 
choice between black hats and 
white hats is not always clear. 
? 
Often, the CIA is critized for 
backing right-wing dictatorships as 
an alternative to Communism. 
But if you ask me whether the 
United States is better ?off with a 
friendly military junta than with a 
hostile Communist government, my 
answer is "Yes." 
? 
MILITARY JUNTAS do not last 
forever. They allow for the possibil-
ity of eventual change toward more 
democratic forms. 
" Perhaps Communist dictatorships 
don't last forever either. But the 
fact is that no institutionalized 
Communist government has ever 
been overthrown. 
Even in countries where they do 
not hold power. Communist parties 
pose a clear and present danger of 
irreversible dictatorial change. 
They are organized conspiratori-
ally. They play the game of covert 
action to the hilt. -Often, they have

Special.to The New Yotic Times ' 
WASHINGTON, June 23?The 
Soviet intelligence service has 
been able for at least a .year.i 
to intercept and record tele. 
phone conversations within the 
United States between Govern-
ment officials, military leaders 
and private citizens, according 
to informed Federal intelligence 
officials. 
One official said today that 
the National Security Agency, 
which has the responsibility 
of; . insuring the security Of 
domestic communications, had 
been aware of the practice "for 
some time," but that there was 
,..'nothing that can . be done 
'about, it, absolutely nothing 
`nothing." . 
The reason, he said, was that 
the interceptions were made: 
at the point that the conversa-
ttions, chiefly ? long - distance 
,ones but including scme cross-
-town calls, entered the extem, 
sive microwave relay network 
that passed them through the 
air to satellites or between the 
radio relay stations that stretch 
acroosss the United States.. ? 
Sensitive Channels Separated 
? The Russians, the official 
said, had developed the ability 
to reparate certain sensitive 
rehannels?fi6in: the yyriRcl. .64 
;Teo:lucre:las that make up -these 
traHsmissions, allowing them 
to ?? monitor calls' to and from 
"the military, Congress, anybo-
dy?you name ? it, they can chi 
it." 
A White House official fami-
liar with the Soviet operation, 
which until two, weeks ago 
was among the American 
Government's best-kept secrets, 
said that telephone calls placed 
and received by members of 
Congress "undoubtedly must be 
among those that were over-
heard." 
An spokesman for Senator 
Frank Church, the Idaho Demo, 
crat who heads the Senate corn--
mittee inveatigating intel-
ligence activities, .said today 
that the panel's staff had been. 
instructed to find out how long, 
Such external eavesdropping 
had been going on and what 
ihad been overheard. ?

'communications inside this, 
'country was a brief allusion 
to that possibility in the recent-
ly released report of Presiden 
Ford's commission that investi-
gated the activities of the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. 
The Chicago Tribune reported 
today that a six-page section' 
'of the report containing the 
reference, prepared by Vice 
President Rockefeller, who 
headed the commission, had 
been "censored" for security 
reasons-by White House, State 
Department 'and N.S.A. offi-
cials.

tary, the press,' the police. When 
the right moment comes, they can 
act with terrifying speed.. 
That is what happened in Portu-
gal. The speed of the Communist 
--rise to power there did not surprise 
me. The tactics the Conimunists 
used there are not new. . 
But they have seldom been as 
successful as they were in Lisbon. 
Perhaps there is a reason why not. 
My conviction is that commu 
nism has not prospered more be-
-cause the CIA's Clandestine Servic-
es, through covert action, has 
served as a powerful check on 
Communist aspirations. 
President said today. howeveral 
that the 'report "was not cen-
sored by anyone," although the 
commission had sought "the 
advice of experts on classifica-
tion as to certain sensitive mat-
ters," and that as a result a 
'few passages nave been "re-
! 
phrased." 
' The' interception of electronic 
intelligence, or `Vint," as it 
is' known, has become within 
the last two decades an increaa 
singly costly and time-consum-
ing undertaking of both the 
5oviet and American intel-

a lesser degree of the other

Paris, 12 June 1975 
CONTROL TO BE RESTORED 
It would be easy to write that the Rockefeller report on the CIA contains 
no new elements for action concerning the abuse of power which, since the end 
of last year, some American opinion had been looking forward to. It confirms 
at least three-fourths of the accusations made against the Agency (more precisely, 
the Central Intelligence Agency) last December by our colleague of the New York 
Times, Seymour Hirsh. In the wake of his investigations, "revelations", "leaks", 
calculated indiscretions, etc. have abundantly nourished the curiosity of the 
public, which saw for the first time a little opening of the cover of the sanct-
uary of the American state. 
Two points need to be made at the very outset. The first is the very fact 
? that there is a commission of inquiry appointed by the President, which today has 
submitted the result of its investigations. It should also be noted that the task 
of Mr. Rockefeller and his associates was precisely circumscribed, namely to 
focus on "counter-espionage" operations conducted domestically by the CIA. This 
concerns legal matters with diverse, complex aspects which are secondary when 
compared with the wide range of external actions based on the large technical 
capabilities for intercepting and decoding signals in the atmosphere which the 
"place" ("maison") in Langley, outside Washington, has become known for in our 
time. 
The three hundred pages of the Rockefeller report contain a documentation 
which one may still judge to be inadequate but one could not imagine the issu-
ance of a similar report in any Western democracy. 
The second point is that it is disastrous that an organization with the 
great mission that the CIA has, frequently became involved in actions beyond 
its assigned mission: it matters little that it occurred most often at the 
instigation of the White Hese that the CIA compromised itself on affairs which 
were not within its 1-0M,TY'tianf'". And jnef an off-hand remark about the neglig-
ence of Congress which over a twenty-year period has not shown the slightest 
sign of taking a close look as to what was going on and was carried out under 
the name of the three famous initials. 
As a matter of fact, the responsibility of the Congress is perhaps a 
heavier one than that of the Executive. For, it is the legislator who is 
concerned here: it is he who defines the prerogatives of the important services 
of the nation. All irregularities revealed and condemned in the Rockefeller 
report are deemed to be "against the law": for sure, they are not compatible 
with good sense and good taste. Legally, things are little bit more delicate. 
The act by which the CIA came into existence, the "charter" invoqued to prevent 
its involvement in domestic police functions, dates back to 1947 and is not 
marked by clear logic. It has, among other things, been erased and over-
loaded with and superceded by hundreds of "directives" from the White House, 
some general in nature others more specific; they constitute what is called - 
officially! - the "secret charter" of the CIA. It seems that the White House 
has decided to refer the integration of this confusing matter to Senator Frank 
Church, who heads a CUWASSiOn of inquiry of the Senate on the conduct attrib-
uted to the CIA. He firmly intends not only to change the practices but also 
the statutes of the obscure institution. 
The CIA has shown by its cooperation with the Rockefeller inquiry as well 
as with the two special Congressional commissions which were created for the same 
reason and in the same spirit, that it is vitally interested not to come out of 
the shadow but out of the semi-darkness into which certain of its marginal activ-
ities had spread, to devote itself in good conscience to that which will always 
be its untouchable and hence irreproachable domaine: espionage abroad, world-
wide by a super-power.

r' Afterthoughts" ? _ _ I 
Afterthoughts on me CA 
The Rockefeller Commission report on withholding of information damaging to the 
mistakes committed by the U.S. Central In- CIA. 
?A 
telligence Agency in the past was not a A A 
whitewash. On the contrary, it uncovered and Not all, but most of the abuses confirmed or 
reported to the public several highly improper 
actions which had not been sniffed out 
previously by any investigating news re-
porter. 
The worst examples of such newly disclosed 
impropriety included giving LSD to an unwit-
ting person who subsequently jumped out of a 
10th-story room to his death. Others included 
keeping a defector in solitary confinement for 
three years and "in one other case a defector 
was physically abused." 
The major published allegations against the 
CIA were confirmed. There was widespread 
abuse of the rights of American citizens. The 
CIA did exceed its charter on a very broad 
scale. It did allow itself to be used improperly 
for political purposes. 
This confirmation of published charges and 
disclosure of more that had not been suspected 
by reporters can, and should, be the beginning 
of the restoration of public confidence in the 
integrity of government processes in Washing-
ton. It is noteworthy that many newspapers 
both in the United States and abroad assumed 
that the Rockefeller Commission report would 
be a whitewash, and some rushed to a 
whitewash conclusion on the first day after 
publication. Only after reading the text was it 
generally realized that this was a remarkably 
honest job. ? 
:lee principal subsequent criticisms were 
hat the report had not expressed sufficient 
outrage over the mistakes it had uncovered or 
cenfirmed. Another was that it had not gone 
beyond its mandate which was limited to should be pet-Sons of "stature, independence, 
disclosed in the report occurred after 1961 
when the CIA moved from various antiquated 
and obscure buildings scattered around Wash-
ington into its superpalace at Langley, Vir-
ginia. 
This was in the middle of one of the most 
expensive and exclusive suburban residential 
districts around Washington. The building 
looks like a junior Pentagon, and not all that 
junior. It is highly visible from the air and 
scarcely concealed from -heavily traveled 
highways. It lost its anonymity when the move 
was made. 
No one Could weigh the extent to which life 
in a supersplendid building contributed to 
what can be called delusions of grandeur. The 
ill-starred Bay of Pigs affair was conceived 
before the move was made, but during the 
construction process. The widespread surveil-
lance of American citizens by the agency, in 
confirmed violation of its charter, was trig-
gered by the radical movements of the '60s 
which grew out of black unrest and antiwar 
protests. But it remains a fact that the CIA 
was largely anonymous and largely non-
controversial while it was living in humble 
quarters. Did it share in the "arrogance of 
power" which marked the Johnson-Nixon 
era? 
A A A 
Remedies proposed by the Rockefeller 
Commission largely deal with way a ad na'eaes 
of improving supervision over CIA activities. 
Particularly interesting is the recommenda-
tion that in the future directors of the CIA

that this does not necessarily exclude perso 
from within the service. But it says "consid 
eration should be given to individuals fr 
outside the service" and it adds that "manag 
ment and administrative skills are at least 
important as the technical expertise whi 
can always be found in an able deputy." 
All CIA directors up to 1956 were recruit 
from outside the CIA. They came either fro. 
private life (John McCone, Allen Dulles) 
from the military services (Gen. Wal 
Bedell Smith, Admiral Hilenkotter). In 1

William E. Colby, the present director, is al. 
from the career CIA service. 
The above should be read against the fa 
that the report finds that Presidents Johns 
and Nixon used improper pressure on the?C 
to do things which it ought not to have don 
The implication is that Mr. Helms, a car 
service officer, was less able to resist t 
pressure than a person from outside 
service who because of personal position 
personal wealth would have had enoug

The grio'elines, which will be pre-

arently will be one of the first 
acknowle.dged attempts by

At issue is .eleether, and nr.der

The *:'iashinoton University case 
e.s implications for other American 
iversities. Many of their imerni-
onally knowa scholars regularly 
ttend foreign conferences at which 
ev have access to sensitive infor-
nion end ars in contact with sci-
atists, ;lectors, teed scholars from 
rnmuais: countries. 
The disclosure that prornptcl the 
uldeline writing at Washington 
rtiversirj involved the activities of 
an Gaehler, former director of the 
..ews bureau in the university's rr.ed-
1 s-chool. Mr. Gashler, who be-
erne director in 1966, says it 
-ented to him from the oeteet to be 
rfectly reeeonable to cooperate 
1:11 the one... 
He understood, he recalls, that 
ra.ws bureau hen given 
gents access to faculty tavel. plans 
or several years before he arrived. 
Every year the hterean circulated 
memorandum to factity tat=bers 
as'..ting them to detail their travel 
ptans. presumably for use in pub-
licity releases. Mr. Cashier's under-
standing was that CIA. agents from 
the agency's St. Louis off= had 
come around resularly and had 
been given access to the information 
the faculty Members supplied. 
Mr. Cashier also was, by tarn-
perament, a good source for the 
C.I.A. A politleally conetrvative mart 
who .b...ts seen active for raw years 
as an ofelen: in the Naval Reserve, 
he says he .1-el:eyed it was the duty 
cf any petriotic American to beLo 
the C.I.A. when he could. 
He remembers, for instance, a 
lecture at a Navy training session 
that made preciaely that point. "It 
was pointed out," he says, "that a 
lot more communists are involved 
in [intelligence work] than our peo-
ple, so the thought occurred to me 
that whatever I could do toward 
getting us some information woeld 
be a.patriotie gesture." ? 
BriteFnao Saught 
So Mr. Cashier cooperated. Acting 
at !east in part on his information, 
c.t.A.. agents would telephene pro-
feszors who treveltecl to overseas 
conferences and reottest a meeting. 
Sometimes the agents would seek 
such meetings before the trips so 
they could outline v.hat information 
they wanted the peolessors to. look 
for and identify the foreign scholars 
in whom, they were interested. At 
? 
other times they would esle for a 
leriefaeg only after a .peee:eseor e?-
.tterreed Lomee.... ? 
.In acy. case, the connection 
twv.na the news -.bore-en:se h-treoal 
solicit:16ml of travel plans and the 
calls from the c.i.A. eventually 
prompted eon:tone to bring the mat-
ter* to the attention of William H. 
Danforth, then vice-chancellor for 
the medical school and new chan-
cellor of the entire university. Mr. 
Dar.fortla told Mr.. Cashier to cad 
his relationship with the cane, and 
the annual solicitation of travel 
plans was suspended. 
Sensa ol Patriotic Duty 
For a while, the Gashier-tter-i. 
connection was interrupted. But as 
protests against the war in Indo-
china escalated in the late 136C's, 
Mr. Cashier's sense of patriotic 
duty drew him back into contact 
with the agency.

were exposed by The New York Times: 
He was called on the carpet by then. 
committee chairman, Rep. Edward 
Hebert of Louisiana, who suspected 
Harrington himself as the leak for The 
Times expose. 
Denying he was the leak, Harrington 
was excused by the Armed Services 
s Committee after his Sept. 12 interroga-
tion and the matter appeared closed. 
But on May 25, Harrington read former 
CIA Latin America chief David A. 
Phillips' defense of the agency in a 
signed an Sete in the New York Times. 
Phillips wrote that it was a "myth" 
that the CIA "encouraged the Chilean 
plotters who toppled President Salva-
dor Allende-Gessens and funded the 
strikeei leading to the coup" against 
Marxist Allende. 
Angered once again, Harrington 
wrote a circular letter to House col-
leagues suggesting that they do what 
he did last June: obtain access to Col-
by's still-secret testimony to the Armed 
Services C/A oversight committee. He 
also asked, for access himself to other 
classified committee documents. 
That letter triggered the disciplinary 
action by the committee. It voted unan-
imously on Tuesday (with 13 of 40 
members present) to deny Harrington 
access to any more classified material 
at least until the House Ethics Corn-
niittee (officially the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct) exam-
ines the whole question of access to 
a committee's secret testimony by non-
committee members?a direct rebuke 
? to Harrington. 
,e? 
' Despite private advice from the 
parliamentarian's office that the House 
.Ethics Committee lacks jurisdiction in 
-a case looking toward a possible re-
'bnke of Massachusetts Rep. Michael 
Harrington, a liberal Democrat who 
has led attacks on the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, the Ethics Committee 
expected to meet next week to cons 
.aider the case. 
.- The move against Harrington, an out-
spoken CIA critic particularly in the 
;Chile affair, has been hatching for 
almost a year, the result of smoldering 
:resentment over what some Armed 
Services Committee members say psi-
. 
vately was Harrington's violation of a 
-signed secrecy pledge. 
e-? -Harrington signed the pledge on 
-June 4, 1974, as a condition for obtain-
'Ing access to secret testimony given ? 
to the Armed Services subcommittee 
on CIA oversight by CIA director 
William Colby on the agency's activi-
ties in domestic Chilean politics be-
fore and during the Allende regime. 
? The secrecy pledge signed by Har-
rington was as follows: "The contents 
of such classified information (Colby's 
testimony) will not be divulged to any 
unauthoriged person in any way, form, 
'shape or manner." 
., Angered over what he regarded as 
'eongressional apathy in the CIA-Chile 
, %affair, Harrington subsequently in-
:formed the chairman of the Senate 
rorcign Relations arid House Foreign 
? Affairs Committees, as well as other 
congressmen, members of his own 
staff and one highly reputable report-
!en that Colby's teStimony contained 
'political dynamite. The general trust 
of Colby's testimony was given by Har-
rington at least to the two committee 
, chairmen, and possibly others.

THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE

President Ford's as-yet unannounced 
presidential campaign committee in

Reagan will include at least two of 
Reagan's long-time aides and political 
Mr. Nedzi unresigned 
The House of Representatives has. 
overwhelmingly rejected the resigna-
tion of Chairman Lucien N. Nedzi of 
the Select Committee on Intelligence 
Activities, and ' whatever its motives 
its decision was a wise one. 
The select committee was appointed 
by Speaker Albert,in February, mainly 
to investigate charges against the CIA. 
It consists 'of three Republicans and 
seven Democrats, S01116 of whom---not-
ably Michael Harrington of Massachu-
setts and Ronald Dellurns of California 
?are inveterate liberals and bitter 
critics of the CIA. 
When it was. learned earlier this 
rrionth that as chairman of an Armed 
Forces subcommittee Mr. Nedzi had 
been briefed by the CIA on some of ' 
14e very activities to be investigated, 
I 1   se the seect committee Is 
D etnoc 
ra  
demanded his resignation. He appeased 
them by agreeing to turn the CIA in-
vestigetion over to a su tta 
hcommi e. 
Approvg ror Release 2001/084i : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100370007-0 
which he would noti be a member. But 
In the interest of objectivity he also re-
fused to name Messrs. Harrington and 
Deilums to the subcommitte, which so 
inflamed them that the compromise fell 
apart and Mr:. Nedzi submitted his 
resigna tion. 
Anti;CIA elements whipped up senti-
ment in favor of accepting Mr. Nedzi's. 
resignation, pointing out that it would 
be almost unprecedented to reject it 
(but neglecting to say that it would be 
just as unusual to accept the resigna-
tion of a committee chairman over in-
ternal commmittee bickering]. 
Fortunately the House rejected the 
resignation on Monday by the sur-
prising vote of 290 to 64. A majority 
of both parties supported the phairraan... 
For the most part, the vote was taxen 
advisers, including state Republican 
Chairman Paul Haerle. 
Hearle and state Attorney General 
Evelio Younger, the state's top Re-
publican officeholder, will be co-chair-
men of the Ford campaign committee, 
with Anita Wentner Asheraft, vice 
chairman of Reagan's 1970 re-election 
finance comma' tee, to take over as 
active head of the Ford California 
campaign later this year. 
For Mr. Ford, the quiet acquisition 
of Haerle and Anita Ashcraft is a 
major coup, establishing his political 
clout and proving that Reagan, a pcs-
sible contender against the President 
for the 1976 nomination, does not own 
his own state. 
Haerle was an all-out conservative 
backer of Sen. Barry Goldwater's pres-
idental nomination in 1.9(54. Northern 
California chairman for Reagan's first 
gubernatorial campaign in 1960, Haerle 
became hie personal appointments sec-
retary for the next three years. More 
recently, Haerle has been out of tho 
inner Reagan circle?but all his past 
Republican credentials are with the 
former governor. ? 
With David Packard, board chairman 
of Hewlitt-Packard, as national finance 
chairman for the Ford campaign, 
White House operatives feel the Presi-
dent has made more solid progress In 
California than any other state. Top 
r0Ordinatnr fnr the cast- is Mr. Ford's 
close personal friend, Leon Parma, 
ivice president of an Diego-based 
Teledyne Corp. and one-time adminis-
trative assistant of conservative Rep. 
Bob Wilson of California. 
A footnote: Haerle has been criti-
cized for his imminent move to the 
Ford camp on grounds that the Repub-
lican state chairman should be neutral. 
But Haerle won't change his mind, 
A 1975. Meld Enterprisers. Ina 
as a demonstration of confidence in Mr. 
Nedzi personally and in committee 
chairmen in general. But to some de-
gree it also reflected a feeling that 
the investigation of the CIA should not 
be turned over to a bloodthirsty clique 
whose clear purpose is to emasculate it. 
In either event, we're better off as 
a result Either the select committee will 
be immoblized or more likely it will be 
abolished and the investigation turned 
over to a more objective group. 
An investigation is needed, and very 
likely there should be some congres-
sional action along the lines recom-
mended by the Rockefeller Commis-
sion. We're enW.lez.1 to some assurance 
that the CIA will never again venture 
as far beyond its authority as it did in 
the decade before 1973. But the Iasi 
thing we need is a destructive witch 
hunt carried out by fanatics and based 
on excesses which almost certainly no 
longer exist.

Playing Fast and Loose With Truth 
Led Astra 
by Morton H Halperin 
One technique of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
discussed only in passing in the Rockefeller Commis-
sion report released two weeks ago, is dis-information. As 
Philip Agee discusses in his book Inside the Company, the 
agency has expensive facilities for producing fake 
documents and other means for misleading foreigners. 
As with other CIA methods, dis-information has been 
turned against the American people. The clearest and 
most important domestic dis-in forma tion project of the 
agency Was the effort, still going on, to discredit the 
Seymour Hersh story on the CIA's "massive, illegal 
domestic intelligence operations" and to conceal the 
scope of CIA domestic activities. 
From 1953, when a program to open first-class mail 
began, CIA officials had no doubt that they were 
engaging in illegal activities. By May of 1973, if not long 
before, they knew that they had engaged in extensive 
violations of the legislated mandate to avoid internal 
security matters. Yet every effort was made to conceal 
this knowledge. 
In May 1973 jarnes Schlesinger, then director of 
Central Intelligence (DCI) and now f.::.cretary of 
Derpn,:r., C Prj pracr.rit anri frIrrnor emplr,veoc of the 
CIA to bring to his attention any activities that they 
believed to be illegal or in violation of the CIA charter. 
This memorandum produced some hundreds of 
responses and an inspector general's report laying out 
many, but apparently not all, of the activities described 
in the report of the presidential commission. 
Schlesinger's response was to order an end to some of 
the activities. He made no report to the oversight 
committees of the Congress or to the public. Soon 
thereafter he or his successor, William Colby, reduced 
the inspector general's staff and ordered him not to 
conduct any investigations of agency operations. 
As the full extent of the Nixon adrninistration's 
paranoia about domestic dissidents became public, 
questions began to be raised in the Congress about 
whether the CIA had been drawn into any ,of these 
activities. It had, of course, in the -massive way 
discussed below, but CIA officials at first saw no need 
to inform Congress at all. Richard Helms, Schlesinger's 
predecessor as director of Central Intelligence, and.a 
man ubiquitous in the Rockefeller Commission's 
account of CIA misdeeds, was probed on the question 
by Sen. Clifford Case. Helms had been nominated to be 
ambassador to Iran and the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee took the opportunity to ask him about reports of 
CIA domestic activities. In light of the Rockefeller 
.Commission's descriptionof operation CHAOS, direct-
ed at domestic dissidents, and Helms' role in it, one has 
difficulty deciding which is .inc.-)re astonishing?his 
answer or that Helms remains ambassador to Iran. 
Here is the text.: 
Senator Case: If has been called to my attention that in 
1969 or 1970 the WikprikikiedsiR'deiRegliS02,061108108 : OPAIRi3R774)3242R1101340037NRicti..,enee operation" 
by the CIA 
agencies pin in the effort to learn as n: tick as they could-about 
the antiwiir 'movement, and during this period US Army 
Intelligenee became involved and kepi files on US citizens. 
Do you brow anything about any activity on the part of the 
CIA in .that connection? Was it asked to be invc-!ved? 
Mr. Helms : I don't recall whether we were as;:ed, but we 
were not involved because it seemed to me that was a clear 
violation ofWhat our charter was. 
Senator Case. IV:rit do you do in a case like that? 
Mr. Heins. I would iimply go to explain to thc President 
this didn't seen: to me to be advisable. 
The Rockefeller Commission apparently considered 
deception of the American public and possible perjury 
as .beyond the scope of its inquiry into CIA domestic 
. activities. Thus it neither reports nor comments cm this 
testimony. Statements of current Director William 
Colby are treated, in the i same way. One needs, 
therefore, to refer to the published hearings of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee preceding Colby's 
confirmation. to learn that he saw no reason to report to 
that committee, even in closed session, on the results of 
the investigation launched just a few months before as 
a result of the Schlesinger memorandum. Indeed, in 
July 1973, Mr. Colby had this exchange with Sen. 
Senator Symington. As I understand it, you do not 
intend to participate in any way in any domestic intelligence. 
Mr. Colby: I do not, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Symington. Would this prevent you front 
helping to make policy regarding the collection-of inielligence 
on domestic groups? 
Mr. Colby. I believe it would; yes, Mr. Chairman. I--do 
no! see thofas within my responsibilities at all. 
Senator Symington. Would the 1947 act prohibit the 
OA from collecting, or providing the support necessary for 
collecting, intelligence within the US on domestic groups? 
Mr_ Colby. I believe that is the same question, 
essentially. 
Senator Symington. Yes.? 
Mr. Colby. And it would prohibit me fro:n doing.that. 
Sometime after, Mr. Colby. decided to give the sub-
committee to which he 'reports some account of the 
illegal and inappropriate activities uncovered in the 
. Schlesinger investigation. This testimony, which has 
still not been made public, produced no congressional 
action. In desperation one or more middle level officials 
. of the CIA gave Hersh the bare outlines of the story. 
Before publishing his article, Hersh, faithful to New 
York Time; tradition, conferred with Colby. The DO, by 
his account, attempted to convince Hersh, and no doubt.
, Times executives, that the stcfry was 'fundamentally 
wrong and misleading. The Times was in this caSe not 
persuaded and on December 22, .1974 published 
Hersh's account under A four column headline reading 
"Huge CIA Operation Reported in US Against Antiwar 
Forces, Other Dissidents in Nixon Years." The opening 
sentence reported that the CIA had conducted a 
25 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100370007-0 
against the antiwar movement and other dissidents. 
?That phrase?"massive illegal domestic" was to 
become the focus of a massive illegal domestic CIA 
campaign to discredit the Hersh story. As will be 
shown, every fact save one in the Times story is 
confirmed by the commission. 
The agency pulled out all the stops in the effort to 
divert attention from its activities to a discussion of 
how Sy and the Times could have gone so wrong; 
suggestions were put about that both were eager for a 
Pulitzer Prize to get even for The Washington Post's 
Watergate coverage; hence the need to rush into print 
before the end of the year. Reporters with little or no 
prodding came to talk of Sy's carelessness and bias. 
Although neither Hersh nor anyone else could get 
additional detail or further confirmation of the story, it 
would not die and Colby was forced to confront the 
Congress. He picked his target carefully, a closed 
session of the ultra-friendly subcommittee of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee. His opening state-
ment was released to the press and billed as a complete 
description of the agency's domestic activities. This 
January 15, 1975, statement has to be read carefully, 
along with a correction sheet issued quietly a month 
later, and compared to the Rockefeller Commission 
report in order to appreciate the subtleties of dis-
information as practiced by the company. 
The DCI in this statement denies the Hersh story 
fully and frontally. A month later testifying before the 
House Appropriations Committee he characterized his 
earlier testimony as a flat denial of the Times allegations, 
stating that "this operation was neither massive, illegal, 
nor domestic, as alleged." The operation he was 
referring to was CHAOS. That is as good a place as any 
to begin a comparison of the Hersh story,,the Colby 
statement, and the report of the commission appointed 
by President Ford. In the process we can review the 
facts brought about by the official panel while 
examining the agency dis-information campaign. We 
will then be in a position to consider the tone of the 
Rockefeller report and its recommendations. 
peration Chaos. As Hersh acknowledges, he was not 
able to get many details about the special unit set up to 
investigate domestic dissidents. Even its "Get Smart" 
name had not been revealed to him. 
These are the facts he reported: 
O Files were compiled on 10,000 American citizens. 
O Specific individuals were targeted, including one 
antiwar member of Congress. 
? Information on the targeted individuals was collect-
ed from a variety of sources including informants who 
penetrated antiwar groups. . 
O There were names of others in the files, including 
other members of Congress.

said that the) had limited to gathering informa-

were submitted On the activities of American dissi-
dents. He denied:that surveillance had been conducted 
on antiwar Congressmen and, after an initial denial, 
'confirmed that there were files on four members of 
,Congress. In five.pages of testimony, Colby failed to 
. touch on the other specific facts in the Hersh story. 
!The basic ployWas to divert attention away from the 
'details,of what the special unit had done and focus it 
instead on the disputed accuracy of the Times story. 
Until the Rockefeller report was published, this ploy 
had largely succeeded. The Times had pulled Hersh off 
the investigation claiming that he was part of the story 
and could not cover it objectively. Many reporters and 
observers were convinced that there had in fact been no 
massive effort and nothing very illegal, only as Colby had 
put it, a few occasional missteps brought about by 
intense presidential pressure. 
. The writers of the Rockefeller report were well 
'aware of the controversy over "massive illegal domes-
tic" and they were not about to explicitly confirm the 
characterization that had been made the touchstone of 
the accuracy of the. Times story. However they leave the 
reader in little doubt. The operation, the eight 
conservative commissioners concluded, "unlawfully 
exceeded the CIA's statutory authority." Sc much for 
-illegal." As to "domestic," they write unanimously that 
the operation became a "repository for large quantities 
of information on the domestic activities of American 
citizens" and that "much .of the information was not 
directly related to the question of the existence of 
foreign connections with domestic dissidence." 
Notice the use of the adjective "large." The commis-
sion staff must have wan ted to avoid "massive.- Earlier, 
they had referred to a "veritable mountain of material," 
and a paragraph summing up the activities of this unit, 
which at its peak had more than 50 employees, reads as. 
follows: ; 
By August 1973, when the foregoing Colby memoran-
dum was written, the paper trail left by Operation CHAOS 
included somewhere in the area of 13,000 files on subjects 
and individual.; (including approximately 7,200 personality 
or files); orer 71.000 men:ay-an:1.a. re;-ort5 and ILIteri;

In addition, the CHAOS group hact generated, or caused the 
generation of, over 12,000 cables of various types, as well as: 
a handful of memoranda to high-level government officials. 
On lop of this veritable mountain of material was a

system of CHAOS had indexed some 300,000 names of 
citizens and domestic organizations. Specific individu-
als, those with -201 files," were the targets of 
information gathering from many sources including 
the penetration of antiwar groups. While the commis-
sion found no evidence that a congressman was 
specifically targeted, the "inaccuracy" in the Hersh 
story is simple to explain. An agent of the CHAOS 
operation "became involved as an adviser in a United 
States congressional campaign and, for a limited period, 
furnished reports to CHAOS of behind-the-scenes 
activities inthe campaign." The activities were,. as 
Hersh reported, conducted by a special 'unit reporting 
directly to the DCI. This unit Was, as he explained, 
originally set up to gather evidence of foreign 
connections and grew into a domestic intelligence 
operation. Finally, a series of reports was produced and 
at least one forwarded to Kissinger. 
In describing these reports, the commission blows 
the agency cover that, as Colby put it, this was a 
"counterintelligence operation directed at possible 
? foreign links to American dissidents," and that it was a 
proper activity observing the limits on CIA domestic 
activity. 
The commission report describes some eight studies 
prepared by the CIA on the antiwar movement in the. 
United States in the period between November 1967 
and January 1971 and forwarded outside the agency. 
These studies reached the same conclusion: there was 
no evidence that foreign governments or agencies 
? controlled or directed domestic dissident movements or 
provided financial assistance to them. The agency 
didn't have any doubt about this, nor does the 
commission report on any evidence to the contialy. 
If the agency knew that its efforts were not directed 
at studying what it kneia, to be a nonexistent 
connection, neither did it have any doubts about the 
impropriety of what it was doing. In sending one study, 
"Restless Youth," to Walt Rostow in the Johnson White 
House, Helms wrote that "You will, of course, be aware 
of the peculiar sensitiVity which attaches to the fact 
that CIA has prepared .a report on student activities 
both here and abroad.' In forwarding a second copy of 
the report to Henry Kissinger in February of 1969, 
Helms was even more explicit: 
lit an effort to r,12o:d-out our discaion of this subject: i.ve

In addition to confirming all of the facts. of the Hersh 
story regarding the CHAOS unit, the presidential 
commission provided considerably more detail of its 
operations. Several items are worthy of note in light of 
the CIA effort to paint the unit's activities as proper. 
On three occasions, the commission notes, ac.:?nts 
who had infiltrated the antiwar movement were sent 
on specific assignments wholly concerned with domes-
tic activities. One of these assignments yielded 47 
separate disseminations to the FBI with such titles as 
"Plans for Future Anti-War Activities on the West 
Coast." As the commissionexplains, the bulk of these 
'reiated soleVio aomestic activities. 
_ . 
Another agent reported on the high-level leadership' 
activities of a?clissident group, and a third infiltrated the 
group planning May Day demonstrations. 
'Approved For Release 20011cwo 
aa. he CHAOS unit had a watch list of some 1000 
organizations and thousands of individuals. Forty-one 
names from this list were sent to the unit opening mail 
in New York; it sent back a two-file-drawer load of 
material obtained from the illegal opening of mail. 
Names from the list were also supplied to tl?n 
National Security Agency, identified .by the commis-
sion delicately only as "another agency." NSA rnoni-
toted the overseas phone calls of those on the list, in 
.violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, and 
provided some 1100 pages to the CHAOS -unit. 
Other. Domestic Surveillance Programs. Thus far I have 
discussed all of the facts in the original Hersh story 
related to surveillance of domestic dissidents except 
.one. This is the assertion that CIA agents followed and 
photographed participants in antiwar demonstrations_ 
Not so, said Mr. Colby in his January statement to the 
Congress. He went on to detail several instances of 
surveillance of American citizens but said that they 
related to leaks of information or assassination plots. 
According to the Rockefeller Commission report that 
statement to the Senate committee was simply false. 
Participants in antiwar rallies were followed by CIA 
agents as part of a totally different program that is not 
mentioned at all in the original Hersh story. 
Colby touched briefly on these activities in his 
statement, telling the Senate committee that beginning 
in 1967 the CIA office of security, acting out of fear of 
the safety of its installations in the Washington area, 
has inserted 10 agents into dissident organizations to 
;.-Ither information "relating to plans for dernor.stra-
t;:r.,n:.:, Or IOCCI1r.:-.1715." 
The presidential commission tells a different story 
The program, which ran froin February 1967 to 
December 1968, involved many different agents, 
although no more than 12 at any one time. These 
agents penetrated a number of different organizations 
including the Women's Strike for Peace, the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the National 
Mobilization Committee to End the War, and the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The 
infiltrators sought to learn whatever they could about 
the organizations, including their domestic sources of 
funds and the names of those who attended meetings. 
To learn their identities, some of the participants in 
these meetings were followed home. In the words of 
the report, "the Agency's .infiltration of dissident 
groups in the Washington area went far beyond steps 
necessary to protect the Agency's own facilities, 
personnel and operations." 
The DCI made no mention in his.statement. to the 
congressional committees of yet a third CIA operation 
directed at domestic dissidents. This entirely separate 
project, run by the Office of Security, maintained more 
than 5000 files on dissident organizations and individu-
als including some 12,000 names, and published weekly 
from 1968 to 1972 "Situation Information Reports" 
dealing with dissident activity in the US. 
titer illegal activities. The Hersh story reported that in 
addition to the activities directed at domestic dissidents, 
the CIA had also engaged in dozens of other illegal 
activities, including "break-ins, wiretapping, and the 
surreptitious opening of mail." These, Hersh reported, 
were a "different category of domestic activities carried 
8 (;) telAsRDPV7430.32ROM100-878QCVA spec t ed foreign 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100370007-0 
intelligence." These facts too were fully confirmed in 
the Rockefeller report. The commission provided the. 
details Hersh could not get and it yields insight into the 
agency's view of its relation to the laws of the land. 
The commission report devotes considerable atten-
tion to the agency's programs to open first-class mail. 
These operations, running from 1953 to 1973, were the 
largest, clearly illegal and unconstitutional programs 
discovered by the commission. Colby in his statement 
to the Senate committee dealt with these allegations in 
deadpan fashion in .a single page. He asserted that the 
primary purpose was to identify individuals in active 
correspondence with Cornmunist countries for "coun-
terintelligence purposes, the results being shared with 
the FBI.? That sentence would not enable one to infer 
that the CIA did not even inform the FBI that it was 
operating the program. It was only when the bureau 
approached .the postal authorities to propose a similar 
scheme of mail covers that the agency told the bureau 
what it was.up to and agreed to share the fruits. 
Colby's .statement does not acknowledge that the 
roerarn was ille;a1 end smconstitut it is 
from the commission report that Ive learn that the 
agency was aware from the beginning that the 
operation was illegal and that CIA officials, including 
Richard Helms, deliberately deceived postal authorities 
into thinking that the operation was limited to mail 
covers, Le., to the copying of information off envelopes. 
The details .of how the agency deceived postal 
-authorities provides an interesting study of CIA dis-
information techniques as applied to other government 
agencies. The discussion of."crwer stories" to use with 
the public should the operations' existence leak. 
provides evidence of the conscious nature of the CIA's 
use of false information to mislead the public. 
A 'careful reading of the Colby statement gives no 
hint as to the scope or dimensions of the program. The 
DCI lists each of the operations reported by the 
commission with the significant exception of 12 
separate operations to open the mail of American 
citizens who had no connection with the agency. But 
there is no suggestion of the magnitude revealed by the 
commission report: 
Seiti.;!iCs g;% by the CIA show that in the last full year 
of its operation, the New York mail intercept handled 
approximItely 4,350,000 items of mail and examined the 
outside c,:er 2,300,000 of those items. Photographs were 
taken of the exteriors of approximately 33,000 items. Some 
8,700 items were opened and the contents analyze.d. 
Selections for opening were made on the basis.of a watch list 
given to the crew and upon various other intelligence factors. 
During the last year, approximately 5,000 of the selections 
were m.7.ie on the basis of the watch list. 
In the l:ist year, the program made over 3,800 separate 
disserni!!ati,,ns of information deriped from the project within 
the Agencv and sent some 1,400 separate items of 
.inform:7tion to the FBI. At the end of 1972, the active watch 
list of ncores totaled approximately 600. The number of 
nam es :cat: varied from month to month as they were 
supplied by CIA components and the FBI. 
Although only mail ioming into the United Slates was 
intercepted inlhe early yeiirs of I he proient, both outgoing and 
incoming mail were involved during most of the project's 
operation. CIA personnel estimate that, overall, approxi-
mately 30 percent of the mail intercepted was outgoing.

were also maintained for reference and analytical purposes. 
One minor CIA ploy not cleared up by the commis-
sion report concerns the opening of mail to and from 
non-Communist countries. The original Colby state-
ment talked of opening mail to and front "two 
Communist countries." In a correction sheet released a 
month later that phrase was changed to "countries, 
mostly Communist." The commission does not com-
ment on change (as noted it refers not at all to these 
Coiby -,t.i.e.-n.ent-;) and seetns to suggest that only nail 
to and prom Communist states was opened. Colby told 
the Senate that the last of the ,mail surveillance 
program ended in 1973. He neglected to mention that 
this was only.because a postal inspector, who had been a 
CIA official, ordered the agency to end the program_ 
The Rockefeller Commission report deals with the 
charges of illegal wiretaps and burglaries in a single 
section in which it discusses agency "special coverage" 
of American citizens. As usual we find Colby with his 
numbers too low and with no hint of illegality_ The 
DCI's statement reports four break-ins; the commis-
sion found 12. Colby admits to 27 wiretaps; the 
, commission found 32 and 32 bugs in addition. It also 
found J. illegal examinations of tax returns ancithe 12 
individual mail openings described above. The commis-
sion reports more than 100 cases of "special coverage" 
involving one or more of these techniques. 
Despite the alleged comprehensive nature of his 
description of CIA domestic activities, Colby did not 
report on other illegal or unauthorized activities noted 
by the commission in its report. Among these are: 
O giving LSD to unsuspecting Americans, one of 
whom killed himself as a result 
O holding a defector in solitary confinement in the 
United States for three years 
0 aiding the Bureau of Narcotics in violation of the 
CIA charter 
e giving gratuities to local police forces 
e securing telephone records for the National Security 
Agency. 
,In many of these and other cases the Commission 
reaches the conclusion that the agency clearly violated 
its charter, the laws of the land, and the Constitution. 
^ he Report. When the Rockefeller panel was appointed 
by the President, many critics predicted that this panel 
:of eight establishment figures, including, besides the 
Vice President, Ronald Reagan, Lyman Lemnitzer and 
C. Douglas Dillon, would produce a whitewash. First 
, reactions to the report reflected pleasant surprise.at the 
detail provided. However a closer look makes plain why 
the commission reveals what it did. The tone and 
recommendations of the report reveal the next line of 
defense to which supporters of the CIA are retreating. 
Early in its deliberations the Rockefeller Commission 
must have become aware of the Schlesinger study and 
? the inspector general's report covering most, if not all,. 
of the episodes in the commission report.. The 
.commission members knew that the Church commit-
tee investigating this matter for the Senat:, had this 
material and would eventually make it public. To fail to 
provide the information ,now would be to discredit the 
entire commission and its recommendations when the 
SCIIALREWThile2itmonitosylc**oba te on what to 
do got underway. A report issued nowwithout detailed 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100370007-6 
facts wouid have been branded as a whitewash. 
The candid tone of the report has earned it a 
respectful hearing. Many editorial writers and com-
mentators have adopted the tone and approach of the 
report. The abuses are to be deplored but we need a 
secret intelligence agency to counter the Communists. 
The commission's style is reflected in the second 
chapter of the report titled the "Need for Intelligence," 
which notes that the "United States remains the 
.e.. 
principal intelligence target of the Communist bloc." 
The chapter closes with this curious sentence: 
Americans halie a right to be uneasy if not seriously disturbed 
at the real possibility that their personal and business 
activities which they discuss freely over the telephone could be 
recorded and analyzed by agents of foreign powers. 
One would suppose that this is intended in some %Ar ay to 
justify the same intrusions on our privacy by the CIA. 
Having set the tone in the, opening section, the 
.commission remains consistent. Flagrant abuses of the 
Constitution are described with no sense of outrage. 
Agency explanations of the need to take the illegal 
actions in order to perform its assigned missions are 
accepted in general without question. The commission 
members evidently believe that the agency has the 
right to investigate what it calls "dissident" organiza-
tions and individuals even if they have broken no laws 
and show every intention of remaining law abiding. 
The commission knows a "dissident" when it sees one. 
Thus it reports without comment that such peaceful 
and nonviolent groups as the Women's Strike for Peace 
and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, 
among others, are dissident groups but reports that a 
few non-dissidents such as Father Hesburgh somehow 
crept into the files. 
When it turns to recommendations, the commission 
lays out the approach likely to be adopted by the Ford 
administration, the agency and its supporters. First the 
report notes that many of the activities discussed in the 
report were terminated in 1973. It presents a total of 29 
recommendations of various kinds. On the whole they 
add up to saying that the President and the. director 
should issue instructions that the agency roust obey the 
law. Various internal monitoring mechanisms are to be 
'beefed up and a joint congressional oversight commit-
tee is to be created. The budget of the agency might, the 
commission suggests, be made public at least in part and 
other material should be declassified. At the same time 
the commission endorses a law making it a crime for 
present or former employees to divulge classified 
information learned in the course of their employment. 
The commission doesn't even comment on the fact that 
such a law would have made criminal the.leaks that 
forced the information in the report to surface. 
Most important, are the commission's recommenda-
tions on what domestic security functions the agency 
should have. The basic commission approach is to avoid 
the problem of the agency violating its charter in the 
future by authorizing it to do the things it has done in 
the past in violation of its charter. lithe recommenda-
tions of the commission ere accepted, the .--,gcncy 
would be able to resume most .of the . progiattri4 it 
terminate.d.in 1973 subject only to whatever deference 
it chooses to give to the Constitution' and the general 
laws of the land. 
These startling suggestions are stated so matter of 
factly as recommendations (1) and (2) that they have 
occasioned little comment. In recommendation (1), the 
commission proposes that the agency be permitted to 
approach willing sources in the United States openly ? 
and be prohibited from efforts directed at unknowing 
American citizens. It would thereby sanction covert 
operations aimed at gathering intelligence from 
foreigners in the United States. Then, in recommenda-
tion (2), the commission would authorize the agency to 
engage in collection of information about American 
citizens in the following circumstances: 
a/ Persons presently or formerly affiliated, or being 
considered for affiliation, with the CIA, directly or 
indirectly, or others who require clearance by Me CIA to 
receive classified information; 
b) Persons or activities that pose a clear threat to CIA 
facilities or personnel, provided that proper coordination with 
the FBI is accomplished: 
cl Persons suspected of espionage or other illegal octioities 
relating to foreign intelligence, provided that proper 
coordination with the FBI is accomplished_ 
Thus, the agency would have authority for most of 
its domestic programs. These proposals would, of 
course, give the agency the domestic police and internal 
security functions that Congress explicitly denied to 
the CIA when it set up the agency in 1947. It would 
ignore the warnings issued then about the dangers of a 
super secret agency coming to operate at home and 
infringe on the liberties of American citizens. And it 
would do so in the face of   200 pages of its own 
evidence that those fears were well founded. 
The legislative history of the creation of the CIA is 
very clear. Congress intended that the agency do 
nothing in the US but maintain a headquarters and 
train its personnel. That there was to be only one 
exception to this rule?the overt collection of informa-
tion about foreign activities from willing sources in the 
US?is made explicit in an exchange between a 
congressman and Alien Dulles in a cloae.cl House 
hearing on the bill creating the agency. 
In light of the evidence presented by the commission, 
it would be foolhardy to do anything but return to this 
original understanding. The CIA must be told by the 
Congress that it may not operate at home. Congress 
must spell out in explicit detail all of the things that 
cannot be done. It must then make the violations of this 
law and failure to report the violations to the Attorney 
General criminal offenses. The right to sue for civil 
damages should also be made available to those whose 
rights are violated by the agency. 
Nothing short of this will be sufficient to create even 
the 'possibility that the agency will not in the future 
succumb to external or internal pressures and resume 
its massive illegal domestic surveillance' . 
In the domestic field what must be done is clear. The 
connni,aiion has givriea all the fai. ',a 51-1,,Aln-2ed to 
conclude that a secret spy agency cannot be permitted 
- to operate at home. We can expect a new dis-
information campaign to assure os that all is well and 
that ive need only to adopt the commission proposal, lf 
the Congress and the public fall for that line they will 
get the government they deserve.

Arbeiderbladet, Oslo, 12 June 1975 (Norwegian Labor Party) 
INVESTIGAIION OF CIA - 
Paranoia is Greek and is used as an indication of illness characterized 
by systematic, firmly-anchored delusions. There are a number of variations. 
One of them is inventor-paranoia. 
, It was the latter Variety that during the course of the Vietnam decade 
insinuated itself in the office of the American president. In the Width 
House in Washington enemies of society were discovered all over the. American 
society. Active and passive critics of USA's war in Vietnam were shadowed 
and photographed. Demonstrators' mail was opened, their telephones were 
tapped. Dissenters were duly recorded in files by the tens of thousands. 
This began seriously under President Lyndon B. Johnson and was developed 
further quickly under President Richard Nixon. Nixon was not only convinced - 
that the Americans who openly declared disagreement with the Vietnam policy, 
.in reality all those who were a danger to the country's morale (he often' 
used those words), but also he went a step further: Nixon critics were 
suspected of belonging to a network centered iniXoscaw. Ultra red and 
contagious. 
TheWatergate'hearings disclosed that it was during Nixon's presidency--
at the president's order--that the American intelligence organization CIA 
systematically began to overstep the statutes Congress had passed for the 
organization's activities. When CIA was set up in 1947, Congress had 
established by law that CIA should limit its activities to other lands. 
The Federal police, FBI, would be responsible for domestic security. 
In 1970 Richard Nixon had reached the point where he had convinced 
himself that J. Edgar Hoover, FBI chief, no longer had the necessary 
fervor and the right drive for hunting down comnunista and foreigh agents. 
Monday evening the so-called Rockefeller Commission publicized its 
300-page report on CIA's activity. For the first time the legal infringe-
ments we have cited were officially confirmed. The report also describes 
other excesses and infringement of internationally-recognized human rights. 
CIA agents, for example, experimented with the drug LSD on people who were 
unaware of this. One defector was held in solitary confinement for three 
years because CIA had suspicions that the man was actually a planted spy. 
What makes the Rockefeller fommission: report especially. effective is 
the composition of. the commission. None of the eight members can be 
described as a dissenter. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller has long been 
a member of the Foreign intelligence Board;vhich is charged among other 
things with keeping an overview of CIA but which has never followed up 
reports of excesses. Five of the members have had in one way or another 
contact with the intelligence organization. 
The Commission correctly places emphasis on the fact an effective 
intelligence organization isof decisive importance for national security 
and often also a medium to serve in the relaxation of tensions. The 
Commission has found it to be necessary to recommend that a permanent 
control mechanism be set up, a control commission under the President's

It was just before midnight. Moonlight 
glinted off the waters of the Caribbean. The 
lone car on the coastal highway, a chauffeur-
driven limousine, sped westward toward the 
Dominican city of San Cristobal. 
The limousine's two occupants, chauffeur 
and passenger, at first failed to notice the 
green Chevrolet that followed them ? and by 
the time they became aware of the vehicle, it 
was too late. 
. The Chevrolet pulled alongside, spraying'

Both cars came to a halt. The chauffeur,

The scenario marked the end of the 30-year 
dictatorship of Gen. Rafael Leonidas Trujillo 
Molina. 
The whole incident, which took place May 
30, 1961, was long thought to have been solely 
the work of Dominican patriots, including 
Antonio Imbert Barreras, the driver of the 
Chevrolet, who himself became a general in 
the years after the assassination of General 
Trujillo. 
But this weekend, there is mounting evi-
dence? that the United States Central In-
telligence Agency (CIA) had a hand in the 
affair. 
? In fact, Washington sources say that the 
U.S. contributed "significant material sup-
port" to the Trujillo assassination. 
Efforts this weekend to reach General 
Imbert, the lone survivor of the team of 
assassins, failed, but other Dominican sources 
say that "there were lots of CIA agents in 
Santo Domingo,' in the weeks before the: 
Trujillo assassination." 
If all this information proves true, it will be 
the first specific instance in which there is 
proof the CIA successfully participated in the,

assassination of a foreign leader. 
. Speculation that the CIA had a hand in a 
number of such assassinations has been 
growing since the first of the year. 
Just what the motive was for participating 
in the Trujillo assassination is not clear, nor is 
it clear at what level in the administrations of 
either President Kennedy or President Eisen-
hower it might have been ordered. T 
assassination took place four months after 
John F. Kennedy became President and only 
weeks after the unsuccessful Bay of Pip 
invasion of Cuba, which had been organiz 
under President Eisenhower although carried 
out under President Kennedy. 
The Trujillo assassination sparked a mas-
sive roundup of anti-Trujillo Dominicans. 
Accordir.g to a Dominican government source, 
one of those picked up, who had been involv 
in the acutal assassination, said after having 
been tortured, that the arms used in the 
incident had been supplied by the CIA. 
It seems that no CIA agent was direct 
involved in the Trujillo assassination. But 
apparently quite a few gave material and 
perhaps physical help iri'settirp. up the etent.

BALTIMORE SUN 
17 June 1975 
Will West's broadcasts to East die? - 
cis1s-at to .roe 
Ey GENE OISH1 
5s; Sun Staff Corresprndent 
' Munith?Radio Free Eu-
rope is undergoing a crisis of 
confidence and morale after a 
being hit by a budgetary 
Squeeze and another wave of " 
layoffs. ? 
Some see it as the begin-
ning of the end for the radio 
station, which broadcasts dai-
ly to Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Romania and Bul-
garia to inform the people 
there about the events in the 
West as well is developments 
in their own countries. 
- While not all see the future 
so darkly, there is general 
agreement that the budgetary 
difficulties .faced by the or-
ganization - will reduce the 
? effectiveness and quality of 
aot only its broadcasting but 
also of its highly regarded re.; 
search 'operation.. 
The same could be true for'' 
Radio Liberty, also based 
here and which broadcasts in-
to the Soviet Union. But the 
next round of staff reductions 
of about 150 apparently will - 
fall most heavily within Radio 
Free Europe:  
The mood at Radio Liber-
ty, therefore, while not bright, 
is not quite as pessimistic. ? 
At Radio ? Free Europe I: 
some see the present situation 
as a crisis comparable to the 
? early 1970's when both Radio ? 
'Free Europe and Radio Liber-
ty were cut off from the funds 
from the Central Intelligence 
a 
Agency. 
At that time, there was op-
position in Congress "against 
continuing the two operations 
out of regularly budgeted 
:funds. Senator William Ful-
bright (D., Ark.), then chair-
man of the Senate Foreign 
;Relations Committee, in par-
ticular, questioned the'pro-
priety of continuing- the two 
stations during a period of 
East-West detente. - - 
; Since then, both organiza-
tions have gained respectabil-
ity with the creation of the 
?Board for International 
Broadcasting in Washington 
to oversee their operations. 
The ' board is criticized 
here, however, for not being 
'vigorous enough in looking 
after the interest of ? its 
charges. Under its steward-
ship, the two stations have 
had to cut their staffs by a 
third because of insufficient 
funds. . ? , - 
? David Abshire, the chair-
man of the board, told con-
gressional budget commit-
tees, for example,' that be-
cause of the devaluation of 
the dollar and inflation an op-
eration that cost $30 million 
in 1968 would cost more than 
$80 rnMicn for fiscol Asi V. 
Nevertheless, the board 
asked for only $65.6 million 
? 
for fiscal 1976, and only be-
cause of one-time needs to. 
make up for overdue pension 
fund contributions, renovation 
of the building and replace-
ment of old equipment. 
For fiscal 1977, he prom-
ised to reduce the budget re-
quest to $57 million, which is 
the reason for the reduction in 
staff which already is begin-
ning. 
Radio Free Europe sources 
Said the board made the com-
mitment without studying the 
inevitable consequences. One 
source called it a "verdict of 
slow death," adding, "in two 
or three years we will be ex-
tinct." 
One department head said 
the cutbacks mean the loss of 
some of his top talent, with no 
possibility of replacing them. 
Because of the German labor 
laws, he said, the cutbacks 
cannot be made selectively to 
weed out the least effective 
personnel. 
Many of those being laid 
S create 
uro e 
? .7 
off, he said il are the Ounger 
members of the staff, "our. 
fresh blood, the people Who 
represent our future." 
Others noted that, even if ' 
funds were available, it is dif-
ficult to find qualified persons 
willing to come to what could 
become a moribund organiza-
tion. 
The cutbacks, according to 
Radio Free Europe sources, 
will mean cuts in programing, 
which currently ranges from 
19 hours a day for Czechoslo-
vakia to 8 hours a day for Bul-
garia, to an estimated total 
audience of about 30 million. 
Perhaps of More general 
concern is the likelihood of 
cutbacks in research. Radio 
a Free Europe subscribes to 
more than 600 East European 
newspapers and periodicals, 
zdcI it! rdri tr.! 
transcribing radio reports 
from the various. East-bloc 
countries 
Its publications, including 
special reports based on this 
information as well as sur-
veys of the East-bloc press, 
are sent out to more than 1,-
100 subscribers, who include 
universities and other aca-
demic institutions, individual 
scholars, journalists, Western 
foreign ministries as well as 
the United States State De-
partment. . 
While the research section 
at Radio Liberty is not quite 
I as extensive, it keeps tabs ow 
more than 500 newspapers 
and journals, most of them 
from the Soviet Union, but al-
so publications that deal with 
the problems of the country 
published in the West. 
. Both organizations receive 
a constant stream of scholars 
and journalists who make use 
of their archives, which gen-
erally are acknowledged to be 
the best of their kind in the 
world, 
' Radio Liberty, moreover, - 
has a growing collection of 
the so-called samizdat docu-
ments?underground publica- ? 
tions of Soviet dissident 
groups?which Albert Boiter, 
its chief of research, says is 
more complete than what the 
KGB, the Soviet secret police, 
has. 
While both organizations 
Are products of the cold war, 
advocates insist that the oper-
ations are even more essential - 
during a period of detente. 
The two stations, for ex-
ample, intend to broadcast de-
tails of the declarations on 
freer human contacts to 
which the Soviet bloc will 
agree at the European Securi-
ty Conference but is not likely 
to publicize. 
Others say that the two 
ta4,1.4.1V?AAN ?0?11C au,4-? 111? 
creased because the Voice of 
America, a State Department 
operation, has softened ? its 
broadcasts and reduced its 
commentaries in the interest 
of detente. ? 
It is also noted that the 
Voice, the BBC and other 
Western broadcasts heard in 
the East report mainly on 
events around the world and 
do not deal as much as Radio 
Free Europe and Radio Liber-
ty with internal developments 
of the countries to which they 
broadcast. 
Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, 
the Russian novelist expelled 
from the Soviet Union, for ex-
ample, said after his exile 
that his main source of infor-
mation on what was happen-
ing in his country was Radio 
Liberty. 
One broadcaster noted that 
Moscow was increasing its 
foreign language propaganda 
broadcasts and to cut back on 
U.S. broadcasts to the East 
would be a "one-sided conces-
sion to the Soviet Union."

Washington. 
; The United States has long regarded 
C the United Nations as an unpromising 
child, but one which?thank God?at 
least had the admirable habit of obedi-
ence. Now that even that virtue has dis-
solved in a fiery show of independence, 
What's a parent to do? 
Spank, prescribes Daniel Patrick' 
, Moynihan, who has been picked to be the 
. next U.S. ambassador to the U.N. be-
cause his ideas on the organization ap-
peal to President Ford. In a well-publi-
cized article in the March issue of Corn-
montrim and a 02in in rarant tactirrinny 
before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, Mr. Moynihan laid out his 
formula for whipping the U.N. back into 
? ? shape. ? 
The problem, as Mr. Moynihan sees 
it, lies largely in the Fabian socialism 
which many Third-World U.N. members 
absorbed, while still colonies, from a 
dying British Empire. The solution, he 
argued, is to. prove the advantages of 
American (or Japenese) capitalism over 
these unhealthy socialist transplants, 
V and to expose the hypocrisies of Third-
World officials who see political injus: 
tice everywhere but at home or .in the 
Soviet Union. 
In his testimony Mr. Moynihan also 
endorsed the suggestion of Arthur Gold-
berg, a former U.N. ambassador, that 
S. the United States withdraw from the or-
e gahization if Israel is expelled. 
? Mr. Moynihan's get-tough attitude 
seems to be in tune with public, as well 
. as presidential sentiments. Mail to the 
- U.S. Mission to the U.N. and public opin-
ion polls show disillusionment and anger 
with the behavior of a General Assembly 
. dominated by the Third-World bloc. ? 
But there is another view. It holds 
that the United Nations, despite faults, 
has accomplished immeasurable?and 
generally unremarked?good , for the 
world; and that American delegations; 
far from being too passive in the defense 
of U.S. interests, have been too stubborn 
in demanding their way. And although 
' the United Nations seems to have be-
come a populai? target among liberals as 
well as conservatives, it was this view 
which predominated among Mr. Moyni-
han's less publicized isUnsNePor

would not dispute its usefulness as a sup-. 
plier of policemen and observers in crime

1948 to the most recent Middle EtaStn.

Mr. Gardner divides the U.M.'e funtese, 
tions into two systems, the rhetorieaL; 
and the active. The latter does mostenfe 
the work and the former?the debatezeof ? 
the General Assembly and other vorgOtir' 
--:-gets all the attention. e ? _I I 11,1 
It was three General Assembly vcifee--7 
in the last session that crystalized the 
growing American anger with the: 
"tyranny of the majority." The: Assem-
bly expelled South Africa, accorded 
ser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, thee' 
honors of a head of state, and adoptet 
the "Charter of Economic Rights and 
Duties of States." ..:aLsee 
The Ford administration's critic:3.4;4; 
not, on the whole, blame the administek 
tion ?or the American public?for being-
' angry over these actions. Indeed, eneleya 
of them share the annoyance. But moat , 
of them differ radically from the .admineit 
i.tr,tien diagneisin: the 
hind those unpleasant symptoms antilite 
prescribing a treatment that might help.6 
, The General Assembly, they argue, Was', 
only registering, not generating, thee 
anger felt in the Third World toward dig 
? United States. Any treatment milk' 
? therefore deal with the reasons .for-tha--; 
anger, not with the General Assembly; 
Mr. Gardner agrees that the assets:1-e; 
bly's double standard on the Middle Eist. 
and on economic and human rights 
tions "is often deplorable" But, he said 
in his testimony, "It is an unhappy fa 
that United States leadership has been' 
badly damaged by Vietnam, Watergate,, 
economic mismanagement and neglect 
of Third-World interests. So if that UeVII, 
reflection is ugly, it's not the: mirrom 
ee? 
that's to blame." 
As treatment, these administration 
, ? critics propose co-option and co-opera--
tion rather than confrontation. The ling 
ed States would, for example, conce,- 
. that Third-World producers of raw ma-
terials have gotten bad deals in the past, 
?.. and it would work to set up a .system to: 
protect both consumers and producers 
from wild price fluctuations. It would., 
work to ensure that Multinational cor-
porations do not exploit weak govern-
? rnents. It would work to draw develop-
ing countries into wider participation in , 
the financial agencies that affect them: 
so critically. 
Above all, the critics would have the 
united States make a bigger effort to" 
get the United Nations to work: to beef 
up its detegations?quantitatively ana4 
qualitatively; to make the U.N.-a central" 
part of its diplomacy, rather than a for--
- 
a former chairman of the Foreign Rela; 
tions. Committee, said the United States, 
accustomed to getting its way in the 
early years of the U.N., has turned into a 
poor loser. "It seems to me that the 
great-power role has gone to our head . 
and 'we have not learned to take the 
brickbats and setbacks philosophically _ 
and the tail-tweaking with good humor. ? 
When opposed, we pick up our marbles 
and go off to play by ourselves, making , 
the situation only worse." . 
The witnesses for the defense in the 
U.N. hearings had little trouble making 
a case for the organization's utility in 
the nuts-and-bolts business of running a 
planet. Indeed, even most of the U.N.'s 
severest Critics concede that if it were 
abolished overnight, something would 
have to be invented to take the place of 
the two dozen specialized agencies it op-
erates 
To the extent that some aeencies 
touch on areas with political as well as 
practical content?the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, for example 
--their effectiveness may be diluted by 
national jealousies. But in less ideologie 
cal areas, the international bureaucracy 
can have decisive clout. U.N. agencies 
have all but 'wiped out smallpox, have 
made English the universal language of 
international traffic, and have made na-
tional stamps valid for the international 
mails. . ? 
The various international financial, 
economic, and trade agencies that oper-
ate:under the U.N. or in close co-opera-
tion with it have been essential in pro-
viding the ground rules for international 
barter and the funding for economic de-
velopment in poorer countries. While the 
General Assembly and the Security 
Council dominate the decreasing amount 
of news space devoted to the U.N. these 
,days, it is these agencies of economic co-
operation that do the most work. They 
use 90 per cent of the U.N. system's an-
ual budget of ;1.5 billion. . . 
Richard N. Gardner, a former deputy 
assistant secretary of state who is now 
the U.S. member and the rapporteur of a 
committee appointed by the Secretary 
General to propose changes in the U.N.'s 
system of economic agencies, told the

Many of Soviet Emigrants 
Reported Asking to Return 
MOSCOW, June 7 (Reuters) 
?The Communist party news-
paper Pravda says that the 
Soviet Embassy in Washington 
has received "hundreds of ap-
plications" from recent ,emi-
grants who want to return to 
the Soviet Union. 
The report was in an article 
yesterday by Ytiliyan Sem-
yonov, who has been touring 
the United States as a special 
correspondent for Pravda. 
"There are hundreds of ap-
plications lying in our consu-
late, and many of them are 
tragic," he wrote. 
- Mr. Semyonov quoted from 
one of the letters: 
"I came here with my two 
children, and I know there can 
be no forgiveness for me. But I 
beg you to allow my children, 
who have not yet come of age, 
to return to the motherland." 
The Soviet Union normally 
,refuses to allow the permanent 
return of emigrants, who usual-
ly have to renounce their 
citizenship to gain an exit visa. 
,Bondish asPeeti?of eapionagel 
work, the Soviet secret service 
has been credited with perfect-
:inggenious coding systems, tiny 
lass assination weapons and un-
!telling devices to promote co-
vert operations. But Western 
specialists believe the KBG is 
still basically agent-oriented 
and remains far behind ,the 
C.I.A. in technology. 
There is no evidence that it 
has displayed any of the scien-
tific daring, technical know 
how or financial risk compara-
ble to the successful C.I.A. ef-
fort-to recover part of a sunken 
Soviet submarine last summer 
in the Pacific northwest of Ha-
waii. That venture, involving 
a salvage vessel specially built 
by Howard Hughes enterprises, 
is said to have cost more than 
$350-million. 
Nor is there anything in the 
ambitious Soviet submarine-de-
velopment program comparable 
to- the electronic surveillance 
missions of United States Navy 
submarines, which are said to 
have tapped Soviet coastal com-
munications cables, monitoring 
on;shcre missile firings !and! 
identified individual Soviet sub-: 
marines by their sound pat-
terns. 
As ,for covert operations 
abroad, the K.G.B. maintains 
a strong capability, in the 
estimate of Western analysts. 
Aimeng the most recent 
K.G.B. involvements in insur-
gencies weie in Portugal's 
African territories in Cambo-
dia and Laos and in the 
Dhofar region of Oman. Po-
tential guerrilas are recruited 
by the .K.G.B. and then' passed 
on to the G.R.U.?the Soviet 
military intelligence service?
for training. 
The K.G.B. maintains a very 
large operation in Thailand, a 
New York Times correspondent 
reports, presumably to control 
operations throughout Indo-
china., - 
?? 
' Must Wait on the Porch 
Visitors to the Soviet Embas-
sy, where the K.G.B. has ,its 
offices, are asked to wait , on 
the front porch and staff mem-
bers come out to meet them. 
Western intelligence operatives 
assume the 15-member Soviet 
trade delegation in Bangkok 
consists primarily of K.G.B. of-
ficers since Thai-Soviet trade 
amounted to $6-million last 
year. The rent and services 
for the trade delegation are 
estimated at $500,000 annually. 
Since 1958, the Thai Govern-
ment has expelled nine Soviet 
officials after they had been 
identified by Western intel-
ligence agencies as K.G.B. offi-
cers. 
Western analysts believe the 
K.G.B. has abandoned its prac-
tice of, "wet affairs"?the So-
viet euphemism for covert ac-
tions like assassinations. 
' According to Oleg A. Lyalin, 
a"wet\affairs" specialist who 
defected in Britain in 1971 
causing the expulsion of 105 
Soviet spies, the K.G.B. halted 
its political assassination! pro-
gram in 1959. But Mr. Lyalin 
said that the K.G.B. retained 
!plans for assination and cab I 
!otage of vital installations in 
the event of a war threat. 
1 In the opinion of Western 
'specialists, the K.G.B. has re-i 
ceived orders from Mr. Brezh-
nev not to undertake any 
operations that would com-
promise or undermine his poll-
ee/ ? of relaging tensions with 
the. United States and other 
Western countries. 
Close to '10,000 Soviet and 
Eastern European trade repre-
sentatives visited the U.S. last 
year, as against 1,249 in 1964. 
There are 45 Soviet students 
here, and 50 other scholars are 
engaged on research projects. 
The number-of Soviet-bloc sea-
men arriving in American ports 
has risen from 1.300 to 13,000 
since 1964. 
An area in which the K.G.B. 
continues to excel, especially 
in less developed countries, in-
volves "disinformation," the 
practice of misleading people 
with forged documents and the 
planting of distorted informa-
tion in the press. ? 
! For a dozen years, it is said, 
Ithe K.G.B has financed a 
political' weekly in India called 
'Blitz, which disseminates, 
propaganda damiging to the 
United States. 
Another fairly recent change 
in K.G.B. priorities nbted here 
is increased emphasis on China-
watching. It formed a special 
China department about 1970. 
The K.G.B. has a network 
of ."old China hands," and is 
sending young recruits to An-
Yang University in Singapine 
to iearn Chitee,i-, but it, is 
evidently weak on reliable In-

Over the years the Communist Party 
has made littie headway with British 
voters. But today Communists hold 
key posts in zonio of the country's 
most .117erful trade unions, a cause 
for growing c ncern in an economy 
where the uni*ns call the tune.

Just a carrot's throw from the boarded-up remains of 
'Covent Garden's former fruit and vegetable market 
stands a grimy office building, fronted with thick 
t. frosted glass and crumbling stone and marked with a 
barely visible, small brass plate. Inside, light bulbs 
hang unshaded from their wires. The walls of the 
. waiting room are bare and dingy. It is the headquarters 
of the British Communist Party. * 
Despite the seedy anonymity of their King Street 
;? offices, Britiain's Communists are today the focus of an 
unaccustomed glare of public comment and concern. 
Columns about their activities, known and guessed at, 
appear frequently in the national dailies. Politicians of 
various persuasions speak out against the Communist 
threat. And ordinary Britons tend to answer questions 
s about Communist influence with faintly embarrassed 
phrases such as, "I've never been a 'Reds under the 
beds' person myself, but. . . ." 
? The reason does not lie in any sudden electoral 
success. The Communists' parliamentary performance 
'remains as dismal as their headquarters. 
? Rather, the reason lies in the current power struggle 
between Parliament (regardless of which party is in 
r power) and militant trade-union leaders. 
. Ills widely accepted here that some union leaders are 
using vast wage demands and inflation as, blunt 
instruments to push a, virtual economic revolution past 
a feebly protesting Parliament. And since Communist 
power, overt and covert, i3 concentrated in the unions, 
. there are fears here that: 
1. The Communists are actively fomenting industrial 
strife andee,' nion-Pai-liamert cenflict los their own ends. 
. 2. Their allies have infiltrated the Labour Party's 
parliamentary ranks to weaken that party's tradition-
ally strong democratic ideals and to undermine its 
leaders' ability to resist union demands.

if they could, use the present turmoil as a stepping- * 
stone to something nearer real, preferably irreversible-
political revolution. 
'A faithful Moscow satellite' 
All this sounds far out in a country so solidly 
democratic, so skeptical of wordy ideelogies, so firmly 
attached to that curiously British mixture of common 
sense and self-deprecating humor. What are the facts? . 
The British Communist Party, with a membership of 
about 29,000, ranks as one of Moscow's faithful 
' satellites. But there is no solid evidence that Commu-
nist officials in British unions respond to strings pulled 
from Moscow. 
On the visible parliamentary level the Communist 
Party is a complete failure. The party has no seats in 
the House of Commons', nor has it even come near 
? winning any over the past couple of decades. 
? Out of a total vote in last October's general election of 
just over 29 million, the Communists managed to gather 
- in a paltry 17,426 votes. ' 
On the less-visible parliamentary level, however, a 
rather different picture emerges. Some of the Labour 
, Party's "social democrats," who comprise the bulk of 
the party and almost all the present Cabinet, appear as 
? anxious as their Conservative colleagues about the 
motives and loyalties of some extreme left-wingers in 
Labour's ranks. 
? How much influence? 
? ? Lord Chalfont, a former Labour minister who is now 
an independent peer, put the point discreetly to the 
? House of Lords earlier this year: 
`!. . in what I have to say I shall suggest that the 
governing [Labour] Party provides, in one way or 
another, shelter for a number of people who are almost 
certainly committed to undermining the existing 
political system in Britain." 
How much such back-benchers can influence Labour 
Party and government policy is an open question. 
Assessments vary greatly according to the political 
viewpoint of the speaker. But with Prime Minister 
Harold Wilson holding only a very narrow majority in 
.. the Commons, the votes of the extreme leftists in his 
own party can on occasion be of immenseimPortance to 
him. 
On the trade-union level, the Communists have a 
. much more obvious foothold. Indeed they have clearly 
put most of their intellectual and ideological eggs into 
this basket, under the watchful eye of their tireless 
industrial expert Bert Ramelson.

Britain's trade unionists are Communist Party mem-
bers, the party has managed to get itself into a position 
of influence out of all proportion to its numbers. 
' More than 10 percent of union executives now are 
card-carrying members of the Communist Party. Many 
other union officials are active sympathizers or follow 
the Communist Party line. In total, some industrial-
relations specialists reckon, from 30 to 40 percent of 
, union officials are probably Marxist in their outlook. 
- In addition, the Communist Party succeeded last 
September in getting one of its members (Ken Gill) on 
to the general council of the Trade Union Congress 
(TUC), the central body of British unionism. 
Methods, worker apathy blamed 
The outdated operating methods of British trade 
unions, and widespread worker apathy, are most 
usually blamed for this formidable Communist-cum-
leftist foothold in the union movement. 
Postal ballots, for instance, are few and far between. 
'Hence, a well-organized, vigorous minority is often able 
to get its candidates into office because of minuscule 
turnout (sometimes as low as 5 percent or less) or 
occasionally by straightforward manipulation of the 
ballot. 
Of course, it is perfectly legal for anyone to run for 
union office. The current spate of concern arises over 
how elected officials may use or abuse their influence. 
According to one leading trade unionist, the Commu-
nists "never cease working in their cells, magnifying 
every grievance into _major proportions, and struggling 
to get into positions of influence." 
In the words of Lord Shawcross, a former attorney  
general in Clement Attlee's postwar Labour govern-
ment, "There are forces now actively and openly at 
work whose object it is to bring our existing society and : 
estahliahment tn rent I apse" (May is sneer+ tn the Wirlpr 
Share Ownership Council in London). 
Similarly, as Lord Chalfont pointed out in his speech 
to his fellow peers, the Communists use all the leverage 
they can muster to sway the Labour Party. According 
to Lord Chalfont, Mr. Ramelson claimed last year that 
"the Communist Party can float an idea early in the 
? year, and it can become official Labour Party policy by 
the autumn. . . . We have More influence now on the 
.Labour' movement than at any time in the life of our 
? party." 
' - 
Anti-Communists rallied 
The Communists have burrowed their way into the 
union movement in classic fashion ? via the formation 
--of small, highly active, cells. The second most powerful 
union in Britain, the Amalgamated Union of Engineer-
. ing Workers (AUEW), provides a vivid example of the 
party's mode of operation and its results.

Washingtor Post Staff Writer , 
Free Europe has gi- meat, Capt. Tomaz Rosa, said 
million members include only about 2,500 registered 
Communists. Yet of the 52 men on the AUEW's National 
Committee, 16 are card-carrying members of the 
Communist Party, according to Lord Chalfont. About 
half the National Committee are either party members 
or sympathizers. 
Until five years ago the mighty AUEW appeared to be 
slipping inexorably toward total Communist control. 
With union election turnouts sometimes as low as 21/2 
percent, the Communists were able to tuck their men or 
tacit supporters into more and more union offices. "A 
majority of such a small percentage are always 
Communists with chips on their shoulde:'s," explained 
John Boyd, the union's newly elected and fervent anti-_. 
Communist general secretary, in an interview. 
1 
Hence, in 1969 Mr. Boyd rallied the anti-Communists 
and managed by one vote on the National Committee 
(meeting as a rules committee) to switch the union to a' 
postal ballot. The result was a dramatic increase in 
participation, often rising well above 30 percent, and 
the defeat of many Communist candidates. 
However, the Communist's counterattacked last 
month. The National Committee (meeting again as a 
rules committee as it does every five years) narrowly. 
voted to retain the postal ballot. But, taking advantage 
of a mixup in committee members' credentials, the 
leftists managed to reduce this majority to a tie. Union 
president Hugh Scanlon (a former Communist Party 
member) later used his vote on the seven-member 
National Executive to throw the postal ballot out. 
? Such tactics, repeated throughout the union move-
ment, give the Communists and fellow travelers ' 
national scope. "There are very few unions in Britain 
which don't have a Co-nmunist cell," says Mr. Boyd. 
"Fundamentally the Communists look upon their aim 
nrd aject life as being to undermine what they , 
consider is the capitalist society." 
Under normal conditions Britain's mixed economy - 
and open society muddle along sufficiently well to make 
the Communists' real national impact of little impor-
tance. But today's conditions are far from normal. 
Weak governments and successive economic crises 
have undermined the authority of Parliament. Militant 
trade-union leaders have taken advantage of the 
situation, defying attempts at wage control and even 
flouting laws enacted by Parliament. 
If is a moot point how much the Communists are 
responsible for today's highly charged climate of 
anxiety and confrontation. What is certain is that it is an 
ideal atmosphere for them to exploit. 
Their motives and methods, along with those of the 
rest of the extreme left, have therefore become the 
focus of far greater than usual concern. This is 
especially so since - grave economic and political 
challenges still lie-ahead.

Portugal. 
By ARTHUR ScHausINcan an. 
. The hints and whispers and mumbles 
from Washington are that Portugal is 
about to go Communist. that it will consti-
tute a fifth column within NATO, that it 
will give the P.ussians an opening to the 
Atlantic; and oh if the CIA were only alive 
and well in .Lisbon. ? 
? Poltugal going Communist is not a 
happy prospect. It is also a considerable 
exaggeration. The Immediate prospect, if 
- the democratic forces' fail to sustain them-
? selves, is not a Communist takeover. It is 
rather the establishment of a military re-
gime, Nasscrite in its model and 'neutralist 
in its foreign policy, using the Portuguese 
. Communist Party for counsel and support. 
I Such a regime might well deny military 
? bases to the United States, but. there Is no 
? reesen io suppose that, any more than 
Egypt or Peru, it would turn overnight into 
a Soviet satellite. 
' Moreover, if such a regime comes to 
power, it would be against the wishes of 
the Portuguese people as expressed in the 
; recent election?and this is why the pessi-
mism spilling out of Washington is so de-
pressing. President Ford and Secretary 
Kissinger appear to have given up the bat-
. tie for Portugal; the Portuguese people 
have not. In the election, the Socialists 
? took 38% of the vote, the Popular Demo-
: crats, a center party, 26% and the Commu-
!.nists a wretched 12.5%. But, where the 
Communists are giving the dominant 
!Armed Forces Movement unconditional 
support, the Socialists, under the leader-
, 
? ship of Mario Soares, have irritated the 
military by their demands for democratic 
liberties. So, when Communist printers 
shut doWn the respected Socialist newspa-
per Republica, the military, despite mass 
? Socialist protests, decided to go along with 
? the Communists. 
The question now is what the Western 
democracies can do to help the Socialists 
In their struggle to keep Portugal in the 
democratic world. On this question there 
are two divergent approaches: the Ameri-
can strategy and the Western European 
strategy. ? 
? ? Our strategy derives from the fact that 
we (Le., our masters lit Washington) really 
preferred the old regime in Portugal?the 
.rightwing dictatorships of Selazar and 
Caetano. We found it convenient to deal 
with them, and we supposed that Portu-
guese authoritarianism had: unlimited life 
expectancy. Our policies both toward Por-
-tugucse *Africa lint; Portugeil itself were 
based on this supposition. Our intelligence 
Was gravely mistaken. The Portuguese 
army was a good deal less sanguine than 
.we were about the Portuguese capacity to 
hold on to its African colonies, and Portu-
guese generals eventuA

tion against the regime we had so stoutly 
' supported. 
Taken by SurInise? 
When the revolution occurred, we were 
evidently taken by surprise. The Common 
Market countries of Western Europe 
promptly welcomed the emergence of "a 
democratic Portugal." The United States 
maintained a sullen silence for three 
weeks until our ambassador was finally in-
structed to. deliver a god-will alma-age to 
the new government. That was a year ago; 
and since then we have been acting as if 
we thought a Communist Portugal to be in-
evitable. 
Our first ambassador after the revolu-
tion, Stuart Nash Scott, was quickly re-
cailed because he rejected State Depart-
ment defeatism and wanted to work with 
democratic elements in the new. regime. 
His successor, Frank Carlucci, has report-
edly had difficulties because he also sees 
possibilities for positive action. But the 
Secretary of State has taken a sour line al-
most from the start, expressing a concern 
for democratic processes in Portugal that 
he had ably concealed during the Salazar-
Caetano years. In April he told a group of 
West European journalists, according to 
The New York Times, that "he believes 
that by next year Portugal will be a Com-
munist nation or a neutralist nation under 
heavy Communist influence." On May 23 
President Ford himself threatened the 
Portuguese governmeet (in a statement 
that lir. Rissing,er felt obliged to qua/ay 
the next day) with excommunication from 
NATO if it does not shape up and ship out 
Its Communists. 
The argument for this, I imagine, is 
that lectures from such exalted personages 
will shock the Portuguese military into 
good behavior. This notion displays our 
usual gross misunderstanding of the psy-
chology of small revolutionary states. Lit-
tle is better designed to strengthen the 
Board of Contributors 
The Ford administration 
seems determined to con--
sign Portugal to Commu-
nism and thereby assure the 
fulfillment of its own proph-
ecy, 
Alan Hovey, RPE vice 
president, said that "the only 
guarantee we give to any-
body is that we will continue 
to adhere to the internal 
policy 'guidelines which re-
quire us to report the news 
of that area [Eastern Europe] 
and the rest of the world 
objectively, comprehensively 
and accurately." 
Hovey, Durkee and Walter 
all said that there had been 
no change in RFE program-
ming.

hopes that the Ford administration, after 
proving to the world that the United States 
is stronger militarily than Cambodia, will 
not be rendered dizzy with- success and 
I send the Marines on to Portugal. 
The Western European strategy is very 
I different. It deserves a hearing if only be-
cause it is Western Europe after all that 
would be most immediately threatened by 
' untoward developments in Portugal. The 
; delusion that Washiagton, thousands of 
miles away, knows better than the people 
L's the. neighhorhood got us into enough 
teuble in Vietnam. There seems no great 
need to carry it forward into Portugal. . 
The Western European view is that the 
struggle for Portugal is far from over. 
Many West Europeans see the events in 
Lisaasn ;as a zalutary remindsr ea! the- ?:.,,;., 
of detente. The fact that, for diverse good 
reasons, the United States and the Soviet 
Union have a stake in avoiding nuclear 
war does not mean that communism has. 
become a benign and ? ennobling, faith. In-
deed, the big losers in the short run have 
been the Communist parties of Italy and 
France. These parties have recently pres-
ented themselves as national and parlia-
mentary parties which, if trusted with 
porker, would devoutly respect the rules of 
the democratic game. Such claims look a 
little tattered note. The ambition of the 
Italian Communists to join the government 
has been very considerably set back; and, 
while the French Socialist leader Francois 
Mitterand will certainly continue the So-
cialist-Communist electoral coalition, this 
Is only because he feels, perhaps rightly, 
that he is wilier than his Communist allies 
and will use them more than they can use 
Within Portugal the West Europeans re-
ject the American idea of giving up the 
fight and arc trying instead to stay in close 
and to help the Socialists. Two days after 
Mr. Ford's statement, tho Comm-,n Market 
countries agreed to offer Portmeal better 
trading opportunities, financial aid and in-
dustrial cooperation so long as such help 
might encourage the maintenance of </div></div></div>  </div>
