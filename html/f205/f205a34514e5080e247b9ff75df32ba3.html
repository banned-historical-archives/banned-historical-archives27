 (Note:     To distinguish between. the two sets of ques-
 tions, those on, yellow paper have retained
 their original numbers from 1 through 42,
 while those on white paper are numbered Wl
 through W12.   The supplementary questions
 on white paper have been answered first be-
 cause the answers provide a more general
 introduction to the subject.)
 (W1)        Q:   Can you describe the role of the Central
 Intelligence Agency in general terms?
 A:.   The Congress of the United States did that
 in the National Security Act of 1947,  the same act
 which established the Department of Defense and the
 National Security Council.   This legislation also
 created the position of Director of Central Intelli-
 gence, with responsibility for coordination of the
 total foreign intelligence effort of the U.  S. Gov-
 >n effect
 ernment, an.dAmade the DCI the principal foreign
 intelligence adviser to the President and the NSC.
 The prime responsibility of the Central Intelligence
 Agency is to obtain,  produce,  and disseminate intelligence
 essential to our national security.   Specifically,  the
 National Security Act says that the CIA is "...to corre-
 late and evaluate intelligence relating to the
 national security,  and provide for the appropriate
 dissemination of such intelligence within. the Gov-
 ernmen.t..."  The Act assigned five functions to the
 CIA, under the direction of the National Security
 Council. First,  the CIA is responsible for advising
 the NSC---and of course the President--on intelligence

 matters related to national security.   Second,  the
 CIA is responsible for coordinating all foreign
 intelligence activities.   Third,  the Agency isJJre-
 and 015seminaliah                                        wi fbn one Gavernmen
 sponsible for the production Aof finished national
 intelligence.   Fourth and fifth,  the CIA undertakes
 "such services of common concern." as may be deter-
 mined by the   NSC--services,  that is, which are
 useful to all the components of the government's
 intelligence community--an.d is authorized to per-
 form such other functions as the NSC might direct.
 (W2)     Q:   Is this role essentially one of in-
 formation. gathering?  Would a more
 descriptive title be "Cen.tral Infor-
 mation Agency?"
 A: our principal responsibility is to gather,
 specifically,  that information which relates directly
 to national security problems and objectives. The
 United States Information Agency deals with information
 in the broader sense of the term, and distributes it
 outside the government.   It is useful both to their
 operations and to ours to preserve this distinction.
 There is a further point of professional semantics
 involved:  "intelligence," as we use the term,  refers
 to information which has been carefully evaluated as
 to its accuracy and significance.   It is the important
 process of evaluating the accuracy and assessing the
 significance in terms of national security which makes
 the difference in our terminology between "information"
 and "intelligence."       -2-

 other available information on the same subject,
 and analyzed and evaluated by competent experts in.
 that particular field, we call it "finished in.telli-
 gence.'g  When,  in addition.,  it represents the agreed
 conclusions of the entire intelligence community--
 the intelligence components of the Department of
 State, the Department of Defense, and the FBI and
 AEC if it should fall within the purview of those
 agencies--then. it is "n.ational intelligence."   In
 short, we find that we need a terminology which
 can be more precise and more limiting than. the broad
 concept of "information."
 (W3)     Q:     People seem to have the impression that
 yours is a big "spying" organization,
 staffed by spies.   Is that anywhere
 near a correct impression?
 A:  This is,  of course,  the popular view of any
 intelligence organization,  but in reality our job is
 to provide intelligence information to U.  S. Government
 officials on matters affecting the national security so
 that they may know,  in a timely way,  what the real news
 is behind the events which become public around the world.
 A great proportion of this work amounts to bringing
 expert knowledge and scholarly analysis to bear in a way
 which has nothing in common with the heroes of modern
 spy fiction.  Of course, much of the world's area and
 population is controlled by governments operating closed
 societies,  in which they seek to conceal their activities
 and objectives.   Some classical espionage may be required,
 to determine when and how these activities

 and objectives might threaten us.   But to preserve
 We cannot make public any
 the proper perspective:
 a breakdown of how many people are in headquarters
 and in the field, or how many gather information
 and how many analyze it, but
 the man who joins CIA has far less chance,  in the
 course of his career, of identifying with James
 Bond or   The Spy Who Came In From the Cold," than
 he does of identifying with an academic researcher,
 economist, scientist, statistician, administrator,
 accountant, or supply officer.
 (W4)     Q:      Another idea is that the CIA is in the
 business of stirring insurrections or
 starting and maybe running little wars.
 Is that impression justified?
 A:       This,  again,  is a popular misconception.  Our major
 business is the gathering of national intelligence,  and
 so-called covert operations are a relatively minor part

 a glance at today's headlines should make it obvious that
 the leaders of our government expect us to forestall or
 help combat insurrections,  not stir them up.  The gov-
 ernment,  after all,  is organized on a pretty logical
 basis:   Secretary Rusk is in charge of foreign
 policy and foreign relations,  Secretary McNamara,

 CIA has
 and 4..e enough to do coordinating intelligence
 without running any wars.
 (W5)     Q:   Do your information activities cover the
 globe?
 A: Our intelligence responsibilities are world-
 wide.
 (W6)     Q:   Why is information On this scale important
 to the U. S.?   Is it necessary as an-aid
 in shaping policies of this nation with
 its worldwide interests and worldwide
 aid programs?
 A: Factual and unbiased intelligence information
 on activities going on around the world is necessary
 to officials of the U.S. Government on a timely basis,
 so that they may use it as one of the many elements
 which go into the decisions they have to make.   At a
 minimum, we must have certain basic information on
 hand on virtually every country in the world, against
 some sudden need.   Country X -- you name it -- may appear
 remote and totally unrelated to our national security,
 but it is nevertheless impossible to state with certainty
 that detailed information about Country X will not become
 necessary to our government on a crash basis some day.

 (W8)     Q:  Is your role in information-gathering
 different from that of the intelligence
 services of the armed forces?
 A:    Our finished national intelligence derives from
 the work of all of the elements of the intelligence
 community,   which includes the intelligence services
 of the armed forces.   Foreign service officers provide
 the Department of State with political intelligence,
 commercial attaches are responsible for economic infor-
 mation,  the military attaches sent military intelli-
 genceto their respective services,  and for that matter
 there are agricultural attaches and labor attaches. All
 of them provide departmental intelligence for the specific
 needs of specific departments.   The CIA has been added
 to supplement and expand the collection and fill
 any gaps.   It has a broader charter for all types
 of intelligence necessary in. the national interest,

 statutory responsibility to "correlate and evaluate
 in.telligen.ce relating to the national security, and
 provide for... appropriate dissemination."  For
 example, a piece of political intelligence from
 one country, and the army attachd's report from
 another country, may add up to a conclusion. Of
 major significance to the National Security Council,
 or specifically to the AEC.   It is CIA's respon-
 sibility to see to it that the two halves do get
 added up  in  Washington to make the whole, and
 furthermore that the finished evaluation reaches
 the department which needs it.
 (W9)     Q:   Does machinery exist to correlate all
 of the information that flows into
 Washington?
 A:  Yes--formally,  the United States Intelli-
 which is advisory to the
 gen.ce Board, or USIB.   This Board,
 Director of Central Intelligence and under his chairmanship,
 Xk-  ,_1.a   .-ate-i -   -te e-, meets every week, or

 priorities to see to it that there are no gaps in,
 our coverage,  and ensures that the judgments which
 go forward to the President are finished, national

 It should be emphasized,

 specialists in One component are in, constant touch
 and interchange with their opposite numbers in. the
 other departments and agencies, so that the national
 intelligence process begins as soon as the raw in-
 formation. reaches Washington.,  if not before.
 (W10)    Q:      It is really possible to refine down, to
 fixed conclusions the vast amount of
 information that you receive?   Is this
 machinery so geared that quick action
 can, follow when the flow of information
 suggests impending danger or trouble?

 A:  We are geared to receive information, pro-
 duce in.telligen.ce, and react 24 hours a day, seven
 days a week; nobody in. the Agency, from the analysts
 to the Director,  is guaranteed a night's uninter-
 rupted sleep, or an. unbroken. weekend.
 As for reaching firm conclusions,  in. many
 cases this can. be done by the expert analysts avail-
 able, backed up by our storehouse of background
 knowledge.  There will always, of course, be the
 "un.knowables"--questions which have no definitive
 answers, possibly because the future is open to the
 effects of many variables, or because the future
 depends on. decisions which certain foreign. states-
 men. may not even have made yet.  Who will succeed
 Mao Tse-tung?   When., and by whom, will there be a
 successful coup  in  Country X?  Our policy makers
 need and request our best answers on. the "un.kn.ow-

 Estimates.   From what we do know,  the best  thinking
 available in. the entire intelligence community makes
 rational inferences about the un.kn.own -with vary,

 note reflecting an individual dissent from the

 of distinguished senior officers of long experience
 and proven competence in diverse fields of govern-

 (W12)     Q:     To whom does your organization report?
 Are accounts supervised or audited?
 Does anyone in. Congress know of what
 activities you are carrying on.?
 A: That question--or rather,  those questions--
 are a big order and an important one.   Let us
 summarize the answers first, and then expand on them
 in greater detail.   We report our substantive
 intelligence to the National Security Council, pre-
 sided over by the President, and to other components
 of the executive and legislative branches as he may
 direct--cabinet departments,  congressional committees,
 even individual legislators who may have a need for
 briefings.   Discussion of our activities, our methods,
 and our sources,  however,  is another matter,  because
 Public Law 80-253 of 1947(the National Security Act)
 requires the Director of Central Intelligence to
 protect the sources and methods of the entire intel-
 ligence community.                             CIA's operations are authorized

 taries of State and Defense.   The Director is authorized
 and directed to make complete disclosure on the legis-
 lative side to two special subcommittees of the Senate
 and two similar subcommittees in the House.   In addition,
 the President has appointed a most knowledgeable and
 distinguished Board, composed of private citizens, to
 oversee the Central Intelligence Agency and for that
 matter the entire intelligence community,  and to report
 regularly and directly to the President with their views
 on the conduct of the activities of the Central Intel-
 ligence Agency.   Our requests for funds must be justified
 in detail to the Bureau of the Budget and approved in
 detail by special Appropriations subcommittees of House
 and Senate, and our comprehensive auditing procedures
 have to satisfy the standards of those who have approved
 the    budget in the first place.
 Now,  to go into these questions in greater detail:

 The Central Intelligence Agency budget is
 reviewed fully by the Bureau of the Budget, which
 requires the same assurances and justifications for
 expenditures by intelligence agencies that it re-
 quires from any other part of our government.   We
 are not immune from detailed examination of our re-
 quests by the Bureau, nor are we exempt from its
 skillful pruning knife.   We have to go to Congress
 for our funds, just like other agencies.   The only

 and radio,
 is derived from the foreign press/ from technical journals
 of foreign countries,  and from official publications of

 because it is not secret.   Finished intelligence,  however,

 opinionated?
 A:   We require the original report,  or the original
 statement of the primary source, whenever we can get it.
 When this "raw material":.reaches us,  it may be accom-
 panied by the opinions and interpretations of inter-
 mediaries through whom the information has passed, and
 by the informed comment and preliminary evaluation of our
 own collectors in the field,  but these additions are
 clearly labeled as such.

 are faced with a choice among several possible policies.

 A:   The Central Intelligence Agency is charged with
 conducting operations outside the country,  whereas the
 FBI has as its principal mission the internal security
 of the United States and its possessions.   There is,  of
 course,    close cooperation and considerable interplay
 between our organizations because we are combatting an
 international conspiracy whose operations and agents
 move back and forth between this country and foreign

 items of potential interest or concern to each other.

 A:
 You have o take into consideration,
 firstly,
 that the collection of intelligence is not the primary
 responsibility of the Department of State and the Depart-
 ment of Defense, and that the representatives they send
 abroad must operate in the open as recognized officials
 of the US Government.   In effect, we are in a better
 position to obtain the intelligence we need because CIA
 is specifically organized for the clandestine collection
 of intelligence,  and can give it first priority.
 If,  by handicaps,  you mean the obstacles which
 foreign governments place in the way~:of intelligence
 it mast be.
 collection.,                that foreign governments--both

 close to congressional committees informa-
 tion about its activities?
 A:                              The Agency has been under
 legislative oversight since its establishment.
 (22)        Q
 Have the congressional committees which
 have been in contact with CIA expressed
 any dissatisfaction over the years that
 they were not getting enough information?
 A:   We have never withheld any information,  sub-
 stantive or operational,  from the         '"'subcommittees.
 On some occasions,  in fact,  they have asked us not to
 give them the identities of very sensitive sources,
 because they did not wish to know, and we have complied.

 (23)       Q:     Do you find that leakages of information
 have been detrimental to your operation in
 any respect?
 A:   It is one of the first principles of the art that
 when another country learns or suspects that you have ob-
 tained information they were trying to keep secret,  they
 will do everything possible to locate and destroy your
 source, and counter your method of operation.
 (24)        Q:  Do all the major countries operate
 intelligence services?
 A:`'know of no major country that does not. After
 all,  it simply amounts to obtauhing information which you
 need to have.        You might say that football teams and rival
 department stores operate intelligence services,  for
 instance; they just happen to call them scouts or com-
 parison shoppers.
 (25, 26,):Q:         Is there cooperation between the intelligence

 If we collect information that is of vital
 importance to one of our allied countries,
 would it be transmitted to the State Depart-

 cooperation between the intelligence agencies
 of allied governments a factor in the suc-

 wherever it is of mutual interest and advantage,  there is
 substantial cooperation among the intelligence services
 of friendly countries.

 that dishonorable methods are used by the

 earlier this year:
 11 ....... I would emphasize to you that CIA is
 not engaged in activities not known to the senior
 policy officers of the Government.   But you should
 also bear in mind that beneath the    vel of publiinc
 discussion,  there is a tough struggle going
 the back alleys all over the world.   It's a tough
 one, :it's unpleasant, and no one likes it, but that
 is not a field which can be left entirely to the
 other side.     And so once in a while some disagree-
 able things happen,  and I can tell you that there
 is a good deal of gallantry and a high degree of
 competence in those who have to help us deal with
 that part of the struggle for freedom."

 A:  To summarize whata said earlier (particularly
 in reply to W8,  11,  18, and 19) CIA's intelligence re-
 quirements cover anything and everything related to
 national security, intelligence is our primary business,
 and we are specifically geared for the job.   The services
 collect departmental intelligence for departmental   pur-
 poses, their attaches operate under the liability of
 being known,  and they have other missions which take
 priority over the collection of intelligence.

 (39-42)    Q:    To what extent does the CIA operate under
 direct instructions from the President oral
 Secretary of State?  Are there some gene
 instructions given covering a number of ac-
 tivities?  Do you have anything which might
 be called regulations to govern your activi-
 ties?  Are these prescribed by the President
 or Secretary of State or any other Cabinet
 officer? In other words, to what extent do
 you operate under specific instructions in
 certain types of cases?
 A:  To recapitulate, the Central Intelligence Agency
 operates under a charter consisting of the National Se-
 curity Act of 1947 as amended, which provides that we
 function at the behest and under the control of the
 President and the National Security Councils  We are gov-
 erned by several layers of regulations known as the NSCID's
 or National Security Council Directives; the DCID's or
 Director of Central Intelligence Directives, which are
 issued in the name of the Director in his capacity as
 head of the entire intelligence community and chairman of
 the United States Intelligence Board; and, as in the case
 of any other governmental component,  our own Agency
 regulations.
 Our missions are assigned by the President,.:the
 National Security Council or its elements, and USIB.   Our
 activities are approved in advance and controlled by a
 special element of the NSC representing the President,
 the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense.
