 VIETNAM
 The surface-to-air missile sites in North Vietnam are
 now operational.  The two most recently discovered
 sites in the area where a US fighter was shot down
 last week were reported 20 percent destroyed by a US
 strike on 27 July.  Vietnamese Communist propaganda
 continues to sharpen the threat of bringing in foreign
 volunteers but stops short of admitting that some are
 participating in the fighting now.  Viet Cong activity
 remains in a relative lull for the third week.

 announced that foreign embassies
 had agreed to a program of mili-

 announcement singled out Chinese,
 North Korean, Polish, and Indo-
 nesian students and highlighted
 their statements that the program
 would give them an opportunity
 to "fight side by side with the

 Huu Tho claimed in a 20 July

 indicate the presence of possibly
 three Viet Cong regiments within
 24 miles of the US Marine instal-

 suggest possible build-ups of
 Viet'Cong forces near the Hau
 Nghia - Long An Province border
 area in the III Corps zone, and
 in Dinh Tuong Province in the
 IV Corps zone.
 Government-initiated ground
 operations showed little varia-
 tion in number, but for the
 first time since March, the
 weapons loss ratio favored the
 government.   Friendly air sup-
 port continued to account for a
 large percentage of Viet Cong
 casualties, with Vietnamese and
 US fixed-wing aircraft recently
 averaging more than 385 strike
 sorties per day despite uneven
 weather conditions.   Coastal
 bombardment by US Navy warships
 reached a new high during the
 week, and was directed at more
 than 100 targets in all four
 corps zones.   US ground troops
 engaged in little large-scale
 activity, being deployed mainly
 in defensive positions around
 the major bases at Bien Hoa, Da
 Nang, and Chu Lai.   The major
 engagement of the week took
 place on 25 July when US marines,
 in a joint amphibious search-
 and-destroy operation with Viet-
 namese forces, killed 25 Viet
 Cong and captured 33 on a small
 island seven miles north of Chu
 Lai.
 South Vietnamese Politics
 F no open
 opposition to the Saigon regime
 has developed thus far.  Prior
 warnings by both Chief of
 State Thieu and Premier Ky
 against troublemaking were
 formalized in a government de-
 cree issued last week, provid-
 .ing stiff penalties for graft,
 economic profiteering, or
 sympathy for Communism or neu-
 tralism.
 In the central highlands,
 representatives of the tribal
 autonomy movement FULRO have of-
 fered to cooperate with the gov-
 ernment against the Viet Cong
 in return for government sup-
 plies and support and the right
 to fly their own flag.   Formed
 after the September 1964 re-
 volt in five tribal paramilitary
 camps, the FULRO group now is
 reported to be based across the
 border in Cambodia.  Vietnamese
 officials are considering the
 FULRO offer, lest these elements
 turn increasingly to the Viet
 Cong for support.

 SOVIET ECONOMIC STATISTICS FOR MIDYEAR
 According to official fig-
 ures, the Soviet economy is in
 slightly better shape now than
 at midyear 1964.      The improve-
 ment is largely a result of the
 recovery of the food industry,
 in consequence of the exceptional
 harvest of 1964, from its low
 point after the very poor har-
 vest of 1963.
 Investment appears to have
 increased, reversing the down-
 ward trend of the past few years.
 The limited data released, how-
 ever, are not sufficient to de-
 termine whether this increase
 will produce a commensurate rise
 in total investment for the year.
 Growth in output  in the
 major heavy industrial sectors
 either declined somewhat or re-
 mained at the midyear rates of
 1964.     Food and light industrial
 production rose 10 percent as
 compared with only 2 percent last
 year.
 The chemical industry still
 enjoys a reasonably high prior-
 ity, and so far the apparent re-
 duction in some of the long-term
 goals since Khrushchev's ouster
 has had little or no effect on
 production.   The six-month in-
 crease of 14 percent in chemical
 output makes attainment of the
 1965 goal feasible, but commis-
 sioning of some new capacities
 is running behind schedule.
 Growth in the important
 area of fuels and power is on
 schedule as are increases in
 metals and machine-building.   The
 growth planned for machine-,build-
 ing was small and has been slow-
 ing since 1960.
 Brezhnev's new program has
 yet to be greatly felt in agri-
 cultural production.   Growth in
 investment was high but lower
 than in the first half of 1964.
 A record area was sown to wheat,
 but continued poor weather leaves
 the size of the harvest in doubt.
 Record procurements of meat,
 milk,  and eggs reflect both a
 good feed supply from 1964 and
 the increase in procurement
 prices decreed by the new Soviet
 Government.   In spite of the
 priority assigned to agriculture,
 there was no significant change
 in the general supply of agri-
 cultural equipment.
 The construction industry
 continues to be plagued with
 protracted delays in completing
 projects, and shows no improve-
 ment over last year.  The rate
 of growth in housing construc-
 tion was better than in recent
 years, but progress remains in-
 sufficient to meet Soviet needs.
 The semiannual goal for completion
 of housing units fell short of
 fulfillment.
 Consumer welfare in other
 areas has improved since last
 year.   Incomes of state employees
 increased 6 percent and money
 payments to collective farmers
 rose 10 percent.   Retail trade
 turnover grew, but apparently
 not as much as income, result-
 ing in an increase in savings
 deposits substantially higher
 than in recent years.   This sug-
 gests that the purchasing power of
 the population is increasing
 faster than the supply of salable
 goods.

 THE RUMANIAN PARTY CONGRESS
 The Rumanian party congress
 from 19 to 24 July reasserted
 the regime's determination to
 hold to an independent course in
 domestic and bloc affairs, and
 professed solidarity with the
 world Communist movement.  De-
 velopments there also attest to
 the political power of party
 general secretary Ceausescu,
 who emerged from the proceedings
 as the undisputed "first among
 equals," supported by an inner
 group of leaders personally in-
 debted to him.
 The attendance of delega-
 tions from all 13 ruling Com-
 munist parties and from 43 other
 national Communist parties con-
 stituted an implicit endorsement
 of the new Rumanian party pro-
 gram.   Except for statements by
 the Soviet and Chinese delegates,
 the congress successfully skirted
 ideological issues upon which
 some of the foreign delegations
 are in disagreement and focused
 on Rumanian national issues and
 party matters.
 As a result of some of the
 organizational changes approved
 by the congress, the structure
 of the Rumanian party now re-
 sembles Yugoslavia's in certain
 important aspects.   It now has
 an executive committee, composed
 of 15 full and 10 alternate mem-
 bers, which seems designed to
 ensure control by the party
 leadership--particularly in the
 economic sector--between party
 plenums.
 Other structural changes
 enhance the power of Ceausescu,
 who now is party general secre-
 tary as well as chairman of the
 executive committee and of an-
 other newly created body, the
 seven-member permanent presidium.
 The latter group, which replaces
 the old politburo, is expected
 to be the locus of power.   In
 addition, the membership of the
 central committee was increased
 from 110 to 196, and that of the
 party secretariat from 5 to 9.
 By a judicious shuffling of
 personnel and new appointments
 in all of these bodies,
 Ceausescu was able to staff
 them largely with his own sup-
 porters, thus ensuring a stable,
 united leadership.
 Statements from Soviet and
 Chinese representatives at the
 congress indicated that Sino-
 Soviet rivalry continues un-
 abated.
 there is no good evidence that
 Soviet party leader Brezhnev
 and China's Teng Hsiao-ping
 held bilateral talks.   In his
 address to the congress,
 Brezhnev pressed for bloc
 unity on Vietnam, and under-
 scored Moscow's intention to
 continue its "principled"
 contest with Peiping by build-
 ing a record of firm opposition
 to "US imperialism" in Vietnam.
 Teng Hsiao-ping repeated China's
 familiar positions in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute, asserting that
 the Chinese party would continue
 its fight against "modern re-
 visionism" and work toward
 "ideological  urit

 Bulgaria's party first sec-
 retary                     and premier, Todor
 Zhivkov, may lose Soviet back-
 ing unless he can improve his
 country's economic situation
 and reduce intraparty friction
 in the next six months.   Zhiv-
 kov has long based his leader-
 ship on Moscow's support, and
 could not hope to continue as
 top leader without it.
 Zhivkov probably reflected
 his own concern over his con-
 tinued tenure in a recent inter-
 view with Austrian journalists.
 In answer to a question about
 possible leadership changes,
 Zhivkov replied that "at least
 until the February 1966 elec-
 tions, no changes are to be
 expected." The weakness of his
 position was also suggested by
 the presence of Academy of
 Sciences economist Mateev in the
 delegation which Zhivkov led to
 Rumania's 19-24 July party con-
 gress.   Mateev has been publicly
 identified by Zhivkov as an op-
 ponent of the economic experi-
 mentation now being carried out
 in Bulgaria.
 The Bulgarian economy could
 hardly show much improvement in
 six months.   As for the polit-
 ical friction, Zhivkov has
 never succeeded in consolidating
 his position within the party
 since the eighth party congress
 in 1962, and has remained in
 his post only because he has
 successfully gone to the central
 committee when outvoted in the
 politburo.
 While dark horses cannot
 be ruled out, leading candi-
 dates to replace Zhivkov in-
 clude party secretary Mitko
 Grigorov for party first sec-
 retary, and state President
 Georgi Traykov or politburo
 member Zhivko Zhivkov for pre-
 mier.   Another possibility for
 party first secretary, Boris
 Velchev, may be unavailable be-
 cause of a serious illness.

 After long debate, the Yu-
 goslav Government announced on
 23 July a series of reform meas-
 ures  affecting foreign trade
 and the structure of domestic
 prices.  These reforms should
 have a favorable long-run effect
 on the economy, but initially
 will cause severe difficulties
 for certain industries and pop-
 ulation groups.
 Effective 26 July 1965, the
 Yugoslav dinar was devalued from
 750 to 1,250 to the US dollar.
 This will increase both the
 costs in dinars for imports and
 proceeds in dinars from exports,
 even though the increases will
 be partially offset by cuts in
 import tariffs and export sub-
 sidies.   This move, which has
 been under consideration for a
 year,  is intended to reduce the
 country's growing foreign trade
 deficit and allow some reduction
 in foreign trade controls.
 On 1 January 1966, a new
 currency will be introduced at
 the rate of one new dinar to
 100 old dinars.   The rate of
 exchange will then be 12.5 dinars
 per US dollar,- unless Yugoslav
 authorities meanwhile decide
 that further devaluation is re-
 quired by price increases.
 The government also plans
 large increases in the prices
 of certain products which have
 hitherto been kept abnormally
 low.   This will allow reduction
 of extensive government sub-
 sidies of certain industries and
 together with the devaluation,
 will bring Yugoslav prices more
 in line with world market prices.
 Prices are to double or triple
 for major raw materials, and
 are to rise 20-40 percent for cer-
 tain unspecified processed materials,
 electric power, and basic agricul-
 tural products.   Local authorities
 are to supervise a substantial
 increase in retail prices of
 foodstuffs.   Price controls,
 which were extended to cover most
 of the economy last March, will
 be lifted for retail prices of
 industrial consumer goods.   Such
 prices will in general be allowed
 to fluctuate freely in the next
 few months.
 Although the government has
 recommended that enterprises in-
 crease workers' salaries by up
 to 25 percent, not all,will be
 able to comply.   As a result,
 the minimum 20-percent rise in
 the cost of living expected by
 the government will cause hard-
 ship for many families.
 Yugoslavia has sought fi-
 nancial assistance from various
 foreign sources for the reform
 program.  The International
 Monetary Fund has agreed to-pro-
 vide a credit of $80 million,
 and the USSR has rescheduled
 payment on an old credit to
 Yugoslavia.   Negotiations are
 continuing with the US and
 several West European countries
 for new credits, postponement of
 heavy debt payments coming due
 in the next few years, and
 other means of assistance.

 North Korea appears to be
 joining the growing group of
 Communist countries which rec-
 ognize that true national in-
 dependence can be achieved only
 if they avoid leaning too far
 to either side in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute.
 In the early stages of the
 dispute, Pyongyang pursued a
 policy of neutrality.   In late
 1962, however, recoiling from
 Khrushchev's heavy-handed pres-
 sure, the North Koreans began
 stressing national self-suf-
 ficiency but also supporting
 some of Peiping's anti-Soviet
 words and actions.
 Indications of a shift in
 this attitude appeared after the
 replacement of Khrushchev last
 fall.   Like all the other Com-
 munist regimes--including the
 Chinese--North Korea adopted a
 wait-and-see attitude toward the
 new Soviet leaders.   Unlike
 China and Albania, which soon
 returned to the attack, Pyong-
 yang has apparently found
 enough change in the Soviet at-
 titude to warrant a new look
 at its own relations with Mos-
 cow.
 not reiterated positions they
 held before Khrushchev's re-
 placement, although develop-
 ments since then have given
 them opportunities to echo the
 Chinese line.   For example,
 they allowed the Soviet-spon-
 sored meeting of Communist par-
 ties on 1 March to pass with-
 out comment, in contrast to
 their violent condemnation last
 summer of Khrushchev's plans to
 hold such a meeting.   They did
 not challenge Moscow's right to
 participate in the abortive Af-
 ro-Asian Conference despite the
 adamant stand taken by Peiping
 on this question.
 Another indication of North
 Korea's change of attitude was
 its treatment of the anniversary
 celebrations of its "friendship"
 treaties with the USSR and China.
 The Soviet ambassador's banquet
 for the occasion, which the Ko-
 reans boycotted in 1964, was at-
 tended this year by three polit-
 buro members whereas only two
 such officials--one less than
 in 1964--went to the dinner at
 the Chinese Embassy.   Moreover,
 the Koreans' anniversary speeches
 did not, as last year, cite re-
 visionism as the "main danger"
 to the socialist camp.
 In evidence of their new
 policy, the North Koreans have

 North Korean chief of staff had
 concluded an agreement in Mos-

 in April, Premier Kim Il-sung

 A four-week lull in Indo-
 nesian confrontation activities
 against both peninsular Malaysia
 and Malaysian Borneo has followed
 the flurry of infiltration ef-
 forts timed to coincide with the
 aborted Afro-Asian Conference.
 All Indonesian military forces
 near Malaysia have nevertheless
 remained under a high state of
 alert since 19 June.
 Preparations for future op-
 erations against Malaysia are
 continuing, and periods of more
 intense infiltration activity"
 can be expected.
 A large Indonesian military
 build-up around the periphery of
 Malaysia is now in its last
 stage.
 Although
 this build-up has improved Indo-
 nesia's capability for large-
 scale offensive action against
 Malaysia, open warfare war is
 unlikely in the near future.
 The troops involved in the
 build-up have generally been de-
 ployed in defensive positions.
 The National Assembly elec-
 tions held in Laos on 18 July
 apparently failed to produce a
 clearcut majority for any of
 the participating non-Communist
 factions.   Perhaps the strongest
 single grouping, according to
 as yet unofficial returns, will
 comprise a number of deputies
 associated with the young and
 moderate minister of finance,
 Sisouk na Champassak.   Although
 this group might press for more
 active assembly participation
 in governmental affairs, Sisouk
 has indicated that for the pres-
 ent he will avoid agitating for
 any sweeping policy changes.
 Premier Souvanna, who re-
 turned-to Vientiane this week
 from a stay in Europe, will
 probably propose some minor
 cabinet changes to the King
 soon.   It appears likely, how-
 ever, that the key figures will
 be carried over and that he
 will try to retain at least
 the facade of tripartite rep-
 resentation.
 Meanhwile, there has been
 a step-up in military activity,
 as rightist forces attempt to
 exert pressure on Pathet Lao
 positions.   In the north, Gen-
 eral Vang Pao's guerrilla units
 have joined with regular right-
 ist battalions in an effort to
 recapture territory between Ban
 Ban and Samneua which was lost
 to the Pathet Lao last winter.

 DOMESTIC PRESSURES FOR RHODESIAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 Rhodesian Prime Minister
 Ian Smith is coming under con-
 siderable pressure from a strong
 faction within his Rhodesia
 Front party which is impatient
 with his policy of seeking a
 negotiated independence. from
 the UK.   These rightist pres-

 party congress   in   early August.
 While Smith seems strong enough
 to withstand them, he is con-

 with the other white redoubts
 of southern Africa--the Re-
 public of South Africa and the
 Portuguese territories of
 Mozambique and Angola--in case
 a unilateral declaration of
 independence (UDI) becomes

 TSHOMBE AND KASAVUBU MARK TIME IN CONGO FEUD
 Premier Tshombd and Presi-
 dent Kasavubu apparently are
 marking time in their running
 feud for political dominance in
 the Congo.   New moves may come
 after election of parliamentary
 deputies next week in three prov-
 inces where the results of ear-
 lier balloting were annulled as
 fraudulent.   The voting will be
 held under the supervision of
 Interior Minister Nendaka, whose
 appointment by Kasavubu in mid-
 July was an especially bitter
 pill for Tshombe to swallow.
 After these elections, the
 two leaders are likely to tangle
 over the formation of a new gov-
 ernment.   Kasavubu probably will
 again name Tshombd premier.
 Tshombd, for his part, appears
 willing to accept an occasional
 humiliation in the hope that by
 hanging on to the premiership
 and its prerogatives he will be
 in a strong position to chal-
 lenge Kasavubu in presidential
 elections expected later this
 year.
 At the same time, Tshombd
 is talking of resigning and is
 floating rumors that he might
 return to Katanga.   He probably
 hopes to frighten the President,
 and his supporters by suggest-
 ing that their alternative to
 working with Tshombe in Leo-
 poldville is a new secessionist
 movement.
 In the campaign against
 rebel holdouts in the eastern
 Congo, the government's over-
 all position continues to im-
 prove.   Government units are
 rapidly clearing the vast re-
 gion between Kindu, Stanley-
 ville, and Bukavu.   In the
 northeast, small rebel bands
 continue to harass mercenary
 units but the government still
 holds all major towns and is
 restoring some of the area's
 economy.   On the periphery of
 the Fizi area west of Lake
 Tanganyika, government forces
 have again successfully con-
 tained insurgent efforts to
 expand their control.

 The Greek Cypriots appear
 to have launched a concerted
 campaign to abrade the political
 position of the Turkish Cypriots.
 The Makarios regime re-
 cently passed two legislative
 measures which have drawn strong
 protests from both the Turkish
 Cypriots and the Turkish Govern-
 ment in Ankara.   One of these
 measures extended the life of
 the present purely Greek Cypriot
 government for up to 12 months.
 The second amended the electoral
 law to establish a common elec-
 toral list, thereby eliminating
 the special minority safeguards
 given  the Turkish Cypriots under
 the constitution.   Ankara has
 warned President Makarios that he
 is "stretching the patience" of
 the Turkish Cypriot community
 and that the Turkish Government
 reserves the right to take "all
 necessary measures."
 London and Athens have also
 protested the new laws.   Greek
 Foreign Minister Melas told the
 British he had sent a sharp warn-
 ing to Makarios to the effect that
 the Greek Government was against
 this type of brinkmanship and
 would be unable to support him in
 the new electoral procedures pro-
 posed.   In fact the political cri-
 sis in Athens may impede an  strong
 Greek stand for some time.

 EEC STALEMATE THREATENS KENNEDY ROUND TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
 Anxiety is growing over
 the Kennedy Round of tariff
 negotiations as the crisis in
 the European Economic Community
 drags on.   Next to the US, the
 EEC is the most important of
 the negotiating parties, and,
 unless it is able to enter into
 effective bargaining, the out-
 look for any sizable reduction
 in tariffs is cloudy indeed.
 Moreover, if present deadlines
 in the tight negotiating sched-
 ule slip by, the US Trade Expan-
 sion Act may have expired--in
 July 1967--before the negotia-
 tions can be concluded.
 There has been no real
 loss of momentum since the EEC
 crisis erupted on 30 June be-
 cause no major new decisions
 outside the EEC negotiators'
 existing mandates have been re-
 quired.   A crucial test will
 come on 16 September, however,
 when additional offers of re-
 ductions in agricultural pro-
 tection are scheduled to be
 tabled. Failure to proceed
 with meaningful negotiations
 on agriculture at that time
 would destroy the balance of
 progress in both industrial and
 agricultural sectors which has
 been a principal hypothesis of
 the talks from the beginning.
 Most observers believe the
 EEC will be unable to meet this
 date.   The consensus which ap-
 parently emerged from the 26-27
 July meeting of the EEC Council
 was that a special Council ses-
 sion--now set for October--would
 be necessary to work out a
 community position.
 Faced with the prospect of
 an EEC default,  the other nego-
 tiating parties must decide
 whether tabling their own offers
 will induce the EEC to "catch
 up" or merely undercut their
 bargaining position.   The US
 delegation believes that, if
 other major participants also
 fail to meet the agricultural
 deadline, further pressure will
 be generated to cease meaningful
 industrial negotiations as well.
 The requirements of the
 Kennedy Round schedule are
 likely in fact to have consider-
 able impact on the outcome of
 the EEC crisis.   Germany,  Italy,
 and         the Benelux states, with a
 heavy stake in an expanding
 world market for industrial prod-
 ucts,  may feel increasingly
 desperate to satisfy the--as yet
 unspecified--French demands so
 the community will be able to
 make the decisions the Kennedy
 Round requires.
 Paris, however, is also
 under some domestic pressure
 not to let the Kennedy Round
 run out of steam.   French inter-
 est in the world-wide agreement
 on grains cannot be satisfied
 in the foreseeable future out-
 side the Kennedy Round context,
 and some government circles seem
 also concerned lest other French
 commercial interests suffer from
 a prolonged Kennedy Round
 stalemate.
 Finally, both sides in the
 EEC must take into consideration
 that,  if the EEC deadlock per-
 sists into next year, Kennedy
 Round issues can then be decided
 by majority vote.

 NONALIGNED DOMINICAN GROUPS PRESS FOR EARLY SETTLEMENT
 Influential groups not com-
 mitted to either side in the Do-
 minican stalemate are demanding
 that the Caamano and Imbert fac-
 tions reach a settlement.   The
 country's largest labor union
 has joined businessmen from Santo
 Domingo and the interior city of
 Santiago in urging a quick agree-
 ment.   The second largest labor
 union, which has backed the reb-
 els, pledged support for the OAS
 formula and the proposed provi-
 sional government.   These groups
 have been spurred to action in
 part by continued economic stag-
 nation, widespread unemployment,
 and disruption of normal commer-
 cial activities.
 Despite pressure from these
 groups, only minor progress was
 made in negotiations during the
 past week.   The rebels tenta-
 tively agreed to a revised in-
 stitutional act that will guide
 the new government.   No solution
 has been found, however, for such
 major problems as the future of
 the rebel military, disarmament
 of civilians, control of extrem-
 ists,and the length of stay of
 the Inter-American Peace Force.
 Indeed, the OAS formula received
 a temporary setback when Eduardo
 Read Barreras declined to serve
 as vice president in a provi-
 sional government.   Read feels
 the interim regime faces a bit-
 ter future and is concerned that
 it will not be able to disarm
 the rebels and control the armed
 forces.
 Leaders of the antirebel
 armed forces now are supporting
 the OAS formula for a provisional
 government and have displayed
 a somewhat flexible attitude in
 negotiations with the OAS.-
 The military, through its
 moderate position, is probably
 trying to improve its image and
 head off demands for military
 reform.   The leading officers,
 however, show no signs of per-
 mitting the rebels any influence
 in the military and continue to
 demand the disbanding of rebel
 paramilitary units.
 Non-Communists in the rebel
 camp seem to be splitting over
 the type of settlement to demand.
 Juan Bosch, titular leader of
 the Dominican Revolutionary Party
 (PRD), favors a quick settlement
 and has even proposed that the
 rebel congress formally recognize
 Garcia Godoy as president.   The
 PRD leadership in Santo Domingo
 advised against this, however,
 arguing that it would further
 antagonize those rebels who ac-
 cepted Garcia Godoy only with
 reluctance.   Moderates. in the
 PRD, moreover, seem resentful

 RECENT SOVIET MILITARY SHIPMENTS TO CUBA
 The first significant de-    (parts, ammunition, and possibly
 livery of Soviet military equip-
 ment to Cuba this year appears
 to have been completed.   In the
 past month, three Soviet freight-
 ers, the Transbalt, the F. Z.
 Kuryi, and the  ratstvo arfir ved
 n Cuba with possible military
 cargoes.  Observations made at
 Mariel naval base indicated that
 military equipment had been off-
 loaded there, and preparations
 for what appeared to be the ar-
 rival of military equipment were
 observed at Bahia Honda.
 The arrival of as many as
 three Soviet military shipments
 in a comparatively short space
 of time appears to have no spe-
 cial significance, although it
 is unusual.   The only other
 known military delivery this
 year was a relatively modest one
 made by the Metallurg Anosov
 on 11 June.   It probably con-
 sisted
 two cruise missiles.   It is pos-
 sible that other small deliveries
 of equipment for the Ministry of
 Defense may have arrived unde-
 tected along with commercial
 cargoes.
 Soviet deliveries of mili-
 tary equipment since October
 1962 appear designed chiefly to
 maintain rather than increase
 the level of arms in Cuba.   Fur-
 ther delivery of replacement
 equipment necessary to maintain
 the existing surface-to-air mis-
 sile sites in Cuba may begin in
 the near future since much of
 the solid-propellant fuel and
 many booster engines for the Cu-
 ban missiles are believed to be
 reaching the limit of service-
 ability.

 In a major speech on 26
 July, Fidel Castro was mainly
 preoccupied with Cuban domestic
 affairs, a theme which has in-
 creasingly replaced his clarion
 calls for revolution elsewhere
 in Latin America.   Castro, speak-
 ing for three hours on the 12th
 anniversary of the start of his
 revolution, concentrated on in-
 ternal political and adminis-
 trative matters and only briefly
 berated "enemies" of his regime.
 Castro spoke extensively on
 the PURS (United Party of the
 Socialist Revolution), explaining
 the enhanced role this single
 Cuban party will play in local
 affairs and lecturing on its
 ideology.   He pointed out that
 it will not merely imitate for-
 eign examples, but will be based
 on the "spirit and peculiarities"
 of Cuba.   The FURS, with a mem-
 bership of about 45,000, has
 grown gradually in the past two
 years and has reflected Fidel's
 increased willingness to insti-
 tutionalize the revolution.
 Castro also announced a new
 system of administration to re-
 place the coordinating boards
 (JUCEI) which have been the
 principal organs of local au-
 thority since late 1960.   The
 new system will be more respon-
 sible to the PURS, and will re-
 flect the increased decentrali-
 zation which Castro called
 for.
 The anniversary speech on
 political restructuring at
 least temporarily moves the
 focus away from the economic
 matters which have interested
 Castro since last summer.
 With the economy now  started
 on an upturn, he may devote
 more time to internal political
 problems.   He suggested in
 his speech that a socialist
 constitution may be ready
 within a year, and the organi-
 zation of the PURS will prob-
 ably be completed by that
 time.  A definition of the
 powers and structure of the
 PURS national directorate
 may also be in the offing.
 By attempting to strengthen
 the economy and internal admin-
 istration, Castro apparently
 is trying to make Cuba a show-
 case for revolution.   In his
 speech he urged Latin American
 revolutionaries to follow
 Cuba's example, but said that
 Cuba's first duty is to de-
 velop itself ideologically
 and economically.   Castro,
 however, in turning the con-
 centration of his revolution
 upon itself, has probably
 not altered his belief in the
 "inevitability of the revolu-
 tionary struggle."  In fact,
 he added Peru to the list of
 Latin American countries--
 Guatemala, Venezuela, and
 Colombia--which he considers
 the best targets for revolu-

 The regime of General Lopez
 in Honduras appears to be failing
 in its efforts at creating a sem-
 blance of national conciliation
 following the reinstitution of
 constitutional rule last month.
 The unexpected resignation of
 Foreign Minister Jose Angel U1-
 loa on 16 July leaves only one
 member of the majority Liberal
 Party in a cabinet dominated by
 the minority Nationalist Party.
 Speculation in Tegucigalpa
 suggests that Ulloa resigned be-
 cause many well-qualified Lib-
 erals had been dismissed from gov-
 ernment jobs.   His lack of a free
 hand in selecting ambassadors
 and subordinates in the ministry
 undoubtedly played a role also.
 The remaining Liberal--Labor Min-
 ister  Amado Nunez--may resign
 shortly.
 SF, CRET
 The
 new foreign minister,
 Tiburcio
 Carias
 Castillo, is a
 brother of the
 leader of the
 Popular Progressive Party  (PPP)
 --an offshoot of the ruling Na-
 tionalist
 Party.   Carias' ap-
 pointment
 should help bring the
 dissident
 PPP back into the Na-
 tionalist
 fold,  thereby
 broad-
 ening the
 government's
 politi-
 cal base
 and furthering
 Lopez'
 goal.
 Unlikely to be a strong
 cabinet member, Carias has
 served several times as dele-
 gate to the United Nations Gen-
 eral Assembly and as ambas-
 sador to Great Britain.   Hon-
 duran foreign policy is ex-
 pected to continue its Western
 orientation.

 World-wide
 MEETING OF EIGHTEEN-NATION DISARMAMENT COMMITTEE BEGINS
 The Eighteen-Nation Disarm-
 ament   Committee (ENDC) resumed
 sessions this week, but prospects
 for productive discussions are
 dim because of differences among
 the Western Allies over the terms
 of an agreement on nonprolifera-
 tion of nuclear weapons and ap-
 parent Soviet intentions to use
 the forum merely to attack US
 policy in Vietnam.
 At the NATO Council meeting
 on 26 July, both the British and
 Canadians offered drafts of a
 nonproliferation agreement, with
 the UK's in particular provoking
 the expected reservations from
 West Germany and Italy.   Both
 countries objected to language
 which might impede the subse-
 quent organization of a NATO
 nuclear force and both wanted
 treaty guarantees to nonnuclear
 states.
 In light of these objec-
 tions,  the British agreed not to
 table any proposals in the ENDC
 until there had been "sufficient"
 Allied consultation.   They have
 since proposed alternative lan-
 guage, but the US delegation
 doubts that it will prove any
 more acceptable than the earlier
 version.   If the present dif-
 ferences continue, London may
 feel obliged by domestic polit-
 ical considerations to go ahead.
 The Canadian draft differs
 from the British primarily in
 providing for a collective se-
 curity guarantee by nuclear
 powers to nonnuclear states in
 case of nuclear attack--as India
 and other nonaligned nations
 -proposed during the recent UN
 Disarmament Commission talks.
 Italy favors this and also
 favors inserting a clause which
 would allow any signatory to
 withdraw from the treaty should
 a multilateral nuclear force or
 a new nuclear state emerge.
 Such a provision, Rome probably
 believes, would help overcome
 Soviet difficulties with a NATO
 nuclear force.   However, the
 Soviet delegate, when queried,
 dismissed the idea as "useless."
 France, which is a member
 of the ENDC but refuses to at-
 tend because it claims the Com-
 mittee is too unwieldy  to nego-
 tiate complex disarmament is-
 sues,  has shown considerable
 interest in ENDC proceedings.
 French officials admit that
 they consider disarmament of
 great importance despite Paris'
 "empty chair" policy.   They
 probably also realize that this
 policy is inconsistent with the
 role De Gaulle wishes to play
 with the nonaligned nations.
 Another reason for this
 interest may be France's own
 strong opposition to the MLF.
 A French official has claimed
 that the Soviets severely rep-
 rimanded the French for re-
 fusing to take part in the dis-
 cussions, probably because the
 Soviets would like more support
 in their attack on the MLF.
 The French claim that Soviet
 opposition to the MLF is not a
 tactic but a reflection of gen-
 uine mistrust and fear of Ger-
 many,
