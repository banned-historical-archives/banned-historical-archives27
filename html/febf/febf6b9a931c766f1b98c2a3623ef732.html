 Views of Chinese Military
 and Civilian Analysts on the
 Strategic Defense Initiative
 Senior Chinese leaders have not yet decided how best to deal with the
 challenges of the US SDI program. To date, official Chinese pronounce-
 ments have been generally confined to deliberately vague statements
 opposing the extension of the arms race to outer space. Chinese leaders
 apparently believe they have time to work out a policy because both the
 United States and the Soviet Union are in the initial stages of research.
 The SDI issue, including its implications for Sino-Soviet relations and the
 Western Alliance, is under active study in Chinese military and civilian
 think tanks.
 This paper is a summary of a much longer study prepared for the China
 Division of the Office of East Asian Analysis. It is based on conversations
 in fall 1985 with Chinese military and civilian strategic thinkers and
 analysts. The views of these officials may not coincide with those of
 China's top decisionmakers in every instance. We believe, however, that
 they accurately reflect both the range of thinking on SDI in China and the
 advice reaching top leaders on this issue.
 This paper presents only the views and analysis of Chinese nationals.        25X1
 25X1
 The majority view of Chinese analysts is           25X1
 presented throughout. As in any country-and China is no exception-
 there are differences on this and any other issue. We have attempted to in-
 clude these alternative viewpoints where we believe them to be most
 important.

 Views of Chinese Military
 and Civilian Analysts on the
 Strategic Defense Initiative
 Key Judgments Chinese strategic thinkers are concerned that SDI will significantly alter
 Information available the global strategic situation in the 1990s and thereby damage China's
 as of 10 December 1985 security interests. They believe the rough parity that now exists between
 was used in this report.
 the United States and the Soviet Union is the best guarantee of the stable
 international environment China needs to complete its economic and
 military modernization programs. The Chinese believe this parity also
 affords Beijing maximum leverage in the Sino-Soviet-US triangle.
 Government ministries and research institutes are interested in SDI, but
 the statements of Chinese officials on SDI indicate that they have limited
 knowledge of the strategic thinking behind it. Chinese analysts tend to view
 SDI primarily in political terms-that is, in terms of its impact on US-
 Soviet political relations. They question US sincerity about seeking a way
 to eliminate nuclear weapons and believe that Washington really wants to
 increase its military leverage over Moscow to achieve political goals.
 Chinese military and civilian analysts are well aware that the Soviet Union
 is working on its own SDI program, and they stress that Moscow's goal in
 opposing SDI is not to prevent the deployment of space-based weapons, but
 to delay the US effort until the Soviet Union is in a better position to com-
 pete. Some Chinese analysts worry that Moscow may calculate that it has
 more to lose by allowing the United States to deploy a system, and may
 elect to use force against the United States or a US system before it is de-
 ployed. China's military and Soviet experts are more inclined to hold this
 view; its US experts tend to play down the possibility.
 A number of Chinese analysts believe SDI will exacerbate tensions within
 NATO. They believe the decision to participate in SDI research will be a
 politically difficult one, with European governments facing a Hobbesian
 choice of an angry electorate if they elect to participate or the risk of
 falling further behind US technology if they elect not to. They are also con-
 cerned that SDI will reduce the US defense commitment to Europe.
 Chinese analysts believe SDI has had a positive effect on the arms control
 talks by forcing the Soviets back to the table. They see little chance of an
 accord in the near term but do not rule out a limited agreement in the fu-
 ture. Analysts are concerned, however, that the US refusal to put SDI on
 the table gives the Soviet Union a propaganda advantage. They believe
 Washington has a twofold task at Geneva: to convince Moscow that the

 United States is determined to deploy SDI so that Moscow will be forced to
 make some compromises, and to put forth a realistic counterproposal to
 blunt Moscow's propaganda edge. Analysts generally believe an arms
 accord would benefit China by reducing international tensions, but many
 harbor suspicions that Washington and Moscow might agree on terms
 harmful to China's security interests.
 Of greater concern is the fear that the Soviets will deploy an SDI system
 that will neutralize China's small nuclear deterrent. Chinese analysts do
 not believe this will happen soon, however, and expect they have 20 to 30
 years to develop countermeasures. A more immediate concern is the fear
 that China will be left out of the technological bonanza they see flowing
 from SDI research, and some analysts have hinted at possible participation
 in the EUREKA (European Research Coordinating Agency) project.
 Chinese analysts believe Soviet preoccupation with stopping SDI provides
 the Soviets additional incentives to improve ties to Beijing. Unstated by the
 analysts is what we presume to be a Chinese belief that heightened concern
 in Washington about Sino-Soviet relations increases China's room for
 maneuver in the triangle. Chinese analysts are concerned about appearing
 to side too closely with Moscow on SDI, but they stress that Beijing will
 not hesitate to criticize the United States if China concludes that the
 Soviet Union is seriously seeking an agreement and that US "intransi-
 gence"on SDI is the principal obstacle.

 Views of Chinese Military

 Strategic Defense Initiative
 Chinese Views on the Strategic Situation and SDI
 China's key goals for the rest of the century-
 economic and military modernization-require a
 stable, however tense, international environment. Al-
 though concerned about the conflicts in Cambodia
 and Afghanistan, the massive Soviet military presence
 in Mongolia and the Soviet Far East, and the arms
 race, China sees the present international strategic
 environment as generally conducive to its goals. In
 viewing the international scene, Chinese civilian and
 military leaders-according to their own state-
 ments-take comfort in the belief that:
 ? A Soviet attack on China is very unlikely, although
 the Soviet Union will continue to pose the primary
 threat to Chinese security. China's independent
 foreign policy as well as the US military buildup
 will counterbalance Soviet power and prove a strong
 incentive for Moscow to refrain from hostile behav-
 ior toward Beijing and to seek improvement in Sino-
 Soviet relations.
 ? The rough parity in the US-Soviet military balance
 will be maintained over the next five years and
 beyond, if there is no deployment of advanced
 strategic defense systems. The United States, how-
 ever, will retain an edge over the Soviet Union in the
 global balance of power because the US lead in
 technology will increase slightly.
 ? US-Soviet relations will remain tense but not con-
 frontational, and China will continue to enjoy better
 relations with both than either enjoys with the
 other. The Soviet Union will continue to be tactical-
 ly on the defensive-preoccupied with problems of
 economic and technological development and with
 the US military challenge.
 ? It is unlikely that there will be a war in Korea or
 that any other major conflict will erupt in Asia. The
 conflicts in Cambodia and Afghanistan will remain
 stalemated and will not escalate.
 ? The world economic situation will favor China's
 achievement of its national development goals de-
 spite continuing protectionist sentiments in the
 United States and elsewhere.
 Chinese military and civilian analysts are concerned,
 however, that SDI will drastically alter this favorable
 strategic situation and adversely affect China's inter-
 ests into the next century by disrupting the rough
 parity between the United States and the Soviet
 Union. The disruption of parity, the Chinese main-
 tain, would lead to strategic instability and create an
 incentive for one side to launch a nuclear attack
 against the other. Deployment of strategic defense
 systems or other ballistic missile defenses (BMD) '
 could give one side what it is incapable of achieving
 otherwise-a first-strike capability.
 Chinese Views on US Motivations
 and Goals in Pursuing SDI
 Nearly all Chinese analysts doubt that the United
 States is genuinely seeking a means of eliminating
 nuclear weapons and question the sincerity of the
 President's stated desire to share strategic defense
 technology with the Soviet Union. Rather, they view
 the SDI program as part of a political, economic, and
 military strategy aimed at enhancing the US position
 vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in the global balance of
 power. The Chinese also believe the SDI program is
 intended to revitalize the US and other Western
 economies by stimulating rapid development of US
 military industry and by accelerating the pace of
 technological and industrial development. A faster
 ' In this paper, the term "space-based BMD systems" is used to
 refer to strategic defense systems with the general characteristics
 that have been envisioned in the SDI program. This system is
 multitiered: it includes ground-based interceptors to destroy war-
 heads during the midcourse and reentry phases, as well as space-
 based lasers, particle beams, or kinetic energy weapons for attack-
 ing missiles and warheads in their boost, postboost, and midcourse
 phases.

 rate of economic growth, they claim, will widen the
 US scientific, technological, and economic lead over
 the Soviets; advance military programs at home; and
 increase US prestige abroad.
 Some Chinese analysts maintain that the US motives
 are primarily "offensive"-a desire to achieve global
 hegemony-but others see US actions as primarily
 "defensive." Proponents of this latter view point to the
 Soviet military buildup in the 1970s and the increas-
 ing vulnerability of US ICBMs. They imply that the
 United States has no recourse other than to develop a
 strategic defense system, because, if the Soviet Union
 deploys a space-based BMD first, it will provide
 Moscow with a first-strike capability and an incentive
 to start a war.
 None of the Chinese who see Washington as seeking
 superiority, however, suggest that the United States
 would use a first-strike capability to attack the Soviet
 Union. Rather, they maintain that the United States
 wants increased military leverage over Moscow for
 political goals, such as gaining concessions in the arms
 control talks and obtaining restraints on Soviet mili-
 tary actions. Some analysts also claim that the United
 States is attempting to exploit Soviet economic diffi-
 culties and ultimately to "exhaust" the Soviet Union.
 They maintain that Washington wants to compel
 Moscow to match US SDI efforts in the belief that
 Moscow will be so pressed economically that modern-
 ization of its offensive forces will be disrupted and its
 land-based ICBMs will be rendered obsolete.
 A few other knowledgeable Chinese analysts who
 have spent considerable time in the United States
 maintain that development of strategic defense sys-
 tems by the Soviet Union and the United States is
 simply the natural evolution of nuclear strategy and
 military technology. In current US nuclear strategy,
 they say, deterrence is based not only on mutual
 assured destruction but also on planning to fight a
 nuclear war, including a limited nuclear conflict, if
 deterrence fails. Such a limited war strategy requires
 defense as well as offense, they assert. Only by
 making full preparations for fighting a nuclear war
 can the United States have a reliable deterrent,
 "stand firm" against the Soviet Union, and defend its
 territory and that of its allies in case of nuclear war.
 Chinese Views on Soviet Objectives in Opposing SDI
 Chinese experts on the Soviet Union believe Moscow's
 anti-SDI campaign has four broad objectives:
 ? Ban the US program while continuing to conduct its
 own research in strategic defense technologies.
 ? Buy time to reinvigorate the Soviet economy and
 catch up with the United States technologically.
 ? Prevent the United States from obtaining a first-
 strike capability and, at a minimum, maintain pari-
 ty with the United States in strategic offensive
 forces.
 ? Gain a propaganda advantage over the United
 States and drive a wedge between the United States
 and its allies and friends in Western Europe and
 Asia, including China.
 The Chinese stress that the Soviets' long-term objec-
 tive is not to prevent the deployment of weapons in
 outer space. Rather, they maintain that Moscow seeks
 only to postpone the competition with the United
 States in space-based weapons until the Soviet Union
 has achieved a stronger position economically. Ac-
 cording to most Chinese analysts, the Soviets fear
 that, if the competition in strategic defense is not
 postponed, the United States will deploy a space-
 based defense system first and seriously jeopardize
 Moscow's nuclear deterrent.
 Chinese analysts expect that the Soviets will attempt
 to meet the SDI challenge by proliferating the num-
 ber of warheads on their land-based missiles and by
 developing and deploying new offensive weapons.
 Chinese analysts also expect the Soviets to attempt to
 defeat the system by the use of penetration aids,
 adjustments in their boosters, and deploying space
 mines and antisatellite weapons. While a minority of
 analysts maintain that Moscow will confine its efforts
 to defeat and destroy the US system, the dominant
 view among Chinese civilian and military analysts is
 that the Soviets will also build their own space-based
 BMD system. Most say Moscow also will use the US
 refusal to put SDI on the table to justify further
 increases in Soviet offensive forces.
 Both civilian and military analysts seem genuinely
 concerned that the Soviets will use force either

 against the US space-based defense system to prevent
 its deployment or against the United States before the
 system is deployed. The Soviets are genuinely afraid
 that the United States is seeking a first-strike capabil-
 ity in SDI, according to Chinese experts, including
 those who maintain that Washington has no offensive
 intentions. Most Chinese analysts assert that the
 Soviet Union will not allow its offensive forces to be
 neutralized by US deployment of a space-based BMD
 system.
 Some analysts downplay such risks, contending that a
 Soviet attack on the US defense system would risk a
 US attack on Soviet space assets and even retaliation
 against Soviet territory that could escalate to global
 nuclear war. But others clearly worry that the Soviets
 might calculate that they have more to lose by
 allowing the United States to deploy an SDI system
 than by taking the risk of launching a first strike.
 China's military analysts and Soviet experts seem
 most inclined to hold this view. An expert on the
 United States from the Foreign Ministry, on the other
 hand, disagrees, arguing that Moscow is more likely
 to seek a political than a military solution to the SDI
 threat.
 Chinese Views on SDI and the Western Alliance
 A number of Chinese analysts believe SDI will exac-
 erbate political and economic tensions within the
 NATO Alliance and could lead to increased West
 European dependence on the United States-develop-
 ments they see as equally negative. In addition, they
 view SDI as potentially weakening the credibility of
 the US deterrent for Europe and thus increasing the
 possibility of instability and conventional war. Chi-
 nese analysts argue that a US space-based BMD
 system will not be able to protect Western Europe
 from Soviet attack because of the short flight times
 for Soviet missiles, while a similar Soviet BMD
 system will neutralize US strategic forces. Western
 Europe, according to this view, would be faced with
 superior Soviet conventional forces and a dubious US
 security guarantee. This new strategic situation would
 lead to serious strains in the NATO Alliance, in-
 creased instability in East-West relations, and greater
 likelihood of conventional war in Europe.
 Alliance. The Europeans must face the consequences
 of what is likely to be an unpopular decision with their
 electorates if they choose to participate, or run the
 risk of falling even further behind the United States
 and Japan if they elect not to.
 Not all Chinese analysts agree with these pessimistic
 views, however. One influential thinker who has writ-
 ten knowledgeably about SDI argues that SDI might
 actually strengthen the defense of West European
 countries. Another analyst associated with a think
 tank with ties to the State Council and Central
 Committee predicted that, rather than leading to a
 major rift between the United States and Western
 Europe, SDI could encourage West European unity
 and "create a strong coalition that will promote the
 revitalization of West European economies and tech-
 nological development." Although there is a possibili-
 ty that SDI could lead to "fiercer competition be-
 tween Western Europe and the United States," he
 said, "this may be beneficial to both sides."
 Chinese Views on Arms Control and SDI
 Although Beijing opposes the deployment of weapons
 in space as envisioned in the SDI program, analysts
 see the announcement of stepped-up efforts by the
 United States in strategic defense research as having
 had some positive consequences. It has heightened the
 Soviet Union's concern about its future position in the
 military balance, they say, compelling Moscow to
 return to the negotiating table. SDI has also played an
 important role in shifting global perceptions of the
 balance of power in favor of the United States. This
 has put the Soviet Union on the defensive, according
 to the Chinese, and forced Soviet leaders to at least
 publicly demonstrate a willingness to compromise on
 some arms control issues.
 While some Chinese analysts doubt that the Reagan
 administration really wants an arms control agree-
 ment with the Soviet Union, all are far more suspi-
 cious of Moscow's intentions. The Chinese contend
 that the Soviet Union used arms control and detente
 with the United States in the 1970s to mask a massive
 buildup of military power. Many Chinese analysts
 maintain that, even if Washington were to agree to

 pate in SDI research is also likely to strain the

 Deng Xiaoping on SDI
 Deng said here today that the "Stars Wars" plan
 must not be carried out because it would cause
 qualitative changes in the arms race between the two
 superpowers. He pointed out that the "Star Wars"
 plan was different in nature from adding a few
 nuclear warheads or changing a few new types of
 missiles.
 - From a conversation with
 Robert Maxwell of the
 Pergamon Press and
 Mirror newspapers
 2 August 1985
 We are concerned about the escalation of the nature
 of the arms race and are opposed to any arms race in
 outer space. We are against whoever goes in for
 development of outer space weapons.
 - Conversation with former
 President Nixon
 6 September 1985
 China opposes any arms race in outer space. The
 space arms race signals the qualitative escalation of
 the US-Soviet arms race rather than escalation in a
 common sense. The danger of such qualitative escala-
 tion is that with a certain degree of development the
 arms race will go completely out of control, thus
 increasing the factors of war rather than reducing the
 danger of war. Therefore, China openly opposes any
 plan leading to a space arms race.
 - Quoted in the Chinese press
 16 September 1985
 abandon the SDI program, Moscow may not be
 willing to make drastic cuts in its land-based missiles
 or to place limits on its research program in defensive
 technologies and weapons. One disarmament expert
 argued that the Soviet Union "won't let US `paper'
 weapons be used to force reduction of actual weap-
 ons." Citing Soviet negotiating tactics, Chinese ex-
 perts on the Soviet Union allow a greater possibility
 that the Soviets might eventually compromise on arms
 control after a long period of negotiations with the
 United States.
 Although most Chinese analysts say that a US-Soviet
 arms control accord is possible in the long run, they
 doubt that an agreement would significantly reduce
 offensive weapons or completely ban deployments of
 weapons in space. They assert that Moscow and
 Washington are likely to make only small concessions
 on offensive and defensive systems while maintaining
 roughly equal capabilities. China would gain, howev-
 er, from the relaxed international environment that
 would follow, and any agreement to halt or postpone
 the extension of the arms race in space would slow the
 growing gap between Chinese military capabilities
 and those of the United States and the Soviet Union.
 Chinese analysts are concerned about the implications
 of Washington's refusal to bargain on SDI, and they
 think the Soviets have scored a tactical victory by
 appearing to be more "peace minded" than the Unit-
 ed States. If Washington remains unwilling to com-
 promise on SDI, they fear that Moscow will build on
 the significant propaganda advantage it already has.
 An arms control specialist on the General Staff
 argued that the US task in Geneva is twofold: to
 convince the Soviets that the United States is deter-
 mined to deploy SDI, so that Moscow will be forced to
 make some compromises; and to present a realistic
 proposal to demonstrate to Moscow, Western Europe,
 and the rest of the world that the United States is not
 seeking superiority over the Soviet Union. "The Unit-
 ed States needs to kick the ball back into the Soviet
 court with a good offer, proof of Soviet [arms control
 treaty] violations and [evidence] of the Soviet BMD
 program."
 According to proponents of this view, the United
 States should use the leverage SDI provides to push
 for an equitable agreement on substantial reductions
 in the nuclear arsenals of both sides. Chinese analysts
 state that, although the Soviet Union has not-and

 will not-give up its goal of achieving nuclear superi-
 ority, it needs to slow the pace of its military spending
 to redress its severe economic problems.
 At the same time, although they claim they would
 welcome a US-Soviet agreement, Chinese analysts
 harbor suspicions that Washington and Moscow could
 agree on terms harmful to Beijing's security interests.
 This concern was voiced most explicitly by a senior
 Soviet expert: "The possibility exists that the United
 States and the Soviet Union will reduce their strategic
 forces and that Soviet INF will not be reduced or
 limited. We think that the United States and the
 Soviet Union should reduce both strategic and theater
 forces.... We hope that the United States and the
 Soviet Union will consider the interests of third
 countries such as China. Third countries will oppose
 any arms control treaties that are not in their
 interests."
 Chinese Views on the Implications
 of SDI for China's Deterrent
 The potential threat to China's nuclear deterrent
 posed by a Soviet BMD as well as possible Chinese
 countermeasures are subjects of extensive discussion
 and analysis by military and civilian thinkers. The
 Chinese fear in the worst case that their small nuclear
 deterrent will be neutralized and that, as a result,
 Beijing's geopolitical and strategic position, as well as
 its immediate security, will be affected. China's mili-
 tary experts are examining some of the countermea-
 sures that have been evaluated in the West, but
 civilian and military analysts agree that countering a
 Soviet BMD would be costly and China would be
 better served if it could avoid increasing its military
 spending-although it will if necessary to preserve its
 deterrent.
 Most military analysts say they are confident that
 China's deterrent will be effective during the long
 period before Soviet deployment of a space-based
 BMD system. One analyst maintained that "no ratio-
 nal defense system can be deployed by the Soviet
 Union for at least 20 to 30 years, and Chinese forces
 will remain effective during this time."
 behind," and, to prevent the technology gap from
 widening, they say, China will have to find some
 means of benefiting from the technological advances
 in the West. A few Chinese institute analysts
 suggested that China
 might participate in EUREKA, although it is too
 early to make a decision because EUREKA is not yet
 a concrete plan. EUREKA seems to appeal to China
 more for political than technological reasons, howev-
 er. Chinese analysts say that EUREKA will enhance
 West European independence and unity and that this
 is the basis of Beijing's support for the program. The
 Chinese expect the West Europeans to lag far behind
 in the technologies being developed for SDI.
 Chinese analysts do not discuss the issue directly, but
 they are concerned about the impact that mutual
 space-based BMD systems would have on maintaining
 Moscow's uncertainty about a US response to a Soviet
 attack on China-a key element in Beijing's deter-
 rent. This concern is reflected in their treatment of
 "flexible response" and West European security.
 Some military analysts are concerned that mutual
 deployment of space-based BMD systems by the
 United States and the Soviet Union will weaken the
 US global deterrence posture while strengthening
 Washington's ability to defend US territory. They see
 SDI as potentially undermining the US strategy of
 "flexible response." On the one hand, the United
 States and the Soviet Union might be more likely to
 fight a war in Europe since they would not risk
 nuclear attack on their homelands; and, on the other
 hand, the United States might be less likely to keep its
 commitments to defend its West European allies if
 they were attacked by the Soviet Union, especially
 since Moscow has superiority in conventional arms in
 Europe. Chinese analysts point to West. European
 doubts that a US BMD system would provide them
 with protection since Soviet missiles have very short
 flight times to West European territory, and an expert
 associated with the Military Academy noted that
 China shared the same geography.
 Chinese analysts are just as concerned about major
 advances in technology resulting from SDI research.
 Most analysts agree that China must not be "left

 Relations With the Soviet Union
 Chinese analysts see Soviet preoccupation with SDI
 as serving China's interests by keeping Moscow on the
 defensive globally and providing the Soviets with
 further incentives to improve ties to Beijing. They
 expect Moscow to seek opportunities to expand its
 dialogue with Beijing, stressing the common ground it
 shares with China in opposing "the arms race in
 space."
 Unstated is what we presume to be the belief of
 Chinese analysts that this heightened concern in
 Washington about a possible Sino-Soviet rapproche-
 ment will increase Beijing's room to maneuver in the
 triangle. At the same time, Chinese thinkers are
 aware that Moscow will seek to exploit China's
 criticism of SDI for its own purposes. They are
 concerned about appearing to side too closely with
 Moscow, but stress that Beijing will not hesitate to
 blame the United States for a lack of progress, if
 China concludes that the Soviet Union is seriously
 seeking an agreement and US "intransigence" on SDI
 is the principal obstacle.
