 PALESTINIANS: Significance of PLO Infighting
 Top Secret
 The fighting in eastern Lebanon on Saturday between Fatah
 rebels and forces loyal to PLO leader Arafat will increase pressure on
 him to make concessions to dissidents despite his efforts to organize
 international support for his position.
 Hostilities reportedly began when the rebels fired on loyalists who
 were attempting to remove a rebel roadblock in Ba'labakk.
 Algerian President Bendjedid arrived in Damascus yesterday after
 talks with Arafat in Algiers on Saturday. The Algerians believe that an
 independent PLO united under Arafat is essential for progress in the
 Middle East negotiations. Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah also is in
 Damascus and is expected to argue the same line.
 Meanwhile, a close aide to Arafat has been meeting with senior
 Soviet officials in Moscow to seek support for the PLO leader in the
 current factional dispute and to urge the Soviets to press Syria to
 stop backing the rebels. The PLO news agency reported on Saturday
 that General Secretary Andropov has sent Arafat a letter endorsing
 his leadership.
 Comment: The rebels' willingness to resort to combat escalates
 their challenge to Arafat and further undermines his credibility. The
 PLO leader is likely to face increased pressure within Fatah to
 accommodate the rebels before more serious fighting occurs.
 Syria and the rebels will be reluctant to move openly to oust
 Arafat so long as he enjoys the backing of other Arab leaders.
 Arafat's Arab supporters, however, probably cannot deter his
 opponents from demanding major concessions as the price for
 ending the rebellion.
 The USSR probably believes that PLO factionalism and a struggle
 between Arafat and Syrian President Assad could impede its efforts
 to unite the Arabs against the Israeli-Lebanese accord, and the
 Soviets may encourage Syria to reconcile its differences with the PLO.
 Moscow will be careful, however, not to jeopardize relations with
 Damascus. Although Arafat's weakness probably will move the USSR
 to press for a tougher PLO stance on Arab-Israeli negotiations, it is
 likely to continue backing Arafat's leadership and criticizing efforts to
 worsen the PLO split.

 Church-state tensions are increasing as both the Catholic
 Archbishop and the Sandinistas have adopted a tougher line.

 25X1
 The Sandinista press has criticized statements made by the
 Archbishop and the Pope during a visit last month by Nicaraguan
 bishops to Rome. In another public attack, the government has
 alleged that some priests are urging parishioners to join Eden
 Pastora's insurgent forces. Interior Minister Borge claims that
 religious freedom still exists in Nicaragua, but that the regime has the
 right to prohibit antigovernment propaganda-even by churches.
 Meanwhile, a Nicaraguan association of priests has dissolved
 itself following pressures from the Vatican to restrict the group's
 political role. As a result, the Catholic clergy will no longer be officially
 represented in the quasi-legislative Council of State.
 The dissolution of the priests' association strengthens the
 position of the Archbishop and indicates that the Pope's support for
 him is paying dividends. The strong backing of the Sandinistas by
 activists in the association gave the regime a lever to use against the
 Church hierarchy.

 INTERNATIONAL: Stalemate at UNCTAD VI
 The stalemate in the North-South dialogue is likely to continue at
 the Sixth Session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development,
 which opens today in Belgrade.
 The developing countries have assembled another long and
 familiar list of proposals for aid increases, trade concessions, and
 commodity price support schemes that the developed nations are
 prepared to reject.
 At the Nonaligned Summit in March, the developing countries
 proposed holding an international conference on money and finance
 for development. As envisioned, the meeting would address a much
 broader range of issues than the monetary conference discussed at
 the Williamsburg Summit.
 Comment: With no prospect for agreement on major substantive
 issues, many participating countries-including some US allies and
 the Communist states-are likely to try to put the blame for a
 deadlock of UNCTAD VI mainly on the US.
 A deadlock may harden the rhetoric of the developing countries,
 but the substance of the demands probably will not change. The
 emphasis on proposals for immediate economic relief will continue in
 subsequent North-South meetings because economic recovery in the
 majority of developing countries will lag behind recovery in the
 developed countries.

 MALAWI: Pressure for Military Takeover
 Many Malawians want the popular Commander of the Army,
 General Khanga, to seize control of the overnment
 Public resentment toward President
 Lffian as regime is sai to a wi espread because of the unexplained
 deaths last month of four leading politicians, two of whom were
 regarded as strong contenders to succeed the octogenarian
 President. Most Malawians believe that the politicians were murdered
 on the orders of senior government officials close to Banda. There
 have been reports of scattered acts of civil unrest in the normally
 placid country.
 Comment: General Khanga appears reluctant to take action
 against Banda, but he may feel compelled to move if unrest
 intensifies. Further disorders could occur late this month when
 legislative elections are scheduled. A military regime headed by
 Khanga would probably continue Banda's strongly pro-Western
 policies.
 The OAU Summit is scheduled to open today in Addis Ababa, but
 US Embassy reporting indicates no imminent solution to the question
 of membership for the Polisario Front-the issue that prevented a
 quorum at the planned summit last August. The Polisario insists on
 attending but is under pressure from the host, Chairman Mengistu,
 and other supporters to stay away in exchange for placing the
 question of its membership on the agenda. Representatives of several
 African governments are negotiating informally to try to reach a
 compromise.
 Comment: Morocco almost certainly will boycott the summit if
 the Polisario is seated at the opening session. It is unclear whether
 Rabat would be joined by a sufficient number of other moderate
 opponents of the Polisario to prevent a quorum. Failure by the OAU to
 hold the summit this time-the organization's third attempt in the
 past year-could lead to an irreparable split between radicals and
 moderates and could seriously weaken the OAU's position as
 international spokesman for Africa and as regional mediator.F_~

 Special Analysis
 CUBA: Implications of Hard Currency Shortage
 Top Secret
 The Cuban economy, despite the recent rescheduling of debt
 repayments totaling more than $500 million, faces more hard currency
 shortages during the next two years. These shortages will force
 adjustments that will retard economic growth and reduce personal
 consumption. The Castro regime shows no inclination, however, to
 adopt more pragmatic policies that would spur productivity or reduce
 hardships.
 Cuba's position began to worsen in 1981 with the severe drop in
 world sugar prices-the source of more than half of Havana's hard
 currency earnings-and a substantial rise in debt service costs.
 Last year, after Western financial institutions withdrew more than
 $700 million in short-term deposits from Cuban banks, Havana had to
 reschedule its medium- and long-term debts.
 The principal effect of the hard currency shortage has been a
 forced reduction-about 30 percent last year-of imports from
 Western nations. Havana depends on these imports for high-quality
 consumer and producer goods, some of which are unavailable from
 CEMA. Cuba currently is concentrating on imports of essential raw
 materials and other goods necessary to produce exports, at the
 expense of capital investment and consumer goods.
 Export growth almost certainly will be constrained, however, by
 the reduction of imports. The government will do what it can to
 support the production of sugar, tobacco, and nickel, the most
 important foreign exchange earners. Nevertheless, all export
 production will be hurt by the reduced output that already has
 occurred in construction, steel, and transportation
 Stagnation and Austerity
 As a result of the foreign exchange shortage, Havana has little
 hope of achieving any economic growth this year. The outlook
 through 1985 is only slightly brighter.
 Lack of construction materials will thwart Cuban efforts to build
 new sugar mills, hotels, electric plants, and similar projects. In
 addition, much capital equipment will not be replaced or repaired
 when it should be, and increasing numbers of factories-particularly
 in the nonexport sectors-will be forced to close or cut back
 operations.

 Top Secret
 The austere standard of living is likely to be reduced further over
 the next few years as a result of the hard currency shortage and
 related economic stagnation. The availability of consumer goods will
 dwindle, and food supplies also may be affected, as imports are cut
 and domestic production reduced.
 Economic Policy Measures
 Although the economic situation probably will prompt new debate
 in the leadership about economic policy, the regime is only likely to
 adopt a few token reform measures. Havana seems intent mainly on
 imposing new austerity measures. The government already is
 preparing the population for tougher times through speeches and
 newspaper articles urging the people to work harder and sacrifice
 more.
 The hardliners who dominate the leadership hold the view-and
 probably will convince President Castro-that any measures
 smacking of economic liberalization risk creating a groundswell of
 demands for more. Only last spring the hardliners, using ideological
 arguments, persuaded Castro to impose restrictions on the farmers'
 free markets. Moreover, the events in Poland are likely to have
 strengthened the President's concern over the dangers of ideological
 deviation.
 The increased austerity probably will not create any threat to
 Castro's authority in the near future. The exodus from Mariel in 1980
 purged the island of many potential troublemakers, and, although
 incidents such as the sabotage announced by Havana last month may
 continue, the vast majority of Cubans recognize that overt opposition
 would be crushed quickly. Castro will be careful to continue ensuring
 the loyalty of hiss   rit forces b protecting their incomes and
 standard of living
 Future Financing Problems
 Cuba will need to obtain about $300 million in new financing
 this year and next year to import even the reduced amounts it has
 planned. This will be difficult, however, because of the continued
 wariness on the part of lenders and the ceiling on total debt-
 $3.4 billion, or only $200 million above current levels-set in the
 rescheduling agreement.
 Havana cannot afford to cut further into its reserves. They
 probably are already below the $180 million minimum established in
 the rescheduling agreement. Imports thus are not likely to be above
 the level of $880 million in 1982 and may even drop below this
 amount.

 Top Secret
 Cuba already has publicly indicated that it will request a
 rescheduling of payments on principal due in 1984. In addition,
 because of weather-related crop damage that has reduced hard
 currency earnings this year, the Cubans may default on, or request a
 rescheduling of, the estimated $200 million due in interest payments
 this year. During the midterm review by its creditor monitoring
 committee, Cuba is likely to ask for an adjustment of the targets set in
 its rescheduling agreement, blaming the crop damage for its inability
 to meet them.
 Castro cannot count on the USSR to provide the necessary
 foreign exchange. Nearly all Soviet aid to Cuba is in soft currency. The
 hard currency shortage nevertheless will bind Cuba more closely to
 the USSR and its allies as the soft currency source for needed
 imports.
 The USSR has eased Cuba's problems somewhat in recent years
 by purchasing some sugar for hard currency and permitting the
 resale, for foreign exchange, of Soviet-provided oil that Cuba has
 been able to conserve. On the other hand, the Soviets' current
 demand that Havana fill its sugar contracts with them underscores
 Moscow's preoccupation with its own economic problems.

 CHINA: The Sixth National People's Congress
 Top Secret
 The National People's Congress convening today in Beijing is
 unlikely to produce any major departures from current economic and
 political policies. As China's official ruling body, the Congress
 probably will appoint a new president and a chairman of the new
 Central Military Commission. The gathering also may clarify Beijing's
 intentions regarding urgent economic problems and consider more
 proposals by the leadership for bureaucratic reform. If things go
 smoothly on these domestic issues, Deng Xiaoping and his allies
 probably will find their hand strengthened in foreign policy as well.
 The Congress reflects Beijing's organizational goals. For this sixth
 term, composition of the 3,000-member body has been changed
 demonstrate the regime's effort to co-opt the technocratic elite.
 More than one-third of the delegates come from outside the
 party, and intellectuals and professionals are represented in markedly
 increased numbers. The Standina Committee of the Congress will
 contain a host of new faces.
 New Appointments
 A two-day Central Committee work conference last week
 approved candidates for national office who will be formally named at
 the Congress. These include the Congress's own officers, who serve
 five-year terms, and China's most prominent administrators-the
 premier and his deputies; state councilors, ministers, and secretary
 general of the State Council; and judicial officials., Premier Zhao
 Ziyang, the two vice premiers, and most other incumbents will be
 returned to office.
 There has been considerable speculation about who will fill the
 new constitutionally mandated posts of chief of state and chairman of
 the Central Military Commission. Politburo Standing Committee
 member Li Xiannian, 78, is widely expected to become China's first
 chief of state since 1967. There is an outside chance, however, that he
 will decline the lar el ceremonial post on the grounds of poor health.
 Chairmanship of the potentially powerful Central Military
 Commission almost certainly will go to Deng, who currently heads the
 party's military commission. If not, it could go to one of Deng's

 Top Secret
 The creation of a government commission is part of an effort by
 Deng and his reformist allies to end the close command relationship
 between the Army and the party, which allowed a small group of
 leaders to direct the military against its political enemies during the
 Cultural Revolution. They also seek to allow commanders greater
 freedom from party interference in routine military affairs and ensure
 firm civilian oversight of the military budget.
 Some old guard officers apparently have opposed creation of a
 government organization that dilutes direct party control of the
 military. As a result the central authorities may still be debating its
 exact powers.
 Economic Policy
 Zhao's report on the government's performance since the last
 Congress will be the most important of three economic reports
 presented to the Congress. Although Zhao probably will stick to
 current policy lines, his remarks will indicate whether Beijing is now
 ready to provide stronger solutions to economic problems.
 The Premier will again warn managers to keep investment within
 the limits established by the current plan, and he probably will
 criticize excessive growth in heavy industry. He also will urge closer
 attention to productivity, a casualty of the too-rapid growth in output
 during recent months. In addition, Zhao will be likely to call for a
 continuation of Beijing's measured approach to economic
 management reforms.
 Most of the leadership agrees on the general thrust of current
 reform policies but differs on questions of pace and scope. Many of
 the leaders favoring increased investment and rapid growth of heavy
 industry were eclipsed after the retrenchment in 1981. Some of their
 arguments have regained currency, however, and senior leaders are
 still trying to settle on an appropriate balance between investment
 and consumption.
 Organizational Reforms
 Zhao may propose additional measures to restore momentum to
 the ambitious attempt to streamline the bureaucracy. Last month the
 first phase of provincial bureaucratic reforms came to a close after
 26 of 29 top provincial-level administrators had been replaced
 Media reporting-and the recent establishment of a new committee
 to spur the reform of national-level organizations suggest that efforts
 to eliminate redundant organizations and officials, to upgrade
 personnel, and to rationalize administration have stalled in many
 central ministries and are having trouble in getting under way at lower
 levels.
