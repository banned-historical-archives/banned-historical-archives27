 China's Sixth Five-Year
 Economic Plan (1981-85)
 Key Judgments    The approval last December of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) was a
 ln/ormation available   milestone that the Chinese leadership had been working toward since
 as of 1 June 1983       Mao's death in 1976. For Beijing, the restoration of an orderly planning
 was used in this report.
 process may be more significant than the plan itself. During the Cultural
 Revolution (1966-76) China's planning apparatus was dismantled, and
 plans reportedly consisted of little more than targets for a few important
 commodities. Now, the planning bureaucracies have been reestablished
 and strengthened, and they have produced a plan that Beijing regards as
 only its second real five-year plan-along with the First Five-Year Plan
 (1953-57).
 Perhaps most important to the top leadership, policy discussions leading up
 to the plan have been relatively free of ideological cant and have explored a
 wider range of options. This plan emphasizes factors such as economic
 efficiency, productivity, and consumer needs, and virtually ignores socialist
 proprieties. In our judgment, Beijing's policies have become more realistic,
 particularly in comparison with earlier years when more traditional Soviet-
 style economic ideas or Maoist notions guided economic policies.
 The Sixth Plan is more comprehensive and methodologically sounder than
 recent plans, but we believe that it still falls far short of being fully
 comprehensive and internally consistent. The limited capabilities of Chi-
 nese planners, the scarcity and uneven quality of basic economic data, and
 the political and economic complexities of governing 1 billion people all
 prevent Beijing from doing much better at present. Because final decisions
 on many issues have yet to be made, and because of problems with the plan
 itself, we expect a number of revisions in the plan during 1983-85. Indeed,
 the government has referred to the desirability of a "rolling plan," to which
 adjustments would be made annually.
 The "five-year plan" is really athree-year plan (1983-85), given the late
 1982 approval date. Relatively rapid growth in 1981-82 has put Beijing in
 a position where many of the 1985 output targets can be met with ease:
 ? Because national income grew at an average rate of 5.2 percent in 1981-
 82, it need only grow 2.6 percent annually during 1983-85 to meet the
 target for national income.
 ? Similarly, agriculture must grow at only 1.2 percent annually in 1983-85
 to meet the 1985 target-because growth in 1981-82 averaged 8.3
 percent.
 ? And industry, after growing by 5.9 percent yearly in 1981-82, need only
 grow 2.7 percent annually for the next three years to melt the 1985
 target.

 But we anticipate that Beijing will have difficulties attaining other goals
 where the demands on management are greater. These include targets for
 energy conservation, lower costs, and higher productivity that are critical
 to Beijing's attempts to reduce waste and make the economy more
 competitive internationally.
 One obstacle to plan fulfillment is the lack of adequate management
 systems, such as cost accounting and quality control procedures, that
 permit plant managers to monitor cost, quality, and productivity trends. To
 facilitate needed improvements, Beijing has set modest output targets to
 reduce the pressures of current production responsibilities on management.
 Another impediment is the shortage of managerial skills. China's bureauc-
 racies have trouble handling even simple tasks and can hardly be expected
 to deal expediently and effectively with complex problems such as energy
 conservation. Nor can management reforms be expected to alter substan-
 tially the current situation any time soon. The top leadership continues to
 advocate economic reforms, and some partial steps have been taken; but
 full-scale reforms have been postponed until after 1985, when Beijing
 hopes to have in hand a more comprehensive reform program.
 Beijing's emphasis on energy, agriculture, transportation, and science and
 technology-areas where US industry enjoys a relatively strong competi-
 tive position-has broad implications for the United States:
 ? Heavy spending in the oil and coal industries will create attractive
 opportunities for US businesses. The Chinese will require advice, technol-
 ogy, machinery and equipment, and support services.
 ? Further opportunities will arise in connection with the large-scale
 replacement of machinery and equipment and the renovation of plants in
 other industries.
 ? Limited prospects for agricultural development mean that demand for
 grain imports will remain strong, and the potential for continued large
 US sales good.
 ? Plans to upgrade education, management techniques, science, and tech-
 nology imply a larger, closer relationship with the United States, with
 more Chinese students and scientists coming to the United States and
 more sales of US technology to China.
 ? On a negative note, in the next few years the small number of deepwater
 ports and harbors will continue to hinder US carriers from achieving the
 minimum one-third share of cargo called for in US-PRC maritime
 agreements.
 ? We also cannot rule out the possibility that continuing strains in US-
 PRC political relations will ultimately reduce Beijing's desire for greater
 US involvement in China's modernization.

 China's Sixth Five-Year
 Economic Plan (1981-85
 A Milestone
 On 10 December 1982 China's National People's
 Congress (NPC) approved the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 (FYP) for National Economic and Social Develop-
 ment (1981-85). Three days later, Beijing published
 excerpts from the plan-altogether about one-third of
 the document submitted to the congress. These were
 important milestones that the leadership had worked
 toward since Mao's death in late 1976. During the
 Cultural Revolution (1966-76) China's planning appa-
 ratus was dismantled, and planning consisted of little
 more than setting annual targets for a few important
 commodities.
 Approval of the Sixth FYP thus marks a return to
 orderly and comprehensive economic decision making
 after a hiatus of more than 20 years. According to
 Fang Weizhong, Vice Minister of the State Planning
 Commission, only the First FYP (1953-57) was "fairly
 comprehensive" and successfully fulfilled. The Second
 FYP was aborted after a series of manmade and
 natural disasters in 1958-59, and the remaining plans
 were plans in name only. Fang has described them as
 consisting merely of suggested quotas or as being only
 outlines.
 Although the Sixth Plan is more comprehensive and
 methodologically sounder than earlier five-year plans,
 in our judgment it falls far short of being fully
 comprehensive and internally consistent. The limited
 capabilities of Chinese planners, the scarcity and poor
 quality of basic economic data, and the political and
 economic complexities of governing 1 billion people
 prevent the Chinese from doing much better at pres-
 ent. To some extent, the shortcomings of the plan are
 offset or ameliorated by the limited scope of the plan.
 This plan's moderate targets also distinguish it from
 previous plans. The leadership is sensitive to unrealis-
 tically high growth targets, a nearly constant feature
 of economic "planning" for the past quarter century.

 The most recent example is the overly ambitious "10  25X1
 year plan" unveiled by then Chairman Hua Guofeng
 in early 1978 and roundly rejected by Beijin  after
 the Third Plenum in December of that year.-
 Scope of the Plan
 Although the plan is the principal determinant of
 economic activity, it is not an all-encompassing instru-
 ment. As in other socialist planned economies, much
 economic activity in China occurs outside the state
 plan. It is only because of this extraplan activity,
 much of it semilegal or illicit, that the economy
 functions as well as it does. Ironically, enterprise
 managers often can fulfill plan targets only by using
 semilegal means to acquire scarce inputs.
 The data in table 1 suggest the limited scope of the
 plan in terms of commodity production. They show,
 for example, that in 1982 just over 44 percent of gross
 value of agricultural and industrial output was cov-   25X1
 ered by the annual economic plan. The proportion for
 agriculture, 57.5 percent, was higher than that for
 industry, 40 percent. In both agriculture and industry

 the planned portion of output has declined since 1979,
 reflecting Beijing's decision to allow more production
 and marketin  activity to be guided by market forces.
 These data, however, understate the importance of the
 plan. Despite Beijing's willingness to countenance
 more market activity, the production and distribution
 of almost all major commodities are still controlled by
 the plan. Also, through efforts to plan employment,
 wages, investment, prices, and other macroeconomic
 variables, Beijing exerts strong influence on extraplan
 activity. The important point is that the plan is the
 principal, but not sole, determinant of overall econom-
 ic activity.
 Really aThree-Year Plan
 Because it was finally approved by the NPC only in
 late 1982, the new plan is in fact athree-year plan for
 1983-85. As the data in table 2 illustrate, goals that
 seem moderate or slightly ambitious for the full 1981-
 85 period appear conservative, sometimes absurdly so,
 when the rapid growth during 1981-82 is taken into
 account. Overall industrial production during 1981-82
 grew at an average annual rate of about 6 percent,
 almost 50 percent faster than the plan called for. It
 will only have to grow at 2.7 percent annually in
 1983-85 to fulfill plan targets. In the heavy industrial
 sector, for example, growth rebounded from a nega-
 tive 4.7 percent in 1981 to a positive 9.9-percent rate

 c:ontiaential
 in 1982 and thus far in 1983 is running almost 12
 percent above last year, suggesting that it will easily
 exceed the 3-percent target for the period as a whole.
 Other production data, for agriculture as well, suggest
 the same.
 There are some areas, however, for which we believe
 objectives of the FYP are less conservative, and
 perhaps too ambitious. Targets for energy conserva-
 tion, production costs, and labor productivity, for
 example-because of Beijing's clear failure in these
 areas over the past decade-appear less likely to be
 fulfilled.
 Beijing's preference for a plan that in many respects is
 conservative is based primarily on its desire to lay the
 foundation for more rapid growth in the 1990s, as
 Premier Zhao Ziyang explained at the National
 People's Congress last fall. Probably foremost in the
 leadership's mind are the bottlenecks that now impede
 growth. Eliminating or ameliorating these constraints,
 particularly those in energy and transportation, can-
 not be accomplished quickly and will require heavy
 investment. At the same time-and in a sense a
 bottleneck of formidable proportions-the economic
 system is extremely wasteful in its use of resources.
 Beijing recognizes that, if the economy is to satisfy
 the current demands of consumers and provide for
 future growth, operating efficiency must improve
 substantially.
 It is our view that this recognition underlies Beijing's
 preoccupation with "economic results" and the de-
 emphasis of gross output targets. The Chinese have
 already carried out some preliminary, modest reforms
 to enhance economic efficiency. At the same time
 they have focused on reinstituting and strengthening
 fundamental management systems, such as cost ac-
 counting and quality control procedures, that permit
 plant managers to monitor cost, quality, and produc-
 tivity developments. From discussions in the media,
 our impression is that, almost seven years after the
 official end of the Cultural Revolution, most enter-
 prises still have not reinstituted effective management
 systems. To smooth and speed up the process, Beijing
 has set modest output targets to reduce the pressures
 of current production responsibilities on management.   25X1
 Noneconomic factors also underlie certain plan goals.
 In any country, planners may prefer a particular
 program or target for technical or economic reasons,
 but politics or bureaucratic rigidities frequently con-
 vince them that an alternative program or goal is
 preferable. We are unable to point to a clear example
 in the Sixth FYP of accommodation to political
 pressures, but we believe accommodations surely have
 occurred.' Since China has no history of strong,
 technically sound central planning, political and bu-
 reaucratic factors probably play stronger roles in the
 planning process than in other planned socialist econ-
 omies:
 Political considerations are obviously important ele-
 ments in policies toward foreign technology and in-
 vestment. The Chinese remain extremely sensitive
 because of infringements on China's sovereignty by
 the West and Japan during the past century. Al-
 though the ideological climate has eased compared
 with the mid-1970s, Beijing continues to be concerned
 about and to watch closely the influence of foreign
 ideas on Chinese society. Recognizing the potential
 benefits from foreign technology and investment,
 Beijing has taken pains to insulate commercial and
 other economic links from political strains in their
 bilateral relationships-most importantly with the
 United States. We cannot rule out the possibility,
 however, that over time political strains could ad-
 versely affect developments in trade and technology.

 Midway Through the Plan: Continuing Instability
 Two decades of ill-conceived economic policies and
 weak planning are largely to blame for the economic
 situation facing Beijing today. The problems are
 familiar ones. None is of recent origin, and some were
 apparent as early as a decade ago. The problems
 include:
 ? Severe energy shortages and transportation bottle-
 necks.
 ? High per-unit energy and raw materials consump-
 tion, stagnating labor productivity, and large inven-
 tories of unwanted products.
 ? Uncertain budget revenues.
 ? Strong inflationary pressures and high unemploy-
 ment.
 Energy shortages-especially in key industrial cities
 in the east and northeast-have led the government to
 step up its effort to close plants where energy use is
 wasteful and to issue stronger regulations aimed at
 reducing power consumption. Shortages of transport
 capacity have been especially noticeable in their
 impact on energy supplies. In Shanxi Province, Chi-
 na's largest coal producer, coal has piled up at mine
 heads because of the lack of railway capacity to haul
 it to industrial consumers in other provinces.
 Economic planners in the past two years have concen-
 trated on improving industrial efficiency, but they
 have achieved little. The wasteful consumption of
 energy and raw materials, and excessive inventories-
 evidence of low product quality and inappropriate
 output mix-remain serious problems, even after sev-
 eral years of attention from Beijing's bureaucrats.
 Unprecedentedly large budget deficits in 1979 and
 1980, followed by smaller ones in 1981 and 1982,
 have contributed to the general economic instability.
 The immediate reaction to the situation-caused by
 heavy spending on new programs and unanticipated
 drops in revenues-was to cut expenditures while
 seeking ways to stabilize and increase revenues. Bei-
 jing has now taken the more practical steps of repos-
 sessing anumber of revenue sources previously turned
 over to lower level authorities and revising the tax
 system. Based on projections of much higher reve-
 nues, the Chinese have greatly increased budget
 expenditures in 1983. First-quarter data, however,
 show only a slight gain in revenues. If current trends
 continue, the budget deficit in 1983 could be much
 larger than the small one now anticipated.
 After several years of rapid improvements, gains in
 urban living standards tapered off in 1981 and 1982.
 They face further threats from inflation and unem-
 ployment. Inflationary pressures may have eased
 somewhat since 1979-80, but remain strong. As prices
 continue to rise at moderate-to-rapid rates, and in-
 creases in money incomes slow-in response to Bei-
 jing's attempts to tie wages to productivity-gains in
 real incomes will fall further. Urban unemployment
 probably rose in 1981-82, following a brief decline
 from the peak of 10 to 20 percent in 1979. Unemploy-
 ment has been rising in the countryside as well. In
 both urban and rural areas the number of new
 entrants to the labor force has risen and will remain
 high throughout the plan period while slow industrial
 growth will hinder efforts to provide more jobs. In our
 judgment, high rates of unemployment will continue.
 Major Policy Issues
 Four issues dominated economic policy debates dur-
 ing the preparation of the plan:
 ? The rate of investment, and consumer needs.
 ? The relative rates of growth for heavy and light
 industry.
 ? The role of the market in China's economy.
 ? The extent of reliance on foreign capital and
 technology.                '
 Economic policy in 1979-80 had a relatively strong
 proconsumption, promarket, pro-light-industry orien-
 tation, coupled with an emphasis on China's capacity
 to profit from foreign capital and technology. Current
 policies contain the same general thrust, but are more
 moderate and subtle. On investment-consumption is-
 sues, for example, the FYP-in light of performance
 in 1981-82-gives greater weight to capital needs.

 Investment Versus Consumption. Since late 1978, the
 Chinese leadership has criticized earlier economic
 policy for placing too much emphasis on investment
 (largely in the heavy industry sector) and too little on
 improving living standards, which had stagnated since
 the late 1950s. The government has steadily reduced
 the portion of national income going to investment
 activity, has channeled more investment to consumer
 goods industries, and has dramatically raised incomes
 and consumption levels in both rural and urban areas.'
 This proconsumer shift has been accompanied by a
 debate in the Chinese press over consumption's appro-
 priate share of national income. It grew from 64
 percent in 1978 to 72 percent in 1981. Few people
 have argued against improvements in living stand-
 ards, or even against the large increases in incomes
 that occurred in 1979 and 1980. Rather the discussion
 has centered on whether further rapid growth in
 consumption, and an increase in the share of national
 income going to consumption, will endanger future
 economic growth and living standards.
 There are signs that early last year these concerns led
 Beijing to moderate its emphasis on living standards.
 The media cited warnings by senior policymakers
 Chen Yun and Li Xiannian against consuming too
 much and investing too little. We believe there is a
 leadership consensus that further growth in the con-
 sumption share would make it difficult to ensure a
 rate of investment sufficient to alleviate bottlenecks
 and provide a higher rate of economic growth in the
 future.
 Rates of Growth for Heavy and Light Industry. The
 policy debate over the relative rates of growth of
 heavy and light industry has paralleled, and is part of,
 the debate on investment and consumption. As stated
 above, beginning in 1978 Beijing began to give un-
 precedented emphasis to consumer goods production,
 reversing the priority accorded heavy industry in most
 of the preceding 30 years. This resulted in the rapid
 expansion of light industry and a low growth rate for
 heavy industry through 1981. Drafts of the Sixth FYP
 circulating as late as mid-1982 continued to call for at
 least 7-percent annual growth for light industry and
 for only 1-percent annual growth for heavy industry.
 Between July and November, however, the targets
 were altered to 5 percent for light and 3 percent for
 heavy industry. We interpret this, too, to reflect the
 leadership's growing belief that investment needed to
 be higher.
 The government now seems to have refined its indus-
 trial policy somewhat. Instead of one-sidedly stressing
 light or heavy industry, it is trying to adjust product
 mix and improve quality within these sectors. But as
 media articles attest, the arguments about heavy
 versus light industry are still alive and, in our view,
 will continue even after Beijing resolves the invest-
 ment question because bureaucratic constituencies
 will continue to compete for resources.
 Role o1'the Market. During 1979-81, when planning
 and the use of markets were widely discussed, many
 government economists argued in journals and the
 daily press that China's past economic difficulties
 were largely the fault of centralized planning and that
 market forces should be allowed to play a larger role.
 Concurrently, Beijing shifted additional financial, in-
 vestment, production, and marketing responsibilities
 to enterprises and local governments, formally decen-
 tralizing anumber of economic decisions. Beginning
 in 1981, although government leaders continued to
 advocate some role for the market, they made it clear
 that the market would be allowed to play only a
 subsidiary role; the plan would continue to be the
 dominant instrument of resource allocation.
 We believe this policy shift was probably triggered by
 the unexpected and unacceptable loss of control over
 financial and investment matters, as well as by the
 ground swell of arguments belittling planning. The
 leadership has decided that to concentrate resources
 effectively on problem sectors it must have stronger
 central management.
 Foreign Capital and Technology. Discussions about
 the inflow of foreign capital and technology have
 aroused strong expressions of nationalistic and protec-
 tionist sentiments, but we believe the leadership is
 relatively unified in its support for stronger links to

 the international economy. Beijing's seemingly unbri-
 dled enthusiasm in the late 1970s for foreign capital
 and technology has waned, but this pulling back is
 based more on careful examination of costs and
 benefits than on nationalistic impulse. In 1978, Chi-
 na's foreign trade corporations went on a buying spree
 and in a matter of months placed orders for almost
 $8 billion worth of Western and Japanese whole
 plants. Policy changes in late 1978 shifted khe focus of
 capital imports toward infrastructure, energy, and
 light industry. At the same time, foreign exchange
 shortages forced major cutbacks in imports of capital
 goods. Since then, the Chinese have scaled back their
 investment program, leading to further reductions in
 imports of capital goods. (They have signed only about
 $2.5 billion worth of contracts for whole plants since
 1979.)
 With the Sixth Plan now approved and China in
 its strongest international financial position ever
 ($11 billion in foreign exchange reserves at yearend
 1982), we expect imports of capital goods to rebound.
 Beijing is planning to bring in large quantities of
 machinery and equipment; the concessional loans
 lined up between 1979 and 1982 will probably be
 drawn upon to finance the drive. There were rumors
 last summer that Beijing was considering more re-
 strictive laws on foreign equity participation in Chi-
 nese enterprises. But recent changes in tax laws to
 reduce the tax burden on foreign investors and pro-
 gress on legal issues that will reduce investor uncer-
 tainty indicate continuing, relatively broad-based sup-
 port for foreign economic policies.
 Sixth FYP Goals and Prospects
 Beijing stresses several themes when describing the
 plan, contrasting current policies with earlier ones:
 ? Realistic targets, based on actual economic condi-
 tions-as opposed to "wishful thinking."
 ? Growth derived largely from improvements in effi-
 ciency and productivity, rather than primarily from
 additions to labor and to capital.
 ? Stronger central control of investment, targeted
 especially at major projects in energy and transpor-
 tation and at upgrading industrial technologies.
 ? Appropriate attention to the development of science
 and technology, and to manpower training.
 ? Production geared to social needs, including person-
 al consumption requirements.
 Investment: The Heart oJthe Plan. From the targets
 for wages and living standards, it appears that Beijing
 now believes that its capital requirements are so large
 that only modest improvements in living standards are
 possible in 1983-85 (see table 3). Over the five years,
 Beijing plans to expand urban employment by about
 22 million jobs. At the same time, the wage bill is to
 increase at a 4.9-percent average annual rate. These
 figures suggest only a 1-percent-per-year increase in
 the average wage-in sharp contrast to the rapid
 gains during 1978-80.? Furthermore, the average
 Retirements from the urban labor force have been high, and in the
 1981-85 period another 5 percent of the labor force will retire. The
 replacement of seasoned workers with younger, lower paid workers
 will tend to reduce the average wage, but this fact does not detract
 from the point that wage targets for the period are modest by recent

 wage in 1982 (798 yuan) is already very close to the
 target for 1985 (800 yuan). Similarly, although per
 capita rural income is slated to grow by 6 percent per
 year during 1981-85, all of the targeted gain has come
 in the first two years of the plan. The plan also calls
 for per capita consumption to increase by 4 percent or
 more per annum, and while there are no data yet for
 1982 we suspect that this goal also has already been,
 or is close to being, fulfilled. Beijing certainly will not
 attempt to cap personal incomes at current or planned
 levels, but it is clear that the government will try hard
 to keep future increases within labor productivity
 improvements and below the gains recorded in 1981-
 82.
 In contrast, investment plans call for additional large
 spending in 1983-85. At the moment, Beijing is
 particularly concerned about funding for key projects.
 Last year, several critical energy and transportation
 projects were held up by inadequate funding and
 shortages of construction materials.
 The Investment Plan. During 1981-85, China plans to
 spend 230 billion yuan on newjrxed investment (or
 capital construction), with the 130-billion-yuan bal-
 ance of a total 360-billion-yuan investment plan going
 to replacement investments
 ' These figures pertain only to investment by the state sector. Also,
 capital construction includes a small amount of replacement invest-
 The 230 billion yuan for capital construction (new
 fixed investment) averages 46 billion yuan per year,
 marginally higher than in the Fifth FYP, but only 11
 percent of national income compared with 14.8 per-
 cent in the Fifth Plan. Approximately 52 percent of
 the 230 billion yuan is to go to industry, down from 55
 percent in 1976-80 (see table 4 and figure 2).
 Beijing is finally channeling significant investment
 into problem sectors. The fuel and power industries
 are to receive one-fourth of capital construction, up in
 both absolute and percentage terms. Another 13
 percent of capital construction will go to communica-
 tions and transport services. Thus, these two critical
 sectoral constraints on economic growth will receive
 nearly 40 percent of all new fixed investment.
 Capital construction in other sectors is down from
 1976-801evels. The machine-building industry will
 get a scant 2 percent of industrial investment com-
 pared with 14 percent in the Fifth Plan period (see
 table 5 and figure 3).6 The chemical industry's share
 will also drop, from 14 percent to 10 percent. Metal-
 lurgy is yet another sector where investment will fall
 in both absolute and percentage terms

 In our opinion, one of the most important features of
 the Sixth FYP is that 130 billion yuan will be spent to
 renovate and replace machinery and equipment-
 referred to by the Chinese as technical transforma-
 tion. This represents 36 percent of total fixed invest-
 ment, as against 20 percent in earlier periods, and
 reflects Beijing's belated recognition that its antiquat-
 ed industrial plant uses energy and raw materials very
 wastefully, reducing China's ability to compete in
 foreign markets. Much of the machinery to be re-
 placed is in the metallurgical, energy, and chemical
 industries. Because the machine-building industries
 are vital to any attempt to upgrade technologies, a
 large chunk of this investment also will go to that
 sector.

 Table 5
 China: Distribution of Capital Construction in Industry,
 1976-85
 Although spending for up-to-date machinery and
 equipment is much larger in this five-year plan, it is
 not clear that the Chinese have given much thought to
 the directions they want to take and the problems they
 are likely to encounter. Yu Guangyuan, a respected
 Chinese Government economist, has been quoted as
 saying-two months after the Sixth FYP was ap-
 proved-that the government still lacks a feasible
 long-term plan for technical transformation.
 The plan document lists nine "major measures" for
 reasserting government control over the scale of in-
 vestment. All but the smallest capital construction
 projects must be approved by the State Planning
 Commission; the remainder must be affirmed by
 provincial planning departments. Technical transfor-
 mation projects are subject to similar controls. As a
 further safeguard, all funding for capital construction
 is to be controlled by the Construction Bank of China,
 the disbursement arm of the Ministry of Finance.
 These measures are similar in spirit to earlier ones
 that have rarely worked, mainly because the central
 government has been unable to control the volume of
 investment spending by enterprises and local govern-
 ments.
 Two additional steps are being taken in this FYP to
 control the amount and focus the direction of invest-
 ment. Beijing has set up a special fund for key
 projects in energy and transport, under the aegis of
 the Ministry of Finance. The fund will amount to 4
 billion yuan per year and will be funded from the 60-
 odd-billion yuan annually retained by enterprises.
 Most enterprises will be required to turn 10 percent of
 their retained funds in to state coffers. The second
 step consists of financial penalties for unapproved
 investment: a 30-percent surcharge, for example, will
 be levied on beyond-plan investment
 The new guidelines .are stronger than in past years,
 and the 30-percent surcharge should keep some enter-
 prises from exceeding plan targets. But it is far from
 clear that these measures, even if they are implement-
 ed, will bring investment under control.
 Improving Investment Results. We believe Beijing
 thinks investment will be less efficient in this five-year
 plan than in 1976-80. The incremental capital-output
 ratio (ICOR) is a measure of investment efficiency

 that indicates the volume of investment required for a
 unit increase in output. Two varieties of ICORs are
 presented in table 6.' Both ICORs are significantly
 higher than in the Fifth Plan period, suggesting that
 more investment will be required for each unit in-
 crease in national income. In fact, the ICORs are
 closer to Fourth Plan (1971-75) ratios. We believe the
 relatively efficient Fifth Plan ratios are an aberration
 resulting from high growth rates of national income in
 the post-1976 recovery period.
 We also attribute the apparent drop in investment
 efficiency to changes in the pattern of investment
 activity. Investment will be focused on bottleneck
 sectors such as energy and transport, and in projects
 that require lengthy completion times. Some of the
 investment activity in this plan period will not yield
 capacity increases until the ensuing plan period (see
 table 7). In the case of oil and natural gas, capital
 construction investment is purely replacement invest-
 ment and contributes nothing to additional capacity.
 Accelerated replacement of old capital stock will also
 increase investment requirements. For years, Chinese
 economists have argued that China's rate of deprecia-
 tion for fixed assets is too low and have urged the
 government to raise it. Now, Beijing appears to be
 taking their advice. This will encourage enterprises to
 scrap old machinery, and with capital retired at a  25X1
 faster rate, fixed investment will have to increase
 more rapidly simply to maintain production.
 Industry. In industry, growth targets are modest. The
 goal for light industry implies only 1.9-percent growth
 annually over the next three years, and heavy indus-
 try's targeted 3.6-percent rate is well below its histori-
 cal average (see table 8). These low targets, Beijing
 believes, will reduce pressures on enterprise managers
 and allow them to focus on more fundamental prob-
 lems. This also will make it easier for Beijing to
 reorganize enterprises and strengthen management.
 Managers will be able to pay greater attention to   25X1
 raising productivity, cutting costs, and improving
 quality. To a considerable degree, the success or
 failure of the FYP hinges on how well Beijing and its
 managers handle these tasks.
 Beijing's attempts to reorganize enterprises and raise
 the level of management have already fallen behind
 schedule. According to Yuan Baohua of the State   25X1
 Economic Commission (SEC), who is coordinating
 this "consolidation" of enterprises, by mid-April the
 process had been completed at only 14 percent of the
 1,320 largest industrial firms, far below the 70-
 percent completion target. Current plans call for 20
 percent of all 42,000 state industrial units to be

 the SEC's Enterprise Management Bureau, has
 stressed the importance of this work by pointing out
 that last year nearly 30 percent of state industrial
 enterprises operated at a loss, losing more than 4
 billion yuan-roughly 4 percent of state budget reve-
 nues.
 We also see lack of progress in the areas of labor
 productivity, unit costs, and energy and raw materials
 consumption. Labor productivity declined by 1.8 per-
 cent in 1981 and last year rose by 2.3 percent.
 However, the productivity data are affected by the
 severe underutilization of capacity in heavy industry
 in 1981 and by the sharp recovery in that sector in
 1982, making interpretation difficult.8 Labor produc-
 tivity in light industry, where interpretive problems
 are fewer, rose by only 1.2 percent in 1981 and
 probably did worse in 1982.
 Data on unit costs, on energy and raw materials
 consumption, and on quality convey a similar mes-
 sage. For example, costs in state industry rose by 1.2
 percent in 1981; last year they declined, but by only
 0.04 percent, far short of the targeted 1- to 2-percent
 reduction. Indexes reported by the State Statistical
 Bureau (SSB) show that in 1981 more energy and raw
 materials were being used per unit of output than in
 1980. The pattern continued in 1982. SSB data on
 quality give a similar picture: in 1981 only 39 percent
 of the indexes showed improvement, and this percent-
 age dropped to 33 in 1982.
 In general, although industrial production should
 continue to grow at what appear to be moderate-to-
 good rates during the remainder of the plan, Beijing
 will have its hands full in trying to improve the
 operating efficiency of industry. Productivity growth
 probably will continue to lag; unit costs, and energy
 and raw materials use may fall, but probably only
 slowly. Quality improvements may be more obvious
 but, given the demands of a wealthier population, may
 go unappreciated. Shifts in investment patterns and
 higher investment spending on energy and light indus-
 try-part of it in equipment that consumes less energy
 and raw materials to produce better quality goods-
 will help alleviate these problems. But we believe the
 sort of management changes that encourage more
 efficient operations are less well understood by and
 will remain more elusive to Beijing.
 Agriculture. In our opinion, the most difficult task
 facing agricultural planners during the period will be
 to achieve a crop balance better suited to industrial
 and consumer demands. Procurement price adjust-
 ments made after 1978 have been aimed at increasing
 industrial crop production, which has been achieved
 at the expense of the area sown to grain. In some cases
 the adjustments have yielded excellent results. Cotton
 production in 1982 jumped by 21 percent to 3.6
 million tons, already reaching the 1985 target (see
 table 9). Tobacco output, however, has risen too
 rapidly; Chinese estimates of 1982 production range
 as high as 1.9 million tons-600,000 tons above the
 1985 target and more than China's factories can
 absorb. The plan includes sown-acreage goals for

 grain and various industrial crops; these, coupled with
 a recent adjustment in procurement policies, should
 help bring better balance to production.
 The 1985 target for gross value of agricultural output
 appears moderately ambitious when compared with
 the historical record; but outstanding performance in
 1981-82 makes this target very conservative. The plan
 calls for 4-percent average annual growth, compared
 with 3.4 percent in 1953-80. In both 1981 and 1982,
 however, growth exceeded the 4-percent target, reach-
 ing 5.7 percent in 1981 and 11 percent in 1982. This
 means that agriculture must grow by a total of onl
 3.7 percent in 1983-85 to fulfill the planned goal.
 Prospects for achieving the plan's grain target, al-
 though always subject to the vagaries of the weather,
 are very favorable, in our judgment. Last year's   25X1
 production, at 353 million tons, was only 2 percent
 below the 1985 goal of 360 million tons. Grain
 production has continued to rise in spite of a reduced
 sown area largely because of increased incentives and
 favorable weather.
 In the wake of new agricultural policies that leave
 most production decisions to peasant households, agri-
 cultural productivity-both labor and land-has risen
 sharply during recent years. Beijing apparently ex-
 pects that further gains in labor productivity and the

 Cbina: Sixth FYP Energy Goals
 more efficient use of land and other inputs will
 continue to boost output through 1985, because pro-
 duction targets imply a rate of growth that outstrips
 the planned growth of fertilizer and other current
 inputs. The state has earmarked 14.13 billion yuan for
 agricultural investment during 1981-85, 6.1 percent
 of total capital construction.' This is a reduction of
 more than 40 percent from 1976-80. But state invest-
 ment has never been a large share of agricultural
 investment; most is funded by rural collectives them-
 selves. Now it appears that Beijing, pointing to the
 rapid growth in agricultural incomes over the past few
 years, expects an even larger share to be funded by
 individual peasants and collective units.
 Energy. We believe energy may be the weakest link in
 the plan despite its high priority in the investment
 budget. Premier Zhao, in his speech on the plan,
 suggested as much when he pointed out that the
 industrial growth target for the plan period-4 per-
 cent per year-is lower than the historical growth rate
 partly because energy output cannot be increased
 quickly. Energy output is slated to increase only 1.4
 percent per year, making it one of the slowest growing
 sectors in the economy (see table 10). Consequently,
 the plan stresses investment in new machinery that
 consumes less energy, allocating 5 billion yuan specifi-
 cally for that purpose.
 9 The 14.13 billion yuan is investment in agriculture, forestry, water
 conservancy, and meteorology. In 1981, when 2.92 billion yuan was
 allocated to these sectors, agriculture received 1.29 billion; forestry,
 0.29 billion; water conservancy, 1.31 billion; and meteorology, 0.04
 billion. This breakdown is not available for the full five years of the
 The shifting pattern of industrial growth, away from
 energy-intensive heavy industry to light industry
 where energy use is much smaller per unit of final
 output, has allowed industrial output to continue to
 increase at a 5.9-percent average annual rate in the
 first two years of the plan, despite energy supply
 growth of only 2.4 percent per year. It is difficult for
 us to tell, however, how much of the improvement in
 energy efficiency is the result of one-time adjustments
 of wasteful energy practices, or whether further con-
 servation is possible at the 3-percent annual rate
 stipulated in the plan. Because Beijing thus far has
 been unable to muster the political clout to signifi-
 cantly raise energy prices, its ability to fulfill conser-
 vation targets remains highly questionable.
 Investment in the energy sector is expected to reach
 54 billion yuan in the five-year period (excluding
 investments in technological transformation), an 11-
 percent gain over the outlay in the previous plan.
 Although not a large increase, it is significant, espe-
 cially in light of the zero growth planned in overall
 industrial investment. In addition, energy will benefit
 more than any other sector from direct foreign invest-
 ment. We anticipate that as much as $4 billion (7
 billion yuan) may be spent by foreign firms in China's
 oil and coal industries by the end of 1985.
 The investment plan implies a major shift in focus
 within the energy sector. Investment in the coal
 industry is to rise 32 percent above Fifth FYP levels

 to 17.9 billion yuan, while investment in electric
 power will decline by 5 percent to 20.7 billion yuan.
 The shift is necessary, at least for the short term,
 because of the possibility that, otherwise, new thermal
 power plants will not have coal to burn. Because
 Beijing has invested heavily in electric power during
 the recent past, capacity and output for the electric
 power industry are expected to increase by 20 percent
 by 1985, a 3.8-percent average annual increase for the
 plan period. Even with higher investment, coal output
 is targeted to rise by only 13 percent-2.5 percent per
 year. We estimate that more than 60 percent of that
 increase will be required by new power plants alone.
 Beijing hopes to export much of the remaining in-
 crease, portending a clear problem for other heavy
 users of coal, including the transportation, metals,
 chemicals, and residential/commercial sectors.
 Investment in the petroleum sector is to rise 18
 percent above the Fifth FYP total, reaching 15.5
 billion yuan. This figure includes not only the invest-
 ment costs of oil and gas exploration and development
 but some refining industry investment as well. It also
 includes substantial foreign borrowings; major proj-
 ects include the development of Bohai oilfields, for
 which China will borrow up to $2 billion from Japan's
 Ex-Im Bank, and a secondary recovery project at
 Daqing oilfield which includes a $160 million loan
 from the World Bank. The 15.5 billion yuan invest-
 ment figure does not include, however, the billions of
 dollars expected to be invested by foreign oil compa-
 nies exploring the South China Sea and the Bohai.
 Despite the increased investment, oil output is target-
 ed to remain flat through 1985, reflecting the poor
 reserve status of China's major oilfields. The plan
 calls for 35 million tons of "new" oil output capacity,
 but this clearly refers to replacement capacity-
 production from existing wells is falling at 8 million
 tons per year (8 percent of current output), a rate we
 expect to accelerate. We believe, therefore, that
 Beijing will have difficulty maintaining current out-
 put rates and by 1985 will face a decline in oil output.
 As a result, petroleum exports--currently 20 percent
 of foreign exchange earnings-may be squeezed. ~

 Transportation. In addition to energy, Beijing has
 singled out transportation and communications,for
 particular emphasis during the Sixth Plan, but both
 investment plans and performance goals appear mod-
 est to us in relation to needs (see table 11 for
 performance goals). During 1981-85 China plans to
 invest 29.8 billion yuan in transportation and commu-
 nications, mainly for railway and harbor construction.
 This is 13 percent of total capital construction. Some
 funding, probably slightly more than 5 percent, will
 come from foreign sources. About $125 million in
 World Bank funds is earmarked for the development
 of container facilities at three ports. And the Japanese
 are financing the construction of coal-related rail and
 port facilities in North China.
 Capital spending on railways is to be restored to the
 levels of 1971-75. The plan calls for 17.3 billion yuan
 in rail investment, a 23-percent increase over 1976-80,
 and a rail freight (tonnage) increase of 10.5 percent-
 2 percent per annum. During 1976-80, despite projec-
 tions of strong and growing demand for transport
 services, Beijing reduced investment in railways to 14
 billion yuan, an action which led to further deteriora-
 tion of the transportation system. As a result, rail
 freight has stagnated. After peaking in 1979, rail
 performance fell in both 1980 and 1981, and last year
 there was little growth. Official data show similar
 trends in highway and water transport.

 Much of the construction work on transportation is
 taking place in energy-rich North China where coal is
 chronically stockpiled because of lack of transport,
 and in coastal areas where heavy flows of commod-
 ities, largely for export, are congesting transport
 systems and ports. Beijing intends, by 1985, to in-
 crease the number of deepwater berths by one-third
 and provide added facilities to relieve port congestion.
 The Chinese press has reported that more than 100
 ships a day are awaiting port clearance.
 An inadequate inland transport network also limits
 the amount of cargo that can move through Chinese
 ports and is partly responsible for the congestion. A
 number of rail projects to improve this flow are
 scheduled for completion by 1985. Because China has
 no immediate plans for improving the overall highway
 network, however, rails will continue to move the bulk
 of short-haul cargoes, which usually move by truck in
 more developed countries. We believe that most of the
 increased rail capacity will be needed to accommodate
 rising domestic shipments and coal export commit-
 ments and will only marginally improve port service.
 In recent decades, with the exception of perhaps a few
 years in the early 1970s, Beijing has been reluctant to
 allocate needed investment funds to transportation
 and communications. Funding scheduled for the Sixth
 FYP, although much higher than in 1976-80, suggests
 a continuation of these shortsighted policies. The
 severity of energy problems, however, probably means
 that projects related to the movement of coal and oil
 will receive priority attention.
 Education, Science, and Technology. Beijing's grow-
 ing recognition of the importance of education, sci-
 ence, and technology is reflected throughout the Sixth
 FYP document. In the S&T portion of the plan, 38
 areas have been selected for immediate attention,
 with the most important in agriculture, food storage
 and processing, energy, transportation~communica-
 tion, health, and computers and electronics.
 State budget noninvestment expenditures for science
 and education will total 96.7 billion yuan during
 1981-85-a 68-percent increase over the 57.7 billion
 yuan appropriated in the Fifth FYP and 15.9 percent
 of budgetary expenditures compared with 11 percent
 in the previous plan.10 In addition, 9.43 billion yuan
 has been allocated for investment in science and
 education, most of which apparently will be used to
 renovate existing research and education facilities.
 These funds do not include the majority of monies
 allocated for research .and development efforts in the
 defense sector, nor do they include funds allocated for
 R&D within the various ministerial budgets
 A modest boost will be given to higher education
 during the Sixth Plan. Greatest attention will be
 focused on qualitative upgrading of the system and
 gradual expansion to accommodate future enrollment
 increases, especially at the postgraduate level. Al-
 though the bulk of funds for higher education will
 come from the overall science and education budget,
 Beijing has established a special 700 million yuan
 fund for construction of new schools and expansion of
 experimental laboratories in universities.
 The Chinese will continue to stress overseas training
 programs; an additional 15,000 officially sponsored
 students are to be sent abroad by 1985. The United
 States continues to host the largest number of Chinese
 overseas students, approximately 10,000 at the end of
 1982. Slightly less than half of these students are
 officially sponsored and funded by the Chinese Gov-
 ernment
 In spite of budget increases, we believe funding for
 science and technology remains insullicient consider-
 ing the severity and immediacy of the problems
 confronting China. Shortages of qualified S&T per-
 sonnel will continue to constrain the pace of overall
 development efforts, especially the assimilation of
 foreign technology. Although existing programs to
 rehabilitate higher education, improve the quality of
 research, and secure technology and know-how from
 abroad will yield increasing benefits, there is ample
 evidence that managerial and organizational bottle-
 necks will remain serious constraints on the S&T
 development effort. In our view, the situation will not
 appreciably improve until the 1990s, except perhaps
 in high-priority defense sector R&D programs.

 a Foreign trade targets are based on statistics compiled by the
 Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and differ from
 Chinese customs data.
 Foreign Trade. Despite world recession and the ap-
 pearance of protectionist policies in the developed
 countries, we believe China's foreign trade plans are
 extremely conservative (see table 12). The projected
 export growth rate of 8.1 percent is high by world
 standards but significantly below the 10- to 15-
 percent rates achieved by China over the past five
 years. Unlike most developing countries that have
 been hurt by declining prices for their exports of
 agricultural commodities and various raw materials,
 the share of such commodities in China's export mix
 is very low. China can produce low-cost, labor-inten-
 sive manufactures that are still in demand on the
 world market.
 Beijing's plans are most vulnerable to a falling price
 for oil-that one commodity accounts for 20 percent
 of foreign exchange earnings. Every $1 per barrel
 drop in the price of oil could cost the Chinese over
 $100 million annually in lost export revenues. Uncer-
 tainties over oil price trends-and the possibility of
 volume cuts as well-probably are largely responsible
 for Beijing's cautious export projections.
 China's import plans are not particularly venture-
 some, either, in our judgment. Although the Chinese
 project a small trade deficit when imports are meas-
 ured on a cost, insurance, and freight (c.i.f.) basis,
 trade would be essentially in balance if imports were
 measured using the more conventional free on board
 (f.o.b.) approach. Moreover, China's current account
 will continue to show a surplus. For the remainder of
 the FYP, the Chinese will emphasize imports of raw
 materials, grains, feedstocks for light industry, and
 purchases of pure technology and capital goods to
 renovate existing factories, while continuing to dis-
 courage purchases of consumer durables and new
 complete industrial plants. Lower world prices for raw
 materials and lower interest rates will enable them to
 achieve these objectives without incurring substantial
 debt. Therefore, although China will continue to
 engage in the standard practice of short-term trade
 financing and, of course, will accept any concession-
 ary financing offered, we do not expect the Chinese to
 borrow heavily in the international money markets
 during the next three years.
 National Defense. Spending on military programs
 will not be particularly burdensome during this plan.
 Defense spending has decreased slightly as a percent-
 age of national spending since the last FYP. We
 estimate that defense spending was reduced in 1981
 compared with 1979 and, on the basis of public
 pronouncements of a 6-percent rise in defense spend-
 ing, probably made a modest recovery in 1982. Chi-
 nese budget data suggest that spending will hold at
 the 1982 level through at least 1985.
 An increasing share of defense spending is being
 allocated to weapons development and procurement of
 new weapons. Progress made in recent years in trim-
 ming the size of the armed services and phasing out

 the production of outdated weapons is freeing funds
 for weapons research and the production of a new
 generation of weapons. Defense Minister Zhang Aip-
 ing, in a recent issue of the party journal, calls
 development and production of sophisticated military
 equipment the "first task" in defense modernization.
 An additional, often overlooked, source of defense
 funding is Beijing's profits from international arms
 sales. Since 1980 the Chinese reportedly have sold
 over $4 billion worth of weapons. China's defense
 industries might use some of the profits from these
 sales to modernize production facilities and procure
 arms production technology and equipment from the
 West.

 Conclusions: Political and Bureaucratic Achievement, .
 But...
 As the plan now stands, the Chinese should be able to
 fulfill most of the output targets, many with relative
 ease; but we anticipate they will encounter difficulties
 in meeting other targets where management problems
 are more complicated. To Beijing these other goals-
 energy conservation, lower costs, better quality, and
 higher productivity, among others-are more impor-
 tant than most of the output targets. This FYP and
 the next are to prepare the way for more rapid growth
 in the 1990s; and rapid growth in the 1990s, with a
 larger consumption component, implies a more effi-
 cient economy and higher labor productivity. We
 believe this explains why the leadership has set very
 modest output targets for 1985: to reduce pressures on
 rapidly.
 Close examination of the plan's efficiency goals sug-
 gests that they may be more ambitious than they first
 appear-too ambitious perhaps. To raise productivity
 and efficiency, Beijing must make substantial im-
 provements in many areas: financial and quality
 control systems, production organization, labor disci-
 pline, and raw materials consumption, to name only a
 few. But China's bureaucracies have trouble handling
 even relatively simple tasks expediently and effective-
 ly, and when it comes to complex issues they can
 hardly be expected to perform well. Considerations of
 productivity and efficiency are largely alien to
 Beijing's experience, and it is unlikely that improve-
 ments called for in the plan will come easily or
 Whatever its shortcomings, the Sixth FYP is a signal
 accomplishment for the Chinese. It is the fruition of a
 10-year attempt by moderates in the leadership to
 restore and improve economic planning and to obtain
 agreement on economic policies that realistically ad-
 dress the problems of China's economy in the 1980s.

 c.ontiuential
 The plan may be unsophisticated when compared with
 plans of other socialist countries, but we agree with
 the judgment of Chinese planning officials that it is
 China's best planning effort to date.
 Full-fledged economic reform, which Beijing sees as
 the only way to ensure long-term continuing gains in
 efficiency and technological progress, has been de-
 layed until after 1985. We attribute the delay partly
 to political considerations-ongoing party rectifica-
 tion and government reorganization campaigns-and
 partly to the lack of a coherent plan for reform.
 Nevertheless, new reform initiatives in industrial ad-
 ministration, commerce, and tax and wage systems
 were recently announced. These may have some small
 positive impact on economic performance during
 1983-85. We expect the Chinese to continue to experi-
 ment with the reforms during the remainder of the
 plan period, but the pace and impact of those reforms
 will be measured.
 Despite the existence of a plan, we see no evidence of
 firm agreement in Beijing on the particulars of eco-
 nomic policy. Since late 1978 there has emerged a
 growing leadership consensus on general economic
 objectives. That the economy is wasteful and ineptly
 managed is clear to Beijing, and everyone agrees that
 something must be done. But how best to remedy the
 situation remains a lively issue. During 1979-80, the
 enthusiasm for economic reforms created expectations
 in China that much decisionmaking would be decen-
 tralized, and some decentralization did occur. Then,
 in 1981-82, almost all nonagricultural reforms were
 put on hold. In mid-1982, Beijing decided to recen-
 tralize at least a portion of financial decision making,
 and this is reflected in the final draft of the plan. Now
 a push for economic reforms is once more apparent in
 the media, but the scope of the changes being promot-
 ed is narrow.
 These shifts back and forth are at least partly attrib-
 utable to differences within the leadership. Inevitably,
 economic policy options are seized on as ammunition
 by contending political forces. Currently in China this
 tendency is heightened by plans for government reor-
 ganization and party rectification-which will cost
 people jobs and influence.
 Against this background, we would be surprised not to
 see more shifts in economic policies and changes in
 the plan. We believe the Sixth FYP is largely a
 collection of goals and programs that reflects the
 political situation when this plan was approved last
 December-a political situation that has since altered
 and will change further. Since late 1980 the Chinese
 have often referred to the need fora "rolling plan"-a
 medium-term plan that changes as conditions re-
 quire-and it is only reasonable to expect that Beijing
 will find periodic changes necessary as economic and
 political circumstances evolve.

 Appendix A
 A Chronology of
 the Plan's Formulation
 Late in Year
 The 1976-85 10-year plan already discredited, Beijing
 began to draw up the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 April
 State Council convened a forum on long-term plans,
 during which discussants considered important eco-
 nomic problems, particularly energy; after the forum,
 the State Planning Commission (SPC) drew up an
 outline of the Sixth FYP
 July
 The SPC outline was examined successively by the
 State Council, the Party Secretariat, and the
 Politburo
 September
 The central government discovered that the 1980
 budget would be heavily in deficit
 December
 In response to the financial situation, a Central
 Committee work conference convened and decided
 that 1981 would have to be a year of fiscal austerity;
 this decision required that the Sixth FYP draft be
 revised
 February
 Premier Zhao Ziyang discussed with the SPC the
 problem of reformulating the Sixth FYP
 May
 The SPC, after more study, presented a report on a
 revised plan to the State Council
 September
 The SPC presented a draft of the revised plan to the
 State Council
 October
 The Politburo received a report on different growth
 scenarios; after much debate, the Politburo arrived at
 the agricultural and industrial growth rates now
 featured in the plan
 Spring-Summer
 The SPC summarized provincial plans and kept the
 State Council informed of the status of the plan
 July
 Deng Xiaoping directed the SPC to find a way to
 ensure that investment funds would be concentrated
 on the most important projects and that all investment
 would be coordinated; this issue arose when it became
 clear that the central government had too little funds
 under its control to ensure that critical investment
 projects were carried out
 December
 Hu Yaobang, in his 12th Party Congress address, set
 forth the general principles for the Sixth FYP
 Mid-September
 The State Council studied an SPC request for instruc-
 tions on the Sixth FYP financial situation and decided
 to recentralize investment funds
 October
 A national financial conference recentralized a por-
 tion of funds previously controlled by enterprises; this
 was the final step in working out the plan
 December
 The National People's Congress approved the plan
 June
 Senior leadership cadre traveled throughout China to
 conduct investigations and to discuss the situation
 with local leadership

 Appendix C
 Incremental Capital-Output Ratios
 Incremental capital-output ratios (ICORs) are rough,
 yet useful, measures of investment efficiency. Concep-
 tually, an ICOR indicates the increase in capital stock
 required to generate a unit increase in output. Arith-
 metically, an ICOR is the quotient: change in capital
 stock divided by change in output, both for a specified
 time period. This appendix presents data on ICORs
 for China and briefly discusses their merits and
 shortcomings.
 Calculating ICORs
 National income is the most comprehensive measure
 of output published by the Chinese. "National income
 produced" (NIP) is net value produced in five "mate-
 rial" sectors-industry, agriculture, construction,
 transportation and communications, and commerce.
 It excludes service-sector activity that does not con-
 tribute directly to material output. We use NIP to
 calculate both types of ICORs shown in table C4.
 Data on NIP are shown in tables C1 and C2.
 To calculate change in capital stock, we use net
 investment data. The Chinese publish data on "avail-
 able national income" (ANI}-the sum of NIP and
 net imports from abroad-and its components, con-
 sumption and accumulation. Accumulation is net
 investment in fixed assets and working capital. Data
 on ANI, accumulation, and consumption also are
 presented in tables Cl and C2.
 We use data on accumulation to derive the numerator
 used in calculating the total asset ICOR, as follows:
 Total asset ICOR =accumulation/change in
 NIP
 For the other ICOR presented in table C4, we use a
 measure of capital that reflects changes in fixed assets
 and ignores working capital. Ideally, since historical
 data on investment in total fixed assets are available
 (table C3), we should use similar data in our calcula-
 tions to compare the Sixth FYP ICORs with earlier
 ones. However, comparable data for the Sixth Plan
 are not available, and instead we use data on capital
 construction. Capital construction is defined as invest-
 ment in new fixed assets in the state-managed portion
 of the economy. The fixed asset ICOR is calculated as
 follows:
 Fixed asset ICOR =capital construction/NIP
 change              25X1
 ICORs Are Problematical .. .
 Use of either type of ICOR is problematical, both for
 conceptual and data reasons. First, economic growth   25X1
 is a complex function of many factors, only one of
 which is investment. The erratic movement of Chinese
 ICORs-see table C4-suggests that there is no
 steady relationship between capital investment and
 growth. Other factors include quality of management
 and quantity and quality of labor inputs, as well as
 efficiency of use of raw materials and other inputs. In
 the Chinese case, the degree of political stability
 almost certainly plays an important role in economic
 growth.
 Second, the aggregate investment numbers we use in
 the ICOR calculations hide changes in the focus of
 investment. In the Second FYP, for example, huge
 sums were spent on what the Chinese subsequently
 admitted were inefficient, small-scale factories and
 mines. Furthermore, spreading large investment sums
 too thinly over too many projects means that projects
 are completed more slowly.
 Third, capital construction is a poor proxy for fixed
 investment. Capital construction covers only the state
 sector and excludes the collective sector: the majority
 of agriculture is collectively owned, as is a small part
 of industry. A second objection to using capital
 construction as a stand-in for net fixed investment is
 that some of the spending on new assets is actually
 replacement.
 ...Yet Revealing
 These objections notwithstanding, ICORs are indica-
 tive of the past efficiency of China's investment, and
 do reveal what China expects in the current plan.
 Chinese economists, government and academic alike,
 use ICORs as a measure of overall economic efficien-
 cy.
