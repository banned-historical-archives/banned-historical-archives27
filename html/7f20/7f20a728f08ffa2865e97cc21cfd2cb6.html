CHINA: No Public Announcement Yet 
A Chinese official has confirmed to Western newsmen 
that Hua Kuo-feng has been elevated to the posts of chairman 
of the party and of the military affairs commission, but there 
has been no public announcement of the move. There has also 
been no statement on the reported arrest of the four "leftist" 
members of the Politburo. 
The four are Chiang Ching, Mao's widow; party vice 
chairman Wang Hung-wen; fourth-ranked party leader Chang Chun-
chiao; and party propagandist Yao Wen-yuan. An official's re-
sponse of "no comment" to journalists' questions on the matter 
is tantamount to acknowledgment that the arrests have occurred. 
Announcements on these and other subjects are likely to be made 
only at the conclusion of the Central Committee plenum which is 
apparently now in session. 
One Western news report, citing "sources close to the 
Chinese government" says that over 30 persons have been arrested 
including Mao's nephew, Mao Yuan-hsin, who apparently acted as 
head of Mao's personal secretariat in the final days of the 
chairman's life. This report claims that those arrested have 
been charged with "forging" Mao's will. There is no direct evi-
dence supporting this claim, but it seems plausible. 
//Several Western embassies in Peking have heard 
that one of the charges against the leftists is that they "dis-
torted" Mao's writings and had concocted a slogan, "act accord-
ing to the instructions laid down," which has been widely used 
in Chinese propaganda since Mao's death.// 
The Central Committee is probably reviewing the 
charges against the leftists. The leading leftists are widely 
and deeply disliked, and if the record of the past ten years 
is reviewed, as seems likely, the list of "crimes" is certain 
to be a long one. 
The plenum may also be considering the case of Li 
Te-sheng, the one regional military commander who has unequivo-
cally espoused leftist positions since the fall of Teng Hsiao-
ping. Li, a member of the Politburo, appears to be in serious 
trouble, but he commands troops and his "case" is probably a 
delicate one.

TZ11'-SECRET  
The plenum is likely also to be considering the ap-
pointment of a reconstituted Politburo, depleted by the deaths 
of five members as well as by  the recent purge and the earlier 
dismissal of Teng Hsiao-ping. 
LEBANON: Situation Report 
Syrian forces based in Jazzin launched a two-pronged 
attack on Palestinian positions early yesterday in what appears 
to be the first phase of their offensive in southern Lebanon. 
The attacks--which came only hours after Arab League mediator 
Hasan Sabri al-Khuli announced that Palestinian and Syrian rep-
resentatives had reached a new tentative cease-fire agreement--
will seriously damage the credibility of President Sarkis, who 
had been primarily responsible for convening the settlement 
talks. 
Syrian tanks and infantry have already moved from 
Jazzin and have entered Rum, the Palestinians' regional head-
quarters and a major stronghold on the road to the Palestinian-
held port of Sidon. A Western journalist in the area reported 
late yesterday that most of the defenders of Rum had begun re-
treating and that Syrian forces were continuing to move west 
along the main road to the coast. 
Syrian troops reportedly have also moved south 
to Hatura in what appears to be a drive toward the Palestinian 
redoubt at Nabatiyah. 
Although Christian forces south of Marl Uyun have 
been shelling Palestinian positions since last week, there is 
no evidence yet that the Christians have assumed a major role  
in the renewed offensive.

Palestinian leaders believe Syria is determined to seek a mil-
itary solution in the absence of a complete Palestinian capitu-
lation. Yasir Arafat and other moderate Palestinians reportedly 
feel they submitted their "final" position during recent nego-
tiations at Shaturah and that any further compromises would de-
stroy the independence and the present leadership of the PLO.// 
 Palestinian leaders have little confidence they can hold 
their positions near the major coastal cities of Sidon, Tyre, 
and Beirut, and that they are resigned to the fall of their po-
sitions in Tripoli if the Syrians and Christians press their 
advantage there.//

ian leaders concede that they could not hold out against a pro- (b)(3) 
longed Syrian blockade of Beirut and Sidon, but are hoping that 
under such circumstances they would be rescued by international 
intervention.// 
The Palestinians issued an urgent request yesterday 
for an emergency meeting of the Arab League foreign ministers 
and will presumably follow up with direct appeals to the Egyp-
tians and Soviets for help. Arab League mediator al-Khuli left 
Lebanon for Damascus yesterday, probably on his way to Cairo. 
Syria's actions have thoroughly discredited the 
League's mediation effort and could scuttle plans for a summit 
meeting now scheduled for October 18. The resumption of the 
Syrian offensive suggests that Sarkis and al-Khuli were misled, 
perhaps intentionally, by Syrian representatives to the negotia-
tions over the weekend. Few Lebanese are likely to accept sug-
gestions in the Syrian media that Syria's actions were taken 
in response to the weekend Palestinian attacks on several of  
Syria's embassies.

USSR: Gribkov Appointment 
The Soviet news agency Tass announced yesterday that (b)(3) 
Colonel General Anatoly Gribkov has been appointed First Deputy 
Commander in Chief and Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Pact forces, 
filling the position left vacant by the death of Army General 
Shtemenko last April. Judging from past experience, Gribkov 
will also serve as a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff 
of the Soviet Armed Forces. 
//The delay in naming a replacement for Shte-
menko suggests the Soviets had some difficulty finding an of-
ficer with the proper  military qualifications who was also DO-
litically acceptable. 
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
The recent "Shield-76" exercise in Poland may have 
given Soviet Defense Minister Ustinov an opportunity to discuss 
the issue with his East European counterparts and perhaps set-
tle Gribkov's nomination. 
During World War II Gribkov served as a major in the 
corps of the General Staff officers who were sent to field 
units as representatives of the General Staff. In 1967, he was 
elected to the Supreme Soviet of Armenia. Since 1973, Gribkov 
has commanded the key Leningrad Military District, and in June, 
he directed the much publicized exercise "Sever"--the second 
Soviet exercise announced in compliance with the Helsinki ac-
cords. 
During the 25th Party Congress earlier this year the 
57-year-old Gribkov was elected a candidate member of the Cen-
tral Committee.

CUBA: Anti-US Propaganda 
'/Cuba apparently intends to mount a major propa-
ganda attack on the US over the crash of a Cuban airliner last 
week.// 
Cuban media have highlighted a Miami-based exile or-
ganization's claim that it was responsible for the crash. The 
Cubans allege that the US has given explosives and other aid to 
counterrevolutionary organizations to attack Cuban personnel 
and installations. 
Cuban Prime Minister Castro may take the opportunity 
of a mass rally in Havana today to accuse the US of direct in-
volvement in exile attacks. In the past several months, Castro 
has threatened to renounce the 1973 US-Cuba Memorandum of Under-
standina on hijacking and to respond in kind to terrorist ac-
tions. 
EGYPT: Financial Crisis

 //Egypt is trying to muster an additional $1 bil-
balance-of-payments support to prevent a substantial 
in imports and consumption in the coming months.// 
 //Last year Arab cash aid covered about two thirds 
of Egypt's $3 billion external financial gap. Only about $1 bil-
lion in Arab aid has been disbursed so far this year, and unless 
more cash aid is received over the next two months Egypt may be 
forced to cut back drastically on imports of food, consumer 
durable goods, and industrial inputs.// 
//Egypt has postponed payment on many of its for-
eign debts to free cash for needed imports. Last month, debt 
service arrears totaled $700 million--equivalent to 70 percent 
of the balance-of-payments financing that Cairo is still seek-
ing for 1976.// 
 //During the last several years Egypt's creditors 
have tolerated periodic delays in repayment on the assumption 
that Arab aid would be forthcoming. Now, with both Saudi Arabia

edly are reluctant to refinance even small, $1 to $10 million 
180-day credits.// 
//The newly established Gulf Organization for De-
velopment in Egypt may provide half the sum that is needed this 
year. The organization probably will guarantee $250 million in 
Western bank loans and has offered an additional $250 million 
in direct balance-of-payments support, although negotiations 
have bogged down.// 
 //Egypt also hopes Iran will provide $250 million 
in loan guarantees. If all these funds materialize, the remain-
ing shortfall could be financed with a rollover of short-term 
debt or continued deferment of repayments.// 
 //Egypt's balance-of-payments problems will con-
tinue into 1977 even if it obtains the credits it is seeking. 
Population growth and investment under the five-year plan prob-
ably will inflate imports, and exports will be hampered by ca-
pacity constraints and Israeli harassment of  offshore develop-
ment. 
EC-IRAN: Negotiations Back on Track 
//French President Giscard's visit to Iran this

and Iran on a nonpreferential trade agreement. Giscard had ob-
jected to the EC Commission's proposals and refused to go along 
with resumption of the stalemated talks until he had discussed 
the issue personally with the Shah.// 
 //The Shah, taking advantage of his country's 
enhanced political and economic importance, had been seeking 
broad trade preferences similar to those the EC has granted to 
most Mediterranean countries. He may now be willing to settle 
for the more modest relationship the EC Commission has proposed, 
which is modeled on the EC-Canada cooperation agreement that 
came into force last week.//

 //Although the Commission now seems to have the 
general support of the Nine for its proposals, there are some 
outstanding difficulties. Some members--Italy and the Nether-
lands for example--are apprehensive that increased imports of 
refined petroleum products from Iran would further aggravate 
their present problem of excess refinery capacity. Others point 
to Iran's potentially high degree of competitiveness in some 
industrial sectors.// 
/Some members are also concerned that the use 
at the Community's generalized system of preferences for Iran 
would dilute benefits going to the poorer developing states, 
and may constitute a misuse of the system by undermining the 
EC's flexibility to determine what preferences will be offered 
on a year-by-year basis.// 
 //Despite these problems, the Commission will 
probably get a green light to open negotiations before the end 
of the year. The talks could be protracted, particularly if the 
Shah continues to insist on special treatment for such products 
as petrochemicals, metals, shoes, and textiles. The Community 
is currently in no position, either economically or politically 
to permit easier access for such highly competitive goods. 
ITALY: Austerity Measures 
 /The austerity measures announced by Italian 
Prime Minister Andreotti on Friday probably will not have a 
significant impact on inflation--currently running at an annual 
rate of 17 percent. The government apparently believed, how-
ever, that stronger measures would have less chance of accep-
tance by the labor unions and by the Communist Party, whose 
cooperation in Parliament is essential. A temporary program 
was instituted on October 1 to brake the plunge of the lira 
and shore up business confidence.// 
Most of the measures were discussed extensively in 
the press prior to the cabinet meeting last Friday, but some 
of the measures, including a tax that will raise the price of 
gasoline by 25 percent, came as a surprise.

cost-of-living wage increases for upper income workers. Middle-
income salary earners will have half of their cost-of-living 
adjustments frozen.// 
 //This move will do little to slow the rise in 
labor costs, however, since it will only affect about 25 per-
cent of the work force. Industrial wages probably will rise 
more than 20 percent this year mainly because they are linked 
to the consumer price index.//

The Communist-dominated labor union is officially 
supporting most aspects of the program, with the notable excep-
tion of the proposed gasoline price increase. The Communists 
normally exercise predominant influence in the labor movement, 
but in this instance they are having trouble convincing their 
own rank and file and some of the non-Communist unions to go 
along. 
Rank-and-file discontent with the austerity measures 
has produced wildcat strikes in cities such as Turin, Bologna, 
and Milan and a call by militant metalworkers for a general 
strike. In response, Communist officials have been dispatched 
to key industrial centers to explain the necessity for auster-
ity measures and the reasons behind the substantial Communist 
support for the program. 
Nevertheless, the federation that represents all of 
Italy's major unions may be forced against Communist wishes to 
call a general strike in order to placate work 7r discontent.

BRAZIL-CHILE: Military Relations 
The recent official visit of Brazilian Army Minister 
Frota to Chile reaffirmed the countries' traditionally close 
ties and may have laid the groundwork for an expansion of 
Brazil's military assistance and sales program. 
Frota went to Santiago on the occasion of the 166th 
anniversary of Chilean independence, but there is good reason 
to believe that his private discussions with Chilean officials 
focused on an increase in the sale of Brazilian arms and mili-
tary equipment to Chile. The Bank of Brazil last month report-
edly approved a new $40-million credit to Chile for military 
purchases. 
Such arrangements are attractive to both coun-
tries for economic and strategic reasons. Brazil is trying to 
ease its balance-of-payments problems by promoting exports and 
is especially interested in establishing its fledgling armaments 
industry on a firm footing. Chile is aggressively seeking new 
foreign sources of arms now that US military assistance has  
ended. 
A member of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has told 
US embassy officials that Brazil prefers to restrict high-level 
exchanges with Chile to military channels, and, for the sake of 
international appearances, politely to stall on Chilean over-
tures for an exchange of presidential visits.

SOUTH KOREA: Strong Economic Recovery 
South Korea's export-led recovery is surpassing all 
earlier forecasts. Paced by a two-thirds rise in exports, real 
gross national product grew 17.4 percent in the first half of 
the year. Government officials now project a 14 percent growth 
in GNP for 1976, up from earlier estimates of 9 percent. 
(b)(3) 
South Korean exports have taken advantage of the con- (b)(3) 
sumer-led recovery in the US and have successfully penetrated 
the lucrative Middle East market. Import growth, has been more 
moderate, partly due to prospects for a bumper grain harvest 
and Seoul's effective energy conservation program. As a result, 
South Korea's current-account deficit probably will fall to 
about $0.5 billion this year from $2 billion in both 1974 and 
1975. 
The pace of the recovery, while remaining brisk, is (b)(3) 
likely to slow somewhat during the remainder of the year. New 
export orders have already begun to slow. Trade barriers in 
importing countries and the recent weakening in the US economy 
also will moderate export growth. (b)(3)
