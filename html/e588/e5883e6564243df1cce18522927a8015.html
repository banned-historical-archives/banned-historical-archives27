 FAR EAST
 Cambodia:  The War in the West
 Significant Communist military activity con-
 tinues to be concentrated in a number of prov-
 inces in the western half of the country. Enemy
 attacks and ambushes along Route 4 in Kampot
 and Koh Kong provinces have thwarted a two-
 pronged Cambodian Army operation aimed at
 reopening that highway, and increased Commu-
 nist military pressure has also been reported in
 Battambang and Oddar Meanchey provinces.
 The long-delayed government push to clear
 Route 4 and re-establish Phnom Penh's overland
 access to the seaport of Kompong Som bogged
 down quickly when the Communists routed three
 Cambodian battalions north of Veal Renh. These
 forces were moving to link up with three other
 nearby battalions in order to sweep east along
 Route 4 toward the enemy-held Pich Nil pass. Six
 additional  Cambodian  battalions  are  headed
 southwest along the highway toward the pass
 from the Sre Khlong area. This latter force ad-
 vanced unopposed to within ten miles of the pass
 before they stopped, apparently because the gov-
 ernment battalions southwest of Pich Nil had
 been halted by Communist action.
 The reopening of Route 4 may ultimately
 depend on the intervention of South Vietnamese
 Army (ARVN) troops, which Phnom Penh has
 already requested. The odds for a positive re-
 sponse from Saigon may be enhanced by the
 failure of the latest Cambodian effort, and by
 South Vietnamese concern over the serious eco-
 nomic consequences facing Phnom Penh as a re-
 sult of the highway's closure.
 The pressure was increased on Phnom Penh's
 life lines by a Communist attack which turned
 back a Mekong River convoy carrying gasoline
 from Saigon to Phnom  Penh. Two barges, a
 tanker, and a tugboat were sunk and several Cam-
 bodian sailors were killed in three attacks on the
 convoy near Neak Luong. This is the most serious
 incident on the Mekong since the fighting began.
 In  Battambang, enemy elements recently
 captured a village and a bridge on Route 5, less
 than ten miles south of the crossroads town of
 Sisophon. This marked the first time the Commu-
 nists have cut the western land access to Battam-
 bang city, the country's second lay lest urban

 push toward Samrong began several weeks ago
 when a small government garrison was overrun at
 Anlong Veng on Route 69. As the Communists
 moved west along the road they subsequently
 captured several other lightly defended govern-
 ment positions. The threat of Thai intervention
 may preclude a Communist effort to take Sam-
 rong, however. Oddar Meanchey is impoverished
 in both population and resources, and its loss
 would not be a major setback to the govern-
 ment-which already has virtually written it off.
 On the political side, the regime appears to
 have made one of its rare domestic missteps when
 it instituted press censorship. Predictably, this
 move provoked a flurry of criticism by several of
 Phnom Penh's newspapers. Two of the capital's
 six dailies have been shut down for failing to
 comply with the decree, and three others have in
 turn  suspended  publication  to  protest  the
 closures.
 Some democratic-minded youths and intel-
 lectuals are likely to view the imposition of even a
 limited form of censorship as a step back toward
 Sihanouk's dictatorial ways. Additionally, the
 issue has evidently reinforced their belief that
 Lon Nol is increasingly the victim of bad advice
 from his close associates.

 ately preceding the Christmas holiday, but still

 increased terrorism and harassment.

 two leading contenders, President Thieu and Gen-
 eral Duong Van Minh, will easily command suf-
 ficient backing, but any dark horse would be hard
 pressed to find the required 40 assembly or 100
 provincial council sponsors.
 The bill has Thieu's backing and may reflect
 his belief that he can utilize the government bu-
 reaucracy to his advantage. Many National As-
 semblymen, because they will be forced to com-
 mit themselves to a candidate before their own
 re-election campaigns, may hesitate to risk the
 loss of government support by opposing Thieu. A
 number of opposition assemblymen have criti-
 cized the bill, however, and the Senate may at-
 tempt to modify it. Even the Saigon Post-usually
 sympathetic to the government-has taken an edi-
 torial stand against it. The Post points out that an
 "outsider" not blessed by those already in office
 would be virtually excluded from legal political
 competition.
 Thieu's support of the bill could backfire
 against him. As a candidate for re-election, he
 might be expected to try to divide and conquer
 the opposition, relying on the power of his office
 and government machinery to marshal sufficient
 support to beat a divided opposition. This bill,
 however, will tend to limit the number of candi-
 dates who may run against him, and it could
 actually serve to unite the great majority of oppo-
 sition elements behind a single opposition candi-
 date, such as Big Minh, thereby hurting Thieu's
 chances.

 Communist China: Putting Together the Party Puzzle
 Despite a host of unresolved problems, Pe-
 king apparently is trying again to force the pace
 of its prolonged campaign to reconstruct the shat-
 tered  Communist  Party  apparatus.  Late  last
 month, the regime approved in rapid succession
 the formation of four provincial party commit-
 tees-the most important party organs to be es-
 tablished since the central committee was recon-
 stituted at the Ninth Party Congress in April
 1969. Since the congress, considerable attention
 has been devoted to rebuilding the party from the
 lowest administrative units upward. Peking, how-
 ever, evidently has grown impatient with the un-
 even progress of this politically troublesome task
 and seems anxious to demonstrate more visible
 results in advance of the party's 50th anniversary
 this summer. The process could be considerably
 shortened because it appears that in all but a few
 long-troubled areas, the incumbent provincial gov-
 ernment leaders will simply be confirmed as the
 local party chiefs.
 Predictably, the top positions in the first
 four  provincial  party  committees-in  Hunan,
 Kwangtung, Kiangsu, and Kiangsi Provinces-are
 heavily staffed by military officers supplemented
 by veteran civilian party officials. Few, if any,
 leading posts appear to be held by militant young
 activists-the "fresh blood" Mao Tse-tung had
 ordered to be infused into the party structure
 following the Cultural Revolution. The current
 trend toward militarization of the party apparatus
 is likely to hold true as the provincial level re-
 building process unfolds elsewhere. Local media
 in recent months, for example, have increasingly
 been identifying military officers as ranking mem-
 bers  of the  so-called  provincial  party  core
 groups-the precursors of the remaining party
 committees that eventually are to be formed.
 This by no means forecasts a near exclusion
 of civilians from important secretarial posts. Nev-
 ertheless, in contrast to much of the pre - Cultural
 Revolution period, when the civilian provincial
 party hierarchy formed interlocking directorates
 controlling  corresponding  government,  armed
 forces, and mass organization units, the pivotal
 overseer roles will now be played to a greater
 degree by army men. Such convergent lines of
 authority, for example, are symbolized in the case
 of politburo member Hsu Shih-yu, who now has
 added the post of Kiangsu party first secretary to
 his existing roles as head of the provincial govern-
 ment and commander of a major military region.
 Although Peking's latest party building drive
 may speed up the tempo, its end result is still
 likely to be largely a cosmetic exercise having
 little immediate impact on the myriad political
 problems that have been hampering effective local
 administration. There has been ample evidence at
 the lower levels, for example, that the mere estab-
 lishment of party committees does not guarantee
 the ability of party officials to consolidate their
 authority. Moreover, military dominance in itself
 is not a panacea for political disputes. The con-
 flicts and tensions both among and between army
 and civilian cadres that have pervaded so many
 administrative units are likely to be carried over
 into the party arena as well. Finally, Peking's
 persistent admonitions to senior cadre to follow
 Mao's revolutionary line "still better" attest not
 only to nagging frustration with the performance
 of many ranking civil and military authorities, but
 also to the serious limitations on the regime's
 ability to affect the actions of local officials who
 regard the party building process as an opportun-
 ity to compete for additional power and influ-

 Communist China Brings in a Record Grain Crop
 Peking's claim that the 1970 grain harvest
 "exceeded all previous records" is plausible. Since
 the mid-1960s, China has been reaping the payoff
 from a combination of gradual but steadily in-
 creasing injections of modern inputs to agricul-
 ture and a backtracking from extreme collective
 measures which had dampened peasant incentives.
 By 1964, grain output had recovered from the
 disaster years following the collapse of the Great
 Leap Forward of 1959-61, and generally has been
 on an upward trend since. The 1970 grain harvest
 appears to be on the order of 215-220 million
 tons compared with the previous high in 1967 of
 210-215 million tons.
 The agricultural successes of recent years
 have eased Peking's immediate economic pres-
 sures. Total food production has probably been at
 least commensurate with population growth for
 several years. The good harvests of recent years
 have also, by Peking's own statements, enabled
 the state, the provinces, and the communes to
 build up food stocks.
 Chinese leaders apparently intend to con-
 tinue pragmatic agricultural policies. During the
 fourth five-year period (1971-75), incentives will
 evidently still be centered on private plots-which
 the new 1970 state constitution legitimizes-and
 on payment according to work performed. Agri-
 cultural investment will continue to emphasize
 irrigation and chemical fertilizers, the two most
 beneficial measures applied so far. In addition,
 the regime hopes that the recently revamped rural
 educational structure will turn out peasants who
 are better able to use technology becoming
 available.
 Nevertheless, Chinese agriculture still re-
 quires support from abroad. The Chinese show no
 signs of changing the policy decision made in the
 late 1960s to rely on imported chemical fertilizers
 instead  of expanding domestic production by
 constructing large, modern plants. More than half
 of the three million tons of chemical fertilizer
 measured by nutrient content used in 1970 came
 from Western Europe and Japan.
 The necessity to import grain may be dimin-
 ishing, however. For some years, domestic food
 production has appeared to be adequate for cur-
 rent needs, but the Chinese maintained imports at
 some five million tons annually. By earmarking
 most of this amount to coastal provinces with
 grain deficits, internal transport movements were
 reduced. Some of the grain might have gone to
 augmenting stocks. Peking now claims that some
 of the northern provinces became self sufficient
 in grain during 1970, even though it is not yet
 certain that this state can be maintained if
 weather in subsequent years deteriorates.
 South Korea: President Pak Is Taking No Chances
 Responding to the unexpectedly energetic
 challenge being mounted by his major opponent
 in the presidential election this spring, President

 for a hard-hitting campaign of his own. Following
 on the mid-December cabinet shake-up, Pak late
 last  month  overhauled  the leadership of his
 Democratic Republican Party to bring in unques-
 tioned-if somewhat controversial-talent.
 In a move to harness this talent and yet
 maintain balance among competing factions, Pak
 as party president created a triumvirate of special
 advisers. Prominent in this new lineup is Kim
 Chong-pil, Pak's former number-two man, whose
 ill-concealed ambitions for the presidency in 1969
 led to a temporary cooling between the two. The
 other members of the trio of advisers are Yun

 Chong-pil faction, and Chong II-kwon, the previ-
 ous premier and a well-liked neutral.
 To box in Kim Chong-pil even more, Pak
 chose for most of the other party posts men
 considered unsympathetic toward Kim. The lat-
 ter, although obviously displeased with these ar-
 rangements, apparently is resigned to working
 within the system while keeping a calculating eye
 on the future.
 Rounding out the Democratic Republican
 Party's refurbished apparatus for the election, a
 new 15-man Party Affairs Committee has been
 formed, whose members are responsible for bring-
 ing in the vote in individual provinces or special
 city areas. As in the case of recent cabinet ap-
 pointments, careful attention to the relative polit-
 ical strengths of the various regions is reflected in
 the makeup of this important committee.
 Evident in all the recent administrative shifts
 made by President Pak is an overriding considera-
 tion for fashioning a high-powered election team,
 even at the expense of possible liabilities. A major
 case in point is the naming last month of Yi
 Hu-rak  as  director  of  the  ubiquitous South
 Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Yi, Pak's
 long-time confidant and former private secretary,
 had been eased into an ambassadorial post about
 a year ago as part of an effort by the President to
 convince a generally skeptical public that he was
 serious about rooting out corruption in govern-
 ment. At this juncture, however, Pak apparently
 has decided that Yi's political talents outweigh his
 bad public image. It seems abundantly clear that
 despite his own good record and all the ad-
 vantages of the government apparatus, President
 Pak intends to take no chances of being upset by

 EUROPE
 USSR - Communist China: Familiar Themes at Year's End
 The renewal of Sino-Soviet polemics, cou-
 pled with the collapse on 19 December of the river
 navigation talks, put the recent signs of improve-
 ment in state-to-state relations in perspective and
 demonstrate that, despite these signs, there has
 been little real progress in resolving the more
 intractable problems that divide the USSR and
 China. The polemical exchange, which was the
 first full-dress one since the war of words over the
 West German treaty last fall, centered on alleged
 Soviet intervention in the recent Polish crisis.
 Moscow's  original  announcement on the
 ending of the navigation talks had sought to
 imply that some kind of agreement had been
 reached. Peking, however, flatly denied this a few
 the talks had failed to
 make progress because the two sides approached
 them in a fundamentally different manner. Ac-
 cording to the Soviets, the Chinese proposed a
 series of navigation "formulas" that would have
 undermined Moscow's position in the broader
 political talks in Peking. One of these "formulas"
 almost certainly included insistence on the main
 navigation channel  as the  river boundaries, a
 principle disputed by the USSR despite its general
 acceptance in international law.
 The Soviets have hinted that these develop-
 ments may delay the return to Peking of Ambas-

 New Soviet Push on European Security
 Moscow closed out the year by moving with
 a flurry of diplomatic demarches and public state-
 ments to revive its long-stymied project for a
 conference on European security (CES). Washing-
 ton and other NATO capitals were the recipients
 of Soviet demarches-formally in reply to the
 December  NATO ministerial communique-
 during the week of 28 December. On 2 January,
 Premier Kosygin publicly joined in with an appeal
 for quick progress toward a CES in an interview
 with Japanese newsmen.
 The moves put an end to a long period of
 relative inactivity on the subject of CES. Moscow
 had launched no initiatives of its own since last
 June,  when  it  co-sponsored  a  Warsaw  Pact
 memorandum that expanded the proposed agenda
 for a CES to include the creation of a permanent
 body to deal with European security matters,
 including-so it was hinted-talks on mutual bal-
 anced                     force reductions  (MBFR). The Soviets
 doubtless had a hand, however, in the formula-
 tion of a Finnish proposal made late in November
 to move to the stage of multilateral preparations
 for a CES by convening a meeting in Helsinki.
 The USSR promptly endorsed the Finnish pro-
 posal, and Moscow's recent demarches included
 attempts to get movement on it.
 The new round of Soviet statements also was
 aimed at countering Western efforts to link fur-
 ther movement on CES to progress in other areas.
 The demarche delivered to the US last week took
 particular exception to the "linkage" the De-
 cember NATO ministerial established between a
 Berlin settlement and progress toward a CES,
 charging that this is meant only to impede move-
 ment toward a conference. It held that progress in
 the Berlin talks is now dependent on a change in
 the Western position, and insisted that an "answer
 is due" to the proposals submitted by the Soviets
 at the last four-power meeting. It took general
 exception to attempts to tie a CES to other
 negotiations.
 A significant aspect of the Soviet approach
 to European security has been an effort to differ-
 entiate between the US and the West Europeans.
 In the note to Washington, Moscow openly
 charged the US with using the Berlin talks to
 "complicate" movement toward a CES and with
 attempts to "impede the process of improvement
 of the political situation" in Europe. The same
 charge in the past has been made privately and
 frequently in Bonn and other European capitals,
 and presumably will continue to be made for
 political effect. It may reflect a degree of genuine
 concern that Washington regards a CES and other
 East-West negotiations in Europe as a threat to its
 political interests on the continent, and conse-
 quently will try to torpedo them. Moscow's inter-
 est in these negotiations is at least in part based
 on the hope that they will precipitate a reduction
 of the US role and influence in Europe.
 Apparently  the same basic themes were
 sounded in the demarches made to other. NATO
 powers. I n another recent approach to the West
 Germans, however, the Soviets strongly criticized
 the European Communities (EC), claiming that
 Bonn's support for an alleged "third bloc" in
 Europe was incompatible with its Ostpolitik. The
 charge underscores Soviet concern about the EC
 and Moscow's hope that a CES can be used to
 slow West European integration.
 The Allies are not likely to break ranks
 openly because of the renewed Soviet pressures
 for a CES this soon after the NATO ministerial.
 Bonn, for example, now seems anxious to secure
 as many gains as possible before embarking on a
 CES.

 Brezhnev Usurps Collective New Year's Greetings
 Party leader Brezhnev, by his greeting to the
 Soviet people on New Year's Eve, executed a
 brazen publicity coup in capturing this tradi-
 tionally collective platform. Although he has not
 silenced other leaders nor apparently mastered
 the policy debates among them, Brezhnev's latest
 success in advancing his public role indicates
 growing strength as the March party congress ap-
 proaches.
 In the past, even under Khrushchev, the New
 Year's greeting consisted of an impersonal mes-
 sage signed by the party central committee, the
 Supreme Soviet, and the Council of Ministers, and
 read over the air by an announcer. This year
 Brezhnev read the greetings on radio and televi-
 sion, and his picture accompanied their publica-
 tion in the press. Although the message remained
 a short pro forma affair, Pravda has cited this
 "Brezhnev speech" in editorial comment and has
 reported foreign and domestic reaction to it.
 During the past year  Brezhnev has as-
 siduously exploited his position to heighten his
 public prominence. For this he has found many
 appropriate occasions: the Lenin centenary cele-
 bration, republic anniversaries, and travels about
 the country. His New Year's effort, in its break
 with precedent, matches his address in June to
 the Council of Ministers, a body with which he
 has no official standing.
 Other leaders, especially in recent months,
 have also sought public exposure. Indeed, Bre-
 zhnev shared attention at the turn of the year
 with Premier Kosygin, whose interview with a
 Japanese newspaper on 1 January was reported
 by the Soviet domestic radio and press. In grant-
 ing the interview, however, the premier followed
 a customary, although not invariable, practice.
 Kosygin stuck close to established official
 positions in his comments on world affairs to the
 Japanese paper. The interview did provide an oc-
 casion for him to reaffirm Soviet support for
 SALT, which was reported by the domestic news
 media. On the other hand, the very limited in-
 formation he offered to the Japanese on the next
 five-year plan was largely expunged from Soviet
 domestic reports.
 This and other signs suggest that on basic
 issues, such as the five-year plan which must be
 adopted by the party congress, no one leader or
 group of leaders has yet been able to work its
 will. Continued politicking is betrayed by unusual
 inconsistency in references to the record grain
 and cotton harvests of last year and the propa-
 ganda-unsupported by official plans-on the sub-

 Czechoslovakia: Stage Set For Economic Changes
 The Husak regime last week, in an important
 step toward bringing the economy under control,
 transferred to the federal government much of
 the economic authority granted by Alexander
 Dubcek to the regional Czech and Slovak admin-
 istrations.  The new system  probably will  be
 modified in the course of the next five-year plan,
 but for now it provides the regime with the in-
 stitutional basis for formulating its own economic
 reforms.
 One of the regime's most important goals is
 the more efficient use of the country's critical
 resources. Two new federal ministries-the Min-
 istry for Fuels and Power and the Ministry for
 Metallurgy and Engineering-were established, re-
 placing similar regional organizations. Existing
 federal "committees," including those for indus-
 try, transportation, and investment, were restruc-
 tured into federal ministries with added powers.
 The committees were orginally designed to give
 the Slovaks parity with the Czechs in economic
 matters. A Federal Office for Prices was estab-
 lished to unify financial and budgetary planning,
 and a central People's Control Commission set up
 to investigate local management practices.
 Although these changes clear an important
 bureaucratic hurdle, government leaders are still
 having major difficulties drawing up specific eco-
 nomic programs. In his speech to a party central
 committee plenum last month, Premier Strougal
 indicated that the long-awaited five-year plan
 would not be completed before next spring. In
 spite of his efforts to dress up the economic
 achievements during  his government's tenure,
 Strougal indicated that major problems still exist,
 notably in the areas of investment planning, labor
 allocation and foreign trade. Recurring warnings
 by Strougal and other regime spokesmen of
 lingering "revisionism" suggest that today's eco-
 nomic planners are having trouble integrating into
 their own programs usable portions of the dis-
 carded reforms proposed under Dubcek. Their
 difficulties appear to be largely political, however,
 rather than economic.
 The political consequences of the govern-
 ment reorganization could well cause additional
 problems in economic planning. The Slovaks, who
 achieved economic and political autonomy in
 1968, are not likely to be pleased or taken in by
 government assurances that the federal principle
 remains "unchanged." Nor is the regime's effort
 to soften the blow by including Slovak admin-
 istrators in the new federal bodies likely to al-
 leviate Slovak fears of being resubordinated to
 Prague. The fact that regional security organs
 were brought under federal control at the same
 time as the economic bodies suggests that the
 regime intends to  intimidate potentially dis-
 gruntled economic administrators into coop-
 erating without question.

 level. The overwhelming majority of delegates,
 however, refused to support the measure, labeling
 it  "repressive" and  "incompatible" with self-
 management. The FEC hastily withdrew its pro-
 posal, substituting instead a bill which would
 limit income growth only through April 1971.
 This was passed.
 The wage limitation is described by Premier
 Ribicic as the "last restrictive law" of the eco-
 nomic stabilization program and is timed to ex-
 pire when each republic's law on income distribu-
 tion comes into effect next spring. Low income
 groups are exempted from the restriction.
 An 11 percent growth limitation over four
 months is not restrictive. The measure, however,
 is important because it suggests that the govern-
 ment finally may be listening to the advice of
 economists who long have stressed the strong
 impact of wage increases on inflation.
 The wage limitation aroused the rare wrath
 of the trade union delegates in parliament. The
 unions throughout 1970 had sought to dispel the
 impression that they are "transmission belts" for
 party policy, and for some time have been press-
 ing for better living conditions and higher wages
 for workers. Consequently, the Yugoslav Con-
 federation of Trade Unions wasted little time in
 defending the workers and denouncing the wage
 restriction. During the debate in the economic
 chamber, trade union secretary Marijan Rozic
 personally and vigorously argued against the bill
 as originally proposed.
 The "wage freeze" represents a reversal of
 previously announced government policy. Earlier,
 the regime emphatically denied wage controls
 were under consideration. Moreover, a second
 policy shift also may be in the offing; recent
 statements by both President Tito and Premier
 Ribicic indicate that devaluation of the dinar will
 take place in 1971. The key question is timing.
 The assembly action undoubtedly was in
 part a reaction to the recent workers' riots in
 Poland. It also was the second time in the last two
 months that the Yugoslav parliament seemed to
 be acting  in an  independent and unexpected
 fashion. (In an unparalleled move in mid-Novem-
 ber, a vice premier resigned in a policy fight about
 proposed devaluation of the dinar.) Such un-
 orthodox activity in Communist Yugoslavia is
 apparently just the beginning of the political
 fireworks expected between now and.next spring

 Finland: Government Crisis Ended
 SECRET
 A month-long government crisis ended on
 the eve of the new year when the Communists
 allowed key parts of President Kekkonen's eco-
 nomic stabilization program to become law.
 The  government's  difficulties  had  been
 created by the prolonged jockeying between the
 liberal leadership of the Communist Party and its
 conservative opposition for advantage not only
 within the party but within the recently reunified
 trade-union movement. The conservatives sought
 to increase their political appeal by advocating
 extreme wage demands and a policy of no com-
 promise with the other members of the center-left
 government coalition. Fearing the success of this
 tactic and the threat of either a split in the party
 or a take-over by the conservatives, the liberal
 leadership temporarily abandoned the "respon-
 sible" image it had cultivated in recent years and
 adopted the opposition's line. As a result, negotia-
 tions between the government, employers, and
 trade unions on a new economic stabilization
 agreement reached an impasse, and in late Novem-
 ber President Kekkonen finally intervened to
 stave off the collapse of the talks and a sub-
 sequent wave of strikes.
 Kekkonen's compromise economic stabiliza-
 tion proposal was accepted in early December by
 all parties except the Communists. Their con-
 tinued resistance prompted government leaders to
 threaten their expulsion from the coalition. After
 several weeks of bargaining, an agreement was
 reached  in  mid-December allowing the Com-
 munists to vote in parliament against minor parts
 of the compromise, provided they did not block
 its essential elements.
 Still unresolved, however, is the continued
 Communist resistance to the Kekkonen program
 within the trade-union movement. Several Com-
 munist-led unions have already rejected the com-
 promise, vowing to strike if their demands are not
 met. In order to influence unions still wavering,
 employers have been sweetening their contract
 offers, which, while technically within the Kek-
 konen framework, actually approach the terms
 originally demanded by the trade-union leader-
 ship.
 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 France-Algeria: An Impasse in Negotiations
 Algiers' rejection in late December of major
 French offers on petroleum prices and control of
 production has brought bilateral negotiations on
 oil and other problems to at least a temporary
 impasse. French Foreign Ministry officials for the
 first time envisaged the possibility of a break-
 down in the talks, with the consequent danger of
 a rupture in the over-all relationship. Quai Di-
 rector for Algerian Affairs Paoli speculated that
 the entire  matter would  be reviewed  by
 Pompidou before the fifth session of talks begins
 in Paris on 18 January and that presidential con-
 trol over the negotiating process might tighten,
 considerably.
 According to the respected French daily Le
 Figaro, whose account Paoli described as "reason-
 able," France offered to turn over to Algeria one
 third (or approximately ten million tons) of the
 current annual petroleum production of French
 companies in Algeria. Although this offer would
 bring the share of Algeria's national oil company

 Sonatrach to 50 percent of total production, the
 Algerians apparently are insisting on majority
 control over all producing companies, in addition
 to more substantial fiscal benefits.
 Paoli does not believe Paris could go any fur-
 ther toward meeting Algeria's desire. Bettering
 the current offer, in Paoli's view, would entail a
 fundamental change in the entire negotiating pro-
 cess. Some French newspapers already are claim-
 ing that the French offer represents excessive con-
 cessions to the Algerians at the expense of French
 companies and consumers.
 According to Paoli, domestic pressures will
 be one element in determining the stand Pom-
 pidou will take, although his strong position and
 his massive parliamentary majority give him con-
 siderable freedom. Most observers believe both
 countries have a great deal to lose if negotiations
 collapsed and particularly if a break in relations
 followed. Such a course would deal a sharp blow
 to Pompidou's Mediterranean policy, because
 Algeria has long been considered a vital link be-
 tween France and the rest of the Arab world.
 France's hurried evacuation in late Decem-
 ber of Bou Sfer-its last military base in Algeria-
 nearly seven years ahead of schedule apparently
 did little to placate the Algerians. It seems prob-
 able that Paris hoped to influence the talks favor-
 ably by a gesture of flexibility.

 Egyptians Wrap Up Military and Economic Affairs in Moscow
 The Egyptian delegation led by Vice Presi-
 dent Sabri obtained pledges of continuing Soviet
 economic and military assistance Burin  its recent
 visit to Moscow.
 or scale of military assistance is expected to result
 from the visit.
 Record amounts of military equipment ar-
 rived in Egypt during 1970. In addition to the
 SA-3 air defense system, which remains largely
 under Soviet control, and the accompanying
 Soviet troop commitment, Egypt also received
 electronic countermeasure equipment. The recent
 appointment of the senior air defense officer as
 chief Soviet military adviser to Egypt underscores
 the area in which the USSR probably will con-
 tinue to concentrate its efforts.
 Although  Egypt received fewer high-per-
 formance fighter aircraft from the USSR last year
 than in 1969, the effect on its inventory was
 offset by a reduction in combat losses. Cairo also
 received a record number of MI-8 helicopters, pre-
 sumably rocket-equipped. These have improved
 heliborne capabilities and keep before the Israelis
 the specter of Egyptian cross-canal operations.
 The only new economic aid offered during
 the visit provides for Soviet technical assistance to
 expand  military-related  industrial production.
 Cairo's ability to expand significantly its war-re-
 lated industries is limited, however, by its small
 resource base and the lack of sophistication of its
 existing capital goods industry. Moreover, quali-
 fied technicians for industry are in short supply
 because they are increasingly being employed in
 the military sphere.

 next six months that probably will lead to a 1971

 long-term economic cooperation agreement being
 concluded in June. Although additional economic
 aid projects also were discussed during the visit,
 more than $300 million in economic credits ex-
 tended in 1964 have yet to be drawn. Several
 economic development projects, such as the ex-
 pansion of the Helwan Iron and Steel Plant and
 oil prospecting in the Western Desert, are still far
 from completion. In addition, the Aswan High
 Dam has encountered numerous problems that
 are likely to require additional Soviet assistance

 Jordan Again Offers Carrot to the Palestinians
 Premier Wasfi Tal used a mandatory appear-
 ance before parliament on 2 January to indicate a
 new emphasis  in  the Jordanian Government's
 policy toward its internal problems. In his speech
 Tal took advantage of the current lull in fighting
 with the fedayeen to acknowledge both army
 valor and the "justice" of the Palestinians' efforts
 to regain their rights. In foreign affairs he lauded
 the proposed union of Egypt, Sudan, Libya, and
 Syria and he urged increased Arab unity. The
 main theme, however, was that the government
 now wants to offer something more than the
 simple hard line that bedouin army leaders have
 taken. The prime minister sought to reassure the
 Palestinians that the buildup of the army is aimed
 at defending the country and fighting the battle
 for the liberation of Arab lands, with the implica-
 tion that the Palestinians have little to fear if they
 will support this buildup rather than impede it.
 Tal's carrot is an ambitious government re-
 form program-which he will spell out at a later
 date-in the fields of education, health, roads,
 water, utilities, insurance, and employment. It is
 difficult to judge the workability of these pledges;
 Jordan is hardly in a financial position to embark
 upon a major program of social reform. However,
 Tal's speech once again emphasizes the fact that
 he has continued throughout his short term to
 underline the principles of accommodation and
 national unity for Jordan despite his past reputa-
 tion as a tough politician who takes a very hard
 line with dissidents.
 An intelligent, well-educated man as well as
 a practical politician with a long-standing interest
 in improving government efficiency, Tal is aware
 that military elimination of the fedayeen would
 probably create more problems than it would
 solve,  particularly  among Jordan's Palestinian
 population. During the present weakness of the
 fedayeen, the premier is obviously seeking to
 bring them into the fold, and his efforts are to
 some extent being supplemented by the Arab
 peace teams still operating in Jordan.
 So far Tal has had some success. Parliament
 gave him an overwhelming vote of confidence,
 and the fedayeen's chief newspaper applauded
 large parts of his speech, while noting some slip-
 page between his words and his deeds. Perhaps
 the chief immediate danger to his program lies in
 the army, which continues to bear down hard on
 the fedayeen at every opportunity. Tal's problems
 with the army may be alleviated somewhat when
 many of the units are engaged in extensive train-
 ing programs with new arms in areas remote from

 Arab States - Israel: Jarring Talks Resume
 Arab-Israeli negotiations under the auspices of
 Gunnar Jarring, UN Secretary General Thant's Mid-
 dle East envoy, resumed this week in New York
 after a five-month delay. Following preliminary
 contacts with the principals on 5 January, Jarring
 yielded to Israeli demands and agreed to go to
 Jerusalem on 7 January to talk to Foreign Minister
 Abba Eban.
 Jarring's report to the Security Council on the
 Middle East situation was distributed as required on
 5 January, one month before the cease-fire exten-
 sion expires. It did not attempt to place any blame
 for the stalling of the talks and thus provided little
 grist for the Soviet and Arab propaganda mills.
 Jarring and others may hope that his noncon-
 tentious report and efforts to conduct the talks in a
 business-like manner may head off an acerbic Secu-
 rity Council debate on the Arab-Israeli dispute be-
 fore the cease-fire expires. They also take hope
 from the fact that the new nonpermanent members
 who took their Council seats on 1 January are less
 inclined to be sympathetic to Arab positions. The
 Egyptians, however, are committed to a full-dress
 airing of the dispute if the Jarring talks fail to yield
 them anything that can be termed progress, and
 they will almost certainly appeal to the UN before
 announcing a formal termination of the cease-fire.
 In Cairo, Egyptian leaders are pleased that the
 Jarring talks are once again under way, but are not
 optimistic over prospects for meaningful progress.
 Cairo continues to believe that the US fully sup-
 ports Israeli policy positions and that the US is
 unwilling to apply the necessary  ressure on Tel
 Aviv to break the impasse.
 Sadat, meanwhile, has continued to under-
 score the need for making some progress in the
 political arena by his warnings that the cease-fire
 will not be renewed again unless a timetable for
 Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory is estab-
 lished. This condition, however, has on occasion
 been hedged somewhat, leaving open the possibility
 that as long as there is some tangible progress Egypt
 will continue to observe a de facto cease-fire or
 accept one dictated by the UN or the Big Four.
 The Israelis are expected to adopt a very tough
 stand in the talks and have continued to reject
 Sadat's demand for a timetable for withdrawal as a
 condition for a further extension of the cease-fire.
 Although Jarring has said that he accepted the
 Israeli invitation on the assumption that substantive
 matters would be discussed, it is highly unlikely
 that the Israelis will make any significant departure
 from their previously stated positions. They will
 probably press Jarring to raise the talks to the
 foreign minister level and move them from New
 York to the Middle East, preferably Cyprus.
 AFRICAN YOUTH CONFERENCE: The recent
 third congress of the Pan African Youth Movement
 which met in Dakar, Senegal, again highlighted the
 difficulty that African moderates have, even at
 home, in coping with African radicals. Delegates
 from only 21 of the 40 states invited showed up;
 six African liberation movements and several Com-
 munist front groups sent delegates.
 Although the moderates, led by Senegal, par-
 tially toned down the final report, it still comes
 down hard on the West while heaping praise on the
 revolutionaries in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin
 America. The report "rejects with force" proposals

 International Oil Developments
 The ten members of the Organization of
 Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)-Iran,
 Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar,
 Libya, Algeria, Indonesia, and Venezuela-have
 adopted resolutions aimed at substantially in-
 creasing their oil revenues. For one of the few
 times in the organization's ten years of existence
 both radical and moderate members joined to-
 gether during their December meeting to present
 a united front to the Western oil companies. This
 unity, however, is already being threatened by
 Libya, who has just recently made new demands
 on the oil companies outside the framework of
 the OPEC resolutions.
 The OPEC resolutions call for an across-the-
 board increase in the price on which taxes are
 based, a minimum tax rate of 55 percent (the
 lowest rate now is 50 percent), and a revision of
 the method by which tax reference prices are
 determined. Several other more technical resolu-
 tions would also provide additional revenue for
 OPEC members.
 An OPEC committee composed of represen-
 tatives from Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia are to
 present the resolutions to representatives of West-
 ern oil companies at a meeting to begin on 12
 January in Tehran. If negotiations are not con-
 cluded satisfactorily by 3 February, the OPEC has
 resolved to reconvene and "set forth a procedure
 with a view to enforcing and achieving the objec-
 tives through concerted and simultaneous action
 by all member countries."
 The oil companies and principal oil import-
 ing countries view the OPEC resolutions with
 apprehension, particularly because of the prece-
 dents set by the Libyans in their agreements last
 year. Libya, in effect, became the first oil produc-
 ing country that unilaterally established posted
 prices and tax rates. The oil companies will resist
 adoption of this principle by other OPEC mem-
 bers.
 Libya's action in presenting the oil com-
 panies with several new demands demonstrates
 the difficulties OPEC may have in keeping its
 members  unified.  By seeking  not  only  a
 five-percent tax  increase, but also mandatory
 reinvestment of a share of oil company revenues,
 an unspecified "Suez allowance," monthly tax
 payments in lieu of quarterly payments, and a
 provision for the oil companies to supply Libya's
 domestic petroleum needs "at cost," Libya has
 placed itself well ahead of OPEC

 Toure Focuses on Internal Subversion
 President Toure now is focusing his anger on
 local Guineans and resident foreigners that he is
 claiming have been involved with the Portuguese
 efforts to topple his regime.
 Throughout December Toure concentrated
 on   condemning  foreign  "imperialists"-spe-
 cifically Portugal-and on asking friendly states
 for materiel help in staving off predicted new
 attacks. Toure, while continuing to push strongly
 for aid, is increasingly preoccupied with possible
 subversive threats from within. He charged in a
 New Year's day speech that the "aggression
 against Guinea" last November was aided by a
 fifth column that included local Guineans as well
 as foreign accomplices. He promised to bring the
 accused-not yet specifically identified-before
 revolutionary tribunals and ordered all levels of

 Guinea's single political party to begin meeting to
 consider the "evidence."
 There have been no indications so far that
 any organized internal  opposition emerged in
 Guinea during or since the November attacks-
 Nevertheless, Toure
 seems intent on a purge, probably including a
 government shake-up.  Many Guineans already
 have been arrested, and at least four Europeans.
 Last week's abrupt expulsion of West German
 nationals was followed this week by a roundup of
 23  Western  mining  employees,  including  11
 Americans. These men were summarily tried and
 sentenced by a judge for "subversive" activities,
 but later were granted full amnesty by presiden-
 tial decree and released. Toure claimed subordi-
 nates had taken action without his knowledge.
 Despite Toure's assurances, these recent abrupt
 and arbitrary moves have added to the growing
 nervousness  among  Conakry's  foreign  com-
 munity. Toure's actions also have lost him some    25X1
 of the sympathy he gained abroad following the
 November attacks.
 The suspicion is growing among some mod-
 erate African states that Toure desires materiel
 support in order to bolster his internal position
 rather than to stave off new aggressions. Nigeria
 thus far appears reluctant to accede to an urgent
 request for troops made by Toure about 20 De-
 India: Opposition Electoral Alliance
 Three of the principal opposition parties
 have formed an alliance to contest the national
 elections beginning on 1 March. Prime Minister
 Gandhi, on the other hand, has said that her party
 will not enter into any country-wide electoral
 coalitions.
 The newly formed opposition alliance dem-
 onstrates that the desire to defeat Mrs. Gandhi
 can transcend ideological differences. The coali-
 tion consists of the right-of-center Organization
 Congress Party, the right-wing Hindu nationalist
 Jana Sangh Party, and the leftist Samyukta So-
 cialist                                                               Party  (SSP).  In the recently dissolved
 523-member lower house of parliament, the Or-
 ganization Congress was the largest opposition
 party, with 63 seats; the Jana Sangh and SSP held
 33 and 17 seats, respectively. In announcing the
 alliance on 3 January, the three parties said that
 they intend to support a single, agreed candidate
 in each constituency.
 The alliance suffered an initial setback when
 the right-wing, pro - free enterprise Swatantra
 Party refused to join. The Swatantra, whose 35
 parliamentary seats had made it the second largest

 prehensive arrangement, including a basic plat-
 form supported by all parties to the alliance in-
 stead of a simple agreement to back each other's
 candidates. There remains, however, the possibil-
 ity that the Swatantra may decide to join or
 cooperate with the alliance.
 Mrs. Gandhi's statement on 29 December
 that her Ruling Congress Party will form no na-
 tionwide alliances probably was a disappointment
 for the pro-Soviet Communist Party of India
 (CPI), which had expressed interest in arranging
 some kind of electoral collaboration with the
 Ruling Congress. Her announcement, however,
 Islamic Conference: Another Try
 The recently concluded conference in Kar-
 achi of Islamic foreign ministers is being touted
 by Saudi Arabia as the triumph of King Faysal's
 long-espoused policy of Islamic solidarity, despite
 evidence that disunity prevailed and substantive
 accomplishments were negligible. Saudi Arabia
 has sought to use such conferences to enhance its
 prestige against neighboring radical Arab regimes
 and to rally international Muslim support for the
 Arab position in the Middle East. Iraq, Syria,
 Southern Yemen, and the Sudan boycotted the
 meeting, arguing that it was being held under the
 leadership of reactionary governments.
 A  permanent  Islamic  Secretariat-to  be
 based in Jidda-was finally established after much
 haggling over its duties, size, and budget. Tunku
 Abd al-Rahman, former prime minister of Malay-
 sia, was named Secretary General. The future of
 does not preclude ad hoc cooperation in indivi-
 dual contests.
 Furthermore, it is possible that there could
 be some form of electoral cooperation between
 the Ruling Congress and the Dravida Munnetra
 Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK's strength is located
 almost entirely in the southern state of Tamil
 Nadu, which it now controls. Here Mrs. Gandhi's
 party is very weak, and the DMK's principal com-
 petitor is the opposition Organization Congress.
 The DMK and the Ruling Congress were allied
 against the Organization Congress in the munici-
 pal elections held in Tamil Nadu on 28 December.
 Additionally, the DMK, like the CPI, frequently
 supported Mrs. Gandhi on national issues in the
 recently  dissolved   arliamen.
 the Secretariat is in doubt, however, because
 those opposed or lukewarm to its establishment
 will probably delay contributing to its operating
 budget. Proposals to create an international bank
 and news agency under Muslim control were also
 discussed and shelved and probably will not be
 heard of again until the next conference, sched-
 uled for September in Kabul.

 some anti-US comments it was a relative)  bland

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Brazil: Negotiations for Diplomat's Release
 Negotiations continue for the release of
 Swiss Ambassador Bucher, kidnaped a month ago
 by terrorists.
 Late last week, the Popular Revolutionary
 Vanguard terrorists sent the government a new
 list of 70 names, including 24 new ones for those
 prisoners on the first list the authorities had re-
 fused to release for various reasons. On Monday
 the justice minister said that nine of the 24 re-
 placements were unacceptable because they had
 been sentenced to long prison terms, or had par-
 ticipated in previous kidnapings; he said that one
 already was free. The government communique
 asked the abductors to submit substitute names
 for these prisoners; the terrorists complied on
 Tuesday.  On Wednesday, the government ac-
 cepted five of the nine substitutes, leaving only
 four names to be resolved.
 The terrorists have backed down at every
 crucial point since they kidnaped the bachelor
 diplomat on 7 December. They dropped their
 original demands for publication of communiques
 in the press and for free railroad transportation,
 and have yielded when the administration refused
 to release prisoners they originally wanted freed.

 Cuba: 1971--Year of Productivity
 In a year-end address Fidel Castro renewed
 his recent demands for greater efficiency in the
 coming year and hinted of repressive measures for
 laggards and dissidents. He continued his practice
 of giving a name to the new year by labeling 1971
 the "Year of Productivity." His failure to offer
 suitable inducements to the workers, however,
 and his admission of serious economic short-
 comings suggest that the title for 1971 represents
 wishful thinking rather than a strong probability.
 Castro acknowledged that Cuba again faces
 its annual shortage of cane cutters in the sugar
 harvest and that 15,000 volunteers from Havana
 would again have to be recruited to serve in the
 interior for three months to satisfy critical labor
 needs. At the same time, he said that shifting the
 workers to the interior for agricultural work must
 not cause a drop in nonsugar industrial produc-
 tion in Havana. This practice contributed signif-
 icantly to production  problems in 1970; last
 August the labor minister promised such transfers
 would be minimized in the future.
 Castro  also  announced  that  the  "long
 awaited" bill against "parasitism and vagrancy"
 would be discussed with the workers beginning on
 10 January. The bill is aimed at curbing the
 alarming rate of absenteeism and also at com-
 bating the increasing rate of school dropouts. I n a
 speech to the same assembly, Armed Forces Min-
 ister Raul Castro estimated the number of chil-
 dren between 6 and 16 who drop out of school to
 be 300,000 to 400,000 and said that a new
 Committee on Human Resources would have as
 Chile: Government Maintains Momentum
 President Allende shows no signs of lagging
 in his program to produce major changes in Chile
 before effective opposition develops.
 At his New Year's reception for the diplo-
 matic corps, Allende quoted the late Pope John
 one of its major tasks the solving of the dropout
 problem. Youths who leave school prematurely
 and do not become productive members of soci-
 ety have long been a special irritant to the Castro
 regime. Fidel's latest tactic, following two un-
 successful programs, is the massive creation of
 trade schools for unemployed dropouts and for
 those lagging far behind in school work.
 The regime's growing concern about Cuban
 youth in general is reflected in the complete over-
 haul of the structure of the mass organization for
 young people begun last month. Some of the
 measures adopted were: the formation of a new
 Federation of Intermediate Level Students for
 those in junior and senior high school and tech-
 nological institutes; the splitting off of the Uni-
 versity Student Federation from the youth arm of
 the Cuban Communist Party (PCC); and the re-
 organization of the "Pioneers"-formerly the PCC
 youth  arm's  organization  for  children  under
 12-as an autonomous entity.
 The major revamping of the national labor
 organization-also begun last month, the reshuf-
 fling of the youth groups, and the hint of new
 repressive laws are unlikely to provide the moti-
 vational spark that Castro is seeking. Indeed,
 several of the measures constitute a step back-
 ward rather than forward. They are a gauge of
 Castro's frustration over his inability to improve
 the economic situation and will do little to help
 make 1971 the "Year of Productivity "            25X1
 XXIII on coexistence in response to a gracious
 tribute from the Papal Nuncio. Other moves bear
 out Allende's expressed intention of trying to
 keep the traditional ties while increasing relations
 with Communist governments.

 On 6 January Chile announced the establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations with Communist
 China, becoming the first country in South Amer-
 ica to do so. There has been a small Chinese trade
 mission in Santiago for more than five years.
 Although trade is minimal, Peking has shown an
 interest in buying Chilean copper directly instead
 of through West European markets. The prompt
 break in relations by the Chinese Nationalist Gov-
 ernment apparently did not bother the Chileans.
 They are showing greater caution as they move
 toward recognition of East Germany, however, in
 order not to jeopardize unnecessarily economic
 relations with West Germany.
 Foreign Minister Almeyda announced on 5
 January that a special envoy will advise Bonn of
 the decision to reach a consular agreement with
 East Germany very soon, with diplomatic rela-
 tions shortly thereafter. There have been similar
 efforts to reassure other West European countries
 and Japan that the new Chilean policies are de-
 signed primarily to "break US domination of the
 Chilean economy," and to strike a new balance in
 which the US will participate along with other
 investors at a reduced degree. The Dutch Govern-
 ment, however, has announced that it will not
 conclude an economic cooperation treaty with
 Chile at this time because there are not sufficient
 guarantees for investments.
 In an interview last week with the Soviet
 New Times, Allende maintained his low-key atti-
 tude on the USSR, but along with emphasis on
 the uniqueness of the Chilean experiment in
 building socialism, he praised Soviet society as
 "a reliable bulwark  of  peace  throughout  the
 world."
 On 4 January Allende issued a decree of
 amnesty freeing from imprisonment, detention,
 and  hiding  more  than  40  leftist  extremists
 charged with such common crimes as robbery and
 kidnaping. As in an earlier amnesty for extremists
 charged  with violating  internal  security laws,
 many of those affected belong to the radical
 Movement  of the   Revolutionary Left (MIR).
 Allende has shown surprising favoritism toward
 the MIR since he took office, to the annoyance of
 some members of his governing Popular Unity
 (UP) coalition to which the MIR does not belong.
 French revolutionary theorist Regis Debray, an
 admirer of the MIR, will join Allende's press staff.
 Debray went to Chile last month when Bolivia
 freed him after nearly four years in prison for
 involvement with Che Guevara's guerrillas.
 The UP's strongest member, the Communist
 Party (PCCh), particularly opposes the influence
 of the MIR, but it is moving with its usual skill to
 consolidate its own power. Communist leaders
 were instrumental in convoking a UP National
 Assembly this week to prepare for the municipal
 elections in April. The PCCh is particularly eager
 to revitalize the thousands of local UP com-
 mittees, most of which it controls. Communist
 officials  have  proven  more  intransigent than
 Socialists in carryin  out stringent new economic
 measures.

 Uruguay: Prospects Improving For Freedom of Hostages
 The publication this week of the Tupamaros'
 political manifesto by a Montevideo daily was a
 significant step toward  fulfilling the terrorists'
 conditions for release of US agronomist Claude
 Fly. The guerrillas ask that the document be
 published  by  major media  in the capital  in
 exchange for Fly, who was kidnaped on 7 August.
 The newspaper's action follows promulgation of a
 government  decree  relaxing  censorship laws.
 Previously, the administration had forbade all
 mention of the Tupamaros or their manifesto.
 Although the government has not penalized the
 paper for its action, which technically is still a
 crime, no other daily has yet followed this lead. If
 the administration takes no punitive action by the
 beginning of next week, however, other papers
 seem likely to print the document.
 Originally the Tupamaros demanded the re-
 lease of scores of prisoners in exchange for the
 hostages, but they have gradually scaled down
 their conditions in the face of the government's
 refusal to negotiate. The Tupamaros lost consider-
 able sympathy by their murder of one US hostage
 in August. They have gained little from their
 sequestering of the other two, and now appear
 increasingly ready to accept a face-saving formula
 for the release of the American.
 The other hostage, Brazilian consul Gomide,
 may still be held even if Fly is released. Gomide's
 wife has been attempting to raise one million
 dollars in Brazil for his ransom. If her effort fails,
 the Tupamaros may hope to negotiate directly
 with the Brazilian Government in hopes of gain-
 ing meaningful concessions.
 Central American Common Market Crisis Worsens
 A  proposed  Honduran  economic  decree
 darkens the already grim outlook for the Central
 American Common Market (CACM).
 The decree abrogates multilateral agreements
 on free trade and taxes and authorizes bilateral
 arrangements. The move, a virtual withdrawal
 from the Market, follows El Salvador's refusal to
 sign a proposed modus operandi-on which the
 Central  Americans had labored all last year-
 designed to meet Honduran complaints of un-
 equal benefit from CACM membership.
 The survival of CACM after this latest blow
 depends in large part on the state of demoraliza-
 tion among the Central American leaders. El Sal-
 vador, which has benefited substantially from the
 union, would be happiest to see a continuation of
 it without its enemy, Honduras. Nicaraguan Presi-
 dent Somoza, who was already pushing for a
 special meeting on 11 January of the Central
 American foreign ministers to rescue the modus
 operandi, may plead with Honduras to postpone
 official publication of its decree until such a con-
 ference can be held.
 I n the effort to patch the damage to CACM
 resulting from the war in 1969 between Honduras
 and El Salvador, members have overcome similar
 impasses. Patience on all sides is wearing thin,
 however, and hope of a union that includes the
 continually feuding Ell Salvador and Honduras is
 diminishing. A glimmer remains, nevertheless, in
 Somoza's tireless efforts to keep them talking,
 and in decisions by Costa Rica and Guatemala to
 call  retaliatory  charges  on  Honduran  goods
 "deposits  and  bonds"-which  presumably are
 ref u n dable-rather      than  duties.
